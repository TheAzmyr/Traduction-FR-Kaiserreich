 GRE_foreign_industry_GER1: "German-Owned Industry"
 GRE_foreign_industry_GER1_desc: "Thanks to our incredible war debts after the end of the disastrous Weltkrieg, King Constantine signed a deal allowing German investors unfettered access to the Greek economy.

 GRE_foreign_industry_GER3_desc: "Thanks to our incredible war debts after the end of the disastrous Weltkrieg, King Constantine signed a deal allowing German investors unfettered access to the Greek economy.

### Focuses ###
 GRE_black_monday_focus: "Black Monday"
 GRE_black_monday_focus_desc: "The Black Monday crisis has hit the Greek economy like a bull in a china shop, considering its domination by German businesses. It is time to take drastic action to resolve this crisis before it gets any worse."
 GRE_farming_crisis: "The Farming Crisis"
 GRE_farming_crisis_desc: "While the Greek economy saw strong industrial growth through the 19th century, it remains primarily orientated on agriculture, and thus the sudden drop in agricultural exports has hit the country hard. Farmers are nearly at a point of rioting, so addressing this crisis tops our agenda."
 GRE_foreign_industry_question: "Foreign-Owned Industries?"
 GRE_foreign_industry_question_desc: "Much of Greece's industry is owned by foreigners, mainly in Germany and Austria. With the financial crisis, many of these factories have begun to shut their doors, expecting Greece to deal with the political fallout until such a time as the economy recovers. With so many industrial workers left unpaid and out on the street, we must do something about this."
 GRE_board_of_industry: "The Board of Industry"
 GRE_board_of_industry_desc: "A new government agency must be created in order to oversee an overhaul of some of Greece's rather outdated industrial laws and practices."
 GRE_greek_mining: "Advancements in Mining"
 GRE_greek_mining_desc: "Much of our country's mining equipment and methods are rather old, sometimes dating back to the mid-19th century. We should encourage companies to update their equipment and research, in order to increase production."
 GRE_greek_rail: "Roads and Railways"
 GRE_greek_rail_desc: "A programme to build new roads and rails connecting Athens to the northern part of the country will not only enhance our overall infrastructure, it will create a much-needed employment programme for our industrial workers who are currently unemployed."
 GRE_land_reform: "Begin Land Reform"
 GRE_land_reform_desc: "Many of the country's agricultural communes are still overseen by wealthy landlords, with the peasants treated practically as serfs. While breaking up these holdings will be costly, it's the only way to see the farms increase their efficiency and bring us into the 20th century."
 GRE_privatize_industry: "Privatise Government Holdings"
 GRE_privatize_industry_desc: "There are a number of government-run businesses and factories which would best work in the hands of private individuals. They should be sold off to Greeks of means and expertise, even on the cheap, in order to diversify their portfolios and ensure that loyal citizens are enriched."
 GRE_nationalize_industry: "Nationalise Vital Companies"
 GRE_nationalize_industry_desc: "Too many vital industries are ready to go bankrupt. Only the nation's government is organised and efficient enough to keep them afloat, at least until the crisis is passed and, in the meantime, they can keep the economy afloat and Greeks employed."
 GRE_military_conversion: "Convert Military Factories"
 GRE_military_conversion_desc: "There are a number of military factories which we must consider turning over to commercial use. It means Greece will be less prepared for war in the future, but there will be no Greece if it crumbles around us thanks to the crisis."
 GRE_fund_business: "Take Out Loans"
 GRE_fund_business_desc: "We cannot dig any deeper - the only way to bail Greece out of this crisis is to take out as many loans as we can afford, and channel that money into employment programmes and funding the most promising companies willing to open new factories in Greece. It will hurt in the long run, but we have little choice."
 GRE_recovery: "Full Recovery"
 GRE_recovery_desc: "Our stimulus programmes have begun to improve the economic prospects of the country for now, and the crisis is passed. Hopefully, the price we paid does not come back to haunt us."

 GRE_monarchy_referendum: "Referendum on the Monarchy"
 GRE_monarchy_referendum_desc: "The legacy of the Greek monarchy still hangs over the republican government. Calls for a public referendum to determine if a monarchy should be restored for the stability of the nation, or if the republic should instead persist."
 GRE_republican_victory: "Republican Victory"
 GRE_republican_victory_desc: "There is to be no king. The question was settled today, with the vote to maintain the republic and continue into the future untethered to dynasties and successions."
 GRE_strengthen_republic: "Strengthen the Republic"
 GRE_strengthen_republic_desc: "The republic may have won the day, but monarchists still remain. By taking steps to reform the legal system and remove any and all remnants of monarchy from official proceedings we can move towards the permanent establishment of a republican nation."
 GRE_monarchist_question: "The Remaining Monarchists"
 GRE_monarchist_question_desc: "There are still many within the government, and especially the army, who yet hold loyalties to the monarchy. We must consider whether to purge them now, to prevent the possibility of a future coup, or to let them remain and potentially disrupt the republic's operation."
 #GRE_empowered_parliament: "An Empowered Parliament" already defined above as an idea
 GRE_empowered_parliament_desc: "In order to ensure that strongmen and dictators cannot exploit the system, the Greek nation must have a strong parliament capable of controlling the head of state, if necessary."
 #GRE_strong_executive: "A Strong Executive" already defined above as an idea
 GRE_strong_executive_desc: "In order to ensure that political infighting does not bring us down, the Greek nation must have a strong head of state who can overrule parliament, if necessary."

 GRE_balkan_democracy_desc: "Greece is a bastion of democracy in the Balkans, and must shine like a beacon of freedom for all to see."
 GRE_monarchist_victory: "Monarchist Victory"
 GRE_monarchist_victory_desc: "The kingdom shall be restored! Today the debate was settled, though now talk has turned to which king it should be: the younger Alexander, who was king before his exile, or the older George, who should have been king before Alexander and only was not due to being exiled with his father years before."
 GRE_king_alexandros: "King Aléxandros"
 GRE_king_alexandros_desc: "First crowned in 1917 and later exiled, King Alexander shall be returned to the throne. A moderate man used to being a figurehead, he shall serve as a constitutional monarch with only the minimum of formal powers."
 GRE_republican_question: "The Remaining Republicans"
 GRE_republican_question_desc: "With the king now back on the throne, a question lingers regarding what should be done with those who most oppose him and advocate a return to republican rule. The king advocates mercy, but would that only leave Greece to the possibility of more coups in the future?"
 GRE_empower_the_throne: "Empower the Throne"
 GRE_empower_the_throne_desc: "It seems Alexander has learned a thing or two in his exile and has been exerting his will on parliament more forcefully. He has garnered enough support to gain power enough to overrule the elected leaders when needed, making him far from the figurehead many assumed he would be."
 GRE_king_georgios: "King Geórgios"
 GRE_king_georgios_desc: "A military man from an early age, Prince George is the eldest son of the late King Constantine and shall create a strong monarchy along German lines, where the King serves as a brake on the powers of parliament."
 GRE_purge_republicans: "Purge Republicans"
 GRE_purge_republicans_desc: "A new king is on the throne, and his wishes are clear: those who yet harbour republican sentiment must be purged from the government and the army, lest the country fall into disorder once again."
 GRE_guide_parliament: "Guide Parliament"
 GRE_guide_parliament_desc: "We must support the great Greek tradition of democracy, but like Plato's Philosopher King the monarch must always be there to guide the nation towards a more perfect and peaceful society. By granting the monarch significant royal prerogatives to dissolve parliament as he wishes we can ensure that it is always well lead."
 #GRE_divine_mediator: "A Divine Mediator" already defined above as an idea
 GRE_divine_mediator_desc: "The king stands as a divinely anointed ruler, chosen by both God and the people to defend them from radicalism and instability. By mediating between all branches of government he can ensure that his will is followed, the dignity of the state is preserved and the people's needs can be made known to him."

 GRE_elections_1938: "1938 Elections"
 GRE_elections_1938_desc: "The elections of 1938 are promising to be most interesting, and as is typical for Greece it appears that many outcomes are possible."
 GRE_soc_liberals: "Néa Fileléftheri Énosi"

 GRE_industrialization_program: "Industrialisation Programme"
 GRE_industrialization_program_desc: "By working closely with businesses to target areas most capable of expansion we can grow our industrial economy through sensible and efficient investment. And if we get rich doing it, well, where's the harm?"

 GRE_market_liberals_desc: "The more market-oriented elements of the Liberal Party have won, and intend to begin at once a programme of economic liberalisation intended to stimulate trade and economic growth."
 GRE_free_market_reforms: "Free Market Reforms"

 GRE_embrace_free_trade: "Embrace Free Trade"
 GRE_embrace_free_trade_desc: "We intend to abolish all tariffs and pursue a policy of free trade wherever we can, in order that we might be free to do good business with all the world."
 GRE_liberalization: "Political Liberalisation"
 GRE_liberalization_desc: "Freedom of speech, the press, and of association are all to be protected more firmly under a raft of reforms we intend to pass in order to improve the lot of the average Greek. A free and open society will be established."
 GRE_education_programs: "Educational Programmes"
 GRE_education_programs_desc: "Improving the literacy rate of the Greek population is of paramount importance, as is broadening the quality of education in general. We intend to found hundreds of new schools for this purpose, where the keen minds of new generations will thrive."
 GRE_neuter_military: "Neuter Military"
 GRE_neuter_military_desc: "By far the biggest threat to stability in Greece comes from the military, while we accept the need for the armed forces we must take steps to ensure their political neutrality and remove overly ambitious demagogues from the ranks."
 GRE_strong_and_free: "Strong and Free"
 GRE_strong_and_free_desc: "It may not always be wise to give power to the military, lest they abuse it, but without our army's strength we will never truly be independent. We must empower them and keep Greece both strong and free."
 GRE_progressive_greece: "A Progressive Greece"
 GRE_progressive_greece_desc: "The Greek people have embraced a brighter, more liberal future that believes in social progress and the rights of man. We are Greeks, proud and indivisible as equals."

 GRE_soc_conservatives: "Laïkón Kómma"
 GRE_soc_conservatives_desc: "The more moderate People's Party seems to have come out on top in the coalition negotiations. While they are likely to reverse secular reforms, they are not as fervently anti-union and will support those based around Christian principles and leadership."
 GRE_christian_unions: "Found Christian Unions"
 GRE_christian_unions_desc: "Founding state-endorsed unions under the leadership of priests will allow us to prevent labour disputes from getting out of hand and becoming a threat to the safety of Greece. Workers will be able to express their wants and concerns to the clergy, who will serve as negotiators on their behalf."
 GRE_export_oriented_economy: "Export-Oriented Economy"
 GRE_export_oriented_economy_desc: "The Greek economy would be best served with a focus on exports, allowing cash to flow into the country and further develop her industries. To this end, we intend to raise industrial tariffs while seeking free trade arrangements for our agricultural produce."
 GRE_auth_dems: "Néos Krátos"
 GRE_auth_dems_desc: "The authoritarian, but still republican, New State have taken the lion's share of the influence in the new parliament. Fiercely anti-union and protectionist, their rule promises to take a firm hand to radicals if nothing else."
 GRE_smash_unionism: "Smash Unionism"
 GRE_smash_unionism_desc: "Unionism is a dangerous element of our society, just look at how it brought low the mighty British Empire. For the good of the people, unions must be suppressed and their leaders rooted out."
 GRE_finding_our_own_way: "Finding our own Way"
 GRE_finding_our_own_way_desc: "Greece must find its own way towards greater industrialisation - somewhere between providing incentives for private corporations, but also not relinquishing the government's right to decide which industries are best to promote and which must remain under our direct control. We will see Greece forge a path to true economic strength... but we shall do it the Greek way."
 GRE_reverse_secularisation: "Reverse Secularisation"
 GRE_reverse_secularisation_desc: "Greece is, has always been, a Christian nation first and foremost. It was the Church that led us to independence and the attempts by the liberal parties to end the marriage of State and Faith must be reversed."
 GRE_sponsor_church_schools: "Sponsor Church Schools"
 GRE_sponsor_church_schools_desc: "Official state support given to faith schools of all education tiers, from primary schools all the way to church-run universities, will help to both promote scientific education and to solidify Christian values into our society."
 GRE_christian_democracy: "Christian Democracy"
 GRE_christian_democracy_desc: "We are fortunate that the will of our people is guided by Christian values and a desire to build a more virtuous society. Stability will come to Greece with the government pairing with the Church to give them a place in parliament where they belong."
 GRE_managed_democracy: "Managed Democracy"
 GRE_managed_democracy_desc: "Democracy is a proud Hellenic invention that we will continue to preserve. However its myriad dangers mean it must be carefully tended by a strong judiciary and executive, lest it be subverted from within."
 GRE_moral_greece: "A Moral Greece"
 GRE_moral_greece_desc: "Together in Greece we are building a better future, a more Christian, more moral future. Our economy must thrive but it must also put Christian values of justice, peace and humility first."

 GRE_radical_socialists: "Agrotikó Dimokratikó Métopo"
 GRE_radical_socialists_desc: "The radical agrarians have won through, and now intend to push forth a deeply anti-urban programme of land redistribution and communal farming."
 GRE_abolish_landlordism: "Abolish Landlordism"
 GRE_abolish_landlordism_desc: "Landlords are one of the primary means via which the peasantry is oppressed in our country. By liquidating all those who do not work the land directly and distributing their land to agricultural communes we can ensure our farmers will no longer suffer under their heel."
 GRE_planned_industry: "Planned Industry"
 GRE_planned_industry_desc: "Unlike what many believe, agrarianism is not antithetical to a strong industrial state. Quite the opposite, in fact. Industrialisation, however, must be carefully planned so it does not disturb the careful balance required by our agricultural sector. This requires heavy government intervention and control: the right industry in the right place, manned by the right people."
 GRE_soc_dems: "Ethnikón Enotikón Kómma"
 GRE_soc_dems_desc: "The much more moderate agrarians have won. While they intend to primarily support the peasantry through social reforms and subsidies, they are not as dedicated to the abolition of urban society and the bourgeoisie as their counterparts."
 GRE_political_liberties: "Political Liberties"
 GRE_political_liberties_desc: "Within Greece there is a lack of simple political freedoms for many of the lower classes. By bringing forth a series of reforms dedicated to extending the freedom of speech, association, and expression we can help the people's voice to be heard in politics."
 GRE_new_enterprise: "A New Enterprise"
 GRE_new_enterprise_desc: "A socialist state cannot truly be successful without creating a partnership with its private entrepreneurs and corporations. We must create a government body to oversee industrialisation efforts, to ensure that growth is done responsibly but also remains in the hands of those who will keep it efficient."
 GRE_breadbasket: "Breadbasket of the Mediterranean"
 GRE_breadbasket_desc: "Every inch of cultivable land must be grown on, Greece shall become the breadbasket of the Mediterranean and prosper as she feeds herself and all of her neighbours."
 GRE_planned_research: "Planned Research"
 GRE_planned_research_desc: "A government body must be created to oversee research efforts, pushing us in the direction that is of most benefit to all of Greece."
 GRE_agrarian_socialism: "Agrarian Socialism"
 GRE_agrarian_socialism_desc: "Our major support base is in the countryside, to whom we must devolve significant political powers in order to ensure that cities do not come to dominate our politics. The creation of a true rural democracy based around the communes is our future."
 GRE_industrial_socialism: "Industrial Socialism"
 GRE_industrial_socialism_desc: "We will be a socialist state with a strong preference for our agrarian roots, it's true, but we will do it while also increasing our industrial strength. A true industrial state has a partnership with its agrarian base - they need not be enemies."
 GRE_socialist_greece: "A Socialist Greece"
 GRE_socialist_greece_desc: "What's most important to our future as a socialist state is that we focus on what the people need: keep the rural parts of our nation healthy and happy and Greece will be far more stable than it's ever been."

 GRE_old_order_overthrown: "The Old Order Overthrown"
 GRE_old_order_overthrown_desc: "We have done the impossible and tossed out the old forces of monarchism and staid republicanism. Now the workers of Greece have a real chance to bring the country into the future, unchained from its dismal and unstable past."
 GRE_syndicalist_victory: "First Hellenic Congress"
 GRE_syndicalist_victory_desc: "The first order of business will be to hold a congress and organise the trade unions - and part of that will be deciding who will be the new chairman. Will it be the leader of the syndicalists, or will Greece veer towards a more hardline and authoritarian government under the totalists?"
 GRE_cooperate_with_agrarians: "Cooperate with the Agrarians"
 GRE_cooperate_with_agrarians_desc: "The Agrarian Party has a very different vision of socialism to the more orthodox syndicalists, envisioning a more pre-industrial society rooted in agricultural communes. However, they are open to compromise, while extensive support and power must be given to the farmer's unions we will be able to resist calls from their most radical elements to encourage the total dissolution of the cities entirely."
 GRE_establish_communes: "Establish Communes"
 GRE_establish_communes_desc: "By abolishing the old systems of local governance and establishing local communes in their place we can bring syndicalism to the people of Greece, and pave the way for the first true Congress of the Trade Unions to be held in this island of freedom from capitalist oppression."
 GRE_crush_bourgeoisie: "Crush the Bourgeoisie"
 GRE_crush_bourgeoisie_desc: "The Bourgeoisie are the truest enemy of the people, they must be shown that we will not back down from our revolutionary aims. By harnessing the anger of the proletariat towards those that have exploited them we can force them to surrender their property and submit to the new regime upon pain of death."
 GRE_rally_behind_dioitikis: "Rally behind the Dioikitis"
 GRE_rally_behind_dioitikis_desc: "The Diokitis, a word which means 'leader' in the same sense as the Russian 'Vohzd', is the people's truest friend and guide through the long road to socialism.

 GRE_void_debts: "Void Debts"
 GRE_void_debts_desc: "Some nations have been clamouring for the new people's government to acknowledge and undertake payment of the old regime's debts. This is unacceptable - those debts belong to the capitalists and thieves who foisted them upon the people to begin with."

 GRE_restore_monarchy_desc: "Greece is, by right, a kingdom - and the youngest of the three princes has learned a thing or two during his exile that makes him the perfect head of state to help bring the country into the future.

 GRE_state_orthodoxy: "State Orthodoxy"
 GRE_state_orthodoxy_desc: "Orthodoxy is Greece's dominant religion, and will be a useful tool in informing people of the divinely appointed nature of their leadership. To that end, we must take steps to curtail the independence of the Greek Orthodox Church and bring it under state control."
 GRE_foreign_investment: "Lure Foreign Investment"

 GRE_propaganda_desc: "Everyone in Greece has opinions. It's what makes this country fine, but it is also what has driven us apart. The time has come to make sure that their opinions have something in common: that they all believe as we do, and that unity will make us stronger."

 GRE_mobility: "Mobile Support"

 GRE_evaluate_air_force: "Polemikí Aeroporía"
 GRE_evaluate_air_force_desc: "Aviation is a science in which Greece must make significant advances in very little time if she is to catch up. Some say we should instead focus our efforts on defending against an enemy air force, rather than waste precious resources on attempting to expand our own."
 GRE_air_academy: "Hellenic Air Force Academy"

It will be difficult in the short term, but in the long term it will be better for us both."
 GRE_balkans_trade: "Balkans Cooperation"

 GRE_country_intro_header: "The Fourth Hellenic Republic"
 GRE_country_intro_content: "The years since Greece's loss in the Weltkrieg have seen little but upheaval and hardship. The loss of Macedonia to the Treaty of Salonika and crippling war debts to Austria and Germany sent King Alexander fleeing into exile as the Third Republic was declared... only to result in years of failed governments and coups until Georgios Kondylis took control in 1926 and declared himself the permanent Regent of Greece, even though its king remained in exile. Kondylis was finally overthrown and executed in 1931, leading to the Fourth Republic and the coalition government of Geórgios Papandreou which won its first election."

 GRE_country_intro_header_1: "The Challenges Ahead"
 GRE_country_intro_content_1: "The new republic, which faces its next election in 1938, faces several challenges before then: most prominent is the simmering resentment towards the loss of Greek territory. Most are certain that war is coming again soon, with many groups such as the syndicalist rebels and the looming figure of Ioannis Metaxas waiting for the first moment the government makes the slightest misstep. Monarchist sentiment is also on the rise, with many demanding that another referendum be held soon to determine whether the kingdom should be restored... even if republicans fear that doing so would only plunge the nation into anarchy yet again."

### Events
 gre.3.t: "Independence Day"
 gre.3.d: "In 1821, Greeks rose up against the oppressive Ottoman Empire, which had occupied Greece for nearly four hundred years. Bishop Germanos of Patras boldly raised the Greek flag at the monastery of Agia Lavras, inciting the Greek revolution. While the exact date probably was not March 25th, it did occur in late March and it was gradually associated with the religious feast of the Annunciation which occurs on the same date. On the day of the Feast of the Annunciation the archangel Gabriel appeared to the maiden Mary and announced the news, she was pregnant with the divine child. Bishop Germanos chose this day to deliver a different but not unrelated message, a new spirit was about to be born in Greece."
 gre.3.a: "A new spirit shall be born again!"

 gre.4.d: "Independence Day is celebrated once again in [Root.GetNameDef], with crowds lining the streets in Athens and other cities, all waving the Greek flag and singing 'Ýmnos is tin Eleftherían' - the Hymn to Freedom, and the country's national anthem. Despite all the hardship the country has faced, its people are still eager to celebrate their sense of independence from those who would oppress them."
 gre.4.a: "Hail, o hail, Liberty!"

 gre.5.t: "Black Monday hits Greece!"
 gre.5.d: "The rapid German economic collapse has reached our nation! Our reliance on trade with Germany and Mitteleuropan dominance of our economy has exacerbated the crisis, with many German factories being instructed to shut down. Worse, the spread of the crisis has meant a lack of markets for our agricultural exports, and already farmers are facing a crisis where almost none of them can sell their crops. We must quickly work to address this crisis, lest it grow out of hand and sow chaos throughout our nation."
 gre.5.a: "O Theós na mas voithísei!"

 gre.6.t: "Responding to the Crisis"
 gre.6.d: "With the number of farmers left holding crops and nowhere to sell them, we are left with a choice: either support them for the current year and encourage them to switch away from their reliance on exports, or dig deep into our pockets and support them fully until the economic crisis has passed."
 gre.6.a: "Help them out as much as we can."
 gre.6.b: "Dig deep - they're the backbone of Greece."

 gre.7.t: "Foreign-Owned Industry"
 gre.7.d: "Almost half of our economy is owned by investors in Germany and Austria, but after Black Monday many of their mines and factories have closed down - some because they have become unprofitable but others because the investors are trying to save money or have gone bankrupt. In either case, many thousands of Greeks have been put out of work. The suggestion is that we should seize these assets, or at least the worst cases, despite the Treaty of Salonika stipulating that we cannot. The only way to prevent a backlash from either country, however, is to subsidise the investors out of our own pocket... a deeply unpopular move if we attempted it, to be sure."
 gre.7.a: "Seize it all, no matter the repercussions."
 gre.7.b: "Deal with the worst cases only."
 gre.7.c: "Subsidise the investors ourselves - they'd better be grateful."

 gre.8.t: "Greece Seizes [Root.GetAdjective] Assets"
 gre.8.d: "Thanks to the rippling effects of Black Monday, [Root.GetAdjective] investors who held majority shares in Greek factories and mines have been closing those businesses down - in some cases because they're unprofitable, but in others because the investors have gone bankrupt. The Greek government has responded by seizing the companies, despite the Treaty of Salonika signed after the war stipulating that our investors have unfettered access to their economy. Many in the government are suggesting we respond harshly, and not only apply sanctions but pull all investment out of [From.GetNameDef] altogether. Others say the country is only trying to stay afloat - Black Monday has hit all of us hard."
 gre.8.a: "Apply sanctions and pull all business out at once."
 gre.8.b: "Just apply the sanctions and express our outrage."
 gre.8.c: "Leave them be - we're all trying to cope."

 gre.9.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Applies Harsh Sanctions"
 gre.9.d: "The [From.GetAdjective] government has applied a range of economic sanctions in response to our contravention of the Treaty of Salonika - including pulling all assets out of the country, including those which were still operational - but thankfully has gone no further. The move will sting for a few years, to be sure, and has seriously soured relations between our countries."
 gre.9.a: "It had to be done."

 gre.10.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Applies Sanctions"
 gre.10.d: "The [From.GetAdjective] government has applied a range of economic sanctions in response to our contravention of the Treaty of Salonika, but thankfully has gone no further. The move will sting for a few years, to be sure, and has soured relations between our countries."

 gre.11.t: "Greece Seizes [Root.GetAdjective] Assets"
 gre.11.d: "Thanks to the rippling effects of Black Monday, [Root.GetAdjective] investors who held majority shares in Greek factories and mines have been closing those businesses down - in some cases because they're unprofitable, but in others because the investors have gone bankrupt. The Greek government has responded by seizing many of the worst cases, despite the Treaty of Salonika signed after the war stipulating that our investors have unfettered access to their economy. Many in the government are suggesting we respond with sanctions, while others say the Greeks are simply doing what they have to in order to survive - they could, after all, have seized all investor assets if they'd wished, and not simply some."
 gre.11.a: "Apply sanctions - they must be taught a lesson."

 gre.12.t: "Monarchists Demand Referendum"
 gre.12.d: "Several prominent aristocrats, led by the influential former general Ioannis Metaxas, today stormed Parliament and demanded the government begin a referendum on the future of the monarchy. They say the question must be settled once and for all, and the government has put it off for too long. Their position has gained considerable support among the people, as well."
 gre.12.a: "Perhaps we should consider it?"

 gre.14.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Asks to Join the [Root.GetFactionName]"
 gre.14.d: "[From.GetNameDefCap] has sent a formal request, asking to be admitted into the [Root.GetFactionName]. Are they worth the possibility we might also get dragged into their struggles?"

 gre.14.b: "They're more trouble than they're worth."

 gre.15.t: "We are Part of the [From.GetFactionName]"
 gre.15.d: "The [From.GetAdjective] government has agreed to admit us into their alliance. We are now officially part of the [From.GetFactionName]."
 gre.15.a: "Excellent."

 gre.16.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Has Refused"
 gre.16.d: "Perhaps deciding we're more trouble than we're worth, the [From.GetAdjective] government has refused to admit us into the [From.GetFactionName]."
 gre.16.a: "Ah well."

 gre.17.t: "Massive Demonstrations Against the Government"
 gre.17.d: "The country's loss in the war has triggered demonstrations across [Root.GetNameDef], all calling for the government to step down immediately. Indeed, it is apparent that forces are beginning to array themselves to take control of the country by force if the government does not step down, and the fear is that the country is on the verge of civil war."
 gre.17.a: "This is a disaster!"

 gre.18.t: "The Government Nears Collapse"
 gre.18.d: "Demonstrations have continued against the government, with the situation having finally reached a critical mass. If the government doesn't step down immediately, radical elements could take control, or the country could completely dissolve into chaos."
 gre.18.a: "Forces loyal to Ioannis Metaxas take over to maintain order."
 gre.18.b: "Athanasios Klaras wrests control in a coup."
 gre.18.c: "The army takes control, promising free and democratic elections."
 gre.18.e: "The King abdicates the throne, restoring the republic."
 gre.18.f: "The government steps down, promising immediate elections."

 gre.19.t: "The Death of Ioannis Metaxas"
 gre.19.d.ishos: "President Ioannis Metaxas, leader of [Root.GetNameDef], died today of a phlegmon of the pharynx. He has been succeeded by Alexandros Koryzis, his chosen successor, though many fear Koryzis cannot hope to match Metaxas's personal magnetism and military record. While Metaxas was considered a controversial figure by many, people still lined the streets throughout the country to mourn the man's death."
 gre.19.d.nothos: "Former general Ioannis Metaxas, a war hero and politician renowned for his strong beliefs, died today of a phlegmon of the pharynx. While Metaxas was considered a controversial figure by many, people still lined the streets throughout the country to mourn the man's death."
 gre.19.a: "He shall be remembered."

 gre.20.t: "The Death of Alexandros Papanastasiou"
 gre.20.d.ishos: "Prime Minister Alexandros Papanastasiou died today of a sudden heart attack. As the nation mourns his passing, former general Nikolaos Plastiras has taken over his duties as well as leadership of the National Unionist Party."
 gre.20.d.nothos: "Alexandros Papanastasiou, leader of the National Unionist Party, died today of a sudden heart attack. Former general Nikolaos Plastiras has taken over leadership of the party, and gave a speech in Athens today honouring the man who, in his words, 'served [GRE.GetNameDef] until his last breath'."
 gre.20.a: "A fine man."

 gre.21.t: "Kostas Gavriilides Steps Down"
 gre.21.d.ishos: "Kostas Gavriilides, long-time leader of the radical Rural Democratic Front and president of [Root.GetNameDef], today stepped down from his position to retire. After a debate within the party, leadership has been passed to Gavriilides's chosen successor, Nikos Ploumpidis."
 gre.21.d.nothos: "Kostas Gavriilides, long-time leader of the radical Rural Democratic Front, today stepped down from his position to retire. After a debate within the party, leadership has been passed to Gavriilides's chosen successor, Nikos Ploumpidis."
 gre.21.a: "OK."

 gre.22.t: "The Papandreou Scandal"
 gre.22.d: "A number of government ministers have been caught up in a corruption scandal, revealed by the press, but the nation was shocked today to learn that Prime Minister Georgios Papandreou also stands accused. While it seems there is insufficient evidence for formal charges to be laid, the scandal has been enough for the New Liberal Coalition to consider whether Papandreou should continue as the party leader."
 gre.22.a: "Panagiotis Kanellopoulos wrests control of the party."
 gre.22.b: "Papandreou holds onto leadership after a narrow vote."

 gre.23.t: "The Death of Themistoklis Soufilis"
 gre.23.d.ishos: "Prime Minister Themistoklis Soufilis died today, his health having suffered since taking power in the last election. Though most in the government were unsurprised, having expected this for months, the nation was overcome with shock and mourners have lined the streets in Athens. Leadership of his wing of the Liberal Party has fallen to his deputy, Konstantinos Tsatsos."
 gre.23.d.nothos: "Themistoklis Soufilis died today, his health having suffered since the last election. Though most in the Liberal Party were unsurprised, having expected this for months, the nation greeted the news with shock and mourners have lined the streets in Athens. Leadership of his wing of the Liberal Party has since fallen to his deputy, Konstantinos Tsatsos."
 gre.23.a: "He shall be missed."

 gre.24.t: "The Death of Panagis Tsaldaris"
 gre.24.d: "Panagis Tsaldaris, leader of the Peoples' Party, died today as a result of a degenerative health condition which has plagued him since assuming leadership of the party several years ago. As mourners marked his passing, his leadership role has since fallen to his nephew, Konstantinos Tsaldaris. The new Peoples' Party head declared in a speech that he intended to 'carry on his uncle's legacy with his whole heart'."
 gre.24.a: "Hardly unexpected."

 gre.50.t: "National Elections of [GetYear]"
 gre.50.d: "The time has come for Greeks to head to the polls, with the major parties campaigning hard to win control of the government."

 gre.50.b: "The New Liberal Coalition carries the day."
 gre.50.c: "The Liberal Party manages a win."
 gre.50.e: "The National Unionist Party surprises with victory."

 gre.51.t: "National Elections of [GetYear]"
 gre.51.d.noban: "With the socialist agrarians having gained considerable headway, absorbing much of the remaining anti-monarchist sentiment, the traditional political parties may be hard-pressed to win in today's election."
 gre.51.d.ban: "The ban on the socialist agrarians taking part in the elections has made some decree it an illegitimate one, yet even so the Greek people have assembled at the polls to select a new government."
 gre.51.a: "The Peoples' Party wins."
 gre.51.b: "The Rural Democratic Front is victorious."
 gre.51.c: "A coalition of liberals and moderate socialists carries the day."

 gre.52.t: "National Elections of [GetYear]"
 gre.52.d.noban: "The syndicalists have benefited from their coalition with moderate socialists, and now present a real threat as the Greek people go to the polls. The world watches nervously as the election results come in..."
 gre.52.d.ban: "The ban on the syndicalists and socialist agrarians taking part in the elections has made some decree it an illegitimate one, yet even so the Greek people have assembled at the polls to select a new government."
 gre.52.a: "The Peoples' Party manages a surprise upset."
 gre.52.b: "The New Liberal Coalition carries the day."
 gre.52.c: "The Liberal Party is victorious."
 gre.52.e: "The Social Workers' Party of Greece takes the election!"

 gre.53.t: "The Restoration of Democracy"
 gre.53.d: "The army has maintained its promise, and today Greeks go to the polls to elect a new government."

 gre.54.t: "The New Government"
 gre.54.d: "While the elections have been contentious, only one outcome is certain: the former Greek government has zero chance of winning. This contest is entirely about who will step up to replace those which the public feel lost the war."

 gre.100.t: "The Referendum Begins"
 gre.100.d: "Word has been sent out to former King Alexander, currently in exile along with the rest of the royal family, that the referendum on the future of the monarchy has begun. Already lines have been drawn, with the pro-republicans and the pro-monarchists attempting to convince anyone and everyone of how to vote. It will be a difficult couple of months until the vote is actually held, and expectations are high that it will not be a peaceful time for Greece."
 gre.100.a: "Let's hope there's no trouble..."

 gre.101.t: "Monarchists in the Streets"
 gre.101.d: "The pro-monarchist forces are busily campaigning in the streets of Athens and other Greek cities, handing out pamphlets which suggest the government has not done its job and is in need of a king to watch over us. They are gaining considerable traction, and some are suggesting that we should make efforts to shut them down before their actions grow out of hand."
 gre.101.a: "Allow them to distribute their pamphlets."
 gre.101.b: "We must suppress this nonsense."

 gre.102.t: "The Republican Campaign"
 gre.102.d: "There are a number of advisors in the government growing nervous at the prospect of a monarchist victory. They are suggesting we should consider funding a campaign of our own, in favour of republicanism - quietly, of course, so not to draw undue suspicion that we are exerting too much influence on the results. This is, however, exactly what they want."
 gre.102.a: "Yes, we should fund this effort."
 gre.102.b: "No, we should not get involved."
 gre.102.c: "Discourage this talk within our government."

 gre.103.t: "Aristocratic Lobbying"
 gre.103.d: "Reports have it that a large number of wealthy Greek aristocrats are busily buying up influence within the government, what they call 'lobbying'... and, it's said, with the assistance of the influential Ioannis Metaxas, who himself has weighed heavily in favour of the monarchy's restoration. If we allow this influence-peddling to continue, the monarchists will definitely gain an advantage in the upcoming referendum."
 gre.103.a: "We'll allow it."
 gre.103.b: "Place a moratorium on this 'lobbying'"

 gre.104.t: "The Syndicalist Rally"
 gre.104.d: "Small rallies have been held throughout the north by the syndicalists, with a huge rally apparently planned for tomorrow in the city of Athens - with the charismatic Nikos Zachariadis, leader of the Kinonikó Ergatikó Kómma, said to be preparing a fiery speech against the monarchy and all it stands for. There are fears that Zachariadis might do more than stir up republican support, however, and also gain plenty of support for his own revolutionary ideas."
 gre.104.a: "Allow the rally to proceed."
 gre.104.b: "Send in the police to break it up, by force if necessary."

 gre.105.t: "Monarchist Riot"
 gre.105.d: "Rioting has broken out in Athens after fears by monarchist supporters that they will lose the upcoming referendum were followed by accusations that our government was attempting to rig it. There has been considerable damage, and a large number of assaults on republican supporters and their headquarters. If we don't do something soon, the damage done to the republican cause will be significant."
 gre.105.a: "Keep it contained, but use leniency."
 gre.105.b: "Shut this down with extreme prejudice."

 gre.106.t: "Republican Riot"
 gre.106.d: "Rioting has broken out in Athens after fears by republican supporters that they will lose the upcoming referendum were followed by accusations that our government was attempting to rig it. There has been considerable damage, and a large number of assaults on several aristocrats as well as monarchist supporters and their headquarters. If we don't do something soon, the damage done to the monarchist cause will be significant."

 gre.107.t: "Monarchists Have the Advantage"
 gre.107.d: "The sentiment within Greece in the lead up to the referendum appears to be favouring the monarchists. Some are suggesting that, if the government were to intervene and rig the referendum, now would be the time to begin. The more popular the monarchists become, the less likely the rigging would be successfully kept secret, but advisors say that the alternative is that the monarchists might win."
 gre.107.a: "We need to rig the outcome in favour of the republic."
 gre.107.b: "Might win? We must rig the referendum to ensure it!"
 gre.107.c: "Do nothing - we will accept the legitimate results."

 gre.108.t: "Republicans Have the Advantage"
 gre.108.d: "The sentiment within Greece in the lead up to the referendum appears to be favouring the republicans. Some are suggesting that, if the government were to intervene and rig the referendum, now would be the time to begin. The more popular the republicans become, the less likely the rigging would be successfully kept secret, but advisors say that the alternative is that the republicans might win."
 gre.108.a: "We need to rig the outcome in favour of the monarchy."

 gre.109.t: "Voting Begins"
 gre.109.d: "Today, all throughout Greece, voting has begun on the referendum to determine the future of the Fourth Republic. King Alexander is on-hand in Athens, having returned to the country for the first time since his exile, though it will be several days until the final results are tallied."
 gre.109.a: "We're on pins and needles."

 gre.111.t: "Republican Victory"
 gre.111.d: "The question of the monarchy's future has finally been settled, and the answer is that the Fourth Republic will live on. The king and the rest of the royal family will return to exile, and while it will take some time for the republic's strength to be solidified, for now it seems the debate is finally over."
 gre.111.a: "Long live the Republic of Greece!"

 gre.112.t: "Monarchist Victory"
 gre.112.d: "The question of the republic's future has finally been settled, and it is with celebration throughout the country that its people welcome back the royal family. There is, however, already disagreement on who should assume the throne: should it be King Alexander, the unpopular younger brother who ascended to the throne after his father and brother were originally exiled, or Prince George, the brother who should have been the heir and yet has never been king? Alexander is considered the more moderate and legitimate choice, considering George's autocratic tendencies, but George is clearly the popular favourite."
 gre.112.a: "We will need to decide soon."

 gre.113.t: "Rigging Suspected"
 gre.113.d.monarchist: "While the monarchists proved victorious in the referendum, there are many republicans who suspect the government of rigging the results... enough so that crowds of their supporters have poured into the streets throughout the nation to demand an investigation. Syndicalist leader Nikos Zachariadis is spearheading these demands, and many fear that if the slightest bit of evidence is uncovered of deceit, that will be enough of a spark to allow the syndicalists to overthrow the government in a popular coup."
 gre.113.d.republican: "While the republicans proved victorious in the referendum, there are many monarchists who suspect the government of rigging the results... enough so that crowds of their supporters have poured into the streets throughout the nation to demand an investigation. Former general Ioannis Metaxas is spearheading these demands, and many fear that if the slightest bit of evidence is uncovered of deceit, that will be enough of a spark to allow Metaxas to overthrow the government in a popular coup."
 gre.113.a: "The rigging is discovered!"
 gre.113.b: "No evidence is uncovered and the protests die down."

 gre.114.t: "The Metaxas Coup"
 gre.114.d: "Our worst fears have been realised: the attempt to rig the election in favour of the republicans has been discovered, with several government officials having gone public with the proof. Riots have spread throughout the country, and former General Ioannis Metaxas has stepped in to take over. He and numerous army supporters have stormed parliament, arresting government leaders and declaring Metaxas as interim President and dictator."
 gre.114.a: "So ends democracy in Greece once again..."

 gre.115.t: "The Syndicalist Coup"
 gre.115.d: "Our worst fears have been realised: the attempt to rig the election in favour of the monarchy has been discovered, with several government officials having gone public with the proof. Riots have spread throughout the country, and syndicalist leader Athanasios Klaras has stepped in to take control. He and numerous army supporters have stormed parliament, arresting government leaders and declaring Nikos Zachariadis as interim President and dictator. While there is some resistance, the rage at the government's actions has made it so that the syndicalists have more support than they would otherwise have enjoyed."

 gre.116.t: "Coup in Greece"
 gre.116.d.metaxas: "With confidence in the Greek government having reached a new low, and riots spreading throughout the country, former General Ioannis Metaxas has stepped in to assume control, seizing the Parliament in Athens and declaring himself dictator. He has also declared Greece to be free of [Root.GetAdjective] rule, vowing to fight any reprisal should it come."
 gre.116.d.syndicalist: "With confidence in the Greek government having reached a new low, and riots spreading throughout the country, syndicalist strongman Athanasios Klaras has stepped in to assume control, seizing the Parliament in Athens and declaring Nikos Zachariadis and the syndicalist communes as the leaders of the new republic. He has also declared Greece to be free of [Root.GetAdjective] rule, vowing to fight any reprisal should it come."
 gre.116.a: "They cannot escape so easily."
 gre.116.b: "We have little choice but to let them be."

 gre.117.t: "The Monarchist Question"
 gre.117.d: "There is no question that the monarchists lost the referendum. It is, however, not the first time - they'll be back eventually, unless we can make sure that this is the last time they'll think of raising the question. Some are suggesting we begin a purge of all remaining or suspected monarchists from the government and army. Others, however, say we should take a softer approach lest our attempt to strengthen the republic weaken it instead."
 gre.117.a: "Purging them is the only way."
 gre.117.b: "Let them remain - the question is settled."

 gre.118.t: "The Republican Question"
 gre.118.d: "There is no question that the republicans lost the referendum. It is, however, not the first time - they'll be back eventually, unless we can make sure that this is the last time they'll think of raising the question. Some are suggesting we begin a purge of all remaining or suspected republicans from the government and army. Others, however, say we should take a softer approach lest our attempt to strengthen the monarchy weaken it instead."
 gre.118.a: "Purging them is the only way."
 gre.118.b: "Let them remain - the question is settled."

 gre.119.t: "Rise of the Agrarians"
 gre.119.d: "With the monarchists now solidly in control of the nation, those who remain loyal to republican values have begun turning away from liberal parties - and instead have turned to the socialist agrarians under the Rural Democratic Front. Their fortunes have been especially buoyed by endorsements from Greek syndicalists, who see gathering together under the agrarian banner as the only way of defeating the monarchists and conservatives now in control of the nation. Rural Democratic Front leaders have been courting the moderate left in recent weeks, and if they succeed then the agrarians will pose a potent force in the upcoming election."
 gre.119.a: "Rather worrying..."
 gre.119.b: "Ban them from the elections."

 gre.120.t: "A Liberal and Socialist Coalition"
 gre.120.d: "While there were fears that the moderate socialists would agree to ally with the hardline agrarians, those fears appear to have been unfounded. Today the National Unionist Party announced a coalition with the Liberal Party, with Georgios Papandreou and Nikolaos Plastiras reportedly having hashed out a deal to form a united cabinet. This will blunt the efforts of the Rural Democratic Front, and possibly poses a threat to the Peoples' Party in the next election."
 gre.120.a: "Interesting."

 gre.121.t: "The Left Unites"
 gre.121.d: "In response to the republican control over [GRE.GetNameDef], parties across the left of the spectrum have united under syndicalist leader Nikos Zachariadis, who intends to run in the upcoming election - and with support from moderate socialists, stands to pose a serious threat. Already there is talk within the government regarding whether the syndicalists should be banned, although their popularity indicates that would instantly throw the nation into civil war if attempted."
 gre.121.a: "They can't win anyhow."
 gre.121.b: "Ban them from the elections."

 gre.122.t: "The Syndicalists Rise Up"
 gre.122.d: "Having been banned from Greek elections, the left has gathered its supporters together in the north and started a campaign to take over [Root.GetNameDef]. The civil war has begun!"
 gre.122.a: "They will regret this."

 gre.150.t: "The First Hellenic Congress"
 gre.150.d: "Syndicalists and trade union leaders from across the country met in Athens this week to discuss the future of [Root.GetNameDef]. Where does it belong in the international socialist community? How will its economy be restructured? What is to be done about the remaining republicans and monarchists who will surely struggle against the new order? In the end, the congress turned into a struggle between two men: the acting chairman, Nikos Zachariadis, and the charismatic general, Athanasios Klaras. Klaras's vision for Greece is much less forgiving, and far more geared towards turning the country into a military power, while Zachariadis argues that path will destroy Greece in the end."
 gre.150.a: "Zachariadis remains in control."
 gre.150.b: "Athanasios Klaras commands the room, in the end."

 gre.151.t: "Establishing the Communes"
 gre.151.d: "While the unions are certainly willing, changing the entire [Root.GetAdjective] economy to a socialist model will be a challenge. Some are suggesting that no mercy be shown - swift industrialisation is a necessary goal of the communes, and anyone who doesn't comply quickly enough should be punished. Others say that a more diplomatic tactic is needed: work with the capitalists and convince them the communes will benefit them, and use incentives to win them over. Still others say it is the unions who should lead the way - bring them more directly into the government, and prove to the country that the communes are a government by the worker."
 gre.151.a: "Expand the industrial base, regardless of the cost."
 gre.151.b: "Ease the country into this, with incentives."
 gre.151.c: "The unions must drive this change - let them take charge."

 gre.152.t: "Rebuilding the Nation"
 gre.152.d: "The capitalists of Greece have been beaten into submission, and now all that remains is to rebuild the country's economy from the ground up. For that, the government is turning to the Dioitikis - the leader - for direction on what should be the main priority moving forward."
 gre.152.a: "We must build our military power."
 gre.152.b: "A strong civilian industry will be our foundation."
 gre.152.c: "Unity is more important than the economy."

 gre.153.t: "Unions March in Thessalia"
 gre.153.d: "The effects of Black Monday are being felt throughout Greece, but the hard-hit industrial workers are now marching in the streets in protest. In Thessalia, the crowds are especially large, spurred on by union leaders as well as the charismatic syndicalist spokesman, Nikos Zachariadis. The syndicalists are gaining a ready audience, and many in the government are suggesting that we crack down on them hard before they have a further chance to spread more sedition."
 gre.153.a: "Crack down on these rabble-rousers."
 gre.153.b: "Keep them contained, but we want no violence."

 gre.154.t: "The Farming Crisis"
 gre.154.d: "A great deal of Greece's economy relies on agricultural exports - and thus, with the collapse of European markets following the onset of Black Monday, a huge number of Greek farmers are left with crops they cannot sell. Not only does this put them in an immediate crisis, Greece will feel the effects for years to come if too many of the communes fold now. Thousands of farmers are marching in the streets, with radical agrarian sentiment running high."
 gre.154.a: "This isn't good..."

 gre.155.t: "The Santos Plot"
 gre.155.d: "Greek leader Athanasios Klaras is many things, but a leader who unites people is not one of them. There has been many conflicts within the government, the most serious one being a growing division between Klaras and party official Georgios Santos. Recently it was revealed that Santos and a cadre of fellows hatched a scheme to have Klaras ousted as leader, though Klaras is unlikely to go quietly..."
 gre.155.a: "Georgios Santos takes over party leadership."
 gre.155.b: "Santos is executed - Athanasios Klaras rules."

 gre.156.t: "The Second Hellenic Congress"
 gre.156.d: "Syndicalists and trade union leaders from across the country met in Athens this week to vote on the chairmanship, with Nikos Zachariadis this time challenged by longtime party member Konstantinos Speras. Speras is said to be a more moderate choice, attracting many of the less radical syndicalists who feel a hard line is no longer necessary in [GRE.GetNameDef]."
 gre.156.a: "Zachariadis ushers in a new cabinet and retains control."
 gre.156.b: "Konstantinos Speras wins the most votes and becomes chairman."

 gre.157.t: "The Third Hellenic Congress"
 gre.157.d.zach: "As the third syndicalist congress begins, Nikos Zachariadis announced that he would not be running again for the chairmanship - a surprise to many, considering how popular the man remains. While many consider the congress a sad farewell to their leader, the delegates now must choose his replacement: either the moderate Konstantinos Speras, running once again, or the new and charismatic upstart, Nikos Beloyannis."
 gre.157.d.notzach: "Syndicalists and trade union leaders from across the country met in Athens this week to vote on the chairmanship, with Konstantinos Speras challenged by young an charismatic upstart Nikos Beloyannis - who has already won over a large number of delegates despite his age."
 gre.157.a: "Konstantinos Speras maintains control."
 gre.157.b: "Konstantinos Speras wins the majority of the vote."
 gre.157.c: "Upstart Nikos Beloyannis wins over the council."

 gre.158.t: "Metaxas Makes his Move"
 gre.158.d: "Refusing to accept the conversion of Greece into a socialist state, Ioannis Metaxas has gathered together a large number of loyal soldiers and generals and started a rebellion in the north. His intention is to forcibly overthrow the government and return it to its 'natural' state."
 gre.158.a: "He must be stopped!"

 gre.200.t: "Diplomatic Overtures from [GRE.GetNameDef]"
 gre.200.d: "While our relations with the Greeks have been cool at best since their rebellion from Turkish rule in the 19th century, today we received several emissaries from [GRE.GetNameDef] who are hopeful to start a new era of peace between our nations - perhaps even going so far as to eventually work out an exchange of land and people, without the need to resort to further war. For today, however, they Greeks are looking for an indication that we might be open to such talks in the future."
 gre.200.a: "We welcome better relations with the Greeks."
 gre.200.b: "No, we've no need for this."

 gre.201.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Agrees"
 gre.201.d: "The [From.GetAdjective] government appears to be open to peaceful discussion with [GRE.GetNameDef], and has indicated a willingness to talk about more cooperation in the future."
 gre.201.a: "That is a relief."

 gre.202.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Has Refused"
 gre.202.d: "The [From.GetAdjective] government has rejected our peaceful emissaries, and appears to have no interest in any further talks with [GRE.GetNameDef]."
 gre.202.a: "So much for diplomacy."

 gre.203.t: "A Treaty with [GRE.GetNameDef]?"
 gre.203.d: "For several weeks now, [Root.GetAdjective] officials have been in talks with emissaries from [GRE.GetNameDef] about the possibility of a treaty of cooperation. This would mean an end to hostilities with the Greeks, and a sorting out of our differences. What the Greeks are asking for is this: we give them any states integral to their country, and they give us ours, while each of us give up any claims to other territories. We also begin an exchange of population, with Turks in [GRE.GetNameDef] coming to [Root.GetNameDef] but our much greater number of Greeks leaving for their country. In exchange, they will sign a pact of non-aggression, and we will do the same. The disruption caused by such a massive displacement of people will be considerable... but perhaps it might be worth it, in the end?"
 gre.203.a: "We agree to their terms."
 gre.203.b: "We agree to everything but surrendering land."
 gre.203.c: "No, they are asking for far too much."

 gre.204.t: "The Turks Refuse to Surrender Land"
 gre.204.d: "After weeks of discussion, the [From.GetAdjective] government has stated it would agree to an exchange of populations between our countries, and also make a pledge of non-aggression... but under no circumstances will they turn over land we believe is rightfully ours. Is it worth agreeing to the rest of the treaty, knowing that our mutual claims could very well lead us back to war in time anyway?"
 gre.204.a: "Then there's no deal."
 gre.204.b: "Very well, we'll work with that."

 gre.205.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Has Refused"
 gre.205.d: "We did our best to conclude the deal, but without agreeing to exchange the territories the Greeks see no point in pursuing a treaty of non-aggression."
 gre.205.a: "So be it!"

 gre.206.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Has Agreed"
 gre.206.d: "The Greeks have agreed to our modified deal. It may mean we'll end up back at each other's throats in time, but for now there will be peace... and once the disruption caused by the exchange of population is over, chances are [Root.GetNameDef] will experience far fewer internal problems caused by their presence."
 gre.206.a: "Excellent."

 gre.207.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Refuses"
 gre.207.d: "After weeks of negotiation, the [From.GetAdjective] government finally ended the talks with [Root.GetNameDef] and no treaty worked out. There were simply too many points of contention that [From.GetNameDef] was unwilling to budge on, and se we leave empty handed."
 gre.207.a: "It was worth the attempt."

 gre.208.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Has Agreed"
 gre.208.d: "After weeks of negotiation, we have come to an agreement with [From.GetNameDef] on a treaty between our nations. A pledge of non-aggression has already been signed, and within a month's time the exchange of populations will begin. This will mean a large number of people coming into [Root.GetNameDef]. We will need to be ready for a great deal of disruption."
 gre.208.a: "We will gladly welcome them home."

 gre.210.t: "The Exchange Begins"
 gre.210.d: "The population exchange between [Root.GetNameDef] and [GRE.GetNameDef] has begun, with thousands of Turks arriving daily... but many more Greeks leaving. The disruption is worse than we imagined, and there is a considerable amount of looting occurring in the homes left behind by the Greeks. Many of the refugees are reportedly starving or becoming ill en route, considering some have no means of transportation other than to walk to [GRE.GetNameDef] on foot or to take ramshackle boats across the Aegean. Authorities are already moving in to try and keep order where they can, and ideally this will sort itself out in time."
 gre.210.a: "It's for the best."
 gre.211.d: "The population exchange between [TUR.GetNameDef] and [GRE.GetNameDef] has begun, with thousands of Turks leaving daily... but many more Greeks arriving. The disruption is worse than we imagined, and there is a considerable amount of looting occurring in the homes left behind by the Turks. Many of the refugees are reportedly starving or becoming ill en route, considering some have no means of transportation other than to walk to [GRE.GetNameDef] on foot or to take ramshackle boats across the Aegean. Authorities are already moving in to try and keep order where they can, and ideally this will sort itself out in time."

 gre.212.t: "Stability Restored"
 gre.212.d: "The population exchange is now a year in the past, and finally the dust appears to have settled and the refugees that returned to [Root.GetNameDef] have acclimated to their new homes."
 gre.212.a: "That's finally over, then?"

 gre.213.t: "Mission from [GRE.GetNameDef]"
 gre.213.d: "The [GRE.GetAdjective] ambassador has been in talks with [Root.GetAdjective] officials over the past several weeks, attempting to foster better relations and more mutual cooperation between our nations. While some in the government are suspicious of their motives, it does appear as if their intentions are nothing more than to foster greater peace in the region."
 gre.213.a: "Yes, let's work more closely with the Greeks."
 gre.213.b: "No, there's no need for this."

 gre.214.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Has Agreed"
 gre.214.d: "After discussions between the [Root.GetAdjective] ambassador and the [From.GetAdjective] government, they have agreed to increase ties between our nations."
 gre.214.a: "Well done!"

 gre.215.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Has Refused"
 gre.215.d: "It appears that suspicions between the nations of the Balkans runs too deeply. The [From.GetAdjective] government listened to our ambassador and made non-committal noises of agreement... but nothing has come of it, and relations between our countries remains unchanged."
 gre.215.a: "Too bad."

 gre.216.t: "Greater Balkans Cooperation"
 gre.216.d: "Our efforts to foster better relations with other countries in the Balkans has paid off - namely with greater investment in [Root.GetNameDef] and greater confidence amongst our citizens that peace will be maintained."
 gre.216.a: "Good to hear."

 gre.250.t: "[GRE.GetNameDefCap] Resurrects Megali Idea"
 gre.250.d: "The Greeks have become increasingly revanchist over the last several months, making motions at resurrecting the 'Megali Idea' which aims at reclaiming ethnically Greek lands - though we note they have restrained themselves from claiming broader territories in Asia Minor, their claims more or less ending at Constantinople. We can warn them to abandon these claims entirely or go along with them, even though it likely means dragging the [Root.GetFactionName] into their war."
 gre.250.d.full: "The Greeks have become increasingly revanchist over the last several months, making motions at resurrecting the 'Megali Idea' which aims at reclaiming ethnically Greek lands - but goes far beyond their traditional territory, including [773.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] and the western coast of Anatolia, which are primarily Turkish. We can warn them to abandon these rash claims entirely or go along with them, even though it likely means dragging the [Root.GetFactionName] into their war."
 gre.250.a: "We support them, no matter what"
 gre.250.b: "This is unacceptable - they either desist or they go"

 gre.251.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Supports Us"
 gre.251.d: "While some were nervous that [From.GetNameDef] would refuse to be dragged into an irredentist war with us, that has not proven to be the case. The [From.GetAdjective] government has declared their support for us, and - as our ally - will be there for whatever war we decide to pursue."
 gre.251.a: "Excellent"

 gre.252.t: "A Warning from [From.GetNameDef]"
 gre.252.d: "The [From.GetAdjective] government has gotten wind of our intention to reclaim ethnically Greek lands in Anatolia, and informed us in no uncertain terms that, if we do not abandon all our claims immediately, we will pursue our wars outside of the [From.GetAdjective] alliance."
 gre.252.a: "Then Megali dies here"
 gre.252.b: "Then we are on our own"

 gre.253.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Leaves the [Root.GetFactionName]"
 gre.253.d.allies: "The [From.GetAdjective] government has decided to abandon the [Root.GetFactionName] and pursue its reckless claims on Greek territory... which includes our own allies. Whether this means war with [From.GetNameDef] remains to be seen."
 gre.253.d.noallies: "Despite our warning, the [From.GetAdjective] government has decided to abandon the [Root.GetFactionName] and pursue its reckless claims on Greek territory."
 gre.253.a: "Good luck with that!"

 gre.254.t: "The Greeks Offer Peace"
 gre.254.d: "We are losing the war with the Greeks - badly. They have contacted the [Root.GetAdjective] government and offered peace, in exchange for all their claimed territories. It is a hard pill to swallow, but the alternative is very likely for us to be crushed completely."
 gre.254.a: "We must make peace while we can"
 gre.254.b: "No - they will have to fight us to the last man"

 gre.255.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Refuses Peace"
 gre.255.d: "It seems the [From.GetAdjective] government wishes to fight us to the last man. They have turned down our offer of terms."
 gre.255.a: "So be it!"

 gre.256.t: "A New Capital?"
 gre.256.d: "Konstantinoúpolis is once again under our control, and a question has now been risen: should the [Root.GetAdjective] capital be moved? For the sake of stability, some are saying it should not... but there are still others who say it is the greatest city in our nation, perhaps the greatest in our history. With the glory of [Root.GetNameDef] having been achieved, perhaps it should be reflected in our seat of government?"
 gre.256.a: "Yes, this is the proper capital of our nation."
 gre.256.b: "No, we remain in Athens as always."

 gre.261.t: "The Extent of Greek Claims"
 gre.261.d.faction: "[GRE.GetNameDefCap] is ready to reclaim our lost territory and rescue our lost brethren. The question at hand is this: do we push our claims eastward, but keep them within 'traditional' Greek lands - [184.GetName] and the islands of the Eastern Mediterranean, such as [183.GetName] - or do we resurrect the Megali Idea and claim everything eastward up to [773.GetName] and the western coast of Anatolia, despite the majority Turkish population in those areas. Megali is an elusive but dangerous dream... if we pursue it, it will be seen as an aggressive move on our part, and we may be kicked out of the [Root.GetFactionName] as a result."
 gre.261.d.nofaction: "[GRE.GetNameDefCap] is ready to reclaim our lost territory and rescue our lost brethren.

Megali is an elusive but dangerous dream... if we pursue it, it will be seen as an aggressive move on our part, one which may make [Root.GetNameDef] a pariah among the world powers."
 gre.261.a: "Keep our claims limited"
 gre.261.b: "We shall resurrect Megali in full!"

 gre.500.t: "Metaxas Overthrows Greek Government"
 gre.500.d: "With Greece having been thrown into massive chaos following their loss in the Balkan War against Bulgaria, and the democratic government refusing to step down, former general Ioannis Metaxas stepped in today with a large group of army supporters and overthrew the government in a planned coup. Fighting in Athens is reported between Metaxas's soldiers and syndicalist groups loyal to Nikos Zachariadis, who Metaxas claims was close to overthrowing the government himself and \"steps were required to maintain order\".\n\nSyndicalists have vowed to fight back against the dictatorship, but for now it appears Metaxas is in full control."
 gre.500.a: "Interesting."

 gre.501.t: "Syndicalists Overthrow Greek Government"
 gre.501.d: "With Greece having been thrown into massive chaos following their loss in the Balkan War against Bulgaria, and the democratic government refusing to step down, syndicalist supporters under leader Nikos Zachariadis today stormed the parliament in Athens and took control. The government's popularity is such that the new syndicalist regime is enjoying far more support than it might have otherwise, though former general Ioannis Metaxas has vowed to \"restore order\" in the country by removing the \"syndicalist threat\".\n\nWhile Zachariadis is currently in control, fears are that a new civil war is inevitable."
 gre.501.a: "Interesting."

 gre.502.t: "Greek Army Overthrows Government"
 gre.502.d: "With Greece having been thrown into massive chaos following their loss in the Balkan War against Bulgaria, and the democratic government refusing to step down, the Greek army today stepped in and overthrew the government in a coup. General Alexandros Papagos said in a statement that the measure was temporary, and that new elections would be held as soon as the army restored order in the face of increased syndicalist insurgency.\n\nWhether Papagos will relinquish power as he claims remains to be seen, and syndicalist leaders have sworn to fight this \"new dictatorship\" with every means at their disposal, raising fears of a new civil war."
 gre.502.a: "Interesting."

 gre.503.t: "Rural Democratic Front Victorious in Greece"
 gre.503.d: "The restoration of the monarchy in Greece caused the country's leftist leaders to consolidate under the umbrella of the Rural Democratic Front, a party which has now seen victory in the country's recent elections under [GRE.GetLeader].\n\nMany within the government had called on the party to be banned, a call which had been refused, and so now Greece faces a transformation into a socialist dictatorship with a mandate from the angry Greek electorate. Even so, portions of the military are already gathering in opposition to the new government, and there are fears that a new civil war will break out in Greece as a result."
 gre.503.a: "Interesting."

 gre.504.t: "Syndicalists Victorious in Greek Elections"
 gre.504.d: "The victory of the republicans in Greece caused the country's leftist leaders to consolidate under the umbrella of the Social Workers' Party of Greece, a party which has now seen victory in the country's recent elections under [GRE.GetLeader].\n\nMany within the government had called on the party to be banned, a call which had been refused, and so now Greece faces a transformation into a syndicalist dictatorship with a mandate from the angry Greek electorate. Even so, portions of the military are already gathering in opposition to the new government, and there are fears that a new civil war will break out in Greece as a result."
 gre.504.a: "Interesting."

 gre.505.t: "Metaxas Overthrows Greek Government"
 gre.505.d: "The recent revelations in Greece that the government had rigged the referendum to produce a positive result for republicans has shaken the nation, to the point where former general Ioannis Metaxas has stepped in to take control.\n\nWith the support of a large number of generals in the army, Metaxas declared that the former government leaders had been arrested and that he would see the nation restored to its 'proper path'. Syndicalists leaders have already declared the Metaxas regime an opportunistic act, and have sworn to take action again him and his new government."
 gre.505.a: "Interesting."

 gre.506.t: "Syndicalists Overthrow Greek Government"
 gre.506.d: "The recent revelations in Greece that the government had rigged the referendum to produce a positive result for the monarchists has shaken the nation, to the point where syndicalist leader Nikos Zachariadis has stepped in to take control.\n\nWith the support of a large number of militia leaders, Zachariadis declared that the former government leaders had been arrested and that he would see the nation restored to its \"proper path\". Former general Ioannis Metaxas has already declared the new regime invalid, and has taken to the countryside with several loyalist generals to raise opposition, making a new civil war appear almost certain."
 gre.506.a: "Interesting."

 gre.507.t: "Syndicalists Win Greek Civil War"
 gre.507.d: "After months of fighting, syndicalist forces under Greek leader Nikos Zachariadis today took control of Athens and declared victory in the civil war. Zachariadis announced that a temporary government would be put in place until a proper congress of Greek trade unions and workers could be assembled to decide the nation's future.\n\nWhile fighting is still ongoing in many parts of Greece, it appears that the direction of the country's future has finally been settled."
 gre.507.a: "Interesting."

 gre.508.t: "Metaxas Wins Greek Civil War"
 gre.508.d: "After months of fighting, forces under former general Ioannis Metaxas today took control of Athens and declared victory in Greece's civil war. Metaxas announced that a temporary government under his control would be put in place until a tribunal could be assembled to decide the nation's future.\n\nWhile fighting is still ongoing in many parts of Greece, it appears that the direction of the country's future has finally been settled."
 gre.508.a: "Interesting."

 gre.509.t: "Republicans Win Greek Referendum"
 gre.509.d: "The recent referendum on the future of the Greek monarchy has finally ended, with republicans declaring victory. Greek Prime Minister [GRE.GetLeader] announced that King Alexander would not be invited back from exile, and that the country would remain a republic as per the wishes of the public.\n\nThe referendum caused deep divisions in Greece, and while the matter of the monarchy may be settled, it will still be an uphill battle for the government to heal those divisions in the years to come."
 gre.509.a: "Interesting."

 gre.510.t: "Monarchy Restored in Greece"
 gre.510.d: "After weeks of deliberation, the Greek government has decided to return the crown to King Aléxandros I - who was exiled in 1923 following the establishment of the Third Republic. While many consider Aléxandros unpopular due to the part he played in the surrendering of the economy to Germany and Austria following the first Weltkrieg, it was felt he was still the most legitimate ruler.\n\nThe king spoke to a massive, cheering crowd in Athens after returning for the first time in many years, saying that Greece had 'finally returned to the path it was meant to be on', and vowed to work with the country's leaders to forge a positive future."
 gre.510.a: "Interesting."

 gre.511.t: "Monarchy Restored in Greece"
 gre.511.d: "After weeks of deliberation, the Greek government has decided to give the crown to King Geórgios II - not to Aléxandros I, who is still alive, but who many feel should have always been the proper heir as Aléxandros's older brother... and who never received the crown in the first place due to his exile following the Weltkrieg. While there are lingering doubts as to his legitimacy, the government has assured the people that this fixes an error which had been made long before.\n\nThe king spoke to a massive, cheering crowd in Athens after returning for the first time in many years, saying that Greece had 'finally returned to the path it was meant to be on', and vowed to work tirelessly to rebuild the country."
 gre.511.a: "Interesting."

 gre.512.t: "Monarchy Restored in Greece"
 gre.512.d: "The Greek government today announced it would be restoring the monarchy, forgoing the referendum that originally restored the kingdom in 1920 prior to its overthrow in 1923. Rather than restore the crown to Aléxandros I, however, it has instead passed the crown to his younger brother, Pávlos I. The new king, it is said, has much more radical and authoritarian ideas learned during his exile which are more in line with the new Greek government, though the rest of the royal family will be returning to Greece along with him.\n\nThe king spoke to a massive, cheering crowd in Athens after returning for the first time in many years, saying that Greece had 'finally returned to the path it was meant to be on', and vowed to work tirelessly to rebuild the country."
 gre.512.a: "Interesting."
