### Events ###
 yucatan.1.t: "The Yucatan Constitution"
 yucatan.1.d: "In Mérida, the new Yucatan Constitution was signed. While it was modelled on the 1917 Mexican Constitution, it also included quite a bit of Mayan legal code as well. Moreover it is also a compromise between the various factions within the Yucatec government."
 yucatan.1.a: "Viva Libre Yucatan!"

 yucatan.2.t: "The Land Issue"
 yucatan.2.d: "The issue of Land reform has been brought up and the question is how should we handle the land reform. Some suggest supporting small land owners, while others think we should implement the Georgist idea of a land tax, or collectivising the land what should we do?"
 yucatan.2.a: "Collectivise the land."
 yucatan.2.b: "Implement Georgism."
 yucatan.2.c: "Support small land owners."

 yucatan.3.t: "Dealing with Mexican Spies"
 yucatan.3.d: "We have recently caught a number of Mexican Spies that are trying to infiltrate our government. The question is what should we do with them. Some think we should deport them. Others think that we should just execute them while finally some think we should try to turn them to our side."
 yucatan.3.a: "Execute them."
 yucatan.3.b: "Deport them."
 yucatan.3.c: "Try to turn them."

 yucatan.20.t: "Election of [GetYear]"

 yucatan.20.e: "Partido Socialista de Yucatán."

 yucatan.25.t: "Mexican Spies Discovered!"

 yucatan.25.a: "Terrible!"

 yucatan.26.t: "Influencing Yucatan?"
 yucatan.26.d: "To our north, the Yucatecs have revolted from Mexican rule successfully and are now establishing a government. There are currently many in our nation that seek to reestablish contact with their ethnic Maya brethren in Yucatan. If we used this opportunity to influence Yucatan's politics towards a socialist alignment, we could possibly gain a strong ally to the north."
 yucatan.26.a: "Go for it."
 yucatan.26.b: "It's too much effort."

 yucatan.27.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Influences Our Politics!"
 yucatan.27.d: "The Guatemalan migrants entering our nation have brought more with them than welcome manpower and economic activity - they have also brought radical socialist ideologies with them! We are powerless to stop this trend, as the border to our south is far too porous, and the migrants too valuable, to guard properly."
 yucatan.27.a: "Damn them!"

 yucatan.28.t: "[FROM.GetName] Asks to Join [ROOT.GetNameDef]"
 yucatan.28.d: "The socialists in our sister republic of [FROM.GetName] have long watched our progress as we reform Central America into a socialist paradise. Now, it seems, they are prepared to join our nation as another component republic. Should we allow this long-awaited unification to happen?"
 yucatan.28.a: "Of course!"
 yucatan.28.b: "We don't want Mexican outcasts!"

 yucatan.29.t: "Centroamérica Agrees!"
 yucatan.29.d: "Our southern neighbours have agreed to our request to accede to their nation. We shall have a glorious future as part of a greater Central America."
