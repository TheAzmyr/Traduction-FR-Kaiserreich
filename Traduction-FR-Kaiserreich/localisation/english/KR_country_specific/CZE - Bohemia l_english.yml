 CZE_alois_podhajsky_army_chief_desc: "§YBorn:§! §LFebruary 18th, 1864, in Blatná, Kingdom of Bohemia, Austrian Empire§!\n§YBackground:§! §LSon of a gendarmerie sergeant, Alois Podhajsky graduated from the Pressburg Infantry Cadet School in 1884, becoming a lieutenant in 1897. From 1890 to 1892, he attended the Kriegsschule in Vienna to become a staff officer. By 1910, he was a colonel, promoted to Major General at the very start of the Weltkrieg.\nFor most of the war, Podhajsky commanded the 21st Landwehr Infantry Division, consisting of a majority of Czech troops, initially in Serbia, then Galicia, and Italy for the latter phase of the war. He proved an able commander, receiving the Order of the Iron Crown and Military Merit Cross in 1915, and the Iron Cross First Class the next year. By the end of the war, he was but one of many loyal Czechs serving in the Austro-Hungarian general staff, promoted to Lieutenant Field Marshal in 1917.\nWhile the Czechoslovak National Council in exile consider him one of the archetypical \"rakušák\" (Austrian; a derogatory term for Czechs in the Austro-Hungarian Army), he remained steadfast in his shared loyalty to his people and Monarch. After the war, Podhajsky was one of the energetic organisers and leaders of the re-formed Bohemian Landwehr during the first wave of reforms in Cisleithania (the Austrian half of the Empire). Towards the end of the interwar, he was one of the few remaining Czech officers that held a general rank during the Weltkrieg left in active service. While enthusiasm among Czechs for military service remains low, he is still a lasting presence and symbol of the \"rakušák\", he maintains his faith in the Monarchy and that the esteemed Emperor will continue to follow the path of reform and reconciliation for the betterment of the Czech nation.§!"

 CZE_josef_bily: "Josef Bílý"
 CZE_josef_bily_high_command_desc: "§YBorn:§! §LJune 30th, 1872, in Zbonín, Kingdom of Bohemia, Austria-Hungary§!\n§YBackground:§! §LGraduating from the Trieste Infantry Cadet School, Bílý entered the Austro-Hungarian Army in 1892 as a lieutenant in the 15th Infantry Regiment in Galicia. In 1898, he attended a staff officer course at the Kriegsschule in Vienna, graduating two years later before being assigned to the 4th Infantry Division. He then taught tactics at the Vienna Infantry Cadet School for two years in 1908-1910.\nAt the start of the Weltkrieg, Bílý was a battalion commander, participating in the bloody fighting against the Russians until July 1915, when he was heavily wounded. Once recovered, he served in the Lublin General-Government for half a year before taking command of an assault battalion in Tyrol. Now lieutenant-colonel in 1917, he took command of a special group that fought successfully on the Asiago Plateau, distinguishing itself at Monte Grappa and the final offensive of the war against the Italians. Bílý would end the war as a respected colonel.\nAfter the war, Bílý took part in the re-formation of the Bohemian Landwehr and would be promoted to major general. In 1924, he completed a course at the Theresian Military Academy and was further promoted to Lieutenant Field Marshal in 1928. As of 1936, after 48 years of service, Bílý is the second-highest ranking Czech in the Austro-Hungarian Army, making him one of the prominent \"rakušák\" (Austrian; a derogatory term for Czechs in the Austro-Hungarian Army), although his loyalty to both Crown and the Czech nation are only doubted by the most chauvinistic Germans and Czechs respectively.§!"

 CZE_josef_votruba: "Josef Votruba"
 CZE_josef_votruba_commander_desc: "§YBorn:§! §LNovember 8th, 1879, in Debř, Kingdom of Bohemia, Austria-Hungary§!\n§YBackground:§! §LGraduating with top marks from the prestigious Vienna Cadet School, Votruba began his military career in 1899 and quickly made an impression on his superiors. In 1908, he graduated from the Vienna Kriegsschule, once again with top marks and exemplary behaviour, and was made a staff officer while still a lieutenant.\nWhen the Weltkrieg began, he was part of the operational department of the 1st Army before being transferred to the 12th Infantry Division on the Galician Front. After 1915, he was part of the staff of the 58th Infantry Division, at the time fighting alongside the Bulgarians before being rushed to the Italian Front, where he would remain until 1918. During his service on the Italian Front, he distinguished himself as an uncompromising and demanding leader, earning him the scorn of his subordinates as he refused to tolerate what he perceived as laziness or incompetence, but also respect and admiration for his deep knowledge and unquestionable skill. He would be highly decorated: The Military Merit Cross in 1915, with the Iron Cross and the Order of the Iron Crown the next year. After serving against the Italians for almost three years, Votruba transferred to the War Ministry in Vienna, but quickly grew restless there and requested to be returned to a staff position closer to the front. It wouldn't be until the armistice with Italy that he would agree to work at the War Ministry.\nOnce the war ended, Votruba stayed in the Austro-Hungarian Army and, after studying at the Theresian Military Academy, would be made a general in 1928. After that, he quickly rose even further up the ranks, becoming Lieutenant Field Marshal the next year and would become General of Infantry later in 1936. As of that year, Votruba is one of the most prominent \"rakušák\" (Austrian; a derogatory term for Czechs in the Austro-Hungarian Army), and arguably the most skilled Czech generals in service. However, his health is rapidly deteriorating from severe diabetes, even if his mind is as sharp as ever.§!"

 CZE_bohuslav_kohout: "Bohuslav Kohout"
 CZE_bohuslav_kohout_high_command_desc: "§YBorn:§! §LDecember 5th, 1896, in Litomyšl, Kingdom of Bohemia, Austria-Hungary§!\n§YBackground:§! §LBohuslav Kohout was not intending for a military career until the sudden death of his father in 1910. Before being admitted to the Prague Infantry Cadet School two years after the event, he had been an enthusiastic promoter of the scouting movement in the Czech lands. It wouldn't be until March 1915 that Kohout graduated from the Cadet School and became an infantry platoon commander in June as part of the 20th Landwehr Infantry Regiment fighting in Galicia.\nIn 1916, he was sent to the Italian front as a machine gun platoon commander, then back to the Russian front the year after. In 1918, he transferred to the dragoons, promoted to Rittmeister (cavalry captain) the following year as he proved his skills from his days in the scouting movement. After the war, he stayed in the army, taking part in the re-formation of the Bohemian Landwehr and its cavalry component, and was soon sent to the Kriegsschule in Vienna to gain staff training. In 1925, he was made Major and became heavily involved in the Military Technical Committee of the War Ministry in the imperial capital.\nBy 1931, he was made colonel and began work on a modern handbook for soldiers. In 1933, it was published as "Handbook for Soldiers", originally intended for the Bohemian Landwehr, it was quickly translated, at his own request, into German and Hungarian, and would soon supersede older pre-war handbooks. Unlike the old handbooks, Kohout not only intended to improve the more practical aspects of everyday soldiering, but, being deeply influenced by values and his experiences in the scouting movement, also focused on morale and behaviour. This made the handbook distinct from similar pre-war manuals along with Kohout's intent to reach other ethnicities, hoping to ease ethnic tensions within the Bohemian Landwehr and create a more cohesive force. The work also caught the attention of reformists keen to eliminate the old chauvinistic attitudes rampant among the old guard of the Army and breathe new life into the institution as a multiethnic one. While only a colonel and with experience only leading small units during the war, Handbook for Soldiers is proving to be highly influential, promising to propel Kohout's career to new heights.\n\n\"Find a second German or a Hungarian and learn from them! And teach them too!\"§!"

In 1900, he retired from active service and became part of the reserve, only to rejoin two years later as a repair officer.\nBy 1914, when the Weltkrieg began, he was head of the personnel department of the Prague military district before moving to the planning department. By then, he was already an informant for the Maffie resistance group, but this association never went further and barely hurt his career once Karl ascended the throne. By 1918, he had reached the rank of lieutenant colonel before being finally transferred from the Prague district to the Armee-Oberkommando (Army High Command) in Vienna. In 1920, he was part of the AOK's cavalry department and was promoted to colonel, then major general after the war.\nWhile a respected staff officer, his lack of field command during the Weltkrieg makes him a general with little actual experience, and his ties with Czech nationalist organisations makes him distrusted among many German officers and largely forces him to stay within the Bohemian Landwehr.§!"
