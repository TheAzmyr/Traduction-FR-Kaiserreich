### Characters ###
 VCR_belisario_augusto_de_oliveira_penna: "Belisário Augusto de Oliveira Penna"
 VCR_belisario_augusto_de_oliveira_penna_leader_desc: "§YBorn:§! §LNovember 29th, 1868, in Barbacena, Minas Gerais, Empire of Brazil§!\n§YBackground:§! §LBelisário Augusto de Oliveira Penna began his political career as a city councillor in Juiz de Fora, and only in the 1920s he projected himself outside of his home state, positioning himself in favour of right wing tenentist uprisings. For most of his life, he was a doctor and has a belief in scientific principles being applied to politics and governments. While a supporter of radical integralism, he often found himself marginalised even among that radical movement due to his beliefs regarding eugenics, a concept which he pioneered in Brazil, and he was for many years a member of the Central Eugenics Committee. These viewpoints have also granted him many allies and admirers that share similar beliefs, and now he and his associates are in a prime position to apply their ideas as practical principle, to ensure the great cities of the land like Rio are finally cleansed of its poverty and superstition that hide under the guise of 'local culture'. Belisário is also a supporter of utilising political prisoners as a workforce, a controversial and divisive viewpoint even among the right winger clique that now form his cabinet.§!"
