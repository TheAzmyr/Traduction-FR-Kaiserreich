### Events ###
 nzl.10.t: "A Call for Peace?"
 nzl.10.d: "It has been many months since the war with the Australians began, and they are no closer to winning. This is a war that will go nowhere, and thus a suggestion has been raised that we should seek a white peace. Our preference would be to restore democracy in [AST.GetNameDef], but if we must we will be satisfied with democracy and safety here at home."
 nzl.10.a: "It is time to call for a truce"
 nzl.10.b: "No! We will continue this war until it is finished!"

 nzl.11.t: "Peace with New Zealand?"
 nzl.11.d: "A peace envoy has arrived from the [From.GetAdjective] government, offering an end to hostilities. If we leave them be, they will forego their attempts to topple our government, and this conflict can come to an end... a conflict which, it seems, has been going nowhere for months now. This does, however, mean relinquishing any efforts to reclaim New Zealand, at least for the time being."
 nzl.11.a: "Yes, let us end this now"
 nzl.11.b: "No! We will continue this war until it is finished!"

 nzl.12.t: "No Peace with [From.GetNameDef]"
 nzl.12.d: "Our envoys have returned from [From.GetNameDef] with a definitive response: there will be no peace."
 nzl.12.a: "Ah well."

 nzl.14.t: "Help from the Entente?"
 nzl.14.d: "Now that war with [AST.GetNameDef] has come, we must consider whether it's time to turn to the Entente for assistance. If we rejoin the Empire, it means once again becoming part of all their future wars across the ocean... but do we truly have any other choice?"
 nzl.14.a: "We desperately need their help!"
 nzl.14.b: "No, we will make it on our own."

 nzl.15.t: "New Zealand Calls for Help"
 nzl.15.d: "Aided by the New Guard rebels, New Zealand has separated from [AST.GetNameDef] and called upon the crown for aid. Shall we accept them into the alliance and step up to their defence, even if it means waging war across the Pacific?"
 nzl.15.a: "Yes, of course we'll help them!"
 nzl.15.b: "No, we cannot afford to become embroiled in another war."

 nzl.16.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Refuses Aid"
 nzl.16.d: "Much to our surprise, representatives from [From.GetNameDef] have informed us that [Root.GetNameDef] is on its own. They cannot, it appears, commit to a war across the Pacific, even for the sake of retaking Australia."
 nzl.16.a: "So much for that idea."

 nzl.20.t: "A Governor-General for New Zealand?"
 nzl.20.d: "Now that we have rejoined the Empire, the New Zealand government is considering whether to request a governor-general be appointed - as befits a proper member of the British Empire."
 nzl.20.a: "Cyril Newall, 1st Baron Newall, is just the man for the job."
 nzl.20.b: "Bernard Freyberg is a military man, and needed for the post."
 nzl.20.c: "No, we've no need for such frippery."

 nzl.21.t: "A Return to Democracy?"
 nzl.21.d: "With the end of the war, the question has been turned to Military Governor Freyberg as to whether the government should be returned to the control of the New Zealand people. Some members of the government say that the crisis is far from over, though most agree that the time has come for the military to step down. New Zealand is, after all, a democratic nation and it will not accept authoritarian rule for long."
 nzl.21.a: "Yes, schedule elections to be held immediately."
 nzl.21.b: "No, the military will remain in control."

 nzl.22.t: "The First Free Elections"
 nzl.22.d: "Military Governor Bernard Freyberg has opted to allow free elections in New Zealand, the first the nation has seen in some time. The Labour Party appears most likely to obtain a majority, although the possibility remains that anti-syndicalist sentiment will yet see the Nationalist Party obtain power. Still, there is the lingering chance of the New Zealand Legion's campaign to stir up nationalistic support seeing success."
 nzl.22.a: "The Labour Party wins the election handily."
 nzl.22.b: "The National Party manages to secure a minority government."
 nzl.22.c: "The people turn to the Legion to protect them."
