### Parties ###
 POR_totalist_party: "PCP (Rates)"
 POR_totalist_party_long: "Partido Comunista Português (Rates)\n§gFollowing his expulsion in 1926, following a refusal to collaborate with the Syndicalist-dominated CGT, former General Secretary José Carlos Rates has created his own splinter organisation still standing firm on an opposition of anarchist collaboration. Still holding influence over an older contingent of Communists, Rates has grown inspired by the revisionist, nationalistic Totalist school of thought during his time in France. If he were to take back control of the Party, Rates would likely take his revenge against the ascendant left-wing that ousted him and implement a technocratic, socialist system to safeguard the revolution from within and without.§!\n"
 POR_syndicalist_party: "CUFU (CGT/FAP)"
 POR_syndicalist_party_long: "Comité de Unidade de Frente Única\n§gFormed with José de Sousa's alliance between the Communists and Trade Unions, the United Front Committee of Unions currently exists as a grouping of socialists, imprisoned and exiled in Paris following the failed 1930 General Strike. The General Confederation of Labour and the Portuguse Anarchist Federation are two interlinked factions, making up the Syndicalist bulwark of the United Front. The CGT is nominally led by founder Manuel Joaquim de Sousa from prison, who is represented by José da Silva Santos Arranha in Paris. The CGT is considered to be the most militant revolutionary group within Portugal, and has subsequently faced the most repression from Lisbon. The Portuguse Anarchist Federation is a wing of the Iberian Anarchist Federation, forming another political front for the CGT. Though de Sousa is a supporter of Pan-Iberian Unity, many within the CGT are at best sceptical, or at worst outwardly hostile to this position.§!\n"
 POR_radical_socialist_party: "CUFU (PCP/FAO)"
 POR_radical_socialist_party_long: "Comité de Unidade de Frente Única\n§gFormed with José de Sousa's alliance between the Communists and Trade Unions, the United Front Committee of Unions currently exists as a grouping of socialists, imprisoned and exiled in Paris following the failed 1930 General Strike. The Portuguse Communist Party has struggled since the Restoration. Under the leadership of Bento António Gonçalves, they've operated on a policy of cooperation with the Anarchists and Syndicalists, a departure from the hostitly towards them under José Carlos Rates. By following a line of pragmatism towards the revolution, the Communists hope that the United Front strategy will bare fruit in time. The Federação Socialista das Associações de Trabalhadores (Socialist Federation of Workers' Associations) represents the moderate socialist trade unionists under the United Front, who maintain a presense within Portugal due to the lack of radical actions undertaken by them. Their small size has relegated them to an intermediary role between the CGT and the PCP.§!\n"
 POR_social_democrat_party: "PRED"
 POR_social_democrat_party_long: "Partido Republicano da Esquerda Democrática\n§gThe Democratic Leftwing Republican Party is a marxist, democratic-socialist party that formed in 1924, having split from Democratic Party following an ideological dispute with Afonso Costa. Leader José Domingues dos Santos has built the PRED around 'Moderação', an attempt to find a third way between the revolutionary syndicalism espoused by the Third Internationale, and the progressive liberalism of the Democrats. The failure of the 1930 General Strike has seen the PRED gain a small amount of steam among more radical minded exiles, though the CUFU still regards them with intense suspicion.§!\n"
 POR_social_liberal_party: "PRP"
 POR_social_liberal_party_long: "Partido Republicano Português\n§gThe Democratic Party, offically called the Portuguese Republican Party, is a centre-left, progressive party which is the self-proclaimed successor to the original Republican Party which led the 1910 republican revolution. Formed in February 1912 by Afonso Costa after the old Republican Party splintered, the Democrats were the politically dominant movement (with somewhat authoritarian tendancies) for much of the Republic's existence, until Sidonio Pais cemented his power in 1917 after which they acted as the main opposition to the conservative military dictatorship. After the restoration of the monarchy, Costa led his followers into exile and the party can be tied to almost every insurrectionist attempt to overthrow the monarchy since. Following Costa's retirement in 1931, the Democrats have been locked in a factional struggle between the populist lieutenant-colonel Liberato Pinto, who wants to reform the big-tent Democratic Party of old, and Costa's former deputy António Maria da Silva, a detail-orentated politician focused on consolidating the parties current ideology.§!\n"
 POR_market_liberal_party: "URN (Liberais)"
 POR_market_liberal_party_long: "União Republicana Nacionalista\n§gThe Nationalist Republican Union, colloquially referred to as the Nationalists, is a liberal-conservative party, formed in exile in February 1923, as a merger of the Republican Liberal Party, the Reconstitution Party and the remnants of the National Republican Party. The Nationalists were created to provide a stronger base to stand against the restored Monarchy, uniting the right-wing republicans under one banner. Their views are mixed, representing a wide range of interests and ideals, with their main unifying ideology being one of \"Anti-Democrático\", or strong opposition to the Democratic Party. The Nationalists are not led by one particular man, but rather have collective leadership with a variety centre-right & right-wing politicians. The \"Liberals\" are a classical-liberal faction made up predominantly of former Republican Liberal and Reconstitution Party members, chiefly led by the charismatic António Granjo. The Liberals champion economic liberalisation above anything else, supporting a grand opening of trade to the wider world. Granjo's charismatic influence has ensured the Liberals are generally the dominant faction.§!\n"

The \"Unionists\" are a socially-conservative faction, led by Francisco da Cunha Leal and made up predominantly of former \"Sidonistas\" and Catholic republicans. The Unionists support culturally conservative ventures, being the most clerically friendly of any Republican group. Under Cunha Leal's influence, they've also support a broad review of Portugal's colonial ventures.§!\n"
 POR_authoritarian_democrat_party: "PCC"
 POR_authoritarian_democrat_party_long: "Partido do Centro Católico\n§gThe Catholic Centre Party formed in January 1915, with the initial goal of representing Catholic interests in the anti-clerical Republic. Not explicitly monarchist at first, that anti-clericalism naturally drew the Catholics into opposition. When the Republic began to collapse, the Catholic Centre withdrew their support, with some key members turning to royalist militancy themselves. Following the Restoration, the Catholic Centre was the largest formal political party in the Royal Congress. Amid the disastrous year of 1925, the 'Centrists' reconciled with the Integralists following Hipólito Raposo's more pragmatic stance on political cooperation. Backing the coup in 1926, the Catholics now dominate the Chamber of Peers and have come to support a German-style semi-constitutional monarchy. Since a factional dispute in 1920, ardent monarchist and integralist sympathiser José Fernando de Sousa has led the party, though his advancing age has led a younger caucus of members around Professor António Salazar to gain prominence.§!\n"
 POR_paternal_autocrat_party: "CCM"
 POR_paternal_autocrat_party_long: "Conselho de Causa Monárquica\n§gAn umbrella of many royalists, the Council of the Monarchist Cause represents the shaky \"Monarchist Cause\" coalition-party that ruled Portugal during the government of Henrique de Paiva Couceiro of 1921-1926, and was initially formed in 1911 to pursue a restoration of the Monarchy. When the then-political party was banned following the March 17th Coup, the members of the Cause were politically isolated from King Manuel II and forced to be mere spectators of the Organic Experiment. With the coronation of Duarte II however, the royalist coalition would have a new opportunity to reassert themselves within Portugal. Though the Monarchist Cause's official purpose is the continued protection and strengthening of monarchist institutions, their secretive aim is a 'National Restoration' to empower the Monarch and form a conservative personalist dictatorship around them, whilst culling the various excesses of the ultra-radical Integralist regime. The Council's principle leaders are Marshal Couceiro and Domingos Fezas Vital, Lieutenant of the King.§!\n"
 POR_national_populist_party: "IL"
 POR_national_populist_party_long: "Integralismo Lusitano\n§gThe Lusitanian Integralist movement was born at the University of Coimbra in 1911, though the group wasn't founded until 1914. The group quickly became known as a counter-culture movement to the Republic, espousing an highly reactionary, traditionalist and elitist outlook on politics. Extremely anti-liberal and ultra-monarchist, the Integralists fought against the Democrats and the Republican system, though Integralist politicians cooperated with the Sidonist 'New Republic' dictatorship. As the restoration began, the Integralists were one of the most influential factions of the counter-revolutionaries. However, after the restoration, the Integralist's stagnated; viewed as dangerous by Couceiro, they were politically sidelined. Antonio Sardinha's sudden death threatened to collapse the organisation, but Hipólito Raposo rationalised the groups erosteric, often contradictory ideology and reconciled with other political groups, chiefly the Catholic Centre. After the disastrious year of 1925, the Integralists were able to lead a largely bloodless coup against the Causa Monárquica and swiftly consolidate power. Ever since, Raposo has put the Integralist's more radical ambitions on hold, which has led to discontent within the Central Junta.§!\n"

 POR_raiders_desc: "For many centuries, Portugal had kept the Infidels near the Indian Ocean under control by using its tactical and naval expertise. Yet again, that shall be the primary goal of our new naval plans. Ensuring that we can raid, harass, and starve the large empires of our time."
 POR_raiding_squads: "Planning for Asymmetrical Warfare"
 POR_raiding_squads_desc: "Planning a war against the world's biggest navy is not, by any means, an easily accomplished task. It will require much effort and calculation with our allies, admirals, and seamen. However, the tactics we use to deal with the War at Sea will certainly be crucial."
 POR_submarines: "Hunting Teams"
 POR_submarines_desc: "One of the most crucial aspects of a raiding navy is operational autonomy and cooperation between the ships within the fleet.

 POR_reward_loyalty_desc: "We often see the true mettle of a vassal when his liege is on the edge of a knife. Risking everything, many who could have been complacent fought for us. Some out of genuine loyalty, others for the thrill of battle, and some simply to prevent the alternative: being ruled by the Butcher of Mahenge, who sees all non-Germans as little more than beasts of Burden. All will have their loyalty rewarded!"

 POR_macau: "Protect and Develop Macau"
 POR_macau_desc: "Macau is a crown jewel of the empire, envied by the Chinese because of its prosperity. However, it is also very far away from the Portugal. This means that, in the case of an attack, the province would have to hold on without support. To make matters worse, the government's hold on the province is also very poor. In light of this information, we must prepare initiatives to defend and develop Macau."

 POR_KR_gathering_storm_desc: "The Weltkrieg was a farce that the young Republic of Portugal did not survive. After a short civil war, the Kingdom was restored, and despite the best efforts of bitter Republican exiles it has consolidated. With the sudden death of Manuel II in 1932, a young king with questionable legitimacy rose to the throne. King Duarte is a man of great ambition but lacks in both political tact and allies, and finds himself increasingly at odds with the radical reactionary Integralists who seek to totally transform the nation in their image. A showdown between King and Country is coming, but will young Duarte be humbled or succeed in his gambit?"

 POR_country_intro_header: "The Kingdom of Portugal"
 POR_country_intro_content: "After the disaster in the Weltkrieg, and the collapse of our forces in Mozambique and France, Portugal's usurper republic simply lacked the face and the military support to resist the Glorious Restoration. It brought Manuel II back to the throne, and his once rival claimant Duarte Nuno as his heir. The restoration, which occurred shortly after the war's end, saw the beginning of the economic recovery.\n\nHowever, reliance on British imports and exports was too great for Portugal to properly weather the storm of 1925. We were unable to even unite our lands after the fall of the British Empire, for Germany, in an act of aggression, seized those lands. With such an extensive political crisis on his hands, the then Prime Minister Paiva Couceiro called for elections; the victorious Integralists have an extensive reform agenda, while viciously anti-republican policies have polarised opinions even amongst the most staunch monarchists. However, they defer to the King for now, and they claim that they will do so indefinitely.\n\nSpain's sickness seems to never end, as more chaos looms in the world and threatens Portugal. In Africa, [MAF.GetLeader] and his Hunnic goons sabotage our endeavours, forcing our hand to return the favour, and tensions are fast escalating. But no matter what may come, we trust that Portugal will stand tall."

### Events ###
 por.300.t: "The Colonial Exposition of [GetYear]"
 por.300.d: "Thousands have gathered for Portugal's first large scale Colonial Exposition. While the Kingdom's restoration, and other trials and tribulations it has been forced to endure, have challenged it, Portugal did not shy away from its civilising burden and redoubled its efforts to improve the Ultramarine Provinces, which are as essential as Porto or Lisbon. Many wonders and trinkets from all over the world have been brought to Lisbon for the occasion, including an entire Angolan village as an anthropological curiosity. While the endeavour was expensive, it reinforces our commitment to the Colonial Cause."
 por.300.a: "Grand!"

 por.301.t: "Black Monday Hits Portugal"
 por.301.d: "While economic ties between us and Germany have never been as large or interconnected as with other European nations, the cascade effect of the Black Monday Crisis has hit Portugal with great force. With an economy mostly based on agricultural exports, and most industries focused on the rearmament plan, our usual consumers cannot afford our products and, thus, Portugal's economic situation is, yet again, in dire straits. Let us hope that we've learnt much from the lessons of the '26 Crisis and that we can, hopefully, recover much quicker this time."
 por.301.a: "This spells trouble!"

 por.302.t: "The Coronation of Maria Ana I"
 por.302.d: "As the old monarch was deemed unfit to rule and was forced into abdication, Maria Anna of Braganza has been crowned as Maria Ana I, and was recognised as such by the Chamber of Most Worthy Peers. Hopefully, her ascension will bring lasting peace to Portugal."
 por.302.a: "Long Live the Queen!"

 por.303.t: "The Coronation of Maria Adelaide as Maria III"
 por.303.d: "With the passing of Duarte II, who remained childless for the duration of his life, the question of succession had the chance of devolving into a contentious affair. However, his youngest sister, Maria Adelaide, was almost unanimously agreed as the best fit for the next Queen of Portugal by both the upper and lower houses for, despite her young age, she always was the Princess of the people. Long may Maria III reign, hopefully under peace and stability."
 por.303.a: "Long Live the Queen!"

 por.304.t: "Regicide!"
 por.304.d: "As Duarte II was returning from a routine trip to the Chamber of Most Worthy Peers, his convoy was assailed by four men, clad in black and well armed. The machine gun fire did not gravely wound the Queen, Maria Francisca of Orléans-Braganza, luckily enough, but innocent subjects of the Crown were gravely injured. The wounds of the 1908 terrorist attack were re-opened, and many in the Realm demand justice. While two of the 'soldiers' of the Legião Vermelha were shot down during the ensuing firefight, two terrorists spotted on camera, Mário Castelhano and Emídio Santana, who are apart of the well known Anarchist brigands, have fled, presumably to seek refuge in the Spanish regime of the CNT-FAI. Given the gravity of the crime committed, all options are on the table, including a harsh ultimatum. Careful analysis of diplomatic consequences would be advisable, but these two murderers will be brought to justice!"
 por.304.a: "The CNT-FAI must surrender those responsible!"
 por.304.b: "We must be remain cautious..."

 por.305.t: "Portugal demands the return of the Regicide"
 por.305.d: "While our struggle has been long, our problems are not yet over. Portugal's King, Duarte II, has been assassinated on the way back to his Palace after addressing the Upper House. Two men, Mário Castelhano and Emídio Santana, have crossed into our borders while on the run from Portuguese authorities. Despite the successful assassination, public reception has not been unanimous and many bystanders were wounded during the operation. However, the men were armed here and, by all accounts, even without the approval of the FAI, accepting the Portuguese demand of deportation could be seen by the world as an admission of guilt; not to mention the men are likely to face execution if we hand them over. Also it is important to remember the weight of this decision on a global level. Starting a war against Portugal and their reactionary allies while we are in a weakened state and so recently after the Civil War may prove unwise, even with our allies behind us. A choice must be made, regardless; Will we hand over the duo as demanded, or prepare for the Reactionary Retaliation?"
 por.305.a: "We are not in a condition to fight the Entente as of now. We must comply with their demands."
 por.305.b: "We refuse to betray these heroes!"

 por.306.t: "The CNT-FAI Has Handed Over the Murderers"
 por.306.d: "Thankfully, the government of Spain has not completely lost its mind. They've refused to grant asylum to either of the two criminals and both are to be handed over to our authorities and be hanged in short order."
 por.306.a: "We have no choice but to thank them for their help..."

 por.307.t: "The CNT-FAI Refuses Our Ultimatum"
 por.307.d: "The treacherous dogs in Spain have granted asylum to the duo of criminals responsible for murdering our Most Faithful Majesty. Now every man must do his duty, for the final struggle against Syndicalism will soon begin!"
 por.307.a: "As Armas!"
 por.307.b: "We must back down, whatever the cost."

 por.308.t: "Portugal Backs Down"
 por.308.d: "After all that, the Portuguese cowards have backed down from their ultimatum. This truly shows just how spineless they are."
 por.308.a: "Coward and Capitalist both start with C."

 por.309.t: "Occupy Galicia?"
 por.309.d: "The region of Galicia, Portuguese speaking in all but in name, and long under Spain's yoke, is under the very real threat of falling under the Syndicalist menace. While some Integralists argue for an intervention to protect our brothers, many politicians have openly expressed their concern at allowing Santiago de Compostela and the relics there to be looted by Anarchist bandits. Doing that could potentially weaken the Carlists even more, however, and will ruin any chance of good relations with them if they ever manage to turn this conflict around."
 por.309.a: "We must secure Galicia from the failing Carlists!"
 por.309.b: "By doing this, we would be helping the Syndicalist Hydra."

 por.310.t: "Portugal Seizes Galicia!"
 por.310.d: "The slithering snakes in Portugal have occupied Galicia while our forces struggle against the godless forces of the CNT-FAI. While they claim it's to ensure their Galician 'brothers' are safe from the yoke of Syndicalism, it's abundantly clear that this land grab is little more than blatant opportunism!"
 por.310.a: "We will correct this later..."

 por.312.t: "The Matters of the Realm"
 por.312.d: "Much turmoil has befallen our Realm during this disastrous century. However, our nation endures and is stronger than ever. Now, the time has come to reform our government and wash away the last remnants of the corrupt republic, to help secure a better future."
 por.312.a: "The future beckons!"

 por.313.t: "For King and Country"
 por.313.d: "The Integralists and other manipulative demagogues have, for far too long, interfered in the nation's well being. The King, his advisors, and parliament should be making the decisions about Portugal's future; not pampered intellectuals living in Lisbon or hiding in Paris. We will shape the Monarchy into something truly grand, but who will head up this regenerated government?"
 por.313.a: "The Paladin will return to office to lead us into a new glorious age!"
 por.313.b: "The Catholic Centre will chart a measured course."

 por.314.t: "The Burden We Bear"
 por.314.d: "We must rise above our petty differences and unite under our Faith, our Country, and our People. And most importantly, we must bring the light of civilisation to the poor and unfortunate souls who need Christ in their lives. It is neither an expensive nor glorious endeavour to build outposts in the dark of the jungle and spread civilisation, but, nonetheless, it is our ultimate goal. And, of course, so is defending our faith against those who seek to destroy it!"
 por.314.a: "Forward towards a better Portugal and a better World."

 por.315.t: "Portugal Formally Rejoins the Entente"
 por.315.d: "After the end of the Weltkrieg with the signing of the Treaty of Versailles, and even more so after the Revolution in '25, Britain and Portugal have drifted further and further apart despite being in a formal alliance. But now, as dangerous times begin to threaten us, would it be wise to turn to our oldest friend for aid?"
 por.315.a: "We will renew the world's oldest and greatest alliance, and beat back the Syndicalist Hydra."
 por.315.b: "We'll refrain for now."

 por.316.a: "With the renewal of this treaty, we will stop Syndicalism!"

 POR_duarte_braganca_leader_desc: "§YBorn:§! §LSeptember 23rd, 1907, in Seebenstein, Lower Austria, Austria-Hungary§!\n§YBackground:§! §LBorn in exile under the pretender Miguelists, Duarte Nuno quickly rose in prominence as his elder brothers drowned themselves in debauchery and controversy. He would return home after the Restoration and Manuel's attempts to reconcile the House of Bragança, quickly finding himself wrapped up in the politicking of the Causa Monárquica. A devout conservative educated by a priest, the Integralists promoted Duarte as a true champion of their ideals, going as far as to influence him to undertake an agronomy degree so that he would be a “more useful and honourable” monarch.\n\nAfter Manuel II died childless in 1932, Duarte ascended the throne according to the deeply controversial Pacts of Dover and Lisbon. Rapidly, he realised that the Integralist's support for him was largely an insincere power play to consolidate the March 17th Regime. With many of his "rightful" royal perogatives signed away by the constitutionally minded Manuel, Duarte reigned with little room to manoeuvre and few genuine allies among the arch-reactionary Integralists of whom many personally opposed a Miguelist King.\n\nDuarte is obsessed with one thing, the survival of the Monarchy. Throughout his life, the integrity and strength of the Kingdom has been his top priority. His coronation unified the warring branches of the House of Bragança, but now he must pick his path very carefully. He's a man of absolutist ambition but the Royalist establishment is equally zealous, and no doubt King and Country will come to blows over who should truly rule Portugal.§!"

The young Queen has always been popular when she was a princess, always looking to help people in need whenever possible. Her gentle and good demeanour may make her aggressive anti Integralist position seem surprising, but since taking the throne she has denounced excesses from that party, and her fearless attitude only helps her popularity.§!"
