 INC_vietminh: "Viet Minh"
 INC_vietminh_desc: "The 'Viet Minh', or 'League for the Independence of Vietnam', is a broad coalition government of groups which seek the immediate independence of Vietnam. The various factions within the Viet Minh all advocate for popular unity, but each has its own agenda, greatly inhibiting the organisation's ability to make important decisions. Besides which some Khmer and Laotian members have voiced their doubts about the name of the organisation..."

### Events ###
 viet.0.t: "New Indochina!"
 viet.0.d: "Our general uprising has achieved a great victory. On the corpse of German colonial regime proudly stands our independent nation, ruled by the Vietnamese National Independence Coalition, or Viet Minh, which was established earlier this year and which coordinated the uprisings.\n\nNguyen An Ninh has been elected as the chairman of the Viet Minh. The loss of thousands of lives has already proven that the German colonial regime will not yield until the bitter end. The Viet Minh is determined to lead this national resistance war against the German bandits, and that calls for the will of all Indochinese people - Vietnamese, Laotian, Cambodian, Muong, Tay... To sacrifice themselves in service to our just cause.\n\n(Since you have a coalition government, the popularity of your government won't be affected by the popularity of your ruling party)"
 viet.0.a: "We will be victorious!"

 viet.1.t: "An Indochinese Declaration of Independence"
 viet.1.d: "As our national salvation war against German bandits begins, we are going to form an independent sovereign state. While few Cambodians and Laotian have joined us, the revolutionaries agreed that the newly established state should represent the whole Indochina and devoted to the liberation of Indochinese people.\n\nThe revolutionaries decided to draft an Indochinese Declaration of Independence. The radical revolutionaries urge an expression of our solidarity with the Internationale. Meanwhile, VNQDD and other nationalists wanted to declare Pan-Asianist ambition. While strongly devoted to internationalism, syndicalist leader Ta Thu Thau believes in the need for a tactical compromise——A moderate declaration will win the support home and abroad."
 viet.1.a: "An Internationalist Declaration!"
 viet.1.b: "A Pan-Asianist Declaration!"
 viet.1.c: "A Moderate Declaration!"

 viet.2.t: "Politics in the Viet Minh"
 viet.2.d: "Among all the revolutionaries and patriots in the Viet Minh, four factions stand out:\n\nAfter the crackdown in 1926, Ho Chi Minh's Revolutionary Youth League suffered from internal split. The Indochinese Revolutionary League is its direct successor. Adhering to orthodox anarcho-syndicalism, the current leader Ta Thu Thau, recently returned from France, succeeded in organising trade unions in Saigon and some other cities.\n\nInfluenced by the French Jacobins, some hard-liners broke away from the League in the 1931 Paris Conference and formed New Viet Revolutionary Party, or Tan Viet. The Tan Viet believes in the virtue of iron discipline and secret movement. As a result, they proved to be effective in infiltrating the colonial police force and garrison.\n\nThe VNQDD, or the Vietnamese Nationalist Party, is modelled after the Chinese Nationalist Party or KMT. This party is popular among the petit bourgeoisie and wealthy farmers, especially in northern Vietnam. The failed Yen-Bai mutiny cut down many of the party's members, but also won them heroic reputation.\n\nIn 1928, Nguyen An Ninh, a prominent anarchist revolutionary in Indochina, founded the Aspiration Youth. Convinced that syndicalism cannot win the revolution, he modelled his movement on traditional secret societies to agitate the revolutionary spontaneity of peasants. While its anarchist ideals attracted many intellectuals, their connections to the rural area played a key role in the revolution and ensured their dominance in the Viet Minh.\n\nWhile the initial euphoria of revolution unites all factions, only time can tell whether this unity will endure the forthcoming challenges."
 viet.2.a: "Together for Victory!"

 viet.3.t: "Anti-Infiltration Campaign"
 viet.3.d: "The German scum want to sabotage our glorious revolution. Spies and traitors are everywhere. While the VNQDD wants to infiltrate the enemy and launch an intelligence counter-offensive, the Tan Viet party argues that expanding our secret police is the only way to eliminate internal enemies. The Anarchists and Syndicalists urge us to create a red terror by authorising our local militia to arrest and execute suspicious people and set up a revolutionary tribunal. Whatever we choose, we must crush the enemy!"
 viet.3.a: "We must strengthen our intelligence."
 viet.3.b: "Expand the secret police."
 viet.3.c: "Red Terror is our response."

 viet.4.t: "Land Policy"
 viet.4.d: "If the Indochinese revolution is to prevail, it must win the hearts and minds of peasants. Nationalists argue for rent reduction for tenants but maintaining our relationship with patriotic landlords. However, radicals want a complete land reform to mobilise the peasants and eliminate the Ancien Régime in every village. The fierce debate on the land policy is splitting the coalition. Ta Thu Thau and Pham Van Dong suggested a compromise by confiscating the land of 'traitors' for now and conduct land reform in the future."
 viet.4.a: "We will slightly reduce rent."
 viet.4.b: "Promise land redistribution in the future."
 viet.4.c: "Radical land reform now!"

 viet.5.t: "German Blockade"
 viet.5.d: "German imperialists have completely cut off our line of communication with our international friends. Now we are in dire lacking of equipment. Many of our soldiers are equipped with hatchets and spears. The Tan Viet party inherits the transnational underground revolutionary network developed by the old league in the 1920s. They suggest focussing on smuggling weapons in the gold triangle to support our troops. This trade, however, requires absolute secrecy and some amoralism..."
 viet.5.a: "We have no other choice."

 viet.5.e: "Keep the pace."

 viet.6.t: "National Assembly"
 viet.6.d: "Despite some controversy about whether counter-revolutionary suspects should be given election right, the provisional government decided that all people 18 years old or older were eligible to vote to generate the National Assembly, which is expected to be the highest organ of the state exerting both legislative and executive power. Now, the first national election in the Indochinese history, against all odds, has been conducted in such an emergent situation. A new majority emerged in the newly convened National Assembly and appointed a chairman of Assembly, also the head of state..."
 viet.6.a: "Nguyen An Ninh's charisma conquers everyone!"
 viet.6.b: "Ta Thu Thau secures the support of workers!"
 viet.6.c: "The Tan Viet Party's superior organisation prevails."
 viet.6.e: "The VNQDD's nationalist rhetoric wins over the masses!"

 viet.7.t: "The Fate of Nguyen Thi Nam"
 viet.7.d: "Nguyen Thi Nam is a very successful merchant in northern Vietnam, known as "the Queen of Iron". She also owned some of the largest and most modernised plantations in the North. She has been secretly funding anti-colonial movements for a long time. However, while our army was advancing, the workers in her plantations rose up and captured her. They, along with over five thousand peasants from neighbouring communes, crammed together and set up a revolutionary tribunal. Under the red banner "Overthrow the despotic landlord Nguyen Thi Nam, take back the land for the peasants!" they announced the death penalty for her. Our soldiers stopped the execution, but an immediate decision needs to be made."
 viet.7.a: "Damn she is our hero! Suppress those bandits."
 viet.7.b: "Confiscate her property, and leave her be."
 viet.7.c: "Revolution is the synonym for Justice!"

 viet.8.t: "Nationalist Conspiracy"
 viet.8.d.a: "Deeply resenting our just social revolution, some insidious VNQDD traitors conspired to launch a coup against us. These self-claimed nationalists organised some anti-syndicalist bandits called National Salvation Corps to march on Saigon and occupy some government buildings. Our Vietminh leaders had to evacuate. However, the heroic worker militias in Saigon refused to surrender. They recapture the buildings and repelled those fools! We have launched a purge against those traitors."
 viet.8.d.b: "Deeply resenting our just social revolution, some insidious VNQDD traitors conspired to launch a coup against us. These self-claimed nationalists tried to organise some bandits called National Salvation Corps to march on Saigon and overthrow our government, but the conspiracy was detected by our secret police. Secret police pre-empted the conspirators and arrested most of them. We have launched a purge against those traitors."
 viet.8.a: "I know nationalists are not true revolutionaries!"
 viet.8.b: "Secret polices are very helpful!"

 viet.9.t: "Coup in Saigon"
 viet.9.d.a: "Some rebels declared a so-called 'anti-syndicalist national salvation revolution' in Saigon. They attacked factories and fighting began between rebels and local militias. Tan Viet party claimed that nationalists have betrayed the revolution and urged an immediate purge of nationalists, but VNQDD members claimed their innocence. The intelligence director delivered a secret report showing that the rebels are actually disguised by Tan Viet infiltrators. Now, Comrade Pham Van Dong is asking: 'Comrade, there are two chairs here, one for nationalists and one for internationalists. On which do you wish to sit?'"
 viet.9.d.b: "Some rebels declared a so-called 'anti-syndicalist national salvation revolution' in Saigon. They attacked factories and fighting began between rebels and local militias.

Now, Comrade Pham Van Dong is asking: 'Comrade, there are two chairs here, one for nationalists and one for internationalists. On which do you wish to sit?'"
 viet.9.a: "Internationalist."
 viet.9.b: "Sorry, I choose Nationalist."
 viet.9.c: "I would like to sit on both."

 viet.10.t: "The Indochinese Revolt Succeeds"
 viet.10.d: "The peoples of Indochina have finally thrown off the yoke of colonial exploitation! This is a great day for all the socialist nations of the world and a major defeat for the German Imperialists! Our military observers in Indochina have studied the guerrilla tactics adopted by the revolutionaries, but their usefulness remain to be seen."
 viet.10.a: "Congratulations!"

Our military observers in Indochina have studied the guerrilla tactics adopted by the revolutionaries, but their usefulness remain to be seen."
 viet.11.a: "Congratulations!"

 viet.12.t: "European Settlers"
 viet.12.d: "About 20,000 European settlers living in Saigon is a troublesome issue to us. They served in colonial administration and monopolised almost all modern economy sectors in Indochina. While some revolutionaries decided to side with our just cause, most are die-hard reactionaries. How should we deal with them?"
 viet.12.a: "Force them to work for us!"
 viet.12.b: "Trade Unions takeover and decide!"
 viet.12.c: "Nationalise their assets and put them into jail!"

 viet.13.t: "Religious issue"
 viet.13.d: "Cochinchina is home to millions of Buddhists, Christians and Caodaists. For many years religion played a dominant role in people's life. With the establishment of our revolutionary government, these religious believers are on the brink of panic. We need to enlighten our people, but drastic methods might cause serious backlash, and damage our war effort."
 viet.13.a: "Declare State Secularism."
 viet.13.b: "They are also patriots, we need to unite."
 viet.13.c: "Integrate and transform them into a civic religion."
 viet.13.e: "Secretly purge religious leaders."

 viet.14.t: "The Exodus"
 viet.14.d: "Panicked by the revolution and the war, many Cao Dai believers and Catholics were deceived by their religious authority and decided to flee from our motherland. Hundreds of thousands of people try to escape from our control zone!"
 viet.14.a: "Traitors!"

 viet.15.t: "The End of War"
 viet.15.d: "The bloody war has come to an end, but its legacy is still haunting us. Unfortunately, many of our compatriots also served the enemy. The war witnessed children rebelling against their parents, wife prosecuting her husband, brothers killing each other. The Indochinese society is even more divided after reunited. How should we deal with this?"
 viet.15.a: "Start a national reconciliation campaign."
 viet.15.b: "Re-education camp is the place for traitors!"

 viet.20.d: "Saigon, the heart and brain of Indochina, has become the battlefield of National Assembly election. All factions tried to use their power in Saigon municipal committee to manipulate the mechanics of election in favour of him, as a result the constituencies have been gerrymandered. These ugly moves are now out of control and disgust many people. Trade unions in Saigon argued that this is the inherent fault of representative parliamentary system, and they ask to divide the constituency in Saigon based on working places rather than geographical zones."
 viet.20.a: "Try to hold an unbiased election."
 viet.20.b: "Some faction managed to manipulate the result..."
 viet.20.c: "Election based on working places sounds good."

 viet.21.t: "A New Government"
 viet.21.d: "Nguyen An Ninh and the anarchists won a majority of seats in the National Assembly. Following the victory, Nguyen An Ninh declared that while the Assembly does offer a forum for popular expression, only through decentralisation and democratisation of localities, will the people be truly represented.

 viet.33.b: "Accepted their demand."

 viet.34.t: "Crackdown on Trade Unions"

 viet.35.t: "Tan Viet Activities"

The party members are organised into secret cells and often engage with clandestine activities, which is sometimes regarded as non-democratic and suspicious by other political factions. Some politicians suspect they are secretly planning to overthrow the government by force. Should we put a limit on their activities based on the principle of political openness?"

 viet.35.b: "We need to keep an eye on them."

 viet.36.t: "Socialist Opposition"
 viet.36.d: "Our recent reform has angered the socialists. They claimed the nationalist government has deeply deviated from the revolutionary principle of [INC.GetNameDef].

 viet.39.t: "Socialist Coalition Government"
 viet.39.d: "Thanks to the his connection with other socialist faction, especially the syndicalist league, Pham Van Dong managed to out-manoeuvre his opponents within the party. He then admitted in the national assembly that the hard-line policy of the party has alienated many good people and stifled democracy in Indochina.

 viet.39.a: "C'est la lutte finale..."

 viet.40.t: "Ending the Martial Law?"

 viet.40.c: "Continue the martial law."

 viet.41.t: "Remove Pham Van Dong"
 viet.41.d: "Pham Van Dong, despite all his merits, has a personality of administrator and intellectual rather than a real leader. He is considered too soft-willed and amicable to the enemy by the hardliners in the party. In the politburo meeting, Head of the Organisation Department Le Duc Tho led an attack against Pham Van Dong. Le Duc Tho, with his authority brought by close connection to French Jacobin, claimed that Pham Van Dong does not really understand the ideology of Leninism. It would be better for Dong to work as the prime minister."

 viet.41.b: "Pham Van Dong seek support from outside of the party."

 viet.42.t: "Deal with Syndicalists"

 viet.42.a: "Excellent."

#Deal with Tan Viet party
 #The Tan Viet party has established an entrenched political network within the country. Their party members are influential in the state bureaucracy and army. They posed a hidden threat to our political leadership. To carry out our reforms, we must deal with the situation.
 #Deal with Aspiration Society
 #The Aspiration Society has established an entrenched political network within the country. Their anarchist agenda has secured the support of peasants and many intellectuals. They posed a hidden threat to our political leadership. To carry out our reforms, we must deal with the situation.
 #Deal with Nationalists
 #The Nationalist party has established an entrenched political network within the country. Their party members are influential in the state bureaucracy and army. They posed a hidden threat to our political leadership. To carry out our reforms, we must deal with the situation.

 viet.51.t: "Agricultural Recovery"
 viet.51.d: "The resistance war has come to an end. Now it is time to cure the war-torn motherland. During the war, agricultural production was heavily disrupted and hundreds of thousands of farmers fled from their land to join the army or seek refuge. It might take at least a year for agriculture, the major sector of our economy, to recover."
 viet.51.a: "Excellent."

 viet.53.t: "This year's agricultural production: Good Harvest"
 viet.53.d: "We have a bountiful harvest this year. Such a harvest could pose potential trouble if the price of corns goes too low."
 viet.53.a: "Excellent."

 viet.54.t: "This year's agricultural production: Nothing Special"
 viet.54.d: "The agricultural production this year is hit hard by various factors. Many peasants believe that the government must have done something wrong to cause the anger of the heaven."
 viet.54.a: "Well."

 viet.55.t: "This year's agricultural production: Poor Harvest"
 viet.55.d: "The agricultural production this year is hit hard by various factors. Many peasants believe that the government must have done something wrong to cause the anger of the heaven."
 viet.55.a: "Disaster is Imminent!"

 viet.63.t: "The result of land reform"
 viet.63.d.a: "Our land reform created a rural society of small land-owners. The landlord regime in the countryside diminished. Most landlords moved to cities and start a new life with the revenue from selling land. However, Tenants and poor peasants, although received their land, are still burdened with loans. Many radicals regard this as a revolution unfinished..."
 viet.63.d.b: "Our land reform created a mixed result: Extremists tried eradicated landlords physically. However, landholders were frightened to make concessions and in general the land reform was conducted in a peaceful manner. Most peasants now are self-sufficient and become more confident while the former landlords and gentries are very discontent with the result."
 viet.63.d.c: "Our land reform created a very egalitarian rural society. Gentry and landlords are fundamentally eliminated. In many villages poor peasants developed a strong sense of class consciousness. However, the terrors during the land reform also left deep rift within Indochinese society. The interpersonal ties of clans and families are almost destroyed. A tense atmosphere replaces the previous unity in villages..."
 viet.63.a: "At least it's a reform..."
 viet.63.b: "We have done our best..."
 viet.63.c: "Liberation came with a price..."

 viet.65.t: "The resistance from landlords"
 viet.65.d: "Despite the landholding limit regulation, landlords managed to keep their lands via various formal or informal means. Tenants and poor peasants see little improvement of their life and complaint that the government is with the landlords. People are very disappointed."
 viet.65.a: "Well."
 viet.65.b: "Need to strengthen bureaucracy to implement reform."
 viet.65.c: "Landlordism is the problem!"

 viet.66.t: "Extremism spreading in countryside"
 viet.66.d: "Motivated by the government, many peasants rose up to seize land, means of production and private possessions from landlords. Many landlords are humiliated and receive corporal punishment from peasants. Some prestigious scholar-gentries committed suicide. Many intellectuals protest that the government should act to protect law and order."
 viet.66.a: "Extremism is better than 1000 years of feudalism."
 viet.66.b: "That's too much."
 #Red Terror!

 viet.67.t: "Expand Redistribution Target?"
 viet.67.d: "With the land reform expanding to the North, we encountered a rather different situation-these areas are too densely populated and impoverished that we can't find enough land from landlords to redistribute. Therefore, if we want to fulfil the promise of land to the tillers, that means many small landholders will be also the target of land redistribution..."
 viet.67.a: "We must ensure every peasant get their own land!"
 viet.67.b: "There should be other solutions."

 viet.68.t: "Red Terror"
 viet.68.d: "The violent Land Reform has evolved into a red terror engulfing the entire country! Many villages see mass execution of landlords. Even those patriots who contributed to the resistance can expect no protection. Vicious attack is also used by peasants to retaliate against rivals. Although it is impossible to know how many of innocent people were mistakenly executed, it is suggested that the scale of errors committed was undeniably dramatic."
 viet.68.a: "Perfect chance to eliminate feudalism physically!"
 viet.68.b: "We have committed some mistakes..."

 viet.69.t: "Binh Dinh peasant uprising"
 viet.69.d: "The peasants in Binh Dinh province, rose up to protested against the detention of relatives and confiscation of property allegedly in connection with the land reform programme. However, when they were ignored by local administrators, some 20,000 peasants in all, armed with swords and farm tools seized several district governmental installations and began to burn down administrative buildings, town halls and railway stations, destroy tax registers, and pillage police stations. Local administration has been paralysed. The ignorant peasants must be controlled by foreign agents!"
 viet.69.a: "Send in People's Army."

 viet.70.t: "Enlist an amateur guerrilla leader?"
 viet.70.d: "Recently, a successful guerrilla leader received some attention. This man, previously known as 'Anh Van (Borther Literati)' in the intellectual circle in Tonkin, abandoned his job as a history teacher and organised a guerrilla band that achieved some brilliant victories against Germany. He never received any formal military training and claims to learn military tactics from T.E. Lawrence's Seven Pillars of Wisdom. Some believe he has a real military talent, but our generals trained in France doubt it. Should we enlist this amateur into our army?"
 viet.70.a: "Let's see what can he do."
 viet.70.b: "No, we don't need a literati in army."

 viet.71.t: "Army Reform"
 viet.71.d: "The newly born People's Army of Indochina has stood up to the baptism of fire, but it's still a very immature army. With the lessons learnt from the war, two military schools emerged in our army. General Van Tien Dung, representing the idea of the general staff, believes in the merit of well-planned surprise offensive. They want to create a more centralised command system. Meanwhile, General Nguyen Chi Thanh, a prestigious political officer, believes in the merit of human will and individual initiative. He and his colleagues argued that courage and tenacity of Indochinese soldiers is our greatest weapon."
 viet.71.a: "Let me see..."

 viet.73.t: "Panzer Panic"
 viet.73.d: "Our soldiers have reported encountering terrible steel monsters that can spit fireballs. Our officers trained in France know it is a type of armoured vessel called the Tank, or, in German, the "Panzer". However, this weapon still causes great panic among our peasant soldiers, and even those who know it is not a monster have found no methods to deal with its armour. The Panzer panic has demoralised our army and many soldiers flee from the battlefield whenever German Panzers emerge."
 viet.73.a: "Monsters!"

 viet.74.t: "Panzer Panic Subsides"
 viet.74.d: "Swift victory in the war for independence has brought an end to the threat of German Panzers. With the metal beasts no longer around, the Panzer Panic has ended."
 viet.74.a: "Excellent."
 #Anti-Tank Weapon: Firebomb and Lunge mine

 viet.79.t: "Tet Offensive!"
 viet.79.d: "Shortly after the midnight, when Vietnamese people are celebrating lunar new year and setting off firecrackers, grenades exploded in the German Colonial Office in Hanoi. Viet Minh commandos appeared in Hanoi downtown while a huge size of Viet Minh troops launched massive attack against every cities and towns. Ignorant peasants, led by VM agitators and armed with machetes and spears, rose up in various districts to 'eliminate the tyrants'. We are totally caught off guard!"
 viet.79.a: "Is this how Viet Minh celebrate Lunar New Year?"

 viet.80.t: "Shelling of Saigon"
 viet.80.d: "This morning, the Germans began a bombardment of the city of Saigon, using both German warships as well as aerial bombardment. When this assault finally ceased, most of the major buildings in Saigon had been basically levelled. However, this bombardment will only aggravate our people's hatred of the German bandits."
 viet.80.a: "Damn it."

 viet.81.t: "New Textbooks"
 viet.81.d: "In order to awaken the militaristic spirit inherent to Indochinese people, we have introduced a complete set of reform to our education system including military training in elementary school, weapon using courses and new textbooks. Here is an example of a question from a Grade 2 Mathematics textbook:\n\nOne Indochinese soldier can kill five Huns.\n\nIf seven Indochinese soldiers fight forty-three Hunnic scums; how many Hunnic bandits will live?"
 viet.81.a: "8?"
 viet.81.b: "All the Huns are killed!"

 viet.82.t: "Liberation Day"
 viet.82.d.a: "Today is the Liberation Day—The day when we finally drive German imperialists out of our motherland. The victory and independence came at the cost of thousands of martyred souls. Almost everyone in this sorrowful land loses their beloved in the path towards liberation. Let's mourning all the martyrs devote their lives for our peace and freedom. Phan Dinh Phung, Phan Boi Chau and Ho Chi Minh are the most notable ones among them."
 viet.82.d.b: "Today is the Liberation Day—The day when we finally drive German imperialists out of our motherland. Now our peace and freedom, came at the cost of thousands of martyred souls, is under threat. Let's follow the example of Phan Dinh Phung, Phan Boi Chau and Ho Chi Minh to fight for our independence!"
 viet.82.a: "Mourning the martyrs."
 viet.82.b: "For greater victory!"

 viet.83.t: "The Sorrow of War"
 viet.83.d: "Recently, some of our writers published a series of non-fictions and novels reflecting on our previous war. They portrayed the brutality of the war and people's sufferings during the war. These works failed to make a difference between the evil imperialist invasion and our just war to win independence and unify the country and they have caused great confusion among our people."
 viet.83.a: "People are exhausted."
 viet.83.b: "Ban these counter-revolutionary poison."
 viet.83.c: "Reflection makes us better."

 viet.84.t: "Nguyen Thai Hoc returns to Saigon"
 viet.84.d: "After the failure of the Yen-Bai mutiny, the fate of many VNQDD leaders was unknown. Fortunately, comrade Nguyen Thai Hoc, the founder and head of the VNQDD managed to escape from the German bandits' persecution. He fled to the mountainous region on the Sino-Vietnamese border and hid in South China. Today Nguyen Thai Hoc has returned to Saigon and was enthusiastically welcomed by the people."
 viet.84.a: "Excellent!"

 viet.85.t: "Citizen Vinh Thuy"
 viet.85.d: "When our troops marched into the imperial capital of Hue, the Vietnamese Emperor Bao Dai, persuaded by our agent to stay, had been awaiting at his citadel. Today, in the platform in front of Hue, surrounded by the enthusiastic crowd and the flying Indochinese red flag, Emperor Bao Dai announced:\n\n'From this day on, royalty is abolished in Vietnam. Emperor Bao Dai is from here on in the simple citizen, Vinh Thuy. Citizens, let me be understood, I prefer to be a free citizen than an enslaved king'.\n\nThe abdication ceremony ended by Bao Dai handing over the symbols of royalty-gold seal and gold sword-to the revolutionary delegates while the crowd shouted praise to citizen Vinh Thuy."
 viet.85.a: "Emperor yesterday, citizen today."

 viet.86.t: "Women's role in revolution?"
 viet.86.d: "The question of women has become controversial in Indochina. Many women joined the revolution and end up in important positions, but male revolutionaries are dissatisfied with being led by women and they tend to cast women participants in support roles. Despite evidence that in prehistoric times Indochinese women enjoyed equality or even power, the norm of women taking a submissive role has long been internalised in our society and it will be hard to change."
 viet.86.a: "They should be content with auxiliary roles."
 viet.86.b: "Women hold up half the sky!"

 viet.87.t: "New Four Virtues"
 viet.87.d: "Traditionally, women are expected to behave according to the 'Four Vir tues', which are wifely behaviour, wifely speech, wifely manner and wifely labour. Recently, some radical feminists published a series of essays claiming the 'Four Virtues' might be given new meanings: "behaviour" should not signify slavish obedience, but resolute commitment to the struggle for freedom and independence; "speech" is to talk boldly and eloquently to convince people to join the liberation struggle, or firmly and bluntly when telling men they were wrong; "manner" is not pleasant expressions but revolutionary anger, eagerness, and aggressiveness; and "labour" should exclude domestic works.\n\nTheir claim scared many people, including intellectuals known for supporting gender equality."
 viet.87.a: "Sounds too radical."
 viet.87.b: "Support them!"
 viet.87.c: "This should equally apply to men!"

 viet.88.t: "The Tragedies of the Youth Shock Brigade"
 viet.88.d: "Our Youth Shock Brigade, mainly comprised of young girls and women volunteers, is an important auxiliary unit known as "our army's arm and leg". However, a recent report discovered that the tragic experiences of the "Shock Girls" sent to the front line armed with simple shovels and having no military knowledge. Food and clothing are in chronic shortage on the front line. Working hour is long and living condition is terrible. Despite the girls' courage and determination, their resistance to enemy artilleries and bombing using shovels and pickaxes is hopelessly inadequate. The report has caught wide public attention and shown a demoralising impact."
 viet.88.a: "We should try to improve their equipments and working condition."
 viet.88.b: "We shouldn't let women go to dangerous places."
 viet.88.c: "Sorry but we can't do anything."

 viet.89.t: "The 1900th anniversary of Trung Sister uprising"
 viet.89.d: "From AD 40 to 42 two sisters, Trung Trac and Trung Nhi rose up against invaders for independence and liberty. Despite their failure, Trung sisters have become the symbol of our resistance and heroism. This year is the 1900th anniversary of Trung Sister uprising. Parades and ceremonies are held in Saigon and Trung sister temples."
 viet.89.a: "What a great day."
 viet.89.b: "Our women should serve on the front lines like Trung sisters!"

 viet.90.a: "Damn!"

 viet.91.t: "Buddhism in the modern age"
 viet.91.d: "Buddhist sects all across Indochina recently held a meeting to found the Indochinese Unified Buddhist Sangha. Under the banner of Buddhist revival movement, they seek to reform and strengthen Buddhism in the modern age. Unlike other religions like Catholicism or Caodaism, Buddhism is deeply entrenched in Indochinese population. The government has to treat it cautiously."
 viet.91.a: "Respect our tradition."
 viet.91.b: "Support Buddhist Socialism tendency!"
 viet.91.c: "Organised religious movements should be suppressed."

 viet.92.t: "Comrade Dong get exhausted?"
 viet.92.d: "Comrade Pham Van Dong might be a workaholic, but he has taken too many jobs. Now he seems exhausted. Should Comrade Dong take a rest?"
 viet.92.a: "Take a rest, Comrade Dong."
 viet.92.b: "Non sibi sed patriae."

 viet.93.t: "Francomania hits Saigon"
 viet.93.d: "Our recent close cooperation with the Commune of France brought a surge, or resurgence of Francomania in Saigon. The new fashion of 'civilised' Saigon citizens is to dress like a French worker, address each other's name with 'Monsieur', and eat Banh mi. However, nationalists bitterly satirised and criticised this slavish emulation of French culture."
 viet.93.a: "All hail the great France, Paradise on the Earth!"
 viet.93.b: "We must preserve our national essence."
 viet.93.c: "Absorbing new culture makes us stronger."

 viet.94.c: "Studying new culture makes us stronger."

 viet.95.t: "The First Saigon International Art Festival"
 viet.95.d: "The First Saigon International Art Festival was held recently. Due to the influence of our leading intellectuals, the curatorial priorities are the works of the avant-garde artists in syndicalist countries. However, it turned out that our citizens can hardly appreciate these modernist, futurist and surrealist art..."
 viet.95.a: "We must further drill the taste of Indochinese people."
 viet.95.b: "Avant-garde culture seems too advanced for a place like Indochina..."

 viet.96.t: "The spread of Sorelian influence"
 viet.96.d: "Although Indochinese exiles in France already knew Sorelianism, it didn't become a major trend in oversea Indochinese community. However, the recent victory of Sorelianists in France brought a surge of Sorelian ideas among our students in France. Several radical Sorelian groups like 'Dai Viet Socialist Combat Team' were formed in France and started to have influence on Indochina."
 viet.96.a: "Sounds like a new fashion."
 viet.96.b: "Another worrisome radical ideology."
 viet.96.c: "Sorelianism is wrong! Stop these dumb teens!"

 viet.97.t: "Battle of Hue"
 viet.97.d: "Our troops launched a coordinated offensive to take Hue, the ancient imperial capital city of Vietnam. As expected, it's the lair of Vietnamese reactionaries. German and loyal Vietnamese troops occupied some well-fortified positions in the city, including the imperial citadel. Our army was engaged in heavy house-to-house and street fighting to take the city. All the available heavy equipments are gathered and many buildings are demolished to achieve a breakthrough. The battle for the Imperial Citadel is no less brutal. Out of 160 buildings of the Imperial City only few major sites remained intact when the flag of [INC.GetNameDef] flying on the Citadel flag tower. During and after the bloody battle, thousands of die-hard reactionary civilians were swiftly executed."
 viet.97.a: "Hue!Hue!Hue!"

 #viet.98.d: "Vu Trong Phung, a talented novelist and satirists living in Hanoi published his new novel So Do (Dumb Luck), a bitter satire of the rage for modernisation in Vietnam during the late-colonial era. The novel follows the absurd and unexpected rise within colonial society of a street-smart vagabond named Red-haired Xuan. The idiotic Xuan's use of rhetorics like 'civilisation' and 'modern citizen' allowed him ascending to intellectual society of Indochina. It also ridiculed the revolutionaries in the early 1930s. The novel, despite its popularity among common readers, turned out to be very politically provocative. This book is criticised as degenerate by some intellectuals and its revolutionary merits are questioned. The critics also claimed that a character in the book, the Cochinchinese King of Visceral Disease Treatment is ridiculing Nguyen An Ninh who sold self-made ointment when conducting revolution in the Mekong delta."
 #viet.98.a: "Nonsense, this a good book."
 #viet.98.b: "Support a comedy film adaptation and Nguyen An Ninh will play the King of Visceral Disease Treatment!"
 #viet.98.c: "This is politically incorrect; we should ban it."

 viet.110.t: "Searching for Brother Ho"
 viet.110.d: "Although official record states that Comrade Ho Chi Minh, or better known as Nguyen Ai Quoc back in Paris, was killed in 1926 during the German intervention, there was no solid evidence that he is dead aside from the dubious German claim. There were rumours that Ho Chi Minh actually escaped from that disaster and hid in southern China organising a guerrilla. Although it might be unlikely that he is still alive, people still wonder about Brother Ho's fate. With the help of a friendly Chinese government, it's now possible to conduct an investigation in southern China of this..."
 viet.110.a: "It's good to have a try."
 viet.110.b: "We already know he died."

 viet.111.t: "We found Brother Ho's wife?"
 viet.111.d: "During our investigation, we found a woman in Guangzhou, Tang Tuyet Minh, claiming she was brother Ho's wife. The legal witnesses of their marriage in China, Cai Chang and Deng Yingchao, confirmed the fact and we also found notes and letters written by Ho Chi Minh in her collection. However, brother Ho's celibacy has been a symbol of his dedication to the revolution. It might be embarrassing to admit this marriage..."
 viet.111.a: "Invite her to Indochina."
 viet.111.b: "This should remain a secret, Brother Ho is only married to revolution."

 viet.112.t: "The legend of Guangxi Guerrillas"
 viet.112.d: "Our investigation of Brother Ho continues. There was a rumour in southern China that some ethnic minorities conducted a guerrilla warfare in Guangxi against local warlords in the late 1920s. Maybe it has some connections with comrade Ho Chi Minh."
 viet.112.a: "Interesting."

 viet.113.t: "The fate of Guangxi Guerrillas"
 viet.113.d: "We tried to find Ho Chi Minh's trace in Guangxi. It is clear that there was a guerrilla movement in Sino-Vietnamese in the late 1920s. However, it was finally suppressed by Guangxi warlord in 1932 and the leaders of the guerrillas were arrested and executed. Many of the executed leaders, according to the locals, are Vietnamese. This seems to be the fate of comrade Ho Chi Minh. Should we conclude our search?"
 viet.113.a: "Continue."
 viet.113.b: "We already know the answer..."

 viet.114.t: "More Evidence from Guangxi"
 viet.114.d: "We continued our research in Guangxi and the result was out of our expectation. We discovered that some guerrillas were arrested and imprisoned in Nanning due to lack of evidence. Later in 1933 they were released by Guangxi warlord under the pressure of Chinese progressives including Guangdong warlord Chen Jiongming. Among those released guerrillas, one man named Hu Guang left his diary to a local intellectual who helped him during the prison time. We confirmed that the diary is actually written by Ho Chi Minh. It seems that comrade Ho managed to hide his identity and survived. The Prison Diary of Ho Chi Minh is now transferred to the Museum of Indochinese Revolution in Saigon."
 viet.114.a: "Interesting."

 viet.115.t: "The fate of Brother Ho"
 viet.115.d: "We finally found a decisive evidence about Brother Ho's fate in the secret police documents of the Legation cities and now we are able to reconstruct the fate of Ho Chi Minh. After the crackdown in 1926, Ho continued to conduct guerrilla warfare in southern China. The guerrilla was suppressed by Guangxi warlords and Ho was arrested. However, the warlord did not know who he is and released him. Comrade Ho decided to leave China for France but he was captured by the Legation city's police in Hongkong in 1933 and German secret polices figured out Ho's identity. Because Germans did not want to repeat the mass demonstration after Phan Boi Chau's execution in 1925, Ho was secretly executed in Hongkong. This untold story will not be forgotten by Indochinese people henceforth."
 viet.115.a: "May your spirit protect our motherland."

 viet.130.t: "New foreign exchange earner!"
 viet.130.d: "We are running out foreign exchange and new foreign exchange earner is needed to finance our weapon purchasing. While our peasants have been encouraged to cultivate cash crops. What should we do with the most profitable one-opium is still undecided? Of course, opium production brought by colonisers is condemned by us, but desperate times require desperate measures..."
 viet.130.a: "Let's do it."
 viet.130.b: "No, this is against our principle."

 #viet.131.t: "Opium Production Competition from Indochina"
 #viet.131.d: "[INC.GetNameDefCap] recently decided to engage in transnational opium trade with its state power and proved to be a very powerful producer and dealer. Our domestic opium production has been shocked by their opium export. How should we respond?"
 #viet.131.a: "We should produce more opium than damn Syndies."
 #This is a dangerous game...

 #viet.132.t: "Opium Production Competition from the Gold Triangle"
 #viet.132.d: "Our competitors in this region, Burma, Siam and Yunnan have increased their opium production in response of our opium production effort. The competition in the international opium trade has become more and more vicious. Our opium export income has decreased."
 #viet.132.a: "Our opium production should prevail!"
 #This is a dangerous game..."

 #Opium Harvest!
 #Our farmers have made greatest effort, against all odds to produce opium. Despite the devastation of war, we still managed to have an opium harvest! Our rivals in this trade will be shaken by the cheap price of Indochinese opium.
 #Socialism has proved its superiority again!

 #viet.134.t: "Stop Opium production"
 #viet.134.d: "Since we have won the independence war, it's no longer necessary to produce opium. Now it's time to end this sinister trade."
 #viet.134.a: "The necessary evil should be forever forgotten."
 #Actually, extra profits won't harm...

 viet.135.t: "Collaborate with the Binh Xuyen Gang?"
 viet.135.d: "Binh Xuyen, an organised crime syndicate based on Saigon, is still active clandestinely after the revolution. They derived its funds from banditry and vice racketeering, but also transnational smuggling. Although our cadres are well-versed in clandestine operations, they are still new to the trade, maybe it's a good idea to seek the help of experts..."
 viet.135.a: "Let's unite for national salvation."
 viet.135.b: "How can we work with gangs?"
 viet.135.c: "We must eradicate them!"

 viet.136.t: "Deal with the Binh Xuyen Gang?"
 viet.136.d: "With the victory of anti-German national salvation war, the collaboration with Binh Xuyen Gang has also come to an end. While most leaders believe Binh Xuyen mafia should be eradicated, comrade Nguyen An Ninh wanted to integrate them into our socialist society. Is that possible?"
 viet.136.a: "Crime syndicates are also syndicates..."
 viet.136.b: "We no longer need Mafias!"

 viet.137.t: "Battle of Saigon"
 viet.137.d: "Binh Xuyen Gang, an organised crime syndicate in Saigon, felt endangered by our policy, decided to launch a desperate attack against us. After initial small-arms fire and mortar exchanges, a large part of the densely populated inner city was engulfed in bloody house-to-house combat. Finally, Saigon worker militia and local garrisons decided to deploy heavy weapons to crush the resistance of mafias. Hundreds of civilians were killed, and the many people's houses were levelled. It will take some time for Saigon to recover."
 viet.137.a: "Woops."

 viet.138.t: "The Integration of Binh Xuyen"
 viet.138.d: "Binh Xuyen members have gradually learned the merit of socialist society and renounce their criminal activities, now the newly born Binh Xuyen society has joined Saigon municipal administration and the former armed gang have been integrated into our army."
 viet.138.a: "I know they can be transformed!"

 #viet.139.d: "Binh Xuyen members have gradually learned the merit of socialist society and renounce their criminal activities, now the newly born Binh Xuyen society has joined Saigon municipal administration and the former armed gang have been integrated into our army."

 #viet.139.b: "Ignore them."
 #viet.139.c: "Actually... we should help them."

 #viet.145.t: "A Desperate Cry from Cambodia"
 #viet.145.d: "Khmer Issarak reported that the reactionary Phibun regime in Siam has pursued an inhumane assimilation policy. They tried to completely eliminate Khmer as an identity. Khmer representatives in national assembly wanted the assembly to discuss the situation in Cambodia."
 #viet.145.a: "Concerning."
 #viet.145.b: "Not our business."

 viet.98.t: "Poet Xuan Dieu's promotion"
 viet.98.d: "Recently, a poet Xuan Dieu is nominated to be the chief editor of the official cultural newspaper 'Literature and Arts (Van Nghe)'. Xuan Dieu is considered as perhaps the greatest romantic poet in modern Indochina. During the resistance, he became an ardent revolutionary writing to promote socialism and fighting against imperialists. However, his early works were known for their doleful and decadent style. Moreover, it is an open secret that Xuan Dieu is homosexual and wrote about 'Man's Love'. Some cultural officials urged caution against this appointment. Notably, his 'partner', Huy Can, is also a high-level cultural official. Such a couple gaining prominence in the official cultural field of [INC.GetNameDef] could be embarrassing..."
 viet.98.c: "It will be an embarrassment."
 viet.98.b: "He is a brilliant writer and revolutionary, so what's the problem?"

 viet.155.a: "War!"
 viet.155.b: "Time is not ripe."

 viet.156.t: "The Commune's Stake in Indochina?"
 viet.156.d: "Today a meeting is held in Paris by the 'French Friends of Indochina' association. In this very rare case, both the old Jacobin Marcel Cachin and the Sorelian Jacques Doriot attended the meeting and spoke for a closer relationship with Indochina, a newly independent socialist country in Asia. They argued that the Commune has done a lot to help the Indochinese people to win their independence, but that the responsibility of France for her former colony does not end. We can and we should offer to the people there a special relationship, as it passes through the present period of transition on its way to a new era - an era of pride and independence, and era of enlightenment and socialism - an era which, when contrasted with the bleak past of colonial oppression, will truly represent the ideal of socialist revolution."

 viet.158.d: "Our comrades in the Commune of France haven't forgotten us. France has decided to establish a close political and economic relationship with us. They sent their political specialists, engineers and technicians to facilitate the development of socialism and industrialisation in Indochina."
 viet.158.a: "Solidarity Forever!"

 viet.159.t: "France is not Interested in Indochina"
 viet.159.d: "The Commune of France has decided that they are not interested in Indochina anymore. They refused any kind of closer cooperation beyond basic relation between socialist countries."

These people are from [INC.GetNameDef], a newly emerging nation revolting against the German Empire.

 viet.169.d: "General Nguyen Son, also known as Hong Shui in China, has led a military mission from Indochina to observe and assist our war efforts.

[From.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] has brazenly declared that the line they have drawn is necessary to establish a security zone against the 'blatantly hostile' Indochinese government, much to our exasperation - the only explanation being a preparation to crush our revolutionary movement.\n\nPredictably, many are now calling for war to liberate the occupied territories. Although [From.GetNameDef] has just defeated the German forces in Asia, it is difficult to conceive that they could hold out against our forces while being busy on other fronts, and so the hawks have argued that an attack should be carried out as soon as possible. All we need to do is give the word."

 viet.1956.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Prepares for War"
 viet.1956.d: "Surprising few, it seems that our decision to retain control over much of Indochina is now leading to war. Following our declaration of a security zone around our area of occupation, the [FROM.GetAdjective] government has responded with outrage - already, the forces that were used against the German forces and their collaborators are being mobilised against us, accompanied with a declaration that 'the Hanoi Puppet Regime will be destroyed'.\n\nThe army is on high alert - the first campaign against [FROM.GetNameDef] was no simple affair, and the second one is not expected to be any easier."

 #Manpower crisis
 #The resistance and revolution should depend on the voluntary spirit of Indochinese people. The manpower crisis of our newly born army is more and more severe. Introducing a draft will solve the problem, but it is worried that the new state apparatus doesn't have the ability to carry out conscription well...

 #Enact conscription
 #Mobilise urban population
 #Focus on expanding village guerrillas

 #'Upgrade' system
 #A new recruitment system called 'Upgrade' is being promoted across Indochina. Under this system peasants are encouraged to be part-time and full-time militia or guerrillas in their own village. After they have basic training and military experience, they will be encouraged to join regional forces, and later regular troops. Most recruits through this system are already adapted to military life when they join the regular army. This system will be able to offer a stable source of manpower for our army'
 #This is how voluntary spirit works!

 #Rising desertion rate
 #Since the introduction of conscription, the army is suffering from demoralisation and high desertion rate. Indochinese peasants in general are very reluctant to leave their homeland. To recruit more soldiers, the improvised recruitment committees must used forceful methods. Many recruits are brought away from their home after a knock at the midnight. They complaint that they are very afraid being sent to remote places from their home with poor training and arms to fight the powerful enemy.
 #We shouldn not push that hard!
 #We need to enforce military discipline

 INC_agriculture_decisions: "Agricultural Production"
 INC_agriculture_decisions_desc: "The Monsoon Wind, blowing from Africa across the Indian Ocean brings water and sediment to the eastern rim of the Indochina peninsula, where millions of farmers live on several coastal plains. The entire Indochinese economy relies on its agricultural production, heavily merchandised yet vulnerable. The agricultural production in general is very susceptible to climate variability, but certain decisions and changes introduced by our government or farmers themselves could also have an impact."

 #Typhoon hits
 #Mekong flooding
 #Dike construction

 #Nitrogen Fertiliser industry development
 #The colonial regime never allowed investment on fertiliser and insecticides industry to make us dependent on them. Now we have built our first fertiliser factories. However, it might take some time to promote the use of chemical fertiliser among farmers.

 #Production of Field Water Pump
 #With the development of machine production industry, now we are able to produce field water pumping engines. The introduction of power pumps will greatly help the irrigation of rice field and improve the yield greatly.

 #Study Rice cultivation methods from Japan
 #Japan is the leading technology power in Asia and also the first country to apply modern science to rice cultivation. Studying rice cultivation methods from Japan will help our agricultural modernisation a lot.

 #Ban Rice Alcohol production
 #Producing rice alcohol is usually a good way consume rice surplus. However, in this year of poor harvest, it might be a better choice to temporarily ban rice alcohol production to save enough rice for food.

 INC_convert_distillery_decision: "Convert Distillery to Fuel Factory"
 INC_convert_distillery_decision_desc: "The Colonialists had started to produce alcohol as a substitute for motor fuel in the 1930s but had still relied heavily on imported fuel. With fuel import cut off due to the enemy blockade, we now direly need fuel supply. It's possible for us to expand the capacity of distilleries produce alcohol for fuel purposes and butanol for aviation fuel. However, the project will be costly and consume a huge chunk of agricultural production."

 #Reevaluate party's land policy
 #Tan Viet party passed a new resolution. During the resistance era, the party decided that Indochina was still in the phase of bourgeois democratic revolution, and we must keep a united front with gentries and landlords. Now, with the independence of our motherland secured and party's leadership entrenched, it is time to start our land reform.

 #The Plain of Reeds development programme
 #The Plain of Reeds is a sparsely populated alluvial swampy region lying astride the Siamese-Indochinese border. During the resistance war, it was a major base used by our guerrillas. The Plain of Reeds has great agricultural production potential, but it will require some population resettlement and the construction of an extensive levee and drainage system to control flooding. The development of the Plain of Reeds will also deprive the area of its potential of being a guerrilla base. Should we start the development programme?
 #Start the Plain of Reeds development programme!
 #Leave it be
 #We should build hidden military bases there instead

 #The land reform laid down the basis of corporatisation. Peasants are organised into work-exchange team and in some places communes. It is reported that a newly established commune has increased their production by 1300% since corporatisation. If that is true, by promoting collectivisation we will soon eliminate starvation in Indochina or even the earth.

 #Border Fortification
 #The mountains and jungles in Viet Bac will be a natural barrier against northern invaders, building fortified defence line in this region is critical to our national defence.

 #Indonesian revolutionary Tan Malaka arrived
 #Tan Malaka, a legendary revolutionary from the Dutch East Indies, just arrived in Saigon and was received by the enthusiastic people. He addresses the crowd with a speech in surprisingly fluent Vietnamese praising the daring thought and the effort of Indochinese people against German Imperialism, the common enemy of all Asian people. Tan Malaka wanted to fight along with us in this sacred battle. Malaka spent his entire life fighting colonialists. Having organised revolutionary movement in Dutch East Indies, German Malaya, Siam, the Philippines and China and speak the languages of the people in each country, he will certainly be a great help to us.
 #Welcome, comrade Tan Malaka!

 #Cham people's voluntary brigade
 #Cham people, once the ruler of Southern Vietnam, is now a small minority group in Indochina. Due to the historical rivalry, most of Cham people are alien to the revolution led by Vietnamese. However, comrade Tan Malaka, sharing the same Islam religion and Malayo-Polynesian language with them, managed to convert some Cham communities to socialism. Now they have formed the Cham people's voluntary brigade under the command of Tan Malaka!
 #Excellent, comrade Tan Malaka!

 #Tan Malaka sailed for the Philippines
 #The famous revolutionary Tan Malaka today leaved Saigon. With the breakout of American Civil War, the situation in the Philippines, the colony of America, has become unpredictable. Tan Malaka decided to sail for the Philippines. In the farewell speech, he addressed to the people: 'All I Wish is for Indochinese and all suppressed colonial people to be free.'

There, he met Ho Chi Minh, and quickly became one of his most trusted confidants and leaders of men. He witnessed the tragic end of Vietnamese syndicalist movement and fled to France. In exile, he developed an interest in the ideology of French Jacobins, Vanguardism. The idea of a vanguard group of disciplined intellectuals leading the revolution captured him. After the split of the League in 1931, he founded Tan Viet party and started infiltrating the colony. Most of his colleagues find him forever diligent and energetic, a reliable and loveable person as well as an ideal organiser and administrator. On the other hand, his enemy fear his ability to run the party and state machine.§!"

Ta Thu Thau became a prominent activist in Saigon in the mid-1920s and joined the League in its darkest days. After the split in 1931 gave another heavy blow to the League, Ta Thu Thau rose to power. This sharp intellectual has intentionally modelled Ho Chi Minh's leading style since his assuming of the title of Chairman, trying to calm factional tensions and strengthen solidarity. The recovery of the League from the collapse largely credited to his efforts. Now, he is determined to achieve the unfulfilled dream of the martyrs—to build syndicalism in Indochina.§!"

He studied in Sorbonne and participated in the French Revolution of 1919. In 1922, Nguyen An Ninh, Nguyen The Truyen and Nguyen Ai Quoc (Ho Chi Minh) met in Marseille and decided to plan the liberation of their motherland. Nguyen An Ninh returned to Indochina in 1924 and was arrested by German police for radical agitation. After witnessing the crackdown of Indochinese syndicalism, Nguyen An Ninh decided that Indochinese revolution must rely on the spontaneous uprising of peasants. Since then, he started the Aspiration Society, modelling on traditional secret societies. He often personally travels from village to village under the disguise of a monk or herbalist, selling his self-made ointment, and secretly recruits members to sow the seeds of revolution. He thus won great popularity among peasants in the Mekong Delta. While his dream of completely transforming the personality of the Indochinese people might not realise in the foreseeable future, his emphasis on cultural enlightenment, autonomy and spontaneity will deeply reshape Indochinese society.§!"

Despite this, he clamoured for an education, excelling at elementary and high school studies before eventually being accepted into Hanoi's \"College of Public Works\". Here he made contact with Nguyen Thai Hoc and the Nam Dong Publishing House, the nucleus of what would become the VNQDD. It did not take long for Duc Chinh to begin to rise up the party's ranks after its founding in December 1926. Though he was initially appointed as Chief of the Organising Sub-Committee, carrying out work such as propagandising and generating funds for the party through illegal means, he was later promoted deputy-Chairman in 1928 due to his intense loyalty to Thai Hoc during the growing factionalisation of the VNQDD.\n\nThe ever so humble deputy-Chairman has been renowned as Thai Hoc right-hand man and closest advisor. Where his National Commander was always fiery and bombastic, Duc Chinh garnered a reputation as a cautious and pragmatic politician, who managed the secretive inner workings of the party bureaucracy. Though he never generated the same cult of personality as the one Nguyen Thai Hoc wields, to those who know of Duc Chinh's invaluable service to the VNQDD, he is celebrated as the party's \"Quyen han va Duc do\" (Power and Virtue).\n\nPho Duc Chinh has now received an offer from his foreign revolutionary benefactors to rise to the position of President of Vietnam. With Nguyen Thai Hoc's leadership and legacy tarnished by the temporary defeat of the Vietnamese Revolution, it was decided that only Duc Chinh, the quiet cornerstone of the party, had the political sway and firm-hand needed to rebuild both the VNQDD and the Vietnamese nation in its darkest hour.§!"

Once a humble sailor in the port of Hai Phong, he was introduced to the VNQDD around the 1920s by his friend Tran Huy Lieu. Thanks to his travels at sea he became an envoy between the party's Hanoi, Saigon and Canton based cells. While in China he spent time in the company Whampoa cadets and the Third International's Military Mission, studying the art of war and proving to be a quick learner. After being sent back to Cochinchina in the early 1930s, he joined forces with a local detachment of Viet Minh partisans and was elected as their commander. Since then, Binh has served in the south under his current pseudonym and also earned the nickname \"Tuong doc nhan\" (the One-Eyed General), due to having lost an eye to the shrapnel of a German grenade. For this reason he always wears a glass prosthetic, often alongside a pair of glasses to hide the wound.\n\nBinh is a man of fanatical radicalism, both in his military and political views. He remains adamant that the VNQDD's fighting force must be transformed as soon as possible from a rabble of partisans into a proper \"People's Army\", modelled after France and Britain, as well as the old KMT National Revolutionary Army. In politics he leads the Cuong Hoc Thu Xa (National Strengthening Faction) of the VNQDD alongside Tran Huy Lieu. This faction promotes the idea of turning the VNQDD into a proper revolutionary communist party built on Marxist theory and not just the Three Principles of the People. Binh and his clique have also taken strong inspiration from Sorelianism and the China Revival Society, a potent mixture when combined with his wide-reaching influence over the Vietnamese military and his own personal charisma.§!"
