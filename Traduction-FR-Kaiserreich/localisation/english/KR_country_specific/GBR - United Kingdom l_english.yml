### Ideas ###
 GBR_postwar_devastation: "Post-War Devastation"
 GBR_postwar_devastation_desc: "After so many battles fought on British soil, the economy has been devastated. Worse than the actual destruction is the tatters of a syndicalist economic system which has been hastily discarded, and yet with nothing to replace it. Britons will go through a period of hardship and readjustment, and it will not be easy."
 GBR_legacy_revolution: "Legacy of the Revolution"
 GBR_legacy_revolution_desc: "There is more than the economy to rebuild in Britain - there is the very fabric of society. The young have never known anything other than syndicalism, and many of the older generation supported the revolution - or look on the returning Exiles as cowards who fled instead of staying and fighting. Trust must be restored, and it will take time and effort."
 GBR_syndicalist_resistance: "Syndicalist Resistance"
 GBR_syndicalist_resistance_desc: "Most of the syndicalists in Britain are tired of fighting... but give them enough cause to be angry, to believe that the return of the king means that everything - including the injustices - will be just as it was? And we may very well be facing a return to the violence which heralded the 1925 uprising."
 GBR_military_chaos_1: "Army in Chaos"
 GBR_military_chaos_1_desc: "The British army is very much in a transition period - any remnants of the organisation the syndicalists ran under needs to be swept away, and an eye cast upon anyone who was part of it. Can we trust their soldiers? Can we trust anyone they reported to? Everything must be rebuilt from scratch."
 GBR_military_chaos_2: "Army in Chaos"
 GBR_military_chaos_2_desc: "The British army is very much in a transition period - any remnants of the organisation the syndicalists ran under needs to be swept away, and an eye cast upon anyone who was part of it. Can we trust their soldiers? Can we trust anyone they reported to? Everything must be rebuilt from scratch."
 GBR_pure_recruits: "Pure Recruits"
 GBR_pure_recruits_desc: "We have been very careful to ensure no syndicalist sympathisers made their way into the new British army."
 GBR_military_letson: "Letson's Army"
 GBR_military_letson_desc: "The beginnings of what HFG Letson began in Canada are now seen played out in the British Army: an organisation focused on mobility and mechanisation."
 GBR_military_vanier: "Vanier's Army"
 GBR_military_vanier_desc: "The beginnings of what Georges Vanier began in Canada are now seen played out in the British Army: an organisation focused on superior training and quality."

 NIR_rejoin_the_uk_desc: "The time has come for us to rejoin the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland."
 GBR_rebuilding_empire: "Rebuilding the Empire"
 GBR_rebuilding_empire_desc: "Rebuilding the British economy and government is our most immediate priority - but rebuilding the British Empire must follow. There are places throughout the world where Britons live, or which have looked to the Empire as their guiding force, and unless we are prepared to let the sun set on that glorious empire forever we must strive to bring them all back into the fold."
 GBR_demand_england: "Demand British Lands"
 GBR_demand_england_desc: "[From.GetNameDefCap] currently possesses land in Great Britain, land which currently belongs to us. They should return it at once."
 GBR_demand_uk_state: "Demand [From.GetNameDef]"
 GBR_demand_uk_state_desc: "[From.GetNameDefCap] is properly a part of the United Kingdom, and should not be outside our control at all. We must seek to return it to the fold at once."
 GBR_restore_order_in_ireland: "Restore Order in Northern Ireland"
 GBR_restore_order_in_ireland_desc: "The Loyalists in Northern Ireland are pleased to be back under British control - but they are not everyone in Northern Ireland, and some effort will need to be spent in order to restore order to the region and make the area properly part of the United Kingdom."
 GBR_restore_order_falklands: "Restore Order in the Falklands"
 GBR_restore_order_gibraltar: "Restore Order in Gibraltar"
 GBR_restore_order_malta: "Restore Order in Malta"
 GBR_demand_northern_ireland: "Demand Northern Ireland"
 GBR_demand_northern_ireland_desc: "Now that the United Kingdom has been restored, we must turn to the question of Northern Ireland. After the Anglo-Irish treaty Northern Ireland chose to remain a part of the Union, and only joined the republic under syndicalist duress, but now many long to return back to the Crown once again. For the sake of the northern Protestants, we must go to the Irish and settle the matter - or forego our claim to the United Kingdom title once and for all."
 GBR_demand_gibraltar: "Demand Gibraltar"
 GBR_demand_gibraltar_desc: "Gibraltar is not only ours by right of the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht, it is also home to thousands of British nationals and occupies a vital spot at the entrance to the Mediterranean. We must demand its return."
 GBR_demand_falklands: "Demand the Falkland Islands"
 GBR_demand_falklands_desc: "The Falkland Islands are not an important colony, off in the southern Atlantic, but its several thousand inhabitants are British nationals who want to be returned to British rule. We must honour their wishes and demand the islands' return."
 GBR_invade_ireland: "Invade Ireland"
 GBR_invade_ireland_desc: "The Irish government has left us no choice. We must invade and deal with the Irish situation once the island is completely under our control."
 # GBR_fund_loyalists: "Fund the Loyalists"
 # GBR_fund_loyalists_desc: "There are yet Loyalists in Northern Ireland struggling to be free. Taking overt military action to assist them might be off the table, but there is nothing stopping us from quietly funding and supplying the Loyalists under the table, and letting them take matters into their own hands."
 GBR_decide_wif_fate: "Decide the Fate of [From.GetNameDef]"
 GBR_decide_wif_fate_desc: "[From.GetNameDefCap] was a nation born out of convenience, meant to deal with the array of British and French colonies in the Caribbean while their colonial overlords were engulfed in chaos. It was never meant to be a permanent arrangement, and now we must decide their ultimate fate."
 GBR_ask_for_malta_control: "Ask for Malta's Return"
 GBR_ask_for_malta_control_desc: "The Maltese were never really under French jurisdiction, and truly do want to return to British control. Now that we are back on our feet, we should ask for it at once."
 GBR_ask_for_carib_control: "Ask for Control Over [From.GetNameDef]"
 GBR_ask_for_carib_control_desc: "[From.GetNameDefCap] is rightfully a [Root.GetAdjective] colony, so we must approach their overlords and request it be transferred to us now that we are back on our feet."
 GBR_ask_for_colony_control: "Ask for Control Over [From.GetNameDef]"
 GBR_ask_for_colony_control_desc: "[From.GetNameDefCap] is rightfully a [Root.GetAdjective] colony, so we must approach their overlords and request it be transferred to us now that we are back on our feet."
 GBR_ask_for_colonies: "Ask for Return of Colonies"
 GBR_ask_for_colonies_desc: "[From.GetNameDefCap] currently controls land that was once a British colony. Since they are our allies, they should see no issue in returning it to us now that we are back on our feet."
 GBR_retake_colony: "Retake [From.GetNameDef]"
 GBR_retake_colony_desc: "The time has come to retake our [From.GetAdjective] colony, once and for all."
 GBR_demand_colonies: "Demand Return of Colonies"
 GBR_demand_colonies_desc: "There are a number of former British colonies under [From.GetNameDef]'s control - the time has come to demand their return."
 GBR_reconstruction_decisions: "British Reconstruction"
 GBR_reconstruction_decisions_desc: "Years of war has ravaged Great Britain. More than that, the islands have been syndicalist rule for more than a decade. For the second time in the life of most British citizens, their entire world is being turned upside down. Trials will be held, the country torn down and rebuilt from scratch, and the old made new once more."
 GBR_fight_syndicalists: "Fight the Syndicalist Resistance"
 GBR_fight_syndicalists_desc: "We will not allow the syndicalist militias to drag us down. They lost the war for Britain once, and they will lose it again!"
 GBR_land_settlement_act: "Pass the Land Settlement Act"
 GBR_land_settlement_act_desc: "Lots of veterans will now be returning home to Britain, and with so much land now without holders it makes sense to grant that land to the soldiers as a form of thanks from the government - not to mention that it ensures the land doesn't remain fallow for want of someone to work it."
 GBR_abercrombie_plan: "Implement Abercrombie Plan"
 GBR_abercrombie_plan_desc: "Also known as the 'Greater London Plan', the damage done to the country's capital has left many thousands in the city homeless. Major work will have to be done to rebuild it, but at the same time we have an opportunity to revamp the city's transportation and zoning network, to make up for so many centuries of haphazard growth and planning."
 GBR_create_relief_council: "Create the Relief Agencies Council"
 GBR_create_relief_council_desc: "There are a number of relief agencies such as CARE and the Red Cross who are eager to come into Britain. Their help is sorely needed, but some kind of agency to coordinate them is desperately required... not to mention that we wish to avoid the possibility that syndicalists or even the Germans use such relief efforts as a means to spread propaganda and influence."
 GBR_expand_power_system: "Expand the Power System"
 GBR_expand_power_system_desc: "The United Kingdom's power grid has been left in sorry shape since the end of the war, and it was very outdated and coal-dependent to begin with. Citizens have needed to endure rolling brown-outs for long periods. We need to repair and upgrade the system as quickly as possible."
 GBR_reduce_taxation: "Reduce Working Class Taxation"
 GBR_reduce_taxation_desc: "Bringing in the old measures of taxation is not going to go over well with the working class - who are already stressed as it is, what with the upending of the country's entire economic system. Some measure of tax relief is necessary, though it will not come without considerable argument in the House of Commons, namely regarding who gets what and for how long."
 GBR_new_towns_act: "Implement the New Towns Act"
 GBR_new_towns_act_desc: "Our urban areas are currently a mess, needing massive amounts of repair and restoration. The slums in particular are becoming nearly uncontrollable. An act to establish new townships in the outlying areas, passing their development onto independent corporations, should help in decentralising our population - at least until the cities can once again start growing."
 GBR_national_housing_project: "Fund National Housing Project"
 GBR_national_housing_project_desc: "A sizeable portion of the British population is homeless, thanks to the war. The NHP will strive to provide temporary shelter to those who need it, and start funding the construction of affordable permanent housing for those who can't enact repairs on their own."
 GBR_farming_subsidies: "Enact Farming Subsidies"
 GBR_farming_subsidies_desc: "Trade restrictions have meant most British citizens have been on war time rationing for many years, so the expansion of our imports should come as some relief. We do, however, need to subsidise the farms so they can assist in rebuilding our supplies. The rationing measures will also need subsidisation until private markets can begin to manage on their own."
 GBR_business_subsidies: "Enact Business Subsidies"
 GBR_business_subsidies_desc: "Between the corporations which are already in Britain and which will no longer be under union management and the corporations that are returning to the country from abroad, both will have their hands full attempting to reorganise themselves to the new way of doing things. If we don't establish some kind of subsidy programme to tide them over, we can expect a great deal of bankruptcies and trouble ahead."
 GBR_new_employment_act: "Pass the Veteran Employment Act"
 GBR_new_employment_act_desc: "We have thousands and thousands of soldiers, not to mention returning Exiles, who will need to be put to work - there is certainly lots for them to do, but a guiding agency would help ease the process, and also prevent the Exiles from being unfairly shut out of places that might view them with hostility."
 GBR_beveridge_report: "The Beveridge Report"
 GBR_beveridge_report_desc: "Noted Liberal economist, William Beveridge, has cited the need to gather data on the current state of British society - and possible ways that the government can help. It will take time to gather the data, and even the act of putting together the report will appease those who want to see the government doing something. We should give Beveridge the green light to go ahead with his project."
 GBR_pigou_report: "The Pigou Report"
 GBR_pigou_report_desc: "Not everyone is enthused by the idea of hearing a report by William Beveridge, as his suggestions for the government will undoubtedly be seen through a lens of socialism. Instead, a suggestion has been made to sponsor a report by famed economist, Arthur Cecil Pigou, one aimed at restructuring the economy rather than focusing solely on society."
 GBR_desyndicalisation: "De-Syndicalise the Economy"
 GBR_desyndicalisation_desc: "It did not take long for the syndicalists to get their claws into every aspect of the British economy - tearing out all their worker-centred laws and restrictions will help, but we must also establish new rules lest the entire thing collapse under its own weight. The British economy must learn how to operate once again under the principle of the free market, and that will take time."
 GBR_pass_insurance_act: "Pass the National Insurance Act"
 GBR_pass_insurance_act_desc: "The Beveridge Report has made a number of recommendations to the government, one of which is the establishment of a national social security programme. We won't ever have the kind of welfare state the syndicalists prided themselves upon, but a greater security net for the public is apparently a necessity - as well as incredibly popular."
 GBR_central_banking_act: "Pass the Central Credit Act"
 GBR_central_banking_act_desc: "One provision recommended by the Pigou Report has been to establish a system of interest-free credit offered by the central banks, and overseen by the government. These loans would allow private citizens to act as entrepreneurs, becoming a new class of business owner as we transfer control away from the labour unions. The idea is to avoid rampant inflation, but to apply a jolt of private enterprise to an economy which hasn't needed that for decades."
 GBR_national_health_service: "The National Health Service"
 GBR_national_health_service_desc: "Another recommendation of the Beveridge Report is that a system of free universal health care be established in Britain, under the guidance of the NHS. It will do a great deal to improve conditions in the country, as well as assuage those who still claim that life was better under syndicalist rule."
 GBR_privatisation_act: "Pass the Privatisation Act"
 GBR_privatisation_act_desc: "With the desyndicalisation process having been completed, now the government needs to undertake the process of reverting ownership of major companies from the unions back to private hands. Thanks to the Pigou Report, we have a system in place to make sure the process is fair, and a field of new entrepreneurs ready and funded by credit to take their place."
 GBR_rent_control_act: "Pass the Rent Control Act"
 GBR_rent_control_act_desc: "So long as there is a serious shortage of houses, rent control must exist. The establishment of Tribunals throughout the country to fix fair rents as between landlord and tenant (as recommended by the Ridley Committee) seems to provide the best solution of a long-standing problem."
 GBR_progressive_reconciliation: "Reconcile the Left"
 GBR_progressive_reconciliation_desc: "One major goal of the Labour Party is to make an appeal to all progressives in the country - we will pass several social reforms to earn their trust, so that they may be counted on to fight with Labour against any reactionary policies proposed by conservatives. Those who believe in socialist policies are not incompatible with Britain's new administration, and we must act as a protector to ensure they thrive just as any other citizen."
 GBR_parliamentary_reform: "Parliamentary Reform"
 GBR_parliamentary_reform_desc: "Our present system of voting produces Parliaments which are not representative of the people's will. A party with a minority of votes can secure a majority in the House of Commons. We must therefore reform the voting system so that voters can offer a list of preferential candidates, as well as ensure that elections do not favour the wealthy by putting the extra cost of campaigning upon the State."
 GBR_female_equality: "Enact Female Equality in Britain"
 GBR_female_equality_desc: "The family is the basis of our national life. Liberals were the first to demand family allowances and are determined to secure adequate provision for motherhood and child welfare. The Liberal Party demands for women equality of opportunity and status; it stands for equal pay for equal work, and for equal opportunity of entry into the public services."

### Focuses ###
 GBR_british_reconstruction_authority: "The Reconstruction Authority"
 GBR_british_reconstruction_authority_desc: "The economy has been turned inside out. Many are homeless. The entire country has been devastated by the war, and now we are in need of quick decisions to rebuild it all. The British Reconstruction Authority will be empowered to do just that."
 GBR_fate_of_unions: "Fate of the Unions"
 GBR_fate_of_unions_desc: "While syndicalism is gone, the United Kingdom is still left with a multitude of unions who have no idea where they stand. Are they dissolved? Is there to be no worker representation at all? The decision remains to be made."
 GBR_fate_of_leaders: "Start the Trials"
 GBR_fate_of_leaders_desc: "The fate of the unions is very separate from the union leadership - in particular, those people who ran the Union of Britain, and who made the decision to pit British soldiers against British soldiers. They must be put on trial, and their fate made an example of all those who would follow them."
 GBR_question_of_labour: "The Question of Labour"
 GBR_question_of_labour_desc: "One remaining question is regarding the fate of the Labour Party. Should it be allowed to campaign and field candidates for Parliament, or was the fact that it worked with the syndicalist authority enough of a betrayal that they can never be forgiven?"
 GBR_returning_aristocracy: "The Returning Aristocracy"
 GBR_returning_aristocracy_desc: "Many of the wealthier Exiles have returned to Britain - only to discover that their lands had been stripped, their businesses nationalised, and their homes now occupied by someone else. They want these things returned to them... but returning it to them now means stripping it from someone else."
 GBR_reorganise_bureaucracy: "Reorganise the Bureaucracy"
 GBR_reorganise_bureaucracy_desc: "The British government apparatus was stripped down and rebuilt, in order to work for a government that was entirely centred on trade unions and a powerful welfare state. Now we must do it again, and ensure a bureaucracy exists which will not be fighting us every step of the way."
 GBR_hold_elections: "Return to Free Government"
 GBR_hold_elections_desc: "The last act of the BRA must be to return the United Kingdom to civilian rule - to hold the first truly free elections in more than a decade, and keep them incident-free."
 GBR_guided_parliament: "Guided Parliament"
 GBR_guided_parliament_desc: "The BRA may come to realise that the United Kingdom is in too difficult a state, that the violence committed by the syndicalist supporters who yet remain is too extreme to return to civilian rule. Doing so would be condemning the country to a repeat of the last revolt."
 GBR_end_of_bra: "Reconstruction Completed"
 GBR_end_of_bra_desc: "While the BRA has been instrumental in bringing Britain back from the brink and restoring its pre-syndicalist legacy, its time is now at an end. The British people can finally hold their heads high and look to a better future, without the malign influence of leftist ideology."

 GBR_the_exchequer: "Restore the Exchequer"
 GBR_the_exchequer_desc: "Rebuilding the office of His Majesty's Exchequer will allow us to get the country's economy back on track."
 GBR_foreign_investment: "Rely on Foreign Investment"
 GBR_foreign_investment_desc: "There simply isn't enough money in the hands of the British government or the British people to rebuild the economy - our best bet is to look to foreign investment, while still exerting enough control over the process to prevent the country from falling under foreign control."
 GBR_restore_bbc: "The New BBC"
 GBR_restore_bbc_desc: "The British Broadcasting Corporation has been turned into a wreck by the syndicalist administration. It's time to restore it to greatness and cut it free from the leash it's been on for the last two decades."
 GBR_royal_society: "Fund the Royal Society"
 GBR_royal_society_desc: "The Royal Society is a group of the finest British minds we have available. Giving them funding and turning them towards the problems we face, and the reconstruction of British society, will be an ideal use of their knowledge and skills."
 GBR_imperial_chemical: "The Imperial Chemical Deal"
 GBR_imperial_chemical_desc: "To put it bluntly, the United Kingdom needs fuel - the lack is partly what brought down the syndicalists, and we will need to employ our contacts in the private sector to set up our future as a fuel producer rather than solely an importer."
 GBR_regulate_growth: "Regulate Industrial Growth"
 GBR_regulate_growth_desc: "If we're not careful, there are too many 'entrepreneurs' who will use the current state of the British economy as a way to gain power or exploit the British people. We must be wary and regulate the regrowth of industry carefully, while making efforts not to overly restrict it and thus slow it down."
 GBR_marconi_deal: "The Marconi Deal"

### Restoration of the UK ###
 uk.1.t: "The Liberation of the United Kingdom"
 uk.1.d: "After years of exile and struggle, the royal family has returned to the United Kingdom in triumph. It is a glorious day for Britain and the Empire, all of whom are thankful to [Root.GetNameDef] for its valiant service to the cause of tradition and world order. God save the King!"
 uk.1.a: "Restore the United Kingdom! (Play as the UK)"
 uk.1.b: "Restore the United Kingdom!"

 uk.3.t: "The Restoration"
 uk.3.d: "At long last, [CAN_king_full_name] entered Westminster Abbey today to be properly crowned as virtually all English and later British monarchs have been throughout history. Today is a glorious day, one that will mark a new beginning for the United Kingdom. After the coronation is over, however, the king and his government will find that the task of rebuilding the country is just beginning. The country's army is in a difficult position, with an organisation that will need to be started over from scratch, the economy has been completely upended just as it was after the uprising, and the fate of Britain's former syndicalist rulers must be decided upon."
 uk.3.a: "Long live the king!"

 uk.4.t: "Liberty Day"
 uk.4.d: "Across [Root.GetNameDef], stores and factories are closed as the British gather in a national day of remembrance in honour of those who lost their lives in the struggle against syndicalism. The central activities of the day occur in London where, on the anniversary of his death, the remains of George V have been interred in a special vault in an elaborate ceremony at Westminster Abbey, attended by [CAN_king_first_name], the royal family, and leading political and military figures. This solemn act has finally fulfilled the late king's dying wish to return home. After the ceremony, [CAN_king_first_name] led a procession to the east end of the Mall, where a monument to George V was unveiled. The king stated that the monument commemorated all those who had been victims of the former regime, and that never again would syndicalism threaten British liberty. To honour the victims of syndicalism, and keep fresh the memory of what had been so nearly lost and was so dearly regained, henceforth this day every year is to be celebrated as Liberty Day."
 uk.4.a: "For King and Country!"

 uk.5.t: "Liberty Day"
 uk.5.d: "Across [Root.GetNameDef], stores and factories are closed, as the British gather on this national day of remembrance, in honour of those who lost their lives in the struggle against syndicalism. The central activities of the day occur in the capital where, attended by [CAN_king_first_name], the royal family, and leading political and military figures, the Royal Guard parades through the city. In a speech given to the masses assembled on the Mall, [CAN_king_first_name] pledged that never again would syndicalism threaten British liberty, passed down through the ages. 'We honour the victims today,' he said, 'and keep fresh the memory of what had been so nearly lost and was so dearly regained.'"
 uk.5.a: "For King and Country!"

 uk.6.t: "The New British Army"
 uk.6.d.canada: "With the restoration of the United Kingdom, a large number of British Exiles who had been drafted into the Canadian Army are now the first to return home - they have been assembled into a number of Home Guard units desperately needed to maintain order. Soon to follow them are the senior generals and admirals who have been serving in Canada up until now, all of whom are incredibly pleased to see the Home Isles once again."
 uk.6.d.other: "With the restoration of the United Kingdom, a large number of British Exiles are now the first to return home - they have been assembled into a number of Home Guard units desperately needed to maintain order. Dealing with the disorder in the rest of the British Army will have to wait until later."
 uk.6.a: "We'll need those men desperately."

 uk.7.t: "Aid for the British"
 uk.7.d: "[GBR.GetNameDefCap] is dealing with a tremendous amount of devastation, and they could certainly use whatever assistance [Root.GetNameDef] can offer!"

 uk.8.d.more: "A great deal of sorely-needed assistance from our [From.GetAdjective] allies arrived today! They have been very generous!"
 uk.8.a: "Thank you, [From.GetName]!"

### The British Reconstruction Authority ###
 uk.10.t: "Reconstruction Authority Announced"
 uk.10.d: "While the monarchy has been restored to the Home Isles, many policy-makers feel that the country needs to undergo a difficult 'de-syndicalisation' process. Syndicalist rule permeated deep into British culture and society, as well as the economy, so that must be rebuilt along with the many homes that were laid waste during the war. On the steps of the damaged Westerminster Parliament, Prime Minister [GetBritishExilePM] announced to a hopefully but not enthusiastic crowd that the BRA, or British Reconstruction Authority, had been created and granted broad governing powers to see the rejuvenation process done as swiftly as possible."
 uk.10.a: "Let us hope it works!."

 uk.11.t: "Exiles Encounter Resistance"
 uk.11.d: "Those British citizens who fled the United Kingdom after it fell to syndicalist rule, or 'the Exiles', have encountered increasing resistance now as they begin to return to the country in large numbers. Disputes over the ownership of homes and estates which had been abandoned are frequent, and resentment towards the wealthier Exiles who return 'untouched by war and poverty' has become the norm. [CAN_king_first_name] launched a radio appeal to the British people, reminding them that the Exiles are the very reason their freedom has been regained - they are not returning conquerors, but as lost lambs brought back into the flock. Even so, many believe it will take many years to heal the social divide between these two groups."
 uk.11.a: "Worrying."

 uk.12.t: "Syndicalist Militias Remain Active"
 uk.12.d: "While there is a feeling among most Britons that the war is over, and their willingness to fight has been exhausted, there remain a number of syndicalist militia groups that are still active - they remain hidden both in the northern foothills and buried deep within the United Kingdom's larger urban areas. Militia leaders are reportedly trying to stoke resistance against [CAN_king_first_name] and the 'tyrannical Reconstruction Authority', and while they have met with very limited success so far it can only get worse if the BRA takes actions that anger socialists once more."
 uk.12.a: "We will need to move carefully."

 uk.13.t: "Union Soldiers Return"
 uk.13.d: "Now that the war is done, surviving soldiers who fought for the Union of Britain have begun to trickle back into the cities - some still injured, but most simply fearful that they will suffer repercussions for something they had no control over. Many are looking to re-enlist into the military, though the British Army is by no means ready to accept them just yet. Even so, should these men be treated as veterans? That will mean treating their injuries and providing them with stipends. A large number of Britons have sympathy for them... but these were also the same men who, until just recently, were killing their own countrymen for the syndicalists. Should that be rewarded?"
 uk.13.a: "We won't support traitors."
 uk.13.b: "They'll receive limited help, but no stipend."
 uk.13.c: "They were only doing as they were told - give them full support."

 uk.14.t: "Exile Relief Efforts Begin"
 uk.14.d: "While Britons may not yet be grateful for their presence, the returning Exiles are undoubtedly in the best position to offer relief to those in the United Kingdom who have been left ravaged by the war. Lord Mountbatten has led the way, spending millions of his own funds to set up a homeless relief shelter in the heart of Manchester and Liverpool, and has called on his fellow Exiles to follow suit. Soup kitchens and tent cities have sprung up from one end of the country to the next, some government-funded by many underwritten by the wealthiest Exiles - most of whom have expressed, like Lord Mountbatten, that it is their duty to help those who had been left behind."
 uk.14.a: "A welcome sight."

 uk.15.t: "British Bankruptcies Increase"
 uk.15.d: "Vauxhall Motors Limited closed the doors on its Luton headquarters today, making it the third major bankruptcy declaration since the creation of the BRA. Most of these large companies had transferred over to union ownership during British rule, and with the future of unions in serious question it has left these companies in a state of limbo and without leadership. The BRA is preparing to step in and seize temporary ownership of corporations that threaten to close in this manner, though doing would still leave them in a state where their production is in a standstill. If the situation is not resolved soon, British unemployment levels could reach record heights within months."
 uk.15.a: "This is not good..."

 uk.16.t: "The BRA Begins Operation"
 uk.16.d: "With Parliament itself restored, Prime Minister [GetBritishExilePM] - standing next to [CAN_king_first_name] - stood on its steps to announce that the British Reconstruction Authority was officially underway. Members of Parliament were already streaming into the building for their first session, where discussions would be held on the emergency lifting of import restrictions, and there was a definite feeling among the large crowd that things were soon going to return to normal. A few protestors holding union signs disturbed the ceremony only briefly before being led away by policemen."
 uk.16.a: "A good day!"

 uk.17.t: "Reconstruction Projects Begin"
 uk.17.d: "Given the greenlight by the BRA, a huge number of reconstruction projects have begun operation throughout the country. With loan restrictions loosened or outright ignored, the construction companies have been able to hire on many thousands of eager workers and begin the process of restoring homes to Britain's teeming numbers of homeless families. As the first houses had their frames put up, cheering watchers said it was the first real feeling of hope they've experienced in many months."
 uk.17.a: "Wonderful!"

 uk.18.t: "Arthur Horner Surrenders to Police"
 uk.18.d: "While most of the Union of Britain's syndicalist leadership have either gone into hiding or, as with Oswald Mosley, fled the country entirely, Arthur Horner today appeared and surrendered himself to British police. Even though he knew this would mean being placed on trial, he said 'I cannot in good conscience abandon my socialist brothers and sisters. We may have lost the war, but the battle is still being fought for workers everywhere. If they are to be put on trial for their ongoing fight against oppression, then so shall I.' Horner's supporters turned up in large numbers to silently watch him being led to prison. His actions appear to have stirred up syndicalist support which had been thought withered away by the end of the war."
 uk.18.a: "Interesting."

 uk.19.t: "Wartime Rationing Ends"
 uk.19.d: "A bit of good news to greet the country today: the wartime rationing which most have endured for well over a year now, and in some cases much longer, has officially been lifted by BRA authorities. Import restrictions have been removed, and already British supermarkets are seeing the return of meats and cheeses and fruits that all but vanished since syndicalist rule began. For many Britons, even though many still have their meals funded by the government, this is a sign that things are substantially improving."
 uk.19.a: "Excellent."

 uk.21.t: "Fate of the Unions"
 uk.21.d: "The defeat of the Union of Britain brought with it the destruction of the old trade unions that had supported the syndicalist regime. However, there is still the question of whether British workers should be allowed to organise on a local basis to defend their interests - indeed, there is an entire infrastructure of labour groups ready and waiting to begin setting up unions once again, and merely waiting to see what the government considers 'acceptable' now. Banning them entirely will not go over well with these groups, to say the least. One argument is that the government should set up a small number of controlled unions, and ban the rest. Still others say that the unions aren't the problem, and trying to get rid of them now will only invite disaster."
 uk.21.a: "Allow the unions to continue."
 uk.21.b: "Set up government-controlled unions, ban the rest."
 uk.21.c: "We'll have no unions in Britain - ban them all!"
 GBR_protests_will_fade: "Some of the protest will fade.\n"
 GBR_protests_will_increase: "The protests are likely to become stronger.\n"

 uk.22.t: "Objections to the Union Policy"
 uk.22.d: "While the government's decision to allow unions to continue was met with general approval among the British people, a subset - primarily the wealthy and those only recently returned from abroad - are very much not in favour. They have not gone so far as to protest in the street, but there have been grumblings over the matter and a general belief that the government needs to be careful lest it arrange matters so that the country is primed to have the 1925 revolt happen all over again."
 uk.22.a: "Thanks for the advice."

 uk.23.t: "New Protests over Banning of Unions"
 uk.23.d.control: "Labour supporters took to the streets across the country today, angrily protesting the government's plan to take control of unions. The fact that several will continue to exist, under government control, is considered far from acceptable. 'We're right back where we started, aren't we?' one woman demanded of reporters. 'If we allow this, then the government will walk all over us again!' Police have been reinforced by the British Army, but have so far taken no direct action against the protestors, for fear of escalation."
 uk.23.d.ban: "Labour supporters took to the streets across the country today, angrily protesting the government's complete ban on unions. 'We're right back where we started, aren't we?' one woman demanded of reporters. 'No unions to represent us, just the corporations walking all over us as they please? What are we supposed to do, just lie in the street now? Do we have no say in our future?' Police have been reinforced by the British Army, but have so far taken no direct action against the protestors, for fear of escalation."
 uk.23.a: "Give them their unions, before this escalates."
 uk.23.b: "We're not backing down."
 uk.23.c: "Suppress the protests immediately."

 uk.24.t: "Anger over New Union Leadership"
 uk.24.d: "While the unions have been allowed to proceed unregulated by the government, almost all of them have been required to do a clean sweep of their leadership - no-one who worked as a collaborator with the Union of Britain government is permitted to retain their previous position. While this is easily the lightest requirement the United Kingdom could apply, there have still been a number of protests over the matter in Scotland and Wales, with hardline labour activists saying that this was a 'slippery path' towards government keeping their foot on labour's neck for the rest of time. One of the protests became unruly and had to be broken up by police, but there have been no follow-ups since."
 uk.24.a: "I see."

 uk.25.t: "More Anger over Union Bans"
 uk.25.d: "Protests over the bans against unions have continued, particularly in Wales and Scotland. Labour leaders are maintaining the position that allowing the government to control when and where the British worker can stand up for themselves will inevitably lead to exploitation. Thankfully, it seems as if the protests are losing steam... though, at the same time, there is evidence that the syndicalist militias are also taking on a lot of recruits."
 uk.25.a: "This could get uglier..."

 uk.26.t: "Syndicalist Trials Begin"
 uk.26.d: "The trials have begun for those syndicalist leaders captured by British forces - including Arthur Horner, who turned himself in to police not long ago. Horner's trial has received considerable attention in the British media, and he's spoken eloquently about the need for Britain 'to come to terms with its history of labour but also its future'. Indeed, there are some who regret giving him the platform at all, as he seems to have gained many sympathisers. Some policy-makers suggest that these trials are best used to make examples of traitors, but others say that harsh penalties will only inflame the resistance further."
 uk.26.a: "Make sure the sentences are not harsh."
 uk.26.b: "They must all be made examples, including Horner."

 uk.27.t: "Protests Rage Against 'Show Trials'"
 uk.27.d: "As the syndicalist trials wind down, they've attracted a fair amount of protest from labour supporters - including the supporters Arthur Horner has only recently attracted. That the sentences handed out were fairly light seems to have taken the heat out of things, but even so these protests say the trials should not have begun in the first place. 'There is nothing they should apologise for!' read the signs. British police kept a close eye on the protests, though they did not escalate into violence."
 uk.27.a: "It never ends..."

 uk.28.t: "Old Bailey Bombed"
 uk.28.d: "Protests against the syndicalist trials have reached a fever pitch, with the labour supporters exploding with anger once the verdicts were read - guilty, on all counts, with Arthur Horner receiving no less than three consecutive life sentences. A riot outside the courtroom needed to be put down almost immediately, but even after it was suppressed the night exploded into more violence when a bomb went off at the Old Bailey. As the seat of the Crown Court, the Old Bailey is a symbol of the King's justice, and the symbolism of the bombing has been lost on no-one. Thankfully, the building was mostly empty at the time of the explosion, and few were injured."
 uk.28.a: "An ugly scene."

 uk.29.t: "The Question of Labour"
 uk.29.d.notinpower: "With the prospect of holding free elections looming, now the government must consider: when and if said elections occur, will the Labour Party be allowed to participate? Richard Crossman has presented himself in Parliament to make the case for the party, saying that while it did cooperate with the syndicalist government it also didn't have much choice. The Labour Party was never in a position of power in the Union of Britain, he says, and all it could do was to try and make things easier for the average citizen. The labour movement itself should not be punished. There are those who question Crossman's motives, and suggest that the party's collaboration with the Union is in itself criminal, but it's also clear that Labour has a huge amount of support. Banning it would prove difficult."
 uk.29.d.inpower: "With the prospect of holding free elections looming, now the government must consider: when and if said elections occur, will the Labour Party be allowed to participate? Richard Crossman has presented himself in Parliament to make the case for the party, though there are some who question why he was not placed under arrest. The Labour Party was in power in the Union of Britain, however briefly, and thus gave orders that led to the death of British citizens. Crossman claims that the party was simply doing its best in a difficult situation... and many British citizens agree. The Labour Party has a large amount of approval. Enough that there are those who say that banning the party would be disastrous."
 uk.29.a: "Pardon the Labour Party."
 uk.29.b: "Labour can stay, but its previous leadership must be tried."
 uk.29.c: "Ban the Labour Party."

 uk.30.t: "Massive Protests Rock the Country"
 uk.30.d: "Banning the Labour Party has not gone over well with the British public. Incidents of violence has soared, with several bombings having taken place in centres such as Birmingham and Liverpool, and some protests having escalated into violence. There is a general sense that this might be the tipping point towards a larger revolution, that 1925 might be happening all over again. The British military has been called in to assist the police in keeping the peace and, so far, it has not escalated further."
 uk.30.a: "Unsettling."

 uk.31.t: "The Returning Aristocracy"
 uk.31.d: "The British Exiles who have returned to the country only to find that their lands have been stripped and their former homes are now occupied are demanding that their property be returned. The problem, of course, is that the new occupants assumed ownership legally, according to the Union of Britain, so they say having their homes now stripped from them is unfair. There is a simmering resentment against the aristocracy who fled after the uprising in 1925, which is feeding into this growing conflict, and now the government is being called in to decide the matter once and for all."
 uk.31.a: "What was theirs should be restored, as it was illegally taken."

 uk.31.c: "The aristocracy will be compensated for their losses."

 uk.32.t: "Free Elections Announced"
 uk.32.d: "After several months of preparations, the provisional government has completed arrangements for the first free election in Great Britain since the liberation. The king has formally issued the writ for the 660 seats in the House of Commons, and the political parties have begun their campaigns. An excitement has spread throughout the country, as even those who have harboured doubts about the government's intentions now feel like freedom is truly at hand."
 uk.32.a: "How liberating!"

 uk.33.t: "The [GetYear] British Elections"
 uk.33.d: "At long last, the first British elections since the country's liberation are under way. One party is certain to collect the largest share of the seats in Parliament, and it will be..."
 uk.33.a: "The Tories!"
 uk.33.b: "The Liberals!"
 uk.33.c: "The Labour Party!"

 uk.34.t: "The Elections of [GetYear]"
 uk.34.d: "British citizens once again return to vote for the party which will rule over Parliament for the next four years. This election's primary winner is..."

 uk.35.t: "Free Elections Cancelled"
 uk.35.d: "An emergency session of Parliament was called today, with [CAN_king_full_name] in attendance. The Prime Minister laid before the king the evidence that the country is simply in too much turmoil for a restoration of democracy, and that a 'guided Parliament' was needed to rule for the foreseeable future - without the need for elections. [CAN_king_first_name] gave his consent, and with that the House of Commons voted to put Robert Vansittart in the Prime Minister's seat for at least the next five years. The news, once it was announced, was like a splash of cold water in the public's face. Riots and protests began almost immediately, and the British military was put on high alert as rumours of syndicalist militia movements were reported across the country."
 uk.35.a: "This won't be good..."

 uk.36.t: "The Night of Red Knives"
 uk.36.d: "The general uprising has been aided with attacks by syndicalist militias over the past week. These culminated in a fierce battle in the city of London today, as the militias attempted to take Buckingham Palace and kill [CAN_king_first_name] - in a move that would have shocked the country to its core, had it succeeded. Thankfully, by the time the morning had arrived, it was clear the syndicalists simply had neither the support nor the equipment to pull off their mission. The militias were broken and scattered, and while the anger in Britain has not appreciably dimmed, it is clear that there is going to be no repeat of 1925. Public order has held."
 uk.36.a: "That's a relief!"

 uk.37.t: "The Beveridge Report"
 uk.37.d: "The work of William Beveridge is complete - with much fanfare, he has submitted a report officially titled 'Social Insurance and Allied Services' to Parliament. In it, Beveridge lays out in detail the five so-called 'evils' that damage a harmonious society and stand in the way of rebuilding Britain: namely squalor, ignorance, want, idleness, and disease. It goes on to recommend the implementation of a social welfare state and a national health service to bring free health care to the masses. Needless to say, the Beveridge Report is extremely popular with the public, and we will have difficulty not implementing most of its recommendations."
 uk.37.a: "Some excellent ideas in there..."

 uk.38.t: "The Pigou Report"
 uk.38.d: "The work of renowned economist, Arthur Cecil Pigou, is complete - with much fanfare, he has submitted a report officially entitled 'The Restoration of Private Enterprise to British Society' to Parliament. In it, Pigou outlines a series of steps to fairly privatise British businesses out of the hand of trade unions but without turning all control back over to the wealthy. Most important in this step is monetary reform, including the establishment of a new system of interest-free credit issues through a new government banking agency. While the report is very popular with the government, it's received a lot of criticism from the public - with many declaring it will simply lead to a new system of inequality. The government has, however, so far dismissed these voices as belonging to syndicalist agitators."
 uk.38.a: "Some excellent ideas in there..."

 uk.54.t: "The Question of Syndicalist Recruits"
 uk.54.d: "Now that the British Army is back on its feet, there is a whole line of men waiting to enlist... or re-enlist, considering many of them once served in the Union of Britain forces. The question is: do we take those men back? Many of them were likely just doing as they were told, yes, but surely there are some syndicalist sympathisers among them. Can we risk the possibility of having them in our army?"
 uk.54.a: "We won't take on syndicalist soldiers, period."
 uk.54.b: "We'll take some, after careful screening."
 uk.54.c: "We need the manpower - take as many as want to re-enlist."

 uk.55.t: "National Arms Contract"
 uk.55.d: "There are numerous British companies vying for the national arms contract - the question is on what part of the army we wish to focus, as each company has different specialties. In the end, we feel the contract should be awarded to..."
 uk.55.a: "Webley & Scott"
 uk.55.b: "Birmingham Small Arms Company"
 uk.55.c: "Morris Motors"

 uk.56.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Requests Return of British Ships"
 uk.56.d: "As a consequence of the Syndicalist occupation of Britain it largely fell upon the [ROOT.GetAdjective] nation to maintain Britannia's rule of the waves, with many of Britain's fleets ending up under our command in the aftermath. With [FROM.GetNameDef] now liberated and finally beginning to retake its rightful place back on the world's stage, they have requested the return of these ships in order to place them once again under one unified command structure."
 uk.56.a: "Yes, it is time."
 uk.56.b: "We would rather keep them."

 uk.57.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Returns British Ships"
 uk.57.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government has approved of our recent request regarding the transferring of ships, and have placed their navies back under our command to be reorganised into new flotillas as needed."
 uk.57.a: "Excellent."

 uk.58.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Refuses to Return British Ships"
 uk.58.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government has rejected our recent request regarding the transferring of ships, arguing that it will be more effective if they remain under [FROM.GetAdjective] command for the time being."
 uk.58.a: "Oh well, they may have a point."

 uk.59.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Requests Formal Control of the [ROOT.GetFactionName]"
 uk.59.d: "Having elevated itself once more back to a global power, [FROM.GetNameDef] has requested that control over the Entente be restored to their leadership, putting them once more in charge of unified foreign policy and granting them control over the IEDC and ISAC."
 uk.59.a: "Of course, we welcome their renewed leadership."
 uk.59.b: "Their time leading it is over."

 uk.60.accepted.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Cedes Control of the [ROOT.GetFactionName]"
 uk.60.accepted.d: "Following discussions with the [FROM.GetAdjective] government and its military leadership the Entente has once again been placed under [ROOT.GetAdjective] control, including authority once more over the IEDC and ISAC. It once again falls upon us to guide our allies forward, now from our rightful home once more."
 uk.60.accepted.a: "Rule, Britannia!"

 uk.60.refused.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Keeps Control of the [ROOT.GetFactionName]"
 uk.60.refused.d: "Following discussions with the [FROM.GetAdjective] government and its military leadership, our request for the Entente to be placed back under our control has been scorned. It seems that they have decided that it would be more beneficial if it remained under their control for the time being."
 uk.60.refused.a: "The absolute gall..."

 uk.61.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Assumes Entente Leadership"
 uk.61.d: "Having restored its government and its military, [From.GetNameDef] has retaken its place as the leader of the Entente once more. British officials met with [From.From.GetAdjective] military leadership, in order to facilitate the transfer, and an elaborate ceremony was held in London whereby [CAN_king_full_name] thanked [From.From.GetNameDef] for its service and the sacrifices it made in getting the United Kingdom back to where it now stands."
 uk.61.a: "We welcome the British return."
 uk.61.b: "Let's hope it's better than last time."

 uk.62.t: "The Five Eyes Programme"
 uk.62.d: "[From.GetNameDefCap] have started an initiative which they call the Five Eyes Programme, one that would see the Entente work together to combine their espionage efforts. If the alliance members simply agree not to spy on each other, for instance, and to share all relevant data with each others' offices, that would make our efforts much more efficient."
 uk.62.a: "Let's make the effort."
 uk.62.b: "It's not worth it."

 uk.63.t: "The Imperial Preference Programme"
 uk.63.d: "Something that was in the works for years before the revolution, the Imperial Preference programme is intended to keep the countries of the Commonwealth more closely knit. As developing countries become more aggressive with their trade practices, we need to implement a system of free trade within the Commonwealth - both so we remain friendly trading partners, but also so that our markets are easy for other countries to penetrate."
 uk.63.a: "An admirable initiative!"

 uk.64.t: "The Imperial Preference Programme"
 uk.64.d: "The British government has approached us with a new initiative they are calling 'Imperial Preference'. It is something that was in the works for years before the revolution, intended to keep the countries of the Commonwealth more closely knit. As developing countries become more aggressive with their trade practices, the idea is that the programme will implement a system of free trade within the Commonwealth - both so we remain friendly trading partners, but also so that our markets are easy for other countries to penetrate."
 uk.64.a: "Yes, let's proceed."
 uk.64.b: "No, we don't need this."

 uk.65.t: "The British-French Relationship"
 uk.65.d: "The British and the French have had a long and fruitful relationship as part of the Entente - a relationship that leads back to the unfortunate results of the Great War, but which endured that hardship and led to both countries being restored to the positions they hold today. The British government has approached the French, hoping to do two things: one, to exchange any last territories that have been administered since the collapse of both countries following their syndicalist uprisings, and two, to renew the mutual agreement of friendship and cooperation as both nations head into the next phase of European history."
 uk.65.a: "Naturally."
 uk.65.b: "Of course we agree!"
 uk.65.c: "We're not interested in this"

 uk.66.t: "The French Refuse"
 uk.66.d: "Amazingly, the current French government has refused our simple proposal. Perhaps their idea of our relationship is different than we thought?"
 uk.66.a: "Why must the French be so bloody French?"

 uk.67.t: "The Fate of [return_state.GetName]"
 uk.67.d: "Now that [From.GetNameDef] is restored, they have approached the [Root.GetAdjective] government to ask about the return of [return_state.GetName] - which they say is properly [From.GetAdjective] territory."
 uk.67.a: "Of course they can have it."
 uk.67.b: "No, I think not."

 uk.68.t: "The Victoria Britannia"
 uk.68.d: "Today the British government completed construction on the Victoria Britannia - a 120-foot tall statue that rests on a hill over Halifax harbour, commemorating the Canadian victory over the Union of Britain which returned the British monarchy to the Home Isles. British Prime Minister [GetBritishExilePM] gave a speech to a large and enthusiastic crowd, commending the Canadian government and military and promising that [CAN.GetNameDef] and [GBR.GetNameDef] would forever hold a 'special relationship' that superceded all others. The ceremony ended with a minute of silence, honouring those that died during the British liberation, and a solemn promise from the prime minister that such efforts from their allies would never be needed again."
 uk.68.a: "We couldn't be more thankful."
 uk.68.b: "We appreciate the thought."
 uk.68.c: "A worthy moment."

 uk.69.d.allthree: "The British Parliament has debated a bill for several months now regarding the colonial dominions such as [CAN.GetNameDef], [AST.GetNameDef], and [SAF.GetNameDef] - all of which have been de facto independent since the collapse of the United Kingdom in 1926. With the government in [GBR.GetNameDef] restored, the dominions' legal status has now been answered by the declaration: former dominions are considered 'legally independent, free to seek out their own paths in the world whether that is in the Commonwealth or outside of it, as equals and partners to [GBR.GetNameDef] or otherwise.'

In that treaty, it was agreed that most of Ireland would become fully independent from the crown as a republic, but that the six counties of Northern Ireland would be given the right to remain within the Union as they so wished. When however Britain fell to the syndicalist menace, Northern Ireland were forced to accept entry into the republic for the sake of self preservation. Although we may have promised that we would allow this situation to continue after our restoration, we must consider if it is right to abandon Northern Ireland or stake our claim to it once more."

When however Britain fell to the syndicalist menace, Northern Ireland were forced to accept entry into the republic for the sake of self preservation. Now that the old order has rightfully asserted itself back over Britain, it seems only fitting that we assert said rule over the entire nation and seek the reinclusion of Northern Ireland back into the United Kingdom. We must however consider if any potential refusal by Ireland, and any nation that may come to its aid, will be worth the hassle, before any decision is made."
 uk.99.a: "The Loyalists in Ulster are our responsibility."

 uk.100.d: "With the United Kingdom having been restored across the pond, it has not taken long for their imperialists to begin warmongering once more. A message was sent this morning informing the government that, as per the Anglo-Irish Treaty, Northern Ireland is part of their nation and have requested the immediate withdrawal of all Irish state apparatus from the region, with the implicit threat of any refusal being potentially met with force. We now must consider how we can respond to such a message."

 uk.102.d: "Caught up in a dispute with [GBR.GetNameDef] over the status of Northern Ireland, [IRE.GetNameDef] has angrily left the [Root.GetFactionName]. They believe there is no protection to be had in an alliance that would hunger after the territory of its own members."

With the United Kingdom restored to the Home Isles, the question had remained whether the British would attempt to restore their rule over Northern Ireland once again, a question that has finally been answered in the firm negative. This means not only peace with the Irish, but a change of name and flag for the United Kingdom as it once again becomes the Kingdom of Great Britain."

Even so, the territory is primarily populated by over 20,000 Britons -- none of whom see the Spanish as their nationality. That won't matter the slightest to [gibraltar_owner.GetNameDef], of course, who would rather go to war with us than part with the territory now. It's not even about Gibraltar's vital role in controlling the entrance to the Mediterranean. To them, it's a matter of pride."

Even if the territory didn't play a vital role in guarding the entrance to the Mediterranean Sea, we would still have a responsibility to those people. Gibraltar's strategic position, however, means it's not likely something [gibraltar_owner.GetNameDef] is going to surrender lightly.

But following the death of his older brother to influenza in 1892, he was made Duke of York and second in line to the throne, ending his naval career. Having grown close during the shared period of mourning for his brother, George would marry Princess Mary of Teck, his brother's fiancé and so would begin a loving, if little publicly expressed relationship. But his world would once again be thrown into turmoil when in 1910 his father would die, and George was forced to ascend to the throne as King George V. George had taken power at a politically turbulent time with the rising temper of the Irish Home Rule movement and the Liberals' growing conflict with the lords. While the constitutional crisis would ultimately see the reform of the Lords and a civil war temporarily averted in Ireland, the world would be cast into the fires of war as the Great War broke out with a despondent George at the helm. Despite his attempts to appease British nationalism by abandoning his German titles and adopting the name Windsor, Britain's loss in the Weltkrieg caused the already growing republican movement to experience a steady uptick in support. After years of poor governance and politicking, the British Revolution would break out and amid his dithering refusal to intervene in the political crisis, the King would be forced to flee Britain into exile and watch his home, along with his Empire, tumble into the abyss.\n\nThe King-Emperor, as he styles himself still, has reigned over the British Empire, what's left of it, since his flight into exile. The loss of the Weltkrieg to his own cousin, the loss of his youngest son, John, and the final devastating loss of Britain itself have combined to break much of George V's spirit despite his unending resolve to maintain his stature. With his health having worsened since the flight to Canada, which George privately refers to as \"a frozen prison\", he has gradually lost any interest in participating in domestic affairs, delegating such ceremonial duties as he may to his son, Prince Edward. He now lives on to spend what little time remains with his family and perhaps one day, the return to Britain, but this prospect grows dimmer by the day...§!"

 GBR_edward_windsor_regnal: "Edward VIII"
 GBR_edward_windsor_desc_body: "The first son of King George V, Edward VIII was born in the outskirts of London, named such after this late uncle. With a traditional childhood and tutoring, the young Prince was initially destined for a military schooling in the navy, first at Osborne and then Dartmouth. While a course of two years and entry into the navy was planned, this was cut short following his father's ascension to the throne. Preparations to prepare Edward for future leadership were started in earnest, being sent to Magdalen College at Oxford, despite allegations of being underprepared intellectually, ultimately leaving Oxford after eight terms, without any academic qualifications. By the time of the Great War, Edward was of legal age to join and enthusiastically signed into the Grenadier Guards but was refused deployment to the frontlines in case the heir apparent be captured or killed. Nevertheless, he would travel to the frontlines as often as he could and undertook military flights from 1918 onwards, making him deeply popular among veterans for his eagerness to fight alongside them. But Edward would return to a country that was disillusioned by its defeat and suffering from economic depression, a fact Edward note on during his many tours of poverty-stricken areas of Britain to meet with local people and take on board their concerns. But despite his efforts to reach out to the common populace, Edward would be evacuated with his family to Canada in 1925 amid the British Revolution despite his proposal that he return to the frontlines to fight the syndicalist menace."

But following his father's death, Edward of Windsor was crowned in a lavish ceremony in Ottawa, with all the pomp and circumstance afforded to his forebearers. The young monarch, notably solemn upon his enthronement, inherited an Empire undoubtedly a shadow of its former glory, and a kingdom occupied by syndicalist revolutionaries. Undeterred, King Edward has already proven himself prone to meddling in politics with his own radical views and a man of lustful scandal on par with Oswald Mosley. But he maintains, above all else, the desire that the banner of the United Kingdom will one day proudly fly above the Home Isles and the Empire shall be restored to its glory...§!"

The Prince was relatively irrelevant up until the rise of his brother as King, being next in line for the throne.
