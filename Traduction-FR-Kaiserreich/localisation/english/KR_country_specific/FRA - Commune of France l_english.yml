### Ideas ###
 FRA_communard_spirit: "Communard Spirit"
 FRA_communard_spirit_desc: "We are the legacy of the Paris Commune, the first socialist state ever created and then brutally repressed by the Republican reactionaries. In 1920, the workers finally got their revenge and overthrew the military junta of the 'Party of Order'. We, sons and daughters of Communards must protect our state and our spirit, we will not be commanded by tyrants anymore!"

 FRA_to_war_idea: "Revanchist Rearmament"
 FRA_to_war_idea_desc: "Our nation must rise again if we are to defeat the Imperialists!"

 FRA_renseignements_generaux_lar: "Renseignements Généraux"
 FRA_renseignements_generaux_lar_desc: "The Renseignements Généraux serve as the eyes and ears of the Commune, gathering intelligence on both domestic and international threats to our proletarian dream. But the RG's mission goes beyond mere security. They are also responsible for promoting the values and principles of our socialist revolution, both at home and abroad. Through their intelligence gathering and analysis, they help shape our foreign policy and are the first deployed in our efforts to break the global chains of Capital.\n\nWith sympathisers in every factory still owned by the bourgeoisie, our networks are unmatched."

 FRA_economic_reforms_anar: "Economic Reforms"
 FRA_economic_reforms_anar_desc: "Wide-reaching economic reforms have been decided at the 1936 meeting of the Bourse Générale du Travail. These reforms have had noticeable effects on our economy already, helping making it more dynamic and solidifying it."

 FRA_economic_reforms_jaco: "Economic Reforms"
 FRA_economic_reforms_jaco_desc: "Wide-reaching economic reforms have been decided at the 1936 meeting of the Bourse Générale du Travail. These reforms have had noticeable effects on our economy already, helping making it more dynamic and solidifying it."

 FRA_economic_reforms: "Economic Reforms"
 FRA_economic_reforms_desc: "Wide-reaching economic reforms have been decided at the 1936 meeting of the Bourse Générale du Travail. These reforms have had noticeable effects on our economy already, helping making it more dynamic and solidifying it."

 FRA_calibrate_the_economy_idea: "Calibrated Economy"
 FRA_calibrate_the_economy_idea_desc: "As the world slowly approaches war again, we can rapidly capitalise on our healthy economy to rapidly switch parts of our economy to focus on military build-up. More factories are dedicated on arming our soldiers and building military structures, without any severe impact on our population."

 FRA_ruralism_idea: "Ruralism"
 FRA_ruralism_idea_desc: "The wide-reaching reforms to our industry and economy means than we no longer have massive industrial centres surrounding populous cities. This incidentally makes any attempt by enemy forces to cripple or even destroy our economy that much harder, with the biggest rural industrial centres far smaller and far more numerous than the great industry centres of Europe."

 FRA_collective_properties_idea: "Collective Properties"
 FRA_collective_properties_idea_desc: "Private property is incompatible with freedom of the individual. This, in theory, is a principle even Orthodox Syndicalists agree with us on. However, for decades the old capitalist city planning and public norms have been left mostly unchanged, it is now time to put an end to this. With the promotion of communal living practices and the consolidations of coops into common property, our society is bound to become more equal and less wasteful."

 FRA_mass_production_idea: "Mass Production"
 FRA_mass_production_idea_desc: "Factories have always had a serious advantage over the artisan. By chaining production tasks, they can produce in a small frame of time infinitely more product without nearly equal quality. Instead of trying to constantly reinvent that process, let's improve on it. We seek absolute efficiency in production to beat the German capitalists."

 FRA_modern_farms_idea: "Modern Farms"
 FRA_modern_farms_idea_desc: "Farms are often seen as an old, quaint detail of the national economy, but we know better. By modernising and mechanising the Commune's farmlands, we can massively increase our agricultural output and both speed up and optimise harvest, production, refining and delivery. To our civilians, and to our troops."

 FRA_war_economy_and_agriculture_idea: "War, Economy and Agriculture"
 FRA_war_economy_and_agriculture_idea_desc: "Pioneered by Sorelian economy minister Jacques Doriot, the concept of War, Economy and Agriculture is an interesting one. Claiming that a war with Germany is not only inevitable but fast approaching, the Sorelians demand a rapid conversion to an economy whose industry can not only sustain a war, but whose agriculture can sustain its soldiers. In sum, a sort of total war economy."

 FRA_technician_management_idea: "Technician Management"
 FRA_technician_management_idea_desc: "Too long have the Unions been left to manage the economy inefficiently without expert management. In order to put an end to economic chaos and ensure swift modernisation engineers, economists and other experts will be empowered to guide and veto union decisions when it comes to matters of the economy."

 FRA_sense_of_dedication_idea: "Sense of Dedication"
 FRA_sense_of_dedication_idea_desc: "French workers work for more than their pay, and they certainly do not work at gunpoint. Every can they seal, every brick they lay, every rifle they assemble, every tank they weld together, is a service to their country and the spirit of the Commune at large."

 FRA_industrialization_idea: "Communal Industrialisation"
 FRA_industrialization_idea_desc: "Pioneered by Jacobin economy minister Barthélémy Montagnon, Industrialisation is no strange concept to anyone in the Commune or abroad. This policy aims to rapidly increase the industrial capacity of France in order to catch up to our arch nemesis Germany. This is accompanied by a work culture and the creation of dedicated factory towns."

 FRA_working_women_idea: "Working Women"
 FRA_working_women_idea_desc: "For too long have women been suppressed by reactionary thinkers. Even under the French Republic, they selflessly supported the nation while our brothers were sent to the slaughter. It is time for us to recognise their contribution to society, and formalise the rights of the working woman, in peace and war."

 FRA_bhartiya_support: "French Military Support"
 FRA_bhartiya_support_desc: "We are receiving military support from our French allies. This selfless assistance will prove critical to defeating the reactionary Princely Federation and the imperialist Dominion of India. In time, we hope to repay France for their help, but for now we must focus on the task at hand."

 FRA_amenagement_du_territoire_idea: "Aménagement of the Territory"
 FRA_amenagement_du_territoire_idea_desc: "France has historically been a very centralised country, meaning that most of the development has been limited to industrial cities and population centres. We have funded large projects to ensure that all parts of our territory are developed to a satisfactory manner."

 FRA_plan_prost_idea: "Plan Prost"
 FRA_plan_prost_idea_desc: "Henri Prost's plans for highways linking the Paris suburbs has proved to be popular across the country. Many other municipalities like Lyon or Marseille have also signed up to the plan, and projects are already being drawn for a large highway network linking all of France's major cities together, from Lille to Toulouse."

 FRA_paramilitary_gendarmes: "Paramilitary Gendarmes"
 FRA_paramilitary_gendarmes_desc: "The Gendarmes are a fine organisation, a paramilitary police force capable of both civilian and military activities. While many have pushed to completely disband them, we will instead expand their activities to make them a parallel force to the Federal Police."

 FRA_secret_police: "Secret Police"
 FRA_secret_police_desc: "There are still many enemies of the Commune inside the Commune, sometimes even inside positions of power or within the military. This push for transparency is dangerous, we must instead organise secret police operations to ensure the safety of the French people from internal influences."

 FRA_demo_surete: "Sûreté Populaire Démocratique"
 FRA_demo_surete_desc: "We cannot allow paranoia to lead to the destruction of the fine balance we achieved with the Sûreté Populaire. By democratising the organisation, we will ensure that the French respect the Police not by fear but by an understanding of their actions and goals, and by knowing that they serve them first and foremost."

 FRA_hawkish_renseignements: "Revolutionary Renseignements"
 FRA_hawkish_renseignements_desc: "The Renseignements Généraux must ensure our safety from reactionary enemies abroad. Simple counter-espionage is not adequate, we must be ready to spy on enemy countries and support socialist movements across the world. A good offence is the best defence."

 FRA_peace_renseignements: "Protective Renseignements"
 FRA_peace_renseignements_desc: "The Renseignements Généraux must ensure the safety of our country above all else. Counter-espionage is the centrepiece of an effective national defence, and there are many enemies that wait for a moment of weakness to influence and rile up our population."

 FRA_peaceful_revolution_idea: "Peaceful Revolution"
 FRA_peaceful_revolution_idea_desc: "The international socialist Revolution will come, but it will be civilised. With the main reactionary powers in Europe finally shattered and their workers liberated, we aim to encourage further uprisings by merely proving the superiority of Syndicalism to the whole world."

 FRA_revolutionary_spirit: "Revolutionary Spirit"
 FRA_revolutionary_spirit_desc: "The survival and prosperity of the socialist world will only be ensured when the last reactionary bastion is terminated. We must stand ready to mobilise and shatter every reactionary government across the world. One day, the Internationale will extend across all seas and continents!"

 FRA_socialist_education_idea: "Socialist Education"
 FRA_socialist_education_idea_desc: "The education of the youth is one of the greatest goals that a country like the Commune may face. Luckily, the old education system of the Republic was already revolutionary for its day, giving us a good basis for the new one. A socialist education system, focused on the sciences and arts."

 FRA_international_avant_garde_idea: "International Avant-Garde"
 FRA_international_avant_garde_idea_desc: "A united socialist art style, from art to music, could be a powerful tool that will help masses in the non-syndicalist world get interested in our ideals - through entertainment."

 FRA_efficient_industry_idea: "Efficient Industry"

 FRA_tech_ski_infantry: "Alpine Combat Training"

### Focuses ###
 commune_of_france_focus: "Commune of France Focus Tree"

 FRA_amenagement_du_territoire: "Aménagement du Territoire"
 FRA_amenagement_du_territoire_desc: "Our territory is vast and unequally developed, some rural regions having been left behind while others prosper and grow at spectacular rates. We must encourage local initiatives and consider ambitious infrastructure projects to solve that problem on a local and national level."
 FRA_hydroelectricity: "Hydroelectricity"
 FRA_hydroelectricity_desc: "Our mountainous regions in the Alpes and the Massif Central have plenty of high flow rivers, a perfect environment to install a clean and lasting source of energy and revitalise the backwards, rural mountainous regions of the Commune."
 FRA_improve_the_electrical_network: "Improve the Electrical Network"
 FRA_improve_the_electrical_network_desc: "Thanks to the recent success of our efforts to expand hydroelectrical power generation, we can now use cheaper electricity to further boost our industrial capabilities. Renovating the electrical networks in order to ensure good distribution of this newfound surplus is a perfect first step."
 FRA_office_des_chemins_de_fer: "Office des Chemins de Fer"
 FRA_office_des_chemins_de_fer_desc: "A Congress meeting over the status of France's infrastructure at the BGT showed the disorganisation of our rail system and how backwards it became. The Congress agreed on the need to create a new office specifically tasked with the development and maintenance of our railways to connect all the parts of France together."
 FRA_mining_expansion: "Mining Expansion"
 FRA_mining_expansion_desc: "The economic and infrastructural development of the regions of the Alpes and the Massif Central allows for a greater exploitation of the mineral resources available there. Our prospectors discovered new mineral deposits and we are now ready to start exploiting them on an industrial scale!"
 FRA_plan_prost: "Plan Prost"
 FRA_plan_prost_desc: "The engineer and urbanist Henri Prost came up with a plan to develop highways around the Parisian region to link the outlying suburbs. This idea is receiving widespread support and the BGT decided to fund new projects to expand highways through the Commune. The communes of Marseille and Lyon also asked him to draw highway plans for their cities."
 FRA_autoroutes: "The Autoroutes"
 FRA_autoroutes_desc: "The highways proved a massive boon to the economy and worker mobility in urban regions, now an ambitious plan has been put forward to expand them to the whole country! Linking every corner of our country will have a massive impact on our regional development and can only benefit the Revolution."

 FRA_direction_of_the_economy: "Direction of the Economy"
 FRA_direction_of_the_economy_desc: "Our economy is fairer to the workers and generally quite potent while reactionary economies live and die on the whims of capitalists, but internal conflicts have prevented us from steering our economy. It is time to call for a meeting of the BGT, so that these questions are once and for all settled by one the Commune's faction."
 FRA_orthodox_syndicalism: "Orthodox Syndicalism"
 FRA_orthodox_syndicalism_desc: "The course set since the revolution has been reaffirmed. This orthodoxy has proven effective, and with a bit of fine-tuning can be even more so."
 FRA_reduce_unemployment: "Reducing Unemployment"
 FRA_reduce_unemployment_desc: "Beyond the Rhine, unemployment is at an all-time high, we must ensure that the French worker will always have a job to feed his family. In this simple task of providing our people with the fruit of their sustenance, we prove our inherent superiority to the capitalist economies and their constant crises."
 FRA_worker_designer_cooperation: "Worker-Designer Cooperation"
 FRA_worker_designer_cooperation_desc: "By increasing the cooperation between the scientists and engineers behind designs and concepts and the workers who actually build them, we will rapidly improve our production techniques. This also allows us to quickly train and educate our workforce to new techniques, by letting the designers directly teach the workers about them."
 FRA_improve_management_of_unions: "Improve Management of Unions"
 FRA_improve_management_of_unions_desc: "The Unions have for long been directing the economy, but they have some gaps and loopholes in their rules that can be exploited, leading to disastrous results for our economy. However, we will not question the place of the unions in our country. Instead, we will tighten management and rewrite some work codes."
 FRA_sense_of_dedication: "Sense of Dedication"
 FRA_sense_of_dedication_desc: "The worker has to realise that he is working for the greater good of the Commune and the French people as a whole. He must feel invested in his work at all times, and it is this way that we will improve our national spirit and our productivity. No need for whips or oppressive business owners."
 FRA_factory_towns: "Factory Towns"
 FRA_factory_towns_desc: "Our plan to rapidly expand the Commune's industrial base can be supported by the establishment of new factory towns, cities specially designed to provide housing and modern commodities to them and their families, while making sure they live close to their workplaces."
 FRA_communal_industrialisation: "Communal Industrialisation"
 FRA_communal_industrialisation_desc: "Barthélémy Montagnon is the new economy minister of the Commune. A Jacobin, he is a proponent of Communal Industrialisation. While our country has always been one of the modern economies of Europe, we cannot yet compare to the Ruhr Valley. Only by ambitious industrial base expansion can we hope to measure to Germany."
 FRA_technician_management: "Technician Management"
 FRA_technician_management_desc: "Too long have the Unions been left to manage the economy inefficiently without expert management. In order to put an end to economic chaos and ensure swift modernisation engineers, economists and other experts will be empowered to guide and veto union decisions when it comes to matters of the economy."
 FRA_war_economy_and_agriculture: "War Economy and Agriculture"
 FRA_war_economy_and_agriculture_desc: "Jacques Doriot is the new economy minister of the Commune. A Sorelian, he is a proponent of his 'War, Economy and Agriculture' theory, calling for a rapid conversion to a war economy along with an ambitious development of the agriculture. Should the German reactionaries attack, we will certainly have a use for the rifles and the bread."
 FRA_modern_farms: "Modern Farms"
 FRA_modern_farms_desc: "Farming has been a staple of civilisation since ancient times, and yet it has profoundly changed in just one century. Recent tools like tractors allow a single farmer to harvest fields in a single day that would have required dozens of farmers and a week in the past. Let's mechanise our farms, to put more food in our platters and our rations."
 FRA_war_industry: "A War Industry"
 FRA_war_industry_desc: "Despite rising animosity from Germany, our economy is still mostly dedicated to the production of civilian goods and is not suited for a major war. We need to develop our production of arms and equipment if we are to defend the Commune against external threats efficiently."
 FRA_mass_production: "Mass Production"
 FRA_mass_production_desc: "Our enemies are many, and our army is quite large as a result. This army needs a lot of equipment, and this clearly puts a strain on our factories. We must search new ways to improve our production of small arms through both design and manufacturing, without cutting corners."
 FRA_worker_self_management: "Worker Self Management"
 FRA_worker_self_management_desc: "Daniel Guérin is the new economy minister of the Commune. An Anarchist, he is a proponent of further self management for the working class and will implement new measures to fight off bureaucratisation within the unions."
 FRA_decentralized_industry: "Decentralised Industry"
 FRA_decentralized_industry_desc: "Our industry is currently concentrated around Paris and major communes, but the people don't live only in Paris, Lille or Lyon but everywhere in France. We must put all efforts into developing all the regions of France so that our entire country prospers."
 FRA_collective_properties: "Collective Properties"
 FRA_collective_properties_desc: "Private property is incompatible with freedom of the individual. This, in theory, is a principle even Orthodox Syndicalists agree with us on. However, for decades the old capitalist city planning and public norms have been left mostly unchanged, it is now time to put an end to this. With the promotion of communal living practices and the consolidations of coops into common property, our society is bound to become more equal and less wasteful."
 FRA_ruralism: "Ruralism"
 FRA_ruralism_desc: "The life of the peasant is the best life known to man, but the need for an industrial economy made this life impossible for most of the French people. We can, however, still encourage this lifestyle by bringing their factories and workplaces to the countryside, ending the tyranny of mass urbanisation."

 FRA_road_to_war: "The Road to War"
 FRA_road_to_war_desc: "The war with Germany is clearly inevitable, this nation holds hostage our brothers in Alsace and Lorraine, and with its many puppets in the Reichspakt it stands as the main counter-revolutionary power in Europe, if not the world, tyrant over hundreds of millions of people. This will stop, we will avenge them all. The first World War was not the last."
 FRA_renseignements_generaux: "The Renseignements Généraux"
 FRA_renseignements_generaux_desc: "It has become clearly obvious that we cannot defend our country in a satisfactory manner without a modern, centralised intelligence agency. The taboos of old still hold against such centralised, unscrutinised authority, but it is a sacrifice we have to make. German spies laugh softly at our pitiful 'intelligence committees'."
 FRA_military_buildup: "Military Build-up"
 FRA_military_buildup_desc: "To prepare for the upcoming war, we will need to develop our war industry rapidly and efficiently. This may damage our short term economic growth, and this may not be popular for those in our populace who hope for peace and prosperity, but we sadly know better. The survival of the Revolution is at stake here!"
 FRA_calibrate_the_economy: "Calibrating the Economy"
 FRA_calibrate_the_economy_desc: "The capitalist world is still struggling with last year's shattering economic crisis whilst the righteousness of our own system continues to prove itself. It has been suggested that we utilise this industrial advantage to transform certain aspects of the economy exclusively towards military purposes."
 FRA_socialist_education: "Socialist Education"
 FRA_socialist_education_desc: "The education of the French Republic was in many ways excellent, allowing the average citizen to obtain a large knowledge in the sciences and arts. We seek to continue working on this legacy by ensuring that French schools always have learning and education as their primary goal, not hierarchy and discipline like in some reactionary countries."
 FRA_vanguard_of_the_revolution: "Vanguard of the Revolution"
 FRA_vanguard_of_the_revolution_desc: "Those still struggling under capitalist oppression look to us with great hope, as the great beacon, the beating heart of the Revolution. We must do anything in our power to help those breaking the chains, it is our historical duty. Ideological and material support are one thing, but we must go further and be directly involved in the armed struggle: Frenchmen will fight throughout the world for the freedom of all workers, and triumph, just like we triumphed here."
 FRA_department_revolutionary_ideals: "Department of Revolutionary Ideals"
 FRA_department_revolutionary_ideals_desc: "While the empirical teachings prove themselves easily, the virtues of the Commune are harder to communicate to our population. While ominous sounding, we must create an institution ready to help us remind to our people the value of the Revolution and prevent reactionary influences from implanting themselves."
 FRA_curie_research_institute: "Curie Research Institute"
 FRA_curie_research_institute_desc: "While some nations resist the teachings of science, France endorses them without nuance. Let's support the establishment of a new research institute aimed at furthering our technological superiority. Where reactionaries doubt every discovery and stand wary of change, we embrace them and become stronger every year!"
 FRA_industrial_mobilisation: "Industrial Mobilisation"
 FRA_industrial_mobilisation_desc: "Our economy is now well developed and the Federation is ready for war, but we can always do better. By encouraging further industrial projects, the Commune shall not only be ready for war but will indisputably be superior in every way to any of our enemies. We will prove to the world that the Revolution will not be defeated!"
 FRA_military_science: "Military Science"
 FRA_military_science_desc: "France is always working on improving its research networks, but theoretical sciences can only bring us so far. We will open a new wing in the Blanqui research institute dedicated to military science, allowing us to fund and develop new breakthroughs that will be immediately put to use by our army."
 FRA_synthetic_chemistry: "Synthetic Chemistry"
 FRA_synthetic_chemistry_desc: "France is great and resourceful, but it does not have everything. Oil, rubber, tungsten and chromium are all lacking and we must not rely on foreign exporters when conflict comes. We must research new ways to acquire these resources from what we already have. Some scientists even suggest we may be able to engineer those resources."
 FRA_electric_machines: "Electric Machines"
 FRA_electric_machines_desc: "While computing traces back to the tabulating machine, we have since made massive breakthroughs in the field of computing. Our mathematicians already assure use that those new machines are of a tremendous help for rapid and efficient calculus. Given some patronage and time, we can only imagine the possibilities of this new field."
 FRA_damocles: "The Damocles Project"
 FRA_damocles_desc: "Inspired by the Cambridge Conference during the Tenth Congress of the Third Internationale, a reunion took place today at the University of Cambridge. A group of theoretical physicists from Britain and France are requesting funding for the establishment of the 'Damocles Project', a joint British-French committee for nuclear research."
 FRA_zoe_project: "Zoé Project"
 FRA_zoe_project_desc: "While the Damocles Project held great promise, the refusal by [ENG.GetNameDef] to take part crippled the cooperation between our scientists and theirs. Regardless, we must persevere and try to figure out what uses we can make of the atom. We will dedicate this project to the very woman who discovered Radium and set us on this path."
 FRA_fortify_the_german_border: "Fortify the German Border"
 FRA_fortify_the_german_border_desc: "We have already built a fairly impressive network of fortifications along the Meuse River and the border with Flanders-Wallonia. Regardless, we can improve it with new constructions and cutting-edge military installations like radio stations and modern artillery guns. Something the Republic would have never bothered to do, surely."
 FRA_extend_the_line: "Extend the Line"
 FRA_extend_the_line_desc: "While we have mostly focused our fortification efforts on those segments of the line that are the most defensible, it is quite obvious that Germany will target our weaker points instead. The solution is quite simple, we will not have weak points. Least they learn how to walk on water, good luck for them to cross this line!"
 FRA_demand_haute_savoie: "Demand Haute-Savoie"
 FRA_demand_haute_savoie_desc: "The illegal Swiss occupation of Haute-Savoie has gone on for far too long! The Swiss have shown themselves brutish tyrants and oppressors of our people on our own rightful land! No-one can have the audacity to persecute and hunt down Frenchmen and think they may get away with it, the perfidious Swiss have made their last mistake."
 FRA_liberate_iberia: "Liberate Iberia"
 FRA_liberate_iberia_desc: "Right at our southern border, just across the Pyrenees, capitalism and imperialism still persists. With our efforts, we will achieve what no French imperialist could - total control of Iberia. But we are different. We do it for the common people, not imperial ambitions. Syndicalism will succeed in Iberia!"
 FRA_take_down_germany: "Take Down Germany"
 FRA_take_down_germany_desc: "The French people shall wait no longer! The time has finally come - the Revolution shall prevail, and our brothers will be avenged for what they have been put through in the Great War! Germany will just wish they had lost the first war, for we will stop at nothing until they are utterly destroyed!"
 FRA_the_red_danube: "The Red Danube"
 FRA_the_red_danube_desc: "The Danubian peoples have proven their incapability to commence a successful socialist revolution in their country and liberate themselves from the Habsburg tyranny. We shall assist them, then. Likewise, all the peoples still under the tyranny of this anachronistic empire will be freed. Europe will be free of the last of the reactionary empires."
 FRA_flank_the_rhineland: "Flank the Rhineland"
 FRA_flank_the_rhineland_desc: "The Lowlands of the Benelux are strategically vital to our war efforts. The Germans will not expect the attack from this side and if we succeed, we will cut Germany off from its vital economic areas in the Rhineland. Germany will fall."
 FRA_world_revolution: "World Revolution"
 FRA_world_revolution_desc: "With the Revolution now well established in Europe, we can start to look outwards and launch a formidable plan to liberate the whole world from the reactionaries and imperialists. Our struggle will end once the last of them is tried before the people for their crimes. Vive la République Socialiste Mondiale!"
 FRA_european_revolution: "European Revolution"
 FRA_european_revolution_desc: "While the idea of a World Revolution is noble, we have to stay realistic. With smart influence and no other reactionary power to oppose us, we shall soon see the other continents convert to Syndicalism. However, we must ensure that Europe is free of reactionaries. Vive la République Socialiste Européenne!"
 FRA_peaceful_revolution: "Peaceful Revolution"
 FRA_peaceful_revolution_desc: "We hear those who claim that the Revolution cannot end, and it will not. However, we cannot afford to constantly wage war in all corners of the world without cause. The workers will find their way as we act as a beacon of desires. Let us focus on ourselves instead. Vive la République Socialiste Française!"

 FRA_the_congress_of_the_internationale: "The Congress of the Third Internationale"
 FRA_the_congress_of_the_internationale_desc: "Heads of Socialist, Syndicalist, and Totalist parties, Heads of State and Governments, Foreign Ministers and journalists have all arrived in Paris for the opening of the Ninth Congress of the Third Internationale. We are proud to once again host the Congress and humbly hope to use it to reinforce our position as the leading socialist country in the world."
 FRA_mission_to_india: "Mission to [HND.GetNameDef]"
 FRA_mission_to_india_desc: "[HND.GetNameDefCap] asked for our support in their struggle against its neighbours, the Lahore imperialists and the Princely Federation reactionaries. They ask of us that we send military advisors to train their officers and their troops. We will ensure this aid arrives rapidly, so that they may unite India faster."
 FRA_arab_committee: "Socialist Anti-Colonial Committee"
 FRA_arab_committee_desc: "The traitors of the French people, bastard Petain and his clique of friends, use the native proletariat in efforts to return to the mainland. We won't give them such a chance. Our Algerian comrade Mohamed Saïl, living in France, proposed to us the idea of supporting socialist liberation movements across all of Africa, for the good of all Africans."
 FRA_working_women: "Working Women"
 FRA_working_women_desc: "During the Congress, Helen Crawfurd took the stage with her flaming speech about the women's role in the World Revolution. We supported her arguments and now we are ready to implement common sense reforms regarding the status of working women in our society. The reactionaries can gawk, we will surely have the last laugh."
 FRA_international_avant_garde: "International Avant-Garde"
 FRA_international_avant_garde_desc: "For too long have traditional arts and classical music dominated the entertainment of the masses. While Jazz is enjoyable and widely popular in our countries, one genre cannot fight against all others. We have to create new ones, we have to show the world, what the real entertainment is. And it will show to the world that we are the good force of this era!"
 FRA_second_inter_congress: "The Tenth Internationale Congress"
 FRA_second_inter_congress_desc: "With the Second American Civil War raging on, as well as a number of other conflicts ready to break out at any time across the world, the Internationale has to consider its approach towards the Global Revolution. Since the last Congress of the Internationale took place in France, this next one will take place in Britain."
 FRA_scientific_cooperation: "International Scientific Cooperation"
 FRA_scientific_cooperation_desc: "It is clear that we cannot simply keep our own technological discoveries to ourselves. During a meeting at the old university of Cambridge, we decided to establish a worldwide plan to combine the technological advances of Socialist countries. Some however, call for a more ambitious plan, including industrial investment."
 FRA_third_inter_congress: "The Victory Congress"
 FRA_third_inter_congress_desc: "The responsibility of holding the Eleventh Congress has once again fallen back to us, with the new site chosen for the task being the Palace Populaire, where the Louvre once stood full of the plunders of the French Empire. Fittingly, one of the topics at hand concerns finally liberating the African continent."

 FRA_found_the_phalanstere_international: "Found the Phalanstère International"
 FRA_found_the_phalanstere_international_desc: "The need for secrecy necessitates certain inefficiencies in military research. By working closely with other syndicalist nations and allowing researchers access to others' most closely guarded secrets, this fundamental issue can be overcome. The Phalanstère International shall serve as the central authority for the exchange of such secrets."

 FRA_integrate_the_corps_francs: "Integrate the Corps Francs"
 FRA_integrate_the_corps_francs_desc: "The Corps Francs, our commando troops, proved their worth in the Great War and the revolutionary events of the past decades, breaking impossible stalemates through sheer will and heroism. Infiltration and neutralisation, opening a breach for our regular forces: only the bravest of braves are willing to take the risks of such missions, and we need this fervour in the coming confrontations with the Revolution's ennemies."

 FRA_the_riflemans_friend: "The Rifleman's Friend"
 FRA_the_riflemans_friend_desc: "We invent every day new ways of slaughter, and so we might forget that no matter how advanced our machines of death, it is not them that triumph, that conquer, that advance, but man. In the end, it all still comes down to a man and his weapon. Each soldier is a worker for the Revolution, and he must be able to trust that his tools are best suited for his grim but necessary task. "

 FRA_eyes_on_the_ligne_bleue: "Eyes on the Ligne Bleue"
 FRA_eyes_on_the_ligne_bleue_desc: "The 'Blue Line', the Vosges, named after the beautiful morning hue of the venerable mountains, is our frontier with German imperial-junkerism. Our way to peace and victory lies in the vales and forests of the range, towards our brothers in Alsace, our comrades of the Ruhr. We cannot allow the enemy to choose the field of battle, we must push, attack, take the fight to him, surprise him even through impassable terrain.  "

 FRA_reform_the_high_command: "Reform the High Command"
 FRA_reform_the_high_command_desc: "Our Federal Forces have for too long been suspected of counter-revolutionary sympathies, and this has hindered organisational reforms. A safe high-command was deemed preferable to an efficient high-command. This stagnation cannot be allowed to continue, or France, already at a disadvantage in the coming fight with Reaction, will never be able to defend the proletariat's burning torch. Adaptability and discipline will be our goal."

 FRA_all_for_the_revolution: "All for the Revolution"
 FRA_all_for_the_revolution_desc: "The decisive factor in warfare will always be will. Will to triumph, will to fulfil our History-ordained destiny. We will win because we must, because the French people has been tasked with saving civilisation from bourgeois rot. We will win because facing us are mere slaves of Capital, not free men fighting to break the chains. They may have Krupp steel, but we have the united will of the proletariat: victory is certain."

 FRA_our_comrades_fight_too: "Our Comrades' Fight, Too"
 FRA_our_comrades_fight_too_desc: "In the coming armed struggle against Capital, we are not alone: not only can we count on our allies, but in every nation, in every factory, the worker hopes for our victory, await his liberation. Some will go further, throw off their chains and join us here, and we will assemble a grand international army of free proletarians to assist our forces. What could the enemy do against our combined might?"

 FRA_levee_en_masse: "Levée en Masse"
 FRA_levee_en_masse_desc: "When our elders in Revolution were threatened by Reaction, they mobilised the entire Nation to defend its newly won liberty. Young men fought, women bandaged their wounds, children and elders preached the creed of Liberty. We must first match their fervour in the mobilisation of the masses, and then we will go further. We fight for Liberation, for the new economic age, no cause is more deserving of our sacrifices."

 FRA_the_methodical_war: "The Methodical War"
 FRA_the_methodical_war_desc: "This century has killed the daring charge, the heroic last stand. If there was any doubt, the Great War has proved this beyond a doubt: warfare is now a question of planning, of timetables, of logistics, of charts. War is a purely materialistic question. If we want our stand to defend the Revolution to be successful, we must not seek vainglory but intellectual and material supremacy over the forces of Capital. "

 FRA_an_armys_stomach: "An Army's Stomach"
 FRA_an_armys_stomach_desc: "A great enemy of the Revolution once said "an army marches on its stomach". He was then defeated, not by braver men or superior tactics, but by stretched supply lines. He did not take his advice to heart, and so History left him behind. We will not make the same mistake, our mission is too important. The comrade-soldier will fight, will triumph, and will be well-fed, well-clothed, and well-armed, the whole way."

 FRA_principe_de_concentration: "Principe de Concentration"
 FRA_principe_de_concentration_desc: "France has the best artillerymen in the world, we have proved this in many a campaign, and will prove it again in the next. Our perfectly timed, superbly executed barrages will sweep away the armies of Capital, destroy the fortresses of Reaction, and blast the way open for our men, to Berlin and beyond! There is only one queen that we will abide by, and it is she, Artillery, Queen of the Battlefield."

 FRA_aero_terrestrial_integration: "Aero-Terrestrial Integration"
 FRA_aero_terrestrial_integration_desc: "A single decisive punch, through the enemy lines, that's all it takes. A lucky breakthrough? We only believe in what we can see, luck will have nothing to do with it. We need perfect coordination between our forces, and we will relentless drill it into our men. Air power will soften up our targets, artillery will blow them away, armour and infantry will mop up whatever meagre resistance a serf of the Kaiser can muster to being liberated."

 FRA_supremacy_of_movement: "Supremacy of Movement"
 FRA_supremacy_of_movement_desc: "We must face the facts: the enemy outnumbers us, and dwarves us in industrial might. We have with us the international brotherhood of workers, but a plan to negate Capital's advantages couldn't hurt. And for that, we must be daring, the next war cannot be one of positions, it must be over before they know what has happened to them. Advance, envelop, encircle, crush, to the end of the Earth, until we are free."

 FRA_la_petite_reine: "La Petite Reine"
 FRA_la_petite_reine_desc: "The "Little Queen", the bicycle: our ennemies might scoff, but this quintessential object of the workers' life will be an instrument of our triumph. When our troops outflank theirs, discreetly infiltrate their lines, quickly advancing only powered by proletarian might, we shall see who laughs last. Their vehicles will breakdown, run out of gas, will be confined to roads: ours will fly across the countryside."

 FRA_overrun_capitals_front_lines: "Overrun Capital's Front Lines"
 FRA_overrun_capitals_front_lines_desc: "If we want to overwhelm the enemy and negate his advantages, we must be quick, our troops must cross vast expanses in hours, days at most. Embrace the future: entire divisions, supplies, artillery and all, not chained to the limited energy of Man and Beast, but effortlessly carried by machines, ready to fight at a moment's notice. This is a new age, the age of motors: production has been revolutionised, warfare soon will be too. "

 FRA_the_modern_comrade_soldier: "The Modern Comrade-Soldier"
 FRA_the_modern_comrade_soldier_desc: "Gone are the days of militiamen with a red armband, a Lebel, and a dream of Revolution. The modern comrade-soldier is perfectly trained, drilled, equipped to deal with all that the coming conflict will throw at him. His officer are not the tyrants of yesterday, they are united in one common purpose, one common will, and they too have been tirelessly studying the Great War and the various revolutionary conflicts that followed."

 FRA_expand_the_fusiliers: "Expand the Fusiliers"
 FRA_expand_the_fusiliers_desc: "There remains a secondary but nonetheless concerning counter-revolutionary threat across the Mediterranean Sea. Shadows of their former selves, the men we once called brothers, the Exiles, await the killing blow of History, their captives calling to us in despair. When the opportunity comes, we will have to land in Algiers, and so we need to revitalise our traditions of marine infantry, to act as first glorious wave of liberation upon the African continent."

 FRA_corps_francs_hunters: "Corps Francs Hunters"
 FRA_corps_francs_hunters_desc: "Our commandos have achieved tremendous successes in action, first to break whatever desperate defences Capital foolishly mounted. Tip of the spear of Revolution, it must be ever sharper. And so this elite of elites will be further reinforced, trained, tirelessly working until enemy commanders turn tails at the mere possibility of their presence on the battlefield."

 FRA_deepen_the_fog_of_war: "Deepen the Fog of War"
 FRA_deepen_the_fog_of_war_desc: "There is no greater power, no greater advantage in warfare than knowledge. We will know the enemy's every move and obscure our own, making him pounce at shadows before stabbing him in the back. This won't be difficult: everywhere we advance, we are in friendly territory, the workers awaits us; everywhere we are pushed back, revolutionary solidarity will sabotage their efforts at secrecy. The enemy will question his sanity as he is swept away."

 FRA_chasseurs_portes: "Chasseurs Portés"
 FRA_chasseurs_portes_desc: "Rapid deployment is critical, both to reinforce everywhere the enemy attacks and to push through any break in the front. For this purpose, we will assemble specialised mobile infantry troops, ready to respond to any situation that arise in the coming revolutionary war, and to act as wedge tearing apart resistance."

 FRA_corps_du_genie_militaire: "Corps du Génie Militaire"
 FRA_corps_du_genie_militaire_desc: "Our engineer corps has a long and proud history, supporting French might across Europe and across the globe, shattering apart any resistance. Whether they come from the Polytechnique School or have risen up the ranks, our combat engineers take us across rivers, shelter us safely behind defences, and blow apart the enemy's. With further training and ever more advanced tools, they will continue to act as the backbone of our forces."

 FRA_rapid_response_detachments: "Rapid Response Detachments"
 FRA_rapid_response_detachments_desc: "The many are one, revolutionary warfare means that sacrifice must be made, but this cannot mean that the lives of our comrades is thrown away. Especially when France must face ennemies with a demographic advantage. Rapid treatment, experienced doctors and dedicated nurses, efficient deployment of reinforcements: we will do everything in our power to minimise casualties, and to prevent a wound to be the end of one's commitment to the Revolution."

 FRA_legacy_of_the_grande_batterie: "Legacy of the Grande Batterie"
 FRA_legacy_of_the_grande_batterie_desc: "Our forefathers conquered through the might of artillery, slowly honing their craft. We are the inheritors of more than a century of such traditions, and we will write down our own glorious chapter, reducing to rubble all that stands in the way of Progress, in the way of the People. Witness us, artillerymen of yesteryears; take note, our descendants: the triumph of the Revolution comes from the barrel of the cannon."

 FRA_precise_fire_control: "Precise Fire Control"
 FRA_precise_fire_control_desc: "Red rolling thunder will fall upon the ennemies of the working class. Perfect coordination between our artillerymen will wash away any resistance standing against us, a barrage technique already perfected during the Great War but that will now serve us faithfully and be adapted to the new battlefields of revolutionary conquest. We are the best in our field but could always be better, for we serve the most important cause."

 FRA_dual_purpose_howitzers: "Dual-Purpose Howitzers"
 FRA_dual_purpose_howitzers_desc: "Our engineers are hard at work to take ever further the science of dispersing threats to the Revolution. Their latest find is another proof, if one was ever needed, of French ingenuity: cannons that can be converted for both anti-aircraft and anti-armour action, to accompany our troops and respond to their every need."

 FRA_comrade_estiennes_heritage: "Comrade Estienne's Heritage"
 FRA_comrade_estiennes_heritage_desc: "General Estienne, a hero who revolutionised forever the battlefield. Against a hierarchy set in their ways, which wasted in doomed offensives the infantryman's life, he carried the torch of armoured warfare and earned his nickname of "Père des chars", Father of the Tanks. They were the instrument of triumphs in the latter stages of the Great War, that sadly could not be transformed into victory: the Revolutionary War will prove their usefulness again."

 FRA_proletarian_knights: "Proletarian Knights"
 FRA_proletarian_knights_desc: "The cavalry of past centuries might be on its way out, but its spirit shines brightly. Knights, hussars, dragons, the mantle of their bold and glorious legacy has been taken up by a new cavalry, motorised, armoured, heavily armed, but still charging and sowing terror in the enemy's heart. Yesterday, the serf was shut out of serving on horseback, today it is the proletarian who has the mechanical know-how to operate the beasts of modernity."

 FRA_chars_du_futur: "Chars du Futur"
 FRA_chars_du_futur_desc: "Armour is a quickly advancing field: from artillery on shaky tractors twenty years ago, we are getting ever closer to future tanks able to turn the tide of battles by themselves, if not the war herself. Whether they act as support for our infantry or point of the sword we drive into the heart of Capital, they are revolutionary. And so we cannot allow ourselves to fall behind in terms of either technological or strategic developments."

 FRA_the_battlefields_new_queen: "The Battlefield's New Queen"
 FRA_the_battlefields_new_queen_desc: "Artillery will always have our hearts, but we must admit that there she has a rival for title of Queen of the Battlefield: armour. She has already proven herself invaluable in recent conflicts, and we know that she will only get more crucial as technology and tactics advance. However, we have no need to choose between our loves: artillery will blast open the way, armour will sweep away the enemy, and our true mistress, Revolution, will triumph."

 FRA_mobile_fortresses: "Mobile Fortresses"
 FRA_mobile_fortresses_desc: "We will simply crush Reaction under the infatigable threads of our armour, advancing as the tide, slowly but surely, unstoppable. Reaction will throw all that it has towards our mobile bastions, and we will laugh heartily at its desperate attempt at hindering the march of the proletariat. After all, there is no rush, Clio is on our side, the outcome of this eternal war is pre-ordained."

 FRA_overwhelming_firepower: "Overwhelming Firepower"
 FRA_overwhelming_firepower_desc: "The feeble attempts of the slaves of Capital to hold back the might of the free workers will be blown apart by our armoured cavalry. Fiercely, we advance, rightfully, we push on to Berlin, until the Kaiser bows to the humblest seamstress of the Internationale and begs for our forgiveness. We cannot tolerate for even a second more to see our comrades in chains, and so we cannot slow down in our attacks: armour will furiously pierce through."

 FRA_restructure_the_marine_federale: "Restructure the Marine Fédérale"
 FRA_restructure_the_marine_federale_desc: "We must admit that the Federal Navy has seen better days, Revolution and the loss of France's ultramarine territories have hurt our naval forces. If we want to triumph against the Algiers regime and effectively assist our British comrades on the seas, a heavy-handed rearmament program as well as a re-examination of our strategic priorities is needed urgently."

 FRA_shipbuilding_union_expertise: "Shipbuilding Union Expertise"
 FRA_shipbuilding_union_expertise_desc: "Our arsenals are filled to the brim with talented workers, some who have worked for decades in the shipbuilding trade, and thus know every crook and cranny of every vessel. Their expertise could too easily be overlooked: their unions' federation must play an integral role in our re-armement programme, working in tandem with the Federal Navy. We are still lagging behind, but will make up for it with proletarian ingenuity."

 FRA_expand_toulon_arsenal: "Expand Toulon Arsenal"
 FRA_expand_toulon_arsenal_desc: "As the foremost base of our Mediterranean forces, Toulon is without contest our most important military port, kept busy by the constant threat posed by reactionary presence in Corsica and frequent confrontations with Algiers' navy. If we want to affirm our supremacy over the sea, and one day go on the offensive, the infrastructures of Toulon must be expanded."

 FRA_refurbish_atlantic_bases: "Refurbish Atlantic Bases"
 FRA_refurbish_atlantic_bases_desc: "Our naval bases facing the Atlantic, chiefly situated in Brittany, are moribund: attention is turned to the South, and the Channel and the Ocean are guarded by the British. This shameful complacency cannot continue, we too must be able to go toe to toe with the Kaiser and his satellites at sea. Dockyards and submarine bases will be modernised, and we will convert to military use some of the local shipbuilding industry."

 FRA_red_fleet_old_school: "Red Fleet, Old School"
 FRA_red_fleet_old_school_desc: "If we want to reconquer our naval standing, a grand fleet is necessary, one that can stand proudly next to our allies'. Large, powerful ships will impose the people's will on the seas, beautiful prowesses of French engineering and shipbuilding, armed with the most impressive naval gunnery French ships have carried."

 FRA_the_aeronavales_day: "The Aéronavale's Day"
 FRA_the_aeronavales_day_desc: "It's obvious to us now that large, lumbering ships are the obsessions of naval officers with something to prove or make forget. Let the   leviathans painfully move into position, a swam of planes will welcome them. They won't know what hit them, and will be at the bottom of the Channel before they realise that unwieldy colossuses make for great target practice."

 FRA_meute_tactics: "Meute Tactics"
 FRA_meute_tactics_desc: "We have a lot of catching up to do, starting at clear disadvantage against our main enemy's navy. A situation the French Navy knows well, sadly. What we lack in tonnage, we will make up for in bravery, and cunning: undersea corsairs will hunt down ships as a pack. Soon enough, the Kaiserliche Marine will be too afraid to leave its ports, haunted by the shadows of our sea hounds."

 FRA_the_peoples_lance: "The People's Lance"
 FRA_the_peoples_lance_desc: "France was a pioneer in advances of submarine technology, it's up to us to renew this glorious legacy. Submariners are the daring anti-heroes of this century's naval war, feared, respected, hated. Some particularly idealistic or conservative officers still cling on to outdated notions for the development of our navy, they will have to get used to the new paradigm: no tactic is too dirty in the fight against Capital."

 FRA_the_noose_around_capitals_neck: "The Noose around Capital's Neck"
 FRA_the_noose_around_capitals_neck_desc: "Imperialist powers are reliant on trade, on the product of exploitation from their colonies. Without, they wither and die. We will do our proletarian duty and speed up that process, enacting a total blockade against the ennemies of the Revolution. Helped by our allies, we will slowly but surely strangle the Empires, until they beg for mercy and liberation."

 FRA_peoples_shield_and_broadside: "People's Shield and Broadside"
 FRA_peoples_shield_and_broadside_desc: "Ultimately, it's still all about cannons. Bigger guns, better guns, more easily manoeuvrable, manned by dedicated sailors who won't hesitate to put their lives on the line to defend their floating fortresses against threats. Advancements in both our main and anti-aircraft gunnery will ensure that our fleet can reign unimpeded."

 FRA_colonnes_de_neptune: "Colonnes de Neptune"
 FRA_colonnes_de_neptune_desc: "Across the seas, reactionary threats still lurk. Marine infantry will be crucial in dealing once and for all with these remnants of an outdated system, to deal the mercy kill. Our marines' legacy is tainted by colonialism: they will wash away their units' sins by forging a new glorious history as the first red wave of righteous popular retribution landing on the beaches of imperial capitalism."

 FRA_close_naval_coordination: "Close Naval Coordination"

In the November of 1919, a revolutionary General Strike was called by the CGT, paralysing the country and causing the downfall of the bourgeois government.

 comfrance.1.t: "A New Flag for the Federation?"
 comfrance.1.d: "The question of the federal flag has stood out as a point of long-standing disagreements since the revolutionary days. The red flag, of course, had always been the flag of the proletariat, the flag of the martyrs, the flag of the barricades, and many argued that the Revolution should only fly these colours, a proud declaration of war against the bourgeoisie: proletarians have no motherland, after all. However, even though the Tricolour had not been the flag of revolutionary enthusiasm for decades and had degenerated into being merely the flag of the bankers' republic, the flag of the Versaillais of 1871, many felt too attached to it to let it go. Part of the socialist movement, particularly within the SFIO, had long sought to reconquer this flag from the hands of the bourgeois and give it back the same vigour it had when the People faced the monarchs of Europe at Valmy and triumphed. Or they simply worried that abandoning the Red, White and Blue would be too much of a provocation to the world, and to our compatriots who had not fully become comrades just yet.\n\nAnd so a compromise was found, much like in every aspect of the Revolution. The Tricolour was conserved, but was defaced with the symbols of the proletarian struggle, of the workers, of the mutineers, and was always flown alongside the red flag. With our victory in the latest elections, we have been given a popular mandate to finally settle this debate: should we keep the compromise of 1920 and the defaced Tricolour, forge a new, redder compromise flag, or simply enshrine the Red once and for all?"
 comfrance.1.a: "Forge a new compromise, forward towards revolutionary renewal!"
 comfrance.1.b: "Red! The workers need nothing more and deserve nothing less."
 comfrance.1.c: "Too many have laid their lives for the Tricolore, no need to retire it."

 comfrance.5.t: "The Fall of Marceau Pivert"
 comfrance.5.d: "Despite the successful organisation of the Syndicalist Congress in May, the Pivert administration has been criticised for its lack of response to the crackdown on trade unions in Germany. Today, the opposition in the Bourse Générale du Travail has agreed to a vote of no confidence in Pivert, who has announced that new elections will be brought forward to elect a new Comité. His duties will be temporarily assumed by the Comité de Salut Public until the last results come in."
 comfrance.5.a: "Goodbye, Camarade Pivert."

 comfrance.6.t: "Election Day 1: Clarifying the Federal Army"
 comfrance.6.d: "Due to the presence of unions within the Federal Army, it has become overly politicised, creating tensions within the guarantor of federal integrity and the arm of the Revolution! This has resulted in the incumbent Chief of Staff, the popular civil war general Maurice Gamelin, having to step down. The French Syndicalist military leaders, mostly Sorelians, have decided to ask the soldiers who they wish to lead the French army, before definitely dissolving the military unions. Each strategic school of thought is associated with a different faction, and so this choice too will have political consequences."
 comfrance.6.a: "André Boris (Orthodox) - A Storm of Shells."

 comfrance.7.t: "Election Day 2: The Renseignements Généraux"
 comfrance.7.d: "Due to its key purpose over external and internal security matters, the position of Director of the Comité de Renseignements Généraux is recognised as one of the keys to supreme power in the Commune of France, and is crucial for the destruction of political rivals. It could be a terrible weapon in the hands of one of the extremist factions, Jacobins and Sorelians..."

 comfrance.8.t: "Election Day 3: Internal Security"
 comfrance.8.d: "Orthodox Charles Rappoport has resigned his post of Delegate for Internal Security to compete for the Foreign Affairs post. Former Chairman Marceau Pivert, still hoping to preserve his political future, has managed to get endorsed by the Orthodox wing, and is now grappling for the post with the stern Jacobin Max Bonnafous, Sorelian Jean-Marie Clamamus, and the anarchist Maurice Joyeux."

 comfrance.9.t: "Election Day 4: Economic Affairs"
 comfrance.9.d: "Today's election seems to be a plebiscite on the Commune's economic policy implemented in recent years. Many visions of the future Syndicalist economy, more or less concentrated on industry or agriculture, are in competition. All of them are crucial for the future final struggle against Germany..."
 comfrance.9.a: "Benoît Frachon (Orthodox) - Orthodox Syndicalism."

 comfrance.10.t: "Election Day 5: Foreign Affairs"
 comfrance.10.d: "With the final election day, one of the leading issues of the Commune of France is raised: diplomacy, which carries the double task of spreading the Revolution throughout the world and preparing for revenge against Germany. If the very existence of the Syndicalist Internationale is not in danger yet, the future theatres of the World Revolution will be defined today..."
 comfrance.10.a: "Charles Rappoport (Orthodox)-Internationalism."
 comfrance.10.b: "Marcel Déat (Jacobin)- European Socialism."
 comfrance.10.c: "Pierre Comert (Sorelian)- Civilisational War."
 comfrance.10.e: "Fernand Desprès (Anarchist)- World Revolution."

 comfrance.12.t: "The Results: Orthodox Majority"
 comfrance.12.d: "Even if many saw in this election the fall of the Orthodox-led consensus that has ruled the Commune since the death of Emile Pouget, they have managed to secure a firm majority in the election.\n\nThe Orthodoxes are now looking towards the Russian émigré Boris Souvarine, who unlike Pivert, is seen as both strong enough to keep the radical factions in line and capable of leading the Commune to its final glory!"
 comfrance.12.a: "Congratulations, Camarade Souvarine."

 comfrance.13.t: "The Results: Jacobin Majority"
 comfrance.13.d: "The elections have finally put the Jacobins in power, permitting the return of Republican values to lead the Commune to the World Revolution! The Syndicalist structures are now in Jacobin hands as Sorelian partisans are chased, exiled or gunned down. Now, the newly established Union Socialiste Française will have to choose between the party theoretician Marcel Déat and mayor of Bordeaux Adrien Marquet to lead France!"
 comfrance.13.a: "Congratulations, Camarade Déat."
 comfrance.13.b: "Congratulations, Camarade Marquet."

 comfrance.14.t: "Marcel Déat Succeeds Pierre Monatte"
 comfrance.14.d: "During the inauguration ceremony of the new Comité de Salut Public at the Bourse Générale du Travail, the new Chairman of the CSP has asked to its BGT counterpart Pierre Monatte to resign, arguing that the alliance with the Anarchists was no longer corresponding to the vows of the Commune. The old man accepted with reluctance, thus consecrating the Jacobin complete takeover of the Commune. Marcel Déat was eventually elected."
 comfrance.14.a: "Vive la Révolution!"

 comfrance.15.t: "The Results: Sorelian Majority"
 comfrance.15.d: "The elections finally gave power to the military faction of the Commune of France, staunch followers of the revolutionary theories of Georges Sorel, and eventually destroying their old Jacobin foes, who are now victims of a bloody purge throughout the country. A new age has begun in French politics, after the weaknesses of the Orthodox era..."
 comfrance.15.b: "Congratulations, Camarade Valois."

 comfrance.16.t: "Pierre Monatte's Resignation"
 comfrance.16.d: "During the inauguration ceremony of the new Comité de Salut Public at the Bourse Générale du Travail, BGT Chairman Pierre Monatte has announced he would propose its resignation to its CSP counterpart Georges Valois, considering he was too old to assume political duties, even purely nominal, and that the incoming challenges for the Commune of France would require younger leaders. The solution now lays in Valois' hands..."
 comfrance.16.a: "Merge the positions of Chairmen of both the BGT and the CSP."

 comfrance.17.t: "The Results: Anarchist Majority"
 comfrance.17.d: "The elections have finally given power to the Anarchists, meaning that the French people has understood that the Revolution has entered a new phase and that younger minds are needed for guiding the nation. The most restrictive government structures have been dismantled, heralding a new era for libertarian Socialism throughout Europe."
 comfrance.17.a: "Congratulations, Camarades."

 comfrance.18.t: "The End of the Chairmanship"
 comfrance.18.d: "As the Anarchists have been swept to power during the last elections of the Commune and the Revolution Progresses, it has become obvious that reform must come to the highest positions as well. While previously the power of the Chairman was not unlimited, having one person lead the Commune is obviously a restrictive, bourgeoisie concept. It is a spit in the face of the ideas represented by the victorious Anarchists, who prefer a more communal leadership style."
 comfrance.18.a: "Abolish the position, it's time for collective leadership!"

 comfrance.19.t: "Pierre Monatte's Resignation"
 comfrance.19.d: "During the inauguration ceremony of the new Comité de Salut Public at the Bourse Générale du Travail, BGT Chairman Pierre Monatte has announced he would propose his resignation, as many claimed that the internal division within the executive branches of the Commune was the primary cause of the political crisis. The two favourites to succeed him are the trade unionist Léon Jouhaux and the civil war veteran Benoit Frachon."
 comfrance.19.a: "Léon Jouhaux becomes Chairman of the Bourse Générale du Travail."
 comfrance.19.b: "Benoît Frachon becomes Chairman of the Bourse Générale du Travail."

 comfrance.20.t: "No Majority Found After the Elections"
 comfrance.20.d: "After three days of verification, it's now official: no firm majority has been found from the last elections. Pierre Monatte, the Bourse Générale du Travail Chairman, has announced that he and the Assembly would elect a new Chairman itself to lead a compromise cabinet, and also to avoid deeper internal struggles between Jacobins and Sorelians."
 comfrance.20.c: "Monatte and Pivert form a compromise government."

 comfrance.22.t: "Camarade Blum's Call for Solidarity with Spain"
 comfrance.22.d: "As civil war ravages the Iberian peninsula, stories of white terror storm across the Pyrenees, horrifying our populace. Throughout the Commune, spontaneous gatherings and congresses have convened to gather funds and materials for our Spanish comrades to show the unwavering support offered to the CNT-FAI.\n\nAt such an event, Orthodox delegate, Leon Blum, has delivered a powerful speech urging the government to press on its support for the Spaniard workers and peasants by uniting in an international people's front against reactionaries and monarchists. This 'Popular Front' speech has been widely praised for its eloquence and solid socialist conviction. Monsieur Blum's fame as a public speaker has certainly been improved."
 comfrance.22.a: "Most eloquent, camarade."

 comfrance.25.t: "The Damocles Project?"
 comfrance.25.d: "Inspired by the Cambridge Conference which took place during the Tenth Congress of the Internationale, in May 1937, another somewhat secret reunion took place for the last weeks at the University of Cambridge.\n\nA group of theoretical physicists from Britain and France, led by Norman Feather, Frédéric Joliot-Curie and Francis Perrin, are discussing the possibilities of radioactivity and nuclear fission and its uses - from electricity generation and medical applications to powerful strategic weapons. The participants are requesting funding for the establishment of the 'Damocles Project', a joint British-French committee for nuclear research."
 comfrance.25.a: "Establish the Damocles Project!"
 comfrance.25.b: "We won't waste money on such absurdity!"

 comfrance.26.t: "Establishment of the Damocles Project"
 comfrance.26.d: "The government of [FROM.GetNameDef] has accepted our offer regarding the creation of the joint Damocles project. This grand undertaking will allow us to spread syndicalism to the entire world!"
 comfrance.26.a: "Excellent!"

 comfrance.27.t: "Britain Refuses to Cooperate!"
 comfrance.27.d: "The government of the Union of Britain has refused our offer regarding the creation of the joint Damocles project. We'll have to lead this alone."
 comfrance.27.a: "Dammit!"

 comfrance.28.t: "La Troisième Internationale"
 comfrance.28.d: "The Third Internationale was founded in 1921, in the aftermath of the revolution. Our forefathers fostered within the organisation a pluralist, big tent attitude: anarchists, communists, socialists, syndicalists, pacifists, anti-colonialists, even some social democrats were convened, in the hopes of rebuilding the foundations of the global proletarian movement, battered by the war years. Every year, then every few years, we have held congresses to discuss and direction the direction of the socialist struggle. We are proud to say we will soon be ready to hold the ninth edition of these meetings, right here, in and around Paris. More than a simple conference, this shall be a grand celebration of the struggle for proletarian liberation!"
 comfrance.28.a: "The Congress will be held a week after May Day!"

 comfrance.29.t: "The Ninth Congress of the Third Internationale"
 comfrance.29.d: "It is time to invite the Socialist and Syndicalist leaders who will be coming from all around the Globe to attend the Ninth Congress of the Third Internationale."
 comfrance.29.a: "Send out the invitations!"

 comfrance.30.t: "The Third Internationale"
 comfrance.30.d: "France has gone through with its designs to hold the Ninth Congress of the Third Internationale and we, as expected, have received an invitation. It would be foolish not to send a delegation."
 comfrance.30.a: "Better start packing!"

 comfrance.41.t: "All of the Delegates Have Arrived"
 comfrance.41.d: "After months of feverish preparation, the Ninth Congress of the Third Internationale has opened in Versailles. People from all over the world convened to help coordinate the efforts of the socialist movement. Parties affiliated with the Internationale, as well as some sympathisers and observers, were invited to send representatives and hundreds made the sometimes arduous journey to be closest to the beating heart of the proletarian Revolution. Though the Internationale has in theory no relation to the French and British governments, representatives from these foremost socialist nations will certainly enjoy a position of informal seniority among their peers, elders in the global liberation of the labouring class."
 comfrance.41.a: "A warm welcome to our comrades!"

 comfrance.42.t: "Inaugurating the Congress"
 comfrance.42.d: "The inaugural session of the Ninth Congress of the Third Internationale took place in the Versailles palace, clad for the occasion in crimson banners adorned with socialist symbols and slogans. Given the honour of pronouncing the introductory speech, father of the British revolution George Lansbury pointed out the irony of convening proletarian forces in what was once the centre of the autocratic monarchy, proof if any was needed of the unstoppable march forward of the Revolution. A grand speech followed, thanking the delegates, evoking the revolutionary successes of recent years and rousing spirits for the coming struggle. In his closing remarks, Lansbury invited the delegates to join him in a minute of prayer, to which a French voice promptly responded “Like hell we will!”, leading to a few moments of agitation in the audience. The old man was nevertheless abundantly applauded, and the representatives separated into various discussion groups and committees."
 comfrance.42.a: "The Ninth Congress of the Third Internationale is hereby opened!"

 comfrance.421.t: "The Internationale Shows its True Face"
 comfrance.421.d: "The Reds are clearly set to spread their poison as they have clearly shown during last session of Internationale! We must be prepared for anything...!"
 comfrance.421.a: "We must be ready..."

 comfrance.43.t: "Syndicalism in Spain"
 comfrance.43.d: "Joaquín Ascaso Budriá has taken the stage and elaborated the position of the CNT-FAI in Spain for the Congress. The CNT-FAI is the largest Syndicalist party in Spain, made up of Anarcho-Syndicalists, moderate Syndicalists and trade unionists. The Spanish revolutionaries have seen a White Terror, violent counter-revolutionary actions taking against the workers, first-hand. They have come, asking for support for their cause when the moment comes. A resolution to support the efforts of the Spanish proletarian forces was unanimously voted, with cries of “¡Viva la Revolucion!” echoing in the halls of Versailles."
 comfrance.43.a: "Our Iberian comrades can count on us!"

 comfrance.45.t: "White Terror"
 comfrance.45.d: "We heard Joaquín Ascaso Budriá speak of White Terror horror stories that have been coming out of Madrid and Barcelona, and Kurt Eisner, Bavarian Socialist wanted to delve deeper into the topic of White Terror and he was given the floor. After hearing more stories that have come out of Germany, Austria, Hungary, Russia and Finland, the Congress members were ready to make their decisions."
 comfrance.45.a: "Another reason we must end the Capitalist system of murder and robbery."

 comfrance.47.t: "In the Heart of Capital, Too"
 comfrance.47.d: "American delegate John 'Jack' Reed gave a passionate speech: a journalist by trade, one of the first Americans to report on the Russian and French revolutions, he later entered the political fray himself. Now a well-respected voice in the movement, he has announced his bid in the 1936 presidential election for the SPA. Despite criticism at home and abroad that this would draw him towards reformism, the prospect of seeing a staunch socialist at the helm of the United States is too enticing for any fellow delegates to voice much concern, and Reed was given a warm welcome by the Congress. In his speech, he detailed the current situation in the United States: the Great Depression, now dragging on for years, has thrown American workers and farmers into atrocious conditions, leading to a rapid rise in radical politics, made worse by the German crash. The labour movement grows ever more powerful, the SPA is rapidly gaining ground in political institutions, and proletarian forces are holding strong against police repression and Longist reactionary militias: an opportunity seems bound to reveal itself."
 comfrance.47.a: "The red flag will fly on Wall Street!"
 comfrance.47.b: "Offer support for Reed and his comrades."
 comfrance.47.c: "We can't yet risk hostility with America."

 comfrance.50.t: "Hopes in Latin America"
 comfrance.50.d: "A joint event by Latin American comrades was held next. South and Central America have in recent years been at the forefront of the socialist struggle. Primary victims of American interests, exploited ceaselessly by international Capital, held down by petty dictators puppet of this or that 'Yanqui' lobby, the masses of the Americas have had enough. Every day more workers join the struggle of this frontline of imperialism, and if we are to believe our comrades the entire continent is one push away from Liberation. A packed audience listened eagerly to heroic tales of Patagonian revolutionaries, latest updates from the still fresh Nicaraguan revolution or stories from veterans of the Mexican Revolution, which inspired the whole of Latin America. Delegates from other nations, like Brazil or Cuba, gave detailed presentations on the state of the proletarian struggle in their own countries, with many feeling very much optimistic for their prospects in the coming years."
 comfrance.50.a: "Begin to nurture Syndicalism in Latin America."
 comfrance.50.b: "We should build Syndicalism elsewhere, we must rank our priorities."

 comfrance.51.t: "Women's Role in the Worldwide Revolution"
 comfrance.51.d.FRA: "Today the British feminist, Helen Crawfurd took the stage with a flaming speech about the women's role in the World Revolution. According to her arguments, without women's participation in industry and armed forces, it may be impossible to defeat the many enemies of the proletariat. However, heeding this call is likely to cause some disturbances among the more 'conservative' elements of the society."
 comfrance.51.d.other: "Today the British feminist, Helen Crawfurd took the stage with a flaming speech about the women's role in the World Revolution. According to her arguments, without women's participation in industry and armed forces, it may be impossible to defeat the many enemies of the proletariat. While our delegation agrees wholeheartedly with her message, some fear that it is yet too early to really push the issue of women's liberation and that formally affirming the speech is but a needless domestic disturbance."
 comfrance.51.a: "Participation of working women is necessary to achieve the World Revolution."
 comfrance.51.b: "A brave woman, but we shall not respond."

 comfrance.52.t: "Women's Role in the Worldwide Revolution"
 comfrance.52.d: "Yesterday Helen Crawfurd took the stage with her flaming speech about the women's role in the World Revolution. According to her arguments, without women's full participation in the struggle, it may be impossible to defeat the many enemies of the proletariat. Tempting as it may seem, the political climate in Britain is not ready for such decision - we need to wait for the Congress of Trade Unions in the fall to force the matter."
 comfrance.52.a: "So it be then."

 comfrance.53.t: "Support For the Risorgimento"
 comfrance.53.d: "Today is an opportunity for our representatives at the Congress of the Third Internationale to put forward their case forward to request international support for our reunification efforts. The Foreign Minister believes French support for Risorgimento could be vital for its success due to the potential for Austrian involvement."
 comfrance.53.a: "Ask for support to achieve the Risorgimento!"
 comfrance.53.b: "There are more important issues at hand."

 comfrance.54.t: "Policy on the Italian Peninsula"
 comfrance.54.d: "Delegates from the Socialist Republic of Italy appeared before the Congress, making the case of supporting the Republic in its efforts to reunify the Italian Peninsula in the face of the traitors beyond the Po, the Sicilian Kingdom and their theocratic vassal in Rome. Involvement in Italy could prove beneficial in spreading the Revolution, but could lead to conflict with the reactionary Austrian Empire responsible for protecting the regime in Milan."
 comfrance.54.a: "Guarantee our friends in Torino aid when the time comes."

 comfrance.55.t: "The World Economic Crisis and the Third Internationale"
 comfrance.55.d: "With the Berlin Stock Market Crash, mass unemployment has arisen in Europe and South America and trade unions have begun to grow in both as a result. French and British governments held highly secretive talks, and slowly, but surely one realisation came to all: now might be the hour, now might be the moment, a tremendous effort must be undertaken. However, what exactly this tremendous effort would be proved controversial and when the Congress finally reassembled for a voting session, debates lasted well into the night, with positions ranging from issuing a mere condemnation to calls for immediate armed struggle.\n\nUltimately, it was decided that a framework for deeper international collaboration would soon be established under the auspices of the Third Internationale and socialist great powers. Help towards the development of socialist economies, greater economic integration, research and development programs, as well as permanent international cooperation councils would help the world's free nations act as one to prepare for the final struggle. Simultaneously, initiatives to more concretely support socialist efforts in capitalist nations would be undertaken, both openly and covertly. Naturally, details would still be left for governments to fill in, but the proposal was approved almost unanimously. Only one thing was left to vote on, the name of this initiative. A French delegate proposed the 'Phalanstère', in homage to the harmonious and self-sustaining communities established by utopian socialist Charles Fourier, a proposal which proved instantly popular: by building this International Phalanstère, the workers of the world will soon conquer the utopia they have earned."
 comfrance.55.a: "A decisive opportunity!"

 comfrance.56.t: "The State of Indian Socialism"
 comfrance.56.d: "As the congress approaches its end, young Jawaharlal Nehru takes the floor to explain the precarious state of our revolutionary government. In his speech, he strongly called for international support in building a people's army to rival our enemies in Lahore and Hyderabad."
 comfrance.56.a: "We need international support in organising our army!"
 comfrance.56.b: "No, we're fine as we are."

 comfrance.57.t: "The Bharatiya Commune Asks For Support"
 comfrance.57.d: "The Bharatiya Commune asked for support in their struggle against its neighbours - the Dominion of India and the Princely Federation. They would like us to send military advisors to train their leaders and their troops."
 comfrance.57.a: "Send military advisors to train their army!"
 comfrance.57.b: "We can't waste our resources."

 comfrance.58.t: "Comrade Saïl Mohamed Wants To Speak"
 comfrance.58.d: "Comrade Saïl Mohamed, a prominent Algerian socialist, was allowed to speak before the assembled Congress. He has given a rousing speech on the situation in Morocco and French Africa where Arab labour is abused and exploited for the benefit of the wealthy and the colonial establishment. Sail urged the Congress to put an immediate stop to the situation. He proposed a creation of the Socialist Anti-Colonial Committee that will work to supply local syndicalist anti-colonial conspirators in North Africa."
 comfrance.58.a: "We'll gladly support the creation of the Committee."

 comfrance.59.t: "The End of the Ninth Congress"
 comfrance.59.d: "The Ninth Congress of the Third Internationale has finally come to an end. Rich in events and emotions, having reinforced once again the cohesion of the international socialist movement and set its course for the immediate future, it could only be called a success. The final vote of the delegates concerned the location of the next congress, and though many cities were proposed it was ultimately decided that it would take place in London, the other great socialist capital. Many delegates came forward to deliver their final remarks and thank their comrades.\n\nWhen they come home, the delegates will have to grapple with the consequences of one of the greatest event since the revolutions, certainly an opportunity for decisive action. But before that, a ceremony was organised to properly send them off. On the Montmartre hill, birthplace of the 1871 Commune of Paris, a great performance open to the public was given, showcasing the best French artists, regional costumes and traditions, as well as athletic feats and technological innovations. It was followed by an immense banquet of dishes from all around the Commune for the many delegates, which lasted until well into the night. Of course, the guests concluded this experience of joyful socialist unity in the only way it could have: by proudly singing the 'Internationale'."
 comfrance.59.a: "And tomorrow the Internationale will be the human race!"

 comfrance.61.t: "The Syndicalists' First Move"
 comfrance.61.d: "The Reds are meeting to coordinate their activities, which are definitively aimed against the order we have established in Europe following our victory in Weltkrieg. We must watch this meeting and analyse its results closely!"
 comfrance.61.a: "Watch them!"

 comfrance.62.t: "Red French Military Support"
 comfrance.62.d: "After our delegates at the Ninth Congress of the Third Internationale requested military support for organising the Indian revolutionary army, the Union of Britain and Commune of France decided to dispatch senior military officials and experts to educate our foremost officers. Hopefully, this cooperation will yield beneficial results on the battlefield!"
 comfrance.62.a: "The Red Army shall put these comrades to good use!"

 comfrance.63.t: "The Rise of the Socialist Anti-Colonial Committee"
 comfrance.63.d.NFA: "Our counter-intelligence specialists have noted a recent surge of Syndicalist activity in our country. We know that the Commune of France, together with the Union of Britain, has established an Anti-Colonial Committee in the Internationale. This committee, with the help of Mohamed Saïl, a traitor of the Algerian people living in France, is coordinating the efforts made by the Syndicalists in supporting anti-colonial sentiments in our African holdings.\n\nThe Syndicalist powers have sent significant amounts of weapons and material to support the native rebels. They have also opened a few training camps in their southernmost parts of the country. While the more oblivious politicians in our country believe that nothing will come out of this, our generals warn us that we have to be wary."
 comfrance.63.d.GER: "The word has spread. The Commune of France, alongside other members of the Internationale, has established a Socialist Anti-Colonial Committee. The Committee aims to support the cause of Arabs and Africans in liberating their homelands from the hands of the colonial powers, particularly the remnants of the French state.\nThis body will coordinate the Syndicalist powers' actions in North and West Africa. Our intelligence reports show that a small influx of Egyptian left-wing radicals who want to fight for the revolutionary cause are also arriving on French territory. While we are not at war with the Commune of France or any Syndicalist country for now, we should be very cautious."
 comfrance.63.d.OTT: "The word has spread from German agents in France. The Commune of France, alongside other members of the Internationale, has established a Socialist Anti-Colonial Committee. The Committee aims to support the cause of Arabs and Africans in liberating their homelands from the hands of the colonial powers, particularly the remnants of the French state.\nThis body will coordinate the Syndicalist powers' actions in North and West Africa. As much as colonial domination over our former territories in North Africa isn't to please us, this initiative is worrisome. It is likely the Commune will fight to put forward revolutionaries and nationalists sympathetic to the syndicalist cause. The initiative also plays in with Egypt's attempt to foster Arab nationalism in the Middle East and North Africa, and might strengthen our rival. For these reasons, we have to be cautious, even if we won't be a main target."
 comfrance.63.d.SPA: "The word has spread to Spain. The Commune of France, alongside other members of the Internationale, has established a Socialist Anti-Colonial Committee. The Committee aims to support the cause of Arabs and Africans in liberating their homelands from the hands of the colonial powers, particularly the remnants of the French state.\nThis body will coordinate the Syndicalist powers' actions in North and West Africa. Let us hope we will not be one of its targets, for we have other, more important issues to deal with right now."
 comfrance.63.a: "A worrying development."

 comfrance.64.t: "The Creation of the Socialist Anti-Colonial Committee"
 comfrance.64.d: "Our comrades in France have recently started a Socialist Anti-Colonial Committee. Helped by Algerian Revolutionary Mohamed Saïl, the Committee aims to help nationalist and syndicalist revolutionaries in all of Africa and to destroy all colonial governments. However, even if nothing in that sense has been said officially, it is obvious the Committee is directly aimed towards the reactionary French government in Algiers which is having difficulties handling its colonial holdings.\n\nThe French have invited us to participate in the Committee and to help with sending equipment, arms and propaganda, to which we gladly agreed. Together we are stronger, and we will soon be able to liberate all of the African workers from the grasp of the imperialists!"
 comfrance.64.a: "Solidarity Forever!"

 comfrance.65.t: "What should the Committee focus on?"
 comfrance.65.d.default: "The Committee was convened today, in Paris. Around the table of the meeting, French, British, Algerian, Senegalese or even Tunisian representatives are present to discuss the matter of the day. It was decided before that a large operation was to be conducted against the French government in Algiers to weaken their hold over Africa. What was left to debate however, is how exactly are we going to hurt them. Our options could be to start a wave of sabotage and insurrectional strikes across their industry, heavily supporting rebel elements in a specific region or to foment unrest more evenly throughout Africa by using a large propaganda network. What should we do?"
 comfrance.65.d.collapse: "The Committee was convened today, in Paris. Around the table of the meeting, French, British and Algerian representatives are present to discuss the matter of the day. It was decided before that a large operation was to be conducted against the remnant of the French government in Algiers to weaken what's left of their hold over Africa. It was in the end decided that, in this situation, the only sensible option was to start a wave of strikes and sabotage to hurt their industrial base."
 comfrance.65.a: "Weaken their industrial capacity"
 comfrance.65.b: "Support rebel elements"
 comfrance.65.c: "Spread unrest throughout French Africa"

 comfrance.66.t: "Wave of Sabotage"
 comfrance.66.d: "Without any previous notice, a large wave of violent strikes started in some of our industrial bases. Those strikes are different than what we are used to, they are only done by a small part of the workers and don't seem to have any clear motive, factory bosses throughout the country only woke up to an occupied factory and to a lot of the equipment smashed. In other factories, the workers weren't occupying the factory, but a large part of the machinery was still found damaged or destroyed. Repressing the strikes and arresting their participants wasn't too difficult, but it seems to be a shot in the dark as those incidents were clearly masterminded from elsewhere..."
 comfrance.66.a: "Those damned Reds!"

 comfrance.67.t: "Syndicalists Foment Rebellion"
 comfrance.67.d: "The colonial authorities and the Second Bureau have reported to us than an unusual influx of arms and equipment has been flowing to one of our colonies in the last weeks. This all evidently coming from the Commune of France, using the darkness of the night to smuggle arms into our territory, destabilise us and incite rebellion. We took too long however to uncover that scheme, and the revolutionaries are now well armed enough to be emboldened in their resistance. We only have to hope we will be able to weather the storm."
 comfrance.67.a: "Traitors everywhere!"

 comfrance.68.t: "Campaign of Dissent"
 comfrance.68.d: "In the last weeks, we have noticed an increased propaganda activity, coming from nationalist and syndicalist agitators. It looks like they were suddenly equipped with tens of thousands of leaflets and pre-prepared radio speeches, spreading their words about the wrongdoings of our regime everywhere in Africa. Propaganda, even more when supported by the Commune of France, is hard to stop, we can't possibly confiscate every leaflet spreading in our colonies. This isn't entirely a lost battle though, as we can try to focus on a specific region in which our agents will shut down the radios and confiscate every suspect document. By doing this, we will be at least able to reduce the effects of the campaign in one or two regions of our choice..."
 comfrance.68.a: "Focus on Tunisia"
 comfrance.68.b: "Focus on Mauritania and Southern Algeria"
 comfrance.68.c: "Focus on Senegal and Guinea"
 comfrance.68.e: "Focus on Sudan and Upper Volta"
 comfrance.68.f: "Focus on Chad and Niger"

 comfrance.71.t: "The Tenth Congress of the Third Internationale"
 comfrance.71.d: "With the Second American Civil War raging on, as well as a number of other conflicts ready to break out at any time across the world, the Internationale has to redefine its approach towards the global revolution. Since the last Congress of the Internationale took place in France, many activists believe it would be the best to make Britain the next host."
 comfrance.71.a: "It would be an honour to host the Congress."

 comfrance.72.t: "The Tenth Congress of the Third Internationale"
 comfrance.72.d: "Our British comrades have confirmed their readiness to host the Tenth International Congress in London. It is time for [ROOT.GetNameDef] to confirm its participation."
 comfrance.72.a: "We shall attend."

 comfrance.86.t: "Inauguration of the Tenth Congress of the Third Internationale"
 comfrance.86.d: "With all the delegates in London, the Tenth Congress of the Internationale begun with a speech by comrade Eric Blair. In his so-called 'Shield-and-Sword speech' he underlined the need for the Internationale to double its efforts towards forging the 'Damocles' - a weapon capable of destroying the reactionaries across the world once and for all."
 comfrance.86.a: "Bravo, comrade Blair!"

 comfrance.87.t: "Day 2 - The American Question"
 comfrance.87.d: "On the second day the delegates discussed the most pressing matter - the development of the Civil War in America. With Long and the Federal government pushing the CSA on to the defensive, the decision was made to send additional help for Reed and his followers."
 comfrance.87.a: "Provide resources, industrial machines, and weapons."
 comfrance.87.b: "Send a crack fighter squadron."
 comfrance.87.c: "Organise a volunteer division."
 comfrance.87.f: "We cannot spare anything more."

 comfrance.90.t: "French Assistance Arrives"

 comfrance.90.a: "Thanks comrades!"

 comfrance.91.t: "British Assistance Arrives"
 comfrance.91.d: "Our British comrades have agreed to send us additional help. Transported from Mexico under constant air threat, a crack-squadron of British fighter-pilots has recently arrived in Chicago and awaits our orders."
 comfrance.91.a: "Thanks comrades!"

 comfrance.94.t: "Mexican Assistance Arrives"

 comfrance.94.a: "Thanks comrades!"

 comfrance.97.t: "Day 3 - Hemingway's Speech"
 comfrance.97.d: "With the American question settled, Ernest Hemingway, the Syndicates' delegate to the Congress, took the stage. He thanked all those who supported the CSA's cause and called on the Socialist world to constantly battle the reactionaries. The speech was received with great applause, especially by the French delegation."
 comfrance.97.a: "Yes, we can!"
 comfrance.97.b: "Oui, nous pouvons!"
 comfrance.97.c: "A great speech."

 comfrance.98.t: "Day 3 - Hemingway's Speech"
 comfrance.98.d: "The socialist delegate to the Second International Congress, Ernest Hemingway, has today given a speech, condemning our actions against the CSA and calling for intensified support for the Reds in this war. We must redouble our efforts and crush Reed before he receives any additional help."
 comfrance.98.a: "Onwards!"

 comfrance.99.t: "The Cambridge Conference"
 comfrance.99.d: "Along with the politicians in London, a separate meeting of scientists from France and Britain took place in the old university in Cambridge. It was decided that the socialist countries should combine their research in order to develop a weapon capable of protecting the Revolution from the increasingly aggressive imperialist threat."
 comfrance.99.a: "Knowledge is power."

 comfrance.100.t: "Day 5 - Request International Support For Chile"
 comfrance.100.d: "The socialist regime in Santiago is surrounded by reactionaries, especially in Argentina. It seems that the best way to protect the government is to ask for international support via the Congress of the Internationale."
 comfrance.100.a: "We shall not be alone."

 comfrance.101.t: "Day 5 - Chile Requests Support"
 comfrance.101.d: "The Chileans have asked for assistance in improving their army in the face of hostile imperialist foes such as Argentina. Bordered on virtually all sides by threats, Chile's position might become increasingly precarious without our help. Furthermore, they could prove invaluable at safeguarding the revolution in the New World."
 comfrance.101.a: "We cannot let Chile fall."
 comfrance.101.b: "Alas, we cannot help everyone."

 comfrance.102.t: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] Refuse to Help!"
 comfrance.102.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] were not moved by our efforts to solicit support, arguing that Chile is quite capable of defending itself and pushing forward the Revolution in South America."
 comfrance.102.a: "We can bear it."

 comfrance.103.t: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] Agreed to Help!"
 comfrance.103.d: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] has agreed to lend us a helping hand. We'll probably receive the shipment in several days, when they will be done preparing it."

 comfrance.110.t: "The Final Act of the Tenth Internationale Congress"
 comfrance.110.d: "With all important decisions made during the first week, the Congress has moved on to less pressing matters.

Cook, his authority and influence in the Union were unprecedented. During his funeral, the Chairman of the TUC stated that 'Comrade Mann has left us - but his ideas shall live on, forever.'

 comfrance.127.t: "The Phalanstère International Research Organisation"
 comfrance.127.d: "As time has passed it has quickly become apparent that the global revolution requires far more than just devotion to the cause. With France and Britain being the only highly-developed socialist countries in the world, it has become widely accepted that they should launch a long-term research aid programme for other countries. And thus has begun the so-called 'Phalanstère International Research Organisation', a branch of the 'Phalanstère International' programme aimed at providing technological support for socialist countries all over the world. The question now is whether we should join in with this endeavour."
 comfrance.127.a: "Participation sounds good."

 comfrance.128.t: "The Phalanstère International Industrial Programme"
 comfrance.128.d: "It has become apparent to many in the Internationale that it is the responsibility of all sufficiently-developed syndicalist nations to provide industrial support to those nations that are less able to provide for themselves. The choice is now upon us to decide whether we should stand in solidarity with workers around the world by helping implement a massive programme of industrial aid alongside our French brothers-in-arms."

 comfrance.129.d: "As part of the Phalanstère International programme, our comrades in Paris and London have just offered us much needed help.

 comfrance.130.t: "A Jacobin Reformation?"
 comfrance.130.d: "Having at long last taken control of the Commune, the Jacobin led Comité de Salut Public is now divided. Hardliners are demanding that the syndicalist structures be abolished, all replaced by a \"Parti Unique\" (Single Party) and a \"Technician\" State. However, this is likely to viciously divide France and as such many members of the party are suggesting that the Jacobins continue to operate within the established syndicalist structures of the BGT and CSP while gradually reforming the state along Constructive Revolutionary lines."

 comfrance.130.b: "We shall reform Syndicalism from within."

 comfrance.131.t: "Restructuring of the BGT and CSP"
 comfrance.131.d: "The syndicalist structures of post-revolution France are being transformed so as to better comply with Neosocialism as laid out by Marcel Déat. The Bourse Générale du Travail has been reformed as the Congrès des Téchniciens while the Comité de Salut Public has been replaced by the Conseil des Ministres."
 comfrance.131.a: "An improvement, no doubt."

 comfrance.132.t: "Dissolution of the CGT"
 comfrance.132.d: "Now we turn on the last pillar of Syndicalism in France, the Confédération Générale du Travail - the dominant Syndicate which long kept us from taking power in the Commune.

 comfrance.134.d: "Now the leading Orthodox figure, Léon Blum has begun to call openly for the disparate political factions of France to unite in opposition to the Jacobin government which many view as having corrupted and betrayed the Revolution. This Popular Front, despite being resisted by the many state mechanisms of the Jacobins, has already conducted several major industrial actions and political rallies in the larger cities.\n\nFearful that this open challenge to the party's rule might lead to a direct contest for the leadership of the Commune, the Renseignements Généraux is recommending that the Conseil des Ministres arrest Blum and the other leaders linked to the Front - most prominently, other than Blum himself, the still-respected general Maurice Gamelin."
 comfrance.134.a: "Bring them to trial!"
 comfrance.134.b: "Our valour will endure these traitors."

 comfrance.135.t: "The Paris Trial"
 comfrance.135.d: "The various leading figures of the Front Populaire, as well as other prominent potential allies of theirs, such as Maurice Gamelin, have been arrested and are being tried for treason. The Paris Trial aims to prove that Blum and his associates have undermined the Revolution and 'weakened France's defences against the German foe'. Blum, being both a lawyer and excellent public speaker, has used the courtroom to make a brilliant indictment of the Jacobin regime. Gamelin has remained silent throughout; refusing to recognise the court's right to try him.\n\nThe trial has not gone according to plan and the defendants have, despite heavy manipulation of the proceedings, proven largely successful in rebutting the charges, and won sympathetic coverage in both the unofficial domestic and international press. It has become such an embarrassment to our Neosocialist regime that some of the leadership is considering ordering it called off. Others wish to push forward and execute the defendants regardless, as they have become far too great a threat to be allowed to go free."

 comfrance.138.d: "The Front Populaire has seized Paris and is purging the Jacobins from the city. Communes throughout France have taken this opportunity to liquidate their own branches of the \"Parti Unique\". Gamelin and Blum have restored the formerly abolished syndicalist institutions, the CGT and BGT, and in emergency elections Gamelin has been elected as Chairman of the Bourse Générale du Travail with Blum appointed Chairman of the Comité de Salut Public."

 comfrance.145.d: "It's been five years since the last great reform of the revolution's armed forces and the French army has soared to new heights. However, the various factions of the CGT still disagree on the continued development of the Guarantor of National Integrity."
 comfrance.145.a: "Orthodoxes: Modernisation and optimisation!"

 comfrance.146.d: "With France continuously being threatened by both foreign and domestic enemies, the issue of our internal security has been raised in the elections."

 comfrance.146.b: "Jacobins: We need paramilitary gendarmes to keep the peace!"

 comfrance.146.e: "Anarchists: Democratise the Sûreté Populaire!"

 comfrance.147.t: "BGT Elections 1941 - External Security"
 comfrance.147.d: "As the revolution marches on, the office of the Renseignements Généraux has continued to hold key influence within the political framework of the federation and, as a result, is thus hotly contended."
 comfrance.147.a: "Orthodoxes: The current system is satisfactory."

 comfrance.148.e: "Anarchists: More power to the Cooperatives!"

 comfrance.149.t: "BGT Elections 1941 - Foreign Policy"
 comfrance.149.d: "Undoubtedly one of the most important issues for the next Comité would be how to handle the radically changing world developments. The Orthodoxes argue for further cooperation within the Internationale, whilst the Anarchists wish to commence a wave of liberation to sweep the old order away everywhere it lingers. Both Sorelians and Jacobins hold hawkish views."
 comfrance.149.a: "Orthodoxes: The Internationale must guarantee peace!"

 comfrance.150.d: "As the votes trickle in from the many communes of our great Federation, it has become clear that the Orthodox faction has scored a majority in the Bourse Générale du Travail.\n\nHowever, the grouping is split between the moderates of Leon Jouhaux and the more militant members gathering around Benoît Frachon. Regardless of whoever claims the mantle of leadership, the Commune of France will certainly be in good hands."
 comfrance.150.a: "Congratulations, Camarade Jouhaux."
 comfrance.150.b: "Congratulations, Camarade Frachon."

 comfrance.151.t: "BGT Elections 1941: Jacobin Majority"
 comfrance.151.d: "As the votes trickle in from the many communes of our great Federation, it has become clear that the Jacobins have scored a majority in the Bourse Générale du Travail.\n\nMarquet will form the new Comité while the new Chairman of the Bourse Générale du Travail will be Marcel Déat, the long-time main theoretician of the party. The top military leaders are expected to stay in place."

 comfrance.152.d: "As the votes trickle in from the many communes of our great Federation, it has become clear that the Sorelians have scored a majority in the Bourse Générale du Travail.\n\nCamarade Valois, the most brilliant leader of the orthodox Sorelians, is expected to form the new Comité while also being the new Chairman of the Bourse Générale du Travail."

 comfrance.154.t: "BGT Elections 1941: No Majority Achieved"

 comfrance.154.c: "Georges Valois and his Totalist Sorelians seize the BGT!"

 comfrance.155.t: "Federal Elections of 1946"
 comfrance.155.d: "The major issue is the re-integration in the Commune of former Social-Democrats that left fifteen years ago. The Orthodoxes, now the most reformist faction within the CGT, want to continue the democratisation process and push for an open arms policy towards the Social-Democrats. The Anarchists, although in favour of liberalisation, oppose that policy, as well as the now declining Sorelians. The Jacobins, of course, still advocate a technocratic reform."
 comfrance.155.a: "Orthodox majority: We have to make room for our Social-Democratic friends."
 comfrance.155.b: "Sorelian majority: No decay of the revolutionary values will be tolerated."

 comfrance.156.t: "Federal Elections of 1951"
 comfrance.156.d: "Thirty years have passed since the Commune of France was established. Our way to socialism and prosperity has been hard and long. Now, when the people choose the new government, our main goal is not only to develop Syndicalism, but also to protect 'des droits de l'homme et du citoyen', such as democracy and the right to happiness."
 comfrance.156.a: "Orthodox majority - Democratisation of the Commune should be gradual."
 comfrance.156.b: "Sorelian majority - Totalism shall stand triumphant."
 comfrance.156.c: "Anarchist majority - The stateless society awaits!"
 comfrance.156.e: "Jacobin majority - We are true Revolutionaries."

 comfrance.157.t: "Camarade Valois' Speech"
 comfrance.157.d: "Comrade Valois has humbly come to the representatives of the nation's workers with one modest request: for him to be given the tools to triumph in the struggle against the enemies of the Revolution. Years of Sorelian rule and the streamlining of procedures and production for the war effort have made this demand a formality: Valois and his government are already nearly all-powerful. Naturally, all appearances have been dutifully maintained: Sorelian rethoric is one of radical syndicalism, and the election of the CNS was to be a reform towards the ethos of the revolutionary days. But slowly, surely, power was concentrated in the hands of Sorelians. Proletarian democracy is alive, but it serves only one mistress: the grand historical, revolutionary purpose of all Frenchmen, the War to save civilisation itself from bourgeois decay.\n\nValois is more comfortable with courteous theoretical debate than grand speeches. His leadership has reflected this temperament, and though often forceful, to not say violent, the Sorelians have a rather placid leader. Comrade Valois did not have the makings of a dictator and did not wish to be one: he sees himself as merely imbued by the accidents of History with the role of unworthy guide of the French proletariat. But today Valois found within himself oratory skills on par with the greatest revolutionary tribunes. Passionately arguing for the executive to be granted emergency powers, so that once and for all the Revolution may triumph first across Europe, then the World, he concluded his speech with a promise to hunt down Reaction wherever it may hide, to rapturous applause. He had found, of course, a receptive audience: believers were enraptured, remaining adversaries did not wish to wake up tomorrow to armed comrades accusing them of counter-revolutionary activity. And so a vote granting the government vast emergency powers nearly unanimously passed, as enthusiastic representatives shouted "Vive Camarade-Chef Valois!""
 comfrance.157.a: "Death to Reaction, wherever she hides!"

 comfrance.158.t: "The Rising Sun"
 comfrance.158.d: "An award ceremony, frequent sight these days, as our heroes are given the recognition they deserve for their efforts at the front. Camarade Valois, eager to mingle with his fellow worker-combatant, is never too busy to salute them, listen to stories from the front, hear about the heroic sacrifice of a comrade. This time, it was a cavalry unit, federal dragoons. Though their horseback-riding days were behind them and these were now a fierce mechanised force, tip of the spear driven into Reaction's darkened heart, the spirit of the cavalry remained strong: brave or foolhardy, critics would say aristocratic, but none could deny their courage. As Comrade Valois reviewed these troops, his eye was caught by a bright, blood-red banner affixed to the leading tank: crimson flying proudly, adorned with the Sun's flaming rays, in its heart the symbols of the Revolution.\n\nImpossible to mistake it, the symbol was in every history book: this was an ad hoc reproduction of the Oriflamme, the ancient kings of France's sacred war banner, the golden flame cleansing away their enemy, updated to serve the Proletariat. When Valois inquired about this odd sight, an increasingly nervous officer attempted to explain this was nothing more than a unit tradition, initiative from soldiers reviving childish dreams of chivalry. He was no doubt expecting scandal, perhaps punishment, as before the Comrade-Chief cut him off he was attempting to assume full responsibility. Instead, Valois was full of enthusiasm: indeed, what better way to show the inherent revolutionary character of the French nation that to root our symbols in those of the glorious victories of our ancestors? The Frenchman has always been a mover of history, our past is nothing to shun. So full of enthusiasm in fact, that the Chief promised the banner would soon be flown alongside the federal and red flags, reintroduced as France's war banner in her grand civilisational duty."
 comfrance.158.a: "Our comrades might not share this view..."
 comfrance.158.b: "Trust the boundless creativity of the masses! Forward, under the rising sun of socialism!"

 comfrance.159.t: "Paris is Lost!"
 comfrance.159.d: "Paris, the city of lights, cradle of the Revolution and capital of France has been captured by the enemy! While they are facing resistance from the civilian population we must quickly counter-attack and retake full control of the city."
 comfrance.159.a: "Foule esclave, debout, debout!"

 comfrance.160.t: "Liberation of Alsace-Lorraine"
 comfrance.160.d: "We have advanced in the former imperial province of Alsace-Lorraine, and secured the whole region. Germany can't stand before our superiority as the lost provinces are restored to France!"
 comfrance.160.a: "... Groupons-nous, et demain..."

 comfrance.161.t: "The July Fourteenth Celebrations"
 comfrance.161.d: "Today, France celebrates the anniversary of the Storming of the Bastille, the opening act of the 1789 Revolution. Immense festivities will take place, each village planning some sort of commemoration along the usual revelries: despite the socialist revolution, July Fourteenth remains a day of great popular celebrations. Military and militia parades, period costumes, exhibitions, speeches, entertainment and street banquets are to be expected.These celebrations are considered particularly important to reinforce national unity before the seemingly inevitable coming conflict: despite differences, all true Frenchmen can trace their revolutionary politics back to the fall of the Bastille."
 comfrance.161.a: "Long live the memory of our elders in the struggle!"

 comfrance.163.t: "Labour Day"
 comfrance.163.d: "In 1889, delegates of the Second International voted for the designation of the 1st of May as a day of mobilisation to be repeated yearly. A proposal by the father of French Marxism Jules Guesde, the date was chosen to commemorate the martyrs of the Haymarket Massacre, killed for having dared to demand an eight hours work day. Years and after years, intense mobilisation on this day led to more street confrontations, often more victims. On this International Workers' Day, soon known colloquially as Labour Day, proletarians refused to work, and marched for their rights, waving the red flag, singing the Internationale, wearing the red eglantine or the lily of the valley wrapped in scarlet cloth on their jackets in memory of the bloodshed. This commemorative, oppositional holiday, this day of freedom snatched from the jaws of Capital, rightfully shook the bourgeoisie.\n\nWith the Revolution, the First of May was declared a national holiday and quickly became a day of great official celebrations and commemorations, marches, popular events and dances. At home, a celebration of the Revolution and the liberated workers, abroad still a day of struggle, until one day the wind of revolutionary freedom blows on all corners of the Earth. Our people rejoice and remember the long road travelled: once a mere dream held onto dearly in the factories, the Revolution now lives, thrives, its heart beating proudly in France, an inspiration for all of our comrades still shackled."
 comfrance.163.a: "Triumph in the struggle awaits us!"

 comfrance.164.t: "The First Bourges International Art Festival"
 comfrance.164.d: "The First Bourges International Art Festival was held today. Only thanks to the efforts of both Britain and France in creating International Avant-Garde such festival took place. The artwork included many famous Realist paintings commissioned by the French Government as well as many British, Russian, and American paintings and a mural painted by Diego Rivera. The event will be lasting into the weekend and has attracted worldwide attention. We will enjoy the spotlight for now."
 comfrance.164.a: "This will be the first of many, The Government will make sure of it!"

 comfrance.165.t: "France proposes International Avant-Garde"
 comfrance.165.d: "An efforts were made by the French government to establish an International Avant-Garde. It will aim to create new artistic styles, unique in their unorthodoxy presentations, something this world has never seen before.\n\nFrench Government believes it will be a helpful tool in spreading syndicalist teaching through non-violent means. Now they expect us to join on it. "
 comfrance.165.a: "Count us in!"

 comfrance.170.t: "An Alliance with the Internationale?"
 comfrance.170.d: "The Internationale, the military alliance of the world's foremost socialist powers, has discreetly approached us with an offer to join its ranks, considering an alliance with our nation to be in the interest of all and a great step forward in the long struggle towards the liberation of the international proletariat. This offer comes with undeniable benefits, we could certainly expect a great amount of support: help against our enemies and towards the realisation of our military objectives, protection should it ever be needed, and just as importantly, support for the development of our armed forces and even our economy through the Phalanstère programme. However, it comes with perhaps daunting obligations, setting us on a course of eventual but certain conflict with the Kaiser and his allies. How should we respond to their offer?"
 comfrance.170.a: "Stronger together!"
 comfrance.170.b: "On second thought, no..."

 comfrance.171.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Has Accepted!"
 comfrance.171.d: "Time to rejoice! [From.GetNameDefCap] has accepted our offer to join our military alliance, as we had dearly hoped they would. With this decision, they have been assured of our undying support as allies in the global struggle for the liberation of the working class, and we have gained a valuable ally against our undeniably mighty enemies. Soon, many others will follow them: “the Internationale shall be the human race”!"
 comfrance.171.a: "Excellent!"

 comfrance.172.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Has Refused!"
 comfrance.172.d: "To our chagrin, [From.GetNameDef] has refused our offer to join our military alliance. Perhaps too intimidated by the undeniable might of our enemies, or simply not committed enough to the fight for the liberation of the proletariat. In any case, though this is certainly a regrettable result of our diplomatic overture, many others will join us in this struggle: “the Internationale shall be the human race”!"
 comfrance.172.a: "Their loss."

 comfrance.200.t: "The Damocles Project"
 comfrance.200.d: "German spies have recently uncovered the papers of a research and development programme sponsored by the members of the Third Internationale. Dubbed 'The Damocles Project', it is an extensive multi-nation study into the destructive power of nuclear fission with the intent of creating 'bombs with a destructiveness vastly greater than anything now known'. The famous German physicist Albert Einstein had previously warned that a successful 'nuclear bomb' might even be able to turn entire cities into ash.\n\nGerman intelligence agencies have shared the information about this project to their closest allies, so naturally the whole world now knows. Some have dismissed the project as a childish fantasy, but many experts fear a breakthrough."
 comfrance.200.a: "If they should succeed..."

 comfrance.301.t: "The End of the Third Internationale"
 comfrance.301.d: "The war has most decidedly not developed to our advantage. Despite the best efforts of us and our soldiers, the forces of reaction have proven to be too much for the power of the international proletariat - suffering a long string of setbacks and defeats, the British and French militaries have had their fighting effectiveness steadily reduced throughout the course of the war. While we have held out hope until now that the workers of the world will still rise up, the situation has reached such a critical point that neither Britain or France can offer effective resistance to the opposing forces, and no surviving member of the Internationale has the necessary strength and prestige to rally the alliance - as such, the Third Internationale has begun to break down.\n\nThe effects of this can be felt almost immediately - what was previously a steadfast resolve to never give in to the reactionaries has now swiftly given way to an almost defeatist attitude, as allied insurgents and governments alike increasingly consider our cause hopeless and begin contemplating either hanging up their rifles or seeking some sort of terms with the enemy, and the Phalanstère and other organs of the Internationale have been rendered largely defunct. It is expected that, barring an unthinkable reversal, the now-former members of the alliance beyond the reach of enemy forces will soon cease open hostilities, while the rest will eventually be forced to surrender unconditionally... or otherwise suffer eventual debellation.\n\nAs the flame of revolution burns out and the workers cry in despair, all that remains is to find whatever salvation we can..."
 comfrance.301.a: "Not like this..."

 INT_collapse_base: "Born from the ashes of the Great War, the Third Internationale had become, across more than 20 years and in equal measures, the world's greatest hope and its greatest fear - an alliance of the world's first socialist governments, bearing grand ambitions of completing the long-held dream of the global workers' revolution."

 comfrance.302.t: "The Internationale Collapses"
 comfrance.302.d.germany: "$INT_collapse_base$\n\nHowever, the German world order has proven itself too powerful to defeat - after much struggle, Germany and its allies now control most of Britain and France, and the Third Internationale and its organs have been rendered defunct with no surviving state strong enough to rally them.

 comfrance.302.d.germany_entente: "$INT_collapse_base$\n\nHowever, the forces of the old order have proven too powerful to overcome - facing enemies on all sides, Britain and France have both fallen to German and Entente invasion, and the Third Internationale and its organs have ceased to function with no surviving state strong enough to rally them. After being considered an increasingly real prospect for years, world revolution has now been rendered impossible for decades or more to come - if not permanently."
 comfrance.302.d.russia: "$INT_collapse_base$\nBut while they triumphed over Germany, it was what came after that proved their undoing: after a destructive war, the Internationale was unable to triumph over their new enemy in Russia and fell to invasion, leaving the Third Internationale and its organs defunct with no surviving state strong enough to rally them. Even so, its defeat of Germany has left the world as we know it permanently changed - so while the world revolution may be ended for decades or more, its legacy is a world radically different from the one that came before."
 comfrance.302.d.generic: "$INT_collapse_base$\n\nHowever, their enemies have proven to be too many and too powerful to overcome - with the socialist governments of Britain and France soundly defeated, and no remaining force strong enough to take up the mantle, the Third Internationale and its various organs have ceased to function.

 comfrance.999.intro: "Over the past few days, the workers and peasants of the world have watched as the bankers, capitalists, and tyrants scrabble to reap the benefits of the workers' labour for their own selfish gain. They call it Black Monday, a terrible event they say! They say that such a collapse was completely uncalled for, something no economist could have predicted! Of course, the workers are no fools. The people see through their lies.\n\nAs the great philosopher Karl Marx predicted, such collapses are an inevitable result of capitalism. As the capitalist abuses and reaps the benefits of the workers, they begin to eat themselves alive like rabid dogs. All this as they leave their workers to struggle and die by the wayside as they scramble for the last piece of meat."
 comfrance.999.d: "$comfrance.999.intro$\n\nOur nation, however, has decoupled itself from the capitalist world and has begun the construction of a true people's state. Therefore, we remain unaffected and can only watch as the nations of the world are eaten alive by their capitalist overlords. This is a great awakening for the peasants and workers of the world and soon, the workers of these nations will begin to organise against their oppressors. We must stand by, and stand tall as a true example for the workers of the world!"

 comfrance.1000.d: "A few days ago, General Maurice Gamelin, launched a successful coup against the Jacobin regime of Marcel Déat. While this seems like a staunch attack on the Commune's democratic system, many argue that the Jacobins would have destroyed the democratic system if not for Gamelin's intervention.\n\nGamelin has promised to restore France to traditional syndicalism, and the process of de-Jacobinisation is already taking place. It is still unknown how his plans will turn out. We can only wait..."

Ever since its inception, however, the Second Commune was not uniform in its policy - numerous factions arose, each one with their own idea of which path France should take. As the time for revenge against Germany and the World Revolution closes in, the CGT election of 1936 is set to be very important...\nThe replacement for the disgraced Marceau Pivert arose from his own faction, the Orthodoxes, who named [FRA.GetLeader], who now hold the leading position in the CSP.

 comfrance.1034.d: "The Commune of France is the world's leading socialist nation. It is a federation of city communes directed by the Comité de Salut Public, the chief executive. Since its inception, the Second Commune has not been uniform in its policy; numerous factions with their own distinct direction for France have vied for power. With revenge against Germany and the World Revolution approaching, the election of 1936 was set to be very important...\n\nThe disgraced Marceau Pivert's replacement arose from the Sorelians, the Sorelians named Georges Valois as their leader, who now hold the majority in the CSP.

 comfrance.1037.d: "Socialist delegates from around the world are gathered in and around Paris for the latest congress of their movement. The Third Internationale was created by French socialists after the 1920 revolution and has since helped steer the efforts of the labour movement. Dominated by syndicalists, the Internationale however intends to be a broad-tent organisation and thus welcomes reds of all stripes. Delegates were greeted by a military parade and a rousing speech in Versailles, clad in red for the occasion.\n\nAt the top of the agenda is the spread of revolutionary fervour, particularly to Asia and North America, conflict in Spain, policy on colonialism and requirements for membership of the Internationale's military alliance."

Pierre Monatte has had an immense influence on our nation, leading us confidently for over a decade now. Born on January 15th, 1881, he was a renowned trade unionist before the Great War and had been unjustly arrested several times for various syndicalist 'crimes' against Capital, such as his participation in righteous protests in the aftermath of the Courrières mining disaster. Having quickly risen through the ranks of the General Confederation of Labour, he was even briefly forced into exile by the Republic's repression of the movement. When the War broke out, he was of the few to dare say a resounding no to collaboration with the bourgeois government, shortly before being sent to the front. This prescience and his reputation as a stalwart, tireless revolutionary meant that when the time came, Monatte played a critical role in the overthrowing of the old order, and was in an excellent place to steer the new proletarian course of our nation.\n\nBecoming one of the main organisers of the 'Orthodoxes', and certainly their most influential member, his leadership led the union of the previously feuding 'Centrists' and 'Ultras' to victory in the 1926 elections, capturing the Presidency. A master politician, Monatte has managed to stay afloat through a fragile coalition with the Anarchists, ever juggling their demands, along with the other, fractal factions that are so important in the parliament. Yet the man at the top will always be a target, and to say the position he holds is coveted would be an understatement. As knives sharpen in every dark corner, how long can the light keep them at bay?§!"

 FRA_nestor_makhno_commander_desc: "§YBorn:§! §LNovember 8th, 1888, in Huliaipole, Yekaterinoslav Governorate, Russian Empire§!\n§YBackground:§! §LBorn in extreme poverty in rural Eastern Ukraine, Nestor Makhno experienced the worst of the late Russian Empire - he lost his father when he was ten months old and any chance at gaining an education at ten years old, as he had to abandon school to work odd jobs to feed his family. He developed a primal rage for the landlord and the factory-owner, led a wildcat strike against his landlord when he was twelve, and fully devoted himself to the impending revolution since he was seventeen, after witnessing the Revolution of 1905. He led anarchist study groups, skirmished with the police, and was ultimately convicted to a life sentence of hard labour.\n\nSickly, yet energetic, Makhno was released after the February Revolution, and immediately travelled to Ukraine to continue his work. Now, he was no longer a propagandist, but a revolutionary leader. After being briefly exiled from Huliapole due to the German occupation, he bore witness to the rise of the Bolsheviks, which he denounced as a "paper revolution" and returned home in July 1918. There, he set up the Revolutionary Insurgent Army and began a year long war of resistance against the Germans and Ukrainian nationalists. Though brutal and not at all educated in army affairs, Makhno earned the favour of the countryside and gave the Hetman a much tougher fight than expected before being forced to flee. Ultimately, he arrived in the Commune of France, which he immediately denounced as yet another paper revolution. Uninterested in its intellectual foundations, Makhno merely saw disunity, inaction and oligarchy which threatened to overturn the accomplishments of the Revolution by creating yet another aristocracy. Much like Bolshevik exiles, he was integrated into the Federal Army, and earned a following with tales of his exploits - however, he was a maverick in the officer corps, clashing with his superiors and ignoring his duties. Neither him nor the Army were satisfied, so, Makhno left for the wider world - serving in revolutionary volunteer corps throughout the post-war to further the world revolution instead. This path has brought him to Patagonia - where he can serve the cause while being out of mind for the Communards.§!"
