 SLV_lovro_klemencic: "Lovro Klemenčič"
 SLV_lovro_klemencic_leader_desc: "§YBorn:§! §LAugust 9th, 1891, in Šentvid pri Stični, Duchy of Carniola, Austria-Hungary§!\n§YBackground:§! §LBorn to a family of merchants, in 1911 he graduated from the Novo Mesto gymnasium and shortly after went to study medicine in Vienna. At the end of his studies he began his involvement in radical politics and in 1913 established connections with Russian revolutionaries. After the eruption of the Weltkrieg he was sent to fight in Galicia, where he was captured and volunteered to serve Serbia as a doctor. After his arrival he retreated with the Serbian army through Albania and onto the isle of Corfu. In 1917 he was sent by Nikola Pašić to establish Russian support for the Yugoslav project, but ended up siding with the Bolsheviks, joining the Red Army in 1918.\nWith the losses by Reds in the Russian civil war, he returned to Slovenia in early 1919, together with his now right-hand man Vladislav Fabjančič, where they joined the left wing of the JSDS, only to split into the SRP. In late 1923, Klemenčič, together with Fabjančič ran in the Carniola elections on the SRP ticket, achieving just over 12% of the total vote. However soon after they got in trouble with the rest of the SRP over their support for unitary Yugoslavism and advocacy for a coalition with other leftist parties, resulting in them being kicked out of the party. Klemenčič and Fabjančič remained politically active and rejoined the JSDS, where they were once more on its left wing. Throughout the rest of the 1920s and early 1930s Klemenčič wrote for various newspapers, failing to achieve the prominence he briefly held.\n\nWith the 1932 nomination of Milan Gorkić to lead the Illyrian section of the SRP, things took a different turn. As part of his broad front strategy, Gorkić requested the two \"True Communists\" return back into the party and they readily accepted his invitation.\n\nAnd now Klemenčič he has been installed as Slovenia's marionette leader owing to the fact that no-one else in the country's political far left with competence or connections wanted to take the position of a Totalist lapdog. This position has earned him many detractors but for now his broader connections to moderates and willingness to use force have kept him afloat.§!"
