### Ideas ###
 USA_great_depression: "The Great Depression"
 USA_great_depression_desc: "Since the collapse of the New York Stock Market in 1925, the United States has been gripped by the Great Depression. In addition to the massive economic woes plaguing America from this never-ending crisis, the Great Depression has given energy to both Long and Reed as they campaign against one another and the establishment."

 USA_black_monday: "The Great Depression"
 USA_black_monday_desc: "The Great Depression which has been gripping America for over a decade looked to be slowly recovering under the Hoover administration, though nowhere near fast enough. However, the recent collapse of the Berlin Stock Market has just made the Great Depression even worse. Only God and the next president know when this can be over."

 USA_political_crisis: "Political Crisis"
 USA_political_crisis_desc: "The United States is in crisis. The Great Depression, which has been ravaging our nation for over a decade, has still not let up. Popular desperation has allowed the far-left Socialist Party of America and the far-right America First Party to gain strength in recent years. Others look to MacArthur and the Army as a way to solve both the depression and radicalisation. Many worry that the United States will descend into civil war should our current situation not soon be resolved."

 USA_new_year_strike_idea: "New Year Strike"
 USA_new_year_strike_idea_desc: "With the election of 1936 still heavily contested, Reed and the SPA have organised massive strikes to protest the outcome. The threat of violence is soaring as striking workers and Red Guards have clashed with strikebreakers and anti-socialist militiamen. Increasingly urgent reports have been spreading through the airwaves claiming that the National Guard and police are quickly losing control. The White House has been flooded with calls and letters, and it is clear that the President must do something fast before disaster strikes."

 USA_civil_war_aftermath_idea: "Recovering from the Civil War"
 USA_civil_war_aftermath_idea_desc: "While we may have won the Civil War, our country is in ruins. Most people are forced to barter; electricity, running water, and other basic services barely function; and millions are starving or ill, especially the thousands and thousands of orphans."
 USA_civil_war_aftermath_idea2_desc: "While we may have stopped the cholera epidemics and famines, most of the country is still on fire. The only place one can find any modicum of stability is the heavily guarded military depots containing newly-delivered famine relief aid and medicine."
 USA_civil_war_aftermath_idea3_desc: "The cities have returned to some level of stability, and currency is starting to come back into use as bartering fades. The mass graves are now covered in saplings and flowers as the nation slowly claws itself back from collapse."
 USA_civil_war_aftermath_idea4_desc: "Government-run agencies have started to put people back to work, and some respectable businesses have reopened. The threat of mass starvation has passed, though it is not uncommon to see small hordes of orphans and elderly rooting through trash in the cities."
 USA_civil_war_aftermath_idea5_desc: "The scars of the war, visible just months ago, have largely faded from the country. Factories have re-opened, and trains, buses, and other forms of public transportation have started running with some regularity. America has nearly returned to its pre-war standard of living."

 USA_federalist_resistance1_desc: "While we may have won the war against the Federal Government, we have not won the minds of its inhabitants. Federalist terrorists attack railroads and factories, and indiscriminately kill our loyal soldiers and policemen."
 USA_federalist_resistance2: "Federalist Resistance"
 USA_federalist_resistance2_desc: "Our initial counter-terrorism efforts are showing some promise, but the Federalist resistance groups are tough nuts to crack. Some peripheral terrorists have been arrested, and a few safehouses raided, but this has had little impact."

 USA_help_economy_mission_desc: "The Great Depression has left the United States reeling, and President Hoover's government has been struggling to deal with the fallout. The last hope is to pass a bill that will finally get some relief in the hands of those who need it - if Congress can work quickly enough."
 USA_oldorder_act_quickly: "Act Quickly"
 USA_oldorder_act_quickly_desc: "Now that the election is over, the new government will need to take action - and quickly. Failure to act will likely mean intervention by the military to solve the crisis, though even acting carries no guarantee of the political crisis being solved."
 USA_long_act_quickly: "Act Quickly"
 USA_long_act_quickly_desc: "Now that the election is over, the new government will need to take action - and quickly. Failure to act will likely mean intervention by the military to solve the crisis, though even acting carries no guarantee of the political crisis being solved."

In this role, PADF works with public and private partners to implement socio-economic development and disaster relief for the members of the League of American States so that the goal of a Hemisphere of Opportunity for All can be achieved.

 USA_new_monroe_doctrine: "The New Monroe Doctrine"
 USA_new_monroe_doctrine_desc: "The second civil war taught us that the influence of foreign nations will do nothing but bring chaos and disorder to the Americas. As stressed by our first president, our place is not with Europe but to protect and guide Latin America to democracy."
 USA_attack_canada: "Attack Canada"
 USA_attack_canada_desc: "We have traditionally been on friendly terms with our neighbours to the north... except when we haven't. If the time comes when Canada is controlled by an unfriendly government or has decided to occupy American lands, then the time has also come for us to change the nature of our relationship."
 USA_attack_mexico: "Attack Mexico"
 USA_attack_mexico_desc: "Our preference would be that Mexico was ruled by a friendly government, and kept to its own business. If that is not the case, we cannot ignore that it sits on our borders - borders we will actively protect, even if it means invading our neighbours to the south."
 USA_attack_philippines: "Attack the Philippines"

 USA_join_entente_desc: "The United States cannot afford to sit idly while the rest of Europe burns under the Syndicalist menace and the despicable Kaiser.

###Post Civil War - democracy ###
 USA_victory_in_the_civil_war: "Victory in the Civil War"
 USA_victory_in_the_civil_war_desc: "Separatists have again failed in their mission to destroy the union of the United States of America. Though both radical socialists and populists dug into our power base, we have proven the power of legitimate government once more. The would-be dictators Reed and Long are no longer welcome in America."
 USA_democracy_triumphs: "Democracy Triumphs!"
 USA_democracy_triumphs_desc: "Though the temptation towards autocracy was great, America stood with its three branches intact, without giving up to executive authority. Congress is called into emergency session and the Appellate Courts are dealing with their mountain of paper trying to sort out the consequences."
 USA_democratic_education: "Constitutional Education"
 USA_democratic_education_desc: "A common talking point by radicals and populists was the idea that the Federal Government is a voluntary organisation. Some even claim to use ridiculous false loopholes like naval law or the rights to secede from the union. We must correct this by making the U.S Constitution as widely available as possible."
 USA_defend_democracy: "Defend Democracy"
 USA_defend_democracy_desc: "Out of the former rebel states, reports have come in of voter intimidation based on class and race. Candidates running for office without an oath of allegiance to the United States. We must protect the peoples' right to vote, and politicians do not incite rebellion again."
 USA_bill_of_rights: "Bill of Rights Reminder"
 USA_bill_of_rights_desc: "Building off of a Constitutional education initiative, Congress has approved of an education push to younger Americans on the importance of our Bill of Rights. This will also allow citizens to better appeal for their rights in a non-violent manner."
 USA_american_values1: "American Values"
 USA_american_values1_desc: "The passive promotion of civil government through high minded publications was undercut sharply by pamphlets and private publishers that promoted an uncivil government. Congress has decided that a multifaceted approach to instilling American values through mass media will finally undercut pamphleteers."
 USA_restore_legitimacy: "Restore Legitimacy"
 USA_restore_legitimacy_desc: "The numerous embassies we were not able to staff during the crisis have finally received relief. We shall re-establish ourselves to the world community as a stronger and more unified nation with an expanded diplomatic corps."
 USA_malice_and_charity: "Malice and Charity"
 USA_malice_and_charity_desc: "With the words of president Lincoln reminding us to \"bind the nation's wounds\", Congress has created a system to reintegrate the rebel states on a massive scale. Through a non-partisan Committee called \"Malice and Charity\", districts can be re-added to the Union."
 USA_destroy_radicalism: "Destroy Radicalism"
 USA_destroy_radicalism_desc: "While the US Government tolerates political discourse, Congress has rallied against the syndicalist and distributionist platforms of Long and Reed. Legal bodies found to be advocating for trade unions or mutualist organisations will be prosecuted under the 1917 Sedition Act."
 USA_strengthen_democracy: "Strengthen Democracy"
 USA_strengthen_democracy_desc: "During the civil war, democratic processes were halted at the local level. Many elections in the border areas were skipped in order to focus more time on the existential crisis of the war for America. Democracy shall now rise from the ashes, and Congress has appointed a committee to ensure elections take place at the local level once more."
 USA_civil_liberties: "Loyalty to America"
 USA_civil_liberties_desc: "The early 1930s was the era of loyalty to men over ideals. Reed, Long, and even Macarthur accrued a sort of clique of allies that saw their leaders as above the law. Several Congressmen have come out to apologise for their statements made during the war."
 USA_ensure_political_stability: "Ensure Political Stability"
 USA_ensure_political_stability_desc: "Although it is opposed by some of the legislatures, use of the FCC to monitor the airwaves against rebel radio stations is necessary. This measure along with several other forms of censorship are still necessary to end rebel pockets within the Contiguous U.S."
 USA_protect_democracy: "Protect Democracy"
 USA_protect_democracy_desc: "The 17th Amendment enhanced the democratic representation in America, but failed, in the long run, to make the electoral process more democratic. Congress shall strengthen the democratic process directly through the review of poll taxes and registries of felons, to ensure the word of the law is followed."
 USA_land_of_the_free: "Land of the Free"
 USA_land_of_the_free_desc: "The use of penal labour in the prisoner of war camps is no longer tolerable to Congress. Although the fate of these prisoners is still up to the court's system, their exploitation in both loyal and rebel states should be rolled back."
 USA_home_of_the_brave: "Home of the Brave"
 USA_home_of_the_brave_desc: "The veterans of the Second Civil War have sacrificed it all to preserve their home, if only they didn't have to fight other Americans. Despite protests from the House, the Senate has wisely extended veterans' benefits to the rebel soldiers, so long as that recipient re-affirm their oath to all the American people."
 USA_for_the_people: "For the People"
 USA_for_the_people_desc: "The people of America as a collective are our constituents and our lifeblood.

 USA_a_more_perfect_union: "A More Perfect Union"
 USA_a_more_perfect_union_desc: "The goal of the United States as an independent nation is to form a more perfect union of the people of the United States. Not the exaltation of a single doctrine or political movement as Reed or Long claimed. The President has spoken on the irreducible complexity of America's relationship to its people."

### Post Civil War - Reconstruction ###
 USA_begin_reconstruction: "Begin Reconstruction"
 USA_begin_reconstruction_desc: "The nation has suffered much long before this war started. It is both a monumental task and an opportunity to unify transportation networks, and push through bolder economic ideas to elevate American industry above this ailing world."
 USA_rebuild_railroads: "Rebuild American Railroads"
 USA_rebuild_railroads_desc: "The Railroad networks that cross America are in shambles, and war-era constructions are jury-rigged to older tracks. Congress has approved of rebuilding our railroad network in the form of mandatory third rail electrification. Electrified tracks will force our energy grid to reform as a result."
 USA_electrification: "Electrification Program"
 USA_electrification_desc: "In order to accommodate the mandatory Third Rail, as well as ensure the safety of the more remote parts of America, an electrification project is approved to cross all state lines. Congress is now pulling state governments to fund transformers and hydroelectric power, as it is their responsibility."
 USA_business_subsidies: "Business Subsidies"
 USA_business_subsidies_desc: "Small businesses in America have struggled to expand their employment opportunities, which is contributing to unemployment. The issue of unsafe working conditions returning to prominence due to the need for faster production has led to agitated workers. Congress has approved of a federal purse to subsidise small businesses."
 USA_rebuild_americas_industry: "Rebuild America's Industry"
 USA_rebuild_americas_industry_desc: "America's exports have fallen during the depression despite taking a laissez-faire position on trade laws. Exports are also one of the main ways we measure economic activity. We must invest in the tertiary services our industrial businesses use in order to lower their bottom line and increase output."
 USA_economic_investments: "Economic Investments"
 USA_economic_investments_desc: "A more bold strategy is devised by Congress to assist in economic recovery. Traditional notions that government purchases are negatively associated with growth, newer theories hold that smart purchases can stimulate the economy."
 USA_esmwt: "Fate of the Unions"
 USA_esmwt_desc: "It is time for Congress to hear the testimony of rebellious unions. Some are calling for just their chair-people to resign, while others insist on collecting transcripts of union meetings, paving the way for prosecuting all active members."
 USA_rebuild_the_roads: "Rebuild America's Roads"
 USA_rebuild_the_roads_desc: "The state-funded interstate highway system was easy targets for sabotage. We must cooperate with the states in order to ensure safe commerce and travel through America once more."
 USA_american_industry: "American Industrial Might"
 USA_american_industry_desc: "The war may have temporarily reinvigorated heavy industry, but its design was temporary and facilities were essentially built on top of closed factories. We must bring our safety and management efficiencies to bear in order to make this upswing permanent."
 USA_rebuild_agriculture: "Rebuild Agricultural Industry"
 USA_rebuild_agriculture_desc: "In order to transport and process the food to feed our nation, we must encourage innovative preservation and agronomy sciences. Congress has set up a fund to investigate this and several politicians have contributed to it directly."
 USA_aviation_industry: "Aviation Industry"
 USA_aviation_industry_desc: "The United States used to lead the world in civilian aircraft manufacturing. Now assembly line systems in Germany have us outpaced. Congress has spoken to intelligence agencies about what we can do to encourage businesses to adopt these techniques, including our contractors."
 USA_farming_subsidies: "Farming Subsidies"
 USA_farming_subsidies_desc: "It is necessary to subsidise farms for crops we are in need of, and paying farmers to terminate their fields of lost assets for products like tobacco we don't need right now, but want the skilled labour to still be available."
 USA_maritime_industry: "Maritime Industry"
 USA_maritime_industry_desc: "The Merchant Marine was severely damaged in the war, and Congress has approved the extension of veteran benefits to those active duty sailors who are not on tour if they become a Merchant Marine in their downtime."
 USA_synthetic_oil: "Oil Production"
 USA_synthetic_oil_desc: "The Oil Fields of the Midwest burned as our country was fighting. We must control these fires, stop future sabotages, and invest in synthetic oil, to ensure that more of the country can make use of vehicles."
 USA_reconstruction_finished: "Reconstruction Over"
 USA_reconstruction_finished_desc: "The years of poor economic management and civil strife have not left our minds, but their most damning effects are diminished."

### Post Civil War - Macarthur ###
 USA_american_caesar_desc: "President MacArthur has proclaimed he would not concede victory to the very partisans who caused the civil war. His American Junta promises a national restoration and adoption of functional democracy as MacArthur sees it. Elimination of unnecessary politicians and appointment of more competent officials will bridge the gap between people and politics."
 USA_army_education: "Army Education"
 USA_army_education_desc: "Parents' organisations have come out to claim we willingly let children into the military underage. Our solution is to divert prospective youth into military education while keeping them in public school. The ideas of physical education and moralist taught by Bellamy will revive that old Nationalist fervour that failed us in the 1910s."
 USA_nationalize_boy_scouts: "National Youth Administration"
 USA_nationalize_boy_scouts_desc: "The simultaneous pull to mandate a higher working age is countered by the multitudes of unemployed youth strewn across America. The solution is to establish a National Youth Administration in order to provide work and education to Americans too young to vote."
 USA_the_american_legion: "The American Legion"
 USA_the_american_legion_desc: "With the American Legion National Commander Smedley Butler now a fugitive, it is necessary to rebuild the organisation to remove the stain of partisan politics. No longer will National Commanders be permitted to campaign for politicians, nor will they be permitted to stay once they are career politicians."
 USA_americanism: "Loyal to the Flag"
 USA_americanism_desc: "Unlike the tyrants and despots that are common in the Americas, MacArthur desires not to be a Great Man, but to be a respected and mortal leader of Americans. Loyalty to the unchanging ideal of America must be put above himself, so long as MacArthur's popularity holds out."
 USA_martial_law: "Martial Law"
 USA_martial_law_desc: "At Congressional approval, habeas corpus is suspended in accordance with the constitution. As the threat of invasion from Syndicalist and Populist forces still looms over part of the land, the writ of habeas corpus and free speech is still suspended for political expediency."
 USA_fbi_cointelpro: "Second American Protective League"
 USA_fbi_cointelpro_desc: "As the largest part of the Continuous United States has been pacified, it is essential that American citizens remain vigilant. The reformation of the League aims to create a free information system to report potential populist or syndicalist spies to the Federal Government and to discourage public protest."
 USA_control_congress: "Control Congress"
 USA_control_congress_desc: "Many former Democrats and Republicans have folded into MacArthur's new regime, while holdouts have fled. Fortunately, we were able to fill their vacancies with qualified, trustworthy individuals. These new Congressmen are not politicians per se, they are instead public servants for the American people."
 USA_office_of_war_information: "Signals Intelligence Service"
 USA_office_of_war_information_desc: "Cryptographic machines designed to interact with its sender to create an encryption that cannot be easily broken are the newest toy in our arsenal. The Signals Intelligence Service, which required the installation of underground cables to ensure secrecy, has finally been implemented."
 USA_allien_sedition_acts: "Executive Order 7250-A"
 USA_allien_sedition_acts_desc: "An Executive Order signed by President MacArthur hopes to bring an end to the threat of foreign infiltration. This order restores some parts of the Alien and Sedition Act, notorious in the early 1800s. State legislations are already appealing cases to the Supreme Court. It is firmly believed, however, that MacArthur's new judges will side in his favour."
 USA_empower_the_army: "Empower the Army"
 USA_empower_the_army_desc: "Crisis has already arisen in our new military administration. The Army and Navy are constantly at each other's throats over funding and political kickbacks. We need to relegate the Navy to a secondary governmental position and grant the Army full power."
 USA_loyal_officers: "Old Soldiers Never Die"
 USA_loyal_officers_desc: "The new regime recognises the long struggle of the officers that left their homes to protect their nation, and to the many that didn't return home. Thanks to an Executive Order, officers may now pursue a technical education in universities or go into law. This will ensure loyalty long after we fade away."
 USA_loyalty_to_macarthur: "The Commander-in-Chief"
 USA_loyalty_to_macarthur_desc: "The role of the President as Commander-in-Chief goes back to President Washington. Washington set the precedent of retiring from active duty upon taking office, which MacArthur promises he will do once the national emergency is ended. Like Washington, MacArthur will remain ready to respond to threats to the nation."
 USA_national_rehabilition: "National Rehabilitation"
 USA_national_rehabilition_desc: "The creeds of Long and Reed were wrong: it was not the industrialists and businessmen that caused civil strife, but the greedy career politician that gave them posts and took their money. We shall rehabilitate the capitalists to their proper position in American society."
 USA_root_out_traitors: "Root out Traitors"
 USA_root_out_traitors_desc: "Our intelligence services have identified the enablers of radicalism and greed in America. They are the disloyal Prohibitionists, Grangers, Holy Rollers and foreigners that enabled the AFP and SPA to grow. These organisations have been rightfully banned for their implicit betrayal."
 USA_loyalty_to_america: "Loyalty to America"
 USA_loyalty_to_america_desc: "Nationalism has the goal of strengthening loyalty to the idea of America more than any American as a person. President MacArthur has chosen to refocus attention from himself to the nation as an object of admiration. No longer will a politician's ego exceed their stature, as the nation is mightier than he."
 USA_american_stratocracy: "American Stratocracy"
 USA_american_stratocracy_desc: "MacArthur has finally restored nationalist fervour and functional democracy as he sees it. While some complain that career politicians have been replaced by officers, few will argue that the bureaucracy hasn't improved. The American people can now trust their politicians to use legal means to achieve their goals."

 USA_reintroduce_gwbill: "Reintroduce the Garner-Wagner Bill"
 USA_reintroduce_gwbill_desc: "While originally vetoed in 1932, the economic situation in America has deteriorated to the point where unemployment relief efforts are seen as the only way to prevent widespread collapse. President Hoover has indicated to the Democrats in Congress that, this time, he will not veto the Garner-Wagner relief bill."
 USA_gwbill_fails: "The Bill Fails"
 USA_gwbill_fails_desc: "The Garner-Wagner Bill has failed to pass. This leaves America without a clear route towards recovery, and with a growing insurgency which will need to be addressed."
 USA_war_plan_white: "War Plan White"
 USA_war_plan_white_desc: "War Plan White is a military action plan to contend with domestic violence or an insurgency. It's time to dust off the plan and deal directly with the growing violence in America."
 USA_deploy_national_guard: "Deploy the National Guard"
 USA_deploy_national_guard_desc: "The violence caused by supporters of the America First Party and the Socialist Party of America is only getting worse. We need to increase funding to National Guard units, and put them where their efforts will count most."
 USA_macarthur_plan: "MacArthur's Plan"
 USA_macarthur_plan_desc: "General MacArthur has raised a solid point: New York City and Texas are two of our most vital, and vulnerable, strongholds. MacArthur has a plan which could see one of these areas secured, should the violence escalate to a full civil war."
 USA_gwbill_succeeds: "The Bill Passes"
 USA_gwbill_succeeds_desc: "The Garner-Wagner bill has been passed! This is good news for America's economy - though now we must find ways to fund the bill, or the good news isn't going to last."
 USA_new_shipyards: "Shipyard Funding Scheme"
 USA_new_shipyards_desc: "Two major shipbuilding companies are vying for federal relief funding, and the one we select could mean a large number of new jobs in the region. The trouble is: which one do we focus on?"
 USA_hawking_plan: "The Barkley Plan"
 USA_hawking_plan_desc: "Alben Barkley, Democrat and junior Senator for Kentucky, has proposed a plan which would see the Garner-Wagner bill funded by increased corporate income taxes. The plan is controversial with some, but it just might give the economy the boost it needs."
 USA_new_industrial_act: "The New Industrial Act"
 USA_new_industrial_act_desc: "We need to kickstart heavy industry in America's heartlands, where the Great Depression has hit the hardest."
 USA_demand_repayment: "Demand Repayment of War Debts"
 USA_demand_repayment_desc: "The United Kingdom incurred an enormous war debt to us during the Weltkrieg. That debt has been inherited by Canada. While it's unlikely Canada could repay it right now, demanding repayment will appease isolationists in Congress, whom we believe will join the political fringe if not appeased."
 USA_reconciliation_with_canada: "Reconciliation with Canada"
 USA_reconciliation_with_canada_desc: "The isolationists are elated, but at the cost of our relations with Canada. We can try rebuilding those relations by offering a compromise: some assistance from Canada now, with the debt deferred until after the war. In exchange, we'll reduce the import tariffs from the Entente."
 USA_pass_tariff_act: "Pass the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act"
 USA_pass_tariff_act_desc: "Canada refused to repay the war debts - unsurprisingly - and thus in return our only option is to pass punitive tariffs on Entente goods imported into the US. That will put some money in our coffers, though repairing relations with Canada will take a long, long time."

 USA_old_order_prevails: "The Old Order Prevails"
 USA_old_order_prevails_desc: "Despite the challenge presented by the America First Party and the Socialist Party of America, the two-party system has managed to hold onto the presidency. The question facing the United States now is whether that will be enough to maintain peace."
 USA_velvet_glove: "The Velvet Glove"
 USA_velvet_glove_desc: "The only hope for peace in America is to sit down with the SPA controlling the AFL and IWW and end this general strike."
 USA_company_bailouts: "Direct Economic Intervention"
 USA_company_bailouts_desc: "The way out of the Great Depression is by offering a bailout to corporations, as well as mandating a bank holiday to allow them time to stabilise. If the corporations are healthy, they can put America back to work and correct this market irregularity."
 USA_offer_fair_deal: "Austerity through the Storm"
 USA_offer_fair_deal_desc: "Austerity measures on government agencies and increased taxes are the way out of the Great Depression. This means combatting both the AFP and the SPA to see such measures passed and enforced."
 USA_iron_fist: "The Iron Fist"
 USA_iron_fist_desc: "Enough diplomacy! The Socialist Party of America and America First are purely secessionist groups whose organisation must be ended at any cost."
 USA_president_long: "President Long"
 USA_president_long_desc: "The impossible has occurred and America First have gained the presidency. The AFP does not, however, have control over Senate or the House of Representatives, and President Long thus faces both a wary legislature and a country on the verge of utter chaos."
 USA_pass_relief_bill: "Pass the Relief Bill"
 USA_pass_relief_bill_desc: "Long's first priority must be to offer relief to the numerous unemployed Americans oppressed by the Great Depression, even if it must be delivered via a presidential Executive Order. The Relief Bill is the first step in implementing the Share Our Wealth program."
 USA_fight_anarchists: "Fight the Anarchists"
 USA_fight_anarchists_desc: "Long's dreams of sharing the wealth cannot be achieved so long as the SPA has a choke-hold on American labour with the general strike ongoing since the beginning of the year. They must be brought down before America can live."
 USA_president_reed: "President Reed"
 USA_president_reed_desc: "Jack Reed has become the first socialist president of the United States of America. The SPA's majority in Congress, is extremely slim, however, and thus he will have a difficult time delivering on his promises of mending the exploitative relationship of labour and capital."
 USA_sweeping_reforms: "Enact Sweeping Reforms"
 USA_sweeping_reforms_desc: "Reforms dismantling business trusts and reducing the power of private banks to expropriate property must be passed, even if they must be delivered via a presidential Executive Order."

 USA_focus_on_long_desc: "America First and Huey Long will never allow a socialist agenda of any kind to restore America, and thus these radicals must be named persona non grata before anything else is done."

 USA_restart_examining_boards: "Restart Examining Boards"
 USA_restart_examining_boards_desc: "The Army's review process has had its share of reformers, but by-and-large the system has remained stagnant for a decade. McNair insists that improvements can be made."
 USA_efficient_production_program: "Efficient Production Program"
 USA_efficient_production_program_desc: "The unemployed masses that stand waiting for a job are the perfect test subjects for creating taylor-timekeeping tables for efficient production."
 USA_shock_and_awe: "Shock and Awe"
 USA_shock_and_awe_desc: "Entrenchment can turn an open field into a stagnant killing ground, and despite our better nature, we must employ the heaviest artillery shells in order to force our enemies to retreat in such a scenario."
 USA_take_the_fight_abroad: "Take the Fight Abroad"
 USA_take_the_fight_abroad_desc: "Finally, the top brass is satisfied with the progress we have put into the Army. Now we just need a target to put rubber to the road."
 USA_military_research: "Military Research"
 USA_military_research_desc: "Our national security is threatened by the asymmetrical advancement of technology. We cannot be blindsided by an enemy with some previously unknown weapon of war. We must increase military research and development funding drastically."

 USA_liberty_bonds: "Liberty Bonds"
 USA_liberty_bonds_desc: "Funding the war effort will require more than victory gardens and volunteerism. Liquid assets are in short supply, especially with our economic programs ongoing. We can capitalise on public trust and implement War Bonds as most other free nations do."

 USA_army_rangers_desc: "Training Regiments to acclimatise soldiers into new environments will enable American soldiers to fight effectively no matter where the course of war may take them.

Let us found this organisation."
 USA_walkie_talkies: "Walkie Talkies"
 USA_walkie_talkies_desc: "Usually military equipment has strong names. Walkie Talkie? How did that slip through the system? Our generals claim that this new untethered communication device will enable our troops to speak effectively when they're in the field. And we called it Walkie Talkie?"
 USA_defense_logistics_agency: "Defense Logistics Agency"
 USA_defense_logistics_agency_desc: "The layout of the United States may be suited for interstate commerce, but is unprepared for massive deployments. We must correct this."
 USA_increase_military_production: "Increase Military Production"
 USA_increase_military_production_desc: "The gratefully employed are in our factories toiling towards victory, though they may not believe that. Where propaganda has failed, monetary incentive will work to increase production."

 USA_tank_competition_desc: "Tank designs are a dime a dozen, we need a streamlined system to determine which design will best fill its role in combat."
 USA_armored_cavalry: "Armoured Cavalry"
 USA_armored_cavalry_desc: "Top officers have long had experience in cavalry and have designed and planned to transform motorised and tanks to fit new needs. Working closely with the government, the military, Henry Ford and other Industrialists, we can make this plan a reality."
 USA_gi_bill: "G.I. Bill"
 USA_gi_bill_desc: "Young men have a variety of motivations for going to war. The G.I. Bill will hopefully encompass those motivators that patriotism cannot reach."
 USA_fighter_development: "Fighter Development"
 USA_fighter_development_desc: "While we were still stuck with the P-26 Peashooter, our national companies have made huge breakthroughs with the P-36 Hawk, the Seversky P-35, the P-39 Airacobra and the new Prototypes of the P-40 Warhawk which could give us an edge on the battlefield. Let us fund these companies so that their projects may enter mass production."
 USA_expand_air_corps_tactical_school: "Expand the Air Corps Tactical School"
 USA_expand_air_corps_tactical_school_desc: "We are in need of a space to train new pilots for the variety of operations the Air Force handles. In Virginia, a section of the ACTS has remained loyal to us, despite all shortcomings of the Air Force, and their installations and expertise may prove vital to train the airmen of tomorrow."
 USA_expand_wasps: "Create the WASPs"
 USA_expand_wasps_desc: "The Women Air Force Service Pilots will help support the Air Force, while they will be subordinate to the main male air-force and not be allowed to fly in combat situations, they will help to keep our boys flying in the air."
 USA_screaming_eagles: "'Screaming Eagles' Program"
 USA_screaming_eagles_desc: "General John C.H. Lee is insisting on starting off a new experiment in Air Assaults done in response to the Hang-glider operations pioneered in Europe. With airborne forces we will be able to overwhelm defenders from multiple angles in ways that it was impossible decades ago. As such, the general staff has authorised the experiments and funding shall be diverged to it."

 USA_radar_development_desc: "RADAR, the top-secret technology to detect air movement will allow our sky watchers to rest easy at night."
 USA_expand_the_USAAC: "Expand the USAAC"
 USA_expand_the_USAAC_desc: "The United States Air Army Corps, in service since 1926, has largely remained on the sidelines of military development. Despite receiving a meagre budget, they've yet managed to innovate in many aspects and High Command barely sees any reason to reform. Provided High Command's disputes in the past few years with Airmen, it has been decided they'd be better off remaining as an integral part of the Army."
 USA_create_the_USAAF: "Create the USAAF"
 USA_create_the_USAAF_desc: "The United States Air Army Force is the success of both the airman and the politician. With the dream of Billy Mitchell realised in all but name, we can now focus on improving on Harold L. George's doctrine and enhancing America's long range strike capabilities."
 USA_modernize_cavalry_tactics: "Modernise Cavalry Tactics"
 USA_modernize_cavalry_tactics_desc: "It was apparent from our observers in the Weltkrieg that new tactics and technologies are becoming vital in the battlefield. Bearing this in mind, it's no wonder General Chaffee has seen fit to redistribute new manuals specifying how to use and counter armoured advances as the old counter-cavalry tactics grow outdated."
 USA_mechanization_program: "Mechanisation Program"
 USA_mechanization_program_desc: "The speeds Chaffe is promising on new vehicles will require a systematic change in how we build and maintain military vehicles."
 USA_top_notch_artillery: "Top-Notch Artillery"
 USA_top_notch_artillery_desc: "Artillery pieces will need to be stronger as well as lighter if we are to respond to battlefield changes as the plan dictates. McNair's expertise in the 1920s with the Examining boards seems to have not gone to waste, and he has proposed an overhaul of the American Artillery production which he projects will lead to artillery pieces being easier to produce and repair, as well as more accurate on the battlefield."
 USA_production_priority: "Production Prioritisation"
 USA_production_priority_desc: "As our War Industry hums along, McNair has stressed the necessity of the usage of both Anti Air and Anti Tank cannons to stop both armoured and aerial threats dead in their tracks. However, High Command will require some solid report evidence to divert the funding McNair is requesting..."
 USA_CAS_doctrine: "Air-To-Ground Cooperation Exercises"
 USA_CAS_doctrine_desc: "While the USAAC has technically worked with the Army for well over a decade, they have hardly ever worked together. The Army is now requesting the Air Force to support their advances, and provided that doing so blindly might lead to friendly fire, generals are being paired in specific combat areas to exercise their coordination and to make sure our casualties are minimised."
 USA_CAS_model: "CAS Model Development"
 USA_CAS_model_desc: "As the Air Corps never intended to be integrated into the army, hardly any development has gone into newer Close Air Support Models. Thankfully, Contractors have already been kind enough to provide us with prototypes like the Brewster XSBA-1 and the already ageing Northrop A-17 \"Drifter\". High Command will need to choose carefully who'll become our main Attack Bomber if we wish to succeed..."
 USA_strategic_bomber_development: "Strategic Bomber Development"
 USA_strategic_bomber_development_desc: "America hardly has any enemies within attack range to fear. As such, there has been a generalised thought that has been taking over the USAAF, spread by a group led by famous airmen like Carl Spaatz. The Army has dubbed them the \"Bomber Mafia\" due to their methods, and this \"Bomber Mafia\" is now requesting the funding to further expand on their long range strike plans."
 USA_strategic_bombing_doctrine: "Strategic Bombing Doctrine"
 USA_strategic_bombing_doctrine_desc: "The idea pushed by Spaatz and his acquaintances is a rather simple one: The Enemy won't be able to continue fighting if the home for which they are fighting for no longer exists. By destroying both their industry and their fighting spirit at the homefront, our troops will prevail both in morale and equipment on the front line."
 USA_long_range_escorts: "Long Range Escorts"
 USA_long_range_escorts_desc: "While having better bombers is vital to win the war of tomorrow at the enemy's doorstep, these bombers can seldom operate on their own. They will need an escort capable of facing off enemy fighters and come back in one piece. Luckily for us, plane designer Kelly Johnson has contacted us with a new and innovative design: The P-38, dubbed \"The Lightning\"."
 USA_aerodrome_construction: "Aerodrome Construction"
 USA_aerodrome_construction_desc: "We should pepper the nation with airfields, enabling our Airmen to reach any part of the nation easily."

 USA_flexible_bombers: "Flexible Bombers"
 USA_flexible_bombers_desc: "The Army has stated they require multi-purpose air craft that can easily adapt to battle situations. Thankfully for us, our private contractors have come up with the NA-40, which could serve as a baseline to a new flexible bomber model, which the airmen insist on naming after Billy Mitchell despite High Command's protests. We shall fund these development efforts."
 USA_Quesada_CAS: "Quesada's Close Air Support"
 USA_Quesada_CAS_desc: "General Quesada has a very hands-on attitude to directing Air missions, and his approach to air tactics is near revolutionary for our young Air Force. Let us fund his efforts and help distribute his manuals to pilots so our CAS doctrine may be the best in the world!"
 USA_new_arms_factories: "New Arms Factories"
 USA_new_arms_factories_desc: "The main trouble with creating a military industry is that facilities under our control were already reduced from the Great Depression to reduce redundancies. We have had to expand facilities and repurpose old buildings in order to manufacture parts needed for heavy weapons in our territory."
 USA_new_tank_assemblies: "New Tank Assemblies"
 USA_new_tank_assemblies_desc: "Armoured warfare will change the face of the battlefield forever. We cannot sid idly as the world rearms, and with the Tank, we may be able to beat our enemies in a matter of weeks instead of years. As such, it would be a priority for us to build more of these deadly machines, so that we may be ready for fight for freedom not only in America, but on the whole world."
 USA_woman_army_corps: "Create the Women's Army Corps"
 USA_woman_army_corps_desc: "Despite protests from socially conservative elements in the US Army, the Commander in Chief has stood firm in defence of the Women's Army Corps. Led by Secretary of the Department of Health, Oveta Hobby, the WAC has received more than twice their requested number of volunteers. Women's Auxiliary will help maintain and safeguard our weapons of war, and keep our massive supply chain working."
 USA_new_rifle_development: "Rifle Improvements"
 USA_new_rifle_development_desc: "While the M1 Johnson managed to see us through the Civil War, its flaws were as noticeable when it was adopted as they are now. However, with the criticism we have gathered during the civil war, we have contacted the original designer, and he has assured us that by redesigning the barrel, gas cylinder, and front sight assembly, he will make the Garand an even more reliable and deadly weapon."
 USA_tis_ill_defend: "'This We'll Defend'"
 USA_tis_ill_defend_desc: "The US Army has reached a new peak in both size and efficiency. We can rely on them to defend our values both domestically and abroad, and in the process, High Command has managed to learn some valuable lessons that give us an edge over inexperienced militaries."
 USA_Craig_plan_desc: "Malin Craig's plan is the only plan that guarantees a large fighting force in the shortened time frame we have given."
 USA_hierarchical_reorganization: "Hierarchical Reorganisation"
 USA_hierarchical_reorganization_desc: "The meritocracy in the US Army has fallen to the wayside for nepotism and incompetence. We must reaffirm the code of the US Army and ingrain this in our staff hierarchy."
 USA_joint_chiefs_of_staff: "Joint Chiefs of Staff"
 USA_joint_chiefs_of_staff_desc: "The disputes common in the Federal inter-service politics persist in our own government. In order to avoid this interdisciplinary contention from spilling over, we must ensure that all our Chiefs of Staff are given equal attention."
 USA_establish_a_new_officer_training_center: "Establish a New Officer Training Centre"
 USA_establish_a_new_officer_training_center_desc: "With the immediate danger posed to our most prestigious officer schools, we must reorganise and fund new schools in safer territory."
 USA_a_gun_for_every_hand: "A Gun for Every Hand"
 USA_a_gun_for_every_hand_desc: "A priority of General Craig is not only the Mobilisation of large infantry units, but the consistency of supplies for them. As such, he insists that a second budget needs to be drawn, one that favours Weapon contractors heavily to produce more equipment so our troops at the front may be able to fight with a full kit against any threat."
 USA_engineer_corps_expansion: "Engineer Corps Expansion"
 USA_engineer_corps_expansion_desc: "We are finally able to provide enough infrastructure and planning to provide Engineering Corps in the field. Through coordinating our intelligence network with scouting and surveillance systems, we are able to ensure that non-combat elements in battle are accounted for and able to complete their tasks."
 USA_american_auto_industry: "American Auto Industry"
 USA_american_auto_industry_desc: "Since the invention of the Automobile, it has been taken up in earnest by the people of America. Most of the factories for cars are in the north where the syndicalists are running things. However, J. Kaiser has moved North, so we should encourage other companies to follow in his footsteps."
 USA_cult_of_aviation: "Spaatz's Air Superiority"
 USA_cult_of_aviation_desc: "General Carl Spaatz has long since been growing in notoriety within the USAAC and USAAF. The success of his ideas on the field of battle have proven that Spaatz's approach to air warfare may be correct, and as such, the Army should focus on promoting and distributing manuals regardless of disagreements with the \"Bomber Mafia\" so that our pilots may learn and apply his ideas on the skies."

### Military - Navy ###
 USA_navy: "US Navy"
 USA_navy_desc: "The American navy, an institution whose history is so deeply interwoven with that of the nation as a whole, has been in steady decline after years of neglect. No more! We must again turn our attention to naval affairs."
 USA_grand_navy: "Great White Fleet"
 USA_grand_navy_desc: "The Great White Fleet was the height to American naval power. We should look back at it for inspiration. A great fleet of battleships and dreadnoughts will ensure we always have naval superiority."

 USA_light_cruisers: "Light Cruiser Development"
 USA_light_cruisers_desc: "Lighter cruisers are important in anti-air operations, as well as attacking enemy destroyers and submarines. We should ensure our navy has a handful of these in order to stay balanced."
 USA_naval_aviation: "Naval Aviation"
 USA_naval_aviation_desc: "Naval aviation is the future of warfare on the high seas. We should ensure that our air designs are capable of being launched from carriers and destroying the enemy fleet without even endangering our own."
 USA_expand_dockyards: "Expand Dockyards"
 USA_expand_dockyards_desc: "Our dockyards are somewhat inadequate to fight a war on their own. We need to ensure that new naval production facilities are constructed to support the war effort."
 USA_submarines: "Submarine Development"

 USA_new_ship_buildings: "Maritime Industry"
 USA_new_ship_buildings_desc: "America has a naval tradition rivalled only by the great powers of Europe, and an equally illustrious history of naval production and innovation.

 USA_new_admirals: "New Admirals"
 USA_new_admirals_desc: "In the face of crisis, many admirals committed the greatest treason - desertion. We should train a new generation of naval leaders to ensure our continued maritime dominance."
 USA_expand_waves: "Create the WAVES"
 USA_expand_waves_desc: "Women can serve many auxiliary roles in the navy, freeing up men for combat duty. While this might be socially controversial, it will significantly help the war effort."
 USA_marine_corps: "Improve the Marine Corps"
 USA_marine_corps_desc: "The Marine Corps was the epitome of American power projection around the globe. From the shores of Tripoli to the halls of Montezuma, the Marines were always there. We should ensure they have modern equipment and training."

 USA_monroe_doctrine: "The Monroe Doctrine"
 USA_monroe_doctrine_desc: "The American government failed in its duty to protect the post-colonial world from foreign imperialists and political infiltration.

 USA_pan_american_confrence_desc: "The President has announced the convention of the first Pan-American Conference since 1910.

 USA_good_neighboor_policy: "Good Neighbour Policy"
 USA_good_neighboor_policy_desc: "At the Pan-American Conference, the Good Neighbour Policy was first drawn up.

 USA_naval_treaty: "Inter-American Naval Treaty"
 USA_naval_treaty_desc: "The Fifth Agreement is the Inter-American Naval Treaty, a very necessary agreement to create a complimentary naval power with our allies in Latin America.

Threats that should have been anticipated were not, and therefore a new set of Rainbow War Plans should be drawn up. These Rainbow War Plans will enable our Military Staff to prepare for conflict before it arises."
 USA_joint_military_training: "Joint Military Training"
 USA_joint_military_training_desc: "The fragile state of peace in the United States has motivated our military to seek training assistance and space outside of our borders, in order to reduce public fears of autocracy. Our alliance has agreed, and have planned war games and training exercises to see how well we would fare in this brave new world."
 USA_economic_muscle: "America Goes Forth"

This new alliance demands instead more cooperative and coordinated operations as our enemy will employ every modern weapon to stop us."
 USA_united_together: "United Together"

 USA_KR_gathering_storm_desc: "The United States of America nearly abandoned isolation to intervene in the European War, but ultimately kept out of the conflict. The result was a Central Powers victory, and the country struggled economically thereafter. European trade declined and the repayment of loans to the Entente was precluded by the German victory. Still internationally regarded as a 'nobody', the nation now faces mounting internal dissent as Republican-Democratic hegemony is challenged by the Syndicalists and the America First Party. With a mounting crisis at home and only a modest reputation overseas, things aren't looking good for the United States..."

 USA_country_intro_header: "The United States in 1936"
 USA_country_intro_content: "In 1936, the United States of America are gripped by unrelenting crisis. Although able to avoid the horrors of the Weltkrieg, which allowed its prosperity to continue well into the 1920s, German victory in the Weltkrieg, followed by the French and British Revolutions, led to the Wall Street crash of 1925. This sent the United States spiralling into the Great Depression and allowed the Berlin Stock Market to take its place at the forefront of the world economy.\n\nThe election of Herbert Hoover in 1928, while initially promising, failed entirely to reverse the decline of the American economy, and by 1936 the country had spent over a decade in the midst of the worst financial crisis it had ever seen. This fuelled the rise of radical parties in America from the far-left Socialist Party of America, to the far-right America First Party. Hoover's contentious re-election by means of the House of Representatives in 1932, and the ongoing Great Depression means that these problems are unlikely to be resolved any time soon. Many throughout the country fear the upheaval that would result should one of the extreme parties come to power, or should the Depression continue unabated."

### Events - Pre Election ###
 ustates.2.t: "Black Monday Hits America"
 ustates.2.d: "Despite the political turmoil and ineffectual economic relief programs, it seemed to many as if the economy of the United States might finally be undergoing a slow recovery after the Wall Street Crash of 1925. Black Monday has put an end to such hopes, and has sounded the death-knell for an already ailing economy. Republicans and Democrats have both pledged to fix the economy should they win the election, though public confidence in them is rapidly waning. Both Reed and Long have railed hard against the corrupt banking and political sectors, which they blame for allowing the crash to happen."
 ustates.2.a: "This is just not our year."

 ustates.3.t: "The Coalition Ticket?"
 ustates.3.d: "The 1936 election is looking to be one of the most contentious in American history. Many politicians within the upper circle of the Republican and Democratic Parties fear that a victory by the Socialist Party of America or the America First Party would mean the end of America and the American way of life.\n\nIn order to avoid this, a plan has been proposed within the halls of power to form a coalition ticket between the Republican and Democratic Parties with Farmer-Labor Governor Floyd Olson of Minnesota as the presidential candidate. This plan is unlikely to be popular with lower ranking members of the parties, but it may be the only thing that can prevent the radical parties from gaining strength."
 ustates.3.a: "A Coalition, if you can keep it."
 ustates.3.b: "A Coalition would debase the democratic system."

 ustates.4.t: "Southern Democrats Complain"
 ustates.4.d: "Although the coalition is showing signs of success, there is already some dissent from the various factions. The loudest voices belong to those of the Southern Democrats, many of whom are much more conservative and are facing stiff competition from the America First Party candidates. The coalition has been largely dominated by northern Democrats and Republicans, with Farmer-Labor being the third wing of the coalition. We could try and force a compromise by promising to appoint southern Democrats to the cabinet and other positions of power if we win. Of course, we could also ignore their protest and focus on winning the election instead."
 ustates.4.a: "Let them complain, where else will they go?"
 ustates.4.b: "Promise to appoint them to the cabinet."

 ustates.5.t: "Disunity within the Coalition"
 ustates.5.d: "The Democratic and Republican parties have long been at odds since they came to national prominence. As we try to keep our coalition party together, a number of Democrats and Republicans have been getting into verbal shouting matches in Congress. While they are just minor members, the conflict could destabilise the whole coalition if it is allowed to spread. We can either come down hard on one side, or try to force some kind of compromise by pressuring rabble rousers to keep still until after the election - either way, it should end public dissent for now."
 ustates.5.a: "Side with the Democrats."
 ustates.5.b: "Force a compromise."
 ustates.5.c: "Side with the Republicans."

 ustates.6.t: "Olson's Nomination"
 ustates.6.d: "In a massive rally in Sacramento with leading members from the Republican, Democratic and Farmer-Labor Parties, Governor Olson himself came out to accept his nomination as the National Unity presidential candidate. In perhaps the most widely talked about part of his speech however, he staked out his platform: \"I am what I want to be - I am a radical. I am a radical in the sense that I want definite change in the system. I am not satisfied with tinkering or patching or hanging a laurel wreath upon thieves and pirates and calling them code authorities. I want, however, an orderly, sane, and constructive change. I don't want any visionary things any more than the hardest Tory wants them. But I know the transition can take place and that, of course, it must be gradual. It can't come overnight but I want to do all I can to set it in motion and keep it going steady.\"\n\nWhile more conservative commentators decried his address as tantamount to revolution, and some of Olson's former comrades have accused him of selling out the progressive movement, this massive rally has been surprisingly well received by the press and those attending it. It remains to be seen if this will translate to election results, as well as the change Olson promises."
 ustates.6.a: "Let us pray that this helps us."

 ustates.7.t: "Disunity within the Coalition"
 ustates.7.d: "In Iowa, a number of Farmer-Labor members have gotten into a conflict with the Republicans. The Republicans are accusing Farmer-Labor of alienating people needed to win the election while Farmer-Labor is accusing the Republicans of not pushing for the policies needed to end the Depression. This fighting is driving a wedge in the coalition."
 ustates.7.a: "Side with the Republicans."
 ustates.7.b: "Force a compromise."
 ustates.7.c: "Side with Farmer-Labor."

 ustates.8.t: "Nominating Wendell Willkie"
 ustates.8.d: "Since the nomination of Governor Olson as the National Unity presidential candidate, the politically minded have discussed with great interest the likely vice-presidential candidate. Finally putting the rumours to rest, Democratic lawyer Wendell Willkie was announced as the VP for the coalition ticket yesterday in New York City. A relative newcomer to electoral politics, Willkie gained prominence as an opponent of President Hoover's trade policy, publicly advocating for decreased tariffs and cooperation between the private and public sectors in order to fight the depression. His nomination indicates that the National Unity ticket is seeking to reorient itself towards the centre, as Olson's record as a left-wing Farmer-Labor populist is balanced by the presence of Willkie, a corporate lawyer with years of connections to businesses across the country, yet still largely untainted by his ties to Wall Street.\n\nIn his acceptance speech, Willkie emphasised wanting to help bring major reforms to the country through government intervention in cooperation with businesses. Though this plan was denounced by the SPA and AFP as being nowhere near enough to help the average American, economists believe that it may be enough to end the Depression."
 ustates.8.a: "A simple, barefoot Wall Street lawyer"

 ustates.9.t: "Indian Citizenship Act"
 ustates.9.d: "In order to gain more sympathy from the North and the West, it has been proposed by the Senate and the House that the Indian Citizenship Bill be passed, effectively elevating all indigenous peoples of the United States from second-class citizens to full citizens. Northeastern and Western politicians in both the major parties support this, while some Southern Democrats and Northern Republicans have deemed it frivolous."
 ustates.9.a: "Pass the Act, hopefully, this will gain us some sympathy!"
 ustates.9.b: "Veto the Bill, this is no time for populism."

 ustates.10.t: "The Coalition Falls Apart!"
 ustates.10.d: "The conflicts within the National Unity Party have spiralled out of control and today it seems that the coalition party cannot stand together in Congress. The Republicans, Democrats and Farmer-Labor have all gone their separate ways back to their old rhetoric. The ever-present Capitol rumour mill has it that General Douglas MacArthur could save America, should either Reed or Long take over."
 ustates.10.a: "God save America, for nobody else can..."

 ustates.11.t: "Increasing Radicalisation"
 ustates.11.d: "With the Democrats and Republicans fighting among themselves, as usual, more and more Americans are feeling alienated from the traditional big two and are flocking to the radical AFP and SPA throughout the country. In these dark times, the distinction between genuine social reform and graft is hard to distinguish. Those under the radical banner in their political enclaves have received some social welfare. Share Our Wealth donations from the AFP, and International Red Aid from the SPA. The party machine of these radicals utilises mass media to a much stronger degree than either the Republicans or Democrats. It is looking more and more like the 1936 election will come down to Reed or Long."
 ustates.11.a: "This is really bad."

 ustates.12.t: "Farmer-Labor Flocks to the SPA"
 ustates.12.d: "Minnesota, which has long been a bastion of the Farmer-Labor Governor Floyd Olson, has finally flipped. Many people are turning away from Governor Olson on the direction of the IWW and SPA. Various unions have held rallies for the SPA, and attendance far outstrips our ability to out-shout them."
 ustates.12.a: "Is it something in the water?"

 ustates.13.t: "Southern Democrat Voters Align with the AFP"
 ustates.13.d: "The South has long been considered the heartland of the Democratic Party, but this may not be the case for much longer, as polls show a massive spike in voter registration for the AFP. On a radio broadcast, Huey Long spoke at length about Share Our Wealth and his plans for America. It seems that the AFP is growing stronger by the day."
 ustates.13.a: "What devious conmen."

 ustates.14.t: "MacArthur speaks to Hoover"
 ustates.14.d: "MacArthur has spoken to President Hoover privately about a contingency plan called War Plan White, a military plan for dealing with a possible armed uprising of US citizens. The plan would call on MacArthur to take emergency action to protect the country, and re-erect old barricades in Washington, D.C. This plan can be engaged even from outside Washington D.C, at the Washington Arsenal. While the plan has obviously not been made public, we at least have it as a contingency if the radicals enact one of their revolutions from within government."
 ustates.14.a: "Let us hope this is not needed."

 ustates.15.t: "The Battle of the Overpass"
 ustates.15.d: "In Detroit, Michigan, the automotive capital of the world, Walter Reuther and Richard Frankenstein, the leaders of the United Auto Workers association, called a general strike against the Ford Motor Company and proclaim themselves for \"Unionism, Not Ford-ism\", demanding higher pay and fewer hours for automotive workers.\n\nAt 2:00 PM today, a photographer from the Detroit Free Press asked to take a photo of the leaders of the UAW standing on the overpass with the Ford sign in the background. While they were posing, a group of forty men from the Ford's Service Department, approached them from behind and began to beat them with their batons. The group then continued their attack on some of the beret-wearing women present to pass out leaflets."
 ustates.15.a: "This will hurt us more than it hurt the Unionists!"

 ustates.16.t: "Representatives Retiring"
 ustates.16.d: "Many Republicans and Democratic Representatives have announced that this year will be their last year in Congress. While many retirees claim old age motivated them, rumours of gang intimidation by SPA and AFP Congressmen reminds many of the Congressional brawl between Charles Sumner and Preston Brooks. The unprecedented rate of their retirement has given hope to the AFP and SPA that they can win these open elections."
 ustates.16.a: "Let us hope they get good replacements."

 ustates.17.t: "Violence between the SPA and AFP"
 ustates.17.d: "In a number of major cities, conflicts between supporters of the America First Party and the Socialist Party have broken out in violence. Partisan fist fights and even shoot-outs are starting to become a regular occurrence throughout the nation as the country spirals ever deeper into chaos. While public eruptions are easy to counter, the enclaves these radicals have cut out of city blocks run on graft are harder to stop.\n\nAmidst the chaos, moderate elements of the country have grown fearful of the extremist factions and the beleaguered Establishment campaigns have seen a wave of donations and volunteers. Both Landon and Garner have made promises to reverse the depression and bring back order, and Governor Olson has launched an aggressive counterattack to reclaim his supporters. However, as the country groans under the weight of economic depression and political instability, many fear the political system they've put their trust in for decades will soon give out."
 ustates.17.a: "This is just not our year."

 ustates.18.t: "Father Charles Coughlin's CBS Radio Broadcasts"
 ustates.18.d: "Three years ago today, Father Charles Coughlin began a weekly radio broadcast in America, and now has an audience of over 50 million people. He is a raving anti-Semite, who claims that the Syndicalist Revolution in France was \"fomented by the Jew\" and that the Berlin Stock Market Crash is an \"International conspiracy of Jewish Bankers\" and somehow people still tune in. His hate-speech will not be tolerated by the Church, and the Pope is expected to make a decision whether to ask the United States government to shut down his broadcast, so that his hateful message cannot reach the public."
 ustates.18.a: "Coughlin is a becoming a danger to the public, shut him down."
 ustates.18.b: "I hate what he says, but I defend his right to say it."

 ustates.19.t: "Huey Long Speaks"
 ustates.19.d: "The Democratic Party and the Republican Party were just like the old patent medicine drummer that used to come around our county. He had two bottles of medicine. He'd play the banjo and he'd sell two bottles of medicine.\n\nOne of those bottles of medicine was called High Popalorum and another one of those bottles of medicine was called Low Popahirum.\n\nFinally somebody around there said is there any difference between these bottles of medicines? \"Oh,' he said, \"considerable. They're both good but they're different,\" he said.\n\n'That High Popalorum is made from the bark off the tree that we take from the top down. And that Low Popahirum is made from the bark that we take from the root up.'\n\nAnd the only difference that I have found between the Democratic leadership and the Republican leadership was that one of \"em was skinning you from the ankle up and the other from the ear down — when I got to Congress."
 ustates.19.a: "Homely sayings do not win elections."

 ustates.20.t: "Death of Big Bill Haywood"
 ustates.20.d: "Today one of the titans of the Industrial Workers of the World, William \"Big Bill\" Haywood, has passed away. His death marks the passing of a torch. Elizabeth Gurley Flynn spoke at the funeral saying \"History has a long-range perspective. It ultimately passes stern judgement on tyrants and vindicates those who fought, suffered, were imprisoned, and died for human freedom, against political oppression and economic slavery.\"\n\nMany other leaders within various Union organisations including his rivals in the AFL also spoke at his funeral as well as leaders within the Socialist Party of America. Jack Reed also spoke at the funeral ending his speech with some of Haywood's quotes, \"If the workers are organised, all they have to do is to put their hands in their pockets and they have got the capitalist class whipped. A strike is an incipient revolution. Many large revolutions have grown out of a small strike. Remember that you are fighting more than your own fight. You are fighting for the entire working class and you must stand together.\""
 ustates.20.a: "I already miss him."

 ustates.21.t: "Violence Reaches the Political Theatre"
 ustates.21.d: "For some time the violence has been mostly between the supporters of the radical parties, however recently the violence is now reaching the candidates and politicians themselves. Failed attempts on the lives of both Huey Long and Jack Reed have occurred in the past few months. Both gunmen shooting from a crowd, both failed, and both resulted in higher security. Several more local politicians have been stabbed during a campaign rally. Moreover, voters from both extremes are turning a blind eye to the violence done to their enemies."
 ustates.21.a: "Great, more violence."

 ustates.22.t: "May Day Riots"
 ustates.22.d: "May Day, International Workers day, this is a holiday that the Socialist Party celebrates with numerous parades and speeches and has since its founding. Generally, things are peaceful, though there have been confrontations with the police. However, this time things are more violent than normal. Clashes between the Socialists and the local police backed up by the AFP have occurred around the country. The question is who is at fault? The Socialists declare that things were peaceful till the police and the AFP goons arrived on the scene. The AFP is saying that the Socialists began by assaulting ununionised workers, and have blurry photos they claim are guns the SPA were brandishing."
 ustates.22.a: "The SPA were at fault."
 ustates.22.b: "The police were at fault."

 ustates.23.t: "Saint Patrick's Day Flood"
 ustates.23.d: "On March 16, 1936, warmer than usual temperatures led to the melting of large amounts of snow and ice on the upper Allegheny and Monongahela rivers. The rivers and their tributaries had already overflowed their banks and were soon threatening the city of Pittsburgh. On March 17, 1936, the waters reached the flood stage of twenty-five feet. Then, overnight, heavy rain caused the water to rise even higher, and on March 18, the water peaked at about forty-six feet, twenty-one feet above the flood stage.\n\nThis is the worst such disaster in the city's history, and local authorities have already requested federal aid."
 ustates.23.a: "We must help the people."
 ustates.23.b: "They will have to help themselves."

 ustates.24.t: "Red Summer"
 ustates.24.d: "The summer heat has turned into violence and blood as cities, starting with Charleston, South Carolina, throughout the country engaged in bloody racial riots as whites beat up blacks and burned black businesses. The number of lynchings that occurred throughout the country spiked during the summer. In response, The African Blood Brotherhood and other elements of the SPA and CSA have begun arming and fighting back. The Socialist Party of America have defended their actions, and have furnished blurry photos they claim show AFP members in lynch mobs."
 ustates.24.a: "Can this year get any worse?"

 ustates.25.t: "Special Election in New Jersey!"
 ustates.25.d: "Following Senator A. Harry Moore's resignation in order to run for governor, a special election has been called in New Jersey to select his replacement. The front-runners are Democrat John Gerald Milton and AFP spokesman Charles Lindbergh. Polls have just closed, and the winner appears to be..."
 ustates.25.a: "John Gerald Milton (Democratic Party)"
 ustates.25.b: "Charles Lindbergh (America First Party)"

 ustates.26.t: "Special Election in Washington"
 ustates.26.d: "Following the death of Senator Wesley Lloyd, a special election has been called in Washington to fill his seat. The front-runners are SPA activist John F. McKay and Democratic Congressman John Main Coffee. Polls have just closed, and the winner appears to be..."
 ustates.26.a: "John F. McKay (Socialist Party)"
 ustates.26.b: "John Main Coffee (Democratic Party)"

 ustates.27.t: "Crime Spree Sweeps the Nation"
 ustates.27.d: "As America spirals ever deeper into chaos, there has been a wave of crime throughout the country. Many of these criminals are getting sensationalist news stories about their activities, especially gangsters like John Dillinger and the scandalous Bonnie & Clyde. Thankfully the Bureau of Investigation has been working hard to catch these criminals and bring some order back to America. Of course, the AFP and SPA have begun attributing these crimes to moral decline and robber baronies respectively."
 ustates.27.a: "Stop right there criminal scum!"

 ustates.28.t: "Paramilitary Militias forming"
 ustates.28.d: "With violence and instability sweeping the country, the AFP and SPA have begun to form various paramilitary militias, which they claim are necessary to protect the people. The AFP have called their group the \"Minutemen\", while the SPA has named their forces the \"Red Guards\". Seen patrolling their strongholds and party rallies, these well-armed and equipped paramilitary units have already engaged in scattered, though extremely violent conflicts. We believe the paramilitaries are modifying civilian firearms, and the FBI's attempts to seize weapon stockpiles are too slow to stop gun runners. This could turn very bad, very fast."
 ustates.28.a: "This is not good."

 ustates.29.t: "More AFP Members Announcing Congressional Bids"
 ustates.29.d: "While there have been a number of lawmakers from the America First Party in its brief life, particularly in the South, the 1936 election has seen an unprecedented number of people registering to run for office under the banner of the AFP and just as many, if not more nationwide, pledging to vote for them."
 ustates.29.a: "Interesting."

 ustates.30.t: "More SPA Members Announcing Congressional Bids"
 ustates.30.d: "While there have been a number of lawmakers from the Socialist Party of America in the past few decades, particularly in the Steel Belt, the 1936 election has seen an unprecedented number of people registering to run for office under the banner of the SPA and just as many, if not more nationwide, pledging to vote for them."
 ustates.30.a: "Interesting."

 ustates.31.t: "Gone with the Wind"
 ustates.31.d: "Today, Margaret Mitchell published her novel \"Gone with the Wind\", which immediately became a bestseller, and may be nominated for the next Pulitzer Prize. Even Hollywood is taking notice, and is planning a film adaptation to be released next year. Set in the Old South during the American Civil War, many see it as an analogy for the strained political situation in the United States; many America First Southerners claim the novel supports their cause."
 ustates.31.a: "Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn."

 ustates.32.t: "The Great Heat Wave of '36"
 ustates.32.d: "A heat wave has struck the continental United States and Canada. The most severe heat wave in the modern history of North America, \"The Great Heat Wave\" started in late June and went up over 100°F (38°C) as drought conditions worsened due to a continued lack of rain. Now, in July, the heat has reached all-time records. In Steele, North Dakota, temperatures have reached 121°F (50°C). In Ohio, temperatures have reached 110°F (43°C), which was close to tying a record high set in 1934.\n\nThis comes in a time of major political unrest, with the America First Council a major force in Midwest Politics, and Socialist and Syndicalist forces gathering strength in the Great Lakes region. The drought is continuing, and over 3,000 reported deaths have been linked to it. Many people are suffering from heat stroke and heat exhaustion. Farmers across the continent saw their worst harvest on record, causing corn and wheat prices to skyrocket, and this heat wave does not seem to be giving up any time soon."
 ustates.32.a: "This just isn't our year..."

 ustates.33.t: "The Great Heat Wave is over"
 ustates.33.d: "People from Vancouver and Los Angeles to New York and Washington, D.C. let out a sigh of relief as The Great Heat Wave of 1936 finally came to an end, and now a cold front has spread over North America. It has come to be known as the United States' deadliest natural disaster of the 20th century, with an estimated death toll reaching 5,000. But even as the heat wave ends, a new chapter in American history is about to begin..."
 ustates.33.a: "At least it's over..."

 ustates.34.d.coalition: "The results are finally in from what has probably been the most ideologically contested Presidential election the United States has ever witnessed. None of the three major parties have secured enough votes in the Electoral College to outright win the presidency, and as a result, the House of Representatives has to vote on the winner of the election for the second time this decade. This is probably not the end of our problems, but for the time being, victory goes to..."

None of the four major parties have secured enough votes in the Electoral College to outright win the presidency, and as a result, the House of Representatives has to vote on the winner of the election for the second time this decade. This is probably not the end of our problems, but for the time being, victory goes to..."
 ustates.34.a: "Floyd Olson (National Unity)"
 ustates.34.b: "Jack Reed (Socialist)"
 ustates.34.c: "Huey Long (America First)"
 ustates.34.d: "John Nance Garner (Democrats)"
 ustates.34.e: "Alf Landon (Republicans)"

 ustates.36.t: "SPA Contest Election Results!"
 ustates.36.d: "Members of the Socialist Party of America have refused to accept the results of our free and fair election, claiming that the House of Representatives system has subverted the will of the majority. Jack Reed has said as much, and called the whole of Congress reactionary for this injustice. Independent newspapers reporting tips from inside the SPA have reported that the AFL are beginning to show cracks in their solidarity with Reed, however."
 ustates.36.a: "Damn Reed!"

 ustates.37.t: "AFP Contest Election Results!"
 ustates.37.d: "The America First leadership have contested the results of the election. They claim that Reed's allies have rigged the election and demanded a recount. Huey Long even gave a mocking speech accepting the Presidency to his followers. Some murmurs from inside the AFP have reported that the Democrats that left for the AFP have expressed regret for losing this historic election."
 ustates.37.a: "What a card."

 ustates.38.t: "Hoover Criticises the President"
 ustates.38.d.reed: "Herbert Hoover has been vocal after the election and openly criticised Reed and the SPA as being unfit to lead the country. Hoover has encouraged both the Republicans and Democrats to form an alliance to curb Reed and the SPA."
 ustates.38.d.long: "Herbert Hoover has been vocal after the election and openly criticised Long and the America First as being a dangerous choice for the country. Hoover has encouraged both the Republicans and Democrats to form an alliance to keep Long in check."
 ustates.38.a: "He doesn't matter anymore."

 ustates.39.t: "President Hoover Supports New President"
 ustates.39.d: "Herbert Hoover broke personal political lines to throw his support behind the incoming president, [USA.GetLeader]. Hoover stated that only adherence to the word of the law could bring the country together in these tough times. [USA.GetLeader] in turn has thanked Hoover for his service to his country."
 ustates.39.a: "His support is appreciated."

 ustates.40.t: "The New Year's Day Strike"
 ustates.40.d: "In protest of the election results, the SPA has launched a strike on New Year's Day which has crippled the industries of the north. Councils of Trade Unions and Councils of Professional Workers have been set up to run the cities of the Steel Belt during the strike. The Hearst newspapers have demonised this strike, portraying it as similar to the general strike that set off the British Revolution."
 ustates.40.a: "This is going to cause a problem."

### Reed as President ###
 ustates.41.t: "President Reed's Inaugural Address"
 ustates.41.d: "The country's social problems have forced the American people to turn to radical solutions; the two-party system has broken down, and Jack Reed is to be sworn in as the 31st president of the United States with Norman Thomas being sworn in as the Vice President. In a stirring speech in Washington DC, Reed has pledged to defend the interests of the workers and work to help revolutionise society for the good of all Americans. However, the SPA's slim majority in Congress means that it may find it challenging to pass meaningful legislation, especially in the Senate, where the AFP has promised to filibuster any law it sees as detrimental to America."
 ustates.41.a: "Let the People rejoice!"

 ustates.42.t: "Executive Order 7080: Labour Unions"
 ustates.42.d: "One of Reed's first acts as president to enshrine the rights to collectively bargain in law. Unwilling to wait to overcome the Senate filibuster, and citing the violent conflict between AFP and SPA paramilitaries, Reed passed an executive order that forced state and federal governments to recognise a union's right to exist and engage in collective bargaining, without exception, thus forbidding Yellow Dog contracts. While the unions rejoice, many in the country denounce the executive order as a tyrannical act of the Executive Branch."
 ustates.42.a: "For The Union Makes Us Strong!"

 ustates.43.t: "The Bourgeoisie Are Furious."
 ustates.43.d: "From New York to San Francisco, the rich and powerful protested Reed's election in the Hearst newspapers and in Congressional addresses. It is clear that the upper class is furious at the enforcement of Executive Order 7080, and have begun to radicalise against the SPA as a result."
 ustates.43.a: "Let reactionaries shout"

 ustates.44.t: "Opposition Denounces Reed as Tyrant"
 ustates.44.d: "Though they agreed on little else, the Democrats, Republicans, and the America First Parties have been quick to denounce Reed publicly across the nation for the enactment of Executive Order 7080, claiming that it to be an overreach of the Executive Branch, and the start of the slide into tyranny. Huey Long has gone so far as to have vowed to not follow any law that \"Dictator Reed\" imposes upon America. Long followed up by comparing President Reed to Vladimir Lenin, almost gloating that Reed would share Lenin's fate."
 ustates.44.a: "Shut up, Long"

 ustates.45.t: "Executive Order 7089: Halt on Foreclosures"
 ustates.45.d: "Directing the Secretary of Commerce to Temporarily Take Possession of and Operate the Facilities of Certain Financial Companies\n\nThe inability to deal with the Great Depression had been the death of two major parties, and it could have been the death of the SPA as well, unless Reed acted quickly and decisively. Believing that the corrupt financial sector was primarily responsible for creating and prolonging the Depression, Reed has moved to nationalise the banks of Wall Street to force them to act in the public, rather than the private, good. This includes stopping banks from foreclosing on bankrupt homeowners. A filibuster by Senator Roosevelt has forced Reed to resort to an Executive Order, appealing yet again to national security. While popular with the lower classes, many in the upper classes claim Reed is drunk on his power and well on his way to declare himself a dictator."
 ustates.45.a: "The Rich shall now pay!"

 ustates.46.t: "The Supreme Court Hears Case On Order 7089"
 ustates.46.d: "The Supreme Court has allowed the first challenge to Executive Order 7089, Paul Mattick vs. Standard Oil of California, to be heard. This case is brought by Paul Mattick to argue that Standard Oil's monopolistic power has overtaken democratic power. The accusation of Standard Oil bribing the Boston City Council is being taken very seriously. The nation waits to see if Reed's power will be checked, or whether the SPA will continue to enact their agenda in defiance of the Senate."
 ustates.46.a: "The Court must decide in our favour!"

 ustates.47.t: "Executive Order 7100: Nationalise Minerals"
 ustates.47.d: "Directing the Secretary of the Interior to Temporarily Take Possession of and Operate the Facilities of Certain Mining Companies\n\nThe belief that public land was a public good is essential to most left-leaning parties, and the flagrant abuse of public land by mining companies had long been a source of deep bitterness for the transcendentalists. To most of Reed's cabinet, it was clear that private mining companies would be entirely unable to balance the needs of the public with their greed, and moved to nationalise the drilling and mining companies, including Standard Oil, whose Supreme Court case against Executive Order 7089 was still pending. This has been seen by many as an attack against a political rival, and further confirmation that Reed wishes to turn America into a syndicalist state like the Commune of France or the Union of Britain."
 ustates.47.a: "America's Resources belong to the People!"

 ustates.48.t: "Packing the Court"
 ustates.48.d: "Although Reed has shown no sign of concern over Paul Mattick vs. Standard Oil of California in public, his administration is concerned that the conservative-leaning Supreme Court could rule 7-2 in favour of the capitalists, and revert whatever reforms had already been put in place. Citing Lincoln's court-packing during the Civil War as precedent, Reed has asked Senate Majority Leader Meyer London to remove the filibuster for judicial appointees, and has increased the size of the Supreme Court to 15. It is clear that he intends to appoint 6 pro-socialist justices to the bench, which will ensure his Executive Orders will remain constitutional. This has provoked a firestorm of protest, even from the left-leaning Farmer-Labor and Progressive parties, which had up until now remained neutral or supportive of Reed."
 ustates.48.a: "We must defend the workers, whatever it takes"

 ustates.49.t: "Violence against the SPA Spreads"
 ustates.49.d: "In the immediate aftermath of Reed's court-packing, former Governor Huey Long has come out aggressively against Reed, all but calling for an armed uprising. Whole counties and states, especially in the south, are refusing to accept Reed's Executive Orders as law, and there has been a massive increase in reported violent clashes between the Minutemen and SPA militia. Unless order is restored, the country is bound for a civil war."
 ustates.49.a: "The police should be helping the people!"

 ustates.50.t: "Clashes Between Minutemen and Police"
 ustates.50.d: "Long's calls for a resistance against Reed have been interpreted by some Minutemen as a call for resistance against any governmental agency. Police clashes with Long's Minutemen have now become common throughout the country. In cities with strong SPA presence, members of the General Defense Committees helped the police restore law and order, but in the Deep South, the Minutemen effectively have complete control."
 ustates.50.a: "Somebody Stop Long!"

 ustates.51.t: "MacArthur Marches on Washington"
 ustates.51.d: "Reed's support in Washington, D.C. has finally bottomed out. Chief of Staff General Douglas MacArthur marched on the White House today with National Guard and Army units to \"restore order\", having declared President Reed to be \"incapable of properly carrying out the functions of a constitutional president\" and attempted to arrest him at the White House. MacArthur's marchers reminded many in D.C. of Cox's Army of 1932, except that these soldiers are motivated to preserve the status quo instead of smashing it, and were cheered instead of booed. Having been tipped off by SPA informants in MacArthur's command staff, however, President Reed was able to stay ahead of General MacArthur's men and has escaped the capital by motorcade. MacArthur has chosen to inhabit the White House and coordinate an investigation into Reed's actions from the Oval Office. Some are even suggesting that, should Vice President Norman Thomas prove equally \"incapable\", General MacArthur might be sworn in as provisional president."
 ustates.51.a: "My allegiance was to the Republic, MacArthur, to democracy!"

### President Long ###

 ustates.52.t: "Long's Inaugural Address"
 ustates.52.d: "The country's social problems have forced the American people to turn to radical solutions; the two-party system has broken down, and Huey P. Long is to be sworn in as the 31st president of the United States with William Lemke being sworn in as the Vice President. In a stirring speech in Washington DC, Long has pledged to defend the interest of the people and to put the interest of the regular American above anyone else. However, the AFP's slim majority in Congress means that it may find it challenging to pass meaningful legislation, especially in the senate where the SPA senators have promised to filibuster any law they see as detrimental to America."
 ustates.52.a: "God Bless America."

 ustates.53.t: "Executive Order 7037: Farm Aid Bill"
 ustates.53.d: "One of Long's first acts was to provide relief for the farmers of America, thus this executive order directed the Secretary of Commerce. The order enforces price controls on farm products, provides credit to the farmers and provide tariffs on grains and other cereals. This will reverse the price slump that is driving farmers into poverty. Unwilling to wait to overcome the Senate filibuster, and citing the violent conflict that is going on in America, Long passed the executive order bypassing Congress entirely. While farmers across the country rejoice, many in the country denounce the Executive Order as a tyrannical act of the Executive Branch."
 ustates.53.a: "Approved"

 ustates.54.t: "Opposition Denounces Long as Tyrant"
 ustates.54.d: "Though they agreed on little else, the Democrats, Republicans, and Socialists have been quick to denounce Long publicly across the Nation for the enactment of Executive Order 7037, claiming it to be an overreach of the Executive Branch, and the start of the slide into tyranny. Opponents have gone so far as to disobey any law that \"King Long\" wishes to impose upon America. Jack Reed has even stepped up to the podium to call Huey Long \"the American Codreanu\" and waves around folders of recorded hate crimes committed by President Long's followers."
 ustates.54.a: "Those men don't represent me!"

 ustates.55.t: "Wealth and Fear Go Hand in Hand"
 ustates.55.d: "From New York to San Francisco the rich and powerful protested Long's election in the Hearst newspapers and in Congressional addresses. It is clear that the wealthy - whether politically minded or not - are furious at the reforms Huey Long is passing, as well as his opposition to free market policies passed under Hoover. This has trickled down to the middle class readers, who have begun to speak of President Long as a would-be dictator as well."
 ustates.55.a: "The people's voice is louder than the elites'"

 ustates.56.t: "Executive Order 7048: Share Our Wealth"
 ustates.56.d: "'By virtue of the authority vested in me, I, Huey Pierce Long, President of the United States of America, do declare the intrinsic right of the poor to have relief. A new government agency will be created to mete out the basic needs of every American, so that our nation's great wealth is felt not only in the upper echelons of power but also in the lowest hovel.'\n\nAlso included with the executive order is a wide array of tax increases on the wealthiest Americans. While incredibly popular with the AFP's base, and hardly unexpected considering Long's \"Share the Wealth\" slogan, many Americans are protesting what appears to be a massive overstep of the executive power of the president. The constitutionality of increasing taxes by fiat, and how this new agency would even manage to operate, are questions that has thrown the government into immediate chaos and confusion. Long has already begun campaigning hard, using press releases to rail against the \"corporate order\" which would see America fall to syndicalist rhetoric."
 ustates.56.a: "Sharing our wealth is our only defence!"

 ustates.57.t: "Executive Order 7048 Declared Unconstitutional"
 ustates.57.d: "In a highly publicised court case, Chief Justice Charles Evan Hughes has declared that executive order 7048 is unconstitutional. This was a narrow court case and was split 5-4 against the president. When news reached the White House, Long fumed at the news that the court would block the necessary reforms needed to ensure the safety of America."
 ustates.57.a: "Charles Hughes has made his decision, now let him enforce it!"

 ustates.58.t: "Packing the Court"
 ustates.58.d: "The decision by the Supreme Court to declare his executive order unconstitutional has made Long take an extra-legal solution. Citing Lincoln's court-packing during the Civil War as precedent, Long has asked the Senate Majority Leader to remove the filibuster for Judicial appointees, and has increased the size of the Supreme Court to 15. It is clear that Long intends to appoint 6 pro-AFP justices to the branch that shall ensure that his executive orders will be constitutional. This has provoked a firestorm of protest throughout the country, even from the members of Congress that have so far remained neutral or supportive of Long."
 ustates.58.a: "I shall defend the interests of the nation"

 ustates.59.t: "Executive Order 7050: Declare SPA Terrorists"
 ustates.59.d: "Citing national concerns due to the anarchistic nature of the Socialist Party of America, Huey Long has passed an executive order that has declared them an illegal organisation which seeks to overthrow the country, and as such all force shall be used to oppose them. Long has drawn a direct comparison between the SPA militias and the terrorist attacks that occurred on Preparedness Day in 1916, and Wall Street in 1920. The militias are now subject to the Sedition Act of 1918, prosecuted as an anti-recruitment and vigilante group."
 ustates.59.a: "Excellent!"

 ustates.60.t: "Reed Defies the Order"
 ustates.60.d: "Jack Reed has publicly denounced Executive Order 7050 unconstitutional and an act that would provoke the country's workers against Long. Reed has organised large rallies and protests against them with the Red Guard there to keep the workers safe from the Minutemen. These highly reported on protests have seen union scabs beaten without interference from the police, which calls into question Long's ability to protect Americans."
 ustates.60.a: "Rely on the police to keep control"

 ustates.61.t: "Union Workers and Police Clash"
 ustates.61.d: "In an unexpected move, the police have refused to enforce the various executive orders. Within Chicago, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, and other cities scattered throughout the Steel Belt, they have declared a Police Strike in solidarity with the workers. While they worked to keep order, Police union leaders publicly declared that they would not follow the Laws of \"King Long\". President Long has now called in his Minutemen to work with the National Guard to enforce his laws."
 ustates.61.a: "Send in the big boys"

 ustates.62.t: "The Minutemen Clash with the SPA"
 ustates.62.d: "When the Minutemen arrived in the Steel Belt to enforce the laws of the President, they were immediately set upon by members of the SPA and its supporters. Shoot-outs quickly became commonplace, and the violence quickly spread throughout almost every major city in the Steel Belt. It has been quickly noticed that the government has no remaining authority within the Steel Belt."
 ustates.62.a: "Send in the biggest guys we've got!"

 ustates.63.t: "MacArthur and the Army Remove Long"
 ustates.63.d: "Long's support in Washington, D.C. has finally bottomed out. Douglas MacArthur marched on the White House today with National Guard and Army units to \"restore order\", having declared Long to be \"incapable of properly carrying out the functions of a constitutional president\" and attempted to arrest him at the White House. MacArthur's marchers reminded many in D.C. of Cox's Army of 1932, except that these soldiers are motivated to preserve the status quo instead of smashing it, and were cheered instead of booed.

 ustates.63.a: "My allegiance was to the Republic, MacArthur, to democracy!"

### President Olson ###

 ustates.64.t: "Floyd B. Olson's Inauguration"
 ustates.64.d: "After his election, Olson addressed the nation. Olson called for patience and civility in these difficult times. Olson was quoted as saying \"A nation cannot be preserved which does not preserve its citizens. Industry is reducing wages, lowering the standard of living, destroying buying power, this cannot be the way we solve our economic problems.\" Reinvigorated with the news that his stomach cancer is in remission, Olson boldly strides into the White House amidst protests from both the socialists and hard liners with the promise of fixing the economy, restoring national brotherhood, and preventing political violence by any means necessary. Whether the rest of the nation would listen to the message was another story."
 ustates.64.a: "America is One Nation Indivisible!"

 ustates.65.t: "Olson Announces Negotiations"
 ustates.65.d: "President Olson has announced that his first priority as president is to end the strike launched by the SPA, and that he has sent an invitation to sit down with Jack Reed in Chicago to negotiate. Reed holds a firm grip over both the IWW and AFL, who make up the bulk of the general strikers. Some reporters believe that Olson's cabinet members are opposed to the talks, seeing any negotiation as political suicide - the coalition was formed, after all, in order to bypass having to directly deal with the SPA - but President Olson is, apparently, quite determined."
 ustates.65.a: "This is the only way"

 ustates.66.t: "Reed Accepts Invitation"
 ustates.66.d: "Jack Reed has sent word to the government that he has accepted the invitation to negotiate. FBI intelligence on Reed indicates that, should Reed fail in negotiation, the leaders of the AFL are likely to leave the general strike and defect from the SPA. While preparations are being made in Chicago to heighten security, members of Olson's cabinet as well as General Douglas MacArthur have expressed their serious misgivings at the entire endeavour. They say President Olson is putting his life in jeopardy, but for now they will wait to see what comes of the meeting."
 ustates.66.a: "I survived cancer, I can handle this"

 ustates.67.t: "Negotiations Begin"
 ustates.67.d: "Olson gave a stirring speech stating his plan before the negotiations. \"Today we are endeavouring to save the system we call Capitalism, by attempting to curb selfish individualism, and the avaricious profit motive. That there will be anything left of the so-called capitalistic system, is very doubtful. That there will be great change is certain.\" President Olson and Jack Reed have now sat down for their historic meeting in Chicago, though before the meeting can even begin word has arrived that Huey Long has demanded the America First Party be involved in the negotiations. The presence of Long in the meeting will undoubtedly make negotiations more difficult, possibly scuttling them entirely, but refusing Long could incite his supporters in the south and make success in Chicago worthless."
 ustates.67.a: "Allow Long to participate"
 ustates.67.b: "Long has no business here"

 ustates.68.t: "Reed Demands SPA-Controlled Social Security"
 ustates.68.d: "After several days of negotiations, President Olson and Jack Reed have come to terms. In order for Reed to call off the strike, he wants to see Congress immediately pass bills mandating a liveable minimum wage, a maximum 40-hour work week, and a federally-funded welfare system directly under the SPA's administration. He fell short of demanding trade unions be required to have a percentage of seats reserved in Congress, but only reluctantly. Even so, Olson believes the bill will be a hard sell in Capitol Hill. It is, however, likely the only way to avoid further conflict."
 ustates.68.a: "We'll see how Congress feels about this"
 ustates.68.b: "Reed needs to make a better offer"

 ustates.69.t: "AFP and SPA Congressmen Leave Congress"
 ustates.69.d: "As President Olson took Reed's proposal before Congress, Huey Long and the AFP declared him a traitor to the American people for selling out welfare relief to the SPA. AFP Senators walked out, refusing to listen to Olson's impassioned plea that they compromise for the sake of peace. Those who remained listened uneasily, and as debate began it quickly became clear that the coalition would not hold in the face of socialist reforms. Even SPA Senators have now abandoned Capitol Hill, depriving both houses of a quorum, with Jack Reed declaring Olson's offer worthless and his government too corrupt and dysfunctional to ever serve the American people."
 ustates.69.a: "We tried, Dear America"

 ustates.70.t: "Long and Reed Argue"
 ustates.70.d: "As the meeting in Chicago began in earnest, it quickly became clear that Huey Long and Jack Reed were not going to find middle ground. Both men had contradictory views on almost all subjects, and this led to heated arguments. It is apparent from the proceedings that Reed and Long's control over their parties were waning, as both made frequent breaks to confer with their team. President Olson did his best to keep things civil, but Long and Reed could agree on nothing. Long pushed back at the every measure Reed brought up, save for social security. Jack Reed has threatened to leave the negotiations if Long is not removed."
 ustates.70.a: "Remove Long from the meeting"
 ustates.70.b: "Try to work with both the men"

 ustates.71.t: "Long Ejected from Negotiations"
 ustates.71.d: "President Olson called for Huey Long to be physically removed - which was necessary, since the man refused to leave peacefully. Moments later, Long forced his way back into the meeting hall and accused Olson of selling out welfare relief to the syndicates. In a fever pitch, Long began reciting anti-capitalist quotes Olson had made during his tenure as Governor of Minnesota. The president had little choice but to have security forces drag Long from the building, kicking and screaming, shouting that America would not stand for this treachery."
 ustates.71.a: "Nobody can negotiate in that state"

 ustates.72.t: "Minutemen Attack the SPA in Chicago"
 ustates.72.d: "After Huey Long was forcibly removed from the negotiations, Minutemen attacked members of the SPA party in the street just outside the building. An impromptu battle erupted as armed Minutemen clashed with Red Guard and Federal forces. Fearing for his safety, and more than a little suspicious this was all simply a ruse to see him assassinated and blame placed on the AFP, Jack Reed fled the building... followed shortly by President Olson, who was taken to Washington out of security concerns. The negotiations have ended in disastrous failure."
 ustates.72.a: "Long has ruined peace!"

 ustates.73.t: "The Compromise: Establish the NLB"
 ustates.73.d: "After even more long days of talks between President Olson and Jack Reed, during which several times the entire SPA delegation almost up and left the negotiations, a further compromise has been reached - one the SPA say they will not budge further upon. They have given way on SPA administration over the welfare system, but in return want federal funding for a new organisation... including a national board acting as liaison between unions and the government, one which the SPA *would* be in control of. This new liaison would be named the National Labor Board, or NLB for short. Negotiators feel this package could pass Congress, but not without inciting AFP rage and potentially undoing all efforts to contain them in the South. The only possible way around that, according to advisors, is to bring Long and the AFP into negotiations now and get them on board prior to going public."
 ustates.73.a: "Present this before Congress now"
 ustates.73.b: "Bring in Long - we need the AFP's support"

 ustates.74.t: "NLB Bill Narrowly Approved"
 ustates.74.d: "In an emergency session of Congress, President Olson - with Senator Jack Reed beside him - presented the compromise bill for the NLB before the gathered Senators. He made an impassioned plea, saying that he did not seek a full ratification. That could come in the months ahead. What he needed was a vote indicating that the larger goals in the bill were acceptable to Congress, as a message to the strikers that the federal government intended to act in good faith. While every AFP Senator left the building in outrage, refusing to take part in what they declared a \"surrender to syndicalism\", Olson's plea that the coalition hold and consider the need for peace had its intended effect: at five minutes to midnight, the Senate narrowly passed a motion of approval. Jack Reed, greatly relieved, said the SPA would now relay the good news to strikers... then the real talks could begin."
 ustates.74.a: "A sane, democratic change"

 ustates.75.t: "AFP Rejects the Compromise"
 ustates.75.d: "As expected, Huey Long has gone on a rampage the moment news of the compromise went public. He has declared Olson to be in league with Reed, the government to have failed in its mission to guard the United States against syndicalist interests, and that America's very soul was in jeopardy. While government officials attempted to urge calm, Long's words have struck a chord across the South, firing up AFP support and - as advisors had warned the President - undoing previous efforts to contain them."
 ustates.75.a: "If Long wants a fight, he's got one"

 ustates.76.t: "Negotiations Reach Impasse"
 ustates.76.d: "Huey Long and the AFP gladly accepted the President's invitation to come to the negotiating table, though they were less than pleased once presented with the proposed reforms. After several days of debate, the effort largely seems to have been for naught. Jack Reed and Huey Long argue incessantly on key points of the compromise, and Long's default position is one of hostility towards what he felt as a united front against him. Still, there are points in common between the AFP's and SPA's position, and as the days wear on President Olson is becoming hopeful there may be signs of Long's resistance slowly wearing down. For the sake of peace, could he be persuaded to accept the terms?"
 ustates.76.a: "We only need a few more days..."

 ustates.77.t: "MacArthur and the Army Remove Olson"
 ustates.77.d: "It appears Olson's time has run out. With the perception outside the Chicago meeting being that it is dragging on for too long, while the AFP and SPA continue to gain power, Olson's own cabinet has lost its confidence that any resolution would be reached. With the cabinet's cooperation, Chief of Staff General Douglas MacArthur took charge of an emergency administration intended to \"preserve the country from extremist forces, before it's too late\". Jack Reed and Huey Long have fled the Chicago meeting, both believing they have been utterly betrayed by a federal government that would act while their guard was down. Meanwhile, President Olson has been placed under house arrest in Washington. Attempts to similarly arrest Vice President Willkie, still engaged in talks in Seattle, have been rebuffed by the Governor of Washington. While the government is attempting to reassure the American public that all is under control, most are looking on in shock. Civil war appears imminent."
 ustates.77.a: "So it has come to this"

 ustates.78.t: "President Announces Hard Line"
 ustates.78.d: "President [USA.GetLeader] today announced that a hard line would be taken against the SPA strikers, and indeed against any extremist force that seeks to further destabilise America. Executive Orders have been issues to curb the ability of the America First Party and the Socialist Party of America to operate, this despite protests from congressmen in both parties. All SPA and AFP Senators have now walked out of Capitol Hill, to the jeers of their Republican and Democratic colleagues, thus adding to the sense that the country was nearing a political breaking point."
 ustates.78.a: "We will restore order, no matter what"

 ustates.79.t: "Reed Condemns Police Violence"
 ustates.79.d: "As the SPA strike continues, spreading outside of the Steel Belt, clashes between strikers and the police have becomes more common. Jack Reed has urged the AFL and IWW strikers to resist without violence, but this hasn't always worked - especially when the strikers are simultaneously provoked by America First supporters. Reed has publicly condemned the government for adding to the violence, rather than protecting those who need it most. \"What these workers need are jobs that don't exploit them, that don't sacrifice their flesh and blood upon the altar of American Greed\" Reed declared in a Minneapolis speech. \"What they get instead is a government that acts at the behest of their capitalist overlords\"."
 ustates.79.a: "We're trying to keep order!"

 ustates.80.t: "Long Declares War On Tyranny"
 ustates.80.d: "The SPA strikers aren't the only ones feeling the heat at the hands of American police. So, too, have the Minutemen come under increased scrutiny. Several Minutemen training centres in Alabama and South Carolina were raided by police in recent days, and AFP meetings have been constantly harassed - or so Huey Long has loudly complained. \"The federal government has opted for open tyranny\" he said. \"They will do anything to keep us down, when what we seek is a government that is worthy of us!\" His recent speech in Charlotte was received by cheering crowds, indicative of the AFP's growing influence."
 ustates.80.a: "We'll see about that!"

 ustates.81.t: "The General Strike Spreads"
 ustates.81.d: "The SPA's general strike has spread far and wide, all but bringing the nation to a standstill in many industrial states. The city of St. Louis in particular has become a warzone, day to day life all but ended as strikers clash variously either with Federal forces or with AFP Minutemen. The sense of chaos has led to several riots as protests by regular citizens have turned into looting and civil unrest. People are leaving St. Louis by the thousands, and are calling for immediate government intervention."
 ustates.81.a: "It is coming!"

 ustates.82.t: "Tension in the Steel Belt"
 ustates.82.d: "As National Guardsmen arrive in the north to end the SPA strike, tensions remain high. Many of the various mayors and even governors were not just supportive of the strike but actively helping it. Consequently, they strongly oppose the unconstitutional use of the National Guard. The strikers have begun to taunt the guards, and have even assaulted scab workers brought into the factories under National Guard escort. It is clear a single spark can set off the entire American north. President [USA.GetLeader] remains undeterred by this, and declared on the radio that the general strike must end for the good of the nation, with the unsaid implication that force will be used if it doesn't."
 ustates.82.a: "Force is necessary now"

 ustates.83.t: "Clashes in the South"
 ustates.83.d: "National Guard units today fought with Minutemen militia in northern Louisiana, a raid that soon turned into a bloodbath as Minutemen opened fire. In the end, over forty Guardsmen were killed as well as an unknown number of Minutemen. Huey Long and the AFP denied involvement with the militia, but questioned the presence of the National Guard in what should clearly have been a police matter. The militia, they claim, were merely defending themselves. Photos of the ensuing bloody scene have circulated in southern newspapers, resulting in a new wave of outrage from the public directed at the federal government."
 ustates.83.a: "But not at the Minutemen? Not even a little?"

 ustates.84.t: "The Pittsburgh Massacre"
 ustates.84.d: "All it took was a single spark to start the revolution, and in Pittsburgh that spark occurred when a crowd of people stood outside one factory determined themselves to oppose the National Guard. Guardsmen fired into the crowd leaving five dead. It did not take long for this to quickly be dubbed the \"Pittsburgh Massacre\" and the Steel Belt was driven into a frenzy. Soon National Guardsmen and police were fighting with SPA militia throughout the Steel Belt. Newspapers across the country have \"CIVIL WAR\" splashed across their headlines, and public panic is at a crescendo."
 ustates.84.a: "What next?"

 ustates.85.t: "J. Edgar Hoover's Proposal"
 ustates.85.d: "J. Edgar Hoover, Director of the FBI, arrived at the White House early today to grimly inform President [USA.GetLeader] that civil war is imminent. The best chance for the federal government, he says, is to take decisive action now before the AFP and SPA can become more organised. An assassination of Huey Long would mean the collapse of the AFP, as it centred around his personality. An assassination of Jack Reed, meanwhile, would throw the SPA into disarray while the IWW and AFL competed for leadership... at least long enough for the immediate danger to pass. There would be consequences, Hoover advises, not least of all the rightful suspicion that would fall on a democratic government for taking such an extreme act... but these are desperate times. If the FBI is to act, Hoover says, they must act now, for there is only time for one operation."
 ustates.85.a: "Take out Jack Reed and the SPA"
 ustates.85.b: "Take out Huey Long and the AFP"
 ustates.85.c: "We will not stoop to such undemocratic measures"

 ustates.86.t.reed: "Attempt on Reed's Life"
 ustates.86.t.long: "Attempt on Long's Life"
 ustates.86.d.reed: "The deed is sanctioned. The Commander in Chief signed off on the unprecedented murder of a private citizen, the socialist politician John Reed, as fears of a civil war grew. An FBI agent has taken position outside the Indiana legislature and all that remains is to see if he can find a clear shot."
 ustates.86.d.long: "The deed is sanctioned. The Commander in Chief signed off on the unprecedented murder of a private citizen, the populist politician Huey Long, as fears of a civil war grew. An FBI agent has taken position outside the Louisiana legislature and all that remains is to see if he can find a clear shot."
 ustates.86.a: "The assassin takes aim!"
 ustates.86.b: "The assassin is caught and obstructed in a panic!"

 ustates.87.t: "Huey Long Assassinated!"
 ustates.87.d: "Just outside the Louisiana state legislature in Louisiana, Huey Long - leader of the America First Party and prominent critic of the United States federal government - was shot to death by an assailant who, in turn, was killed by Long's bodyguards. The motives of the assassination are unknown, but while many are ascribing it to the Socialist Party of America, the SPA's leader Jack Reed has hotly denied any involvement and instead is pointing the finger at President [USA.GetLeader]... a version of events which is gaining widespread acceptance in the country, increasing the anger towards the troubled government. The former Democrats within the AFP have silently deserted the more radical elements of the party, and the FBI reports that neither William Lemke nor Charles Coughlin have been able to meet with the AFP Congressmen."
 ustates.87.a: "That's it for the AFP, at least"
 ustates.87.b: "Interesting"

 ustates.88.t: "Jack Reed Assassinated!"
 ustates.88.d: "While returning from a meeting at the Indiana state legislature, Jack Reed - leader of the Socialist Party of America and head of the ICC - was shot to death by an unknown assailant. A manhunt is currently under way for the sniper, even as workers across America mourn his loss. While many are ascribing the deed to the America First Party, the AFP's leader, Huey Long, has hotly denied any involvement and instead is pointing the finger at President [USA.GetLeader]... a version of events which is gaining widespread acceptance in the country, increasing the anger towards an already-troubled government. The labour leaders from the AFL have declared Reed's strike to be wildcat, and therefore have ordered their unions to return to work. The IWW has responded by declaring the AFL scabs, and it appears their brief cooperation has ended."
 ustates.88.a: "That's it for the SPA, at least"
 ustates.88.b: "Interesting"

 ustates.89.t: "Reed Accuses the Government of Murder"
 ustates.89.d: "With the country still reeling from Huey Long's death, and the AFP collapsing, Jack Reed has been quick to capitalise on the growing public anger. At a recent rally in Detroit, Reed all but accused the government of murder. \"I won't say that I agreed with Governor Long\", he said, \"but he wanted the life of the average American to be better. He wanted a government that was better, that stood for us all. What we have now is a government that stands only for capitalist greed, a cancer growing within the heart of American democracy which will kill anything that tries to cut it out\". Demonstrations across the country have echoed Reed's words, particularly in the South where Long's supporters have begun a campaign of violence against government targets, and it seems things will quickly get worse."
 ustates.89.a: "We must brace for impact"

 ustates.90.t: "Long Accuses the Feds of Murder"
 ustates.90.d: "With the country still reeling from Jack Reed's death, and the SPA caught up in in-fighting to determine his rightful successor, Huey Long has been quick to capitalise on the growing public anger. At a recent rally in Alabama, Long all but accused the government of murder. \"We have been spared a devil who would have led us down the road to tyranny\", he said, \"but we must face another kind of tyranny in our own government. American democracy is dead, and it is President [USA.GetLeader] who has killed it. We must rise up and meet steel with steel, guns with guns!\" Demonstrations across the country have echoed Long's words, particularly in the Steel Belt where SPA supporters have lashed out against government targets en masse, and it seems things will quickly get worse."
 ustates.90.a: "We must brace for impact"

### Garner Path ###

 ustates.91.t: "John N. Garner's Inauguration"
 ustates.91.d: "Today John Nance Garner has been sworn in as the 31st president of America. Garner's speech spoke about how we must not compromise our democratic values with radicals, left or right. Garner was quoted as saying \"We are in a tough-minded recognition that the fight for a better America is a long one.\" On the economy, Garner has promised reform through personal sacrifice and austerity, as was done after the Panic of 1893. Garner enters the White House surrounded by hostile AFP and SPA Senators as well as wary Republicans, though he has assured the public that the Longists and Unionists will tire themselves out before the end of the year."
 ustates.91.a: "God Save America"

 ustates.92.t: "The Austerity Bill"
 ustates.92.d: "President Garner has introduced an Emergency Austerity Measures bill into Congress today, an almost certainly controversial piece of legislation which would see government spending cuts across the board - especially towards the social security net. Garner's speech to the Senate spoke of the sacrifice needed if America is to recover from the Great Depression, and it was met with mostly scepticism and jeers from non-Democratic Senators. Even Garner's own cabinet expressed reservations regarding his choice, suggesting passage of the bill might prove difficult... though, if it can be managed, it would almost certainly save the country."
 ustates.92.a: "Believe in America"

 ustates.93.t: "Long Denounces Austerity Measures"
 ustates.93.d: "As discussions began in Capitol Hill regarding the austerity bill, the AFP immediately denounced it. Huey Long said in a North Carolina speech that austerity did the exact opposite of what was necessary. Rather than sharing the wealth, it took every last bit of wealth from those who needed it most. Austerity, he claims, would leave the average American more desperately poor than they are now, and would leave them vulnerable to syndicalist rhetoric. Long said he would be directing AFP to oppose the bill at every turn, for the sake of the country."
 ustates.93.a: "We shall see"

 ustates.94.t: "D.C. Demonstration Turns Violent"
 ustates.94.d: "A demonstration in Washington, D.C. by workers and strikers voicing their disapproval of the austerity measures bill, today turned violent as police attempted to break up the crowd. SPA members present said theirs was a peaceful protest, that police provoked the crowd into a response. Regardless of the cause, the end result was a pitched battle with police that left the city in chaos for two days and left hundreds of protestors injured. SPA leader Jack Reed condemned the police action as brutality and imperialist suppression."
 ustates.94.a: "We are trying to keep order, Reed!"

 ustates.95.t: "General Strike Spreads"
 ustates.95.d: "The SPA's general strike has spread far and wide, all but bringing the nation to a standstill in many industrial states. The city of St. Louis in particular has become a warzone, day to day life all but ended as strikers clash variously either with Federal forces or with AFP Minutemen. The sense of chaos has led to several riots as protests by regular citizens have turned into looting and civil unrest. People are leaving St. Louis by the thousands, calling for immediate government intervention."
 ustates.95.a: "Damned Fools!"

 ustates.96.t: "Austerity Bill Voting Commences"
 ustates.96.d: "Voting on the Emergency Austerity Measures bill began in Congress today, though early indications were not good. While the bill is solidly backed by Democratic Senators, it is rabidly opposed by both the SPA and AFP... and there are enough Republican Senators remaining on the fence, unwilling to be swayed, that passage may prove unlikely without intervention. The president's cabinet is suggesting calling for a meeting of the major party representatives in Philadelphia, to try and work out a compromise - at least enough of one to make passage easier. It is also possible that President Garner could campaign for the votes of influential Republicans. A coalition may not have been in the cards, but perhaps he could appeal to their sense of civic duty on this one instance alone?"
 ustates.96.a: "Arrange the Philadelphia meeting"
 ustates.96.b: "Let's campaign for the Republican vote"

 ustates.97.t: "Philadelphia Meeting Begins"
 ustates.97.d: "The historic meeting in Philadelphia began today, with all four major political parties present and President Garner appealing to them that a compromise on the austerity bill was necessary for the sake of national peace and prosperity. As the parties talked, however, it quickly became clear that Huey Long and Jack Reed would both absorb most of the attention. Despite the small number of congressmen they each have in Congress, everyone in the room knows very well the influence they hold in the country, and both men disagreed on almost every aspect of compromise. Reed wanted workers protected from cuts to government contracts, while Long wanted to add an Open Shop clause to austerity. While there is evidence that President Garner and Governor Long see eye-to-eye on many issues, it is quickly becoming clear that compromise will be utterly impossible with both Reed and Long present."
 ustates.97.a: "Eject Long and the AFP"
 ustates.97.b: "Eject Reed and the SPA"
 ustates.97.c: "We will all go together"

 ustates.98.t: "Long and the AFP Kicked Out"
 ustates.98.d: "President Garner called for Huey Long to be physically removed - which was necessary, since the man refused to leave peacefully. Moments later, he forced his way back into the meeting hall and accused Garner of throwing out fiscal responsibility for the syndicates' sake. The president had little choice but to have security forces drag Long from the building, kicking and screaming, shouting that America would not stand for this treachery. It was only after he left that the subdued remaining Senators could continue the negotiations."
 ustates.98.a: "That's a bully right there!"

 ustates.99.t: "Garner and Long Make Progress"
 ustates.99.d: "President Garner called for Jack Reed and the SPA to be ejected from the meeting, though before Reed left he made a solemn speech to those present. He accused them of bowing to tyranny, that a government which didn't understand the worker would meet its ultimate fate at the hand of that worker. After his departure, however, things went much more smoothly. Long indicated he was willing to make compromises, so long as amendments to the austerity bill supporting Long's Share Our Wealth Society indirectly through tax breaks. With this, as well as putting Huey Long himself as the head of a new Unamerican Activities Committee, he could go to his supporters and say that progress was finally being made. There are those present at the meeting, however, who caution that this will undoubtedly infuriate the SPA and make irrelevant any measures the government has undertaken to curb their control in the North."
 ustates.99.a: "We can finally agree"
 ustates.99.b: "We will not be blackmailed into such measures!"

 ustates.100.t: "The Pittsburgh Massacre"
 ustates.100.d: "Just as the remaining members of the meeting began to make headway, and it was looking as if a compromise on the austerity bill would be reached, word arrived in Philadelphia of a battle taking place in nearby Pittsburgh. SPA strikers had been attacked by Minutemen militia members, a fight which turned bloody when federal forces arrived on the scene and attempted to intervene. Several bombs were detonated, adding to the chaos, and the Senators received reports of unidentified militia forces advancing on Philadelphia. President Garner was evacuated from the building by his security forces, over his objections, and both the meeting and the vote have crumbled to a premature end."
 ustates.100.a: "It seems the hell fire is upon us"

 ustates.101.t: "Long and Reed Stall Meeting"
 ustates.101.d: "While President Garner's attempt to get Huey Long and Jack Reed to come to some kind of agreement was commendable, after several days of debate it appears to have mostly come to naught. Both men are frustrated, and several times each has threatened to walk out of the meeting entirely. It is apparent from the proceedings that Reed and Long's control over their parties were waning, as both made frequent breaks to confer with their team. Republicans are split on the matter, and there are not enough of them who will vote for the bill if they believe the country will erupt into violence anyhow. Both Long and Reed have given a deadline until tomorrow, at which point they say there is no chance of the Philadelphia meeting continuing. The gathered Senators are looking to the president to somehow solve the impasse."
 ustates.101.a: "What can I do?"

 ustates.102.t: "Austerity Bill Passes"
 ustates.102.d: "With the endorsement of the AFP, the Emergency Austerity Measures bill passed - though not before all SPA Senators up and walked out of the chamber in protest. News of the exemptions, as well as the added restrictions on industrial unions and Huey Long's presence at the head of a new committee which will likely see more crackdowns on socialist activity, has fired up SPA supporters across the Steel Belt with outrage. Jack Reed has declared the government a dead and useless body, so corrupt it could not even see Long for the snake he truly is, and says the American worker will never get a fair share unless he fights for it. Demonstrations have erupted across the northern part of the country - as suspected, making the government's efforts to combat SPA control useless - although, in the South, Long's assurances have gone a long way towards keeping his supporters quiet."
 ustates.102.a: "If Reed wants a fight, he's got one"

 ustates.103.t: "Austerity Bill Fails"
 ustates.103.d: "While President Garner campaigned long and hard into the night, at the end of the day there were simply too few Republican Senators willing to vote for a bill that they didn't have the support of the SPA and AFP, and which would likely result in violence anyhow. Garner's austerity plan is seen as a poor follow up to the Garner-Wagner bill he co-authored in 1934. The entire vote was even delayed by an actual fist-fight between a Republican and an AFP Senator. In the end, the vote failed by a slim margin... though the margin might as well have been a chasm, into which all of President Garner's hopes and aspirations could be tossed."
 ustates.103.a: "Congress isn't worth piss anyways"

 ustates.104.t: "MacArthur and the Army Remove Garner"
 ustates.104.d: "It appears President Garner's time is up. Douglas MacArthur marched into Washington D.C today, having declared Garner an \"ineffective president whose weakness has endangered America\". MacArthur's marchers reminded many in D.C. of Cox's Army of 1932, except these men are motivated to preserve the country from extremist forces. President Garner has been placed under house arrest at his home in Texas, while attempts to co-opt or arrest Vice President Smith, still engaged in talks in Seattle, have come to naught. While Garner's own cabinet has tried to assure Americans that things are under control, it's quickly becoming clear that civil war is imminent."
 ustates.104.a: "So it has come to this"

### Alf Landon Path ###

 ustates.105.t: "Alf Landon's Inaugural Address"
 ustates.105.d: "Alf Landon was sworn in as the 31st president of the United States of America today. At his inaugural address Landon spoke of the challenges facing the nation in preserving a liberal democracy. Landon was quoted as saying \"Republicans must become practical liberals, which means that the Republican party has got to recognise the problems of a growing and complex industrial civilisation. And I think I will awaken America to that\". Landon concluded with a promise to solve the Depression with entrepreneurship. Creating a new generation of millionaires that will bring pride back to the nation. Whether anyone will listen is another matter."
 ustates.105.a: "I treasure our American Democracy"

# Economic Intervention route
 ustates.106.t: "Landon Proposes Intervention"
 ustates.106.d: "In response to the ongoing crisis, President Landon has proposed a bill to begin a series of economic intervention policies. The bill will create an insurance for bank deposits in treasury-approved banks that will not engage in risky investing. The bill also allows the federal government to create a commission to monitor stock market exchanges against fraud. Landon believes this will restore confidence in the market, creating jobs from one end of the country to the other. Both the SPA and the AFP have declared opposition to the bill for not going far enough, and for being too friendly to the very businesses that caused the depression in the first place. It will take some cooperation between Republicans and Democrats to overcome this united front of radicalism in Congress."
 ustates.106.a: "This bill will not stop for them"

 ustates.107.t: "Reed Calls Landon Corrupt"
 ustates.107.d: "Alf Landon's election material made him out to be a self-made man, an entrepreneur who made his wealth starting from a small petroleum company. Landon's relationship with the oil industry culminated in the establishment of the United States Oil and Gas Association in his home state of Kansas, which freely associates with Standard Oil. To Reed and the SPA, this is the smoking gun that Landon is a class traitor, though to many these accusations have rang hollow, citing Landon as a man with the business connections to make the intervention bill stick."
 ustates.107.a: "I started with nothing, Reed, just like you!"

 ustates.108.t: "Huey Long Calls Landon a Monopolist"
 ustates.108.d: "Huey Long has responded, like Reed, by decrying Landon as a corrupt politician in Standard Oil's pocket. Huey Long recently spoke about how President Landon only cared for the rich and the monopolies that oppress true Americans, articulating criticism of Landon's fiscal conservatism during his tenure as Governor of Kansas. Huey Long also made sure to remind the people that, by all rights, he should be president and that he would have fixed this crisis already. President Landon, meanwhile, responded in a recent interview with newspapers that Long has a serious case of \"sour grapes\", and political cartoons have begun depicting Long as a childish baboon - much to the public's amusement and Long's outrage."
 ustates.108.a: "I am not Rockefeller, you fool!"

 ustates.109.t: "Democrats Close Ranks"
 ustates.109.d: "While many Democratic Senators are leery of supporting a bill which has such vociferous opposition by the SPA and the AFP, especially considering their influence in America goes far beyond the number of seats they hold in Congress, they have responded poorly to the personal attacks on the president by Long and Reed. Despite internal opposition for interfering with the market, Democrats have indicated they will support the president's bill."
 ustates.109.a: "That's the solidarity I like"

 ustates.110.t: "The \"New Deal\" Bill Passes"
 ustates.110.d: "The Economic Intervention Bill has managed to pass through Congress, and has been signed into law by President Landon. Banks are immediately shuttered as they reorganise before receiving Treasury approval. The commission has begun to draft reforms to stock trading that will hopefully restore confidence in the markets. It is hard to say right away if this will solve the problem, but Landon hopes that these can be the first steps to fix the economy, steps which all moderates can agree upon."
 ustates.110.a: "We are finally awake to change"

 ustates.111.t: "General Strike Spreads"
 ustates.111.d: "The SPA's general strike has spread far and wide, after a call by Jack Reed to demonstrate against the recently-passed intervention bill, all but bringing the nation to a standstill in many industrial states. The city of St. Louis in particular has become a warzone, day to day life all but ended as strikers clash variously either with Federal forces or with AFP Minutemen. The sense of chaos has led to several riots as protests by regular citizens have turned into looting and civil unrest. People are leaving St. Louis by the thousands, calling for immediate government intervention."
 ustates.111.a: "This is getting out of hand"

 ustates.112.t: "Proposed Conference with Long and Reed"
 ustates.112.d: "In response to the ongoing crisis, Alf Landon's Secretary of Commerce has proposed a conference with both Huey Long and Jack Reed to try to arrange some sort of compromise. The Secretary says that the measures in the bill will not work unless the strikes and the violence are brought to an end. However, some within the Republican party are saying that this plan of action will not work, and claiming a conference with Long and Reed will debase their party."
 ustates.112.a: "Ignore Long and Reed"
 ustates.112.b: "Arrange the conference"

 ustates.113.t: "The Great St. Louis Riot"
 ustates.113.d: "The SPA has been aggravating the workers in the area to expand the strike. Local businesses in St. Louis have become utterly paralysed. Many of them turned to the America First Party to provide a solution. Within days, the streets were flooded with Minutemen. There are wild reports from the chaos ranging from Minutemen stopping petty crime in the absence of police, to them creating the crime. Soon the situation had erupted into a wide scale riot. The chaos has been splashed across every newspaper in America, and within days SPA and AFP forces have begun to mobilise. War is upon us."
 ustates.113.a: "So it begins now, does it?"

 ustates.114.t: "Conference Begins"
 ustates.114.d: "The conference between President Landon and both Huey Long and Jack Reed began, but within days it was clear that it was a lost cause. Long and Reed argued constantly, on almost every issue, and the only thing that united them was their personal detestation of Landon and his intervention bill. It is apparent from the proceedings that Reed and Long's control over their parties were waning, not least of which is due to constant newspaper coverage of the conference citing the two men as \"obstructionist\" and \"unreasonable\". Reed and Long both see the president as the corrupt tool of corporate America, and rather than compromise their demands are tantamount to rolling back the intervention bill which has already been voted on and passed through Congress! Both are nearly ready to walk out, despite the president's pleading that they compromise for the sake of peace in the country."
 ustates.114.a: "I have to save this conference"

 ustates.115.t: "Scandal Rocks the Conference"
 ustates.115.d: "While President Landon's conference is finally beginning to make slow progress, American newspapers turn their attention from Reed and Long to a different target: namely the revelation of an internal memo within General Motors corporation which indicates that not only is the company's planned settlement with strikers intended to be only temporary... but that they and other companies are being bribed into settlement by the federal government. A temporary setback as they make concessions to strikers in exchange for a bailout with the understanding that changes made can be easily undone. While many are denying this memo's veracity, the sensational aspect of the news is giving new fire to AFP and SPA supporters and is threatening to quickly escalate out of control."
 ustates.115.a: "Cut the conference short, we need to call GM"
 ustates.115.b: "We must keep the conference going, no matter what"

 ustates.1150.t: "MacArthur and the Army Remove Landon"
 ustates.1150.d: "While the conference continued for several days, it rapidly became evident that the scandal was not going to end - instead it was escalating as other sources came forward with similar information, much of it pointing to an insider effort engineered by President Landon himself. Both Jack Reed and Huey Long abandoned the conference, and although Landon did his best to save face in Congress it was clear that blame was being placed squarely on him for the conference's failure. With the crisis spiralling out of control, Chief of Staff General Douglas MacArthur has stepped in - apparently with the full approval of Landon's own cabinet - to install an emergency government in the White House \"to save America from extremist forces before it's too late\". President Landon has been placed under house arrest at his home in Kansas, while attempts to co-opt or arrest Vice President McNary, still engaged in talks in Seattle, have come to naught. While the government has tried to assure Americans that things are under control, it's quickly becoming clear that civil war is imminent."
 ustates.1150.a: "So it has come to this"

### Victory in the civil war

 ustates.116.t: "MacArthur's Power"
 ustates.116.d: "With our victory in the civil war, the question of MacArthur's status must be decided upon. Although President MacArthur is legally the President according to the Presidential Succession Act, it was obvious to all in 1937 that MacArthur took power illegally. Many now wish for the general to step down and hand power back over to the elected vice president of the 31st administration. Hardliners within MacArthur's clique insist that the US will fall back into civil war without him, however, while Republicans and some Democrats claim MacArthur would be a tyrant if he stayed."
 ustates.116.a: "MacArthur remains in power."
 ustates.116.b: "MacArthur gives up power."

 ustates.117.t: "Democracy Triumphs"
 ustates.117.d: "At long last, the Republic has been saved. The radicals from both the left and the right which tried to destroy America have been defeated. We may have been battered and bruised but democracy has been saved."
 ustates.117.a: "God Bless America."

 ustates.118.t: "Malice or Charity?"
 ustates.118.d: "The question of what to do with those that fought against the government has to be decided. Shall we offer clemency to those that fought against the government and try and rehabilitate them back into society or shall they be punished for their actions against America?"
 ustates.118.a: "Charity."
 ustates.118.b: "Malice."

 ustates.119.t: "The Fate of the Electoral College"
 ustates.119.d: "As we work to strengthen democracy following the civil war, the question of the Electoral College has been brought up. Many are calling for the end to the first-past-the-post system, which would be replaced by a simpler national popular voting system. A majority of Congress believes that we should keep FPTP around as a safeguard against radicalism in the future. What should we do?"
 ustates.119.a: "Abolish the College."
 ustates.119.b: "The Electoral College stays."

 ustates.120.t: "National Rehabilitation"
 ustates.120.d: "While we root out those that continue to still fight on for their treasonous cause, the question has come before MacArthur about what to do to those that have laid down their arms. Some of his advisors are suggesting clemency, others suggest they must be imprisoned for their actions. What shall the commander in chief choose?"
 ustates.120.a: "Down with the Traitors."
 ustates.120.b: "We have spilt enough blood."

 ustates.121.t: "Reconcile with Washington?"
 ustates.121.d: "The tyrant MacArthur has done the unthinkable and has stepped down from power. Thus a debate has arisen about if we should reunite and make America whole. Many believe that even though MacArthur has stepped down from power, he still has control and that he won't hesitate to re-assume power should politics don't go his way."
 ustates.121.a: "Let us reunite with Washington (Game Over)"
 ustates.121.b: "We are the true America and we shall unite America ourselves!"

 ustates.122.t: "America Is Reunited!"
 ustates.122.d: "The rebel government out west has decided to lay down their arms and rejoin America. The military checkpoints along the Rocky Mountains are being dismantled and people from both sides of the country are crossing over. At long last the country is reunited."
 ustates.122.a: "From Sea to shining Sea!"

 ustates.123.t: "No Reconciliation"
 ustates.123.d: "Since MacArthur stepped down many wondered if the country would be whole again. However it seems that the rebels out west have decided that they shall not reunite with us. In their senate, they denounced Congress as just being a pawn of MacArthur who they still regard as a tyrant despite the fact he saved the country."
 ustates.123.a: "America one day shall be reunited."

 ustates.125.t: "The National Labor Relations Board"
 ustates.125.d: "With the civil war over and reconstruction now under way, the question of trade unions have been brought up. Some think that we should promote more liberal and anti-syndicalist unions to be a ward against the influence of Syndicalism in politics. A few loyalists within the AFL and the defunct Knights of Labor are willing to cooperate with Congress in creating a National Labor Relations Board. This board would be able to isolate IWW-affiliated unions, and give collective bargaining rights to unions that do not wish to see us hang. Others however, regard all trade unions as traitors to the country and should be outlawed together. Congress has decided to...?"
 ustates.125.a: "Accept the AFL and KoL into the NLRB."
 ustates.125.b: "Outlaw all Unions regardless of loyalty."

 ustates.126.t: "Army Is Slow to Desegregate"
 ustates.126.d: "After the President signed a law to desegregate the Armed Forces, it seems that it is taking more time then expected to fully desegregate. There are still black only and white only regiments and several officers are determined to keep things separate. Despite the slowness, things are improving as more and more units are desegregating. Still, Progress is slow."
 ustates.126.a: "Desegregation shall still happen."

 ustates.127.t: "The Red Scare"
 ustates.127.d.macarthur: "Since MacArthur has taken power he has begun a campaign against socialism, anarchism, and syndicalism. They are, after all, the main instigators of the civil war and as such all Americans must know the role that they played in the conflict. Now, as the so-called \"red scare\" begins, many are being forced out of jobs and are being blacklisted."
 ustates.127.d.elected: "Since the election of [USA.GetLeader], the government of the United States has begun a campaign against socialists of all stripes. They were one of the main instigators of the civil war and as such all Americans must understand their role. Moreover socialists and syndicalists must not allow their subversion to survive and as such as the so-called \"red scare\" begins many are being forced out of jobs and are being blacklisted."
 ustates.127.a: "Better Dead than Red."

 ustates.128.t: "Lavender Scare"
 ustates.128.d: "With the so-called Red Scare under way, [USA.GetLeader] has passed Executive Order 10450 that broadened the definition of a national security risk to include \"Any criminal, infamous, dishonest, immoral, or notoriously disgraceful conduct, habitual use of intoxicants to excess, drug addiction, or sexual perversion\". This has led to the firing of over 5,000 federal employees who were accused of being homosexual. The press have mostly approved of this measure, although a few tabloids claim we are preaching hypocrisy. One of the chief prosecutors, FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, has long been rumoured to be in the closet with his secretary Clyde Tolson. As Director of the most important intelligence agency, Hoover is of course beyond investigation. Even if we were to, J. Edgar probably has much more dirt on us than we have on him."
 ustates.128.a: "Let's not investigate J. Edgar Hoover."

 ustates.134.t: "The Great Migration"
 ustates.134.d: "As MacArthur has not given up power, a large number of Americans have made their way to [migrate.GetNameDef] - which is occupying American land and desecrating the flag and everything we hold dear. The question, however, is what shall we do in regard to this \"Great Migration\"? Should we let these traitors freely go and present a security risk, or shall we use the army to capture and detain as many as possible?"
 ustates.134.a: "They shall not leave."
 ustates.134.b: "Let them go."

 ustates.135.t: "Refugees from MacArthur"
 ustates.135.d.let_go: "As expected, the tyrant Douglas MacArthur has refused to give up his grip on power. As such a large wave of Americans are making their way across the [Root.GetAdjective] border where they will find a new life out of MacArthur's shadow. Moreover, military leaders believe that we shall be able to make use of this intel and use it against [USA.GetNameDef], if it comes to that."
 ustates.135.d.army: "As expected, the tyrant Douglas MacArthur has refused to give up his grip on power. A wave of migrants and refugees have come across the [Root.GetAdjective] border. While we and our special services have done what we could to bring them across, MacArthur used his army upon many, massacring them like the butcher that he is. However, this has only fuelled people's desire to see MacArthur punished."
 ustates.135.a: "Welcome to [Root.GetNameDef]"

 ustates.136.t: "The Provisional President"
 ustates.136.d: "With democracy now restored to the country, a question remains: who shall lead the country until the next election?\n\nMacArthur has picked a number candidates who could serve in that role and submitted their names to Congress - and now the choice rests with them. Although their image among anti-MacArthurites has suffered by his association with this handover, Congress and General MacArthur hope that the country will be able to unite behind a lawful president."
 ustates.136.a: "Welcome, President Smith."
 ustates.136.b: "Welcome back, President Landon."
 ustates.136.c: "Welcome, President Landon."
 ustates.136.e: "Welcome back, President Garner."
 ustates.136.f: "Welcome, President Garner."

### Civil War avoided Events ###

 ustates.150.t: "The Twentieth Amendment"
 ustates.150.d: "The Twentieth Amendment to the United States Constitution has been proposed. This amendment would make it so that the President of the United States of America is elected by the direct popular suffrage of the country. The current Electoral College system was last modified in the 14th Amendment almost a century ago. The bill, as proposed by a minority coalition of Social Democrats within the Republicans and Democrats has very little chance of succeeding. It is claimed by the supporters that doing this will help prevent another crisis like the 1936 crisis from happening again. The party leadership of both Republicans and Democrats disagree, saying that the Electoral College was the only thing that kept the United States from totally dissolving in 1936. A long week of debating has left every avenue explored, and ultimately... "
 ustates.150.a: "The Amendment is Ratified."
 ustates.150.b: "The Amendment is not Ratified."

 ustates.152.t: "NAACP and FBI Defames Socialists"
 ustates.152.d: "During the 1930s, a large part of the NAACP's activities were taken up by litigation in favour of African-American rights. This was due to the retreating strength of the black vote and the diminishing ability of African-Americans to reach office after Plessy v. Ferguson. This avenue was also pursued by the syndicalist aligned International Labor Defense, who countered the NAACP for a decade in a competition for the hearts of black voters. Seeing no other option and being unwilling to ever compromise with socialists, NAACP leader Walter Francis White has decided to cooperate with the FBI in an anti-socialist public relations campaign. Whether this truly motivates civil rights or further dilutes the current remains to be seen."
 ustates.152.a: "I'm no judge."

 ustates.153.t: "Statehood for Alaska?"
 ustates.153.d: "Alaska has proposed to congress being admitted to [Root.GetNameDef] as a state. Should Alaska be admitted as a state with all that entails or should it remain a territory for now?"
 ustates.153.a: "Alaska is a state."
 ustates.153.b: "Alaska remains a territory for now."

 ustates.154.t: "Statehood for Hawaii?"
 ustates.154.d: "Hawaii has proposed to congress being admitted to [Root.GetNameDef] as a state. Should Hawaii be admitted as a state with all that entails or should it remain a territory for now?"
 ustates.154.a: "Hawaii is a state."
 ustates.154.b: "Hawaii is a territory."

 ustates.155.t: "Statehood for Puerto Rico?"
 ustates.155.d: "With Alaska and Hawaii both being considered as potential new states of the Union, representatives from Puerto Rico have proposed that they should also become a state of [Root.GetNameDef]. Shall they become a state of the Union, becoming the 51st state or shall they remain a territory?"
 ustates.155.a: "Puerto Rico is a state."
 ustates.155.b: "Puerto Rico is a territory."

 ustates.156.t: "Division over Big Business Support"
 ustates.156.d: "It is known by most Democrats that economic reform is necessary to preserve American integrity, to this end Democrats differ on the agency the government must take towards existing industries that are ailing. A proposed civil works programme to electrify the Southwest using hydroelectric power hit a snag as Democrats could not agree on the role of public works in the marketplace. The Works would be able to undercut private electricity companies because it would be able to cross state borders and build dams on public land. Conservative Democrats oppose such intrusions as these, saying that it violates states' rights to govern trade. More liberal-minded Democrats hold fast that the necessity and potential of Public Works outweigh the risks."
 ustates.156.a: "Liberal Democrats win out."
 ustates.156.b: "Conservative Democrats win out."

 ustates.157.t: "President Honours Gunnar Myrdal"
 ustates.157.d: "The book An American Dilemma was recently published by Swedish economist Gunnar Myrdal. It is an examination of the connection between race and idealism and his thesis on the American Creed. Myrdal was funded by the Carnegie Institute and was chosen for his ambivalence towards American politics. Therefore this report carries with it support from many institutions, and Myrdal, as a result, is invited to the White House for dinner. With him is Ralph Bunche, diplomat and collaborator on this influential book."
 ustates.157.a: "May we keep to the American Creed."

 ustates.158.t: "Division over Fair Deal Doctrine"
 ustates.158.d: "The need for the Fair Deal to remedy America's many economic issues is agreed upon in the Republican Party, despite the old guard within the party insisting that Hoover handled it the best he could. An important provision in the Fair Deal is the intervention of federal policy to regulate the market and even prevent bank failure. Several high profile Republicans like Robert Taft oppose stretching executive power even if it could benefit the economy. To counter, Wendell Willkie has stated the role of the President to ensure the health of the American people extends to their economy."
 ustates.158.a: "Taft's opinion is overruled."
 ustates.158.b: "Quentin's opinion is overruled."

 ustates.159.t: "The Conservative Manifesto"
 ustates.159.d: "A subgroup of Democrats met a month ago to discuss the future of the party. Among these are Strom Thurmond and Happy Chandler, long serving congressmen that resist the drift of the Democratic Party towards the political centre. Their Conservative Manifesto is an argument against the long-term effects of the Fair Deal and a restoration of the rights of states. The question though is what shall the Party as a wholes reaction be to this so-called Conservative Manifesto"
 ustates.159.a: "The Party supports the manifesto."
 ustates.159.b: "The Party denounces the manifesto."

 ustates.160.t: "William McAdoo Has Died"
 ustates.160.d.civil_war_no_psa: "Former President, William Gibbs McAdoo has passed away in his home in California. MacAdoo has left behind a controversial legacy. Many Americans still blame him for the start of the depression and the political crisis that came from it that lead to the civil war. While on one hand he was and is praised for his work in regards to a number of progressive issues, notably Women's suffrage, he was never able to get prohibition passed, something he pushed for several times in Congress to no avail. He leaves behind a divided legacy. Still despite this, [USA.GetLeader] has remarked on McAdoo's passing and offered his condolences to his family and praised his work."

He leaves behind a divided legacy. Despite this, when the civil war began he openly gave his support to the traitors in California. [USA.GetLeader] has remarked on his death and openly criticised McAdoo's decision to support the traitors out west."

Many Americans still blame him for the start of the depression and the political crisis that came from it that lead to the civil war.

He leaves behind a divided legacy. Despite this, when the civil war began his support for the provisional government in the west coast helped give it an air of legitimacy. [PSA.GetLeader] has remarked on his passing and offered his condolences and praised McAdoo's Legacy."
 ustates.160.a: "He will be missed."

 ustates.161.t: "Boulder Dam Completed"
 ustates.161.d: "'This morning I came, I saw and I was conquered, as everyone would be who sees for the first time this great feat of mankind. Ten years ago the place where we are gathered was a sparse, forbidding desert. In the bottom of a gloomy canyon, whose precipitous walls rose to a height of more than a thousand feet, flowed a turbulent, dangerous river. The mountains on either side of the canyon were difficult of access with neither road nor trail, and their rocks were protected by neither trees nor grass from the blazing heat of the sun. The site of Boulder City was a cactus-covered waste. The transformation wrought here in these years is a twentieth-century marvel.' Thus begins [ROOT.GetLeader]'s speech dedicating the creation of Boulder Dam that has finally been completed today."
 ustates.161.a: "... on behalf of the Nation to say to you, \"Well done\"."

 ustates.162.t: "Fireside Chats"
 ustates.162.d: "Wendell Willkie has recently begun using the radio to speak directly to the people about the progress of the Fair Deal and how it is helping the country rebuild from the Great Depression. The Fireside chats have become extremely popular, with the chats often eclipsing popular radio programs. The Programs have helped in making Willkie one of the more popular men within the United States."
 ustates.162.a: "My Fellow Americans."

 ustates.163.t: "Amelia Earhart Circumnavigates Globe"
 ustates.163.d: "The famous aviator Amelia Earhart, known to many as the \"Queen of the Air\", has completed a flight around the world together with her navigator Fred Noonan.\n\nAfter a brief scare when the pair temporarily got lost while approaching Howland Island in the Pacific, the flight proceeded without incident and this morning their Lockheed Electra touched down in Oakland, California.\n\nA ceremony is to be held in the White House next week, where Earhart is to be personally congratulated for her feat by the President."
 ustates.163.a: "Quite an achievement!"

 ustates.164.t: "Railway Nationalisation"
 ustates.164.d: "One of the Farmer-Labor Party's Policies it has sought for some time was a nationalisation of the countries Railroads. Now that they have power, the question is how exactly shall railway nationalisation go. Congress is debating between two different proposals for how this shall be implemented. The first proposal is that the railroads will be nationalised but not the cars allowing for private businesses to compete among themselves for customers, while the second plan would include the cars in the nationalisation. Which version shall Congress go with?"
 ustates.164.a: "Nationalise just the Track."
 ustates.164.b: "Nationalise both the Track and the Cars."

 ustates.165.t: "Saint Lawrence Waterway Proposal"
 ustates.165.d: "The Americans have recently put forward a policy of a joint Canadian-American program to create a waterway from Lake Ontario to the Saint Lawrence River and ultimately to the Ocean. Shall we agree to the US proposal or shall we decline and seek to this do on our own?"
 ustates.165.a: "Agree to the proposal."
 ustates.165.b: "We do not need to work with the Americans."

 ustates.166.t: "Canadians Agree"
 ustates.166.d: "The Canadians have agreed and we have begun to create a number of canals together in the Great Lakes and Saint Lawrence River to connect Lake Ontario to the Ocean."
 ustates.166.a: "Great Lakes to the Ocean!"

 ustates.167.t: "Canadians Refuse"
 ustates.167.d: "The Canadians have refused our proposal for some reason and the plan must be put on hold for now."
 ustates.167.a: "Damn you Canada!"

 ustates.168.t: "The End of the Coalition Party"
 ustates.168.d: "With the civil war over and order restored to America, the Coalition ticket has dissolved - making way for the Republicans and Democrats to resume their normal political campaigning."
 ustates.168.a: "God Bless America"

 ustates.169.t: "Liberal Democrats Split from the Democratic Party"
 ustates.169.d: "The Liberals within the Democratic party have reached a breaking point with party leadership. Those in favour of federal primacy in Fair Deal reforms have called for a caucus of liberal Democrats. The press reported on the declarations made, and have dubbed the attendants \"Liberals\" This new name has come to popular usage as of late, and is the informal name of this new breakoff party. Time will tell what this will mean for American politics."
 ustates.169.a: "Interesting."

 ustates.170.t: "Conservative Democrats Split from the Democratic Party"
 ustates.170.d: "The conservatives within the Democratic party have for some time been split on the implications of the Fair Deal. Those that believe the Democratic Party is abandoning state sovereignty for temporary economic benefit have arranged for their first independent caucus. At first called the Independent Democratic Caucus, the name \"Conservative Party\" appears to be more receptive to the press. Time will tell what this will mean for American politics."
 ustates.170.a: "Interesting."

 ustates.171.t: "Not Worth a Bucket of Warm Piss"
 ustates.171.d: "President John Nance Garner has never had much respect for the Vice Presidency. During the National Convention, Garner refused any oeuvres to take the VP slot for someone else's campaign. Garner's choice of Sam Rayburn came with the implicit understanding that Rayburn's position meant very little to the executive branch. This is why today's newspaper of Rayburn coming out to criticises Garner for failing to appease radicals was so shocking. Garner responded in interviews that he disregards anything the VP has to say, as \"Rayburn's position isn't worth a bucket of piss\"."
 ustates.171.a: "How scandalous."

 ustates.172.t: "A Hammer Too Large to Break"
 ustates.172.d: "In thanks from the people of Texas, and in recognition for his undying loyalty to the Democratic party, Garner was given a 400-pound hammer this weekend as a gift. President Garner, who is known to slam his gavels so hard that he has broken several in the first year of Presidency alone, is more than pleased with this gift and is assured it will withstand any anger he throws at it."
 ustates.172.a: "When all you have is a hammer..."

 ustates.173.t: "MacArthur Writes \"An American Caesar\""
 ustates.173.d: "President MacArthur has come out with an autobiography today chronicling his part in the Crisis of 1937. MacArthur's book speaks of his wise ability to see through Long and Reed's campaign, and his willingness to do anything to protect democracy. The tense days in Washington are described in great detail, with emphasis placed on the middle class victims of Red Guard and Minutemen attacks. The book also implies, within his chain of command, there were soldiers who advocated marching on Washington to settle the capitoline debates. MacArthur wouldn't name names, but he writes that he personally discouraged the soldiers from going through with this most treasonous plan."
 ustates.173.a: "The Saviour of Democracy."

 ustates.174.t: "Assassins Miss MacArthur"
 ustates.174.d: "During a meeting today in the National Mall, a shot rang out during MacArthur's speech that nearly caused a stampede of fleeing onlookers. The gun was aimed at President MacArthur by a madman who, once arrested, claimed MacArthur was building a military junta and must be stopped. The ravings of this loon most interestingly have not been traced back to any political group, and it appears to be a lone wolf attempt on the President's life. MacArthur laughed off this ridiculous accusation and has increased the Secret Service's payroll to protect against any more lone wolves."
 ustates.174.a: "You can't stop MacArthur."

 ustates.175.t: "Reconciliation with the Roosevelts"
 ustates.175.d: "The Roosevelt family has been divided ever since the death of former president Theodore Roosevelt. While young Quentin Roosevelt stayed involved in Republican politics, Archibald Roosevelt has left the reservation entirely. Rumours of him associating with industrialists and railing against every president since Hoover including Quentin has come to a head. Archibald and Quentin have met to officially bury the hatchet of politics and reunite their family. This meeting also helps to drive home Quentin's atmosphere of reconciliation instead of punishing dissonance."
 ustates.175.a: "Another family reunited."

 ustates.176.t: "Willkie's Affair Discovered"
 ustates.176.d: "Westbrook Pegler, that sinister exaggerator, just came out with an article alleging that Willkie is cheating on his wife Edith Willkie with journalist Irita Van Doren. The press have taken to this story and our President is besieged by questions of marital infidelity. Our Press Chief is trying his best at damage control, as well as Irita taking a surprise vacation, but the trustworthiness of Willkie has been damaged."
 ustates.176.a: "Damn that Pegler!"

 ustates.177.t: "Willkie Addresses NAACP"
 ustates.177.d: "President Willkie, despite being a lifelong Democrat, never actively endorsed the Southern Democrat line on race. An early critic of John Nance Garner for failing to appeal to black voters in 1936, Willkie made up for that with a historic speech at the NAACP Convention. Speaking in favour of integration in the military, and also getting a few jabs at Republicans and Democrats for failing to protect black voters from the SPA. His speech ended with a support for Jewish rights to democracy, and forewarned that socialists would target them next if antisemitism reached the levels of racism in America. Democrats in Congress are currently ruminating over how to respond, with most wishing to remain silent until next election season."
 ustates.177.a: "Good Ol' Willkie."

 ustates.178.t: "Byrd Rails Against National Highway"
 ustates.178.d: "The Fair Deal negotiations agree on the main purpose of reform, to fix economic stagnation and reduce unemployment. One provision and its implications so perturbs President Byrd, that a majority of his address to Congress was spent condemning it. That National Highway system, which President Byrd describes as a \"massive waste and an enabler of eminent domain\", echoing the Conservative Democratic opposition to any Fair Deal that adds land to the Federal Trust. This position puts Byrd in an interesting cross-section, as some Republicans who see the Highway as overtly anti-dissident as well have joined in his cause."
 ustates.178.a: "A Road too Far."

 ustates.179.t: "Wallace's Hi-Bred Corn"
 ustates.179.d: "Henry Wallace made his fortune in Agronomy, studying under George Washington Carver in university. The breakout success that gave Henry Wallace the ability to pursue politics is the Pioneer Hi-Bred company, a maker of hybrid crops. As president, Wallace has taken his share in Hi-Bred and instructed the Department of Agriculture to disseminate information about hybrid crops, which are beginning to show improvement in water retention over normal crops. The imperative to do this is the ongoing farming disaster in Oklahoma, where dust storms have taken out millions in food. Wallace hopes to solve this issue and save America's food supply."
 ustates.179.a: "We do need food."

 ustates.180.t: "Taylor's Radical Proposal in Congress"
 ustates.180.d: "Out of the several strange requests President Taylor has made over the years, this has to be the hardest to handle. President Taylor has convinced several Progressive Congressmen to revive his old legislation promoting World Unity. Explained as a successor to President Wilson's peace plans he spoke of as the Weltkrieg raged on, World Unity is the preservation of human life and culture and the end of total war. This proposal in Congress was of course defeated, but the gesture has surprisingly boosted President Taylor's reputation."
 ustates.180.a: "We all hope for peace."

 ustates.181.t: "Taylor Takes the Stage Nationwide"
 ustates.181.d: "One of the many eccentric qualities of President Taylor is his singing career. From his time singing to children on the steps of the Capitol building to now singing in front of his millions of constituents. President Taylor has leveraged what would have made him a laughing stock in politics into a genuine expression of his patriotism in art. Taylor sings to promote unity in America over politics, and cooperation instead of victory."
 ustates.181.a: "Sing On, Jim!"

 ustates.182.t: "Barkley Ends the Corvee System"
 ustates.182.d: "A division has appeared between President Barkley and the Democratic Party on Fair Deal Infrastructure. A Congressional debate brought up the idea of allowing a smaller community works to be paid by the government, with repair being handled by the Corvée system. The Corvée system is a tax imposed to pay for prisoners to repair public works. President Barkley spoke out against this idea, as his time in Kentucky taught him that penal labour will never surpass contract labour. This stand also puts pressure on Southern Democrats in his own party that support a state-financed and cheap reconstruction plan. National attention to the Corvée system has led to most states outlawing it."

 ustates.183.d: "Richard Russell's career in Georgia prior to the White House wasn't without its controversy. As a cost-cutting measure, Russell authorised the use of penal labour to undertake constructions for the state. This free labour was compounded by poor living conditions and has eventually come back to haunt Russell. A former prisoner who had his conviction overturned has written a book entitled \"I Am a Fugitive from a Georgia Chain Gang!\". This book describes a corrupt penal system and puts the blame on now-President Russell. Those critical of the President are having a field day with this. Rumours of Hollywood planning a movie on this book have also circulated."

 ustates.184.d: "Dewey's past came gunning for him one Sunday morning at a D.C. restaurant. Gangsters, sent by the Dutch Schultz to avenge his upcoming execution tried shooting at him through the windows. Fortunately, the Secret Service was able to hide President Dewey, and nabbed the gangsters responsible. As a result, Dewey has doubled his security and pressed for further crackdowns nationwide on crime syndicates, as this attempt may encourage copycats. Both Democrat and Republican in Congress have called J Edgar Hoover into Congress to explain how the FBI did not see this coming. Many on the fence about Dewey are now glad their President has survived such a vile plot."

The chaos the war brought and the breakdown of communications meant that in some areas, news was slow to trickle in, but over the last few weeks many have expressed condolences for the former President's passing. The charismatic leader of a wide coalition of political parties found his administration in a quagmire after his failure to successfully resolve the New Year's Strike, and as a result General Douglas MacArthur placed him under house arrest before announcing himself as acting President under dubious circumstances. With the collapse of MacArthur's administration, many wondered what would happen to the newly freed Olson and within the Pacific Government there were calls for Olson to be reinstated as President. Olson however, by then was severely ill, and surprised many by quietly returning to his home and sitting out of the conflict. His only official statement since his release was a call of peace to all still fighting and for the nation to avoid a costly insurgency through negotiation. President Willkie, Olson's former VP, has made a lengthy statement of condolence to Olson's family and has vowed to continue to carry on the legacy of Olson and the Coalition party. It remains, however, to be seen if Willkie can succeed where Olson could not: bringing the nation back together."

The legal status of President Olson remains in question, as is the legitimacy of MacArthur's coup, and likely will continue to be debated by Constitutional scholars.\n\nFor the embattled Federal government however, his death was an uncomfortable reminder of the sordid events leading up to the coup and Federal propagandists have been quick to attempt to go onto the next set of news. Opponents of the federal government have also been quick to lash out against MacArthur despite efforts to silence them in Federal strongholds. Some accuse MacArthur of having the former president murdered, rumours have circulated that the once hopeful American reformer had died from the stress of imprisonment and/or denial of proper medical attention by his guards. But for most, the turmoil following MacArthur's coup continues on and the idealism of Olson's 1936 platform will have to wait to come true."

He quoted Olson's inauguration speech, noting that Olson wanted to end capitalism as we know it and was more than willing to seek a compromise for the good of the country. The story of Olson, however, is also a warning to all hopeful reformers - that the establishment powers are more than willing to use violent means to stop change. Any true believers in Olson's cause must then rally against those who killed him - a corrupt, tyrannical government. Reed concluded his speech by calling for a brief ceasefire and declaring the day a day of mourning. Observers noted that behind him on the podium included many prominent members of Olson's old Farmer-Labor party, who defected to Socialist lines after MacArthur's coup."

In a carefully calibrated speech, the populist recounted that when he met with Olson earlier that year, he was making sure that the American people would not be hoodwinked by Socialist agitators. Whereas Olson genuinely tried to negotiate in good faith, Reed continually made unreasonable demands to stall for time while arming his militias - and the unfortunate Olson was too slow to catch on to it until MacArthur and his Wall Street goons showed Washington's true colours and deposed their own leader. This proof then, that neither the Syndicalists or the Federal establishment had any interest in meaningful talks, and that it is up to America's true patriots to fight on to save the nation.

However, most eyes across the nation fixated on Olson's former running mate - President Wendell Willkie, who has rallied a government based in California to try and restore Democracy in light of MacArthur's coup. With Olson's death, there is no doubt now among Willkie's Constitutionalist supporters who the rightful President is - not that it particularly matters in light of the continued divisions across the nation. Nonetheless, when Willkie made his speech today he spoke more than just about being Olson's legal successor. Willkie impassionately described how the two men campaigned together across the nation with the hope of giving Americans a Square Deal for all and that Olson tried with all of his energy to bring about a compromise that can appeal across the spectrum. The President then swore that he would carry on the torch of the Coalition Party, and make sure that Olson's untimely death was not in vain."

No doubt, the situation has provided a grim reminder for the New England government that democracy in America has been significantly harmed in the aftermath of the MacArthur coup.\n\nWhile Olson was not a favourite of the New England establishment, the Coalition Party was their brain-child and many held high hopes that the coalition would bring an end to radicalism. That hope was dashed with the emergence of five separate governments in the civil war, and the death of Olson to some represents the fall of the American order that had governed the nation for centuries. President [Root.GetLeader] has been quick however to attempt to rally his loyalists.

A sense of normalcy is beginning to be felt across the nation as the democratic process returns to the United States.\n\nPerhaps one of the most popular candidates, Douglas MacArthur, hero of the Second American Civil War, will represent the Republican Party. Hailed as the Cincinnatus of America's darkest hours, MacArthur's military coup may have raised concerns regarding his commitment to American democracy, but citizens were relieved when MacArthur stepped down after his victory. The former commander in chief of the federal army is indeed a favoured candidate, with many seeing MacArthur as the fist needed to rebuild and restore America's presence around the world. Celebrities and even some Democrat politicians have voiced their support for the War President. Election observers and advisors have mostly come to the conclusion that MacArthur's victory will be that of a landslide and the former helm of the nation will lead it once more.\n\nRepresenting the Democratic Party will be Harry Byrd, newspaper publisher, and head of the Democratic Party in Virginia. During his time as Virginia state governor, he pushed through constitutional amendments that streamlined state government and allowed for more efficient use of tax dollars. Popular among southern conservatives, Byrd is a vehement anti-desegregationist and has vowed to keep southern institutions segregated.\n\nWith the full resumption of elections in the United States, the time has come for American voters to make their decisions at polls across the country.

A follow up victory before the Supreme Court saw Willkie triumphantly claim his rightful place in the White House for the duration of the 1936-1940 term. With those four years quickly coming to a close, the upcoming election will pit the Progressive Democrat Wendell Willkie against Republican Quentin Roosevelt.\n\nThe incumbent Democrats have rallied around President Willkie, who has mounted a spirited campaign bolstered by his reputation as Democracy's saviour in the civil war. The lawyer and former executive has vowed to carry on President Olson's policies regarding government social security and has promised a program of full employment based on cooperation between the private and public sectors. Willkie's platform also advocates for America's growing role in the world and, surprisingly for a Democrat, support for the civil rights movement, vowing that he will see the integration of the American Armed Forces.\n\nRoosevelt meanwhile has announced his desire to bring significant reforms to the country through his \"Fair Deal\" policies.

While many saw the strength in MacArthur's military clique in the months and days leading up to the civil war, few anticipated the general would place the President, however controversial, under house arrest, thus undoing everything the founding fathers stood for.\n\nWith the defeat of the dictatorial MacArthur, democracy has finally been restored. MacArthur's hand-picked successor, Al Smith of the Democratic party, shocked many by supporting the democratic provisional Pacific Government in ousting his patron and restoring genuine civilian rule to the United States. With elections coming up, he has announced a return to freedom and liberty, bringing relief to war-weary nations. Furthermore, in honouring America's democratic tradition, Smith announced his official bid to run for President legitimately in the election of 1940. Running against him will be Alf Landon of the Republican Party. The former governor of Kansas, Landon is a prominent liberal member of the Republican party and has promised economic reform while still keeping the American economy competitive. His credentials also include extensive ties with the Oil Industry, himself a founder of a successful oil firm.\n\nWith the full resumption of free elections once more in the United States, the time has come for American voters to make their decisions at polls across the country.

In accordance with the democratic tradition, President MacArthur has announced his desire to run for a second term in the upcoming election of 1944.\nPresident MacArthur's term has been spent mostly trying to escape his actions of 1936 as his administration found itself constantly opposed by the Democrats. The memories of MacArthur's military clique still linger in the halls of Congress, with the Democrat opposition, in particular, denouncing MacArthur as an authoritarian demagogue. The establishment Republicans have lost ground in several states for their concessions to Hearst's clique of wealthy business owners - perhaps a sign that MacArthur may not be able to clinch a second term. Nonetheless despite these setbacks, MacArthur has spoken confidently on the campaign trail - hoping to continue to capitalise on his wartime popularity as perhaps America's most influential general since Ulysses S. Grant.\nThe Democratic opposition has nominated Georgian Congressman Richard Russell Jr., who hopes to rally his conservative white voting base in the upcoming election. An avowed segregationist and perhaps one of the loudest voices against racial integration, Russell has promised that should he secure the presidency - he will ensure that states continue to keep their rights and traditions of segregation. Russell's outspoken white supremacist views have certainly placed him at odds with those seeking greater racial equality in the United States.

A sympathetic ally to the plight of the labour movement, Chandler has sided with the unionisation and organisation of miners in the past, making him a popular candidate amongst those in the Steel Belt. Nonetheless, he is not without controversy - the African-American community is troubled by Chandler's past refusal to repeal the poll taxes and end lynching.

Given its natural resources and geopolitical position, it is likely [FROM.GetNameDef] will return to a place of prominence in world affairs, and a pact with them will bolster our efforts at preserving mutual security.\n\nThat said, as we deliberate on a final response, there have been some concerns about the nature of this alliance, and how truly equal of a partnership it would entail."
 ustates.281.a: "Of course! We welcome them."
 ustates.281.b: "We have no need of them."

 ustates.282.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Refuses"
 ustates.282.d: "The [From.GetAdjective] government has refused our request to join their alliance. Perhaps we are not good enough for their measure, or unworthy as an ally. Either way, the answer was clearly no."
 ustates.282.a: "A poor decision on their part."

 ustates.283.t: "General MacArthur Sworn in as President"
 ustates.283.d: "General MacArthur's \"temporary\" occupation of the White House has led not to a calming of tensions, but a fiery shockwave of resistance all across the nation. With the situation worse than any in D.C. could have predicted, a new Presidential Succession Law, passed quickly by a joint session of a rump Congress shorn of its SPA and AFP members, has decreed that, in the case of Presidential incapacitation or absence, the Vice President and cabinet have the authority to transfer the President's authority as Commander-in-Chief to another member of the military or government. In the case of the entire cabinet's incapacitation, the responsibilities of the executive shall fall on the Chief of Staff of the United States Army.\n\nPresident MacArthur has been even more hurriedly sworn in in the midst of his preparations for incoming civil war, and has addressed the nation, reminding all \"traitors\" that they still have time to lay down their arms."
 ustates.283.a: "We need hard men for hard times."
 ustates.283.b: "A barefaced assault on the Constitution!"

 ustates.285.t: "Cure for Polio"
 ustates.285.d: "Dr. Jonas Salk has created a cure for Polio. This is a miracle cure that many are calling a breakthrough in modern science. The scourge of Polio in America will now be forever gone from the minds of Americans. Parents are lining up in droves at health clinics across the country to get the vaccine for their children and themselves."
 ustates.285.a: "Thank you Dr. Salk."

### Military stuff ###

 ustates.300.t: "Military Research"
 ustates.300.d: "We are having our best scientists and business leaders look into what we should invest our efforts into guns, artillery, tanks, our improving our own doctrines. What should we choose?"
 ustates.300.a: "Modernise our Guns."
 ustates.300.b: "Modernise our Artillery."
 ustates.300.c: "Modernise our Tanks."
 ustates.300.e: "Modernise our Doctrines."

 ustates.301.t: "Full Utilisation of Force"
 ustates.301.d: "The aftermath of the Second Civil War has given us time to assess not only the holes in our military capabilities, but potential improvements as well. Our General Staff has determined that we can outpace conventional engine based aeroplanes with the new fuel and thrust tech developed by Lawrence Bell. At the same time, we have procured enough engineers and scientists for Neddermeyer's idea for a plutonium gun nuclear weapon."
 ustates.301.a: "Lawrence Bell's Jet."
 ustates.301.b: "Oppenheimer's Atom Bomb."
 ustates.301.c: "Authorise more funds for both."

 ustates.302.t: "Albuquerque Project"
 ustates.302.d: "Bell's X project has proceeded satisfactorily, with a successful implementation of rocket technology into planes being able to double the speed of older aircraft. Brave test pilot Jack Woolams today was the first person to fly the plane faster than 741 miles per hour, breaking the sound barrier."
 ustates.302.a: "Prepared for even Interplanetary War."

 ustates.303.t: "Winchester Project"
 ustates.303.d: "The project ran into a significant problem when it was discovered that the nuclear material Plutonium has a fission rate too fast for a bullet. The solution came in the form of depleted Uranium initially planned for a different nuclear project. This makes the weapon barely ethical under normal nuclear waste usage guidelines, and creates the issue of intentional biological damage from radiation on the target. Nonetheless, the Thin Man is a success"
 ustates.303.a: "We are safe from Oppenheimer's deadly toy."

 ustates.304.t: "The War and Peace Studies"
 ustates.304.d: "In the past, our diplomatic conduct has been at the whim of ambassadors, many of whom had bought their positions from the party. The world we live in is too dangerous to afford such flippant choices to be made by agents of America, it is General MacArthur's opinion that a new approach to foreign policy is necessary, one that derives consensus from a group of trusted experts. This is what inspired the War and Peace Studies, a calling for only the brightest to represent America in this brave new world. This entity, the so-called the Council on Foreign Relations, will advise General MacArthur on how to suppress radical forces from any corner of the world."
 ustates.304.a: "Constrained by diplomats no more."

 ustates.305.t: "The White House and Xanadu"
 ustates.305.d: "A surprising amount of support came from the pages of the many Hearst Newspapers that dot America. These papers drew up the image of MacArthur as the heroic Cincinnatus, hearing the call to save the Republic from certain destruction. A beacon for MacArthur's allies and the creation of an almost mythical personage through films and newspaper cartoons, Hearst has served as a stabilising factor to the ship of the state. Even Hearst's attacks on radical unions and populists seemed to echo the words of MacArthur's radio speeches."
 ustates.305.a: "We appreciate your support."

 ustates.306.t: "The New Normal in America"
 ustates.306.d: "When General MacArthur announced that he would not step down as leader, it was under the pretence of emergency. At the time, hundreds of thousands of Americans were unaccounted for, radicals prowled the countryside funding their politics with looted money, and the democratic pillar was unready to hold up the state. These past few years have seen a great many galvanise into hardy MacArthurites, and a new flavour of politician has emerged in the House of Representatives. These Congressmen see the need for an integral military role to check and nurture the business environment and ensure the rights of citizens cannot be infringed due to gridlock."
 ustates.306.a: "Endorse the new supporters."
 ustates.306.b: "Refuse this congressional oeuvre."

 ustates.308.t: "Superweapons on a Budget"
 ustates.308.d: "In the last few years, our military research has focused on the potential for internal conflict, narrowing our focus and budget for longer-term projects. This years' Congressional Budget has fortunately found some money to allocate to a long-term project. Three plans are presented to the military high command to meet and exceed the military projects of our rivals. The first is a rocket by Goddard theoretically capable of delivering explosives from miles away without risking pilot lives. The second is Oppenheimer's planned theoretical bomb using radioactive heavy metals as researched in Austria and Germany. The third is a much cheaper plan as proposed by the eccentric Wilhelm Reich, he claims that a bomb can be made much cheaper using his own personal physics research. On our part, we don't know much about what Wilhelm Reich is talking about, but his reputation in Austria gives us some comfort into whatever science he's using."
 ustates.308.a: "Goddard's Rocket."
 ustates.308.b: "Oppenheimer's Bomb."
 ustates.308.c: "Reich's Bomb."

 ustates.309.t: "Goddard's Successful Launch"
 ustates.309.d: "At home again in Roswell, New Mexico, Goddard again goes to launch test rockets. The last time he was here, the rockets were smaller than his thigh, and reached only a thousand feet in height. Now the rockets soar miles over the desert and touch down with their dummy weights. Goddard's refusal to detonate explosive rockets on the Continental United States prevent the full scale of the damage to be known."
 ustates.309.a: "Good boy Goddard."

 ustates.310.t: "Oppenheimer's Bomb a Success"
 ustates.310.d: "An invitation by Oppenheimer was sent out to nuclear researchers, physicists, and engineers throughout Europe. The promise of escaping persecution in Europe has resounded most strongly to Jewish scientists, some of whom emigrated to the US for the project. After a long period of experimentation and some cooperation with colleagues in Europe, a working atomic bomb is ready to be tested. The skies of Alamogordo New Mexico lit up in a flash of destruction as the test bomb Valediction exploded. Oppenheimer later said that the bomb was named after his favourite John Donne poem."
 ustates.310.a: "The breath goes now."

 ustates.311.t: "Reich's Failed Explosion"
 ustates.311.d: "After many delays and several attempts to obfuscate the general staff, Wilhelm Reich's bomb project has been discontinued and it seems millions of dollars have been wasted on bunk. This became apparent to Reich's observers when tests showing his energy, named Orgone, could induce exothermic reactions that only he and his associates could see. The bomb itself being a hollow shell with layers of metals covering that never did explode, save for its collapse when Reich attempted to destroy it during the investigation. This embarrassment is currently making its rounds in the papers."
 ustates.311.a: "Not our proudest moment."

### New Pre-ACW Events ###
 ustates.500.t: "Garner-Wagner Bill Re-Introduced"
 ustates.500.d: "With assurances made by President Hoover that, unlike in 1932, this time he will not veto the bill, Democratic Senator Robert Wagner and Speaker of the House John Nance Garner have re-introduced their unemployment relief legislation package. Many in Congress feel that the package does not go nearly far enough, while others wonder how America - in the midst of a massive economic crisis - will possibly ever pay for it. The presence of Senators from the AFP and the SPA also complicates things immensely. Even with Hoover's pledge, it's unknown if Garner-Wagner has a real chance of passing."
 ustates.500.a: "We shall see"

 ustates.501.t: "Long and Reed Demand Changes"
 ustates.501.d: "As expected, the early challenges to the Garner-Wagner Bill have come from the AFP and the SPA. Huey Long and his AFP Senators have demanded a vast increase in the social security provisions the bill provides, provisions most other Senators say America could never afford. Jack Reed and the SPA, meanwhile, say the bill doesn't do enough to protect the average worker, particularly from exploitation by struggling corporations. Both parties have attracted a lot of media attention, adding to the general sense of disorder and tension in Congress."
 ustates.501.a: "Interesting"

 ustates.502.t: "Senators Break Ranks"
 ustates.502.d: "After weeks of negotiations, a number of establishment Senators have broken ranks over the coming vote on the Garner-Wagner Bill - most notably Robert Wagner, one of the bill's proposers, who says he will not vote for the bill unless protections for federal unemployment insurance are re-added. Many other Democrat and Republican Senators are concerned about the influence of the AFP and the SPA, and claim they will not vote for the bill if *any* concessions are made to either group... though others say that not courting either the AFP or SPA will make passage difficult if not impossible. President Hoover will need to intervene in order to save the bill."
 ustates.502.a: "Pledge support to Wagner and the establishment Senators"
 ustates.502.b: "Force the establishment to compromise with the AFP"
 ustates.502.c: "Force the establishment to compromise with the SPA"

 ustates.503.t: "Long and Reed Furious"
 ustates.503.d: "Both Huey Long's AFP and Jack Reed's SPA have reacted with fury at President Hoover's endorsement of establishment Senators. They have vowed to sink the Garner-Wagner Bill, claiming that the public is being deceived by a \"corrupt government which refuses to recognise the reality of America\". While the parties have both gained a considerable boost in support from their base, Democratic and Republican fortunes have improved somewhat, and there is a feeling that both have a better chance going into the next election... provided the bill actually passes."
 ustates.503.a: "Let's hope it does!"

 ustates.504.t: "Compromise with the AFP"
 ustates.504.d: "Recent days have resulted in a compromise between many establishment Senators and the America First Party, with numerous extra provisions included for farm relief and unemployment protection - though nowhere near as far as the AFP originally demanded. Even so, Huey Long has declared this as a victory and is riding high in recent polls. Both Jack Reed's SPA and a large number of Republican Senators have declared this a betrayal of the American public, however, and have vowed to sink the Garner-Wagner bill when the vote comes."
 ustates.504.a: "We've done what we can..."

 ustates.505.t: "Compromise with the SPA"
 ustates.505.d: "Recent days have resulted in a compromise between many establishment Senators and the Socialist Party of America, with numerous extra provisions included for worker protections and unemployment relief - though nowhere near as far as the SPA originally demanded. Even so, Jack Reed has declared this as a victory and is riding high in recent polls. Both Huey Long's AFP and a large number of Democratic Senators have declared this a betrayal of the American public, however, and have vowed to sink the Garner-Wagner bill when the vote comes."
 ustates.505.a: "We've done what we can..."

 ustates.506.t: "Voting Commences on the Garner-Wagner Bill"
 ustates.506.d: "Voting has now begun on the Garner-Wagner Bill. With Congress divided between AFP, SPA and establishment Senators, whether or not the bill will pass is anything but certain. Even if the bill passes, the question of where its funding will come from remains without an answer - however, if it fails, the consequences will be disastrous and widespread violence can be expected."
 ustates.506.a: "... the bill is approved!"
 ustates.506.b: "... the bill is shot down!"

 ustates.507.t: "The Garner-Wagner Bill Passes!"
 ustates.507.d: "Though the vote was incredibly close, the Garner-Wagner bill has passed Congress. People throughout the United States are celebrating this welcome relief to the country's disastrous economic situation, though many within the government are wondering: how will the bill now be paid for?"
 ustates.507.a: "A victory for us all!"

 ustates.508.t: "The Garner-Wagner Bill Fails!"
 ustates.508.d: "After an incredibly close vote in Congress, the Garner-Wagner bill failed to pass. While several groups are declaring personal victory, protests have broken out in various parts of the country. There will be no relief for the American worker, and many have declared the government to be corrupt and dysfunctional. There will be considerable time for blame, but for the moment the Hoover government's concerns must turn to the growing violence throughout American cities - violence which is expected to only worsen in the months leading up to the election."
 ustates.508.a: "All that for nothing..."

 ustates.509.t: "War Plan White"
 ustates.509.d: "The time has come to dust off one of the American military's colour-coded war plans, this one meant for dealing with domestic disturbances and insurgencies. It cannot come a moment too soon, as violence is escalating in areas where the AFP and the SPA have been contending with local authorities for dominance. Minnesota and North Carolina are the two states where the violence is at its height, and - at the moment - we can only focus our efforts in one place."
 ustates.509.a: "Focus on the SPA in Minnesota"
 ustates.509.b: "Focus on the AFP in North Carolina"

 ustates.510.t: "Bringing out the National Guard"
 ustates.510.d: "The National Guard has been deployed for over six months now, fighting to maintain security in a number of American cities, but there is a growing fear that commanders within the Guard are not entirely loyal to the Republic, that many harbour sympathies for the AFP and the SPA. More focus needs to be put on strengthening the units we know are loyal. We also need to decide where to focus their deployment, for the time being."
 ustates.510.a: "Focus on restoring order in Minnesota"
 ustates.510.b: "Focus on restoring order in Iowa"
 ustates.510.c: "Focus on restoring order in Tennessee"

 ustates.511.t: "General MacArthur's Plan"
 ustates.511.d: "There is growing concern that America is descending into a possible civil war, and that - despite all our efforts to maintain security - supporters of the AFP and the SPA simply have too much influence in some parts of the country. General Douglas MacArthur has unveiled a plan to infiltrate key areas in either New York City or southern Texas. Both are of high importance, New York for its industry and Texas for its oil, and both are at high risk to takeover. MacArthur says that these efforts might still come to naught if the AFP and SPA's power become too great, but he believes it will greatly increase the government's chances of maintaining control should it come to an armed conflict."
 ustates.511.a: "New York City is of vital importance"
 ustates.511.b: "We absolutely need that Texan oil"

 ustates.512.t: "The Barkley Plan"
 ustates.512.d: "Alben Barkley, Democrat and junior Senator for Kentucky, has introduced a bill which will see the relief efforts largely funded by taxing American corporations - in exchange for hefty tax considerations down the line, once the economy has recovered. This has caused considerably controversy in some corners, especially among AFP and SPA supporters. Others say it would be far too easy for the next government to reverse the decision, leaving the corporations holding the bag and even worse off than they were before. Regardless, there is enough support to see the bill passed - and, as an added bonus, the agency to coordinate the efforts could be placed in either Minneapolis or in Charlotte, with the added bonus of new employment weakening what are AFP and SPA strongholds."
 ustates.512.a: "Base the agency in Minneapolis"
 ustates.512.b: "Base the agency in Charlotte"

 ustates.513.t: "The New Industrial Act"
 ustates.513.d: "As an offshoot of the Barkley Plan, relief efforts will see new industrial growth in several vital areas - primarily in the military sector. Several of these new companies are planned for Denver, Colorado. At least one other area can be promoted, and the cabinet believes that putting them in depressed areas which are currently strongholds of the AFP or SPA may see their influence in those areas drastically weakened."
 ustates.513.a: "Promote the industry in Minnesota"
 ustates.513.b: "Promote the industry in Iowa"
 ustates.513.c: "Promote the industry in Tennessee"

 ustates.514.t: "The Shipyard Funding Scheme"
 ustates.514.d: "The Barkley Plan has led to two major shipbuilding companies vying for a federal contract, one in New York City and the other in Corpus Christi. Both would mean a large number of jobs for the area, and would be a boon for our control over the region. The problem is that word of the contract has gotten out, and whichever city we *don't* choose will likely be enraged, giving strength to the AFP or the SPA in the region."
 ustates.514.a: "Give the contract to New York City"
 ustates.514.b: "Give the contract to Corpus Christi"

 ustates.515.t: "America Demands War Debts"
 ustates.515.d: "It came as a surprise to the Canadian government, but the ambassador from [USA.GetNameDef] has demanded that the Canadian government immediately begin repaying the war debts incurred by the British Empire during the Weltkrieg. While the Americans are gripped in an economic crisis, one Canada has, to an extent, avoided, they must know the Canadians can never repay the debt... not all at once, at least. Though the old United Kingdom was on its way to repayment, there was a tacit agreement after the British Revolution that the debts wouldn't continue to be repaid until the Home Islands were recaptured. For the Americans to demand it now, they must either be desperate or must be catering to the more warlike and isolationist elements in their government."
 ustates.515.a: "Whatever the reason, we cannot do as they demand"

 ustates.516.t: "Canada Refuses"
 ustates.516.d: "The Canadian government has responded to the demand with a flat refusal. The debt, they say, was never meant to be repaid until the Home Islands were retaken - as most was incurred by the United Kingdom, a government which is now in exile. Even so, their refusal has done its job and fired up the isolationist elements of the American government. President Hoover's government has the support it needs, at the cost of relations with the Canadians."
 ustates.516.a: "So be it."

 ustates.517.t: "Compromise with America?"
 ustates.517.d: "There has been a break in the chilly relations with the American government since their demand for debt repayment. They have approached us with an offer: economic assistance now, and an agreement to increase trade with the Entente, in exchange for the rest of the debt being delayed until the Home Isles are retaken... which was, aides point out, the original deal to begin with. It might be a way to restore goodwill with our southern neighbours, and even help them, though some are suggesting that there's no point in shovelling our limited funds into a bottomless pit. America is lost, they say, and we should look to our own first."
 ustates.517.a: "We agree to the compromise"
 ustates.517.b: "They are on their own"

 ustates.518.t: "Canada Agrees to Compromise"
 ustates.518.d: "The Canadian government has reluctantly agreed to the compromise, giving us what repayment they can now and accepting the deferment until the Home Isles have been retaken. In exchange, a trade agreement has been put in place with the Entente, something that's likely beneficial for us all. The main downside is that the agreement has been viewed as treachery by the AFP and the SPA, both of which claim our corrupt government has betrayed the very people they fired up only moments before."
 ustates.518.a: "We'll take what we can get"

 ustates.519.t: "Canada Refuses the Compromise"
 ustates.519.d: "The Canadian government has refused our offer of compromise, leading to economic sanctions applied by both sides. The chance of this escalating to war is slight, but the damage is done. We'll have to be satisfied with the gains we've made, and the increased revenue from the tariffs."
 ustates.519.a: "It was worth a try"

 ustates.520.t: "Long Bans the SPA from Congress"
 ustates.520.d: "In a fiery speech, President Long declared that his intended reforms would have to wait - of far more pressing importance was the SPA and its insidious influence over America. The ongoing New Year's Strike is its doing, and it is America's number one public enemy. An executive order banned the SPA from Congress, and named the Minutemen as acting with emergency invested authority as executors of the president's will. While some in the halls of power are relieved to see action being taken against the SPA, many more are alarmed by President Long's use of executive power."
 ustates.520.a: "So must it be"

 ustates.521.t: "Reed Bans America First from Congress"
 ustates.521.d: "In a fiery speech, President Reed declared that his intended reforms would have to wait - of far more pressing importance was the America First Party and its insidious influence over America. So long as the Minutemen militias run rampant, attacking strikers and innocent Americans alike, it will be America's number one public enemy. An executive order banned the AFP from Congress, and called on the SPA militias to act as emergency reinforcement to government forces. While some in the halls of power are relieved to see action being taken against the Minutemen, many more are alarmed by President Reed's use of executive power."
 ustates.521.a: "This has to be done, for the good of America"

 ustates.522.t: "Executive Order 7061: Declare AFP Terrorist Organisation"
 ustates.522.d: "Citing national concerns due to the anarchistic nature of the Minutemen and the America First Party, Jack Reed has passed an executive order that has declared them an illegal organisation which seeks to overthrow the country, and as such all force shall be used to oppose them. Reed has drawn a direct comparison between the Minutemen and the terrorist attacks that occurred on Preparedness Day in 1916, and Wall Street in 1920. The Minutemen are now subject to the Sedition Act of 1918, prosecuted as an anti-recruitment and vigilante group."
 ustates.522.a: "Excellent!"

 ustates.523.t: "Long Defies the Order"
 ustates.523.d: "Huey Long publicly denounced Reed's executive order as being unconstitutional and an act meant to suppress opposition to his rule and pave the way for syndicalist reforms in America. Long has organised large rallies and protests with the Minutemen there to keep the protestors safe from aggression. These highly reported-on protests have seen union strikers beaten by Minutemen without interference from the police, which calls into question Reed's ability to protect Americans."
 ustates.523.a: "Rely on the police to keep control"

 ustates.524.t: "Police Forces Defy Reed"
 ustates.524.d: "In an unexpected move, the police have refused to enforce the various executive orders. Within Atlanta, New Orleans, Houston, and other cities scattered throughout the American South, they have declared a Police Strike in solidarity with the AFP. While they worked to keep order, Police union leaders publicly declare that they would not follow the Laws of \"Reed the Tyrant\". Thus Reed has called in the US Army to enforce his laws."
 ustates.524.a: "Send in the big boys"

 ustates.525.t: "The Minutemen Clash with the SPA"
 ustates.525.d: "When government forces, bolstered by SPA militia, arrived in the American South to enforce the laws of the President, they were immediately set upon by Minutemen and supporters of the AFP. Shoot-outs quickly became commonplace, and the violence quickly spread throughout almost every major city in the American South. It is very clear that the government has no remaining authority there."
 ustates.525.a: "Send in the biggest guys we've got"

 ustates.526.t: "Time's Up!"
 ustates.526.d.reed: "Reed's support in D.C has finally bottomed out. General Douglas MacArthur has marched into Washington D.C today, to arrest Reed and his cabinet at the White House, citing misgovernance and inaction that was putting the entire nation at risk of falling to radical elements. MacArthur's marchers reminded many in D.C of Cox's Army of 1932, except these men are motivated to preserve the status quo, and were cheered instead of booed. Having been tipped off by SPA informants in MacArthur's command staff, Reed was able to stay ahead of the general and has escaped to Chicago. MacArthur has chosen to inhabit the White House and coordinate an investigation into Reed from the executive chair. Civil war is imminent."
 ustates.526.d.long: "Long's support in D.C has finally bottomed out. General Douglas MacArthur marched into Washington D.C today to restore order, citing misgovernance and inaction on the part of the president which was putting the entire nation at risk of falling to radical elements. MacArthur's marchers reminded many in D.C. of Cox's Army of 1932, except these men are motivated to preserve the status quo, and were cheered instead of booed. Having been tipped off by AFP informants in MacArthur's command staff, Long was able to stay ahead of the traitorous general and has escaped to Baton Rouge. MacArthur has chosen to inhabit the White House and coordinate an investigation into Long from the executive chair. Civil war is imminent."
 ustates.526.d.oldguard: "It appears [USA.GetLeader] has lost the confidence of his government. General Douglas MacArthur marched into Washington D.C today, having declared the president an \"ineffective leader whose inaction has endangered America\". MacArthur's marchers reminded many in D.C. of Cox's Army of 1932, except these men are motivated to preserve the country from extremist forces. With the President disgraced, and the Vice President still engaged in talks in Seattle, the president's own cabinet has assured the public that the coup is necessary, and have been working with MacArthur to install an emergency government from the White House - even as the majority of America looks on in shock. Civil war is imminent."
 ustates.526.a: "Damn you, MacArthur! We would have gotten to it eventually!"

 ustates.530.t: "An Envoy from the East"
 ustates.530.d: "Ever since word arrived in [Root.GetNameDef] regarding General MacArthur willingly stepping down from power out east, we have wondered if we would hear from the new government. The ceasefire has held, after all - so do they desire peace? Our question has been answered with the arrival of an envoy from the Federal government. They wish to meet once again, this time to talk about a reunion between our democratic governments. Most here in the west are willing, but there are many who say that MacArthur must first pay for his crimes. He is as much a traitor as Long and Reed, after all... if they are not willing to put him on trial as such, then how can we ever trust their word?"
 ustates.530.a: "MacArthur did America a favour - we will rejoin, no questions asked"
 ustates.530.b: "Yes, let them know we demand MacArthur be imprisoned first"
 ustates.530.c: "We do not trust them, now or ever"

 ustates.531.t: "The West Refuses to Meet"
 ustates.531.d: "Sadly, the Pacific government has refused to meet with us. In the word of their letter: they simply don't believe we have regained true democracy."
 ustates.531.a: "So be it."

 ustates.532.t: "On One Condition..."
 ustates.532.d: "The Pacific government seems amenable to rejoining [Root.GetNameDef]... on one condition: that MacArthur be imprisoned and put on trial as a traitor. According to [From.GetNameDef], he is as much responsible for the death and destruction of the civil war as Reed and Long, and so long as he is not held to the same example as those men they cannot trust that our return to democracy is real. It could be done, and many in our cabinet say it must be, for the sake of peace, but truth be told MacArthur is considered by many Americans to be a hero. He won the civil war for us. To repay him this way seems almost unthinkable."
 ustates.532.a: "For the good of America, let it be done"
 ustates.532.b: "MacArthur is a goddamn hero - refuse"

 ustates.533.t: "There Will Be No Deal"
 ustates.533.d: "The American government has responded to our demand with abject refusal. General Douglas MacArthur, they say, is a hero, one they see as having saved the country from syndicalism and radicalism, and one who gave up power once his duty was done. They would rather go to war than see his accomplishments denigrated."
 ustates.533.a: "Then war it is"

 ustates.534.t: "The Federal Government Agrees"
 ustates.534.d: "While they are reluctant, for the sake of America the Federal government has agreed to our demand. Other matters will need to be addressed over time, but for the time being the General has been arrested and will await trial once we have rejoined the country."

 ustates.536.d.full: "With the restoration of democracy in the United States, the breakaway faction in the west evidently had no reason to continue the civil war. After several meetings between the two governments, the Pacific States of America has agreed to a full peace with the east and has rejoined the federation. Crowds have filled the streets of cities from one end of America to the other, jubilant at the news that there will be no war and the Second American Civil War is now truly over."
 ustates.536.d.arrest: "With the restoration of democracy in the United States, the breakaway faction in the west evidently had no reason to continue the civil war. After several meetings between the two governments, the only condition imposed by Pacific States was that General Douglas MacArthur be arrested and tried for treason. According to American officials, the West considered MacArthur just as much a traitor as Huey Long and Jack Reed, and just as responsible for the death and destruction that ensued. Many in the United States consider MacArthur a hero, however, so when news was revealed of his arrest, angry demonstrations were just as prevalent as celebrations at the Pacific government's agreement to rejoin. It will likely take years for MacArthur's case to go to trial, and without a doubt will be a sensation, but for now the American Civil War is truly over."

 ustates.538.d.1936: "America had a brief period of calm today with a mostly peaceful Independence Day celebration. Commemorating the signing of the Declaration of Independence in 1776 by the Second Continental Congress on the eve of the American Revolutionary war, the holiday is one of great importance to the American people. While many were worried that the rising tensions in America would result in yet another bout of violence in the long and brutal election season, most sighed a breath of relief today as the news reported little brawling during the annual celebration. While all the major candidates made sure to be seen and photographed among the large crowds and delivered speeches connecting their respective causes to the situation in 1776, most Americans took the time to take a break from the intense politics plaguing America. Instead they decided to just spend time with their families and friends amidst picnics and fireworks. It would seem for a brief moment, that America had finally received something it had lacked for a very long time... unity."
 ustates.538.d.1937_USA_democratic: "Since the start of hostilities this year, many Americans held onto the false hope that the violence would settle down quickly and the politicians would find a solution without war. However, the 30 day deadline came and went, and America has found itself at war. President [Root.GetLeader] took to the air waves today in a widely-listened to broadcast in which he extolled American virtues and sacrifices while at war. He noted that July 4th was a day the disparate 13 colonies came together as one, and to found the great nation that Americans are now fighting for. To build a nation founded on democracy, prosperity, and unity. That despite their many differences, the founders were willing to put that aside and work peacefully to not only defend against British oppression, but also build a project to last generations. The radicals, he says, have sought to topple that peace and unity, to curtail democratic expression and replace voting with violence when they didn't get their way. So, one more time, Americans must come together and fend off those who would destroy the American way of life."

However, the 30 day deadline came and went, and America has found itself at war. Today, America celebrates the anniversary of America's founding in the middle of civil war. Seeking to emulate General Washington's July 9th reading of the Declaration of Independence to the Continental Army gathered in New York City and rally the American people once again, President MacArthur has decided to deliver a speech before Federalist troops today. Noting that Washington had delivered his address even with British troops in the harbour, MacArthur reaffirmed that the United States military had always fought for American liberty and would continue to do so into the 20th century. Likening Congress's grant of emergency powers to him to Washington's commission as Commander-in-Chief, MacArthur concluded his speech by promising the American people to restore order to the Union."

However, the 30 day deadline came and went, and America has found itself at war. While President Reed had hoped to make his address near Independence Hall in Philadelphia, his staff dissuaded him from the plan. Instead, Reed has elected to speak before assembled leaders at a local union chapter. Despite the relatively humble setting, the crowd watched with rapt attention. He noted that back in the day Americans had found themselves chafing under greed and neglect, and on this day they had formally organised for freedom from their chains. Noting that the first declaration had 27 points of grievances against the British, to roaring applause Reed pulled out a list of 27 grievances the modern worker had and declared that the CSA would continue to fight on for a new America!"

However, the 30 day deadline came and went, and America has found itself at war. President Huey Long made an address before a cheering crowd of supporters. While minutemen standing behind him scanned the rally for any would-be assassins, the crowd remained enthralled by the power of Long's voice. Long pointed out that in 1776, Americans were ruled by corrupt British oligarchs backed by the ruthless bayonets of the Redcoats. Despite the long odds however, American patriots rose up and drove out not only the British but their treacherous loyalists. Today he says, is no different. Americans must remain vigilant against the avaricious elite and their collaborators, and the modern minutemen stand ready to save America once again! Just as he finished, the fireworks show began behind him, much to the crowd's delight."

However, the 30 day deadline came and went, and America has found itself at war. Today President [Root.GetLeader] has made an address before the provisional United States Congress. He said that in 1776, the Continental Congress declared war against tyranny and sought to preserve the rights of Americans, and soon became a beacon of liberty for many others. He emphasised that it was a democratically elected legislature, not a general or political strongman, who authorised the declaration of freedom. Today, he says, America finds itself once again at war against tyranny, fighting against forces willing to extinguish the flames of liberty. The President concluded by declaring that once America had vanquished the dictators in the East the restored constitutional government would once again live up to the Founder's dream of Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness, and moreover from Sea to Shining Sea."

However, the 30 day deadline came and went, and America has found itself at war. Some say New England was lucky to have avoided directly participating in the war. However, the atmosphere has remained tense and war looms on the horizon. While many detractors have pointed out the irony in celebrating the Fourth of July in the midst of a Canadian occupation, the provisional government in New England had sought to combat the perception of being a Canadian puppet by putting on a memorable Fourth of July celebration. Speaking before Bunker Hill monument, President [Root.GetLeader] delivered his address by recalling the sacrifices Americans made in order to protect the liberty and prosperity of the nation, bravely waiting until they could see the whites in their enemies eyes before firing their limited ammunition. He went on to stress that Americans and Canadians were working now as equal partners and brothers, and that someday America would be free once more."

He stressed that, although their soldiers may not be there to celebrate with them, they are fighting for the most sacred cause - that of liberty. Through the years, America has never stopped fighting for its democracy. Not in the highs and lows of the Revolution, not in 1812 when Washington fell, not in the Civil War.

General MacArthur proudly delivered another defiant speech to rally his men, noting that despite all the troubles and hardships, the Army of the Free always came out victorious. From Valley Forge, to Custer's ranks, to San Juan Hill and modern tanks. He recalled in the last civil war, that on July 4th was a turning point - the day Lee withdrew from Gettysburg and Grant took Vicksburg. The point is, he concluded, that so long as America and her army remains standing strong, the war is not over and neither is the American dream. Thanking the assembled troops and extolling their virtues, the Commander in Chief vowed that as dark as things may seem sometimes, order will be restored in America and normalcy will return."

President Reed, despite reports of ill health caused by the duration of the war, appeared in good spirits today as he addressed his people. He noted that in better days, the Fourth of July was a day to celebrate because it marked the start of the American Experiment. Although the revolution had caused much damage and suffering, Americans continued to fight on. And through the ashes were able to build a new society not seen before on Earth. The President promised that although America is in the midst of a brutal civil war, the Second American revolution will once again build a new order out of the ashes, one that will spell both liberty and mutual prosperity for all.

Although the makeup did little to hide the bags under the President's eyes, Long spoke with as much fervour as always. The war is a time of troubles and strife no doubt, but it was that way back in the Revolution. The Patriots have always come out on top in the end, and this time America's sons of liberty are fighting to rid America once and for all of those who would harm her - the unruly Socialists in Chicago, the decadent bankers on Wall Street, the imperious military men in Washington. The Fourth of July, the President noted, is a day patriots have always come together as one. And with God's help, he went on, when the war is over they will do so once again."

Speaking before the assembled congressmen, and knowing that his speech was being recorded for all to hear, the President noted that despite all chaos and turmoil, the democratic government in America continued to function. Proof, he said, that America does not need dictatorships and tyrants in order to continue functioning. And although things could be pretty bleak, there was no shortage of people willing to continue fighting for liberty then, in 1776, and there is no shortage of people willing to fight for liberty now.

Despite the tension and the numerous refugees, the people of New England tried their best to celebrate the Fourth of July as usual. President [Root.GetLeader] delivered an address to the people, noting that New England has always been a leader in America, and is working to help ensure that America will emerge from the civil war free. In the meantime, his administration works to keep New England from invasion and to solve the lingering effects of the depression.

 ustates.538.d.post_war_ceasefire: "The war has ended... for now. An uneasy ceasefire has been established between East and West in America as both sides work to stabilise their respective territories and consolidate power. Much of America on both sides remains ravaged by the bombings and fighting, and casualties have been high. Americans pray for a peaceful outcome to the standoff, hoping for a solution that sees their side come out on top while avoiding further conflict. Still, on July Fourth both sides of the border have seen their people turn out for celebration, initially muted before celebrating a Fourth of July finally free of war. The sorrow and horror of the years before, between Depression and War, has receded for the day as people stop worrying for just a little bit. Indeed, some have speculated that maybe this peace could last with just a little bit of negotiations. Although the future remains uncertain, the politicians and generals continue to plot and plan, one thing is for certain - we are one people with a common history. And now, we look to see whether or not we will emerge from this crisis one people once again, and our fates joined together once more."
 ustates.538.d.post_war_NEE_exists: "The war has concluded with most of America united under one banner. However, the fate of New England is a question that remains in the air. New England is too much of an integral part of the USA for any American government to allow it to remain independent, however it remains to be seen whether or not reunification will be peaceful or not. Tensions remain in the air, however as the situation continues into July both sides of the border now celebrate the Fourth of July, a Fourth of July free of further civil war and killings (for now). While some of the more hawkish complain that, generations later Boston remains under British occupation and have tried to draw on the holiday to agitate for a violent liberation of New England, the vast majority of Americans on both sides have taken the holiday as a chance for a peaceful respite from all the troubles the last few years have caused. Although the future remains in flux, one thing is for certain - we are one people with a common history.

With the Civil War behind them and the wounds in America's infrastructure and psyche slowly healing, America has slowly returned to a sense of normalcy. With barbecues and parades, streamers and fireworks, America commemorates their nation's founding. However, there is one part of the country where there have been no celebrations outside of military bases. Like Ethan Allen and Benedict Arnold in 1775, the Americans have recently invaded their northern neighbour. Unlike their Revolutionary War predecessors however, they have successfully annexed Canada, an ambition many thought Americans had long dropped. Despite attempts to encourage the locals to participate in the festivities and the insistence of [Root.GetLeader] that America has liberated their Canada brethren from British rule at last, responses have been muted in the North. Mayors of major Canadian cities have made reticent official statements acknowledging the holiday, however it is clear that it will be many years before the Fourth of July is celebrated in Canada, if ever. For now, resistance (violent and peaceful) continues. Still, as the fireworks go off in the sky, the people living in North America look to the future, whatever is in store for the Continent."

As America moves forward with reconstruction and dealing with the politics of this new socialist American order, Americans have been allowed a respite to celebrate Independence Day. Much has changed since 1936, before the war. Buildings have been levelled, roads destroyed, people have been killed, and countless displaced. There is no shortage of reasons to grieve. Yet, today seems to be so very similar to the way things were. Americans still gather together with their friends and family (or what's left of them) and celebrate the day with music and singing. Neighbours, once bitterly divided with one another, have begun to slowly reconcile today as they celebrate not only independence but peace between men. Because although there is much to be done, and no shortage of grief, America still remains an idealistic nation. As America turns the next page in its story, the people look forward to the promises the next day brings. And now, Independence Day reminds them that once again, Americans are one people."

Today, Americans are able to find respite from all the troubles as they celebrate Independence Day. Americans, young and old, gather together to celebrate Independence day with their friends and family (or what's left of them) with raucous celebrations decorated with conspicuous red, white and blue.

Although America continues to rebuild and fight through reconstruction, today Americans are able to take a rest and celebrate the founding of their great nation. Across the country, Americans celebrate Independence Day with bonfires and parades with their families and friends (or what's left of them).

And yet, today is a day of hope and optimism for the American people.

In some towns the night before, towns compete to stack pyramids of barrels and casks before lighting them in a giant bonfire. Neighbours, formerly divided by ideology and sympathies, have gradually started to celebrate with one another as the scars of war slowly heal.

Today though, as America toils with reconstruction, a glimmer of hope seemed to shine through to Americans at long last.\nOnce again, Americans meet with their families and friends (or what's left of them) to eat and play and watch fireworks.

Wearing his old Army uniform, the former Chief of Staff of the United States Army reflected upon the course of the war, his coming fate, and informed the audience that he would not resist arrest. Instead he said that he would accept imprisonment if it would bring the nation back together again without further bloodshed. He stated that he only did what he did in order to protect America, and was grateful for his many years in service as a \"fulfilment of his boyish hopes and dreams\".\n\nThough many in the audience clapped, critics have almost immediately lashed out, noting that MacArthur's coup helped trigger the civil war in the first place. Moreover, his speech seems to not only be a last ditch effort to gain pity (and possibly a pardon), but also appears to try taking credit for the reunification between the Pacific government and the Washington government, a success they argue is a credit to [Root.GetLeader] and diplomacy, not MacArthur.

Both sides, exhausted of the horrendous conflict that had torn apart a nation — have indicated to one another regarding a potential unification by compromise and not arms.\n\nGeneral Douglas MacArthur, the commander in chief of the Federal Army during the civil war, shocked the American continent when he announced his resignation from the presidency. The general publicly announced his appointment of senator John Nance Garner as his successor and his subsequent withdrawal from presidential affairs. While MacArthur's retirement made him appear as a modern-day American Cincinnatus in the eyes of his followers, to some Americans, MacArthur's moves were viewed with the highest of suspicions.\n\nNonetheless, it would appear that the Pacific States has completely subverted MacArthur's gambit. With the American nation waiting anxiously for news of the eventual reunification, the government of the Pacific States sent a strongly worded note to the Federal Government — demanding that MacArthur be tried for his crimes against the American people in exchange for unification. After all, it was MacArthur's military coup of the American government in the bleak winter of 1937 that threw the nation into anarchy. But perhaps most surprising is that the general's choice, newly appointed President John Garner, has been one of the most vocal voices calling for MacArthur's arrest. President Garner has taken to the national radio to denounce MacArthur as a Caesarean dictator, receiving praise and support from the Pacific Government. Politically outmanoeuvred and faced with a country desperate for peace, the former commander-in-chief has no choice but to comply with his arrest. "
 ustates.540.a: "Sic semper tyrannis."

 ustates.541.t: "The Presidential Succession Law"
 ustates.541.d: "In an ironic, perhaps fitting turn of event, the General who once deposed and imprisoned the President in a coup has now himself being arrested. With MacArthur now out of the way, the question looming in Washington is who should be President for the remainder of the 1936-1940 term. Constitutionally speaking, when the President dies or otherwise leaves office before the completion of their term, their Vice President takes up office. However, the Presidential Succession Law, passed by MacArthur's Congress at gunpoint allowed the General to \"legally\" become President and declared the sitting President and Vice President incapacitated or absent. This question has brought a new round of partisan bickering as Wendell Willkie, the deposed Vice President under Olson, and his supporters argue that he is the legitimate President of America and that the Pacific Government was a continuation of the Constitutional government throughout the civil war.\n\nFor many former Federalists however, this question cuts deep into the heart of the question of the legitimacy of the Washington government during the Civil War and many argue that Willkie's challenge threatens to destabilise the peace and reconciliation process. It would be better to instead allow for interim President [Root.GetLeader] to serve out the remainder of the term until new elections can be held. Thankfully, both sides have decided to resolve this question peacefully and it has quickly went before the Supreme Court. After hearing legal arguments from both sides, the court has announced its verdict that..."
 ustates.541.a: "...the Law was unconstitutional - Willkie is the rightful president."
 ustates.541.b: "...the Law was legitimate - [ROOT.GetLeader] is the rightful president."

 ustates.600.t: "Status of the US Army"
 ustates.600.d: "The defence of the United States has always been an uphill battle. Stretched thin against the vast breadth of the North American continent, the United States Army has had little chance to distinguish itself throughout its 160 year history. It won the bare minimum of victories to maintain American independence during the Revolution and the War of 1812. It performed admirably against a corrupt regime in the Mexican-American War but half of those forces would provide the seed for the fledgeling Confederate Army during the ensuing Civil War. More recently the Army performed barely adequately to subdue the heavily outgunned Spanish and struggled to suppress the half-starved Filipino Insurrection more than 30 years ago. Prevented from joining in the Weltkrieg on either side, it has suffered in both doctrine and technology, with very few tanks and a small Air Corps subsidiary to the ground forces. With the hobbled lion that was the British Empire on the northern frontier and a syndicalist stronghold poised in the south, the U.S. Army must be asked to defend the Republic from enemies within and without, and few agree that they are up to the task."
 ustates.600.a: "They'll have to suffice"

 ustates.601.t: "Status of the US Navy"
 ustates.601.d: "The United States Navy, long the darling child of the American defence establishment has been a strong force in global maritime affairs for nearly fifty years. A rival even to the vaunted Kaiserliche Marine and Royal Navy at their height in the Weltkrieg, it has defended America's shores and sallied forth to spread stability and democracy for nigh on 160 years. From John Paul Jones' raid on the British mainland to the Battle of Manila Bay, the Navy has provided the security needed by the republic from those that would infringe upon our independence from beyond the seas. All is not well in the modern day, however. The navy's ships are old, her flagships Weltkrieg-era dreadnoughts even as Germany and the Syndicalists engage in a new naval arms race, and the tattered remnants of the Royal Navy lick their wounds. The new dreadnoughts have been commissioned at the suggestion of senator Benjamin Tillman, along with many projects of the twenties converted to aircraft carriers due to the Great Depression, but the Navy is nowhere near ready to take on the imperial Japanese fleet. The Marine Corps fares better, hardened as they are by constant action in tropical locales, but they are small, only a few regiments strong, and are powerless to affect increasing tension at home from their far-flung island bases. The honour guard in Washington, D.C. look increasingly powerless as violence in the nation's capital increases. Our White ships might dominate the waves but many question whether it will be enough to face the gathering storm on the horizon."
 ustates.601.a: "Semper Fortis?"

 ustates.602.t: "Army Doctrinal Debate"
 ustates.602.d: "With the Outbreak of the American Civil War, the Army High Command has been thrown into chaos. Now not only is a reform plan to deal with the imminent crisis necessary, but also urgent as the rebellious states threaten the unity of America. Luckily for us, several staff members had already been advocating for reform plans since the early 1920s, and they have been summoned by High Command to a meeting for them to lay out their plans. After a session full of army formalities, 4-Star General Malin Craig presented a restructuring and mobilisation plan which would focus on trying to arm as many men as possible while improving and enhancing the High Command to have an edge in planning over our enemies. While many conservative members applauded his traditionalist stance, Major General Adna R. Chaffee criticised his stance, quoting several instances in which planning and mass mobilisation didn't earn the victory to the French in the Weltkrieg, and instead advocating for the adoption of the \"Thunderbolt\": Fast moving armies supporting themselves on motorised and mechanised elements to quickly exploit enemy weak spots. While both sides got gridlocked into a discussion for radically different plans, Major General Lesley McNair offered an alternative solution: The American strength lies with its industry, and it is clear that in order to win, that strength should be exploited to its fullest. For that he proposes the restoration of the late 1920s and early 1930s artillery examination boards and the development of anti air and anti tank batteries to counter-act any enemy developments on this front. After hours of discussion, a decision is made..."
 ustates.602.a: "Chaffee wins the debate"
 ustates.602.b: "McNair convinces his Superiors"
 ustates.602.c: "Craig sways the High Command"

 ustates.603.t: "Air Force Independence Debate"
 ustates.603.d: "The Air Force has remained as a mostly token part of the Army, with barely any investment going towards it during the 1920s and 1930s. However, air developments during these last decades have proven that a strong air force is a vital asset for an army who wishes to come out victorious from the battlefield. Unfortunately, the Army High Command in many aspects refuses to acknowledge this, and as a result, sparks conflict with many Air Branch generals who wish to direct the development of their own branch. With the country's integrity at stake, the High Command has decided to negotiate with the Air Force Generals, and the result of the negotiations is pretty clear: The Air Branch will not stand for a continuation of the Status Quo, and demands that at best, their force is given significant autonomy from the Army and reorganise as the United States Army Air Force, and at worse for the United States Army Air Corps to be expanded and supported to suit the needs of the battlefield. With the High Command being undecided on the issue, the final decision has been sent to the War Department, where it has been forwarded to the Secretary of Defense to decide on the matter."
 ustates.603.a: "Expand the USAAC"
 ustates.603.b: "Form the USAAF"

 ustates.604.t: "Adna R. Chaffee Dies"
 ustates.604.d: "After months of struggle in the hospital, Major General Adna R. Chaffee has unfortunately passed away due to cancer. Considered by many as the father of American Armored Corps, the mentor of many tank crews and officers and one of the main reformers of the US Army, his death has taken most of the High Command by surprise. Luckily, he had laid out his plans to High Command clearly, so while his death is a tragic turn of events, it won't hinder our army reforms."
 ustates.604.a: "His Expertise will be missed Nonetheless"

 ustates.605.t: "Tank Competition"
 ustates.605.d: "While our tanks in the assembly line have proven useful, Chaffee considers that their role is too spread for them to be effective. Right now our tanks are too slow to be used to take advantage of breakthroughs, but not armoured enough to sustain anti-tank projectiles, let alone tank-to-tank combat. Since achieving both is simply unachievable with the current state of our nation, we can however focus on one aspect so that our tanks may serve a specific role."
 ustates.605.a: "Striking Fast is our Priority"
 ustates.605.b: "Striking Hard is our Priority"

 ustates.606.t: "Seizure of Civilian Trucks"
 ustates.606.d: "After Chaffee announced his Motorisation program for the Army, a proposal was sent to the Secretary of Defense by the War Department to decide on the requisition of civilian vehicles in order to supply our fast-growing army. With his approval, we have begun seizing vehicles from the civilian populace, although to our surprise, some proud patriots line up next to our storages to volunteer their vehicles for the incoming fight. While not all their vehicles have proven to be useful for us, we have managed to requisition a fair amount of trucks which can either be modified to transport troops with ease or which are sturdy enough to transport our troops at once."
 ustates.606.a: "We thank you for your service"

 ustates.607.t: "Production Prioritisation"
 ustates.607.d: "As the American industry hums along McNair's artillery designs, a new debacle has begun among members of the High Command. Front Line reports of complete squads being wiped out by enemy dive bombings have been a concern of the staff since the beginning of the American Civil War, but the quick development of armoured elements in the enemy forces are overwhelming our army of mostly barely-equipped grunts. After asking for extra resources to the War Department, extra investments have been authorised for the Army, but they'd need to be addressed to a particular type of countermeasures against the enemy tactics, and so the High Command must choose wisely what it shall invest it in..."
 ustates.607.a: "Anti Tank Guns are vital"
 ustates.607.b: "Anti Air Guns are more important"

 ustates.608.t: "First Paradrop Exercise"
 ustates.608.d: "While technically speaking, the first paradropping exercises were practised in 1930 with biplanes dropping machine gun squads, today a major breakthrough has been achieved in the airborne department. After finishing a rigorous conditioning and training programme started two weeks ago, a lottery was made to decide the jumping order of the experimental paradropping platoon made up of volunteers. When the Douglas C-33 took off from Langley Airfield and finally was put into position to start the experiment, Second Lieutenant William T. Ryder became the first American Paratrooper after making his jump and landing near Fort Benning. The second man, however, refused to jump, and so the first enlisted man to become a paratrooper was Pvt. William N. \"Red\" King, and then the remaining 8 platoon members in the aircraft. After their touchdown, they quickly reached the rendezvous point and completed their exercise goals, making the experiment a success."
 ustates.608.a: "Start Scheduling New Jumps"

 ustates.609.t: "Formation of the First Paratrooper Divisions"
 ustates.609.d: "With the success of our scheduled mass jumps and with the blessing of General John C.H. Lee, the recently reopened Fort Eustis had begun taking volunteers for paratrooper units. While originally the high training standards and relatively high mortal risk initially caused few volunteers to show up, the high command authorised a triplication of the paratrooper wage as opposed to the foot soldier wage. Soon enough, the 501st Parachute Battalion was formed, quickly followed by other battalions and regiments. After a week recruitment, the number of volunteers was enough to form 5 paratrooper divisions for us to utilise. While these divisions still lack combat experience, this breakthrough in Airborne tactics should not be underestimated, and the High Command is looking forward to seeing their investment in these divisions pay off."
 ustates.609.a: "'Death from Above'"

 ustates.610.t: "Conservative Army Elements complain about the Creation of the USAAF"
 ustates.610.d: "With the decision from the Secretary of Defense to form the US Army Air Force, which in consequence granted huge autonomy to the Air Force Officers, many officers have spoken out against the reform. One of the main points of contention is that, with the budget already pretty split between the Army and the Navy, the Army Air Force will now more than ever be a money sink that would be badly needed for the ground troops. Regardless of their heated complain letters to the war department, the decision has been made and reforms are ongoing, so there's no going back."
 ustates.610.a: "They'll have to Learn to Respect each other"

 ustates.611.t: "MacArthur Attacks the Navy"
 ustates.611.d: "With more and more government funding being diverted to the navy, Chief of Staff MacArthur has taken up a severe accusation to the Secretary of Defense: He believes the recent investments on the navy are part of a plot that he had discovered in the early 1930s where the Navy would dominate the Army in the field and just turn the Army into a subordinate garrison force. While the Secretary has managed to calm the General down and reassure him that the army's role in the battlefield will always come first, word of the meeting has gone out and many Admirals, including MacArthur's bitter rival Admiral Hart, are already sending letters asking for MacArthur's resignation. While the relations between MacArthur and navy have been bad for years, this is yet another sad example of how the inter-service rivalry has done nothing but grow in the last few years."
 ustates.611.a: "What's wrong with them? We won't win battles by bickering!"

 ustates.612.t: "McNair Releases Antimechanized Defense Combat Manual"
 ustates.612.d: "After nearly a decade of studies and compiling the analysis of recent conflicts both at home and abroad, General Lesley McNair has finally published the book Antimechanized Defense, where he explores the recent development on mechanised tactics and how to counter them. The manual consists of seven chapters - the first titled \"General\" followed by six chapters describing employment of antitank units in various scenarios (during the advance, halts, the development of the battle, defensive manoeuvrers, retrograde movements, and offensive operations). The document highlights the specific capabilities of tanks that makes them a unique threat on a modern battlefield characterised by open warfare, like the tank's speed and mobility which, when combined with the lack of a stabilised front, increased the need to ensure protection of flanks and rear areas against armoured attacks. While officer trainees will loathe having another manual to read in the pile, this one is quickly turning into a must after the recent engagements."
 ustates.612.a: "Finally! A Book that will guide us to Victory!"

 ustates.613.t: "Chaffee Organises the Combat Commands"
 ustates.613.d: "The concept Chaffee first envisaged during his development mechanised tactics in the early 1930s was one where combined arms mechanised units would possess no formal structure. In order to present his idea more coherently to high command, he has recently written the \"Armored Force Tentative Table of Organisation\" where the Combat Command, as he describes it, should be flexible organisation that should not have dedicated battalions. Instead, tank, armoured infantry, and armoured field artillery battalions, as well as smaller units of tank destroyers, engineers, and mechanised cavalry have to be assigned as needed in order to accomplish any given mission. To achieve this, he wishes to split the armoured division into the combat commands named \"A\" for the main force, \"B\" for flank defence, and \"R\" for reserve units. While his concept is clearly inspired in the German \"Kampfgruppe\" concept, the High Command has received his idea with open arms and are starting to implement the new organisation system across the board as well as distributing the new manual to the field officers."
 ustates.613.a: "It seems that studying the Germans has paid off"

 ustates.614.t: "Release of the Joint Army/Navy Phonetic Alphabet"
 ustates.614.d: "One of the major lessons from the civil war was the need to enhance the speed and clarity of our communications on the front line while not making our movements and organisation system obvious to the enemy. In order to create a consistent naming system, the Army and Navy had designated a commission from the Signal Corps to work on a new radio alphabet system for our men to use, and we finally have the results from their efforts. With the publishing and distribution of the \"Joint Army/Navy Phonetic Alphabet\" manual, our new alphabet shall utilise the codewords: Able, Baker, Charlie, Dog, Easy, Fox, George, How, Item, Jig, King, Love, Mike, Nan, Oboe, Peter, Queen, Roger, Sugar, Tare, Uncle, Victor, William, X-ray, Yoke and Zebra. While similar radio systems have been developed for the Canadians and the Germans, the fact we have finally taken the task of standardising it means we're finally catching up with the lessons we missed in the Weltkrieg"
 ustates.614.a: "This will give us an Edge in Communications"

 ustates.615.t: "Adoption of the M1 Helmet"
 ustates.615.d: "Ever since the Weltkrieg proved that helmets were vital to protect the infantry from flying fragments of exploded ordnance, the American Army has utilised the British Mk I helmet designed by John L. Brodie, which gave it its current nickname. While adopted, the US never saw a need to mass produce it, and instead continued to buy the model from the British in the cheap during their depression in the early 1920s. While these helmets were effective at the time, our experience in the civil war has proven that even the Brodie is no longer suitable for modern combat and, as such, a research team was created under Major Harold G. Sydenham to look for alternatives. The research team concluded that by removing the Brodie's brim, by adding side pieces and earpiece, and by incorporating the suspension system into a separate inner liner, the new helmet could provide a protection the Brodie could never afford. The original test item was known as the TS3, and it received a favourable report from the Infantry Board in the recent weeks. With the approval of the War Department, it will soon enter mass production to supply our rapidly growing army."
 ustates.615.a: "Glad we finally got rid of the Brodies"

 ustates.616.t: "The Victory Book Campaign"
 ustates.616.d: "As thousands of new recruits flood into training camps across the country, community librarians have recognised an opportunity to lend their support to our government. Individual libraries sponsored book drives to donate to their local military bases. In the last few months, members of the American Library Association met to discuss a plan for a coordinated nationwide drive to supply the troops with free books. The ALA presented their idea to the United Service Organisations and The Red Cross, who have received their idea enthusiastically and begun setting up more than four hundred recreational clubs on the outskirts of military camps. The Red Cross wanted books to send to military hospitals, remote camps with no libraries, their overseas clubs, and prisoners of war. The two organisations decided to split the project's funding, while the ALA provided technical know-how and both began campaigning for government approval. While our military is reluctant of accepting donated books, there is a real need for entertainment for our soldiers in the field and Army high command decided to give its approval to the project."
 ustates.616.a: "Let's hope our soldiers enjoy it"

 ustates.617.t: "Cancellation of the Victory Book Campaign"
 ustates.617.d: "While the Victory Book Campaign has paved the way for institutions like the Council on Books in Wartime and the War Book Panel, the Campaign itself is beginning to draw criticism from the Army. Unfortunately, the Campaign was not well suited for combat units, as soldiers found the bulky hardcovers unsuitable for use in the field. Many of the books donated were deemed unfitting by the revision committees. Of the over 10 million books gathered last year, VBC staffers have discarded over half of them. While the goal of the VBC is still popular, the Army has ordered the VBC to close and has begun plans with the CBW to create a new programme to entertain our soldiers."
 ustates.617.a: "Something Ends, Something Begins"

 ustates.618.t: "Creation of the Armed Services Editions"
 ustates.618.d: "With the collaboration of the graphic artist H. Stanley Thompson and the publisher and CWB executive Malcolm Johnson, Army Chief Librarian Raymond Trautman proposed his idea of \"Armed Services Editions\": mass-produced paperbacks selected by a panel of literary experts from among classics, bestsellers, humour books and poetry. With the support of the Navy Chief Librarian Isabel DuBois, the project managed to reach the Army High Command. While the proposal was sound, a clause in Trautmant's proposal sparked controversy in the High Command Meeting. As he stated that all books should be, in all circumstances, acceptable to both services, and that works with \"Statements or attitudes offensive to our Allies, any religious or racial group, or not in accord 'with the spirit of American democracy'\" should be discarded. Regardless of the controversy that it caused, the Army and Navy high command have agreed to give the project the green light, with both branches offering their own printing presses and the funding to expand printing further if necessary."
 ustates.618.a: "Let's hope this time the Books Last"

 ustates.619.t: "Creation of a Sniper Program?"
 ustates.619.d: "With the harsh lessons in urban warfare we have been forced to learn, we've come to realise that our army is woefully unprepared to face a new danger of the battlefield: Enemy Snipers. While Snipers proved their usefulness during the Weltkrieg, the Army high command had never seen any reason to expand upon it as it was seen as a situational solution for the battlefields of Europe. However, fighting in the American mountains, cities and forests has proved that not only they were wrong, but also costed us dearly, as we lack the means to counter-act enemy sniper operations, let alone send off snipers of our own to eliminate High Value Targets. As such, a proposal has reached High Command to kickstart one similar to the Sniper training that Canada put their snipers through in the Weltkrieg."
 ustates.619.a: "The Proposal Passes"
 ustates.619.b: "The Proposal is Shut Down"

 ustates.620.t: "Sniper Selection"
 ustates.620.d: "With the first test group of snipers having left basic training, the question has been brought up. While the first test group was drawn from volunteers from all the US Army, there has been a significant performance difference between the Marine and Ranger volunteers compared to the regular army volunteers. As such, both branches are contesting for the funding of the War Department to continue the Sniper Program, and we can only pick one. Which branch shall we support?"
 ustates.620.a: "Favour the Army's Rangers"
 ustates.620.b: "Favour the Navy's Marines"

 ustates.621.t: "Creation of the Office for Emergency Management"
 ustates.621.d: "With the outbreak of the civil war, the President has dispatched the creation via executive order of an office that functioned to assist the President in clearing information on immediate defence measures. With it, the Office for Emergency Management has been born to maintain liaison with national defence agencies and to coordinate the national defence programme, as well as keep both the Army and Navy in direct contact with the President. However, the mess of agencies, offices and commissions we have generated in the last few decades continues to grow, and many agree that our government should start looking into ways of reducing the amount of offices and increase the efficiency of existing ones."
 ustates.621.a: "For now, this will do"

 ustates.622.t: "Creation of the United States Office of War Information"
 ustates.622.d: "Due to a lack of a centralised government agency to work as a distributor of wartime information, civilian newspapers present news as they discover and interpret it, with different outlets overlapping their stories with slight variations and the public hardly knowing what is true and what is propaganda. As such, and with permission of both the War Department and the President, the Office of War Information has been created to work as a connection between the battlefront and civilian communities. While many independent news outlets have expressed their concerns over a centralised agency becoming the sole distributor of wartime information, most experts agree that this is a necessary move."
 ustates.622.a: "They have nothing to fear, we shall spread only the truth!"

 ustates.623.t: "Changing the USAAC Roundel?"
 ustates.623.d: "With the outbreak of the American Civil War, the issue has been brought up that our air planes share the same air force patch as our enemies. While radio communication has allowed us so far to distinguish between friend and foe, reports of friendly fire and unexpected enemy attacks abound, and the Air Force officers have come with a proposal to change our roundel from the star symbol within a blue circle with a red dot in the middle to a different roundel so our anti air units may better differentiate our planes from the enemy's. What should we do?"
 ustates.623.a: "Let the enemy change it! This roundel is ours"
 ustates.623.b: "Change it"

 ustates.625.t: "The War Department Relocates to the Main Navy and Munitions Buildings"
 ustates.625.d: "With the Department of State leaving almost no room for the War Department to grow near the White House, the Secretary of War has authorised the War Department to move to a different location. It is to be to an ammunition warehouse provided by the navy. However, the warehouse is still too small the hold the ever growing War Department, with a new wing having been ordered to be constructed to accommodate newly employed staff. We estimate that we will need a larger structure to consolidate the 24.000 workers in offices scattered among 17 separate sites, as well as a possible additional 10.000 or more new workers that we are planning to include soon as our nation falls into conflict."
 ustates.625.a: "'Tell the president we need more space!'"

 ustates.626.t: "McNair's Report on the State of the Army"
 ustates.626.d: "Under the High Command's orders, General McNair has compiled a report of all the major flaws our army possesses at the moment that we will need to solve if we wish to prevail against our enemies in the civil war. The major summary sent to the War Department lists the following issues:\n\n1. Obviously deficient training of small units and in minor tactics.\n2. Faulty employment of the infantry division and of its combat teams.\n3. Failure fully to appreciate the purpose of motor vehicles and exploit their capabilities.\n4. Inadequate reconnaissance and lack of contact between adjacent units.\n5. Inadequate support of infantry by division artillery.\n6. Faulty signal communications.\n7. Too passive employment of antitank guns.\n8. Improper employment of horse cavalry.\n9. Neglect of ammunition supply and evacuation of wounded.\n10. Unreal situations due to faulty umpiring.\n\nIn the same manner, other issues have been brought up by other officers in which they include shortages of qualified staff officers and commanders to fill all the staff roles and deficiencies in individual training that would delay the effectiveness of unit training."
 ustates.626.a: "We have to reform if we wish to prevail"

 ustates.627.t: "Construction of \"The Pentagon\""
 ustates.627.d: "With the shortcomings of the Main Navy and Munitions Buildings, the search for a more fitting permanent office space for the War Department has been ongoing for months already. First the military turned to the head of the Army's Construction Division, Brig. Gen. Brehon Burke Somervell. He, in turn, tasked the chief of the design section, Lt. Col. Hugh J. Casey, to come up with a building that would fit a five-sided parcel of land that had been hastily purchased just below Arlington National Cemetery on the Virginia side of the Potomac River, which would house all the War Department's components. Originally the building was meant to be placed in a location known as the Arlington Farms, where the road shape resembles a Pentagon, which has forced the architect team to adapt the design to said geographic space. Many in the Department, however are questioning if positioning the building between the cemetery, which by all means is considered hallowed ground for every American, and the stunning view of Washington, D.C. is really appropriate, and two new locations have been proposed for the construction. Unfortunately, the requests for the materials have already been designed to accommodate a pentagonal shape, so even if we were to change the building location, the building will still be made in that shape, but we still need to decide where should the Pentagon be."

 ustates.628.t: "War Department Moves into the Pentagon"
 ustates.628.d: "While the construction of the Pentagon is still ongoing, the War Department has decided to move to the incomplete building, so as to not have to share space with the Navy staff anymore. Even though the building isn't even yet complete, a new expansion of the now lovingly called \"Pentagon\" has already been authorised, and of the 5 wings, the 3 remaining ones to be built shall have bigger offices to accommodate the War Department's staff."
 ustates.628.a: "Let's hope this is the last Expansion"

 ustates.629.t: "Pentagon is Finished"
 ustates.629.d: "With the final wing finally finished, the War Department has finally found its own home and the building now sports a reinforced concrete structure, using 680,000 tons of sand dredged from the Potomac River and Indiana limestone for the building's façade. It occupies 28.7 acres (116,000 m2), and includes an additional 5.1 acres (21,000 m2) as a central courtyard, with the hallways being so large that messengers are being issued with roller skates and bikes to speed up messaging between offices."

 ustates.650.AUS_default: "With the civil war now over, and our enemies at our mercy, the Army has finally begun the trials against the Federalist generals. While some generals have fled into exile, the generals who were caught are now waiting for the verdict of the military tribunal. However, despite what the public believes, it's not as easy to carry out the trials as it was originally anticipated. Most trialled generals don't have any particular record of unnecessary violence, and even those that do can still claim they were following orders. Among them, the most controversial one so far is Dwight Eisenhower. While Fox Conner appeals to his innocence, there's no denying that in America's darkest hour, he and many others who followed him ended up on the wrong side of history out of their own volition. While some of the captured generals have sworn to quit even if forgiven, there are other men who have pledged to defend the new America if they are forgiven, so long as we commit to defending the ideals America stands for, but in the end, the final decision rests with the jury..."

### Foreign Policy

 ustates.655.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Joins Our War"
 ustates.655.d: "While the foreign invasion of our territory has caused understandable consternation to both our government and people, we are joined in our concern by our southern neighbour. Although Anglo-Saxon ties have waned since the turn of the century, and the Monroe Doctrine is not what it once was, [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] is in no wise prepared to let their northern border become a hostile one. Accordingly, they have given our syndicalist enemies an ultimatum - end all hostilities with the British Empire and her allies, or face war with [FROM.GetNameDef]. The syndicalist warmongers have naturally refused, and as such we are now co-belligerents with [FROM.GetName]."
 ustates.655.a: "Marvellous!"

 ustates.656.t: "War in the North"
 ustates.656.d: "When John Quincy Adams drafted the Monroe Doctrine in 1823, he was fearful of renewed monarchical imperialism in Latin America by the Holy Alliance. Now, however, North America faces a totally different threat - revolutionary leftism. Syndicalist troops have landed on Canadian shores, and many worry they will soon be landing on ours, whatever course of action we take now. In an effort to forestall this, and to re-assert some of our lost authority in the Western Hemisphere, we have given the syndicalists twelve hours to end all hostilities with the British Empire. [INT.GetName] has refused immediately - even going so far as to raid our embassy in their capital - thereby forcing the might of America to stand with their Anglophone brethren in a war for our very survival."
 ustates.656.a: "Canada must not fall to the Red Menace!"

 ustates.657.t: "The Americans Intervene on Our Side"
 ustates.657.d: "The Americans have long held dominion over the Western Hemisphere, and while that was shaken during their civil war the Americans have not forgotten their pledge to protect the free nations of the Americas. With the recent syndicalist invasion of Canada itself, the Americans have entered the war on our side. While they remain unwilling to join our alliance formally, they will doubtless still be a powerful friend."
 ustates.657.a: "Excellent!"

 ustates.658.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Delivers Ultimatum"
 ustates.658.d: "The Americans have long held dominion over the Western Hemisphere, forcing the nations of Central and South America to follow their lead and do their bidding. Now that our liberation of Canada has finally commenced, the [FROM.GetAdjective] ambassador has informed the [INT.GetAdjective] government that they have twelve hours to abandon their invasion of Canada. It was immediately refused, and accordingly the Americans have declared war on [INT.GetName], which has called all its allies into the conflict. We are now at war with America."
 ustates.658.a: "Then we shall defeat them, too."

 ustates.660.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Demands the Panama Canal"
 ustates.660.d: "With the civil war now over, [From.GetNameDef] has decided to ask for the return of the Panama Canal. We had seized it to protect our interests, but with [From.GetNameDef]'s victory in the civil war, they - as the claimant to American legitimacy - are asking for the Panama Canal to be returned. Their ambassador has stressed that war is rather likely if we refuse. What shall our response be?"
 ustates.660.a: "We shall return it"
 ustates.660.b: "We shall not return it"

 ustates.661.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Returns the Canal"
 ustates.661.d: "[From.GetNameDefCap] has returned the Panama Canal back to [Root.GetNameDef]."
 ustates.661.a: "God Bless America."

 ustates.662.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Refuses"
 ustates.662.d: "[From.GetNameDefCap] has refused to return the Canal to us, what shall our position be?"
 ustates.662.a: "Let's not risk war."
 ustates.662.b: "War it shall be."

 ustates.1000.d.all: "To those not in the know, it might seem like the crisis in the United States came out of nowhere, but experts agree that this was a civil war years in making. Since the collapse of the New York Stock Exchange in 1925 the economy of the United States has been sluggish and mired in deep recession.\n\nNow, the United States has collapsed into an all-out civil war between the supporters of the Federal Government, the Combined Syndicates of America, the right-wing American Union State, and the remnants of democratic rule in the Pacific States of America. Volunteers are pouring in from around the world to support one faction or another, with some characterising the bitter ideological conflict as simply part of a wider global clash of ideals."

 ustates.1001.t: "Floyd Olson Elected President of the USA"
 ustates.1001.d: "A dark horse candidate in an age on uncertainty, it appears that Floyd Olson has carried the Farmer-Labor Ticket to its first national election victory in US history. The Farmer-Labor platform Olson campaigned on drew unprecedented allies from both Democrats and Republicans seeking an alternative to the populists and partisan hacks that they saw as tearing apart the nation.\n\nReinvigorated with the news that his stomach cancer is in remission, Olson boldly strides into the White House amidst protests from both the socialists and hard liners with the promise of fixing the economy, restoring national brotherhood, and preventing political violence by any means necessary."
 ustates.1001.a: "We'll be watching your progress."
 ustates.1001.b: "A carefully brokered coalition is an easily broken coalition."
 ustates.1001.c: "How could this possibly work out in their favour?"

 ustates.1002.t: "Huey Long Elected President of the USA"
 ustates.1002.d: "Despite the massive instability rampant in the nation ever since the Great Depression in 1925, the Presidential elections went forward, and the voting results are clear - Huey Long of the America First Union Party is the 31st President of the United States.\n\nHuey Long is famous for his successful Governorship of Louisiana, but he has received a lot of criticism for his populist policies and the usage of Minutemen paramilitaries to combat political rivals. The Socialist Party of America contest the election results, too, calling them rigged."
 ustates.1002.a: "Big promises, but can he live up to them?"
 ustates.1002.b: "Perhaps what America needs is a man of decisive action."
 ustates.1002.c: "An old reactionary tale: promise everything and do nothing."

 ustates.1003.t: "Jack Reed Elected President of the USA"
 ustates.1003.d: "Despite the massive instability rampant in the nation ever since the Great Depression in 1925, the Presidential elections went forward, and the voting results are clear - Jack Reed of the Socialist Party of America is the 31st President of the United States.\n\nJack Reed turned into a savvy political operator during his time in Russia, and is a dedicated proponent of Syndicalism. This stance has made him many enemies in the American society, but the association of trade unions that he leads remains strong. The AFP already contests the election results, though..."
 ustates.1003.a: "The revolution spreads further. Has it reached its prime target?"
 ustates.1003.b: "I give it a couple months before he drives the country into ruin."
 ustates.1003.c: "Send our congratulations to Washington!"

 ustates.1004.t: "The End of the American Civil War"
 ustates.1004.d: "The Second American Civil War, the bloodiest conflict to ever descend on the New World, is over. And as sobbing widows bury their dead husbands and sons the old regime of the United States of America has re-established itself across the 48 States. Martial law is being removed across the nation, and the last rebel holdouts are being taken care of by the National Guard.\n\nEven though the United States has won, the loss that it had to endure will change the face of the nation forever. Most major cities are heavily damaged, hundreds of thousands are dead or injured, and the carefree, open mentality of the American people has taken a drastic blow..."
 ustates.1004.a: "What effect will this have on the\nAmerican Dream?"
 ustates.1004.b: "How depressing — so many died for no real change at all."

 ustates.1005.t: "The End of the American Civil War"
 ustates.1005.d: "The Second American Civil War, the bloodiest conflict to ever descend on the New World, is over. And as sobbing widows bury their dead husbands and sons the old USA regime has been replaced by a reactionary military dictatorship that has vanquished all rivals. General Douglas MacArthur has issued a nationwide crackdown on all possible enemies of the state and underground CSA and AUS successors, and the nation is slowly starting to rebuild.\n\nWill the United States return to democracy or will the legacy of the Founding Fathers be crushed under the Leader's boot? Only time will tell, but this war will be etched into the consciousness of the American people forever..."
 ustates.1005.a: "What effect will this have on the\nAmerican Dream?"
 ustates.1005.b: "How depressing — so many died for no real change at all."

 ustates.1006.t: "The End of the American Civil War"
 ustates.1006.d: "The Second American Civil War, the bloodiest conflict to ever descend on the New World, is over. And as sobbing widows bury their dead husbands and sons the old regime falls, and the conservative and reactionary American Union State raises its flag above Washington. Reconstruction processes are being enacted, and President Huey Long has declared the end of the war a national holiday.\n\nThe United States, thought to be the bastion of democracy, has fallen. What does the future hold for the new Southerner dictatorship? Only time will tell, but this war will be etched into the consciousness of the American people forever..."
 ustates.1006.a: "The South won this time..."
 ustates.1006.b: "Easily the worst possible outcome."

 ustates.1008.d: "The Second American Civil War, the bloodiest conflict to ever descend on the New World, is over. And as sobbing widows bury their dead husbands and sons the last traces of the old regime are being swept away by the American Revolution, headed by the Combined Syndicates of America. The old capitalist system is being dissolved and replaced with an organisation similar to that of France and Britain, and the red-black banner now flies over the former Congress, soon to be converted to the Congress of the Syndicates.\n\nThe CSA has already strained its relations with Canada, and it already looks forward to becoming the vanguard of Syndicalism in the New World. America - it has changed, forever..."
 ustates.1008.a: "America thrives on freedom, not socialism!"
 ustates.1008.b: "What was once a nightmare has now become reality."
 ustates.1008.c: "An unimaginable victory for the workers of America — and of the world."

 ustates.1009.t: "John N. Garner Elected President of the USA"
 ustates.1009.d: "Despite the massive instability rampant in the nation ever since the Great Depression in 1925, the Presidential elections went forward, and the voting results are clear - the Democratic candidate John Nance Garner is the 31st President of the United States.\n\nGarner was defeated in the 1932 Democratic primary, but he has returned with a campaign focused of defending democracy and fighting both the CSA and AFP, even with brute force in consideration. This stance has alarmed the left and right with radicals in the US, and the Union's political crisis might turn even worse..."
 ustates.1009.a: "We'll see what happens."
 ustates.1009.b: "I highly doubt Garner can fix America."
 ustates.1009.c: "The establishment broke America, and now they trust them to fix it?"

 ustates.1010.t: "Alf Landon Elected President of the USA"
 ustates.1010.d: "When Herbert Hoover put his complete trust in former Oil Lobbyist and Senator Alf Landon in fixing the United States, Alf graciously accepted. In an inaugural address fraught with threats of violence from both Socialist and Longist rebels, Landon promised America that she would retain her status as a world economic power and symbol of a liberal democracy at any cost.\n\nLandon's supporter base is made up of the struggling middle class Americans and the extensive Republican allies that have been in power for decades in the United States. Although from the crowd both socialists and Longists call him a tool of Big Business, boding further division in the United States."
 ustates.1010.a: "We'll see what happens."
 ustates.1010.b: "I highly doubt Landon can fix America."
 ustates.1010.c: "Seriously? This is the man they elected to heal America's wounds?"

 ustates.1011.t: "President Huey Long Disappears"
 ustates.1011.d: "In an unprecedented turn of events, the victorious US President Huey Long has gone missing. American newspapers report that Huey Long's car and all of his bodyguards disappeared after a late night dinner in the new capital city. From what we can gather from the papers, an unidentified group of professional syndicalist assassins were behind this attack. This comes after the high profile slaying of industrialist Henry Ford's son, Edsel Ford, by an anarchist.\n\nAmerican Legion commander George Van Horn Moseley addressed the public's concerns, saying that he will occupy the Presidential Mansion in order to uproot any potential conspirators and has mobilised the Legion to defend venerable Congressmen in this dangerous time."
 ustates.1011.a: "The reactionaries are tearing themselves apart!"
 ustates.1011.b: "How dreadful!"
 ustates.1011.c: "Will anything really change?"

 ustates.1012.t: "President Huey Long Found Dead!"
 ustates.1012.d: "In a shocking turn of events, the once triumphant US President Huey Long was found murdered in his residence! American newspapers all across the nation denounce the murderous attack on the leader of the nation. Most troubling of all was the hood left behind by the hitmen claiming responsibility for the assault.\n\nAmerican Legion commander Robert Wood made a public address to the nation that he would personally lead the fight against Hiram Evans and his band of brigands. Raised up to take Long's place is the former congressmen Martin Dies Jr, a staunch conservative and defender of the old order who has promised swift retribution on those who seek and have sought to destabilise America."
 ustates.1012.a: "One tyrant dies, another takes its place."
 ustates.1012.b: "The American president, assassinated by the Klan? A troubling thought."

 USA_floyd_olson_leader_desc: "§YBorn:§! §LNovember 13th, 1891, in Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States of America§!\n§YBackground:§! §LFloyd B. Olson was never supposed to become President of the United States. Born to a Norwegian father and a Swedish mother, Olson grew up serving as a shabbos goy for the local Jewish community on the north side of Minneapolis, then briefly working for the Northern Pacific Railway. This was before dropping out of university and heading west to work odd jobs in Canada and Alaska, and then Seattle where he joined the Industrial Workers of the World for a time, picking up a quasi-socialist ideology he would hold throughout his life. In 1913 he returned to Minnesota to study law, and became the Hennepin Country attorney by 1920. He became known as a tough prosecutor, taking on corrupt businessmen, the Ku Klux Klan, and the conservative Minnesota Citizens Alliance after the latter hired a hitman to blow up the home of a union leader. During this time, Olson aligned as a Progressive, a Democrat, and eventually as a Farmer-Labor nominee - and was rewarded when he became that party's first governor of Minnesota.\n\nThe fact that the Republican and Democratic establishment felt it necessary to put such a radical candidate at the head of their unity ticket is a stark sign of desperation - the Socialist Party of America was regretfully determined to be the biggest danger, and Olson's candidacy was aimed to convince SPA voters to once again bet on reform. This was not a decision easily made, however - as Olson stands as the only man that might talk down the syndicalists, some conservative Democrats wonder if they made the wrong choice, and it's possible that they may throw their hat in with America First if Olson is seen as selling out to socialism.\n\nOlson's diagnosis with stomach cancer only underscores the pressure: however assured that he's in good health, it adds to the sense that time is running out - and that the stakes could not be higher.§!"

His father, a Zouave during the war, was the owner of a small trucking firm, but passed away during Alfred's youth. Forced to drop out of parochial school, Smith worked at a fish market to make ends meet during the height of the Gilded Age and never attended high school. Nonetheless, between his experience \"studying people\" at the fish market and some experience acting at a local theatre circuit, \"Al\" Smith developed proficient speaking skills and a solid Catholic, Irish identity.\n\nWith his working class credentials, Al Smith became a champion of immigrants in New York, fighting for Progressive Reforms. Despite his close association with the Tammany Hall political machine, Smith himself avoided engaging in any personal corruption as he rose through the ranks, finally being elected Governor of New York in 1919 after delivering a stunning rebuke to Hearst as \"a man as low and mean as I can picture\". Throughout his tenure, he fought for civil service reform and workers' protections, and his ambitions soon turned to national politics. Smith would unsuccessfully seek the Democratic nomination for President in 1924 and 1928, rejected in part because of his Catholic faith.\n\nAfter an unsuccessful 1928 bid, Smith became a board member of Empire State Inc. and three years later the Empire State building would open in 1931. The skyscraper would not be the only one to reach for the skies however: as the political winds changed so did Al Smith's fortunes. Tapped in 1936 to be John Garner's running mate in the 1936 elections, Smith's political fortunes were suddenly revived. One way or another, he has now become President of the United States, a lifelong dream. It is now up to America's first Catholic President to live up to his working class ideals and bring about positive change to the nation.§!"

Hoover ran on a fairly optimistic platform of increasing public infrastructure projects and attempting to unify the country under a moderate government. He and Charles Curtis easily won the 1928 elections, but soon found his platform stalled by the realities of the increasingly polarised American electorate. As the Great Depression and the fingerpointing only grew worse, Hoover narrowly won the 1932 elections after the election went to the House to decide.\n\nThroughout his tenure, Hoover has worked to stabilise the situation the best he could. In the political realm, he has wrangled with Congressional Democrats on legislation to solve the Great Depression, to middling success. The worsening situation has pushed to look to other, less savoury measures as well. He has discreetly asked military planners to continually revise War Plan White to prepare contingencies for ‘severe domestic turmoil' and elevated the stature of one General Douglas MacArthur, a rising star among certain nervous establishment circles.\n\nAs a restless 1936 dawns, all eyes are on the White House to see what happens next. While a few see his position as that of just another lame duck, Hoover knows the decisions he makes in his final year may very well alter the course of the nation. Over sleepless nights and countless phone-calls, Hoover's actions (or lack thereof) will decide America's fate and that of his legacy...§!"

Raised in Marietta, Ohio, and finally studying and settling down in Kansas, Landon eventually acquired substantial personal wealth as an oil producer, and became a major figure of the national oil lobby - a group attacked by both the left and right. A supporter of Teddy Roosevelt's Progressive Party and his 1912 election bid, Landon eventually became the leader of the Kansas liberal Republican caucus. In 1932, he was elected as the Kansas state governor in an exceptionally tight race, and narrowly won re-election 2 years later, building a reputation as a soft-spoken reformist Republican in a time where they are becoming an increasingly rare sight.\n\nLandon was backed by the Republican party machinery as a centrist in a polarised political field dominated by loud personalities and radicalism. Most commentators believed the Republican Party to be on its deathbed, and wrote off Landon and his subdued campaign: the candidate travelled little and left much to his campaigners. And yet, in what will likely be considered one of the greatest upsets in American history, Landon outpaced both the Democrats and the radicals and won the election after a House decision - perhaps he was seen as the only sane man in a field of madness? Whatever the reason, the President carries a unique political legacy, a man who is fiscally conservative yet receptive to government intervention; a figure of business interests who is still a supporter of labour unions.\n\nFor the second time, a Republican stands before a house deeply divided - and President Landon has some very large shoes to fill.§!"

He continued to stand out when he opposed Democrats to push for a bank holiday when the Great Depression hit. This support for financial institutions and his assertions that government aid should not interfere with market competition made him a possible pick for Democrat John Garner's running mate in 1936, and he served well during the 1936 campaign and afterwards.

He followed his father into a career in law, being admitted to the Ohio bar in 1913 with the best test scores in the state. Dedicating the next few years to his legal practice, Taft served a brief stint in Washington as part of the legal staff for the Food and Drug Administration where he met his idol, Herbert Hoover. While in Washington, Taft grew to despise government inefficiency, an attitude he carried into the Ohio House of Representatives in 1920. His time in Ohio saw him become a leading figure of the Ohio Republican Party's conservative faction and a vigorous opponent of the Ku Klux Klan, famously voting against a Klan-sponsored bill to ban dancing on Sundays and opposing another bill requiring Ohio public schools to read ten Bible verses daily. Throughout his career, Taft has ardently championed the superiority of private initiative over nearly every sphere, and became one of the greatest enemies of Ohio's socialists.\n\nDespite his lacklustre speaking ability, Taft's local notoriety and status as head of the political dynasty turned into national fame, then to the Republican nomination for President, and then to the White House.

Soon after graduating from Indiana University and being admitted to the bar, Halleck became the prosecuting attorney for Indiana's 13th district court. Halleck's formal entry into politics only came in 1934, when he was chosen to take the seat of an incoming Republican representative who had died less than two weeks after that year's midterm elections. Halleck was only in Washington for two years before the Second Civil War broke out, but he saw enough to determine that compromise with the radicals was useless at best and un-American at worst. The young representative doggedly supported the Federal war effort, but eventually made waves by declaring that emergency price controls and rationing should be rolled back as soon as possible - he argued that Americans should \"live again as God meant them to live\", and not as some Washington bureaucrat did.\n\nThroughout his career, Halleck has defined himself as an ardently conservative Republican, scoffing at the party's Eastern establishment and their calls for moderation. To him, Americans didn't fight two civil wars just for the government to micromanage their lives - they fought for the freedom to live as they pleased, and their right to live under a government that holds this freedom sacred.

Entering politics as a county judge, Garner quickly proceeded to the Texas House of Representatives in 1898 and soon made a name for himself by stubbornly backing the prickly pear cactus to be chosen as the Texas state flower - forever earning him the moniker \"Cactus Jack\". After two terms at the state level, he was elected to national office in 1902 with the backing of the white landowners that control voting in South Texas. In the three decades since, Garner has marked himself as a supporter of a federal income tax, rural investment, a balanced budget, and the machinery that has, up to now, maintained Democratic dominance over the South, all combined with a larger-than-life personality that endears him to both farmers and Southern magnates alike.\n\nThis is the wave that has sent Garner to the presidency, even if by a House decision.

The most successful son of Lt. General Arthur MacArthur, he followed the steps of his father and enrolled in the United States Military Academy at West Point, then - immediately to fighting against insurgencies in the Philippines and the occupation of Veracruz during the Mexican Revolution. By the 1920s, he was already the youngest Major General in the United States Army and the super-intendant of West Point, which he reformed to address the changes in modern warfare since the Weltkrieg. After service in his old academy, he returned to his second home, the Philippines - but his time there was brief, as deteriorating situation in the United States forced him to return in 1930.\n\nAs political battles raged in Congress and behind closed doors, MacArthur's name kept being mentioned as a blessing or as a curse - everyone knew of his persona, and everyone knew what it stood for. To imagine that the United States Army could intervene in civilian politics, undermine democracy, as if it was some tinpot Latin American dictatorship and not the birthplace of democracy... was a hard pill to swallow for many in the upper echelons of government. President Hoover found himself relying upon MacArthur's strongarm control of the army more and more to prevent a collapse of order, and now that he's gone, the General made no surprises and did exactly what was foretold.\n\nWrapping himself in the corpse of American democracy, MacArthur now commands a junta of conservative politicians and business interests to defend the America they hold dear from everyone on the political spectrum.

Through his father's influence, MacArthur quickly became a military advisor to President Theodore Roosevelt until 1908, where he took command of an engineer company in Fort Leavenworth, reaching the rank of Captain in 1911. All these high profile postings allowed him to join the American General Staff in 1912, at the young age of 32. MacArthur took part in the occupation of Veracruz, learning Spanish in a matter of weeks and taking part in several small skirmishes with the rebels. He returned to America in 1919, when he was assigned as the Director of the United States' Military Academy at West Point. In 1922, he returned to the Philippines, this time to inspect the island's defence status, and having to intervene personally to end mutiny of Philippino scouts. With his promotion to Major General in 1925, his notoriety only grew and grew, being sent to the 1928 Olympic games in the Netherlands to head the American Olympic Committee. However, MacArthur was also forced to comply with orders he didn't agree with, like the court martial of Brigadier General Billy Mitchell, which MacArthur has called \"one of the most distasteful orders I ever received\". During the \"Bonus March\", MacArthur was forced, under President Hoover's orders, to put down the \"Bonus Army\" despite MacArthur's agreeing with the protestors' demands.
