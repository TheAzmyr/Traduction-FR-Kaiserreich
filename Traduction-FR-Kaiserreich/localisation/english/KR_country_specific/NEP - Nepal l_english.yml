 nepal.10.t: "Nepal Winning the War"
 nepal.10.d: "Impossibly, the Nepalese Gurkhas have streamed out of the mountains and are turning the tide against us. Perhaps the time has come to give in to their demands and sue for peace?"

 nepal.11.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Sues for Peace with Nepal"

 nepal.21.d.noclaims: "The war with the Nepalese has ground down in the mountains, territory they are far too adept at fighting in.

 nepal.22.d.noclaims: "The war with [From.GetNameDef] has ground down in the mountains, as we knew it would, but we are a long, long way from victory.

Tribhuvan, however, was born king in name only, in reality, the boy-king was nothing more than a figurehead for the powerful Rana family. As he has grown into a man, Nepalese politics have become increasingly defined by the antagonistic relationship between the king and the Ranas. Time alone will reveal the victor of the struggle both politically and economically.§!"
