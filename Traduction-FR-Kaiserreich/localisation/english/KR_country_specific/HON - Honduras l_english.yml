 HON_KR_gathering_storm_desc: "The suicide of President Andino in 1933 following the peasant charge of the capital created a shock wave throughout Honduras, and soon after a peasant republic was established in order to gradually root out US influence and purge Pro US elements. In 1936 the Council is on the brink of collapse and there are rumours of a conspiracy within the government..."

### Intro Screen ####
 HON_country_intro_header: "The Original Banana Republic"
 HON_country_intro_content: "Having come under the domination of various US fruit companies that turned the nation into an economic enclave, Honduras came to a breaking point in 1933. A peasant uprising stormed the capital and lead to the suicide of the sitting president, but even after this catastrophe, the government established in the aftermath of the revolution became dominated once more by US interests and a clique of intelligentsia. Now what remains of Honduras' apparatus of state is a mess, purged of dissenters and relying on military force to keep the railways to the ports open."

### Ideas ###
 HON_peasant_republic: "Peasant Republic"
 HON_peasant_republic_desc: "Honduras is a 'peasant republic'; that is to say it is run by the council in the name of the peasantry, and its official name is the Peasants' and Workers' Republic of Honduras. In practice, however, this government is moribund and has ceased to represent the people."
 HON_december_revolution: "December Revolution"
 HON_december_revolution_desc: "The December Revolution took place in 1932, when peasants occupied the capital and a loose coalition of different groups took power as the "Peasants' Council of Honduras". Now the revolution is regarded by some as a failure, but by others as having not gone far enough..."
 HON_great_purge: "Great Purge"
 HON_great_purge_desc: "The Great Purge was a mass persecution of members of the armed forces, primarily the Honduran army, who had links to America. While the commercial realities of the situation meant that American influence would creep back in and the Monroe Doctrine would remain in force, it still crippled the Honduran army, which is... something, one might suppose."

### Events ###
 honduras.200.t: "State of the Army"
 honduras.200.d: "The Honduran Army is a small one and currently suffers from an severe lack of competent leadership due to the purges of American-connected officers that have occurred. There are two major competing schools of thought seeking to remedy this deficiency: One proposes professionalising the army into a small and elite force that is very selective, while the other espouses a large army focused entirely on defence rather than offensive operations outside of Honduras."
 honduras.200.a: "Point the loud end at the other guy."

 honduras.2.t: "Desertions In the Army"
 honduras.2.d: "For a long time now, we have relied on military force to protect the narrow railways connecting plantations to ports in order to keep our economy afloat. However, with the ongoing economic crisis and political discontent, the loyalty of the Army has become uncertain, with hundreds of men quitting their posts to join up with one militia or another."
 honduras.2.a: "They'll come back when they're hungry."

 honduras.194.t: "Honduras wants to buy the USS South Dakota"

 honduras.195.d: "The USS South Dakota now sails for our ports! Truly this is a great day for this young nation."
 honduras.195.a: "Hurrah!"

 honduras.100.t: "The American Economy Dips Further"
 honduras.100.d: "Somehow they've managed it. With the collapse of the German stock market, the investments of American firms have gone from bad to worse and the import market has fallen even further as consumer spending on all but the most essential goods bottoms out."
 honduras.100.a: "Not much call for bananas..."

 honduras.101.t: "Monroe Lapses"
 honduras.101.d: "Armed conflict has struck the USA, throwing her government into chaos and threatening to destroy it entirely. In these dire times, the maintenance of the Monroe Doctrine is obviously impossible."
 honduras.101.a: "A crisis, yes, but also an opportunity."

 honduras.102.t: "A Railway Bombing"
 honduras.102.d: "Disaster struck early this morning as a unit of deserters, in protest of the Council's policy, bombed the section of railway they used to guard. Reports have already arrived of heists on the now stopped trains."
 honduras.102.a: "Round up some loyalists and get after them!"

 honduras.103.t: "Skirmishes with Deserters"
 honduras.103.d: "Perhaps unsurprisingly, when they deserted, the soldiers kept their guns. The loyalists we sent to track down and arrest the railway bombers have been fired upon, and a running skirmish is now occurring north of the capital."
 honduras.103.a: "Well, at least it can't get any worse."

 honduras.104.t: "Into El Salvador"
 honduras.104.d: "The militants have fled into El Salvador, hoping to base themselves there and stage a proper campaign of guerrilla warfare to overthrow the Council. However, it seems our soldiers show no signs of giving up the chase..."
 honduras.104.a: "I spoke too soon."

 honduras.105.t: "Military Clashes with El Salvador"
 honduras.105.d: "It seems our abortive attempt at a swift arrest of the bombers has escalated beyond our control, with an open firefight breaking out between our army and the Salvadorans'."
 honduras.105.a: "Damn and blast!"

 honduras.106.t: "Victory!"
 honduras.106.d: "It seems we have won the clash with our neighbour over the escaped Honduran soldiers. Looks like we'll be celebrating tonight!"
 honduras.106.a: "Break out the champagne!"

 honduras.107.t: "Defeat!"
 honduras.107.d: "It seems our forces have lost the clash with our neighbour over the escaped Honduran soldiers. Looks like it'll be a grim evening."
 honduras.107.a: "Humiliating..."

 honduras.108.t: "Stalemate"
 honduras.108.d: "It seems the clash in El Salvador has ended with neither side having a clear advantage."
 honduras.108.a: "..."

 honduras.109.t: "The Trial of the Mutineers"
 honduras.109.d: "Today the Council was due to sit in judgement of the mutineers of earlier in the year. However, at the last minute, a crowd of lowly peasants stormed the courtroom and set them free. An emergency meeting of the Council has been convened to try and address the issue later."
 honduras.109.a: "Oh no..."

 honduras.110.t: "Asking El Salvador"
 honduras.110.d: "With military force having failed, it would seem that we have no option but to ask El Salvador to arrest the mutineers on our behalf."
 honduras.110.a: "Very well, telegram them."

 honduras.111.t: "Honduras Requests Their Criminals"
 honduras.111.d: "A group of mutinous Honduran soldiers recently crossed the border, prompting an armed clash between our forces and the poorly-trained Honduran soldiers in pursuit. Now Honduras has requested they be repatriated."
 honduras.111.a: "Make use of this for propaganda."
 honduras.111.b: "We might as well send them back."

 honduras.112.t: "El Salvador humiliates us!"
 honduras.112.d: "El Salvador returned our message today informing us that there will be no surrender to our demands."
 honduras.112.a: "How embarrassing."

 honduras.1122.t: "Anti-Salvadoran Militants"
 honduras.1122.d: "In response to the humiliation of our great nation by the vile Salvadorans, militant groups have begun forming near the border, dedicated to fighting off any incursion or retaliation from them. Known as the "Mancha Brava", they form a secret society of sorts, and might be valuable in the defence of the nation."
 honduras.1122.a: "Well, it's something..."

 honduras.113.t: "Victory over Nicaragua"
 honduras.113.d: "O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory? The revolutionary threat from Nicaragua has been soundly defeated and all that remains is the smouldering wreck of their attempt to overthrow Honduran might."
 honduras.113.a: "A great day for our nation."

 honduras.1040.t: "Honduran Forces Enter"
 honduras.1040.d: "Honduran military units claiming to be in hot pursuit of rebels crossed the border into El Salvador today. When the Army attempted to turn them back the ill-disciplined rabble forced the checkpoint and wounded two of our men in the crossfire!"
 honduras.1040.a: "We'll make them pay!"

 honduras.3.t: "The Emergency Council Session: Wainwright' Rally"
 honduras.3.d: "While ostensibly a member of the Revolutionary Council, Juan Wainwright has always stood somewhat apart from it. Before the emergency session to deal with the political crisis, he held a rally of his supporters in public, both to rally support and as a show of force to both the Army and the Council. Indeed, many whisper that simply handing him and his Redshirts the presidenship could inject the vitality that the moribund revolution needs."
 honduras.3.a: "Just what we need, more strongmen."

 honduras.4.t: "The Emergency Council Session: Castro's Connections"
 honduras.4.d: "General Jose Leon Castro has been a key player in rallying military support for the Council for a while now, associating with various officer's cliques and slowly forming his own band of loyalists. It is also well known that despite the anti-American policy of the Revolutionary Council, he and other members are in extensive contact with the United Fruit Company that still grips the economy. There are even murmurs in the Council that his influence would make a military regime preferable to the absolute loss of power that would accompany major reforms."
 honduras.4.a: "One way or another, the Council seems doomed."

 honduras.5.t: "Rallying for Democracy"
 honduras.5.d: "With the desertions in the Army, the repression of demonstrations has become much more difficult. Consequentially, there have been large rallies in the capital and across the countryside today as the people of Honduras make known their true feelings of discontent with the Council's regime..."
 honduras.5.a: "They cry out for the freedom they were promised."

 honduras.6.t: "The Emergency Session"
 honduras.6.d: "The emergency session of the Honduran Council has begun, to decide the future of the Peasants' Republic. A large crowd has gathered outside of council chambers, with the police unwilling to disperse them. The first task of the Council is to elect a new chairman to set the agenda for the meeting. Council members Wainwright and Castro have nearly come to blows over their differing views, and wild accusations are being made by either side, while Councilors Morales and Callejas have formed a united front arguing for the dissolution of the Council and its reformation as an elected body; ultimately there seems to be only a few options..."
 honduras.6.a: "General Castro will chair the Council and institute martial law."
 honduras.6.b: "Councillor Wainwright will chair the Council and push forward the revolution."
 honduras.6.c: "All motions on chairmanship are remitted. Start printing ballot papers!"

 honduras.11.t: "The Elections Go Ahead"
 honduras.11.d: "The emergency elections are being held. Ramon Morales and Venancio Callejas are both moderates with a relative degree of popularity that might carry the day."
 honduras.11.a: "Morales clutches it!"
 honduras.11.b: "Callejas wins out!"
 honduras.11.c: "Truth is, the elections were rigged from the start."

 honduras.13.t: "President Wainwright Takes Control"
 honduras.13.d: "Having cleared out the last of the opposition and been appointed chairman of the council, the assumption of power by Juan Wainwright has become a fait accompli. His new state promises to be vigorous and progressive and to bring Honduras into the world of 20th century socialism."
 honduras.13.a: "Long Live The People!"

 honduras.14.t: "General Castro Takes Control"
 honduras.14.d: "Today, General Jose Castro was sworn in as the President of Honduras and elevated to head of the armed forces. As the chairman of the now-defunct Council he has effectively been in power for several weeks, but it seems that only now does he feel confident enough to declare a new Republic."
 honduras.14.a: "We shall stand strong!"

 honduras.15.t: "Honduras Seeks to Restore Relations"
 honduras.15.d: "A Honduran diplomatic mission arrive today with the aim to normalise relations with us and learn from our combat techniques to bolster the regime paramilitary forces. In exchange, they brought a group of expert engineer to help with us in our industrialisation process."
 honduras.15.a: "United for the Revolution."

In the aftermath of the revolution a coalition of ambitious intelligentsia and military personnel took over and instituted a "great purge" of dissenters and pro-US elements. Even they could not resist the lure of the United Fruit Company however, and its stranglehold on the Honduran economy. Now in serious decay the "Peasant's Republic" holds on by using military force to control the fragile transport links around the country and has all but lost control.§!"
