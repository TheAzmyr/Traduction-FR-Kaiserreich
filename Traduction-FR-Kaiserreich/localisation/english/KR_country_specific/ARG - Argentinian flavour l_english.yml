 arg_flavour.1.t: "The Obelisk of Buenos Aires"
 arg_flavour.1.d: "To celebrate the 400th anniversary of the foundation of Buenos Aires by conquistador Don Pedro de Mendoza, a colossal monument has been erected on the Plaza de la Republica. Standing at the intersection of the Corrientes and 9 de julio avenues, two of the Paris of South America's most lively streets, the obelisk is 235 feet tall, a testament for the ages of our capital's history.\n\nWith its construction delayed by the tumultuous political events of recent times, the monument was designed by rationalist architect Alberto Prebisch and built in a record time of 31 days by the German-Argentine Compañía General de Obras Públicas, who employed 157 workers in the construction. Over 200.000 pesos were invested, in what has become one of the most important and costly architectural endeavours in the city's history.\n\nDespite the government's intention of honouring Buenos Aires' status as the nation's capital, the effort has been received with some controversy by the city's inhabitants, with many considering the building an \"ugly and unappealing pole of cement\". Regardless of the sneers and protests, we can only hope that eventually porteños will come to accept this new addition to the city's patrimony."

 arg_flavour.2.t: "Writer Horacio Quiroga Commits Suicide"
 arg_flavour.2.d: "The Uruguayan born writer Horacio Silvestre Quiroga Forteza has passed away in the Hospital de Clinicas de Jose de San Martín. While he had been diagnosed with a very advanced case of prostate cancer, his death has still come as a shock for the Argentina's literary scene, as he chose to commit suicide before the disease could advance any further. While the Sociedad Argentina de Escritores (SADE) prepares his funeral arrangements, many of his loyal fans are writing newspaper articles in commemoration of his memory as one of the region's greatest horror and tragedy writers, with books such as 'Cuentos de Amor de locura y de muerte' having now become classics of Argentine literature."

 arg_flavour.3.t: "Writer Leopoldo Lugones Found Dead"
 arg_flavour.3.d: "The famous Argentine writer Leopoldo Antonio Lugones has been found dead in a resort in the town of Tigre. While an investigation was carried out, it was clear that the reason of death was suicide, as Lugones had ingested a mixture of whisky and cyanide before passing. Lugones had fervently supported the Liga Patriótica in his final years, and his suicide still came as a shock for the right wing establishment, who found legitimacy in Lugones' political writings. As the founder of the SADE, the preparation of his funeral has fallen to them, and within it, proposals for turning the birthday of its founder and one of Argentina's most influential writers into a national holiday are quickly gaining traction."

 arg_flavour.5.t: "The Liga Patriótica Fuses with the Alianza Libertadora Nacionalista"
 arg_flavour.5.d: "Having managed to fully complete his takeover, Carlés has been quick to search for allies in the Argentinian political landscape. With the Uriburu coup still very much alive in many people's memories, Carlés has started to meet with their leader, Colonel Juan Bautista Molina, in order for both organisations to come together for the future of Argentina. While many had drawn the conclusion that the Alianza Libertadora Nacionalista (Nationalist Liberation Alliance) was going to be the Patriotic League's successor, the failure of the Uriburu coup spelled disaster for their ranks, with many simply choosing to become members of both the LP and what remained of the ALN. While details of the meetings are being kept largely in secret, it is theorised that Carlés intends to utilise the ALN as a de-facto state paramilitary, given that they already organise in a militarist fashion."

 arg_flavour.7.t: "Dirección Nacional de Migraciones Created"
 arg_flavour.7.d: "In a way to avoid the 1853 Constitution's article that no Argentinian government can restrict immigration, Carlés has authorised the creation of an Argentine agency dedicated to investigating and authorising the entry of immigrants to the nation, known as the Dirección Nacional de Migraciones (National Directorate of Migrations). With offices being built on several hotspots of immigration like Buenos Aires, Bariloche and Puerto Iguazu, the agency will be tasked with issuing permits for people to be allowed to work and live in Argentina. While many nationalists applaud this measure, as it's going to add a layer of screening to the migrants that have been coming to Argentina, many with questionable backgrounds, the opposition members have been outspoken about the oppressive nature of said measures, with claims that these are just blatant attempts at skirting the constitution.

 arg_flavour.9.t: "Alfonsina Storni Found Dead"
 arg_flavour.9.d1: "In yet another unfortunate blow for the SADE, the modernist poet Alfonsina Storni has been found dead today. An investigation was opened on the case but it was quickly concluded as a suicide, given statements given by her acquaintances as well as evidence found on her residence and in the area where she reportedly threw herself off a breakwater into the sea in the town of Mar del Plata. Her body, found washed up on a beach by two workers, is now on its way to Buenos Aires, where funeral preparations are being prepared by the SADE as the national newspapers write about 'The Tragic Death of the Great American Poet'. While her association with Socialist Revolutionary Manuel Baldomero has caused a great deal of concern for the government, many passers-by left flowers and paid respects in the train cabin she was going to be transported later in the day, and so it may be better to leave the procession be for the time being..."

Nevertheless, Ugarte has come out writing strongly about her in La Vanguardia, and rumours abound that he has even sent parting gifts for her funeral, further reinforcing the idea that both writers had been close."

 arg_flavour.10.t: "Lisandro de la Torre is Found Dead"
 arg_flavour.10.d: "The Partido Popular Democratico's founder, Lisandro de la Torre, has been found dead today in his apartment in Buenos Aires. The progressive politician, having largely taken a harsher stance towards conservatives after the assassination of Enzo Bordabehere, stepped down from public life after the Liga Patriótica's Coup in hopes of avoiding a political retaliation. However, it seems his own personal life was what got to him in the end, as a quick investigation has labelled his death as a suicide, with him even sending farewell letters to his close friends before shooting himself. Leaving behind a controversial legacy standing in the middle ground between revolutionaries and conservatives, the public still holds him in high esteem as many have attended his funeral, possibly thanks to his investigation of German intervention in the meat market in 1933."

 arg_flavour.11.t: "Buenos Aires Underground Expands!"
 arg_flavour.11.d: "The Buenos Aires underground, which opened in 1913, was the first metro system on the South American continent and even in the whole Southern Hemisphere. Little expansion has been done in the last decades, and continued immigration to the city from the impoverished countryside and the massive influx of European immigrants has left our public transportation system severely lacking, leading to the government proposal to nationalise the network to allow for better expansion and to meet the demands created by the city's population explosion. And now, after several months of work, a new line "D" for the system has been completed, linking Catedral to Tribunales. The people of Buenos Aires are impatiently awaiting the opening ceremony!"

 arg_flavour.12.t: "The Death of Bairoletto"
 arg_flavour.12.d: "Today, after a gunfight with the police in the town of San Pedro de Atuel, the famous rural outlaw Juan Bautista Bairoletto has been declared dead. While the official version is that he was killed in the firefight, it has become a popular myth that he shot himself to avoid the dishonour of being captured. An almost legendary figure for the Argentine rural population, his death will undoubtedly be mourned by many.\n\nBorn in 1894, the son of Italian immigrants, Bairoletto was raised in a little town in the province of La Pampa. There, he occasionally broke the law through petty thefts and vagrancy, until a romantic dispute over a local prostitute ended in his assassination of the commissar of the town, causing him to become an outlaw. After this event, his criminal career quickly became well-known, with each assault and escape making him more admired by the people. Notably, Bairoletto stole from the rich and shared his profits with the poor, leading to him being known as the \"Argentine Robin Hood\" and earning him the praise of the Argentine left, especially the anarchists.\n\nWhile his death will without question be a propaganda victory for the regime of Buenos Aires, it can't be denied that for a significant part of the population, his demise is a sad reminder of the slow vanishing of the rural countryside traditions and the gaucho way of living."

 arg_flavour.13.t: "'La Vida de Carlos Gardel' Premiers"
 arg_flavour.13.d: "The movie 'La Vida de Carlos Gardel' ('The Life of Carlos Gardel') has premiered today in Argentine cinemas and has been greatly received by the public. Directed by Alberto de Zavalia and sporting famous Argentine Actors like Hugo del Carril and Delia Garces, the movie has drawn some controversy due to the way the plot diverges from Gardel's personal story. The plot revolves around Gardel, falling in love with a woman as he grows famous as an artist, only to sadly lose her love when he begins his international tour, ending with his ultimate demise in a plane crash; the woman is then only left with Gardel's records, but the story ends happily as they both reunite as ghosts. The issue raised by many of Gardel's most loyal fans is that the artist never had any public relationships with any woman and that the movie is taking a purposefully fictional take on the artist. The producers, however, have defended their work, claiming it was never meant to be a biography in return."

 arg_flavour.14.t: "La Bombonera Opens!"
 arg_flavour.14.d: "Previous to La Bombonera, the football club 'Boca Juniors' had used several locations before settling on their current ground on Brandsen. Club's first ground had been located in Dársena Sur of the old Buenos Aires port (currently Puerto Madero) and Isla Demarchi before moving to Brandsen and Del Crucero streets in 1924.\n\nIn 1931, the Boca Juniors' steering committee (led by president Ruperto Molfino) acquired the lands from the Municipality of Buenos Aires for A$$ 2,200,000. Three years later the club published a call for tenders to build its new stadium. Economic hardship due to the Black Monday disaster and the inability to find proper architects delayed the construction of the new stadium until 1938 when the club played their last match before the great work began.\n\nFinally opening on May 25, 1940, with a friendly match between Boca and San Lorenzo, the home side won 2-0 with both goals scored by Ricardo Alarcón. Even though the station was freshly built, it lacked a lighting system which forced the game to end by the 70th minute."

 arg_flavour.15.t: "La Invención de Morel"
 arg_flavour.15.d: "Adolfo Bioy Casares has published today what can be considered the start of a new phase in his writing career, a short novel titled \"The Invention of Morel\", the first major work of science fiction in Hispanic literature. The book tells the story of a Venezuelan writer, by the name of \"El Fugitivo\", who, hiding from the law, casts away in a remote Pacific island where a strange disease seems to exist. Soon a group of people arrive, leading him to hide from them in fear of being turned in. However, he can't help falling in love with one of them, a mysterious woman named Faustine who doesn't seem to notice his presence. After a succession of anomalous events involving the strangers and the very nature of the island, El Fugitivo soon realises that the visitors are not what they appear.\n\nTouching themes such as madness, solitude and love, the book has accomplished both commercial and critical success, with fellow author Jorge Luis Borges writing that \"To classify it as perfect is neither an imprecision nor a hyperbole\". Bioy Casares, a friend of figures such as Borges and the Ocampo sisters, considers the book the true beginning of his writing career. Despite his status as a relatively obscure writer, it has become obvious that the novel will have a great influence on Argentine literature."

Two deaths have already been accounted for but many more could still be trapped in the rubble. Reported as a 6.2 on the Richter scale, authorities are happy to report that damage is minimal and a greater tragedy was avoided due to the location of the epicentre."

 arg_flavour.17.d1: "Today, after a few weeks of medical consultations, General Agustin Pedro Justo has unfortunately passed away in his home. While an autopsy has yet to reveal the cause of death, it is widely believed he simply died of old age, as he was already sixty six years old, and having lived a fair share of complicated personal situations. As the leading member of the Pro-British wing of the Army, his death now marks a turning point towards the pro-German cliques, a favourable development for the GOU. However, Liborio has come out writing against the government and the military, blaming them for Justo's death. As funeral preparations are being made, it is unclear whether the protection Agustin granted Liborio will hold up after his death..."
 arg_flavour.17.d2: "Today, after a few weeks of medical consultations, General Agustin Pedro Justo has unfortunately passed away in his home. While an autopsy has yet to reveal the cause of death, it is widely believed he simply died of old age, as he was already sixty six years old, and having lived a fair share of complicated personal situations. With the death of Liborio having turned him into a strong denouncer of the government, Justo had begun agitating in the UCRA to call for some level of opposition against our regime, who now have all but gone silent with his death. As the leading member of the Pro-British wing of the Army, his passing also marks a turning point towards the pro-German cliques, a favourable development for the GOU. While funeral arrangements are being done by his family, the government has largely remained quiet on the subject."

While an autopsy has yet to reveal the cause of death, it is widely believed he simply died of old age, as he was already sixty six years old, and having lived a fair share of complicated personal situations. With Liborio having intervened in the trial, Justo retired and spent most of his retirement in his countryside homestead enjoying the protection of the chairman, writing a compilation of historian Bartolomé Mitre's works. His death has greatly impacted Liborio, who has requested to take a break from his regular activities for two weeks in order to help organise the funeral."

 arg_flavour.18.d: "Based on Leopoldo Lugones' book of the same name, the movie 'Gaucho Wars' has premiered this weekend, receiving rave reviews from critics, and being applauded by the public. The plot, revolving around the exploits of Argentine national hero Martin Güemes against the Royalist forces during the war of independence, has been quickly paralleled by political commentators to the situation in Argentina in regards to the conflict ensuing in Europe and the polarisation growing throughout the world. With the movie's success, the Artistas Argentinos Asociados cooperative, which had put most of their funding into the movie's production and nearly filed for bankruptcy, has now regained their investment back and earned quite the surplus for their activity, which they intend to invest back in more movies."

 arg_flavour.19.t: "40th Anniversary of the Antarctic Expedition"
 arg_flavour.19.d: "At the end of the 19th century, two international geography congresses (1895 and 1899) established the advisability of undertaking a great expedition to Antarctica, since this was the only region of the planet over which there was no important information. As a consequence, in the Swedish city of Göteborg, Otto Nordenskjöld, a Swedish geologist and geographer began organising a trip to the American Antarctic quadrant. Unlike other polar voyages of the time, such as those of Robert Falcon Scott or Roald Amundsen, this expedition did not plan to break any records or set precedents for a future claim to sovereignty over polar lands, it was an international alliance whose objective was to carry out extensive scientific exploration work on the Antarctic continent.\n\nThe expedition's overall command was placed under the Norwegian Carl Anton Larsen, an experienced Antarctic explorer who served as captain of 'Antarctic'. On 16 October 1901, the Antarctic left the Port of Göteborg.\n\nOn the way to Snow Hill Island in 1901, Nordenskjöld had passed through Buenos Aires, where the Argentine government gave him supplies on the condition that he include in his wintering-over party a young Argentine naval officer, Lieutenant José María Sobral. In 1902, the expedition landed to Snow Hill Island in the Weddell Sea, where they planned to spend one winter.\n\nThe ship that was to return to pick them up, the 'Antarctic,' under Captain Carl Larsen's command, was crushed by ice and sunk, leaving the expedition to spend a second winter on Snow Hill Island. The expedition had no connection with the continent or the stranded 'Antarctic' crew, which spent the winter on Paulet Island in poor shelter. The survivors, including José Mara Sobral, were rescued a year later in 1903 by the Argentine corvette 'ARA Uruguay'. The ship arrived in Buenos Aires on December 2, 1903, being received by 100,000 people and a hundred ships that sounded their sirens and horns in her honour.\n\nDespite the great hardships endured, the expedition would be considered a scientific success, with the parties having explored much of the eastern coast of Graham Land, including Cape Longing, James Ross Island, the Joinville Island group, and the Palmer Archipelago. The expedition, which also recovered valuable geological samples and samples of marine animals."
