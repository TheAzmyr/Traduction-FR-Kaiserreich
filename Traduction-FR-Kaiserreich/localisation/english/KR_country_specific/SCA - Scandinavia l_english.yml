### Focus Tree ###
### Formation
 SCANDINAVIA_nordic_council: "Establish the Nordic Council"

 SCANDINAVIA_military_volunteers_desc: "The increased cooperation between the Nordic armies requires officers with a special mind-set and certain skills. Let us exchange generals to further aid in this."
 SCANDINAVIA_passport_union: "Nordic Passport Convention"
 SCANDINAVIA_passport_union_desc: "Why should Nordic citizens require visas and permits to visit each other? We shall sign a convention to remove the internal borders of Scandinavia."
 SCANDINAVIA_joint_sessions: "Parliamentary Joint Sessions"

 SCANDINAVIA_common_tech: "Scandinavian Scientist Conference"
 SCANDINAVIA_common_tech_desc: "Scandinavian scientists have met in irregular meetings since 1839. We should formalise these meetings to exchange our technical developments in a more efficient way."
 SCANDINAVIA_common_tech_2: "Technological Cooperation"
 SCANDINAVIA_common_tech_2_desc: "The success of the Scandinavian Scientist Conference means that we could increase our cooperation further. If we institute a fixed system for sharing knowledge, we would all benefit in the long run."

 SCA_Safety_Net: "Establish a Safety Net"
 SCA_Safety_Net_desc: "We should establish a safety net for those unfortunate enough to be unable to work. It is not fitting for a civilised nation such as ours to allow the people to starve to death, rather than to help them."
 SCA_Aid_the_Nordic_Worker: "Aid the Nordic Worker"
 SCA_Aid_the_Nordic_Worker_desc: "The federation has gained its hard-earned prosperity off the back of the Nordic working class. It is only fair to help them, doing something back for the great achievements they secured."

 SCA_Safeguard_National_Autonomy: "Safeguard National Autonomy"
 SCA_Safeguard_National_Autonomy_desc: "We should ensure that we don't fall for the temptation of unnecessary centralisation. Such actions would only harm the popularity of the federation and keep it from improving the lives of its citizens. Local autonomy is therefore paramount."
 SCA_The_Nordic_Standard: "The Nordic Standard"
 SCA_The_Nordic_Standard_desc: "Our sound and down-to-earth approach has allowed to us to set a standard for other countries to try and emulate. A standard in controlling the government, if you will."
 SCA_Conservatism_Reigns: "Conservative-Agrarian Coalition"
 SCA_Conservatism_Reigns_desc: "The Conservative Party and the truly Scandinavian Agrarian League have formed an alliance on a conservative platform. In support of farmers and morality, the influence of this first federal coalition will not be insignificant."

 SCA_The_Nordic_Example: "The Nordic Example"
 SCA_The_Nordic_Example_desc: "Our moral and economic perfection is an example for all to see, the identity of the Nordic Federation is an enviable one, and this is thanks to our efforts to make it so."

### Army
 SCA_Merge_the_National_Armies: "Merge the National Armies"

 SCA_Jungs_Mobile_Warfare: "Jung's Mobile Warfare"
 SCA_Jungs_Mobile_Warfare_desc: "The Swedish general Helge Jung proposes we invest in the motorisation of the army. This will give us an advantage in manoeuvring throughout the stretched lands of Scandinavia and in the battlefield."
 SCA_Nordic_Trucks: "Motorise our Army"
 SCA_Nordic_Trucks_desc: "We can make our army significantly more mobile by adopting trucks to move their equipment. Let us motorise our army for the good of the federation."
 SCA_Fleischers_Superior_Firepower: "Fleischer's Superior Firepower"
 SCA_Fleischers_Superior_Firepower_desc: "Norway's Carl Gustaf Fleischer suggests a heavy focus on artillery, allowing us to use these heavy weapons to avoid giving up too many Scandinavians (whose numbers are limited regardless) to inflict casualties upon our enemies."
 SCA_Modern_Equipment: "Modern Equipment"
 SCA_Modern_Equipment_desc: "Important to minimise our losses and to maximise our army's fighting capacity is to invest in modern equipment for our army. We cannot allow ourselves to fall behind in this area."
 SCA_Maintain_Separate_Militaries: "Maintain Separate Militaries"
 SCA_Maintain_Separate_Militaries_desc: "While purely from the perspective of efficiency, a single merged army is best, it will be significantly easier to motivate the people's of our federation to fight under their own flag under that of the federation, where they may be subject to language differences as well."
 SCA_Priors_Grand_Battleplan: "Prior's Grand Battleplan"
 SCA_Priors_Grand_Battleplan_desc: "Danish senior officer William Prior has given his own pitch in favour of a very plan-based doctrinal plan for the coming years. According to him, by planning out the next war, we shall win it."
 SCA_Supreme_High_Command: "The Supreme High Command"
 SCA_Supreme_High_Command_desc: "We should establish a single Supreme Nordic High Command that has the last say over the strategy and deployment of our troops. This will allow for a greater degree of cooperation between our army divisions."
 SCA_Nordic_Tank_Brigades: "Federal Tank Brigades"
 SCA_Nordic_Tank_Brigades_desc: "Panzer brigades are key to winning wars in the modern era. These large armoured vehicles with significant firepower are capable of breaking through defences in which infantry forces would have been mowed down. All in all, we should invest in their development."
 SCA_Artillery_Investment: "Artillery Investment"
 SCA_Artillery_Investment_desc: "Artillery is vital to cover and support our forces in the dirt. By investing additional resources in the production of more artillery we can secure the support of our army delivered by them and gain an advantage in battles."

 SCA_The_Joint_Exercise_desc: "We should let all Nordic soldiers participate in a single large exercise, to prevent the armies from rusting in inactivity as well as to teach them to work together as a single military force."

### Navy
 SCA_Merge_the_National_Navies: "Merge the National Navies"
 SCA_Merge_the_National_Navies_desc: "Reality is that the navies of our member states are simply too small to be meaningful in the grand scale of things, but together the navies make for a decently-sized single navy. If we are to reap the benefits of this however, we are to merge these navies under a single command structure."
 SCA_Atlantic_Blue_Water: "Atlantic Focus: Blue Water Navy"
 SCA_Atlantic_Blue_Water_desc: "The primary aim of our navy is to give our federation influence on the grander theatre. A significant presence in the Atlantic is an objective towards reaching that goal. We should focus on making our navy ocean-worthy."
 SCA_Develop_Cruisers: "Develop Cruisers"
 SCA_Develop_Cruisers_desc: "If we are to secure a presence in the Atlantic west of Norway and Denmark, we should invest in extending our cruiser arsenal. Without them, we are bound to find ourselves unable to exert the power we are desiring."

 SCA_Baltic_Green_Water: "Baltic Focus: Green Water Navy"
 SCA_Baltic_Green_Water_desc: "While a hope of exerting our influence into the Atlantic, is hopeful, for the next couple of decades our focus should be on the Baltic sea. With all our navies combined, we can become a significant player in this body of water."
 SCA_Destroyer_Development: "Destroyer Development"
 SCA_Destroyer_Development_desc: "We should develop destroyers. These relatively small naval vessels are crucial in defending our larger ships and convoys from the submarine dangers that remain significant to this day."
 SCA_Uboat_Tactics: "U-Boat Tactics"
 SCA_Uboat_Tactics_desc: "The U-Boat made a significant dent in the British navy, especially in the earlier portion of the Weltkrieg. In addition, they are relatively cheap to produce. We should invest in this technology; it will win the next naval war."
 SCA_Nordic_Navy: "The Nordic Navy"
 SCA_Nordic_Navy_desc: "The Nordic Navy shall be known as a significant fighting force, one that is determined to defend our shores from any enemy with the intention of invading the islands, fjords and Baltic coasts of Scandinavia"

### Air
 SCA_Nordic_Air_Authority: "Establish the Nordic Aerial Authority"
 SCA_Nordic_Air_Authority_desc: "Before we can move towards merging the air forces of our member states, we should ensure that our civilian and military air authority is harmonised throughout the federation."
 SCA_Merge_the_National_Airforces: "Merge the National Air Forces"
 SCA_Merge_the_National_Airforces_desc: "Our regional air forces are not sufficient to defend the airspaces from a large power. However, if combined, the force grows exponentially and we will become a force in aerial warfare to be reckoned with."
 SCA_Invest_in_SAAB: "Invest in SAAB"
 SCA_Invest_in_SAAB_desc: "The Swedish company Svenska Aeroplan AB produces top of the line airplanes. By helping them expand throughout the federation we will secure ourselves a main plane supplier of high quality."

 SCA_The_Nordic_Airforce: "The Nordic Air Force"
 SCA_The_Nordic_Airforce_desc: "With the merge and expansion of our federal air force complete, enemies will think twice about messing with us. There is a significant chance that they might find themselves, in the air at least, at the disadvantage."

### Economy
 SCA_Advance_the_Integration: "Advance the Integration"
 SCA_Advance_the_Integration_desc: "While we may have come a long way, we are not there yet. There are still divisions between the different countries in the federation, and it is our task to erase them and bring the federation ever closer."
 SCA_Expand_Railway_Network: "Expand the Railway Network"
 SCA_Expand_Railway_Network_desc: "To improve regional connectivity, we should modernise and expand the railway network throughout Scandinavia. More goods will be transported, more people will travel faster, and in the event of an emergency, our troops will reach any location in the country without wasting time."
 SCA_Scandinavian_Highway: "The Pan-Scandinavian Highway"
 SCA_Scandinavian_Highway_desc: "We should work on building a highway that connects the far reaches of our federation with each other, increasing the amount of people interacting and mending cultural differences as a result. After all, if it is easy to go to Sweden, why stay only in Norway?"

 SCA_Invest_In_Excavation_Industry_desc: "Scandinavia is rich in resources, and using cutting-edge technology, we can expand existing mines and search for new deposits more efficiently."
 SCA_Subsidize_Nordic_Farms: "Subsidise Nordic Farms"
 SCA_Subsidize_Nordic_Farms_desc: "The Nordic farmers are what keeps this federation fed. It would only be right to support their work for this great federation by subsidising their activities, lowering their prices and giving them an edge over the competition."
 SCA_Support_Nordic_Business: "Nordic Business"
 SCA_Support_Nordic_Business_desc: "The countries of the north have a healthy private branch. We should encourage this entrepreneurship for the good of the member states and the federation as a whole."
 SCA_Unite_Intelligence_Agencies: "Unite Intelligence Agencies"
 SCA_Unite_Intelligence_Agencies_desc: "We can conduct more effective counterintelligence operations and get full information about prospective threats to Scandinavian democracy by forming a unified intelligence agency under the control of the federal government."
 SCA_Unified_Schooling_System: "Unify the Schooling System"
 SCA_Unified_Schooling_System_desc: "By unifying the differing schooling systems of our member states into a single system, we can increase interaction between schools from different states. Norwegians will then have an educational development that will be recognisable for Swedes, bringing about a greater similarity in the next generation."
 SCA_Mandatory_Language_Classes: "Mandatory Language Classes"
 SCA_Mandatory_Language_Classes_desc: "The difference - be they sometimes subtle - between the Nordic languages can result in nasty communication errors. By ensuring that the schools in the federation teach all the major federal languages, we can go this problem out of the way and make a cultural unification ever more possible."
 SCA_Federal_Exchange_Programs: "Federal Exchange Programmes"
 SCA_Federal_Exchange_Programs_desc: "By enabling exchanges from students throughout the federation, we will support cross-member state border friendships and cooperation, ensuring the growth of a solidarity between the youths of the Nordic nations."
 SCA_Nationalism_fades_away: "Nationalism Fades Away!"
 SCA_Nationalism_fades_away_desc: "Our efforts at expanding the interactions of the Nordic people in cultural and economic sense is paying off; while some will of course always remain stalwart nationalists, at least the amount of people identifying as Nordic citizen rather than say a Swedish citizen is lower than ever."

### Events ###
 nordic_formation.1.t: "Form a Nordic Council?"
 nordic_formation.1.d: "Representatives and diplomats of all three major Scandinavian countries have gathered in [SCA_nordic_council_leader.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] for a treaty to kickstart closer cooperation between the Nordic countries. We share values that not everyone in the world shares with us, and against a hostile world the nations of Scandinavia ought to work together, they argue. No hard agreements have been set here, but it does look like the follow-ups to this gathering might be more instrumental."
 nordic_formation.1.a: "A toast to our brethren!"

 nordic_formation.2.t: "The Treaty of [SCA_nordic_council_leader.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]"
 nordic_formation.2.d: "We have invited diplomats and representative from both Norway and Denmark to [SCA_nordic_council_leader.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] to negotiate a - for now non-binding - treaty to kickstart closer cooperation between the Nordic countries.

While indeed few hard agreements will be set here, the first impressions are positive, and it seems the follow-ups to this gathering might be more instrumental."
 nordic_formation.2.a: "A toast to our brethren!"
 nordic_formation.2.b: "This is a waste of time."

 nordic_formation.3.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Rejects Our Proposal"
 nordic_formation.3.d: "[From.GetNameDefCap] has let us know that they don't see any gain in following through with the reform we proposed. It seems that, in this area of politics at least, the peak of Scandinavian cooperation has been reached."
 nordic_formation.3.a: "Disappointing, but so be it..."

 nordic_formation.13.t: "[SCA_federation_initiator.GetNameDefCap] Proposes a Nordic Federation"

 nordic_formation.15.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Rejects Our Proposal"
 nordic_formation.15.d: "[From.GetNameDefCap] has waved off our proposal to unite all the Scandinavian countries in a democratic federation. It seems Scandinavian integration has, by all means, reached its peak."
 nordic_formation.15.a: "Disappointing, but not entirely unexpected..."

 nordic_formation.16.t: "Creation of the Nordic Federation"
 nordic_formation.16.d: "The other Scandinavian countries have agreed to our proposal regarding federation. According to its constitution, the Nordic Federation will, for now until it can be addressed by a proper federal government of course, be a democratic, federal monarchy. The executive will consists of a federal government, which holds power on behalf of a council consisting of the Swedish, Norwegian and Danish monarchs. The federal parliament will be based in Göteborg, but all the constituent kingdoms retains their individual institutions and autonomy."
 nordic_formation.16.a: "Great!"

 scandinavia.1.t: "The Formation of the Nordic Federation"
 scandinavia.1.d: "After the signing of the Scandinavian Treaty, a transitionary government primarily composed of civil servants with little active powers has been left in place that will co-govern the federation with the national governments until we successfully ratify the federal constitution, which will then be established as the highest law within the federation; above those of the member states, which will then allow for coordinated elections to establish a government elected by the people."
 scandinavia.1.a: "Prepare the Constitutional Convention!"

 scandinavia.2.t: "The First Federal Election"
 scandinavia.2.d: "We are ready to conduct our first federal election. This parliament is provisional and will only last until we can elect a more permanent assembly at a later date. While there are several smaller parties on the ballot, there are three that can realistically win the election. The Nordic Social Democratic Worker's Party is campaigning on the issue of public welfare and would like to keep the status quo in regards to federal and international affairs. The Liberal Party is promising to cut taxes and make itself strong for the civil liberties of the citizens. They are also in favour of maintaining the current status of the federation. Lastly, the Farmer's League is an agrarian party coming up for the interests of Scandinavia's farmers. Who will win?"
 scandinavia.2.a: "NSAP - The Social Democrats"
 scandinavia.2.b: "LP - The Liberals"
 scandinavia.2.c: "The Farmer's League - The Social Conservatives"

 scandinavia.3.t: "The [GetYear] Federal Election"
 scandinavia.3.d: "The time has come to elect a federal parliament to serve for a full four year term. Once again the different parties have campaigned vigorously, and it is to the Nordic people to decide who reigns supreme in the end."

 scandinavia.4.t: "The Nordic Constitution"
 scandinavia.4.d: "Section 1:\n\nArt. 1:\n1. This constitution shall apply to all parts of all constituent countries of the Nordic Federation.\n2. Which nations are considered part of the Federation shall be determined by federal law.\nArt. 2: The form of government shall be that of a constitutional monarchy. The head of the federation as determined in part 2 shall hold royal power.\n\nArt. 3: Legislative power shall be vested in the Nordic Parliament and the head of the federation conjointly; the executive power shall be vested in the cabinet.\n\nThese are the first articles of the Nordic constitution. The debates are fierce, but an agreement shall be reached on the fundament of our federation's law."
 scandinavia.4.a: "Hurrah!"

 scandinavia.5.t: "Section 3: The Head of the Federation"
 scandinavia.5.d: "Art. 34:\n1. The Federal Council shall jointly take upon themselves the office of 'Head of the Federation'.\n2. The heads of state of the constituent countries take seat in the federal council.\n\nArt. 35: The federal council shall appoint the federal prime minister and his cabinet on the advice of the Nordic Parliament.\n\nWith these words, the reality is solidified that the federal council will act as the monarch in a constitutional monarchy. A fair manner in which none of the constituent countries will be negatively impacted."
 scandinavia.5.a: "A fair deal!"

 scandinavia.7.t: "Section 2: The Legislative Branch"
 scandinavia.7.d: "Art. 8: The Nordic Parliament shall be a separate body, elected by the people of each constituent country according to proportional representation.\nArt. 9: The Lower House shall consist of one assembly of not more than three hundred Members.\nArt. 10: The Upper House shall consist of one assembly of not more than one hundred and fifty Members.\nArt. 11: The Upper House and Lower House will together form the Nordic Parliament.\nWith these and more articles, the legislative branch of the Nordic Federation has been decided upon."

 scandinavia.8.a: "We're moving forward!"

 scandinavia.9.t: "Section 5: The Judicial Branch"
 scandinavia.9.d: "Art. 58: The High Court of the Federation shall consist of up to twenty of the eldest - according to seniority of office—ordinary members of the courts of justice of the constituent states, and an equal number of members elected for six years by the Lower House according to proportional representation. One or more substitutes shall be elected for each elected member. No Member of Parliament shall be elected a member of the High Court of the Realm, nor shall a Member of Parliament act as a member of the High Court of the Federation. Where in a particular instance some of the members of the highest court of justice of the Federation are prevented from taking part in the trial of a case, an equal number of the members of the High Court of the Federation last elected by Parliament shall retire from their seats.\n\nAs such, a new high court was established, standing above the national courts to enforce federal law."
 scandinavia.9.a: "This will bring stability."

 scandinavia.10.d: "Art. 58: Federal laws shall be enforced by the national judicial organisations as if they were regular laws. The federal government may not impede on the national judicial systems, unless all constituent countries other than the one in question agree the integrity of the national judicial branch is under serious duress.\n\nWith this article, judicial autonomy is secured."
 scandinavia.10.a: "The emergency clause was necessary to prevent misuse..."

 scandinavia.11.d: "Art. 58: Constituent countries may not entertain their own courts of law.\nThe exercise of the judiciary power shall be governed only by Federal Law. Extraordinary courts of justice with judicial power shall not be established. The exercise of the judiciary power shall be governed only by Statute.\nExtraordinary courts of justice with judicial power shall not be established.\nArt. 60: The administration of justice shall always remain independent of the executive power. Rules to this effect shall be laid down by Federal Law.\nArt. 61: The administration of justice shall always remain independent of the executive power. Rules to this effect shall be laid down by Statute.\nWith these articles, one Nordic judicial system for all constituent countries will be established. A few articles more, and their independence will be optimally secured."
 scandinavia.11.a: "I don't know if the constituent countries will approve of this..."

 scandinavia.12.t: "The Scandinavian Internationale"
 scandinavia.12.d: "Leading members of the social democratic parties of Scandinavia; primarily of Socialdemokratiet of Denmark, the Labour Party of Norway and the Swedish Social Democratic Labour Party, as well as some smaller, often local, parties, gathered in Copenhagen to establish their electoral alliance in the federal elections that shall be held in the future.\n\nRightwing Danish media sportingly nicknamed this gathering the 'Scandinavian Internationale' after the international socialist gatherings. While they decided to go for the name of 'Nordic Social Democratic Workers Party', this sobriquet was enthusiastically adopted by the younger socialists, although the leader of the Danish youth wing, Hans Hedtoft, did clarify that the Nordic Social Democratic Party does not endorse syndicalism in any way. According to him, the name appeals based on the second internationale."
 scandinavia.12.a: "Hmm, suspicious!"

 scandinavia.13.t: "Formation of the Conservative Party"
 scandinavia.13.d: "Several conservative parties around the federation have announced a fusion to optimally partake in the federal elections that are to be held soon. This alliance includes the Norwegian Høyre party as well as both the Danish Venstre party and the Danish KF party, which has left experts predicting that Denmark will be the main base of this party, even if it will still be a hotly contested region considering the strong presence of the social democrats. In Sweden, the traditional conservatives have joined this party, although some among them look with a certain suspicion to the limited commitment to some of the values of conservatism embraced in this new party, despite the name. Some members of the Swedish riksdag abandoned the party even completely when they agreed to join, leaving them independents."
 scandinavia.13.a: "We wish them luck!"

 scandinavia.14.t: "Formation of the Liberal Party"
 scandinavia.14.d: "Board members from the Swedish Folkpartiet, the Danish Radikale Venstre and the Norwegian Venstre parties have declared their intention in the federal capital of Göteborg today to run together as the Liberal Party in the soon-to-be-held Nordic elections. As this group is composed of mostly smaller parties, experts predict that they will have a difficult time actually winning these elections, but they might well become influential as a smaller party as the junior party in a future coalition."
 scandinavia.14.a: "Good luck with that!"

 scandinavia.15.t: "The Unification of Trade Unions"
 scandinavia.15.d: "As it becomes clear that the Nordic countries are starting to embark on a united path, the labour movement has not been sitting still. The Trade Union Congresses of Denmark, Sweden and Norway have convened in the Swedish capital of Stockholm. Here they voted to unify all three organisation into an even higher congress known as the Nordic Trade Union Congress. Unsurprisingly, the syndicalist elements followed suit in this, in spite of their alleged opposition to the Nordic project, meaning a unified syndicalist cause now exists on the Nordic level."
 scandinavia.15.a: "Lightly worrying indeed..."

 scandinavia.16.t: "Ratification of the Constitution"
 scandinavia.16.d: "The Federal Constitution has been formalised. In a festive ambiance, it has been symbolically accepted by the federal parliament and then been signed by the each of the monarchs of the member states in the new federal capital of Göteborg. With this, the Federation has finally been made official and the constitution has been empowered. A truly glorious day for the boreal nations of Scandinavia!"
 scandinavia.16.a: "Hurrah!"

 scandinavia.17.t: "Switching of the Guard"
 scandinavia.17.d: "As the constitution provides, the chairman of the federation revolves between the monarchs of the constituent member states. 2 years have passed, and it is time for the next monarch to take this role upon themselves."
 scandinavia.17.a: "Hurrah!"

 scandinavia.18.t: "Formation of the Farmer's Party"
 scandinavia.18.d: "Agrarian parties are a curious phenomenon in Northern European, especially Scandinavian politics that defend the interests. Naturally, they did not sit still as the Nordic countries are uniting and they too have formed their own unified party to compete in the elections."
 scandinavia.18.a: "More concise parties are always good!"

 scandinavia.19.t: "The Formation of the Nordic Federation"
 scandinavia.19.d: "Delegates from Sweden, Norway and Denmark convened this morning in Stockholm to finalise a resolution for the federalisation of the three countries into one entity. Known now as the Nordic Federation, many political analysts have been debating what this will mean for the future of the balance of power in Europe. While some believe that the liberal ideas of the federation align with the interests of the Entente, most agree that the new nation will likely take a stance of neutrality on all matters. The balance of power once again shifts on the world stage."
 scandinavia.19.a: "The Northern Lights Shine Bright"
