Like our forefathers who fought to keep the union, so shall we once again unite this dear country of liberty from falling into permanent anarchy."

 PSA_deWitt_plan_idea: "DeWitt Reform Plan"
 PSA_deWitt_plan_idea_desc: "With the approval of the new national congress and the appointment of John L. DeWitt as Chief of Staff of the Western Defense Command, we're now preparing for a long war with the objective of securing our holdings after each advance instead of trying to achieve a quick victory."
 PSA_Marshall_plan_idea: "Marshall Plan"
 PSA_Marshall_plan_idea_desc: "With the approval of the new national congress and the appointment of John C. Marshall as Chief of Staff of the Western Defense Command, we're now preparing for a fast war with the objective of knocking out the enemy before we get bogged down on the West behind the Rockies. As Marshall puts it, he believes we will have no chances of success once any one of the enemy factions manages to seize the East Coast and the Midwest in its entirety, and failure to act fast enough will lead to our defeat."
 PSA_the_big_push_westwards: "Operation Glacier"
 PSA_the_big_push_westwards_desc: "After months of preparations and logistical planning, Operation Glacier has begun with the objective to cross the Rockies and take as much land as possible in order to prevent a possible enemy victory."
 PSA_military_industrial_production_1: "Military Industrial Production"
 PSA_military_industrial_production_1_desc: "With many of the national weapons factories being in the control of our enemies, we are forced to draft new contracts with our local enterprises in order to cope with the demand for our army. Luckily for us, plenty of factories in our territory have joined our cause and are more than capable of improving production if the right incentives are given. By redirecting funding from other sectors, we can provide said incentives to these companies and make sure our men stand ready and equipped for war."
 PSA_military_industrial_production_3: "Military Industrial Production"
 PSA_military_industrial_production_3_desc: "With our resounding victory in the civil war, we now count with a formidable military industrial complex. While normally in peace time, this would be time to start redirecting our funding back to civilian uses, storm clouds gather worldwide, and our mighty nation may yet again become embroiled in war. As such, an expansion of the contracts we signed and an increase of our funding to the military sector will help us be prepared for when the next conflict comes knocking."
 PSA_defense_logistics_agency_idea: "Defense Logistics Agency"
 PSA_failed_operation_liberty: "Aftermath of Operation Glacier"
 PSA_failed_operation_liberty_desc: "With the failure of Operation Glacier, general defeatism has taken hold of most of our Army, and the civilian populace grows unsettled at the result of such a costly operation.

 PSA_Operation_Liberty_mission: "Operation Glacier"

However, failure to achieve these goals would undermine morale, and perhaps set us on the path for total defeat..."

 PSA_join_japan: "Align with Japan"
 PSA_join_japan_desc: "The great Pacific is not the only thing we share with the Japanese, for they have shown themselves to uphold the same values of democracy that we hold so dear. After they aided us in the Civil War, it would be only just for us to join the Japanese in their goal of spreading stability, democracy and liberty in the Pacific."

### Army Focuses ###
 PSA_activate_the_Western_Defense_Command: "Create the Western Defense Command"
 PSA_activate_the_Western_Defense_Command_desc: "Since we claim to be the real America, and our Army is officially the United States Army, the command hierarchy remains unclear on many levels. As such, we will push for the creation of the Western Defense Command, an apparent detachment of the Army which will work independently, and will reunite with the Army in structure once the civil war is won."
 PSA_prepare_the_artillery: "Prepare the Artillery"
 PSA_prepare_the_artillery_desc: "The indisputable winner of the Weltkrieg was Artillery. With it, our army may advance over a suppressed enemy, as well as stop any enemy offensive dead in its tracks.

 PSA_joint_chiefs_of_staff: "Joint Chiefs of Staff"
 PSA_joint_chiefs_of_staff_desc: "The creation of a high command able to coordinate army, air, and naval efforts is needed to win this war, and keep our military up to date with modern theoretical standards."
 PSA_defense_logistics_agency: "Defense Logistics Agency"
 PSA_defense_logistics_agency_desc: "America is an enormous country, full of varied terrain. We need to create a centralised logistics board able to coordinate warfare across the varied biomes of America."
 PSA_deWitt_in_Charge: "CIC: John Lesesne DeWitt"
 PSA_deWitt_in_Charge_desc: "Major General John Lesesne DeWitt, unlike many members of the staff who advocate for us to aggressively assault the enemy positions, has proposed for us to focus on more careful advances with powerful consolidations. In his view, slow and steady advances paired up with a centralised high command will see our nation through this civil war. With him as Commander in Chief, America shall be free once again!"
 PSA_Marshall_in_command: "CIC: George Catlett Marshall"
 PSA_Marshall_in_command_desc: "Brigadier General George Catlett Marshall, has come to us with a damning prediction: If the West Coast fails to cross the Rockies and secure a foothold in the Midwest, then defeat will be assured. In his view, a quick advance through the Rockies with the help of motorised elements will be what see us through this civil war. With him as Commander in Chief, America shall be free once again!"
 PSA_protecting_Columbia: "Protecting Columbia"
 PSA_protecting_Columbia_desc: "The Army War College, the Field Artillery School, Fort Benning and many other major buildings, locations and training sites have been damaged by the war, and their reconstruction should be one of our top priorities to bring the Army back on its feet now that the civil war is over."
 PSA_military_research: "Military Research"
 PSA_military_research_desc: "While we have some of the finest universities and thinkers in the world, we cannot research everything at once. We need to pick a direction for our military research to focus in."
 PSA_weapon_designs: "New Weapon Designs"
 PSA_weapon_designs_desc: "While the M1 Garand managed to see us through the Civil War, its flaws were as noticeable when it was adopted as they are now. However, with the criticism we have gathered during the civil war, we have contacted the original designer, and he has assured us that by redesigning the barrel, gas cylinder, and front sight assembly, he will make the Garand an even more reliable and deadly weapon."
 PSA_Army_rangers: "Army Rangers"
 PSA_Army_rangers_desc: "An elite group of specialised soldiers, the Army Rangers will be able to carry out covert missions in rough terrain, disrupting enemy supply lines and morale."
 PSA_90_division_Army: "90-Division Army Plan"
 PSA_90_division_Army_desc: "While Marshall originally envisioned that a reformed US Army would require a 265-Division Plan to be fully mobilised, the limitations of the West Coast make such a plan a pipe dream. As such, he has decided to adopt a 90-Division Plan, with the objective of raising a total of at least 90 divisions against America's enemies."
 PSA_motorization: "Motorisation Program"
 PSA_motorization_desc: "With the original rejection of the motorisation plans, a ghost has loomed the American Army as their methods became backwards as opposed to other militaries. Marshall has now proposed the government to subsidise truck production and to being the seizure of civilian trucks for the creation of motorised units capable of crossing the American countryside before our enemy can react."
 PSA_tank_production: "Increase Tank Production"
 PSA_tank_production_desc: "With the West Coast's low manpower, the High Command has had to design a plan to effectively improve what every man is worth in the field. In any of those plans, expanding Tank production in the West Coast comes as a priority, as their relatively low manpower cost and high combat effectiveness proves that it will not only save us lives, but also helps us push the enemy back more swiftly."
 PSA_Officer_instruction: "Officer Instruction"
 PSA_Officer_instruction_desc: "Marshall has presented this issue to our government, and his solution is to create forward study-bases, with more experienced officers mentoring younger ones in tactics. While this may put more of our officers in the line of fire, it will also ensure our new generation of officers gets first hand experience, as well as improving our army's leadership on the lower echelons as a whole."
 PSA_recon_units: "Reconnaissance Units"
 PSA_recon_units_desc: "Knowledge is Power, and Marshall believes that without the former two, victory in America will be impossible. We are outmanned and outgunned by our enemies, but if we know their every movement, then we can nullify our enemy's superiority by out-witting them."
 PSA_start_operation_glacier: "Start Operation Glacier"
 PSA_start_operation_glacier_desc: "'The Object of Operation Glacier is to secure a lodgement area on the Midwest from which further offensive operations can be developed. The lodgement area must contain sufficient infrastructural support to maintain a force of at least fifteen divisions across the Rockies, preferably double that amount, and that also enable that force to be augmented by reinforcements from the West Coast area(...)'"
 PSA_defense_is_the_best_offense: "Defence is the Best Offence"
 PSA_defense_is_the_best_offense_desc: "The First step towards preparing for the coming storm will be to improve our defence construction. Trench digging and fortifications construction will be a basic part of our army's curriculum, so that when the enemy waves come and threaten our home, we shall prevail."
 PSA_logistic_security: "Logistical Security"
 PSA_logistic_security_desc: "Logistics are a not-so well known battlefield which will be vital for us if we wish to gain the upper hand against the radicals in the East. Investing into new munitions factories to keep our men fighting as well as funding our logistical corps should go a long way into helping us achieve this goal."
 PSA_Expand_the_Presidio: "Expand the Presidio of San Francisco"
 PSA_Expand_the_Presidio_desc: "The Presidio of San Francisco has a long tradition of being vital for our nation's war efforts since America occupied it in 1846. As it stands, it is the most logical seat of power to direct our army's efforts, as well as the best prepared facility in the West Coast to hold the Command Staff. However, being the best prepared facility the region doesn't mean it's up to standard, and an expansion of the Fort is required."
 PSA_improve_bite_and_hold_tactics: "Improve 'Bite and Hold' Tactics"
 PSA_improve_bite_and_hold_tactics_desc: "The 'Bite and Hold' tactic was first adopted by the British during the Weltkrieg, and as the tactic, while costly, proved to be a resounding success, now more than ever we need to look at its success and analyse how we can improve it so that we may have the best attack and consolidation tactics America has to offer."
 PSA_engineer_corps_expansion: "Expand the Engineer Corps"
 PSA_engineer_corps_expansion_desc: "America has some of the largest rivers in the world, including the Mississippi, Rio Grande, and the Colorado. We should ensure our engineers have the proper tools required to build fording equipment and other field fortifications."
 PSA_coast_to_coast_planning: "'Coast-to-Coast' Planning Board"
 PSA_coast_to_coast_planning_desc: "With the Expanded Presidio, DeWitt has proposed the creation of a Planning board, capable of issuing new and adaptable plans for our front line commanders so that we may push our enemies from sea to shining sea."
 PSA_increase_military_spending: "Increase Military Spending"
 PSA_increase_military_spending_desc: "The Civil War devastated the American Civilian industry, but has made the Military Industry quite a profitable enterprise. While the Civil war may be over, America still has enemies to fight and wars to win, and as such keeping the Civil War military spending and expanding upon it is on our best interests."
 PSA_bring_the_complex_west: "Rebuild the Military Industrial Complex"
 PSA_bring_the_complex_west_desc: "With most of the Military Industrial Complex in the East, the Civil War has devastated the old munitions and weapons factories that made up America's war industry as they became high value targets for bombings and a preferred hiding spot of persistent enemy defenders. If we wish to be ready for the next war, investing into rebuilding the military industrial complex is one of our priorities."
 PSA_Columbia_needs_you: "Columbia Needs You!"
 PSA_Columbia_needs_you_desc: "The Figure of Columbia, a woman wearing an American flag gown and a Phrygian hat, is the personification of the ideals of freedom and pursuit of liberty we fought so hard to achieve. With the tyrant overthrown and the radicals put down, the service of the American people to Columbia is not yet over. War looms in the horizon, and only the brave men of America can protect her and our nation from tyranny."
 PSA_defense_contracts: "Defence Contractors"
 PSA_defense_contracts_desc: "Unlike some command-style economies in Europe, we must rely on contractors to produce our weapons. Ensuring these companies are prepared for this new Civil War should be a top priority."
 PSA_crossing_the_rockies: "Crossing the Rocky Mountains"
 PSA_crossing_the_rockies_desc: "The Rocky Mountains is a formidable geographic formation that separates our beloved West Coast from the carnage in the East. However, with our fate being to reclaim the rest of America, we will have to cross the Rocky Mountains eventually and face our enemies. As such, we should begin preparations for a smoother campaign through them."
 PSA_gi_bill: "The G.I. Bill"
 PSA_gi_bill_desc: "Massive numbers of demobilised servicemen will be a major issue in the aftermath of the Civil War. We should create education and job training programs to better reintegrate them into civilian life."
 PSA_war_bonds: "War Bonds"
 PSA_war_bonds_desc: "We need adequate funding to properly fight this war. Bonds are a popular way of fundraising, and we can easily promote them through cartoons, films, and other popular mediums."
 PSA_walkie_talkies: "Walkie-Talkies"
 PSA_walkie_talkies_desc: "Portable radios, or 'Walkie-Talkies' as they are commonly called, present a powerful tool for our army. With them, our troops can coordinate artillery and air strikes, among other things."

### Navy Focuses ###
 PSA_navy: "U.S. Navy"
 PSA_navy_desc: "The American navy was once the pride of the world. Yet much of it deserted to the traitors to the east. We should review what forces stayed loyal to our government, so we can best determine how they can serve in this war."
 PSA_great_white_fleet: "Great White Fleet"
 PSA_great_white_fleet_desc: "The Great White Fleet was the height to American naval power. We should look back at it for inspiration. A great fleet of battleships and dreadnoughts will ensure we always have naval superiority."

 PSA_coast_guard: "U.S. Coast Guard"
 PSA_coast_guard_desc: "Restoring the Coast Guard will ensure that trade moves smoothly, criminals are stopped at sea, and those in danger are rescued."
 PSA_light_cruisers: "Light Cruiser Development"
 PSA_light_cruisers_desc: "Lighter cruisers are important in anti-air operations, as well as attacking enemy destroyers and submarines. We should ensure our navy has a handful of these in order to stay balanced."
 PSA_naval_aviation: "Naval Aviation"
 PSA_naval_aviation_desc: "Naval aviation is the future of warfare on the high seas. We should ensure that our air designs are capable of being launched from carriers and destroying the enemy fleet without even endangering our own."
 PSA_expand_dockyards: "Expand Dockyards"
 PSA_expand_dockyards_desc: "Our dockyards are somewhat inadequate to fight a war on their own. We need to ensure that new naval production facilities are constructed to support the war effort."
 PSA_submarines: "Submarine Development"

 PSA_expand_the_waves: "Create the WAVES"

 PSA_expand_marine_corps: "Improve the Marine Corps"
 PSA_expand_marine_corps_desc: "The Marine Corps was the epitome of American power projection around the globe. From the shores of Tripoli to the halls of Montezuma, the Marines were always there. We should ensure they have modern equipment and training."

 PSA_naval_training_desc: "While the Naval Academy in Annapolis was destroyed in the fighting of the Civil War, we still have plenty of facilities able to train a new generation of naval leaders and sailors."

### Air Force Focuses ###
 PSA_Create_The_USAF: "Create the USAF"
 PSA_Create_The_USAF_desc: "Before the war, the American Army Air Corps was, as its name suggests, little more than a branch of the Army. In this new war, we need to ensure it is independent and gets the support it needs."

 PSA_Re_Establish_The_ACTS: "Re-establish the ACTS"
 PSA_Re_Establish_The_ACTS_desc: "The Air Force Tactical School was the officer training school for the old Army Air Corps. Given the results of the civil war, it is clear that we must rebuild the ACTS in order to better prepare our air forces."

 PSA_Expand_The_WASPs: "Expand the WASPs"
 PSA_Expand_The_WASPs_desc: "Women can fly a plane just as well as a man can, and can provide many valuable auxiliary tasks, freeing up men for other duties. While socially controversial, this will be an invaluable step in winning the war."

 PSA_The_Screaming_Eagles: "The Screaming Eagles"
 PSA_The_Screaming_Eagles_desc: "Airborne divisions are a new development in warfare, but one that promises to hold significant bonuses. We should investigate creating our own airborne units."

 PSA_Airfield_Expansion: "Airfield Expansion"
 PSA_Airfield_Expansion_desc: "The range of our fighters and bombers are limited by the airfields to which they are attached. By improving both the quality and quantity of these airfields, we will be able to strike more targets more frequently."

 PSA_Bomber_Development_desc: "Our Air Force leadership led by Harold Arnold is convinced that a strong bomber force can bring our enemies to their knees. Following their advice, we shall "

 PSA_New_Fighter_Models: "New Fighter Models"
 PSA_New_Fighter_Models_desc: "While many are confident that the bomber will always get through, we must hedge our bets on that. New fighters will serve us well on both offence and defence."

 PSA_Naval_Support: "Naval Support"
 PSA_Naval_Support_desc: "Our navy is not invulnerable, and there is a genuine concern that they might not be able to win every high seas battle that they need to win. By investing in some naval bombers, we can even the odds by striking any hostile ships in range of our air bases."

 PSA_Long_Range_Interceptors: "Long Range Interceptors"
 PSA_Long_Range_Interceptors_desc: "While having better bombers is vital to win the war of tomorrow at the enemy's doorstep, these bombers can seldom operate on their own. They will need an escort capable of facing off enemy fighters and come back in one piece. Luckily for us, plane designer Kelly Johnson has contacted us with a new and innovative design: The P-38, dubbed 'The Lightning'."

 PSA_Strategic_Bomber_Development: "Strategic Bomber Development"
 #Intentionally playing up 'The Bomber Always Gets Through' here.:
 PSA_Strategic_Bomber_Development_desc: "Tactical bombers are all well and good for supporting the men on the ground, but the true potential of bombers lies in Strategic Bombers. When they get through, enemy cities and industry are left in ruins, and the will of the enemy to continue the war is shattered. A large fleet of strategic bombers will make us very powerful."

 PSA_Strategic_Disruption: "Strategic Disruption"
 #We are as dwarves seated upon the shoulders of giants.:
 PSA_Strategic_Disruption_desc: "Now that we have the bombers we need, we must develop theories and training to make the best use of them. Hap Arnold and the old Bomber Mafia have formed a solid foundation for our theories, now we shall develop their theories and see more and further than they."

 PSA_Expand_The_Bomber_Force: "Expand the Bomber Force"
 PSA_Expand_The_Bomber_Force_desc: "Our early experiments in developing a Bomber Force has proven promising. Now is the time to go all in on bombing the enemy into submission! Leave nothing but rubble!"

 PSA_anti_unionism_desc: "One of the first pieces of legislation we must pass is the new Anti-Syndicalism Act, which will prevent anyone who ever registered as a member of the SPA from holding public office.

 PSA_support_business: "Support Businesses"
 PSA_support_business_desc: "While the unchecked capitalist excesses of the Republican party are a step too far, we still must ensure that businesses have the proper support from the government. Anti-syndicalist regulations are a key step on this path."

 PSA_public_schooling_desc: "Public schools must be adequately funded, and more importantly, they must have the correct curriculum. Teaching our children the importance of freedom, democracy, and liberty - as well as the evils of radicalism and syndicalism - is key to the future of our country."
 PSA_america_business_is_business: "America's Business is Business"
 PSA_america_business_is_business_desc: "American industry was the backbone of our country. While the ravages of the Civil War have destroyed much of our once-prosperous commercial sector, with the proper amount of government action it can be brought back into prominence."
 PSA_immigration_act: "Immigration Act"
 PSA_immigration_act_desc: "While some may say immigration is the backbone of our country, we have more pressing concerns then letting more people into our destroyed country. Rebuilding our once-great country should take precedence."
 PSA_hays_code: "Hay's Code"
 PSA_hays_code_desc: "While everyone enjoys a good film now and then, the unchecked moral excesses of Hollywood need to be clamped down on. A strict code of conduct for actors and producers is required to avoid the spread of syndicalist messaging in films."
 PSA_american_laisze_faire: "Laissez Faire Economics"
 PSA_american_laisze_faire_desc: "Too much government intervention will only harm rebuilding. We need to ensure that we are not overly interfering in our economy as it struggles to rebuild from the Civil War."

 PSA_moral_education_desc: "Higher education has long been a bastion of the elite, and it should be kept that way. The prestigious halls of the Ivy Leagues are no place for those not prepared.

 pacificstates.1.d: "Despite the chaos in San Diego, elections proceeded in an orderly fashion in many other cities along the Pacific Coast, with limited unrest. General MacArthur is said to be furious at this open flouting of the sanctity of law and order, and declared that the new 'so-called president' would be subject to the same punishments as Huey Long and Jack Reed if he did not immediately surrender the coast to the federal government. The mood in the western states is one of defiance, and the leader they have elected as the interim head of the American government is..."

 pacificstates.50.a: "Form the Committee."
 pacificstates.50.b: "Don't form the Committee."

 pacificstates.51.t: "Hay's Code and Movies"
 pacificstates.51.d: "Hollywood has decided to create the so called Hay's Code, named after Will H. Hays, leader of the motion picture association of America. The stated goal of this legislation is to ensure 'morality' in film, though many see it as a way to subvert syndicalist themes in films. Its effectiveness may be somewhat dubious, however, as a number of directors have shown great pleasure in skirting as close to the rules of the code as possible without breaking it."
 pacificstates.51.a: "This shall make movies better."

 pacificstates.52.t: "Anthem for America"
 pacificstates.52.d: "The United States does not have an official anthem and today a debate within Congress has been picked up to declare a song to be the anthem. Four songs have been chosen as the possible candidates. Which one shall Congress pick?"

During the Wilson and McAdoo administrations the Klan experienced a major rebirth and then decided to join the would-be tyrant Huey Long. We should use the laws to make sure that these terrorist traitors do not find any rest within America."
 pacificstates.56.a: "Death to the Klan!"

 pacificstates.57.t: "Labour Laws"
 pacificstates.57.d: "A set of laws have recently been proposed to Congress that would for the first time establish a federal minimum wage and Maximum hours per week. The Minimum wage law would set the hourly wage at 25 cents an hour, while the maximum hours law would establish a forty hour work week. These laws are being packaged together in congress meaning that if one fails or passes so does the other. What will congress do?"

 pacificstates.62.t: "The Immigration Debate"
 pacificstates.62.d: "The situation the Federal Government arrived at when the Pacific States was created did not offer us time to clarify the policy of immigration. This meant that a deal being planned by the Department of Labor to allow for Mexican labour temporary work rights in the United States was frozen for a time. Now that elections have been held and Democrat power retained, we can now address this concern. This programme proposed by the Department of Labor was meant to alleviate the west's employment shortage and was supported by the Republicans. Now traditionally our party line is to respect the Alien Exclusion act and the rights of natural born American workers to determine the direction of the economy, but our employment shortage is that much greater as we struggle to reclaim America. Perhaps we should allow this through?"
 pacificstates.62.a: "Yes, we need the labour."
 pacificstates.62.b: "No, our ideals take precedence."

 pacificstates.63.t: "Hollywood Bookkeeping"
 pacificstates.63.d: "The decision to promote true American values with a closer relationship with Hollywood seemed smart initially. However, the glitz and glamour of Hollywood shady accounting practices that confound our ability to measure returns. Patriotic productions privately financed receive royalties out of gross sales, which have been very high. However, the deal we accepted was on profits, which appear to be next to nothing. This inconsistency needs to be renegotiated, and the studios be told that such creative accounting cannot fly with the American government!"
 pacificstates.63.a: "Maybe we can tax the popcorn?"

 pacificstates.64.t: "Pacific Movement of the Eastern World Uncovered"
 pacificstates.64.d: "We initially thought that our intelligence service was overreactive when they warned us of Japanese infiltration, but this revelation justifies the time spent. Our of our new West Coast operations, agents uncovered pamphlets sent to prominent Japanese and African-American leaders questioning the validity of our government. These pamphlets were traced to an organisation called the Pacific Movement of the Eastern World, whose leadership appears to advocate in favour of a Pacific Japanese Alliance that advocates for unrestricted imperial growth of Japan in Asia. This organisation appears to target non-Chinese ethnic minorities with promises of greater social freedom. We have arrested the conspirators, but we were unable to tie them to the Japanese embassy surprisingly."
 pacificstates.64.a: "What a strange group."

 pacificstates.65.t: "Communalism and the Latter-Day Saints Church"
 pacificstates.65.d: "The Church of Jesus Christ and Latter-Day Saints, better known as Mormons, have expressed sentiments in recent months to strengthen the ideals of Communalism within the church in order to counter the sway of syndicalism. Notably the Church has come out with a faith-based welfare programme, called coincidentally enough the Church Welfare Program, to help provide for support for fellow Mormons, furthermore the programme calls for more Bishop Storehouses to be created. Due to the churches influence in the western states, this has also translated into increased support for the Progressive and Farmer-Labor Parties."
 pacificstates.65.a: "Support Communalism as the antidote to."

 pacificstates.71.t: "Lavender Scare"
 pacificstates.71.d: "With the so-called Red Scare under way, [PSA.GetLeader] has passed Executive Order 10450 that broadened the definition of a national security risk to include 'Any criminal, infamous, dishonest, immoral, or notoriously disgraceful conduct, habitual use of intoxicants to excess, drug addiction, or sexual perversion.'. This has led to the firing of over 5,000 federal employees who were accused of being homosexual."
 pacificstates.71.a: "We shall keep America safe."

 pacificstates.72.t: "Amelia Earhart and the ninety-nines"
 pacificstates.72.d: "With the civil war now over, Amelia Earhart has restarted the Ninety-Nines dedicated to promoting and supporting women to become aviators. A number of these pilots have sought to enter the air force through the WASP organisation."
 pacificstates.72.a: "There's more to life than being a passenger."

 pacificstates.74.t: "Railway Nationalisation"
 pacificstates.74.d: "One of the Democrat policies it has sought for some time was a nationalisation of the countries Railroads. Now that they have power, the question is how exactly shall railway nationalisation go. Congress is debating between two different proposals for how this shall be implemented. The first proposal is that the railroads will be nationalised but not the cars allowing for private businesses to compete among themselves for customers, while the second plan would include the cars in the nationalisation. Which version shall Congress go with?"
 pacificstates.74.a: "Nationalise just the Track."
 pacificstates.74.b: "Nationalise both the Track and the Cars."

 pacificstates.76.t: "Howard Hughes and Aviation"
 pacificstates.76.d: "Howard Hughes has made his name through his businesses that dealt with aviation and many of those planes were designed by himself or approved by him. The war did not dim his love of aviation, still strong as ever - and he believes that what will be beneficial for the America is to have a strong air force and aviation industry. To that end, working with both military and civilian leadership, he has spearheaded the formation of the Federal Aviation Administration. The FAA will have all authority over regulating civilian aviation, including air safety regulations, air navigation and traffic control as well as promote the aviation industry. Hughes believes that this will usher in an age of aviation for America."
 pacificstates.76.a: "To the skies!"

 pacificstates.101.t: "Perez v. Sharp"
 pacificstates.101.d: "The case involving the marriage of Andrea Perez to Sylvester Davis has finally reached the Supreme Court. Andrea Perez is classified as White while Sylvester Davis is considered Negro as per the US Census. However, California's law forbids "All marriages of white persons with Negroes, Mongolians, members of the Malay race, or mulattoes are illegal and void" and that "no license may be issued authorising the marriage of a white person with a Negro, mulatto, Mongolian or member of the Malay race". Consequently county clerk W. G. Sharp followed California Law and refused to give them their marriage licenses.\n\nHowever, Perez with the help of their lawyer, Daniel G. Marshall, brought forth a Writ of Mandamus. Within the trial, one of the arguments that was brought up was the fact that both Perez and Davis were Catholic and wanted a Catholic Marriage that included mass. By denying them the license, they stated that the state was depriving them of the Holy Sacrament of Matrimony.\n\nHowever, the fate of their case is within the hands of the Supreme Court. What shall be decided?"
 pacificstates.101.a: "4-3 the ban is overturned."
 pacificstates.101.b: "3-4 the ban is kept."

 pacificstates.102.t: "Sleepy Lagoon Murder"
 pacificstates.102.d: "In Los Angles news has been made of José Gallardo Díaz, who was recently found murdered near a swimming hole in Commerce, near LA. However, what made the story more newsworthy was the case of the men who are accused of murdering the man. The LA Police found a gang of 17 Men, of Mexican-American descent, nearby and believe that they are responsible for the crime. This has attracted something of a media circus as activists have tried to protest the actions claiming that these men are not the killer and are innocent, the fact that there is insufficient evidence to link them. Despite this nine of them were convicted of second-degree murder and sentenced to serve time in San Quentin Prison, with the rest being imprisoned in Los Angeles County jail.\n\nThe case has generated much animosity within the white populace towards Mexican-Americans, not helped by the fact that both the Police and the Press have characterised all Mexican Youths as 'pachuco hoodlums and baby gangsters.'"

 pacificstates.103.t: "Zoot Suit Riots"
 pacificstates.103.d: "With the war going on, rations have been imposed upon the public. Despite this, some within the Mexican-American Community fount this by wearing Zoot Suits that use materials that are needed for the war effort. Many White Americans regard wearing the Zoot Suit as a sign of criminality and loose morals. Tensions have continued in Los Angeles to rise till they exploded into violence. Soldiers and Sailors beat and engaged in rioting against the Mexicans. Meanwhile, the local press tended to praise the Sailors and Soldiers of 'having a cleansing effect to rid Los Angeles of Miscreants and Hoodlums'. One journalist on the scene, Carey McWilliams, wrote:\n\n'Marching through the streets of downtown Los Angeles, a mob of several thousand soldiers, sailors, and civilians, proceeded to beat up every zoot suiter they could find. Pushing its way into the important motion picture theatres, the mob ordered the management to turn on the house lights and then ran up and down the aisles dragging Mexicans out of their seats. Streetcars were halted while Mexicans, and some Filipinos and Negroes, were jerked from their seats, pushed into the streets and beaten with a sadistic frenzy'"

 pacificstates.104.t: "Zoot Suit Riots"
 pacificstates.104.d: "In the city of Los Angeles in [From.GetNameDef], young Mexicans and Mexican-Americans have viciously been beaten. Their shops have been looted and more atrocities have been lumped upon them. The Gringo Press has even joined in on the action urging them to continue with their actions. To many within the Mexican Congress, this is an outrage. Our own citizens who have gone to America for temporary work, not to mention those with ties to Mexico due to ancestral are being mistreated. A letter to the [From.GetAdjective] State department will make sure that this is stopped."

 pacificstates.105.d: "Following the Zoot Suit Riots, the Mexican government lodged a complaint with the United States State department. To calm tensions between America and Mexico, the McGucken Committee has been created lead by the Archbishop of Los Angeles, Joseph Thomas McGucken. The report concluded that Racism was clearly at the centre of the riots as well as stating 'an aggravating practice (of the media) to link the phrase zoot suit with the report of a crime.' The governor of California appointed the Peace Officers Committee on Civil Disturbances, chaired by Robert W. Kenny, president of the National Lawyers Guild to make recommendations to the police. Human relations committees were appointed, and police departments were required to train their officers to treat all citizens equally"

 pacificstates.106.d: "Today opens the California Pacific International Exposition in San Diego. The Exposition was held to promote San Diego and support its economy, which had slowed with the country's Great Depression in 1925. The exposition had hundreds of exhibits on history, the arts, horticulture, ethnic cultures, science, and industry. Some concessions and exhibits were unusual, such as the Gold Gulch, Lost Continent of Mu, Zoro Garden Nudist Colony, and the 'One Ton Mechanical Man.'. The Expo attracted 7,220,000 visitors during its 377 days of operation. Visitors brought US$$37,700,000 to San Diego. The exposition was so popular that some buildings are being rebuilt to be made permanent."

 pacificstates.107.d: "Orson Welles has released Citizen Kane that has quickly earned praise from numerous film goers and critics alike. Many are considering it a ground-breaking film for its cinematography, music, and editing. It is a quasi-biographical movie about the fictional Charles Foster Kane, a newspaper editor. In the movie Kane's career in the publishing world is born of idealistic social service, but gradually evolves into a ruthless pursuit of power. However, despite all of this, William Randolph Hearst is furious at the film refusing for his papers to even publish the film and run defamatory attacks on those that did. Despite his outrage, this hasn't stopped people from going to see it."

 pacificstates.109.d: "San Francisco is sometimes called the Paris of the West. Thus to help make it one of the cultural centres of the world, a week long event in spring dedicated to Fashion.

 pacificstates.110.d: "A court case has reached the Supreme Court of [Root.GetNameDef] regarding the studio system that had been a legal battle for several years. The issue at the heart of the case was the Studio System where the major movie industries would own the theatres outright. After a number of years of back and forth it has reached the supreme court. The Supreme Court ruled against the studio system declaring that it was a volition of the anti-trust laws. This court case has thus struck down the studio system and marks the end of an age for Hollywood."
 pacificstates.110.a: "The end of the studio system."

 pacificstates.111.t: "Superweapons on a budget"
 pacificstates.111.d: "In the last few years our military research has focused on the potential for internal conflict, narrowing our focus and budget for longer-term projects. This years' Congressional Budget has fortunately found some money to allocate to a long-term project. Three plans are presented to the military high command to meet and exceed the military projects of our rivals. The first is a rocket by Goddard theoretically capable of delivering explosives from miles away without risking pilot lives. The second is Oppenheimer's planned theoretical bomb using radioactive heavy metals as researched in Austria and Germany. The third is a much cheaper plan as proposed by the eccentric Wilhelm Reich, he claims that a bomb can be made much cheaper using his own physics research."

 pacificstates.112.t: "Goddard's Successful Launch"
 pacificstates.112.d: "At home again in Roswell, New Mexico, Goddard again goes to launch test rockets. The last time he was here, the rockets were smaller than his thigh, and reached only a thousand feet in height. Now the rockets soar miles over the desert and touch down with their dummy weights. Goddard's refusal to detonate explosive rockets on the Continental United States prevent the full scale of the damage to be known."
 pacificstates.112.a: "Good boy Goddard."

 pacificstates.113.t: "Oppenheimer's Bomb a Success"
 pacificstates.113.d: "An invitation by Oppenheimer was sent out to nuclear researchers, physicists, and engineers throughout Europe. The promise of escaping persecution in Europe has resounded most strongly to Jewish scientists, some of whom emigrated to the US for the project. After a year and a half of experimentation and some cooperation with colleagues in Europe, a working atomic bomb is ready to be tested. The skies of Almagordo New Mexico lit up in a flash of destruction as the test bomb Valediction exploded. Oppenheimer later said that the bomb was named after his favourite John Donne poem."
 pacificstates.113.a: "The breath goes now."

 pacificstates.114.t: "Reich's Failed Explosion."
 pacificstates.114.d: "After many delays and several attempts to obfuscate the general staff, Wilhelm Reich's bomb project is discontinued and millions of dollars wasted on bunk. This became apparent to Reich's observers when tests showing his energy, named Orgone, could induce exothermic reactions that only he and his associates could see. The bomb itself being a hollow shell with layers of metals covering that never did explode, save for its collapse when Reich attempted to destroy it during the investigation. This embarrassment is currently making its rounds in the papers."
 pacificstates.114.a: "Not our proudest moment."

 pacificstates.150.t: "The Pacific Declaration"
 pacificstates.150.d: "Ever since the first peaceful transfer of power between George Washington and John Adams, the government of the United States has prided itself on respecting the wishes of its population after an election. This unspoken contract between the people and their government has been violated by General Douglas MacArthur. In deposing the democratically-elected president in the name of 'preserving stability', he shattered the founding principles of our great nation. The destruction of the healthy civil-military relationship that has marked America since independence is a grievous slight to all the values we hold as a nation.\n\nIn response, the governors of California, Washington, and Oregon have issued a joint declaration condemning the General's actions, and demanding his immediate withdrawal from Washington. We doubt he will respond positively, but like the patriots in 1776, we must take a stand against tyranny and oppression."
 pacificstates.150.a: "For the republic!"

 pacificstates.151.t: "Merriam Calls for New Elections"
 pacificstates.151.d: "Frank Merriam, in coordination with the governors of Oregon and Washington, issued a stunning public statement today. In it, he claimed that if the so-called 'protector' of American values could not even respect the basic rights outlined in the Constitution, referring to Douglas MacArthur, it would be up to the people of the Pacific to defend America's inalienable rights. Claiming that MacArthur's overthrow of the government was illegitimate, a new election would be held to select a new president - albeit amongst a limited slate of candidates in the Pacific region. Still, according to Merriam, whoever won this election would still have more legitimacy than MacArthur, and would be tasked with overseeing the return of the nation to democracy - by force, if needs be."
 pacificstates.151.a: "We must preserve the Constitution!"

 pacificstates.152.t: "Syndicalist Riot!"
 pacificstates.152.d: "Following Jack Reed's own declaration of MacArthur's illegitimacy, many hoped that the capitalists and syndicalists could come together and preserve American democracy. Those naive aspirations were dashed when Governor Merriam ordered the National Guard to violently suppress a syndicalist protest which broke out in Sacramento. This escalated into widespread rioting across many Western cities, with Seattle in particular descending into violence. Longshoremen and teamsters broke into Seattle city hall, and proclaimed the city loyal to Reed's workers republic in Chicago. Currently, the city is in a tense stand-off between National Guard units and the rebels holed up in the city hall."
 pacificstates.152.a: "Crush these traitors!"

 pacificstates.153.t: "Election Violence"
 pacificstates.153.d: "Tensions between the Pacific states and Washington have remained high over the last few weeks, but today, in the lead-up to the 'new election', they erupted into open conflict. While some of the ships in Naval Base San Diego were transferred to the East Coast after the first signs of unrest, many remained - along with sailors from across the country. Details are sketchy, but it appears a base commander, on orders from Washington, ordered sailors to take weapons from the base armoury and head into the city. Deploying themselves at polling places, they prevented poll workers from setting up. When morning came, large mobs surrounded these soldiers, and began pelting them with rocks, bottles, and other debris. One of the sailors, hit by a bottle, fired back, and soon the city descended into chaos.\n\nCalifornia National Guard units were deployed, and pitched street battles between sailors loyal to MacArthur and the Guardsmen erupted, turning the tranquil city into a war zone."
 pacificstates.153.a: "Down with the traitors!"

 pacificstates.154.t: "Deadline Looms"
 pacificstates.154.d: "As the federal government's deadline looms, it has become clear there will be no budging on either side. Newly-elected President [Root.GetLeader] has been busy raising militia across the West, amidst a growing determination to see the country restored and MacArthur defied. The federal government, in turn, has also made it clear they no longer see a path to compromise with the Pacific states."
 pacificstates.154.a: "It is only a matter of time."

 pacificstates.200.t: "The Army Requisitions Civilian Trucks"
 pacificstates.200.d: "After Marshall announced his Motorisation program for the W.D.C., a proposal was sent to the President to decide on the requisition of civilian vehicles in order to supply our fast-growing army. With his approval, we have begun seizing vehicles from the civilian populace, although to our surprise, some proud patriots line up next to our storages to volunteer their vehicles for the incoming fight. While not all their vehicles have proven to be useful for us, we have managed to requisition a fair amount of trucks which can either be modified to transport troops with ease or which are sturdy enough to transport our troops at once."
 pacificstates.200.a: "Their Service to Our Nation is Appreciated"

 pacificstates.201.t: "Success of Operation Glacier"
 pacificstates.201.d: "With the capture of the states of Idaho, Utah and Arizona, Operation Glacier has been called a resounding success by our High Command. With the Rockies secured and our industry safely behind it, we now possess a good staging ground to attack the Great Plains and the South, with which we shall drive the radicals back and secure our nation."
 pacificstates.201.a: "We shall soon march on Washington!"

 pacificstates.202.t: "Failure of Operation Glacier"
 pacificstates.202.d: "While Operation Glacier managed to get some territorial gains, the losses were too high with a gain too small to matter for the war effort. As it stands, the Rockies remain disputed ground and our long term survival is in jeopardy. It is now up to the Marshall and the high command to see us through the war by whatever means necessary"
 pacificstates.202.a: "We Must Rethink our Strategy"

 pacificstates.203.t: "Rethinking our Tank Designs"
 pacificstates.203.d: "With the Civil war over, we now have to revise the industrial measures we undertook during the war in order to enhance war-time production. One of these measures was Marshall's request for faster tanks for mass production, which came with the unfortunate drawback of being unreliable on harsh terrain, a trait which unfortunately has caused more than one headache to the newly recruited tank crews of our nation. Since our spending in military affairs shall be increased, some designers have approached us with newer models with better engines and suspension systems which shall ensure no regular breakdowns happen, but in exchange our experts predict our production speed will be reduced. What should we do?"
 pacificstates.203.a: "Let's Focus on more Reliable Models"
 pacificstates.203.b: "Reliability isn't an issue if we can swarm the enemy with tanks!"

 pacificstates.204.t: "Farmer-Labor Sees Massive Gains"
 pacificstates.204.d: "Local newspapers have reported a massive increase in activity by the Farmer-Labor party. While this shift would be understated in previous years, the existence of dictatorial powers in the Federal Government has unsettled many reliable voters in the Pacific States. This shift has reached the provisional Congress in Sacramento, where several minor Representatives have made public statements endorsing Farmer-Labor. To the observers in the rest of the US, this shift validates their concerns that the establishment Democrats and Republicans have become totally estranged from the two party system."
 pacificstates.204.a: "Let's Focus on more Reliable Voters"

 pacificstates.205.t: "The Triumph of Democracy"
 pacificstates.205.d: "With the final defeat of General MacArthur's junta, our government - the righteous government - stands tall over the American continent once more. Just like Abraham Lincoln seventy-five years ago, President [PSA.GetLeader] has saved democracy and the Union. Now that the war is over, the lessons learned from the Crisis of '37 and the war must be studied and applied. While there is indeed much willingness in the government to reform the system, there is no consensus on how to proceed.\n\nSome question whether Presidents Reed and Long should be propagandised as martyrs against the dictatorship of Douglas MacArthur - who all agree was the prime villain of the Civil War - or if they should be dismissed as radical dictators-in-the-making themselves. There are still many sympathisers of both men in the Farmer-Labor, Democratic, and Republican parties, despite declaring both men traitors back in 1937.\n\nWhat is clear is that the military had grown too powerful in pre-war America, even in peacetime, but few know how to reconcile this issue with national defence, and especially with the popularity of General Marshall, who has been offered several government positions already. All these questions and others must now be answered, but by the grace of Almighty God America now has a government ready to try."

 pacificstates.206.d.PSA: "A recent thesis on Bremsstrahlung and the production of radioactive isotopes produced by the nuclear fission of uranium has come from none other than the 28 year old Chien-Shiung Wu, a young and aspiring physicist at the University of California, Berkeley. Hailing from the small town of Lihue in Jiangsu Province, Wu graduated from the top of her class and in 1929 was admitted to university in Nanjing. A teacher at a Shanghai public school, Wu held a close relationship with the school's president, the distinguished Hu Shih who has acted as both a mentor and a second father for Wu. Due to the constant instability that has plagued China and the encouragement of fellow woman researcher Gu Jing-Wei, Wu made the decision to emigrate to the United States in 1936 with the intent to study at the University of Michigan. Wu was shocked at the sexism that lurked in American academia and decided to study at the much more liberal UC Berkeley.\n\nAt Berkeley, Wu's intellect, beauty, and charisma has earned the respect of her mentors such as Robert Oppenheimer and Ernest O. Lawrence while also gaining the admiration of her classmates who have affectionately given her the nickname of “Gee Gee”. Having completed her PhD with her commendable thesis, Oppenheimer and Lawrence have recommended that Wu's research be used for further atomic research."

Magnuson spent two years studying in North Dakota, before spending a brief stint in Canada working jobs with threshing crews. At the behest of a high school girlfriend, he moved to Seattle, Washington, where he would earn his law degree in 1929, and spent the next few years working in various government jobs. He first entered the world of politics by supporting Al Smith's 1928 bid for the presidency and remained active as a Democrat since then, championing opposition to prohibition and eventually entering the Washington House of Representatives in 1933 as a Seattle delegate. Magnuson was then elected to fill a vacancy in the national House, taking his seat in January 1937 - mere months before the country was torn apart by civil war. Opposing MacArthur's takeover, Magnuson defied the odds and escaped Washington, D.C. with the aid of anti-coup elements in the Navy - in return, he would volunteer for the war effort and serve in the Navy for much of the war.\n\nIn 1944, Magnuson entered the Senate on the back of his war record and progressive credentials, famously spearheading efforts to repeal the Chinese Exclusion Act and quickly becoming a poster boy of the Democratic reformist wing. When he announced his intent to run for the presidency in 1952, he was seen as an ideal candidate - nobody, the Democrats argued, better embodied the Pacific cause than a veteran who has dedicated his life to the cause of democracy.

Despite losing his mother at age 11 and developing a case of Bell's palsy that temporarily restrained his ability to speak, he overcame both and enrolled in Hill Military Academy and later The University of the South in Sewanee, Tennessee, developing an affinity for the 18th-century Anglo-Irish conservative philosopher and statesman, Edmund Burke. His studies also drew him towards the field of journalism, which led to him taking a job offer for The New York Times after graduating in 1929.\n\nCain's life, like the rest of America's, was completely upended by the news of MacArthur's coup and the following Californian revolt. Finding MacArthur's actions to be a sick perversion of conservativism, Cain quickly joined up with the fledgling Pacific army, where his previous military schooling was a welcome asset and helped him find a talent for military government, a skill in great demand when dealing with the unprecedented humanitarian crisis brought on by the civil war.

After a largely successful term, the conservative Democrat, long falling out of love with the party, changed his registration to Republican and made a run for the Senate, creating his first brush with controversy by accusing his Democratic opponent of having ties to Socialist front organisations. It would not be his last - the senator rapidly became notorious for his inflammatory conservative stances throughout his term.\n\nCain's rails against the tripartite threat of Socialism, Longism, and MacArthurism carried him to the Republican nomination and the presidency - but now that he's privy to the inner workings of the ongoing committees dedicated to investigating "subversive activities", Cain has shocked everyone by coming out against many of the procedures as violations of civil liberties and due process of law. President Cain is quickly earning a reputation as a man at odds with his past - and a man prepared to make a stand for any opinion, no matter how controversial.§!"

In 1912, when he made a bold move of backing Theodore Roosevelt and his “Bull Moose” third-party revolt, and led the movement's efforts in Wyoming, indirectly helping the Democrats winning the state. The next year, he moved to California with his brother, Stephen, and dedicated the next few years of his life to their law firm and his own real estate ventures. In 1924, re-entered politics in the same way that he left it - by supporting another Progressive's bid for the presidency, this time with Robert La Follette, Sr. By 1932, he had decided to change his party registration to Democratic, and before the end of 1933 declared his intent to run for Governor of California. After his announcement, he was approached by the famous writer Upton Sinclair, who had his own plans to run for governor and was attracted to Downey's progressive past - however, Downey was unwilling to abandon the Democrats for the Socialist Party, and so Sinclair ran without him, while Downey narrowly edged out the Democratic nomination. Both candidates were defeated by the Republican incumbent, Frank Merriam.\n\nDowney's progressive tendencies left him unwilling to tolerate MacArthur's coup, and so he eagerly backed the Sacramento government - but the years went on, and he became more formally involved with the political scene, his own politics began to shift. While the once-dedicated progressive remained a supporter of pensions, old-age insurance, and racial justice, he nonetheless grew increasingly conservative and friendly with the oil, corporate agriculture, and film industries. By the time of the 1944 campaign, his transformation was complete - he sought and won the Democratic nomination and the presidency as a moderate conservative Democrat, with the mission statement of leading a return to normalcy for a still war-torn nation.§!"
