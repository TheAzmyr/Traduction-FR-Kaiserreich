#Main Country Leaders
 MAL_burhanuddin_al_helmy: "Burhanuddin al Helmy"

 MAL_zhuang_mingli: "Zhuang Mingli"
 MAL_zhuang_mingli_leader_desc: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! February 1909, in Quanzhou, Fujian Province, Qing Empire\n§YPolitical Career:§! Zhuang Mingli, or Chuang Ming-li as he is known in Malaysian Cantonese, was born to a Fujian peasant family. Many men in the family had taken up employment abroad, and his father found work as a boatman in the British territory of Penang, on the Malay Peninsula, tragically passing away in 1926.\n\nMingli travelled first to Penang, then to Binjai in the Dutch East Indies, where he found employment at a garage run by one of his uncles. There he got politically involved with overseas Chinese community activists, protesting against European and Japanese exploitation of his homeland. He joined a charity for civilian victims of the Jade Wind Incident and was vice-chairman of a youth group that boycotted foreign goods. These activities caught the eyes of the Dutch and he was deported back to China.\n\nHe sought employment in the factories of Quanzhou but soon became enamoured with radical trade unionism, forcing him to flee to back to Penang in 1930, fearing he would be killed if he remained in China. Mingli joined a number of new political bodies, such as the Fujian Overseas Chinese Salvation Congress held in Singapore, the Penang Philomathic Union founded by Sun Yat-Sen, as well as a number of local guilds and trade unions.\n\nThough only in his 20s, Mingli became one of the most prominent Chinese politicians in all of Malaya, writing fiery socialist screeds in the overseas Chinese press, under the pseudonym "Zhuangjia", which were broadly sympathetic to the KMT's Reorganised Comrades Association. His most notable accomplishment was creating a "Relief Committee for MinGan Refugees and Wounded Soldiers", to support the Kuomintang uprising in 1936.\n\nA credible trade unionist as well as a charismatic champion of freedom and democracy, Mingli became a natural candidate for a high position within the General Labour Union, the pre-eminent trade union in Malaya, but few had expected that he would be made its chairman. He was a compromise between the syndicalists, the anarchists, and the more moderate socialists, a youthful man that nonetheless had the wisdom and experience to be able to unite the squabbling factions behind a shared revolutionary struggle."
