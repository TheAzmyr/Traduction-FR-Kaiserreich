### Intro Screen ###
 WIF_country_intro_header: "Introduction to the West Indies Federation"
 WIF_country_intro_content: "The West Indies Federation has had a troubled history since its creation, with what was initially a divide between Englishmen who did and did not want to incorporate the French colonies evolving into a complete split between French and British culture. The victory of the NCP (National Consolidation Party) in the 1925 elections resulted in the incorporation of French colonies, but with deep socialist roots in them, it immediately grew into chaos.\n\nThis ended with the victory of the UP (Unity Party) and signing of the Cayenne Agreement in 1931. This established the ability for the French to make their own parties and allowed them higher autonomy than the British colonies. While this move turned out well at first, it seems to have only increased tensions in the long run with the moderate right demanding the entire agreement be repealed and replaced with a new one, while the left wants to further increase autonomy for either the French or all territories of the Federation.\n\nA new party, the PA (Parti pour l'Autonomie), a huge mesh of French socialists and liberals along with a smattering of left-leaning British politicians designed to represent the left, was created in 1933. Partially as a response to this, the NCP has steadily been rising in power and popularity again due to a large part of the British population feeling like it got a bad deal in the Cayenne Agreement. Having barely slipped by in the 1933 elections, the Unity Party stands in a dangerous position."

 wifpol.2.t: "Labour Strikes in Guadeloupe"
 wifpol.2.d: "Guadeloupe has always been a hot spot for socialists, even while under French rule, with the majority of the population being left-leaning. The island's recent peace ended today when the recent trend of labour strikes in the British colonies finally spread to the French.\n\nOver two thousand farmers have gone on strike for unfair working conditions and extremely high unemployment rates on the island. There is great worry about this strike growing beyond Guadeloupe itself and becoming something bigger, so the problem will need to be dealt with soon."
 wifpol.2.a: "Arrange a meeting in a week's time"
 wifpol.2.b: "Let them protest"

 wifpol.3.t: "Meeting in Basse-Terere"
 wifpol.3.d: "Today the Governor-General has met with the French protestors along with a translator to try and appease the farmers in Guadeloupe. Although the language gap was hard to breach at first, the farmers' demands have eventually become apparent. They want to dramatically improve working conditions in both the British and French colonies within one and a half years. These terms are seen as difficult to meet, mainly due to the lack of clarity, but with the meeting already over we're left with a choice."
 wifpol.3.a: "We'll try our best"
 wifpol.3.b: "Sorry, lay down clearer terms next time"

 wifpol.4.t: "Reverberations from Black Monday"
 wifpol.4.d: "Our economy has slowly been escaping American reliance since the United Fruit Company merged with the Boston Fruit Company, but complete escape was impossible even with self-rule of the West Indies. This has come to bite us in the back as a consequence of Black Monday. The Great Depression worsening in the United States has hit us and our poor populace hard, and our already small economy has been thrown into even more chaos. Not only that, but the recent Labour Strike Movement might see an increase in activity as well as a result."
 wifpol.4.a: "Our world is shattered"

 wifpol.5.t: "Jamaican Protests"
 wifpol.5.d: "Protests have begun today in Jamaica, complaining about the slowing down of Jamaican development. While the island was traditionally stable before the decade began, Jamaican protests have become a common occurrence, especially compared to some of the other British islands, for many reasons. Economic development has completely halted, though they fund about 42% of the federation, with Guyana and Trinidad & Tobago being the next up in funding. The people grow tired of the lack of development, degrading social standards, cemented rule of governors, and the plantation system still being in use within much of the Federation. While this protest was rather minor compared to others in the past, people fear the steeper economic decline could worsen the political situation of the Federation, and make occurrences like this much more frequent and probably larger."
 wifpol.5.a: "It's always the Jamaicans"

 wifpol.6.t: "The Moyne Commission"
 wifpol.6.d: "With the recently degraded state of the West Indies' economy causing an organised labour movement within the region, this has been a cause for some concern on our part. The Canadian people have always felt close to those within the West Indies Federation, due to a similar upbringing from colony to a British-led federation, increasing their desire for a formalised search into the region and its problems. This has resulted in the formation of the Moyne Commission, expected to go around to each colony within the federation and see exactly what their problems are, starting in the colony of Guiana. The officials in charge of this are Walter Guinness, 1st Baron Moyne as the lead, Dr. Mary Blacklock who works in tropical medicine, Professor F. Engledow who has expertise in agriculture, economist Hubert Henderson, Sir Percy MacKinnon who is representing Canadian financial interests, female liberal politician Cora Taylor Casselman, noted anti-socialist trade unionist Walter Citrine, 1st Baron Citrine, and finally conservative politician Ralph Assheton. Together their objective is to investigate the problems in the West Indies, starting a week from now."
 wifpol.6.a: "Let's hope our worry is unfounded"

 wifpol.7.t: "The Moyne Commission"
 wifpol.7.d: "With the recently degraded state within our country and the many labour strikes plaguing the nation, the Canadian government has decided to send a commission to investigate the situation within our country. This has resulted in the formation of the Moyne Commission, instructed to go around to each colony within the Federation and see exactly what their problems are, starting in the colony of Guiana. The officials in charge of this are Walter Guinness, 1st Baron Moyne as lead, Dr. Mary Blacklock, who works in tropical medicine, Professor F. Engledow, who has expertise in agriculture, economist Hubert Henderson, Sir Percy MacKinnon who is representing Canadian financial interests, female liberal politician Cora Taylor Casselman, noted anti-socialist trade unionist Walter Citrine, 1st Baron Citrine, and finally conservative politician Ralph Assheton. Together their objective is to investigate the problems in the West Indies. They have already embarked for the Caribbean, and they plan to begin a week from now."
 wifpol.7.a: "We'll be sure not to disappoint"

 wifpol.8.t: "The Moyne Commission Surveys Guiana"
 wifpol.8.d: "At their starting place, the Moyne Commission heard many testaments - from the everyday person to the small but slowly increasing trade unions within the region. The main conflict within Guiana has been a very steep divide between Afro- and Indo-Guianese people, with the Afro-Guianese being much more European in mindset and politically active while Indo-Guianese have little to no representation within their region, remaining seen as the lower class of the nation. Afro-Guianese also have better paying jobs, mostly in bauxite mining, while the Indo-Guianese remain traditionally rice farmers.\n\nThe suggestions from the commission have ranged from Sir Percy Mackinnon advising us to attempt to 'civilise' the Indo-Guianese to others like Walter Citrine, who recommends the promotion of non-socialist trade unions as both a counter to the current organised labour movements as well as an aid to regional prosperity."
 wifpol.8.a: "Not the best start for us"

 wifpol.9.t: "The Moyne Commission Surveys Trinidad & Tobago"
 wifpol.9.d: "Previously visited by the Forrester Commission back in 1934 due to its notably high amount of unrest, the Moyne Commission has begun to survey Trinidad & Tobago. Most of what was reported by the people and the Civil Service Association was what was already known before, with the higher class rice plantation owners constantly cracking down on attempts for the workers to gain self-sufficiency, along with problems maintaining its oil holds. The rich amount of oil located in Trinidad & Tobago often spills into the already terrible rice fields, making the process all the harder.\n\nThe recommendations were the same as from the Forrester Commission, with the cracking down of the higher sugar classes on the workers rights from Walter Guinness himself, with others like F. Engledow wanting to see oil production organised to help the people have an easier time producing the rice which the colony feeds itself with."
 wifpol.9.a: "Is it really as bad as the last time?"

 wifpol.11.t: "The Moyne Commission Surveys the Minor Islands"
 wifpol.11.d: "The surveying of the minor islands was significantly easier according to Percy Mackinnon, as many of the problems were much of the same. The sugar farmers are constantly cracked down upon, with small trade unions growing all over. However, among the islands one stood out, Barbados. Barbadians were very fervent about the way they are stomped down upon, and the need to help the trade union movement in order for these islands to further develop to reduce the insane reliance on the 'Big Three'(Trinidad & Tobago, Jamaica, and British Guiana). Some other things of note were the large amount of women in the workforce, leaving many men without jobs, feeding the unemployment within the many islands.\n\nAn incident occurred during this surveying, with Walter Citrine disappearing for a day, apparently going around and showing extreme sympathy for the Barbadians, providing scholarships and very large donations to these fledgling trade unions. He was quickly reined in, but his actions already had their effects, with Barbadians growing more resistant to our government. Despite the incident, the Commission suggests we look into the standards of living in these sugar plantations, and to encourage women to return home to manage the families in order to secure more positions in jobs for men."
 wifpol.11.a: "Barbados sure is rowdy..."

 wifpol.12.t: "The Moyne Commission Surveys the French Colonies"
 wifpol.12.d: "The surveying of the French colonies was a bit more unique in a sense, as a translator was required for the meetings to actually work. The survey process was slow and chaotic, but it has at long last been completed. Conditions on the French islands were similar to British areas, but with fewer plantation issues and more... starvation. Hunger riots have begun to plague the French colonies, as they struggle to get the food they need with people starving on the streets. Many blame this on higher population density of islands like Guadeloupe and Martinique compared to the others, making jobs harder to find especially without the French government available to supply food on demand for the islands when these problems occur. Recommendations have ranged from promoting the development of the islands to ensure more people have jobs in order to feed their families from Hubert Henderson, while F. Engledow wants to increase the amount of government-owned plantations in order to ensure people get the jobs they need so that they can feed themselves and their families. Some others have also recommended that we ask the French for help in feeding these colonies, but it is very doubtful whether they'd even accept such an offer."
 wifpol.12.a: "This is truly embarrassing"

 wifpol.13.t: "The Moyne Commission Surveys Jamaica"
 wifpol.13.d: "What was 'long awaited' by the commission is the most prosperous but also most chaotic of the colonies. Right off the bat, the people furiously protested the plantation economy within the region, with it being a very similar situation to the other colonies, with a richer class forcing the lower to work for a very low wage. This problem was even worse in Jamaica, with its high population density making finding these jobs a much more desperate endeavour, resulting in others searching for... alternative forms of making money. Sponsored by the United Fruit Company itself, people are encouraged to come to Jamaica for 'Summer pleasures with the women' just for the women to be able to scrape by. The rest is a really bad combination of almost everything else, leaving Jamaica to be one of the most profitable but internally undesirable of all the colonies.\n\nWalter Citrine has directly approached representatives of trade unions in Jamaica in order to donate and expand them as an early measure, but many things will need to be done regarding the colony. Possible solutions include reforming the plantation system, opening up more jobs to remove the prostitution problem, and developing other islands to reduce the reliance many have on Jamaica within the federation."
 wifpol.13.a: "Our jewel is never calm"

 wifpol.14.t: "The Moyne Commission Surveys Bermuda and the Bahamas"
 wifpol.14.d: "Bermuda and the Bahamas have always been significantly more stable than the other islands, seeing relative improvement overall. The surveying of the Bahamas noted divides between rich white plantation owners and the black working class, but it is seen as a much more mitigative problem compared to the other colonies, while Bermuda has been more prosperous than it has been for a while now. It has begun to develop a booming tourism industry, with the industry on Bermuda slowly expanding as a result.\n\nNot much has to be done regarding Bermuda, with the Bahamas needing the same treatment as the other colonies, with the need to help the lower class to grow in self sufficiency in order to be able to slowly remove the outdated plantation system."
 wifpol.14.a: "A calm in the storm"

 wifpol.15.t: "The Commission Returns to Canada"
 wifpol.15.d: "The commission officially returned to Canada today, having seen all they wanted to see. We have received a large variety of suggestions from the multitude of people, but it can be summed up as:\n\n1. Move women from the factories to the household, in order to secure jobs for the men so they can earn a living for themselves and their families.\n\n2. Hold checks across the many plantations, ensuring that health standards are kept in check, while also making sure the people are able to work within them in a humane manner.\n\n3. Help to build an education system within the West Indies, in order to ensure the slow gain in self-sufficiency as people grow more knowledgeable, with the end goal of eventually abolishing the plantation system in favour of a modern economy.\n\nAs a more personal suggestion from Walter Citrine, he recommends the slowly birthing West Indies trade unions forge together the beginnings of a new way of life for the region in the form of non-socialist trade unions. As a final suggestion that lies more on their shoulders, they will request overtime funding from the Canadian government to help the development of the West Indies, although it is unknown whether the Canadian government will accept such a deal. For now all we can do is try and implement some of their suggestions before the report is officially released, to prevent as much backlash as possible."
 wifpol.15.a: "We'll try our best..."

 wifpol.16.t: "The Moyne Commission Returns"
 wifpol.16.d: "The Moyne Commission has officially returned today, and their news is not especially pleasant. We have received reports of what they refer to as 'slavery in a different form', with the plantation economy still being the main form of development within the islands. Among this, there are many other problems like United Fruit Company promoted prostitution in Jamaica, class divides in Guiana between Indo and Afro-Guianese, oil spilling in Trinidad & Tobago. Walter Guinness himself said that this generation is suffering from a century of neglect from the empire, and they expect the West Indies government to handle the problem immediately.\n\nNeedless to say, many Canadians are disgusted by the happenings in the West Indies, those who they see are very similar to them in ways. It has left a stain on the imperial family and the current government, one that the West Indies will hopefully erase soon for us."
 wifpol.16.a: "How could it have been so bad?"

 wifpol.17.t: "Suggestions from Walter Guinness and the Commission"
 wifpol.17.d: "Walter Guiness and the rest of the commission have come up with a suggestions to help the situation within the West Indies, and it is a two year fund into the West Indies to help them along their new multitude of projects to help the region. While this will take a toll on our income, it could serve significantly towards helping calm down the rampant socialist movements within the West Indies along with helping them develop their industries along the way."
 wifpol.17.a: "Increase our funding in the region"
 wifpol.17.b: "Surely this isn't our responsibility!"

 wifpol.18.t: "Funding from Canada"
 wifpol.18.d: "Thanks to the Moyne Commission, the imperial government has begun a slow overtime investment into the West Indies economy, granting a large sum over a period of two years. This has helped improve the face of the imperial family and Canada among our people, serving as a good way to calm down the socialist movements along with tensions with the empire. We can also expect to start construction projects to help increase the amount of jobs available within the West Indies overtime as a result. Hopefully this will pay off in the end."
 wifpol.18.a: "Hopefully this can assist us"

 wifpol.19.t: "Canada Refuses Aid"
 wifpol.19.d: "It seems the Moyne Commissions attempt to obtain funding for the development of the West Indies from the imperial government has failed, with it being stamped out in parliament. We are now expected to fund the multitude of projects as a result from the commission using our own measly income. This has also slightly strained relations among our populace, with the socialists suing this as another case of the empires betrayals against our people."
 wifpol.19.a: "We can make it on our own, then"

 wifpol.20.t: "Spreading of Calypso"
 wifpol.20.d: "Calypso which has begun to spread on the islands of Trinidad & Tobago has started to gain popularity not only within the Caribbean, but within the Americas as well. The songs by various Calypso artists like Atilla the Hun and Roaring Lion have been recorded and available for purchase around the world. Calypso is mainly troublesome from a political perspective, as it is used as a way to speak against the government through hidden meanings within their songs. As anti-Federation and anti-British sentiment begins to rise within the Federation, many governors fear the spread of this new style of music could cause people outside of the federation to sympathise with their cause."

This can easily be seen as more continue to be jobless due to the closing of plantations and farms across the various islands, with many worrying about making it to tomorrow without food for their families.

Today was seen as a spark to the people, as a small group of recently unemployed farmers assembled around the capitol building of Kingston protesting against the Unity Party. This crowd eventually began to grow to fifty men. While no one knows who truly started it, a small regiment of police attempted to break up the group until violence eventually broke out. At the end of it, ten of the protestors had been sent to jail with the rest escaping to God knows where. Luckily, we have managed to keep the situation somewhat contained for now, largely preventing the story from spreading to the rest of Jamaica. No one knows what can happen in the future however..."

A few days ago, the fears of such event taking place in Kingston have finally come to pass, as a strike has been successfully called by the Kingston dock-workers of the United Fruit Company, with many other workers joining up their strike in support of their cause with the help of the Trade Union leader Alexander Bustamante.\n\nAs the strike went on, Bustamante travelled from meeting to meeting exhorting the people to stay focused and united and stay on strike for better wages, managing to convince the Transport Workers' and Factory Workers' representatives, almost paralysing the heart of Jamaica and crowding the surroundings of the Queen Victoria Statue. With a rousing speech, Bustamante assured the workers that with this show of solidarity he would be able to go forward and negotiate with the government on their behalf from a position of strength. As policemen began reaching the scene to contain the strikers, Bustamante called upon the people to go home in peace and stay united. However, his calls fell on deaf ears as the strikers began throwing rocks at the police, causing one of the officers to panic and order his troops to start making warning shots. As the situation escalated, the policemen were pushed back as the crowd began to overwhelm them. The crowd began advancing towards the Governor-General House near the intersection of Hagley Park Road and Half Way Tree Road. Hearing the news, the Governor was ordered to evacuate, but thankfully for us the crowd was stopped by the arrival of reinforcements from our police department, managing to break the strike and leading to the arrest of several influential figures, including Bustamante and William Grant. While many consider this to be a close call, our control over the city still stands strong."

However, In spite of his request for non-violence, small scale rioting led by radicalists throughout Kingston paired up with the vandalisation of government buildings has caused significant damage, although our hold on the city still stands strong."

As the situation escalated, more and more disgruntled workers from the Sugar Workers' Unions joined the strike, and the deployment of the Georgetown Garrison from the north towards the Botanical Garden only escalated the situation. When the dust settled, 13 rioters have been found dead, and at least 24 more have been hospitalised for their injuries. While the city now remains silent and solidly under our grasp, this riot marks yet another black chapter in Guyana's history.

Riots sparked in Fort-de-France and Bahie-Mahault, and our local police quickly overwhelmed by the strength of the protestors. Luckily, a marine detachment managed to be deployed in time in order to contain the rioters, but this decision didn't came without a cost however. As our marines weren't prepared to deal with urban unrest, they decided to control the riot by firing on the protestors. Several rioters have been gravely injured and are receiving treatment at their local hospitals. There have been no reports of fatal casualties and we have managed to contain the situation, at least temporarily, and with promises of improved life conditions should prevent another riot from breaking out in the near future."

 wiffor.4.d: "After years have passed since the American civil war started, and Puerto Rico was given to us, its integration in our state apparatus has been completed, and Puerto Ricans have become active members of our armed forces and political life."
 wiffor.4.a: "3 Hurrahs for the newest member in our federation!"

 wiffor.5.t: "[From.GetName] Asks Us for a General"
 wiffor.5.d: "[From.GetName] needs foreign expertise in furthering their army. As brothers in revolution, it is our duty to help them further the cause. The committee has decided that James Francis Brewer would be best for the job."

 wiffor.5.b: "We cannot afford to send anyone right now."

 wiffor.6.t: "[From.GetName] Asks Us for a General"
 wiffor.6.d: "[From.GetName] needs foreign expertise in furthering their army. As fellow subjects of the Crown, it is our duty to help them become more proficient in liberating the homeland. The high command has decided that Philip Neame would be best for the job."

 wiffor.6.b: "We cannot afford to send anyone right now."

 wiffor.7.t: "[From.GetName] Accepted our Request"

 wiffor.8.a: "Damn it."

 wiffor.9.t: "Dutch West Indian Possessions Taken"
 wiffor.9.d: "In the wake of Dutch capitulation, our government ordered the seizure of nearby Dutch colonies without a moment of hesitation. We cannot allow a hostile power to gain a foothold in the region."
 wiffor.9.a: "We will protect them."

 wiffor.10.t: "[From.GetName] Seizes Our Colonies"
 wiffor.10.d: "[From.GetName] has taken invaded our Caribbean possessions in the wake of our capitulation. Perhaps one day we will be able demand their return."
 wiffor.10.a: "Damn."

 wifpol.499.t: "Ottawa Visit Announced"
 wifpol.499.d: "It caused us immense backlash. Voters are embarrassed by the fact that the first place where our head of government is going is Ottawa. The post-election tension only builds up. Many people think that the neglected parts of the Federation should be visited first."
 wifpol.499.a: "They do not understand"

 wifpol.500.t: "The Delegation Arrives in Ottawa"
 wifpol.500.d: "Upon arrival in Ottawa, a great welcome ceremony took place. During the meeting with the king numerous assurances about mutual cooperation were made. The Canadian press praised our new government for its loyalty. At the same time, the pressure from the country began to build up. Our people want us to take advantage of this opportunity and gain some economic help from Canada. We must decide whether to limit ourselves to strengthening our position in the alliance. We can also risk our good relations and ask them to send us support. If the king refuses us, we may be compromised in the country."
 wifpol.500.a: "God save the King"
 wifpol.500.b: "God save the King and the people of West Indies"

 wifpol.501.t: "Ottawa Pledge"
 wifpol.501.d: "A new leader of the West Indies Federation has come to Ottawa. After the magnificent ceremony of pledging allegiance to the king, a series of diplomatic meetings took place. After 3 days, the visit has come to an end. Our old alliance has strengthened even more."
 wifpol.501.a: "Splendid"

 wifpol.502.t: "West Indies Wants Our Assistance"
 wifpol.502.d: "A new leader of Western India had came to Ottawa. After the magnificent ceremony of pledging allegiance to the king, a series of diplomatic meetings took place. After 3 days visit has come to an end. Our old alliance has strengthened even more. But at the end of the visit, representatives of West Indies began to put forward increasingly bold demands. We must decide whether we will send them demanded help and allow our relationship to blossom. Also it will allow to strengthen new government in Kingston. But is the stability of the political scene in West India more important than the interests of Canadians?"
 wifpol.502.a: "Fulfil the request"
 wifpol.502.b: "Reject the request"

 wifpol.503.x: "King [CAN.GetLeader] appreciated our devotion and praised our Federation many times. This has allowed us to build up the popularity of our party and calm the social unrest."
 wifpol.503.y: "What a success! In the coming days, help from Canada will come to our shores. We showed our citizens that this is truly their government."
 wifpol.503.z: "A disaster! The king refused to help us. How can we now convince our citizens to the idea of consolidation without the help of Canada?"
 wifpol.503.t: "Results of Ottawa pledge"
 wifpol.503.a: "After all it was worth the effort"

 wifpol.504.t: "French (East) Guyana incident"
 wifpol.504.d: "Today, after the government of West Indies announced a plan to strengthen ties with former French colonies, a group of 100 people stormed the town hall in Cayenne. Local residents are convinced that they will manage to win even more autonomy. Kingston has been alarmed that East Guyana is getting out of our hands. The government, however, stands firmly in its policy, it may exacerbate the situation in other French-speaking areas. Experts are convinced that the so-called East Guyana incident will quickly die. They treat it as an alarming outbreak of the local population rather than an organised uprising. After all, in order to avoid the widespread rebellion, we must calm the unrest in East Guyana as soon as possible."
 wifpol.504.a: "They can not threaten us"

 wifpol.505.t: "Bauxite Mine Strike in East Guyana"
 wifpol.505.d: "An armed group of 35 people took control of the largest bauxite mine in East Guyana. According to our informers, 4 guards were killed during the fight. To our surprise, the local police department refused to intervene. We are afraid that the level of loyalty in police departments of former French colonies is too low to entrust to them any task."
 wifpol.505.a: "Barbaric"

 wifpol.506.t: "Reaction from Kingston"
 wifpol.506.d: "Edward Brandis Denham, in response to his countrymen from Eastern Guiana, said that the violence we witnessed in the last days would not give rise to a similar crime on his part. However, to stop this barbarity, it will be necessary to send a group of experienced Jamaican policemen. He promised that all the detainees would face a just court that would assess their guilt. He ended his speech with the following words:"
 wifpol.506.a: "The time for consolidation has come"

 wifpol.507.t: "Islanders Support"
 wifpol.507.d: "Today, Félix Éboué's statement reached all radio stations and newspapers in the Caribbean Sea basin. The governor of Martinique and Guadeloupe expressed support for the brothers from East Guyana. He explicitly opposed violence as a solution, but he drew attention to the fact that the conservative government of Edward Brandis Denham violated all previous arrangements that enabled the functioning of the French-British fragile cohabitation. He also referred to national pride and the need to defend French identity. The manifesto met with a broad response from the French population of West Indies. Tonight, numerous support marches are planned and the windows are full of French flags. Moreover during this celebration in East Guyana great fire broke out which consumed much of the city of Cayenne."
 wifpol.507.a: "The time has come for consolidation"

 wifpol.508.t: "Who Will be the Chairman during the Trials?"
 wifpol.508.d: "We must decide who will lead the judgeship during the trials. This will have a strong impact on type of the punishment and more importantly on the social reception of this entire spectacle. A party demanding the most severe penalties is proposing a young and ambitious judge from the Bahamas to be a chairman. This judge is known for his effectiveness in combating organised crime on his native islands and in Jamaica. On the other hand, some politicians are afraid of even greater social tensions in the French part of our Federation and they offer an experienced judge from Montreal. This is an option that would surely please the king too. However, this judge is famous for his liberal views and aversion to the death penalty. We must decide about the direction of our legal system."
 wifpol.508.a: "The judge from Bahamas"
 wifpol.508.b: "The judge from Montreal"

 wifpol.509.t: "Weren't They too Harsh?"
 wifpol.509.d: "After a long trial with many testimonies, including from the wife of the deceased guard, the judge leaned back in his seat. It was time to deliver the sentence. The crowd clamored for the death penalty, but quieted as the judge stood. Taking a deep breath, the judge made his decision. The punishment would be..."
 wifpol.509.a: "Death sentence"
 wifpol.509.b: "Public execution"
 wifpol.509.c: "Life sentence"

 wifpol.510.t: "Weren't They too Gentle?"
 wifpol.510.d: "The judge began his justification by quoting Christian respect for life. Based on wonderful common law, he decided to give judgment that respects life and justice. Should the crimes be given diverse sentences, or as a group??"
 wifpol.510.a: "Diverse sentences (from life-time to 10 years)"
 wifpol.510.b: "Parole"

 wifpol.511.t: "New Governor of Guadeloupe and Martinique"
 wifpol.511.d: "In the next month we will have to choose a new Governor of Guadeloupe and Martinique. Unfortunately, our candidate was discredited among the local population. The only options are the PA candidates. We were able to contact Donald Sangster. We are sure that he will help us in implementing integration policy. He is ready for reforms. However, the population is fully in favour of Hégésippe Légitimus. Unfortunately, this choice may make it difficult for us to continue integration. Hégésippe Légitimus will certainly focus on the interest of the French proletariat, not the good of the Federation."
 wifpol.511.a: "Donald Sangster"
 wifpol.511.b: "Hégésippe Légitimus"

 wifpol.512.t: "Head of the Federal Institute"
 wifpol.512.d: "At the head the Federal Institute can be either a radical and authoritarian Ralph Gray or the Minister of Internal Affairs Robert Arundell. Unfortunately, as the head of the ministry he will have less time to engage in integration. However, Gray is famous for its very radical views and will certainly destabilise West Indies Federation."
 wifpol.512.a: "Ralph Gray"
 wifpol.512.b: "Robert Arundell"

 wifpol.513.t: "The Situation is Improving"
 wifpol.513.d: "We managed to get out of the integration fiasco created by NCP. Their plan failed but we managed to regain control over the region. Their bad decisions won't harm our agenda."
 wifpol.513.a: "Great!"

 wifpol.514.t: "School Strike"
 wifpol.514.d: "Our elementary education system allows teaching French. This subject, however, is of marginal significance. To get the best education you need to know English. This is the result of a long-term underfunding of schools with francophone affiliations. The teachers disturbed by the difference in the quality of teaching, started a strike. They are supported by local elites and clergy. They can also count on the support of local people. NCP sees the sleeping potential of these schools. We must decide whether to allocate funds for their funding."
 wifpol.514.a: "Let them strike"
 wifpol.514.b: "Promise subsidies"

 wifpol.516.t: "Guyana Criminals Lynched"
 wifpol.516.d: "In the prison of Port of Spain, criminals from Guyana are detained. Because of the failure of our state to decide on their future, the residents of Trinidad decided themselves to bring justice. They got sick from waiting. Today in the evening the crowd stormed the prison. During the fuss an accidental fire broke out. Unfortunately, despite the efforts of firefighters, fire got out of our control. The vast areas of the city were destroyed. Important industrial plants have been devastated. Unfortunately, such a price is paid for dismissing justice and delay."
 wifpol.516.a: "Damn"

 wifpol.517.t: "Flyer in French Addressed"
 wifpol.517.d: "The Federal Institute has analysed the manifesto and selected a few key proposals that will be easy to implement or ones that will bring tangible benefits to the entire Federation."
 wifpol.517.a: "Mount Pelée Street issue"
 wifpol.517.b: "Great exhibition"
 wifpol.517.c: "Economic integration programme"

 wifpol.518.t: "Mount Pelée Street Issue"
 wifpol.518.d: "On 8 May 1902, a volcanic eruption of Mount Pelée destroyed the town of Saint-Pierre. Moments later, all but a handful of its nearly 30,000 residents were dead, including the governor, who had come with his family to reassure the population. And in our capital of Kingston there is a street named: Mount Pelée Street. In the manifesto they demand us to change this name. It is ridiculous. It was not named in order to mock this tragedy. But we may make use this in our advantage. We can change it and honour king Edward. We can also honour Victims of this tragedy. And finally we can build a monument in their honour.\n\nThe more expensive the option, the greater the chances of success. The costs of each decisions (in political power)\nA: 10pp\nB: 12pp\nC: 25pp"
 wifpol.518.a: "Name it after King Edward"
 wifpol.518.b: "Name it after the Victims of the Moun Pelée"
 wifpol.518.c: "Build a monument for those victims"

 wifpol.519.t: "Great Exhibition of West Indies Culture"
 wifpol.519.d: "Another noteworthy idea is to organise an exhibition on the culture of French Antilles. Of course, it will be an exhibition about the entire Federation, and the French Antilles will be presented as an integral part of the federation. We can choose where this exhibition is about to take place. The larger the range of the exhibition, the greater the chance of satisfying the supporters of the manifesto.\n\nThe more expensive the option, the greater the chances of success. The costs of each decisions (in political power)\nA: 15pp\nB: 25pp\nC: 40pp\n"
 wifpol.519.a: "Homeland"
 wifpol.519.b: "Ottawa and New York"
 wifpol.519.c: "World Tour"

 wifpol.520.t: "Economic Integration Programme"
 wifpol.520.d: "We can concentrate on 1 of 3 options. The first is to enlarge the port in Port of France. The second considers transferring the fish processing plants back to the Port of France. These factories in 1934 moved to Kingston due to economic reasons. The third option is a wide programme of industrial development using local potential. This project seems to be particularly difficult. However, it will allow the economic and commercial linking of the federation industry.\n\nYou have starting 66% chance of success. The costs of each decisions (in political power)\nA: 30pp\nB: 60pp\nC: 90pp\n"
 wifpol.520.a: "Build up docks of Port of France"
 wifpol.520.b: "Send factories from Jamaica to Port of France"
 wifpol.520.c: "Great industrial project"

 wifpol.521.t: "How hard should we work on this"
 wifpol.521.d: "We must decide how much we will get involved in this project. It will increase costs but it will also increase the chances of success!"
 wifpol.521.a: "+0%"
 wifpol.521.b: "+50%"
 wifpol.521.c: "+100%"

 wifpol.522.t: "Flyer in French Effects"
 wifpol.522.d: "Let's hope we succeeded. The political cost may be high, but it will be worth it."
 wifpol.522.a: "What has happened?"
 wifpol.522.b: "What has happened?"
 wifpol.522.c: "What has happened?"

 wifpol.523.t: "French-Caribbean Exchange Programme"
 wifpol.523.d: "Some scholars from the Sorbonne, with connections within our Federation, invited French-speaking students to study in Paris. Our government has been sent such cooperation proposal. On the one hand, it seems unworthy to cooperate with syndicalists. On the other hand, we can export some syndicalists to a country where they would be welcomed. They might not come back."
 wifpol.523.a: "Sign it."
 wifpol.523.b: "Reject it."

 wifpol.524.t: "French-Caribbean Exchange Programme"
 wifpol.524.d: "[wifpol524]"
 wifpol524_ncp: "Students sent to Paris for exchange are about to return to the Port of France. We thought that the life in Paris would show them the reality of syndicalism. But they were treated like kings there. Some of them decided to stay in France and we thank them for it. Less problems for us. However, our intelligence states, after a detailed collection of evidence, that returning students pose a threat to our democracy. During the scholarship, they succumbed to radicalisation and may initiate unrest."
 wifpol524_other: "French-Caribbean Exchange Programme is over. Due to the government change all the students had to prematurely come back home. Maybe knowledge gained abroad will be useful to them here."
 wifpol524_fallencommune: "A contract with the government in Paris is no longer binding. Citizens of the West Indies Federation staying in France can contact the government in Jamaica if they want to return. Some of them, however, look for a shelter in the European centres of socialism. Fall of Paris broke their hearts."
 wifpol.524.a: "Allow them to come back."
 wifpol.524.b: "Prohibit them from entering."
 wifpol.524.c: "Welcome home."
 wifpol.524.e: "Commune of France is gone."

 wifpol.525.t: "Address the Capitalist Economy in the Constitution"
 wifpol.525.d: "We must establish the legal basis for our economy in the constitution. Most of our peers from NCP are in favour of conservative capitalism. A transparent system will create great conditions for an economic boom. We have 3 options to choose from:\n\n1. Clear rules of the capitalistic economy.\n\n2. Refer only to basic issues to satisfy more people.\n\n3. There are too many syndicalists in this country. Ignore the issue in the constitution.\n\nFor the quality of the constitution, clarity of regulations would be important. However, it will be easier to pass a constitution that suits a larger group."
 wifpol.525.a: "1. Gain quality, lose voters."
 wifpol.525.b: "2. Status quo."
 wifpol.525.c: "3. Lose quality, gain voters."

 wifpol.526.t: "Address Citizens' Rights in the Constitution"
 wifpol.526.d: "We need to establish a package of fundamental rights for our citizens. Of course given rights must respect traditional values. Despite this our party knows that some changes are needed. We have 3 options to choose from:\n\n1. A modern package of fundamental rights that is going to be unpopular in our own party.\n\n2. Copy this passage from the current constitution.\n\n3. Constitution can not guarantee anything. Let's not make more concessions.\n\nFor the quality of the constitution, it would be important to codify fundamental rights compatible with the modern days. However, it will be easier to pass a constitution that suits a larger group."

 wifpol.527.t: "Address Political System Solutions in the Constitution"
 wifpol.527.d: "NCP has always fought to create a strong federation in which there are no autonomous regions. Writing a new constitution allowed us to prevent future attempts to fragment our federation. We have 3 options to choose from:\n\n1. Strong federation.\n\n2. Federation, but with the possibility of autonomous regions.\n\n3. Leave the system as it is.\n\nFor the quality of the constitution, it would be important to modernise the provisions defining the political system of West Indies. On the other hand, the NCP has exhausted many of its resources for the consolidation process. The reticent constitution seems to be an easier solution."

 wifpol.528.t: "Address Rule of Law in the Constitution"
 wifpol.528.d: "West Indies Federation is a proud country, but we must be aware that in terms of government, we are departing from European standards. In the constitution, we can create instruments to effectively combat pathologies that ruin the work of the NCP. We have 3 options to choose from:\n\n1. Efficient instruments to fight corruption and crime.\n\n2. The state operates efficiently in this regard today.\n\n3. We should not fight it. It could backfire at us.\n\nFor the quality of the constitution, it would be important to create a legal order in which our prosperity and strength would develop. Remember, however, that the fight against many fronts can end tragically for us."

 wifpol.529.t: "Address our Relation with Canada in the Constitution"
 wifpol.529.d: "We must name our precise relationship with Canada in the constitution. We have 3 options to choose from:\n\n1. Define our relationship in detail.\n\n2. Name the basics of the relationship.\n\n3. Ignore the topic.\n\nFor the quality of the constitution, it would be important to define this relationship. However, some of our opponents would prefer to see only ambiguous answers in the constitution."

 wifpol.530.t: "Polishing our New Constitution"
 wifpol.530.d: "We can sacrifice some resources in order to improve the quality of the constitution that we are writing currently."
 wifpol.530.a: "Everybody needs to work harder"
 wifpol.530.b: "Work on it"
 wifpol.530.c: "Today we rest"

 wifpol.531.t: "Try to Secure New Votes"
 wifpol.531.d: "We can try to gain some additional votes for our new constitution. Some members of our government suggest that we can try some more effective ways og gaining supporters."
 wifpol.531.a: "Try talking them into it"
 wifpol.531.b: "Try promising favours"
 wifpol.531.c: "Try corruption"

 wifpol.612.t: "NCP Votes"
 wifpol.612.d: "Make concessions for NCP votes. Some funds are going to be allocated to the implementation of their goals. Are we ready to sacrifice enough to get a political ally?"
 wifpol.612.a: "Accept!"
 wifpol.612.b: "Reject!"

 wifpol.613.t: "Unity Votes"
 wifpol.613.d: "Make concessions for Unity Party votes. Some funds are going to be allocated to the implementation of their goals. Are we ready to sacrifice enough to get a political ally?"

 wifpol.614.t: "Social Democrats Votes"
 wifpol.614.d: "Make concessions for Social Democrats votes. Some funds are going to be allocated to the implementation of their goals. Are we ready to sacrifice enough to get a political ally?"

 wifpol.615.t: "Conscription Dilemma"
 wifpol.615.d: "The Social liberals focus mainly on pacifism. Therefore there is no reason to increase the conscription to the army. That is why we can delegate part of the population back to the economy. This will cause an economic boom. An alternative concept involves professional conscription to the army. The army should not be forced. To achieve it some funds should be devoted to increasing wages and improving the quality of life for military personnel."
 wifpol.615.a: "Pacifism"
 wifpol.615.b: "Soldiers attracted by better wages"

 wifpol.616.t: "Autonomic Economic Development"
 wifpol.616.d: "The Cayenne Agreement guaranteed increased autonomy of the post-French parts of the Federation. However, they were still crippled by the central government. There are voices that it would be worthwhile to bring economic decentralisation and give people tools that would allow independent development. This would result in weakening the central government, but it would be economically beneficial. Donald Sangster has drafted a plan. It considers sale of unprofitable companies owned by country, local vocational training plans, matching profitable enterprises to local needs and not promoting Canadian companies in West Indies."
 wifpol.616.a: "One step too far"
 wifpol.616.b: "It sounds great"

 wifpol.617.t: "Corruption Scandal"
 wifpol.617.d: "Some of our higher ranked politicians have been found out to be corrupt! As the papers are spreading the news, our standing in the eyes of the people has been tarnished."
 wifpol.617.a: "Damn them!"

 wifpol.618.t: "Mass Resignation"
 wifpol.618.d: "A wave of resignations has hit our most critical offices. This has severely reduced the efficiency of our institutions, and we can only speculate what caused it."
 wifpol.618.a: "Damn it!"

 wifpol.619.t: "Personal Conflicts between PA and LP"
 wifpol.619.d: "The LP is much more conservative compared to our faction of PA. Thanks to this, small conflicts about the future of our government continue to emerge. This time, however, there are no chances of mitigating the conflict."
 wifpol.619.a: "Our coalition stability is going to drop."

 wifpol.620.t: "Successful Coalition Discussions"
 wifpol.620.d: "The various party leaders have come to a conclusion on the future plans for the governing coalition. This will actually enable us to take good steps towards a better tomorrow, with the agreement of everyone."
 wifpol.620.a: "Great!"

 wifpol.621.t: "Coalition Turbulence with LP"
 wifpol.621.d: "Our coalition stability is going to drop. The LP is much more conservative compared to our faction of PA. Thanks to this, small conflicts about the future of our government continue to emerge. This time, however, there are no chances of mitigating the conflict."
 wifpol.621.a: "Let's hope it won't become worse."

 wifpol.622.t: "PA-LP Legislative Success"
 wifpol.622.d: "Despite the lack of a parliamentary majority, we managed to push through favourable changes. This is a great success of our party. Our coalition's stability is going to rise. "
 wifpol.622.a: "Great!"

 wifpol.623.t: "Form Majority Coalition"
 wifpol.623.d: "We have finally managed to create a coalition with another party, and our new arrangements will help us govern more effectively, even if we had to compromise."
 wifpol.623.a: "Let our coalition with the Unity Party prove useful."
 wifpol.623.b: "Let our coalition with the NCP prove useful."
 wifpol.623.c: "Let our coalition with the radical PA prove useful."

 wifpol.625.t: "Penalty for Minority Government"
 wifpol.625.d: "Because of our refusal or inability to form a majority coalition, some new conflicts between LP and PA occur. It is going to hurt our coalition stability."
 wifpol.625.a: "The stability of our coalition is going to drop."

 wifpol.800.t: "Joining the Internationale"
 wifpol.800.d: "We have decided to join the Third Internationale. A delegate representing the West Indies Federation has been sent to Paris, where we will apply for membership."
 wifpol.800.a: "To Paris we go!"

 wifpol.801.t: "Elections Restarted"
 wifpol.801.d: "The socialist revolution has succeeded and the West Indies Union declared. Now that the rule of the socialism is safe within the West Indies, elections have restarted and the people have taken to the ballots. There are three major candidates -\n\nThe British Citizens' and Workers' Home Rule Party, more commonly known as the Butler Party (BP), under Tubal Uriah Butler and his clique, who aim for a higher position for trade unions in the West Indian Government. Butler's supporters are largely British socialists from Trinidad.\n\nThe People's Party (PP), under Aimé Fernand David Césaire, consisting of mainly French socialist youth who wish to see maximum autonomy for all provinces within the Union.\n\nThe Parti Pour l'Autonomie (PA), now separated from the radical PNP after the revolution and led by Joseph Lagrosillière, aiming for a somewhat democratic system of political parties and consisting of mainly French citizens and Jamaican English politicians."
 wifpol.801.a: "The PA steals the polls!"
 wifpol.801.b: "The FC comes out on top!"
 wifpol.801.c: "The BP wins in a landslide!"

 wifpol.802.t: "The PA's West Indian Union"
 wifpol.802.d: "Joseph Lagrosillière and the PA have come out of the elections victorious, and have assumed control of the government. Lagrosillière promises freedom for all, greater autonomy for the provinces, and democracy within the Union."
 wifpol.802.a: "We will see how his promises turn out..."

 wifpol.803.t: "Lagrosillière Announces New Education Programme"
 wifpol.803.d: "Joseph Lagrosillière has announced that the government will be supporting local public schools and funding a new socialist curriculum Aimed at improving workers and the common folk, making them more useful at labour and training a new, young, generation to improve the status of the West Indies. Along with hiring new, more professional teachers, the entire curriculum is under rework, with many elective subjects being taken away and replaced with mandatory classes to reduce possible factor immobility."
 wifpol.803.a: "We will watch this with great interest..."

 wifpol.804.t: "Education Programme - Year 1 Report"
 wifpol.804.d: "The education programme has gone well so far, but there have been many setbacks. Children, especially those already enrolled in schools, are finding it increasingly hard to adjust to the new curriculum and many complaints have been raised, especially regarding student freedom in choosing classes. Teachers have complained about not receiving high-enough pay, something that the government should consider to fix."
 wifpol.804.a: "Interesting..."

 wifpol.805.t: "Education Programme - Year 2 Report"
 wifpol.805.d: "As a new wave of students roll in and workers have started to go to school again to get better educations, things are looking bright for the new education programme. Teachers no longer complain as much about the lack of pay, but some have raised questions about the efficiency of the new curriculum, especially in the new Mathematics and Science textbooks. Professionals are looking into the textbooks now to see if they can fix anything."
 wifpol.805.a: "Everything is going well!"

 wifpol.806.t: "Education Programme - Year 3 Report"
 wifpol.806.d: "It has been 3 years since the implementation of the new social democratic curriculum, and many have found it to be too politically charged. It seems as if too many students are becoming annoyed with constant references to the greatness of democracy and socialism, and would rather not see it in their textbooks. We have taken their complaints to heart and worked on de-politicising the curriculum."
 wifpol.806.a: "Seems like they didn't like politics much..."

 wifpol.807.t: "Education Programme - Year 10 Report"
 wifpol.807.d: "Students who entered school with our curriculum are now reaching the end, and are almost ready to graduate and go to college. However, students who entered the curriculum in their second year of school are finding it very hard to get high scores on the national exams and enter international colleges. It has been suggested that the curriculum be changed to be more intensive and college-preparatory."
 wifpol.807.a: "Understood."

 wifpol.808.d: "Twenty years have passed since Joseph Lagrosillière implemented the education reform. In those twenty years, West Indian workers have received much more education of a much higher quality. Our nation is now more advanced than ever, and technological research has speeded up. The West Indian Union now supplies great minds to across the world."
 wifpol.808.a: "Hurrah!"

 wifpol.809.t: "The Government Increases Welfare Spending"
 wifpol.809.d: "The government has increased their welfare spending, choosing to focus less on things like the military in favour of the social welfare of people. The more wealthy have been taxed more to bring the less fortunate up."
 wifpol.809.a: "To a more equal society!"

 wifpol.810.t: "The Housing for All Programme"
 wifpol.810.d: "The 'Housing for All' programme has been announced, which will see the use of unused land in the island of Jamaica and other, less inhabited islands for housing, with the aim to provide shelter for the homeless of the West Indies."
 wifpol.810.a: "An admirable effort!"

 wifpol.811.t: "Canada Responds"
 wifpol.811.d: "In response to the socialist takeover of the West Indies, the Dominion of Canada has declared war on the new West Indies Union as an attempt to reverse the Revolution and put a Governor-General back in charge of the West Indies. Their ships are ready and their guns are loaded, and we must be ready to fight back."
 wifpol.811.a: "Let's give them a fight they'll remember!"

 wifpol.812.t: "The West Indian Culture"
 wifpol.812.d: "Aimé Césaire has declared the West Indian Culture to be a united culture, uniting the myriad island cultures of British and French West Indians. He has promoted this new culture, claiming that it will usher the Union into a new age."
 wifpol.812.a: "We are one people, one nation!"

 wifpol.813.t: "A Victory for the People's Party"
 wifpol.813.d: "Aimé Césaire and his People's Party have won the elections, supported by West Indian socialist youth. Césaire promises autonomy for all, and his inauguration speech ended with much applause. It seems as if the West Indian populace approve of him greatly."
 wifpol.813.a: "Congratulations!"

 wifpol.814.t: "The Autonomous Provinces"
 wifpol.814.d: "President Césaire has decreed autonomy for the provinces, each with their own local governance. He is seeking a federal path, with the central government in Kingston becoming less dominant in the provinces. With this autonomy, however, Césaire has emphasised the idea of national unity, and the bonding together of West Indian people in the face of hardship and capitalism."
 wifpol.814.a: "Another step forwards for the Union!"

 wifpol.815.t: "A New Healthcare System"
 wifpol.815.d: "The President of the Union has implemented a new free healthcare system, with all citizens of the West Indies subject to the programme. He has taken inspiration from European models, but added the socialist element of healthcare for all."
 wifpol.815.a: "A great new system!"

 wifpol.816.t: "Opening of the West Indian Workers' Museum"
 wifpol.816.d: "The Workers' Museum has just been opened in Kingston, with an old colonial government building repurposed to house it. The exhibitions show the hardships of West Indian workers and unions in resisting colonial rule and the British. It houses, too, an exhibition about the history of the West Indies before the Europeans came, and an international exhibition showing off items from other countries in the Internationale."
 wifpol.816.a: "Glory to the Union!"

 wifpol.817.t: "A Call to Arms"
 wifpol.817.d: "'Brothers and sisters of the West Indies, we call upon your help today to fight against Canada and her Entente. We have, after decades of struggle, finally broken free, and liberation is near. But heed my words, fellow West Indian brethren - if Canada and her Empire manage to gain hold of the provinces once again, she will not be kind to our workers.'"
 wifpol.817.a: "To arms, comrades!"

 wifpol.818.t: "Canadian Ships near Montego Bay"
 wifpol.818.d: "Canadian ships have been spotted near Jamaica's Montego Bay, apparently haven taken a detour around Cuba and the Cayman Islands. They fired on us, but our men there stood bravely, however, and our defences held against the Canadian attack."
 wifpol.818.a: "They can't get us!"

 wifpol.819.t: "Discourse within the Union"
 wifpol.819.d: "Even though the war has brought the myriad socialist parties of the West Indies together, hot debates surrounding socialist thought have been going on recently. The Butler Party, Césaire's People's Party, and the Radical PA have all taken their thoughts and hotly debated them with the other parties."
 wifpol.819.a: "Political discourse is always healthy."

 wifpol.820.t: "Victory for the Butler Party"
 wifpol.820.d: "The British Citizens' and Workers' Home Rule Party, known more commonly as the Butler Party, has just won the West Indian elections. In a surprising turn of events, Tubal Uriah Butler and his clique have gained the support of the people and the following of thousands."
 wifpol.820.a: "A new syndicalist era dawns on the Caribbean!"

 wifpol.821.t: "The Elevation of Unions"
 wifpol.821.d: "President Butler seeks the elevation of the position of trade unions in the government. He has given up more and more of his power in favour of the unions, and has talked much about drastically improving workers' rights and equality within the workplace. He has also cut off working hours, a move celebrated by many."
 wifpol.821.a: "An admirable effort."

 wifpol.822.t: "Moving the Capital"
 wifpol.822.d: "Tubal Uriah Butler has raised the question of possibly changing the capital of the West Indies Union. As someone active mostly in Trinidad and Tobago, Butler has proposed that the government and the capital be moved to Port of Spain, where Butler holds more power."
 wifpol.822.a: "Move it, then."
 wifpol.822.b: "Kingston's fine."

 wifpol.823.t: "Spreading Socialism Across the Provinces"
 wifpol.823.d: "Tubal Uriah Butler has proposed a new way to spread socialism - through the unique cultures of the islands of the West Indies. He has encouraged political songs, and books centred on socialist thought have also been widely distributed across the islands."
 wifpol.823.a: "A good way to get the youth into syndicalism."

 wifpol.824.t: "The West Indies Union Requests Internationale Membership"
 wifpol.824.d: "A delegate from Kingston has just arrived at Paris, narrowly escaping Canadian ships while crossing the Atlantic. The West Indies Union has requested membership in the Third Internationale to help protect them against the Entente. They could be a valuable launching point for an invasion of Canada, but they also may be a burden for us. What do we choose?"
 wifpol.824.a: "Let them join!"
 wifpol.824.b: "We don't want to get involved in Caribbean squabbles..."

 wifpol.825.t: "France Accepts"
 wifpol.825.d: "The Commune of France has accepted our application to the Third Internationale, with our man being sent back to Kingston to tell us of this good news."
 wifpol.825.a: "To our socialist brethren!"

 wifpol.826.t: "France Declines"
 wifpol.826.d: "The Commune of France has sadly declined our request to join the Third Internationale. They have, however, sent our man back with some fine Parisian wine."
 wifpol.826.a: "Unfortunate, but at least we get some wine!"

 wifpol.827.t: "The Bahamas Defect"
 wifpol.827.d: "The Bahamas have just defected to Canada! Due to the large British influence in the Bahamas and the fear of socialism encroaching on the islands, they have decided to throw in their hat with Canada and work against the West Indies Union."
 wifpol.827.a: "Damn them..."

 wifpol.828.t: "Bermuda Defects"
 wifpol.828.d: "The island of Bermuda, long a stronghold of British rule, has defected to Canada! If only we had a garrison there, they could have been very beneficial to the Union as a launching point for an invasion of Canada..."
 wifpol.828.a: "A true shame!"

 wifpol.829.t: "Bahamian Resistance Crushed"
 wifpol.829.d: "The pro-Entente resistance within the Bahamas has been crushed! Our troops, garrisoned there, wiped out what little pro-Entente militant support was left. The Bahamas have stayed with the West Indies Union."
 wifpol.829.a: "They're on this ride now, whether they like it or not."

 wifpol.830.t: "Bermuda Holds"
 wifpol.830.d: "Even though the locals of Bermuda are very pro-Canada and anti-socialist, we have managed to put down their resistance to our rule through military might. The island is staying with us for good."
 wifpol.830.a: "The Bermudans cannot possibly resist us."

 wifpol.831.t: "The West Indies Have Begun Talks with the Internationale"
 wifpol.831.d: "For a few weeks we have been in conflict with syndicalist revolutionaries in the West Indies. Now, however, our loyalists in Kingston have informed us that the revolutionaries have begun talks with the Commune of France and the Union of Britain, with the possibility of joining their alliance. This presents us with a difficult situation - if we continue to prosecute this war, we will soon enter armed conflict with the syndicalists in the mainland, one we and/or our allies might not be ready to face. We have a few options: we can simply withdraw entirely from the region, effectively granting victory to the rebels and causing some loss of face, [WIF_event_keep_islands]or we could continue this war, with the possibility of escalation almost guaranteed. Is the Caribbean truly worth such trouble?"
 wifpol.831.a: "Withdraw from the Caribbean. They are not worth the risks."
 wifpol.831.b: "Withdraw, but keep a garrison on [WIF_event_islands]."
 wifpol.831.c: "We refuse to bow down to the rebels. The war will continue."

 wifpol.832.t: "The Canadians Withdraw from the Caribbean"
 wifpol.832.d: "Our talks with the Internationale have already paid off. We have received a notification from the Canadian government. Unwilling to risk a conflict with our comrades, they have ordered an end to all hostilities and the return of any of our territories, and their forces are already withdrawing from the Caribbean entirely. It seems our revolution was successful."
 wifpol.832.a: "Raise the scarlet standard high!"

 wifpol.833.t: "The Canadians Withdraw from the Caribbean"
 wifpol.833.d: "Our talks with the Internationale have already paid off. We have received a notification from the Canadian government. Unwilling to risk a conflict with our comrades, they have ordered an end to all hostilities, and their forces are already withdrawing from our lands. They have made clear, however, and in no uncertain terms, that [WIF_event_islands] are rightful Canadian territory, and are refusing to even consider the possibility of a peaceful return. It seems our revolution was partly successful."
 wifpol.833.a: "We don't have much of a choice, do we?"
 wifpol.833.b: "Unacceptable, our territory must be returned!"

 wifpol.834.t: "The West Indies Refuse our Withdrawal"
 wifpol.834.d: "The syndicalists in the West Indies have clearly gone mad. Our representative, who was supposed to notify them of our withdrawal, has returned empty-handed. The revolutionaries, it seems, will not accept our withdrawal unless we hand over [WIF_event_islands]. This is an utter insolence, of course, yet the risk of a war with the Internationale remains. By all accounts, [WIF_event_islands] are not worth fighting over, but our more conservative ministers are urging a hardline stance against the spread of syndicalism."
 wifpol.834.a: "This is not worth the trouble. Return [WIF_event_islands]."
 wifpol.834.b: "We shall punish this insolence!"

 wifpol.835.t: "The End of French Influence"
 wifpol.835.d: "The troublesome French islands are no long part of our nation. While some mourn the nation's territorial integrity, this has quickly brought a degree of political stability."
 wifpol.835.a: "Au Revoir."

### Focuses ###

## Unity Tree ##
 WIF_unity_victory: "Unity Victory"
 WIF_unity_victory_desc: "The Unity Party, focused on reconciliation between the various parties and a compromise, has come out on top in the 1937 Elections."
 WIF_unity_contact_NCP: "Contact the NCP"
 WIF_unity_contact_NCP_desc: "The NCP represents a large amount of the right-wing side of West Indies politics, hoping to achieve complete incorporation of the French colonies. Contacting them will be necessary for us to achieve political peace."
 WIF_unity_contact_governor_general: "Contact the Governor-General"
 WIF_unity_contact_governor_general_desc: "The Governor-General of the Federation is an experienced general and politician from the times of the Weltkrieg. Known for not being afraid to state his opinion on the current affairs of the Federation, involving him in the talks between parties is a must."
 WIF_unity_contact_PA: "Contact the PA"
 WIF_unity_contact_PA_desc: "The PA is the main representative for the French minority in the country and their needs. Despite some unsavoury rumours about them, it's best to ensure we remain in contact with them as well."
 WIF_unity_prepare_conference: "Prepare the Conference"
 WIF_unity_prepare_conference_desc: "With all parties contacted and heard from, Gordon James Lethem has decided to hold a conference between all the parties in an attempt to form a '2nd Agreement which satisfies all sides'. The preparation for this will be lengthy, but something good could come out of it in the end."
 WIF_unity_begin_conference: "Begin the Conference"
 WIF_unity_begin_conference_desc: "With all the preparations complete, we can officially begin the conference. Tensions are high, but surely something can come out of this event."
 WIF_unity_increase_french_autonomy: "Increase French Autonomy"
 WIF_unity_increase_french_autonomy_desc: "The PA, despite some of their radical viewpoints, are right that the French deserve more autonomy than they currently have. While the NCP would be fiercely opposed to this, it is necessary to ensure peace for our young nation."
 WIF_unity_cayenne_french_autonomy: "Retain Cayenne French Autonomy"
 WIF_unity_cayenne_french_autonomy_desc: "The Cayenne Agreement was right about the topic of French autonomy at least, and it is perfect right where it is at. While this will only really satisfy members of our party and Félix Éboué's group, picking either side on this topic would result in disaster."
 WIF_unity_lower_french_autonomy: "Lower French Autonomy"
 WIF_unity_lower_french_autonomy_desc: "The Cayenne Agreement was completely wrong in its purpose. The idea that the French population is deserving of more rights than the British is stubbornness on the French and PA's part, and not something we should have to deal with."
 WIF_unity_increase_english_autonomy: "Increase British Autonomy"
 WIF_unity_increase_english_autonomy_desc: "The idea of not mentioning British autonomy in the Cayenne Agreement was ludicrous, and only resulted in an increase of Syndicalist British activities. Autonomy must be properly raised in order to compensate for lack there of from the Cayenne Agreement."
 WIF_unity_cayenne_english_autonomy: "Retain Cayenne British Autonomy"
 WIF_unity_cayenne_english_autonomy_desc: "British Autonomy is an even more dangerous topic to touch than French, due to it being a trigger for both French and British Syndicalist movements. It's best to leave the topic alone than to touch the hornet's nest."
 WIF_unity_lower_english_autonomy: "Lower British Autonomy"
 WIF_unity_lower_english_autonomy_desc: "Not discussing British Autonomy in the Cayenne Agreement was a mistake on our part. British Autonomy is already too high with the French Syndicalists growing as a result. It must be lowered in order to satisfy the French population."
 WIF_unity_crack_down_syndicalism: "Crack Down on Syndicalism"
 WIF_unity_crack_down_syndicalism_desc: "Syndicalism in the Federation will be an ever-looming threat until dealt with properly, and what is a better time than now? We must make sure our country is never threatened again by the Syndicalist menace."
 WIF_unity_loosen_reigns: "Loosen the Reins"
 WIF_unity_loosen_reigns_desc: "The reason Syndicalist movements are so present in the Federation is due to our censorship of them, making the people feel a heavy weight on their psyche, and making our government less liked. Loosening censorship laws will help us in the long-term."
 WIF_unity_british_ties: "British Ties"
 WIF_unity_british_ties_desc: "The British population makes up the majority of our population, and our ties to them is everlasting. While this will displease the French minority, the majority must take precedent."
 WIF_unity_french_ties: "French Ties"
 WIF_unity_french_ties_desc: "The French have had limited contact with us besides through the governors of the French colonies, which deeply upsets the French population. Creating new ties with the French will please them, but might upset the British majority in our country."
 WIF_unity_governor_general: "Status of the Governor-General"
 WIF_unity_governor_general_desc: "While the Governor-General has served us well, his position in power is something that must be decided. While he serves as a source of inspiration for the British, his presence adds a very distinct British feeling to the French colonies."
 WIF_unity_2nd_agreement: "The 2nd Agreement"
 WIF_unity_2nd_agreement_desc: "With all things decided and the worst avoided, a 2nd Agreement has officially been forged based off our previous policies. Hopefully this will ensure a future of political peace for the Federation."

## PA Victory ##
 WIF_pa_victory: "PA Victorious"
 WIF_pa_victory_desc: "With the Victory of the PA, the Unity Party coalition lies shattered. While normally this would call for celebration amongst our party members, the reality is that the fragile alliance that once kept us together now lays broken, and the faction from the PA that comes out successful from the power struggle may change the shape of the Federation forever..."
 WIF_pa_pnp_coalition: "PA-PNP Coalition"
 WIF_pa_pnp_coalition_desc: "The PA shall ally itself with its most socialist elements, forming the PA-PNP Coalition and setting the Federation on the path of Socialism."
 WIF_memories_mainland: "Memories of the Mainland"
 WIF_memories_mainland_desc: "We should not forget that those who call themselves our masters were expelled from their home nations. While the protection of the Empire has been appreciated, our ties with the home nations the Entente seeks to recover so desperately may be stronger than our ties to the Entente as a whole."
 WIF_reconciliation_project: "Reconciliation Project"
 WIF_reconciliation_project_desc: "In order to stand a chance against the conservative elements of our nation, we can't allow ourselves to stand divided. We need to contact the Socialist organisations in our nation and bring them under our wing. Through Unity, we will find strength."
 WIF_status_trade_unions: "Status of the Trade Unions"
 WIF_status_trade_unions_desc: "Our first step towards earning the trust of socialist organisations is by clarifying the status of the Trade Unions in our nation, as their legal status has been left relatively murky in order to make them more easily manageable for the government."
 WIF_fringe_totalists: "The Fringe Revolutionary Front"
 WIF_fringe_totalists_desc: "The Fringe Revolutionaries, while few in number, will still make up for an important ally against the reactionaries in the Federation. With this objective in mind, we ought to make contact with their organisation and start drawing plans together."
 WIF_popular_syndies: "The Popular National Resistance"
 WIF_popular_syndies_desc: "With the other factions under our thumb, it is time to contact the last remaining faction. The Popular National Resistance movement has been a prevalent force within the Federation, and their support in this time of need could prove to be the definitive leverage we need to accomplish our goals."
 WIF_young_radicals: "The Young Freedom Coalition"
 WIF_young_radicals_desc: "The Young Freedom Coalition takes up a significant part of the socialist support base in our nation, and their support will be vital for our efforts of uniting the left wing movements against the reactionaries."
 WIF_legalise_trade_unions: "Legalise Trade Unions"
 WIF_legalise_trade_unions_desc: "With the legal restrictions lifted in our prevision legislative revision, we can now finally de-facto legalise the Trade Unions in our territory and endorse their usage for the general populace."
 WIF_steps_autonomy: "Steps Towards Autonomy"
 WIF_steps_autonomy_desc: "One of the main points over why we were elected was the promise of increased autonomy from the Federal Government. While costly, this first step towards accomplishing our promises to the people will be vital to secure legitimacy in the people's eyes."
 WIF_convince_conscription: "Convince French Conscription"
 WIF_convince_conscription_desc: "The French have been supporters of the PA for quite some time, and our victory in the elections has been greatly acclaimed in their territories. Since we can barely afford to trust the British conscripts, we would do well in encouraging more French-speaking citizens to sign up to our armed forces."
 WIF_convince_people: "Persuading the People"
 WIF_convince_people_desc: "Many within our nation still trust the Entente to protect their interests, despite the fact the Entente has bigger issues to deal with than concerning themselves for the government type of our island-nations. We will have to convince them that this government is for the people, by the people, as well as assuring our English-speaking citizens that our government won't oppose the Entente's commands."
 WIF_secured_loyalty: "Secured Loyalty"
 WIF_secured_loyalty_desc: "With the loyalty of the people secured, we can finally display the legitimacy we needed to be able to face the Entente agents on equal grounds. While they won't like our move towards independence, there's little they'll be able to do against it."
 WIF_militarization: "Preparing the Secession"
 WIF_militarization_desc: "Our secession will not come without question or difficulties, and we may have to face the might of the Entente or the ire of their loyalists sooner rather than later. As such, we will have to undertake steps to assure that we will be prepared for any eventuality for when we do secede."
 WIF_declare_confederation: "Declare the Confederation"
 WIF_declare_confederation_desc: "With our power consolidated and our pool of supporter larger than ever, it is now time to implement one of our most risky promises: To turn the West Indies Federation into a Confederation of equal yet autonomous states."

 WIF_pa_lp_coalition: "PA-LP Coalition"
 WIF_pa_lp_coalition_desc: "Trying to sideline the most radical socialist groups, the PA has joined forces with the Liberal Party and both parties will now work closely to bring about the Liberalist ideals to our nation."
 WIF_forging_new_agreement: "Proposal for a New Agreement"
 WIF_forging_new_agreement_desc: "The present agreement seems to be too compromising. It's time to adopt a new agreement that guarantees more freedom for the citizens of the Federation. At the same time, the state should withdraw from such intense interference in people's lives. We must prepare a draft for a new agreement and send it to the main political parties. Then we will be able to organise the 2nd Conference in Cayenne."
 WIF_reconcile_socialists: "Reconciliation with the Socialists"
 WIF_reconcile_socialists_desc: "PA has always had two wings. It's time to reconcile with socialist brothers. As long as they are willing to give up their radical aspirations, our cooperation will be fruitful."
 WIF_reform_party: "Mending the Divide"
 WIF_reform_party_desc: "Time has shown that we can work as a unity for the good of the islanders. Such an arrangement will allow us to manage efficiently."
 WIF_our_own: "Our Own Power"
 WIF_our_own_desc: "First of all, focus on increasing the strength of our party. The coalition with LP must strengthen before we start looking for another coalition partner."
 WIF_ties_unity: "Ties with the Unity Party"
 WIF_ties_unity_desc: "A natural ally in the implementation of liberal ideas seems to be Unity Party. In the future we may invite them to form majority coalition in the parliament."
 WIF_hear_people: "Hear the People"
 WIF_hear_people_desc: "Do you hear the people talk? It is the speech of a people who will not be slaves again. It turned out that consolidation or other forms of restricting freedom would not be effective. NCP lost its position, now they may try to form coalition with PA. It would be unthinkable."
 WIF_autonomy_status: "Status of Autonomy"
 WIF_autonomy_status_desc: "Donald Sangster is a young reformer with a head full of fresh ideas about decentralisation and how a country can economically benefit from the self-government of its citizens. We need to decide if we want to trust this young economy minister."
 WIF_conscription_issue: "The Issue of Conscription"
 WIF_conscription_issue_desc: "During the elections, the issue of conscription to the army was rarely discussed. However, in order to stay in line with the mainstream of our party, it is necessary to raise the subject of involuntary conscription to the army."
 WIF_ideas_republic: "Ideas of a Republic"
 WIF_ideas_republic_desc: "The ideal of political life is the republic, understood as a political community. The West Indies Federation as a subject of Canada has a monarch over itself. The king is the guarantor of democracy, but no monarch not elected by people should be the head of our country. It's time to adopt a resolution on this subject, declaring the king 'patron of democracy in West Indies'."
 WIF_present_ideas: "Liberal and Equal Society"
 WIF_present_ideas_desc: "With the implementation of our policies, we can finally establish that our government, while Liberal in nature and embracing the idea of the free market, will not abandon its citizens to their fate, and we will strive to reach a balance between socio-economic freedoms and welfare measures."

## NCP Victory ##
 WIF_ncp_victory: "NCP Victorious"
 WIF_ncp_victory_desc: "From 1929, when the NCP lost power, the West Indies were losing their importance. It was during the NCP rule that the territory of the federation expanded by former French colonies. Many say that the party's policy has led to stagnation in our homeland. However, despite this bad press, NCP has steadily strengthened. It was almost enough for us to take over power in 1933 and bring order to West Indies."
 WIF_swearing_fealty: "Swearing our Loyalty"
 WIF_swearing_fealty_desc: "The identity and cohesion of our nation result from loyalty to the British Monarchy. Without the king, the sense of the existence of the Federation is threatened. As soon as possible, we must go to Ottawa to inform His Majesty about our loyalty. The interest of the residents of West Indies is the interest of the entire empire faithful to the king."
 WIF_political_domination: "Political Domination"
 WIF_political_domination_desc: "The strength of the NCP has been proven by the 1937 elections. We must solidify our power by using all the tricks allowed in democracy. On the one hand, we must silence the syndicalists who benefit from the disloyalty of the French. On the other hand, radicals on the right may be a problem. We can not let West Indies fall into the vortex of authoritarianism."
 WIF_early_intervention: "The Intervention"
 WIF_early_intervention_desc: "Those gazing at the governor of lunatics still pose a threat to our democracy. To this end, the NCP organised mass conscription to the army among the population associated with the authoritarians."
 WIF_governor_general_cooperation: "Governor-General Cooperation"
 WIF_governor_general_cooperation_desc: "We must organise an advisory body with our government responsible for cooperation with the Governor. In this way NCP will be able to control authoritarian attempts. And the Governor-General will get the illusion of power."
 WIF_weaken_left: "Weaken the Left"
 WIF_weaken_left_desc: "The weakening of the left wing is decisive for the West Indies Federation progress. Unfortunately, to avoid the build-up of tensions, we must do it delicately. We can initiate talks and at the same time create a series of scandals compromising the left."
 WIF_crackdown_unions: "Crackdown on Unions"
 WIF_crackdown_unions_desc: "Stopping the workers' movement hes been a fundamental goal for a long time. Thanks to this, we will remove the blockade for the development of the economy. It is time to use the weakest for many years position of the left and to forbid trade unions."
 WIF_end_labour_movement: "End the Labour Movement"
 WIF_end_labour_movement_desc: "The Labour Movement at some degree became a symbol of anarchy. Time to prohibit the publication of content that stirs up the mood. In addition, conspiratorial organisations will be dissolved, so as radical parties. In turn, landowners and capitalists will be obliged to supervise revolutionary moods in workplaces. It's time for everyone to get to work instead of a revolutionary struggle."
 WIF_integration_process: "The Integration Process"
 WIF_integration_process_desc: "In our election campaign we have highlighted the need to complete the integration process. It is time to decide with what to replace the shameful Cayenne Agreement. We must also take into account the resistance of the inhabitants of French Antilles and Eastern Guiana. Time for consolidation!"
 WIF_merely_lower: "Lower the Autonomy"
 WIF_merely_lower_desc: "Some members of our party believe that the real consolidation requires us only to partially abolish the autonomy of the former French colonies. This option would certainly be easier to swallow for the enemies of the consolidation. However, some NCP members may see this as a missed opportunity to finally kill the Cayenne Agreement. Maybe it's time to forge a new friendlier version of consolidation."
 WIF_completely_revoke: "Revoke the Autonomy"
 WIF_completely_revoke_desc: "Some members of our party believe that the true consolidation requires us to completely abolish the autonomy of the former French colonies. Such a solution would allow us to create a strong state in which there is an only one clear centre of power. The benefits of this method are unquestionable. However, there is also a risk that we will not be able to convince the French to our ideas. It could be a disaster."
 WIF_revoke_french_conscription: "Allow French Conscription"
 WIF_revoke_french_conscription_desc: "It's time to launch a conscription among the French. This will organise the environment that will catalyse birth of the generation of new patriots. In addition, it will undoubtedly strengthen our army and also show them that we do not treat them as enemies that threaten the integrity of our army. If only they want to serve in our army at all..."
 WIF_universal_rights: "Universal Rights"
 WIF_universal_rights_desc: "Being a West Indies citizen also means certain rights. It is time to reward forgotten citizens as long as we are sure that they will not create a problem for NCP government. In addition, this can only strengthen our consolidation. One legal system will facilitate management and integration of our nation."
 WIF_final_push: "The New Identity"
 WIF_final_push_desc: "A new national identity was created, which will only strengthen ties in our country with each passing year. The first phase of consolidation is moving towards the end. We have to look to the future and try to keep the path once chosen, then the profit will be great. A wonderful French-Caribbean mix born in the spirit of the British culture and law."

 WIF_governor_push: "The Governor's Push"
 WIF_governor_push_desc: "With the Governor General now possessing extraordinary executive powers, we can finally make a move towards securing the Federation against those who threaten its existence."
 WIF_ban_left: "Ban Dangerous Groups"
 WIF_ban_left_desc: "Socialist parties and organisations infest our country like a plague. In order to dismantle such the threats to the Federation, we will first take out these potential troublemakers."
 WIF_suspend_democracy: "Suspend Democracy"
 WIF_suspend_democracy_desc: "Democracy will return to the Federation once the crisis has passed and the dust finally settles, but until then we will have no option but to suspend it in order to focus on maintaining the stability of our nation."
 WIF_resolving_cayenne: "Resolving the Cayenne Problem"
 WIF_resolving_cayenne_desc: "The problem the Cayenne Agreement presented to our former administrations was that it granted the French territories larger autonomy from the Federal Government that they should have had. If we hope to restore stability once more to our nation, these privileges shall be revoked."
 WIF_ending_chaos: "End of the Chaos"
 WIF_ending_chaos_desc: "With our legal flanks covered, the time has finally come to deal with those who would've threatened our nation. While many will protests the many apprehensions and crackdowns that are going to take place, these are necessary sacrifices for the greater good of our nation."
 WIF_restore_democracy: "Restore Democracy"
 WIF_restore_democracy_desc: "Now that the threat has passed, we will restore the democracy our citizens cherish as the Governor-General promised when he took over."
 WIF_new_junta: "The New Rule"
 WIF_new_junta_desc: "The Empire can't afford to have any loose ends, and as such, we should protect our people from themselves and maintain the extraordinary executive powers of the Governor-General."
 WIF_militarization_autdem: "Militarisation"
 WIF_militarization_autdem_desc: "Only through thorough militarisation will our nation be ready to face any foreign threats and protect both our interests as well as those of the Empire and his Majesty."
 WIF_governor_power: "The Governor's Power"
 WIF_governor_power_desc: "While our Governor has acquired extraordinary executive powers through his takeover, his usage of these powers is far from legally accepted and far from absolute as well. With some changes to our legislation, we could ensure the Governor-General has not only even more executive capabilities, but also the legitimacy to act upon his decisions."
 WIF_never_another_cayenne: "Never Another Cayenne"
 WIF_never_another_cayenne_desc: "The Cayenne Agreement was our Achilles' heel for nearly a decade, and could be partially blamed for the instability of our nation. As such, it is in our best interests to integrate the French territories into our core holdings in order to prevent the French from creating a new Cayenne agreement that may weaken us again."
 WIF_permanent_stability: "Permanent Stability"
 WIF_permanent_stability_desc: "While many democrats may not like it, censorship, surveillance and crackdowns have managed to bring back stability to the nation. Provided that the results can't be underestimated, we will push to maintain these stabilising reforms so that stability may never leave our nation again."

 WIF_healing_wounds: "Healing Wounds"
 WIF_healing_wounds_desc: "The fighting has left our populace shattered and distrustful of one another and our government as well. Steps will have to be undertaken for our populace to trust our institutions once more and for the wounds of our country to heal."
 WIF_rebuild: "Rebuild and Recover"
 WIF_rebuild_desc: "Reconstruction of our islands is in order after the recent strife. Hopefully this will allow further development on our territories as well as improving the trust people have for our administration."
 WIF_relying_allies: "Relying on our Allies"
 WIF_relying_allies_desc: "We should not forget that the Federation is full of shortcomings, and as such, we would do well in relying on our allies for assistance in order to recover our strength, and requesting funding from them in order to get our construction projects done could prove to be a decisive factor."
 WIF_unified_indies: "A New Indies"
 WIF_unified_indies_desc: "While the recent developments still haunt many parts of our nation, no one can deny that the Federation now looks forward to the future with renewed enthusiasm and a new sense of unity and trust in favour of our government."

 WIF_syndicalist_revolution: "A Socialist Revolution"
 WIF_syndicalist_revolution_desc: "The time has come. Socialists of the West Indies now band together, the agitation and cries of the working class unheard by the governor in Kingston. The revolution must rise up, and bring a new socialist era for the West Indies!"
 WIF_new_military: "The New Military"
 WIF_new_military_desc: "The old military of the West Indies was corrupt and weak, bound by the chains of Canada and her Entente. To preserve the revolution in the West Indies, we must be able to fight back! And so, a revolutionary military must be created for the provinces."
 WIF_first_unions: "The First Trade Unions"
 WIF_first_unions_desc: "Trade unions must be established to better the position of workers. They deserve rights, lower hours, more pay, and above all, freedom! To break the chains, we must utilise the tool of trade unions!"
 WIF_join_internationale: "Join the Internationale"
 WIF_join_internationale_desc: "Our socialist brethren in Europe may be willing to lend a hand in the West Indian Revolution. We must seek membership in the Third Internationale to protect ourselves against Canada."

 WIF_soc_dem_syndies_desc: "The Parti Pour l'Autonomie has won the election, and with it, President Lagrosillière will begin his new changes within the West Indies Union."
 WIF_people_liberties: "The People's Liberty"
 WIF_people_liberties_desc: "What is socialism without freedom of the people? The people must be prioritised, and their liberty comes first. We will promote their freedom, so that they can freely think and express themselves."
 WIF_freedom_press: "Freedom of the Press"
 WIF_freedom_press_desc: "We must acknowledge that there are those who do not wish to see us in power in the West Indies. But, the freedom of the press is still to be respected, and it shall be restored upon the union!"
 WIF_ending_workers_strife: "Ending the Workers Strife"
 WIF_ending_workers_strife_desc: "The workers have been in strife for too long. They have been shackled and chained, and even fought each other for scraps. No more, we say! No more! For man must not turn against his fellow man, but instead unite against a common enemy!"
 WIF_radical_syndies: "The People's Party"
 WIF_radical_syndies_desc: "The People's Party, under Aimé Césaire, has come out of the election victorious. This new socialist government is full of young radicals willing to do anything for socialism, and their promises for the West Indies are great."
 WIF_mending_divide: "Mending the Divide"
 WIF_mending_divide_desc: "The divide between the workers and the organised socialists must be ended. For are we not all comrades, brothers? When oppressive overlords go dare to attack us socialists, we must unite and respond with a unified, more powerful voice."
 WIF_promote_trade: "Promoting Trade"
 WIF_promote_trade_desc: "From the days of the Spanish, the West Indies has been known for its trade. We must now promote trade with other socialists in the Internationale, and by doing so, help the development of the provinces."
 WIF_new_indies_culture: "The New Indies Culture"
 WIF_new_indies_culture_desc: "To push for unity of the islands, we must promote a new Indies Culture. It is one of Calypso, of jerk, and of rum. We shall not be individual islands with individual cultures - from now on, we are one!"
 WIF_syndie_syndies: "The Butler Party"
 WIF_syndie_syndies_desc: "Tubal Uriah Butler and his British Citizens' and Workers' Home Rule Party have won the West Indian election. A strong proponent of trade unions, we must see how Butler plans to steer the nation."
 WIF_trade_union_dominance: "Trade Union Dominance"
 WIF_trade_union_dominance_desc: "Trade Unions must be made to hold much more power over the government, so that workers may have a say in how their country and their workplaces are run through their unions."
 WIF_mechanization: "Mechanisation"
 WIF_mechanization_desc: "It is the dream of any worker to be free of work. We will now take a stride in this direction and mechanise our labour. Machines will, eventually, replace workers, and we will be finally be free from the chains that bind us!"
 WIF_liberation_worker: "Liberate the Workers"
 WIF_liberation_worker_desc: "The workers are still pushed down and oppressed. Now, we will liberate them, and allow the workers, not the rich, to take their place in the West Indies, as it was always destined to be."

## Naval Tree ##
 WIF_naval_situation: "The Naval Situation"
 WIF_naval_situation_desc: "While the navy of our nation is nothing to scoff at, it is due to some very needed reforms. However, our Naval high command is undecided on what should the nature of our reforms be, and it's time for the government to weigh in the debate and finally break the stalemate."
 WIF_navy_defend_empire: "To Defend the Crown"
 WIF_navy_defend_empire_desc: "The West Indies Federation is, by design, an extension of the British Empire and his majesty. As such, our objective should be to match and, if possible, surpass the Royal Navy's capabilities, so that the Federation may be the spearhead of the Empire!"
 WIF_readjust_budget: "Readjust the Naval Budget"
 WIF_readjust_budget_desc: "Considering the lack of dry-docks and dockyards in our nation, producing new ships for our usage is out of the question. As such, our new naval budget will include the overhaul of several of our current ships in order to equip them with stronger hulls that can sustain larger punishment, as well as better engines to improve their manoeuvrability."
 WIF_canadian_school: "Use the Canadian Academy"
 WIF_canadian_school_desc: "Due to a lack of Naval Military infrastructure, our best bet to obtain the captains of today and the admirals of tomorrow shall be to utilise the already established Canadian naval infrastructure. In return, we will obtain more capable officers that will be able to adapt more easily to the ever-changing battlefield that is the sea."
 WIF_entente_doctrine: "The British Doctrine"
 WIF_entente_doctrine_desc: "The Royal Navy has stood as a bulwark of naval ingenuity for several decades, even after the British Revolution. As such, we should seek to learn upon their developments, and try to apply their knowledge to our own navy."
 WIF_indies_marines: "The West Indies Marines"
 WIF_indies_marines_desc: "As our nation is mostly comprised of islands, possessing a marine force capable of retaking our home islands in case of invasion and punching a front for our allies in Europe is a priority. As such, we shall begin to train a capable landing force that can make our glorious Empire proud!"
 WIF_big_boi_ships: "Bigger is Better"
 WIF_big_boi_ships_desc: "Our Fleet is comprised of effective yet small vessels, capable mainly of coastal patrol and escort duties, which has been so far suitable for our role in the larger scheme of the Empire and our own self-defence. However, in order to obtain some much needed autonomy to have our own engagements with any the enemy fleet, we will require bigger ships to be able to outgun our foes."
 WIF_navy_defend_our_seas: "To Defend our Sea"
 WIF_navy_defend_our_seas_desc: "While the idea of the Federation being the spearhead of the Empire's fleet abroad is a tempting idea, the reality is that our current facilities and assets are simply not enough to allow us to pursue this set of reforms. Instead, we shall focus on protecting the home waters of the Federation, that way we can accomplish the duty for which our citizens vote for and keep war away from our shores."
 WIF_producing_own_ships: "Home Ship Production"
 WIF_producing_own_ships_desc: "We should not rely on the rest of the Empire to do our ship building. After all, they have greater concerns and the protection of our island is obviously a secondary objective for them, but a primary one for us. In order to increase our autonomy from them and be able to protect our home waters without hindering the Royal Navy, we shall kickstart the construction of a shipyard and an expansion of the port of Martinique."
 WIF_defending_caribbean_trade: "Defending Caribbean Trade"
 WIF_defending_caribbean_trade_desc: "The lifeblood of the Caribbean economy is its trade. If enemy forces were to cut our islands from each other and our Federation from the world as a whole, we would stand no chance of success in the long run. We should focus on preventing such a catastrophe to happen by improving upon our convoy protection tactics."
 WIF_study_international_design: "Study International Design"
 WIF_study_international_design_desc: "While the Entente's designs are suitable for the purpose of retaking the home-islands, international designs for coastal defence may prove to be a more vital asset than the High-Seas designs the Entente is currently pursuing. We shall start hiring foreign designers and study foreign ship designs in order to copy and adapt those designs to our particular conditions."
 WIF_naval_academy: "Building our Own Academy"
 WIF_naval_academy_desc: "If the Federation ever wishes to become independent from the Royal Navy, we will require a developed naval officer corps. In order to achieve this, we will have to hire officers from different renowned naval academies and set up our own naval academy, which shall train the officers of today and the admirals of tomorrow so that our fleet may remain both independent in its command structure."
 WIF_fort_construction: "Fort Construction Project"
 WIF_fort_construction_desc: "While we hope to never have to fight in our own shores, one can never be too careful. Since our islands haven't been prepared to resist attacks since they were colonial possessions, we will have to start a construction project to overhaul our existing but outdated fortification system."
 WIF_canadian_ship_purchase: "Purchasing Canadian Ships"
 WIF_canadian_ship_purchase_desc: "Since our Naval production is far lower than our overlord's, it may be a better idea to purchase Canadian ships for our protection. After all, our benefit is their benefit in the long run, isn't it?"
 WIF_jamaican_dockyard_project: "Jamaican Dockyard Project"
 WIF_jamaican_dockyard_project_desc: "Jamaica stands as one of the shining jewels of the Federation, and as such, it would be more than capable of holding dockyards in order to help our navy modernise and expand."
 WIF_defender_central_america: "Defending Caribbean Sea"
 WIF_defender_central_america_desc: "The Caribbean Sea is both our prison and our barrier against invaders. As such, we should seek not only to travel through its crystalline waters, we should above all else seek to rid ourselves from whoever may disturb the peace in the Federation's waters."
 WIF_central_intervention: "Intervention"
 WIF_central_intervention_desc: "Intervention"

## Army Tree ##
 WIF_upgrading_standards: "Upgrading our Standards"
 WIF_upgrading_standards_desc: "In order to cope with the novelty of our armed forces, we had been forced to lower the average training and drilling standards in order to be able to field a decent force faster. Now that we have long achieved this objective, we can once again increase our recruitment and drilling standards in order to finally catch up with the standards of the rest of the Empire."
 WIF_arms_shipments: "Shipments from the [WIF_faction_scriped_loc]"
 WIF_arms_shipments_desc: "Considering our local arms manufacturing enterprises are insufficient to maintain a steady flow of rifles and supplies for our armed forces, we will have to rely once more on our allies in the [WIF_faction_scriped_loc] in order to supply our standing army!"
 WIF_beginning_proper_army: "Beginning of a Proper Army"
 WIF_beginning_proper_army_desc: "With our standards up to par with our allies and our forces equipped with the necessary supplies, we can finally begin our reforms in order to bring the Federation's armed forces to new heights."
 WIF_study_military_academy: "Use [WIF_faction_scriped_loc] Strategies"
 WIF_study_military_academy_desc: "As we lack our own army academy, we should focus on taking advantage of the [WIF_faction_scriped_loc] developments in land warfare in order to improve the effectiveness and fighting capability of our army."
 WIF_entente_gun_study: "[WIF_faction_scriped_loc] Gun Study"
 WIF_entente_gun_study_desc: "The [WIF_faction_scriped_loc] has been at the forefront of gun development for decades now. Instead of trying to come up with our own design, we should try to contact them and use their designs. This way, we can get a reliable base model from which to develop a variation to adapt to our environmental needs."
 WIF_request_general: "Requesting Generals"
 WIF_request_general_desc: "The Federation's high command is terribly understaffed and in dire need of new commanders. We shall request these from our allies in order to have a more competent fighting force with which to help them."
 WIF_increase_military_funding: "Increasing Military Funding"
 WIF_increase_military_funding_desc: "If our force hopes to be up to par with our allies, we will need to increase our yearly budget in order to keep up our reforms, lest we have our new hard-fought-for standards fall through once more."
 WIF_professional: "Professional Armed Forces"
 WIF_professional_desc: "After many reforms, we can finally let the old myth that the Federation's armies were incapable of fighting to rest and step forth into the modern battlefields with a professional fighting force"
 WIF_establishing_doctrine: "Establishing a Doctrine"
 WIF_establishing_doctrine_desc: "We have so far improved on general areas of our military organisation which has allowed us to be fairly flexible in what kind of doctrine we use. However, if we want to master the battlefield, we will have to choose a doctrine to perfect with which to surpass our enemies."
 WIF_compensate_strategy: "Compensate with Strategy"
 WIF_compensate_strategy_desc: "In order to compensate the manpower issue our nation would face in the case of war, we have decided to focus on improving our overall strategy and strengthen our High Command."
 WIF_ensure_communication: "Ensure Communication"
 WIF_ensure_communication_desc: "One of the biggest challenges we face as a nation is the fact that our territories are not geographically connected. As such, we will need a sturdy communication system in order to stay on top in the ever changing modern battlefields."
 WIF_centralized_high_command: "Centralised High Command"
 WIF_centralized_high_command_desc: "If we wish to effectively lead a strategically superior fighting force, we will need to solidify the executive power our High Command has over regional leaders, and as such, the centralisation of our High Command comes as a top priority."
 WIF_next_generation: "The Next Generation"
 WIF_next_generation_desc: "The backbone of our army won't be the old generals that the Empire has given us, but the new blood that volunteers in the recruitments booths. As such, it is our duty to ensure these patriotic volunteers a special spot in our army."
 WIF_increase_funding_oak_ridge: "Increase Funding of the Oak Ridge"
 WIF_increase_funding_oak_ridge_desc: "We need to increase the funding of our research capabilities to keep up with this ever changing world."
 WIF_cooperation_navy: "Cooperate with the Navy"
 WIF_cooperation_navy_desc: "The Navy is a powerful force in the Federation, perhaps even stronger than the army itself. Unlike many other countries, we can't afford to have an interservice rivalry, and so we will seek to strengthen the cooperation between the Army and the Navy."
 WIF_marine_training: "Marine Training"
 WIF_marine_training_desc: "In order to stay on top in whatever war we may find ourselves in, we will need the navy to possess a significant number of standing divisions capable of amphibious landings. While this may be giving the navy too much power, it's bound to help both branches to be more effective in the battlefield."
 WIF_naval_bombers: "Naval Bombing"
 WIF_naval_bombers_desc: "Lacking large ships, our navy stands little chance against larger fleets. A recent proposal from our air commanders has reached our desks and it proposes the development of torpedo bombers capable to support the advances of our fleet. While these tactics have not yet been tested in the modern battlefield, perhaps allowing this proposal to pass may give us an edge the day we face a larger foe?"
 WIF_compensate_weapons: "Compensate with Weapons"
 WIF_compensate_weapons_desc: "We won't win a war by throwing men at the enemies with the manpower we possess, so we may as well rely on having better equipment that can ensure that more of our soldiers can survive the battles that awaits us. A modernisation programme for our army's equipment is preferable over improving our already old army leadership."
 WIF_artillerymanu: "Artillery Manufacturing"
 WIF_artillerymanu_desc: "Very recently, the Federation has given birth to a few steel melting companies willing to produce artillery for us for the right price. While we have yet to give them some concise designs, they have taken the initiative and delivered several units of the British QF-18 Pounder in order to show their production capabilities. We would do well to invest in them if the trial of this artillery proves successful."
 WIF_cooperation_airforce: "Cooperation with the Air Force"
 WIF_cooperation_airforce_desc: "The Air Force and the Army have had a close relationship since the birth of the two, and now that they're both independent, it may be a good idea for both to start improving their coordination in order to provide for each other's needs and cover each other's shortcomings in the battlefield."
 WIF_anti_air: "Anti-Air Setup"
 WIF_anti_air_desc: "Our Air force, while brave and enthusiastic, is small in number and could be overwhelmed by a stubborn foe. Even if we have some of the best pilots, given sufficient enemy aircraft, we will need a backup plan to deal with the planes our pilots can't take down, and as such we will set up anti air batteries across the Federation in order to shoot down any remaining planes that manage to breach through our skies."
 WIF_secured_army: "A Secured Army"
 WIF_secured_army_desc: "Our army will receive regular reconnaissance support from our air force. That way, the Army can be directly benefit from a better air force, and said air force can finally prove its usefulness in the modern battlefield to those who once doubted it should be an independent organisation."

## Air Tree ##
 WIF_entente_planes: "[WIF_faction_scriped_loc] Plane Request"
 WIF_entente_planes_desc: "The Air Force is a relatively new weapon on the modern battlefields. As such, we don't really have a respectable air force of our own. However, our friends in the [WIF_faction_scriped_loc] do, and purchasing their outdated planes may be a good starting point for us to kickstart our own air force!"
 WIF_airway_project: "Airway Project"
 WIF_airway_project_desc: "If the Federation is to have an air force, we will require decent airfields for these to operate effectively. As such, we should divert our funding to an Airway construction project so that we actually possess the infrastructure to project a significant amount of aerial power."
 WIF_opening_airforce: "Establishing the Air Force"
 WIF_opening_airforce_desc: "So far, our attempts to form an air force so far had envisioned it as a branch of the Army, always serving as a subservient entity of it. With our recent reforms to our air force, we're finally able to inaugurate it as a separate and independent branch of our armed forces. Today is a great day for the Federation!"
 WIF_control_our_skies: "Control our Skies"
 WIF_control_our_skies_desc: "While the battle for the control of the Caribbean sea may be vital for our survival, so will be the control of the skies above it. If our foes were to overwhelm us in the air, our fleet will not stand a chance. On the other hand, if we manage to overwhelm our opponent, maybe our small but brave navy may yet stand a chance against larger fleets."
 WIF_heavier_fighters: "Heavier Fighters"
 WIF_heavier_fighters_desc: "The distances involved in patrolling the Caribbean mean that the usage of short-range fighters may prove to be fatal in case of a war. Instead, we should focus on innovating in the air department and begin designing and constructing heavy fighter models, which by sacrificing agility for range and firepower will be able to protect the skies of our Federation as a whole."
 WIF_close_air: "Air to Ground Support"
 WIF_close_air_desc: "Combined Arms tactics are still in their infancy, yet they are showing great promise in the battlefields across the globe. As such, our air force shouldn't lag behind this worldwide developments, and we should start preparing to produce our own homemade support planes in preparation for the wars to come."
 WIF_close_cooperation: "Closer Ties"
 WIF_close_cooperation_desc: "By closing the ties between the army and the air force, we will be able to improve upon our doctrine for both service branches."
 WIF_young_generation: "Young Generation of Pilots"
 WIF_young_generation_desc: "As our newly-born air force is staffed full with young and ambitious pilots, their spirit pushes us for new doctrinal breakthroughs to keep up with their enthusiasm. As these new and young pilots continue performing beyond our expectations, our officers should not lag behind their subordinates and should exceed expectations as well."
 WIF_women_pilots: "Women Pilots"
 WIF_women_pilots_desc: "It is not only men that have signed up for our air force, but also many women, who unfortunately were refused due to our male only policy. However, there may yet be a place where these women can help our nation, and as such we should lift the restrictions so that these brave airwomen can still serve our country, even if it is in auxiliary roles."
 WIF_increase_air_budget: "Increase the Air Budget"
 WIF_increase_air_budget_desc: "As our air force grows in airmen, so does our need for capable engineers and repairmen, as well as better equipment and spare parts for our planes. If we hope to keep up with our current pace of development, we will need to divert funding into our air force so that it may achieve its full potential."
 WIF_reaching_all_skies: "Reaching all Skies"
 WIF_reaching_all_skies_desc: "While many countries focus on more agile models, our focus shall be in speed and range, which shall be vital to provide an aerial safety net for our Federation. As such, we shall encourage the design of new heavy fighter models to improve upon our already existing designs."

## Industrial Tree ##
 WIF_depression_woes: "Depression Woes"
 WIF_depression_woes_desc: "The Depression has caused the Federation's economy to crawl for more than half a decade. While we have managed to make some improvements over time, the time has come to finally put this economic downturn to rest and start growing as a nation."
 WIF_fixing_economy: "Fixing the Economy"
 WIF_fixing_economy_desc: "Many issues plague the Federation's economy after Black Monday, and we will have to invest heavily on overall improvements across the board to even begin any pretence of reform in the near future."
 WIF_sugar_growth: "Attempt to Sell Sugar"
 WIF_sugar_growth_desc: "Sugar has been one of the Caribbean's main exports ever since the colonial times, and it still plays a large role in our economy. If we wish to improve our economy, we will need to find a way to get our collected sugar out of the Federation in order to keep our plantations going."
 WIF_trinidad_oil: "Trinidad Oil Profit"
 WIF_trinidad_oil_desc: "Trinidad has shown promise in the recent geological analysis, which indicated that the island possesses worthwhile oil deposits. With the recent economic downturn, maybe exploiting these oil deposits will have long lasting effects in our economy and allow us to recover faster."
 WIF_birthing_tourism: "Birthing a Tourism Industry"
 WIF_birthing_tourism_desc: "Tourism has shown to be a promising enterprise on a few of our islands, and encouraging tourism to our wonderful Caribbean paradise may help us overcome our economic woes. After all, no one can deny the Caribbean is a great location for people to spend their holidays in, and if that brings us profit, then we only stand to win from it!"
 WIF_american_markets: "Tapping into American Markets"
 WIF_american_markets_desc: "America could prove to be the most important trade partner of the West Indies Federation, perhaps an even closer partner than our friends in the Entente. Since the American market is so big and profitable, tapping into it might be a game changer for our nation and it will allow us to recover from our economic woes a lot faster than if we just focused on our tried and true trade partners."
 WIF_trade_profit: "Trade Profit"
 WIF_trade_profit_desc: "Trade has increased significantly since Black Monday, and it has allowed us an extra kickback to reinvest in the rest of our economy, which helps us improve our overall economic situation, albeit only slightly.

 WIF_education_system: "An Education System"
 WIF_education_system_desc: "The education system in the Federation is laughably outdated and terribly inconsistent between our islands. We will have to invest heavily in order to standardise our education system if we hope to have any chance of avoiding complete intellectual shortages."
 WIF_health_care: "Improving Health Standards"
 WIF_health_care_desc: "Health standards across the Federation are deplorable, and it's no wonder that in these conditions many workers and farmers quickly joined the ranks of radicals in order to demand a better livelihood. If we hope to save face when the Report finally releases to the general public, we will have to, at least, have begun efforts to improve the livelihood of these people."

 WIF_tourism_monopoly: "Tourism Monopolies"
 WIF_tourism_monopoly_desc: "While many travel agencies across the globe offer their services for passengers to come to our great nation, it falls to us to give these agencies the permits necessary for their activities to be profitable. Instead of allowing foreign companies to take all our profits, we could create our own agencies and slowly begin favouring them over the foreign competition, which shall in turn increase our profits."
 WIF_alu_mine: "Deepen the Bauxite Mines"

 WIF_university: "University of the West Indies"
 WIF_university_desc: "The lack of an autochthonous university for our nation has led many of our bright scientists and cunning researchers to leave to overseas.

 WIF_indutralize_smol_bois: "Focus on the Smaller Islands"
 WIF_indutralize_smol_bois_desc: "Jamaica, Trinidad and the Guyanas are highly profitable. Smaller territories, like Barbados and Martinique, feel more like a burden by comparison. As such, it is a priority for our government to make these islands more profitable, and an easy way to achieve this is to build new factories on these islands so that they may have a tangible economic production outside of small scale tourism and agriculture."
 WIF_poor_education: "Education for the Poor"
 WIF_poor_education_desc: "As an extension of our social programmes, we will begin a campaign to eradicate illiteracy in our nation as well as investing in subsidies for our citizens to be able to reach higher education.

 WIF_new_economy: "A Caribbean Economy"

 WIF_tubal_uriah_butler_leader_desc: "§YBorn:§! §LJanuary 21st, 1897, in St. George's, Grenada, British Windward Islands§!\n§YBackground:§! §LTubal Uriah 'Buzz' Butler is a Grenadian Spiritual Baptist teacher in Trinidad and Tobago. Born in Grenada, Butler was unable to find work after completing his primary school education at the Anglican School, and chose to join the British West Indies Regiment when he was 17, fighting for the United Kingdom in the Weltkrieg and stationed in Egypt.\n\nAfter returning home in 1918, he became active politically, being influential in the establishment of the Grenada Representative Government Movement and the Grenada Union of Returned Soldiers.\n\nIn 1921, he moved to Trinidad, where he was exposed to the political thought of Marcus Garvey. He came to prominence in 1935, when he led a Hunger March in Port of Spain, and became an incredibly influential figure in West Indian socialism. Now, he leads the British Citizens' and Workers Home Rule Party and hopes to elevate the position of trade unions.§!"
 WIF_tubal_uriah_butler_army_chief_desc: "§YBorn:§! §LJanuary 21st, 1897, in St. George's, Grenada, British Windward Islands§!\n§YBackground:§! §LBeyond championing his enthusiastic political activism throughout the Caribbean, Butler also enjoys de-facto command over the socialist movement's more militant actions. His experience as a veteran of the Great War, serving with the West Indies Regiment in Egypt, as well as his many brawls and skirmishes with colonial authorities in Trinidad and Grenada hardened him as well as tough him the basics of strategy, tactics and warfare. Although Butler is more accustomed to the garrison duty he did in Egypt and rallying militias in the Trinidad oil fields, he's slowly but surely been able to adapt his military cunning to wage a larger scale of guerrilla warfare against the British and French overlords.§!\n\n§YNotes: Lacks a lot of knowledge about military strategy, but has the charisma and willpower to command his soldiers Has been battle hardened from his time in the Great War and fighting colonial troops in Trinidad, as such he's more than willing to go into battle alongside his men.§!"

 WIF_aime_cesaire_leader_desc: "§YBorn:§! §LJune 26th, 1913, in Basse-Pointe, Martinique, French Republic§!\n§YBackground:§! §LFrom an early age, Aimé was greatly inspired by his grandfather Fernand Césaire who had been the first black teacher in the French colony who passed down a great deal of literary and scholarly aptitude to his grandson. After working his way through high school, Aimé Césaire journeyed to the Commune of France in 1931, disgusted with the colonial system of the West Indies and seeking to pursue the kind of higher education he had been unable to attain on his home island. During his sojourn at the Sorbonne University, he joining with a cadre of other black students, eventually founding a newspaper dubbed "L'Étudiant Noir" which promoted anti imperialist ideals and railed against the exiled French Republic's treatment of their colonial subjects. Aimé also coined the term Négritude, a literary movement promoting a revitalisation of African and Caribbean culture, as well as condemned the irreparable damage caused by the "decadent, morally degenerated parasites" who had oppressed his people. Due to his increasing conflicts with fellow students and teachers in the Commune, which he attributed to racial tensions and prejudice, Aimé eventually chose to return back to the West Indies Federation, just in time to bear witness to the people of the Caribbean cast off their chains. Invigorated by the struggle for liberation, he directed his revolutionary zeal and anti colonial fury towards building up and impressive line of credentials, penning radical treatises and holding fiery speeches on what he desired and demanded the new socialist government must due for the victims of imperialism. It was no surprise that in time, Césaire took it upon himself to see this dreams made reality, in a few years managing to rise to the top of the new Federation's political sphere.§!"

Lagrosillière is a strong proponent of turning colonies into Departments, and the Federation of Martinique, without Lagrosillière, fell apart. It was revived in 1924 as the Second Federation. However, Lagrosillière continued his socialist advocacy in the Caribbean, continuing to become a politician in the West Indies Federation after the Weltkrieg.\n\nIn 1919, he made an electoral alliance with Fernand Clerc, a Béké industrialist on the island, which alienated him from his old socialist allies that criticised his 'alliance with capitalists'. He was arrested in 1925 for inciting trouble and violence, and again in 1931 for influence peddling.\n\nNow, Lagrosillière leads the PA and the West Indies into a new era of social democracy.§!"

He was later made a captain of the regiment, accompanying it to the European front lines where he grew rapidly impressed with how capable the dark skinned soldiers were. He later attributed his comradeship with his men as the turning point which made him embrace the idea that the people of the Caribbean should be given self governance. After returning back to Trinidad he began to live and work among the colony's dark skinned workers, building up a network of labour unions and popularity among citizens from all ethnic backgrounds and works of life. His military experience and knowledge of the inner workings of British Colonialism became incredibly helpful to the Caribbean socialists on the outbreak of their revolution, with Cipriani being accepted as one of the revolution's founding fathers, among men like Tubal Uriah Butler.§!\n\n§YNotes: In 1923 he served as President of the Trinidad Worker's Association, later rechristened to the Trinidad Labour Party.
