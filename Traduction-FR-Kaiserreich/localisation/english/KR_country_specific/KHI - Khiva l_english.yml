### Characters ###
 KHI_junaid_khan: "Junaid Khan"
 KHI_junaid_khan_leader_desc: "§YBorn:§! §L1857, in Badirkent, Dashoguz, Khanate of Khiva§!\n§YBackground:§! §LThe son of powerful Junaid Yomut Turkmen headman Hoji Bek, the ambitious Muhammad-Kurban quickly rose to a position of prominence in his village, cutting his teeth in the failed resistance against Russian conquest of 1873. Though he could not read or write, Muhammad gained widespread fame among the Turkmen tribes as an impartial and just leader after sentencing his own cousin to death as a village judge. Strangled by the oppression of the Uzbek Khan of Khiva, Isfandiyar, and his Russian overlords, the Turkmen chiefs rallied behind him, proclaiming him Junaid Khan and marching on the capital. Isfandiyar Khan named Junaid Khan his Serdar Karim, or noble commander, in hopes of placating the Turkmen host, but would skirmish with his commander until the summer of 1917, when Khiva erupted into violence between the socialist Young Khivans and the Khan’s loyalists, giving Junaid Khan the opportunity to decisively conquer the city.\n\nJunaid Khan put the milk-drinker Isfandiyar to death, installing his plyable brother Sayid Abdullah as the new puppet Khan and taking charge of the Khanate as an absolute military dictator. In the years following, Junaid Khan has crushed the rebellious Turkmen tribes, defeated the Red Army, and carved away huge swathes of Transcaspian land from Russian hands. While he ostensibly remains a loyal servant of Moscow, he strains constantly against the gilded leash holding him within Russia’s orbit, seeking an opportunity to free the Turkmen people of foreign domination once and for all. Junaid Khan may be ancient, but he has not slowed down in his advanced age, and his enemies know well to tremble when they hear the sound of his advancing horns.§!"

### Focus ###
 KHI_focus: "[KHI.GetName] Focus Tree"

 KHI_one_khanate_two_khans: "One Khanate, Two Khans"
 KHI_one_khanate_two_khans_desc: "The Qungrat Khans have long been a useful tool for our regime, granting us the legitimacy that an unambiguous tribal stratocracy would lack. In recent days, however, Sayid Abdullah has clamored for increased responsibilities. While concessions to the puppet monarch potentially threatens Junaid Khan's iron grip over the Khanate, investing in the image of Sayid Abdullah could give Khiva a true symbol to march for."

 KHI_listen_to_the_councilors: "Listen to the Councilors"
 KHI_listen_to_the_councilors_desc: "Many of the more entrenched administrators and advisors in Khiva have precious little in common with their leader, forced to follow the orders of a coarse Turkmen warchief who has only a tenuous grasp on literacy and little love for the complexities of bureaucracy. Junaid Khan knows well that he cannot rule alone and has increasingly turned to the advice of his closest advisors, who have steered the grizzled autocrat into a period of relative stability."

 KHI_gateway_into_CA: "Gateway into Central Asia"
 KHI_gateway_into_CA_desc: "With our position directly across the Caspian from Baku, our small Khanate serves as the axis between East and West. In recent years the European powers have looked more and more toward the last remnants of Russian colonial adventurism with curiosity and interest, and with our clever manipulation of Russian overseers and periodic misplacement of cargo, we will reap the rewards."

 KHI_attract_adventurers_and_exiles: "Attract Adventurers and Exiles"
 KHI_attract_adventurers_and_exiles_desc: "There are a great number of men in this world who want little more than the chance for gold and glory, or merely a fresh start. After all, the Russian Civil War bred many who value the indiscretion of Junaid Khan's government above all else, and many have invaluable experience fighting on the steppes. Who cares if they rose arms against us decades ago? What matters now is that they are willing to raise arms with us today."

 KHI_our_clandestine_supporters: "Our Clandestine Supporters"
 KHI_our_clandestine_supporters_desc: "While officially our government has remained squarely within the Russian sphere, even following its disastrous defeat in the Weltkrieg, a few dark back offices in Berlin and Istanbul have long been devoted to fermenting a Central Asian revolt in the event of another Great European war. If we hope to cast off the vestiges of Russian domination, we will need the help of her enemies, both through intelligence and materiel."

 KHI_caspian_gunrunners: "Expanding the Network"
 KHI_caspian_gunrunners_desc: "Opponents of Junaid Khan have often described him as a bandit or a criminal. While both of these titles are not fitting for the Noble Commander, it is no lie that he has pragmatically forged connections with smugglers and unscrupulous gun runners, who offer to transport dubiously procured foreign weaponry across the Caspian Sea...for a price of course."

 KHI_expand_kyzyl_su: "Expand the Kyzyl Su Harbors"
 KHI_expand_kyzyl_su_desc: "Over 200 years ago the Russian commander Aleksandr Bekovich-Cherkassky landed at the mouth of the dried Uzboy River with an expedition aimed at crushing the Khanate of Khiva. While our wily ancestors bested this foolish invader, his landing point would become the entryway of Russian influence and investment for nearly a century. Today, the port of Kyzyl Su is a major conduit between Europe and Asia, expanding it will serve us well."

 KHI_connect_transcaspia: "Connecting Transcaspia"
 KHI_connect_transcaspia_desc: "The Transcaspian Railway is both a lifeline for our nation and a symbol of our years of subservience to Moscow, connecting the great cities of Central Asia with the Caspian Sea trade networks. With the city of Ashkhabad under Persian control, however, the rail lines have been split and our cargo has fallen under increasing layers of scrutiny. By building a small connection to bypass this obstacle, we could solidify the stability of our Central Asian trade network."

 KHI_hire_foreign_engineers: "Hire Foreign Engineers"
 KHI_hire_foreign_engineers_desc: "The unfortunate truth is that there are few in Khiva who are well versed in matters of modern engineering, and thus our attempts to build any sort of industry or arsenal has been hampered by technical inadequacy and repeated setbacks and failures. The simplest solution would be to hire a cadre of experienced engineers from Europe and Anatolia to oversee our operations."

 KHI_rebuild_manufactories: "Rebuild the Manufactories"
 KHI_rebuild_manufactories_desc: "Khiva has never been an industrial city, and, like most of Central Asia, has suffered from a lack of investment and a colonial economic structure which disincentivizes industrial growth. However, some light industry was constructed in Kyzyl Su and Khiva itself at the height of German investment into the east, and the shadow remnants of this period of development remain, waiting to be exploited."

 KHI_reinforce_khiva: "Reinforce Khiva"
 KHI_reinforce_khiva_desc: "Khiva stands as a city outside of this era, isolated and ancient, the relic of a glorious past and a history of decline and stagnation. While Junaid technically rules from the capital, he is vulnerable within its walls, surrounded by dissidents and spies and disconnected from his Turkmen supporters. Expanding the connections between Khiva and the base of Junaid's support - namely the Turkmen controlled hinterlands of the Khanate - may be necessary if the Noble Commander hopes to survive."

 KHI_unite_the_tribes: "Unite the Tribes"
 KHI_unite_the_tribes_desc: "Junaid Khan rose to power on the back of widespread Turkmen tribal revolt, which threatened to unravel the Khanate of Khiva entirely. In the aftermath of this revolution, Junaid Khan assimilated the royal government's bureaucracy, losing the favor of some of the more independent Turkmen leaders. We cannot afford to appear impotent or weak and risk losing control of the Turkmen tribes! The rebellious chiefs will be brought back into the fold, or otherwise eliminated."

 KHI_support_aral_farmers: "Support Aral Farmers"
 KHI_support_aral_farmers_desc: "The fertile lands abutting the Aral Sea serve as both the breadbasket of our Khanate and our main source of exports. While our attempts to break into European markets with our foodstuffs has been rebuffed by the Mitteleuropa system's reliance on Ukrainian grain, increasing instability in those markets and across the Atlantic could prove to be a major boon for us. Our farmers must be supported so that they can be prepared for this opportunity."

 KHI_junaids_horsemen: "Junaid's Horsemen"
 KHI_junaids_horsemen_desc: "The core of Junaid Khan's personal army is a band of fierce Turkmen horsemen, loyal and committed warriors who have followed their chief since the days he first marched on Khiva. These once great warriors have grown old, however, and their days of fighting are numbered. We should use them to train a new generation of loyal fighting men, marked by the victories of their forefathers."

 KHI_procure_advanced_designs: "Procure Advanced Designs"
 KHI_procure_advanced_designs_desc: "While the heart of our military might is our cavalry, it would be foolish to disregard the specialized weapons and equipment which were developed during the Great European War. There are smugglers and merchants in our employ who can procure some designs which, while obsolete for the armies of Germany or France, would revolutionize our fighters."

 KHI_ideas_of_azis_khan: "The Ideas of Aziz Khan"
 KHI_ideas_of_azis_khan_desc: "While no one would dare to say it out loud, Junaid Khan is not exactly the most ideologically coherent leader, whose focus rarely strays from his personal patronage network and the protection of the Turkmen clans. To fill this gap, his lieutenant Aziz Khan has promoted a blend of rigid militarism, Islamic traditionalism and Anti-Russian sentiment to better sell our regime to all of Junaid's subjects."

 KHI_eliminate_dissenters: "Eliminate Dissenters"
 KHI_eliminate_dissenters_desc: "When the weak Khan Isfandiyar kowtowed to the whims of the Young Khivans, he doomed the city to a period of violence and disorder which threatened to dismantle the state entirely. Luckily, Junaid Khan rose to the occasion, casting out the Jadid ringleaders and securing the stability of the Khanate. He must complete the job he started in the spring of 1918, by crushing the last remnants of this fifth-column before they can once again rend our lands asunder."

 KHI_purge_nepotistic_appointments: "Purge Nepotistic Appointments"
 KHI_purge_nepotistic_appointments_desc: "Over time, our military hierarchy has been infected by a growing cadre of unqualified officers, the sons and nephews of prominent warriors and leading patriarchs. These blue blooded scions may have the right names, but they lack the experience required to lead. By shuffling these appointments into meaningless positions while weeding out the most promising candidates from among their ranks for training, we could revolutionize the quality of our officers."

 KHI_streamline_the_command: "Streamline the Command"
 KHI_streamline_the_command_desc: "Currently, we field a parallel military, with a mostly Uzbek Royal Army made up of militia units serving alongside a mostly Turkmen cadre of tribal riders. These two elements of our military use separate commanders, rely on separate baggage chains, speak through different codes and languages, and rarely work well together. By fully subordinating the Royal Army under the structure of the Turkmen riders, we can rectify some of these issues."

 KHI_tip_of_the_spear: "The Tip of the Spear"
 KHI_tip_of_the_spear_desc: "Our successes on the battlefield have been achieved on the back of audacious action and bold maneuvering, making up for these technological deficits by fighting ferociously against our enemies in ways they neither expected or prepared for. The modern war is dominated by heartless metal and demoralized soldiery fighting in foreign battlefields, completely unprepared for the driven desire for victory in our own forces."

 KHI_our_fight: "Junaid Khan's Last Gambit"
 KHI_our_fight_desc: "Some armies fight to survive, while others fight to conquer. Some armies fight out of fear for their commander, and some fight out of love for their leaders. For Junaid Khan, it matters little whether his soldiers ride with him out of fear, love, greed, or duty, so long as they ride. The steppes are ripe for conquest, and Junaid Khan will be the man to see them united, behind an army of misfits and murderers, loyal tribesmen and opportunistic mercenaries."

 KHI_one_khan: "The Great Unifier"
 KHI_one_khan_desc: "Junaid Khan has long reigned as the undisputed leader of the Turkmen of the Aral Sea, but his role as leader of Khiva's Uzbek subjects is tenuous at best. While he has little personal interest in catering to the Uzbeks, we cannot afford to leave half of our population feeling like they have no place in our government and no figure advocating for their wellbeing. We must position Junaid Khan as the ruler of all our citizens, and as the great unifier of Khiva."

 KHI_pivot_against_russia: "Marshal Forces Against the Eagle"
 KHI_pivot_against_russia_desc: "Junaid Khan is, above all, a warrior - and warriors do not bow to foreign aggressors. When in 1929 the armies of Moscow showed weakness, the armies of Khiva showed strength. History shall repeat itself, and Russian blood will be shed in the Amu Darya!"

 KHI_forced_meritocracy: "Forced Meritocracy"
 KHI_forced_meritocracy_desc: "When a clan's chief falls in battle, should his favored lieutenant succeed him, or should his son? Neither, says Junaid Khan - the man who raises his chief's banner and charges back into the fray is best suited to lead. When Khiva's armies were tested in 1917, they showed their mettle. When they once again mounted the saddle at the height of the Tashkent Crisis, a new generation of men proved themselves. Arise, sons of Khiva! Our armies will be forged in the crucible of violence!"

 KHI_country_intro_header_2: "Waiting to Seize the Occasion"
 KHI_country_intro_content: "When the Tashkent Soviet was proclaimed, the effects of the Russian Civil War spread to the Khanate of Khiva. The Noble Commander of Khan Asfandiyar Khan, Muhammed-Kurban, overthrew the government and executed the ruling Khan. Taking the title Junaid Khan, he installed the late Khan's brother as a meek puppet ruler, while controlling the city from a position behind the throne. Now the commander of the Khivan Khanate, he led an army against neighboring Bolshevik villages, securing the borders of the old Khivan protectorate before pledging his Basmachi soldiers in support of the White Turkestan Army's rapid advance southwards towards Ashgabat.\n\nSoon after, the civil war had ended, and with the reaffirmation of the previous treaties with Moscow, the Khanate of Khiva remained a Russian protectorate. But though his control over Khiva was absolute, Junaid Khan chafed under the thumb of the Commander in Tashkent. Still, he was able to leverage Khiva's position to maintain a certain degree of independence."
 KHI_country_intro_content_1: "Junaid Khan paced like a cornered fox, uncomfortable with Khiva's weak position in the slow sedimentation of post-revolution Central Asia. Best suited to making the bold and calculated risks of the battlefield, Junaid had no head for taxation and trade squabbles, leaving much of the day-to-day administration to the remnants of the late Isfandiyar's administration. However, Junaid would soon prove to be a tough and unpredictable negotiator on the national stage, as Russian agents were soon to learn. Junaid was able to drag out negotiations between Khiva and her overlord, squeezing, cajoling, threatening, and bribing his way into a number of concessions for the rump Khanate which allowed it to retain some economic freedom, while guaranteeing the continued existence of his army of hardened horsemen - all supposedly necessary to defend the region against Bolshevik banditry.\n\nSensing opportunity amidst the chaos of 1929, Junaid Khan assembled a host of riders and rode against the rudderless and crumbling Transcaspian administration. With the effects of the New Year's Coup and the disintegration of command from Tashkent profoundly demoralizing his opponents and drawing a significant number of soldiers north towards the action, Junaid managed to outmaneuver his opponents in a number of quick victories, carving out a kingdom on the way south towards Ashgabat. With an army of bandit riders descending upon them, the Russian garrison at Ashgabat turned to unlikely allies, requesting that the Persians intervene to secure the rail junction until the situation in Transcaspia was stabilized and the Russian army arrived in force.\n\nThe arrival of the Persians ended any Khivan pretensions of a glorious conquest of Ashgabat, and instead Junaid turned his attention north. Riding to secure more Aral Sea coastline, he quickly came to blows with the militias of the Alash Autonomy. While his forces were able to escape from the expedition in one piece, the tenuousness of the situation caught up to Junaid, forcing him to lick his wounds and consolidate control over southern Transcaspia."
 KHI_country_intro_content_2: "The aftermath of the Tashkent Crisis stretched the administrative apparatus of the Khanate of Khiva to its limits. While Junaid Khan proved his prowess on the battlefield, the integration of former Transcaspian land proved to be a sloppy and haphazard affair, and revealed both personal and institutional deficiencies under his rule. In the following years, the Noble Commander's focused on forging a distinct Turkmen identity among the tribesmen of Khiva, a task which has been complicated by intertribal feuds and push back from the Uzbek merchants and laborers who make up the backbone of the Khanate's titular capital.\n\nWhile the economy and governance of the Khanate stagnated as the spoils and loot of the Tashkent Crisis ran ever lower, the army of Khiva did not suffer from these years of peace. In fact, after significant investment into their training and armament, the personal horsemen of Junaid Khan are perhaps the most dangerous force in Central Asia, an honor which they do not loathe to prove on the battlefield. With such an asset, Junaid eyes his neighbors hungrily, testing their defenses with small raids and waiting for a sign of weakness to be exploited."

### Events ###
 khikhan.100.t: "The Bandit Kingdom Rides On"
 khikhan.100.d: "By all accounts, Junaid Khan was destined to be an imperceptible blip in the grand scheme of historical movements and events. Born into the leadership of a minor noble house of the Khivan Yomuts, Junaid Khan spent most of his life tending to the issues of his village - collecting rainwater and maintaining irrigation trenches, adjudicating disputes, and drilling the small band of household warriors pledged to his family. When the old Khivan suzerain Isfandiyar Khan tripled the taxes demanded of his Yomut subjects, however, Junaid Khan would join the punitive expedition against the Khan, standing proud behind Shammi-Kel Khan and his five hundred brave companions and making a name for himself in the fighting, as well as the Russian mediated negotiations which followed. When Isfandiyar Khan again attempted to undercut the independence of his Turkmen subjects, Junaid Khan killed him and seized power in Khiva, maintaining his rule through force of arms and the loyalty of his closest cadre of warriors.\n\nUnder any other circumstances, this would be the height of the ambitious Khan's power, but the Russian Civil War, and the tumultuous peace which has followed, has only given Junaid Khan more opportunities to expand his realm through glorious conquest, and to cleanse the realm through brutal cunning. Today, Junaid Khan stands at the top of a grandiose castle built of cards - should he lose his balance the whole edifice will come crumbling down. But if he can find a way to outmanoeuvre his enemies and allies alike, he may yet come away from it all on top. After all, it is a miracle that the Turkmen-led Khanate of Khiva remains, what is just one more miracle?"
 khikhan.100.a: "We will achieve it all, or lose everything!"

 khikhan.101.t: "Our Treaties with Russia"
 khikhan.101.d: "When the Russians reaffirmed the old treaties which bind our Khanate to them as a Protectorate, Khiva was little more than a backwater city-state. As the twenties rolled on, few thought that there would be much change to the status-quo. While the aging Basmachi and Jadids bickered, the cotton continued to flow north from the emporiums and markets of Tashkent. When the Russian Commander of the Turkestan Military District, Vladimir Dmitriyevich Grigoryev, marched his forces in support of an anti-government coup, the time was ripe for change!\n\nStriking deep into Transcaspia, Junaid Khan was shocked to find little resistance from the Russian garrisons. Caught in the confusion of the coup and with contradictory orders from Tashkent and Moscow, most were demobilized or had retreated to the cities to wait out the instability. With the doors to Transcaspia open, Junaid Khan swept across the region, seizing a number of villages and depots. When the Russians attempted to meet him, reduced as they were, he defeated them in a number of bold attacks. Only after the hosts of the Alash Autonomy marched to meet him did Junaid Khan meet a foe he could not outmaneuver. With the Russian's situation across Central Asia falling apart, Junaid was able to negotiate a number of treaties with Moscow's agents, which reaffirmed the protectorate status of Khiva, while respecting Junaid Khan's de-facto dominion over Transcaspia. Of course, the Russians care little for the Turkmen countryside, so long as the rail lines to Ashgabat were safe and protected."
 khikhan.101.a: "The trains always seem slightly lighter by the time they reach the coast..."

 khikhan.102.t: "The Coming Storm"
 khikhan.102.d: "In comparison to the stormy days of the New Year's Coup, the last half decade has been a period of peace and stagnation, as all sides lick their wounds and hope to recover. Central Asia stands today as a pot teetering on the edge of boiling over, with intellectuals, bandits, revolutionaries, and despots all looking to carve away at the status quo. Across the borders, the Russian command staff draws out plans and calculates logistics, gleefully awaiting the moment when the humiliations of the Tashkent Crisis can be avenged, and generals champ at the bit, waiting for permission from their superiors to crush the autonomies and protectorates once and for all. It is only a matter of time before open conflict once again breaks out in Central Asia, and yet the armies and militias of the states found within the region are universally undisciplined, underfunded, and barely functional. It will take quite a bit of work to reforge peasant rabble and upjumped bandits into true armies, and one can only guess how each polity plans to reform their armies.\n\nHowever, there is one thing which is certain - §Rthe peace of ‘29 will not last.§!"
 khikhan.102.a: "Junaid Khan will lead us to victory!"

 khikhan.103.t: "An Envoy from Turkestan"
 khikhan.103.d: "Officially, the Khanate of Khiva is a nation loyal to the whims and wills of Moscow, regardless of its legal status as an independent nation. In the years following Russia's displays of weakness in the Manchurian Conflict and Tashkent Crisis, however, we have begun angling ourselves towards a more openly antagonistic stance against our handlers in Moscow. Our ultimate goal is to maintain our political independence from the whims of Moscow, without fear of Cossacks marching through the streets of Khiva once more. Of course, our efforts remain wholly clandestine, especially while the Russian Permanent Military Advisor, General-Major Ivan Zaytsev, remains in Khiva. Luckily, years of cooperation have forged a close relationship between Zaytsev and Junaid Khan, and the Russian General is willing to close his eyes in the face of smuggling and corruption, having largely written it off as the grease necessary to keep the wheels of our informal administration turning.\n\nIt is these very smuggling networks which have drawn the newly appointed Turkestani diplomat Alihan Tura to Khiva. Officially he has traveled across the Kyzylkum to negotiate the release of a waylaid shipment of cotton bound for the markets of Tashkent, but the true purpose of his trip into our capital is quite a bit more nefarious. In recent years, we have secretly sold considerable quantities of Weltkrieg surplus arms to the Turkestan Republic, brought into our ports on hidden holds from friendly nations across the Caspian. During this most recent meeting, our commander Aziz Khan negotiated a further shipment of arms to Tashkent, including a handful of Austrian Minenwerfer M 14 mortars, in return for Turkestani gold and cotton, two valuable resources on the international market."
 khikhan.103.a: "Pleasure doing business with them!"

 khikhan.104.t: "Black Monday Arrives"
 khikhan.104.d: "Khiva has never been a hub of industry or the producer of anything of real value, but it has long sat on the axis of east and west, a conduit by which overland trade may flow. It was Khiva which most benefited when tensions rose between Turkestan and Russia, as more and more trains carrying Bukhara's cotton and gold rumbled through Khivan cities to dodge Tashkent's tariffs. Of course, anyone who reaps the rewards of global trade must also suffer its faults, and the recent market crash in Berlin has been an exceptional lesson in this truth. Less trains means less to tax and less to pilfer, and, worse yet more eyes on those trains still passing through, harboring smuggled goods from foreign lands and ‘officially hostile' governments. However, this terrible jolt to the global economy may have some unintended benefits for our government - as Russian business interests pull away from foreign entanglements, Moscow's control over our lands lessens somewhat."
 khikhan.104.a: "Regardless, our recovery will be difficult"

 khikhan.105.t: "Conclusion of the Chardzhui Exercises"
 khikhan.105.d: "While Junaid Khan would certainly like to think otherwise, the Khanate of Khiva is heavily influenced by Moscow, mainly through the position of the permanent Russian Advisor to the Khivan Military. While the relationship between the military advisor and the Serdar Karim was rocky throughout the 1920's, with the latter chafing under the increasingly authoritarian missives of his Russian counterpart, this dynamic changed dramatically with the return of Ivan Matveyevich Zaytsev in the aftermath of the Tashkent Crisis. General-Major Zaytsev is no stranger to Khiva and Turkestan, having served alongside Junaid Khan during the Russian Civil War. During the conflict, the two military minded men forged a cordial martial comradery which was integral to their eventual victory over the Soviets. General Zaytsev returned north to Orenburg to teach in the years following the conclusion of the Civil War, but the failure of General Luka Kondratovich to prevent Junaid Khan's intervention into the Tashkent Crisis led to his dismissal and the return of Zaytsev as Moscow's man on the ground in Khiva.\n\nLuckily for Junaid Khan, General Zaytsev has proved to be a hands-off overseer and an incredibly hands-on instructor, with the vast majority of his time devoted to training and organizing the Khanate's army into a modern fighting force. The cadet school he has built has already begun training new officers, and the effects of his diligence can be seen in the creation of some more formal cavalry units, a far cry from the rag-tag bands of bandits which make up the bedrock of the Khivan military. Unfortunately, the General's triumphant return from Khiva's first formal military exercises, held in the border town of Chardzhui, will likely be his last. Recent health episodes have given credence to the rumours hanging around Zaytsev, claiming that the aging General will likely retire from his post before the end of the year. Such news is unfortunate, as Ivan Zaytsev has proven himself to be a boon to the Khanate and Junaid Khan's rule. There is little doubt that his replacement will be unable to fill his shoes."
 khikhan.105.a: "Prepare a parade in his honour!"

 khikhan.106.t: "Zaytsev Retires"
 khikhan.106.d: "Terse words fill a quiet antechamber of the Khan's palace, echoing out into royal halls. On one side, General Ivan Zaytsev, permanent Russian Advisor to the Khivan Military, stands solemn and tight-lipped, explaining his imminent departure from the city. On the other, Junaid Khan demands answers from his long standing ally, increasingly furious over Zaytsev's recalcitrance. For years, Zaytsev has served as a vital middleman in Khiva's administration, bridging the gap between the sandstone spires of Khiva and the grand domes of Moscow and smoothing the increasingly tumultuous relationship between the two nations. For Junaid Khan, Zaytsev is Khiva's window into the Russian mindset, a man who understands the inner workings of the Russian military and political elite, whose knowledge has allowed Junaid Khan to navigate the rocky negotiations of the last decade with confidence. For Russia, Zaytsev is their man in the Khivan camp, an agent planted deep in Junaid Khan's inner circle, steering him ever closer towards integration and away from the foolishness of resistance. For his part, Zaytsev has juggled his responsibilities expertly, balancing incongruent and often conflicting directives.\n\nUntil now, that is.\n\nZaytsev has tendered his resignation and announced his imminent retirement, claiming that he wishes to return to his homeland in his advanced age. Between the lines of this banal explanation, however, lies more sinister indications. For months, Zaytsev has privately expressed his concerns that Boris Savinkov's government sees him as an obstacle, rather than an asset. For the liberal government of the previous decade, Zaytsev's personal friendship with Junaid Khan was key to their continued delicate control over the Khanate. To Savinkov, however, Zaytsev is at best an untrustworthy bureaucrat, and at worst a Khivan agent, feeding Junaid Khan the information he needs to resist potential Russian military intervention. Zaytsev has not stated outright that he has been force out, but with Savinkov moving to clamp down on all elements of the military not devoted to his national populist crusade, there is little doubt that this ouster has been orchestrated in Moscow.\n\nJunaid Khan has warned Zaytsev that he will not accept any man Russia sends to replace him in his role, though both men recognize that such a provocation is likely exactly what Savinkov desires. Without Zaytsev's influence, the informal arrangements binding Khiva to Russia are all but broken, marking a new chapter in the two nation's relationship."
 khikhan.106.a: "But who will replace him?"

 khikhan.107.t: "Moscow's Arrogance"
 khikhan.107.d: "The departure of General-Major Ivan Zaytsev from the court at Khiva has led to a flurry of activity, as a decade of political and practical construction are rearranged, abandoned, and revived. Moscow has sent a new advisor, General Vasily Morozov, to Junaid Khan's court, but he quickly proved himself vain, brash, and arrogant. Following a particularly brazen audience with the Serdar Karim, this Russian stooge has been stripped of all actual power, restricted to his chambers, and excluded from all meetings of state. Actions in Moscow telegraph new efforts in Russia to strip us of our independence, and while sidelining Russian agents will certainly ruffle feathers with Savinkov and his cronies, we would be fools to leave them in a position to act against us. On that note, Junaid Khan has taken a personal interest in the development of the  Khiva Military School, ensuring the ideological loyalty of the incoming graduates who will make up the backbone of his army.\n\nThe time has come to revive Khiva's secret agreements of mutual defense and military coordination with the Turkestani warlord Madamin Bek. His minister Alihan Tura has already reached out to our government in the hopes of revitalizing the understanding we shared with Madamin Bek and his government in the years prior to the Tashkent Crisis, a secret pact which helped to bring him into prominence in Turkestan and which led to our control over much of Transcaspia. We will send Aziz Khan to Tashkent to forge a new understanding with Turkestan, one which may serve to save us from Russia's wroth."
 khikhan.107.a: "A new chapter for Khiva!"

 khikhan.108.t: "The Khivan Kerfuffle"
 khikhan.108.d: "The ruler of our de-facto protectorate in Khiva, the backwards Turkmen warlord Junaid Khan, has long rejected our generous guidance of his rump state, instead attacking brave Russian sons in Ashgabat and Krasnovodsk at the height of the Tashkent Crisis. It does not take a genius to recognize that Khiva will never truly serve us as a loyal subordinate, he is a dog who has bit his master once - the only reasonable course of action is to put him down. Instead, the weak governments of Rudnev and Maklakov rewarded this mad dog with recognition of his illegal control over Transcaspia and the abandonment of any real Russian dominion over the Khivans. This embarrassing course of action has been spearheaded by our leading agent in Khiva, the Kornilovite General Ivan Zaytsev, who has “gone native,” aligning himself with Junaid Khan at the expense of his homeland. To rectify these mistakes, we moved to force Zaytsev out, blackmailing him with dubious charges of corruption. He has been replaced with a more trustworthy court advisor, General Vasily Ivanovich Morozov. In response, Junaid Khan has placed General Morozov into glorified house arrest, restricting him from leaving the old city of Khiva or interacting with with Russia-sponsored Khiva Military School!\n\nJunaid Khan's brazen acts have threatened to dismember our informal control over the region, and our remaining agents in Khiva report that he intends to strengthen ties with the rogue Turkestani Republic. Without the full support and control of the military, an intervention into Khiva over Junaid Khan's provocations would be dangerous and difficult. Instead, our agents within the Khanate have proposed that we provide clandestine support for the imprisoned Khivan Khan, who, if restored to power through a coup, would certainly prove to be a more pliable puppet. In the meantime, we will have to swallow our pride and ignore the mad dog in Khiva, lest we provide him with any more popular support by acting against him."
 khikhan.108.a: "Prepare a coup, the sooner the better..."
 khikhan.108.b: "Forget a coup and ignore this fool!"

 khikhan.109.t: "Half the Fealty, Double the Agent"
 khikhan.109.d: "Espionage may be the hardest test there is for loyalty to one's leader. Both fear and temptations surround spies constantly, and we are more than willing to provide foreign agents with both increased fears of discovery and death, and increased offers of reward for disloyalty.\n\nRecently, messages found their way into our possession from a spy sent into our city by the perfidious Emir of Bukhara. This Bukharan turncoat has offered to turn his services from the court of Bukhara to our own, by dead-dropping information he has gleaned as a member of the Bukharan spy network in return for large sums of wealth. It looks like lady luck was not on this turncoat's side, however, as the 'anonymous' method of contact he employed to reach out to us is less anonymous than expected, allowing us to tail the would-be double agent back to his lodgings, revealing himself as a moderately prominent rug merchant. While simply eliminating this Bukharan spy would make our city one bit more secure, we have the opportunity to squeeze what could be a considerable amount of information about our enemies from him if he is left alive. How shall we proceed?"
 khikhan.109.a: "Use this knowledge to leverage a reduced rate for his services."
 khikhan.109.b: "Ensure an “accident” befalls this untrustworthy fellow."

 khikhan.110.t: "To Forgive or to Flay"
 khikhan.110.d: "We are more than aware of the corruption plaguing our Emirate, but we had hoped that it didn't go beyond money changing hands to grease the wheels of bureaucracy. Unfortunately, it appears we were overly optimistic. One of our most prolific informants within the city of Khiva, an Uzbek rug merchant with ties within the Khanate's bureaucracy, has recently fallen under suspicion. Associates of our man in Khiva have recently proven that he has recently acquired a sum of money with no ties to his business dealings, leading us to assume that could only have come from Junaid Khan and his cronies, either as a bribe or more insidiously, as proof that this agent has been playing both sides of the spy game. Additionally, rumours have swirled around the Khivan court that the long moribund Khiva Intelligence Department has recently roared back to life, further indicating the guilt of our asset. We will simply have to accept that one of our best is probably not as loyal as we hoped.\n\nWhile many are ready to eliminate our agent and start from scratch, some say that this operation may still be salvaged. If confronted with evidence of his betrayal, he might be ready to switch back to his original allegiance - with the added benefit of having the trust of Junaid Khan and the Khivans. Is it worth the risk?"
 khikhan.110.a: "He is even more valuable as a double agent!"
 khikhan.110.b: "Call him on a business trip to Bukhara for the last time..."

 khikhan.111.t: "Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice..."
 khikhan.111.d: "The difficult thing about relying on people of low character is that they have rarely been swayed for the last time.\n\nThe rug-merchant-turned-Bukharan-spy-turned-double-agent we have on our payroll seems to have been discovered by those he betrayed. The men we had posted to monitor our newly acquired intelligence asset have reported that he was surprised by his Bukharan handlers within his own home, and it seems he offered to shift his allegiance back to the Emir in Bukhara.\n\nThat the offer has been made, there can be no doubt about. His coming out of it alive means he must have, at the very least, pretended to accept. Despite this, he may still be working for us and could only be handing token information to the enemy. Can we afford to take our chances?"
 khikhan.111.a: "Truly, he is a cunning asset!"
 khikhan.111.b: "This is getting ridiculous, string him up!"

 khikhan.700.t: "We Stand Victorious!"
 khikhan.700.d: "After a year of violence and death on a scale never before seen by our people, a solemn calm has fallen upon Central Asia. Our audacity has finally paid off - Alim Khan, Madamin Bek, the Russian bear, all have fallen before our host, victims of their hubris and sloth. It has not come easy. Every battleground is the final resting place of hundreds of brave boys from the Teke, Ersari, Chowdur, Gokleng, Sarlyk, and, of course, the Yomut. While their sacrifices will certainly be honoured, now is no time for remembrance or celebration. Junaid Khan now stands unopposed at the gates of the greatest cities of Central Asia, with their militias scattered, their rulers dead or hiding, and their vast quantities of wealth in sight. The choice is his - ride on these cities and claim their loot for his host, or leave them in peace, so that he may meet with them and come to some form of deal. After all, why kill the sheep for its meat when you can keep it for its wool?"
 khikhan.700.a: "And what a fat few sheep these cities are!"

 khikhan.701.t: "The Cities Swear Us Fealty"
 khikhan.701.d: "Junaid Khan is not a man of the cities - he was born and raised in the rural Turkmen communities which dominate Khorezm, and has long tried his best to spend as much time outside of Khiva as he could manage - a task made easier over time, as the borders of his realm have grown. On his return from his triumphs in the east, however, Junaid Khan has made it a point to parade through each of the great cities of Central Asia with his most loyal and veteran cadres. These visits are not merely to stoke the ego of the old Khan, however, but rather calculated manoeuvres aimed to secure a new understanding between the metropolitan constellation and the ragged tribal chief they now ostensibly serve.\n\nIn each city, Junaid Khan has held tense meetings with city councils, merchant boards, and religious leaders - haggling over the details of Turkmen rule. He intends to rule with a light glove, granting extensive autonomy and local rights in exchange for oaths of loyalty and heaps of gold. For the most part, he has been quite successful in convincing his counterparts of the wisdom of acceptance, using a mixture of charisma, guile, and open threats of violence to bring the lot of them in line. For the people of Bukhara, Samarkand, Tashkent, Kokand, Andijan...life simply continues forward as normal. In some cases, life is even improved as local strongmen are replaced by their more pliable friends, while in others the townsfolk grumble over new taxes earmarked towards appeasing the scourge of Khiva. All the while, the first trains laden with tribute make their way westwards, bound for the vaults and larders of the Grand Palace."
 khikhan.701.a: "They will come to appreciate our protection in time."

 khikhan.702.t: "Warlords and Chieftains Pledge to Us"
 khikhan.702.d: "In the whirlwind of violence which has long engulfed Central Asia, any chief or warlord worth their salt has learned that while loyalty may be a virtue, too much loyalty is liable to get you killed. Years of bouncing from one Kurbashi to another (and from Commissar to Emir to President) has taught them the art of allegiance-flexibility. Junaid Khan, the long-standing shepherd of the famously rebellious Turkmen tribes, is also an expert in allegiance-flexibility: pitting his fractious underlings against one another, making the right promises to the right men, and displaying strength of character when challenged.\n\nHaving conquered the whole of Central Asia, he has suddenly found himself at the top of a great and unstable pyramid of tribal chiefs, military leaders, and up-jumped bandits. In return for pledges of loyalty and the commitment of men and arms to Junaid Khan's private army, this motley assortment of men have been offered protection and safety. In fact, Junaid Khan has offered them exactly what most were looking for - a blind eye to their own little private fiefdoms, in exchange for little more than ancient feudal commitments. Most men spun at the opportunity to swear themselves to Junaid Khan's service, leaving only the most pig-headed and stubborn chiefs to be replaced at bayonet point with those willing to see reason."
 khikhan.702.a: "Give them freedom and they'll give us their guns."

 khikhan.703.t: "Junaid Khan Returns from the East"
 khikhan.703.d: "Riding through the fields of the Aral Basin, Junaid Khan, standing at the head of a great Turkmen host, cannot help but smile. He had finally done it - his home would be safe from the jaws of foreign dogs for the first time in his life. It was by no means an easy task. First, he had to declaw the Uzbek vultures in Khiva itself, who had long grown corpulent off of the labour of their Turkmen subjects. Next he sucked the socialist poison out of the deep cut wounds wrought by the Civil War, and further reversed centuries of oppression by casting off the Muscovite yoke. Now, he has finally unified Central Asia under the wise and hardy hand of his people. For the first time, the arms of Samarkand and Kokand and the militias of Fergana and the Aral will be brought level against those who covet our lands and our freedom, instead of being wastefully thrown against one another. They will fight in lockstep, bound by the brave hearts of their Turkmen brothers, who have guided them forward into a glorious new future.  Finally, the Turkmen people, once divided and oppressed, can live in peace. Junaid Khan was once the illiterate water distributor of the Yomut tribe, but today he is the father of all Turkmen, and furthermore the Noble Commander of all of Turkdom! His triumph is a triumph for all Turkmen! He will be celebrated all across the Aral Valley, and up both banks of the Amu Darya! His triumph is a triumph for all Turkic people! He will be feared across the world, from Samarkand to St. Petersburg!"
 khikhan.703.a: "The horns blow, the host has returned home!"

 khikhan.704.t: "Royalist Plot Uncovered"
 khikhan.704.d: "Aziz Khan met Junaid Khan's triumphant procession on the outskirts of Khiva in the early morning, bearing the grave news which he and others had uncovered only hours earlier. The Khan's nephew and son had been connected to a dangerous plot against their Serdar Karim, potential ringleaders of a coup which would see him deposed on the road, replaced by the brooding Qungrat monarch now locked in the palace. They had planted co-conspirators in key positions close to Junaid Khan, and laid the foundations for a government after the old general's departure. Of course, these would-be assassins have already been dealt with, one by the hands of Aziz Khan himself.\n\nFrankly, no one is surprised that the royalists have been conclusively proven to be snakes - they have long worked against the interests of the realm and their subjects, and are likely in the pocket of foreign powers and the Bukharan exiles. However, the audacity of this plot has shocked us. The Qungrat clan is cunning and evil, but they are also known across the line as cowards, not the kind of people to risk disrupting the status-quo at the end of a pistol. Bearing this in mind, there are some who argue that this conspiracy extends beyond the men we recently found and their monarchal patrons, and Aziz Khan intends to find its limits as soon as he can. For the time being, Junaid Khan has replaced his guards with hand-picked veterans, and known associates of the conspirators' lackeys have been imprisoned. For the meantime, however, the Khan and his family have not been arrested, so that they might accidentally smoke out some of their own friends."
 khikhan.704.a: "We will smoke out the rest."

 khikhan.1001.t: "The Caged Khan Stirs"
 khikhan.1001.d: "For sixteen years, Sayid Abdullah Khan of the Qungrats has reigned as the titular Khan of the Khanate of Khiva. Of course, Sayid Abdullah's reign is little more than a farce, with all power deeply concentrated into the hands of his 'Serdar Karim,' the Turkmen general Junaid Khan. During the first decade or so of this arrangement, the puppet Khan remained in the confines of the halls of the Palace of Narallabay, cowed by the execution of his brother Isfandiyar and the cold Turkmen guards stationed throughout the royal grounds.\n\nIn recent years, however, the noose around Sayid Abdullah's neck has appeared to slacken, with visits from friends and family increasingly permitted. The mummer's Khan has taken this opportunity to rekindle his relationship with his familial allies among the remnant Uzbek nobility, using his nephew Abdurasul as a conduit to the outside world. Junaid Khan will have to handle these new displays of independence from his puppet, lest he grow a network of supporters from the confines of Palace. The simplest option would be to leave the Khan and his family alone. While this course of action could cause problems in the future, it would avoid conflict in the short term. Alternatively, removing Abdurasul would be a straightforward way of nipping any Uzbek insurrection in the bud, but would certainly poison any chance of mending the divide between the Turkmen chiefs and the Uzbek nobles. A more radical course of action would be to invite Sayid Abdullah to take a limited role in the governance of the Khanate by appearing in public events and attending some meetings, a position which could help to unite the Khanate, but would make it all the more difficult to neutralize the Khan's supporters."
 khikhan.1001.a: "Quietly eliminate Abdurasul."
 khikhan.1001.b: "Keep an eye on them, but do nothing."
 khikhan.1001.c: "Let the Khan take over some minor formalities, what's the harm?"

 khikhan.1002.t: "Dealing with the Chiefs"
 khikhan.1002.d: "When Junaid Khan first took power, it was as the head of a vast coalition of Turkmen tribes, each with disparate goals and lingering resentment from generational feuds. It was only in their shared hatred of the Young Khivans and the weak Qungrat Khan that these different chiefs and headmen were able to put aside their personal enmity, and once they had succeeded in casting out the Khan and the liberals, they turned on their erstwhile commander. Koshmamed Khan, Shamurad Bakhshi, Gulyam Ali - Junaid Khan defeated each of his opponents in the Turkmen coalition, forcing them into submission and then exile.\n\nIt has been nearly two decades since these men were forced out of the Khanate, and for years now their relatives and descendants have clamoured for their return. Junaid Khan has already allowed Koshmamed Khan his return in exchange for hostages and renewed oaths of fealty, but the remaining two rebellious Turkmen chiefs remain in exile in Persia. Their families are powerful, even in the face of their diminished circumstances, and the days of doubt over Junaid Khan's rule over Khiva have long since passed. Perhaps it would be best for these skilled tribal leaders to return? After all, it would certainly display the Serdar Karim's magnanimity, and the advice of battle hardened Turkmen war chiefs is always preferable to that of Uzbek sycophants."
 khikhan.1002.a: "Let them return"
 khikhan.1002.b: "No leniency for traitors!"

 khikhan.1003.t: "A Student of History?"
 khikhan.1003.d: "While there are some men in Khiva who level any number of undeserved insults towards Junaid Khan, none would be foolish enough to call the Khanate's Noble Commander inexperienced. First holding the vital village posts as the gazi (judge) and mirab (water manager) of the Yomud Junaid clan, Muhammet-Gurban rose to the forefront of Turkmen tribal politics when he led their defense against the punitive expeditions of the old Qungrat Khan, the villainous Isfandiyar Khan. When the Young Khivans seized control over the capital and threatened to hold the Khanate in their godless dominion, it was Junaid Khan who rose to the rescue, unifying the quarrelsome Turkmen clans behind his rule and crushing the reformers. When Lenin and his Bolsheviks rose up in Petrograd, Junaid Khan assembled his men to fight against the Soviets. When Madamin Bek and his Kurbashi rose up in Kokand, he marched on Ashgabat.\n\nJunaid Khan has fought, worked, and ruled for nearly sixty years. These decades of demanding administration and unbridled violence left precious little time for Junaid Khan to enjoy the more cerebral activities the world has to offer, leaving him nebulously literate and uncouth, though his rough exterior hides a shrewd and cunning autocrat. When the Turkmen tribes were at their moment of greatest need, it was the wise Sufi leader Ishan Khan who nominated Junaid Khan as the man needed. Today, Ishan Khan has found a place in the Royal Court, advising the Noble Commander and engaging in religious and political debate. Most recently, the sage Ishan has begun teaching Junaid Khan about the history of Khiva, a subject which has clearly caught the imagination of the ancient city's hegemonic general."
 khikhan.1003.a: "Life can't always be horses and hand grenades"
 khikhan.1003.b: "We have no time for these classes!"

 khikhan.1004.t: "Ishan Khan's Tales: Ancient Hubris"
 khikhan.1004.d: "Junaid Khan has spent long nights in the private chambers of his old ally, the Sufi cleric Ishan Khan, enraptured by tales of ancient Khiva. In his first real lesson on the history of the city, Ishan described the rise and fall of the ancient Khwarazmian Empire. Nearly a thousand years ago, the Seljuk Mamluk commander Anushtegin Gharachai rose up, overthrowing a rebellious Shah in Khwarazm, beginning a dynasty which would come to dominate the whole of Central Asia. For generations, the Shahs of Khwarazm ruled over the lesser tribes and nobles of the steppes, creating the greatest empire of the Muslim world.\n\nWhen a rising warrior king in the far east first made contact with the ascendant Khwarazmian Empire, Khwarazmshah Muhammed II turned to the advice of his expansive Diwan, opening his ears to the whispers of his advisors. Fearing that the distant conqueror's entreaties were merely a ruse to weaken his Empire, Muhammed executed the envoys and seized their gifts, inviting the wrath of the great Khan of Khans. When the Mongol hordes assembled on the borders of the empire, the once bloodthirsty ministers were suddenly frozen in fear, and the great Empire was reduced to rubble and ash with little more than the ruins of Gurganj to show for it. Having listened attentively to Ishan throughout the story, Junaid Khan appears to have taken some lessons to heart, and may even make the trek to Gurganj to gaze upon the old stones of Khwarazm."
 khikhan.1004.a: "A commander who becomes king? Interesting..."
 khikhan.1004.b: "Muhammed II was poisoned by the cowardice of his Diwan!"
 khikhan.1004.c: "We have no more time to waste on history classes!"

 khikhan.1005.t: "Ishan Khan's Tales: Rise of the Qungrats"
 khikhan.1005.d: "Having returned from a brief visit to the decrepit ruins of Gurganj, Junaid Khan once again found himself in the private chambers of Ishan Khan, listening attentively to tales of the ancient past. The wise man began by explaining that the old city of Gurganj was finally abandoned by its last advocate, the fertile Oxus Delta. It shifted southwards five hundred years ago, settling on the current site of Khiva, which would serve as a battleground between the Uzbeks in Bukhara and Samarkand and the Shiite Shahs of Persia. For the most part, the Khans of Khiva warred against the nefarious Khans of Bukharans, warring constantly to hold control over the valuable Oxus floodplains. The Khans of Khiva found themselves trapped between Persian and Bukharan aggression, constantly fighting for survival, as though the very soil of their lands was cursed by the blood of millions of Khwarazmians. When the Bukharans' puppet, the Shibanid Ilbars Khan, followed in the footsteps of Muhammed II by executing Persia envoys, the Shiite conqueror Nadir Shah beheaded Ilbars and dismantled the Shibanid holdings.\nIshan Khan suddenly went quiet, his eyes darting around the room before settling on Junaid Khan. Speaking again in muted tones, the cleric continued, explaining that the powerful Qungrat tribe grew more and more dominant in the vacuum left from the Persian retreat. They first ruled over the Khanate through Shibanid figureheads, before Iltuzar Khan simply named himself Khan, reigning as the first Qungrat Khan of Khiva. While Iltuzar had no rights to the title by virtue of blood, his brother Muhammad Rahim would secure the Khanate for the Qungrats by virtue of battle.\nLeft restless by this story, Junaid Khan paced to his advisor's window, peering out across the torchlit city. His eyes would come to rest upon the Kuhna Ark, the citadel whose thick stone walls imprisoned his own Qungrat puppet."
 khikhan.1005.a: "The Qungrats simply...seized power?"
 khikhan.1005.b: "We have no more time to waste on history classes!"

 khikhan.1006.t: "Ishan Khan's Tales: Resisting the Russians"
 khikhan.1006.d: "Junaid Khan despised his role in the court of the Tash Chauli, the Palace of Stones, stuck handling pleas and protestations while he should have been out in the field, training and preparing his Khanate for the war to come. After a particularly trying day, Khiva's Serdar Karim found himself marching to the chambers of the sage elder Ishan Khan, longing for some respite from the backhanded politicking of the royal court. As luck would have it, the cleric would be in his home, and Junaid Khan implored his old friend to finish recounting his stories detailing the reign of the Khans of old.\n\nThey wasted little time on pleasantries before Ishan Khan began to detail the rule of the old Qungrat Khan, Shir Ghazi Khan, who found himself on the receiving end of Russian invasion nearly three centuries in the past. Prince Aleksandr Bekovich-Cherkassky marched from the Caspian to Khiva, seeking out the riches of the gold-laden Oxus River. Though the hastily assembled army of Khiva's levies was swiftly defeated, Shir Gazi was able to convince his Russian opponent that he would surrender, suggesting that the Russian expedition disperse to the countryside to better facilitate foraging. When the Russians had split their forces and settled in to secure the countryside, the Khivans, bolstered by their Turkmen allies, descended on them, slaughtering Prince Cherkassky and his army village by village, with only a few survivors left to tell the tale.\n\nThe brutal defeat of Prince Cherkassky's army would not dissuade the Russians for long, however. A century later, an expedition of camels and conscripts would set out from the north, though they would not make it far from their base in Orenburg before encountering a particularly harsh winter. With a fifth of their men and nearly half of their animals dead hundreds of miles away from the gates of Khiva, the men were forced to flee back to the Russian forts with their tails between their legs."
 khikhan.1006.a: "Guile served as Khiva's sword..."
 khikhan.1006.b: "...and the weather her shield"
 khikhan.1006.c: "We have no more time to waste on history classes!"

 khikhan.1007.t: "Ishan Khan's Tales: Fall of Khiva"
 khikhan.1007.d: "While his role as the Serdar-Karim of Khiva often prevented Juniad Khan from leaving the eponymous city, his position as the headsman of the Yomud Turkmen tribe often drew him to their grazing lands on the Aral to the northwest. Bringing his close advisor Ishan Khan with him on one such journey, the discussion on the road eventually turned back to the history of these lands.\n\nThere is little that Ishan Khan could say about the last of the Russian invasions which Junaid Khan would not already know of. Both men lived through that war, after all, and both men bore witness to the cruel efficiency of the Russian advance. As a young man, Junaid Khan served beside his father Khojibay, the headsman of the Yomud Turkmen. Even in the face of overwhelming odds, Khojibay and his young son would fight a war of attrition against the artillery and rifles of the invaders, fighting valiantly in the name of a Qungrat Khan who had already surrendered his Khanate to the infidels. Their insolence would cost their clan dearly, however, and while Muhammad Rahim Khan II happily donned his new marionette strings and settled into his role as a puppet, the Yomuds were systematically executed by the advancing Russians, cut down like wheat before the scythe.\n\nSuddenly Ishan Khan fell silent, and Junaid Khan realized that his face had settled into a grimace. While his family had fought and bled for the Khanate, the Qungrat Khan had thrown away their dignity to maintain the pathetic imitation of dominion, a sin he had righted the day he beheaded Muhammad Rahim's son. He had crushed the revolutionaries and regained the honor of Khiva, but the legacy of Russian domination still hung over the Khanate like a plague. The time for tales and reminiscences was over, but perhaps these lessons could prove useful in the fight against the Russians."
 khikhan.1007.a: "It will take guile to beat these dogs."
 khikhan.1007.b: "To be honest, I did not learn much..."

 khikhan.1008.t: "Yomud Horse Breeders"
 khikhan.1008.d: "A visitor to the Grand Bazaar of Khiva can rarely pass the stalls of the horse merchants without hearing the claim that their breeds are ‘so swift, wars have been fought over them.' While one would be right to mistrust such assertions, it just so happens that the men of Khiva are correct, whether they know it or not. Thousands of years ago, the Turkmen tribesmen bred horses whose speed, resilience, endurance, and suitability for mounted archery was unmatched. Han Chinese Emperors named this breed the “heavenly horse” and made war against the ancient Scythian oasis with the express goal of stealing away enough of these “heavenly horses” to improve their own breeding stock. Much later, the Russians would call these horses Argamaks, or “divine horses,” noting their speed, stamina, and loyalty. Of these Turkmen horses, each tribe favors specific characteristics, creating the Yomud Horse, the Tekke, the Goklan, and Nokhorli; the lineage of each individual horse held in an oral record of pedigree. While it is widely held that the Yomud and the Goklan are the fastest due to their lighter builds, the Tekke horses have the best endurance, comparable only to the finest pure-bred Arabs. Junaid Khan has personally taken to investing into the horse breeding efforts of the Khanate, as the Turkmen breeds serve him in two ways: their clandestine sale to some interested European aristocrats helps to bring western capital into the city, while their ability as desert war-horses is unmatched. Of course, the Yomuds, raised alongside the young Junaid Khan in the Aral Sea grazing grounds, are favored by the Serdar-Karim, filling the stables of both the bazaars and the barracks."
 khikhan.1008.a: "Our soldiers will ride to victory!"
 khikhan.1008.b: "They are the backbone of our logistics!"

 khikhan.1009.t: "Dishonest Administrators"
 khikhan.1009.d: "Matters of boring administrative organisation have never been Junaid Khan's strong suit. What a good leader does to compensate for such a known weakness is to delegate and this is exactly what our humble leader has done. Unfortunately, the people who have handled administration in his stead have proven to be more competent than honest.\n\nThe government runs well enough, but tends to slowly shift its priorities towards matters which these irreplaceable officials find to be of importance, funneling state resources into the pockets of the unscrupulous. Without a head for accounts or interest in overseeing, Junaid has done little to uproot these administrators, and the guilty parties remain hidden among their cadres and entrenched in their offices."
 khikhan.1009.a: "Find them and purge them!"
 khikhan.1009.b: "They served us well so far..."

 khikhan.1010.t: "Refining Aziz Khan's Message"
 khikhan.1010.d: "Few envy the role of Aziz Khan within Junaid Khan's government, keeping the wheels of government turning while Junaid Khan roams the steppes. During the Civil War this even-keeled Kurbashi repeatedly butted heads with his Turkmen chief-in-chief, arguing over the orientation of the Khivan state, as well as Junaid Khan's repeated sheltering and support for Aziz Khan's closest rival Oraz Geldy. When Junaid Khan and Oraz Geldy began indiscriminately seizing food from the population they were supposedly protecting, Aziz Khan drew his weapons on Oraz Geldy and nearly broke with these two Turkmen Basmachi to join the Soviet cause, earning him the derisive moniker 'Turkmenian Makhno' from his Russian opponents, a moniker that Aziz Khan has since taken to heart.\n\nWith the end of the fighting in Khiva, Junaid Khan increasingly saw the value of his more administratively focused lieutenant - while Oraz Geldy continued to terrorise and harass loval populations and important interest groups, Aziz Khan worked to forge some semblance of rural Turkmen cultural and political unity, centred around Junaid Khan as a grand unifier and protector of the Turkmen people. Despite significant setbacks, including Junaid Khan's disinterest in engaging meaningfully with the non-Yomut tribes, the people of Khiva are receptive to a new state-built image of their leader. The only question remaining is what element of Junaid Khan's character will be the centrepiece of this new propaganda campaign?"
 khikhan.1010.a: "Junaid Khan is a hero, who slayed 100 godless heathens with his own hand!"
 khikhan.1010.b: "He is the father of all Turkmen, regardless of tribe or clan!"

 khikhan.1011.t: "The Final Blade in the Night"
 khikhan.1011.d: "Once Junaid Khan and his allies discovered the Khivan Khan's underhanded attempt to kill his most loyal and formidable commander, it was only a matter of time before he and his family of snakes would be permanently dealt with. For months, the royal family was closely watched, their contacts mapped and catalogued, and their movements tracked. Once the full scope of the conspiracy had been ascertained, Eshi Khan, Junaid Khan's son, and Aziz Khan worked tirelessly to organise a night of knives, one which would conclusively behead the treacherous Qungrat snake. On a moonless night, these men started their bloody business, going door to door, executing the enemies of the Serdar Karim and capturing those who he wished to speak further with. Early in the night they descended upon the grand palace, finding the Khan in the midst of his much diminished harem, ignobly striking him down as he fled the room, leaving his naked corpse in the hall before descending back upon the city to finish their cruel work. By the time that they were done, more than a hundred men had been killed, many of them the most powerful bureaucrats and administrators in the city. It matters not, a competent traitor is far more dangerous to the state than a loyal incompetent."
 khikhan.1011.a: "Death to all traitors!"

 khikhan.1012.t: "A New Khan in Khiva"
 khikhan.1012.d: "The coronation of Junaid Khan was an austere affair, reflective of the austere man who has ascended from his position of tribal prominence to declare himself the Khan of all Turkestan. For some, there had been questions surrounding the title which he would select for himself. The Qungrat dynasty he had deposed had derived their legitimacy from their history as the family of all great Mongol consorts (Genghis Khan's mother, great grandmother, and first wife were members of the Qungrat clan) and so clung to the title of Khan and the legacy of Mongolia tightly, while the Bukharan Manghud dynasty had abandoned ‘Khan' in favour of the Islamic title of Emir, in large part due to their very tenuous connections to the Genghis and his empire. Junaid Khan's own clan, the Yomuts, have little to no connection to Genghis Khan's empire, making his selection, that of Khan, interesting to say the least. If there were any in the crowd which had assembled in the grand halls of the palace of Khiva who objected to the use of the title, they did not dare to speak out. Instead, the mullahs, merchants, military men, and chiefs filed through the halls so that they may pay their respects to the new Khan and his son, swearing oaths of loyalty and bowing low to their new overlord. In the wings of the hall, ambassadors of foreign lands watched the procession and were in turn watched closely by suspicious Turkmen warriors. Unlike the Qungrats who came before them, this new Yomut Dynasty has no interest in being the lap dogs to foreign emperors!"
 khikhan.1012.a: "A new dynasty, a new chapter!"

 khikhan.1013.t: "The Issue of the Royal Guard"
 khikhan.1013.d: "When Junaid Khan crushed the royal dictatorship of Isfandiyar Khan, he killed the feckless khan in the gardens of his palace, replacing him with his brother Sayid Abdullah. During the restless days that followed, a number of the most corrupt and evil advisors of the late Khan were executed or exiled, but the vast majority of the royal family's Qungrat relatives were spared, retaining their positions of power and prominence, though some key positions were instead given to Turkmen chiefs and there was little doubt that Junaid Khan now ran the Khanate. Notably, the Royal Guard, a central institution of the Khan's personal power and a point of pride for the Qungrats, was disbanded, replaced by Turkemen guards handpicked by the new Serdar Karim. These new guards served more as gaolers, rather than protectors, of the new Khan, restricting his movements and watching him closely.\n\nToday, a number of leading Khivan Uzbek nobles have come to us asking for permission to arm and outfit a new body of soldiers to serve the Khanate as a revival of the old Khivan Royal Guard. These men would be under the direct command of Junaid Khan, but would be allowed to select junior officers from among their ranks. Most importantly, they would be drawn up from the Uzbeks of the Amu Darya rather than the Turkmen who make up most of the Khan's current army. These men can never be fully trusted, but we would feel quite silly if we find our walls undermanned just because of our fear and paranoia of these old and impotent nobles and their lackeys."

 khikhan.1014.t: "Arming the Rabble"
 khikhan.1014.d: "Unfortunately, taking stock of our young local industry is not quite as simple as tallying up the three government owned cotton gins and workshops, and then adding those workshops and crude manufacturers we intend to imminently ‘loan' from Russian owners. The issue is the workers, prominently Uzbek labourers from the cities of Khiva, who keep these small shops running. In 1917, these men were led by foreign taught devils to subdue the Khan and demand petty privileges - going as far as to claim that the people of Khiva ruled the Khan, rather than the other way around. Of course, we taught them an accompanying lesson in 1918 - that one should pray often if they intend to face Junaid Khan in battle. What these rabble rousers lack in sense, however, they make up in bravery. Some of the bravest among their number have taken the potentially fatal step of approaching Junaid Khan to request one thing: that the workers be allowed to gather a stockpile of arms, so that they may serve as a proper garrison in the event of an emergency in the capital. This is a preposterous request, and even they know it - but they are also keenly aware of the impending conflict in Central Asia, and moreso that Junaid Khan lacks the men and weapons required to hold Khiva. Then again, if Junaid Khan had to pick between surrendering his capital to the Russians or to the Socialists, he would have to give the proposition some serious thought. These workers have promised to give half of the arms they intend to purchase to Junaid Khan himself, and further that they would subordinate themselves to any commanders or officers he wishes to pick, but Junaid Khan knows better than that - he will be lucky to get a few paltry rifles, and any man he places at the head of a workers' militia is liable to be cut down once the city is abandoned."
 khikhan.1014.a: "Loath them or not, we need them to man the walls!"
 khikhan.1014.b: "Did we learn nothing from 1918? Behead these agitators as a warning to the rest!"

 KHI_bandit_kingdom: "Bandit Kingdom"
 KHI_bandit_kingdom_desc: "Those who would disparage the Junaid Khan point to his illiteracy and ignoble origins, claiming that he is little more than an up-jumped bandit leading a kingdom of brigands. It does not help that the army he leads is a mismatched collection of peasant militias, palace guardsmen, and tribal horsemen, each with divided political loyalties and negligible discipline. Junaid Khan has proved the effectiveness of this rag-tag army on the field, though perhaps this is more a reflection of his own personal ability. There is only one thing which is certain in Khiva, however, and that is the primacy of the military, and the iron will of the true Khan they follow."
 KHI_sons_of_oghuz: "The Many Sons of Oghuz"
 KHI_sons_of_oghuz_desc: "The different Turkmen tribes, from the Khorezm Oasis to the Caspian and Aral Seas, have never before considered themselves a singular people. Even now, the unity of the Khivan Turkmen is one of united purpose, not of common culture, language, or geographical location. Junaid Khan became a hero among them when he unified the many disparate tribes and led his brave warriors to victory against the Bolsheviks. That grand victory was enough to begin building a unified Turkmen identity, but most of our Turkmen citizens still identify primarily with their tribal groups, despite Junaid's attempts to cultivate a united Turkmen identity."

Junaid Khan became a hero among them when he unified the many disparate tribes and led his brave warriors to victory against the Bolsheviks. That grand victory has been used as the foundation to create a unified Turkmen identity, and while many of our Turkmen subjects still identify primarily with their tribal groups, Junaid Khan is largely seen as the father of all Turkmen, serving as a unifying figure for this newly coalescing ethnic identity."

Though the wars and banditry of the last decades left the fertile fields scorched and looted, it was not long before our resilient subjects returned them to their former glory. We produce a startling amount of food, feeding our citizens and filling our coffers from exporting it, though this growing dependence on trade leaves us increasingly vulnerable to international instability."
