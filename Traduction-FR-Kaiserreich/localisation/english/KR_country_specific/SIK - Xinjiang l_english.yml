 SIK_opium_searching_desc: "The army of Xinjiang, especially in the south has a hard addiction for opium, and needs it to function.

 SIK_opium_solution: "Gansu Suppliers"
 SIK_opium_solution_desc: "The army of Xinjiang, especially in the south has a hard addiction for opium, and needs it to function.

 SIK_over_edge_desc: "Yang Zengxin's careful policy of pushing the Uyghur population has been completely thrown out the window by Jin Shuren. He has proceeded to double the tax of Uyghur land owners, deeply upsetting the population with the opinion of Jin Shuren on a far decline."

Sheng Shicai has been using this as his chance to build up strength in Aksu while others are beginning to consider defecting to the Kumuliks. If we do not keep the threat contained, Jin's status as governor could be shorter lived then expected."

 SIK_jahriyya2: "Exciting the Jahriyya"
 SIK_jahriyya2_desc: "It appears that the Jahriyya have been able to rebuild their network in Xinjiang, and have caught the attention of the Ma Clique.

 SIK_menhuan_education: "Menhuan Education"

 SIK_killing_mongol_decision_category: "Mongol Banditry"
 SIK_killing_mongol_decision_category_desc: "With the Mongolian regime to the north having problems with bandits inside of Western Mongolia, the problem has begun to spread to our Mongolian populated areas of Xinjiang as well. While the region is not key to the overall administration of Xinjiang, letting the chaos reign for too long could leave it open to hostile advances."

 SIK_mobilize_shuren_division: "Supply Jin Shuren's Regiment"
 SIK_mobilize_shuren_division_desc: "The regiment Jin Shuren was preparing before the governorship crisis is readily open for us to crush the Mongolian bandits in the north, besides some minor needs for more men and guns."

 SIK_setup_policing_dzungaria_desc: "While taking out camps will slow down the frequency of raids in the region, there will always be outlier bandits roaming the countryside and causing trouble. Setting up some minor policing in more remote regions should help put a stop to this problem."

 SIK_remove_mongol_mission: "Ending Northern Banditry"
 SIK_remove_mongol_mission_desc: "As the Mongolian problem begins to escalate, so does our need to finally make a move. If we leave the problem alone, we could see the region fall completely outside of our control."

 SIK_xinjiang_war_category: "The Xinjiang War"
 SIK_xinjiang_war_category_desc: "Xinjiang due to Jin's policies has entered a state of crisis, with the Uyghur rebels to the south and the Kumulik traitors to the east. While a unified force for now, Sheng Shicai, Ma Shaowu, and Jin Shuren are all making their own moves to deal with the problem that fuel their own interests. Without careful manoeuvring the Xinjiang governorate could fall even quicker then imagined."

 SIK_defend_dihua_mission: "Defend Dihua"
 SIK_defend_dihua_mission_desc: "Dihua is the capital of northern Xinjiang and the base of Jin Shuren's operations. Should it fall, the only place left to retreat would be the minor city of Aksu under Sheng Shicai's control, and whether Sheng would even comply with Jin retreating there is completely unknown. We must take all measures to prevent this from even happening in the first place, lest we wish for our inevitable fall."

 SIK_unify_xinjiang: "Unify Xinjiang"
 SIK_unify_xinjiang_desc: "Xinjiang is split, and all it leads back to Jin Shuren and his policies that lead to this awful situation. If he wishes to redeem himself, he'll need to be quick in ending this conflict before it gets further out of control. After all, certain political elements might not be able to stand his reign for much longer after this blunder..."

 SIK_mobilize_aksu_forces: "Mobilise Sheng's Aksu Brigade"
 SIK_mobilize_aksu_forces_desc: "While we previously took Jin Shuxin's advice of refusing Sheng's Aksu Brigade, desperate times call for desperate measures, and we need all the help we can get. After all, Sheng is a trustable individual as seen previously, surely this will only benefit us into the future."

 SIK_white_russian_recruitment: "White Russian Recruitment"
 SIK_white_russian_recruitment_desc: "Within northern Xinjiang lies a small amount of White Russian troops from the civil war, lying in wait for the day they can fight once again. We shall provide them with this opportunity by mobilising them to fight the eastern threat, for the sake of a stable governorship."

 SIK_fortify_dihua: "Fortify Dihua"
 SIK_fortify_dihua_desc: "Besides Aksu, Dihua is the last holdout against these pathetic warlords. Should it fall, the remains of our regime will be forced to bundle in Aksu in the hopes of survival, and the chance of that going well is less than likely..."

 SIK_secure_turfan: "Secure Turfan"
 SIK_secure_turfan_desc: "Turfan currently under the garrison of Ma Fuming has yet to mobilise like the rest of our loyal subjects, leaving many to believe he is considering defection to the Kumuliks.

 SIK_check_beiyuan: "Check on Zhang Beiyuan"
 SIK_check_beiyuan_desc: "Commander Zhang Beiyuan, despite being a close friend of Jin Shuren, has yet to mobilise his forces. Whether or not this means defection is imminent is unknown, but surely it couldn't hurt to give him a... reminder of his duties in this administration."

### Intro Screen ###
 SIK_country_intro_header: "Introduction to the §PXinjiang Clique§!"
 SIK_country_intro_content: "The §PXinjiang§! province of §lChina§! has had a disruptive history like much of the northwest, as the region has been constantly plagued with whispers of unrest to this day. The §lXinhai Revolution§! spawned yet more of the already used to chaos caused by the local §nUyghur population§!, being more Central Asian then Chinese. The present governor §PYuan Du-Hua§! failed to keep the situation under control, fleeing the province and leaving it in the hands of his trusted advisor §PYang Zengxin§!.\n\n§PYang§! through shrewd dealings and violent repression has kept §PXinjiang§! 'stable' for his 20 years of governorship. §PYang§! himself is a very paranoid man, taking all possible precautions to prevent uprisings while still repressing the §nUyghurs§! located within §PXinjiang§! to no end. By '36, he is a secluded soul staying within his house and rarely coming outside due to fear of political assassination by one of his few retainers left. Most duties are handled between his three most powerful advisors §PJin Shuren§!, the §PDao-yin of Hotan Ma Shaowu§!, and the §PDao-yin of Aksu§! and foreign minister §SFan Yaonan§!. Together these three handle most of the everyday administration of §PXinjiang§! while taking orders from §PYang§! himself on occasions. For now, the status quo within §PXinjiang§! is kept but with §PYang's§! seclusion getting worse and worse, anything could happen."

 SIK_country_intro_header_1: "§PXinjiang§! and the §PKumul Khanate§!"
 SIK_country_intro_content_1: "The §PKumul Khanate§! is officially a protectorate of the §cQing§! within §PXinjiang§!, and is a largely stabilising factor for §PXinjiang§! itself. Currently ruled by §PNasīr Shah§!, the §Pkhanate§! does very little in the day to day rule of §PXinjiang§!, besides having to pay tribute to the §PXinjiang§! governorship yearly. Why does it matter? Many see the §PKumul Khanate's§! current autonomy as the only thing keeping tensions within §PXinjiang§! from exploding, as it shows a degree of §nUyghur§! rule within the province even if people don't like the current ruler §PNasīr§!. Its existence is key to our peace in the northwest, and only an absolute fool would even dare to try and mess with its presence."

 SIK_country_intro_header_2: "The §lPeople§! of §PXinjiang§!"
 SIK_country_intro_content_2: "The people of §PXinjiang§! are by far the most unique in §lChina§!, as many would argue that the majority are hardly §lChinese§! at all. One of the largest ethnic groups is the §nUyghur§! population, which is by far the most nationalist and well known ethnic group within §PXinjiang§!. Two other notable groups are first the §cKazakh§! population in the north with a population of about 400,000 and the §PTungans§! in the south, the §PXinjiang§! version of the §lChinese Hui§! with a population around 450,000. The §PTungans§! and §nUyghurs§! are known for shaky relations, as the minority §PTungans§! have long held control over the majority of §PXinjiang§!, as seen now by the §PDao-yin of Hotan§! being §PMa Shaowu§!. Due to their overall separation from the §lChinese§! people, the §nUyghur§! and §cKazakh§! population have long spelt the most trouble for our administration, rising up numerous times in the past in order to establish their independence from the rest of §lChina§!."

### Events ###
 xin.3.t: "Troubles in the North"
 xin.3.desc: "Dzungaria, mostly occupied by both Kazakhs and Mongols has been a trouble spot for Yang's administration since its emergence, serving as a hot spot of mainly Mongolian bandits to launch raids against our people. Despite being silent for the past year, troubles within Western Mongolia under Ungern's regime has spread to Xinjiang, as these bandits have reemerged once again. We'll need to wait for Yang's response on the issue to deal with the problem, but until then they will be troublesome."
 xin.3.a: "These problems never end, do they?"

 xin.4.t: "Yang's Silence"
 xin.4.desc: "In a surprise to everyone but his closest advisors, Yang's response to this appearance has been limited at best. His paranoia of assassination has made him just stay inside his home, telling his officials "Bah, these Mongols were hardly trouble before, I doubt they'll be of much trouble now! The problem will take care of itself!" Despite this response, Jin Shuren, Yang Zengxin's top advisor, has begun to mobilise a force to the north in order to deal with the disturbance."
 xin.4.a: "This is ludicrous..."

 xin.5.t: "Collapse of the League"
 xin.5.desc: "The news of the collapse of the Zhili hegemony in the south, the League of Eight Provinces, have just reached our ears. Despite the shock, Xinjiang's relative isolation from the rest of China has left the ripples reaching us being limited. Yang Zengxin's paranoia could be cause for concern however, he very likely feels his current position within the governorship is in danger."
 xin.5.a: "Keep an eye on the situation."

 xin.6.t: "Silence"
 xin.6.desc: "Silence is all that has been heard for almost a month now. People only come to Yang's chamber when they have something to report, and this past month has been uneventful besides Jin Shuren's army being almost ready to crush the northern bandits. Even then, many are suspicious on the lack of response from Yang at all and no orders seemingly being sent at all. Jin Shuren has decided to temporarily pause the raising of his army in order to investigate the situation before he heads out on a month long expedition to make sure his superior is alright."
 xin.6.a: "Surely our fears are unfounded."

 xin.7.t: "Disappearance"
 xin.7.desc: "In a shock to many, Yang is simply gone. The entire premises has been searched high and low for any sign of Yang being here for the past couple of days, but there's none. In fact, most of his possessions he has collected over the years seem to be missing as well. Jin is continuing to search the area for any signs of where Yang could have gone, but the chances of Yang even being in Dihua at this point is unlikely, leaving Jin and other retainers in a worrisome position. It could take months to receive a message from the Qing on who the new governor is, leaving the most important spot in Xinjiang completely vacant in the mean time."
 xin.7.a: "Collaboration is key to remain order."

 xin.8.t: "Robbery"
 xin.8.desc: "As the home of Yang Zengxin continues to be searched, Jin himself has checked on the treasury of Xinjiang, supposedly filled with a fortune of taxes gained from the populace of Xinjiang. As Jin and his guards arrived, they opened the door...\n\nAnd all the money was gone.\n\nAn absolute fortune amassed over the period of twenty years has disappeared along with Yang Zengxin, leaving many theories as to exactly what has happened here. The most believed so far is Yang Zengxin simply... left. Yang has left with all of our money, possessions, and with his title of governor still intact."
 xin.8.a: "..."

 xin.9.t: "Coup"
 xin.9.desc: "As the situation began to hit Jin Shuren during the investigation, he's realised the position he is in. There will be no new governor for months at least along with no Yang Zengxin, and he is the most prominent government official left within Dihua currently. He needed to make his move before anyone else arrived, using his recently made army that was supposed to crush the Mongol bandits.\n\nAnd as expected, he did. Jin Shuren with his 3,000 troops have stormed the capital and secured it completely, declaring himself governor of Xinjiang before a proper response from the Qing could even be formulated. Not all are pleased by these events, especially the Dao-yin of Aksu, Fan Yaonan, leading many to believe that crisis could be on its way to Xinjiang for the first time in 20 long years. Not only that, but it's not even known what the Qing will think about this turn of events, leaving Jin with absolute power over the entirety of Xinjiang until news is heard."
 xin.9.a: "We have to believe in Jin."

 xin.10.t: "An Invitation"
 xin.10.desc: "With the everyday proceedings of Xinjiang continuing as normal, Jin Shuren has finally left for his expedition to crush the recently emerged Mongol bandits. All is well within Xinjiang, while the rest of China has erupted into chaos as a result of the League of Eight Provinces' collapse. In almost a celebration of the circumstances, the Dao-yin of Aksu and foreign minister of Xinjiang, Fan Yaonan, has announced a party, inviting many government officials, including Yang Zengxin. Yang's isolation has led most to expect him to decline this, but perhaps Yang could make use of a day of luxury with the recent stresses of governing?"
 xin.10.a: "It's time to party!"
 xin.10.b: "I've never trusted Fan before and certainly will not now."

 xin.11.t: "The Party"
 xin.11.desc: "The night was lively as Yang Zengxin entered Aksu today, seeing mass amounts of food and drink for the night, ready to spend this night to the fullest as if it will be his last. He sits down an hour later, ready to finally begin. He digs into his food as Fan Yaonan and a multitude of other governmental officials join him in the luxuries of life. Fan excuses himself from the table with Yang barely noticing, still indulging his gluttony. Fan Yaonan returned ten minutes later, with two guards with guns and red arm bands in tow behind him as he sits down again.\n\n\"A toast, to Yang's continued health!\"\n\nYang raised his glass as well, a smile on his face until he realised what was happening. The guards now pointed their guns as Yang, and shots immediately rang out in the banquet, and soon there was a dead, soiled, and decrepit Yang Zengxin lying on the ground with bullet holes in his head and chest."
 xin.11.a: "To Fan Yaonan, our new leader!"

 xin.12.t: "Jin Shuren's March"
 xin.12.desc: "Jin Shuren wasted no time in heading back to Aksu after hearing of his former superior's death, with his recently raised force in tow. Fan Yaonan is seemingly completely unprepared for this, with his efforts to raise his own force to defend Aksu completely failing as the city descends into anarchy. He, his officials, and his small force of 200 hole up in Aksu, waiting for when Jin Shuren's horde arrives."
 xin.12.a: "His prospects look dim."

 xin.13.t: "The Second Takeover"
 xin.13.desc: "Jin secured Dihua and quickly moved onto Aksu, where Fan Yaonan waited, desperately trying to set up as many defences as he could before Jin would arrive. It was pointless, as when Jin arrived, soon after his securing of Dihua, his massive army rushed into the city and secured it all, eventually breaking through into Fan's residence, with Fan nowhere to be found. Before the Qing even knew their loyal governor Yang was gone, two coups have taken place in Xinjiang. Now Jin Shuren has installed himself as governor, and there is little Beijing can do about it."
 xin.13.a: "I'll pass on the banquet this time."

 xin.14.t: "Yang Zengxin's Death"
 xin.14.desc: "As Yang Zengxin's various officials went to visit him today before the expedition to crush the Mongol threat to the north, they were shocked at what they found. Yang Zengxin seemed to have died in his sleep at an unknown time, leaving open many questions as to what is going to happen next. Many predict Jin Shuren's ascendancy to the governor position by force before the Qing can react to the situation using his new army, but as of yet nothing has occurred. All that can be done is wait and see how the situation unfolds."
 xin.14.a: "How could this have happened to us?"

 xin.15.t: "Jin Shuren Secures Dihua"
 xin.15.desc: "As many predicted, Jin Shuren has decided to make his move on Dihua and secure it using his newly armed force. The streets are filled with soldiers as any possible political dissidents are being removed one by one. Among these is the Dao-yin of Aksu, Fan Yaonan who has a somewhat petty rivalry with Jin. Little is known about what Jin's next moves will be, but many predict that Fan Yaonan's position of power will not be lasting for much longer."
 xin.15.a: "We lie in his hands..."

 xin.16.t: "Jin's March on Aksu"
 xin.16.desc: "As many predicted, Jin quickly moved from Dihua to remove Fan Yaonan's position in power before he could even act. Many noticed what looks like the beginning of a build-up of defences, but Fan's accomplices were killed before any meaningful resistance could be put up, though Fan himself could not be found. Some believe him to have escaped into the mountains to avoid capture. Ma Shaowu, the Dao-yin of Hotan has declared his loyalty to the new governor Jin Shuren, aiming to secure his rule in the south. Jin Shuren has agreed to this, finally achieving his rule over all of Xinjiang, at least for now."
 xin.16.a: "Now these are the radical changes Xinjiang needs!"

 xin.17.t: "Jin's Consolidation of Power"
 xin.17.desc: "With Ma Shaowu's southern government declaring loyalty to the new governor Jin Shuren, Jin has managed to secure all aspects of power. Fan Yaonan is missing, and with the cabinet slowly being replaced one by one, Jin is surely the ruler who has proven himself to be on top during this time of stress. No one knows what he has planned but based off his close proximity with Yang Zengxin, it most likely will be similar in policy. One piece still missing to the puzzle is the empty seat of the Dao-yin of Aksu, but surely someone will be appointed soon."
 xin.17.a: "To a new future."

 xin.19.t: "Doubling the Uyghur Tax"
 xin.19.desc: "With Jin as de facto governor, he's immediately putting in new policies regarding the Muslim population in Xinjiang. With these, the tax on Uyghurs, Kazakhs, and other Central Asian peoples is being doubled immediately. This is seen as completely ignoring Yang Zengxin's policy of treading carefully with the populace to avoid revolt, resulting in many seeing this as an overall risky move. But as long as the money keeps coming to us, what's the possible harm?"
 xin.19.a: "Give us the money!"

 xin.20.t: "Sheng Shicai, the New Dao-Yin of Aksu"
 xin.20.desc: "With Fan Yaonan's overthrow, the position of Dao-yin of Aksu has been empty. Out of the multitude of candidates including Jin Shuren's personal acquaintances, Sheng Shicai, the current Chief of Staff has ultimately been chosen for the position. Currently wielding a moderately sized army and having an even more competent chain of connections within the government, Jin was what many considered backed into a corner to this pick, but Sheng has promised that he will hold the utmost respect for the position and the weight it has."
 xin.20.a: "Truly a capable individual."

 xin.21.t: "Meeting with Nasīr"
 xin.21.desc: "With the majority of government positions filled and Jin ready to embark on what he sees as the 'unification of Xinjiang', he has sent a messenger to Nasīr of the Kumul Khanate for a meeting to associate themselves in Dihua. Hopefully this will make the Kumul people feel assured of their position in the new Xinjiang, bringing new stability to this previously unruly province."
 xin.21.a: "This will be a pleasant affair."

 xin.22.t: "Meeting with Jin"
 xin.22.desc: "Jin Shuren, the new governor of Xinjiang, has invited Nasīr himself to a meeting in Dihua in order to establish relations with our great khanate. He sees us as necessary to preserving and "wishes to see closer cooperation between the two governments into the future." Obviously saying no isn't much of a choice, our fate lies in their hands, so we'll be forced to hand Nasīr over whether we like it or not. Hopefully he speaks the truth, and this can ensure our rule into the future..."
 xin.22.a: "Associating ourselves is always good, right?"

 xin.23.t: "The Annexation of Kumul"
 xin.23.desc: "Nasīr walked into Dihua, greeted with a lavish ceremony along with many festivities to celebrate his arrival. Following a personal greeting from Jin Shuren and multiple cabinet members, Nasīr walked further into the city in a tour. Greeted by many, Nasīr felt welcome and realised just how important of a figure he seems to be. However, his pride and satisfaction didn't last for long.\n\nNasīr was soon invited to Jin's personal residence, where they went into the dining room and began to feast. As they became overcome with gluttony, the unexpected happened. Nasīr has two guns aimed at the back of his head. "Nasīr, your time is up. Come with us." Having no choice but to comply, Nasīr was taken to a prison deep within Dihua, probably to be held there for the rest of his life.\n\nJin wasted no time in declaring the annexation of Kumul and the arrest of numerous officials, declaring the region 'Hami', the well-known Chinese name. Hami, now fully incorporated into the Xinjiang administration, has finally united Xinjiang once and for all."
 xin.23.a: "Hami, welcome to Xinjiang."

 xin.24.t: "The Plot Against Nasīr"
 xin.24.desc: "Nasīr walked into Dihua, greeted with a lavish ceremony along with many festivities to celebrate his arrival. Following a personal greeting from Jin Shuren and multiple cabinet members, Nasīr walked further into the city in a tour. Greeted by many, Nasīr felt welcome and realised just how important of a figure he seems to be. However, his pride and satisfaction didn't last for long.\n\nNasīr was soon invited to Jin's personal residence, where they went into the dining room and began to feast.

Come with us.\" Having no choice but to comply, Nasīr was taken to a prison deep within Dihua, probably to be held there for the rest of his life.\n\nJin wasted no time in declaring the annexation of Kumul and the arrest of numerous officials, declaring the region 'Hami', the well-known Chinese name. Hami, now fully incorporated into the Xinjiang administration, has finally united Xinjiang once and for all."
 xin.24.a: "Welcome to the new regime!"

 xin.25.t: "The New Cabinet of Hami"
 xin.25.desc: "The new cabinet of Hami mainly consists of members apart of Jin's close clique of individuals. Among these include Li Xizeng, one of the main individuals convincing Jin to annex Kumul, Zhang Guohu, the new Tax Collector and Chief of Staff of Hami, and finally Long Xielin who has been put in charge of the prefecture itself. All considered highly trustable according to Jin, he trusts them to lead the incorporation of these stray people accordingly. Former Kumul ministers Yulbars Khan and Hoja Niyaz have also been allowed in the government, although in rather lower level positions alongside being watched closely by other officials."
 xin.25.a: "All competent individuals, this should go well."

 xin.26.t: "The Southern Government"
 xin.26.desc: "Ma Shaowu's reaction to the annexation of Kumul has been less than positive to put it lightly, although for reasons other than political. Kumul, the peacekeeper of Xinjiang, did have a notable effect in suppressing northern Uyghur nationalism but the south is what truly benefited from this arrangement. The more conservative southern people have long been the hotbed for unorganised uprisings and rebellions which Shaowu has done well to contain so far through the use of police and overall suppression of information. However, such a major move as this might be too much to contain, despite Shaowu's assurance otherwise."
 xin.26.a: "Let's hope things stay okay down there."

 xin.27.t: "Sheng's Establishment"
 xin.27.desc: "With Sheng now occupying the position of Dao-yin of Aksu, he has begun to establish his own government within the area similar to Ma Shaowu's deeper within the south of Xinjiang. Already filling the cabinet with his own clique of trusted individuals, he plans on rooting out the unrest plaguing the region before an organised uprising can occur, already beginning to form his own division to quell the sparks of conflict. While this could mean the further division of the deeply divided Xinjiang, it is preferable to the bastard Fan Yaonan or the possibility of falling to the Turks. Of course, a wary eye must still be kept to ensure Sheng does not get ideas above his station."
 xin.27.a: "The position is in good hands."

 xin.28.t: "The Aksu Army"
 xin.28.desc: "Sheng's army has been complete, ready to be mobilised under the central government. While Sheng will be controlling the army directly, he promises that supervision will be under Jin Shuren at all times. His loyalty has been true so far, perhaps suspiciously so, but as long as he continues his declaration of loyalty, no problems should stand. However, problems aren't completely absent. Jin Shuren's brother and Provincial Commissioner for Military Affairs Jin Shuxin has protested Sheng's growing influence within the government, stating that Sheng is not what he seems and needs to be removed from power at once. Of course we can't just remove such a skilled official, but maybe we can keep a closer eye on him?"
 xin.28.a: "Sheng can be trusted, ignore him."
 xin.28.b: "Maybe closer watch can be employed."

 xin.29.t: "The Annexation Reaches the South"
 xin.29.desc: "As we suspected, the news of Kumul's annexation has begun to spread throughout the major cities of Hotan and Kashgar, with their audiences baffled that such a move was even considered by Jin Shuren in the first place. Shaowu has begun to move his troops to these areas in order to restore peace, this is certain to have a lasting effect on our population's will to cooperate with the government in the future."
 xin.29.a: "Hopefully this doesn't cause too many problems."

 xin.30.t: "Uyghurs See Opportunity"
 xin.30.desc: "As if things couldn't get worse for our weakened government, the news of the Kumul Uprising has reached the south as well and the result is as expected. Unrest and riots have begun to skyrocket even stronger then the initial annexation's result, with certain individuals managing to make themselves known. Particularly in Aksu, actions have only increased in violence as the wealthy Bughra Brothers have joined the riots, funding their efforts. While contained to Kashgar and Hotan for now, it isn't expected to remain there for long, as many see it reaching other major cities as well. We can only hope that this isn't the case and Shaowu can handle himself."
 xin.30.a: "We should stay wary."

 xin.31.t: "Our Ally Ma Shaowu Marches North"
 xin.31.desc: "Shaowu is marching north! Unexpectedly prompt from the southern government, Ma Shaowu has begun to march north to assist in the suppression of the Kumul Uprising, citing it as "the source of all his problems". Leaving only minor garrisons in Kashgar and Hotan while distributing troops to other minor towns, he's taken the majority of his forces on a march to Aksu to assist in our efforts against Kumul. Whether he was right to make this decisions can't be known, but with the unrest only growing in the south, many are citing him as an absolute fool for compromising our situation even more."
 xin.31.a: "A complete idiot, that one."

 xin.32.t: "Miner Uprising in Keriya"
 xin.32.desc: "As expected, the worst has begun. The south has begun to explode, with the uprising being in neither Kashgar nor Hotan but in the minor mining town of Keriya. Miners fed up with the lack of pay and ludicrous taxation have overthrown the administrators of the region, with many citing the wealthy Bughra Family being the ones funding their efforts. Now with a small amount of rifles, they have begun to march to Aksu in the name of Uyghur independence."
 xin.32.a: "Damned Bughras..."

 xin.33.t: "The Hotan Amirs"
 xin.33.desc: "With the uprising in Keriya in full swing, the tensions have finally risen within Hotan as the Bughra Family have declared their own Hotan Emirate, declaring independence from the Chinese government, aiming to take all of Xinjiang. With Muhammad Amin Bughra, Abdullah Bughra, and Nur Ahmad Jan Bughra all becoming officially "Amirs of Hotan", they have fully taken the city while also meeting up with the Keriya rebels. This threat while still minor cannot be underestimated, as this move serves as a call to all Uyghurs to reclaim their own rule against our rightful government."
 xin.33.a: "We can handle this, I swear."

 xin.34.t: "The Southern Revolt"
 xin.34.SIK.desc: "As Shaowu continues to march to Aksu, Kashgar was left completely exposed to the possibility of overthrow, and that's exactly what happened. Former landowner in Aksu Timur Beg marched to Aksu, using his wealth to fund the rebels further. Slowly gaining the advantage against the small garrison, more and more continued to rise up against Shaowu's rule, having the Inner Kashgar City completely surrounded on all sides as the garrison desperately fights on in the hope of survival. With the most major locations in the south being captured by the dirty traitors, it can no longer be considered to be under our control, at least for the time being. The other garrisons have begun to completely panic and deploy themselves in the hopes of fighting to survive, but their chances are unlikely.\n\n§RThe Uyghur Rebellion has begun.§!"
 xin.34.KUM.desc: "Our rapid victory over the Han Governorate has created a major power vacuum, destabilising the entire region. As the shock-waves of Dihua's defeat reverberate through the south, former Aksu landowner Timur Beg marched on the city, using his wealth to amass a large rebel army to claim his own stake on the province. The demoralised garrison in the city put up little resistance as more and more continued to rise up against both our and the former regime's rule. Inner Kashgar city was completely surrounded on all sides and fell to a rapid assault as it becomes clear that no one is able to stop them. It seems we are not alone in wanting control over Xinjiang.\n\n§RThe Uyghur Rebellion has begun.§!"
 xin.34.a: "This can't be!"
 xin.34.b: "For independence!"

 xin.35.t: "Turfan Garrison Silence"
 xin.35.desc: "Ma Fuming, who has led the garrison in Turfan for years now has refused to move his garrison due to "a lack of confidence in the governorship of Jin Shuren". While this insult to our name is already worthy of death, we need as much assistance as we can get so we need to tread carefully. The last thing we need is him defecting to the Kumuliks who already outnumber us alongside the Uyghurs to the south. During these times of pressure is when unity is needed, and it seems not all the fools within government are willing to realise that."
 xin.35.a: "If he betrays us..."

 xin.36.t: "Ma Fuming Deserts our Ranks"
 xin.36.desc: "Ma Fuming, due to our lack of action towards his declaration of neutrality, has officially betrayed us in favour of the Kumuliks. His garrison has been deployed and is currently skirmishing with our other forces. Already outnumbered, this is only more of a dash to Jin's reputation as we continue to be on the back foot of this conflict and more desert us. We'll need to be more careful in the future."
 xin.36.a: "This could lead to further problems..."

 xin.37.t: "Xinjiang Deserters Arrive"
 xin.37.desc: "The Turfan garrison under Ma Fuming has defected to our ranks, mobilising for the sake of a more equal Xinjiang. Rumours of discontent are stemming from the Xinjiang administration, something we can probably be gaining more from in the future if things continue to head in this direction. Nonetheless, more manpower for our noble cause is always a welcome change as we continue on our Jihad against the Han dictators."
 xin.37.a: "This works for us."

 xin.38.t: "Ma Fuming's Turfan Garrison Negotiations"
 xin.38.desc: "We've made contact with the Turfan garrison under Ma Fuming in the hopes of convincing him against his defection to the Kumuliks. Unluckily for us however, he's been very resistant to any and all attempts of concessions and doesn't seem to want to budge on the issue of mobilising his army. Jin has declared the negotiations fruitless, and suggests sending troops to take him out and put someone else in charge of the army. While a radical proposal that could have some success, many others within the government think that continuing on with the negotiations will show our patience to this more than frustrated man and convince him to change his mind. Either choice is really valid, and could very easily shape the rest of the war."
 xin.38.a: "Kill him now. Do it."
 xin.38.b: "Patience is a virtue."

 xin.39.t: "Turfan Garrison Deployed"
 xin.39.desc: "It seems Jin's idea was the good choice after all. Sending a small regiment to kill Fuming in his sleep, proper leadership has been re-established over the garrison despite some initial chaos. The new command has deployed the garrison and is ready to be commanded. Many are impressed by Jin's handling of the situation here, allowing us to keep possible rebellion within our ranks silent for now."
 xin.39.a: "Jin truly is the greatest."

 xin.40.t: "Turfan Garrison Deployed?"
 xin.40.desc: "After many more hours of what many would consider infuriating negotiations with the insufferable Ma Fuming, Jin finally reached a boiling point, completely cutting off all messages to the garrison. The latest news we've heard is of the garrison being deployed, but considering the lack of message towards us about mobilisation, we are better off believing that it is not deployed in our favour. Many are calling Jin Shuren a fool for such blunder, as the Kumuliks only grow stronger from our own incompetence."
 xin.40.a: "Xinjiang is plagued with barbarians."

 xin.41.t: "Mobilisation of the Turfan Garrison"
 xin.41.desc: "Ma Fuming, the warlord controlling over Turfan, had previously refused to mobilise his forces due to fear of being overrun by our uprising. While many within our ranks predicted he would soon be defecting to our side and ignored him, Jin shockingly killed Fuming in his sleep in order to end the bickering once and for all. The garrison has now mobilised in the name of the Xinjiang governorship, leaving them stronger and more unified then ever. Of course with Zhongying and the mighty Yulbars on our side, they still shouldn't stand a chance against us."
 xin.41.a: "Victory will come anyhow."

 xin.42.t: "Zhang Beiyuan In Doubt"
 xin.42.desc: "Like many other of our various garrisons, Zhang Beiyuan has refused to move his regiment of troops despite multiple reminders to do so. Zhang is a close friend of Jin so this comes as a surprise even to him, assuming he at least had his loyalty of all people. Currently sitting in between Dihua and Aksu, many are worried about the possibility of him remaining this way throughout the entire war or even betraying our rightful cause in favour of the Kumuliks. Perhaps checking up on the man wouldn't be a bad move if we wish to convince him that our side is just?"
 xin.42.a: "He can't keep getting away with it!"

 xin.43.t: "Commander Zhang Beiyuan Defects"
 xin.43.desc: "Zhang Beiyuan was left to his own devices for too long, running away with his army overnight heading towards the Kumulik camp. Such a close friend of Jin simply leaving without a word only further stains Jin's already terrible reputation during this time of trouble, with rumours coming through of officials defecting to Sheng's "camp" within our governorship. Of course, even Sheng realises that great unity is requires in times of great struggle for our noble cause, and nothing is to come of it."
 xin.43.a: "Hardly a friend, that one."

 xin.44.t: "Xinjiang Deserters Arrive"
 xin.44.desc: "Adding to the list of people who hate Jin Shuren with a healthy passion is Zhang Beiyuan, former close friend of Jin who has come to see his incompetency lead to his downfall alongside us. He brings with him supplies and manpower to help us continue our effort to bring Xinjiang a better administration then what it has currently. Together, we can end Jin's imperialism against all within Xinjiang once and for all."
 xin.44.a: "Victory comes soon."

 xin.45.t: "A Letter to Zhang Beiyuan"
 xin.45.desc: " "Zhang Beiyuan, my friend for years who has come to see me arrive in this province and ascend in the administration, who has been at my side during all of this. We find ourselves in a time where unity amongst our administration is needed more than ever, and surely you realise that as well. It comes as my own personal recommendation that you too help me and all of your fellow administrators in our collective victory, unless of course you want to be stomped under the boot of the Butcher of Gansu Ma Zhongying, or perhaps the Uyghur in the south who will kill you if you don't convert to their heresy? I beg that you consider other possibilities from within as well if you don't move, as justice strikes those who least expect it."\n\nYour friend, Jin Shuren\n\nZhang Beiyuan has begun to mobilise his army in the name of the governorship and Han rule over Xinjiang. This has quelled talks of internal dissent temporarily as well with Jin proving his ability to unify this chaotic province in this time of insubordination."
 xin.45.a: "Of course he'd come to reason."

 xin.46.t: "Disunity"
 xin.46.desc: "With Jin being the cause of both the southern uprising and the Kumulik rebellion, many are beginning to grow disillusioned with his rule as governor, seeing him as an incompetent individual who can't even rule over one province properly. Jin will need to tread carefully as letting these rumours be proven true could lead to his downfall as governor and the ascension of someone with different interests in the province. Many rumour this individual to be Sheng Shicai, the Dao-yin of Aksu himself, but surely such a loyal and responsible individual would never try anything of the sort during a time where the governorship needs to be united."
 xin.46.a: "Surely no one would betray us."

 xin.47.t: "Rumours of Army Dissent"
 xin.47.desc: "Sheng Shicai, a man of mystery that many more are becoming attracted to as Jin Shuren continues to show his incapability of managing the mess he has caused within Xinjiang. Many have begun to flock to his Aksu based clique including the former southern warlord himself Ma Shaowu. Many see his significant military experience and competency in managing the city of Aksu as a healthy alternative to both Jin Shuren and Shaowu, who have both proven their inability to manage a true crisis.\n\nSheng is calm, Sheng is responsible, Sheng is the man we need. Those are the words slipping out of the poisonous breath of those in our administration as Jin time and time again shows his complete foolishness. Sheng too has joined the voices speaking against Jin, and Jin is worried that his reign may soon be brought to an abrupt end."
 xin.47.a: "Surely not..."

 xin.48.t: "Sheng Shicai's Army Coup"
 xin.48.desc: "Jin Shuren marched out of his quarters, confident in his new plan to end the Kumuliks and Uyghur nationalists and bring order back to his rule. However, his march was closed off sooner then he expected, quickly stopped by his own guards, being forced to the pavement and dragged away from his home. He woke in the place he expected to be, the government capital, still being restrained by his guards. In front of him, Sheng Shicai, wielding a rifle. Without a word, Sheng points his rifle at Jin, as Jin begs for mercy among who he assumed was his most loyal subject. This fell upon deaf ears much to Jin's dismay, as the muzzle lit up and shot him, with Sheng's face being the last thing Jin saw in his lifetime.\n\nSheng Shicai has been installed as the new governor of Xinjiang, having overwhelming support from his fellow administrators including Ma Shaowu. Ready to bring Xinjiang into a new future, Sheng is ready to march unto the scene and end this pointless chaos once and for all."
 xin.48.a: "For a new start!"

 xin.49.t: "Recomposing the Xinjiang Government"
 xin.49.desc: "With our victory, we now have our hands on a trickier situation. Many within our government simply cowered in fear as they watched our beloved province fall to pieces right before their eyes, and we are left with the cowards fate. They'll be facing demotion to positions in Kashgar, with some of the ones being moved including Ma Shaowu who could be blamed for the East Turkestan Uprising and Mahmut Muhti, who formally served Kumul but has willing joined our government. The question remains of just how massive these punishments on our part should be, as upsetting too many officials could bite us in the back later, but could give us a chance to remove any threats to our power."
 xin.49.a: "Mercy should be a point of our government."
 xin.49.b: "No cowards are safe from our revolution, mass demotion."

 xin.50.t: "The Uyghur Traitors"
 xin.50.desc: "The East Turkestan Uprising was a disaster resulting in the deaths of many innocents, with the majority of the blame consequently falling onto Ma Shaowu's shoulders. Some of our government officials defected to their side when we needed them most, the most notable being the Uyghur official Burhan Shahidi. While he has faced the fate of a lower government position in Kashgar due to his military and political experience being notable, the fate of those who followed him to their side still needs to be decided. Most are simply power hungry simpletons who want any grasp at power, but filling the government will still have its uses in ensuring stability with the people and officials."
 xin.50.a: "They can be introduced to the new Kashgar government."
 xin.50.b: "How dare they think they deserve forgiveness."

 xin.51.t: "The Purge of Uyghur Soldiers"
 xin.51.desc: "As another meeting began in the Kashgar government between Ma Shaowu, Mahmut Muhti, and Burhan Shahidi on the composition of the government, something... unexpected occurred. The entire building they were in began to catch fire, as they were quickly surrounded by hellscape on all sides, unable to escape. While during their last moments, they were able to question how they had gotten to this point, they all knew the cause deep inside. The fire was coordinated by Sheng himself in order to remove his last remaining rivals from Xinjiang, leaving only simple ministers who don't question his orders at his side. As what were seen as the last great three in Xinjiang all died together in one great flame, Sheng had finally managed to secure his rule once and for all."
 xin.51.a: "A new Xinjiang is secured."

 xin.52.t: "The Purge of Uyghur Soldiers"
 xin.52.desc: "As another meeting began in the Kashgar government between Ma Shaowu, Mahmut Muhti, and Burhan Shahidi on the composition of the government, something... unexpected occurred. The entire building they were in began to catch fire, with them barely being able to escape due to forewarning from lower members of government. They already knew the reason behind this, as this was no accident, but the workings of Sheng to remove his remaining political rivals once and for all. The three men under Ma Shaowu rode north with a small regiment in the hopes of being able to overthrow Sheng swiftly before he has time to react. This is their last resort as the fate of Xinjiang lies on the table, but whether such a desperate gambit can even succeed is another question."
 xin.52.a: "Shaowu's gambit is a massive failure."
 xin.52.b: "Sheng is overthrown in Aksu."

 xin.53.t: "Sheng's Purge Fails"
 xin.53.desc: "What Sheng heard was going to be a meeting between Ma Shaowu, Mahmut Muhti, and Burhan Shahidi was currently under way in Kashgar, but something... unexpected occurred. While Sheng's plan was to set fire to the building and end his three greatest threats once and for all, none of them were in the building. In fact, the entire building was empty, without a trace of any soul. All of this was in the report given to Sheng, as panic began to set in over the whereabouts of his three rivals. He would meet them sooner then expected however, as them and their army soon surrounded Aksu before Sheng could react. Sheng had been betrayed, as his own northern government was infiltrated by agents of the three men allowing this plot to occur. Sheng has no choice but to surrender, leaving him to be imprisoned with his fate decided at a later point, as Shaowu now rules over Xinjiang in his Triumvirate alongside Mahmut Muhti and Burhan Shahidi."
 xin.53.a: "Maybe we shouldn't have given them so many resources..."

 xin.100.t: "Kumul Boils in Violence"
 xin.100.desc: "What Jin Shuren could not see from his palace in Dihua was the rampant dissatisfaction brewing in Hami. Not only in the dispossessed Begs and unemployed Advisors, but the very people of Hami were anxious for reform. Now the people rally around [TAN.GetLeader] and raise their banners high in response to the final cruelty imposed by Jin's regime. With a road directly running from Hami to Dihua, it is essential we stomp this rebellion, and fast. "
 xin.100.a: "Heed my every order and you might survive."

 xinfd.1.t: "Dealing with Dzungari Banditry"
 xinfd.1.desc: "With Jin Shuren doubling down on his rule, he has found himself in charge of the banditry problem among the northern Mongolian population. Moving in from Mongolia itself, this group has begun to wreak havoc among the Kazakh and Uyghur population within the region. While a minor problem for now, it should be dealt with before they can gain momentum and even possibly defect to Mongolia itself. Jin Shuren already has a partially supplied and manned regiment ready to move, leaving us in a good position to end this now."
 xinfd.1.a: "Time to end this."

 xinfd.2.t: "Mongol Bandit Camp Spotted"
 xinfd.2.desc: "As our troops began their advance, they spotted what seems to be one of the main Mongolian camps being used to smuggle arms to bandits. Like many Mongol encampments, the camp is undefended but hard to sneak up on. Currently having around 500 cavalry marching around and checking on supply, our troops are ready to march and cause chaos at any time. All we need is the order to move."
 xinfd.2.a: "Begin the assault."

 xinfd.3.t: "The Assault on the Mongol Bandit Camp"
 xinfd.3.desc: "While our troops did indeed get the jump on the enemy causing chaos initially, it seems the effect was rather short lived as they managed to regroup quickly before another regiment of 50 cavalry on the enemies side. Clashes have begun once again, although on much more even footing. We still outnumber by a significant amount, but it isn't predicted that we'll be escaping this one unscathed if the battle keeps heading in this direction."
 xinfd.3.a: "Are the troops capable of anything?"

 xinfd.4.t: "Victory at a Cost"
 xinfd.4.desc: "The smoke has finally settled with the troops returning home... less than alright. While they did indeed manage to disperse and destroy the Mongolian camp, they were faced with many losses and less guns then what they came in with. While this should significantly lower the frequency of raids and the organisation of these bandits, it came at its own costs that we'll have to pay the price for. Hopefully another operation like this will not be necessary anytime soon."
 xinfd.4.a: "It was worth it in the end."

 xinfd.5.t: "An Exiled General from Xinjiang Arrives"
 xinfd.5.d: "While our military does not reach the standard of loyalty seen in Western powers, we pride ourselves in meritocracy. The commanders and field marshals you see on the battlefield have proven their loyalty to the leader and the people. On the other hand, victory could hinge on the deadly will exhibited by some of the more mercenary commanders, those willing to do-or-die. This man comes to us from the tumultuous Qing, whose cliques have relied heavily on mercenary commanders in the past. This general comes with a sob story of how the tides turned against him, and he came ragged to us ready to fight the good fight for once. Whether he is genuine is hard to determine, but we must decide if he is worth recruiting in this already-traitorous times."
 xinfd.5.a: "We need all the help we can get."
 xinfd.5.b: "No, he could be a liability."

 xinfd.15.t: "Striking the Ruler of Kashgar"
 xinfd.15.d: "The loose rebels of East Turkestan are unified by one figure: Sabit Damulla. The Bughra brothers of Hotan and the merchant noble Timur Beg are only unified by Sabit Damulla. If you remove Sabit, you remove their unity, and their coalition is likely to collapse. After finding out the location of Sabit Damulla from an interrogation, our military staff has decided that now is the time to act. The person most prepared to run this mission is our general Burhan Shahidi. He hates the Uyghur rebels more than most, and has in the past shown decent success at missions like this. We could send him into rebel land with a small group of professional troops, and attack Damulla's house while he sleeps. Hopefully, Shahidi will succeed."
 xinfd.15.a: "Good luck to Shahidi."

 xinfd.16.t: "Assassination Attempt on Sabit Damulla!"
 xinfd.16.d: "A tragic event has occurred today. While Sabit Damulla slept in his house, his guards waited lazily outside, not focusing on the mountains around them. As one of the guards sat on a step, taking apart his gun, his skull was suddenly filled with lead. The gunshot rang through the valley, as the rest of the guards sprang into action. A firefight broke out as, from the peak of a nearby hill, a band of soldiers, around 18 strong, charged down the hill, led by Xinjiang Clique general Burhan Shahidi. The group were able to kill the 7 guards outside the house, but lost 3 themselves. As they approached the house, they lost 2 more to guards shooting out from the window. Shahidi himself kicked through the door and shot another guard through the head with his pistol. The group travelled through the house and killed another 3 guards, losing none themselves. Now, the only one left was Sabit Damulla. As they approached Sabit's bedroom, Shahidi reloaded his pistol, smiling at his success. However, when he bashed through the door, all he found was an empty bed and an open window. Shahidi realised his mistake of not leaving more soldiers outside to guard the perimeter, as Sabit Damulla slipped through his grasp. Within the hour hundreds of Sabits troops got to the house, but by then Shahidi and his men had gone.\n\nThough the assassination was a failure, it will still have dire consequences. Sabit Damulla, paranoid for his life, has gone into hiding, leaving it very difficult to communicate with him. Divisions are left disorganised and are even sometimes turning against each other."
 xinfd.16.a: "Damn them!"

 xinfd.17.t: "Assassination failed on Sabit Damulla"
 xinfd.17.d: "Burhan Shahidi has returned, having failed his mission. He recounts a story of how his men charged down a hill towards Sabit Damulla's house, killing multiple guards on their way down. He talks of how he himself kicked down the front door and shot multiple guards with his pistol. However, by the time he got to Sabit's bedroom, he had escaped.\n\nThough Shahidi failed in his mission, this is not a total loss. Our spies in Hotan and Kashgar have told us that Sabit Damulla has gone into hiding, completely isolating himself from most other people. This has led to complete disorganisation in the East Turkestan forces."
 xinfd.17.a: "Not a total loss."

 xin.110.t: "Reports of Yang Zengxin in Yunnan"
 xin.110.desc: "Following the disappearance of Xinjiang's sage governor Yang Zengxin, reporters have flocked to Mengzi in Yunnan to get the scoop from his hometown. The townspeople of Mengzi remarked that Yang's family is still well off, and are refusing to give hints as to where Yang would have gone. Most reporters came to the conclusion that Yang had returned to his military post in Gansu, and ended their investigation there. The intrepid few with connections in Gansu, however, have reported that Yang has not been seen in Gansu, but traces of his gold bullion have shown up in the hands of trade merchants in Yunnan. Although there is no solid proof as of yet, it appears that Yang could either have been robbed or is living incognito."
 xin.110.a: "A good mystery."

 xin.111.t: "Xinjiang Clique Erupts in War"
 xin.111.d: "It seems like the Western Gate between China and Central Asia has broken down into violence once again. Governor [SIK.GetLeader] 's recent dispute with Kumul has resulted in a large contingent of volunteer soldiers rising up against the army garrison. Rumours say that the Turks to the far west are also preparing to defy the Governor once again.\n\nThe Governor of Xinjiang, should he remain chinese, represents a potential ally to the southern Democratic cliques. The Kumuliliks, however, seem to vary greatly in between respect for Beijing to restless xenophobia. The Eastern Turks doubtlessly would separate from China entirely should they win."
 xin.111.a: "Yang Zengxin's final failure."

 SIK_three_reigns_desc: "Xinjiang, despite what the official documents may claim, has a decentralised power structure centred around three cities. These cities, Dihua, Aksu, and Khotan, control three vital forts and administer the richest land for cultivation outside of Kumul. The Dao-yin, which replaced the Amban, decide the fate of Xinjiang."

 SIK_dihua_governorship: "Dihua Governorship"
 SIK_dihua_governorship_desc: "Jin Shuren's fortress in Dihua has persevered against the rebels. Jin Shuren attributes the might of the Han system of governance, as built by Yang Zengxin and refined by himself, as the reason Xinjiang has prevailed. Jin will now purge those who questioned their loyalty to him."

 SIK_make_them_pay: "Make Them Pay"
 SIK_make_them_pay_desc: "The rebels in Kashgar and Kumul are more than just pawns of foreign imperial powers, they themselves are capable of self governance. Jin Shuren has promised his loyal men the land and wealth of those that betrayed him, and now they are ready to collect."

 SIK_new_taxes: "New Taxes"
 SIK_new_taxes_desc: "The taxes that incited such anger in Kumul are to be re-imposed, in spite of their reluctance. There is no other way to ply obedience from these provincials without setting the law and applying it justly to everyone. If they can't afford to pay, they should just leave Xinjiang for good."

 SIK_shurens_new_groove: "Vanity Projects"
 SIK_shurens_new_groove_desc: "Jin Shuren has dedicated state funds to a set of statues to him and his brave Han warriors to be erected throughout Xinjiang. These statues require new masonry and plumbing facilities. Future generations of Han and provincials will look to heroes like Burhan Shahidi and Ma Shaowu and see the pinnacle of morality."

 SIK_a_closer_clique: "A Closer Clique"
 SIK_a_closer_clique_desc: "The distribution of power between Dihua, Aksu and Khotan has proven to be unsustainable. Jin Shuren has made the generous decision to hire all capable bureaucrats currently serving in these cities to Dihua to centralise his rule. Even more graciously, Jin will pay the same to bureaucrats regardless of their ethnicity."

 SIK_never_seen_suppression: "A New Suppression Campaign"
 SIK_never_seen_suppression_desc: "In Xinjiang, conflicts are a family affair. Jin Shuren knew this, and is glad he left his family behind in Gansu. For those who were unlucky enough to oppose Jin, their families will be imprisoned as collateral to ensure they will not commit to any more protracted rebellions."

 SIK_gansu_road: "The Gansu Road"
 SIK_gansu_road_desc: "The road to Gansu bends around the salt lake of Lop Nur, and passes through Hami. This route gave disproportionate influence to the ungrateful Khanate that used to live there. To avoid giving Hami any more influence, Jin has decided that a new trade route will be built that crosses the desert through Loulan and Dunhuang."

 SIK_colonize_kumul: "Colonise Hami"
 SIK_colonize_kumul_desc: "The people of Hami suffered under the ill rule of the ancient Chagatai khans, prisoners of the ancient barbarian regimes. No more! Hami will have their open lands resold at affordable prices to the grateful people of Xinjiang, who will help modernise Xinjiang."

 SIK_sharing_the_love: "Sharing the Love"
 SIK_sharing_the_love_desc: "There was a great bounty of gold confiscated from the Uyghurs in the Tarim Basin, which has finally arrived in Dihua. After Governor Jin sufficiently compensated himself for his thankless work, he has magnanimously given the remaining gold to the families who fought alongside him, and landlords who gave their grain to feed the army."

 SIK_statewide_projects: "Statewide Projects"

 SIK_trade_dealing: "Trade Deals"
 SIK_trade_dealing_desc: "As Jin took power so soon before the rebels came out in force, he has not had the time to reaffirm the trade deals Yang Zengxin made. A stable trade flow will restore the peoples' confidence in Jin."

 SIK_dao_yin_khotan: "The Dao-yin of Hotan"
 SIK_dao_yin_khotan_desc: "After having to live under a succession of cruel Chinese petty-dictators, Ma Shaowu has triumphed in Khotan. As de-facto Governor, Ma Shaowu is the first leader of Xinjiang in decades to openly practise Islam. Ma vows to correct the decades of hollow promises with his Jahriyya oath to never hide his intentions from the people."

 SIK_secret_police_brigades: "Secret Police"
 SIK_secret_police_brigades_desc: "The Jahriyya order opposes all forms of secrecy... except for the Secret Police. Ma Shaowu needs his men to monitor the radical Jadidists and ultranationalist Han. Without the Secret Police, future insurrection from these groups is a foregone conclusion."

 SIK_cutting_central_asia: "Cutting off Central Asia"
 SIK_cutting_central_asia_desc: "The Jadidists that threaten Ma Shaowu's religious and political position are the byproduct of Central Asian agitation. If we are to ensure the end of Jadidist influence, we must set down the law to the Turkomans and Kazakhs. They are not permitted to fortify their borders with us, and immigrants to Xinjiang must surrender their weapons."

 SIK_inspiration_jahriyya: "Inspiration from Jahriyya"
 SIK_inspiration_jahriyya_desc: "The Jahriyya has survived centuries of persecution through their adherence to Sufism over Hanafi Islam. Now we have the freedom to show Xinjiang the centuries of commentary that have laid in secret and suppressed."

 SIK_tungan_domination: "Tungan Abstinence"
 SIK_tungan_domination_desc: "It is outrageous to the Governor that his garrisons are still plagued by drug addicted soldiers. The Turpan garrison showed a much greater restraint, and should be the model for all of Xinjiang's armed forces. We shall summarily replace the drug addicts in our military with sober Muslims, who will not let the situation degrade as it did under other leaders."

 SIK_opening_immigration: "Opening Immigration"
 SIK_opening_immigration_desc: "The open land we confiscated during the Kumul and Turkestan rebellions are now laying untilled. In order to secure the loyalty of future residents and to make back some money, we have opened up the land to immigration. "

 SIK_outside_kashgar: "Menhuan Education"
 SIK_outside_kashgar_desc: "The Governor has invited the Sufi orders that are scattered around Western China to practise openly in Xinjiang. Menhuan will help replace the closed madrasa that were being used to radicalise the Uyghurs."

 SIK_new_army: "The New Army"
 SIK_new_army_desc: "The massive losses sustained through attrition and mismanagement of the army must end. The Governor has taken his Generals to tasks for their shortcomings, and vows to review the army and finance reforms using state funds."

 SIK_removing_mongol_threat: "Removing the Mongol Threat"
 SIK_removing_mongol_threat_desc: "The Mongols threatened Dzungaria in our darkest hour, and we must never forget that. The Governor, with the backing of the Muslims in Xinjiang, is ready to make the Mongols answer for their wanton aggression on the Ummah."

 SIK_extend_network: "Extending the Network"
 SIK_extend_network_desc: "The isolation of Xinjiang was due to Yang Zengxin's own paranoid leadership and kleptocracy. If Xinjiang is ever to recover and compete with both Central Asia and China, we must expand our trade network."

 SIK_purging_suspicion: "Purging Suspicion"
 SIK_purging_suspicion_desc: "The civil servants of Xinjiang must be jaded at this point by the cycle of coups in their offices. Suspicion is not something the Governor can erase easily, but a good step towards creating a permanent government in Xinjiang is a mass promotion of those civil servants that did not steal from their office or engage in graft."

 SIK_dao_yin_aksu: "The Dao-yin of Aksu"
 SIK_dao_yin_aksu_desc: "Sheng's brief time as Dao-yin of Aksu has seen the city rise to great influence while the rest of Xinjiang crumbled. Governor Sheng is now ready to use Aksu as a launching ground politically for a radical set of reforms that are compatible with Marxism, Federalism, and even western democracy as seen in India."

 SIK_establish_neutrality: "Establish Neutrality"
 SIK_establish_neutrality_desc: "Governor Sheng is extremely wary of committing to a national conflict. Sending Xinjiang's soldiers abroad could invite dissidents at home to revolt once again. So, as a pragmatic adoption of the southern Chinese democratic thought, Sheng has proclaimed neutrality in Western China."

 SIK_seven_point_manifesto: "The Seven Point Manifesto"
 SIK_seven_point_manifesto_desc: "After compiling a set of programmes from Southern China, including Sun-Yat Sen's Principles, Karl Marx's Capital, and Chen's Federalist declaration, Sheng has formulated a Seven Point Manifesto to reform Xinjiang towards true democracy with regards to the limitations of war time."

 SIK_equality_of_races: "Equality of Races"
 SIK_equality_of_races_desc: "One of Sheng's Seven Points is to end racial segregation in Xinjiang. As the Five Races Banner illustrates, China must recognise racial diversity, and incorporate Han with Hui, Mongol, and Tibetan. These four races have underlying mutual self interest in Chinese unity, something East Turkestan did not want."

 SIK_kazakh_exodus: "Kazakh Exodus"
 SIK_kazakh_exodus_desc: "The Kazakh people living on the border of Xinjiang are a source for future discontent. From sneaking Ottoman agitators into Kashgar, to distributing Jadidist literature, there is no value gained by tolerating them in Xinjiang. "

 SIK_filling_government: "Filling the Government"
 SIK_filling_government_desc: "When the cities of Xinjiang crumbled, the civil servants of Xinjiang were scattered. It is important that, when refilling the government service, we imprint the Seven Points into the fabric of our bureaucracy. This includes hiring Hui, Mongol, and Tibetans, should they have the proper qualifications."

 SIK_positions_for_uyghurs: "Positions for Uyghurs"
 SIK_positions_for_uyghurs_desc: "Although separate, Uyghurs in Xinjiang did play a valuable role in defending Dihua. Governor Sheng feels that the tide of public opinion is slowly turning against Jadidists, and a reward to loyal officers like Burhan Shahidi is in order."

 SIK_the_purge: "The Purge"
 SIK_the_purge_desc: "It has come to the Governor's attention that there are inconsolable issues between the Uyghur and Hui people in Xinjiang. This is manifested in not only the rivalry between Jahriyya and Jadidist, but in a reinforcement of Chinese language as a shibboleth. Another, more organised purge may be necessary to solve this."

 SIK_kuomintangs_xinjiang: "The Kuomintang's Xinjiang"
 SIK_kuomintangs_xinjiang_desc: "The Kuomintang has interested Sheng Shicai for decades, going back to his early days in Manchuria. Having taken a position against direct intervention if unnecessary, Governor Sheng has chosen to aid the KMT through donations from the state treasury."

 SIK_education_reform: "Education Reform"
 SIK_education_reform_desc: "The madrasa in Kashgar, when Sheng shut it down, created a gap in education for the city. Like so many other towns in Xinjiang, formal education has been replaced with religious education by obvious Ottoman infiltrators. True education for Xinjiang must be secular, focused on science, and be open to both girls and boys."

 SIK_modernist_schools: "Modernist Schools"
 SIK_modernist_schools_desc: "Where the madras and menhuan failed Xinjiang, the Modernist school will succeed. Governor Sheng has assembled several university-trained educators in his office to hammer out a modern, westernised education curriculum."

 SIK_local_teachers: "Local Teachers"
 SIK_local_teachers_desc: "The folly of the Yang and Jin government was their mistrust of their own people to educate each other. Just as our Governor educated himself, so will the people utilise and adapt the revolutionary literature of our time to improve their lives."

 SIK_cultural_promotion_socities: "Cultural Promotion Societies"
 SIK_cultural_promotion_socities_desc: "The people of Xinjiang suffer from the Imperialist mindset. Instead of working towards cooperation, it is evident to Governor Sheng that the Uyghur and Hui people will need to be supported within the Han system of the Kuomintang. This can be achieved through Cultural Promotion Societies."

 SIK_curbing_addiction: "Curbing the Addiction"
 SIK_curbing_addiction_desc: "The garrisons of Xinjiang suffered under Yang Zengxin's leadership, especially with regards to discipline. Soldiers have been known to visit Gansu and load up on opium during holidays. It is time for the Governor to take responsibility for the army and ban drugs from army bases."

 SIK_expand_tungan_recruitment: "Expand Tungan Recruitment"
 SIK_expand_tungan_recruitment_desc: "The Tungan people are neglected by the Western Gate, and are suffering more than most in Western China. This makes the Tungan people ideal recruits for the Xinjiang military, which can elevate and allow young men to escape poverty in their home town."

 SIK_uyghur_militia: "Uyghur Militia"
 SIK_uyghur_militia_desc: "The Uyghur people suffer greatly during this time of disunity, and their young men wander aimlessly for a purpose. In order to ensure they do not fall under into the clutches of the Jadidists, we must make the effort to recruit them into a militia. The militia will be a safeguard against anti Han agitation, even if it is never strong enough to be used."

 SIK_proper_training: "Proper Training"
 SIK_proper_training_desc: "The Governor has ordered new training manuals from Baoding to be shipped to his office, convinced that new developments in military schools outmode current training. Should these manuals win over the general staff, our garrisons are to be trained in the new drills immediately."

 SIK_expand_arms_industry: "Expand the Arms Industry"
 SIK_expand_arms_industry_desc: "The arms industry in Xinjiang has long depended on outdated weapons from the east being sold to us at inflated prices. The Governor wishes to ensure that future conflict will not be derailed by defective weaponry, thus he is authorising the hiring of more machinists."

 SIK_expand_military_academy: "Expand Kashgar Chinese Schooling"
 SIK_expand_military_academy_desc: "Kashgar, in the wake of the madrasa's closing, lacks any form of reliable education. Education is seen by the Governor not only as a tool for economic growth, but for increasing his influence on the young men of Xinjiang. A Chinese school in Kashgar will achieve both goals."

 SIK_raid_nationalist_camps: "Raid Nationalist Camps"
 SIK_raid_nationalist_camps_desc: "Nationalist camps on the border of Xinjiang have taken advantage of the fertile land in recent years to set up farms. It is our belief that some of the opium that our soldiers are addicted to is coming from these nationalist camps. If we were to exercise our right to disperse these camps, their opium farms would be ours."

 SIK_russian_technology: "Russian Technology"
 SIK_russian_technology_desc: "The Russian delegation in Xinjiang has whittled down to a single unpaid diplomat, whom is seriously considering retirement. If we can encourage the delegate to send letters to Russia claiming the province is under control, we may be able to attract some Russian engineers to help us survive."

 SIK_foreign_assistance: "Foreign Assistance"
 SIK_foreign_assistance_desc: "The current state of the Xinjiang foreign office is lamentable. Where just two decades ago Russian diplomats, Ambans, and British explorers gladly filed in to inform the Governor, now most avoid it for fear of being extorted by the few remaining bureaucrats. The Governor has authorised the hiring of more bureaucrats to reform the office."

 SIK_russian_sector: "The Russian Connection"
 SIK_russian_sector_desc: "Diplomatic relations with Russia were not kept up under Governor Yang Zengxin, and our remaining influence on Russia comes in the form of land grants to speculators. The Governor has compiled a list of land grants to entice Russians to immigrate to Xinjiang, and indirectly make our safety a greater concern for Russia as a whole."

 SIK_russian_investment: "Russian Economic Investment"
 SIK_russian_investment_desc: "It is reported that in Kazan there are fraudulent claims in Xinjiang for sale. It is the opinion of the Governor that, in order to bring legitimacy to his office and entice Russian investment, some of these land grants should be honoured. So long as they are for land we haven't already sold."

 SIK_industrial_expansion: "Industrial Expansion"
 SIK_industrial_expansion_desc: "The vast flow of unemployed workers into Xinjiang is an opportunity for us to expand the provincial armoury. The Governor has authorised the construction of inner city roads to facilitate heavy industry, which will hopefully be the tipping point for enterprising citizens to build factories for themselves."

 SIK_north: "Expanding the North"
 SIK_north_desc: "Dzungaria has been at risk of invasion from the Mongols for decades, and we having to expend significant energy patrolling the land. Fixing the main road through Dzungaria will go a long way towards keeping it secure and the people happy."

 SIK_mineral_expedition: "Mineral Expedition"
 SIK_mineral_expedition_desc: "There are rumours that a massive oil deposit exists in Dunshanzi. It is well worth the cost for the Governor to send engineers out to Dunshanzi and assess the value of the land. We can hopefully recoup the cost by producing valuable land grants."

 SIK_south: "Connecting the South"
 SIK_south_desc: "Tunganistan has suffered under the decades of neglect under Yang Zengxin's regime. Now the multitudes of requests to fix the road from Kashgar to Khotan can be granted, and the people there to benefit from our administration."

 SIK_expanding_dihua: "Increasing Dihua's Capacity"
 SIK_expanding_dihua_desc: "The battlements around Dihua have left a lot of land cleared of vegetation. This fallow land cannot be used for farming yet, but with the proper direction the land can be flattened for modern machine factories."

 SIK_dihua_fortification: "Dihua Fortifications"
 SIK_dihua_fortification_desc: "The walls of Dihua are covered in torn propaganda. These words cannot defend against determined rebels any more. The Governor has authorised additional fortifications to be built around Dihua to add power to our new propaganda we write on the walls."

 SIK_settling_dzungaria_tribes: "Settling Dzungarian Tribes"
 SIK_settling_dzungaria_tribes_desc: "The tribes of Dzungaria have been unable to reap the benefits from the good harvests of 1936. Their town leaders have requested permission to resettle south, something the Governor does not want, but lacks the force to deny."

 SIK_northern_gold: "Northern Gold"
 SIK_northern_gold_desc: "The rumours of gold in western Xinjiang have made their way into fraudulent land grants you can find throughout western China. It is obvious to the Governor that an official expedition to the reported sources of gold must be made. The potential wealth, if proven true, will more than pay for the trip."

 SIK_khotan_carpet_factory: "Expand the Hotan Carpet Factory"
 SIK_khotan_carpet_factory_desc: "Khotan is famed for their hardy wool carpets, to the point where you can find markets in Afghanistan and India passing them off as ours. It may behove the Governor to invest in a large scale carpet factory in Khotan, if only for the ability to manipulate the market and increase their value."

 SIK_kashgar_investment: "Investing in Kashgar"
 SIK_kashgar_investment_desc: "The destruction wrought in Kashgar must be answered with concern. The Governor has authorised funding to go into repairing and building small scale industry in Kahsgar."

 SIK_navigating_desert: "Navigating the Taklamakan"
 SIK_navigating_desert_desc: "The Taklamakan basin is a death trap for travellers, and for decades has been circumvented by the road to Kumul. With the latest insurgency seeing armies cross the basin to ambush us, it is worth it to consider setting up small outposts in the basin to allow us to navigate it in an emergency."

 SIK_open_mineral_mining: "Open the Mines"
 SIK_open_mineral_mining_desc: "The mines of Khotan that were closed during the strike are finally reopened. Miners are easily found to replace the rebels in the numerous immigrants to Xinjiang."

 SIK_xinjiang_railways_desc: "The greatest goal of any modern Xinjiang governor is to have a railway. Thought impossible due to the extreme temperature, banditry, and costs, it may be time to revive the dream."

That year, the court was abolished and Fan travelled to Beijing to serve under the Beiyang Government. Passed up for the position of Dao-Yin of Dihua, Fan was appointed Dao-Yin of the more impoverished Aksu. Furthering his education, Fan learned Russian at the Xinjiang Russian Law School, and made efforts to promote cohesion between the newly arrived Russian immigrants to Aksu. In 1920, Governor Yang Zengxin appointed Fan as Xinjiang's representative to Russia, wherein Fan negotiated a deal to end Russian tariffs to Xinjiang until 1940.

Yang Zengxin was impressed by Ma Shaowu's loyalty, and appointed him to dispose of the warlord Ma Fuxing in 1924. Ma Shaowu was given the Dao-Yin of Hotan as a reward. Ma Shaowu's policy as Dao-Yin leaned more towards opposing aggressive Russian immigration, and held Uyghurs and Mongolian residents in low regard.

Upon the failure of the Northern Expedition, Sheng returned to China and joined the Guominjun under Feng Yuxiang in 1928. Following the destruction of Gansu, Sheng took a job offer from Fan Yaonan to lead the Aksu Garrison.

Jin used this position to pass the Imperial Civil Service Examinations, which got Jin the attention of Yang Zengxin.

The ensuing years of revolution depleted Yang's administrative staff, pushing Jin higher until he was appointed Commissioner of Civil Affairs in Urmuqi in 1927. Jin began to use his position as Commissioner to curry favour with several of the propagandising movements coming from Southern China. The underground KMT movement and nascent Federalist movements regarded Jin as a model Han bureaucrat serving what they regard as undeserving provincials.§!"

 SIK_burhan_shahidi_leader_desc: "§YBorn:§! §LOctober 3rd, 1894, in Kazan Governorate, Russian Empire§!\n§YBackground:§! §LBurhan Shahidi was born to a family whose ancestors had fled from Aksu after a failed peasant uprising during the Qing dynasty. His family was poor and he received little schooling in his early years. In 1912, after the Xinhai Revolution, Burhan accompanied Tatar merchants to Dihua in Xinjiang and worked as an apprentice and store-clerk. In 1914, Burhan was able to apply and receive Chinese citizenship from the Republic of China on account of his family's ancestry. He spoke Uyghur, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, Turkish and some Arabic and acted as the interpreter for Xinjiang Governor Yang Zengxin. Burhan's relations to the Turkic community soured as a result of working under Yang Zengxin, and fellow Uyghurs began to ostracise Burhan. Burhan's meagre position in Yang's administration meant he was unable to mend this distrust, and the Uyghur community's drift towards rebellion alienated Burhan further. Ultimately Burhan choose to attend courses at Baoding Army School starting in 1929, allowing him to be hired by Yang as both an administrator and officer. Upon Burhan's return to Xinjiang in 1934, he found the administration in decline, and unable to correct the widening gap between the Uyghur community and has resigned himself to being an effective public servant under what he considers the best possible administration to industrialise Xinjiang.§!"

While he managed to secure a sinecure under Yang Zengxin, he soon had to leave the province as his store in Dihua, which aimed to provide him with more income, only added to his debts.\n\nIn 1917, recognising that he could only utilise his skills to make a living in Xinjiang, Zhang offered his services to Yang Zengxin and was appointed as the commander of a cavalry company in Altay, located north of Xinjiang. His fortunes took a turn when a group of defeated Russian soldiers entered Altay during the Russian Civil War. Despite being heavily outnumbered, Zhang successfully deceived the Russian soldiers by creating the illusion that the Chinese army was well-prepared and adequately manned, using military hats placed on rocks in the trenches. Leveraging his intrigue skills, Zhang even negotiated the departure of the Russian soldiers by employing a merchant with a striking resemblance to a former governor in Xinjiang, pretending that he is an official envoy. These audacious acts not only safeguarded his position but also earned him significant recognition from Yang Zengxin, leading to his promotion as a regimental commander. Subsequently, Zhang was appointed as a tutor at the Dihua Military Academy and became a prominent military figure in Xinjiang.\n\n§YNotes: This ambitious officer staunchly opposes any form of foreign influence or intervention in Xinjiang and is prepared to defend his position against any threats.§!"

His father is an official in Kunming, and Niu Shi himself studied at an army primary school there before attending the Hubei Army Secondary School. This aspirational cadet furthered his military education at the Baoding Military Academy and his training was put into practice during the Xinhai Revolution, where he served as a commander of the revolutionary forces in Hanyang and Shanghai, contributing to China's greatest revolution.\n\nIn 1913, Niu was sent to Xinjiang province and was appointed to various defence positions in the past two decades by Yang Zengxin. In 1915, as the chief of staff of Yang Feixia, the Defence Commissioner of Ili, Niu was appointed Chief of the Military Surveying Bureau of Ili and entrusted with handling Sino-Russian border affairs. Due to his commendable service, Niu Shi was became the acting Commissioner of Defense of Ili in 1920 after Yang Feixia resigned from the post. His position in Xinjiang remained secure as this able officer, who attained the rank of lieutenant general in 1927, received much recognition from both superiors and colleagues.\n\n§YNotes: Having spent two decades in Ili, Niu compiled \"Military Geography of Ili\", which introduces the mountainous military geography of the area in detail. He also established schools to facilitate Chinese language learning for ethnic minority students and encouraged cultural exchange. In addition, this diligent officer is known for his generous contributions to philanthropic endeavours in his home province, Yunnan.§!"

He studied railway engineering before enrolling in the 6th Class of the Imperial Japanese Army Academy in 1906, it was during this time Yang embraced revolutionary ideas and joined the Tongmenghui. After finishing his studies in logistics, he returned to China and took part in the Second Guangzhou Uprising and the Xinhai Revolution in 1911. Before being sent to Xinjiang by the Nanjing provisional government to sway Yang Zengxin in the next year, Yang served as a staff of Dr Sun and a brigade commander.\n\nServing briefly as the chief of staff of Yang and the Xinjiang governorate, Yang Feixia was then appointed Defence Commissioner of Ili, with Niu Shi as his chief of staff, together they successfully settled the Russian population entered Xinjiang during the catastrophic Russian Civil War. Despite being his relatives, Yang Feixia, who had divergences over administration and military direction with the governor, realised that Yang Zengxin was increasingly suspicious towards his countrymen, he thus resigned from his post in 1921. Since then, Yang Feixia has been holding an advisory military sinecure in the province as he was never allowed to leave. Yet, his military capability is commended by his colleagues.\n\n§YNotes: Yang inspects the barracks incognito often, it is said that once he was refused to enter the city at late night, he crossed the city walls with merely a dagger, and the sentries who refused to let him in were awarded the next day.§!"
