 MOR_a_new_kind_of_horsepower: "A New Kind of Horsepower"
 MOR_a_new_kind_of_horsepower_desc: "Armoured vehicles have revolutionised modern warfare. A division of our own armoured cavalry would give us an advantage against many other nations, and even the playing field against our neighbours in Algiers."

### Intro Screen ###
 MOR_country_intro_header: "History of Morocco"
 MOR_country_intro_content: "In 1904, France and Spain carved out zones of influence in Morocco. Recognition by the United Kingdom of France's sphere of influence provoked a strong reaction from the German Empire, and a crisis loomed in 1905. The matter was resolved at the Algeciras Conference in 1906. The Agadir Crisis of 1911 increased tensions between European powers. The 1912 Treaty of Fez made Morocco a protectorate of France, and triggered massive riots. By the same treaty, Spain assumed the role of protecting power over the northern and southern Saharan zones.\n\nDuring the Weltkrieg, the Zaian Confederation of Berbers rebelled against France and received ample Central Power support, but failed to achieve any major victories until after the fall of France. While various pretenders attempted to negotiate with the German Empire, they were inconclusive, and in the end, Mohammed V was placed on the throne after his father abdicated. The new Sultan signed a new treaty with the Germans, one whose influence on internal Moroccan affairs was greatly diminished compared to the French Protectorate. The treaty is carefully worded as to render it as amicable as possible. However, tensions still flare up on occasion, sometimes requiring the German-backed Royal Guard to intervene.\n\nAs the '30s roared in, Morocco recovered from the Protectorate era, yet relations with Algiers remain quite cool, event to the point that some nationalists advocate strengthening the alliance with the German Empire to secure Moroccan independence. The Sultan must safeguard Morocco against not only the revanchist French elites in Algeria, but also the savage revolutionaries in Paris who see Morocco as a gateway for the revolution into Africa and the Islamic World."

###Events###
 mor.2.t: "Berber Issue"
 mor.2.d: "We need to decide what we are to do with the Berbers in our nation."
 mor.2.a: "Live and let live."
 mor.2.b: "Force arabisation on the pagan-animists."

 mor.3.t: "New Western Realm"
 mor.3.d: "Given our situation, we have the ability to focus our efforts on developing one area of primary concern."
 mor.3.a: "Focus on Industry."
 mor.3.b: "Focus on Infrastructure."

 mor.4.t: "Deal with the Reactionary Berbers"
 mor.4.d: "The practices of the Berbers fail to meet our new revolutionary doctrine. We could turn a blind eye to it, for after all, they are our brethren. We could also reduce the tribes so that they fall in line with our revolution. However, their ways might be too ingrained, and we could be better off dealing with them by force."
 mor.4.a: "There is no room for anti-revolutionaries!"
 mor.4.b: "They must be re-educated for their own sake."
 mor.4.c: "They are our brothers and sisters; let them be."

 mor.5.t: "Morocco Asks for Support"
 mor.5.d: "The Moroccans are asking for a military mission to help develop their army."
 mor.5.a: "They are doing just fine by themselves."
 mor.5.b: "Send a military mission to aid their development."

 mor.6.t: "Germany Refuses to Help"
 mor.6.d: "Germany has denied our request for a military mission."
 mor.6.a: "We will grow stronger regardless."

 mor.7.t: "Germany Sends a Military Mission"
 mor.7.d: "Germany has agreed to send a military mission to Morocco within the week. The group they are sending is comprised of 50 advisors and support staff and will advise us for the next eighteen months."
 mor.7.a: "This will only make us stronger."

 mor.106.t: "Morocco Overthrows the Protectorate!"
 mor.106.d: "Sensing our weakness against our enemies in the current conflict, the treacherous Moroccan government has elected to abandon our alliance at our darkest hour. The Moroccan King and his advisors summoned our ambassador to inform him that all of our forces in the region are to leave the country and that they will be declaring neutrality in foreign affairs. This is a deep insult, given how much we've aided their independence from French domination and how much they have benefited from our continued protection. No doubt, their neighbours are looking now with glee at the opportunity to carve up their lands thanks to Moroccan short-sightedness. Still, given our current circumstances, there have been calls within the cabinet to accept this turn of events as fait accompli. With our attention focused on achieving an ultimate victory over oour enemies, it might not be worth adding Morrocco to that list."
 mor.106.a: "We have bigger problems to worry about."
 mor.106.b: "They will not get away with this!"
