 #孫傳芳
 LEP_sun_chuanfang: "Sun Chuanfang"
 LEP_sun_chuanfang_bio: "Like many of his peers who flaunt a variety of colourful monikers, Marshal Sun Chuanfang is known as 'The Smiling Tiger'. His greatest strength lies in careful cultivation of personal relationships, as he is a master of navigating local webs of influence and intrigue; leveraging everyone from old army friends, to wealthy bankers, to foreign dignitaries. It is this last category in particular that has proven to be his best asset, and his German connections have become indispensable.\nHowever, his nickname also carries sinister undertones. Beneath a mask of smiles he is known to be hard to read, and he has executed former friends and former enemies alike after assurances to the contrary. These qualities have left Sun sitting at the head of a vast bureaucratic pyramid, and one of the most powerful men in China."

 LEP_qi_xieyuan: "Qi Xieyuan"
 LEP_qi_xieyuan_bio: "At the academy Qi earned a reputation for short height, masterful calligraphy, and cunning. As a soldier only one of these served him well, but it nonetheless catapulted him to prominence in Eastern China, his rise only cut short by a combination of invasion and allied betrayal in late 1924.\nFor the next several years Qi remained in exile, plotting his return, and in the aftermath of the Shanghai Conference he secured German sponsorship, giving him leave to set up shop in the city of Wuxi. Sun Chuanfang tolerated his presence, perhaps feeling that enemies were best kept close; a feeling he may have since come to regret."

 #陳儀
 LEP_chen_yi: "Chen Yi"
 LEP_chen_yi_desc: "Like many among his generation of officers, Chen Yi graduated from the Rikugun Shikan Gakkō military academy in Japan. More unusually he has also served as the chairman of a bank. Chen joined Sun Chuanfang's Southern Zhili faction in 1924, and rose to prominence through his brutal suppression of Chinese Syndicalists in the Shanghai Uprising of 1932. As a reward for his unquestioning service he was appointed governor of Zhejiang Province, replacing Lu Xiangting.\nUnder his regime, Zhejiang might be considered the geographic and economic inverse of Jiangsu, with a small but wealthy north and desperately poor southern regions. Though Chen himself is not particularly susceptible to bribes, he routinely ignores his subordinate's abuses in order to quench dissent, and only a few regiments of soldiers could be considered truly loyal to his person despite his reputation as a harsh disciplinarian."

 #鄭俊彥
 LEP_zheng_junyan: "Zheng Junyan"
 LEP_zheng_junyan_desc: "As governor of Jiangsu, Zheng Junyan has built his stronghold in the city of Xuzhou, located at one of China's most crucial railway junctures, and far from Sun Chuanfang's seat of power in Nanjing. As a result of his positioning, he has managed to secure a fair amount of autonomy by playing Sun, Wu Peifu, and the Germans off of each other for safe and reliable access to the railroad. He also maintains a rivalry with Zhang Zongchang over control of the north-south line and is known to have sent a number of notices to Nanjing concerning a troubling spread of the Yiguandao faith. Under Zheng's rule Jiangsu is known as a province of contrasts, its poorest regions bordered by Shandong to the north, and some of China's wealthiest districts in its south along the banks of the Yangtze."

 #鄧如琢
 LEP_deng_ruzhou: "Deng Ruzuo"
 LEP_deng_ruzhou_desc: "Under Deng's regime, Jiangxi shares a number of traits with Anhui to its north, chief among them a predominantly poor and rural population. Much of the province has never truly recovered from the widespread destruction of the Taiping rebellion, and even after seventy years the ruins of abandoned cities can sometimes be glimpsed amid the mountains. Unlike Anhui Jiangxi has not quite escaped German attention. With virtually nonexistent infrastructure and few direct paths to the coast, the city of Nanchang and its surrounds are the planned terminus of the new Zhegan Railway, linking the city to Shanghai, opening up significant new markets and resources in the Chinese interior. Of particular interest to the Germans is the city of Jingdezhen, the porcelain from which has been able to fetch high prices in Berlin, along with other less-legitimate pursuits such as the stolen antiquities trade. So far, the new railway has been built primarily with German financing, though there are rumours that the Germans mean to purchase the railway in its entirety; rumours likely lending strength to the KMT's supporters hiding in the province's south."

 #周蔭人
 LEP_zhou_yinren: "Zhou Yinren"
 LEP_zhou_yinren_desc: "A long-standing subordinate to and former classmate of Sun Chuanfang, Zhou Yinren and the League-Marshal share a personal bond. Perhaps this is why Zhou was trusted with governorship of Fujian, the most mountainous and impoverished of the Eight Provinces. A narrow band of coastline constitutes the majority of the area under direct rule, and every port of Fujian shows a heavy German presence. Though generous aid from Nanjing has helped Zhou establish a greater degree of control over the province than he and his predecessors had last decade, much of it remains in a state of near-anarchy, and parts have fallen to an agrarian-socialist remnant of the KMT. These rebels, occasionally raiding the coastal settlements, have so far resisted two punitive expeditions aiming to dislodge them."

 #上官雲相
 LEP_shangguan_yunxiang: "Shangguan Yunxiang"
 LEP_shangguan_yunxiang_desc: "Although born into a moderately wealthy family, Shangguan Yunxiang spent his youth amid austerity as funds were split between his numerous siblings. After graduating from Baoding in 1919 he was sent to join Sun Chuanfang's Hubei Army, and by 1923 followed Sun into Fujian. Shangguan soon established a reputation for himself as a highly capable general.\nHis greatest achievement was the defeat of the NRA's 4th Army, which previously defeated Wu Peifu's army at Tingsi Bridge. Even today Sun Chuanfang considers this proof of his coalition's inherent superiority to Wu Peifu's directly controlled divisions."

 #周鳳岐
 LEP_zhou_fengqi: "Zhou Fengqi"
 LEP_zhou_fengqi_desc: "Zhou Fengqi began his career as a late-Qing confucian scholar, but turned against the ruling dynasty when he joined the anti-Qing Guangfuhui through Qiu Jin's introduction. He has consistently opposed central government overreach and supported the "Zhejiang Ruled by Zhejiang People" and "Independence of Ningbo" campaigns. After helping Sun Chuanfang take over Zhejiang, he secured a promotion to garrison commander of Nanjing.\nHe can be considered a loyalist of Sun Chuanfang's Nanjing faction, and joined the suppression of Syndicalists during the 1932 Shanghai Uprising."

 LEP_tang_enbo_desc: "Tang Enbo was sent to the Imperial Japanese Army Academy by Chen Yi in order to become a staff officer, and the two can be considered sponsor and protégé. At the Academy Tang focused intensely on infantry doctrine, and his resultant competence has earned him Sun Chuanfang's respect.\nNotably Tang prefers to direct his forces with the use of modern communications equipment instead of from the front."

 LEP_shi_yousan: "Shi Yousan"
 LEP_shi_yousan_desc: "Shi Yousan started his military career in 1908 under Wu Peifu's command, but in the tumult following the Xinhai Revolution he was left wandering Beijing. In 1912 he joined Feng Yuxiang's army and became a trusted subordinate. Not long after he deserted, persuaded to do so by Yan Xishan. He went on to serve in the National Revolutionary Army, but deserted there too amid the failure of the Northern Expedition. Subsequently he participated in the Fourth Zhili-Fengtian War, this time as a member of Feng Yuxiang's Guominjun, but again Feng's trust was misplaced. As soon as the Zhili Clique's victory became apparent he deserted as usual, and returned to Wu Peifu's forces again. However by this point his trend of disloyalty had become hard to ignore. Wu Peifu directed him to serve under Sun Chuanfang instead. Within the LEP, Shi Yousan has come to appreciate the personal benefits of working with German sponsorship, but who knows when he might desert again..."

 #楊樹莊
 LEP_yang_shuzhuang: "Yang Shuzhuang"
 LEP_yang_shuzhuang_bio: "Graduating from the eighth driving class of Huangpu Naval Academy in Guangdong, Yang Shuzhuang would see service in Xinhai as a torpedo captain. In 1917, Yang would be awarded the fourth-class Wenhu Medal, and in April, would be transferred to Captain of the \"Tongji\" ship, later being transferred to \"Ying Rui\" in 1920.\n\nIn 1921, the Fujian navy had become involved in the provincial power politics of the time, and whilst Yan Jingxiu was nominally commander of the training fleet, Yan Shuzhuang had the de-facto power within the navy. Being promoted to rear-admiral, he would seize territory in Fujian-Xiamen, and would eventually develop into a local warlord.\n\nSucceeding Du Xigui as commander-in-chief of the navy, Shuzhuang would preside over an emergency meeting of the Beiyang fleet following the declaration of the Northern Expedition. Considering defection, the Beiyang fleet ultimately remained resolute in supporting the Zhili clique.\n\nNow considered the chief of the Southern Zhili's naval arm, Yang enjoys immense influence within the Leage of Eight Provinces, and directly controls territory within Fujian, acting as the chief of the Fujian naval clique's influence within China."

### Ideas ###
 LEP_Conspicuous_Kleptocracy: "Conspicuous Kleptocracy"
 LEP_Conspicuous_Kleptocracy_desc: "Late last decade, Sun Chuanfang opened vast swaths of Eastern and Southern China to exclusive German economic exploitation. Soldiers and officials at almost every level, many already predisposed to corruption, have become complicit in everything from arms smuggling to the stolen antiquities trade. This reflects poorly on the League as a whole."

 LEP_Conspicuous_Kleptocracy_2_desc: "$LEP_Conspicuous_Kleptocracy_desc$"

 LEP_Provincial_Armies: "Provincial Armies"
 LEP_Provincial_Armies_desc: "The League is large, but its sizeable army is in fact a collection of semi-autonomous provincial forces united by their leaders' personal loyalties to Marshal Sun. This eases recruitment, but presents serious logistical and organisational handicaps."

 LEP_Nanking_Kommission: "The Nanking-Kommission"
 LEP_Nanking_Kommission_desc: "The Nanking-Kommission, advising the League's leadership on behalf of Berlin, includes an officer-corps intended to reorganise Chinese divisions along German lines. So far they have seen some success in equipping and training the Marshal's personal divisions, as well as imparting the Weltkrieg's lessons to their officers."

 LEP_Yangtze_Special_Taxes: "Yangtze Special Taxes"
 LEP_Yangtze_Special_Taxes_desc: "The meandering Yangtze River runs through the country's heart, bringing coastal commerce inland, and inland produce to the world market. Paired with China's largest industrial base toward the river's mouth, the Yangtze is a veritable river of gold, and the cities along its banks are common targets for extensive taxation."

 LEP_Low_Level_Unrest: "Sporadic Unrest"
 LEP_Low_Level_Unrest_desc: "The recently announced consolidation of the Central China Railway has triggered a series of street protests and other popular demonstrations across the League. Though there is talk of boycotts, unrest is nothing new, and is expected to fizzle out within a few weeks."

 LEP_Spreading_Unrest: "Spreading Unrest"
 LEP_Spreading_Unrest_Desc: "Instead of dying down, unrest has continued to spread, taking root in almost every major city across the League. So far, this still remains nothing unprecedented, and the government response will almost certainly be as it always has been; violent and resolute."

 LEP_Anti-Concessions_Movement: "The Anti-Concessions Movement"
 LEP_Anti-Concessions_Movement_desc: "The events surrounding the creation of the Central China Railway have led to a violent outburst of patriotic agitation, directed against governmental figures and foreigners alike, the sort of which hasn't been seen since the May Fourth Movement over a decade ago. This naturally plays into the hands of the Nanjing Clique's enemies."

 LEP_Rampant_Disorder: "Rampant Disorder"
 LEP_Rampant_Disorder_desc: "The rise of the Anti-Concessions Movement and the death of Sun Chuanfang has led to a new period of “Hunzhan” - confused or chaotic fighting, as general turns against general, soldier against soldier. The markets have collapsed, the police are overwhelmed, and chaos spreads in the streets, as seemingly the whole of society turns against itself. A great deal of blood may be spilled before any semblance of peace returns to Eastern China."

 #LEP_Continued_Disorder: "Continued Disorder"
 #LEP_Continued_Disorder_desc: "Marshal Qi Xieyuan has united the Five Provinces, proving that he does in fact rightfully rule over Eastern China. While this means that the situation of the Five Provinces will not worsen, it still has not fully recovered. Qi will have to continue to consolidate if he wishes for complete order to return."

 LEP_Disrupted_Industry: "Disrupted Industry"
 LEP_Disrupted_Industry_desc: "Recent events have heavily disrupted ordinary industrial operations. Many of our leading businesses fear for the worst."

 LEP_Crippled_Industry: "Crippled Industry"
 LEP_Crippled_Industry_desc: "With the general breakdown of order, our economic and military industry has ground to a halt. Our production capabilities are severely diminished as entire supply lines have broken down."

 LEP_Questionable_Authority: "Questionable Authority"
 LEP_Questionable_Authority_desc: "Qi Xieyuan claims he is Sun's rightful successor and has all rights to the title of League-Marshal, but not everyone agrees. Many governors and local governments are sceptical of his authority. His rule also barely extends outside the range of his military garrisons, making his authority over the League outright questionable."

 LEP_Damaged_Industry: "Damaged Industry"
 LEP_Damaged_Industry_desc: "Our military factories and civilian economy have been damaged significantly by the fighting. Supply chains are still in disarray and much of the machinery is broken. Until all this is restored, we will not have optimal industrial output."

 LEP_Widespread_Destruction: "Widespread Destruction"
 LEP_Widespread_Destruction_desc: "The war has had a permanent impact on the Five Provinces, which are now scattered with ruined buildings, dead bodies and broken infrastructure. Repairs and reconstruction will be the primary focus of most local governments, leaving us with much less industry for our own purposes."

 LEP_yiguandao: "Yiguandao Unrest"
 LEP_yiguandao_desc: "The general unrest in the north, combined with the civil war, has caused unrest under Yiguandao religious adherents to skyrocket. They are congregating en masse and are causing great chaos in our northern provinces. If we do not work to suppress them quickly, the disorder will only get worse."

 LEP_kuomintang: "KMT Unrest"
 LEP_kuomintang_desc: "While the Left KMT government has been finally broken as they poured all their remaining resources into the insurgence, many of the deserters and bandits who were once among their ranks continue to stir up trouble. Left KMT supporters will continue to cause trouble in the south if we do not mop up their final remaining hideouts."

 LEP_Chaotic_Order: "Chaotic Order"
 LEP_Chaotic_Order_desc: "While Qi is now unquestionably the League-Marshal, the lands he rules are still ripe with chaos and instability. A lot of work will be required to bind the Provinces back together into a cohesive League. Many local leaders still flagrantly disobey orders from Qi's Nanjing government and the roads remain unsafe and plagued by bandits."

 LEP_Coercive_Rule: "Coercive Rule"
 LEP_Coercive_Rule_desc: "The collapse of the League taught Qi Xieyuan one thing: Tolerate no opposition. League-Marshal Qi Xieyuan will not shy away from brazen abuse of power in order to achieve his goals. From now on, the League rules its citizens through coercion."

 LEP_Local_Development: "Local Development"
 LEP_Local_Development_desc: "Qi's government is unpopular in the cities, which has led him to look toward the interior and the small, local communities in which the vast majority of Chinese live. By helping them, and the local landowners, he hopes to win the support of rural China if the cities ever revolt."

 LEP_Kommission_Sponsorship: "Kommission Sponsorship"
 LEP_Kommission_Sponsorship_desc: "The League occupies a special position among Germany's Chinese partners. It allows significantly more freedom to German businesses, in exchange for special attention in its industrialisation. This special attention comes in the form of the Nanking-Kommission soliciting investments, research aid and more for the League."

 LEP_Extensive_Concessions: "Extensive Concessions"
 LEP_Extensive_Concessions_desc: "The special interest the League receives from Germany comes at a price, namely in the form of extensive concessions. These concessions are territorial, such as the coastal cities the AOG controls, but also legal. Some within the League are afraid that the next step will have a political dimension."

 LEP_Dishonest_Government: "Dishonest Government"
 LEP_Dishonest_Government_desc: "While the League presents itself as a moral and just government that safeguards the people of East China, in reality such goals are not among the government's priorities. The only thing that matters for Qi is the survival of himself and his power, and he is more than willing to achieve that through dishonest means."

 LEP_Coercive_Government: "Coercive Government"
 LEP_Coercive_Government_desc: "Through many years of hard work, Qi Xieyuan has re-engineered the League under his rule. He tolerates no dissent to his directives, does not shy away from dishonesty and is not afraid to abuse his power to achieve his goals. Under Qi, the League has become an oppressive place."

 LEP_Economic_Modernization: "Economic Modernisation"
 LEP_Economic_Modernization_desc: "Now that Qi has the League firmly under his control, his focus has shifted to the economy. With outside aid and by focusing on the heart of Chinese industry, located around Nanjing, it will be attempted to transform China into a modern economy."

### Focuses ###
 LEP_qi_rules_nanjing: "Qi Rules Nanjing"
 LEP_qi_rules_nanjing_desc: "Qi Xieyuan, a well respected general and controller of many of the troops around Nanjing, has seized control of the city. This makes him Sun's nominal successor. Qi now rules the Nanjing Clique. However, chaos reigns in what was previously the LEP and it is not certain that all the former LEP governors recognise Qi."

 LEP_north_south_west: "North, South or West"
 LEP_north_south_west_desc: "The Nanjing Clique has enemies in the north, the south and the west. Our territory is divided, with the Anqing Clique close to our heart. We must choose which enemies we will focus on first. We also need to reestablish contact with the former governors of the LEP provinces, in order to ensure their loyalties."

 LEP_jiangnan_loans: "Jiangnan Loans"
 LEP_jiangnan_loans_desc: "The AOG has been hit hard by Black Monday and has been unable to pay the rent on many of their concessions to us. This is unacceptable, but right now there is nothing we can do as we depend on their support. The Jiangnan Consortium has been somewhat isolated from the crisis and have offered us loans, which we should take in order to finance our armies and government."

 LEP_aog_gun_shipments: "AOG Gun Shipments"
 LEP_aog_gun_shipments_desc: "While the AOG does not yet have its finances under control, it has begun to stabilise somewhat. They have large amounts of guns available and we must make sure that these are sent to us, as we are dealing with serious gun shortages. Furthermore, our own production capacities are limited, making their support even more valuable."

 LEP_consolidate_the_heartland: "Consolidate the Heartland"
 LEP_consolidate_the_heartland_desc: "Now that we have begun to stabilise our situation, it is paramount we make a large effort to consolidate our heartland around Nanjing and the surrounding provinces. This will make sure we have a strong core area from which we can strike. However, if we make this effort before dealing with some other problems, it might not be as effective. We must find the right time in order to focus on consolidation."

 LEP_qis_central_command: "Qi's Central Command"
 LEP_qis_central_command_desc: "The disorganised, decentralised nature of the current governor armies on which we rely is not sufficient for the current conflict. We need to make an effort to establish a unified central command. The governors will retain their authority, but important decisions will now be made in coordination instead of separation."

 LEP_enforce_officer_loyalty: "Enforce Officer Loyalty"
 LEP_enforce_officer_loyalty_desc: "Our officers are all of dubious loyalty. We have a core force that has followed Qi for years, but now that we control much of Sun's former forces as well as the forces of the various provincial governors, we cannot be so sure. The KMT and Shanqing also continue to secretly recruit, so we must make sure our officers are loyal to the cause of the Nanjing Clique, and no other."

 LEP_emergency_industry_reallocation: "Emergency Industry Reallocation"
 LEP_emergency_industry_reallocation_desc: "Much of our limited industry is in disarray. We need to coordinate the industry we have available to focus on military production. As we do not have the resources for this ourselves, we must rely on the Jiangnan Consortium and AOG to help us with this effort. We will leave some assets under their management to ensure that our own incompetent officers will not cause problems."

 LEP_price_controls: "Price Controls"
 LEP_price_controls_desc: "With the collapse of the LEP, our bank notes have become nearly worthless and inflation is rising at a breakneck pace. While price controls are not an ideal solution, we must make sure there is at least a temporary stop to the devaluation in order to properly pay our soldiers. It will hopefully also calm the countryside and put a halt to rising food prices, at least for the time being."

 LEP_suppress_student_unions: "Suppress Student Associations"
 LEP_suppress_student_unions_desc: "The so-called 'patriotic' student associations have been a thorn in our side for a while now. They were the key force behind the anti-concessionist protests and continue to make trouble in the cities. If we shut down their means of organisation, we will hopefully suppress the movement as a whole."

 LEP_enforce_media_controls: "Enforce Media Controls"
 LEP_enforce_media_controls_desc: "The media are complicit in the collapse of the League and they continue to publish negative reports about our administration and continue to slander Qi's name. We must seize control of much of the media in order to put an end to the spread of dangerous information that could compromise our goals."

 LEP_government_by_coercion: "Government by Coercion"
 LEP_government_by_coercion_desc: "We now rule the League and we must, at all costs, prevent its renewed collapse. We will not make the same mistakes Sun Chuanfang made. Instead, we will build a strong government, based not on weakness, but on strength. We will not shy away from harsh methods in order guarantee its survival."

 LEP_finish_sun_investigation: "Finish the Sun Investigation"
 LEP_finish_sun_investigation_desc: "We have waited long enough to present the results of our investigation into the assassination of the former leader of the League, Sun Chuanfang. It is time to finish up the work and release the results to the public. Hopefully we can spin these results in such a way as to strengthen our position."

 LEP_undermine_sun_loyalists: "Purge the Complicit"
 LEP_undermine_sun_loyalists_desc: "Currently there are still many people in our government of which we cannot be sure that they will support us. Using our release of the results of the Sun assassination investigation, as well as by painting our enemies as complicit in the collapse, we should be able to make many arrests and purge our ranks of their presence."

 LEP_university_oversight_board: "University Oversight Board"
 LEP_university_oversight_board_desc: "We have seen how dangerous students can become if they organise. They were key players in the Anti-Concessionist Movement and will continue to be dangerous if we do not properly keep an eye on them. Therefore we must establish the University Oversight Board, which will make sure that any 'dangerous' individuals within universities are neutralised."

 lep_governor_1: "Now that we again control Zhejiang and Anhui, the governors of which both traitorously rose up against us, we must decide who to replace them with. We must make sure that they are our close allies and will not repeat the mistakes of their predecessors. Furthermore, we should also finish formalising relations with the other governors, not all of whom agree with Qi's ascension."
 lep_governor_2: "After the traitorous uprising of the Governor of Anhui, Chen Tiaoyuan, we now once again control his province. We must decide who replaces Chen as Governor of Anhui and make sure that our replacement does not repeat Chen's mistake. Furthermore, we should also finish formalising relations with the other governors, not all of whom agree with Qi's ascension."

 LEP_governor_question: "The Governor Question"
 LEP_governor_question_desc: "[getlepgovernor]"

 LEP_track_down_kmt: "Eradicate KMT Cells"
 LEP_track_down_kmt_desc: "While we might have driven KMT military units out of Fujian, partisans continue to operate within our territory. We also fear that some KMT members may have infiltrated our ranks. We must track down the remaining Kuomintang bases and eliminate the various active KMT cells."

 LEP_crack_down_yiguandao_sects: "Crack Down on Yiguandao Sects"
 LEP_crack_down_yiguandao_sects_desc: "Yiguandao adherents continue to terrorise our citizens. While we might have warded off Shanqing, many followers still stir up trouble. We must begin a large crackdown on various Yiguandao sects in order to cripple their movement."

 LEP_reconstitute_baojia_system: "Reconstitute Baojia System"
 LEP_reconstitute_baojia_system_desc: "The baojia system envisioned local control of local militias. It aimed to increase stability and assign local responsibility. While the system failed in the past, it can now be very useful as it allows us to effectively patrol the countryside and allows us to circumvent the governors."

 LEP_xiangyong_inspections: "Xiangyong Inspections"
 LEP_xiangyong_inspections_desc: "If we want the baojia system to become a success, we must ensure that the xiangyong, the local baojia units, behave nicely. Inspections will also allow us another method of control over these local militias without having to worry about the governors."

 LEP_water_infrastructure_commission: "Water Infrastructure Commission"
 LEP_water_infrastructure_commission_desc: "The war has damaged an enormous amount of critical infrastructure designed to protect our cities from the rivers. Dams, dykes, and levees have all been damaged. We need to set up a special commission with adequate funding to repair these immediately. If we wait, floods can potentially endanger millions of Chinese."

 LEP_peace_in_countryside: "Peace in the Countryside"
 LEP_peace_in_countryside_desc: "Now that we have dealt with the most seditious elements that started the war, we can begin the last efforts to fully restore peace to the countryside. For months now, people were afraid to go out and travel, as roads were infested with bandits and rebels. But with our measures and reforms, we have increased security and peace has returned to the countryside."

 LEP_selective_enforcement: "Selective Enforcement"
 LEP_selective_enforcement_desc: "It is not through the law that will achieve legitimacy as a government. We can only achieve this by building a stable government that is not questioned by the people. Therefore, we can afford to selectively apply the law as we see fit. By allowing certain companies and individuals extralegal rights, we can be sure of their support, as we will crack down hard on their enemies."

 LEP_reform_public_security: "Reform Public Security"
 LEP_reform_public_security_desc: "One of the problems Sun Chuanfang faced, was that he had no dependable network of agents that maintained security in his name. With Qi's Nanjing Guards, this will now change. With these reforms, Qi will have agents everywhere, which will allow him to react quicker and keep the peace."

 LEP_redoubts_for_revenue: "Redoubts for Revenue"
 LEP_redoubts_for_revenue_desc: "With the recent war still fresh in the minds of our governors, combined with the general instability beyond the borders, means that our governors will be very much occupied with security. We will offer them help in constructing fortifications and other defences, in exchange for them allowing Nanjing to raise additional taxes from their territory."

 LEP_tackle_local_corruption: "Tackle Local Corruption"
 LEP_tackle_local_corruption_desc: "Local corruption is a serious issue. It harms our ability to extract taxes from the local level of government, it takes an unnecessary toll on the local farmers and it fills the pockets of those who do not need it. For this reason, we should begin dealing with this issue. The inspectors we will use for this will also allow us greater control over local governments."

 LEP_green_gang_dealings: "Green Gang Dealings"
 LEP_green_gang_dealings_desc: "We must solicit the help of the Green Gang in Shanghai. These crime lords, major players in the drug trade, will allow us to exert influence on potential investors in the Legation Cities. Using the Green Gang, we will surely be able to expand our influence within the Legations."

 LEP_public_media_campaigns: "Public Media Campaigns"
 LEP_public_media_campaigns_desc: "Our government is viewed negatively by many. We are seen as the ones who sold out to the Germans and cracked down on the patriots who aimed to kick them out. We must ensure that this image disappears by using our control of the press to spread positive messages about our government, while spreading negative messages about our critics."

 LEP_appoint_civilian_magistrates: "Appoint Civilian Magistrates"
 LEP_appoint_civilian_magistrates_desc: "Many of the provinces and local governments are headed by military men, who depend on their armies for their political power. It is difficult to force them to do anything without fighting. Therefore, we should begin appointing civilian magistrates to positions in local governments and slowly allow them more power, as we can control them more effectively than military men."

 LEP_public_repression: "Public Repression"
 LEP_public_repression_desc: "We do not deceive ourselves by saying we are a friendly and free government. No, we admit that there is only one way to offer the people law and order, and that is through harsh repression of those who speak or act against us. Only if those seditious elements are eliminated, can the people be confident of their safety."

 LEP_shut_down_intellectual_circles: "Shut Down Intellectual Circles"
 LEP_shut_down_intellectual_circles_desc: "Various groups and circles of highly-respected intellectuals, many of whom supported the Anti-Concessions Movement that lead to the downfall of Sun Chuanfang, continue to speak out against us. We can no longer tolerate this insubordination and must act immediately by prohibiting the meetings of these intellectuals and making sure they remain isolated."

 LEP_crush_urban_unions: "Crush Urban Unions"
 LEP_crush_urban_unions_desc: "Just like the student associations, unions of urban workers have always caused problems. Their strikes undermine our industries and we can never be sure that they do not cooperate with the Left KMT. We must use our authority in the cities to crush these unions and make sure workers do not organise."

 LEP_pacification_commissioner_qi: "Pacification Commmissioner Qi"
 LEP_pacification_commissioner_qi_desc: "It is customary to give yourself many different positions and titles to create authority in new areas. Qi Xieyuan is therefore no longer just the League-Marshal, but also Pacification Commissioner. This new position gives him the authority to shut down any seditious act in any area of the League with his own forces, which will allow us to respond much faster in emergencies."

 LEP_pressure_jiangzhe_caifa: "Pressure the Jiangzhe Caifa"
 LEP_pressure_jiangzhe_caifa_desc: "The Jiangzhe caifa, meaning the Jiangsu and Zhejiang zaibatsu, is a group of powerful bankers who control the major banks in the Legations. Using our newly acquired connections, we should attempt to pressure the Jiangzhe caifa to provide us with loans and resources, like they have done to others in the past."

 LEP_solicit_legations_investments: "Solicit Legations Investments"
 LEP_solicit_legations_investments_desc: "The Legation Cities are a great source of wealth. Often now, foreign investors choose to invest in these cities and many rich Chinese move their businesses there. We must present ourselves as an attractive target for investment, something which, considering our new influence in the Legations and our open economy, should not be difficult."

 LEP_expand_jiangnan_arsenal: "Expand the Jiangnan Arsenal"
 LEP_expand_jiangnan_arsenal_desc: "The Jiangnan Arsenal is the linchpin of our military industry. As we further develop our general industry, a special effort to expand the Arsenal would be prudent, as it would allow us to further ramp up our domestic production of military hardware."

 LEP_lower_yangtze_development: "Lower Yangtze Development"
 LEP_lower_yangtze_development_desc: "The heart of the Five Provinces, and thus Qi's power base, lies in the Lower Yangtze region. Developing this area will lead to the greatest gains for Qi, as he effectively taxes and controls the area directly. Furthermore, it is located in a perfect position, which will surely attract much investment."

 LEP_eastern_railway_construction: "Eastern Railway Construction"
 LEP_eastern_railway_construction_desc: "Railways are the lifeblood of China. Without them, industrial transportation comes to a standstill. We must invest heavily in the construction of additional railways and in the renovation of existing ones. The Germans will most definitely want in on this, so we need to decide exactly how we will carry out these plans."

 LEP_heavy_industrial_investments: "Heavy Industrial Investments"
 LEP_heavy_industrial_investments_desc: "Currently, China's industry is mostly for its own consumption. Much of it is also only light industry, as we lack the capability and expertise to produce heavier industrial equipment. If we wish to advance our economy, this must change. With the help of German expertise and new government investments, we will make sure that heavy industry will also be developed in China."

 LEP_new_economic_development: "New Economic Development"
 LEP_new_economic_development_desc: "As the League stabilises and industrial development reaches new heights, we must make optimal use of this. With our opening to the rest of the world, we are in a unique position to develop at a faster pace than any other part of China. We must do all we can to invest in industrial development and the development of this new economy."

 LEP_subsidize_local_communities: "Subsidise Local Communities"
 LEP_subsidize_local_communities_desc: "We have lost support of much of the urban population. Eventually, if our economy develops enough, they will come around. But until that moment, we need the support of another portion of the population, the peasants. For this reason, we must introduce new subsidies for local communities, which will be specifically aimed at rural development. This should help secure their support."

 LEP_revitalize_the_tea_trade: "Revitalise the Tea Trade"
 LEP_revitalize_the_tea_trade_desc: "The tea trade used to be much more common in southern and eastern China. Furthermore, many of the Chinese peasants lack any kind of monetary income. If we revitalise the growing and selling of tea, we can provide them a new source of income. This will integrate them into the new, modern economy and should spur further growth and development."

 LEP_patronize_xiangshen: "Patronise the Xiangshen"
 LEP_patronize_xiangshen_desc: "The xiangshen, the local landowners, are incredibly valuable allies. If we can secure their support, we can also secure the support of the peasants. We should use our newly acquired control over local governments in their favour, which will show them that we are their strongest ally, not the provincial government. This will also provide us with additional leverage over our governors."

 LEP_modern_agriculture: "Modern Agriculture"
 LEP_modern_agriculture_desc: "While China was once renowned for its efficient farming methods, which in part helped develop our enormous population, we have long since lost that edge. We need to introduce modern methods from the West into our agriculture if we wish to ever escape the dire times of the past century. We can no longer afford to remain behind."

 LEP_cult_of_personality: "Cult of Personality"
 LEP_cult_of_personality_desc: "If Qi Xieyuan, our League-Marshal, wishes to truly entrench his power and influence, he must develop somewhat of a mythical persona. If he achieves an almost cultist following, no man will dare speak up against him. Therefore, we should publish various stories about his life, including his miraculous birth and his personal achievements during the war, such as the destruction of an enemy airplane with only his rifle."

 LEP_network_of_allegiances: "Network of Allegiances"
 LEP_network_of_allegiances_desc: "No man rules alone. For that reason, Qi must maintain a network of allies throughout the League. This network has to be carefully managed, lest it fall apart, which would be disastrous for Qi and the League."

 LEP_dubious_practices: "Dubious Practices"
 LEP_dubious_practices_desc: "If Qi wishes to remain in power, he must use any method as his disposal. While Sun Chuanfang often claimed a moral high ground, in reality most of his actions were guided by securing his leadership. Qi should do the same. In fact, with his tighter control, especially in Nanjing, and with support from the Germans, Qi can possibly afford even more."

 LEP_tsingtau_collaboration: "Tsingtau Collaboration"
 LEP_tsingtau_collaboration_desc: "Our greatest advantage over the other warlords, is that we have the full support of the Germans. Collaboration with the Germans allows us more rapid industrialisation, more advanced technology and more effective armies. We must safeguard this relationship at all costs."

 LEP_german_reconstruction_crews: "German Reconstruction Crews"
 LEP_german_reconstruction_crews_desc: "The League is damaged. The war saw destruction on an unprecedented scales, with thousands upon thousands of dead. Railways were destroyed, cities burned to the ground and factories torched. While the League possesses the manpower to begin reconstruction efforts, it lacks expertise and money. For this reason, specialised German crews should be invited to oversee reconstruction work in many places."

 LEP_krupp_industrial_methods: "Krupp Industrial Methods"
 LEP_krupp_industrial_methods_desc: "If China wishes to modernise, it needs to adopt the methods of those were successful. Krupp is one of the more powerful German conglomerates, active in both the Legations and the AOG. We should invite them to educate our engineers and entrepreneurs of how to develop new industry. We must make sure that China adopts German industrial methods, if we wish to have any chance at all in this world."

 LEP_german_research_aid: "German Research Aid"
 LEP_german_research_aid_desc: "German technology far exceeds our own. We could significantly ramp up our research capabilities if we would have access to cutting-edge German research. We must establish cooperation between universities and research groups in China and Germany."

 LEP_nanjing_university_expansion: "Nanjing University Expansion"
 LEP_nanjing_university_expansion_desc: "Nanjing University is small and underfunded and mostly provides antiquated forms of education. This must change if we want to advance our technological capabilities and innovation. We must expand Nanjing University and ensure a new generation of students will be educated with modern methods."

 LEP_westernized_school_curriculum: "Westernised School Curriculum"
 LEP_westernized_school_curriculum_desc: "Chinese education is backward and outdated. Not only our universities are antiquated, our school system in the smaller cities and towns is as well. Children are educated using useless facts and are in no way prepared for the real world. We must develop a standardised education curriculum based on what is taught in the West, which will hopefully help us advance our studies of modern technologies."

 LEP_deutsch_asiatische_loans: "Deutsch-Asiatische Loans"
 LEP_deutsch_asiatische_loans_desc: "Deutsch-Asiatische Bank has greatly expanded in the past years and has become a major vehicle for AOG and German investment in China. We are currently not utilising this as much as we could. The bank is internationally valued and trusted and could provide us with significant loans for industrial expansion and railway projects."

 LEP_opening_the_interior: "Opening the Interior"
 LEP_opening_the_interior_desc: "The interior has always remained relatively resilient to foreign influence. This has also meant that its many resources have gone mostly unused. We are sure that the Germans are extremely willing to tap into this potential source of resources and we should make an effort to open up the interior to German investments."

 LEP_improved_tungsten_extraction: "Improved Tungsten Extraction"
 LEP_improved_tungsten_extraction_desc: "There are several locations that currently produce tungsten and other valuable metals. We should cooperate with the Germans in improving extraction methods and significantly expand mining operations and production."

 LEP_schantung_eisenbahn_expansion: "Schantung-Eisenbahn Expansion"
 LEP_schantung_eisenbahn_expansion_desc: "The Schantung-Eisenbahn railway company has made plans for extensive railway renovations and expansions around our heartland. We should allow them to make their plans a reality. They will be an effective vehicle for railway development in the north, as having the AOG fund and control these railways directly would most likely not be well-received."

 LEP_eastern_resources_commission: "Eastern Resources Commission"
 LEP_eastern_resources_commission_desc: "China holds many resources. Too many, in fact, to just develop randomly. We should establish a joint Sino-German Eastern Resources Commission which will oversee the search and development for additional resources. It will have far-reaching authority and should significantly speed up the process, as currently the exploitation of our steel and coal develops at a much too slow pace."

 LEP_tolerate_vice: "Tolerate Vice"
 LEP_tolerate_vice_desc: "Gambling, prostitution and opium are all morally reprehensible. However, they are also extremely valuable sources of income. While we do not wish to indulge in it ourselves, these vices are too valuable to prohibit entirely. While we do not wish to make it publicly know we will be tolerating these vices, we can still implement certain 'taxes' if those who wish to exploit these vices wish us to look the other way."

 LEP_facilitate_german_prospecting: "Facilitate German Prospecting"
 LEP_facilitate_german_prospecting_desc: "With our interior more open to German investments, we should aid local governments by facilitating German efforts to prospect for additional resources. Especially our poorer inner provinces would be greatly benefited by the exploitation of additional resources."

 LEP_inland_development_zones: "Inland Development Zones"
 LEP_inland_development_zones_desc: "If we want to facilitate interior development in a way that does not impact China too negatively, we should introduce special 'Inland Development Zones'. These will be unburdened by local regulations and other measures local governments might think up to impede development. By concentrating the foreign presence in such a way, we can more easily protect them as well."

 LEP_special_road_taxes: "Special Transit Taxes"
 LEP_special_road_taxes_desc: "Implementing special transit taxes would allow us to raise additional revenue for our central government. We control many of the roads in the League and thus can use this privilege to raise money. Furthermore, the taxes allow us another way to give benefits to our supporters, as we can exclude them from the taxes."

 LEP_revenue_tax_stamps: "Revenue Tax Stamps"
 LEP_revenue_tax_stamps_desc: "If we wish to create a more modern and standardised system of tax collection, we should introduce a new system of special tax stamps that we can use to check if trade goods have fulfilled all the necessary requirements."

 LEP_friendly_monopolies: "Friendly Monopolies"
 LEP_friendly_monopolies_desc: "If we want to safeguard our regime, we must do good things for our allies and partners. By allowing certain businesses and groups to practically exercise free rein in certain sectors, we can be sure of their support. Furthermore, they will be much more likely to invest within our borders."

 LEP_five_provinces_one_marshal: "Five Provinces, One Marshal"
 LEP_five_provinces_one_marshal_desc: "The Five Provinces can now be truly declared to be simply under the rule of a single Marshal, Qi Xieyuan. After the chaos following the death of Sun, Qi re-engineered the League and united the Five Provinces under his rule. The Nanjing Clique rules the Five Provinces once more."

 LEP_nanjing_army: "Nanjing Army"
 LEP_nanjing_army_desc: "Our power derives from our military, which means it is vital to build a competent army. The armies of the former league were divided and weak. We must unify them and establish a strong Nanjing Army, with which we will achieve our goals."

 LEP_air_naval_command: "Air and Naval Command"
 LEP_air_naval_command_desc: "Previously, we have relied almost completely on the strength of our army. We must diversify our forces into the theatres of air and water. Our navy has always been weak and it is time to modernise it. We also need to take control of our skies if we want to prevent fire raining upon us when we meat more modern enemies."

 LEP_new_nanyang_fleet: "A New Nanyang Fleet"
 LEP_new_nanyang_fleet_desc: "One of the greatest fleets of China was the Nanyang Fleet, based in Shanghai. We will build a new Nanyang Fleet, this time based in Nanjing. It will make sure we can properly defend ourselves from all enemies coming from the seas."

 LEP_nanjing_naval_yard: "Nanjing Naval Yard"
 LEP_nanjing_naval_yard_desc: "It is time to begin investment into a new and expanded naval yard for our shipbuilding in Nanjing. It will be capable of assembling also the great ships of today and will be necessary if we wish to modernise our fleet."

 LEP_naval_officer_training: "Naval Officer Training"
 LEP_naval_officer_training_desc: "In order for our new fleets to operate in a modern way, we need well-trained naval officers. Without these, coordination will be lacking and any manoeuvrer will fail. We need to improve the training of our naval officers in order to tame these massive steel beasts of the seas."

 LEP_green_water_navy: "Green Water Navy"
 LEP_green_water_navy_desc: "We know that we cannot build a fleet that will project power in the oceans. We simply lack the technology and industry. Instead, we must protect our coasts and prevent any enemy from landing on our shores. We will therefore invest in the types of ships best suited for this purpose."

 LEP_nanjing_air_corps: "Nanjing Air Corps"
 LEP_nanjing_air_corps_desc: "We need a dedicated Air Corps if we wish to make a difference in the skies. This new corps will unify our various air units and allow us to complete the efforts required in order to modernise our ancient air force."

 LEP_expand_daijaochang_airbase: "Expand Dajiaochang Airbase"
 LEP_expand_daijaochang_airbase_desc: "The Dajiaochang Airbase is a prime location for new expansions. We will greatly expand its size so it can house far more planes than before. Dajiaochang will allow us to properly control the skies in a large radius."

 LEP_eastern_aviation_school: "Eastern Aviation School"
 LEP_eastern_aviation_school_desc: "In order for our Air Corps to function, we will need pilots. Experienced and well-trained pilots. Currently we lack the capability to train enough pilots and it is necessary to build a dedicated school to greatly increase the amount of graduate pilots to crew our planes."

 LEP_heinkel_airframes: "Heinkel Airframes"
 LEP_heinkel_airframes_desc: "Germany has an outstanding aircraft industry. If we wish to build a strong Air Corps, we need advanced and modern planes. The Germans know we will stand with them, so they must surely be willing to help bolster our new Air Corps with new Heinkel airframes."

 LEP_domestic_fighter_production: "Domestic Fighter Production"
 LEP_domestic_fighter_production_desc: "In order to truly achieve critical mass, we cannot fully rely on foreign assistance. We will need to establish reliable domestic fighter production in order to replenish our losses and further augment our air force."

 LEP_northern_school_doctrine: "Northern School Doctrine"
 LEP_northern_school_doctrine_desc: "We must adopt the modern war tactics of the North, which emphasises a superiority in equipment and artillery and better-prepared and trained divisions. It has been developed in practice by the warlords of the north, who often fought on the North China Plain."

 LEP_southern_school_doctrine: "Southern School Doctrine"
 LEP_southern_school_doctrine_desc: "We must adopt the modern war tactics of the South, which emphasises greater numbers and mobility. It has been developed in practice by the warlords of the south, who often fought in the mountains."

 LEP_raising_fallen_flags: "Raising Fallen Flags"
 LEP_raising_fallen_flags_desc: "In the last ten years, many elite Chinese divisions were disbanded or destroyed. In order to strengthen our forces, we can rally these old divisions and build our new forces around these cores. They will serve as a solid foundation on which we can readily expand."

 LEP_study_modern_doctrines: "Adapt Western Doctrines"
 LEP_study_modern_doctrines_desc: "We must extensively modern Western doctrines and adapt them for our own situation. Only if we truly know how to wage war, can we effectively compete with the rapidly modernising world."

 LEP_german_rifles: "German Rifles"
 LEP_german_rifles_desc: "German rifles have always been critical to any warlord army. Now that we have the support of the German government, we have direct access to their newest firearm technology. We must adopt their rifle standards and standardise our equipment across the board in order to increase the fighting power of our infantry."

 LEP_support_unit_training: "Support Unit Training"
 LEP_support_unit_training_desc: "In the modern day and age, it is no longer possible to survive with purely infantry. We must train units to take on specialised support tasks, such as engineering or support artillery in order to greatly increase the effectiveness of our divisions."

 LEP_krupp_artillery: "Krupp Artillery"
 LEP_krupp_artillery_desc: "Heavy artillery is rare in China. Now that we have direct access to the German war industry, we must make use of this opportunity and start the mass adoption of artillery within our forces. The Germans will surely help us modernise our forces."

 LEP_modernize_jinling_academy: "Modernise Jinling Academy"
 LEP_modernize_jinling_academy_desc: "The Jinling Academy in Nanjing is in heavy need of modernisation. Sun neglected to introduce modern strategy and tactics and many of its graduates know only how war was fought decades if not centuries ago. We must modernise the theories of the Academy and make sure that its graduates will be officers capable of operating in modern warfare."

 LEP_officer_initiative: "Officer Initiative"
 LEP_officer_initiative_desc: "We need our officers to be creative in the field. They need to adapt to the rapidly changing circumstances of the field and increase their chances of victory. This requires initiative. We need to train our officers to be forward-thinking. This does mean they sometimes must let go of how things were done in the past."

 LEP_unified_command_headquarters: "Unified Command Headquarters"
 LEP_unified_command_headquarters_desc: "While we established a temporary Central Command under Qi's authority during the civil war, establishing a unified command headquarters will help to further unify the divided forces of our governors. The unified headquarters will make sure decisions are made in coordination and under more direct control of Qi."

 LEP_german_instructors: "German Instructors"
 LEP_german_instructors_desc: "If we really want to adopt modern ways of warfare, we cannot do this alone. We must make use of the experience of men who have truly fought at the forefront of modern warfare and who know how advanced armies operate. We must invite German instructors to teach at the Jinling Academy and within our army."

 LEP_modern_officer_corps: "Modern Officer Corps"
 LEP_modern_officer_corps_desc: "We have improved the way of thinking of our officers and made sure that they are educated with modern strategy and tactics. We must make sure that our new officer corps is truly modern and continue to make sure it adopts all the requirements of a modern army."

Once they are in the field, they will learn as needed."

 #LEP_evaluate_doctrines: "Evaluate Doctrines"

 #LEP_hire_german_staff: "Hire German Staff"
 #LEP_hire_german_staff_desc: "There is a sizeable group of well-trained and experienced German officers living in the German concessions. We currently cannot afford to think too much about giving them too much power, because the current conflict is one of survival. We must recruit German staff into our armies and into our government in order to achieve the efficiency that they are famous for."

 #LEP_additional_concessions: "Additional Concessions"
 #LEP_additional_concessions_desc: "Our enemies threaten to topple our government. The Germans are our only hope of survival.

 #LEP_restore_production_aog: "Restore Production: Aid from the AOG"
 #LEP_restore_production_aog_desc: "We cannot afford to cut our budgets and redirect resources from other areas to fully restore production. We have made sure our German allies can continue to exert influence in China. They will surely aid us in keeping it that way."

 #LEP_keep_the_war_machine: "Keep the War Machine Going"
 #LEP_keep_the_war_machine_desc: "While we no longer have major conflict ahead of us, it is best to stay prepared and continue to keep our military production machine going.

 #LEP_return_to_peacetime_economy_desc: "The war is over and the countryside is in dire need of greater economic prosperity. We must return to a peacetime economy in order to focus on building civilian industry and grow our economy. We can always return to a more war-focused economy later."

 #LEP_fortify_heartland: "Fortify the Heartland"
 #LEP_fortify_heartland_desc: "To strengthen our position and authority, we must fortify our heartland around Nanjing.

 #LEP_provincial_questions_desc: "While we consolidated our rule over the provinces following the war, our influences is in many cases still limited due to the authority of the governors.

Years of peace have proven fertile ground for ambition, and with it jealousy. Although Nanjing and Beijing remain united against external foes, they have become competitors as much as allies.

 LEP_country_intro_header: "The Imperial Cornerstone"
 LEP_country_intro_content: "Forged amid last decade's wars, and expanded to its current size following the defeat of the Northern Expedition, §PSun Chuanfang's League§! is a loose confederation of §Pprovincial governments§! oriented around his stronghold in §gNanjing§!. Though united by its members' fear of central government control, the §PLeague§! is nonetheless a cornerstone of the §cEmpire§!, buttressing §gBeijing§! against both external threats and internal challengers by virtue of shared heritage.\n\nThis tenuous arrangement has brought years of peace, and with them relative prosperity. Foreign industrial methods have proven transformational, and §PSun's§! armies now include several §mGerman-trained§! and equipped divisions at their core. The §PLeague-Marshal§! has come to sit atop a vast bureaucratic pyramid, a position he is more than happy to keep, despite the cracks that have begun to appear at its base. §mGerman material aid§!, necessary to offset pressure from §cBeijing§! and the §PLeague's§! fractious southern members, has not served as a source of strength alone. §mGerman§! money trickles into every level of the §PLeague's§! hierarchy, feeding an already ingrained and unhealthy taste for corruption, with officials complicit in everything from embezzlement to the stolen antiquities trade.\n\nThis has gradually stoked the fires of §Ypopular discontent§!, increasingly harnessed by §Nnationalistic agitators§!, and fuelled by the elusive remnants of the §RKuomintang§!. For all §PSun's§! efforts to draw the fragmented §PLeague§! together, it may be drifting all the further apart. Still, these domestic squabbles are outshone by the §NRising Sun§!, which looms large in the east. Beset by internal conflicts, the §PLeague§! must rise to this challenge, or else risk annihilation.\n\nBriefings are available on the §PLeague's§! §Yspecial mechanics§!, its relationship with the §mGermans§!, and §ginternal politics§!."

 LEP_country_intro_header_1: "The §cCentral Government§!"
 LEP_country_intro_content_1: "Together with his old mentor §PWu Peifu§!, §PSun Chuanfang§! stopped the §RKuomintang's§! Northern Expedition in its tracks, and reversed the §gFengtian§! advance onto the Northern Plain. Together they came to control all of §lChina§! proper, but the peace that followed soon brought a new dilemma. Would §PSun§! continue to bow to his §Pold master§! in the North, and could §PWu§! permit his §Pold protege§! to disregard his authority?\n\nThe years since have seen both §PWu's§! §cBeijing Government§! and §PSun's League§! hold to an awkward status-quo, guaranteed by their shared enemies to the north and east; the §gFengtian Government§! and §NJapan§!. §PSun§! is free to do as he likes within the §PLeague§!, so long as he holds to ceremony and maintains the appearance of a unified country. Whether this can last remains to be seen."

 LEP_country_intro_header_2: "The §mGermans§!"
 LEP_country_intro_content_2: "§mGermany's§! significant role in the 1927 destruction of the Northern Expedition left §mBerlin§! with a great deal of leverage in §lChina§!, tempered only slightly by the §m1928 international Shanghai Conference§!, which claimed to give all nations equal access to the §lChinese§! market. In order to ensure a favourable position in spite of these 'restrictions', §mGerman§! officials proposed a series of agreements with §PLeague-Marshal Sun Chuanfang§! and our §Pconstituent governors§!. By sidestepping both §Pinternational agreements§! and §cBeijing's authority§!, §mGerman§! strength helps hold together the §PLeague§! and maintain autonomy from §PWu Peifu's Northern Zhili§!, in exchange for an ever increasing spread of §mGerman influence§!.\n\nThis arrangement has gradually lost its lustre. As §mGerman§! control grows and the people watch the fruits of their labour line the pockets of §Pgenerals§! and §mforeigners§! alike, many have come to question its necessity.\n\nThe nature of the §PLeague's§! relationship with §mGermany§! may need to be reconsidered going forward."

 LEP_country_intro_header_3: "Internal Vigilance"
 LEP_country_intro_content_3: "§mGerman influence§! and the somewhat decentralised nature of the §PLeague§! has often lead to localised unrest, and though this is often quickly dealt with, it can be seen as indicative of a greater malaise. The §PLeague§! is pestered by numerous subversive forces, and though they may be seen as no threat, they must not be allowed to escape control.\n\nA number of §RKuomintang§! holdouts, remnants of the failed Northern Expedition of 1926 and a second smaller uprising in 1932, remain just outside our reach in the mountains of §gFujian§! and the major coastal concessions. §NYiguandao§! adherents, committed to expunging §mforeign influence§! and returning §lChina§! to its long-held traditions, have been moving south from §PShandong§! and making inroads among the eastern provinces.

 lep.5.t: "The Sun Investigation"
 lep.5.d: "Following the assassination of Marshal Sun Chuanfang, chaos has continued to plague the League. Thousands have already died, and many more deaths will follow. Although there were many factors that led to this, the shooting of Sun was the nail in the coffin for the League of Eight Provinces.\n\nWith enemies on all sides, Qi has decided to start an investigation into his murder. Most do not believe this assassin was working alone, and people want answers. Some have suggested she was a Kuomintang agent, others believe she was part of the Yiguandao. Some think she was an agent of Chen, others argue she simply wanted revenge. Some even suggest that it was Qi himself who ordered the killing! An investigation must be started to find the answer.\n\nFor this investigation, there must of course be an investigator. Someone who will lead the case and will find the truth, or at least, whatever Qi needs the truth to be. There are four options for lead investigator. We could choose a man who was close and loyal to Sun, who will know him best and know where to look. However, he may not show Qi in the best light, as many loyal to Sun believe Qi was willing to push Sun aside a little too enthusiastically, and have suspicions of him. Another option is to choose someone loyal to Qi, who will make sure the results will not harm out administration, but some will not trust the results. Another option is to call in a German investigator, which will have far more credibility than one of ours. The final option is to choose someone from the Northern Zhili Clique, for they won't have many conflicting loyalties."
 lep.5.a: "The Qi loyalist will lead the investigation."
 lep.5.b: "Sun's friend will investigate."
 lep.5.c: "Ask for a German investigator."
 lep.5.e: "The Northern Zhili will investigate."

 lep.6.t: "A Sense of Direction"
 lep.6.d: "Although the investigation into Sun's death is independent from our government, it may be best to give the investigator our initial speculations and opinions on what occurred that day. This will assist the investigation, and allow us to keep some sort of control over its findings. The investigator may simply ignore our suggestion, but it may at least sway them slightly."
 lep.6.a: "An Yiguandao agent."
 lep.6.b: "A Kuomintang agent."
 lep.6.c: "A friend of Sun's."
 lep.6.e: "An agent of Chen's."
 lep.6.f: "The woman sought revenge."

 lep.7.t: "The Report is Almost Complete"
 lep.7.d: "Finally, after many weeks of investigation, the report on the Sun Investigation is almost complete. Although we gave an initial sense of direction, the investigation has stayed relatively independent of direct interference."
 lep.7.a: "Interesting..."

 lep.8.t: "The Yiguandao are guilty"
 lep.8.d: "The investigators have concluded that the Yiguandao are guilty of the assassination of Sun Chuanfang. According to the report, the woman who killed Sun was a devout member of the Yiguandao, who had lived in Shandong just a few years ago. She met with Zhang Tianran personally, whom sent her to Nanjing to act as a spy. As the AOG purchased the Zhegan Railway and unrest increased, Zhang Tianran saw it as the perfect opportunity to end Sun and collapse the league."
 lep.8.a: "Interesting..."

 lep.9.t: "The Kuomintang are guilty"
 lep.9.d: "The investigators have concluded that the Kuomintang are guilty of the assassination of Sun Chuanfang. According to the report, the woman who killed Sun was an avid member of the Kuomintang, who had worked in the undergrounds of Nanjing for years. She was in contact with Wang Jingwei, whom commanded her to act out the assassination after seeing the unrest caused after the AOG purchased the Zhegan Railway."
 lep.9.a: "Interesting..."

 lep.10.t: "Sun's associate is guilty"
 lep.10.d: "The investigators have concluded that Sun Chuanfang's assassination was organised by one of his close associates. According to the report, the woman who killed Sun was a spy for a friend of his, and had been working for him for years. Although he did not show it himself, Sun's friend was power hungry, and saw Sun as an obstacle that needed to be removed for him to move forward. Though the report does give a few suggestions as to who this man might be, including Chen Yi or Tang Enbo, it says it does not have enough evidence to make any conclusions of his exact identity."
 lep.10.a: "Interesting..."

 lep.11.t: "Chen is guilty"
 lep.11.d: "The investigators have concluded that Sun Chuanfang's assassination was organised by Chen Tiaoyuan. According to the report, the woman who killed Sun was a spy for Chen, and had been working for him for years. Chen had always been power hungry, and wished to see the downfall of the League. When the AOG purchased the Zhegan Railway, and unrest ensued, Chen saw it as his time to make his move, and roll the dice."
 lep.11.a: "Interesting..."

 lep.12.t: "The woman wanted revenge"
 lep.12.d: "The investigators have concluded that the woman who assassinated Sun Chuanfang was doing it out of revenge. According to the report, no real political connections were found with the woman, however, multiple people in her family were killed in wars led by Sun. The report concludes that the woman was thus acting for revenge for her family."
 lep.12.a: "Interesting..."

 lep.13.t: "The Germans are guilty!"
 lep.13.d: "The investigators have concluded that Sun Chuanfang's assassination was organised by the Germans! According to the report, the woman who killed Sun was working for the Germans in Nanjing as a political spy. The report then goes into what can only be described as a conspiracy theory, claiming Germany made the AOG purchase the Zhegan Railway to sow dissent, then commanded the lady to kill Sun. Apparently, the Germans feared that Sun was drifting away from the idea of using German concessions, and wanted someone more favourable to their interests.\n\nIf we released the report like this, it would alienate our German allies in the AOG."
 lep.13.a: "What..."

 lep.14.t: "Qi is guilty!"
 lep.14.d: "The investigators have concluded that Sun Chuanfang's assassination was organised by Qi Xieyuan! According to the report, the woman who killed Sun was a spy for Qi, and had been working for him for years. It claims that the great Qi was always power hungry, and always wanted the League-Marshal role for himself. After the AOG purchased the Zhegan Railways, apparently Qi saw his opportunity and had Sun killed, so he could take the leadership.\n\nObviously, this report is full of lies, and the investigators will likely never see the outside of a cell ever again. We cannot release the report like this."
 lep.14.a: "Lies!"

 lep.15.t: "Time to release the results"
 lep.15.d: "Finally, it is time to officially complete the Sun Investigation and release the results. However, with the report in our hands, it may be best if the results were changed a little more to our liking. We must make sure we control the narrative around Sun's death."
 lep.15.a: "We must stand by the results."
 lep.15.b: "It was the Yiguandao of course!"
 lep.15.c: "This must've been the Kuomintang."
 lep.15.e: "Chen must be at fault!"

 lep.16.a: "Finally, this can be put to rest."

 lep.17.t: "Qi's forces control Nanjing Arsenal"
 lep.17.d: "In the early hours of this morning, Qi's forces were able to fully capture the Arsenal in Nanjing. Following the death of Sun, and the 'coup' of Qi, Nanjing's forces were split between Sun loyalists and Qi loyalists. Many of these troops and their commanding officers still believe Qi is not fit to rule, with some even suggesting that Qi had Sun killed so he could take the role of League-Marshal for himself. Since Qi took power, fighting in Nanjing has been widespread, with Sun loyalists mainly being based around the arsenal in Nanjing. The arsenal is a very important military and logistical structure, allowing Sun's forces to hold it for days. However, with it finally now in our hands, our control in Nanjing is all but assured."
 lep.17.a: "Excellent."

 lep.18.t: "Rioters in Nanjing disperse"
 lep.18.d: "After our forces gained control of the Nanjing Arsenal, troops loyal to Sun mostly dissipated. However, many of the troops joined the rest of the citizens in Nanjing, who protested against Qi. Many wanted an end to the warlordism that has faced China for years. Many even feel that perhaps the Kuomintang might be a better option than Qi! Thankfully, with the arsenal in our hands, our troops had the weapons to easily disperse the crowds of protestors. The citizens have gone back into their homes as our troops march through the streets, and Nanjing is ours."
 lep.18.a: "Nanjing is ours."

 lep.19.t: "North, South, or West?"
 lep.19.d: "With the way the war is currently going, it is clear we must choose to focus on one of our targets first, so that our troops are not as spread out as currently."
 lep.19.a: "North to Shandong!"
 lep.19.b: "South to the Kuomintang!"
 lep.19.c: "West to the traitor Chen!"

 lep.20.t: "Disloyal Officers purged"
 lep.20.d: "With the betrayal of Chen Tiaoyuan, it has become clear that many of the ranked officers are in fact not loyal to Nanjing at all, but rather hold their own loyalties. How is our military supposed to function when the officers serving do not hold absolute loyalty to Qi Xieyuan and Nanjing? To solve this, over the last few days, a massive purge has occurred across our whole officer staff. This work has been carried out by the Military Loyalty Committee, a body investigators who review all of our officers' histories and past ties, and questioned many who were in Nanjing. The Military Loyalty Committee ordered the arrest of many officers, who were found to have links to the Kuomintang, Yiguandao, or some military warlord. All of the treacherous officers have either been imprisoned indefinitely, or have already been taken care of."
 lep.20.a: "Excellent."

 lep.21.t: "Newspaper writers arrested"
 lep.21.d: "Just this morning, multiple groups of military police raided multiple newspaper offices, and have arrested hundreds of writers, editors and company owners. It is clear that the newspapers were complicit in the collapse of the League of Eight Provinces, and though we are faced by many enemies, they continue to write lies and slander against League-Marshal Qi, ironically even blaming him for the League's collapse. However, it cannot be ignored how much potential these newspapers have for propaganda. Therefore, new writers and editors have been offered to the newspaper companies, who have already been checked to make sure they will remain loyal and will write in favour of Nanjing."
 lep.21.a: "Treachery must be punished."

 lep.22.t: "Purge the Complicit"
 lep.22.d: "Now that Marshal Qi's power has been secured against enemies from the outside, we must make sure we are secure internally. Many people throughout the population, from the peasant class all the way to the highest officers, were complicit in the collapse of the League of Eight Provinces. Therefore, the only answer is to purge the complicit. In doing this we must focus on one of the main groups currently opposing us. The young students of China are where dissent and rebellion spread. The Kuomintang and the Yiguandao remain in secrecy, and must still be destroyed. Even Sun Chuanfang's old friends and associates have shown they are not to be trusted."
 lep.22.a: "Dissent spreads between the students."
 lep.22.b: "We must destroy the Kuomintang from the core."
 lep.22.c: "The Yiguandao are the true threats to the peace."
 lep.22.e: "Sun is gone, his friends must go too."

 lep.23.t: "How harsh shall we be?"
 lep.23.d: "Before we execute the purge of the complicit, we must choose how brutal we are going to be to those who are arrested. In this group will be criminals and rebels who, given the chance, will bring about the end of stability and society as we know it."
 lep.23.a: "Exile or a prison cell for traitors."
 lep.23.b: "Execution will be necessary."

 lep.24.t: "Purge of the Complicit"
 lep.24.d: "After many days of investigations, police raids, and even some military shootouts, the purge of the complicit has taken place. Qi's power becomes more and more secure by the day."
 lep.24.a: "Excellent."

 #lep.25.t: "Eradicate KMT Cells"
 #lep.25.d: "It is time now to destroy the last Kuomintang cells in our nation. We had previously received the location of the main Kuomintang cell in the south after torturing a KMT officer. After finding this information, a small force of military police and infantry units was organised in Longyan, led by Li Shengchun, which then moved south to the location given. There, in the mountains a few miles from Longyan, scouts found the massive Kuomintang base. After surrounding the compound, Li moved in all units, and were faced with little resistance. After arresting and interrogating multiple KMT members at the base, it became clear that all the soldiers and military leaders had already escaped, apparently planning on going into hiding again in the North of Vietnam. After all the KMT members were arrested or killed, any documents inside were seized and the base was burned to the ground. With this main headquarters of the Kuomintang now in ashes, the Kuomintang itself has been pushed back years in organisation."
 #lep.25.a: "Socialism shall never live in China."

 #lep.26.t: "Crack Down on Yiguandao Sects"
 #lep.26.d: "Throughout our territory, the Yiguandao still has millions of followers. These cultists regularly harass and attack innocent civilians, and destroy infrastructure. If we are to end their terrorism, we must strike at their core: the large Yiguandao Sects, from which everything is organised. Therefore, military police have been sent into all the major Yiguandao monasteries, who have arrested the heads of these monasteries. These religious leaders have been executed and replaced with new leaders, who hold a far more favourable opinion of Qi Xieyuan, with some even declaring Qi the true Master of the Yiguandao."
 #lep.26.a: "They won't be a problem anymore."

 lep.27.t: "Talks with Du Yuesheng"
 lep.27.d: "After weeks of arrangements, Du Yuesheng, a main leader of the criminal gang in Shanghai, the Green Gang, recently met with Qi Xieyuan and a few other high level officers. Talks went on for hours, in a quiet hall in a small street in Wuxi. Only minimal guards were present, and most high level officials didn't even know of the meeting. At the end of the talks, the result is a plan they unofficially titled \"The Du Nanjing Scheme\". Through this plan, Du will use his high level and shady business connections to funnel more capital through Nanjing, and will help keep Qi supplied with weapons through backroom dealings. To pay for this, Nanjing will pay Du directly, with the agreement that 40% of this money will be used in pushing pro-Chinese business in the Legation Cities. Hands were shaken, witnesses were dealt with, and payments were made."
 lep.27.a: "A profitable arrangement."

 lep.28.t: "Influence from Nanjing"
 lep.28.d: "We have began to notice that multiple major businessmen, most of whom have links to the Green Gang, have began favouring investments in Nanjing. It is quite clear that these businesses are being bribed to favour Nanjing. At the same time, many Chinese businesses have made better than expected profits, showing possible sneaky investments from Nanjing itself."
 lep.28.a: "Interesting."

 lep.29.t: "Green Gang Develop in Nanjing"
 lep.29.d: "The Green Gang has always remained an organisation primarily based in Shanghai. Though they have a few dealings in the other Legations, Shanghai is the main hub of the gang. However, with the recent agreements made between Du Yuesheng and Qi Xieyuan, the Green Gang has began to develop in Nanjing. Though the Nanjing police would normally step in to try to curb illegal gang growth, it seems the Nanjing police commissioner has stopped this from occurring, stating the police should focus on beating \"enemies of the state\". Many assume that he was paid off by the Green Gang. However, the truth of the matter is that the Green Gang themselves never bribed the police commissioner. Perhaps the fact that Qi recently had the police commissioner replaced with his personal choice might have some relevance..."
 lep.29.a: "Welcome to Nanjing!"

 lep.30.t: "Anti-Qi activist groups grows in popularity in Nanjing"
 lep.30.d: "In Nanjing, tensions are growing once more. Due to the rise of multiple anti-Qi activist groups, violence is beginning to erupt once more, with police clashing with anti-Qi protestors. Qi Xieyuan has made no public comment on the rise of violence in Nanjing, though there are rumours he has plans to deal with it properly."
 lep.30.a: "This violence must end."

 lep.31.t: "Anti-Qi activist leaders found dead in Nanjing!"
 lep.31.d: "13 high level members of the anti-Qi groups in Nanjing were found dead today in a warehouse. 5 were shot, 6 stabbed and the other two were beaten to death with blunt objects. Later on that day, another 2 bodies were found dumped on the street in the slums of Nanjing. These other deaths have been identified as more high level anti-Qi activists. They were also beaten to death, and rope marks on their hands and the extent of the beating implies that they were tortured before death. 8 men were arrested in suspicion of committing the crimes, all members of the Green Gang in Nanjing. However, they only sat in a cell for 5 hours, as Qi quickly informed the Nanjing police commissioner that the prisoners should be released immediately, as they are not connected to the murders at all. Qi himself announced that he would form a team to investigate these deaths, however, progress on this is very unlikely. With these activists' deaths, the anti-Qi protests in Nanjing have dispursed, and the city is safe once again."
 lep.31.a: "Perfect."

 lep.32.t: "Business Investments from the Legations"
 lep.32.d: "After working out some deals with Du Yuesheng months ago, and not seeing any benefit of our money, has had some in our administration worried that we may have been scammed. However, recently the amount of investments from Legations businessmen in Nanjing has increased massively, opening new factories and boosting production."
 lep.32.a: "Cheers Du!"

 lep.41.t: "Soldiers Ambushed"
 lep.41.d: "While on a regular patrol today, a group of soldiers were ambushed by a band of Kuomintang guerrillas near [getlepattacklocationkmt], who quickly overpowered them and killed them. Further war parties have been sent out to track them down, with little success."
 lep.41.a: "Damn"

 lep.42.t: "Train Bombed in [getlepattacklocationkmt]"
 lep.42.d: "Apparently, while a local train in [getlepattacklocationkmt] stopped to on-board supplies for the nearby market town, KMT agents snuck up to the train, and placed several bombs beneath it. When they detonated, they completely destroyed the train, all the supplies, as well as a section of the narrow-gauge railway it was on. The ensuing landslide will make repairing the route a very costly endeavour indeed. These terrorists have still not been tracked down, most likely having taken refuge in some of the peasants' houses."
 lep.42.a: "When will it end?"

 lep.43.t: "Officers Assassinated in [getlepattacklocationkmt]"
 lep.43.d: "Tensions remain high in the South, as we are forced to send more and more troops and military police over to keep the region secure. During some training of new military police in [getlepattacklocationkmt], multiple Kuomintang agents infiltrated the barracks and shot multiple officers before being killed by the training troops. Following the death of those agents, multiple small bombs went off around the barracks, injuring three and costing lots to repair."
 lep.43.a: "Damn them"

 lep.44.t: "Factory Bombed in [getlepattacklocationkmt]"
 lep.44.d: "Even though the factory in [getlepattacklocationkmt] was thought to be secure, it still fell victim to Kuomintang agents. Just around midnight, suddenly explosions echoed throughout the area, as a bomb were set off in the industrial district, damaging a factory. This is sure to be bad for business."
 lep.44.a: "Damn them"

 lep.45.t: "Gunfight in [getlepattacklocationcitykmt]"
 lep.45.d: "Since the defeat of Chairman Wang Jingwei, tensions have remained high in [getlepattacklocationcitykmt]. The military presence and Kuomintang sympathies have remained very high. It was bound to boil over eventually, as it has today. A man, dressed as a regular peasant, was walking past a group of soldiers, when suddenly he drew a pistol and began to shoot at them. Though that man was killed quickly by the troops, it was in fact a distraction, as while the man was being killed, a large group of Kuomintang troops charged at the soldiers from the other side, and shot them all. As the day went on, more loyal soldiers joined the fighting, but were countered by more Kuomintang attacks. Dozens, maybe hundreds were killed, but thankfully, by the evening, the fighting had dwindled, and order was secured."
 lep.45.a: "I'm sure it won't be the last"

 lep.46.t: "Heavy Factory Bombing in [getlepattacklocationkmt]"
 lep.46.d: "Though the KMT have been defeated on the field, their terror campaign rages on. Today, multiple bombs were set off in [getlepattacklocationkmt], centred around the main industrial complexes. Though there were no casualties, the factory has been very badly damaged, and will be unable to work for a while. From what the Kuomintang have said, we should probably get used to events like this, until we have rooted them out for good."
 lep.46.a: "Damn them"

 lep.47.t: "Battle in [getlepattacklocationcitykmt]"
 lep.47.d: "[getlepattacklocationcitykmt], still a hotbed of Kuomintang activities, has faced a massive confrontation by the KMT. Around 400 Kuomintang troops went into the main square of the city, killed any police and soldiers in it, and quickly entrenched themselves with hastily put together fortifications. It took multiple pushes from hundreds of our own troops to be able to get back into the square and clear it of their guerrillas, who quickly retreated back into the back streets, eventually harboured in the homes of many of the peasants living there. However, the officer leading the attack decided that these KMT must be rooted out of [getlepattacklocationcitykmt], and so sent out around 200 soldiers on a killing spree throughout the city. Hundreds of civilians were lined up and shot, and the houses of many were burned to the ground. When Qi heard of what some are calling the [getlepattacklocationcitykmt] Massacre, he had the officer arrested, but that was too little, too late."
 lep.47.a: "The Quanzhou Massacre was the KMT's fault"

 lep.48.t: "Mountain Ambushes in the South"
 lep.48.d: "Over the past several weeks, a significant number of patrols, wagon trains, and other necessary activities in the former Jiangnan Insurgent Zone have come under attack from mountain ambushers. Firing from the heights only to disappear minutes later, the KMT bandits have left only death and destruction in their wake. So serious is the problem that many local people now refuse to provide their services in moving goods through these areas, no matter how much they are paid.\n\nOfficials in the region have assured us that this problem will be dealt with in short order, no doubt by press-ganging civilians and doubling patrols. Unfortunately, it will take more than doubled patrols to truly cure this Kuomintang disease of the heart."
 lep.48.a: "They must be dealt with"

 lep.49.t: "Multiple Factory Bombings"
 lep.49.d: "In the very early morning, multiple factories were bombed across the south in our country. The attacks were obviously coordinated closely and can have only come from the KMT. However, this time, there were already many workers present and dozens have been killed. This has been among the most brutal attacks the KMT have perpetrated."
 lep.49.a: "This must end immediately"

 lep.50.t: "KMT Headquarters Encirclement"
 lep.50.d: "Months of tracking KMT activities, months of frustrating their efforts and months of planning have finally paid off. The new headquarters of the few terrorists that remained after Wang Jingwei's defeat has been located and completely razed to the ground. Now that we have worked against them for so long, their resources are completely exhausted and we can finally call the movement of the Left KMT destroyed. Their traitorous rebellion is no more."
 lep.50.a: "Finally"

 lep.51.t: "Opium Storage Warehouse in Xuzhou Destroyed"
 lep.51.d: "Yiguandao followers, who are weirdly upset over opium use in Shandong and Jiangsu, have attacked and destroyed an illegal opium storage warehouse in Xuzhou. While having less opium isn't necessarily bad, they also killed everyone nearby. When soldiers arrived, they then continued to resist. We cannot let the Yiguandao religion continue to exist, as its followers cause too much chaos."
 lep.51.a: "Barbarians"

 lep.52.t: "Assault on Merchant Caravan in the North"
 lep.52.d: "Yiguandao adherents have robbed a merchant caravan and killed dozens that were travelling along with the caravan train. Again, this shows the kind of violence and brutality adherents of that crazy religion are capable of. We must root out the strange delusions of these people or things will get worse."
 lep.52.a: "Disgusting"

 lep.53.t: "Soldiers attacked in Northern Village"
 lep.53.d: "Soldiers on patrol in a northern village were attacked out of nowhere by a large band of dozens of homeless Yiguandao followers. These people, whose association with their religion has caused them to already lose everything, reverted to robbing and looting, which had caused the village to institute a patrol. But still the village wasn't safe, as nearly twenty have now been killed."
 lep.53.a: "Those rats"

 lep.54.t: "Town Invaded by Yiguandao Adherents"
 lep.54.d: "Again the Yiguandao have caused massive chaos by invading and occupying an entire town. After the Yiguandao expelled all the former owners, soldiers were sent out to investigate, only for them to see the entire town barricaded. A large amount of soldiers were required to drive away the Yiguandao adherents before the village people could return home. Hundreds of Yiguandao were killed, and many soldiers too. Things are getting too crazy."
 lep.54.a: "That is bad"

 lep.55.t: "Yiguandao Fanatics Take Over Military Barracks"
 lep.55.d: "In response to recent military actions against the Yiguandao, they have no chosen to attack and take over a military complex at the edge of a city in Jiangsu. Hundreds swarmed the barracks, killing many soldiers, after which barricaded themselves within. Soon, the city fell into chaos as looting became widespread. There are even reports of rapes. The military action required to take back the barracks was brutal, leaving nearly a hundred dead."
 lep.55.a: "Things are getting worse"

 lep.56.t: "Railway Occupied in Jiangsu"
 lep.56.d: "Today, the Yiguandao barricaded and occupied stretches of railway outside the crucial rail junction at Xuzhou, even destroying it at some parts. The action required to take it back left many dead. While they mostly left infrastructure alone in t he past, now they have begun to attack the lifeblood of our country, on which much of our economy rests. The Yiguandao have proven to be a major threat."
 lep.56.a: "Our railroads must be protected"

 lep.57.t: "Massacre of Yiguandao Followers"
 lep.57.d: "A stand-off between Yiguandao adherents and soldiers in a Yiguandao camp has escalated into a massacre. After the religious fanatics refused to leave, which they had been ordered by the soldiers as they were harassing nearby city folk, the soldiers began doing this by force. This lead to a counter-attack, which made the officer in charger decide to begin shooting. However, the shooting didn't stop until their was not a single Yiguandao follower left. Nearly a thousand are dead. While Qi Xieyuan has fired the officer for this excessive use of force, Yiguandao unrest is likely to only get worse."
 lep.57.a: "This doesn't look good"

 lep.58.t: "End of the Yiguandao"
 lep.58.d: "The Yiguandao threat can finally said to be neutralised as the last sect was destroyed, its members thrown into jail. It took a lot of policies and military action, but now the northern countryside can finally be declared safe again. The damage that the rotten religion of the Yiguandao did to our country will long live in infamy. But now they are gone and we won't let them come back."
 lep.58.a: "Finally peace"

 lep.59.t: "Qi Meets with Jiangzhe Caifa"
 lep.59.d: "Compared to the shady low down meeting with Du Yuesheng, Qi's meeting with the bankers of the Jiangzhe Caifa was a breath of fresh air. Meeting in one of the bankers' mansions in Shanghai, Qi and a few of his officers were treated to delicious food served by the bankers' maids and servants. Armed mercenaries stood guard around the building while the bankers arrived. Preliminary discussions were nice and calm, however the attitude changed when the group got to business.\n\nLeague-Marshal Qi made his stance clear: for the Jiangzhe Caifa to continue to do as much business as they do throughout the League, they must offer Nanjing resources and loans to be used \"to protect their business interests for them\". Of course, the bankers did not react well to this, claiming that they could protect their own financial institutions, and anyway, their profits from the League were minor compared to the profits they've found in the Legation Cities. Qi was ready for this line though, as he stated clearly that should they not give these resources to Nanjing \"the Green Gang will make sure you never do business in Shanghai ever again\". Several of the men were shocked at what they heard. Perhaps Qi had made a mistake. It was an open fact that many of these bankers were also paying off the Green Gang, and most likely have better relations with their leaders than Qi, who has only met Du Yuesheng once.\n\nAs the bankers began to discuss the resources to be sent to Nanjing, though, a wave of relief flowed through Qi. After another couple of hours of discussion it was decided, and the loans and resources will start coming in soon."
 lep.59.a: "What a fine businessman Qi is."

 lep.60.t: "Supplies from the Jiangzhe Caifa"
 lep.60.d: "Finally, we have received a large shipment of money and weapons, sent from the Jiangzhe Caifa in Shanghai."
 lep.60.a: "Wonderful."

 lep.100.t: "Nanjing Lives On"
 lep.100.d: "After many months of fighting, we have finally been able to crush the enemies that oppose us. Traitors, Kuomintang and Yiguandao, all have been crushed by the iron fist of Qi Xieyuan. However, his leadership is still not secure. Though the Kuomintang have been beaten in the field, reports have come back stating they will continue to fight a guerrilla war against us. The Yiguandao seem to have issued a similar statement. Also, as proven by Chen's betrayal, even those who claim to be loyal to us may be waiting to betray us. We must remain diligent."
 lep.100.a: "Ah, victory."

 lep.102.t: "The Governor Question"
 lep.102.d_1: "League-Marshal Qi never trusted Chen Tiaoyuan. He was anti-German, refusing to see the benefit from our European friends, and his loyalty shifted many times, most often between Sun Chuanfang and the Fengtian Clique in Manchuria. It was no surprise, then, when Chen rose up against the League, and brought it to the edge of ruin. It is clear that, due to his anti-German policies, his province of Anhui is in severe need of investment and development. Therefore, the question of who shall become the next governor of Anhui is paramount.\n\nReally, there are two main options. The first is Xie Hongxun, a relatively minor military officer and bureaucrat in Nanjing. However, his main appeal as governor is the relatively close relationship he had to Sun Chuanfang. Many still see Qi as a usurper, so placing a Sun loyalist to such a high level position would be a popular move, and he is weak enough that he will be easy to control.\n\nHowever, there is a second option. With the problem all starting from Anhui's breakaway, perhaps it is time to centralise the League slightly more. League-Marshal Qi Xieyuan is always an option, so that Anhui can be kept on a closer leash to Nanjing, though it might not be that popular with the population at large."

The second is Shangguan Yunxiang, a general with a reputation of being highly capable. During Chen's rebellion, his loyalty was bought with the promise of governorship over Anhui and Hangzhou. While he would be harder to control, keeping this promise will ensure his continued loyalty.\n\nHowever, there is a third option. With the problem all starting from Anhui's breakaway, perhaps it is time to centralise the League slightly more. League-Marshal Qi Xieyuan is always an option, so that Anhui can be kept on a closer leash to Nanjing, though it might not be that popular with the population at large."
 lep.102.a: "Xie Hongxun will do."
 lep.102.b: "Qi extends his power."
 lep.102.c: "Shangguan Yunxiang has proven his loyalty."

 lep.111.t: "Return of Alexander von Falkenhausen"
 lep.111.d: "After working in Nanjing for the regime of Qi Xieyuan, Alexander von Falkenhausen has returned to work with us."
 lep.111.a: "Excellent."

 lep.112.t: "Support our Chinese friends?"
 lep.112.d: "For many years we have greatly profited from the situation in China. Though we worked with the Qing, most German deals were done through their more receptive southern counterpart: Sun Chuanfang's League of Eight Provinces. However, the situation in the League is clearly unstable, and to make matters worse Sun himself has been shot. Thankfully, his replacement in Nanjing, Qi Xieyuan, is likely to become even more reliant on us than Sun was. The admiralty is recommending that we send him equipment immediately, to prop him up amidst what appears to be a rapidly worsening crisis in eastern China."
 lep.112.a: "Send them guns."
 lep.112.b: "We have better things to be doing."

 lep.113.t: "Arrival of German Weapons"
 lep.113.d: "Recently, we have received a shipment of infantry equipment in Nanjing, sent straight from our German friends in Singapore. No doubt they understand we must keep the peace across the League, for the prosperity of both of us."
 lep.113.a: "Excellent."

 lep.114.t: "New Governor for Zhejiang"
 lep.114.d: "With both Shangguan Yunxiang and Chen Yi both no longer governors of Zhejiang, a new governor is needed to replace them. There are three main candidates:\n\nFirst is Zhou Fengqi, garrison commander in Nanjing and Sun Chuanfang loyalist. Though he is not truly loyal to our regime, perhaps such a promotion might convince him to stay in line.\n\nSecond is Zhang Qingxu, a low level bureaucrat originally from Beijing, who joined Sun's government only a few months before his assassination. Though he is relatively minor, his organisational skill is notable, and the skills he got from working in Beijing will help him develop the province.\n\nThird is Xia Chao, a minor commander with no real notable victories to his name. Really, he has one main positive, that being his loyalty to League-Marshal Qi. Having worked under Qi for years, he might be the best choice if we want to keep Zhejiang closely linked to Nanjing."
 lep.114.a: "Zhou Fengqi."
 lep.114.b: "Zhang Qingxu."
 lep.114.c: "Xia Chao."

 lep.115.t: "Governor for Fujian"
 lep.115.d: "Throughout the League War, Fujian was ruled by Zhou Yinren. Zhou, a competent general, over the years has brought a level of control to Fujian that was not achieved by governors of previous decades. However, Zhou has one main negative, that being his extreme loyalty to the previous League-Marshal Sun Chuangfang. Having been classmates many years ago, their relationship was always a close one. It was this friendship that got Zhou to his position, not any sign of impressive skill or ability. Though Fujian has developed decently under Zhou, it still remains the most impoverished province in the League. We must make the choice of whether to keep Zhou, or whether to put in someone new.\n\nThe other option for governor of Fujian is Kong Zhaotong, a relatively minor military leader from Fujian. However, Kong's main appeal is his close relationship to Qi Xieyuan, with Kong acting as one of Qi's commanders directly in Fujian. Kong showed decent ability while fighting the Kuomintang, and his anti-socialist credentials are up to standard. His close links to Qi means he must be far more competent than the Sun loyalist Zhou. However, perhaps experience is better than loyalty..."
 lep.115.a: "Zhou Yinren will remain governor."
 lep.115.b: "Governor Kong has a nice ring to it."

 lep.116.t: "Governor for Jiangxi"
 lep.116.d: "With Governor Deng Ruzhou dying during the fighting of the League War, we are left with no choice but to replace him. For his replacement, there is only one option. Fang Benren, after graduating from Beijing Military Academy, worked in the Guangdong army, eventually as its commander-in-chief, then eventually as a high level commander and general in the League army. Having had strong links to Sun Chuangfang, and a suspicion of Northern Zhili leader Wu Peifu, he has gained lots of influence in League politics. Not appointing him to this position would be very dangerous for our regime, so he is the only choice."
 lep.116.a: "We pray for Governor Fang's success."

 lep.117.t: "Governor for Jiangxi"
 lep.117.d: "Jiangxi, a poor, underdeveloped province of the League, has been under the leadership of Deng Ruzhou for many years. Under him, Jiangxi has become a hotbed for German investments, with much of the province being dependent on German cash. Deng has got comfortable in his position, perhaps too comfortable. Importantly, another man wishes to become Jiangxi's governor. Fang Benren, after graduating from Beijing Military Academy, worked in the Guangdong army, eventually as its commander-in-chief, then eventually as a high level commander and general in the League army. Having had strong links to Sun Chuangfang, and a suspicion of Northern Zhili leader Wu Peifu, he has gained lots of influence in League politics. Not appointing him to this position would be very dangerous for our regime, even though Deng has held it for years."
 lep.117.a: "We pray for Governor Fang's success."
 lep.117.b: "Governor Deng shall stay."

 lep.200.t: "Nanking-Kommission Requests we Intervene in the Fengtian-Qing War"
 lep.200.d: "While we were grateful for Wu Peifu's support during the League Collapse war, we have avoided the current conflict engulfing the north in favour of focusing on developing our territory. Now, however, the Nanking-Kommission has expressed 'severe dismay' at our lack of support for the conflict and urged us to intervene. To sweeten the deal they have promised to supply some German weapons and capital. While we can refuse, accepting seems like the far better choice."
 lep.200.a: "Of course! To war!"
 lep.200.b: "No."

 lep.201.t: "Wu Peifu Requests we Intervene in the Fengtian-Qing War!"
 lep.201.d: "Historical ties of animosity between the Northern and Southern Zhili Cliques have prevented us from working much together. That changed, however, this morning, when a telegram from Marshal Wu was delivered to Marshal Qi requesting he join the war against the Fengtian and their Japanese backers. Should we put aside our differences for the good of China?"
 lep.201.a: "Of course! Down with the Japanese!"
 lep.201.b: "No."

 lep.203.a: "We have only a short time to prepare."

 lep.204.t: "The [FROM.GetName] calls for Aid!"
 lep.204.d: "News has come by telephone straight from [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], our allies in the [FROM.GetName] are about to be attacked by [LEP.GetName]! Already their forces are mobilising, but they cannot confront this foe alone."

 lep.205.d_ger: "According to our spies in [LEP.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], [LEP.GetLeader] and his senior command staff are currently considering opening a new front in our war against [QIE.GetName]. Reportedly the German Nanking-Kommission is footing the bill for a major weapons shipment in preparation, but [LEP.GetLeader]'s tenuous relationship with the Central Government is well known.\n\nWhatever decision is made in [LEP.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], we must be ready."
 lep.205.d_noger: "According to our spies in [LEP.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], [LEP.GetLeader] and his senior command staff are currently considering opening a new front in our war against [QIE.GetName].

 lep.205.a: "Another obstacle on the road to reclamation."

 lep.206.t: "Chen Xuezhao"
 lep.206.d: "The daughter of peasants, Chen Xuezhao was born in Haining in Zhejiang province in 1906. She was educated at the Girl's Normal School in Nantong County and then was educated at the university level by attending the Shanghai Patriotic Girl's College. Here she joined the Qiancao Literary School and published her first work Wo suo qiwang de xin funü “The Women of my New Ideal” in 1923. Furthermore Chen published an article in the New Women Magazine that sought to explore the phenomenon of women choosing to remain single.\n\nAfter a brief stint of teaching in Zhejiang and Beijing, Chen moved to Paris in 1927, in awe of the new socialist regime that had taken place. An ardent leftist, Chen greatly admired the revolution in France and frequently met with the exiles of the leftist KMT such as Wang Jingwei. After completing her Ph.D. at the University of Clermont-Ferrand in 1935, she returned to her home country of Zhejiang in the League of Eight Provinces. The crushing of the leftist KMT and the suppression of socialism following the league's victory has not discouraged Chen from writing however. The writer has come up with “Talks in Paris on Arts and Literature”, a paper explaining the movement towards proletariat art and contains excerpts from influential French artists such as Andre Breton. While her work may be innocent and is certainly appealing with the masses who are interested in the arts abroad, there are many who believe her works are nothing more than radical socialist propaganda."
 lep.206.a: "What harm can come out of this?"
 lep.206.b: "Enough of this! Silence her!"

 lep.207.t: "Ju Péon, the master painter from the East"
 lep.207.d: "Born in 1895, in rural Yixing, Jiangu, Xu Beihong from an early age was trained in the arts of the classic Chinese works and calligraphy. After studying in Fudan University and Tokyo, he learned French and began to teach at the Peking University's Art school at the invitation of the educator Cai Yuanpei. Winning a scholarship at the prestigious National High School of Art in Paris in 1919, he would embark on a decade-long journey in Europe. His stay in Paris would be unexpected as the French nation fell into revolution and the new socialist regime began to take hold and influence art. Heavily inspired by the European traditions of classic art and culture, Xu took the name of Ju Peon while in France and studied at the prestigious École Nationale Supérieure des Beaux-Arts. He would incorporate creative and innovative elements in his artwork inspired by the so called “proletariat” art. His journey in Europe ended in 1927 and he made his home in Nanjing where he began teaching at the National Central University.\n\nIn 1933, Xu organised an exhibition of modern Chinese art that travelled to France, Germany, and Belgium. Xu's work while highlighting the classic styles favoured by European audiences would also showcase scenes of Chinese life and culture - all of which was found to be very fascinating. For Europeans such as the Germans, the brilliance of Xu's Chinese brush and ink techniques combined with Western perspectives and composition were a sign of China's growing modernity."
 lep.207.a: "Truly a master painter!"

 lep.208.t: "Tsen's Theorem"
 lep.208.d: "Born to a poor fisherman's family in Nanchang in Jiangxi province, Chiungtze C. Tsen was forced to take intermittent breaks in his education to work due to his poverty. In 1917, he passed the entrance examination and was admitted to Jiangxi Provincial First Normal College in Nanchang. After graduation in 1920, he would go on teach in primary and secondary schools and entered the National Wuchang University with an emphasis on mathematics. In 1928, Tsen went to study overseas in Germany and attended the University of Gottingen where he studied algebra under Emmy Noether. He received his doctorate degree in 1934 and his dissertation on quasi-algebraic closure would lead to his proof of a fundamental theorem which was named in his honour. As a research fellow sponsored by both Chinese and German academic foundations in the hopes of fostering further goodwill between the two nations, Tsen would return to China in 1937 to teach at Hangzhou.\n\nDespite the chaos of the League War, Tsen has remained active in academic circles and has recently published his third paper in the journal of the Chinese Mathematical Society. As a professor of mathematics and a fluent reader of German, his work demonstrates that China can indeed catch up to the standards of Western education."
 lep.208.a: "His work will be helpful!"

 lep.209.t: "The Golden Voice of China"
 lep.209.d: "Her beautiful and unique voice rings out from gramophones from Shanghai's most fashionable clubs to the grand halls of Nanjing - Zhou Xuan has exploded into popularity across China. As the situation in China politically remains constantly at the edge and the country is plagued with internal and external issues, Zhou Xuan's music has remained a reassuring pillar in the turbulent times. Perhaps compelling is her own personal life story - a life full of poverty and woe and one that many of her listeners can relate to.\n\nBorn Su Pu and separated from her natural parents at a young age, she was sold by a relative at three. At the age of 13, she would take the name “Zhou Xuan” as her stage name, her name meaning “beautiful jade.” And indeed, like a beautiful jade that is admired, she has released hits that have been popular throughout China, such as “Nights of Shanghai/Ye Shanghai,” “Blooming Flowers and the Full Moon,” and the “Song of Four Seasons.” And yet, despite the glamour, her personal life has been marked with failed marriages, illegitimate children, and even rumoured suicide attempts. Yet, her life provides a respite to the chaos in China as her rise from rags to riches will undoubtedly inspire others. Performing throughout China and impressing foreign dignitaries, Zhou Xuan's music brings light in an otherwise dark period for the Chinese people."
 lep.209.a: "Our own Lil Marlene!"

 lepcollapse.1.t: "Sun Chuanfang meets with Governors"
 lepcollapse.1.d: "League-Marshal Sun Chuanfang met today with the governors of the Five Eastern Provinces who, the public has been told, discussed matters of regular governance and administration. \"The rice crop in Jiangxi has been poorer than expected this year\", said Governor Deng Ruzuo, \"it's important that taxes are adjusted appropriately to compensate.\"\n\nThe absence of officials from Guangdong, Guangxi, and Hunan, as well as the presence of purely military figures like General Qi Xieyuan, has led some to believe that the meeting actually concerned more serious matters of state security."
 lepcollapse.1.a: "Interesting"

 lepcollapse.2.t: "The Zhegan Railway"
 lepcollapse.2.d: "Today marks the long-planned opening of the Zhegan Railway, the latest extension to which finally connects Shanghai to Nanchang, a city deep in Jiangxi Province. The opening is noteworthy for a few reasons, first among them the prominent involvement of Chinese engineers in the construction despite its significant funding by the Aufsichtsrat der Ostasiatischen Generalverwaltung, also known as the AOG, which has turned the work into something of a cause celebre.\n\nThose less optimistic have been quick to point out the AOG's newfound access to rich mineral deposits, as well as Jingdezhen Porcelain, which has been able to fetch high prices in Berlin.\n\nDespite concerns, a threatened attack upon the opening ceremony by Kuomintang agents did not take place."
 lepcollapse.2.a: "Railways bring prosperity!"

 lepcollapse.3.t: "An Unexpected Announcement"
 lepcollapse.3.d: "Late this morning, to the surprise of many, the AOG publicly announced its plans to purchase and consolidate a number of eastern railways on behalf of the Schantung-Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft, one of its component concerns. Among them is the new Zhegan Railway.\n\nThe AOG already possesses controlling shares in a number of lines across Eastern China, several of which it directly financed, but this dashes the hopes of those who believed the new railway might represent a more equal future for Germans and Chinese. While Chinese management will be permitted to remain, they will now answer to a German directory board. Though scarcely admitted to the public, few authorities in the League seem to have been forewarned of this development, and the police response to protests has been slower than normal."
 lepcollapse.3.a: "An unpleasant surprise..."

 lepcollapse.4.t: "Unrest Spreads"
 lepcollapse.4.d: "Unsurprisingly, the consolidation of the Central China Railway under AOG management has met with widespread criticism. Intellectuals have condemned the move in domestic papers, followed by prominent Anglo-American publications out of Shanghai, and echoed by Syndicalist party periodicals found on factory floors. More troubling however, the news has spread rapidly by word of mouth, and has grown all the more outrageous and fantastical in the process.\n\nTales now describe extensive webs of conspiracy, disappearances of outspoken individuals, and the supposed transfer of millions of Yuan into the League-Marshal's own pockets. The public's reaction has been predictably furious, and protests have already spread from Zhejiang and Jiangxi to the major coastal cities, including the foreign settlements."
 lepcollapse.4.a: "Do peasants have nothing better to do?"

 lepcollapse.5.t: "Attacks on Foreigners"
 lepcollapse.5.d: "Beginning with assaults on prominent German citizens, and having grown to become virtually indiscriminate, attacks on foreigners by emboldened "patriotic" citizens are spreading like wildfire. The German consulate in Nanjing has advised the Kaiser's subjects to arm themselves, and travel only when necessary. The consulates of most other nationalities may soon follow suit.\n\nThe impact of these attacks on business and investment remains to be seen, but recent history suggests the Shanghai Stock Exchange will not remain unaffected."
 lepcollapse.5.a: "Troubling"

 lepcollapse.6.t: "Boycotts and Beijing"
 lepcollapse.6.d: "Talk of a boycott on German goods has accompanied growing protests throughout Eastern China, provoked by an assortment of Kuomintang agents, religious cultists, and nationalist ideologues. More disturbingly, some local garrisons have stepped back and allowed the unrest to grow, unwilling to risk being labelled 'Hanjian' or 'race traitors'. In order to ward off intervention from Beijing, advisors from the Nanking-Kommission have suggested that League-Marshal Sun publicly declare that the situation is under control.\n\nElements of several divisions based in Nanjing stand ready to be deployed to cities along the lower Yangtze, where protests are largest, and provincial garrisons could be given the green light to take whatever action they deem necessary to quell the open dissent."
 lepcollapse.6.a: "Use maximum force"
 lepcollapse.6.b: "Punish only the violent"

 lepcollapse.7.t: "Railway Bombings"
 lepcollapse.7.d: "Explosions have rocked several stations and rail lines slated to become part of the Central China Railway, with one bomb shredding a train car in a crowded station at Hangzhou, leaving dozens killed and injured. The deaths and delays have brought transportation to a standstill in many areas, and has slowed the deployment of additional forces to quell the growing unrest.\n\nBlame for the attacks has been levelled against various targets, from bandits, to the KMT, to Japanese agents. Some especially conspiracy-minded individuals have suggested German involvement, who they suggest are targeting their own possessions to set the stage for an intervention."
 lepcollapse.7.a: "Terrorism!"

 lepcollapse.8.t: "Reports from North and South"
 lepcollapse.8.d: "Troubling reports have reached Nanjing from both Xuzhou and Quanzhou.\n\nIn the MinGan Insurgent Zone, KMT guerrillas have staged a series of increasingly bold raids, striking around the inland cities of Yongding and Longyan. Governor Zhou Yinren has long struggled to assert control over his mountainous province, with control often limited to the coast and the larger inland cities, and now his grasp grows all the more tenuous.\n\nMeanwhile in Jiangsu, governor Zheng Junyan reports increased agitation by Yiguandao adherents, spreading over the border from Shandong. These religious fanatics have been a point of long-standing frustration for the Governor, but their involvement may well be encouraging the rising unrest."
 lepcollapse.8.a: "Temporary setbacks..."

 lepcollapse.9.t: "A Telegram from Beijing"
 lepcollapse.9.d: "A telegram has been received from Beijing, apparently sent at the direction of Imperial Commissioner Wu Peifu, who sits as Qing Army Minister and the undisputed head of the nation's central military apparatus. The message inquires about the current chaotic state of affairs, clearly worded with the intent to force League-Marshal Sun to admit some weakness or hardship.\n\nThe Central Government, under Wu's direction, has repeatedly attempted to extend its direct authority south, but so far such efforts have been in vain. Our response must be careful and measured, demonstrating that we need no Central Government assistance to disperse these insurrectionists."
 lepcollapse.9.a: "Everything is under control"

 lepcollapse.10.t: "The Wuhu Incident"
 lepcollapse.10.d: "This afternoon protests in the city of Wuhu, bolstered by striking workers from nearby German-owned factories, quickly escaped police control. The garrison, itself reinforced by a section of German-trained troops from Nanjing, attempted to restore order, but in the confused melee someone started shooting. Within a matter of minutes police, the garrison, and their reinforcing troops had begun firing on the crowd and each other. Over two hundred are already confirmed dead, with four times as many likely wounded, and the resultant outrage has already sparked protests in surrounding areas.\n\nThe situation is made all the worse by the presence of a small foreign settlement within the city. Many are already claiming that lethal force was only used in order to protect these foreigners, and the killings will most likely feature in international newspapers by tomorrow morning."
 lepcollapse.10.a: "Could things get any worse?"

 lepcollapse.11.t: "Anqing Refuses Further Cooperation"
 lepcollapse.11.d: "Citing the recent incident at Wuhu, Governor Chen Tiaoyuan has issued an ultimatum calling for the withdrawal of all non-provincial forces from Anhui, as well as the immediate hand-over of those officers responsible. Though Chen assures the league that his own soldiers will continue to quell the spreading unrest and disorder, he refuses further cooperation with League authorities and denounces the creation of the Central China Railway, which he blames for \"pushing patriotic citizens to the edge of despair\".\n\nUnder normal circumstances this behaviour would be unacceptable, but Chen's stance has already proven popular and decisive action could serve to further divide the now fragile League."
 lepcollapse.11.a: "We must bide our time"
 lepcollapse.11.b: "Let us join Governor Chen! (Play as Anqing)"

#Black Monday 2.3.36 February 3rd 1936

 lepcollapse.12.t: "Black Monday reaches the East"
 lepcollapse.12.d: "Although it began a world away, Black Monday's fallout has already reached China. The Shanghai Exchange plummeted before closing at numbers unseen since the financial tumult of 1925, and local institutions are already doing what they can to mitigate the damage. Fortunately, the average citizen is unlikely to feel any immediate impact, but the AOG, already staggering under an extensive retaliatory boycott, faces dire financial circumstances.\n\nIts clerks have already issued notice that it may be unable to pay the usual rents for its various concessions, and that the final payment promised for the Zhegan Railway has been \"indefinitely postponed\". Without this planned revenue, we will be forced to enact major budget cuts."
 lepcollapse.12.a: "How will we pay the troops?"

 lepcollapse.13.t: "Dissension in the Ranks"
 lepcollapse.13.d: "Word of suspended pay has already spread as far as the League's junior officers, and the reaction has been predictably negative. For some this will mean an end to lifestyles of vice and extravagance, at least for the time-being, but for many a common soldier it's the difference between life and starvation.\n\nThe officers' grumbling is made all the worse by a small but vocal clique of officers sympathetic to Chen Tiaoyuan's cause, arguing that the League should never have become so dependent on German 'handouts'. In the barracks and in the streets, soldiers are being riled up by Yiguandao adherents, seeking converts and preaching against foreign 'wickedness', while the Kuomintang and other leftist groups hide in the shadows, disseminating propaganda and denouncing 'imperialist collaboration'. Nothing has yet come of these activities, but what was once routine unrest is now threatening undermine the very foundations of the League."
 lepcollapse.13.a: "Rebellion will be punished!"

 lepcollapse.14.t: "A Heinous Crime"
 lepcollapse.14.d: "Sun Chuanfang lies mortally wounded, shot from behind by an assassin disguised as a serving-woman. His brave bodyguards were able to quickly overpower and imprison the woman, but rumours have already begun to spread and swirl.\n\nThe incapacitation of the League's only widely recognised leader is an unprecedented disaster, and unless he recovers soon a successor is unlikely to be chosen without considerable bloodshed. Without effective leadership and with political fragmentation all but a certainty, the ongoing crisis will surely spin out of control.\n\nThe League's fate lies in the balance."
 lepcollapse.14.a: "Who could be responsible?"

 lepcollapse.15.t: "Spreading Insubordination"
 lepcollapse.15.d: "Telegrams have been flooding in all morning, accompanied by the din of ringing telephones throughout the League-Marshal's Palace, together describing a rapidly deteriorating situation across much of the League. With no promise of pay, soldiers in Xuzhou, Nanchang, Quanzhou, and several other cities are either refusing to act or outright joining the spreading violence and looting, while police and garrisons in Hangzhou and Wuxi have gone on strike. Riots there and elsewhere are gradually escaping all semblance of control, made all the worse by Sun Chuanfang's incapacity.\n\nTroublingly, telegraph lines south of Fujian appear to have been cut, leaving us entirely in the dark as to the likely worsening situation in Guangzhou and Guangxi, while Nanjing itself is now practically in the throes of violent revolution."
 lepcollapse.15.a: "Marshal Sun must wake soon..."

 lepcollapse.16.t: "Riots reach the Marshal's Palace"
 lepcollapse.16.d: "The Nanjing Police have been unable to contain one of many riots spreading across the capital, as officers defect or sit idle, and onlookers join the chaos; looting and burning homes, businesses, and now government offices. The hasty arrival of military units under the command of general Qi Xieyuan, already deployed nearby, seems enough to protect the Marshal's Palace, but the roar of flames and the burgeoning crowds are audible even within the chamber where Sun Chuanfang lies, deep in a coma.\n\nLike rats fleeing from a sinking ship, officials have been observed scurrying away into back streets and alleyways, arms burdened by silver coins, papers, and perhaps government secrets."
 lepcollapse.16.a: "What are we to do?"

 lepcollapse.17.t: "The Illusion of Qing Hegemony Shatters"
 lepcollapse.17.d1: "The facade of Chinese unity, having held together for nearly a decade, has begun to crumble.\n\nRising unrest in the League of Eight Provinces, the economic shock of Black Monday portending German retrenchment, and the inability"
 lepcollapse.17.d2: "$lepcollapse.17.d1$ of the national Government to deliver a decisive response to either has made one thing clear; Beijing's monopoly on power is broken"
 lepcollapse.17.d_qie: "$lepcollapse.17.d1$ of our government to effectively deal with the crisis has made one thing clear: our monopoly on power is broken. We must now attempt to deal with the chaos."
 lepcollapse.17.d_fng: "$lepcollapse.17.d2$.\n\nAn opportunity to strike south has never presented itself so clearly, but is the Northeast ready?"
 lepcollapse.17.d_anq: "$lepcollapse.17.d2$.\n\nPerhaps we can turn this opportunity, which began by playing Beijing against Nanjing, into something much more. The time has come to roll the dice."
 lepcollapse.17.d_sqi: "$lepcollapse.17.d2$.\n\nPerhaps we can redeem the Chinese people from our humble province of Shandong? Armies and levies to the South must be tired of their mercurial leaders, and the common Chinese cries out for our assurance."
 lepcollapse.17.d_szc: "$lepcollapse.17.d2$.\n\nThe old order upon which we built our alliance of Sichuanese warlords is broken, and the future is uncertain indeed."
 lepcollapse.17.d_sik: "$lepcollapse.17.d2$.\n\nHowever, so long as our rule is secured, it matters little."
 lepcollapse.17.d_tib: "$lepcollapse.17.d2$.\n\nThe future is uncertain, but the time to find our Dalai Lama is fast approaching."
 lepcollapse.17.d_mon: "$lepcollapse.17.d2$.\n\nPerhaps the time has come to look once again to so-called 'inner Mongolia', where many Mongolians still live at the mercy of their Han masters."
 lepcollapse.17.d_jap: "$lepcollapse.17.d2$.\n\nThe situation on the continent has shifted decisively in the Empire's favour."
 lepcollapse.17.d: "$lepcollapse.17.d2$, and now the future is any man's game."
 lepcollapse.17.a: "This will not go well..."
 lepcollapse.17.b: "China is finally divided."
 lepcollapse.17.c: "The end of an era."

 lepcollapse.18.t: "Uprisings in Fujian!"
 lepcollapse.18.d: "Kuomintang rebels, already fomenting insurrection throughout the League, have begun a general uprising in Fujian province, emerging from the mountains to seize a number of villages in the province's interior. The MinGan Insurgent Zone was already known to be a danger, but with the chaos now gripping the League there is every possibility that they will cut a path to the coast, opening the way for aid from their Syndicalist allies.\n\nAt present governor Zhou Yinren is known to have several divisions in and around Quanzhou, but this is unlikely to be enough to stem the tide. As well, troops loyal to the Kuomintang have risen up along the border with the Shanghai Concession, threatening the heart of our power."
 lepcollapse.18.a: "Syndicalist scum!"
 lepcollapse.18.b: "(Play as the Kuomintang)"

 lepcollapse.19.t: "General Qi Assumes Control"
 lepcollapse.19.d: "Following a closed meeting lasting nearly four hours, Qi Xieyuan has emerged to declare himself acting League-Marshal, and promises to restore order to the fractured League. Already his forces have begun asserting control over Nanjing's arsenal, military headquarters, and major thoroughfares, broadcasting the news by megaphone and clearing the streets with enfilades of rifle fire. Cities along much of the Lower Yangtze have already begun declaring for Qi, but communications with several provinces have broken down. With Sun's condition deteriorating, he is unlikely to be only an acting-league marshal for long."
 lepcollapse.19.a: "A coup in all but name?"

 lepcollapse.20.t: "Chen Tiaoyuan Declares War"
 lepcollapse.20.d: "Calling upon his fellow governors and the central government to aid him in his cause, Chen Tiaoyuan has denounced Marshal Qi's ascension as 'totally illegitimate' and a 'farce', accusing him of planning Sun's assassination and his following grab for power well in advance. This argument has already proven convincing, as a number of younger officers have already deserted to his ranks.\n\nThe other governors remain silent, for now."
 lepcollapse.20.a: "Damn him!"

 lepcollapse.21.t: "Liangguang Secedes!"
 lepcollapse.21.d: "Silence from the south was broken this evening by a declaration from governor Chen Jiongming, speaking on behalf of both Guangdong and Guangxi provinces, that they have together seceded from the League with immediate effect. The General denounced the League's 'disregard for the rights and needs of the people' and singled out the Acting League-Marshal for special criticism, but stopped short of outright declaring hostilities. With Anhui Province already openly subordinate, this turn of events is disastrous, and in most cases would merit a response.\n\nThe news was received by way of telegraph from Hong Kong, which also reported the public humiliation and execution of numerous League officials in Huizhou, but exact details remain scarce."
 lepcollapse.21.a: "Traitors!"

 lepcollapse.22.t: "Hunan Secedes!"
 lepcollapse.22.d: "Governor Zhao Hengti has announced his province's intention to secede from the League, citing his membership as a personal agreement made with Sun Chuanfang and not the new acting League-Marshal. Like Chen Jiongming, he has not declared hostilities, and is likely beginning to consider his position within China's rapidly shifting balance of power."
 lepcollapse.22.a: "Traitors everywhere!"

 lepcollapse.23.t: "Sun Chuanfang Dies"
 lepcollapse.23.d: "At about 4:15 yesterday afternoon, Sun Chuanfang succumbed to his wounds, having never woken from the coma he entered not long after being shot. His last words at that time were reportedly a series of complaints about the state of his breakfast, and so they will not be reported publicly. Though not among the very worst of the warlords, Sun will not be remembered fondly by many, despite his insistence that he was an 'authentic warlord' unlike so many 'capricious politicians'.\n\nA funeral will reportedly take place once order is restored to the League, and tellingly Sun's demise barely made the morning headlines, sharing front pages with reports of troop movements, and a student massacre at Zhejiang University."

 #Chen Yi joins Anqing:
 lepcollapse.24.t_2: "General Chen Rises in Zhejiang!"
 lepcollapse.24.d_1: "Citing the abuses of his superiors, Shangguan Yunxiang has rallied the Hangzhou Garrison and the units under his command to Chen Tiaoyuan's cause, and against governor Chen Yi. The governor, installed after the removal of Lu Xiangting in 1932, has never been particularly popular among his men, but enough have remained loyal for him to fortify the city's core and await reinforcements.\n\nShangguan has long been known for his shameless ambition, but this rapid spread of insubordination is increasingly concerning."
 lepcollapse.24.d_2: "Joining Chen Tiaoyuan's condemnations of the Acting League-Marshal and the overall state of the League, governor Chen Yi of Zhejiang has rallied his forces in Hangzhou. Chen, installed after the removal of Lu Xiangting in 1932, has never been particularly popular among his men, and he may lack the momentum to survive long on his own.\n\nGeneral Shangguan Yunxiang, already active in the area, has assured Qi of his unwavering loyalty and commitment to defeating the traitorous governor. Known for his shameless ambition, he surely anticipates more than a medal."
 lepcollapse.24.a: "Treachery"

 lepcollapse.25.t: "Governor Chen is Defeated!"
 lepcollapse.25.d: "Finally, after much struggle, we have entered Anqing and taken the province back for the League. This is a great day for the Zhili Clique."
 lepcollapse.25.a: "Excellent."

 lepcollapse.30.t: "Secret Negotiations with Shangguan Yunxiang"
 lepcollapse.30.d: "With the threat of rebellion from [ANQ.GetLeader] to our west and chaos to the south, we need to guarantee a corridor from where we can reach our troops in the south. While Chen Yi has shown to be loyal, there is the threat that he may choose to ally with [ANQ.GetLeader] cutting us off from our southern army. We could appeal to his subordinate who has never been content with his position and offer him the governorship, though he is a greedy man and may desire far more than what we could offer. Of course, there is always the choice to trust in Governor Chen Yi..."
 lepcollapse.30.a: "Offer him Hangzhou."

 lepcollapse.32.d_1: "Governor Chen Yi of Zhejiang has sided with the League of Eight Provinces in this most desperate hour. Him and Shangguan's forces have rallied around Jinhua and march west to take the provincial capital of Anhui and kick out the forces of [ANQ.GetLeader]. Shangguan joins our cause!"
 lepcollapse.32.d_2: "As he promised us, Shangguang of the Zhejiang province has risen up and joined our forces! With his help, we now control Hangzhou, which provides us a stable corridor south to face the KMT. Nonetheless the Anqing-Hangzhou corridor is far from secure as it forms an easy prey to the rapidly advancing forces of [ANQ.GetLeader]."

 lepcollapse.34.t: "Sun Liren offers his Services"
 lepcollapse.34.d: "The destruction of the Anqing clique and the fall of Chen Tiaoyuan's anti-concessionist movement have left many of his nationalist compatriots adrift. While the junior ranks have mostly either been absorbed into other factions or have gone on to teach at the \"green forest school\", the vast majority of Chen's senior leadership have either fled to the legations, Japan or anywhere else they could find employment. Few would even consider joining our ranks, so it was somewhat of a surprise when we were approached by General Sun Liren and a few other officers in his staff. Desiring to serve an anti-concessionist and nationalist cause, he has asked for an appointment in our growing armies.\n\nA native of Anhui, Sun was one of the few participants of the 1919 anti-Entente protests against the Duan Qirui government as a young man. Studying abroad at Purdue University, his continued anti-Imperialism brought him to enrol in the Virginia Military Institute. Graduating just after the end of the Northern Expedition, he is a member of a new generation of officers in China. Given his history and the myriad of other prospective candidates, few would question us if we said no. However, his unique training and his youthful enthusiasm embody much of the hopes of the younger generation of anti-Imperialist officers."

Finding the kleptocratic quagmire of the League of Eight Provinces insulting and a disgrace, Ma Dengying is a principled man, and staunch in his anti-concessionism.

 lepaog.3.t: "German Involvement in the Assassination"
 lepaog.3.d: "As the investigation into the murder of Sun Chuanfang continues, a difficult complication has arose. While nothing has been proven as-of-yet, investigators have discovered a possible link between a prosperous German director in Nanjing and the assassin. Catching word of our suspicions, the AOG has informed us that the individual is completely innocent, and requests that we remove him from the scope of our investigation."

 lepaog.5.b: "Demand a full repayment."

 lepaog.6.t: "Control of the Concession Factories"
 lepaog.6.d: "Due to AOG retraction after Black Monday, we were able to fill in the vacuum left and gain a modicum of control over the concession industries. While this situation is not likely to last long, it is appreciated, none the less."

 lepaog.7.t: "German Investment Council"
 lepaog.7.d: "With the interior now officially up for grabs, the AOG has decided to head off the inevitable chaos of this veritable gold rush and establish an investment council to regulate German businesses in the region. While this is undoubtedly a boon, it is somewhat unfortunate that it is the Germans, and not us, who are in direct control."

 lepaog.8.t: "German Reconstruction Imports"
 lepaog.8.d: "The loss of our southern territories has caused somewhat of a resource disaster in our country, with many traditional internal industries now cut off from us.

 lepaog.10.t: "DAB Loans: Begin"
 lepaog.10.d: "The Deutsch-Asiatische Bank is the largest surviving financial institution in the region, and under the thumb of the AOG. Economically speaking, their support would be enough to reinvent the League's economy. But the political cost might very well ruin us regardless."
 lepaog.10.a: "We can trust the banks, right?"

 lepaog.11.t: "DAB Loans: Size"
 lepaog.11.d: "The first order of business is deciding on the extent of the loans we are taking out. While a larger loan may be more cost-effective, we may only need a small financial investment to reinvigorate our economy. "
 lepaog.11.a: "Go big or go home."
 lepaog.11.b: "A reasonably sized loan is needed."
 lepaog.11.c: "We only need a small financial boost."

 lepaog.12.c: "Prioritise Military Industry"

 lepaog.13.t: "AOG Demands Early Repayment!"
 lepaog.13.d: "As a shocking but perhaps not unexpected surprise, the AOG has requested that we repay our DAB loans early, ostensibly due to increasing financial tensions in the region. While this is both frustrating and a detriment to our economy, there is nothing we can do but agree to the new terms."
 lepaog.13.a: "Really?!"

 lepaog.14.t: "AOG Banking Expands"
 lepaog.14.d: "The German century continues for the AOG, it'd seem, as the DAB has used the aftermath of Black Monday to further expand its financial monopoly in China. While this may be a long-term concern, right now it is a direct benefit to our own economy."
 lepaog.14.a: "Good for them."

 lepaog.15.t: "DAB Buys out League Banks"
 lepaog.15.d: "In a rather awkward turn of events, the Deutsch-Asiatische Bank has begun to buy out failing League banks across the country. While there is nothing we can do to challenge this, it continues to undermine our authority when it comes to our own economy."
 lepaog.15.a: "Fine by us."
 lepaog.15.b: "We'd prefer that they remain in Chinese hands."

 lepaog.16.t: "Opening the Interior: Begin"
 lepaog.16.d: "It is time to make German access to the League interior official. While small independent ventures have already made their way to the region, a fullscale German investment still requires our sign off, and the settling of several key logistical and political questions before it can begin in earnest."
 lepaog.16.a: "This can't go wrong."

 lepaog.17.t: "Opening the Interior: Status of the Chinese"
 lepaog.17.d: "The first order of business is the fate of Chinese businesses in the interior. Several key business leaders are requesting assurances of protection in the case that German investments destroying their livelihoods, while others are outright demanding right-of-privilege over German businesses."
 lepaog.17.a: "Our own businesses will always take priority."
 lepaog.17.b: "We can surely find a balance here."
 lepaog.17.c: "They must learn to coexist with the German presence."

 lepaog.18.t: "Opening the Interior: Status of the Germans"
 lepaog.18.d: "The second question pertains to the status of German citizens in the region. While Germans already possess considerable advantages over other foreign nationals, such as embassy rights and passport expediting, the Nanking-Kommission has 'suggested' that we formally elevate the status of German citizens, as a show of goodwill to our new trading partners."
 lepaog.18.a: "Issue new laws for German citizens."
 lepaog.18.b: "Germans and Chinese shall be equal under League laws."
 lepaog.18.c: "They shall be treated as privileged guests."

 lepaog.19.t: "Opening the Interior: German Arrival"
 lepaog.19.d: "With outstanding matters concluded, German entry into the interior has begun in earnest. While the full fruits of this decision may take a while to be felt, we are already receiving a benefit from the modest economic boom happening in our country."
 lepaog.19.a: "Let's hope they enjoy their stay."

 lepaog.20.t: "Opening the Interior: Business Conflicts!"
 lepaog.20.d: "It seems that nothing ever goes off without a hitch. Several Chinese businesses have filed complaints, alleging German exploitation, monopolisation, and financial bullying in regions where German investment has grown thickest. In response the AOG has sent a counter-claim, arguing that Chinese officials and businesses are not sufficiently cooperating and on occasion downright frustrating the actions of German business interests in the region."
 lepaog.20.a: "Our Businesses should take priority."
 lepaog.20.b: "The Germans should take priority."
 lepaog.20.c: "Who's to say?"

 lepaog.21.t: "Opening the Interior: Finish"
 lepaog.21.d: "With the first rush of investment having finally settled down, our interior has entered a state of new 'normal.' While the full ramifications of our decision will only be felt over the coming decades, we can already see the beginnings of such changes taking route in our economy."
 lepaog.21.a: "Glad that's over with."

 lepaog.22.t: "Schantung-Eisenbahn Expansion"
 lepaog.22.d: "While the Schantung Eisenbahngesellschaft is not directly controlled by the AOG, they are still effectively a German proxy. There is debate amongst our government whether, as such, they should be trusted with complete control of the rails, or whether some level of Chinese control is required."
 lepaog.22.a: "We must respect the German buyout."
 lepaog.22.b: "We Demand equal ownership!"

 lepaog.23.t: "Railroad Payments"
 lepaog.23.d: "Railroads aren't cheap. While the work of the SEG has proven quite profitable, it hasn't been delivered gratis. The Nanking-Kommission has politely reminded us that a reasonable repayment is expected, and soon."
 lepaog.23.a: "Repay them."
 lepaog.23.b: "Repay them with influence."
 lepaog.23.c: "What payments?"

 lepaog.24.t: "The Schantung-Eisenbahn Expands"
 lepaog.24.d: "Following our economic support of the project, the SEG continues to make tracks inwards into the League. While there is a general disquiet about such proceedings, nobody can deny that the Germans are good at making the trains run on time."
 lepaog.24.a: "Excellent."

 lepaog.25.t: "Rail Taxes?"
 lepaog.25.d: "An idea has been floated in the central government about a new rail tax on the general populace to pay for our continued expansion. While unpopular, it may be necessary to find a new temporary source of income to help continue our industrialisation."
 lepaog.25.a: "A smart idea."
 lepaog.25.b: "Raising taxes pleases no one."

 lepaog.26.t: "Germans Ask for Tax Exemption"
 lepaog.26.d: "In a display of arrogance, the AOG has request that all German businesses be exempt from our new rail tax. The fact that we raised this tax to pay for their railroads hasn't seemed to register, and they are quite insistent on this demand, what should we do?"
 lepaog.26.a: "Fine."
 lepaog.26.b: "Yeah, no."

 lepaog.27.t: "Eastern Resources Commission: Introduction"
 lepaog.27.d: "The Eastern Resources commission, primarily drawn from Chinese business interests and AOG monopolists, have managed to put aside their many differences in the pursuit of a shared goal: profit. While Chinese interests provide the location and manpower for resource extraction, the Germans provide the technical know-how and equipment to proper extract such resources."
 lepaog.27.a: "Let's hope they find something worthwhile."

 lepaog.28.t: "Status of Germans on the Commission"
 lepaog.28.d: "Apparently dissatisfied with the current status quo, the AOG has demanded a reshuffle of the Eastern Resources Commission, arguing that German interests 'are not adequately' represented by the commission. By this, they presumably mean that they do not have full control of the board, and want to rectify this. While it is a blazon grab for power, without AOG backing, the commission itself is almost functionally useless."
 lepaog.28.a: "Allow a German majority."
 lepaog.28.b: "Acquiesce, but try to curtail their influence."

 lepaog.29.t: "AOG Requests Renegotiation of German Rights"
 lepaog.29.d: "With the continued success of the Eastern Resources Commission, the AOG has once again called for an elevation of German interests in the region. While German citizens and businesses already receive ample privileges, the AOG has asked that we elevate these rights in perpetuity, to 'solidify the successful Sino-German Relationship.'"
 lepaog.29.a: "A reasonable request."
 lepaog.29.b: "The situation as it stands is fine."

 lepaog.30.t: "German Industrial Expansion"
 lepaog.30.d: "Just as before, our business with the Germans has proven fabulously profitable. With new resource deposits being opened and their wealth within flowing (mostly) into our collars, we once again have our friends in Tsingtau to thank."
 lepaog.30.a: "Business is booming."

 lepaog.31.t: "AOG Implements Exclusive Economic Zones"
 lepaog.31.d: "Seizing upon their disproportionate influence in our country, the AOG has implemented a policy of economic exclusivity for German Interests, effectively cinching their monopoly on League investment. While mostly a simple acknowledgement of the present reality, it is concerning that the AOG holds such formidable power inside our own government."
 lepaog.31.a: "This is for the Good of China."

 lepaog.32.t: "AOG Implements Free Trade Policy"
 lepaog.32.d: "Once again flexing their political muscle, the AOG has overruled our officials and instituted a free trade policy for German goods. While this might not be too damaging, it is dangerous to our own internal stability that we are so beholden to the AOG's whims."
 lepaog.32.a: "This is for the good of China, we swear..."

 lepaog.33.t: "German Economic Takeover"
 lepaog.33.d: "In a final economic coup-de-tat, the AOG has successfully Germanised our economy. German banks, factories, and shops throng the streets, and the Mark is more used than the Yuan. Our economy is now effectively that of a German client state."
 lepaog.33.a: "Oh dear."

 lepaog.50.t: "League-Ostasien Relations"
 lepaog.50.d: "The Ostasien administration is the chief backer of the AOG in Asia, and AOG interests are heavily tied to theirs. In a show of collaboration, the AOG has asked that we extend formal diplomatic overtures to the administration, to cement our shared economic interests."
 lepaog.50.a: "Better friends than enemies."

 lepaog.51.t: "AOG Requests Our Support!"
 lepaog.51.d: "With Indochina in open revolt, the AOG has requested that we support Ostasien in quelling the rebellion, both to help a friend in a time of need, and to safeguard against a possible syndicalist threat in future years."
 lepaog.51.a: "They shall have our full support!"
 lepaog.51.b: "Send some equipment their way."
 lepaog.51.c: "They're on their own."

 lepaog.52.t: "Ostasien Border Agreements"
 lepaog.52.d: "With Ostasia and the League once again bordering each other, the AOG has suggested an semi-open border policy between our nations, as a show of goodwill and further economic collaboration."
 lepaog.52.a: "There are no borders between friends."
 lepaog.52.b: "Let's keep things professional."

 lepaog.53.t: "League-Ostasien Connection Deepens"
 lepaog.53.d: "As AOG influence grows, so to does our relationship with Ostasia. To wit, a new economic trade agreement has been drafted by AOG businesses to boost trade between us."
 lepaog.53.a: "Always good to have friends."

 lepaog.54.t: "AOG Requests Ostasien Docking Rights"
 lepaog.54.d: "While Ostasia already has sizeable dockyards in Tsingtau, the AOG has requested that we allow German ships dock in League cities also, as a simple precaution in the case of chaotic naval actions in the China Sea."
 lepaog.54.a: "Granted."
 lepaog.54.b: "Let them keep their ships in Tsingtau."

 lepaog.55.t: "AOG Requests Ostasien Military Access"
 lepaog.55.d: "In a rather audacious request, the AOG has asked for us to give military access to Ostasien troops to protect German interests in our country. While this would be a dramatic ceding of sovereignty, the level of AOG influence in our government makes it difficult to refuse."
 lepaog.55.a: "A reasonable request."
 lepaog.55.b: "We must keep some level of distance."

 lepaog.56.t: "AOG Requests a Full Military Guarantee"
 lepaog.56.d: "With tensions with Japan on the rise, the AOG has demanded that we make a full showing of support to the German colonies in Asia, and that we guarantee a League response in the event of any attack on German territories. This would effectively throw our lot in with the Reichspakt in the event of war, but may be an inevitable conclusion if war reaches our borders."
 lepaog.56.a: "Their safety is ours."
 lepaog.56.b: "This has gone too far!"

 lepaog.57.t: "Transferring of the Concessions"
 lepaog.57.d: "In a demonstration of power, the AOG has decided to transfer direct control of the concessions out of our hands, and into those of the Ostasien administration. As humiliating as this is, it was an inevitable conclusion to the almost complete German control of our nation."
 lepaog.57.a: "It was inevitable."

 lepaog.58.t: "Von Falkhenhausen Returns to Active Duty"
 lepaog.58.d: "With the fight against the secessionists threatening the safety of the German concession cities, the leader of the concession defence force, Alexander Von Falkhenhausen, has returned to active duty to help our fight. The assistance of such a competent general, and the implicit support in our fight, is a great boon to our war effort."
 lepaog.58.a: "Any help is welcome."

On top of those people were the governors of the different provinces, whom themselves acted with relative autonomy and answered only to League-Marshal Sun Chuanfang. When the League collapsed with Chen Tiaoyuan's uprising, this web broke apart, with many people rebelling or seizing power for themselves locally, and with governors trying to escape to get safety in Nanjing. With the League now back to a relative state of decency, it is high time we work on sending these governors back, and in many cases getting new governors, so that work can continue."
