### Focus Tree ###
 armenia_focus: "Armenian Focus Tree"

 ### Economic Tree
 ARM_rebuild_erivan: "Rebuild the Capital"
 ARM_rebuild_erivan_desc: "The heart of our nation, the city of Yerevan, has sadly not been spared by the destruction caused by our independence war. The people are in need of new homes, and our economy is in need of functioning industrial facilities. It is here that we should start our project of rebuilding the country."
 ARM_help_the_people: "Mend the Scars"
 ARM_help_the_people_desc: "The war did not just simply hurt our economy, it also hurt our people. Many have lost their loved ones, their homes, and their wealth. Some are even struggling to supply themselves and their families with food and are forced to live hand to mouth. We have to rebuild the hearts of our people before we can go on with our economic projects."
 ARM_planning_economic_revival: "Reviving the Economy"
 ARM_planning_economic_revival_desc: "The independence war has wrecked our economy. Throughout the country, countless buildings, especially industrial facilities, have been destroyed by the fighting. Many Armenians lost both home and workplace. In order to revive our economy, we'll have to think through every detail and plan the process of rebuilding step by step."
 ARM_agricultural_development_scheme: "Agricultural Development Scheme"
 ARM_agricultural_development_scheme_desc: "Agriculture is the backbone of both our society and economy. If it wasn't for our hard-working farmers, we would be forced to become dependant on imports from other countries or starve to death. Because of this, it only makes sense to start our economic revival by improving our agricultural production rates and supporting our farmers."
 ARM_railway_expansion: "Expand our Railways"
 ARM_railway_expansion_desc: "Railways truly are a magnificent invention. They are by far one of the fastest and safest means of transportation and have revolutionised our day-to-day life. We should work on expanding our railway network and connect some of the more remote cities to it in order to make it easier to travel across the country."
 ARM_start_electrical_program: "Electrify the Country"
 ARM_start_electrical_program_desc: "Light bulbs, telephones and radios - everything needs electricity nowadays. Making inventions like these available to the wider public would improve the standard of living in our country tremendously. Furthermore, electricity can also be used in factories to speed up production and produce higher quality goods."
 ARM_train_purchase: "Acquire Foreign Trains"
 ARM_train_purchase_desc: "Which use do our railways have if we can't put trains on them? Since we don't have the industrial capabilities to start producing trains inside of our country, we should try to purchase some from foreign producers. This will let us utilise our newly expanded railway system to the fullest extent."
 ARM_the_dust_settles: "The Dust Settles"
 ARM_the_dust_settles_desc: "Our nation was in ruins and threatened to collapse under its own weight. Still, we managed to hold on and revive not just our economy, but our country. Homes have been rebuilt, factories repaired and those in need supplied with food and shelter. The dust finally settles..."
 ARM_armenian_broadcast: "The Armenian Radio"
 ARM_armenian_broadcast_desc: "What better way is there to inform, amuse and influence our people than a national radio broadcast? An Armenian radio broadcast will make radios and electricity even more attractive to the people and allow us to better control the exact information they receive about political events and developments."
 ARM_urbanisation_project: "Organise an Urbanisation Project"
 ARM_urbanisation_project_desc: "Urbanisation is an ongoing development that cannot be stopped and should therefore be embraced. By controlling and planning the process of urbanisation, we can guarantee that we will make the most of the city growth it entails and utilise it to improve our economic situation."
 ARM_begin_copper_mining: "Expand Copper Mining Operations"
 ARM_begin_copper_mining_desc: "Our country is rich in mineral deposits, especially when it comes to copper, which is found in large amount in the mountains to the north of Yerevan. Since copper plays an important role in the modern world, mainly being used in electrical equipment, it would make sense to expand our mining operations. If we want to make some profit, we'll have to dig deep and dig greedily!"
 ARM_erivan_university: "Expand the University of Yerevan"
 ARM_erivan_university_desc: "The University of Yerevan, which was established in 1919, is by far the most modern and most important university of our country. An expansion of this institution would result in higher education being more easily accessible for the common people and would allow the university to offer a wider variety of different courses and degrees."
 ARM_no_more_pandemy: "Vaccinate the People"
 ARM_no_more_pandemy_desc: "Pandemics can tear entire countries and societies apart, wreck economies and take thousands of lives. This may not happen to the Armenian people! We shall organise a large-scale vaccination campaign and make sure that everyone is protected against most major diseases."
 ARM_mobilise_the_economy: "Finance the Military"
 ARM_mobilise_the_economy_desc: "Naturally, our nation can't survive without a proper military backing it. However, our military can only fulfil its purpose if it's financed and equipped properly. We should rebalance the budget and commit a greater amount of resources to the defence of our nation."
 ARM_erivan_munition_factories: "The Factories of Yerevan"
 ARM_erivan_munition_factories_desc: "Our army needs guns and other equipment in order to defend our country. We should improve the factories and arsenals of Yerevan so that we can better fulfil the needs of our soldiers. As a welcome side effect, this will also create some more jobs for those in need."
 ARM_military_development: "Armenia's Arsenal"
 ARM_military_development_desc: "Our men are ready to fight off every threat to Armenian independence. While their bravery is without comparison and their equipment somewhat sufficient, it certainly wouldn't hurt anyone if we were to increase the production rates of our military industry even more in order to create a stockpile large enough to last for the duration of an entire war."

 ### Army and Air Force
 ARM_national_army: "The Armenian Army"
 ARM_national_army_desc: "We are surrounded by enemies on virtually all sides. There is only one thing that can save us from our foes: the Armenian Armed Forces. Our proud soldiers shall defend our country and teach our enemies the meaning of fear! They shall not back down and fight till their bones turn to dust!"
 ARM_specialised_training: "Improved Training Programmes"
 ARM_specialised_training_desc: "What our army lacks in quantity, it has to make up for in quality. Though our men have already proven their bravery and vigour on the fields of battle, this alone won't do. If our nation is to withstand the sands of time, then we need to invest in our soldiers' training and ensure that they are capable of defending their homes no matter what terrain, weather, or foe they have to face."
 ARM_mountain_corp: "Mountain Training"
 ARM_mountain_corp_desc: "A good part of our nation is covered in mountains towering above the surrounding highlands. Whilst this has some drawbacks, it also tremendously improves our defensive capabilities. By training our men to utilise this nigh impassable terrain against our enemies, we can ensure that our neighbours think twice about setting foot in our homeland."
 ARM_heal_our_men: "Hospitals for the Wounded"
 ARM_heal_our_men_desc: "There is one resource that has become extremely rare in Armenia: manpower. To us, a single soldier is as valuable as a dozen battalions are to the Germans. We can't just simply leave the wounded to die on the fields. We have to take care of them, heal their wounds and get them back into shape. To that end, we should expand our hospitals and purchase better equipment for them."
 ARM_veteran_knowledge: "Utilise the Knowledge of Veterans"
 ARM_veteran_knowledge_desc: "While a large part of our army consists of fresh volunteers that signed up during our war of independence, there are also some among our ranks who have been a part of the Fidayi for decades. Their knowledge and experience could prove to be a vital advantage in the wars to come."
 ARM_officer_school: "The Armenian Military School"
 ARM_officer_school_desc: "An army is only as competent as its commanding officers. Our generals and field marshals have to be able to use certain strategies efficiently. To that end, we should establish a military school, where our officers will be taught modern strategies that can potentially save countless lives when used on the battlefield."
 ARM_armenian_werewolves: "Werewolves of Armenia"
 ARM_armenian_werewolves_desc: "Ancient tales speak of lycanthropic beasts roaming swiftly through the night, striking their prey unseen, and escaping into the dark just as quickly as they appeared. Our soldiers, too, should learn to use the darkness of the night to their advantage, so that they can strike fear into the hearts of our enemies when they least expect it."
 ARM_develop_our_artillery: "Develop our Artillery"
 ARM_develop_our_artillery_desc: "One of the most efficient forms of support equipment is artillery. Throughout the years, this ranged weapon has constantly changed in terms of size, form and deadliness. Our artillery designs may not fall behind those of the other countries, lest our armies be overshadowed and outgunned by the enemies' soldiers."
 ARM_a_necessary_force: "A Necessary Force"
 ARM_a_necessary_force_desc: "Even though some may not like it, we need an army to secure our place in the world. And not just any army - we need soldiers that are ready to defend their homeland no matter the cost. We need men that can carry the weight of our entire nation on their shoulders. And above anything else, we need a military that the people can put their trust in."
 ARM_airforce: "The Armenian Air Force"
 ARM_airforce_desc: "Modern wars are no longer solely decided by the men fighting on the land and on the seas, they can also be won up in the skies. A modern and efficient Air Force can harass hostile troops, cut of supply lines and even bomb the enemy into submission. However, an Air Force can also be very costly, and it takes both time and effort to construct one from scratch. The sooner we start drawing up plans, the better."
 ARM_radar_station: "Construct Radar Stations"
 ARM_radar_station_desc: "Radar stations as an invention are often underrated. While not directly contributing to the combat, they can decide the outcome of a battle by providing us with valuable information. For example, they can detect enemy airplanes long before we could spot them with ordinary measures. Furthermore, they also make it easier to evaluate the current weather situation, which makes planning operation less of a headache for our generals."
 ARM_rebuild_the_erivan_airport: "Open the Yerevan Airport"
 ARM_rebuild_the_erivan_airport_desc: "The newly established Armenian Air Force needs a central base to operate from. By opening an airport in our capital city of Yerevan, we can kill two birds with one stone: Our Air Force could use this airport as a headquarter for its operations and our government could use it to increase our import and export rates by opening it up to cargo planes."
 ARM_little_airship_specialisation: "Specialise on Smaller Aircraft"
 ARM_little_airship_specialisation_desc: "Just like our country itself, our industrial capabilities are quite small. Since we cannot afford to build resource-draining plane types such as heavy bombers or heavy fighters, we are more or less forced to specialise on smaller planes. However, we should not judge them by their size, since light fighters, reconnaissance planes, and the like can be just as valuable as larger aircraft if used correctly."
 ARM_airplane_workshop: "Building an Air Force"
 ARM_airplane_workshop_desc: "Obviously, an airport is not enough. The Armenian Air Force also needs planes in order to be able to conduct operations. The construction of workshops and factories specialised on producing and repairing airplanes fit for our military will guarantee that our pilots never run out of high quality aircraft."
 ARM_fortress_without_sky: "Defend the Armenian Skies"
 ARM_fortress_without_sky_desc: "Until now, we have focussed most of our defensive efforts on ground warfare and have mostly been building fortifications designed to counter infantry, artillery, tanks and suchlike. However, we also have to watch the skies and defend our cities from aerial bombardments, a goal which will require the use of stationary anti-air guns."
 ARM_aerial_reconnaissance: "Eyes in the Sky"
 ARM_aerial_reconnaissance_desc: "One of the most significant advantages of modern aircraft is that it can be used to spy on enemies from a safe distance. Reconnaissance planes, for example, are capable of gathering vital information without getting into firing range of the enemy on the ground. As Sun Tzu once said: \"He will win who knows when to fight and when not to fight.\" - and with our eyes up in the sky, we will always now when to fight."

 ### Naval Tree
 ARM_armenian_navy: "The Armenian Navy"
 ARM_armenian_navy_desc: "Not only have we managed to assert our independence against the might of the Ottoman behemoth, but we have also secured ourselves a coastline. From potential trading partners to a strengthened military presence, this has opened up a great plethora of possibilities for our fledgling state and vastly reduced our reliance on our neighbours. We may still have our work cut out for us, but soon enough, the Armenian Navy shall take to the seas!"
 ARM_protect_black_sea: "Protecting Our Waters"
 ARM_protect_black_sea_desc: "We have our coast and have laid claim to our waters. Now, it is time that we focus on defending what we have gained. The construction of a few coastal fortifications should already go a long way, but if we truly seek to protect our interests and project our military prowess on the seas, then we will have to build up a strong and capable navy. This will without a doubt be a costly and time-consuming endeavour, but the sooner we start, the earlier we'll be able to reap the benefits."
 ARM_naval_research: "Towards a Modern Fleet"
 ARM_naval_research_desc: "Though we were able to get a hold of numerous Ottoman naval blueprints after we declared our independence, they, too, are dated. They merely present us with a foundation that needs to be built upon, and our plans to defend our small portion of the seas cannot be realised if our ships are decades behind those of our neighbours. For our navy to stand a chance, it is paramount that we stay on top of the rapid technological developments made in the field of naval warfare."
 ARM_request_foreign_vessels: "Request Foreign Vessels"
 ARM_request_foreign_vessels_desc: "What we lack in industrial capacity can easily be made up for by our trustworthy allies. Unlike ourselves, they have a long history on the seas and proud naval traditions, so why shouldn't we use their knowledge, expertise, and industry to our advantage? After all, a few simple designs and vessels would already be a major help in kickstarting the Armenian navy, and it certainly wouldn't hurt our allies to provide us with them."
 ARM_commercial_navy: "An Armenian Merchant Marine"
 ARM_commercial_navy_desc: "Considering the size of our country and economy, we cannot hope to compete with the naval powers of our time and would only waste costly resources pursuing the production of ships geared for war. Instead, we should seek to foster our economic growth by exploring the mercantile opportunities that lie across the sea. For that, we are going to need to build up a navy fit for shipping and trade - an investment that will soon enough pay its dividends."
 ARM_open_up_market: "Open Up Our Market"
 ARM_open_up_market_desc: "When foreign entrepreneurs think of Armenia, they shall think of a young and nigh-untouched market, filled to the brim with potential for investments. Similarly, the nations of the world shall see us as a trustworthy partner with whom they'd happily conduct business. By loosening the restrictions on trade and investments, we can pave the way for economic cooperation that goes beyond our borders, to the benefit of our economy."
 ARM_refurbish_batumi: "Refurbish Batum's Infrastruture"
 ARM_refurbish_batumi_desc: "Given its proximity to the front lines, it should not come as a surprise that Batum has suffered under the weight of the recent war. Parts of its harbour have fallen into disrepair, the roads have seen better days, and the city's development stands halted. Given that Batum has quickly become one of the most important cities of the nation, we should divert the necessary funds to alleviate these problems and use this opportunity to link it up with the rest of our country."
 ARM_develop_dockyards: "A Navy of Our Own Making"
 ARM_develop_dockyards_desc: "In a feat as important as the creation of our own navy, we can rely on no one but ourselves. As funding has already been diverted to the research of new designs and technologies, it is now just the production of the vessels envisioned by our engineers that still needs to be realised. By expanding our dockyards, we can soon begin assembling a small but mighty fleet."
 ARM_naval_bombers: "Over Land and Seas"
 ARM_naval_bombers_desc: "Air superiority is beginning to play an increasingly larger role, not just in land warfare but on the seas as well. If we hope to protect our waters from foreign intruders, we cannot rely solely on our navy, lest our ships be sunken to the depths of the ocean in one swift attack from above. Thus, we need to expand our air force so that we can both protect our own ships and attack those of our enemies, allowing us to truly rule the waves."
 ARM_batumi_academy: "The Batum Naval Academy"
 ARM_batumi_academy_desc: "The Armenian navy is still young and our admiralty thus rather inexperienced. Whilst this problem cannot be solved in an instant, the opening of a naval academy will ensure that the Armenian admirals of tomorrow are ready for all that the sea might demand of them. After all, it is not just our ships but the brains behind them that have to defend our interests and bring honour to our name."
 ARM_trade_agreements: "Foster Trade Relations Across the Sea"
 ARM_trade_agreements_desc: "Even when confined to the Black Sea, there is so much that maritime trade has to offer for us. From Romanian oil and Ukrainian grain to the riches of Russia, our new coast grants us access to markets of great value, with the potential to greatly increase both the standard of living and the industrial capabilities of our country. All that's left for us to do is to reach an agreement with our maritime neighbours that will allow for the unhindered flow of goods across the sea."
 ARM_humble_profits: "Filling the Coffers"
 ARM_humble_profits_desc: "We may not be as rich in natural resources or as much of an industrial powerhouse as other countries, but still, we have managed to turn a profit from what we have. By exploring new markets to sell our agricultural produce and the ores once slumbering beneath Armenian soil, we have created a steady stream of revenue - and as long as it is sustained, the financial reserves of our nation shall never run dry again!"
 ARM_scourge_of_the_black_sea: "The Scourge of the Black Sea"
 ARM_scourge_of_the_black_sea_desc: "Modern naval warfare has many faces. Whilst the construction of larger ships would put an unbearable strain on our economy, keeping us from assembling a fleet in being, trade warfare is a strategy we can pursue. Smaller ships, striking our enemies where they are most vulnerable and retreating before their foe can retaliate. Soon enough, we shall make our enemies fear the waters that surround them!"

 ### Independence War
 ARM_War_of_Liberation: "The War of Liberation"
 ARM_War_of_Liberation_desc: "After living under foreign rule and oppression for centuries, the people of Armenia finally said: \"Enough!\". The decline of the Ottoman Empire and now the outbreak of the Desert War have rekindled the hopes for an independent Armenian state. However, if this dream of freedom and liberty is to be realised, we have to rise up and fight! For our families! For our future! For Armenia!"
 ARM_reinforce_erevan: "Fortify Yerevan"
 ARM_reinforce_erevan_desc: "If we want to win this war, we'll have to fortify our mountains and defend them whatever the cost may be. Building fortifications around our capital city of Yerevan will surely make this task much easier and save the lives of many young men."
 ARM_centralising_the_movement: "Centralise the Movement"
 ARM_centralising_the_movement_desc: "We cannot hope to win the war if every Armenian fights for himself. We can only win by fighting as one, united and centralised. In order to achieve this, the Armenian people will have to rally behind a central leader - and there's only one person suitable for this position: Nzhdeh."
 ARM_propaganda_campaign: "Organise a Propaganda Campaign"
 ARM_propaganda_campaign_desc: "Some parts of the population still have a rather sceptical attitude towards Nzhdeh and his government, fearing that they only act in their own interests, not those of the Armenian people. Launching a large-scale propaganda campaign could help remedy this issue whilst also raising support for our war effort."
 ARM_a_fight_until_the_end: "Fight until the End!"
 ARM_a_fight_until_the_end_desc: "Never again shall the Armenian people be subjugated by foreign invaders! For far too long, we have lived in agony under the boots of tyrants! We shall break these chains, now and forever, and even if we fail to achieve the Armenian dream, then we can at least give our lives for the country of our fathers!"
 ARM_organise_Dashnak_veterans: "Organise Dashnak Veterans"
 ARM_organise_Dashnak_veterans_desc: "The Dashnaks have fought in the name of the Armenian people for many years now. Even though this fight may not have been an open war but rather took the form of a resistance movement that launched a few small insurrections, the experience the Dashnaks have gathered throughout these years moulded them into great fighters that can withstand even the most superior forces."
 ARM_unite_the_fedayis: "Unite the Fidayi"
 ARM_unite_the_fedayis_desc: "The term Fidayi describes Armenian civilians who left their homes and families in order to protect Armenia from the barbaric and bloodthirsty Turks. Now that Armenia has become a real nation, we have to unite these Irregulars into organised troops in order to lay the foundations of a modern and professional army that can defend our beloved country."
 ARM_integrate_the_militias: "Integrate the Militias"
 ARM_integrate_the_militias_desc: "Now that the Armenian army has been officially established, we can begin to integrate the militia troops scattered throughout our country into a wider and better organised command structure. This will also allow us to use modern strategies on the battlefield, which will improve our chances of withstanding a potential invasion immensely."
 ARM_professionalize_the_army: "A Professional Army"
 ARM_professionalize_the_army_desc: "The core of every modern army is professionalism. Without discipline and proper training our soldiers will drop like flies and leave Armenia wide open to the enemy's forces. Let's bring our training methods up to today's standards and create an army that our people can be proud of!"
 ARM_the_saviour_of_armenia: "The Saviour of Armenia"
 ARM_the_saviour_of_armenia_desc: "In Armenia's hour of need, one man stood up to save the nation from its approaching enemies. One man decided to ignite a flame that neither the Turks nor the Russians or anyone else can extinguish. This man was none other than the heroic Nzhdeh, saviour of our nation."
 ARM_create_local_fedayis_units: "Keep the Fidayi Decentralised"
 ARM_create_local_fedayis_units_desc: "Throughout the last few decades, the Fidayi, irregular units composed of Armenian volunteers, kept our nation and our people save from the Turkish oppressors. Without their protection, the Armenian people probably wouldn't exist anymore. So why should we change something about the way they operate? Haven't they proven their efficiency already?"
 ARM_use_guerilla_tactics: "Use Guerrilla Tactics"
 ARM_use_guerilla_tactics_desc: "When fighting against a clearly superior foe, guerrilla warfare is by far the most efficient strategy to use. By ambushing our enemies where they would least expect it and by cutting off their supply lines, we can cause high casualties while suffering barely any ourselves. This will make the other nations think twice before attacking us!"
 ARM_call_for_people: "A Call to Arms"
 ARM_call_for_people_desc: "It is the duty of every Armenian man to protect his country in its time of need. Every additional man on the front lines could potentially tip the scales and turn the tide of the war. If we all work together to achieve our common goal of an independent Armenian state, we cannot fail and cannot be broken!"
 ARM_create_people_militia: "Mobilise the People"
 ARM_create_people_militia_desc: "Many men have heeded [ARM.GetLeader]'s call to arms and are just waiting to be equipped and deployed on the front lines. We should organise these new recruits into small militia groups that can act independently from each other and thus react quickly and decisively on enemy movements."
 ARM_coordinate_with_teheran: "Coordinate with Teheran"
 ARM_coordinate_with_teheran_desc: "We are not alone in our fight against the Ottomans. Indeed, nations from all across the Middle East have come together to finally rid the world of this rotten Empire. [PER.GetNameDefCap] is one of them. Even though there may be some discrepancies between us and the [PER.GetAdjective]s, it would be a wise move to coordinate our operations with them in order to defeat the Turkish beast."

 ### Political Trees
 ARM_free_once_again: "Freedom at Last"
 ARM_free_once_again_desc: "What has long been deemed impossible has finally come true. At last, our people have been freed from foreign rule and oppression, and the Armenian nation stands victorious over the Ottoman Empire. Though there is still much more to be done, today we celebrate our victory and mourn those we have lost."

 ### Tseghakronutyun Tree
 ARM_armenia_above_all: "Armenia above All"
 ARM_armenia_above_all_desc: "There is only one nation we truly have to care about: Armenia. Our people have proven their greatness time and time again throughout history, yet they are barely recognised for their bravery by other countries. Soon, they shall learn to respect us!"
 ARM_promote_identity: "Promote a National Identity"
 ARM_promote_identity_desc: "Large parts of our population speak the same language, share the same values and live by similar traditions, giving our people a sense of unity and cohesion. In accordance with the Tseghakronist cause, it is our duty to formalise this national identity and to promote it through any means necessary."
 ARM_armenian_ideal: "The Armenian Ideal"
 ARM_armenian_ideal_desc: "A good Armenian should be diligent, brave, deeply religious and, above all, obedient. If we want our people to embrace these traits, we'll have to promote them vigorously. Schools shall amend their curicula to teach our children the value of these qualities and posters promoting these ideals shall decorate the streets of our cities."
 ARM_first_christian_nation: "The First Christian Nation"
 ARM_first_christian_nation_desc: "Religion is one of the pillars of Tseghakronism. The trust our people put in the Armenian Apostolic Church is what held them together while our nation was under foreign occupation, and, with Armenia having been the first nation to officially adopt Christianity, religion has always been an important part of Armenian culture. Let us show the world what true Christians look like!"
 ARM_personality_cult: "Nzhdeh's Cult of Personality"
 ARM_personality_cult_desc: "Without Nzhdeh, Tseghakronism wouldn't exist. He was the one that led our nation through the dark and into the light. The entire country of Armenia owes him its freedom and liberty. It is about time that we make his status as a national hero official. Henceforth, all shall applaud the Armenian Eagle!"
 ARM_expansionism: "Armenian Expansionism"
 ARM_expansionism_desc: "If our nation is to prosper and flourish, we need to expand our borders, and if we have to invade other countries for that to happen, then so be it. Soon, we shall reign supreme in the Caucasus and beyond - and our people are going to reap the benefits of these conquests."
 ARM_revenge_against_turks: "Retaliation against the Turks"
 ARM_revenge_against_turks_desc: "Our history with the Turks is...difficult, to say the least. They enslaved our people for centuries and oppressed any form of resistance against their tyrannical regime. While we couldn't do anything about this for a very long time, the Turks have just taken a heavy beating and are now far weaker than ever before. It is time for our revenge..."
 ARM_recover_karabagh: "Reclaim the Highland of Karabakh"
 ARM_recover_karabagh_desc: "The region of Karabakh has historically been tied to our nation, but was wrongfully taken from us during the Caucasus Conference of 1919. Back then, we were in no position to fight this dictated peace and were forced to become subjects to the Sublime Porte. Now that we have regained our freedom from the Turks, however, we can finally take back what is rightfully ours."
 ARM_superiority_eternity: "Eternal Superiority"
 ARM_superiority_eternity_desc: "The Armenian people can truly be proud of themselves. All on their own, they have created an eternal state, one that can withstand the sands of time itself. Others may try to take away what we have achieved, but they will all fail and be forced accept that Armenia is here to stay!"

 ### Survival Party Tree
 ARM_safeguard_our_independence: "Safeguard our Independence"
 ARM_safeguard_our_independence_desc: "The utmost goal of the Survival Party has always been to secure the independence of Armenia. We will have to begin building fortifications, conscripting young men and preparing our soldiers for the inevitable. No enemy shall ever set foot on Armenian soil!"
 ARM_military_government: "Words Backed by Firepower"
 ARM_military_government_desc: "Our government is, naturally, heavily influenced by the military part of the coalition. While some radical republicans like to highlight the disadvantages of this, it also has many benefits. For example, our regime is less vulnerable to coup attempts, since the military can hardly coup itself. We should try to convince the wider public of the fact that a military government isn't as bad as it may seem on first glance."
 ARM_mountainous_stronghold: "Fortress Armenia"
 ARM_mountainous_stronghold_desc: "While the mountains of our nation give us a natural line of defence, they are not enough. We can't completely rely on nature to keep our enemies at bay. We are in need of strong fortifications, capable of withstanding enemy fire and bombardments, which will keep the Armenian people safe and secure."
 ARM_integrate_military_in_the_government: "Integrate the Military into the Government"
 ARM_integrate_military_in_the_government_desc: "Our military has become a natural part of our government. No longer shall these two institutions stay separated, it is time to unify them. This will allow the army to influence our politics even more, but also make it easier for the Dashnak part of the coalition to control this influence."
 ARM_sponsor_military_research: "Increase Military Research Funds"
 ARM_sponsor_military_research_desc: "With the military growing ever more influential, voices within the government advocating an increased allocation of funds to our institutes for military research have grown louder as well. Since there's no denying that advanced technologies and equipment would greatly increase the capabilities of our armed forces, we should heed their calls and begin altering our budget plans accordingly."
 ARM_dashnak_support: "Secure Dashnak Support"
 ARM_dashnak_support_desc: "While a large part of the Dashnaktsutyun support the Survival Party, there are still some members wishing for a change in government and the establishment of a true republic. We should show these people our good will and convince them that we are the only force strong enough to guarantee the independence of the Armenian state."
 ARM_revolutionary_idea: "The Revolutionary Idea"
 ARM_revolutionary_idea_desc: "While not fully being in favour of a Syndicalist system, the Dashnaks always wished for a moderate revolution in the economy. With their new position in the government, they can finally implement the changes they've dreamed of for years and show the workers of our country that no complete upheaval of the political system is needed in order to achieve a better life."
 ARM_a_new_social_system: "A New Social System"
 ARM_a_new_social_system_desc: "The Dashnaks not only want a moderate revolution in the economy, they also want to tackle our social system. From now on, equality and solidarity shall play a bigger part in the day-to-day life of the Armenian people. While not completely getting rid of the capitalist system, the Dashnaks also seek to reduce the importance of personal wealth in our society."
 ARM_protect_the_revolution: "Protecting the Revolution"
 ARM_protect_the_revolution_desc: "We have achieved a society that doesn't solely rely on capitalist or revolutionary doctrines. We have found a third way, one that unifies the advantages of both systems and compensates their flaws. We have to protect what we have accomplished, lest our society should take a step back into the last century."
 ARM_a_fight_for_our_survival: "Fight for our Freedom"
 ARM_a_fight_for_our_survival_desc: "We Armenians have always been brave people and have never feared a good fight. With our precious freedom being regained, we have a cause we can fight for more fiercely than ever before. History shall remember the stout-hearted Armenian soldiers fighting in the name of liberty against the tyrants of their time!"

 ### Boghos Bey Tree
 ARM_collaborate_with_turkey: "Reconcile with our Former Enemies"
 ARM_collaborate_with_turkey_desc: "Our people share a long history with the Turks, and many reserve a special kind of hatred towards them. However, if our nation is to survive, we need cordial relations especially with our more ambitious neighbours, and since the Turks have also experienced a change in government in the near past, they might be a good start."
 ARM_armenian_nationalism: "Bolster Armenian Nationalism"
 ARM_armenian_nationalism_desc: "Our people can and should be proud to be born Armenian. They share a rich history, a beautiful language and a common national identity. It is our duty to emphasise the importance and greatness of Armenian culture. After all, it is what sets us apart from the other nations and what defines both our country and our future."
 ARM_a_benevolent_people: "A Benevolent People"
 ARM_a_benevolent_people_desc: "Kindness, pride, humility, courage, benevolence and diligence - these are just some of the traits often associated with the average Armenian. We should show the world the good will and the overall greatness of the Armenian people by living in unity and harmony."
 ARM_promote_heroism: "Promote Heroism"
 ARM_promote_heroism_desc: "If it were not for the heroes of our independence war, we would still be subject to the vile Turks. If it were not for the heroes of democracy, Nzhdeh would have brought our nation death and destruction without opposition. Time and time again, our people have been saved by the heroes of the day, and now, it is time to encourage the heroes of tomorrow!"
 ARM_arrest_criminals: "Crack Down on Criminals"
 ARM_arrest_criminals_desc: "The social disorder and general chaos caused by the sudden outbreak of our independence war made it nigh impossible for our government to focus on hunting down lawbreakers, meaning that more often than not criminals, especially petty ones, would stay unprosecuted. This resulted in a wave of crime across our country - an issue that has to be tackled, if necessary even with the help of the military."
 ARM_reform_the_military: "Reform the Military"
 ARM_reform_the_military_desc: "Although our military might have been competent enough to win our independence war, this was only the case because the Ottomans were severely weakened and fighting a war on multiple different fronts. If we want to be able to stand on our own two feet, then we will have to reform our military, beginning with the leadership and high command of our armed forces."
 ARM_end_the_state_of_emergency: "End the State of Emergency"
 ARM_end_the_state_of_emergency_desc: "The state of emergency was declared to allow Bey and his followers to secure their new position as the government of the Armenian people. As it seems that there are no longer any threats to Bey's righteous rule, the end of the state of emergency should be proclaimed and other democratic parties reallowed."
 ARM_call_for_democrats: "Liberalise the Nation"
 ARM_call_for_democrats_desc: "It was always Bey's goal to liberalise and democratise the nation. Now that the state of emergency has been lifted, he can finally start to work on achieving this goal. The first step towards a more democratic and liberal nation is, in his eyes, the opening of public schools and the encouragement of foreign investments."
 ARM_social_reforms: "Enact Social Reforms"
 ARM_social_reforms_desc: "When it comes to our social system, our country is still severely lacking in multiple aspects. If we want to increase the standard of living across the nation, we'll have to carry out some major reforms. For example, we should guarantee the freedom of religion, make healthcare more affordable and simplify the administration."
 ARM_foreign_investments: "Attract Foreign Investments"
 ARM_foreign_investments_desc: "A steady influx of foreign capital is needed in order to prevent our economy from stagnating. Subsequently, the Ramgavar have now brought forward a proposal aimed at making investments in our industry more lucrative and attractive to foreign entrepreneurs by introducing tax cuts and diversifying our exports."

 ### Hunchak/Communists Tree
 ARM_first_popular_assembly: "The First Popular Assembly"
 ARM_first_popular_assembly_desc: "With the revolution being achieved, it is now the time to decide the future course of the country. Two main factions have formed: the Communists and the Hunchaks, both aiming to carry the torch of the revolution. We shall organise the First Popular Assembly, which shall decide who should lead our people into their glorious and prosperous future."
 ARM_hunchak_victory: "Victory of the Hunchaks"
 ARM_hunchak_victory_desc: "The Popular Assembly has concluded - and chosen the Hunchaks to carry on the revolution! The Hunchaks promised the implementation of social reforms, the expansion of workers' rights and the protection of the revolution no matter the cost. With them guiding the way, our nation shall become a beacon of socialism!"
 ARM_labor_rights: "Codify Labour Rights"
 ARM_labor_rights_desc: "We cannot accept that some of our countrymen have to live in poverty while working full-time. Even though the workers are the backbone of our country, they are being treated worse than slaves. From now on, child labour will be officially forbidden, a minimum wage specified and a maximum number of work hours in a week established."
 ARM_socialists_reforms: "Introduce Socialist Reforms"
 ARM_socialists_reforms_desc: "When it comes to our social system, our country is still severely lacking in multiple aspects. If we want to increase the standard of living across the nation, we'll have to carry out some major reforms. For example, we should guarantee the freedom of religion, make healthcare more affordable and simplify the administration."
 ARM_revolutionary_army: "A Revolutionary Army"
 ARM_revolutionary_army_desc: "Our main goal of protecting the revolution can only be achieved with the help of a well-trained and adequately equipped military. We shall reorganise our forces into the Armenian Revolutionary Army, implement new training methods and make the chain of command easier to follow and more efficient."
 ARM_communist_victory: "Victory of the Communists"
 ARM_communist_victory_desc: "The Popular Assembly has concluded - and chosen the Communists to carry on the revolution! This more radical faction has promised to completely reform the economy with an emphasis on a Marxist base and to take action against social inequality. Let's hope that they can achieve their goals and turn our state into the paradise Marx dreamed of!"
 ARM_collectivisation: "Begin the Process of Collectivisation"
 ARM_collectivisation_desc: "How can we call ourselves a nation of equals when there are still some using their property for their own gains and not for the good of society? We have to clamp down on these selfish people by collectivising major factories and landholdings and directly integrating them into the state economy. After all, even though they may not believe us, it is only for their own good!"
 ARM_nationalisation: "Nationalise the Economy"
 ARM_nationalisation_desc: "There is still a number of companies in our country trying to exploit the market for their own profit - disgusting and unacceptable behaviour! By nationalising these enterprises, we can guarantee that they only think about what is best for our country and our society while also controlling the implementation of workers' rights."
 ARM_marxist_guidance: "Marxist Guidance"
 ARM_marxist_guidance_desc: "As Marx once said: \"The meaning of peace is the absence of opposition to socialism.\" Through our reforms we have managed to achieve proper peace. Workers throughout the country live under proper conditions and know that their work contributes to the wealth and prosperity of our society. The principles of Marx have not only become a part of the Armenian life, they have also become a part of the Armenian heart."
 ARM_help_from_our_western_brothers: "Our Western Brethren"
 ARM_help_from_our_western_brothers_desc: "We are not alone in this world. To the west there are countries that had their regimes toppled in the wake of a Syndicalist revolution and are now looking to support like-minded governments all across the globe. Seeing how similar our ideologies are, they'll surely see us as a friend and grant us any support we need."
 ARM_revolutionary_vanguard: "Vanguard of the Revolution"
 ARM_revolutionary_vanguard_desc: "Technological advancements can make the difference between a failed state and a rising power. If our revolution is to survive these difficult times, we'll have to support the great minds of our country and grant them all the financial help they need for their research. They shall be the vanguard of our revolution!"
 ARM_export_the_revolution: "Exporting the Revolution"
 ARM_export_the_revolution_desc: "While our people live in heaven on earth, there are others in other parts of the world still suffering from their oppressive regimes. We aren't any better than those exploiting and suppressing these people if we just stand by idly doing nothing. We have to free those in need of our help from their chains! This revolution shall be a global one!"
 ARM_revolutionary_ideal: "The Revolutionary Ideal"
 ARM_revolutionary_ideal_desc: "We have achieved the ideal revolution. Without a need for bloodshed, we were able to completely change our society. Our people can live happy and untroubled lives without a capitalist upper class exploiting them for their own gain. We have become an example for nations from all around the world to follow."
 ARM_security_through_isolation: "The Lone Stronghold of Socialism"
 ARM_security_through_isolation_desc: "Our freedom has been paid for with the blood of Armenia's sons. Too many have perished already, and by joining forces with the wider Internationale, we would risk being drawn into an even deadlier conflict, one that could devastate our nation for years to come. Thus, we should look inwards and secure our revolution without drawing the ire of the reactionary forces surrounding our state."
 ARM_internal_dissent_crackdown: "Crack Down on Anti-Socialist Agitators"
 ARM_internal_dissent_crackdown_desc: "Though the Armenian revolution finds its legitimacy in the will of the people, there are still numerous traitors lurking within our borders, waiting for an opportune moment to rise up and topple our government. The threat they represent must be extinguished, lest the reactionary embers turn into an all-devouring flame that we cannot hope to escape."
 ARM_rapid_industrialisation: "Rapid Industrialisation"
 ARM_rapid_industrialisation_desc: "Though the nationalisation and collectivisation of our economy has already greatly improved our nation's industrial capabilities, we cannot stop now. We have to gather what funds we can and allocate them to our economic sector, constructing new industrial plants and improving our nation's transportation system in order to turn Armenia into the economic powerhouse of the Caucasian Mountains."
 ARM_unconquerable_stronghold: "Prepare for the Inevitable"
 ARM_unconquerable_stronghold_desc: "It is no secret that our neighbours have long been eyeing up our lands. Whether they strive for territorial conquest or desire to crush the revolutionary government, they pose a serious threat to our independence and prosperity. We have to rally our defences and prepare our soldiers for the oncoming onslaught - after all, time is of the essence and everything at stake."

 ### Armenian Republican Tree
 ARM_first_armenian_elections: "The First Armenian Elections"
 ARM_first_armenian_elections_desc: "Although Nzhdeh may have helped our nation survive our independence war, his political views are less than ideal and not fit for the ruler of our people. We need a democratic system, be it a revolutionary or a moderate one. It is time to hold the first Armenian elections! The people shall decide who should guide them into a better future!"
 ARM_caucasus_dream: "The Caucasian Dream"
 ARM_caucasus_dream_desc: "It was always the dream of the various Caucasian ethnicities to achieve freedom and liberty for their people. After centuries of struggle, the Armenian people finally managed to attain theirs and to establish an independent Armenian state. Now, it is time to defend what we have gained. The Caucasian dream shall not be crushed!"
 ARM_protect_national_integrity: "Maintain the National Integrity"
 ARM_protect_national_integrity_desc: "The Armenians are not alone in their struggles - they have each other. They can trust their fellow countrymen and their government. They know that every Armenian will stand up for them should they ever be threatened, and they know that their government does everything in its power to protect their rights and to provide them with the basis for a prosperous life."
 ARM_reconciliation: "Political Reconciliation"
 ARM_reconciliation_desc: "There are some parts of the opposition that don't view us as political allies trying to protect our precious democracy, but rather as enemies taking away their chance to rule the nation. However, it is important for the different democratic factions to hold together and radiate unity. We should try to reconcile with some of the parties sceptical of our political course."
 ARM_individual_innovation: "Individual Innovation"
 ARM_individual_innovation_desc: "One of the most notable advantages of liberalism is the concept of individual innovation. Because every person has to think for themselves, people will come up with new and sometimes ingenious ways to deal with common problems, allowing our society to become more efficient and productive overall."
 ARM_ramgavars_victory: "Victory of the Ramgavar"
 ARM_ramgavars_victory_desc: "The people have voted and the results are coming in! The Ramgavar, a party advocating liberalism and capitalism, has managed to secure a landslide victory. Under the protecting hand of this party, Armenia shall enter an age of individualisation and economic growth!"
 ARM_neoclassic_economy: "A Neoclassic Economy"
 ARM_neoclassic_economy_desc: "The neoclassic economic theory states that supply and demand can be brought in accordance with one another by letting the free market adjust the prices. Both consumers and producers try to defend their interests, leading to compromises which guarantee that the needs of both sides are satisfied."
 ARM_grant_property_right: "Protect Property Rights"
 ARM_grant_property_right_desc: "Every individual should have the right to use, sell, and alter their own economic goods according to their own liking. If we want to create a truly free and liberal state, we'll have to make sure that these property rights are protected, lest savage processes like nationalisation and collectivisation strip away the freedom of the individual."
 ARM_promote_the_individual: "Individualise our Society"
 ARM_promote_the_individual_desc: "While a certain feeling of cohesiveness and solidarity is needed for a state to function, we shouldn't let the development of the individual be restricted by a blooming group identity. Every person has the right to find their own way in life, to develop their own personality and to achieve their own personal freedom."
 ARM_christian_values: "Promote Christian Values"
 ARM_christian_values_desc: "Every person should have the right to shape their own life and to make decisions however they please. However, this has to be done in accordance with a moral codex if a peaceful coexistence shall be possible in our society. This moral codex can be found in the form of Christian virtues and teachings, that have already influenced the way our ancestors behaved centuries ago."
 ARM_moderate_dashnak: "Victory of the Dashnaks"
 ARM_moderate_dashnak_desc: "The people have voted and the results are coming in! Hoping for changes to the social system, the majority of our citizens decided to vote for the Dashnaks, a social democratic party promising to socialise the nation and to turn the day-to-day life of the average Armenian into something worth living for."
 ARM_popular_democracy: "Popular Democracy"
 ARM_popular_democracy_desc: "The entire point of democracies is to apply the will of the people to the nation's politics. This goal is best achieved by establishing a popular democracy, a more direct form of democracy based on popular referendums. This form of government will allow us to include every Armenian in the decision-making of the government."
 ARM_minimum_wage: "A Fair Minimum Wage"
 ARM_minimum_wage_desc: "The workers are the lifeblood of every society. Sadly, they are quite often also treated as dispensable resources and given only breadline wages. In a country in which the people are supposed to live freely and happily, this is unacceptable! A fair minimum wage will solve this problem and guarantee that every Armenian lives above the poverty line."
 ARM_marxist_approach: "Reconsider Marxist Ideas"
 ARM_marxist_approach_desc: "Even though we may not be a fully socialist country, there is still much to learn from Marx and his writings. Overall, his ideas weren't all that bad and could probably contribute to the wealth of our society if we manage to combine them with the modern capitalist economic system."
 ARM_social_economy: "Socialise our Economy"
 ARM_social_economy_desc: "The production of goods shall no longer be a private endeavour, but rather a collective one. Multiple people working together to achieve a common goal will always have a higher rate of success than the lonely individual. Furthermore, it will also boost the morale of our workers, since working in a group always sparks joy."
 ARM_democracy_in_orient: "The Beacon of Oriental Democracy"
 ARM_democracy_in_orient_desc: "Democracy as a concept hasn't really caught on in the Orient. While many of our neighbouring countries still applaud their monarchies and military regimes, we have managed to establish a stable and almost flawless democracy. We have become a shining beacon in the otherwise dark Orient, a guiding light for countries near and far!"

### Ideas ###
 ARM_unite_fedayi_idea: "United Fidayi"

 ARM_unite_fedayi_idea2: "A Modern Army"
 ARM_unite_fedayi_idea2_desc: "The command structure of our military has been modernised and professionalised. Just like the armies of Europe and North America, ours too now consists of well-disciplined and well-trained soldiers, ready to defend their homeland no matter the cost."

 ARM_separate_fedayi_idea_desc: "We have decided to maintain the separated nature of our Fidayi volunteers, which allows them to act independently and quickly. Furthermore, the requirements for joining these irregular units were kept relatively low, creating a broader pool of eligible recruits."

 ARM_separate_fedayi_idea2: "Fidayi Guerrillas"
 ARM_separate_fedayi_idea2_desc: "Our decentralised force is more than capable of waging an all out Guerrilla war.

 ARM_temporary_unity: "Temporary Unity"
 ARM_temporary_unity_desc: "Though the different political parties of our nation may not agree on everything, there's one thing that is of utmost importance for all of them: the independence of the Armenian state.

 ARM_destroyed_recovery: "Destroyed Economy"

 ARM_destroyed_recovery_1: "Slow Economic Recovery"
 ARM_destroyed_recovery_1_desc: "With the war being won, our economy is ready to begin the process of recovery. Though it will be a long and costly endeavour, the first steps in the right direction have already been taken, and our politicians seem confident that our economy will soon regain its former strength."

 ARM_social_chaos: "Social Chaos"
 ARM_social_chaos_desc: "Not only our economy, but also our people have been hurt by the war. There are countless Armenian souls who have lost everything: their job, their home, even their family. It is up to us to bring hope into their lives and to save them from falling into poverty."

 ARM_planned_economy: "Planned Economy"
 ARM_planned_economy_desc: "With every step of our economic recovery being planned by our government politicians, we can assure that resources are allocated where they are needed the most. Once our economy has fully recovered, we should furthermore plan our production in order to make sure that the needs of our people are met and no resources are being wasted."

 ARM_agrarian_development: "Agricultural Development Scheme"
 ARM_agrarian_development_desc: "Without farmers, our society could not exist. Seeing how reliant we are on them, it is only fair that we use a part of our resources to raise their living standards and to develop their means of production. This will also increase our agricultural output and thus reduce the risk of famines in the future."

 ARM_military_budget: "Rising Military Expenditures"
 ARM_military_budget_desc: "The only way to fully safeguard our independence is to maintain a well-financed military. With rising military expenditures comes more modern equipment, greater capabilities of our military facilities, and thus also a better chance for our nation to survive the wars to come."

 ARM_military_budget_2_desc: "$ARM_military_budget_desc$"

 ARM_vaccination_campaign: "National Vaccination Campaign"
 ARM_vaccination_campaign_desc: "Throughout history, plagues and diseases have been the cause of many deaths.

Soon, every Armenian will be vaccinated, and the mortality rate drop tremendously."

 ARM_national_army_idea: "The Armenian Army"
 ARM_national_army_idea_desc: "Just like our people, our army too is defiant, determined, and unbreakable. Our soldiers value the freedom of their country more than even their own lives, and will defend it fighting tooth and nail, side by side with their brethren."

 ARM_armenian_defiance: "Armenian Greatness"
 ARM_armenian_defiance_desc: "The Armenian people are known for their courage, their patriotism, and their iron will.

Now, this day has come, and our ancestors are smiling upon us."

 ARM_armenian_defiance_2: "The Armenian Identity"
 ARM_armenian_defiance_2_desc: "Our people are united by a common identity. They share the same values, speak the same language, and live by the same beliefs. However, above all, they share the pride in their homeland and the will to defend it against any foe that may threaten its independence."

 ARM_armenian_defiance_3: "Armenian Defiance"
 ARM_armenian_defiance_3_desc: "For centuries, the Turkish tyrants tried to shatter the will of the Armenian people, but they stood defiant and resisted.

 ARM_expansionism_idea: "Armenian Expansionism"
 ARM_expansionism_idea_desc: "For far too long, other countries have been able to push as around as they please because of our inferior numbers and lack of both strength and territory. It is time for us to evolve from simple prey to apex predators, and to acquire the land needed for Armenia to become a force to be reckoned with."

 ARM_expansionism_idea_3: "Greater Armenian Ambitions"
 ARM_expansionism_idea_3_desc: "As the state seeks to expand its borders, restoring the glory of the Armenian nation that was once deemed lost, the people must heed the calls of Nzhdeh and take up arms against their would-be oppressors. The path ahead may be difficult, but in the end, Armenia shall triumph and reign supreme forevermore!"

 ARM_armenian_youth: "Armenian Youth Movement"
 ARM_armenian_youth_desc: "The politicisation of our people has to start at a very young age, lest their minds be poisoned by western ideas. The Armenian youth movement will ensure that the younger generations stay loyal to the Eagle of Taron, whilst also organising free time activities and practical workshops."

 ARM_armenian_last_stand: "Armenia's Last Stand"
 ARM_armenian_last_stand_desc: "Although our independence has been secured for the moment, there are numerous countries eyeing up our lands. If we let ourselves get beaten now, the dream of an independent Armenian state might die with us. This is something we simply cannot let happen and have to prevent at all costs!"

 ARM_dashnak_contribution: "A Moderate Revolution"
 ARM_dashnak_contribution_desc: "Whilst the Dashnaks didn't accomplish the revolution the other democratic and revolutionary parties and their followers had desired, they still managed to pass reforms that greatly enhanced the standard of living across our nation."

 ARM_military_contribution: "An Army with a State"
 ARM_military_contribution_desc: "With the military command being integrated into the government structure, the leading cadre of our army is now capable of influencing the nation's politics to a great extent, allowing it to militarise the people and to prepare them for the wars to come."

 ARM_armenian_pride: "Armenian Pride"
 ARM_armenian_pride_desc: "Boghos Bey has managed to strengthen and to rekindle the pride of the Armenian people that has been suppressed for centuries. By emphasising the rich history and traditions that define the Armenian culture, his endeavours have successfully led to the birth of a national sentiment that won't be so easily banished from the Armenian minds."

 ARM_reformed_military_command: "Reformed Military Command"
 ARM_reformed_military_command_desc: "In modern warfare, a battle is seldom decided by the abilities of the individual soldier, but rather by the tactical knowledge of his superiors and the efficiency of the chain of command. Whilst the military command of our young nation had long been a rather chaotic mess, the government's efforts to rationalise the military hierarchy and organise the command structures have proven to be quite effective, thus greatly improving the capabilities of our armed forces."

 ARM_school_expansion: "Expansion of Schools"

 ARM_market_auto_regulation: "Selfregulating Market"
 ARM_market_auto_regulation_desc: "Time has shown again and again that the invisible hand of the market is entirely capable of regulating prices, demand and supply. By restraining from interfering in this natural order, we can also avoid the risk of damaging our economy unwillingly."

 ARM_protect_the_dream: "Protecting the Dream"
 ARM_protect_the_dream_desc: "The dream of a democratic Armenian state is no longer just a dream, it has become reality.

 ARM_minimum_wage_idea: "Fair Minimum Wage"
 ARM_minimum_wage_idea_desc: "In order for our people to be able to afford the things they need in their day-to-day lives, and in order for them to feel like their hard work is being valued by society, our government has implemented a minimum wage, one that is high enough to ensure that no working person will ever fall into poverty."

 ARM_mixed_socialist_economy: "Mixed Socialist Economy"
 ARM_mixed_socialist_economy_desc: "Although socialism has for a long time been bedevilled both by the populace and many politicians, it has some advantages.

### Events ###
 arm.1.t: "The War of Armenian Independence"
 arm.1.d: "For centuries, foreign invaders have ruled the Armenian people. The Russians, Persians, and Ottomans all thought they had a righteous claim on our lands, resulting in numerous border conflicts between these powers. Even though the Armenian territories generally enjoyed relative autonomy, the Armenians themselves were typically treated poorly by their occupiers. The Turks, in particular, viewed them as second-class citizens that needed to be 'Turkified'. This belief led directly to the Hamidian massacres of 1894-1896 and the Armenian massacres during the Weltkrieg. These atrocities bolstered Armenian nationalism and strengthened the resistance movements. While some of these organisations, like the Fidayi, who tried to defend Armenian villages from Turkish and Kurdish pillagers, mainly strived for autonomy and security, others, like the Dashnaks, demanded the establishment of an independent Armenian state.\n\nThis dream of a free Armenia became a reality in 1918. After the Russian Empire collapsed, the Armenians used the resulting chaos to secede. However, about a year after we declared independence, the regional powers convened a conference in Kostantiniyye. The result: the Ottomans, Georgia, and Azerbaijan were to carve up Armenia between themselves. This agreement was the final blow for the First Republic of Armenia, which lacked the strength to defend itself against its neighbours.\n\nStill, our people did not lose hope. They continued to wait for the day they would finally be free, with some retreating to Karabakh to continue the resistance there. With the Middle East rising against the Sublime Porte and the Turks struggling to hold their own against the Arab forces, it seems that this day has finally come. Today we say enough! Throughout the country, volunteers are organising militias, and Turkish garrisons are getting disarmed. It is time to show the Ottomans that we cannot be so easily broken! For Armenia!"
 arm.1.a: "We will not let this chance slip by!"

 arm.4.t: "Diplomatic Overtures From Lebanon"
 arm.4.d: "Despite its relatively small size, Lebanon is home to one of the largest Armenian diasporas in the Middle East. Seeking refuge from the Ottoman military during the times of the Armenian Massacres, thousands of Armenians fled the regions of eastern and southern Anatolia, and, with nowhere else to go, many made their way down towards Lebanon. There, they settled down mainly in the autonomous Mutasarrifate of Mount Lebanon, but also in surrounding cities such as Beirut and Jbeil. Because of the mostly welcoming nature of the locals, the migrants were able to integrate rather quickly, and Armenian culture is to this day seen as a valuable enrichment to life in the region.\n\nHaving just declared their independence after a devastating war against the Syrians, it could be said that the struggles the Lebanese people had to endure are very much comparable to those our own nation had to face in the past. They too saw themselves forced to hold their own against a much larger foe, and just like us, they stood triumphant in the end. However, now that the war has been won, Lebanon is experiencing the same downside of independence that we did: political solitude. Hoping to solve this problem, [LEB.GetLeader] has now reached out to our government and has expressed his wish to establish diplomatic relations between our two states. Seeing the cultural ties that bind our two nations and the benefits that future cooperation could bring, it should not come as a surprise that our government has already decided to accept this offer and to organise the establishment of a Lebanese embassy in our capital. We can only hope that this day marks the beginning of a great friendship between our nations."
 arm.4.a: "Two nations - one struggle."

 arm.6.t: "[ARM.GetNameDefCap] Is Mobilising Against Us!"
 arm.6.d: "A revanchist government under [ARM.GetLeader] has taken control of the newly independent Armenian state, and now seeks to reclaim the territories it considers righteous Armenian clay. Even though the Armenian claims on our territory are laughable at best, the historic ties between some of our provinces and the Armenian people seem to be enough of a justification for an invasion to them. Already, their troops are mobilising on our shared border, and it is only a matter of time until they are going to try to cross into our lands. We should prepare our defences and send this ultranationalist scum back to where it belongs!"
 arm.6.a: "They will be crushed!"

 arm.12.t: "The First Popular Assembly"
 arm.12.d: "The revolutionary coalition, consisting of the Hunchaks and the Communists, has won the first Armenian elections and thus paved the way for a true revolution and a better life for the Armenian people. However, now that power sits firmly in their hands, the Hunchaks and Communists have fully become aware of their vastly different opinions on many subjects, such as our economic and foreign policies. Still, the two parties stayed true to the revolutionary spirit and didn't let these differences drive a wedge between themselves. After some short debate, they managed to find a solution that could satisfy both of them: an Armenian Popular Assembly.\n\nThis assembly is to be held in Yerevan, where it shall decide which of the two factions should take the leading role in the revolutionary coalition and determine our nation's future politics. Representatives from all over Armenia have been invited and are currently pouring into our capital. While some of them are die-hard defenders of the Hunchak or Communist cause, many are still on the fence. This makes the outcome of the assembly rather uncertain and has encouraged political discussions and speculations in newspapers and cafes. It almost seems as if the entire population of Armenia is currently awaiting the first decisions of the assembly with bated breath. Soon, the revolutionaries will give their first speeches, the first major debates will be held, and the future of our nation will be decided."
 arm.12.a: "Revolutionaries! Assemble!"

 arm.13.t: "The Popular Assembly: Deciding on a Political Goal"
 arm.13.d: "The time has come! Today, the representatives of the revolutionary coalition shall come together and vote on what exactly the main political goal of the new government should be.\n\nThe more moderate Hunchaks argue that the backbone of Armenia, and every other country in the world, is the average worker. When he suffers, the nation suffers as well. Seeing how poorly our most hard-working citizens have been treated by the Ottoman administration and the first provisional Armenian governments, the Hunchaks deem it necessary to enshrine workers' rights in our constitution and thus improve the standard of living across our nation. After all, it is unacceptable for a modern and revolutionary nation to let its citizens work under the poorest conditions while receiving nothing but breadline wages.\n\nWhile the Communists agree with most of what the Hunchaks say, they want to go a step further and totally transform our country. According to them, capitalism has failed the Armenian people and should be heavily restricted. They advocate a more Marxist approach, one that can finally bring the Armenian citizens the equality and autonomy they have always strived for. Even though this may sound nice on paper, some Hunchak politicians have been openly questioning the effectiveness and necessity of such a radical approach, arguing that it would likely do more harm than good.\n\nBoth sides have spent the last few days vigorously defending their point of view, trying to persuade as many representatives as possible. Today, we shall see which of the two factions was more convincing."
 arm.13.a: "Workers' rights are of utmost importance!"
 arm.13.b: "We have to totally transform the country!"

 arm.14.t: "The Popular Assembly: Deciding on an Economic Goal"
 arm.14.d: "The next issue that the assembly should address is the question of our economic policy. Whilst the Hunchaks and Communists agree that our current economic system is not in a very good state and in need of some major changes, it is still open to debate what exactly these changes should look like.\n\nAs was to be expected, the Hunchaks are in favour of a more moderate solution. They argue that we can not only improve our economy, but also the standard of living across Armenia, if we manage to find the right balance between social and economic reforms. For example, affordable healthcare and a decent minimum wage could make the life of our citizens much easier, while progressive taxes and a redistribution of wealth and income could help achieve our goal of a classless society, in which the economy doesn't solely serve the upper class. Furthermore, these reforms would be rather easy to implement, and would only require a few new laws to be passed.\n\nMeanwhile, the Communists advocate a radical approach. In order to achieve true equality and a society in which egoism is an alien concept, they deem it necessary to collectivise and nationalise major companies and businesses. An economy controlled by the state could better meet the needs of the Armenian people and would ensure that wealth is spread equally amongst them, would however also strip entrepreneurs of their freedoms - a trade-off which the Communists are more than willing to take."
 arm.14.a: "Progressive reforms are the way to go!"
 arm.14.b: "Collectivisation and nationalisation shall bring us prosperity!"

 arm.15.t: "The Popular Assembly: Deciding on a Foreign Goal"
 arm.15.d: "The last point on the agenda of the assembly is the foreign policy of our nation. It is no coincidence that this issue was saved for last, as it is the subject on which the opinions of the Communists and the Hunchaks differ the most.\n\nThe Hunchaks think that it is necessary for Armenia to reorganise its armed forces into a revolutionary army, one that can defend our nation even against superior foes and will do whatever it takes to guarantee the survival of the Armenian state. To further emphasise the importance of the military for our freedom, the leader of the Hunchak party, Rouben Ter Minassian, gave a patriotic speech in front of the assembly, honouring our brave soldiers and highlighting the fact that Turks, Russians and Persians will soon seek to subjugate our nation once more - something we can only prevent by building an army worthy of Armenia and her people.\n\nHowever, the Communists argue that this goes too far. The creation of a revolutionary army would make our society militant and could be used by our neighbours to justify a preemptive strike against our nation. They think that we should just focus on our own affairs and try to keep a low profile. This could give us a chance to develop our nation without foreign intervention and to prosper and flourish peacefully and quietly, would however also put us in a rather vulnerable position."
 arm.15.a: "We need a revolutionary army!"
 arm.15.b: "We should focus on our own affairs!"

 arm.16.t: "The Communists Take Power"
 arm.16.d: "The First Armenian Popular Assembly has concluded, and the representatives are slowly starting their journey back home. After all the different issues had been voted on and the votes had been counted, a clear winner was determined: the Communists under Anastas Mikoyan. Their political goals and measures seem to have been well-received by the representatives and the people, as shown by the clear majority the party has managed to achieve. Shortly after this news had spread throughout the country, Mikoyan gave a speech on the radio. In it, he thanked the people for putting their trust in him and his party, and promised that his policies would bring Armenia the peace and prosperity it deserves.\n\nAlthough some expected the Hunchaks to be bitter about their loss, considering that they were the ones who brought the revolutionary ideas to Armenia in the first place and thus probably hoped to defend them in the future, the Hunchak politicians nevertheless seem relatively content with their new position in the coalition. Rouben Ter Minassian even congratulated Mikoyan on the victory of his faction, promising to support him in his endeavour to revolutionise the nation. Both parties appear to be as close as ever, and more than eager to bring about an Armenian revolution."
 arm.16.a: "Peace and prosperity for Armenia!"

 arm.17.t: "The Hunchaks Triumph"
 arm.17.d: "The First Armenian Popular Assembly has concluded, and the representatives are slowly starting their journey back home. After all the different issues had been voted on and the votes had been counted, a clear winner was determined: the Hunchaks under Sarkis Rouben Ter Minassian. As it seems, the representatives, and thus the people, do not want radical changes, but rather strive for moderate reforms capable of improving their living situation. In an address he gave to the press this morning, Minassian gave himself relatively unsurprised, saying that he had not once doubted that the assembly would choose the Hunchak party to lead the nation. Still, he thanked the people for their support and promised to bring them equality and liberty.\n\nWith the moderates now setting the agenda, the more radical Communists seem to be a tad bit disappointed. Though they still think that the Hunchak reforms won't be enough to truly change the Armenian nation for the better, they refrained from openly questioning the decision of the assembly and promised the Hunchaks their continued support. With the Hunchak-led coalition now guiding our way, peace and prosperity have become imminent!"
 arm.17.a: "A great future lies ahead!"

 arm.18.t: "Armenia Requests Industrial Support"
 arm.18.d: "[ARM.GetNameDefCap], a fellow socialist nation tucked away in the Caucasus Mountains, is struggling to build up an industry that can satisfy the needs both of its people and its military. Hoping to receive some foreign support from the Internationale, the Armenian government has requested our assistance with their economic buildup. Considering our economic might, sending a few engineers and materials to our friends in need certainly wouldn't hurt us. Still, some have argued that we need our resources elsewhere, and that they would be wasted in Armenia. While this may be somewhat true, we can't just turn our socialist brethren down, can we?"
 arm.18.a: "We will always help fellow socialists in need!"
 arm.18.b: "We need these resources ourselves!"

 arm.19.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Provides Industrial Support"
 arm.19.d: "Our socialist brethren in [FROM.GetNameDef] have decided to accept our request and to assist us in building up our industry. Already, the first material shipments have begun their journey from [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] to Yerevan, and a few engineers have arrived in our capital. Today, the Internationale has shown us that they can be trusted, and that solidarity among nations still exists, even in such difficult times."
 arm.19.a: "We knew our friends wouldn't let us down!"

 arm.20.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Refuses Our Request"
 arm.20.d: "Arguing that they need their resources themselves, the [FROM.GetAdjective] government has turned us down. The socialist solidarity that [FROM.GetNameDefCap] has always stressed seems to be nothing but a blatant lie, told to persuade the unknowing into trusting the pesky Internationale. It seems as if we are the only true socialists left on this planet..."
 arm.20.a: "This is outrageous! It's unfair!"

 arm.21.t: "The Remaining Collaborators"
 arm.21.d: "When our rebellion began, some officials loyal to the Ottoman Empire fled Armenia, fearing prosecution and imprisonment if they were to stay. However, there were also members of the administration and the military that simply switched sides at the beginning of the war, saying that they would rather live in a free Armenian state than in one dominated by the Turks. These men have thus far been able to keep the positions they held under Ottoman rule, partly because it would not be an easy task to replace them. Nevertheless, it appears that Nzhdeh, who has by now become a hero of the Armenian people with substantial influence, is all but content with this situation.\n\nArguing that these officials cannot be trusted because of their affiliations with the vicious Ottoman Empire, he has now begun to take matters into his own hands. Today, he ordered the imprisonment of every \"collaborator\" still on Armenian soil. Whilst this has raised some suspicion, seeing as his definition of a collaborator is relatively loose and encompasses every official that has served under Ottoman rule, there has been no real opposition to these orders yet. Throughout the country, officials are getting escorted out of their workplaces by the military, officers are being discharged, and prisons are starting to fill up. Although Nzhdeh promised that he is doing all that just to secure Armenia's independence and security, this move also, coincidentally, created a power vacuum that he can now easily fill by appointing his own officials loyal to his cause."
 arm.21.a: "A harsh but necessary step."

 arm.22.t: "The Collaborators Resist!"
 arm.22.d: "Although the arrest of the first wave of collaborators went off without a hitch, this was mainly because the military caught them off guard. By now, every Armenian knows of the prosecution of those that Nzhdeh branded enemies of the state. The remaining collaborators used the time they had to prepare themselves. Many of them went into hiding and have thus far been unlocatable. Since they can't just vanish off the face of the earth, it is suspected that they either fled the country, hoping to start a new life in their beloved Ottoman Empire, or have found refuge in the homes of Armenians willing to hide them from the eyes of the government. A few houses of friends and family members of the prosecuted have already been searched by the military, which has sparked some discontent, but has also resulted in the capture of some of the fugitives.\n\nNonetheless, a few collaborators have also been unwilling to leave their beloved home behind. Instead of hiding from the forces of the government, they chose to arm themselves. Our soldiers have by now reported almost a dozen instances of former officials opening fire on them. Luckily, none of our soldiers have been killed thus far, though some have been seriously injured. What makes these incidents alarming is the fact that almost all of the guns used by those resisting the arrest were weapons that could commonly be found in the Ottoman military. Either the collaborators stole them from the stockpiles we have captured from the Ottoman garrisons, or they still have contacts within the Empire, looking to fuel resistance against Nzhdeh's rule. Either way, we should try to disarm and imprison these traitors as quickly as possible."
 arm.22.a: "They just had to make this hard..."

 arm.23.t: "Nzhdeh Declares the State of Emergency"
 arm.23.d: "Arguing that our nation needs a strong and united government to survive the oncoming Ottoman onslaught, Nzhdeh and the leadership of the military have decided to proclaim the state of emergency, effectively centralising the power of the state around themselves. This gives them the freedom to rule without taking the opposition into account, to pursue whatever policies they please, and to take any measures they deem necessary to save the Armenian nation from its total annihilation. To pacify those who believe this is nothing but the disguised establishment of a dictatorship under military rule, Nzhdeh assured that he would lift the state of emergency once the war has been won and the dust has settled.\n\nWhile there are parts of the population that aren't satisfied with this promise, fearing that Nzhdeh and the military officers will grow too attached to the power they now possess, the majority of Armenia is quite content with this development. In Nzhdeh, the people see a man that knows what has to be done. They see someone who takes action instead of making promises he can never fulfil. In him, they see a figurehead that can unify the Armenian people - a trait that is urgently needed in these trying times. However, it remains to be seen how far the support of the people really goes, and if it will last after the war has been won and Armenia's independence is no longer directly threatened."
 arm.23.a: "May they lead us to victory!"

 arm.24.t: "Nzhdeh Centralises His Power"
 arm.24.d: "Since Nzhdeh declared the state of emergency, he has ruled over our nation together with the military leadership. However, it appears that his position in the government did not fully satisfy him. He wanted to centralise power around himself instead of sharing it, and has been pushing the military further into the background whilst trying to keep it loyal to him. Today, his endeavours have finally borne fruit, as he has officially been proclaimed leader of the Armenian state with the blessing of the military leadership. Whilst this new title doesn't change too much on paper, seeing as he has been pulling the strings in the government for quite a while now, it has caused some uncertainty in the populace.\n\nAfter Nzhdeh was proclaimed sole leader of Armenia, two camps formed within our population. On one side, there are Nzhdeh's followers. They claim that he is the only one capable of leading the Armenian people into their future and that he will bring them their long-desired victory over the Turks. For them, Nzhdeh's takeover is justified by his abilities and certainly nothing to be worried about.\n\nOn the other side, there are those sceptical of Nzhdeh and his regime. This camp mainly consists of the democrats and revolutionaries that have been denouncing Nzhdeh's authoritarian ways ever since he returned to Armenia. They see him as a threat to the freedom and liberty of the Armenian people, fearing that he won't end the state of emergency after the war has been won and will instead try to cement his power even further. To prevent this from happening, the democrats now want to search for new allies in the military, the administration, and the government. If they manage to convince enough officials of the threat that Nzhdeh poses, maybe they can stop him from consolidating his rule. But are they willing to risk attracting Nzhdeh's wrath?"
 arm.24.a: "We have to gather allies against this authoritarian numbskull!"
 arm.24.b: "He is the only one that can rule over our people!"

 arm.25.t: "Democrats Demand a Place in the Government"
 arm.25.d: "Ever since Nzhdeh returned to our nation, the democrats have seen themselves slowly lose power and influence. Until now, they have accepted this development, hoping that Nzhdeh would lead our nation to victory if they granted him the freedoms he desires. However, they are all but content with how the situation turned out. In their eyes, Nzhdeh has thus far not only used his powers for the good of the Armenian people, but also for his own personal gains - something that they deem unacceptable. In order to regain their influence in our nation's politics, the Dashnaks and the Ramgavar, the two main democratic parties of our country, have issued a joint request in which they demanded a place in the new government.\n\nWhilst Nzhdeh is in no way obliged to accept this request and could very well turn the democrats down, a few of his associates have pointed out that this may not be the best idea. After all, we are currently fighting a war against the Turks and should try to stay united at least until the conflict has been resolved, lest we collapse under the weight of our internal struggles. Furthermore, we don't have to give the democrats the most influential positions. Even a few smaller and non-important ones could satisfy them and guarantee that they stay loyal to Nzhdeh and his political course."
 arm.25.a: "We accept their request."
 arm.25.b: "They just seek to undermine Nzhdeh's influence!"

 arm.26.t: "We Stand Victorious!"
 arm.26.d: "The day our people have been waiting for for generations has finally come! We have beaten the notorious Turks and driven them out of our lands! While they weep and mourn for their losses, the people of Armenia celebrate, for they can now once again live in freedom and liberty. However, this victory came at a cost. Many young Armenian men lost their lives, our economy has been utterly destroyed, and the Turkish part of our population is beginning to migrate to Anatolia, fearing suppression and persecution under their new Armenian overlords. Still, these losses shouldn't ruin the good mood of the people, at least for the moment. After all, our economy can be rebuilt, our soldiers knew that they gave their lives for something worth fighting for, and citizens loyal to the Turkish state would only corrupt our young nation.\n\nNonetheless, there have also been some rather unpleasant developments in our nation's politics. While celebrations are still taking place across the country, the different political parties of our nation have already begun falling out with each other. With our triumph over the Turks, there's no longer an immediate threat unifying our politicians, leading to them now once again fighting for their own interests. The democrats and revolutionaries have demanded free elections in order to replace Nzhdeh, arguing that he is no longer needed and his continued rule illegitimate. Meanwhile, Nzhdeh is trying to hold on to his power, saying that his victories have earned him the right to rule over the Armenian people. Seeing the differences between the two sides, it seems nigh impossible for them to reach an agreement. Our victory has turned our government into a powder keg waiting to explode."
 arm.26.a: "Let's see what the future will bring."

 arm.27.t: "The Formation of the Survival Party"
 arm.27.d: "A few days back, Garegin Nzhdeh surprised Hovhannes Kajaznuni, the leader of the democratic Dashnak party, by inviting him to a private conversation in his personal residence. While the exact content of their discussion remains unknown, the meeting lasted almost the entire night, and ended with Kajaznuni being convinced of Nzhdeh's good intentions and his capabilities as the leader of our nation. This change of mind animated Kajaznuni to better Nzhdeh's image within the ranks of his party, leading to the Dashnaks officially deciding to form a coalition with Nzhdeh's military junta. This coalition, which has the main political goal of safeguarding the independence of the Armenian state, has adequately been nicknamed the 'Survival Party'.\n\nWith the arguably most influential part of the democratic opposition now on his side, Nzhdeh has effectively cemented his power, with no other political faction being strong enough to challenge his rule. Naturally, the other democratic and revolutionary parties were all but content with the decision of the Dashnaks, and have branded them 'traitors to the democratic cause'. Still, the Dashnak part of the newly-formed coalition tried to get on their good side, promising progressive reforms in the economy and the Armenian social system, and arguing that an alliance with Nzhdeh was a necessary step to ensure Armenia's continued independence.\n\nFor the population, this news has been a blessing. Nzhdeh's experience and qualities as a leader and the democratic views of the Dashnaks seem to be the perfect ingredients for a prosperous Armenian state. The people trust the Survival Party, and expect nothing but peace, freedom, justice and security under their new leadership."
 arm.27.a: "Together they shall safeguard our independence!"

 arm.28.t: "The Birth of Tseghakronism"
 arm.28.d: "As Nzhdeh returned to Armenia, he realised that none of the established political parties were fully capable of representing his political views. For him, the revolutionaries and democrats are weak for seeking to legitimise their rule through elections. Furthermore, some of these parties think that we should reconciliate with our neighbours and make friends of them - something that Nzhdeh views as another sign of their weakness. Because of his dissatisfaction with the current Armenian political scene, he has begun looking to other countries for inspiration. One that managed to catch his eye is the Russian behemoth to our north. Under the leadership of [RUS.GetLeader], Russia has taken a nationalist stance and managed to regain parts of its former glory.\n\nIn Nzhdeh's eyes, [RUS.GetLeader] is the leader the Russians have always dreamed of, and is someone whose example we should follow. In accordance with the Russian rhetoric, Armenia too should strive for unity through the power of nationalism. Nzhdeh's goals of ridding our nation of those that seek to destroy it and renewing the national and spiritual identity of our people have become the centre of his new ideology, which he named Tseghakronutyun or Tseghakronism, essentially translating to 'race and religion' - two concepts which Nzhdeh wants to turn into the pillars of our society. Already, people throughout Armenia are announcing their support for Nzhdeh and his new ideas, and are rallying behind the 'Eagle of Taron', the central icon of Tseghakronism."
 arm.28.a: "Interesting..."

 arm.29.t: "Democracy Prevails!"
 arm.29.d: "With the war being won, many people feel that Nzhdeh is no longer needed. Whilst his skills as a military leader may have contributed greatly to our recent victory, a large part of the population questions his capabilities as a leader during times of peace, and is now beginning to turn to the democratic parties. These parties have also not been inactive, and have been gathering support among the common folk, but also in the administration and the government. With virtually all of Armenia standing behind them, they were able to borderline force Nzhdeh to concede and to accept that elections should decide the future of our nation. Until then, he will keep his position, promising to keep order until the elections have come to a conclusion and a clear winner has been determined.\n\nThroughout the country, the preparations for the first Armenian elections in over twenty years have begun, and the people are excited to be able to choose their nation's government once again. From now on, Armenia shall be considered a shining jewel of liberty and democracy in the otherwise so sinister lands of the Caucasus and the Middle East."
 arm.29.a: "Our future lies in the hands of the people!"

 arm.30.t: "The Final Step"
 arm.30.d: "Ever since the birth of Tseghakronism, Nzhdeh and his followers have been working on turning this new ideology into the central political agenda of the state. By now, most of the soldiers and officers that have served under Nzhdeh during our independence war have joined the new organisation, arguing that he has shown his qualities as a leader and that his ideas will bring Armenia the glory it has always desired. With the support of the military, Nzhdeh was able to cement his power without any opposition from the democratic parties, who have by now become too irrelevant to pose a threat to the new regime. Because of this, Nzhdeh has decided that they should not be outright dissolved, instead allowing them to continue to operate within the country. Still, with elections being frowned upon by the Tseghakronutyun, these parties have no real chance of ever coming to power.\n\nThese new political developments have, however, raised some uncertainty within the population. Although most of our citizens trust Nzhdeh, many view his new political course with scepticism. In particular, the minorities within our borders, such as the Azeris and the Turks, are now fearing for their rights and their lives. In an address Nzhdeh gave to the nation this morning, he once again promised to take any steps necessary to ensure the continued survival of the Armenian people and gave his word that he would rid our country of all those who stand in the way of his rule and his promised prosperity - a promise that has only fueled the fears of both the minorities and the opposition. It remains to be seen if the people will trust Nzhdeh to the end, or if their fear will lead them to divergent paths."
 arm.30.a: "The Eagle of Taron shall guide our way!"

 arm.31.t: "The Election Campaign Begins"
 arm.31.d: "Elections are drawing ever closer, and the two contesting coalitions have now begun to use their resources for election advertising. In order to convince the people of their political goals and agendas, both camps are now sending their most prominent politicians to radio stations and newspapers. With the help of these modern media outlets, they can appeal to the entire nation with ease.\n\nThe democratic coalition, consisting of the liberal Ramgavar and the social democratic Dashnaks, has a relatively wide base of supporters, containing entrepreneurs, intellectuals, and to a lesser extent also the common workers. Since the democrats are certain that the middle and upper classes rather dislike the thought of a revolution, they take the support of this part of the population for granted. Hence, they decided to focus their advertisement efforts on the lower classes of Armenian society, promising that the mild reforms advocated by the Dashnak party will bring the people prosperity, whilst also claiming that the promises of the revolutionaries will do more harm than good.\n\nMeanwhile, the revolutionary coalition, which is made up of the Hunchaks and the Communists, is also trying to convince the lower classes of their policies. They denounce the democrats as hypocrites, and argue that the liberals only seek to represent the interests of the capitalist upper class, not the hard-working men of Armenia. In a radio speech he held this morning, Anastas Mikoyan, the leader of the Communist party, emphasised the necessity of a total revolution, one which will cause a complete social upheaval and bring the workers of our country the rights and riches they desire.\n\nWith both factions fighting over the votes of one class, the workers and farmers of our country now essentially find themselves in the position of kingmaker. Soon we shall know which side was more convincing in the eyes of the common folk."
 arm.31.a: "Truly exciting!"

 arm.32.t: "The First Armenian Elections"
 arm.32.d: "Finally, the waiting is over and the first Armenian elections since the rebirth of our nation have begun! This morning at around 8 a.m., the polling stations were opened and immediately thereafter stormed by a crowd of Armenian citizens eager to determine the future of their nation. Over the course of the day, the polling stations were almost constantly filled with people - the voter turnout was immense. Now that the day is nearing its end and everyone that wanted to participate in the vote has cast their ballot, the polling stations are beginning to close down. The first stations have already reported the results of the election in their area, but for now there seems to be a rather fragile balance between the revolutionaries and the democrats, with both sides having gained around half of the votes. Still, this will most likely be subject to change, as the largest polling stations have not yet finished the process of counting the ballots. The tension and excitement can be felt on both sides - but in the end, there can be only one winner."
 arm.32.a: "The democratic coalition stands victorious!"
 arm.32.b: "The revolutionaries achieve a landslide victory!"

 arm.33.t: "Electing a President"
 arm.33.d: "The democrats have managed to win the elections, and celebrations are still ongoing even after a week! However, our politicians did not just sit back and throw a party - they also began addressing the issues that came with their victory in the election. For example, we cannot pursue the political agendas of both the Dashnaks and the Ramgavar, but rather have to choose whose policies we should put our focus on. To that end, it has been decided that an election committee consisting of politicians from the Dashnak and Ramgavar parties as well as some neutral statesmen shall be formed. This election committee will choose a candidate from either the Dashnak or Ramgavar party for the post of president, who shall then set the course of our nation and decide on the policies that will lead our people into their future.\n\nBoth parties have already determined their candidates. The Dashnaks have chosen Hovhannes Kajaznuni, a man known throughout the country for his service as prime minister of the First Armenian Republic during the closing stages of the Weltkrieg. He is an advocate of social reform and, in contrast to the Ramgavar, thinks that at least some revolutionary ideas should not necessarily be frowned upon by our government. The Ramgavar, on the other hand, have chosen Mihran Damadian, a former resistance fighter who believes in more liberal policies and the power of the free market. After both candidates gave a speech highlighting why they should be elected president, there were some debates and discussions among the members of the committee, but now it seems that they've managed to come to a conclusion. The first president of the Second Armenian Republic will be..."
 arm.33.a: "The famous Hovhannes Kajaznuni!"
 arm.33.b: "Mihran Damadian from the Ramgavar party!"

 arm.34.t: "The Armenian Legislative Elections"
 arm.34.d: "With [ARM.GetLeader] now being chosen as our president, the only thing missing for our newly formed republic to be fully functional is a parliament. To that end, our president has decided that the people should once again get to participate in our nation's politics, and has now opened the polling stations in order to let the people vote on which party they want to see have the upper hand in the young parliament. Each party will receive a certain amount of seats based on the amount of electoral districts in which it managed to gain a majority, with some of these districts being worth more seats than others, based on their population. Although this election will not directly determine the political course of our nation in the future, since that has already been decided in the presidential election, it will still give the winning party a significant increase in influence."
 arm.34.a: "The Dashnaks take the lead!"
 arm.34.b: "The Ramgavar manage to secure a majority!"

 arm.35.t: "The Reclamation of Batumi"
 arm.35.d: "With the Ottoman Turks still unable to put an end to our relentless advance, we have now finally reached the port city of Batumi, and with it, the beautiful shores of the Black Sea. Founded by the ancient Greeks centuries before the birth of Christ, the practically ancient city has switched hands several times in recent history between the Russians, Georgians, and Ottomans. As such, Batumi is nowadays home to a plethora of different cultures and religions, including an Armenian minority, with Georgians, however, forming a slight majority.\n\nThough the Ottoman garrison stationed in the city fought fiercely until the bitter end, they did not have time to destroy or evacuate all that could be of use to us, allowing our soldiers to confiscate a handful of convoys stationed in the city's harbour, with a number of Armenian civilians even volunteering to join our fight against the Ottoman Turks. More important than the spoils of war, however, is that Batumi finally gives our nation access to the seas beyond our mountainous home.\n\nBecause of this, and because the Georgians have thus far refused to join the war and are thus not in a position to enforce their claim on the city, some have suggested we should lay claim to Batumi ourselves. Although we could naturally veil our true motives for this under the guise of wanting to protect the local Armenian population from the Turkish brutes, and although control over the city would bring our nation great benefits, claiming it would surely anger the Georgians - and might even tempt them to strike at our nation should our ownership of the city become official. Furthermore, our current rule over Batumi is still shaky at best, and the Ottomans will without a doubt soon launch a counter-offensive, especially considering that we have not yet found the time to properly entrench our positions. How should we proceed?"
 arm.35.a: "We shall have our access to the sea!"
 arm.35.b: "We should not risk angering the Georgians..."

 arm.36.t: "Nazar the Brave"
 arm.36.d: "A few days back, the Yerevan Film Studio blessed our nation's cinemas with the release of a new movie: Nazar the Brave. This comedy was written by Derenik Demirchyan and Amasi Martirosyan, and is based on the popular folk tale that goes by the same name. Because the story is loved and known throughout the country, our people have been awaiting the movie for a while now and were more than eager to watch it on the day of its release.\n\nThe movie tells the story of Nazar, a lazy and cowardly man who has more luck than judgement. One day, he jokes about robbing the caravan of a Shah passing nearby, but his wife takes him seriously and demands that he stays true to his word. Although he wants to chicken out of it at first, he later gets annoyed by some flies and manages to kill a thousand of them with a single swat. This gives him courage, and the village priest thereafter gifts him a rag on which he wrote 'Nazar the Brave, who fear does not know, kills a thousand with a single blow!'. Confident in his abilities, Nazar then sets out to find the Shah, and through sheer luck manages to outsmart a bandit, whose horse he then takes with him. Then follows coincidence after coincidence, eventually leading to Nazar's name being known and feared throughout the world - and not just that, he also kills a dangerous tiger, becomes king of a realm of giants, marries a giantess, and lives happily ever after.\n\nThe movie was well-received, and people are calling it both hilarious and exciting. Overall, it appears to be a good distraction from the shocking news coming from other parts of the world, and could very well become a classic that our people will still watch decades from now."
 arm.36.a: "A fantastic story!"

 arm.37.t: "Meat and Ice Cream"
 arm.37.d: "Since he took office, Anastas Mikoyan has gone on several business trips to numerous western countries, hoping to boost economic and diplomatic relations between our nations. Whilst he had only mild success in achieving this goal, the time he spent in these countries, or rather in their restaurants, inspired him to bring new western-style food to our nation, namely corn flakes, popcorn, hamburgers, and ice cream, the latter being especially important to him.\n\nTo ensure our citizens always have access to the best ice cream, the government has, at the recommendation of Mikoyan, sponsored the construction of the first Armenian ice cream factory, which is to be built in our capital city of Yerevan. Mikoyan also plans to keep the quality of our domestically produced ice cream under his own personal control, arguing that he knows best what makes it delicious. Furthermore, he invented a new kind of hamburger beef patty, the so-called 'Mikoyan Cutlet'. He promised that this cutlet, which is made from beef or pork, would keep the burgers affordable for the common folk and make Armenian hamburgers something unique and outstanding, maybe even something known throughout the world.\n\nAlthough some are beginning to joke about Mikoyan's obsession with food and especially ice cream, a large part of the population welcomes these changes to the Armenian diet. For them, they are something exciting and out of the ordinary, and also give a feeling of a more westernised and modern lifestyle. This reaction of the populace has strengthened his belief in the importance of the right nourishment and has now even encouraged him to write a book on the topic of healthy and tasty food."
 arm.37.a: "Truly delicious."

 arm.38.t: "An Age of Oppression"
 arm.38.d: "With the Tseghakronutyun growing more powerful and influential by the day, the only thing they are still afraid of is losing their power. Hence, Nzhdeh decided that certain measures would have to be taken in order to ensure the survival of the new regime.\n\nThese measures, which Nzhdeh described as 'necessary evils that will safeguard the prosperity of the Armenian nation', are mostly aimed at restraining the freedoms and liberties of the Armenian people. Especially concepts such as freedom of speech and freedom of thought are being disregarded and have been declared 'poisonous to the integrity of the state'. From now on, all newspapers will be controlled and strictly censored by the Tseghakronutyun. Publishing critical literature or spreading pamphlets criticising the government has now officially been declared a crime and will be punished severely. In order to ensure that the people understand that this should not be taken lightly, the party also ordered the expansion of most Armenian detention facilities, hoping that increasing their capacities will scare the Armenian people away from critical thought and bring even the most die-hard defenders of democratic values into the fold."
 arm.38.a: "So it begins..."

 arm.39.t: "The Expulsion Act"
 arm.39.d: "As it seems, the measures currently in place were just the beginning of Nzhdeh's efforts to shatter any resistance against the government. In his eyes, some people currently living inside our country will never be loyal subjects to his regime, and should thus be considered enemies of the state.\n\nToday, he introduced the 'Expulsion Act'. With this act, he wants to rid the nation of these 'Takanks' in order to bring our people stability and unity. It states that 'every Azeri and Turk is to leave the territory of the Armenian state within the span of three weeks. Should they refuse to leave within the given time span, the military will be authorised to expel them from their homes. Should they not comply, usage of force is permitted.'\n\nNaturally, this has sparked outrage among the Muslim population of the country, since Turks and Azeris alike now see themselves being prosecuted in the lands both they and their ancestors once called their home. However, the act did not only shock the Muslim parts of our population. Many Armenians are beginning to ask themselves if Nzhdeh really does what is right and if the expulsion of people they value as neighbours, friends and colleagues really is a necessary step to safeguard the future of the Armenian nation. Many still hope that Nzhdeh heeds the calls of the populace and decides to revoke the act before it unfolds its consequences, though a decision like this seems highly unlikely, especially since most of the military still blindly follows his orders and supports him and his measures without questions."
 arm.39.a: "Why can't men just live together in harmony?"

 arm.40.t: "Massacre in Yerevan"
 arm.40.d: "Today, the streets of the Pink City ran red. Agitated by one of Nzhdeh's speeches, in which he emphasised the need for an omnipotent state, some of his devoted followers saw themselves as invested by a mission to do something about the ever-denounced 'enemies within'. In their eyes, those still seeking to undermine the influence of the Tseghakronutyun could be found in prisons, where former Ottoman administrators are still held, and in the streets, where a demonstration by Muslim citizens was organised against the Expulsion Act.\n\nArmed with improvised weapons and a few firearms, the fanatics stormed the capital's prisons and fell upon the peaceful protest. What followed was nothing short of a slaughter. As the demonstrators fled throughout the streets, many were pursued and felled: bystanders who tried to shield them from the violence, sheltering them in their homes, or simply attempting to stand between them and the mob, can be counted among the casualties. In the prisons however, it seems that the guards simply stood aside, some even joining in, as resent against the Turks runs high. As for Yerevan's garrison troops, they remained idle: many of them are receptive to Nzhdeh's rhetoric and believe that protecting Muslim or prisoner lives is not part of their duty. When night fell, dozens laid dead, and many more were injured.\n\nNews of the massacre spread throughout the country like wildfire. In an emergency broadcast addressing the tragic situation, Nzhdeh attempted to shift the blame on the victims, described as conspirators, only blaming those he suggested were merely animated by 'patriotic fervour' for taking justice in their own hands. This narrative seldom convinced those who are not entirely in the grasps of the regime, however: for many, this was the last straw. Faith in Nzhdeh among our people is beginning to crumble, and resistance to the government is organising rapidly."
 arm.40.a: "What a tragedy..."

 arm.41.t: "Democrats Protest against Nzhdeh's Policies"
 arm.41.d: "It appears that Nzhdeh's latest measures, and especially the massacre of Yerevan, have caused the democratic parties of our country to lose all faith in the Tseghakronist movement. Today, these parties issued a joint statement, in which they declared Nzhdeh responsible for the recent bloodbath and openly demanded his resignation and the introduction of free elections on Armenian soil. Furthermore, some of them also took to the streets of the capital, and organised a memorial march to honour the victims of the massacre. However, this march became increasingly political as the number of participants increased, and ended up as an open protest against Nzhdeh's regime.\n\nSensing a threat to their rule, the Tseghakronutyun responded swiftly by ordering the military to break up the 'violent demonstration against the saviours of Armenia'. Still, Nzhdeh felt that this was not enough. He decided to go even further, and has officially decreed the dissolution of all political parties and organisations not integrated into the Tseghakronist movement. By stripping away their last political powers, he hopes to silence the remaining politicians of the opposition once and for all."
 arm.41.a: "Will this be the last we hear from them?"

 arm.42.t: "The Democrats Return"
 arm.42.d: "After the banning and dissolution of their parties, the democrats found refuge in the countryside, a region not yet entirely in Nzhdeh's grasp. In their exodus out of the capital and other major cities, they were joined by some lower-ranking military officers, the most prominent of them being Boghos Bey Dadian, a former Ottoman colonel who pledged allegiance to Armenia and her people during the Desert War and has grown increasingly uncontent with Nzhdeh and his rather extreme policies. Once they no longer found themselves in any immediate danger, they began forging plans, hoping to topple the Tseghakronist government that has 'destroyed' their once so lovely country. During this time, Boghos Bey more or less officially assumed leadership of the opposition group, mostly because both the democrats and the common folk put their trust in him and his experience as an officer, confident that he could lead them to victory against the Tseghakronist regime.\n\nAfter spending some weeks gathering support and perfecting their plans, the democrats have now decided to come out of hiding and to march on to the capital. Before the news of their return could spread throughout the country, they arrived in Yerevan, where many joined their ranks before the Tseghakronutyun had time to react. In no time, they had a substantial force, consisting mainly of the common folk of our capital, on their side. As they begin their march towards the centre of the pink city, Nzhdeh is trying to organise a defence and has ordered the military to shoot anyone trying to threaten his 'righteous rule'. Since the democrats and their followers are mostly armed with improvised weapons, save for the few soldiers and officers supporting them, the army could probably prevent their coup attempt with ease. However, a large part of the city's defenders are beginning to question their own motives and are asking themselves whether they are still standing on the right side, and if the democrats really are the evil Nzhdeh makes them out to be. Today, the allegiance of these men will decide the fate of our nation."
 arm.42.a: "The army's allegiance is to democracy!"
 arm.42.b: "Nzhdeh's influence over the army stands."

 arm.43.t: "The Fall of the Eagle of Taron"
 arm.43.d: "Given the hunger for power and thirst for blood Nzhdeh and his followers have demonstrated over the course of the last few months, it probably shouldn't come as much of a surprise that most of the soldiers stationed in Yerevan have realised that they are steering Armenia and her people towards certain doom - and that Tseghakronism is an evil that must be destroyed now before it's too late. Nzhdeh's order to open fire on their fellow countrymen was the last straw. Instead of heeding his commands, the garrison units turned on him and joined the protestors in their march towards the centre of Yerevan. The last soldiers loyal to the Tseghakronist cause soon found themselves outnumbered and outgunned, and were forced to lay down their arms.\n\nAs the democrats, now with the support of both the military and the civilian population of the capital, drew ever closer to the National Assembly, the Tseghakron politicians present there acknowledged the hopelessness of their situation and surrendered without putting up much of a fight. Whilst they were deemed 'traitors to the state' and placed under house arrest until trials could be organised, Nzhdeh was nowhere to be found. It is speculated that he has somehow managed to escape the capital, presumably with the aid of the last few staunch supporters of his cause, and is now trying to find refuge in exile.\n\nStill, Nzhdeh's whereabouts are not of great concern to Bey and his supporters as of now, as they have achieved their goal: they have toppled the Tseghakronist government and can now pursue a different political course, one that isn't nearly as extreme as that of the Tseghakronutyun. With the backing of the people, the military, and the democratic politicians, Boghos Bey Dadian, leader of the coup, has taken leadership of the nation and now plans to fulfil the promises Nzhdeh made to the people and to bring both peace and prosperity to Armenia."
 arm.43.a: "The Armenian people welcome their true saviour!"

 arm.44.t: "The Tseghakronutyun Triumph Once Again!"
 arm.44.d: "Although some voices within the garrison of Yerevan stated their concerns about Nzhdeh's orders and his policies in general, they were quickly silenced by the giant wave of support for the Tseghakronist cause within the military. Heeding Nzhdeh's commands, the soldiers stopped the protestors advancing towards the centre of the capital, albeit they still refused to open fire on the civilians that joined up with the democrats. However, Boghos Bey and the soldiers accompanying him were deemed traitors to the state, a danger to the stability of the Armenian nation, and overall too dangerous to be left alive. Without any need for further orders from Nzhdeh, his loyalists fell upon these 'traitors' - and at the end of the day, Boghos Bey, a once famed and respected officer of our armed forces, laid dead in the streets of the city, killed by the men he thought would assist him in his endeavour to end Nzhdeh's rule once and for all.\n\nAs the fighting between Yerevan's garrison and Bey and his soldiers started, the crowd that promised the democrats their support quickly dispersed, fearing that they might otherwise be caught up in the crossfire. The democratic politicians that organised the coup attempt laid down their arms shortly after their leader was killed, and have by now been put in prison for their crimes against the government. With the leaders of the former opposition now being forced to spend their remaining days in dark cells, isolated from the rest of the country, the last major resistance movement against the Tseghakronist government has been crushed. Now all that is left is a general feeling of discontent among the populace, but this will likely fade away if Nzhdeh manages to fulfil his promises and to restore Armenia to its former glory."
 arm.44.a: "The Eagle of Taron stands eternal!"

 arm.45.t: "The Seven Tseghakron Cults"
 arm.45.d: "The Seven Tseghakron Cults are a concept introduced by Nzhdeh, aimed at teaching our people what it means to be a good Armenian. Emphasising the value of the Armenian nation, these cults will from now on be taught in schools and propagated in newspapers and over the radio. This way, Nzhdeh hopes that he can guide both the younger and older generations in the right direction and turn them into loyal subjects to his cause.\n\nThese seven cults are: 1.The Cult of the Motherland, emphasising the importance of the land on which the Armenian culture first came into being, and promoting devotion and worship of said land. 2.The Cult of Blood, highlighting the spiritual and bodily traits that define the Armenian people, and set them apart from other cultures. 3.The Cult of Language, which forbids our people from learning or speaking any language other than their mother tongue, since this would accelerate the death of the beautiful Armenian language. 4.The Cult of the Fallen, which says that one should not forget those who gave their life in the name of Armenia and her people. Because of our recent independence war, which saw countless Armenian men dying on the fields of honour, this cult is especially important to Nzhdeh. 5.The Cult of our Ancestors. This cult declares that there is a spiritual connection between the different generations of our people, and that this connection ensures that the eternal flame of the nation and thus our sacred traditions will be passed from one generation to another. 6.The Cult of Power, which says that only those who are strong and brave will survive this cruel world. 7.The Cult of our Leader, Nzhdeh. The Armenian people may not question him or his decisions, and should instead trust him to fulfil their destiny."

Since the newly established revolutionary Armenian government found itself in a relatively isolated position amongst the otherwise mostly reactionary nations of the Orient, they requested entrance into the [ROOT.GetFactionName], and thus voiced their wish to assist the workers' revolution on a global scale.

With our entry into this alliance comes a newfound security for both our government and our people, and also the chance to assist our allies in spreading the revolution across the globe. Together, we will free humanity from its self-imposed chains!"
 arm.47.a: "For the revolution!"

 arm.48.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Denies Our Request"
 arm.48.d: "Claiming our country would be nothing but a resource sink and a dead weight if allowed entrance into the Third Internationale, the [FROM.GetAdjective] government has turned our request down. We can only hope that the reactionary forces surrounding us don't interpret our political solitude as a sign of weakness, since an invasion from one of our neighbours could very well be the end of the Armenian revolution..."
 arm.48.a: "Our situation is looking dire..."

 arm.49.t: "[ARM.GetNameDefCap] Requests to Join the Moscow Accord"
 arm.49.d: "Ever since its declaration of independence, [ARM.GetNameDef] stood relatively isolated from the other nations of the Caucasus and the Middle East. Hoping to remedy this, the Armenian government has approached us with a request: they want to join the Moscow Accord. Whilst they promised to also assist us in our endeavours across the globe if we were to accept their offer, some voices within our government are strictly against the idea of forging an alliance with the Armenians, since this would mean acknowledging the independence of a country which once belonged to the mighty Russian Empire, and would thus also force us to give up our claim on the region. We have to ask ourselves what's more important to us: reclaiming the entirety of the Caucasus, or making new friends to our south."
 arm.49.a: "We are stronger together!"
 arm.49.b: "Armenia is a part of Russia, not its friend!"

 arm.50.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Approves Our Entry"
 arm.50.d: "Citing that friendship between nations is more important than old and long-forgotten claims on a region whose people never wanted to be a part of Russia anyway, the Russians accepted our request and approved our entry into the Moscow Accord. With the Russian bear now guarding our north, no one can threaten us!"
 arm.50.a: "We knew the Russians could be trusted!"

 arm.51.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Rejects Our Proposal"
 arm.51.d: "It appears that the Russians have not forgotten that Armenia too was once a part of the Russian Empire. Citing this laughable claim on our lands as their reason, they decided to turn down our request to join the Moscow Accord. This more or less confirms that they are currently planning an invasion of our country - and should this prediction be true, we will probably be outnumbered and outgunned heavily. If we want to survive, we should start working on our defences..."
 arm.51.a: "Uh-oh..."

 arm.55.t: "[ARM.GetNameDefCap] Petitions to Join the Reichspakt"
 arm.55.d: "In the hopes of finding new allies that can protect the Armenian nation from any country that might threaten its sovereignty, [ARM.GetLeader] has approached our government, and has requested for Armenia to be allowed entry into the Reichspakt. Although accepting the Armenian request might be a liability, seeing as the nation has just recovered from a bloody war and could probably use some more time to rebuild, it would also further undermine Russian influence in the Caucasus, which is something we just can't say no to, can we?"
 arm.55.a: "They're more than welcome!"
 arm.55.b: "Do we really need them?"

 arm.56.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Accepts Our Request"
 arm.56.d: "The German government has decided to accept our request, and has welcomed us in the Reichspakt with open arms! Although the Germans likely just want to contest the Russian influence in the region, this is still fantastic news, and will hopefully deter our neighbours from ever setting a foot on our land."
 arm.56.a: "Together for victory!"

 arm.57.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Declines Our Offer"
 arm.57.d: "Probably thinking that we are too small of a country to contribute anything of significance to the efforts of the Reichspakt, the German government has declined our offer to join their alliance. We can only hope that they don't plan on attacking us in the future..."
 arm.57.a: "What a shame..."

 arm.58.t: "Construction of the Tsitsernakaberd Memorial"
 arm.58.d: "Almost exactly 25 years ago, the history of the Armenian people took a tragic turn, as, on the 24th of April, 1915, the Armenian Massacres began with the so-called 'Red Sunday'. Incentivised by the Tehcir Law, the Temporary Law of Deportation, the following years saw much of the historical Armenian territory outside of the mountains of Yerevan almost entirely 'cleansed' of its original inhabitants, as many of those who were not 'resettled' by the Ottomans decided that fleeing the Empire was their best bet. Naturally, most of our population has not forgotten this terror.\n\nEarlier this year, as the 25th anniversary of the 'Red Sunday' was drawing ever closer, a group of intellectuals felt that it was about time to properly honour the victims of the massacres, and came to the government with a proposal: the construction of a memorial site on the hill of Tsitsernakaberd in the centre of Yerevan. According to their proposition, this memorial should both \"be dedicated to the Armenian martyrs of the Weltkrieg\" and \"symbolise the renaissance of the Armenian people\", and thus not only serve as a way to remember the past, but also show that a better future is coming.\n\nDespite the broadness of the proposal, our government was quick to accept it and to provide the necessary funds, as the Armenian Massacres are a rather important subject for our common folk and our politicians alike. With the support of some engineers, a more exact plan was drafted, and as of now, it was decided that the monument should consist of two parts: a large stele, symbolising the rebirth of our people and the future they have ahead of them, and a circle made up of several slabs, representing the provinces of western Armenia lost to the Turks. Furthermore, the circle shall house an eternal flame in its centre, aimed at both honouring the victims of the massacres and representing the flame in the hearts of our people that will never be extinguished."
 arm.58.a: "A fine initiative, but a tragic anniversary."

 arm.59.t: "Etchmiadzin, the Armenian Vatican"
 arm.59.d: "In the city of Vagharshapat, only a few kilometres to the west of our capital, lies the Cathedral of Etchmiadzin. Built in the fourth century by Gregory the Illuminator, the saint who brought Christianity to our lands by convincing King Tiridates III to abandon the pagan ways of old and to embrace the cross, the cathedral has long become the centrepoint of the Armenian Apostolic Church, serving as the seat of the Catholicos of All Armenians for centuries now. Furthermore, with Etchmiadzin being one of the oldest cathedrals in the world, it should not come as much of a surprise that it is also a major pilgrimage site, attracting Armenian faithful from all around the world. Because of its age, it has also been renovated multiple times throughout the years, and thus nowadays combines architectural styles from various different ages, giving the cathedral not only religious, historical, and cultural, but also architectural significance.\n\nDespite all this, however, Etchmiadzin was not spared by the war, and was hit by artillery shells and bombs on multiple occasions throughout the conflict, forcing the Catholicos to relocate to Yerevan for the time being. Seeing the turrets of the cathedral begin to crumble has understandably been a hard blow, not just to the clergy and the citizens of Vagharshapat, but to the entire country and to the Armenian diaspora abroad as well. This tragedy has not gone unnoticed by our politicians, and with our government already undertaking major endeavours to rebuild the country, it has been decided that the restoration of the cathedral, too, should be state-funded. This news has been well received, especially by the church, and many are now looking forward to seeing Etchmiadzin shine in new glamour, even if it might take some time for the restoration to complete."
 arm.59.a: "A worthwile investment."

 arm.60.t: "A Lonely Hike"
 arm.60.d: "During an exercise in the western mountain ranges of our country, a group of soldiers noticed a lone man in a ragged military uniform slowly making his way towards the peak of a nearby mountain without acknowledging the military unit observing him from afar. Intrigued by the sight and eager to find out why he was wearing the clothing of an Armenian infantryman, our soldiers decided to approach the stranger. As they gradually caught up to him, he elected to ignore them no longer, and instead stopped his hike, sat on the ground, and waited. After a few minutes, they finally reached the man, and after a short breather, they asked him for his story and what he was doing all alone out in the mountains. He sat still for a second, but then he began to explain himself.\n\nA volunteer for the army during the War of Independence, the man was stationed on our southern border with the Turks. One night, during which he was supposed to guard the encampment of his unit, he simply dozed off, and, as fate would have it, the Turks launched a surprise attack on his position only a few hours later. Woken up by gunshots and screams, his fear got the best of him, and he ran from the ongoing battle, leaving his comrades to be routed by the enemy.\n\nThough thinking of his own survival as nothing less than a miracle, the man has not forgiven himself, and his cowardice haunts him to this day. Unwilling and unable to return to the military, he instead decided to find his peace in the quiet of the Armenian mountains, and is now wandering from peak to peak and travelling through the land, hoping to find insight and forgiveness in his self-imposed solitude."
 arm.60.a: "Let us hope he finds his peace."
 arm.60.b: "His cowardice needs to be punished! He shall stand trial!"

 arm.61.t: "The Excavation of Teishebaini"
 arm.61.d: "Following a trail of various different artefacts and inscriptions that have been found in recent years, a group of archaeologists has managed to uncover what is probably one of the most significant archaeological discoveries in the entire Middle East - the ancient fortress of Teishebaini. Located on Kamir Blur, the 'Red Mould', the ruins lie not far from our capital city of Yerevan. Thus far, only parts of the central citadel, a few smaller buildings, and a cemetery have been uncovered, but our archaeologists are certain that much more lies buried beneath the earth, just waiting to be dug up, and some information regarding the fate and history of the town has already been unveiled.\n\nTwo different cuneiform inscriptions mentioning Rusa Argishtihini, also known as Rusa II, king of the ancient realm of Urartu, have been found and have led to the assumption that the fortress was constructed during his reign, which would in turn mean that the site dates back more than two and a half millennia, to the seventh century BC. Spanning from eastern Anatolia and north-western Persia all the way to the Armenian mountains, the kingdom of Urartu is believed to be one of the earliest predecessors to the first Kingdom of Armenia, and Scythian arrowheads that have been found within the ruins of Teishebaini have reinforced the theory that the decline and eventual fall of the kingdom was caused by a devastating war against the Scythians. As for the fortress itself, it can currently only be speculated how exactly it was destroyed, but several charred items hint at a fire razing it to the ground."
 arm.61.a: "Who knows what more there is to uncover."

 arm.62.t: "A New National Anthem?"
 arm.62.d: "With our independence being secured for the moment and the political situation slowly stabilising, our government can now turn its attention to some less pressing issues. One of those is that our country is still lacking an official national anthem, something that every modern nation should have. Though our politicians agree on the criteria of a good anthem, that it should be easily recognisable and represent our people and their values, there have thus far been several proposals on which song fulfils these criteria best, and no clear winner has been determined yet.\n\nThe obvious and probably also the most popular choice would be 'Mer Hayrenik' or 'Our Fatherland', a song which was already adopted as the national anthem of the first Armenian Republic after the Weltkrieg. Its text is based on an Italian poem and was written by Mikayel Nalbandian in the 19th century, with the music being arranged by Parsegh Ganatchian a few decades later. Highlighting the glory of our fatherland and our flag, and the honour our soldiers find in death, it is a very patriotic song and perfectly reflects the struggles our people have had to endure over the course of the last few decades.\n\nSome politicians are, however, arguing that we are an entirely new state, one that will succeed where the first Republic has failed. Subsequently, they are of the opinion that our anthem should reflect that, and that an entirely new song should be composed to represent our nation. Not wanting to stray too far from 'Mer Hayrenik', though, they still want to address the same topics whilst slightly shifting the focus from our past to our future and also covering the 'rebirth' our nation has recently experienced."
 arm.62.a: "Mer Hayrenik it is!"
 arm.62.b: "Change is needed, we shall compose a new anthem!"
 arm.62.c: "Let's compose one honouring Nzhdeh instead!"

 arm.79.t: "Return of the Armenian Diaspora"
 arm.79.d: "There are thousands of ethnic Armenians currently living abroad, in other parts of the Middle East and even in faraway lands such as Western Europe and the Americas. Whilst this has been the case for centuries now and our people have already been establishing settlements in regions such as Cilcia, Italy and Cyprus during the Middle Ages, an increasing number of them has left the region of Greater Armenia as a result of the crimes committed against them by the Ottoman Turks. Especially the massacres of the Weltkrieg convinced many Armenians that staying in their homeland was a risk not worth taking, leading to them leaving their country and seeking their fortune elsewhere, far away from their Turkish oppressors.\n\nEver since our nation reentered the world stage, there has been a steady influx of Armenian immigrants from all around the world seeking to repopulate their homeland, which they formerly believed to be forever lost to the Turks. However, many hesitated to return to the land of their ancestors, mainly because of the ongoing conflict and the feeling that Armenia's independence was immensely threatened by its power-hungry and ambitious neighbours. Now though, with us having won the war of independence and our sovereignty being somewhat secured, these doubts have cleared up, and the number of immigrants has skyrocketed. Although these immigrants thus far mainly come from the Middle Eastern nations, and most of our fellow countrymen currently living in Europe and the Americas have decided not to abandon their lives there, it's still a good sight to see that our people are slowly beginning to return to their home."
 arm.79.a: "Welcome to your homeland!"

 arm.80.t: "The National Academy of Sciences"
 arm.80.d: "Seeing our endeavours to fund the Yerevan State University, a group of scientists from various fields of profession, led by Joseph Orbeli, a well-known orientalist, has reached out to our government with a proposal. In order to improve the research capabilities of our nation, they deem it necessary to not only expand the existing institutions, but also to sponsor new ones. More concretely, they plan on founding the National Academy of Sciences. This new academy, which would be located in our capital city of Yerevan, would mainly focus its research on both science and social sciences, and would thus greatly complement the already existing University of Yerevan, which focuses mostly on the fields of history, economics and culture.\n\nWhilst the majority of our government seems to be in favour of accepting this proposal, seeing as it would probably be a rather efficient way to fund talented Armenian scientists, not everyone has been convinced, and there are also some questioning whether or not this is a rational allocation of our resources."
 arm.80.a: "They shall have their funds!"
 arm.80.b: "We have no resources to spare for their cause."

 arm.81.t: "Inauguration of the National Academy of Sciences"
 arm.81.d: "This week, it was finally time for the inauguration ceremony of the National Academy of Sciences to be held. This joyous occasion mainly consisted of a speech given by the academy's first president, Joseph Orbeli. In it, he emphasised his gratitude for the funds he and his fellow scientists received from the government, and spoke about his visions for the future. He dreams of the academy becoming a centre of attention for scientists from all around the globe, of major breakthroughs in the various fields focused on by the academy, and of Armenian science being on par with that of the Western countries. This rather ambitious speech was met with the thunderous applause of all those attending the ceremony, including the press, the academics who are going to conduct their research in the new facilities, and even some government representatives.\n\nAlready, some scientists have begun the preparations for their first experiments in the new facility; Joseph Obeli and a few government officials have started negotiations about new funds which could be used to expand the academy even further; and news of the inauguration ceremony has spread throughout the country. The overall reaction of the populace seems to be quite positive, and a general feeling of enthusiasm is spreading, for the people are hoping that this is the beginning of something truly great."
 arm.81.a: "Splendid!"

 arm.82.t: "Reform of Armenian Orthography"
 arm.82.d: "A few weeks back, leading figures of the Yerevan State University, the National Academy of Sciences and the Union of Armenian Writers came together in an endeavour to reform the Armenian language, more precisely its orthography. Ever since, the so-called 'Council of Armenian Orthography' has been working tirelessly, trying to find out how to make the Armenian language more phonetic and less complex. The goal of this endeavour is to create a language that is both easy to learn and to read. With this, the Council hopes to make the Armenian language more attractive to foreigners and to help solve Armenia's illiteracy problem.\n\nToday, the leaders of the Council presented our government with their proposed reform and requested for it to be both accepted and implemented throughout the country. Although it appears that they've tried to take a less radical approach at reforming the Armenian language, it is nevertheless to be expected that some of our people will be rather unhappy with the reform, seeing as it would replace the classical orthography, which many consider to be an important part of our culture. It is now up to us to decide what we value more: the opinion of some of our most educated citizens, or our time-honoured traditions."
 arm.82.a: "An excellent idea!"
 arm.82.b: "Reforms are overrated anyway."

 arm.83.t: "Armenia Proposes an Anti-Ottoman Pact"
 arm.83.d: "Having revolted against the Ottoman Empire shortly after we declared our own war against the Turks, the Armenians have now found themselves rather isolated from the main coalition against the Empire. Since we're more or less the only country in their reach, and a rather powerful one at that, [ARM.GetLeader] has approached our government and requested a meeting to be organised, which took place shortly thereafter in the city of Tabriz. There, government officials from Armenia presented our representatives with a proposal: cooperation in the form of an alliance between our two states, which should at least last until the Ottoman beast has been slain.\n\nThough this may sound like a good opportunity to better our relations with our new neighbour on paper, it is rather questionable how much Armenia could contribute to the alliance, and it could turn out to be a burden that would only pull us down. Still, it's most definitely an offer worth considering."
 arm.83.a: "Cooperation is the way forward!"
 arm.83.b: "They'd be a dead weight and nothing more."

 arm.84.t: "Dawn of the Tabriz Accords"
 arm.84.d: "After the [PER.GetAdjective] government agreed to meet with some of our government officials in the city of Tabriz, we presented them with our plans for military cooperation against the common Turkish foe. To our luck, it seems that the delegation sent by the [PER.GetAdjective] government was quite fond of the idea and probably wanted to forge a good relationship between our two states. Following some debate over a few minor details, an agreement was reached, the necessary documents were signed, and a new alliance between Armenia and [PER.GetNameDef] was born: the Tabriz Accords."
 arm.84.a: "Splendid!"

 arm.85.t: "Iran Refuses our Proposition"
 arm.85.d: "Calling our nation a 'dead weight' and a 'burden that would only pull them down', the [PER.GetAdjective]s have rejected our idea of military cooperation. This development can, of course, be seen as a major blow to our war efforts, and effectively means that we're cut off from the other nations fighting the Ottoman Empire."
 arm.85.a: "We'll have to survive on our own then."

 arm.86.t: "Allegiance to the Wrong Banner"
 arm.86.d: "In the midst of the night, our soldiers guarding our border with the Ottoman dogs all of a sudden noticed a number of lights approaching them from Turkish territory. Then, voices started growing louder, and our border guard naturally went on high alert, fearing the Turks might be conducting a surprise attack. However, just as our men were about to contact high command in order to receive new orders and to ask for reinforcements, the voices became audible enough to be understood. Unexpectedly, the approaching men spoke Armenian, and were now shouting at the border guards not to open fire on them. Since our soldiers remained sceptical, the strangers then laid down their arms as a show of good will, and one of them, with his hands high up in the air, slowly approached the border.\n\nAfter being searched thoroughly to check whether he posed a threat, he proceeded to explain what was currently happening. Apparently, he himself is none other than Boghos Bey Dadian, a famous Ottoman colonel of Armenian descent. He and the formerly Ottoman soldiers following his lead, who are also Armenians, deserted shortly after our rebellion began, unwilling to fight for an Empire actively suppressing their very own countrymen. Together, they organised a plan to cross the border and to take as much military equipment as they possibly could with them - and now they were here.\n\nUpon hearing this story and after ensuring that what they were told was true, the border guard let the men enter our country, and by now most of them have already enlisted in our armed forces, ready to partake in the fight for the liberty of Armenia and her people. As for Boghos Bey, he has found his way to the capital, where he has been promoted to the rank of general by the high command, so that the experience he has gathered in years of service under the Ottoman flag may be put to good use."
 arm.86.a: "They will make a fine addition to our armed forces."

 arm.87.t: "The Liberation of Kars"
 arm.87.d: "In mere weeks, we have managed to breach the puny Ottoman defences, and now, the advance of our valiant soldiers has reached the mountains and highlands of Kars, which have in turn been freed from the grasp of their Turkish overlords. This comes as a great victory to our people, as the region has strong historic ties to the Armenian nation. A millennium ago, under the reign of the Bagratuni dynasty, the city of Kars served as the capital of the Kingdom of Armenia, and although Kars was conquered by several outside powers since its foundation, including the Seljuk and Ottoman Turks, the region continued to be inhabited predominantly by Armenians - until the Weltkrieg turned the tides of history.\n\nServing as one of the main battlefields between the Russian and Ottoman forces during the conflict, the region was harmed greatly by the war, and its population was not spared from the horrors Ottoman troops inflicted upon those of Armenian descent. Fearing for their lives, many chose to migrate eastwards, making those that stayed behind a minority in their own home.\n\nNow, however, with us having liberated Kars, it seems that a new age of Armenian rule over the region is upon us. Following our advance, an increasing number of locals has revealed that they, in fact, identify as ethnic Armenians, but have been hiding their true identity out of fear of being persecuted by the Turks, with some even taking up arms and joining our army in the fight against their former oppressors. These fresh recruits, in addition to a number of arms plundered from the local arsenal, will aid our war effort considerably, and with Ottoman troops thus far unable to halt our advance, the dream of an independent Armenian state is slowly becoming reality."
 arm.87.a: "Ottoman defeat is imminent!"

 arm.88.t: "The Future of the Tabriz Accords"
 arm.88.d: "Our alliance with [PER.GetNameDef] has been of great aid to us in the war against the Ottomans, but most in our government had considered it a one-time deal, for who knows what other conflicts they may wish to drag us into.\n\nWe could amicably part ways, leaving the door open for future cooperation if they seek it, or we could stay with them and continue as a regional bloc."
 arm.88.a: "One war was enough, for now at least."
 arm.88.b: "We would do better sticking together."

 arm.89.t: "Collapse of the Tseghakronist Movement"
 arm.89.d: "Following the recent coup and Nzhdeh's subsequent disappearance, many have been anxiously awaiting news from the man once widely considered the 'saviour' of Armenia. By now, however, it seems that their long wait will not be rewarded, as, with every passing day, it becomes increasingly unlikely for Nzhdeh to return or for him to reveal that he has found refuge in exile. With more than a month having passed since the march on the capital, it is only natural that rumours about Nzhdeh's whereabouts are beginning to spread rapidly, the most believable of which being that he met his fate on his flight towards, presumably, Russia, be that at the hands of nature or of the men that had suffered under his rule.\n\nTrue or not, without the figure of Nzhdeh to rally behind, and with the atrocities they advocated and their failure to prevent Bey's coup, the Tseghakronutyun have by now largely lost popular support. Most Tseghakronist hardliners have been imprisoned by government forces or have chosen the path of exile, with Hayk Asatryan, one of Nzhdeh's closest associates and one of the leading ideologues of the Tseghakronutyun, now hoping to carry on the work of his paragon from beyond the seas and to foster the movement in the diaspora.\n\nMeanwhile, the Armenian National Liberation Movement had long been split between the autocrats under Nzhdeh's guidance and the democrats who opposed his radical views. With much of the military, however, having chosen to align themselves with Boghos Bey and thus the democrats, most militarymen once loyal to Nzhdeh have likewise used their chance to stand on the victorious side of the power struggle, and have promised the new government their continued support and loyalty. With Nzhdeh and his extremist forces thus having largely lost their footing in our country, it seems that the position of the new regime has been secured, and that the era of terror heralded by the Tseghakronists has become nothing but a relic of the past."
 arm.89.a: "Out of the darkness - and into the light!"

 arm.90.t: "Armenia Requests Military Equipment"
 arm.90.d: "A telegram from [ARM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] has just reached the capital, asking our government to supply the resurgent Armenian rebels with military equipment to ensure the continued survival of their newborn state.\n\nSeeing as the peoples of Armenia and Russia have over time grown almost fraternal, since our nation had in the past long presented them with a preferable alternative to the Turkish yoke, and considering that we already fought side by side with Armenian volunteers during the Weltkrieg, many politicians are arguing that it is our obligation to support the otherwise isolated Caucasian state with the equipment it needs. Furthermore, an Armenian victory over the Ottoman Turks would not only decisively weaken one of our greatest foes, but would also greatly increase our influence over the Caucasus Mountains, maybe even paving the way for an alliance between Yerevan and [RUS.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName].\n\nOn the other hand, refusing to support the Armenian rebellion would mean leaving our brethren to their fate. Nonetheless, there have also been voices in our government that deem the requested gun shipments a 'waste of resources', arguing that Armenia's chance of success is rather questionable as it stands and that we cannot afford to pointlessly sacrifice our military equipment at the moment, especially when taking our western border into account."
 arm.90.a: "They shall have their guns."
 arm.90.b: "We cannot spare anything at the moment..."

 arm.91.t: "Russian Equipment Shipments Arrive"
 arm.91.d: "Our brethren in [RUS.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] have elected to heed our plea for support and have promised to send military equipment to assist us in our struggle against the Turkish oppressors. These gun shipments, which are already well on their way to our capital, will allow us to arm additional volunteers for the fight against the tyrants of [TUR.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] - and, given the quality of Russian manufacturing when compared to the rather dated equipment of the Ottoman army, will likely guarantee that our soldiers keep the upper hand on the fields of battle."
 arm.91.a: "We welcome their support."

 arm.92.t: "Russia Refuses to Send Equipment"
 arm.92.d: "Citing that their military equipment is currently much needed elsewhere, the Russians have turned down our request for support in our war against the Ottoman Turks. It appears that the politicians of [RUS.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] care neither about the brave Armenian men giving their lives on the frontlines of this conflict, nor about the hardships our people will have to endure should the Turkish tyrants once again manage to subdue our nation."
 arm.92.a: "This is an outrage!"

 arm.93.t: "One Drink Too Many"
 arm.93.d: "Reports are still trickling in, and the story has yet to be fully unfolded, but here is what information is available to us at the moment:\n\nYesterday, a batch of fresh recruits decided to spend their evening at one of our capital's local pubs. There, they naturally enjoyed themselves, and as the hours flew by, countless glasses were emptied, refilled, and emptied again. They were, however, not the only guests present, and most definitely not the only ones getting drunk. As alcohol is known for loosening tongues, it was only a matter of time until someone said something they'd regret the day after, and, sure enough, shortly before the last call, the owner of a small store suddenly decided to climb on top of a table and publicly declare his deep-rooted hatred towards the revolutionary government, denouncing it as a host of tyrants and making some ... ugly remarks about [ARM.GetLeader], seemingly not noticing the soldiers present.\n\nAfter overhearing this blasphemy, they confronted the man, demanding he immediately apologise for his words. When he instead chose to insult our soldiers, calling them 'servants of the devils' and similar obscenities, the argument grew increasingly heated, until someone had enough. Though it is not entirely clear who's to blame as of yet, the situation escalated into a full-blown bar fight. By the time police arrived and were able to rein in the chaos, it was already too late. Two men, the store owner and one of his friends, were killed, and many more were injured. According to several witnesses, our men were to blame for their deaths, and, as such, they have for now been detained by the police.\n\nThe question now, of course, is how we should proceed. Their commanding officer has already requested they be let off scot-free, arguing that there isn't any concrete evidence of their guilt and that, even if they were to blame, they only defended the revolutionary cause - but should we really let this slide so easily?"
 arm.93.a: "Damn these drunkards - they shall stand trial!"
 arm.93.b: "Why should such unwavering loyalty to our cause be punished?"

Wishing to bury the hatchet with the Turkish people of [TUR.GetNameDef], the Armenians have called together a conference.\n\nOur presence at the conference would likely bring us both international prestige as the arbiter of peace, as well as additional allies in the region. Should we agree to mediate their conference?"

 arm.103.d: "At our meeting, the Armenians have put forward harsh demands from us. We must fully accept responsibility for the massacres and mass deportations carried out under the Ottoman Empire, primarily during the early years of the Weltkrieg. They are also asking for monetary compensation that they feel they are owed for the atrocities committed in the region by the Ottoman Empire against their people over the past half century."

 arm.105.t: "[ARM.GetNameDefCap] Compensated By [TUR.GetNameDef]"
 arm.105.d: "A great victory has been won for the Armenian people! [TUR.GetNameDefCap] has agreed to compensate us monetarily for their actions in the early years of the Weltkrieg. Already, plans are being drawn up to build memorials dedicated to the lost towns of Armenia."
 arm.105.a: "A small comfort for our people."

 # uses 105.t
 arm.106.d: "This conference has brought a great diplomatic victory to [ARM.GetNameDef]. [TUR.GetNameDefCap] has agreed to acknowledge responsibility and compensate [ARM.GetNameDef] for the actions undertaken by the Ottoman Empire during the early years of the Weltkrieg."
 arm.106.a: "Some measure of justice has been served."

 arm.107.t: "[TUR.GetNameDefCap] Refuses To Compensate [ARM.GetNameDef]"
 arm.107.d: "We have been scorned at the peace table. We came forward with a just request, yet still were rebuffed by the Turks who refuse to admit responsibility for the massacres that happened to the Armenian people. Additionally, they have rejected our request for monetary recompensation, as hollow as that demand was for those affected, it was still too much for [TUR.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] to bow to."
 arm.107.a: "A dark day for Armenia."

 # uses 107.t
 arm.108.d: "Justice has been withheld from the Armenian people. [TUR.GetNameDefCap] has refused to accept their role in the massacres in Armenia and beyond. Additionally they have denied the Armenians any compensation as the first step in reconciliation. With this stain on the conference, there is uncertainty as to whether it will last."

 arm.109.t: "Formal Recognition Of [ARM.GetNameDefCap]?"
 arm.109.d: "Moving on from the topic of compensation, the Armenian delegation has pushed for formal recognition of [ARM.GetNameDef] as a nation from [TUR.GetNameDef]. Such a move would strengthen the legitimacy of their state, as well as make progress on the mending of the strained relations between our people."
 arm.109.a: "Recognise [ARM.GetNameDef]."
 arm.109.b: "Refuse to recognise [ARM.GetNameDef]."

 arm.110.t: "[TUR.GetNameDefCap] Recognises [ARM.GetNameDefCap]"
 arm.110.d: "The delegation from [TUR.GetNameDef] agrees to recognise Armenia as a formal nation. With this admission, our ability to partake in more global diplomacy has been expanded. Our legitimacy is strengthened and reapproachment between our peoples has now taken its first step."
 arm.110.a: "To a new era!"

 #uses 110.t
 arm.111.d: "[TUR.GetNameDefCap] has agreed to formally recognise Armenia as a nation. This opens up further diplomatic channels between us and the region. It seems that the first steps towards the reconciliation of the two peoples has begun."
 arm.111.a: "May the accord last!"

 arm.112.t: "[TUR.GetNameDefCap] Refuses To Recognise [ARM.GetNameDefCap]"
 arm.112.d: "Unwilling to recognise our equal status as a fellow nation, we have been scorned at the conference. Without Turkish acknowledgment of our state, we may struggle to find further recognition abroad."
 arm.112.a: "A tragedy!"

 #uses 112.t
 arm.113.d: "Unwilling to recognise [ARM.GetNameDef] as a fellow nation on the world sphere has come as a deathblow to the hopes of the Armenian people. Without Turkish support, the ability for [ARM.GetNameDef] to take part in the global stage is severely hampered."
 arm.113.a: "A cruel fate for the Armenians."

 arm.114.t: "The Ruling Coalition Splits Up"
 arm.114.d: "Today, after another stormy session, the pointlessness of the further existence of the coalition of our parties, Dashnaks and Ramgavar, became apparent. Due to divergent positions on a series of issues, this leads us to take the obvious step of breaking the coalition pact between us and forming a single party government under [ARM.GetLeader]'s presidency as much as possible, until new elections are held in the country.\nAs a result of the collapse of the coalition, some members of both parties decided to try their luck and formed their own party, which claims to be the successor of the well-known Armenakan party, which hasn't been active since 1921. A famous writer and member of the Armenian General Benevolent Union Levon Pashalian, which helped our compatriots abroad, headed the new party.\nSimilarly, the Armenian Populist Party, founded in 1917 after the February Revolution and lead by its founder Michael Papadjanian, which supports a conservative-liberal programme, raised its head, sensing a chance to gain popularity."
 arm.114.a: "How fragile coalitions are."

 arm.115.t: "The [GetYear] Armenian Elections"
 arm.115.d: "Today, at exactly 8am, the Polling stations opened across the country to elect the president and parliament for a new term. With no party having formed a coalition, voters have four options to choose from: Dashnaks, Armenakan, Ramgavar and Armenian Populist Party.\nSo, who will be the winner?"
 arm.115.a: "The Revolutionary Federation achieves a landslide victory!"
 arm.115.b: "The Armenakan makes a surprising return!"
 arm.115.c: "The Ramgavar Party triumphs once again!"
 arm.115.e: "The Armenian Populist Party dominates the election!"

 arm.116.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Proposes a Trade Agreement"
 arm.116.d: "An Armenian delegation has just arrived in [THIS.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], hoping to negotiate a trade agreement with our government. In particular, their proposal would see both tariffs and border controls significantly reduced for imports from and exports to Armenia, thus allowing for an unhindered flow of trade between our two nations.\n\nWhilst this would grant us access to a new market in which we could sell our produce, it also cannot be denied that the Armenians would have much more to gain from such an arrangement than we do. Still, a new trading partner, no matter the size, would be of benefit to our economy, so how should we respond?"
 arm.116.a: "We gladly accept."
 arm.116.b: "We have no time for this."

 arm.117.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Has Accepted Our Proposal"
 arm.117.d: "Good news from [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]! The [FROM.GetAdjective] government has chosen to sign our proposed agreement, thus allowing for an increase in trade between our two countries. With new resources becoming available for our industry, new wares entering store shelves, and access to an entirely new market, it is safe to say that this will greatly benefit both our economy and the Armenian nation as a whole!"
 arm.117.a: "Together we shall prosper!"

 arm.118.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Has Rejected Our Proposal"
 arm.118.d: "Citing that they'd have nothing to gain from our proposed agreement, the [FROM.GetAdjective] government has turned down our offer of increased cooperation in the field of trade. However, whilst this is most certainly a setback, there are still other markets for us to explore, which may be more welcoming to our approaches."
 arm.118.a: "We didn't want their inferior wares anyway!"

 arm.119.t: "Constantinople is Ours!"
 arm.119.d: "In an extraordinary turn of events, sure to baffle military commentators around the world, a victorious army under the flag of Armenia has now taken the ancient imperial capital of Constantinople. While the Ottoman forces were astonished by our arrival, they were helpless to defend the city from our attack. Our homeland Armenia, downtrodden from our foes, has now risen like a phoenix from the ashes and taken the jewel of Constantinople in its talons. While once our forces hid in the hills and mountains, striking only at night, now they march down the Grand Avenue of Pera. Our patchwork network of guerrilla fighters has now united and won victories across Anatolia but few expected such a victory as this! \n\nHaving finished taking the city, a sense of shock seems to have set in among our forces, as even they seem astonished to find themselves in the capital. Aware of the insecurity of their position, they have sought to avoid arousing the anger of locals and kept overt displays of victory to a minimum. While a sense of fear has set in about the possibility of counterattack by imperial forces, and concern over whether this effort has left them vulnerable, for now at least the Armenian tricolour shines bright against its foes from atop the Topkapi Palace, and our nation soars like an eagle, a situation unthinkable just months ago.\n\nWhile our people are still reeling from brutal repression and false promises of liberalisation, they can take solace in the knowledge that our forces have shown the world what Armenians are capable of."
 arm.119.a: "Blessed is the one who dies for the freedom of his nation."

Born in a small village in the Russian governorate of Erivan, he lost his father at a young age. Having joined the Armenian Liberation Movement at the age of 17, he later enrolled at the Imperial University of Saint Petersburg, and, after two years of studies, he returned to the Caucasus to assist the Armenian national movement in their struggle against the Ottoman Turks. After joining the Dashnaktsutyun in 1908 and participating in the Iranian Constitutional Revolution, he fought the Turks in Bulgaria during the Balkan Wars and was even awarded the Cross of Bravery for his competence in battle.\n\nDuring the Weltkrieg, he once again fought against the Ottoman Empire, this time under Russian flag. As the Russians retreated in 1917, Nzhdeh began organising paramilitaries, hoping to be able to halt the Ottoman advance into Armenia. However, his efforts eventually proved to be in vain, and as Armenia was partitioned during the Caucasus Conference in 1919, he saw himself forced to concede Armenia proper to the Turks and to flee into Karabakh, a region which was de jure under the control of Azerbaijan. There, he continued to organise Armenian rebel forces, hoping that he would one day get a chance to return to Yerevan and to bring the Armenian people their freedom.\n\nWith the outbreak of the Desert War, this day had finally come, and as he returned from his exile, he was hailed as a hero by the people. With their support, he has now taken power, hoping that he'll be able to lead his people into a future free from foreign oppression and to save the newborn Armenian nation from experiencing the same fate as the First Armenian Republic.§!"
