### Decisions ###
 COS_ZKG_decisions: "Zentralamerikanische Kaffee-Gesellschaft"
 COS_ZKG_decisions_desc: "Our nation is almost fully controlled by a select elite of Coffee barons. Due to the American depression and the subsequent shockwaves, many of these barons with German roots have bound together and have created the §YZentralamerikanische Kaffee-Gesellschaft§! or §YZKG§!. Their power is large but could also be used to our advantage should we play our cards right.\n\nInfluence of the §YZKG§! : £coffee_texticon [?party_popularity@authoritarian_democrat|%R0]\n"

 COS_Combat_Social_Inequality: "Combat Social Inequality"
 COS_Combat_Social_Inequality_desc: "Even though the Atlantic Workers Congress has fought hard to secure the little rights plantation workers now have, the great divide between the wealthy German Coffee Barons and the common men remains great. Further social concessions will help us improve the life of the man on the street and also reduce the pull of these companies on political affairs."
 COS_German_Cultural_Program: "German Cultural Exchange Programme"
 COS_German_Cultural_Program_desc: "Strong ties between our nation and the members of the German sphere in Europe has led to a great influx of art, literary works and an exchange of cultural heritage. Universities all across Germany and Flanders-Wallonia are also responsible for the better part of our highly educated populace and have drastically influenced the minds of our people."
 COS_Extend_Loan_decision: "Extend our Loans"
 COS_Extend_Loan_decision_desc: "Happily profiting from the lingering depression and now from the Black Monday catastrophe, investors and wealthy capitalists have loaned us the capital necessary to bail out the ZKG. Now these loan sharks are returning for the money we no longer have. Offering them small political concessions and selling some of our land to these individuals could mitigate the issue but will not serve as a permanent solution."
 COS_Sell_Government_Land_decision: "Sell off Government Land"
 COS_Sell_Government_Land_decision_desc: "For decades the governments of Central America have used foreign companies to back up their economies through the sales of vast swathes of plantation land. It is only right that we do so as well, no?"
 COS_Land_Survey: "Survey the Acquired Land"
 COS_Land_Survey_desc: "Whilst large portions of our nation are ideal for plantations, not all of them are suited for the Coffee production. Scouting out terrain and determining whether or not it is worth the price we're asking for it is therefore key to the success of their investment."
 COS_Extend_Connections: "Extend Railroad Connections"
 COS_Extend_Connections_desc: "As the plantations keep growing and industry starts to foster, the need for better infrastructure increases as well. Following the example of Keith in the 19th Century, the ZKG has offered to extend the railroads if we are to sufficiently compensate them with workable plantation land."
 COS_Hire_Foreign_Engineers: "Hire Foreign Engineers"
 COS_Hire_Foreign_Engineers_desc: "Small mineral reserves have been discovered during the construction of the railroad and have prompted the ZKG to hire European Engineers to investigate the viability of these deposits and to further assist in the construction of bridges and tunnels."
 COS_Plantation_Expansion: "Expand the ZKG Plantations"
 COS_Plantation_Expansion_desc: "Positive response by both the company itself and other investors plus a rapid response from our government has led to an agreement concerning the new plantations. Promising to rely on mostly native Costa Rican labour and accepting the demands of the Atlantic Workers Congress, all parties involved have come to a suitable agreement and the first hectares of land have been put in action."

 COS_UFC_decisions: "United Fruit Company"
 COS_UFC_decisions_desc: "Ever since the American Keith set foot in Costa Rica and received the contract to establish a railroad network in our nation, his company the §YUnited Fruit Company§! or §YUFC§! has played an important role in Costa Rican economics. The great success of the company however did not solely remain Costa Rican and through shrewd investment the company has established a network of subsidiaries and plantations all across the Caribbean, bringing great fortune to these nations but also causing massive social disruption, often leading to §Rstrikes§!, §Rviolence§! and §Rpolitical disaster§!.\n\nInfluence of the §YUFC§! : £banana_texticon [?party_popularity@market_liberal|%R0]\n"

 COS_Sell_Government_Land_UFC_decision: "Sell Government Land to the UFC"
 COS_Sell_Government_Land_UFC_decision_desc: "For decades the governments of Central America have used foreign companies to back up their economies through the sales of vast swathes of plantation land. It is only right that we do so as well, no?"
 COS_Build_New_Telephone_Lines: "Commission new Telegraph Lines"
 COS_Build_New_Telephone_Lines_desc: "Communication between the two sides of our nation has always been a tricky affair often leading to miscommunication or unchecked corruption. Using their influence and expertise in the trade, the UFC has offered to expand our telegraph network in exchange for further concessions and the promise that we won't object to their Jamaican migrant workers."
 COS_Establish_UFC_Headquarters_decision: "Establish UFC Headquarters in Puerto Limon"
 COS_Establish_UFC_Headquarters_decision_desc: "As America descends into chaos and the individual nation states of Central America smell their chance to escape from the UFC monopoly, the company has proposed to expand their offices in Costa Rica and to establish Limon as their operational Headquarters for the Caribbean Region."
 COS_Limon_Bananas: "Develop Banana Plantations in Limon"
 COS_Limon_Bananas_desc: "Originally handed over to the UFC when Keith first started the company in exchange for the construction of a railroad across our nation, the Banana boom has struck the region and completely transformed it. Thousands of black Jamaican workers have been imported to work in the plantations and repeated sales of government land to the company have developed the region into an important economic hub, further aided by the key Puerto Limon harbour."
 COS_Jamaica_Sugar: "Develop Sugar Plantations in Jamaica"
 COS_Jamaica_Sugar_desc: "First operating under the West India Interest in the 18th Century and later fusing with the present-day West Indies Federation, the island of Jamaica has always been one of the main exporters of Sugar to the European Continent. Large investments by the British and extensive use of slavery exponentially increased the amount of sugar plantations on the island during much of its initial history and still leaves his mark on the nation as sugar remains its primary export.\n\nInvestors from the UFC have also shown interest in these rich plantations and have slowly but surely started buying land on the island to increase their own profit."
 COS_Jamaica_Bananas: "Develop Banana Plantations in Jamaica"
 COS_Jamaica_Bananas_desc: "Founded by a sailor called Lorenzo Dow Baker in 1870, the Boston Fruit Company was the start of the UFC operations on the island. Later merging with the company of Keith, the United Fruit Company started its rise to power and became one of the largest employers on the island. Continued growth of our operations in Jamaica should therefore be critical and have our priority when planning our next step."
 COS_Cuba_Sugar: "Develop Sugar Plantations in Cuba"
 COS_Cuba_Sugar_desc: "Mainly situated in the Oriente Province of the nation, the holdings of the UFC on Cuba aren't as influential to the nations politics as they are elsewhere in the region. Multiple sugar mills however exist on the island and it would be in our best interest and that of the company to keep these afloat."
 COS_Honduras_Palm_Oil: "Develop Palm Plantations in Honduras"
 COS_Honduras_Palm_Oil_desc: "Assisting in the military coup overthrowing president Davila and reinstating general Bonilla, Samuel Zemurray was able to extract massive concessions from the government of the nation. Offering to build up the infrastructure in the nation in exchange for enormous swathes of land, his company not only profiled itself as the motor of the Honduran economy but has since then branched out across the region before fusing together with the UFC.\n\nThe latter now not only holds great interests in the Banana production but is also responsible for sizeable amounts of Palm Oil and Abaca."
 COS_Honduras_Abaca: "Develop Abaca Plantations in Honduras"
 COS_Honduras_Banana: "Develop Banana Plantations in Honduras"
 COS_Guatemala_Abaca: "Develop Abaca Plantations in Guatemala"
 COS_Guatemala_plantation_desc_start: "Not only does the UFC control a sizeable percentage of all Guatemalan land but it also owns schools, railroads, housing companies and much more. To say the Guatemalan economy depends on the UFC would be an understatement and we cannot let this influence falter for the safety of the company."
 COS_Guatemala_Abaca_desc: "$COS_Guatemala_plantation_desc_start$\n\nMainly situated on the Eastern flank of the nation close to Honduras, the Abaca lands are providing a valuable alternative to the otherwise Banana dominated operations of the company."
 COS_Guatemala_Banana: "Develop Banana Plantations in Guatemala"
 COS_Guatemala_Banana_desc: "$COS_Guatemala_plantation_desc_start$\n\nMainly situated on the Western flank of the nation, the Banana plantations of Guatemala are the company's most successful operation yet and are not only contributing to continued growth of the stocks but are also allowing the UFC to branch out across the Caribbean and even into South America."
 COS_Colombia_Banana: "Develop Banana Plantations in Colombia"
 COS_Colombia_Banana_desc: "Centred around important Banana regions such as Magdalena, the company has had a troubled history in the South American nation. Various strikes, violent escalations between the workers and strikebreakers of the UFC have shaped the nation and the company is struggling to hold on to these assets with the American Civil War ravaging all in its path."
 COS_Nicaragua_Palm_Oil: "Develop Palm Plantations in Nicaragua"

 COS_Market_decisions: "Global Trade"
 COS_Market_decisions_desc: "As nations all across the globe have started to drastically increase their weapons industry smelling an opportunity to make a profit, we have the resources to participate in this trade as well.\n\nUFC Profit : §Y[?COS.cos_profit_factor]§!\n"

 COS_Guardia_decisions: "Policy of [COS.GetLeader]"
 COS_Guardia_decisions_desc: "Promising a fresh wind through Costa Rican politics, President §Y[COS.GetLeader]§! has announced his plans for the upcoming 4 years. With a heavy focus on following the \"Rerum Novarum\" and adapting it to Costa Rican society, he has outlined multiple programmes to aid the common man and solve the country's largest issues caused by §Rpoverty§! and §Rbad sanitation§!."

 COS_Combat_Footworm: "Combat Footworm in the Lowlands"
 COS_Combat_Footworm_desc: "Nearly 70% of the population in the Lowlands suffers from the Footworm disease. As a doctor himself, our president has proposed a programme wherein all children in the first grade will be given shoes by the state and the medical supplies necessary to rid ourselves of the problem."
 COS_Stimulate_Fishing_Industry: "Stimulate Fishing Industry"
 COS_Stimulate_Fishing_Industry_desc: "One of the major issues in Costa Rica is the very limited diet the average citizen consumes which leads to a great deficit of protein. Therefore the president has decided to kill two birds with one stone and plans to increase subsidies for the coastal region, boost the fishing industry and distribute seafood to the interior of the nation."
 COS_Disband_Petroleum_Monopoly: "Disband the Petroleum Monopoly"
 COS_Disband_Petroleum_Monopoly_desc: "Around 10 years ago, the entire gasoline and petroleum sector of our nation came under control of a single national company. Hoping to kickstart the economy and attract further foreign capital, the president has now proposed to break open the monopoly and let the Free Market take over."
 COS_Create_Housing_Cooperatives: "Create Low-cost Housing Cooperatives"
 COS_Create_Housing_Cooperatives_desc: "To combat the rising amount of homeless people in our nation and to provide quick and efficient solutions should a crisis occur, we should create housing cooperatives which will be supported by the National Bank of Securities."

 COS_Cortes_decisions: "Policy of [COS.GetLeader]"
 COS_Cortes_decisions_desc: "Building on the legacy of Ricardo Jimenez, §Y[COS.GetLeader]§! has announced that his focus shall be on combating the economic disaster that has overtaken the §YZKG§! and to improve the §Rterrible infrastructure§! of his nation through large government programmes."

 COS_Build_New_Schools: "Build New Schools"
 COS_Build_New_Schools_desc: "Continuing the Education reform announced by our President, plans have been drafted up for the construction of new schools on the countryside to reduce illiteracy even further. Priding ourselves on the saying that \"Costa Rica has more teachers than soldiers\", reception for this decision has been overwhelmingly positive no matter the cost."
 COS_Infrastructural_Improvements: "Infrastructural Improvements"
 COS_Infrastructural_Improvements_desc: "As the majority of our shipping takes place in the Limon region, the Pacific coast has been fairly neglected by previous administrations. To combat this issue, the president has decreed that in cooperation with companies like the UFC the port towns of the Pacific will be further connected to the rest of the nation and new docks will be created."
 COS_Silence_the_Press: "Silence the Press"
 COS_Silence_the_Press_desc: "Whilst we carry freedom of speech as one of our proudest values, the increased presence of syndicalist propaganda and the continued slandering of the Cortes administration is becoming troublesome and has greatly angered the president who is already struggling to keep the nation together due to the economic collapse. Silencing a few newspapers like \"Trabaio\" could mitigate the issue perhaps"
 COS_Expand_Manufacturing_Industry: "Expand the Manufacturing Industry"
 COS_Expand_Manufacturing_Industry_desc: "Contrary to most Central American nations, Costa Rica has a well-developed manufacturing industry and is quickly expanding this sector across the nation. The main issue with these businesses is that they greatly lack in size which makes them inefficient on a national scale. Fusing some of our over 7000 little \"factories\" will greatly help us reduce this inefficiency and will prepare ourselves for more sorts of heavy industry."

 COS_Election_decisions: "Presidential Elections"
 COS_Election_decisions_desc: "As the term of [COS.GetLeader] nears its end, the political theatre starts playing once more. Even though the power of the §CPRN§! is large, cracks are starting to show in its once rigid organisation as ex-president §YRicardo Jiminez§! and syndicalist §YManuel Mora Valverde§! with his §RPVP§! have both announced their candidacies. Gathering support from the provinces, cracking down on rival rallies and pleading to the businessmen will be key to winning the campaign.\n\n§CPRN§! support : §Y[?COS.cos_prn_factor]§!\n§RPVP§! support : §Y[?COS.cos_pvp_factor]§!\n"

With the full support of President Ferrer, they now have the means and the moral support necessary to complete their ideal and eradicate both the syndicalist and dictatorial regimes from the region."

 COS_merge_with_the_andean_pact: "Merge with the Andean Pact"
 COS_merge_with_the_andean_pact_desc: "The Andean Pact was created as a way to ensure stability and protection in their region and their goals are very similar to ours, but a dispute over Panama has soured relations between us and Colombia. The best curse of action to amend this divide is to invite them into our alliance and sort our issues internally."
 COS_integrate_into_CEN: "Re-joining the Federal Republic"
 COS_integrate_into_CEN_desc: "With four members of the republic already united and willing to fight for our cause, it is our time to re-join the Federal Republic, to help them eliminate the issues that tore apart the first one, to uphold democracy in the union and to create a powerful army capable of protecting us and carrying on the goal of our alliance."

 CEN_COS_peace_timer: "Peace with the Caribbean Alliance"
 CEN_COS_peace_timer_desc: "Our victory in Costa Rica has put us on an advantageous position to initiate negations. We will limit ourself to territory our army has and can capture by foot alone, as it is clear that our navy is not sufficient enough to help in naval invasion."
 COS_peace_timer: "A Falling Alliance"
 COS_peace_timer_desc: "The fall of Costa Rica has brough disaster to the alliance. If we are not able to save them soon, we will have no option to accept our enemies demands and retreat from occupied central american land."

 COS_Ferrer_Pacifist_decisions: "Policy of [COS.GetLeader]"
 COS_Ferrer_Pacifist_decisions_desc: "Awoken by the unconstitutional affairs of his predecessors and fighting for the rights of every Costa Rican citizen, §Y[COS.GetLeader]§! has great ambitions for the little nation. Not only are he and his Junta planning to implement radical new laws, they also plan to §Yrewrite the constitution§! and §Yabolish the army§!, culminating in what they have proclaimed the creation of the §CSecond Republic§!"

 COS_Tribunal_Sanciones_Inmediatas: "Institute the Tribunal de Sanciones Inmediatas"
 COS_Tribunal_Sanciones_Inmediatas_desc: "Created under Decree No. 16, this law has ordered the formation of a tribunal with the task of submitting all those to trial who have committed crimes but were able to escape punishment due to their ties to the previous regime.\n\nThe main reason behind the creation of this tribunal is not per se to persecute all members of the old regime but to offer a place to our citizens to file complaints instead of taking justice in their own hands."
 COS_Tribunal_Probidad: "Institute the Tribunal de Probidad"
 COS_Tribunal_Probidad_desc: "Created under Decree No. 41, this law has ordered the formation of a tribunal in which we shall persecute the corruption of members of the old regime and decide whether or not we should seize their assets for the state.\n\nContaining the names of 209 people, the new Tribunal will track down the financial affairs of these people starting 8 years ago and working themselves up till the present day."

 COS_Ban_PVP: "Ban the PVP"
 COS_Ban_PVP_desc: "Constantly criticising our regime at all points, committing treason by allowing foreign powers to station troops in our nation and their inability to cooperate with a fully constitutional system has left us no choice but to ban the party and make membership of any syndicalist party illegal."
 COS_Found_ICE: "Found the Instituto Costarricense de Electricidad"
 COS_Found_ICE_desc: "Representing the culmination of over 50 years of finding an efficient way to provide electricity to the nation, the ICE is founded to modernise the nations struggling sector. Lack of effort by foreign based companies that controlled the sector for nearly 15 years has now prompted a national initiative to create a Costa Rican national company responsible for the creation and maintenance of our new electricity grid. Plans for new roads, power cables and hydro-electric dams such as Carrillos de Poás have already been drafted and are only awaiting the approval of the Council."
 COS_Disband_the_Council: "Disband the Junta Fundadora"
 COS_Disband_the_Council_desc: "Founded during the early days of the Ferrer regime, the Council was tasked with the creation of a new modern constitution and to correctly handle the transition to the Second Republic. 815 reforms later, we see this task as finished and power will be transferred back to the electoral system which will decide on the new president."
 COS_Abolish_Army: "Abolish the Armed Forces"
 COS_Abolish_Army_desc: "We should be an example to the rest of our world and show them that real progress is made in a parliament instead of on the battlefield.

 COS_Diplomacy_decisions: "Diplomacy"

### Ideas ###
 COS_labour_conflicts: "UFC Labour Conflicts"
 COS_labour_conflicts_desc: "The United Fruit Company holds vast power in our nation's economy and has deep ties within the government. While the lingering American Depression has proven detrimental to their influence abroad, making way for increasing German trade, the company and its terrible labour practices have led to rising tensions in the political landscape. With elections just around the corner and socialism entrenching itself all around Central America, this could escalate without proper government intervention."

 COS_black_monday_desc: "Even though the lucrative coffee company once knew no end to its wealth, even investing in the assets formerly held by the UFC, the crisis that has shook up Germany has left its mark on the ZKG.

### Focuses ###
 COS_ZKG_Bailout: "ZKG Bailout"
 COS_ZKG_Bailout_desc: "Although founded by Costa Rican coffee farmers of German descent, the explosive growth of the German economy has led to the company being absorbed into a German multinational company, the ZKG. As this however tied the company to the German stock exchange, the fallout of the Black Monday disaster has had catastrophic consequences for the company who now edges on bankruptcy."
 COS_Request_American_Support: "Request American Support"
 COS_Request_American_Support_desc: "Even though the Americans themselves are suffering greatly from their own recession, various investors have shown interests in our land offering to assist the government in bailing out the ZKG in exchange for precious hectares of plantation land."
 COS_UFC_Land_Acquisition: "UFC Land Acquisition"
 COS_UFC_Land_Acquisition_desc: "Originally founded by Keith in Costa Rica back in the 19th century, the company no longer has our nation as its primary base of operations. The low cost of land now however caused by the governments policy to sell land cheaply to attract investors has once again attracted the UFC to increase its operations in our nation, further strengthened in their decision by the stability of our nation."
 COS_Outproducing_the_Competition: "Outproducing the Competition"
 COS_Outproducing_the_Competition_desc: "As demands for stable food supply routes increase across the world and several of the once 'Banana Republics' have descended into chaos, the access to bananas is decreasing rapidly making our nation an attractive investment and a steady supply of the delicious yellow fruit."
 COS_Puerto_Limon_Expansion: "Puerto Limon Expansion"
 COS_Puerto_Limon_Expansion_desc: "Located on the Atlantic side of our nation, Puerto Limon has long served as the central hub for the Banana export and has subsequently been expanded multiple times already by the UFC to meet increasing exports. Localising the production of freighters would be a wise investment as the American shipyards become less reliable by the day."
 COS_Connecting_the_Plantations: "Connecting the Plantations"
 COS_Connecting_the_Plantations_desc: "Railroads are no longer an abstract landscape decoration feature for the Costa Rican people who have seen the completion of multiple projects in their lifetime. The expansion of the plantations however caused by the new policy has left the rail magnates to play catch up. Inviting foreign investors to assist us in this could prove to be a big boon to our recovery."
 COS_Withering_the_Storm: "Weathering the Storm"
 COS_Withering_the_Storm_desc: "Our experience with the American recession in the '20s and the subsequent decisive economic policy of our President has enabled us to quite painlessly get over the recession. Jobs have been lost and empty bellies endured but compared to our neighbours we can proudly say that Costa Rica is prepared for the future."
 COS_German_Crisis_Response: "German Crisis Response"
 COS_German_Crisis_Response_desc: "It was the Germans who brought down our economy so it is only right that they are going to help us recover. This will come at a cost however as the hawkish investors of the Empire are sure to demand further land concessions in exchange for lower tariffs and agreeable trade terms."
 COS_Cash_Crops: "Cash Crops Investments"
 COS_Cash_Crops_desc: "Coffee and Bananas are the motor of our economy and have brought us much wealth in the past. Surely further backing down on this will rescue the ZKG from imminent collapse whilst also providing a feeding bottom for new investments by drastically lowering the price of the plantation land."
 COS_Deal_with_the_ZKG: "Deal with the ZKG"
 COS_Deal_with_the_ZKG_desc: "As German investors have mostly backed out of the economy and sold their shares during the flurry of Black Monday, de facto ownership has returned to the original founders who hold the interests of our nation in higher regard than their oversea colleagues."
 COS_Public_Works: "Public Works"
 COS_Public_Works_desc: "Influenced by the economic policies of both Keynes in the United States and Schacht in the German Empire, the government has decreed a policy of massive public investments to keep the population employed and ensure a solid base for our economy to flourish on."
 COS_Cultural_Growth: "Cultural Growth"
 COS_Cultural_Growth_desc: "Many of our intellectuals have chosen to study in the nation of Flanders-Wallonia, more precise at the Catholic University of Leuven, and the continued partnership between the two has led to an increased interest by the Flemish-Walloon people in our culture and traditions. Aware of our pride in our National Theatre, their government has shown willingness to fund its renovation and strengthen cultural ties."
 COS_Mitteleuropan_Trade_Agreement: "Mitteleuropan Trade Agreement"
 COS_Mitteleuropan_Trade_Agreement_desc: "Timid investments from the German companies has thus far kept us from recovering fully but the terms of the new agreements drafted up by our government have shown promise for both our citizens and the assets under control by our German allies."

 COS_Industrial_Developement_Scheme: "Industrial Development Scheme"
 COS_Industrial_Developement_Scheme_desc: "Inspired by the rapid industrialisation of other American nations and the growing importance of raw industrial power, the government has announced the creation of \"Plan Limon\" which will serve as the basis of our economic development programme."
 COS_Expand_Textile_Industry: "Textile Industry"
 COS_Expand_Textile_Industry_desc: "Although artisanal in nature, the textile industry of Costa Rica is renown across the region and has close ties to both American and German clothing companies. As the production for now however is solely located in small workshops, we hope to set up actual factories to increase our output drastically."
 COS_Economic_Boom: "Economic Boom"
 COS_Economic_Boom_desc: "As the recession nears its end and the ZKG seems nearly fully recovered, the construction of further production facilities seems to have finally brought fruit as we are shooting ahead of our neighbours in GDP growth."
 COS_Gold_Mining: "Dig Deeper"
 COS_Gold_Mining_desc: "Located primarily on the Northern side of our country, the old Spanish gold mines are nearing depletion. As they haven't been a major part of our economy for decades, prospecting for new sites has always been postponed. The collapse of the coffee market has made the government realise that diversifying the economy is key and has led to prospectors getting invitations to examine the surface of our nation."
 COS_Foreign_Knowhow: "Foreign Know-how"
 COS_Foreign_Knowhow_desc: "Our nation has thus far lacked adequate higher education which has led to many of the upper class studying abroad, with a certain preference to the universities of Flanders-Wallonia. Instead of letting our citizens travel abroad for education, we should encourage foreign teachers to come to Costa Rica and assist us in the creation of our own higher education system."
 COS_Manufacturing_Industry: "Foundations of a Manufacturing Industry"
 COS_Manufacturing_Industry_desc: "Limited to the production of farming tools and small products for domestic use, our manufacturing industry is in dire need of state intervention. Thousands of small workshops exist across the nation but the connection between these producers and their customers has thus far only been determined by their location. By steering the economy with a heavy hand, the state hopes to centralise production."
 COS_Escuela_Metalica: "Escuela Metalica"
 COS_Escuela_Metalica_desc: "Serving as the Headquarters of the Escuela Buenaventura Corrales, the school is one of the oldest education facilities in the nation, a symbol of great pride and a testament to the industrialisation of our nation.

 COS_Heavy_Industry: "Heavy Industrial Expansion"

 COS_A_Different_Approach: "A Different Approach"
 COS_A_Different_Approach_desc: "As smoke stacks and dark clouds mark the skyline of the industrialised nation, we as Costa Ricans should take pride in our natural beauty and stay away from the temptations of mass production.

 COS_Tourism_Industry: "Promote Tourism"

 COS_Boost_Cash_Crops: "Boost Cash Crops"
 COS_Boost_Cash_Crops_desc: "Cash crops have served us well for generations and are far cleaner and less demanding on our people than the work in mines and factories. Further contracts with the ZKG and UFC should help us further expand the export economy whilst keeping our nation clear from the taint of industrialisation."
 COS_Small_Business: "Small Business"
 COS_Small_Business_desc: "Contrary to most Central American nations, Costa Rica has a well-developed manufacturing industry and is quickly expanding this sector across the nation. Over 7000 of these little \"factories\" exist and while they do it somewhat inefficiently, they still sustain the needs of our population, while also providing valuable trade goods to our neighbours."
 COS_Hydro_Elelectricity: "Hydro-Electricity"
 COS_Hydro_Elelectricity_desc: "We may not have the oil or coal of our neighbours but foreign studies have identified our nation as prime land for hydro-electricity, enabling more and more workshops to work on cheap, clean electricity."

 COS_Paving_the_way_to_the_future: "Paving the Way to the Future"
 COS_Paving_the_way_to_the_future_desc: "The rest of the world may not yet have realised that the constant greed and exploitation of mother nature will one day force them to pay the price, but here in Costa Rica, efforts to strive for symbiosis between man and nature are conducted at every corner. We can only hope that others soon realise the same thing..."

 COS_Educational_Reforms: "Educational Reforms"
 COS_Educational_Reforms_desc: "With the spirit \"Costa Rica has more teachers than soldiers\" in mind, neglecting the education policy would be last on our agenda. As the last major education reform dates back to the 19th century when the Catholic missions had to make way for a secular system, little has changed leading to both our curricula and infrastructure starting to show cracks."
 COS_Cement_Administration: "Cement Administration"
 COS_Cement_Administration_desc: "Whilst Castro may not be liked by everyone due to his strict and severe punishments, one cannot deny that the efficiency and reliability of the civil service has leapt lightyears ahead of what it was before his presidency. Punctuality, anti-corruption laws and a focus on providing clear transparent administration have earned him the respect of many Costa Rican."
 COS_Adapt_the_Constitution: "Adapt the Constitution"
 COS_Adapt_the_Constitution_desc: "As outlined by the Costa Rican constitution, presidents are not allowed to immediately serve a second term after their first one is over. President Castro however has shown a desire to continue his presidency for another four years and is slowly working his way through the administrative paperwork to overrule this law."
 COS_Iron_Bars_Presidency: "Iron Bars Presidency"
 COS_Iron_Bars_Presidency_desc: "Nicknamed the President of Iron Bars, Castro has received the cognomen due to his massive investments in infrastructural expansion and the reinvigoration of our more backwards regions.

 COS_La_Sabana_International: "La Sabana International"
 COS_La_Sabana_International_desc: "As the world grows ever more interconnected, we should not stay behind. Therefore to increase connectivity between our allies in Europe and the Americas, Castro has announced his pet project, the construction of an International Airport in San José."
 COS_Railroad_Expansion: "Railroad Expansion"
 COS_Railroad_Expansion_desc: "Until now the vast majority of our railroads were constructed by foreign contractors in exchange for acres of plantation land. The unreliability of the global market however and the rapid decline in American stability has prompted the government to take decisive action and focus on training technicians and construction workers able to do the work without foreign assistance."
 COS_Bananas_South_Pacific: "Banana Plantations in the South Pacific"
 COS_Bananas_South_Pacific_desc: "Due to the focus of the UFC on the Atlantic coast and the region around Puerto Limon, development of the Pacific Coast has been lacking for decades now with plantations on this side of the nation working far less efficient and suffering due to a lack of infrastructure. By cooperating with the UFC, we hope to attract more investments to this region and combat the rising poverty."
 COS_Naval_Facilities: "Naval Facilities"

 COS_Socialist_Victory: "Socialist Victory"
 COS_Socialist_Victory_desc: "Although coming as a surprise to many, close friends and associates of Calderón saw this \"sudden\" change in policy from far away. Influenced by his studies at the Catholic University of Leuven, the Doctor has taken a great liking to the Papal \"Rerum Novarum\" and has seen in it the solution to the fallacies of capitalism and a viable alternative to the radical syndicalism that has taken over the world."
 COS_Break_Coffee_Elite: "Break Coffee Elite"
 COS_Break_Coffee_Elite_desc: "For decades now Costa Rican politics have been indirectly controlled by a small minority of wealthy coffee barons who have dictated the policy of the nation through the PRN. It is their influence that we will need to rid ourselves of if we want to stand any chance at fully implementing our social programme."
 COS_Develop_Atlantic_Region: "Develop Atlantic Region"
 COS_Develop_Atlantic_Region_desc: "One of the major issues in Costa Rica is the very limited diet the average citizen consumes which leads to a great deficit of protein. Therefore the president has decided to kill two birds with one stone and plans to increase subsidies for the coastal region on the Atlantic, boost the fishing industry and distribute seafood to the interior of the nation."
 COS_Introduce_Work_Code: "Introduce Work Code"
 COS_Introduce_Work_Code_desc: "The main pillar of Calderón's policy, the Labour code comes as a reaction to the mounting labour conflicts between employer and employee.

 COS_Found_the_CCSS: "Found the CCSS"
 COS_Found_the_CCSS_desc: "Social Security (Caja Costarricense del Seguro Social CCSS or Caja) further expands on the basis laid out by the Labour code.

 COS_Diversify_the_Economy: "Handling the Budget"
 COS_Diversify_the_Economy_desc: "Even though we have made massive headway in the development of our social system, the economy has taken a massive hit and is groaning under the weight of these new expenditures. We should cut down on funding here and there and encourage entrepreneurs to step away from the traditional agricultural market to soften the blow."
 COS_University_of_Costa_Rica: "University of Costa Rica"
 COS_University_of_Costa_Rica_desc: "Founded as the Universidad de Santo Tomás in 1843, the Catholic institution was forced to close down in 1888 under the progressive anti-clerical government of President Bernardo Soto Alfaro as part of a campaign to modernise public education.

 COS_Nationalise_Banks: "Nationalise Banks"
 COS_Nationalise_Banks_desc: "To relieve the crushing poverty and deprivation of the rural population, Don Pepe has formulated a plan in which the public sector would be financed by profits from state-owned enterprises, and the private sector would be financed by state banking. State-owned capitalist enterprises would be founded and their profits would return to the national treasury to finance infrastructure projects."
 COS_Women_Suffrage: "Women Suffrage"
 COS_Women_Suffrage_desc: "Suffragette movements have long been clamouring for government recognition in Costa Rica and whilst the previous administration made some promises to integrate women in the electoral process, nothing really came from it. Until now that is as Don Pepe has already openly expressed his support for their movement and is planning to allow women to vote starting from the next national election."

 COS_Public_Education_for_All_desc: "Education is one of the key pillars our nation is built on and plays a vital role in the economic plans of Don Pepe to establish the Holy Trinity of national development : healthcare, education and infrastructure.

 COS_Expand_Citizenship: "Expand Citizenship"
 COS_Expand_Citizenship_desc: "Friction between the native Costa Rican population and the black immigrants on the Atlantic coast has long caused issues in our society as the latter were never fully recognised as Costa Rican citizens but more as a labour force for the American plantations.

 COS_Fullfill_our_Duty_desc: "Even though we may now have one of the most democratic and stable regimes on the planet, our brethren in Central America are still sweating under the yoke of corrupt politicians, \"socialist\" revolutionaries and authoritarian dictatorships.

 COS_Domestic_Weapons_Manufacturing: "Domestic Weapons Manufacturing"
 COS_Domestic_Weapons_Manufacturing_desc: "Until now domestic weapons manufacturing in our nation has been practically non existent apart from artisanal hunting rifles.

 COS_Costa_Rican_Patriotism_desc: "Whilst the military tradition of our nation is pitiful to say the least, patriotism still rules strong in the minds of our citizens.

 COS_Expand_the_Coast_Guard: "Expand the Coast Guard"
 COS_Expand_the_Coast_Guard_desc: "Apart from some small motorboats, our navy is nothing to pride ourselves on, but while it may be tiny, it does the job. Recent discoveries of smuggling near the Nicaraguan border however have prompted the government to consider the purchase of additional vessels to guard our waters."
 COS_Guard_the_Freightors: "Guard the Freighters"
 COS_Guard_the_Freightors_desc: "As freighters serve as the main connection between our nations economy and the world trade web, their defence is one of our top priorities. We wouldn't want a French sub to blow up a ship in Puerto Limon, now would we...?"

 COS_country_intro_header: "Costa Rica: A Central American Success Story"
 COS_country_intro_content: "Tucked away deep in the Central American jungles, our small but proud nation has flourished for many decades enjoying literacy rates higher than some European nations and a slow but steadily growing economy based on the banana and especially coffee trade.\n\nEnsured by a strict adherence of all parties to the constitution, there has been no military intervention or political coup in the nation since the failed dictatorship of Ticino in 1917 who was deposed mere months later under pressure from the people, refusing to endure a dictator in their republic. Ever since the nation has been controlled by a varied albeit egalitarian caste of politicians who have enjoyed the fruits of the growing German economy and the close ties between our two nations.\n\nUnder the wing of the PRN, president Ricardo Jiminez is able to look back on a successful term in which he dealt with both the economic depression caused by the American recession and the rising voices of socialist movements who enthused by the Atlantic Workers Congress have finally risen up from their slumber and demanded better representation. Although they somewhat succeeded in their aims and have forced the government to draft a labour accord, the law is far from passed yet and under the rising star of Manual Mora Valverde trouble between companies and workers is far from over.\n\nNevertheless, the nation flourishes as the fruits of our relations with Mitteleuropa are flowing in in the form of cultural exchange programmes, scientific assistance and a strong bond between universities such as the KU Leuven in Flanders-Wallonia and the Costa Rican upper class."

 cos.2.t: "Nomination of the Republican Candidate"
 cos.2.d: "Whilst the supremacy of the PRN is unquestionable in the upcoming elections, the party is divided on who to push forward to serve as their Presidential candidate.\n\nLeón Cortés Castro has the support of the conservative coffee elite and has proven during the tenure of Jimenez to be a worthy successor to his legacy. Other members however have remarked that his aggressive anti-socialist stance and strict attitude could lead to further escalation amidst the socialist sphere and as such provide a feeding bottom for Valverdes syndicalist party.\n\nAs a compromise between the two extremes, the Church persuaded by the encyclical Rerum Novarum, has pushed forward Rafael Ángel Calderón Guardia. His political career is not very noteworthy and most people only know him as the 'Doctor' due to his medical profession. With both sides hoping to use him as a sock puppet whilst ruling in his stead, support for his candidacy is increasing by the day."
 cos.2.a: "Cortés will lead the nation."
 cos.2.b: "Let's give this 'Doctor' a chance."

 cos.3.t: "Manuel Mora Valverde requests approval for his candidacy"
 cos.3.d: "As the leader of the Syndicalist Party, Manuel Mora Valverde is dead-set on representing his party in the upcoming elections. Due to a special clause in the Constitution however forbidding anyone to participate under the age of 30, his bid would automatically be canceled.\n\nHolding a fiery rhetoric in Congress in support of lowering the age requirement, the young but charismatic politician, has attempted to persuade the sitting government to reconsider this clause and to allow him and his party to run for office."
 cos.3.a: "The Constitution is sacred!"
 cos.3.b: "It was a dumb rule anyway..."

 cos.4.t: "1936 Elections"
 cos.4.d: "Surprising no-one, the PRN has once again secured a dominant position in the elections and has delivered our next president. Whilst it seems that the worst is behind us, we should not automatically assume that our new president will have an easy time in office as the corporatist vultures and socialist agitators will make his term difficult enough as is."
 cos.4.a: "Viva Cortés!"
 cos.4.b: "Viva Calderón!"

 cos.5.t: "Disaster in the ZKG!"
 cos.5.d: "In the aftermath of the American Depression, the largest coffee barons of our nation bound together and joined forces in the German headed ZKG or Zentralamerikanische Kaffee-Gesellschaft. Buying up the UFC and other American assets left and right, boosted by the economic golden age of Germany, the ZKG has come to control vast swathes of our land and economy, not only determining domestic policy but providing work to thousands of Costa Rican citizens.\n\nThe Black Monday Crash however has turned the tables on the ZKG and after stocks kept plummeting in Berlin, the company is being forced to file for bankruptcy dragging our national economy into the dirt. Careful spending by our former president has luckily allowed our government to build up a small reserve with which we will now attempt to stop the down-spiralling catastrophe that has hit the ZKG. This is however nothing but a temporary measure and foreign partners will be required if we wish to save the company from collapse."
 cos.5.a: "Oh, the humanity!"
 cos.5.b: "Those Germans had it coming anyway."

 cos.6.t: "ZKG: Permanent Solution?"
 cos.6.d: "Upon first review it seems that our initial measures have stopped the complete collapse of the ZKG but as our funds run dry at an alarming rate, we need to look to possible partners who can bail out the ZKG and save our economy from an even worse disaster. The Americans themselves have been suffering from a crisis with no end in sight whilst the Germans are watching with complete horror how the imperium they built up over the years slowly descends into chaos. Both however have powerful capitalists who have been following from the sidelines, hoping to cheaply buy the failing companies of the pre-Black Monday order."
 cos.6.a: "We shall ask the USA for assistance."
 cos.6.b: "We shall ask the Germans for assistance."

 cos.7.t: "[FROM.GetNameDef] Requests Our Assitance"
 cos.7.d: "Disaster has struck the otherwise quiet little nation of [COS.GetName] when the ZKG (Zentralamerikanische Kaffee-Gesellschaft) crashed hard on the Berlin stock exchange just a few weeks earlier, dragging the nation into a hole out of which it will be unable to recover on its own. To save them from complete collapse, the small nation has requested us a loan to bail out the ZKG."
 cos.7.a: "Offer them assistance!"
 cos.7.b: "We have more important matters to attend to."

 cos.8.t: "[FROM.GetAdjective] Support Arrives"
 cos.8.d_start: "Tough negotiating with the [FROM.GetAdjective] delegation finally paid off when an accord was reached between [ROOT.GetLeader] and the [FROM.GetAdjective] government."

 cos.9.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Refuses to Help"
 cos.9.d: "Whilst not really surprising due to their domestic issues, the USA have refused our requests for a loan to bail out the ZKG and have left us stranded with no other alternative than the Germans."
 cos.9.a: "Get me the Germans on line 1!"
 cos.9.b: "We are truly alone in the world."

 cos.12.a: "Get me the Americans on line 1!"

 cos.13.t: "Coffee Sector Recovers"
 cos.13.d: "Five years have passed since the ZKG collapsed under pressure from failing stocks. Whilst the government was in no position to save them back then, leading to a period of poverty and 3 years ago even bordering on the edge of starvation, the coffee trade is finally recovering and under measures imposed by our President [COS.GetLeader] slowly but surely the economy is growing again."
 cos.13.a: "At last!"

 cos.14.t: "Strikes on the Coffee Plantations"
 cos.14.d: "Largely fuelled by the chaos in the ZKG and the massive lay-offs that followed Black Monday, the plantation workers nationwide have laid down the work and are protesting against the government. Claiming that [COS.GetLeader] is insufficiently assisting the people and is merely lining his pockets, their rhetoric has been taken over by Valverdes syndicalists whose movement grows by the day."
 cos.14.a: "Let's hope we don't get a repeat of the '34 Strike."

 cos.15.t: "Anti-Negro Protest in San Jose"
 cos.15.d: "Ever since the UFC set foot in Costa Rica and started its banana imperium, black workers and their families moved into the nation to work on their plantations. Since the local Costa Ricans had little intention to join the UFC on their banana crusade and were perfectly content with the coffee trade, Keith was forced to import more and more Jamaicans to work his fields. Weary of outsiders in their land however, the Costa Ricans never fully embraced their new citizens and kept a distinct distance from them. Over the years this has led to friction between the two parties which only escaped escalation due to the geographical features keeping them apart.\n\nFaltering profits from the coffee trade however and a general consciousness amongst the negro population have let the two groups once more collide. Costa Ricans are protesting what they see as a threat to their culture, aliens escaping from their designated area in the Limon province whilst the Blacks urge that the government treats them as equal citizens of the republic."
 cos.15.a: "Loosen the restrictions."
 cos.15.b: "Force companies to hire native Costa Ricans."
 cos.15.c: "Enforce designated no-go zones."

 cos.16.t: "The German Cruiser \"Schleswig\" Docks in Puerto Limon"
 cos.16.d: "Officially running out of supplies whilst cruising the Caribbean but more likely curious as to whether the [COS.GetLeader] regime could prove to be a naval station in the West, the German Cruiser \"Schleswig\" moored in Puerto Limon earlier this morning.\n\nDelighted by the presence of these foreign guests, [COS.GetLeader] has personally received them with fanfare and a ceremony praising the relation between our two great nations. When later that day in a closed door meeting between the German delegation, the topic concerning the instability in the USA arose, the captain of the vessel handed over his orders to our president that the security of Costa Rica is of vital interest to the German people and that troops, supplies and even full protection could be arranged should instability in the region continue to mount."
 cos.16.a: "Request a German Garrison."
 cos.16.b: "Request arms for our army."
 cos.16.c: "We will do just fine on our own."

 cos.17.t: "Costa Rica Requests a German Garrison"
 cos.17.d: "Rising instability in the USA and the nearby regimes in Central America have forced the small nation to come to us for aid. Reminding us of the strong ties between our two nations and the significant German population living in their territory, they ask that we station a small regiment in San Jose to deter foreign threats.\n\nWhilst this has short term implications on our relations with the USA, we're sure that they will understand that we are acting for the greater good."
 cos.17.a: "Send the detachment."
 cos.17.b: "We seek no quarrel with the USA."

 cos.18.t: "German Garrison Arrives in Puerto Limon"
 cos.18.d: "Travelling in an unmarked freighter carrying consumer goods for the Costa Rican people, a German garrison of just over a thousand men sat foot on the island under the cover of darkness and was directed by the commander of our army to their barracks. Gasping in awe at the superior equipment and discipline of these new soldiers, our troops are frightened that they would not be able to counter any rash actions by the German detachment."
 cos.18.a: "Willkommen meine Freunde!"

 cos.19.t: "No Military Support From the Empire"
 cos.19.d: "Calling our nation irrelevant to the global strategy of the Empire and a waste of resources, the German commission refused to concede any troops for our defence and have requested us not to bring up the matter again."

 cos.20.t: "Costa Rica Requests German Arms"
 cos.20.d: "Rising instability in the USA and the nearby regimes in Central America have forced the small nation to come to us for aid. Reminding us of the strong ties between our two nations and the significant German population living in their territory, they ask that we send them a small cache of arms and other supplies to bolster their forces and deter foreign threats.\n\nWhilst this has short term implications on our relations with the USA, we're sure that they will understand that we are acting for the greater good."
 cos.20.a: "Send the guns."

 cos.21.t: "German Arms Arrive"
 cos.21.d: "Transported amidst boxes of Swiss chocolate and Krupp machinery, dozens of boxes containing some of the latest Mausers fabricated at FN Herstal were brought into our nation on regular trade ships. Unaware of our deceit, our neighbours will be in for a rude awakening should they stumble upon our army!"
 cos.21.a: "These are clearly \"Made in Costa Rica\"."

 cos.23.d: "The unthinkable has finally happened and once more the \"United\" States of America find themselves fighting against each-other. All around Central America, socialist agitators and military dictators are roaring in pleasure as the once impenetrable web of American treaties has been left shattered.\n\nNot only does this severely endanger our sovereignty, the limited force we have to protect our nation is nothing but old men and cannon fodder ready to go down in a blaze of fire. We need a strong ally if we wish to survive and we need him now! As Canada is submitting territory after territory in the wake of the Civil War, it may be wise to direct our efforts towards them and hope that we can peacefully escape the soon to be unleashed terror in Central America."
 cos.23.a: "Canada will surely save us!"

 cos.25.d: "Unwilling to see yet another nation in the region collapse into instability, the Canadian government has agreed to guarantee our independence so long as we stay friendly to the Entente cause."
 cos.25.a: "Huzzah!"

 cos.26.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Denies Us Support"
 cos.26.d: "Likely because of their interests in our immediate neighbour, Panama, the Entente has circumvented the question of our sovereignty and send our diplomats packing. Whether this is a sign of a combined Panama-Canadian invasion of Coto is not yet clear but it's most definitely a sign that stability in the region is rapidly declining."
 cos.26.a: "Maybe the Kaiser will come to our aid?"
 cos.26.b: "Dig in lads!"

 cos.27.d: "$cos.24.d_start$ As Entente forces encroach on the Panama Canal determined to snatch it from a failing USA and socialist forces to the North look eagerly to the ill defended Costa Rican nation, it would be in our interests to establish a foothold on the American continent and keep a close eye on the region should the situation escalate even further."
 cos.27.b: "We are already overextended as is!"

 cos.28.d: "Unwilling to see yet another nation in the region collapse into instability, the German government has agreed to guarantee our independence so long as we stay on friendly terms with their alliance and serve as a foothold for their ambitions in the region."
 cos.28.a: "Everything has a price..."

 cos.29.d: "Citing their massive overextension and troubles in the colonies, the German Empire has sadly declined our request. Whilst they are saddened that they can't help any further, they hope we survive the coming tide and would be pleased if the trade connections between our two nations could continue per the usual."
 cos.29.a: "Maybe the Canadians will come to our aid?"
 cos.29.b: "Business is more important than friends..."

### COTO Events ###
 cos.30.t: "Crisis over Coto!"
 cos.30.d_start: "Ever since the independence of Panama from Colombia, they have laid claim over the Coto, a region in Panama's Chiriquí Province along the Panamanian-Costa Rican border. In 1911 the chief justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, Edward D. White, was asked to arbitrate. He rendered his decision in 1914, but Panama did not accept it, alleging that it favoured Costa Rica. Hostilities broke out in 1921, when Costa Rica invaded the area. Panama recaptured the area easily. The conflict spread, however, when Costa Rica moved into the province of Bocas del Toro. Fearing that its interests might be threatened, the United States forced Panama to accept the White decision.\n\n"
 cos.30.d: "$cos.30.d_start$As our American allies have now fallen into anarchy, the Panamanian government has reopened the dispute and is demanding that we hand over the territory or face their army on the battlefield. Whilst our troops have recently grown in size, we are still completely outmatched by our Panamanian neighbours and will need foreign assistance if we are to become victorious.\n\nOur allies however are less eager to fight yet another pointless war and would prefer a more diplomatic solution to the crisis by re-enforcing the Fallo White ruling and forcing Panama to back down once and for all."
 cos.30.a: "Request mediation from Canada."
 cos.30.b: "Request mediation from Germany."
 cos.30.c: "We will have to face them on our own!"

 cos.301.t: "Costa Rica Stands Alone!"

 cos.301.a: "Tonight we dine in San José!"

 cos.31.d: "$cos.30.d_start$Well aware that the Americans are in no position to save Costa Rica once more, the Panama government has sent another ultimatum to San Jose demanding the extradition of the Coto region. Even though we have little reason to mingle in their small disputes, finding a peaceful resolution to the crisis will reaffirm our status as excellent negotiators and could force the Central American region back into submission."
 cos.31.a: "Offer to sit down with Panama."
 cos.31.b: "Issue a warning to Panama."

 cos.32.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Offers Mediation"
 cos.32.d: "After being asked by Costa Rica to act as intermediary in the crisis, the [FROM.GetAdjective] government has scheduled a summit to discuss possible peaceful resolutions to the conflict and prevent war from breaking out. Negotiating on the part of Costa Rica, they are open to force them to pay us a compensation for the territory but they are determined to stick to the Fallo White ruling and keep Costa Rican territorial integrity intact."

 cos.35.a: "Propose the offer to Costa Rica."
 cos.35.b: "We don't negotiate with villains."

 cos.36.d: "Negotiating on our behalf, the [FROM.GetAdjective] delegation has received terms from the Panaman government which state that Panama will give up its claims in the regions if they are compensated for the loss in profits. Whilst the legitimacy of this statement is shaky at best, it may be in our best interest to suck it up and thus prevent war from breaking out."

 cos.41.t: "War Over Coto!"

 cos.43.d: "The deal we so diligently prepared for the Costa Ricans has been rejected by San Jose this morning, claiming that Panama has no valid base to demand anything from them and that they should be happy Costa Rica is even willing to negotiate. Whether these harsh words will escalate the situation is to be seen but a compromise is now fully off the table."

 cos.60.d: "Feeling under threat by what they call the \"bourgeois press\", the Syndicalist party has announced the creation of a new newspaper to distribute their world-views and spread propaganda with. Hoping that through sales and advertising the newspaper will also become a source of income for the struggling party, they have ironically turned their paper in a cacophony of both ads praising the virtues of capitalism and articles harshly criticising this same practice. How hilarious the situation however may be, [COS.GetLeader] is all but pleased that somebody dares threaten his image and has already announced countermeasures against the newspaper should they continue to protest his regime."
 cos.60.a: "Officially slander the paper and demand they cease printing."
 cos.60.b: "Let the hypocrites enjoy their moment of fame!"

 cos.61.t: "Signature of the Collective Agreement between Workers"
 cos.61.d: "Years have passed since the Great Banana Strike of 1934 but the Costa Rican people have pushed on against the UFC. As the situation in the USA went from bad to catastrophe, the UFC saw that would they not cooperate with the local population their time in the nation may be coming to an end. Finally agreeing on many of the labour concerns pressed by the syndicalist Manuel Mora, the company was backed into a corner whilst the government refused to assist them in the matter.\n\nAchieving minimum wages that would not be given in company coupons, six hour shifts, recognition of injury law and many other concessions, this is a great success for the Costa Rican left and has also led to the creation of the first actual trade unions, expanding where the Atlantic Workers Congress had laid the foundations.\n\nSeeing the writing on the wall, the ZKG has also ratified the new Labour Accord and has expressed their full desire to work with the workers to create a better and safer work environment"
 cos.61.a: "A success for all parties involved... except the stocks."

 cos.62.t: "Regulation of the Press"
 cos.62.d: "Even though \"Trabaio\" has seen little success in capturing the minds of its readers, other newspapers have started to write about our regime in a bad light. Whilst it is their constitutional right to have the freedom to express their opinions, we feel that they could be... motivated to direct their attention elsewhere.\n\nThe success of the Labour Accord has sadly brought with it the rise of further far left media who openly oppose our regime and are calling for a \"Revolution\", surely the people must see that this is treason of the highest degree?"
 cos.62.a: "Leave the Press alone."
 cos.62.b: "Strong-arm the papers into submission and arrest the troublemakers."

 cos.63.t: "Jewish Refugees Request Permission to Settle"
 cos.63.d: "As antisemitism continues to rise in the AUS break-away and due to the increasing tension in the Middle East between the Ottoman Empire and the Egyptian nation, an American humanitarian organisation called Refugee Economic Management has asked our government to open ourselves up to 1500 Jewish families who have been driven from their homes. Guaranteeing [COS.GetLeader] that the resettlement procedure would not cost the state a penny, they are urging the government to set a side a small parcel of land for them build a Jewish community."
 cos.63.a: "Jews are propagators of socialism! Away with them!"
 cos.63.b: "Offer the Tenorio farm as a possible colony."

 cos.64.t: "Second Wave of Refugees Arrive"
 cos.64.d: "The war in the United States seems to have no end in sight and whilst many are dying on the front-lines of the various American battlegrounds, many more are attempting to escape the nation hoping for a safe place until the war has ended. Our renown reputation as one of the most democratic and accepting nations in the Caribbean region has made us an attractive destination and has prompted thousands to embark on cargo freighters towards our little state. Accepting these immigrants will lead to an increased amount of capital in the nation but tensions are already running high between the Native Costa Ricans and the black Jamaican population. Further immigration may lead to open conflict if we are not careful."
 cos.64.a: "Accept them with open arms."
 cos.64.b: "We are full, go try somewhere else!"

 cos.65.t: "1938 Regional Elections"
 cos.65.d: "Whilst some have appreciated the heavy handed interventionism by [COS.GetLeader], not everyone is equally content and with the Regional Elections approaching, the popularity of the PRN is tanking heavily in the polls. Especially the syndicalist PVP under Manuel Mora Valverde is making decent headway and seems set to deliver congressmen like Carlos Luis Sáenz this time around. In these trying times it's key that our resolve remains unshaken and therefore president [COS.GetLeader] is secretly planning to lift the syndicalists from office the moment they are elected and arrest them on charges of treason."
 cos.65.a: "The Elections should be fair and open to all."
 cos.65.b: "Dismiss Carlos Luis Sáenz from office!"

 cos.68.t: "Teatro Nacional de Costa Rica receives Funding"
 cos.68.d: "Constructed in the late 19th century, when San Jose's population was only around 19,000 people with the money earned during the coffee boom, the Teatro Nacional has long served as one of the prime institutes of high-quality musical and theatrical performances in Central America. Waning interest by the people however and a lack of homegrown plays suited for the prestige of the building however have left it in a somewhat neglected state.\n\nThat was until a company of Flemish-Walloon investors travelling through the nation during a trade mission sent out by Mitteleuropa came upon the site, instantly falling in love with the institution. Promising to send aid and performers from their homeland, the Teatro has received a sizeable grant to continue its operations with. When a recent reportage was subsequently featured in the Flemish-Walloon paper De Standaard, a public crowdfunding campaign to support the Teatro was started with great success across their nation.\n\nPresented today by the Ambassador from Mitteleuropa, a small ceremony was held in front of the building in which the grant was symbolically exchanged for a bag of Costa Rican coffee beans."
 cos.68.a: "Most generous of them."

### Not Yet Coded ##
 cos.69.t: "Formation of 'El Centro'"
 cos.69.d: "A progressive group of recent law school graduates has today announced the creation of an organisation called The Centre for the Study of National Problems, or El Centro for short. Influenced by the Peruvian political thinker Victor Raúl Haya de la Torre, the young intellectuals believed that the state should be an instrument for enacting radical social reform. They are frustrated by the failures of Cortes' administrations to address social issues and applaud the Atlantic Workers Congress for pushing back against the UFC. Fearing syndicalism, El Centro members believe that social reforms could be achieved through the legislative framework."
 cos.69.a: "A radical idea!"

 cos.70.t: "Jimenez Announces His Candidacy for the Presidency"
 cos.70.d: "Malcontent with the heavy handed and authoritarian rule of Cortes, ex-president Ricardo Jimenez has once again thrown his hat in the ring for the presidency, hoping to build on the large supporter base his previous tenure has nourished. Reactions from the left have thus far been very warm as they hope that infighting within the PRN will allow them to take control in the upcoming elections. Cortes himself is all but pleased and has been seen secretly planning with his party members to sabotage the Jimenez campaign."
 cos.70.a: "The race has started!"

 cos.71.t: "1940 Elections"
 cos.71.d: "Although heavy weather seems to have deterred many from showing up at the voting stations, a surprising 72% of the electorate submitted their vote before the booths closed tonight at 9PM. Tensions are high as all parties involved are betting heavily on the outcome of these elections and surprising twists could suddenly arise."
 cos.71.a: "Guardia Calderón becomes president."
 cos.71.b: "Cortes Castro starts a second term!"
 cos.71.c: "Ricardo Jimenez is reelected."

 cos.72.t: "Figueres Ferrer Takes to the Air"
 cos.72.d: "\"Dear Costa Ricans and other people living in our great nation. I speak to you with a heavy heart as I see the values for which our republic has fought so bravely are being tarnished at every end. The constitution, once the sacred fundament of our society has been spit on by our most enlightened president. The freedom of speech we once prided ourselves on is ripped to shreds by the censure of Castros regime and the man in the street is lied to and oppressed. Where one day, addressing the government openly and criticising its failing policies was seen as virtuous and right, it is now a direct path to jail. How long Costa Ricans will you endure the dictator? How many more of our civil liberties need to be removed before we realise that the man in the Presidential Palace does not speak for us?\"\n\nContinuing preaching for over half an hour, the distinguished businessman was finally removed from the air by police forces and arrested for treason. The damage however is done and police forces across San Jose are wondering how the situation should be handled. Punishing Ferrer severely will only make him a martyr while others fear that releasing him will allow him to gather further support against the government."
 cos.72.a: "Release the man."
 cos.72.b: "Put him on the first boat to Mexico!"

 cos.73.t: "Unrest in the Countryside"
 cos.73.d: "All across the nation, farmers and plantation workers have started to push back against their local bureaucrats demanding the immediate resignation of Cortes and the removal of his cronies from office. Most likely invigorated by the recent upheaval caused by Figueres Ferrer, the protests and anti-government actions seem to continue with no end in sight."
 cos.73.a: "What can a few peasants do?"
 cos.73.b: "Cortes announces his resignation."

 cos.74.t: "Cortes Resigns From Office"
 cos.74.d: "Pressured by strikes and protests across the nation, the man known as the president of Iron Bars has been forced to resign and has handed the presidency down to his successor Guardia Calderón. Whether this means that the Cortes regime has finally ended or merely changed heads is as of yet unsure but the Costa Rican populace is euphoric by the victory of democracy."
 cos.74.a: "Good luck Calderón!"

 cos.75.t: "Ferrer Escapes!"
 cos.75.d: "Even though he was transported in an unmarked truck heading for Puerto Limon, an armed band of his fanatics stopped the convoy in Siquirres and successfully secured the release of their leader. Free once more and burning with passion to overthrow our regime, he is an enormous danger for national security."
 cos.75.a: "Do I have to do everything myself?"

 cos.76.t: "The Legion Caribe Executes a Coup"
 cos.76.d: "700 armed loyalists of Ferrer were all it took to flawlessly execute a coup d'etat on the regime of [COS.GetLeader]. Taking the key cities of Puerto Limon, Cartago and San José, the under-supplied and understaffed forces of the national army were in no position to offer much resistance. Small shootouts occurred throughout the nation but in the end, the coup was executed without much blood spilled.\n\nProclaiming himself president of the nation, Figueres Ferrer has taken control into his own hands and has already announced sweeping changes."
 cos.76.a: "Figueres proclaims the Junta."

### Calderón Events ###
 cos.77.t: "Calderón Announces His Ambitions"
 cos.77.d: "As is tradition, the new president was asked to give a speech during his ceremony lining out his plans for the future of our nation. What people however didn't expect the radical turn of policy Calderón announced.\n\nCalderón proposes sweeping social reforms, promising to found a national university, develop a social security programme, provide low-cost housing, provide more rural credit, enact land reform, and assist less-developed regions of the country. All of these announcements have completely stunned the members of the PRN who saw in Calderón nothing but a sock puppet for their conservative policy."
 cos.77.a: "H-he can't do this!"

 cos.78.t: "Education Reform"
 cos.78.d: "Ever since liberal reforms back in 1884 and 1894 put a stop to the Catholic influence in our education programme, the nation has prided itself on having an advanced level of literacy. \"Costa Rica has more teachers than soldiers\" is one of the favourite ways a Costa Rican describes his country and this pride is deeply nested.\n\nThat is until now as President Calderón has recently announced dramatic changes to primary and secondary education based on his inspiration source, the Papal encyclical \"Rerum Novarum\". \"religion should be obeyed; that a high standard of morality should prevail, both in public and private life.\" Based on these ideas, Calderón not only reverted the 1894 ban on teachers from monastic orders but even obligated parents who want their child excluded from Catholic teachings to personally deliver a written note to the teacher, by doing so making children who use such notes be seen as \"special\" and laughing stocks for the others."
 cos.78.a: "The separation between Church and State becomes less distinct by the day."

 cos.79.t: "\"Paco o Medias\""
 cos.79.d: "As the economic crisis keeps causing massive disruption, our government is becoming more and more a secretive hierarchy of patronage, bribery, theft and bullying.\n\nA striking example of this practice can be found in Calderóns brother, Francisco, previously an unknown bank teller, who now serves as Public Safety Minister and Third Designate to the Republic (a position somewhat like vice president). Though many leaders had placed family members in positions of power, Calderón's brother has become infamous for doling out non-competitive government contracts to cronies and people who pay him bribes. This has led him to acquire the nickname “Paco a Medias” because allegedly he demands a 50% kickback up front before offering contracts.\n\nEven though Calderón announced himself as a president of the people for the people, the economic mismanagement of his nation and the catastrophic increase in corruption are weighing heavily on the nation."
 cos.79.a: "While the people starve, the rich become richer."

 cos.80.t: "[COS.GetLeader] Demands Emergency Powers"
 cos.80.d: "Claiming instability in the region and the looming threat of foreign invaders, [COS.GetLeader] has demanded Congress to immediately extend emergency powers to his office. He ensures that no misuse will be made of them but critics amidst the congressmen see this as yet another power-grab to further enrich his cronies."
 cos.80.a: "Dark times are ahead of us..."

 cos.81.t: "Persecution of Foreign Landowners"
 cos.81.d: "With war raging all across the globe and the Costa Rican treasury slinking by the day, President [COS.GetLeader] has set his sights on the valuable properties of the German coffee barons. By controlling public opinion through the state media and the emergency powers recently granted to our president, Guardia is now fully capable of stripping these Germans off their land and confiscating their properties to support his money slurping welfare state."
 cos.81.a: "Take their lands."
 cos.81.b: "Strip them from their rights and confiscate their property."
 cos.81.c: "Maybe we shouldn't..."

 cos.83.t: "A Tempting Offer..."
 cos.83.d: "Enraged by the suspension of constitutionally guaranteed individual rights due to Calderón's emergency powers has led both the Democratic party under Cortes (who broke ties with the PRN after Calderón seized full control and founded his own party) and the syndicalist party under Manuel Mora Valverde to openly denounce the President for infringing on electoral liberty.\n\nSince their complaints fell on deaf ears in the PRN dominated Congress and since president Calderón has no intention to give up his emergency powers, voices from the sidelines have started calling for a coup against the dictatorial regime. The conservative director of the Bank of Costa Rica, Jorge Hine was recently seen conversing with Mora and presumably asked him for his support in the coup, offering him seats in an upcoming unity government following its success."
 cos.83.a: "Together we shall restore stability!"
 cos.83.b: "Mora declines the offer."

 cos.84.t: "Coup in Costa Rica!"
 cos.84.d: "Executed with support from both sides of the isle, the military has executed a coup against Calderón's regime toppling him and lifting his cronies from their positions. Whilst the coup happened without much bloodshed, the Costa Rican people fears that the long period of political stability has finally ended."
 cos.84.a: "The Dictator is gone! Long Live Costa Rica!"

 cos.85.t: "Future of Costa Rica"
 cos.85.d: "Even though both the syndicalists and conservatives brought down Calderón together on the promise that they would form a unity government, cracks in the so called \"unity\" are already starting to show as the conservatives have no desires to cooperate with what they see as their nemesis and the syndicalists have no desire to return to the conservative era. As the executers of the coup stay under arms until a final decision is made, instability is continuing to rise all across the nation."
 cos.85.a: "Mora proclaims the Workers Republic."
 cos.85.b: "Emergency elections are held."

 cos.86.t: "Jimenez Wins the Elections"
 cos.86.d: "Due to disagreements amidst the parties of the unity government, emergency elections were immediately declared and promptly won by ex-president Jimenez. Praising his steadfastness in the 1932-1936 tenure and his ability to keep a balanced budget has won him the elections with a landslide."
 cos.86.a: "Good Luck."

 cos.87.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Crosses the Border"
 cos.87.d: "In support of the syndicalist Manuel Mora Valverde, the Nicaraguan government has decided to intervene in our succession crisis. Whilst officially denying that they have any part in it, small bands of Nicaraguan militias were seen crossing the border and converging in known syndicalist bastions. As our army stands divided and the conservatives are entangled in internal conflict, it seems that the Workers Republic is a fact."
 cos.87.a: "The World Revolution continues ever stronger!"

 cos.88.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Requests Our Integration into the Central American Union"
 cos.88.d: "It was the Nicaraguans that guaranteed the rise of our Workers Republic and it will be the Nicaraguans that shall end our nation as we know it. Urging Mora to accept their ideas of a Centro-America, pressure is building up between the two nations as the Costa Rican chairman is unwilling to compromise his nations sovereignty whilst Nicaragua has the arms and means to enforce the union they desperately seek."
 cos.88.a: "Costa Rica joins Centro-America."
 cos.88.b: "We reject their \"offer\"."

 cos.881.t: "An Opportunity in Costa Rica"
 cos.881.d: "As President Guardia has been forcefully deposed in Costa Rica by a coalition of conservatives and syndicalists, an opportunity has presented itself to fully incorporate their nation into our dreams of a united Centro-America. Whilst sentiment against our nation is fairly strong amidst the Costa Ricans, [NIC.GetLeader] believes that by sending covert operatives and guerrilla fighters to \"assist\" Valverde in wresting control over the nation, we could easily push our claim and overtake the nation."
 cos.881.a: "Send them \"support.\""
 cos.881.b: "We have no desire to interfere in their affairs."

 cos.882.t: "Valverde Folds"
 cos.882.d: "Aware that without an army and the popular support to oppose our military takeover of his nation he has no choice but to give in, Valverde has officially announced the end of Costa Rica in front of Nicaraguan press and foreign media. Whilst this comes as a surprise to the outside community who knew the small nation as an outsider devoid of greater central American ambitions, pressure from all sides proved too much to resist and the proud nation has finally been forced into submission."
 cos.882.a: "Another step closer to the World Revolution!"

 cos.89.t: "Army Deposes Mora"
 cos.89.d: "Frightened by the threats Nicaragua made to the sovereignty of our nation, the [THIS.GetRulingParty] government finally found the rallying beacon they needed and decided to unite against the syndicalist threat. Launching strikes on all major cities to take down the syndicalist militias, the army has successfully overcome the threat. Casualties were high however as covert Nicaraguan operatives fought as lions to keep the Workers Republic intact."
 cos.89.a: "Hold Emergency Elections."
 cos.89.b: "Council of National Security rules temporarily."

 cos.90.t: "[GetYear] Election Year"
 cos.90.d: "After the successful coup deposing Manuel Valverde and disbanding his workers republic, the council of national security spearheaded by a coalition of parties all across the isle has governed the nation. Now the [GetYear] elections have approached and the question has come up whether they should proceed as scheduled or whether the Council should rule indefinitely on the base that the nation hasn't stabilised enough yet."
 cos.90.a: "Elections proceed as scheduled."
 cos.90.b: "Council retains control."

 cos.91.t: "[GetYear] Elections"
 cos.91.d: "Tensions are running high amidst the parties as 2 weeks ago, the Council of National Security was finally disbanded, giving way to a returned form of democracy. Both ex-president Ricardo Jimenez and Cortes Castro have announced their candidacies and even though their voter base is divided between the two, it looks to be a clear victory for"
 cos.91.a: "Ricardo Jimenez."
 cos.91.b: "Cortes Castro."

 cos.92.t: "Figueres Ferrer Takes to the Air"

 cos.95.a: "Figueres proclaims the Junta."

 cos.96.t: "Mora Offers an Alliance to the PRN"
 cos.96.d: "Though Calderón has spent his career publicly denouncing syndicalists, after the thwarted coup, he was now grateful to Mora for preserving his very existence, realising that he would somehow have to broaden and energise his political base to continue to survive. Thus, in spite of his previous Christian Socialist rhetoric, in spite of his repeated denunciation of syndicalism, and in spite of his strong ties to the church, Calderón has begun discussing an alliance with Mora and the syndicalists.\n\nPerforming well in the last regional elections, bringing in 16% of the votes, the PVP has announced their support for the proposed alliance even though for years they have openly accused the PRN of jailing its members and censuring their opinions."
 cos.96.a: "The Left stand united."

 cos.97.t: "Bankruptcy Looms over Costa Rica"
 cos.97.d: "Whilst previous conservative presidents had always prided themselves on their balanced budget and strict economic management, President Calderón has pushed the Costa Rican economy to the brink of collapse. Where 3 years ago the budget was in excellent shape with limited debt, Calderón has increased the state expenditures by over 60%, causing massive disruption to the treasury and rapidly increasing debt. Desperate telephone calls to our foreign allies, begging them for financial support have fallen on deaf ears and financial collapse is starting to become imminent. Should the state not find the resources by May 1st, it will have to refuse its employees their wages and hope that they will stay in line.\n\nEnthused by the recent successes elsewhere in the region however, a small group of radical thinkers has proposed an alternative to President Calderón. They propose that he joins the negotiations for a United Central American state and as such burdens the other states in the region with his rising debt. Whilst this would mean the end to Costa Rican sovereignty, it would enable Calderón to remain in power."
 cos.97.a: "The Federation might not be the worst idea..."
 cos.97.b: "Drastically increase taxation."

 cos.98.t: "Coffee Elite Speaks Out Against Calderón"
 cos.98.d: "Rampant corruption, unadulterated bribery and the now massive increase in taxation have pushed the coffee barons to the breaking point. In a recent meeting of the Club Unión de San José, the main social forum of the coffee elites, they gathered to discuss the policies of their president and how much longer they could support him. At the end of the session they were all asked to anonymously submit of vote of confidence in their leader. Out off all members, only 1 remained confident in Calderón's abilities."
 cos.98.a: "Unfortunate."

 cos.99.t: "[GetYear] Elections"
 cos.99.d: "As Calderón's term comes to an end, the PRN looks to the future and decides on their candidate for the upcoming elections. Although willing to run a second time, Calderón is afraid of the backlash this may cause against his figure and has proposed that the party shoves Picado forward to take control and continue the reforms proposed by the PRN-PVP coalition."

 cos.113.a: "Remain neutral in this crisis."
 cos.113.b: "Back Costa Rica and \"Don Pepe.\""
 cos.113.c: "Back the Central American Republic."

 cos.117.t: "Victory in the Coto War!"
 cos.117.d: "The Panamanians have once more been driven from our land and the integrity of our nation preserved. With international pressure to this time follow the Fallo Blanco Ruling, Panama has no choice but to renounce their claim on the region for all time."
 cos.117.a: "Long Live Costa Rica."

 cos.118.d: "It has taken blood, sweat and tears but finally we can proudly proclaim that Coto is back under our control. Whilst the international community looks down on us for denying a peaceful resolution, they have no desire to intervene a second time, leaving Costa Rica at our mercy."
 cos.118.a: "Long Live Panama."

 cos.120.t: "[COS.GetName] in our Faction?"
 cos.120.d: "Since we took care of their little nation after the American Civil War broke out, the Costa Ricans have offered to join our war effort. Whilst their input in this war will be minimal of any, it's a nice gesture from them and is a morale boost for the people at home."
 cos.120.a: "Welcome aboard!"
 cos.120.b: "Costa What?"

 cos.121.t: "Offer Refused"
 cos.121.d: "Even though we asked nicely and had already been preparing reforms to assist the war effort, our \"allies\" have brusquely refused our offer and sent us packing."
 cos.121.a: "Well that isn't nice."

 cos.122.t: "Punctuality in the Regime of Castro"
 cos.122.d: "Whilst often criticised for being harsh or severe in punishment, the government of [COS.GetLeader] has profiled itself as one of order, discipline and strict punctuality. Vigorously promoting the honesty and efficiency of the Public Employees, Castro himself has on more than one occasion been seen patrolling the government offices early in the morning to inspect the punctuality and attendance of his employees. Should he spot that one of his subordinates is slacking or is taking bribes, he will immediately be requested to resign no matter his political affiliations.\n\nWhilst this policy has turned many of Castros former friends against him, he is praised by the common man for combating corruption and making the state run more efficiently."
 cos.122.a: "Discipline is key to a good working society."

 cos.123.t: "\"Mamita Yunai\""
 cos.123.d: "Written by famous leader of the Atlantic Workers Congress, Carlos Luis Fallas, the novel \"Mamita Yunai\" has been received very well by the working class and has been praised as one of the greatest literary works in Costa Rican history.\n\nRecounting the tale of a man named José Francisco Sibaja, an activist of the Workers and Peasants Block, the novel starts when he is sent by his party to control a vote in Talamanca that is known to be fraudulent. Travelling to one of the last areas populated by Indians, where almost no Spanish is spoken, this first part, recounts the vicissitudes through which Sibajita goes to find the polling station and reach it, despite the obstacles put by local authorities. The activist understands his impotence and tries at least to substantially reduce the extent of the fraud in which he partially succeeds by convincing the police chief and local representatives. In the end however, his effort proves to be but a drop of water in the sea and he return back to Limon content with his success and unaware of how little impact his actions have had.\n\nDescribing in great detail the poverty and harsh lives of the Indians he encounters, the tale is meant to be shocking and eye-opening for the establishment in charge and to show the people how little they have done."
 cos.123.a: "It's a good novel nonetheless."

 cos.124.t: "'Don Pepe' Disbands the Military"
 cos.124.d: "In a ceremony at the Cuartel Bellavista earlier today, President José Figueres Ferrer has officially proclaimed an end to the military spirit of Costa Rica by symbolically smashing one of the walls of the citadel with a mallet.\n\nAs decreed in Article 12 of the constitution, the Armed Forces are hereby disbanded and replaced by the police forces, the National Guard. The entire budget that previously went to the military has been redirected to education and cultural projects as is symbolised by the government's decision to convert the fortress to the Museo Nacional de Costa Rica."
 cos.124.a: "Long live Costa Rica!"

 cos.125.t: "Deutscher Aero Lloyd Flight 134"
 cos.125.d: "The nation was taken by surprise today when Deutscher Aero Lloyd Flight 134 with destination Buenos Aires was rerouted to San José earlier this morning when an as of yet unidentified organisation, presumably syndicalist, hijacked the plane just over Portugal forcing the crew to reroute to Central America. Shortage of fuel however kept the plane from touching down in Nicaragua and forced the plane to refuel in San José, carrying 34 passengers.\n\nDon Pepe, who was holding a speech in Puriscal only 20 miles from the capital, was immediately notified of the situation and was requested authorisation to refuel the plane. What the terrorists however didn't count on was the response of our president who instead of complying to their demands jumped into the closest vehicle headed for the airport radioing the National Guard to refuse and act as he said to \"terrorise the terrorists\". Demanding the plane to be encircled, its tyres deflated and all possible exits cut off, the president ended his answer shouting into his radio \"Boys, this is war!\".\n\nBy the time the President arrived, all passengers apart from the flight crew who were kept as hostages were released. One of the stewards pleaded, \"For the love of God, let us go to Nicaragua! Otherwise, they'll kill us\". Ferrers answer was immediate. He directed that tear gas be pumped into the planes ventilation system followed by an assault team who stormed the aircraft. Grabbing a sub-machine gun from his personal guards, the President himself led the charge. No innocent casualties occurred in this dramatic action but all terrorists were executed on the spot, resulting in the incident marking the headline of newspapers all across the world, congratulating the President for his brave and decisive action."
 cos.125.a: "In Costa Rica we terrorise the terrorists!"

 cos.126.t: "An Interesting Proposition"
 cos.126.d: "To secure the safety of democracies all across Latin America, the nation of [FROM.GetName] has created the Democratic Alliance of the Caribbean promoting peaceful cooperation and a mutual defence pact for all nations in the region. Due to our close ties in the past and our democratic government, they have invited us as honorary member and would be greatly pleased if we accepted."
 cos.126.a: "Of course we will join!"
 cos.126.b: "Costa who?"

 cos.128.t: "Crisis on the Canal"
 cos.128.d: "As the American Civil War has finally started gripping around itself, the Canadians have dared to execute a power grab in the canal zone. The Panamanians however were prepared and have seized the canal for themselves, claiming that it has always been part of Panama and will stay forever so.\n\nThis puts us in an interesting position as we can provide the Canadians the perfect staging ground to land forces and take over Panama by land which could guarantee us Canadian protection should the need arise in the future."
 cos.128.a: "Send the offer to Canada."
 cos.128.b: "We will remain neutral."

 cos.129.t: "Unexpected Aid Arrives"
 cos.129.d: "Aware of our trouble pacifying the Panamanians, the Costa Rican government has offered their ports and free access across their land to help us in taking down Panama. In exchange they expect us to protect them from the other nations in the region should the need arise."
 cos.129.a: "We accept!"
 cos.129.b: "We don't need another liability in our alliance."

 cos.130.t: "Canada Accepts!"
 cos.130.d: "The time for war has finally come as the first Canadian boots are landing ashore in Puerto Limon ready to force themselves the Panamanian heartland seizing the Canal and deposing their government with unrelenting force. Britannia has suffered enough humiliations and losing from Panama won't be one of them. Accompanied by Costa Rican scouts and a small detachment of 50 of our best soldiers, we can only hope that they succeed in their adventure."
 cos.130.a: "Onwards!"

 cos.131.t: "Canada Refuses!"
 cos.131.d: "To our great surprise the Canadian government has politely refused our offer, most likely out of fear that they would have to defend us should the time come."
 cos.131.a: "At least we tried."

 cos.132.t: "Formation of the Democratic Alliance of the Caribbean"
 cos.132.d: "With our country being saved from tyranny by the Caudillo Figueres Ferrer, a new wave of hope for freedom and democracy has manifested.\nThis new spirit to fight for the less fortunate countries still oppressed by dictators has resulted in the proclamation of the Democratic Alliance of the Caribbean, an alliance open to all the democracies of the Caribbean, as well as to El Salvador and Ecuador. Its fundamental aims will be to strengthen democracy in the region and to act as one in defence of our common economic, military and political interests.\nWith one of its immediate goals being the creation of a democratic Central American Federation, uniting the five republics to use their combined might to bring the goals of the alliance to reality."
 cos.132.a: "For a brighter future for Central America!"

 cos.133.t: "Invitation to the Economic Bloc"
 cos.133.d: "Our [FROM.GetAdjetive] allies have proposed an economic bloc to strengthen the economy of the members of the alliance."
 cos.133.a: "We appreciate the solidarity."

 cos.134.t: "[FROM.GetName] Offers us an Invitation to Democratic Alliance of the Caribbean"
 cos.134.d: "[FROM.GetName] has offered us an invitation to their faction, claiming that our current alliance with Colombia will over time devolve into one of subjugation and that they are looking for the best for our democracy and sovereignty.\n\nWhile a very alarmist take on the issue, is is true that there is a big power imbalance between us and Colombia, but their strength is also beneficial because it helps deter forces to attacks us. Should accept this offer?"
 cos.134.a: "Our destiny lies with in the Caribbean."
 cos.134.b: "The Colombians will offer better protection."

 cos.135.t: "Suspicious Activity from Panama"
 cos.135.d: "We have received news of a meeting between Panama and [FROM.FROM.GetName], discussing Panama potentially leaving our alliance over fears of subjugation. This is a very obvious ploy of [FROM.FROM.GetName] to get Panama on their Alliance, but showing that we don't mean this at all could calm this distrust from spiralling out of control."
 cos.135.a: "Nothing to worry about."
 cos.135.b: "Let's reassure our ally of our true intentions"

 cos.136.t: "Panama Aligns with Us"
 cos.136.d: "Panama has seen reason and decided to join us."
 cos.136.a: "Another ally to the democratic cause."

 cos.137.t: "Panama Declines Our Offer"
 cos.137.d: "Panama has decided to remain in the Andean Pact."
 cos.137.a: "Let's hope the best for them."

 cos.138.t: "A Union of Alliances?"
 cos.138.d: "[FROM.GetName] has come today to sort our issues regarding our shared interest in the region of Panama. Their solution involved uniting both alliances to share such an important position.\nThey also argue that uniting our forces will help to better defend against any threats and give us benefits to our economies, but it's undeniable that this would come at the price of helping in their crusade against dictatorships and leaving our non-democratic members out."
 cos.138.a: "Unity will bring prosperity and security to all."
 cos.138.b: "We are better off on our own."

 cos.139.t: "Unification with Costa Rica"
 cos.139.d: "The Costa Rican government surprised us today announcing their intentions of joining our country in hopes to create a stronger union and implement the democratic framework of their country into the Federation, to avoid the issues that brought down its predecessor.\n\nExpectedly, we will not reject such a deal and have work to make the union as smooth and fast as possible to have the five republics finally united under the banner of the Federation."
 cos.139.a: "The Federation reunited at last."

 cos.140.t: "Establishing Closer Ties with Central America"
 cos.140.d_level_1: "As the first step in drawing our countries closer, [FROM.GetLeader] has suggested that we reduce our number of military personal as they are more fitting for taking the job of security.\nThis would hardly change our current situation as our army is already very small in comparison to them.\n\nBut something they demanded was a ban on all news that print anti-unification propaganda as they don't desire that these ideas later brew into rebellions and protest."
 cos.140.d_level_2: "Another meeting was held today about further ties, in which the Central American government offered to invest in our industrial sector to reduce the amount of control foreign owned companies have in our country.\nBut our experts see that this would only be transferring that control over to them as no promises have been made regarding the control of the land and factories outside of a good share of the profits coming back to us.\nThere isn't much pushback knowing the full end goal of the negotiation, but the few that still resist see this as our last chance to maintain our sovereignty."
 cos.140.d_level_3: "On today's meeting, we were surprised by Central America \"offering\" to take care of most of our external diplomatic matters so we can fully prepare for future integration into the wider union.\nWith this being our last true chance to decline, many government workers are threatening to resign if we accept this deal."
 cos.140.d_final: "Our final meeting is being held as the final paper is being completed for our government to transition to just a regional one and to have the five republics finally united under one banner once more."
 cos.140.a: "Closer relations will benefit both."
 cos.140.b: "This is unacceptable."
