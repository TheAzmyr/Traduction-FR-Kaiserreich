 MON_authoritarian_democrat_party_long: "Noyodyn Zövlöl\n§gFor many years in Mongolia, the upper classes have always held strong influence in Urga. Mongolia's aristocrats have always had their hand in the runnings of their country, and now is no different. However, ever since Ungern came to power in 1920, the wealth and influence of the aristocrats has been under threat. Ungern has proven in recent years that he does not fear seizing the wealth of these nobles, nor does he fear cracking down on their influence to keep control. However, in 1927, the princes and aristocrats of Mongolia joined together in an organisation titled the Noyodyn Zövlöl, lead by aristocratic figurehead Prince Demchugdongrub. The Noyodyn Zövlöl are content in their current position, but will be forced to take over should their assets and influence be threatened.§!\n"

 MON_paternal_autocrat_party: "Rossiyskaya Voyennaya Klika"
 MON_paternal_autocrat_party_long: "Rossiyskaya Voyennaya Klika\n§gRoman von Ungern-Sternberg successfully gained control of Mongolia in 1920, after he moved into Urga with his Asiatic Cavalry Division and successfully forced out the Chinese after getting the blessing of the Bogd Khan. After the death of the Bogd Khan in 1924, Ungern became regent of Mongolia, waiting for the 9th Jebtsundamba Khutuktu to be found. In 1933 when he is born in Tibet, he moves to Mongolia and is installed as Khan, however Ungern continued his rule as regent until the child is deemed fit to rule. Ungern has created a cult of personality around himself, and has filled his military and government with his Russian allies and Mongolians who remain loyal to him.§!\n"

 MON_national_populist_party: "Buddyn Zövlöl"
 MON_national_populist_party_long: "Buddyn Zövlöl\n§gThe Buddyn Zövlöl is a council of high up, influential Mongolian Buddhist figureheads. It is headed by the 7th Changkya Khutukhtu, one of the most important lamas in Mongolian and Tibetan Buddhism. Ever since the death of the Bogd Khan in 1924, the 7th Changkya Khutukhtu formed the group to secure Buddhist interests under the rule of Roman von Ungern-Sternberg. The 7th Changkya Khutukhtu has stated that the main point of the group is to make sure that when the 9th Jebtsundamba Khutukhtu (the spiritual leader of Mongolian Buddhism, the top ranking lama in Mongolia and the reincarnation of the Bogd Khan) is of age, Ungern will give up his role as regent and allow the true leader of Mongolia to take the reins. However, many fear that Ungern will never give up his role, so the Buddyn Zövlöl are ready to take over, should the nation need it.§!\n"

 MON_ask_tibet_for_faction_decision: "The Tibetan Alliance"
 MON_ask_tibet_for_faction_decision_desc: "Now that we have ended the Ma's in our territory, we still see a bleak future. In uniting China, many Chinese warlords may try to re-integrate both us and Tibet, to once again become slaves to the Han. However, if we and Tibet stand united against them, perhaps it will dissuade them from trying."
 MON_attack_the_mas_decision: "Intervene in the Ma-Tibetan War"
 MON_attack_the_mas_decision_desc: "For many years, tensions have risen between the Ma Clique and Tibet. With Tibet being our de facto allies, and the Ma's being true enemies to the Mongolian people, it is time we helped our Buddhist brothers and crush the aggressive Ma's."

 MON_intervene_in_jap_chi_war_decision_desc: "With war now broken out in China, we must not forget that Japan helped us secure our independence. [From.GetNameDefCap] is at war with Japan and thus an excellent target for us. Also, the opportunity for land and regional power cannot be ignored."

 MON_western_rebellion_decisions: "The Western Revolt"
 MON_western_rebellion_decisions_desc: "Bandits and rebels have taken control of the west of the country, and are fighting regular battles with our army. We must do our best to counteract these rebels, for although they directly are not able to take Urga, the chaos they are causing is a ladder for opposing factions to climb, and push our government to the ground."
 MON_reinforce_troops_in_west_decision: "Reinforce Troops in the West"
 MON_the_offer_decision: "Make The Offer"
 MON_the_offer_decision_desc: "We have received word that some bandit leaders are willing to give up their arms for a bribe. We should consider this offer."
 MON_bring_tuvan_garrison_decision: "Transfer the Tuvan garrison"
 MON_bring_tuvan_garrison_decision_desc: "Although the Tuvan garrison is not very large, they are decently loyal to the Urga government. Although their withdrawal from Khem-Beldyr will cause some unrest, their men will bolster our forces."
 MON_reinvade_tuva_decision: "Reinvade Tuva"
 MON_reinvade_tuva_decision_desc: "Rebels and bandits have taken over the region of Tuva. We must recapture it to secure the nation."
 MON_siege_of_uliastai_decision: "Siege of Uliastai"

 MON_chaos_in_capital_decisions: "Chaos in the Capital"
 MON_chaos_in_capital_decisions_desc: "With the focus on the army in the west, Urga has been thrown into chaos. The political factions who have waited for the right time to make their moves have seized the chance, and are willing to do much to ensure their power."

 MON_mongolian_highway_decisions: "Mongolian Infrastructure Projects"
 MON_mongolian_highway_decisions_desc: "The nation of Mongolia, due to its population being extremely spread out over its vast steppes and a large amount of the population living a nomadic lifestyle, has next to no real infrastructure. In this current state we will be unable to supply out troops during war, and our population will feel separated. To solve this, we must begin construction of infrastructure linking to Urga from all across our nation."

### Focus tree ###
 MON_ungerns_mongolia: "Ungern's Mongolia"
 MON_ungerns_mongolia_desc: "Mongolia, for now, remains in the hands of the Baron Ungern-Sternberg. Though this position is threatend by fast-moving political currents. Ungern must act now if he is to remain in his position."

 MON_bribe_nobles_support: "Bribe the Princes"
 MON_bribe_nobles_support_desc: "Though the nobles are currently opposing our government, we can easily take some of the less loyal nobles by bribing them. The princes should be so pliant towards conformity after decades of Chinese suppression."

 MON_purge_the_nobles: "Purge the Princes"
 MON_purge_the_nobles_desc: "The Princes have always been a problem, holding far too much influence in Mongolian government. It is time they see their end."

 MON_ignore_prince_issue: "Ignore the Princes"
 MON_ignore_prince_issue_desc: "The princes are not truly the issue we are facing. We must focus on other avenues, and perhaps even get support from them in defeating other factions."

 MON_impose_authoritarian_ideas: "Impose Authoritarian Ideas"
 MON_impose_authoritarian_ideas_desc: "Many in Urga currently believe that perhaps it is time for democracy. The problem is that they do not realise how wrong they are, and must be disciplined to stop democracy from infesting the whole of the nation."

 MON_advertise_sternberg_buddhism: "Display Ungern's Buddhism"
 MON_advertise_sternberg_buddhism_desc: "Many in Mongolia do not believe Ungern-Sternberg is committed enough to protecting Buddhism and acting in a Buddhist lifestyle. Some public displays of him and some loyal monks meditating and holding some speeches should convince them otherwise."

 MON_use_nobles_to_destroy_buddhists: "Nobility Assist in Destroying Buddhists"
 MON_use_nobles_to_destroy_buddhists_desc: "Using the Princes' vast wealth, they have agreed to help us crush some of the Buddhist resistance in Urga."

 MON_use_nobles_to_destroy_democrats: "Nobility Assist in Destroying Democrats"
 MON_use_nobles_to_destroy_democrats_desc: "Using the Princes vast wealth, they have agreed to help us crush some of the socialist resistance in Urga."

 MON_the_great_buddhist_icon: "The New Buddhist Icon"
 MON_the_great_buddhist_icon_desc: "Though Ungern-Sternberg is not a tulku like the Bogd Khan, he should still be known as a Buddhist figure of almost equal importance in Mongolia. Fortunately foundational work like the Tibetan Agvan Dorzhiev's work 'The Shambhala Prayer' is already well known and easy material to manipulate for propaganda."

 MON_the_greatest_dictator: "Cult of Personality"
 MON_the_greatest_dictator_desc: "To make sure Ungern-Sternberg remains in power, the propaganda around his cult of personality should be temporarily increased massively. This cult of personality relies on mythmaking that officer Ossendowski is adept at spinning."

 MON_enforce_officer_loyalty: "Enforce Officer Loyalty"
 MON_enforce_officer_loyalty_desc: "The officer class is a hotbed for noble traitors, socialist rebels and Buddhist extremists. Their loyalty should be tested and hardened to root out these issues. To the general staff, this measure also helps restrict the ability of Russian politics to influence their decisionmaking."

 MON_arrest_all_opponents: "Arrest Any Opponent"
 MON_arrest_all_opponents_desc: "Though before we had strict laws about opposition, it is obvious these laws aren't strict enough. The prisons should be overflowing with opponents before the nation is safe."

 MON_urga_military_parade: "Urga Military Parade"
 MON_urga_military_parade_desc: "Nothing gets the peoples support and shows dominance more than a military parade. To the people of Urga, a military parade is more of a holiday than a display of power, owing to the newness of the concept. Regardless of whether the crowd is satiated by fun or fear, it will help secure our rule in the city."

 MON_ungerns_secures_power: "Ungern Secures Power"
 MON_ungerns_secures_power_desc: "Finally, Ungern-Sternberg and his Russian military clique have defeated the opposition, and have once again taken the reins of the nation. Renewed by the vigour of military victory, the Russian-led junta is ready to make their postulations into reality."

 MON_increased_military_funding: "Increase Military Funding"
 MON_increased_military_funding_desc: "It is clear that the reason for the Western Revolt was that military funding was not high enough. With war with China inevitable, we must increase it massively if we are to survive."

 MON_cavalry_primacy: "Cavalry Primacy"

 MON_increase_gun_production: "Invest in Weapon Research"
 MON_increase_gun_production_desc: "Our weapons are old and becoming redundant. Some are still relics from the Weltkrieg. Research into better weapons is necessary if we are to survive against Chinese aggression."

 MON_aggressive_industrialisation: "Aggressive Industrialisation"
 MON_aggressive_industrialisation_desc: "Much of the population lives a nomadic lifestyle, not in the cities or towns. Due to this, the low population, and the harsh conditions, Mongolia's industry is very lacking. We should give businessmen and investors the ability to invest in Mongolia even if they break our already weak laws about workers rights. In fact, it should even be encouraged!"

 MON_train_the_nomads: "Train the Nomads"
 MON_train_the_nomads_desc: "The nomadic population of the steppes is too disunited and not trained enough to be a strong military force. Great training is needed to be able to make war like we must."

 MON_create_mil_factory_angrily: "Set Unattainable Goals"
 MON_create_mil_factory_angrily_desc: "In state owned factories, we should set goals that are completely unattainable for the workers, so they are encouraged to work harder as they hopelessly try to reach their targets, otherwise a beating awaits."

 MON_marshal_of_the_steppes: "Baron of the Steppes"
 MON_marshal_of_the_steppes_desc: "Though Mongolia's large empty steppes make it hard to govern all its nomadic peoples, it must be made clear that Ungern-Sternberg is the Baron of all Mongolian people."

 MON_look_at_russia_policy: "Reform Russia Policy"
 MON_look_at_russia_policy_desc: "With Ungern-Sternberg in power, we have always been relatively close with Russia. Now that both our and their situation has changed, we have the opportunity to change our policy towards them."

 MON_russia_friendship_desc: "The Russians are the brothers of Mongolians. Our relationship must remain close if we are to survive."

 MON_give_russians_citizenship: "Give Russians Citizenship"
 MON_give_russians_citizenship_desc: "After Ungern-Sternberg's invasion of Mongolia, many Russians joined him. Since then, a constant stream of Russian people have come in from the north. They should be allowed to become full citizens to show our full relationship with the northern regime."

 MON_military_mission_to_russia: "Military Mission to Russia"
 MON_military_mission_to_russia_desc: "Our military was for years supported by Russian officers, some directly sent from Russia. It is time to ask once again for Russian support."

 MON_conscript_siberian_russians: "Restart Economic Aid"
 MON_conscript_siberian_russians_desc: "Economic aid from Russia was ended following the chaos resulting from the assassination of Kerensky. With both of our governments now stable, there is no reason not to restart this aid."

 MON_promote_cooperation_between_us_desc: "We should promote cooperation between Mongolians and Russians to the Mongolian people who are not yet convinced about our friendship."

 MON_request_arms: "Rectify Arms Treaties"

 MON_encourage_mongol_identity: "Promote Mongol Identity"
 MON_encourage_mongol_identity_desc: "If we are to abandon Russian safety, we should promote Mongolism to keep the nation united."

 MON_recruit_chinese_mongols: "Attract Chinese Mongols"
 MON_recruit_chinese_mongols_desc: "Many Mongolian people are trapped under Chinese control. We should try to attract them to immigrate here, so that they can serve us."

 MON_claim_transsiberian_railway_land: "Claim Trans-Siberian Railway"
 MON_claim_transsiberian_railway_land_desc: "The Trans-Siberian Railway that runs over Mongolia has massive Mongolian minorities. It is rightful Mongolian clay, and though we are very unlikely to take it, it is a strong show of force for our people to claim it."

 MON_we_stand_alone: "We Stand Alone"

 MON_centralised_power_under_sternberg: "Centralised Power Under Ungern-Sternberg"
 MON_centralised_power_under_sternberg_desc: "One of the problems that caused the revolt in the West and the chaos that descended into Urga was because we were forced to share power. The radical Buddhists and rich princes had large power in our government. Now, with them defeated, we can centralise power under Ungern-Sternberg, so that he can protect the nation."

 MON_propaganda_in_the_cities: "Propaganda in the Cities"
 MON_propaganda_in_the_cities_desc: "With the cities being the only main population groups in the nation, a massive propaganda campaign should be started in them, to entrench the idea that conformity to the state is required to survive."

 MON_statue_in_urga: "Destroy the Socialists"
 MON_statue_in_urga_desc: "Though the socialist MAN were unable to take power months ago during the Western Revolt, they still control some small cells, primarily in the hard to reach north of the nation. These cells must be completely destroyed if we are to be safe from the communist threat."

 MON_young_officer_recruitment: "Young Officer Schools"
 MON_young_officer_recruitment_desc: "We should try to get the best officers we can for our military, and a great way to do this is to start training them from a young age. The opening of multiple young officer schools in Mongolia should help bolster our officer class."

 MON_pledge_alligence_to_sternberg: "Full Allegiance to Ungern"
 MON_pledge_alligence_to_sternberg_desc: "The people must be taught that they do not have a choice in serving Ungern-Sternberg. The state and the Baron must come first in life, and everything they do should be to help the state survive and thrive."

 MON_encourage_myths_about_sternberg: "Encourage Myths and Legends"
 MON_encourage_myths_about_sternberg_desc: "Most Mongolians still believe much folklore and myths about history and current life. Many people even believe Ungern-Sternberg to be the reincarnation of Jamsaran, the God of War. Though it would not be stately to directly confirm these myths, we should secretly encourage these myths across the nation, so that people continue to fear the Baron."

 MON_the_legend_lives_on: "The Legend Lives on"

 MON_declare_sternberg_a_traitor: "Ungern, the Traitor"
 MON_declare_sternberg_a_traitor_desc: "Some in Mongolia truly believe that the butcher Ungern-Sternberg is good for Mongolia! An anti-Ungern propaganda campaign should be started, informing people of how brutal the Baron's rule has been."

 MON_peasant_march_in_urga: "Peasant March in the Capital"
 MON_peasant_march_in_urga_desc: "It is time for the peasants' voices to be heard! A march through the capital should show that the people must be heard, and we will wait no longer!"

 MON_seize_princes_wealth: "Seize the Nobles' Wealth"

 MON_political_freedoms: "Anti-Socialism"
 MON_political_freedoms_desc: "The socialist MAN party have gone too far. The people must be taught that socialism does not help them, but squabbles in internal struggles and control the people while running the country into ruin."

 MON_status_of_prince_de: "The Popular Prince"
 MON_status_of_prince_de_desc: "Prince Demchugdongrub, though he took part in trying to take over the nation during the Western Revolt, is still very popular in the traditional areas of the nation. Ünenbayan, on the other hand, does not share this popularity. Perhaps it is time for him to step down, and allow Demchugdongrub to take his place."

 MON_pander_to_buddhists: "Pander to Buddhists"
 MON_pander_to_buddhists_desc: "Religion is not a major point for the princes, but for the population it is very important. Appealing to Buddhists will help weaken the power of the Buddyn Zövlöl."

 MON_destroy_the_buddhist_council: "Destroy the Buddyn Zövlöl"
 MON_destroy_the_buddhist_council_desc: "All of our resources must be used to crush the power of the Buddyn Zövlöl, to stop their radical Buddhists from coming to power and threatening our rule."

 MON_silence_poorer_citizens: "Silence the Impoverished"

 MON_empower_landowners: "Empower Landowners"
 MON_empower_landowners_desc: "Rich landowners are some of our main supporters in Mongolia, and control much of the land that many peasants work on. They should be empowered in law to help stop the peasant uprising."

 MON_national_citizen_guard: "National Citizen Guard"
 MON_national_citizen_guard_desc: "Many of the peasants do support our regime, as they know they are unable to make the right decision themselves and trust us to handle it. We should form the National Citizen Guard, a group of peasant militia to fight against rebel peasants."

 MON_review_the_budget: "Review the Budget"
 MON_review_the_budget_desc: "Spending was increased massively under the regime of Ungern-Sternberg. Failed industrialisation schemes, poor army funding and paying off the Russian government has left the nation lacking money. We must decide what we are to do."

 MON_continue_status_quo: "Continue the Status Quo"
 MON_continue_status_quo_desc: "The status quo is what helps keep us in power. Traditionalism is the basis of Mongolia, and this should be continued and encouraged."

 MON_cut_costs: "Cut Unnecessary Costs"
 MON_cut_costs_desc: "It is clear that spending has become out of control under the Baron's rule. Though it will be hard, these cuts must be made."

 MON_landowners_rights_act: "Landowners Rights Act"
 MON_landowners_rights_act_desc: "Rights to landowners which we put into law during the chaos of the Western Revolt should be organised and increased into the Landowners Rights Act, giving landowners far reaching power."

 MON_encourage_nomadism: "Encourage Nomadism"
 MON_encourage_nomadism_desc: "Much of Mongolia's population is completely nomadic, moving around through the year rather than settling permanently. This idea is enshrined in Mongolian society, and people in the city should instead be encouraged to go out there, so they are easier to control."

 MON_encourage_foreign_business: "Encourage Business Growth"
 MON_encourage_foreign_business_desc: "Other than Russian business, the Baron's rule has starved us of foreign investment. We should encourage this if we are to survive and thrive in the modern world."

 MON_dissolve_organisations: "Dissolve Opposing Organisations"
 MON_dissolve_organisations_desc: "Since the chaos of the Western Revolt we have tolerated the existence of opposing organisations, but no more. We have secured our position enough to justify banning and dissolving these organisations."

 MON_statue_of_genghis: "Statue of the Khan"
 MON_statue_of_genghis_desc: "We as a nation must remember our history, and our greatest leader, Genghis Khan. He is a perfect example of the Mongol identity which we want to encourage. Therefore, a great statue of him should be constructed in Urga, to push this idea of Mongolism."

 MON_declare_nobles_traitors: "Declare the Nobles Traitors"
 MON_declare_nobles_traitors_desc: "The people listen to the lamas of Mongolia, and see them as trustworthy authority figures. The people must be informed that the noble princes are traitors to Mongolia."

 MON_slander_sternbergs_buddhism: "Slander Ungern's Buddhism"
 MON_slander_sternbergs_buddhism_desc: "The Mad Baron Ungern-Sternberg pretends to be a Buddhist icon. However, he is not even fully Buddhist at all, and does not have Mongolian roots. The people must be taught that they are being lied to."

 MON_end_russian_influence: "End Russian Influence"
 MON_end_russian_influence_desc: "Russian influence is pervasive in Mongolian society. This link must be cut, so that we can act alone."

 MON_distribute_aid_through_monasteries: "Distribute Aid through Monasteries"
 MON_distribute_aid_through_monasteries_desc: "The people who are struggling after the previous government abandoned them need help. We should give out aid through the monasteries to gain their support."

 MON_prosecute_non_buddhists: "Persecute non-Buddhists"
 MON_prosecute_non_buddhists_desc: "Non-Buddhists are generally rebellious types, fighting against our government. They do not belong in Mongolian society and the main ones should be persecuted."

 MON_theocratic_state: "The Theocratic State"
 MON_theocratic_state_desc: "Finally, Buddhism has won in Mongolia. We can now push to transform Mongolia to a religious theocracy much like that of Tibet or Bhutan."

 MON_militant_buddhism: "Militant Buddhism"
 MON_militant_buddhism_desc: "Buddhism, though many see it as a peaceful religion, can be interpreted to justify violence. We should encourage this militant Buddhism to protect the nation."

 MON_rally_for_buddhism: "Fight for the Jebtsundamba Khutuktu"
 MON_rally_for_buddhism_desc: "The Jebtsundamba Khutuktu is the key leader of Mongolia, and the head of our society. The troops must be trained that he is to be protected at all costs."

 MON_purge_the_military: "Purge Disloyal Officers"
 MON_purge_the_military_desc: "The officer class is full of disloyalty. These disloyal officers must be purged, and a new officer class must be created."

 MON_recruit_through_monasteries: "Recruit through Monasteries"
 MON_recruit_through_monasteries_desc: "The many monasteries of Mongolia get many visitors every day. It is a perfect place to recruit people into the army."

 MON_fight_to_the_death: "Fighting to the Death"
 MON_fight_to_the_death_desc: "People of Mongolia must be taught that the nation comes first, rather than their own life. Protecting Buddhism and Mongolian society is more important than survival for Mongolian people."

 MON_lama_officers: "Lama Officers"
 MON_lama_officers_desc: "The Lamas are some of the most intelligent and skilled leaders in Mongolian society. They should act as officers, rather than purely military men."

 MON_buddhist_education: "Buddhist Education"
 MON_buddhist_education_desc: "The education of Mongolia must be completely reformed, to instead become an education based on Buddhism. Children should be taught from a young age that Buddhism is how they should live their lives."

 MON_teach_in_monasteries: "Teach in Monasteries"
 MON_teach_in_monasteries_desc: "Monasteries are the perfect place to teach our new Buddhist education. This should be encouraged."

 MON_ban_all_other_religions: "Ban All Opposing Religions"
 MON_ban_all_other_religions_desc: "Other religions are dangerous for Mongolian society. Mongolia is a Buddhist nation, and therefore Buddhism should be the only legal religion."

 MON_develop_other_religions: "Develop Other Religions"
 MON_develop_other_religions_desc: "Other minor religions in Mongolia should be allowed to remain legal, so as not to anger the people. Instead, these religions should be developed to help support Buddhism and Mongolian society."

 MON_destroy_shamanism: "Destroy Shamanism"
 MON_destroy_shamanism_desc: "Shamanism is followed by small, mostly nomadic groups in Mongolia. They should be forced to instead follow Buddhism or face persecution."

 MON_evolve_shamanism: "Evolve Shamanism"
 MON_evolve_shamanism_desc: "Shamanism can be evolved and altered, to instead act as a form of Buddhism for these nomadic societies that still follow it."

 MON_allow_shamanism: "Allow Shamanism"
 MON_allow_shamanism_desc: "We cannot ban a religion that is very traditional to Mongolia, even if it goes against our government. Genghis Khan allowed freedom of religion, and so should we."

 MON_develop_rural_villages: "Develop Rural Villages"
 MON_develop_rural_villages_desc: "Rural villages, small communities in the steppes of Mongolia, are struggling massively, especially in the west following the recent revolt. These groups must be developed so that they can become self-sustainable."

 MON_support_the_fellow_man: "Support the Fellow Man"

 MON_benevolent_lamas: "Benevolent Lamas"
 MON_benevolent_lamas_desc: "Some of the lamas of our society are relatively wealthy, and should be encouraged to act in benevolence to help the poor."

 MON_nomadic_economy: "Taming the Nomadic Economy"
 MON_nomadic_economy_desc: "Mongolia is a sparsely populated nation, with about half of the population living nomadically on the steppes. This is a major challenge for economic planners, and will have to be kept in mind as we bring Mongolia into modernity. As we begin our economic reforms, we shall push for greater record-keeping and oversight over arable land as well as push to modernise our agricultural infrastructure."

 MON_uliastai_factory: "Uliastai Industrialisation Project"
 MON_uliastai_factory_desc: "Mongolia’s economy has traditionally been very pastoral, but in order to ensure its future prosperity and independence, an effort must be made to foster a domestic industrial base. The hub of our latest efforts at creating a light industry shall be in Uliastai, a city in Western Mongolia. With some incentives and interventions, we will focus on processing animal products and providing manufactured goods for our agricultural domestic market."

 MON_fund_nomadic_development: "Fund Nomad Development"
 MON_fund_nomadic_development_desc: "Aid to nomadic clans is key to help people thrive across the steppes and ensure their continued loyalty. Nomads are particularly at the mercy of winter, with challenges maintaining a viable flock. By providing resources to help protect their animals from disease and inclement weather, we will alleviate the burden they face each year. Combined with the promotion of a new mining and timber industry, we will eliminate rural economic stagnation and bring new prosperity!"

 MON_expand_urga_industry: "Develop Urga’s Infrastructure"
 MON_expand_urga_industry_desc: "Urga is our largest city and capital, but frankly only qualifies as a city at all on a seasonal basis. As our government’s seat of power and the symbol of the reforms we seek to bring to Mongolia, it is imperative that we invest in permanent infrastructure to and within the city. New roads and bridges will be constructed, connecting outlying villages to Urga, and old ones will be refurbished. This will be the foundation of our burgeoning economy."

 MON_military_factory: "Commission Military Factory"
 MON_military_factory_desc: "Mongolia does not have a large native arms industry and that has historically put us at a disadvantage in our dealings with our neighbours. Our few domestically produced arms are handcrafted, which include beautiful but hopelessly outdated muskets and bows. Though our budget is tight and industry still in its infancy, our leaders are nonetheless determined. They might not be the newest or finest guns, but with great effort Mongolia will see its first weapon's plant!"

 MON_weapons_development: "Weapons Development"
 MON_weapons_development_desc: "Our weapons are of an extremely poor standard, mostly surplus weapons given to us by great powers when we were vassals. Many are old enough to be relics in a museum! If we are to keep our independence, it is imperative that we have a centralised and effective method of arms procurement. Licences and contracts will have to be made with foreign designers, no doubt at a price, but our Ministry of Defence will have weapons on par with our foes."

 MON_start_mongol_highway: "The Trans-Mongolian Railway"
 MON_start_mongol_highway_desc: "The Trans-Mongolian Railway has gone through numerous planning stages and development pitfalls, but the dream has remained the same: the creation of a massive railway across the steppes. With our relative independence from both Beijing and Moscow and new-found domestic stability, it is time we finally bring these plans out of the drawing board and into reality. Our government will finally back a venture to start laying down tracks to better connect Mongolia together!"

 MON_khovd_factory: "Khovd Factory"
 MON_khovd_factory_desc: "Khovd is another western Mongolian city that is in urgent need of industrial development. Taking inspiration from our work in the neighbouring Uliastai, we will begin a programme of domestic industrial investment, focusing on light industrial products capable of servicing the region’s farmers. Our burgeoning industrial economy will allow us to fund further projects to better extract Mongolia’s rich natural resources for foreign export."

 MON_military_focus: "The Mongolian Military"
 MON_military_focus_desc: "The Mongolian military is dominated by mounted troops, who are able to navigate the vast flat steppes. These mounted forces have protected us for many years, but as the world begins to change so must we. A modern military is needed, and so a new military commission has been established to oversee the implementation of military reforms across Mongolia. May they continue to defend our home and our people!"

 MON_military_factory2: "Further Military Development"
 MON_military_factory2_desc: "With our weapons procurement project well underway, our troops are better supplied and equipped, but the same can be said of our enemies. Mongolia's continued security is a moving target and to meet future challenges we must go further with fostering our domestic defence industry. Funds will be directed towards new munitions plants and hiring foreign experts. We may not trust all of our neighbours, but we will be able to trust our heroic soldiers!"

 MON_small_arms_development: "New Production Techniques"
 MON_small_arms_development_desc: "New weapons designs must be acquired to supply our troops with modern arms. Moreover, while we have made great strides in our production techniques, there are many areas where we are lacking both in quality and quantity. Using the foreign blueprints and technicians we can get our hands on, and having our domestic designers fill in the gaps, we will seek to continue to keep Mongolia’s military competitive."

 MON_doctrine_development: "Review our Methods"
 MON_doctrine_development_desc: "The instability of China has allowed us to gain de facto independence, and years of fighting both foreign invaders and ourselves has given us an experienced, if outdated, military. With our nation now fully united, it is time to begin consolidating the lessons our men have learned and building a modern Mongolian military. The methods of our military should be looked into, to see whether we could reform our military to become more effective."

 MON_work_with_our_territory: "Work With Our Territory"
 MON_work_with_our_territory_desc: "We must understand that the territory of our nation is very difficult to transverse and fight in, ranging from flat steppes to steep hills and treacherous mountains. Either we can be cowed by it or we can work with our natural environment. Outposts will be created, supply bases created, safe routes charted out, and amiable connections with helpful locals will give us a leg up in moving and defending our home. While our enemies struggle with the terrain, we will be right at home."

 MON_recruit_to_the_army: "Recruitment Effort"
 MON_recruit_to_the_army_desc: "With such a low population, Mongolia needs every soldier it can reasonably get. Now that our domestic troubles have been resolved, at least for now, we need to begin a new recruitment plan to increase our numbers. We will begin by streamlining recruitment and more carefully documenting our rosters to eliminate ‘ghost soldiers’ and desertions. An army capable of modern warfare must move away from seasonal levies and militias and aim towards more reliable professionals."

 MON_train_officers: "Train our Officers"
 MON_train_officers_desc: "Many officers in Mongolia are poorly trained, and forced to learn by experience. With the establishment of the National Defence University, it is now time to begin creating a new curriculum for our cadets. Our faculty primarily consist of veterans from Mongolia’s various border wars and foreign military advisors. Together they have been instructed to create a modern doctrine tailored towards the needs of the steppes."

 MON_recruit_nomads: "Nomadic Recruitment Policy"
 MON_recruit_nomads_desc: "The nomadic peoples living in Mongolia are adept at horseback riding but can be difficult to keep track of for conscription. Careful negotiations with tribal leaders and greater sign-on bonuses will allow us to better access nomadic populations for potential recruits. Their experience is invaluable and will be a great boon for our reorganised defence forces."

 MON_recruit_from_tribes: "Tribal Recruitment Policy"
 MON_recruit_from_tribes_desc: "Some clans are rather isolated and remain untapped potential for military enlistment. By building inroads, material concessions and the possibility of a new life away from impoverished rural regions, we can further swell our ranks with hardy soldiers. In addition, now that our government’s stability is no longer in doubt we can begin to recruit the veterans of the defeated factions of our civil war and incorporate them into our army."

 MON_urga_officer_school: "Urga Officer School"
 MON_urga_officer_school_desc: "In Mongolia, military training has been mostly ad hoc, with most officers taught on the job or in their own homes. To rectify this, in 1921 Baron von Ungern-Sternberg built a small academy in Urga. The elegant, Russian-styled facility is one of the few permanently standing buildings in the city, but it was shuttered by recent fighting. We will begin with recruiting instructors and opening cadet applications soon."

 MON_develop_radio_technology: "Develop Radio Technology"
 MON_develop_radio_technology_desc: "Mongolia is a large, sparsely populated nation and its people are divided by long distances and high mountains. Radio and electronic technology has great potential to help solve this divide. Furthermore, Radios have been used since the Weltkrieg for effective communications between generals and their soldiers. If we are to defend our homes, incorporating radios into our doctrines is a must!"

 MON_under_the_chinese_desc: "We once again find ourselves beneath the Chinese boot. We must carry out the directives of our benefactors to the south."

 MON_national_unity_front: "National Unity Front"
 MON_national_unity_front_desc: "Few political parties are willing to cooperate with the Chinese. Despite this, to create the illusion of independence from China to external observers, we have been directed to create a broad unity. We must create new shell parties across the political spectrum to accomplish this."

 MON_reorganise_military_structure: "Reorganise Military Structure"
 MON_reorganise_military_structure_desc: "The Chinese have a fundamentally different attitude towards warefare than our people do. To facilitate cooperation and reduce military independence, we should bring our structures in line with those of China."

 MON_chinese_military_officers: "Chinese Officers"
 MON_chinese_military_officers_desc: "The Chinese have much to teach our people about warfare. We should integrate loyal ethnically Chinese officers into our forces."

 MON_purge_the_resistance_desc: "Many rural Mongolians refuse to recognise our government. We must show them the error of their ways."

 MON_chinese_immigration: "Chinese Immigration"

 MON_chinese_loyalty: "Loyalty to China"
 MON_chinese_loyalty_desc: "We should begin to promote the idea of Mongolia as both separate and a part of China. Slowly but surely the Mongol people will become loyal to China."

 MON_kuomintang: "Mongolian KMT"
 MON_kuomintang_desc: "The Kuomintang have triumphed over the old Mongol regime. The Mongolian Kuomintang, once languishing in obscurity has burst onto the scene to lead the new Mongolia forward, hand in hand with China."

 MON_begin_land_reform: "Begin Land Reform"
 MON_begin_land_reform_desc: "Land reform is an essential part of the KMT's platform, both right and left. The rural estates should be given over to those who work and graze them."

 MON_push_for_industrialisation: "Push for Industrialisation"
 MON_push_for_industrialisation_desc: "Economic modernisation is essential both for our nation to compete on the world stage and to integrate our economy with that of China. First, more formal cottage industries should be transformed into modern workshops."

 MON_kmt_military: "The Mongolian NRA"
 MON_kmt_military_desc: "The army should be reorganised on the principles of the National Revolutionary Army of the KMT."

 MON_kmt_propaganda: "Kuomintang Propaganda"
 MON_kmt_propaganda_desc: "The Kuomintang recognises the value of communication. We must widely publicise our platform."

 MON_kmt_mongolia: "Kuomintang Control"
 MON_kmt_mongolia_desc: "We must fully unite with the Chinese Kuomintang in thought. By promoting the commonality of our struggle and place in the world, slowly but surely the Mongol people will become loyal to the Kuomintang."

 MON_country_intro_header: "History of Mongolia"
 MON_country_intro_content: "Mongolia was under the control of the Manchu Qing Dynasty for centuries, until the 1911 Xinhai Revolution led to Mongolian independence under the 8th Jebtsundamba Khutuktu, the head of Mongolian Buddhism, who took the title of the Bogd Khan. China still claimed Mongolia as Chinese territory, and Mongolia's independence was shattered in 1919, when Xu Shuzheng, a Chinese warlord of the Anhui Clique, occupied the country. However, in 1920, Roman von Ungern-Sternberg, a White Russian military leader, leading his Asiatic Cavalry Division, took Urga from the Chinese, and restored the Bogd Khan.\n\nUngern enforced his rule with an iron fist, crushing revolts and dissidents while making deals with the aristocratic Mongol Princes. The Mongol Ardīn Nam, a socialist party inspired by the Bolsheviks, was formed, and began a revolution in 1921 to overthrow Ungern's regime. Due to lack of foreign support, this revolution failed, and the MAN were forced to go into hiding. Following the death of the Bogd Khan in 1924, the MAN rebelled again, claiming Ungern no longer held any legitimacy in the country. This revolution was harshly repressed, and multiple senior members of the MAN were executed, and the MAN were forced into hiding once more. In this time, Ungern made deals with the Russian government, for economic and military support. Ungern was also able to seize Xilingol from the Chinese Guominjun. Ungern's rule was still shaky, however, and following a series of peasant uprisings in 1930 led primarily by Buddhist lamas, Ungern purged many high ranking lamas in his government, destroying much of the support he had accrued over the years.\n\nWith the death of the Bogd Khan, the hunt began for the 9th reincarnation of the Jebtsundamba Khutuktu, who was eventually found in 1933 in Lhasa, Tibet. He was brought to Urga, to be pruned for leadership while Ungern rules as regent until he is old enough. "
 mon.1.a: "What about now?"

 MON_country_intro_header_1: "The Current Situation"
 MON_country_intro_content_1: "In 1936, Ungern's rule remains under threat. Four main cliques dominate Mongolian political society.\n\nThe Rossiyskaya Voyennaya Klika are a clique of White Russian officers under the leadership of Ungern-Sternberg. They focus on cooperation with Russia, military strength and anti-socialism. They currently lead the country, working with the Noyodyn Zövlöl and the Buddyn Zövlöl.\n\nThe Noyodyn Zövlöl is the name of the council of Mongolian Princes and nobles, who had been the country's ruling class for centuries. Focusing on keeping their wealth and power secure, they are de facto led by the Inner Mongolian Prince Demchugdongrub and are dominated by Inner Mongolian Princes from Xilingol.\n\nThe Buddyn Zövlöl are a council of high ranking Buddhist lamas in Mongolia, which was formed following Ungern's purge of lamas in 1930. Members of the council are fanatic Buddhists who wish to turn Mongolia into a truly theocratic society. They are led by the 7th Changkya Khutukhtu, a high-ranking lama from Inner Mongolia.\n\nThe Mongol Ardīn Nam, the socialist party who rebelled in 1921 and 1924 remains in hiding, but is still a strong force to be reckoned with. Led by Davizavyn Losol, they have taken some inspiration from Russia's democracy and therefore have begun advocating for multiparty democracy.\n\nMongolia also faces external threats. For many years, border skirmishes have taken place between the Muslim Chinese Ma Clique and Mongolian troops across the border. A similar situation occurs in the Xinjiang Clique's Dzungaria region. The main point of tension is the province of Yushu, which has swapped hands between Tibet and the Ma Clique over the past few years. The province is a powderkeg waiting to explode, and when it does, the opportunity to unite the Mongolian people cannot be ignored."

### Events ###
 mon.2.t: "Ja Lama's Bandits Spotted In Western Mongolia"
 mon.2.d: "Our nation is regularly plagued by banditry and raiding. Due to its sheer size compared to its minimal population, it is difficult to find these bandits and bring them to justice. However, following Ungern's ascension to power in 1920, he clamped down hard, sending his forces out into the deepest areas of Mongolia to root out bandit groups. The brutality of Ungern's forces have become rather famous in Mongolia, mercilessly torturing and killing any bandits, criminals, or resistance fighters they found. Many outlaws went into hiding, for fear of being executed by what have become known as Ungern's 'Death Squads'.\n\nHowever, over the years, Ungern has been having more and more trouble in keeping Mongolia in his grip. MAN rebels still disrupt supply lines, and bandit activity has been growing more and more, especially in the west where troops are spread very thin. With Russian money we were able to put down bandit forces, through force and bribery. However, with Russia withdrawing their aid, many bandit groups seem to be coming out of their caves, most notably Ja Lama's Yum-Beise bandits. Ja Lama was an independence fighter, radical lama and warlord in the 1910s, who tried to establish an independent Oirat Empire. Though Ungern was an admirer of his, he murdered all the envoys we sent to him, and went into hiding. With Russian aid ending, and unrest growing in the west, it appears Ja Lama's followers are uniting again, even though it is assumed Ja Lama himself is dead."
 mon.2.a: "We will keep an eye on this."

 #mon.3.t: "Ja Lama's bandits confirmed to have started actions again"
 #mon.3.d: ""
 #mon.3.a: "This could be the beginning of something bad..."

 mon.4.t: "Bandits Raid Khovd Villages"
 mon.4.d: "It appears that the rumours of the Yum-Beise bandits uniting once again are true. There are reports that multiple small nomadic villages just north of Khovd have been raided by the group. By the time some government forces got there to evaluate, the villages were deserted, with most gers being either torn down or in ashes. The bandits could be seen far in the distance, but our forces did not give chase, primarily due to the immense size of the group. The party was reportedly an extremely large size, and worse still, in the rubble of the villages, flags and text of the banned Mongol Ardīn Nam were found. Perhaps this is not mere banditry."
 mon.4.a: "This is a one time thing, right?"

 #mon.5.t: "Bandits pillage western monastery"
 #mon.5.d: ""
 #mon.5.a: "We must deal with this."

 mon.6.t: "Bandits Defeat Local Militia"
 mon.6.d: "Following the raids on nearby villages, a local tribal chief decided to act. He gathered a small force of militia from nearby tribes and villages, armed with whatever weapons they owned, mostly sword or archaic rifles, and travelled out to confront them. 100 men marched with him, and hopes were high. It was assumed there would be little proper resistance, and the bandit party would disperse at the first sign of a battle\n\nIt was a massacre. Only a few of the chief's men on horseback were able to make it out of the confrontation alive. These survivors told stories of how the group was massive, perhaps over a thousand men, armed with rifles smuggled in from Russia and China. One of the survivors even claims that he saw multiple figures, like MAN leader Davizavyn Losol, warlord Ja Lama and even Genghis Khan himself. Though some of these reports can be disregarded as simple madness, the fact that Davizavyn Losol was even mentioned next to legendary figures like Genghis Khan is worrying."
 mon.6.a: "Are we blind? Deploy the Khovd garrison!"

 mon.7.t: "Khovd City Guard Lay Down Arms"
 mon.7.d: "After sending out an official command to the garrison in Khovd, we received a peculiar response. The leading officer stationed in Khovd has sent us a message, stating:\n\n\"My troops refuse to fight against their brothers. For too long, we have received nothing from Urga apart for demands that we kill our own countrymen. The only thing you, Ungern-Sternberg, have done for us, is murder our families in the name of securing your corrupt regime. It is time for change.\"\n\nSince this message, we have received nothing from either Khovd nor the nearby city of Uliastai, the administrative capital of the region. All we have received is letters from chiefs and village leaders in the west, either pleading for help from the \"revolutionary masses\", or declaring that they no longer align with our government."
 mon.7.a: "What is going on?"

 mon.8.t: "The Western Revolt"
 mon.8.d: "The situation in the west is far worse than we could have imagined. Over the past few years the western region of the country has grown heavily dependent on aid and investment from Russia. With Russian withdrawal of aid, and many Russian businessmen pulling out their investments, the economy of the west collapsed. With that, radical lamas, power-hungry warlords, and the socialist Mongol Ardīn Nam swept in and gained mass support, and formed a loose anti-government coalition. Now, earlier today, the mayors of Uliastai and Khovd have declared their allegiance to the rebels, and have dismissed any pro-Ungern officials from their administrations.\n\nIt appears we have lost control of the west of the country, and though our military strength is far greater than that of the rebels, the chaos this revolt will cause gives Ungern's opponents in Urga the chance to dismantle his regime."
 mon.8.a: "These rebels must be crushed!"

 mon.9.t: "The Battle of Ulaangom"
 mon.9.d: "Following the start of the Western Revolt, the town of Ulaangom, north of Khovd and on the border with Tuva, declared their allegiance to the rebels. However, a government-owned military base was very nearby, and upon hearing of the revolt, began a march to Ulaangom to retake it for Ungern's government.\n\nAfter hearing of the march of pro-government troops, the local leader of the Mongol Ardīn Nam, the school teacher Banzarjavyn Baasanjav, hastily invigorated the peasants of the town to fight to defend it. They quickly put up makeshift barricades, and were supplied with weapons from a Tuvan merchant who was travelling through the town to deliver Russian weapons to Khovd. As the government forces began to approach, Baasanjav gave one last inspirational speech to the peasants, talking of how it was likely they would be defeated, but it was worth it for the greater cause. However, in a surprising twist, the peasants of Ulaangom were able to fend off the government forces, with much of the town being destroyed in the process. News of this surprise victory is travelling fast, with the MAN revolutionaries trying to push this as a Mongolian victory against its Russian oppressors, and with pro-government military commanders realising they cannot underestimate the strength of the rebels."
 mon.9.a: "Damn."

 mon.10.t: "Demchugdongrub meets with Noyodyn Zövlöl"
 mon.10.d: "An emergency meeting of the Noyodyn Zövlöl, led by the aristocratic prince Demchugdongrub, has taken place today. The Mongol prices play a large part in our government, and we received large amounts of wealth from taxes on their land and wealth. It is likely the princes are fearful of the Western Revolt, with it being a threat to their power. However, perhaps there is something more to this. Prince Demchugdongrub has not made it a secret that he believes Ungern should be replaced by an ethnic Mongol. Whether he intends for that to be him, or if he will continue to support the Ungern regime, only time will tell."
 mon.10.a: "This is suspicious..."

 mon.11.t: "The Buddyn Zövlöl demand we allocate funds to repair raided monasteries"
 mon.11.d: "The Buddyn Zövlöl, the secretive council who are suspected of directly funding radical lamas currently taking part in the Western Revolt, have sent our government an official demand that more funding is allocated to monastery repair and protection in the west. With that region of the country in chaos, they state that it is the government's duty to protect the institutions that are the key of Mongolian society. However, the amount of funding they demand is ridiculous, and it would be a massive burden to raise it by ourselves."
 mon.11.a: "We cannot spare the money."
 mon.11.b: "Set aside some funds to get it done."
 mon.11.c: "Tax the nobility to afford the cost."

 mon.12.t: "Bandits Burn Altai City, Hundreds Homeless"
 mon.12.d: "A group of bandits in the west have completely destroyed Altai City, raiding it for food and money, then razing the buildings to the ground. This has left hundreds of people without homes or food. It is our duty to try to help these people, but there are issues, primarily with securing the money for the aid and getting it to the people safely. Our main source of money currently is from the nobles' treasuries, but continuing to take their money will lead to further disdain from them. There is another option, however. We could also secretly send the aid to the MAN rebels, who will reach Altai. Although it will make MAN look like the heroes, it will possibly save the lives of hundreds of people, or at least dissuade some of them from joining the rebellion."
 mon.12.a: "This isn't our problem."
 mon.12.b: "Seize nobles' money to pay for aid."
 mon.12.c: "Secretly cooperate with MAN to get the people aid."

 mon.13.t: "Chaos in the Capital!"
 mon.13.d: "With the Western Revolt in full swing, and rebels controlling key cities in the region, most of the army and senior military commanders have been forced to leave Urga. The modern Mongolian army is dominated at higher levels with Russian staff, who hold extreme loyalty to Ungern and are members of his informal RVK. The loyalty of these key army figures is one of the main reasons Ungern was able to remain in power and entrench his regime.\n\nThe issue for Ungern is obvious. With most of the RVK leaving Urga to deal with the west, opposing political factions are finally seeing their chance to act. The Mongol Ardīn Nam have always had a strong presence in Urga, and there are rumours that many senior MAN officials like Davizavyn Losol and Anandyn Amar have travelled to the city. Both the Buddyn Zövlöl and the Mongol princes hold great influence in our government, and both stand ready to take over if given the chance. Ungern must walk a fine line between the factions if he is to survive the next few months..."
 mon.13.a: "The rule of Ungern is under threat!"

 mon.14.t: "Monastery destroyed in siege"
 mon.14.d: "After a minor skirmish just outside Khovd between government forces and some rebel peasants, a nearby lama gave them refuge in his monastery. Government troops demanded the lama relinquish the rebels, but he refused, and the peasants opened fire from inside the monastery. The government troops were able to defeat the rebels, but by the time the skirmish was over the lama was dead and the monastery had half collapsed. The Buddyn Zövlöl heard the news, and have requested we set aside funds to immediately begin the reconstruction of the monastery."
 mon.14.a: "We can't deal with that."
 mon.14.b: "Seize nobles' wealth to pay for repairs."
 mon.14.c: "We will find the funds somewhere..."

 mon.15.t: "Rebels take Khem-Beldyr"
 mon.15.d: "After weeks of fighting and battles in the west, government troops are beginning to beat the rebels and bandits down. A couple of battalions have been laying siege to Khovd for a few days, their numbers bolstered by peasants tired of the chaos. Due to this, the road to the new centre of the rebellion, Uliastai, has been blocked, and some of the more organised rebels have been cut off. Instead of trying to defend Khovd, these rebels have instead moved into the lightly defended Tuvan capital of Khem-Beldyr, and have easily taken the city. It will have to be reclaimed before the rebellion is beaten."
 mon.15.a: "Damn."

 mon.16.t: "Uliastai Becomes the Epicentre"
 mon.16.d: "With Khovd falling back into government hands a few days ago, Uliastai has officially become the centre of the continued revolt. It has become clear the city will have to be soundly retaken before the rebellion is actually beaten, as it is necessary for the administration of the western region."
 mon.16.a: "We cannot let this stand."

 mon.17.t: "Chahars clash with settled Khalkha Mongols"
 mon.17.d: "Mongolia is a nation made up of many ethnicities who all fall under the title of Mongolian. Though Khalkha Mongols make up the majority of the overall population, the west is dominated by different tribes of Oirats, and in Xilingol in Inner Mongolia, society is dominated by the Chahar Mongols. There has been animosity between Khalkha and Chahar Mongols in the region for decades for many reasons, most recently because a majority of Xu Shuzheng's force that occupied Mongolia in 1919 were Chahar Mongols, who treated the Khalkha Mongols extremely poorly. With some of the peacekeeping military leaders of the region being forced to move to the west, tensions have flared in Xilingol once again, with Chahars and Khalkha groups clashing, and banditry from both sides increasing."
 mon.17.a: "Are we not all Mongolian?"

 mon.18.t: "The Rebels are Losing Ground"
 mon.18.d: "As expected, following a few months of open revolt in the west, the rebels are losing ground fast. With most of their forces moving to the cities and towns, government forces were easily able to crush any stragglers left behind. Victory against the rebels in the west could be only weeks away, so we must secure our position politically."
 mon.18.a: "Excellent."

 mon.19.t: "Bandits Crush Nomadic Village"
 mon.19.d: "With the rebels losing ground, many of the small rebel cells have begun to get more extreme. A large group of refugees have just reached the recently retaken Khovd, telling stories of how their nomadic village had been pillaged by bandits and outlaws. This has occurred multiple times now in Khovd, and it is becoming clear the city will need funding to be able to house and feed the influx of refugees from the steppes."
 mon.19.a: "We can spare the help."
 mon.19.b: "Khovd can handle itself."
 mon.19.c: "Pay assistance with nobles money."

 mon.20.t: "Hunger Riot in Urga"
 mon.20.d: "With government focus being on the Western Revolt and the political clashes in Urga, the people of the city have been forgotten. With shipments being raided by bandits and roads in disrepair, the poorest of the city are beginning to starve. Now, riots are beginning to break out in the poorest areas of the city, and if we are to remedy this we must send out some forces to protect food shipments, and distribute more expensive food to the lower classes."
 mon.20.a: "The princes will pay for it."
 mon.20.b: "Force the monks to deal with it."
 mon.20.c: "Put it down with force."
 mon.20.e: "Wait it out."

 mon.21.t: "Rezukhin in Mörön"
 mon.21.d: "Boris Rezukhin, Ungern's right hand man in his RVK, has been in the dark as to the happenings across the country for months. When revolt broke out in the west, Ungern sent him to Mörön to act as a bulwark against revolutionary activity spreading across the country. However, the roads between Mörön and Urga are poor at the best of times, and with bandit activity plaguing the nation, the government has been unable to communicate with him in weeks. We have finally learned what happened in the city, with some merchants travelling to Urga from Mörön, bringing stories of how the city became a hotbed for revolutionary activity, and Rezukhin implemented extremely brutal measures to crush it. No doubt this will hurt our popularity."
 mon.21.a: "Damn him!"

 mon.22.t: "Lamas Support the Buddyn Zövlöl"
 mon.22.d: "Though political chaos has engulfed Urga for months now, the lamas of the most notable monasteries have remained silent on which side they support. Though the Gandantegchinlen Monastery currently houses the 7th Changkya Khutukhtu, the lamas there have so far refused to pledge their support for him. However, just this morning, many of the lamas of the main monasteries in Urga have declared their support for the Buddyn Zövlöl, stating that they should solely lead the country, to keep Mongolian Buddhism safe."
 mon.22.a: "Interesting."

 mon.23.t: "Rebels bomb major buildings in Urga"
 mon.23.d: "With the government still locked in a political battle for Urga, many of the peasants in the city are suffering and feeling neglected. Crime has skyrocketed, and in response many peasants have begun taking part in terrorist activities. Early in the morning today, multiple bombs went off next to government buildings in Urga, including police stations, the Russian Consulate and a factory. The treasury remains low, but repairs for these buildings is urgently needed."
 mon.23.a: "The Nobles will pay."
 mon.23.b: "The lamas will pay."
 mon.23.c: "The peasants will pay."
 mon.23.e: "The army can provide free labour."

 mon.24.t: "Attacks on nobles in the streets of Urga"
 mon.24.d: "Peasants in Urga have also begun attacking some of the princes in the city, breaking into their estates, stealing their valuables and in some extreme examples even killing them. This is causing the aristocratic class to lose support in our government."
 mon.24.a: "Damn."

 mon.25.t: "MAN Support Growing"
 mon.25.d: "With the peasantry in Urga suffering due to the chaos, many have decided to join the socialist Mongol Ardīn Nam, feeling like the MAN are the only group truly representing their needs. MAN recruiters travel the streets, conscripting peasants of the city to join their cause."
 mon.25.a: "Interesting."

 mon.26.t: "Scouts Around Khem-Beldyr"
 mon.26.d: "Though Khem-Beldyr was taken by rebel troops, our scouts have been able to get a good idea of the happenings of the city. Currently, the rebels are facing harsh resistance in the city from the Tuvan population, who are not supportive of the rebellion against Ungern due to their Russian minority being highly supportive of Ungern's regime and not having heard of the chaos in the capital. Therefore, the rebels are struggling to keep hold of the city as our troops approach from Khovd."
 mon.26.a: "March!"

 mon.27.t: "Siege of Khem-Beldyr"
 mon.27.d: "The troops that were marching to Khem-Beldyr from Khovd have arrived, and the situation for the rebels has improved, if only a little. The rebels in the city have been facing resistance from the Tuvan and Russian population, but they are beginning to consolidate their power. To take advantage of the resistance they're facing before it disappears, some officers are saying our troops should just charge the city and fight alongside the resisting Tuvans and Russians, to swiftly take the city. Other officers, who are more wary and saw the success of a prolonged siege at Khovd, are saying a similar approach should be taken, and if troops surround the city and starve it out, the rebels will be forced to give up."
 mon.27.a: "Charge the city!"
 mon.27.b: "Prepare for a siege to starve them out."

 mon.28.t: "Government Troops Take Khem-Beldyr"
 mon.28.d: "Government troops charged into the city, fighting off an initial wave of rebels and quickly arming the Tuvan resistance fighters. After that, it became a case of going street by street, house by house, clearing out any leftover rebels. Though the city has been retaken, many streets are more rubble than street, and the costs will be high to repair the broken city."
 mon.28.a: "At least it was taken."

 mon.29.t: "Siege of Khem-Beldyr"
 mon.29.d: "After over a week of sieging Khem-Beldyr, the situation has changed. The rebels that currently have the city have been able to crush the resistance from the Tuvan and Russian population there. However, they are just beginning to feel the pain of lacking supplies, after we were able to stop multiple food shipments are reinforcements. Some of our more impatient officers are claiming that it is taking too long, and that now is the time to push into the city. Others are saying that if we keep the siege going a few more weeks, the rebels will give up without a fight."
 mon.29.a: "Charge the city!"
 mon.29.b: "Continue the siege."

 mon.30.t: "Government Troops Take Khem-Beldyr"
 mon.30.d: "Government troops charged into the city, fighting off an initial wave of rebels, who put up surprisingly decent resistance. After that, it became a case of going street by street, house by house, clearing out any leftover rebels. Government troops were spread very thin, and so they rebels were easily able to strike and take out troops. After the day, the city was taken, but much of it had become rubble throughout the day. Costs to repair the city will be high, and the state of the city will no doubt lose us support."
 mon.30.a: "At least it was taken."

 mon.31.t: "Rebels Give Up Khem-Beldyr"
 mon.31.d: "After being trapped in the city of Khem-Beldyr for almost a month by government troops, the rebels who had taken it today left the city without their weapons, conceding the city. Without any reinforcements or supplies, the rebels were unable to feed the city, and many even began to die of disease. Their weapons were broken and they lacked reinforcements, so they'd rather become our prisoners than try to hold the city any longer. Khem-Beldyr has been taken without a fight."
 mon.31.a: "Excellent."

 mon.33.t: "Siege of Uliastai"
 mon.33.d: "Now that we have amassed a large force of troops a couple miles away from Uliastai, it is time to take back the city. The question remains, however, how it is to be done."
 mon.33.a: "Surround the city to starve out the enemy."
 mon.33.b: "Move the division into the city to attack head on."
 mon.33.c: "Send in a diplomat to try to discuss the issue."

 mon.34.t: "Rebels forced out of the city"
 mon.34.d: "What a success! With the city surrounded the bandits were forced to eventually try to escape, an escape that failed due to the strength of our force."
 mon.34.a: "Exactly as planned."

 mon.35.t: "Rebels escape Uliastai, leaving hundreds dead"
 mon.35.d: "With the city surrounded, the bandits were forced to try to escape the city, which they eventually did as they were attacked by our troops. However, the rebels found a weak spot in our lines, and pushed through it, leaving many dead and the rebels having escaped."
 mon.35.a: "At least we have the city back."

 mon.36.t: "Rebels wiped out in Uliastai"
 mon.36.d: "With our force moving head on into Uliastai, we were able to wipe the bandits out of Uliastai. However, in the crossfire, many civilians were killed."
 mon.36.a: "At least we have the city back."

 mon.37.t: "Rebels leave the city, but much of our force was lost"
 mon.37.d: "When we attacked head on into the city, we did not at all expect the resistance we were going to face. A massive battle ensued, with many civilians caught in the crossfire. The city is in ruins, over a thousand dead, but at least the city is ours."
 mon.37.a: "Good enough."

 mon.38.t: "Rebels execute diplomat in Uliastai"
 mon.38.d: "Earlier today, Togtokh Taij, leading the siege of Uliastai, received a package from the rebels in the city. It was expected this was to be a large sum of money with a request to leave them be and let them escape, or perhaps news of the success of our diplomat. Instead, when Togtokh Taij opened the box, all he found was the bloodied head of the diplomat, its dead eyes staring right back at him. Now, it is clear these rebels do not want a peaceful resolution."
 mon.38.a: "Surround the city to starve out the enemy."
 mon.38.b: "Move the division into the city to attack head on."

 mon.42.t: "Buddyn Zövlöl Takes Power"
 mon.42.d: "The Buddyn Zövlöl, a secretive council of Buddhist lamas, have seized power in Urga. Though they now hold de jure control of the nation, their influence outside Urga remains limited, and they will have to act fast if they are to keep their power."
 mon.42.a: "For Buddhism!"

 mon.43.t: "Ungern Retakes Power"
 mon.43.d: "Ungern-Sternberg has retaken power in Urga. Though he now hold de jure control of the nation, his influence outside Urga remains limited, and he will have to act fast if he are to keep his power"
 mon.43.a: "For Ungern!"

 mon.44.t: "Noyodyn Zövlöl Take Power"
 mon.44.d: "The aristocratic Mongol Princes, under the leadership of Prince Demchugdongrub, have seized power in Urga. Though they now hold de jure control of the nation, their influence outside Urga remains limited, and they will have to act fast if they are to keep their power."
 mon.44.a: "For Order!"

 mon.45.t: "Mongol Ardīn Nam Takes Power"
 mon.45.d: "The socialist Mongol Ardīn Nam have seized power in Urga. Though they now hold de jure control of the nation, their influence outside Urga remains limited, and they will have to act fast if they are to keep their power."
 mon.45.a: "For Democracy!"

 mon.49.t: "Ungern loyalists march toward Urga"
 mon.49.d: "After we were able to seize power of the government, Ungern and his loyal troops escaped. Now, after mustering his power in a village nearby, he and his troops are coming back to retake the city. His army, a mix of Mongols, Russians, and Chinese bandits number over a thousand troops. With most of the national army in the west, we only have the power of the civilians and the hastily established revolutionary militia to defend the city."
 mon.49.a: "Call on civilians to resist, and march in the militia."
 mon.49.b: "Call on the citizens to resist these traitors!"
 mon.49.c: "Lay down our arms, no need for a massacre."

 mon.50.t: "Ungern loyalists destroyed"
 mon.50.d: "Finally, after much fighting and many casualties, Ungern has been driven out, and his troops have been repulsed. Urga is ours, for now."
 mon.50.a: "The people of Urga want change!"

 mon.51.t: "Ungern loyalists have captured Urga!"
 mon.51.d: "After little fighting, Ungern and his troops were able to take back the city. Though most of our officials have escaped, we are unlikely to be seen as the real government without power in Urga."
 mon.51.a: "Those men are more Russian than Mongolian."

 mon.52.t: "Re-evaluation of Monastery funding"
 mon.52.d: "With the power now in the people's hands, and with Mongolia modernising every day, one key thing to evaluate is the funding the monasteries receive from the government. The monasteries, though an important aspect of Mongolia, is a very traditional area of the nation, and many lamas even push anti-government propaganda, either harbouring back to Ungerns Mongolia or even supporting the now defunct Buddyn Zövlöl. Some in our government state that funding for the monasteries should be reduced, for they harbour sentiments of authoritarianism and traditionalism. Others in government argue that for now, it might be best to keep the lamas on our side, and to leave the funding where it is, or even increase it."
 mon.52.a: "Keep the Monasteries on our side."
 mon.52.b: "Give the money to the people!"
 mon.52.c: "The lamas may be a good ally, let's give them more funding."

 mon.53.t: "The Popular Prince"
 mon.53.d: "Ünenbayan was elected to government mostly thanks to assistance from the aristocrats. Now, discussions have begun throughout the party as to whether he is the right man to lead. Many people do not know him too well, and mostly see him as a noble bureaucrat, lacking much charisma. A figure of the aristocrats that does have charisma, however, is Prince Demchugdongrub. Following the Western Revolt, the Prince and many of his aristocrats remained in Urga, to try to keep their influence. Demchugdongrub has remained a very popular figure, and many have stated he should rule as prime minister, with Ünenbayan as his deputy. Some, however, may see this as a betrayal of the democratic process."
 mon.53.a: "Invite Demchugdongrub to become Prime Minister."
 mon.53.b: "If he wants to lead, he can do it democratically!"

 mon.54.t: "Review the Budget"
 mon.54.d: "Throughout Ungern's years as dictator of Mongolia, spending increased massively. The country's economy is weak, and changes must be made. Ungern began massive military projects, all of which cost massive amounts. We, the aristocrats, were taxed massively to pay the bill. Of course, aristocrat taxes have already been cut massively, and to offset this we could increase the tax on the poor majority of the nation, the arats. Perhaps, we could even begin a tax policy on the monasteries."
 mon.54.a: "Cut military spending."
 mon.54.b: "Raise Arat tax."
 mon.54.c: "Implement Monastery tax."

 mon.55.t: "Assassination attempt on Ungern-Sternberg!"
 mon.55.d: "While riding his horse in a parade through Urga, a sudden noise deafened the crowds. A shot that echoed through the city, that missed Baron Ungern by two inches. The assassin, a twenty three year old man, was shot almost immediately. Ungern ordered the marching army to fire on the crowd, frenzied by the attempt on his life. The crowd dispersed in a panic as civilians, or possible MAN agents, were killed by Ungerns troops. After the city had calmed down, the assassin has been identified as a member of the Mongol Ardīn Nam, however many peasants in Urga claim this to be fabricated by our government. Though the Baron survived, this attempt showed weakness, and the chaos Ungern caused by killing the possible MAN agents can't be good for our popularity."
 mon.55.a: "At least the Baron survived."

 mon.56.t: "[MON.GetLeader] asks for weapons"
 mon.56.d: "[MON.GetLeader] has asked our government for weapons, to help him defend Mongolia from its enemies. Mongolia is our foothold in China, and it might be best to keep it on our side."
 mon.56.a: "Send them arms."
 mon.56.b: "We are too busy."

 mon.57.t: "Russia agreed to send arms"
 mon.57.d: "Russia have sent us a shipment of guns, and have agreed to do this every year so long as we remain in power."
 mon.57.a: "Excellent."

 mon.58.t: "Russia refused to send arms"
 mon.58.d: "Russia have decided to no longer send us any arms."
 mon.58.a: "Damn."

 mon.59.t: "Diplomatic Mission from Mongolia"
 mon.59.d: "Mongolia, lead by the religious zealot the [MON.GetLeader], has recently sent us a diplomatic mission. Due to both of our nations being major homes for Buddhism, the Mongolian diplomats have stated that they wish to see our nations grow closer, through guarantees and military access. They await our answer."
 mon.59.a: "We Buddhist nations must stick together!"
 mon.59.b: "We are better off alone."

 mon.60.t: "The Western Revolt has finally been crushed"
 mon.60.d: "After many months of fighting in the west of the nation, between bandits, rebels, and government troops, the revolt has been crushed. Most rebels have dispersed, gone into hiding or fled the country, fearing for their lives. Order has come out on top, and the country is secure. However, there are still some small bandit groups, taking advantage of the destruction. They will have to be dealt with."
 mon.60.a: "At last, the nation is safe."

 mon.61.t: "The Offer"
 mon.61.d: "Today, we received a letter from a few of the bandit leaders in the west. In the letter, it said that their groups do not have any stake in what has developed. They came for simple banditry, but it has turned into all out rebellion. The letter goes on to say that although their groups continues to fight in the west, they would be willing to stop, if given some money and supplies. It is a large amount of money, which we will need to find, but it will help reduce the size of the chaos in the west."
 mon.61.a: "Use the nobles' money to pay the bribe."
 mon.61.b: "Sell off some of the monasteries' jewels to pay it."
 mon.61.c: "Raise taxes on the poor to pay the bribe."
 mon.61.e: "Reduce military funding to pay the bribe."
 mon.61.f: "We will not negotiate with these bandits!"

 mon.62.t: "The bandit leader takes the bribe"
 mon.62.d: "The bandit leaders have taken our offer, and have decided to end their operations in the west. In these times of brutal battle, good news like this should be celebrated, but a quiet drink is all [MON.GetLeader] had time for, before having to return to keeping Urga in his hands."
 mon.62.a: "That'll reduce their forces."

 mon.66.t: "Power Struggle in the Ma Clique"
 mon.66.d: "For many years, the Ma Clique has been led by family elder Ma Fuxiang. In the Clique, he was seen as a pillar of stability, who would stop any power struggle occurring between the very divided Ma families. Many in China even see him as the stabiliser of the Northwest, ending Tibetan and our own aggression into Chinese soil.\n\nHowever, news has just reached us that Ma Fuxiang has passed away. Currently he has been replaced by Ma Lin, but another Ma, Ma Bufang, and Ma Lin are already embroiled in a power struggle. This could be a perfect opportunity to take advantage of the Ma Clique's position."
 mon.66.a: "Good to know."

 mon.67.t: "Buyandelger gathers force on the Ulanqab border"
 mon.67.d: "Mongolian general Buyandelger has generally stayed uninvolved with the power struggles happening currently in Urga. For years, he has continued to live in Inner Mongolia, raiding Chinese shipments through the region. Now, we have just received reports that Buyandelger has gathered a large force on the border with the Ma Clique, likely to do some border raids into Ulanqab."
 mon.67.a: "Let the border raids begin."

 mon.68.t: "Mongolian border raids from Suiyuan"
 mon.68.d: "Ever since the death of family patriarch Ma Fuxiang, tensions on both the northern and southern border have been getting worse and worse. Border Raids from Mongolia, primarily in the province of Suiyuan, have caused much chaos over the recent weeks. This is not wholly unexpected, though we should be prepared for if this escalates further."
 mon.68.a: "This is fine."

 mon.69.t: "Buyandelger makes his choice"
 mon.69.d: "With his large force moving through Ulanqab, a thought occurred to Buyandelger. If he was to take Guisui, he would have de facto control of the province. With the Ma's struggling with internal conflict, it should not be too difficult to move his force through the region and to take the city. Now, it is whether he decides to do it or not."
 mon.69.a: "It's too risky."
 mon.69.b: "Buyandelger, do it."

 mon.70.t: "Large Mongolian force moving to Guisui"
 mon.70.d: "Some of our scouts have reported a large force of Mongolian soldiers moving toward the main city of Suiyuan, Guisui. Should the Mongols take it, they will have de facto control of the whole region. Though there is a garrison in Guisui, many fear it will not be enough to beat the quickly approaching Mongols. Ma Hongkui is currently in the region with his force, so he may be able to fight them off."
 mon.70.a: "The garrison will hold."
 mon.70.b: "Send a force under Ma Hongkui."

 mon.71.t: "Mongolian general Buyandelger takes Guisui"
 mon.71.d: "The Mongolian general Buyandelger, who led the large Mongol force through Suiyuan, has been able to defeat any Ma forces in the area and has taken Guisui. There, he declared it now under Mongolian control. However, we can still act. Ma Hongbin is also now in the area, and could move his own forces up to try to retake the city."
 mon.71.a: "We cannot act, leave Suiyuan."
 mon.71.b: "Send a force under Ma Hongbin."

 mon.72.t: "We have taken Ulanqab!"
 mon.72.d: "After Buyandelger began to move toward Guisui to take Ulanqab, he was met with surprisingly little resistance from the Ma Clique. Though he had to fight some small battles with border troops, and had to fight through the Guisui garrison, for now it seems the Ma Clique have retreated from Ulanqab. Finally, Mongolian families have been reunited, and Mongolian rule in the region has been restored."
 mon.72.a: "Good work Buyandelger."

 mon.73.t: "Ma Hongkui loses"
 mon.73.d: "Ma Hongkui's forces travelled for a day and a night to finally reach the Mongolian force. In the early hours of the morning, Ma Hongkui sent in his soldiers to attack the Mongolians, who looked like they were just camping. However, it was a trap! After Hongkui sent his main force in, a group of Mongolian cavalry had snuck behind and attacked on the back lines, at the same time as the battle going on at the front. Ma Hongkui's force was caught in the middle, and beaten. Hongkui was able to make his escape, but he lost the battle, and the Mongol force has almost reached Guisui."
 mon.73.a: "Damn."

 mon.74.t: "Mongol raiders beaten in Suiyuan"
 mon.74.d: "After much fighting between our forces and theirs, in the end, our forces were able to beat the Mongolian force back to the border. For now, Suiyuan remains in our hands."
 mon.74.a: "Excellent."

 mon.75.t: "Buyandelger beaten"
 mon.75.d: "After almost being able to take Guisui from the Ma Clique, Buyandelger and his force have been beaten back to Xilingol. They fought hard, but were unable to beat the better trained and better armed Chinese troops. For now, Ulanqab remains in their hands."
 mon.75.a: "Damn."

 mon.76.t: "Ma Hongbin has lost, Mongolians take Guisui"
 mon.76.d: "Ma Hongbin decided to try to go for a full frontal attack against the Mongolian force with his own force, to avoid being scouted and routed by the Mongols. Therefore he charged directly at the city, but by that point he had already fallen into Buyandelger's trap. From behind hills on both sides of his force emerged groups of Mongol cavalry, who pincered Hongbin's forces, leaving them with 2 options: either retreat and concede the city, or move into the city and try to take it, then deal with the outside cavalry afterwards. In this critical moment, Hongbin decided to push through to try to take the city. However, much of his force had already started to retreat, seeing the city as a death sentence. With that, Ma Hongbin's weakened group were forced to retreat. It seems Suiyuan has now fallen into Mongol hands."
 mon.76.a: "Damn."

 mon.77.t: "Peasant Rebellion in Urga"
 mon.77.d: "In Urga, many peasants, after learning of the sweeping laws implemented to massively increase the power of bosses and nobles, while also destroying their own rights, has decided to take up arms and join the Mongol Ardīn Nam. Battle continues to rage in the streets, and the poorer regions of the city are in MAN control."
 mon.77.a: "Damn."

 mon.80.t: "Ungern's generals escape to Transamur"
 mon.80.d: "Following the overthrow of Roman von Ungern-Sternberg's government in Mongolia, many of his non-Mongolian associates were forced to escape the country. Ungern's generals, Mikhail Tornovsky and Nikolay Kazagrandi, were able to escape the country and travel through Fengtian territory and have arrived at Vladivostok, where they shall now live. They have written a letter to [TRM.GetLeader], offering their services as generals. We already have multiple high class generals, but the skills they gained in Mongolia cannot be ignored."
 mon.80.a: "We welcome them!"
 mon.80.b: "We do not need them."

 mon.100.t: "Ungern has fallen ill!"
 mon.100.d: "Baron Ungern has ruled the nation for many years, and more and more has had to get more involved in its internal affairs. This of course took a toll on the Baron's health over the years. This morning, when his maid came in to serve him breakfast, she dropped the tray in shock, as she saw a frail Ungern laying in his bed, covered in his own bloody vomit. Many monks and lamas were ordered in, bringing many herbs and other tribal remedies. However, it appears the Baron's health is not getting much better."
 mon.100.a: "May he make a swift recovery."

 mon.101.t: "Ungern has died!"
 mon.101.d: "In the early hours of the morning, guards stationed outside Baron Ungern's room suddenly heard a loud thud. As they entered the room, they saw Ungern's body, face down on the ground, collapsed. Upon further inspection, they discovered he wasn't breathing, and quickly rushed to find lamas to try to save him. Alas, it was too late for the Baron. The guards stationed outside his room were executed, for letting him die on their watch, as were many of the lamas who were there to cure him.\n\nWhile investigating the room, a short book was found, written by Ungern, detailing what would happen if he died. It was read to a council of Ungern's inner circle: Boris Rezukhin, Mikhail Tornovsky, Ferdynand Ossendowski, Agvan Dorzhiev, and Vladimir Roerich. Also present was the powerless 9th Jebtsundamba Khutuktu. It stated that Rezukhin was Ungern's successor, and that he must be protected so that he could rule in the Baron's stead. Tornovsky refutes this, stating that he was Ungern's rightful successor, but after Rezukhin pulled a pistol on him, he conceded. The book also stated stability of the realm was paramount, and that though Rezukhin will now rule, Baron Ungern-Sternberg will still be used in all propaganda, and his cult of personality will remain."
 mon.101.a: "May our eternal leader rest in peace."

 #mon.102.t: "General Taij has died"
 #mon.102.d: "In the early evening, we just received news that Togtokh Taij, a nobleman and general who served our nation for many years, passed away. He was an old man, have fought against Chinese rule in Mongolia a decade before the 1911 revolution."
 #mon.102.a: "May he rest in peace."

 mon.103.t: "Chaos in Moscow"
 mon.103.d: "News from Moscow: Alexander Kerensky, former president and current Leader of the Opposition, has been been shot dead in the Senate. During his presidency, we were able to broker many economic and military deals, allowing our extremely weak economy to grow - deals that were maintained by his successor Boris Savinkov out of pragmatism. Although Kerensky did not allow the House of Romanov to rightfully retake the throne, he was still better than the socialists, and he allowed our relationship to grow strong.\n\nHowever, everything has all been brought to question. A political assassination of such a high-ranking politician is likely to throw Russia's unstable politics even further down the drain. With the Russian government having its hands full keeping things under control, it seems we have been forgotten. There are worrying signs that we might lose the Russian support that our nation has become dependent on."
 mon.103.a: "Their assistance is vital."

 mon.104.t: "Economic and military assistance from Russia has been 'temporarily halted'"
 mon.104.d: "What we have feared has come true. We have just received word from the current Russian administration that they have decided to temporarily end their military and economic aid to our nation. Without it, we will only suffer."
 mon.104.a: "A disaster!"

 mon.107.t: "Jamsrangiin Tseveen creates his own party"
 mon.107.d: "Jamsrangiin Tseveen has been a high ranking member of the MAN for many years, after working in universities in Siberia. He even organised and distributed the first newspaper in Mongolia. However, he has always ranked on the more right wing of the party. On multiple occasions he has argued with Davizavyn Losol, and other high ranking MAN members. It is, therefore, no surprise that Tseveen has decided to split from the party, citing the recent leadership struggle as evidence of the party's corruption. His popularity and intelligence cannot be underestimated."
 mon.107.a: "It is a loss for MAN."

 mon.108.t: "Ünenbayan creates his own party"
 mon.108.d: "Ünenbayan, sometimes known by his Chinese name Wu Heling, is a young Inner Mongolian aristocrat, friends with Prince Demchugdongrub. During the Western Revolt he travelled to Urga to aid Demchugdongrub in trying to take power, but encourage a more peaceful and democratic solution. Following the Democratic Revolution, Ünenbayan lobbied to end the discrimination against the nobles and tried to slow the peasants power rise. Now, seeing weakness in the MAN, he has decided to form his own political party, to bring a more conservative and noble democratic Mongolia."
 mon.108.a: "A democracy must have its parties."

 mon.110.t: "Concern about upcoming elections"
 mon.110.d: "Since completing the Constitution and fully transforming into a democratic nation, there has been one small stickler: elections. Though most people agree that elections should take place to fully become a democratic nation, some major figures in the party have spoken of how elections threaten our rule. With the creation of the KAN, people fear allowing elections will pull us back to a nation dominated by the aristocracy. Perhaps it might be best to, for now, postpone the elections so that something may be decided."
 mon.110.a: "Elections will go ahead as planned."
 mon.110.b: "Maybe we can postpone them for now."

 #mon.111.t: "Tseveen demands information about elections"
 #mon.111.d: "Jamsrangiin Tseveen, writing in his newspaper, the Niislel Khüreenii Sonin Bichig, this morning said this:\n\nWe, the people of Mongolia, demand information. For too long we have lived under a tyrant who refused to allow the democratic process. After the democratic revolution, we finally had the chance to express our views. However, the government is silent. The MAN have had power for a long time, and yet where are the elections? Therefore, we demand information about when the people will have the chance to express their views via the democratic process, as we deserve.''\n\nAlthough many people in Mongolia are not literate, words like this will spread through the intelligentsia, where we garner much of our support. Perhaps he is right, that elections should be planned soon."
 #mon.111.a: "Elections will go ahead."
 #mon.111.b: "Tseveen is a threat to Mongolia!"

 mon.112.t: "Tseveen and Ünenbayan criticise the government"
 mon.112.d: "Due to our decision to postpone the elections, both Jamsrangiin Tseveen, leader of the MLN, and Ünenbayan, leader of the KAN, have come out in direct opposition to us. Both of the men held speeches in different areas in Urga, generally speaking about the same things: the lack of elections when they had been planned, and no issued date as to when the postponing of the elections will end. Both of them even compared us to the dictator Ungern-Sternberg! Ironic, seeing as the Ünenbayan's aristocratic friends were the ones helping keep the Baron's government alive. However, their reaction to this is unsurprising. What is surprising is the reaction of the people. It appears, though we were the most likely to win the election, it appears the people still wanted to be able to make the choice. For now, though, no dangerous resistance has begun, but we must stay vigilant."
 mon.112.a: "Who cares what these traitors have to say."

 #mon.117.t: "Should the KAN be allowed to run?"
 #mon.117.d: "With elections fast approaching, some in the party have suggested that Ünenbayan's KAN should not be allowed to run, due to the support it gets from Demchugdongrub's noble clique. Given that we currently have the power, perhaps it would be best if such a traitorous party were not allowed to run."
 #mon.117.a: "Allow them to run."
 mon.117.b: "Ban them."

 mon.118.t: "[GetYear] Election"
 mon.118.d: "Finally it is time for the first election in Mongolia. Turnout was high in all the major cities, as people flocked to vote for the first time. The question of who has won has yet to be answered."
 mon.118.a: "MAN victory."
 mon.118.b: "MLN victory."
 mon.118.c: "KAN victory."

 mon.119.t: "[GetYear] Election"
 mon.119.d: "It is once more time for elections in Mongolia. Turnout was high in all the major cities, as people flocked to vote and keep Mongolian democracy alive. The question of who has won has yet to be answered."
 mon.119.a: "MAN victory."
 mon.119.b: "MLN victory."
 mon.119.c: "KAN victory."

 mon.121.t: "Elections scheduled"
 mon.121.d: "Following the creation of our great Constitution, elections are the next key step in proving our legitimacy. Therefore, [MON.GetLeader] has announced that elections have been scheduled in 90 days time, and already the parties have began campaigning. Due to the massive size of the nation compared to the population, the only area where turnout will be high is some of the main cities and Urga itself. Jamsrangiin Tseveen, leader of the MLN, has declared he will do a tour around the Urga area, meeting with the poor and suffering. In contrast, Ünenbayan is instead holding meetings with many major nobles and aristocrats, as he is their main candidate."
 mon.121.a: "Democracy in action."

 mon.122.t: "Davizavyn Losol makes a speech in Urga"
 mon.122.d: "\"People of Mongolia. Finally, we are free! The dictatorship of the Russian dog Ungern-Sternberg has come to an end, and his death squads have been driven from the nation. No longer shall we live under a dictator, no longer shall we live under foreign control, no longer shall we be slaves!\"\n\nDavizavyn Losol's speech, held outside the State Great Khural in Urga, went on for almost an hour, talking in detail about the serious reforms the new government was going to make; he promised the redistribution of wealth, a real constitution, and democratic elections. Even though the speech went on for so long the audience was captivated all the way. Nearly every other sentence of Losol was met with cheers and thunderous applause from the crowd."
 mon.122.a: "Glory to Mongolia!"

 mon.123.t: "Teachings from the 7th Changkya Khutukhtu"
 mon.123.d: "\"For many months now, the ones who have struggled the most are the people. With bandits and rebels running rife throughout the nation, the people need security. The previous government, led by the butcher Ungern-Sternberg, focused too much on control through terror, when that is not what the people need. The beliefs of Buddhism, something that Ungern claimed to follow, were noticeably absent in the previous government. The 1930 purge is evidence that Ungern's Buddhist claims were little more than lies and deceptions. The Jebtsundamba Khutukhtu lived as little more than a prisoner, not receiving the proper training. Now that order has been restored here, things will change.\"\n\nThis speech, made outside the Gandantegchinlen Monastery, the new centre of the government, was met with great applause from the hundreds of onlookers."
 mon.123.a: "Glory to Mongolia!"

 mon.131.t: "Amar Questions Losol's Loyalty"
 mon.131.d: "In a speech in the recently empowered State Great Khural, Anandyn Amar, member of the MAN, held a speech questioning the current leadership. In this speech, he claimed that Davizavyn Losol has lead the MAN through nepotism, and that Davizavyn Losol is nothing more than a spy for the Japanese. Though these comments were very controversial, due to Amar's support in the party, we will have to let this slide for now."
 mon.131.a: "He is a poor judge of character."

 mon.132.t: "Radical ideas in the party"
 mon.132.d: "With our power recently elevated to the nation stage, the party has begun to split in terms of policy. In the past, the party's only goal had been gaining power. Now, the ideological divides of the party are beginning to show. The party is generally split between the more moderate members, lead by Davizavyn Losol, and the more radical members, lead by Bat-Ochiryn Eldev-Ochir and Ölziin Badrakh. Anandyn Amar commands his own clique in the party, made up of less radical leftists and the stronger Mongol nationalists. Though this group of radicals is still a minor force in the party, it destabilises our leadership in a time when we sorely need stability. They also have made it clear that they are willing to give their support to Anandyn Amar, if he should need it against Losol."
 mon.132.a: "Party debate is what democracy is about."

 mon.133.t: "Chagdarjav Begins Investigating Losol"
 mon.133.d: "Dambyn Chagdarjav was one of the men who founded the Mongol Ardīn Nam, with Davizavyn Losol and others. Though Chagdarjav and Losol have been colleagues for many years now, it did not stop the two from battling for power for control of the party, a battle Losol won. Chagdarjav was almost purged from the party, along with his co-conspirator Dogsomyn Bodoo, however, Losol decided to pardon the men, due to the extremely weak position the MAN were in after another failed revolution.\n\nHowever, it appears Chagdarjav is back to his old tricks. Today, he announced to the party that he was going to begin an investigation of Losol into any \"ties to foreign enemies\". Of course, this investigation will surely amount to nothing."
 mon.133.a: "There is nothing to find."

 mon.134.t: "Elbegdorj Argues with Losol"
 mon.134.d: "Rinchingiin Elbegdorj, a leader of the left wing of the party and friend of Anandyn Amar, recently got into an argument with Prime Minister Losol about socialism. Elbegdorj, in front of many other party members, openly stated that the transition to socialism was taking far too long under Losol, and that perhaps Losol is not entirely loyal to the Mongolian State. Losol, of course, argued back that the transition was happening as fast as was possible, and that the left wing policies of Elbegdorj were dangerous for the party. This seemed to stir much anger against Losol, with multiple other leftist party members joined in at arguing with Losol. It seems party unity is worse than imagined."
 mon.134.a: "Other opinions can be good."

 mon.135.t: "Anandyn Amar Discusses Investigation"
 mon.135.d: "Recently, thanks to one of our spies in Amar's clique, we discovered a meeting between Amar and Dambyn Chagdarjav, who is still currently investigating Losol over his foreign ties. Apparently, the meeting lasted for multiple hours, with Amar himself stating it was \"very productive\"."
 mon.135.a: "Just politicians politicking, I'm sure."

 mon.136.t: "Russian Businessman Approaches Losol"
 mon.136.d: "A Russian businessman, who recently travelled here on the Trans-Siberian Railway all the way from Moscow, has recently made contact with our government, stating his interest in opening a factory in Urga. With the large sum of money he brought with him, construction could start immediately. However, due to the nature of the request, it would have to go through the bureaucracy of Urga, through the many committees and groups created to regulate business like this, and the foreign affairs committee. The businessman has stated that he does not wish to wait possibly months for construction to start, so he has offered us a large bribe if we are able to sidestep these committees and begin construction immediately."
 mon.136.a: "The project will go ahead."
 mon.136.b: "It is illegal, and therefore it shall not happen."

 mon.137.t: "Chagdarjav comes out with evidence of Losol bypassing laws for Russian companies"
 mon.137.d: "Dambyn Chagdarjav has today concluded his investigation on Davizavyn Losol, finding that he in fact did have dangerous links to foreign business. In his report, he states that he recently discovered a deal between Losol and a Russian businessman, where Losol took a bribe to allow the immediate construction of a new factory in Urga, bypassing the rest of the government to fill his own coffers. His report was also filled with much evidence, showing that perhaps that Russian businessman was in fact working for Chagdarjav against Losol! Davizavyn Losol has made no response to the claims as of yet. The next meeting of the State Great Khural, scheduled for tomorrow, will definitely be an eventful one."
 mon.137.a: "It seems power is shifting..."

 mon.138.t: "Anandyn Amar and Elbegdorj coup Losol"
 mon.138.d: "In the Great State Khural today, Anandyn Amar, flanked either side by Rinchingiin Elbegdorj and Dambyn Chagdarjav, made a speech damning Davizavyn Losol, citing the report Chagdarjav released just yesterday. As his speech went on, members of the Great State Khural began to yell and shout about \"Losol the Traitor\" and \"Losol the Russian\". After many minutes of this, Losol attempted to leave, but upon standing was met by two armed guards, who seized Davizavyn Losol and put him in handcuffs. From there, Losol was taken into a private police room for \"questioning\". In the State Great Khural, with his coup a success, Anandyn Amar announced that a vote will be held to decide who in the party should become the next prime minister. No one other than Amar stood for the role, and so he won a unanimous victory."
 mon.138.a: "We must remain vigilant of future corruption."

 mon.139.t: "Chagdarjav Releases Evidence of Losol Corruption"
 mon.139.d: "Dambyn Chagdarjav has today concluded his investigation on Davizavyn Losol, finding that he in fact did have dangerous links to foreign business. In his report, he claims that he recently discovered a deal between Losol and a Russian businessman, where Losol took a bribe to allow the immediate construction of a new factory in Urga, bypassing the rest of the government to fill his own coffers. However, there is a serious lack of evidence in the report, with some party members suspicious whether this is all faked or not. Losol has come out against these claims, stating that though he was contacted by a Russian businessman recently, he declined the bribe and sent the man away. It has become obvious what this is: a grab for power against Losol. Though we can have Chagdarjav arrested for his fake claims, it will show us as dictators. What may be best is if we get Dansranbilegiin Dogsom, currently a neutral member of the MAN, to investigate these claims himself, to show that we are a just society."
 mon.139.a: "Dogsom can investigate these claims."
 mon.139.b: "These need no investigating, arrest Chagdarjav."

 mon.140.t: "Amar Meets with Dogsom"
 mon.140.d: "Just today, we have received information from one of our informants that Anandyn Amar had a secret meeting with Dansranbilegiin Dogsom. Though we do not know exactly what the meeting was about, it is clear this cannot be good. The next meeting of the State Great Khural, scheduled for tomorrow, is bound to be an eventful one."
 mon.140.a: "Dogsom may not be as helpful as first hoped..."

 mon.141.t: "Amar and Elbegdorj Flee the Capital"
 mon.141.d: "Following the successful arrest of Dambyn Chagdarjav, following his fake claims against Davizavyn Losol, Anandyn Amar and Rinchingiin Elbegdorj were seen this morning fleeing the capital, fearing their own arrest. From some of our reports, they plan to lay low for a few weeks in a small village nearby, while the heat around them dies down. With this, it seems Losol's power is secure."
 mon.141.a: "The leadership is safe."

 mon.142.t: "Ünenbayan approaches nobles for support"
 mon.142.d: "Reports have just come in that Ünenbayan has recently held a large meeting with many of the major aristocrats in the nation, including the likes of the traitor Prince Demchugdongrub. Though a warrant is still out for the princes arrest, he is still able to exert his influence through Ünenbayan."
 mon.142.a: "Traitors discussing with traitors."

 mon.143.t: "Government buildings in Urga bombed in the night"
 mon.143.d: "In the middle of the night, multiple explosions were heard going off in the centre of Urga. Multiple buildings, including police stations and minor government offices, were damaged by bombs, set off by terrorists. Though no one died, multiple people were injured. These terrorists were sadly able to escape, hiding in the slums of Urga. Though opposition to our rule had begun to grow due to our recent postponing of the elections, nothing on this scale was expected. This was obviously an attack planned by one of the opposing party's, to try to pressure us to pursue elections. Perhaps they are right; before any more people are hurt, we could end the danger right now by planning elections. This may be our last chance to push for elections to safely. However, perhaps it is better to serve justice and discredit our opponents, and claim one of them planned it."
 mon.143.a: "Publicly blame Ünenbayan and the KAN."
 mon.143.b: "Publicly blame Tseveen and the MLN."
 mon.143.c: "End the violence, set up elections."

 mon.144.t: "Ünenbayan releases statement against claim"
 mon.144.d: "In a statement released by Ünenbayan today, he states:\n\n\"The current government has proven they are unable to keep the peace and perform their democratic duty. In blaming me for the attacks, they have shown their true colours: dangerous, and willing to exploit human loss for political gain. I can confirm that I was in no way involved in the planning of this attack, and I pray for the swift recovery for anyone injured in the attack. Not only was I not involved in this, I declare now that this act of terror was committed by the government itself, to try to give legitimacy to their cancellation of elections. We must make sure the government who committed this crime pay for their actions.\""
 mon.144.a: "We stand by it."

 mon.145.t: "Tseveen publicly supports Ünenbayan"
 mon.145.d: "In a statement by Jamsrangiin Tseveen, written in his Niislel Khüreenii sonin bichig newspaper, he has stated that he fully supports Ünenbayan's claims against our government, and says he is willing to fight side by side with Ünenbayan to make sure we are brought to justice."
 mon.145.a: "Their support grows."

 mon.146.t: "Violent riot put down in Urga"
 mon.146.d: "With tensions growing in Urga over the past few weeks, they were bound to spill over, as they have today. Following the shooting of a man in Urga earlier today after he tried to fight a police officer, many people began talking of how the police were violently cracking down on dissent due to recent political problems. Though we never gave the police such orders, the rumours spread fast, and soon, riots had begun in the centre of Urga. Thousands of people took to the streets and began looting pro-government shops and buildings, while violently attacking any police officer or soldier who opposed them. Toward the end of the day, with the riot having no sign of stopping, a cavalry battalion was called into the city, to put down the riot by any means necessary. Though the use of batons and rifles, the riot eventually dispersed. However, a death count has now been completed, showing that 39 people were killed in the riots, with another 62 seriously injured."
 mon.146.a: "This could be bad for publicly."

 mon.147.t: "Ünenbayan and Tseveen unite forces"
 mon.147.d: "Ünenbayan and Tseveen, speaking in Urga together today, both made a speech about temporarily uniting their party's, for the purpose of removing our government from power. They stated that the current government is dangerous, and rules through military force, and are traitors to the Democratic Revolution. Their calls for unity against the government were met with thunderous applause.\n\nOf course, we cannot let this stand. Really, we have two options. One, suggested by radical Bat-Ochiryn Eldev-Ochir, is that we poison Ünenbayan using one of our spies who is close to him. Another plan, as suggested by the more moderate Tseren-Ochiryn Dambadorj, is to spread dissent between the two parties, in an attempt to split their hastily formed union."
 mon.147.a: "Have the spy attempt to poison Ünenbayan."
 mon.147.b: "Spread dissent between the two."

 mon.148.t: "Party union between Ünenbayan and Tseveen split"
 mon.148.d: "Earlier today, Ünenbayan released a statement denouncing Tseveen and the MLN, and stating that the union of the two parties is at an end. This is because of some recently discovered evidence that apparently, Tseveen was working against the union, and was planning on betraying Ünenbayan. Tseveen has come out against these claims, but it appears the union between the two parties is over."
 mon.148.a: "Divide and conquer."

 mon.149.t: "Assassination attempt on Ünenbayan failed"
 mon.149.d: "Earlier today, reports came in that our assassination attempt on Ünenbayan had failed. Apparently, while our spy attempted to plant the poison in Ünenbayan's food during his dinner, he was caught in the act, and was shot by a guard when he reached for his own pistol. Ünenbayan released a statement announcing the attempt on his life, and has once again denounced our government, for our \"evil, authoritarian tactics\"."
 mon.149.a: "Damn!"

 mon.150.t: "Ünenbayan getting funding from Demchugdongrub"
 mon.150.d: "We have now discovered that Ünenbayan has been receiving aid from many of his noble friends. This is of no surprise, for they are his main support base. However, recently it has been uncovered that Demchugdongrub is personally supplying Ünenbayan with rifles, pistols, and even some artillery pieces, to fight against our government. Should we make the wrong move, we may face another revolution.\n\nTo try to gain back support from the people of Urga, Bat-Ochiryn Eldev-Ochir has approached us, stating that we should use the fact that they are both from Inner Mongolia against them, and claim it is a Chinese plot."
 mon.150.a: "Damn."
 mon.150.b: "Claim its a Chinese plot to take over."

 mon.151.t: "Ünenbayan starts violent rebellion in Urga"
 mon.151.d: "Disaster! During a regular patrol through the city, as the sun was just rising, a band of soldiers were ambushed by a group of pro-democracy rebels. The soldiers were caught off guard, and were massacred. This triggered the beginning of a rebellion in Urga, led by Ünenbayan. His rebels are well armed, thanks to funding he secured through the nobles. No doubt this is merely a plot for the nobles to try to take power once again. However, we must act fast, to put down the rebellion, or risk losing our power. However, putting it down would be disastrous for human life."
 mon.151.a: "Send in the troops."
 mon.151.b: "Put down our arms, let the violence end."

 mon.152.t: "[MON.GetLeader]'s power is secure"
 mon.152.d: "For multiple hours, Urga was under the control of Ünenbayan's rebel forces. However, that changed when General Manlaibaatar Damdinsüren marched in with a large force, from the surrounding barracks'. After surrounding the city, Damdinsüren's troops moved in and went street to street, clearing out the remaining rebels.\n\nBy evening it was all over. The streets of Urga were stained crimson, with the blood of hundreds of rebels and civilians alike. However, though sadness reigned over most of the city, the State Great Khural was very different. There, [MON.GetLeader] held a speech to only MAN members, declaring their victory against the rebels and a start to true Mongolian Socialism. The whole hall erupted in applause."
 mon.152.a: "Power is Secure."

 mon.153.t: "Ünenbayan takes power"
 mon.153.d: "With the last surrender of our troops, Ünenbayan marched into the State Great Khural, and declared the fighting as over. As many in the MAN government were arrested, including [MON.GetLeader], Ünenbayan made a speech, claiming this was once again a new beginning for Mongolia, a democratic one. For now, he and the MLN have made a power sharing deal, until elections can be held soon."
 mon.153.a: "Great."

 mon.154.t: "Tseveen holds speech about Ünenbayan's nationality"
 mon.154.d: "\"Earlier today, the phony government who currently hide in the State Great Khural made a statement about the nationality of our fellow democrat Ünenbayan. Though me and him disagree about many things, that does not change a simple fact: that we are both Mongolian. Ünenbayan is as much Mongolian as I as is you. This government wishes to try to divide Mongolians in a weak attempt to weaken our resolve. However, we will not let this stand. It is time for us to march!\"This speech, held in the outskirts of Urga to a massive crowd, received much applause and cheers from the people watching. Immediately after this, the large group of people began to march into the city..."
 mon.154.a: "This won't be good..."

 mon.155.t: "Peaceful march in Urga"
 mon.155.d: "The streets of Urga today are packed with thousands of civilians, protesting against the actions of the current government. Lead by both Ünenbayan and Tseveen, they call for the resignation of the current government, and for them to be temporarily put in power until elections can be organised."
 mon.155.a: "Put this down with bullets."
 mon.155.b: "Lay down our arms."

 mon.156.t: "Violent suppression leads to mass unrest"
 mon.156.d: "As government troops marched through the streets, gunning down anyone who showed resistance, it seems this had the opposite of the desired effect. As one man is shot, three men decide to join the rebellion against us. Ünenbayan, using weapons he bought thanks to the nobles, has armed the rebels with guns, and they have began marching toward the State Great Khural now..."
 mon.156.a: "This won't be good."

 mon.157.t: "Tseveen releases statement against claim"
 mon.157.d: "In a statement released by Ünenbayan today, he states:\n\n\"The current government has proven they are unable to keep the peace and perform their democratic duty. In blaming me for the attacks, they have shown their true colours: dangerous, and willing to exploit human loss for political gain. I can confirm that I was in no way involved in the planning of this attack, and I pray for the swift recovery for anyone injured in the attack. Not only was I not involved in this, I declare now that this act of terror was committed by the government itself, to try to give legitimacy to their cancellation of elections. We must make sure the government who committed this crime pay for their actions.\""
 mon.157.a: "We stand by it."

 mon.158.t: "Ünenbayan states Tseveen is just as bad as [MON.GetLeader]"
 mon.158.d: "Rather controversially, Ünenbayan, leader of the KAN and one of our main opponents, publicly released a statement about Tseveen's denial of the events prior:\n\n\"I fear today that I must partially agree with the government's statement about the bombings, that it was in fact Tseveen and his MLN who organised it. The acts of violence caused by the MLN are level with the pains the current MAN government have caused to all Mongolians. Both the MLN under Tseveen and the MAN under [MON.GetLeader] are evil groups, who seek to destroy any order and peace the nation has, and replace them with bloody syndicalist revolution.\"\n\nIronically, this statement has proven very unpopular, with government supporters claiming that Ünenbayan only works for himself, and MLN supporters claiming Ünenbayan has betrayed them. It seems Ünenbayan's nobles will not be a problem in the coming future."
 mon.158.a: "Divide and conquer."

 mon.159.t: "Tseveen declares the government dead"
 mon.159.d: "In a speech today just on the outskirts of Urga to a large crowd of people, Tseveen declared:\n\n\"The current government is dead! They no longer have any mandate to rule, and have cast off democracy and justice in favour of nepotism and corruption. We Mongolians know revolution well; we fought against Chinese rule in 1911, and against Ungern-Sternberg in 1936. Therefore, I declare now the start of a new Revolution: The Liberal Revolution!\"\n\nMany cheers were heard from the crowd, and word of this new revolution spread around Urga quickly."
 mon.159.a: "Worrying."

 mon.160.t: "Arsenal raided by rebels"
 mon.160.d: "Early in the morning, a weapons arsenal was raided by revolutionaries. There is evidence that the men guarding the arsenal actively supported the rebels, allowing them to take the weapons without resistance. It seems now we will have to deal with the growth of militant violence."
 mon.160.a: "Damn."

 mon.161.t: "Tseveen travels out of Urga to gather support in nearby areas"
 mon.161.d: "Tseveen has recently made public that he intends to travel out to nearby villages and nomadic groups near Urga, to try and gain their support for the revolution. While doing this, he has only taken a small force of men with him, and has left the rest of his supporters in Urga. We must act on this, and this leaves us with a choice. Either we can try to root out the rebels in the city while Tseveen in away, or we can send out a group of men to attack Tseveen while his supporters remain in Urga. Without their leader, they will surely fail."
 mon.161.a: "Send out troops to attack Tseveen."
 mon.161.b: "Root out rebels in the city."

 mon.162.t: "The Attack on Tseveen"
 mon.162.d: "In the early evening of last night, Tseveen's group set up camp outside a small village a few miles outside Urga. His party was only 25 men strong, and when they were met with a group of 200 government troops, they were extremely unprepared. While most of Tseveen's men were sleeping, out troops took positions and fired as one, killing most of his men almost immediately. The rest, including Tseveen, surrendered before they were gunned down too. The men were arrested and brought back to Urga, where they will live in a prison cell for the rest of their lives."
 mon.162.a: "Perfect."

 mon.163.t: "Large riots spark in Urga after innocents get investigated"
 mon.163.d: "After giving the order for investigations, a large group of soldiers numbering around 200 were tasked with going through every person in Urga to root out the rebels. However, it seems this move was not exactly popular with the population. The soldiers did small investigations on many people in Urga, and if they deemed them to be rebels, either arrested them or lined them up and shot them without trial. After doing this through part of Urga, the people in the city began to resist them. Civilians began to throw rocks at the soldiers, and were met with bullets. This quickly led to massive riots throughout Urga, primarily lead by armed MLN insurgents."
 mon.163.a: "End the riot with bullets."
 mon.163.b: "Open talks with Tseveen and his rebels."

 mon.164.t: "Massacre in Urga"
 mon.164.d: "After organising the troops and gathering more, the battalion, now 500 soldiers strong, marched into Urga and declared that any resistance was to be met with bullets. Starting in upper Urga, the battalion battled hard with rioting civilians and MLN insurgents alike, and both sides took substantial losses. It wasn't until the battalion began to move that things turned for the worst. While travelling through the middle of Urga, the battalion were very quickly surrounded by armed MLN insurgents, who opened fire on the troops. Whenever a rebel was killed, another came in to take his place. Casualties for the rebels were very high, however, they had won the day. All the soldiers in the battalion were lost, and so the group, lead by the now returned Tseveen, moved in to take the State Great Khural."
 mon.164.a: "The rebellion has succeeded."

 mon.165.t: "Tseveen takes over the government"
 mon.165.d: "After fighting off the remaining guards of the State Great Khural, Tseveen took his place as Prime Minister. [MON.GetLeader] was arrested, along with multiple other major MAN players. While there, Tseveen declared that it was time for the people of Mongolia to experience true democracy, and that an election was already being scheduled."
 mon.165.a: "Freedom wins in Mongolia."

 mon.166.t: "Tseveen demands elections and arrests of many MAN members"
 mon.166.d: "After releasing a statement that we would be prepared for talks with the MLN rebels, Tseveen has released a new statement:\n\n\"We decline your offer for talks with us. It is not talks we need. Talks would lead to small concessions which allow you to subvert the democratic process. Instead, we have made a list of demands. If these demands are followed, then the revolution will end.\n\n1. Elections must be scheduled as soon as possible.\n\n2. The arrests of the perpetrators who lead to this situation, primarily [MON.GetLeader].\n\n3. The freedom for any rebels who have been arrested during the past few weeks.\n\n4. Justice served to those soldiers who carelessly killed innocent civilians.\n\n5. The acknowledgement by the MAN that this revolution was caused by their undemocratic actions.\""
 mon.166.a: "We can never agree to this."
 mon.166.b: "Elections are fine, but defend the MAN members."
 mon.166.c: "Agree entirely, elections will be scheduled for a months time."

 mon.167.t: "Tseveen raises his forces"
 mon.167.d: "Across Urga today, hundreds of armed MLN rebels have risen against us, after hearing of our refusal of their demands. The group organised and quickly defeated the garrison that was present in the city, with some of the soldiers even joining their side. Now, the rebels begin their march to the State Great Khural."
 mon.167.a: "This doesn't look good."

 mon.168.t: "Tseveen states MAN arrests are key to uphold democracy"
 mon.168.d: "Tseveen has released a response to our answer that elections can occur so long as MAN members like [MON.GetLeader] are not arrested. His response was that the arrests of these men is necessary to allow democracy to function, and to protect it for the future. The rebels demands remain unchanged."
 mon.168.a: "Then we refuse."
 mon.168.b: "We have to agree to this."

 mon.169.t: "Our Russia policy"
 mon.169.d: "For many years now we have aligned close to Russia. As time has passed and unrest with the current rule has slowly risen, culminating in the rebellion, it has come into question whether we should continue to follow the Russians. However, aligning against them would call into question why we, as Russians, are even leading in Mongolia."
 mon.169.a: "Russia is our patron, and shall remain so."
 mon.169.b: "We must go our own way."

 mon.170.t: "The Constitution of [GetYear]"
 mon.170.d: "After finally securing control of Mongolia, [MON.GetLeader] made a speech outside the State Great Khural, promising many things, including the redistribution of wealth, a new constitution, and democratic elections. In the following months since, the government has worked hard to set right the injustices caused by the previous government. The peasants now finally feel like they truly have power, and do not work as slaves.\n\nOver the past few weeks, the government has been working on the second promise. Over the period of multiple weeks, full of long meetings and heated arguments, the new constitution has been drafted. This constitution sets out the government form, with the Jebtsundamba Khutukhtu as the figurehead leader of the nation once he comes of age, with much power in the hands of the working class, through voting for the Prime Minister and his government. It also includes points about human and workers rights, and ensures universal suffrage.\n\nWith celebrations of the new constitution echoing through Urga, we must now focus on the last of [MON.GetLeader]'s promises: elections."
 mon.170.a: "Elections?"

 mon.171.t: "Ungern's Purge"
 mon.171.d: "In the past few months, it has become clear to the Baron that his rule is constantly in danger. Therefore, he has declared it time to examine our current military staff, and decide whether they are loyal to Ungern, or whether it is time they saw a bullet."
 mon.171.a: "We must root out the traitors!"

 mon.172.t: "Status of Manlaibaatar Damdinsüren"
 mon.172.d: "Manlaibaatar Damdinsüren has fought on the side of Mongolia for decades, taking part in Mongolian independence back in 1911. Though he opened dialogue with the MAN rebels at the time, he was arrested by the Chinese, and almost died in his cell. He would have died had it not been for Ungern's Asiatic Cavalry Division taking Urga from Chinese control and freeing him. Many Mongolians see the old man as a unifying figure; a sign that Mongolians are still able to lead in this Russian-dominated government. However, perhaps his links to the MAN never went away. Though we have failed to find any evidence of this, perhaps he aided the MAN rebels against us, and almost led to our downfall. He constantly makes it clear that he doesn't serve us, rather serving Mongolia directly. Maybe it is time for the old General to meet his end."
 mon.172.a: "He is trustworthy."
 mon.172.b: "End him."

 mon.173.t: "Status of Nikolay Kazagrandi"
 mon.173.d: "Nikolay Kazagrandi has been working under Ungern-Sternberg after he left Siberia during the Russian Civil War. Ungern almost had him purged back then, but his high skill during the 1921 MAN Revolution made Ungern let him stay. After that, he travelled to the west of the nation, to put down rebellion and to train anti-Chinese forces in the province of Dzungaria. It is clear that in this mission he failed. At the start of the Western Revolt, he was in Dzungaria, rather than doing his job of putting down anti-government activity. Ungerns mistrust of him was obviously justified. However, will his skill save him from being purged this time?"
 mon.173.a: "He is trustworthy."
 mon.173.b: "End him."

 mon.174.t: "Status of Khatanbaatar Magsarjav"
 mon.174.d: "Khatanbaatar Magsarjav's situation is similar to that of Manlaibaatar Damdinsüren. The old man formed an anti-Chinese guerrilla group in Inner Mongolia in 1907, for which he became a Mongolian hero. He was promoted to the rank of general by the Bogd Khan himself, after he came to Urga following the revolution against the Chinese. In expelling Chinese troops, he worked with bandit leader Ja Lama multiple times. This is where the worry about Khatanbaatar Magsarjav lies. It was Ja Lamas Yum-Beise bandits who sparked the start of the Western Revolt just months ago. Perhaps Khatanbaatar Magsarjav organised the bandits into rebelling, so that he could gain power for himself."
 mon.174.a: "He is trustworthy."
 mon.174.b: "End him."

 mon.175.t: "Status of the Officers"
 mon.175.d: "The officer class have proven their disloyalty over the past few months. With many officers deciding to align themselves with the opposing rebel groups, it is clear many of their loyalties do not sit with us. Perhaps it is time for the officer class to be cleansed of anyone who dared declare themselves for an opposing faction."
 mon.175.a: "They are fine."
 mon.175.b: "They must be cleansed."

 mon.176.t: "Status of Altanochir"
 mon.176.d: "Altanochir is a prince from Inner Mongolia, who only very recently travelled to Urga from Inner Mongolia, after recommendation from Prince Demchugdongrub. It should already be clear as to why he is on the chopping block. Demchugdongrub pushed to gain power during the chaos of the Western Revolt. It was his clique of princes and nobles who almost led to our downfall. Altanochir, still being quite a low level military leader, should be an obvious one to be purged."
 mon.176.a: "He is trustworthy."
 mon.176.b: "End him."

 mon.177.t: "The Purge has Ended"
 mon.177.d_small: "With that, it has been decided that the purge has come to an end. Whether it can even be called a purge is up for debate, due to the relatively minor amount of actions that were taken against possible traitors. The military leaders of Mongolia who survived breathe a sigh of relief, though some may still scheme against us."
 mon.177.d_medium: "With that, it has been decided that the purge has come to an end. Many high up military figures were executed throughout the last few weeks, all in the name of safety and justice for traitors. Those remaining breathe a sigh of relief, as the military staff of the nation grows ever smaller."
 mon.177.d_big: "With that, it has been decided that the purge has come to an end. Many high up military figures were executed throughout the last few weeks, all in the name of safety and justice for traitors. Those remaining breathe a sigh of relief, as the military staff of the nation grows ever smaller."
 mon.177.a: "It was necessary."

 mon.178.t: "37 People Die in Factory Explosion"
 mon.178.d: "Following Ungern's new policy of Aggressive Industrialisation, construction of new factories, sponsored mostly by Russian businessmen, sprung up across the nation. With this new mass industrialisation along with the complete lack of labour rights, all of the workers constructing these factories are in clear danger. A common cause of death nowadays is death while constructing a new factory. The best example of this occurred today, when 37 people were killed in an explosion during the construction of a factory outside Mörön. The factory is to become a textile factory, owned personally by Boris Rezukhin, Ungern's right hand man. Due to the lack of any safety regulations whatsoever, a poorly build bit of construction machinery failed, causing a fire which led to the explosion. Rezukhin commented that it was the fault of the workers doing poor work, a statement Ungern agreed with."
 mon.178.a: "They should be more careful next time."

 mon.179.t: "Mongol Ardīn Nam Cell Destroyed near the Russian Border"
 mon.179.d: "After receiving information from one of our informants placed in the MAN, we learned the location of a major MAN cell, just on the Russo-Mongolian border. So, under the command of Boris Rezukhin, a battalion was sent out from Urga up north to the location. After travelling and searching for a few days, they eventually found it. A large complex of gers of all sizes, surrounded by a quickly put up wooden fence. Patrols of men armed with rifles and wearing MAN symbols on their caps travelled around the complex every few minutes. It is clear that the camp is struggling to keep together, following the failure of their now third revolution. After surrounding the camp, Rezukhin moved his troops in, and took the complex. There was a small firefight, but nothing major; it seems most of their actual fighting soldiers died during the revolution. Rezukhin rounded up everyone else that was left, primarily older men or women, and either shot them there or took them in for questioning. After going through all the papers in the gers, the locations of multiple, smaller MAN cells were discovered, as well as some of their future plans which included a plan to assassinate Ungern-Sternberg. After getting all the decent information out of the area, Rezukhin burned the complex to the ground, and brought back his prisoners for questioning through out secret police."
 mon.179.a: "Finally, peace can be secured."

 mon.180.t: "Hundreds of Soldiers Imprisoned for Refusing to Pledge Allegiance to Ungern"
 mon.180.d: "With new measures implemented recently, forcing every soldier to pledge their full allegiance to Ungern-Sternberg, hundreds have refused to do so. Many of them claim that they do not serve Ungern, but rather serve the nation of Mongolia. However, what they fail to see is that these are one in the same. For this betrayal, these soldiers have been imprisoned, so that they cannot spread dissent against us."

 mon.181.t: "Battle Between Princes Guard and Mongolian Revolution Army"
 mon.181.d: "Many of the rich nobles and princes of Mongolia have their own guard with them at all times, almost like a private army. After hearing that they were going to have their lands seized to be distributed to the population, a few princes decided to unite their guards to protect their lands. After refusing to cede their land to the government, the newly created Mongolian Revolutionary Army were sent in, under the leadership of Dansranbilegiin Dogsom. After approaching the princes lands once again, the princes guard stood firm, and refused to allow the MRA in. Dogsom said that they had the choice now to either surrender now or face death. Though a handful of guards put down their arms and were let go, the vast majority stood their ground and refused to move. With that, Dogsom gave the command to open fire. The princes guard put up a strong fight, but they were eventually beaten by the MRA. The few that remained surrendered and were arrested, as were the princes whose troops they were."

 mon.183.d: "An ambassador from Urga arrived today, professing his support for our regime in the face of great nations seeking to invade our territories. Following the toppling of Sternberg's repressive rule by the Buddyn Zövlöl, spearheaded by the 7th Changyka Khutukhtu, our two nations have become ever more connected. In order to ensure that our legacy endures for future generations, it is only reasonable to strengthen our common Buddhist beliefs within our theocratic governments, should someday a growing force in China, India, or Russia dare to jeopardize our security."

Our armies, battered and bruised, clashed against many a foe, including the Russian horde in Siberia as well as the elite cavalry defending the Ma family's provinces. However, despite the deaths of thousands of brave Mongolian soldiers in the honour of our great state, Mongolia stands triumphant against all enemies. A parade was organized in the capital as our loyal troops return from their hardened posts to reunite with their families across the country. Many see these victories as the signalling of a brand new Mongolian golden age, a suitable return to part of what our ancestors controlled many centuries ago."

It is presumed that one of the lama-monks have broken their vows and cursed the child's health. After much searching and interrogation, it was discovered that a monk had eaten a fish on the day the young Jebtsundamba Khutukhtu became sick. After this monk was justly defrocked and beaten, the child recovered from his illness.

Agvan has presented Ungern with a Kalachakra tantra reportedly written by the late 13th Dalai Lama proclaiming the deceased Tsar Nicholas as the Ārya Tārā, the White Tara. This evidence appears to Ungern as validation for his monarchistic beliefs, and the two have stuck up a strong friendship.

There, he worked with Prince Gungsangnorbu of Harqin Right Banner at the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission. After he graduated from university in 1926, he got more involved in Mongolian affairs, getting into contact with Prince Demchugdongrub and Yondonwangchug in Chahar. Eventually he decided to travel there, to work under Demchugdongrub in Chahar Province. Later, when Demchugdongrub travelled to Urga with many Chahar nobles, he left Ünenbayan there to effectively rule the autonomous province. He proved rather effective at this, only eventually leaving Chahar during the Western Revolt, so that he could assist Demchugdongrub in Urga. Following the successful democratic revolution lead by the Mongol Ardīn Nam, Ünenbayan lobbied to stop the discrimination against the aristocrats of Urga. Being a younger man now in power of Mongolia, Ünenbayan sees an opportunity to mend the rift between the rich elite and the poor peasants, while defending the democracy that Mongolia has become."

Demchugdongrub didn't join Ungern until 1926, after Chahar province was seized from the Guominjun. For a few years after that, Demchugdongrub stayed in Chahar, leading divisions against Chinese border incursions. He even had to command troops against Chahar citizens, as many of the Han Chinese rebelled against Ungern's heavily pro-Mongol and pro-Russian rule. Demchugdongrub travelled to Urga in 1932 with Altanochir, and got quickly involved in its politics. After only a few months he was made head of the Noyodyn Zövlöl, and so he focused far less on military matters, though they remained important to him."

Roman von Ungern-Sternberg, the 'Mad Baron', had a troubled upbringing with constant moving and a father who was committed to an insane asylum. His family estate in Estonia was burned down in 1905, which confirmed his anti-peasant and eventually anti-communist beliefs. He eventually joined Pavlovskoe Military School in Saint Petersburg where he became interested in the occult and Buddhism. After graduation he was transferred to Siberia where he became known for his heavy drinking and dangerous moods. In 1913, he moved to Khovd in Outer Mongolia as an officer in the detachment at the Russian consulate, after not being allowed to fight for Mongolian independence.\n\nIn the First Weltkrieg, Ungern fought first in Galicia then, after a 2-month prison stint following attacking another officer in a drunken rage, in the Caucasus. After the breakout of the Russian Civil War, he fought with Semyonov and the whites in Siberia, acting relatively independently against the communists. Ungern eventually travelled through China where he married Manchu Princess Ji. Eventually, he moved to Urga and defeated the Chinese garrison stationed there, restoring the Bogd Khan to the throne and proclaiming Mongolia independent.\n\nUngern himself did not get too involved in Mongol problems, but he kept the peace through force. After narrowly defeating socialist revolutions in 1921 and 1924, he was forced to get more involved. His forces prowled the streets as he hunted out dissidents and purged Mongolian society, including in temples. When the 9th Jebtsundamba Khutuktu was brought to Urga in 1933, Ungern promised he would rule as regent until the boy came of age. However, with Ungern's grip dependent on his Russian military clique, there are fears he will keep the power for himself."

During the Qing Dynasty and the short lived Beiyang Government, the Changkya Khutukhtu's were the head of the Gelug line of Tibetan Buddhism in Inner Mongolia. After Ungern-Sternberg took the province of Xilingol from the Guominjun, the 7th Changkya Khutuktu declared his loyalty to Ungern-Sternberg, and travelled to Urga to work in Gandantegchinlen Monastery. After regularly holding speeches outside of the monastery, he became a very popular and important figure in Urga.\n\nHowever, his intentions changed in 1930. Ungern-Sternberg, after a small peasant rebellion in Urga, blamed multiple high ranking lamas, and purged them. This caused massive uproar in the highly Buddhist society, especially in the upper echelons. The 7th Changkya Khutukhtu therefore decided to form the Buddyn Zövlöl, a secretive group of high ranking lamas who lobbied for increased theocracy in Mongolian society. After the Western Revolt, the Buddyn Zövlöl were able to seize power, and fully begin to implement their plan to reform Mongolian society to a Gelug Buddhist centre."

He felt little in the way of a call to any national identity or supposed homeland, living most of his life under Tsarist oppression until he made a life changing visit in 1917 to the Tsugol Datsan Monastery. There, the chief Lama recommended he join the fight against the godless Bolsheviks to defend the Buryat and Buddhist way of life, encouraging him to enlist under the local cossack Ataman, Grigory Semyonov. Garmaev rapidly gained Semyonov's attention and was tasked with recruiting Buryrat speaking soldiers, a task which he excelled at. He was promoted to the officer rank and assigned to the newly formed Buryat-Mongolian regiment 1919, which was sent to support Baron Ungern-Sternberg's expedition into Mongolia. Garmaev became enamoured with the Mad Baron's esoteric sense of Mongolian nationalism, having already begun to form his own set of core beliefs, after his visit to Tsugol Datsan. He was encouraged by both Sternberg and Semyonov to preach pan-Mongolian nationalism to the regiment's troops, as well as the civilians they came across, as a means to indoctrinate them into opposing the Bolsheviks. This eventually caused Garmaev to break with Semyonov, as he grew fearful that the Ataman merely wished to exploit the Buryats and the Mongols for his own purposes, whilst viewing Sternberg as a more rightful leader, who truly had the Mongolic peoples best interests at heart. He was rapidly promoted into a leadership position by Sternberg, and has maintained a great deal of influence, both within the Mad Baron's administration, but also a growing popularity among the right leaning Mongolian nationalists who have come to accept Garmaev as one of their own."
