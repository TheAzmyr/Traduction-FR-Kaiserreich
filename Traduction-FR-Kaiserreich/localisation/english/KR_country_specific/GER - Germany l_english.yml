 GER_wilhelm_ii: "Wilhelm II"
 GER_wilhelm_ii_leader_desc: "§YBorn:§! §LJanuary 27th, 1859, in the Kronprinzenpalais, Berlin, Province of Brandenburg, Kingdom of Prussia§!\n§YBackground:§! §LReigning as King of Prussia and German Emperor since 1888, Wilhelm II has earned the respect of the world in spite of his far from positive beginnings, and German hegemony since the end of the Weltkrieg has become indistinguishable from his persona. Taut, restless and irresolute, fiercely rejecting the desire of his mother Victoria to groom him into a liberal British aristocrat, yet never fully shaking off these habits, Wilhelm ascended to the Imperial throne at the age of 29. His reign was one of bellicose \"New Course\", culminating in aggressive Weltpolitik, of feuds and conflicts with almost every one of his Chancellors, and of diplomatic blunders which isolated Germany in world affairs before the start of the Weltkrieg. In spite of the lacklustre start, Wilhelm slowly gained experience, or at least tried to temper his most irrational tendencies, especially after the Daily Telegraph Affair of 1908.\n\nThough Wilhelm was never a reformist, he equally despised being shut out of political affairs by the clique gathered around Paul von Hindenburg and Erich Ludendorff during the Weltkrieg, and tactically aligned with forces opposing their developing dictatorship at war's end. Victory in the Weltkrieg vindicated the Kaiser's imperialist course, erased his past blunders from public memory, and allowed him to break down the dictatorship of the two generals. Germany has since returned to normalcy, serving as the last anchor of the old world in a planet increasingly overtaken by revolt and revolution. By now, the Kaiser is almost 80 years old, and has ruled Germany for over half of those years. The youthful years of blunt interference in politics and xenophobic babbling in the press are past him - Wilhelm has been largely passive in German politics for well over a decade, expressing his will through a circle of advisors and the aid of his Crown Prince. However, he remains a symbol of Germany's victory, ambition, and dignity.§!"

 GER_wilhelm_iii_leader_desc: "§YBorn:§! §LMay 6th, 1882, in the Marmorpalais of Potsdam, Province of Brandenburg, Kingdom of Prussia, German Empire§!\n§YBackground:§! §LFormerly heir apparent of the German Empire since the age of six, Wilhelm III was a decorated commander in the Imperial German Army in his own right. A royal who presents an air of modernity and military discipline in spite of his numerous affairs, a competent equestrian and a student of administrative law, he began his career in the army in 1911, commissioned to command the 1st Life Hussar Regiment. When the Weltkrieg began, he rose to command the 5th Army, and then the Army Group Kronprinz Wilhelm, despite his young age and lack of military experience. His influence in decision-making on the front was minimal, however, and Wilhelm instead used the prestige of his position to support Paul von Hindenburg and Erich Ludendorff — he described the ousting of Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg as \"the most beautiful day of his life\".\n\nWilhelm returned from the Western Front a war hero and continued his duties as the heir apparent. In the post-war years, he has retained his position in the Army, while growing increasingly close with the German right wing - especially Kurt von Schleicher, who is a friend and ally of his. Assuming the throne after the passing of his father, Wilhelm III stokes concern in democrats and raises sneers among foreign diplomats who expect him to patronise militarists and expansionists, and thus has a lot to prove.§!"

 GER_wilhelm_iv_civilian: "Wilhelm von Preußen"
 GER_wilhelm_iv_leader_desc: "§YBorn:§! §LJuly 4th, 1906, in the Marmorpalais of Potsdam, Province of Brandenburg, Kingdom of Prussia, German Empire§!\n§YBackground:§! §LWilhelm IV is the oldest son of Crown Prince Wilhelm and grandson of the famous Wilhelm II. The Weltkrieg passed his life while he was merely a child, and so he grew up and gained an education in the modern, parliamentarised postwar Empire. To an average German monarchist, Wilhelm II was mostly associated with his prewar scandals, media blunders and incapacity to lead during the Weltkrieg, while the Crown Prince earned disdain due to his playboy attitude and involvement with the far right — so, they held their hopes in the second in line for the throne, the Crown Prince's son.\n\nDespite being presented throughout the interwar as a \"modern Hohenzollern\" who is able to transcend rigid class boundaries, Wilhelm avoided involving himself in politics at all. Though he participated in a few public groups as a honorary member, he generally stayed focused on sports, student clubs, and military service. Yet, over time, he began to show considerable political acumen, and became genuinely popular as time went on - his popularity grew even further during the Second Weltkrieg, when he served in the Heer as a lieutenant with distinction. As the new German Emperor, Wilhelm IV brings this experience to the field, and intends to not repeat the mistakes of his father and grandfather.§!"

Starting as an adjutant in the 19th Reserve Infantry Brigade, von Witzleben was promoted captain in October 1914 and took over an infantry company in the 6th Reserve Infantry Regiment. He later rose to command a battalion through battles near Verdun, in Champagne and in Flanders. Heavily wounded in 1918, von Witzleben attended general staff training at the end of 1918, returning to the front as chief of staff of the 121st Infantry Division shortly before the end of the war.\n\nRecognised for his excellent administrative and planning skills, Witzleben remained as a staffer for the next decade, only recently receiving his promotion to General of Infantry.

 GER_gerd_von_rundstedt: "Gerd von Rundstedt"
 GER_gerd_von_rundstedt_commander_desc: "§YBorn:§! §LDecember 12th, 1875, in Aschersleben, Province of Saxony, Kingdom of Prussia, German Empire§!\n§YBackground:§! §LBorn to a dynasty of Prussian nobility whose men all served in the military since Frederick the Great, Gerd von Rundstedt did not stray from this tradition - his path since maturity strayed little from the ordinary Prussian noble officer, first the Kadettenanstalt Oranienstein, then Royal Prussian Main Cadet Institute at Groß-Lichterfelde, in Berlin. Commissioned as an infantry officer, he made a good impression on his superiors for outstanding ability and so began to climb the ranks. At the beginning of the Weltkrieg, he was the 22nd Division's Chief of Staff - throughout the course of the war, he saw little action, mostly serving in various staff positions, but with a high reputation among his peers.\n\nAfter the war, he used this good impression and connections to climb the ranks again, ultimately reaching the rank of Generaloberst. A competent and experienced commander respected by pretty much everyone in the General Staff, von Rundstedt is also perhaps the most apolitical - no matter what the topic or issue may be, his view is that the Army must stay out of any political affairs. After all, Prussian field marshals never mutiny.§!"

 GER_alfred_von_vollard_bockelberg: "Alfred von Vollard-Bockelberg"
 GER_alfred_von_vollard_bockelberg_commander_desc: "§YBorn:§! §LJune 18th, 1874, in Magdeburg, Province of Saxony, Kingdom of Prussia, German Empire§!\n§YBackground:§! §LBy the time of the Weltkrieg, von Vollard-Bockelberg already had an impressive 20 years of peacetime service as an artillery officer in the army. He would have little chance to use his decades of experience on the frontline though, as he was soon selected to staff duties shortly after the outbreak of the war. Though hesitant to leave his position as a battery commander behind, he nevertheless approached his new position with vigour and natural skill, eventually rising to the position as chief of staff to Paul von Hindenburg by the end of the war.\n\nImpressed by the scientific advances made in warfare during the Weltkrieg, von Vollard-Bockelberg would use his position on the general staff to foster close connections with the armaments industry and lead to his appointment to the newly established Army Weapons Office (Heereswaffenamt). Through his business connections and diligent work he would eventually rise to lead the HWA and is spending the majority of his time coordinating military production with the extensive German armaments industry.§!"

 GER_rupprecht_von_bayern: "Rupprecht von Bayern"
 GER_rupprecht_von_bayern_commander_desc: "§YBorn:§! §LMay 18th, 1869, in Munich, Upper Bavaria, Kingdom of Bavaria§!\n§YBackground:§! §LThe incumbent King of Bavaria, Rupprecht Maria Luitpold Ferdinand, is also one of the most decorated commanders of the Imperial German Army during the Weltkrieg. Trained as an infantry officer in the Bavarian Army, he eventually rose to command the Bavarian I Army Corps, all while travelling extensively, taking up carpentry, and fulfilling his duties as a prince of the Bavarian royal family. In 1913, he became the heir apparent of the Kingdom, and a year later, he was assigned to lead the German Sixth Army during the Schlieffen Plan. Though his assignment was made due to his royal status, he proved to be an able and innovative commander. At the same time, however, he used his military command to push for Bavarian interests - refusing to withdraw his army from the Western Front to defend Prussia and thus forcing the General Staff to move troops from Belgium instead.\n\nIn July 1916, he was promoted to Generalfeldmarschall and was assigned to command the Army Group Rupprecht, a rank he has held onto until today. In 1921, after the passing of his father, Ludwig III of Bavaria, Rupprecht was crowned as the new King of Bavaria, and since then reigns as a constitutional monarch with respect for the laws and institutions of his homeland. Though having to occupy two chairs at once may seem exhausting for some, the King seems none worse for wear, and dutifully awaits Germany's next great war.§!"

 GER_erich_von_manstein: "Erich von Manstein"
 GER_erich_von_manstein_high_command_desc: "§YBorn:§! §LNovember 24th, 1887, in Berlin, Province of Brandenburg, Kingdom of Prussia, German Empire§!\n§YBackground:§! §LBorn as von Lewinski, Erich von Manstein comes from the family of a noble Prussian general with Kashubian heritage, and is the nephew of Paul von Hindenburg. Much like the rest of his extended family, he followed a career in the military. After six years in the cadet corps in Plön and Groß-Lichterfelde, he was commissioned into the Third Foot Guards Regiment - and reached the Weltkrieg as an infantry lieutenant enrolled in the Prussian War Academy. The war put an end to his studies and sent him to the front - both East and West, to several fronts and several world-renown campaigns, ending with the victorious march into France in 1919.\n\nAfter the end of the war, Manstein remained in the army and continued climbing the ranks, having shown his talent and intelligence in the years prior. As a newly inducted member of the General Staff, he toured countries across Europe to study their military facilities and breakthroughs in new tactics, all while developing his own. Regarded as an innovative commander with a knack for unorthodox strategies, he is one of the main proponents of combined arms warfare in the German army.§!"

 GER_heinz_guderian: "Heinz Guderian" # Starts in POL
 GER_heinz_guderian_army_chief_desc: "§YBorn:§! §LJune 17th, 1888, in Kulm, Province of West Prussia, Kingdom of Prussia, German Empire§!\n§YBackground:§! §LHeinz Guderian was born into a Prussian military family, and like his father, quickly enrolled in a military cadet school. He was already a second lieutenant when the Weltkrieg broke out, where he served as a communications officer in charge of signals intelligence of the 4th Army. Guderian fought at Verdun, in Italy and was finally stationed in Poland at the end of the war.\n\nHad he not met the famous Weltkrieg tank commander, Ernst Volckheim, Guderian might have continued along the traditional Prussian path. However, Volckheim's controversial ideas about the primacy of armoured units inspired Guderian greatly. During the 1920s he became a prolific scholar of armoured warfare and followed closely the emerging French theories of the \"guerre de mouvement.\" However, his stubborn insistence on the new doctrine and piercing sarcasm did not make him very popular among the German General Staff, and in 1927 he was \"promoted\" to act as military attaché to King August IV, and given the responsibility of overseeing and training the Polnische Wehrmacht into a modern fighting force.\n\nDespite being de facto exiled to Poland, and any career advancement, Guderian decided to put his theories into practice with the Polish army. He has gathered a clique of like-minded officers such as Oswald Lutz and even some Poles, like Władysław Anders, and most importantly, Guderian managed to convince the Polish government to support his vision of the war of the future - no doubt seeing a small, elite army as an option that would in the long term prove to be cheaper and more popular than mass conscription. By 1936, Guderian has worked tirelessly with his Panzer divisions, leading the modernisation of the Polish army and their doctrine for any future war.§!"

 GER_walter_model: "Walter Model"
 GER_walter_model_commander_desc: "§YBorn:§! §LJanuary 24th, 1891, in Genthin, Province of Saxony, Kingdom of Prussia, German Empire§!\n§YBackground:§! §LThe son of a music teacher, the young Walter Model nonetheless decided on a military career following his graduation from the Domgymnasium in Naumburg. Whatever he lacked in family connections was more than made up in his personal bravery and aptitude for command. Wounded twice during the Weltkrieg as a platoon and later company commander, Model would eventually get picked for general staff training and was one of a group of junior officers who accompanied von Seeckt to Constantinople in 1917, gaining the patronage of the later head of the OHL.\n\nThough ending the war as a divisional supply officer, many of the more influential German generals recognised Model's skill and powerful friends and quickly moved him up the ranks and into the General Staff. Widely recognised as one of the best young German generals, with the right combination of skill and political backing, Model stands ready to serve in whatever capacity is needed by the Kaiserreich. Ideologically, he is close to the political right.§!"

 GER_werner_von_blomberg: "Werner von Blomberg"
 GER_werner_von_blomberg_army_chief_desc: "§YBorn:§! §LSeptember 2nd, 1878, in Stargard, Province of Pomerania, Kingdom of Prussia, German Empire§!\n§YBackground:§! §LHailing from a German-Baltic noble family, Werner von Blomberg grew up in a stereotypical Prussian military family. Selected early for a career in the General Staff, von Blomberg spent the majority of the Weltkrieg working in various divisional, corps and army staff positions.\n\nAn ardent believer in the societal role played by the German military, von Blomberg has shown great interest in the military benefits provided by totalitarian regimes. Though clashing with von Schleicher on the issue of parliamentarism, von Blomberg is a supporter of the Red Generals ideas on mobilising the entire German state behind the army, possibly even going so far as declaring a National Defence State (Wehrstaat) to take full advantage of authoritarianism to grow Germany's military power.§!"

 GER_gunther_von_kluge: "Günther von Kluge"
 GER_gunther_von_kluge_commander_desc: "§YBorn:§! §LOctober 30th, 1882, in Posen, Province of Posen, Kingdom of Prussia, German Empire§!\n§YBackground:§! §LNicknamed \"Clever Hans\" in cadet school, von Kluge's career has had a typical trajectory of a German officer. Serving as chief of staff of the 236th Division, he was seriously wounded in 1918 and sat out the remainder of the war in a hospital bed. The injury didn't hold back Clever Hans, and he continued limited staff work whilst recovering, much to the admiration of his superiors.\n\nDeviating from his beginnings as an infantry officer, von Kluge has shown great interest in the development of armoured units and their possible use in avoiding the bogged down trench warfare known from the western front. Nominally apolitical, von Kluge is privately critical of the authoritarian and militarist tendencies of many of his fellow generals and hopes that a superior German army will be used as a deterrence against a new Weltkrieg.§!"

 GER_wilhelm_ritter_von_leeb_commander_desc: "§YBorn:§! §LSeptember 5th, 1876, in Landsberg am Lech, Upper Bavaria, Kingdom of Bavaria, German Empire§!\n§YBackground:§! §LBorn Wilhelm Leeb, the Bavarian began his career as a lieutenant in an artillery battery, with which he fought in the Boxer Rebellion. He would be granted the noble title \"Ritter von Leeb\" due to his involvement in the capture of Przemeysl fortress in 1915. Widely decorated for his staff work, von Leeb ended the war as Chief Quartermaster of Army Group \"Kronprinz Rupprecht\", working together with the future King of Bavaria.\n\nRemaining in the Royal Bavarian Army, von Leeb remained an important counterweight to the more centralisation-minded Prussian officer corps. A devout catholic and believer in the traditional structure of the German Empire, von Leeb has found little in common with the likes of von Schleicher and von Hammerstein-Equord. Should the French or Russians return to threaten the empire though, von Leeb would never hesitate to march out to defend the Kaiserreich with his fellow Bavarians, no matter who was ruling from Berlin.§!"

 GER_albert_kesselring_air_chief_desc: "§YBorn:§! §LNovember 30th, 1885, in Marktsteft, Lower Franconia, Kingdom of Bavaria, German Empire§!\n§YBackground:§! §LKesselring's fascination with the application of air power in support of the army started already before the Weltkrieg. Though an artillery officer by training, Kesselring completed a course in the use of observation balloons in 1912, something he would have plenty of chance to use by the time the Weltkrieg started. Moving from a position as adjutant in the Bavarian Foot Artillery Brigade to various divisional and corps staff appointments, Kesselring would continue to observe and expand on his knowledge on the use of aircraft in support of ground forces.\n\nMoving to the infantry branch following the conclusion of the war, Kesselring toyed with the idea of transferring to the nascent Luftstreitkräfte but decided to remain with the army for the better opportunities for advancement in the Bavarian Army. His fascination with air power has led to criticism of his negligence in following the developing fields of armoured and motorised combat, something which Kesselring himself denies.§!"

Whilst the development of armoured and motorised warfare might threaten the cavalry arm, von Mackensen is determined to use the traditional virtues of the cavalry officer to succeed.

It was also with the Guards units that he would serve the majority of the Weltkrieg. He is most widely known in the German Army for his service as chief of staff to the German intervention in the Finnish civil war in 1918. Recognised by the Finns for his personal skill, von Falkenhorst also acquired valuable experience in specialised units as well as fighting in arctic and near-arctic conditions.\n\nHe has spent most of his career following the Weltkrieg as a military attaché in countries like Finland, Austria-Hungary and in many of the new Oststaaten in Mitteleuropa. He was in discussion for commanding an expedition to Norway following the May Day Coup in 1935, but his appointment to such a command was superseded by the Trondheim Agreements signed that same summer.§!"

By the outbreak of the war, he was an orderly for XVI. Army Corps continuing to serve close to the front and witnessing the horrors of stellungskrieg first hand.\n\nRemaining in the cavalry after the end of the war, Hoepner served in various cavalry staff positions before transitioning to the Panzertruppe in the late 1920s. Recognising the value gained from frontline leadership, Hoepner is constantly at the forefront of any exercise and instils in his subordinates the same mindset. This willingness to share in the hardship of his men has earned him their admiration, and it is hard to find any German general more well-liked by their troops.§!"

 GER_ewald_von_kleist_commander_desc: "§YBorn:§! §LAugust 8th, 1881, in Braunfels, Province of Hesse-Nassau, Kingdom of Prussia, German Empire§!\n§YBackground:§! §LHailing from a family that had previously offered Prussia two field marshals, expectations for young Ewald von Kleist was high when he joined German army at age 18. Transferring from the artillery to the cavalry in 1910, von Kleist would lead his squadron from the 1st Life Hussars Regiment in the Battle of Tannenberg. Quickly recognised for his administrative and organisational skills, von Kleist was made a staff officer in the Guards Cavalry Division where he would serve the remainder of the war.\n\nA Prussian conservative to the core, von Kleist views left- and right-wing parliamentarism with equal distrust. In his mind the Kaiser is the rightful and supreme ruler of Germany, and that position should be supported by the German army. Taking it upon himself to ensure that the current factionalism in the army doesn't threaten the monarchy, von Kleist keeps himself above the petty politics, willing to follow the orders of his Kaiser and serve the Kaiserreich.§!"

His crowning achievement during the war was his close involvement in planning the 1918 German spring offensive, for which he was awarded the Pour le Mérite, the highest German military decoration.\n\nRecognised as a very capable officer, von Bock has been moved into greater and greater responsibility and he has excelled in every posting. His strict adherence to Prussian discipline and obedience has not won him much love from the soldiers under his command, but it has made sure that if Berlin and the OHL wants to get a job done, von Bock remains at the top of their list.§!"

Eventually serving with the Alpenkorps, Paulus fought with the unit everywhere from the Alps to Flanders to Romania and the Balkans. In the last place he would catch amoebiasis which would impact his health for the remainder of his life and severely impact his ability to lead from the front, meaning he increasingly sought staff positions in the army.\n\nHis diligent staff work earned him a place in the General Staff after the end of the Weltkrieg, where his illness didn't impact his performance. Severely impressing in the operations department, Paulus was nearly undone during the German-Russian crisis of 1934. As part of the OHL planning staff, Paulus was involved in the contingency planning for a German intervention in Russia following the election of Boris Savinkov. Though he is not removed alongside Otto von Below following the end of the crisis, Paulus is no longer viewed as favourably by the new Chief of the OHL.

His excellent planning skills brought Halder to the attention of Hans von Seeckt, who convinced Halder that a more efficient and leaner German army would be better prepared for future wars.

His first step to power came during the Weltkrieg, when Schleicher, a staff officer, criticised war profiteering and endorsed socially progressive economic measures, earning the reputation of a pragmatic liberal. As a protege of Groener, he served in the Kriegsamt to relative success.\n\nAfter the Weltkrieg, Schleicher developed another connection to aid in his advancement — Hans von Seeckt, the future Chief of German General Staff, who used Schleicher as a useful and competent liaison between the OHL and the civilian government.

He scored a friendship with Crown Prince Wilhelm and drew himself closer to the Kaiser, then established a working relationship with Minister-President Siegfried von Roedern, through which he was appointed Prussian Minister of War in 1931.

They formed a lifelong friendship and supported each other in their careers from then on out.\n\nHammerstein-Equord served as a staff officer during the Weltkrieg and continued rising in rank after its conclusion. In the divided Deutsches Heer, he was a supporter of von Seeckt's reforms, which would transform the army into a smaller, yet more professional force that would adapt all of the newest principles of war. Schleicher tactically backed this faction, at least for a while, and after he became the Prussian Minister of War, he pushed his lifelong friend into the highest office of the OHL, consolidating his power over the Army and giving him a powerful base for his political ambitions.

 GER_herbert_von_dirksen_sic_desc: "§YBorn:§! §LApril 2nd, 1882, in Berlin, Province of Brandenburg, Kingdom of Prussia, German Empire§!\n§YBackground:§! §LHerbert von Dirksen was born to a recently ennobled Prussian civil servant family in 1887, and grew up in a very conservative environment — his father was a devout admirer of Wilhelm II and a member of the Reichstag for the Free Conservatives. The von Dirksens were proud of their \"pure Germanic birth\" and looked down upon those who were ennobled by the more liberal Frederick III a year later. Dirksen grew up as a snobbish and stout \"new aristocrat\", constantly trying to be accepted as a real Junker.\n\nDuring the Weltkrieg, he served as a representative of the Foreign Office across the globe and continued climbing the ranks of diplomatic service in the postwar years. Dirksen's greatest accomplishment was the Vilnius Agreement with Russia in 1926, a shift towards more peaceful and cooperative Eastern policy. Thanks to his experience in Russian affairs, he was on the shortlist of potential replacements to Reichskanzler Johann von Bernstorff when diplomatic relations with Russia soured again in 1934 - an offer he accepted immediately, becoming a pawn in the greater political games inside the Imperial government. Inexperienced and having little patience for parliamentary practice, Dirksen quickly squandered his political capital and his coalition dissolved, leaving him in command of a shadow throne.§!"

After studying law and political science, he passed the legal examination in Frankfurt and worked in the state administration of the Kingdom of Prussia for the next two decades. In Niederbarnim, he pushed through numerous provincial improvements, constructed new roads, hospitals, and promoted the full electrification of the district, earning a name for himself as a capable administrator. Thanks to this experience, he earned his most famous political appointment - the wartime Reich Secretary of Finance. The Empire's precarious financial position required a capable manager who would streamline the system and raise additional revenues, and Roedern managed well in the position - the reforms to imperial finances he began during the Weltkrieg served as a blueprint for the taxation policies of future governments.\n\nAfter the Weltkrieg, Roedern remained in politics. Though often considered as a possible Reichskanzler candidate, he moved on to Prussian politics instead - the reforms to the Constitution, granting the Reichstag control over the Reichskanzler, led to the office of Prussian Minister-President being decoupled from it, and in 1925, Roedern was chosen as the next Minister-President. A staunch nonpartisan, he commands a wide coalition of the centre and right, intent to keep the Social Democrats out of power, and pursues a national conservative, though moderate course. Time will tell how long he can straddle this line.§!"

 GER_reichskanzler_in_prussia_advisor_desc: "§YBackground:§! §LUntil 1923, the offices of Reichskanzler and Minister-President of Prussia were one, and it was expected of one to also be the other. This gave Prussia imbalanced power in the system and granted the Reichskanzler additional powers owing to their position in Prussia. This system was shattered with the March Constitution - as now it would have meant that the Reichstag has the power to call a vote of no confidence on a Prussian minister-president. The election of Matthias Erzberger, a progressive Southern Catholic, was the last straw and led to Prussian decoupling, since which they have had their own Minister-Presidents. It seems that this decoupling was short-lived, however, as the Reichskanzler has become the Minister-President yet again - for brief or for long.§!"

Influenced by Pietistic beliefs in his youth, Kleist's worldview was heavily shaped by outdated, highly idealistic notions of the Prussian Monarchy and what it should embody, something that would have enormous influence on his later political writings.\n\nKleist rose to prominence in 1920 due to his highly uncompromising attitude towards agrarian farmhand strikes on his family's estates, with his native district of Belgard being one of the few areas in rural Prussia in which no concessions to the striking masses were made. Championing the harmony between employers and employees in the aftermath, Kleist and his closest family members eventually played a key role in the formation of local Landbund chapters in Further Pomerania, an incarnation of what he considered the perfect state of society: The local community as a good, harmonious Christian parish with a benevolent aristocrat at the helm.\n\nA protege of then-Oberpräsident of Pomerania & ex-chancellor Georg Michaelis, Kleist embarked on an administrative career in his home province. His ties to the Landbund and charisma enabled him a quick rise to the highest provincial echelons in Stettin, where he eventually became Oberpräsident himself in 1931, the youngest one in Pomeranian history. Well-connected in many right-wing societies, Kleist, despite being non-partisan, was long seen by many conservatives as a ray of hope, a flawless representative of the old Germany.§!"

Due to his father's early death, he had to leave school without graduation and found work as a sales assistant in Frankfurt. He found socialism through unionisation - working to unionise sales assistants in his city, he ended up involved with the Free Trade Unions and joined the SPD itself. By 1905, he had amassed enough influence with his activism that August Bebel pushed him forward as a party secretary - however, the unions, which believed that Müller was too left-wing, blocked his candidacy.\n\nBy the Weltkrieg, Müller had moderated - he sharply criticised Rosa Luxemburg and positioned himself in the party's centre, between the revolutionary left and the right-wing revisionists. Still, for a time, he lost influence to Friedrich Ebert and Philip Scheidemann. Again, he answered with a pivot - this time a bit more to the left, preying onto the frustration with the party's cooperation with the Brockdorff cabinet and passivity, he advocated a more aggressive approach that could neuter the March Coalition and allow the formation of a centre-left democratic government. In 1930, he was finally elected as one of SPD's co-chairmen - the party's uncompromising position towards the Dirksen Cabinet that helped sabotage it in the leadup to the 1936 election is the result of his agitation.\n\nMuch like his father, a follower of Ludwig Feuerbach, Müller is irreligious.§!"

While Schleicher was active politically and developed connections with parliamentarians, Bredow worked in the shadows and was appointed to Abteilung IIIb, where he collected dossiers on persons of interest in German politics and forwarded them to his ally in order to keep him informed. He welcomed the rise of the Schleicher Chancellorship and serves as the Reichskanzler's key ally in intelligence and internal security.

As he later described, \"even if the trade unions have to give up many things that represented their historical nature, they do not need to change their motto \"Through socialism to the nation\" if the national revolution follows its will for socialism with socialist deeds\". This worldview turned him towards Kurt von Schleicher, whom Erdmann was familiar with even before his appointment as Reichskanzler.

Hassell was the party's secretary from its beginnings, though he was temporarily sidelined by reactionaries such as Georg Schiele and Kapp himself.\n\nIn 1920, he rejoined the diplomatic service and was assigned to the Commune of France, where, posted in Marseille, he experienced the Syndicalist revolution in person — and was further convinced that the natural German way of life is completely opposed to this anarchist travesty. In 1930, he found his opportunity to return — record low vote share and Schiele's retirement forced a realignment in the DVLP, and Hassell, leading the so-called \"National Revolutionary\" faction, seized control. Declaring himself a \"Young Conservative\", more willing to address the social question and work with non-Protestants than his snobby predecessors, Hassell envisions a Germany built on \"Christian-social spirit\", which needs an anti-democratic Organic State to guide them into the future with a capable hand§!.\n\n§YThe effects of this Advisor are controlled by the Coalition Balance of the S-W-R Coalition.§!"

Once he returned back to Germany during exchanges of prisoners after Brest-Litovsk, he began organising successive political clubs and young conservative groups with intent to support the far right and create a \"Christian-national socialist\" alternative to Bolshevism and Syndicalism. Stadtler, a protege of Straßburg history professor and right-wing ideologue Martin Spahn, became a leading member of the latter's Alsace-based far-right Christian-Social Homeland Party (CSHP) during the 20s, which slowly developed into a regional branch of the DVLP in Alsace after the rise of Ulrich von Hassell. Appointed into the local government in Alsace-Lorraine after the 1935 Landtag elections as part of the Joseph Brom cabinet, Stadler holds surprisingly many contacts, from big business to major politicians and newspapers, and is highly ambitious - but he is a loyal follower of the First Chairman's national revolutionary, anti-democratic line.§!"

The party eventually turned into an autonomous regional branch of the DVLP after Ulrich von Hassell's rise to power. Spahn also presides over several far-right think tanks and the antisemitic German Higher Education Circle, an alliance of völkisch minded students in the Empire.

In the General Commission of Trade Unions, and later the ADGB, he was responsible for social policy and subsequently became the SPD's main social policy expert. In the party, he belongs to the \"Staatspolitiker\" wing, but nonetheless plots a thorough transformation of the German economic system, should he be given the opportunity to pursue it.§!\n\n§YBorn:§! §LOctober 3rd, 1881, in Hong Kong§!\n§YBackground:§! §LWichard von Moellendorff is an engineer of the lower noble Moellendorff family. An early adherent of the thought of Walther von Rathenau, he moved to the newly established War Raw Materials Department that was headed by him, and was assigned to lead the chemistry section. During this time, he wrote a treatise on the \"Deutsche Gemeinwirtschaft\", a compromise model between capitalism and socialist planned economy which would involve control of the economy through a parity system of councils and specialist committees which will draft annual plans for economic growth. His ideas caught the attention of Rudolf Wissell, and though he is not a member of the SPD, he was recruited to help draft a plan for the transformation of the German economy.§!"

### Ideas ###

 GER_march_to_april: "March Leads to April"
 GER_march_to_april_desc: "The March Reforms to the Bismarckian Constitution, approved in 1920 after the fall of the OHL regime, laid the groundwork for a new era of genuine constitutionalism in the German Empire. A postwar consensus soon developed under the so-called \"March Coalition\" of the liberal parties and Zentrum, which sought to retain the achievements of March, tactically cooperate with the left or the right to prevent either of them from gaining power, and finalise the glorious conclusion to Weltpolitik. Content with keeping the SPD and the DVLP away from the Chancellorship, Wilhelm II endorsed this consensus, approving their Chancellors and offering cooperative ones elsewhere.\n\nThis consensus has come to an end. Decline of the Liberale Volkspartei, the arrogant and toady attitude of Chancellor Herbert von Dirksen, and growth of Reichstag's \"Permanent Opposition\" have all contributed to its death. In mid 1935, the March Coalition dissolved, and the Chancellor now has almost no support in the Reichstag. Defying expectations, the SPD and DVLP refused to call for a vote of no confidence against the Chancellor, intending to leave him rot in the skeletal throne until the elections to the Reichstag this April. The beginning of April will cause the death of March."
 GER_imperial_pride: "Deutsches Weltreich"
 GER_imperial_pride_desc: "The German Empire is at the top of the world. Its rivals and enemies from 20 years ago have fallen to revolution, surrendered their empires, or gone into steep decline. All of the roads of this new world lead to Berlin - the economic, cultural and political heart of Europe. Our mission is to defend this new world with all of our might - as our enemies are numerous."
 GER_victors_of_wwi: "Victors of the Weltkrieg"
 GER_victors_of_wwi_desc: "On August 12th, 1919, the guns fell silent. The Weltkrieg was over, and Germany came out victorious after five grueling years of warfare. It has now been made certain in the minds of the German population that the Imperial German Army is unstoppable - France has been beaten twice and Russia has been thoroughly dismantled. Even this victory did not make the brilliant minds of the Deutsches Heer rest - new weapons and techniques of war such as armoured vehicles and combined arms have been adapted to the traditional doctrine of mobile warfare, and the Luftstreitkräfte was established as an independent air force after a pitched political brawl in 1927.\n\nAs invincible as the German army seems, however, it suffers as an institution. The laurels of victory hide lacking central coordination, dominance of the military by aristocrats and vitriolic interservice rivalry. The Heer has become divided into cliques, each with their own way to resolve the crisis, while motivation to reform the military among the civilian government is at an all time low - but if Germany is to win the inevitable Second Weltkrieg, these problems must be resolved."
 GER_pre_black_monday: "Christmas Spike"
 GER_pre_black_monday_desc: "Years of speculative investment and the proliferation of high value German government bonds have created a massive bull market in the Berlin Stock Exchange. The Stock Index of the Imperial Statistical Office is reporting record spikes in stock market price, creating a volatile, yet highly profitable market. Money is flowing fast and is rapidly funnelled into savings, investments, or, generally, even greater speculation. The consensus is that the spike in stock price will either last forever, or for just long enough that everyone can get their money's worth."

 GER_1936_election_category_desc: "\nElections to the Reichstag of the German Empire are scheduled on April 10th, 1936 - a tumultuous term finishing with even more tumultuous final four months. Centrifugal forces from the left and the right threaten to rip apart the political consensus established in the Empire ever since the end of the Weltkrieg - and few know who will come out on top in its place.\n\nThe Reichstag is elected in first-past-the-post constituencies with universal, equal and secret vote. The March Reforms of 1920 adjusted the electoral system somewhat, establishing additional constituencies and creating multi-member constituencies in major German cities, turning the system more heterogeneous and bringing the number of seats to 445. Events taking place during the election period will be able to strengthen or weaken one of the competing parties.\n\n§Y223§! seats are required for a majority. The projected results are as follows:\n\n§RFar-Left Candidates§!: [?GER.GER_farleft_seats]\n§SSPD§!: [?GER.GER_SPD_seats]\n§lLVP§!: [?GER.GER_LVP_seats]\n§mMinor Liberals§!: [?GER.GER_liberal_seats]\n§gGuelph Party§!: [?GER.GER_Guelph_seats]\n§gMinority Bloc (PP, DP, Volksbund)§!: [?GER.GER_polish_seats]\n§cZentrum§!: [?GER.GER_Zentrum_seats]\n§LAgrarian Candidates§!: [?GER.GER_agrarian_seats]\n§LDkP§!: [?GER.GER_DkP_seats]\n§nDVLP§!: [?GER.GER_DVLP_seats]\n§nFar-Right Candidates§!: [?GER.GER_farright_seats]\n"

We must control the escalation of the Uprising and find a way to suppress the strike, whether via negotiation or with force.\n\nFor an authoritarian Reichskanzler such as Kurt von Schleicher, the Ruhrkampf also presents an opportunity - if he cannot control the Reichstag via parliamentary majority, he can subordinate it by gaining §Yextraordinary powers§! to deal with the insurgency. Perhaps, if the Ruhr uprising is kept active, not growing §Rtoo strong§! or §Rtoo weak§! until the end of the year, such an opportunity can present itself?\n\nThe Ruhr uprising is measured by §YIntensity§!, representing the radicalism of the uprising. The current intensity of the Ruhr uprising is §R[?GER_ruhrkampf_strength]§! of 100, and will increase by §R10§! every 25 days.\n"

 GER_ruhrkampf_curtail_rote_fahne_desc: "Die Rote Fahne, the largest and longest lasting newspaper of the far left, has been responsible for the growth of the Ruhr strike by publishing dozens of articles calling for the workers to rise up, and its copies have been found proliferated by the Ruhr labour unions. Though we cannot stamp out its publication entirely, as they have plenty of experience working underground, we can curtail its spread with raids and police crackdowns."
 GER_ruhrkampf_activate_yellow_unions: "Activate the Yellow Unions"
 GER_ruhrkampf_activate_yellow_unions_desc: "Organised by the coaling magnates of the Ruhr, yellow unions, which resist any revolutionary activity and support the cooperation of worker and business owner, hold a presence, however meager, among the Rhenish proletariat. We must get them to spring into action and unleash a propaganda wave against the small circle of radicals who abuse the good will of the patriotic silent majority."
 GER_ruhrkampf_establish_curfews: "Establish Curfews"

 GER_ruhrkampf_selective_reform_desc: "We can weaken the morale of the strikers by convincing some of the businesses affected by the strikes to propose and implement minor reforms - as we have learned in the past well, a twenty percent jump in wage and slightly less hazardous work conditions are a paltry cost compared to a revolution down the line."

 GER_Infrastructure_Development: "Infrastructure Development in [FROM.GetName]"
 GER_Infrastructure_Development_desc: "Modern trucks, cars and other vehicles become more and more proliferous on the roads, and require modern asphalt roads to make journeys between cities smooth, swift and safe. A large network of Autobahns will not only be appreciated by the civilian population, but will also make it easier to move large quantities of military vehicles across the country in wartime - and will also employ hundreds, if not thousands of unemployed in long menial labour digging ditches and carrying cement."
 GER_Reichswerke_Development: "Reichswerke - [FROM.GetName]"
 GER_Reichswerke_Development_desc: "The National Defence State requires a strong industrial base, and all of its efforts must go towards the needs of the military - we shall establish new state owned arms industries in [FROM.GetName] to fulfil this goal."
 GER_Housing_Expansion: "Housing Expansion in [FROM.GetName]"
 GER_Housing_Expansion_desc: "Packing workers into railway cars and basements like sardines is not acceptable for the German welfare state.

 GER_Gelzenberg_Takeover: "Take Over Gelsenkirchener Bergwerks-AG"
 GER_Gelzenberg_Takeover_desc: "Established in Essen, Gelsenkirchener Bergwerks-AG is one of the largest coal mining companies in the German Empire, and it spent the interwar period acquiring a larger and larger share of the market through acquisitions of their competitors, often financed through various loans. Now, its owner, Friedrich Flick, is faced with the cost of his overambitious investments - a failing enterprise and massive due loans weighing down the entire conglomerate. As he is looking for someone to buy his stocks off him, we have the opportunity to step in and purchase a controlling share in GBAG, effectively giving the state control over much of German coal industry."
 GER_Vereinigte_Stahlwerke: "Create Vereinigte Stahlwerke"
 GER_Vereinigte_Stahlwerke_desc: "The Ruhr is home to numerous iron, steel and coal companies which healthily competed during the economic boom of the twenties and thirties, but the new economic crisis means that they all are rapidly falling to the rut. We have the opportunity to orchestrate an enormous merger of all of these enterprises into one, the United Steel Works, and so place much of the industrial capacity in the Ruhr under one, massive, friendly corporation."
 GER_Heidelberg_Cement: "Merge Heidelberg Cement and Portland-Zement Spohn AG"
 GER_Heidelberg_Cement_desc: "Heidelberg and the Spohn family company are the two leading cement producing companies in Baden, and during the post-Weltkrieg period, they increasingly gravitated towards one another. It is time for the government to aid these two companies take the next step, and start integrating into a massive cement industry cartel which will be able to fulfil any military-industrial contracts with ease."

 GER_Fanta: "Commission Creation of Ersatz Coca-Cola"
 GER_Fanta_desc: "The American Civil War has made it impossible for the German branch of Coca-Cola to safely import Coca-Cola syrup from the United States, and the beginning of the Second Weltkrieg has isolated the company from easy to access overseas alternatives to the syrup. To keep up wartime morale and create a drink which will make the lives of German citizens sweeter at a time when sugar is heavily rationed, we shall commission the German branch of Coca-Cola to create an ersatz drink produced from ingredients available in Germany, even the leftovers of leftovers."
 GER_Leuna_Synthetics: "Industrial Application of the Bergius Process"
 GER_Leuna_Synthetics_desc: "Created by Nobel Prize winner Friedrich Bergius, the Bergius process is a method of production of liquid hydrocarbons by applying high temperature and pressure to bituminous coal. This is a costly, but self-sufficient way of creating fuel from coal, and though it has generally been deemed not very cost efficient by our chemical industry, our national defence needs take precedence. Our precarious geopolitical situation means that no matter how much oil we extract from across the world, these sources may be cut off by Internationale fleets - so, we need emergency domestic oil production to keep the machine going."
 GER_Rayon_Production: "Support Rayon Production"
 GER_Rayon_Production_desc: "Rayon is a semi-synthetic fiber made of regenerated cellulose. It is used for a wide range of fabrics, from household textiles to uniforms and ropes. Historically, Germany has been a leader in the production of rayon, and it is the home of the Bemberg process, which creates unusually fine and non-flammable artificial fiber, useful for a number of applications, even parachute silk. More importantly, it can be produced with wood pulp alone, and can thus make us independent of expensive silk and cotton imports from overseas and from the colonies."

 GER_Mittelland_Canal: "Complete the Mittelland Canal"
 GER_Mittelland_Canal_desc: "The Mittelland Canal began construction in 1906 and is an ambitious project to connect the largest waterways of the country and create a direct shipping route from the Rhineland to Berlin. Before and after the war, its construction slowly went from the Dortmund-Ems Canal, to Sehnde, then Peine, then Braunschweig. Now, the final link remains - Magdeburg, where the Mittelland Canal will connect to the Elbe-Havel Canal and so the Elbe river. This shall require thousands of workers and lots, lots of intense manual labour, but once complete, it will become a massive boon to German internal trade."
 GER_Lehnmuhle_Dam: "Complete the Lehnmühle Dam"
 GER_Lehnmuhle_Dam_desc: "Consistent floods in the eastern Ore Mountains and growing need for a local source of electricity have gotten the Saxon government to begin constructing dams on the Kingdom's most notable rivers. The Malter Dam and the Klingenberg Dam were completed before the Weltkrieg, and the beginning of the economic crisis caused by the Black Monday crash have renewed plans to dam the Wilde Weißeritz river as well. Massive slabs of gneiss from Saxon quarries need to be carried and brought to the construction site and new roads need to be built to route around the expected dam reservoir, and both of these tasks shall be completed with the labour of thousands of German unemployed workers."
 GER_Peat_Extraction: "Peat Extraction in the Northern Moorlands"
 GER_Peat_Extraction_desc: "North Germany is home to numerous bogs, marshes and moors which have been a headache to the local inhabitants for centuries. They have since been colonised and inhabited, however, and through this colonisation, we have learned about their economic potential. Moorlands are a great source of peat, a low quality substitute for coal or wood, which can be dug from the ground and used as supplementary fuel by local industries and private homes. The Imperial government shall establish a peat mining company in Mecklenburg, partially owned by the state and partially by the Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, and recruit hundreds of unemployed to extract peat across the region."
 GER_Alpine_Dams: "Expand Hydroelectric Power in the Alps"
 GER_Alpine_Dams_desc: "The Alpine regions are home to numerous fast flowing rivers with untapped potential for electricity generation. Hydroelectric dams, large and small alike, have already been constructed in Bavaria and Baden, but further Imperial support can ensure that this industry grows even greater than before. In addition, dam construction is a very labour intensive process, one which we can employ many unemployed workers so they can make a living."

 GER_Opelwerk_Brandenburg: "Finance Opelwerk Brandenburg"
 GER_Opelwerk_Brandenburg_desc: "Opel, one of Germany's most important car manufacturers, has expanded steadily throughout the 1920s and 1930s, having pioneered innovative mass production technologies which allowed it to hold more than 25% of the domestic passenger car market since 1928. The company has continued expanding even after the Black Monday crisis, and seeks to establish a new production site in Brandenburg, near Berlin. Should we provide this initiative support, we will gain an ally in the automotive sector which promises to produce thousands of trucks for the future war effort."
 GER_Auto_Union: "Orchestrate Formation of Auto Union AG"
 GER_Auto_Union_desc: "During the 1920s, Danish engineer Jørgen Skafte Rasmussen significantly expanded his influence in the German automotive sector, starting with his acquisition of a majority share in Audiwerk AG, commonly known as just Audi, followed by several smaller automotive enterprises across Saxony. However, the economic crisis following Black Monday dealt a serious blow to his empire and he has been forced to surrender much of his assets to other investors and banks. Here, however, we have the opportunity to intervene - if we reorganise and merge all of Rasmussen's holdings into one conglomerate, we will inject rationalisation and efficiency into the Saxon automotive industry. Let us call this conglomerate \"Auto Union\" - and bestow it a symbol of four interlocked O's to signify its origins."
 GER_BMW: "Vehicle Contracts for BMW-Fahrzeugfabrik Eisenach"
 GER_BMW_desc: "Bayerische Motoren Werke AG is a Bavarian engine manufacturer which made a living from producing aircraft and motorcycle engines during the 1920s and 1930s. Through some clever purchases, however, they acquired Fahrzeugfabrik Eisenach AG, an automobile production plant in Thuringia, and have begun delving into passenger car production. Their first attempts have not been very successful - if we provide BMW with beneficial contracts, however, we can foster their development as an independent vehicle manufacturer, and so put their resources to use in wartime."

 GER_Mobelwerke_Turnet: "Support Felke-Möbelwerke and Thonet"
 GER_Mobelwerke_Turnet_desc: "Felke-Möbelwerke and Thonet are two of Germany's largest furniture companies, and each employ over a thousand workers for the production of various carpentry, such as the famous No. 14 chair, also known as the Bistro Chair, which no cafe in Europe can do without. Their importance during wartime cannot be understated, either - furniture factories can easily switch to the production of bunk beds, boxes and other military materiel. Providing these two companies with additional government contracts will establish cooperation between them and the government, and allow their wartime potential to be put to use."
 GER_Beer_Breweries: "Subsidise Beer Breweries"
 GER_Beer_Breweries_desc: "Beer is an important part of German culture and remains an important industry to this day. It was here that the Reinheitsgebot, the first beer production safety regulations in Europe, was promulgated in 1516 and influences beer production standards in the German Empire to this day. While the beer market is weaker in northern Germany, it is more centralised under several prominent brands, while the south, especially Bavaria, is home to a vast world of small breweries that cater to the local population. Through cooperation with the German Brewers' Association, we can target state support towards productive and high quality establishments, and ensure that the beer brewing industry grows unimpeded."
 GER_Rheinhessen_Wine: "Develop the Rheinhessen Wine Region"
 GER_Rheinhessen_Wine_desc: "France and the Mediterranean may claim to be the home of European wines, but southern Germany has also traditionally produced famous, high quality wines for domestic and foreign consumption. Rheinhessen is the largest of the 16 German Weinanbaugebiete (wine regions), lies on the left bank of the Rhine, and is renown for Liebfraumilch, a semi-sweet white wine. Considerable investment into these wine producers and the opening of the German wine market for extensive exports - though also with the assurance that the good name of German wines will not be sullied by cheaply produced mass alternatives - will ensure the rapid growth of the German wine industry."
 GER_Tobacco_Cigarettes: "Guarantee Tobacco Supply for Cigarette Industry"
 GER_Tobacco_Cigarettes_desc: "The German tobacco industry is consolidated under several conglomerates such as Reemtsma and Batschari, and while this vice remains as popular as ever, the profits of the companies providing it are not as considerable. Poor tobacco harvests in Turkey and other tobacco-growing regions as well as rising taxes have severely dented the revenues of the cigarette producers. As this industry is also an important taxpayer, we must ensure it survives by reducing tariffs on tobacco leaves and scaling down anti-smoking campaigns."
 GER_Glasfabrik_Lamberts: "Contracts for Glasfabrik Lamberts"
 GER_Glasfabrik_Lamberts_desc: "The so-called Glashütte, established in the Fichtelgebirge by Laurenz Lamberts in the late 19th century, is one of the most important glass producers in the German Empire due to its universality - its grounds are able to produce profile, ornamental, wired and antimony-free solar glass, and it relies upon local resources rather than importing it from overseas. Providing this company with government contracts will establish a beneficial relationship and allow us to foster military grade glass production - precise craftsmanship which can be used in weaponry, planes and aircraft."

 GER_People_Apartments: "Commission Volkswohnung Apartments"
 GER_People_Apartments_desc: "Even before the Industrial Revolution, Germany was relatively urbanised compared to the rest of Europe, and this process accelerated greatly after the foundation of the Empire - between 1871 and 1910, the percentage of rural population in Germany decreased from 64 percent to 40 percent. This process has continued since the Weltkrieg, as greater job opportunities and the agricultural crisis in East Elbia have pushed many to move from villages and towns to urban heartlands in the north and west. The Rhineland, Saxony, Berlin and the northern coastal cities such as Hamburg and Kiel are the main recipients of this migration. However, urbanisation requires expansion of housing and living space that private enterprise cannot yet provide. The state must establish social housing construction authorities which will develop large, suburban apartment blocks that can house hundreds of families each."
 GER_People_Tractor: "Commission Production of the Volkstraktor"
 GER_People_Tractor_desc: "The \"people's tractor\" (Volkstraktor) will be a cheap and affordable tractor which will serve the needs of small German farmers, who are not wealthy enough to afford modern equipment and thus the efficiency of their farming lags behind the world standard. In addition, tractor factories can be quickly converted to military production during wartime - switching to trucks or tanks."
 GER_People_Refrigerator: "Commission Production of the Volkskühlschrank"
 GER_People_Refrigerator_desc: "The \"people's refrigerator\" (Volkskühlschrank) will be a utilitarian, cheaply made refrigerator which can be afforded by the general population. The utility of refrigerators cannot be understated, the ability to store large amounts of food for a much longer time than usual will be a visible jump in quality of living for the average German."
 GER_People_Car: "Develop State-Owned Automobile Factories"
 GER_People_Car_desc: "The Ford T has shown the demand for automobiles among the people — in two decades, the car has become indispensable for even the average American. German manufacturers have attempted creating their own \"people's cars\", but none have managed to reach anywhere near the success of Henry Ford. Perhaps the future lies in state sponsored and orchestrated automobile construction — let us adapt one of the proposed \"people's car\" designs and establish state-owned automobile factories which will be able to provide inexpensive cars for the general population. Most importantly, however, these factories can easily be converted to producing military trucks or tanks in wartime."

 GER_Westfalenhutte: "Expand Westfalenhütte"
 GER_Westfalenhutte_desc: "Established by Hoesch AG in 1871, the Westfalenhütte northeast of Dortmund is one of the largest industrial sites in western Germany, employing thousands of workers in heavy industries. The tall chimneys of its numerous steel furnaces, seen from afar, are a symbol of the industrialisation of the Rhineland, the powerhouse of the German economy it has become, and the importance of heavy industry to all of Germany, if not Europe. It still has room for improvement, however. Additional investments in the site will allow us to make room for additional factories, and the establishment of a train station for the site will allow production to come in and out much more efficiently."
 GER_Walzstahlhaus: "Establish the Dortmund Rolled Steel Association"
 GER_Walzstahlhaus_desc: "The Ruhr is home to numerous steel producers and a myriad of steel processing plants - while competition between them is healthy for the market, they also need to be able to cooperate, be it for common production standards or for shared military production quotas. The Walzstahlhaus in Düsseldorf will become the home of the Rolled Steel Producers' Association of Germany, and it will become of the greater Stahlwerksverband, a cartel of industrialists which controls the steel market in Germany. This will ensure that civilians and the military will have access to plentiful high quality rolled steel."
 GER_Bosch_Hildesheim: "Establish Bosch Trillke-Werke GmbH"
 GER_Bosch_Hildesheim_desc: "Based in Stuttgart, Bosch AG is the leading producer of electric appliances and engines in Germany, and expanded greatly during the 1920s and 1930s through strategic acquisitions and diversification of its production. It is also no stranger to military contracts - already, Bosch provides the Heer with crucial equipment such as injection pumps, starters, and magneto igniters. Plants which will be geared towards production of armaments for the army will thus be a natural development for them. We have been introduced to a plan to establish a state financed Bosch industrial plant away from the French border, in Hildesheim, which will solely produce armaments and appliances for military needs - and, of course, employ hundreds of workers relieved during the crisis as well - let us give Robert Bosch the green light for this project."

 GER_railroad_decisions_category: "Deutsche Reichsbahn"
 GER_railroad_decisions_category_desc: "\nThe railways of the German Empire were traditionally owned by the states. Each state large enough to own its own rail service would also have its own rail company, which set its own fares and maintained its own stock. Since Otto von Bismarck's failure to establish a state rail company in 1875, the Royal Prussian Railways continued his dream of centralisation through a more careful path, purchasing the smaller rail companies and coordinating them with Berlin. Now, we have completed this goal and can establish the Deutsche Reichsbahn - and bring unsurpassed rationalisation to the infrastructure system.\n"

 GER_debt_negotiations_SWI_desc: "Although a small nation, the Swiss possess substantial reserves of gold and hard currencies from across the globe. In spite of their geopolitical position, they know just as well as we do that if our economy were to fail, a large amount of their capital would become worthless. It is with this knowledge that we shall sit down with their creditors, allowing us to restructure our debts into something more manageable."

 GER_debt_negotiations_CAN_desc: "Albeit a remnant of the former British Empire, Canada still possesses significant financial capital. Much of this wealth hails from wealthy exiles, many of whom had substantial holdings in our economy prior to its crash. Sending our financers to Ottawa to hash out new repayment terms could serve as a first step towards thawing relations, as well as securing potential cooperation in the future."
 GER_debt_negotiations_RUS_desc: "In the aftermath of Black Monday, the financial dominance we held over Russia has been dramatically weakened. Through the mass sale and foreclosure of bankrupt businesses to the forced nationalisation schemes of the Vozhd, a large amount of economic influence was wiped out overnight. In spite of this, much to Moscow's lament, we still hold a significant stake in their economy - at least for the time being. With this in mind, we should act with urgency to recover as much of our assets and capital as we can before it is too late."
 GER_debt_negotiations_JAP_desc: "Relations with Japan remain tense, even more so now that Black Monday has weakened our once seemingly unchallengeable grip in East Asia. Regardless of this, the Zaibatsu had still invested in several ventures and holdings outside of Manchuria in the ensuing years of the Weltkrieg. These included industries owned by AOG as well as resources in Indochina and Malaya. For the time being Tokyo still needs to trade with us, something both sides are painfully aware of. As such, we shall send our diplomats abroad with the unenviable task of negotiating with Japanese investors for the sake of our own economic preservation."
 GER_debt_negotiations_AST_desc: "Although Australasia does not trade much with Germany directly by virtue of its location on the other side of the globe, it does with our various colonial holdings in East Asia. Even if relations between our two nations are chilly, there are a lot of wealthy investors that fled there after the fall of the British Empire, it would be unwise for us to overlook them. As a result, telegrams should be sent to Canberra to settle any existing debts."
 GER_debt_negotiations_SWE_desc: "The wealthiest of the Scandinavian nations, Sweden was an essential trading partner during the Weltkrieg and following years of prosperity for its iron ore and coke. With the ensuing chaos of Black Monday, many investors on both sides of our nations have been left in a state of uncertainty. A delegation to Stockholm to negotiate new credit limits would be mutually beneficial in ensuring the continued flow of financial capital between our two economies."

Lacking any other options, the government of Bavaria has declared a nullification of federal law in Bavaria, creating an unprecedented crisis. Schleicher's solution to this potentially illegal act is a Reichsexekution on Bavaria and an amendment to the Enabling Act, allowing the government to intervene in member states to establish State Commissars if said state does not follow the terms of the act.

 GER_schl_luninck_esplanade_circle: "Alliance with the Esplanade Circle"
 GER_schl_luninck_esplanade_circle_desc: "The Esplanade Circle is an elitist group of both industry and Junker representatives that regularly hosts high-society dinner evenings at the Hotel Esplanade in Berlin. Its central figure is none other than influential DkP politician Tilo von Wilmowsky, who, as a powerful Landbund functionary and husband of Barbara Krupp, acts as the most prominent liaison between industry and agriculture. We should get in contact with them and hear their vision for an economic policy that truly can create a balance between the two economic sectors without putting anyone at a disadvantage."
 GER_schl_luninck_seize_farmers_association: "Seize Control of the VdB" # https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_the_German_Farmers_Associations
 GER_schl_luninck_seize_farmers_association_desc: "The VdB (Association of the German Farmers Associations) is a powerful agrarian lobby group that operates in the Empire's Catholic regions, where the Landbund was never able to fully set foot. While also dominated by aristocratic landowners, the VdB enjoys close ties to the Zentrum Party, and thus is not within our sphere of influence. That needs to change. The key figure we need to get rid of is its chairman, moderate Zentrum politician Andreas Hermes. When he's gone, nothing stands in the way of closer cooperation between Protestant Landbund and Catholic VdB anymore, and we can drastically expand our influence on Germany's plethora of agricultural organisations."
 GER_schl_luninck_east_elbia: "East Elbian Negotiations"
 GER_schl_luninck_east_elbia_desc: "To achieve our end goal of a powerful agrarian unity organisation, we need to bring the Landbund on board. While their president Eberhard von Kalckreuth is open towards our plans, he is also hell-bent on carving out the most influence for his own organisation in future fusion negotiations. However, we cannot allow that the elitist Junkers will get the upper hand in this hypothetical unity organisation, the VdB-aligned smallholders in the west need to be represented as well. Via a carrot and stick policy, it should be possible to rein in Kalckreuth - the government will grant additional benefits to junkers and bail out their estates should Kalckreuth show restraint, furthermore, representation-related concessions to Prussian farmhands need to be made so that the Landbund can shed off its elitist reputation."
 GER_schl_luninck_agricultural_trade_restriction: "The Inviolability of Hereditary Property"
 GER_schl_luninck_agricultural_trade_restriction_desc: "The German agricultural sector has always been of extraordinary importance to our society, and it is important that we protect and preserve it in its current form, as junkers and smallholders have contributed equally to the glorious history of our nation. While limited land reform would technically be in our interest, it might alarm the rural elites and potentially foil our political vision. Therefore, we will respect the existing family fideicommissa and pass a law that will institute so-called \"Erbhöfe\" (Hereditary Farms), which will prevent farming estates from being mortgaged, alienated or split up. Such measures will highlight the societal importance of our farmers, and not reduce them to rational economic subjects that will be replaced the second they become unprofitable."
 GER_schl_luninck_endorse_cooperative_banking: "Rationalisation of the Rural Cooperative System"
 GER_schl_luninck_endorse_cooperative_banking_desc: "In recent German history, so-called agricultural cooperative societies like Raiffeisen or RV have been a core aspect of rural life. Rooted in Christian traditions, they provide loans and cheap commodities for millions of farmers and are the focal point of countless village societies. During the past 2 decades, however, a dangerous fragmentation within the cooperative system has taken place; many rural lobby groups have their own cooperatives, not to mention local variations. In these times of crisis, a \"rationalisation\" is necessary - we need to streamline the cooperative movement from above by working towards a powerful, but independent unity organisation aligned to our interests."
 GER_schl_baade_command_economy: "Reinstate the Agrarian Command Economy"
 GER_schl_baade_command_economy_desc: "The agrarian crisis can only be overcome via temporary state interventionist measures. Progress and change sometimes have to be imposed from above, no matter how controversial this decision might be. In times of scarcity and hardship, there is no liberal-capitalist alternative: The farmer has to be reminded of his obligations to the nation, and our production has to be thoroughly modernised and adapted to the needs of the consumers. For that, we need total, but temporary state regulation of the entire agricultural market."
 GER_schl_baade_supplant_landbund: "Supplant the Landbund"
 GER_schl_baade_supplant_landbund_desc: "The Reichslandbund, Germany's most powerful agrarian lobby group, claims to equally represent the interests of Junkers and small-scale farmers alike, but due to the sheer power of the Junker-dominated local associations in East Elbia, the head office in Berlin has always pursued a course that benefits their most powerful backers. That needs to change; since the landowners are sceptical of our political course, the smallholder element in the organisation and in the board must be strengthened - through intrigues, indirect interference into local chairman elections and contact men at the municipal level."
 GER_schl_baade_agricultural_settlement: "Agricultural Settlement Promotion Act"
 GER_schl_baade_agricultural_settlement_desc: "Intended to secure a solid funding base for the promotion of rural settlement in the East, this law will be the first step to break the rural hegemony of the dying Junker class. The creation of small suburban farm settlements will be the opening move; later, the liquidation of unprofitable Junker estates will follow, which will allow us to strengthen small and mid-sized farmers, encourage settlement and breed a new generation of proud, efficiently working smallholders - if you can't manage your finances, the government should not bail you out."
 GER_schl_baade_esplanade_circle: "Win the Loyalty of Farmhand Unions"
 GER_schl_baade_esplanade_circle_desc: "Our pact with the United Federation of Christian Trade Unions and the social democratic Free Trade Unions is primarily tailored towards improving the conditions of the suffering urban population. But why stop there? There are also unions for farmhands and forestry workers in the countryside, which are affiliated with the main trade unions but have always played a rather marginal role. If we can create a stable basis for negotiations between Georg Schmidt, president of the SPD-aligned German Agricultural Workers' Union, and Franz Behrens, who presides over the conservative Central Association of Forestry, Agricultural and Vineyard Workers of Germany, we might be able to establish Schleicher's Querfront more firmly outside the cities."
 GER_schl_baade_east_elbia: "Rural Arbeitsbeschaffung Programme"
 GER_schl_baade_east_elbia_desc: "Where else do large-scale job creation schemes have as much merit as in the countryside? Roads, railways, new train stations, renovation of public buildings, land development, straightening of waterways: Everything that benefits the Empire's rural infrastructure leads back to economic recovery!"

 GER_schlange_agricultural_settlement: "Agricultural Settlement Promotion Act"
 GER_schlange_agricultural_settlement_desc: "Intended to secure a solid funding base for the promotion of rural settlement in the East, this law will be the first step of many towards Schlange's vision of re-agrarianisation. The creation of small suburban farm settlements will be the opening move; later, the liquidation of unprofitable Junker estates will follow, which will allow us to strengthen small and mid-sized farmers and breed a new generation of proud, efficiently working smallholders loyal to the conservative cause."
 GER_schlange_agrarian_command_economy: "Pursue the Agrarian Command Economy"
 GER_schlange_agrarian_command_economy_desc: "The agrarian crisis can only be overcome via temporary state interventionist measures. Progress and change sometimes have to be imposed from above, no matter how controversial this decision might be. In times of scarcity and hardship, there is no liberal-capitalist alternative. The farmer has to be reminded of his obligations to the nation, and our production has to be thoroughly modernised and adapted to the needs of the consumers. For that, we need total, but temporary state regulation of the entire agricultural market."
 GER_schlange_supplant_landbund: "Supplant the Landbund Leadership"
 GER_schlange_supplant_landbund_desc: "The Reichslandbund, Germany's most powerful agrarian lobby group, claims to equally represent the interests of Junkers and small-scale farmers alike, but due to the sheer power of the Junker-dominated local associations in East Elbia, the head office in Berlin has always pursued a course that primarily benefits their most powerful backers. That needs to change - since the landowners are sceptical of our political agenda, the smallholder element in the organisation and in the board must be strengthened through intrigues, indirect interference into local chairman elections and contacts with men at municipal level."
 GER_schlange_agricultural_restructuring: "Agricultural Restructuring Programme"
 GER_schlange_agricultural_restructuring_desc: "The core essence of Schlange's reform programme is guaranteeing long-term competitiveness of German agricultural goods on the Mitteleuropean and international market. To achieve this, far-reaching modernisation, mechanisation and intensification is required - produce more, produce cheaper and conserve better. In the future, we will focus less on unprofitable grain cultivation, and more on the production of high-quality animal products. This is the only chance for our agricultural sector to grow efficiently into the global economy without having to rely on subsidies and tariff barriers forever."
 GER_schlange_self_help: "The Principle of Self-Help"
 GER_schlange_self_help_desc: "A key principle of Schlange's economic creed is the personal responsibility of the farm's manager and the necessity of self-help, especially in times of economic hardship. In his words, \"only those have a right to get help from outside who invest their own best effort on the inside\". For that, a strengthened network of social rural cooperatives is necessary - support for the people by the people, and free rein to the diligent for the benefit of the whole society. For that, the government needs to exert more far-reaching control over the Prussian Central Cooperative Fund, a nominally independent credit union which has favoured especially highly-indebted junkers in recent years. Now, an end has to be put to the increasing indebtedness of large, inefficient estates, and funds need to reach small-scale farmers instead."
 GER_luninck_esplanade_circle: "Alliance with the Esplanade Circle"
 GER_luninck_esplanade_circle_desc: "The Esplanade Circle is an elitist group of both industry and Junker representatives that regularly hosts high-society dinner evenings at the Hotel Esplanade in Berlin. Its central figure is none other than influential DkP politician Tilo von Wilmowsky, who, as a powerful Landbund functionary and husband of Barbara Krupp, acts as the most prominent liaison between industry and agriculture. We should get in contact with them and hear their vision for an economic policy that truly can create a balance between the two economic sectors without putting anyone at a disadvantage."
 GER_luninck_seize_farmers_association: "Seize Control of the VdB" # https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_the_German_Farmers_Associations
 GER_luninck_seize_farmers_association_desc: "The VdB (Association of the German Farmers Associations) is a powerful agrarian lobby group that operates in the Empire's Catholic regions, where the Landbund was never able to fully set foot. While also dominated by aristocratic landowners, the VdB enjoys close ties to the Zentrum Party, and thus is not within our sphere of influence. That needs to change. The key figure we need to get rid of is its chairman, moderate Zentrum politician Andreas Hermes. When he's gone, nothing stands in the way of closer cooperation between Protestant Landbund and Catholic VdB anymore, and we can drastically expand our influence on Germany's plethora of agricultural organisations."
 GER_luninck_east_elbia: "East Elbian Negotiations"
 GER_luninck_east_elbia_desc: "To achieve our end goal of a powerful agrarian unity organisation, we need to bring the Landbund on board. While their president Eberhard von Kalckreuth is open towards our plans, he is also hell-bent on carving out the most influence for his own organisation in future fusion negotiations. However, we cannot allow that the elitist Junkers will get the upper hand in this hypothetical unity organisation, the VdB-aligned smallholders in the west need to be represented as well. Via a carrot and stick policy, it should be possible to rein in Kalckreuth - the government will grant additional benefits to junkers and bail out their estates should Kalckreuth show restraint, furthermore, representation-related concessions to Prussian farmhands need to be made so that the Landbund can shed off its elitist reputation."
 GER_luninck_agricultural_trade_restriction: "The Inviolability of Hereditary Property"
 GER_luninck_agricultural_trade_restriction_desc: "The German agricultural sector has always been of extra-ordinary importance to our society, and it is crucial that we protect and preserve it in its current form, as junkers and smallholders have contributed equally to the glorious history of our nation. In recent years, notions of land reform have been popularised not only by the political left, but also by misled conservative populists. Such ideas are simply not compatible with our traditions. We will respect the existing family fideicommissa and pass a law that will institute so-called \"Erbhöfe\" (Hereditary Farms), which will prevent farming estates from being mortgaged, alienated or split up. Such measures will highlight the societal importance of our farmers, and not reduce them to rational economic subjects that will be replaced the second they become unprofitable."
 GER_luninck_endorse_cooperative_banking: "Rationalisation of the Rural Cooperative System"
 GER_luninck_endorse_cooperative_banking_desc: "In recent German history, so-called agricultural cooperative societies like Raiffeisen or RV have been a core aspect of rural life. Rooted in Christian traditions, they provide loans and cheap commodities for millions of farmers and are the focal point of countless village societies. During the past 2 decades, however, a dangerous fragmentation within the cooperative system has taken place; many rural lobby groups have their own cooperatives, not to mention local variations. In these times of crisis, a \"rationalisation\" is necessary - we need to streamline the cooperative movement from above by working towards a powerful, but independent unity organisation aligned to our interests."

Though he is a member of the DkP, his endorsement for Hugenberg would convince swaying deputies that Hugenberg will be able to retain the coalition."
 GER_DVLP_schmidt_alignment: "Vulnerability: §YOtto Schmidt§!"
 GER_DVLP_schmidt_alignment_desc: "Otto Schmidt is the DVLP's main contact with veteran organisations, and though he is nominally considered a part of Hassell's faction, his personal ties to Hugenberg make him vulnerable to Hugenberg's efforts to gather allies. His endorsement would significantly weaken the National Revolutionaries."
 GER_DVLP_levetzow_alignment: "Vulnerability: §YMagnus von Levetzow§!"
 GER_DVLP_levetzow_alignment_desc: "The veteran admiral Magnus von Levetzow is an important member of Hassell's National Revolutionary faction, but his loyalty to the Chairman is wavering. Deeply distrustful of socialists and of democracy, he desires a stronger hand from the government and a determined move towards authoritarianism - which Hugenberg might fulfil."
 GER_DVLP_trotha_alignment: "Vulnerability: §YAdolf von Trotha§!"

Though we cannot break his control over the right-wing news, we can challenge him and thus reassure some of our party members by supporting an alternative. Hugenberg will not take this well, however."
 GER_hugenberg_joint_committee: "Establish the Joint Committee of the Fatherland Party"

 GER_SPD_land_reform_desc: "Large parts of the East Elbian countryside are still stuck in the age of Old Fritz, with inefficiently run Junker estates, many of which have been in hereditary fideicommissum possession of certain magnate families for centuries, dominating the agricultural sector. Despite the highly indebted nature of these estates, previous governments have bailed out the Junkers for decades - this has to end. The liquidation of unprofitable, effectively bankrupt Junker estates and the subsequent partition of this land into parcelled out settlement areas for farmhands will allow us to strengthen small and mid-sized farmers and breed a new generation of proud, efficiently working smallholders loyal to the democratic cause."
 GER_SPD_rural_democratic_sentiment: "Foster Rural Democratic Sentiment"
 GER_SPD_rural_democratic_sentiment_desc: "The German peasant never has been thrilled about democracy and parliamentarism, mainly because the conservative sway on rural education is so high. The rural masses need to learn what benefits parliamentary representation can have for them - we need to support democratic-minded agrarian movements such as the German Peasantry, the Bavarian Peasants' League, and the Association of the German Farmers Associations as a counterweight against the reactionary Landbund's influence, enforce the democratisation of local agricultural chambers, and get the vast array of rural cooperatives on board for our vision."

 GER_SPD_revitalise_german_east_desc: "The East might be rural, barren, and, most importantly, a hotbed of reactionism. Nonetheless, it is not a lost cause: Neither for economic improvement, nor for democratic ideals. For years, Berlin's Eastern Aid payments have only reached the large agrarian estates, with a majority of funds ending up in the pockets of the Junkers. Consequently, the conditions in East Elbia have barely improved throughout the last few decades. To improve the standard of living, a much broader programme needs to be introduced that affects all areas of life: Industries that complement the local agricultural enterprises, proper infrastructure to connect urban centres with the periphery, modernisation of ports and waterways, and additional funds for the diligent settlers in Posen and West Prussia."
 GER_SPD_profiteers_crack_down: "Crack Down on Profiteers"
 GER_SPD_profiteers_crack_down_desc: "Even during the deepest crisis, there are always individuals who attempt to profit from the misery of others and line their own pockets. Certain parasitic trading companies buy their goods from the farmers at the lowest possible price and then squeeze the final consumer dry. This solidarity-lacking behaviour aggravates the economic situation and can be prevented by a more effective organisation of and closer ties between consumer and producer cooperatives. Short paths between consumer and producer without superfluous intermediate steps will counteract the high price spread."
 GER_SPD_reform_rural_credit: "Reform the Rural Credit Market"
 GER_SPD_reform_rural_credit_desc: "The Junkers firmly control the municipal administration East of the Elbe: Many local credit institutions as well as provincial commissions are subverted by their henchmen, which means that government funds for the East often end up in the wrong pockets. To counteract this, we will appoint a state commissioner to supervise the fair distribution of funds in Prussia, and we will increase our control over the Prussian Central Cooperative Fund, a nominally independent credit union which has favoured especially highly-indebted Junkers in recent years. An end has to be put to the increasing indebtedness of large, inefficient estates, and funds need to reach the small-scale farmers that are truly in need."

 GER_SPD_invite_agrarians: "Invite the Agrarian Parties"

### Focuses ###

 GER_von_schleicher_cabinet: "Kabinett Schleicher"
 GER_von_schleicher_cabinet_desc: "No winner has come out from the Reichstag election of 1936, thus a Reichskanzler able to unify the Empire in the face of foreign aggression and domestic hardship alike is needed. That Reichskanzler is Kurt von Schleicher, former Prussian Minister of War - and he has a programme to save the yearning German masses."

 GER_arbeitsschlacht: "Die Arbeitsschlacht"
 GER_arbeitsschlacht_desc: "The first item on our agenda must be the needs of the people. Millions are on the streets and they are desperate for salvation - if the government does not create jobs for them, they will seek alternate, extreme solutions. Their employers have failed them, struggling with debt or awaiting better days. Thus, the State must do the heavy lifting, and create those jobs itself."

 GER_constructive_no_confidence: "Constructive No-Confidence Principle"
 GER_constructive_no_confidence_desc: "Before the fractured nature of the incumbent Reichstag sparks a flurry of no confidence votes, we must establish a principle with which any no-confidence vote must also propose an alternate candidate for the Reichskanzler seat. This way, we won't experience a situation in which Germany is left headless in a crucial moment."

 GER_renew_rathenauplan: "Renew the Rathenauplan"
 GER_renew_rathenauplan_desc: "The \"Neue Wirtschaft\" programme of Walther von Rathenau would be a massive change for the German economy, if implemented - it calls for a thorough planification and centralisation of economic life, through which the worst excesses of capitalism will be curtailed and full economic efficiency will be achieved. It is an extreme solution, but these are extreme times as well."

 GER_war_economic_offices: "Renew Operation of War Economic Offices"
 GER_war_economic_offices_desc: "During the Weltkrieg, the government established several offices, agencies and departments to give the state full control of its resources for war. Their experience can be brought forth once more, but for the reconstruction of the economy, rather than for wartime mobilisation."

 GER_reichsarbeitsamt: "Expand Power of Reichsarbeitsamt"
 GER_reichsarbeitsamt_desc: "The Reichsarbeitsamt was established at the end of the Weltkrieg to centralise all socio-political and labour duties of the state under a separate secretariat. In the current economic crisis, it can serve the Rathenauplan as a powerful labour planning agency as well. New agencies within it will handle temporary employment of workers in public works, career advice and the enforcement of collective agreements."

 GER_binnenwirtschaft: "Pursue Binnenwirtschaft"
 GER_binnenwirtschaft_desc: "Binnenwirtschaft, or \"inland economy\", is a key concept in Rathenau's programme. It posits the development of domestic industry to achieve autarky in industrial products, and the development of industries which rely on German manufacturing and goods from the beginning of the production process to the very end. Through efficiency and expansion, Germany can make itself immune to foreign shocks."

 GER_streamline_goods_production: "Streamline Goods Production"
 GER_streamline_goods_production_desc: "Rathenau envisions a society of perfect production efficiency, which wastes as little resources as possible on things like marketing, waste or competition. The state's economic authorities will enforce quality and production efficiency standards and advantage the most efficient industrial plants. State owned industries will serve as testing ranges for new industrial technology."

 GER_equality_of_opportunity: "Equality of Opportunity"
 GER_equality_of_opportunity_desc: "Because of poor circumstances of their birth or other inherent traits, many in German society are unable to apply their full potential. Being Jewish himself, Rathenau has personally expressed his dismay at these circumstances. The state must put all the effort it can to integrate all citizens into economic life and reform the education system to find the most skilled."

 GER_tarnow_baade_plan: "Draft Plan Tarnow-Baade"
 GER_tarnow_baade_plan_desc: "Fritz Tarnow and Fritz Baade are trade union leaders who initiated discussion on a social economic reform project not long after the Black Monday market crash, and publicly endorsed Schleicher's appointment with the hope that he will listen to their concerns. Their project involves vast state intervention to curtail the banking sector and create public works."

 GER_role_of_trade_unions: "Guarantee Leading Role of Trade Unions"
 GER_role_of_trade_unions_desc: "Economic recovery in Germany will only be fully achieved and benefit all classes if it is done with the support of German trade unions - socialist, liberal or Christian alike. We must involve trade union leadership in economic reform plans and create talks between the government, business representatives and trade unionists to listen to the concerns of everyone."

 GER_price_controls: "Establish Price Controls"
 GER_price_controls_desc: "One of the most unfortunate effects of the economic crisis is the breakdown of market prices - either too high, because of lacking supply, and punishing the people, or too low, because of lacking demand, and so punishing business. Through strategic taxation and financial investment, the state must intervene and bring order to the market."

 GER_public_works: "Massive Public Works"
 GER_public_works_desc: "Tarnow and Baade envision the expenditure of upwards of 2 billion Marks on public work programmes alone - until the economy recovers and can employ them again, millions of unemployed must receive temporary relief in the form of public works."

 GER_bank_controls: "Form the Staatliche Bankenaufsicht"
 GER_bank_controls_desc: "The reckless nature of the German banks led to the Black Monday collapse and shows that government oversight is necessary to prevent it from happening again. The Reichsbank must be curtailed as well, and cooperate more closely with the elected government."

 GER_state_credit: "Expand State-Provided Credit"
 GER_state_credit_desc: "The industrial sector can be moved out of its malaise by providing credit from the state. We will green-light the emission of more money and provide it to struggling businesses with very low interest, giving them the injection they need to get back on their feet and return to full production capacity."

 GER_debt_restructuring: "Negotiate Debt Restructuring"
 GER_debt_restructuring_desc: "State investments and economic recovery programmes inevitably come with a cost that someone needs to pay - which, so far, we have been able to cover with short and long term debts. This cannot last forever - we need to start negotiations with domestic and international lenders to delay payments and restructure our debt to prevent a fiscal crash."

 GER_nitrate_tobacco_monopoly: "State Monopoly on Nitrate and Tobacco"
 GER_nitrate_tobacco_monopoly_desc: "The economist Karl Helfferich has proposed establishing state monopolies on two lucrative consumer industries - nitrate mining and tobacco, which will bring much needed revenue to the budget. This proposal has also found support among the left and the far right."

 GER_slash_welfare: "Slash Welfare Funding"
 GER_slash_welfare_desc: "The German welfare system is relatively well funded, but in times of distress, we cannot dedicate as much funding to the system as we normally could. This solution is bound to be unpopular with the general population, however."

 GER_federal_income_taxes: "Establish Federal Income Taxes"
 GER_federal_income_taxes_desc: "The finances of the German Empire are relatively weak, as the government needs to rely upon the financing of the states to stay afloat, and can only levy indirect taxes and tariffs to collect revenue. It is about time to put an end to this weakness - if possible, we must push through a taxation reform in the legislature, and finally allow the Empire to collect direct income tax."
 GER_hjalmar_schacht_tt: "§YHjalmar Schacht§! will no longer be accessible as a Political Advisor."

 GER_inflation_weaponry: "Inflation Weaponry"
 GER_inflation_weaponry_desc: "An effective, if somewhat artificial and controversial method of increasing government revenue is simply printing more money - though this will cause inflation, it will also provide us with currency for economic recovery. Of course, as long as the trust in the German Mark remains."

 GER_labour_service: "Freiwilliger Arbeitsdienst"
 GER_labour_service_desc: "The first priority of the new government is to make sure that as few German citizens starve on the streets as possible. We shall establish a Voluntary Labour Service which will accept and feed the unemployed, employ them in menial, work-intensive labour across the Empire, and improve infrastructure while giving our unemployed a helping hand."
 GER_labour_service_tt: "Injecting capital into the economy with construction projects will aid in the recovery from the economic crisis!"

 GER_infrastructure_development: "Infrastructure Development"
 GER_infrastructure_development_desc: "As industries and services develop, the necessity for modern infrastructure connecting every single city becomes apparent. Civilian travel, modern supply systems, and, of course, movement of large armed forces all rely upon road and rail quality - which we shall foster with grand infrastructure projects."

 GER_mitteleuropa_trade: "Secure Mitteleuropa Trade Links"
 GER_mitteleuropa_trade_desc: "The worst thing that could happen to our economic situation is a shutdown of international trade - German industries which rely on export would instantly shut down and collapse as a result. We must foster and secure our trade links with the rest of Mitteleuropa, and renew trade within our trade bloc to keep our industries afloat."

 GER_job_creation_secretariat: "Sekretariat für Arbeitsbeschaffung"
 GER_job_creation_secretariat_desc: "The economic crisis has revealed that we cannot fully trust private enterprise to quickly re-employ millions of newly unemployed German workers. Here, the state must intervene to provide relief. We shall establish a Secretariat of Job Creation whose task will be to create and expand large public works. They will use as little machinery and as much manual labour as possible, and so will be able to provide for thousands in their hour of need."

 GER_cartelisation: "Organise Cartelisation of the Economy"
 GER_cartelisation_desc: "Black Monday has revealed how brittle companies in Germany are, unable to stay afloat independently and needlessly wasting resources on foolish competition. We must orchestrate the unification of key industrial sectors into massive industrial cartels, which will not only be able to endure financial hardship, but also can fulfil military contracts more easily."

 GER_automotive_industry: "Support German Car Manufacturers"
 GER_automotive_industry_desc: "Germany is the home of the modern car - and ever since Karl Benz and other pioneers, we have held a key share in the international car industry. The economic crisis threatens this sector, however - demand for cars is shrinking and numerous small manufacturers are going under. We must keep it alive with state support - after all, car factories can be quickly repurposed for wartime production."

 GER_imperial_self_sufficiency: "Pursue Imperial Self-Sufficiency"
 GER_imperial_self_sufficiency_desc: "In spite of our new world-spanning empire, our geographic position means that Russia and the Internationale may easily blockade us during the next war. This makes it necessary to make the German heartland at least somewhat self-sufficient in strategic resources - whether through substitute materials or through innovative technologies."

 GER_salzgitter_reichswerke: "Salzgitter Stahlwerke"
 GER_salzgitter_reichswerke_desc: "The large quantities of low grade iron ore near Salzgitter in Hanover have been known since the 14th century, but they were deemed uneconomical to smelt by the steel industry. Recent advancements in ore mining technology have cut this cost, and military needs make it crucial to achieve steel self-sufficiency. We shall establish a state-owned mining company in Salzgitter to make use of these resources."

 GER_kaiser_wilhelm_society: "Expand the Kaiser Wilhelm Society"
 GER_kaiser_wilhelm_society_desc: "The Kaiser Wilhelm Society for the Advancement of Science is the premier scientific institution in the German Empire, uniting hundreds of intellectuals and scientists in every single field. As we escalate the involvement of the state in economic affairs, we must not forget an equivalent focus towards state sponsored research and development - funding the K-W Society is a good start."

 GER_light_industry: "Support Imperial Light Industry"
 GER_light_industry_desc: "Germany is the manufacturing capital of Europe - and this does not mean just steel and guns. Light industries, such as the food industry, glass, wood working, and other utility goods, are centrepieces of our prosperity as well - the efforts of the state will rejuvenate these sectors and ensure that our status as an industrial hegemon remains unchallenged."

 GER_heavy_industry: "Vitalise Heavy Industry"
 GER_heavy_industry_desc: "Steel and guns are what first comes to mind to an average European when they hear of German industry - and it is a deserved reputation. The heavy industries of the German Empire have built up the prosperity of the Rhineland and outfitted the most powerful army in Europe - it is only fair that we return to this industry in kind."

 GER_price_control_secretariat: "Sekretariat für Preisüberwachung"
 GER_price_control_secretariat_desc: "The initial price control measures we implemented during the Black Monday crisis are good, but not enough, and run the risk of distorting the market. We shall appoint Carl Friedrich Goerdeler as the first Secretary of Price Controls, and create a secretariat which will handle the control of prices of consumer goods in the German market."

 GER_affordable_commodities: "Development of Affordable Commodities"
 GER_affordable_commodities_desc: "In spite of economic recovery, the standard of living of the average citizen remains staggered, as the common man simply cannot afford modern commodities. An outlandish proposal would be to establish vast state industries which would produce cheap, mass commodities at a depressed price, including apartments, household appliances and cars - but it just might work."

 GER_kamarilla: "The Man in the High Castle"
 GER_kamarilla_desc: "Parliamentarism, as beneficial as it is to appeasing the people, is prone to weakness and disarray. It needs to be organised and restrained to a system which will promote unity, rather than division. Reichskanzler Schleicher follows this vision, and, surrounded by a like-minded circle, he shall pursue the slow dismantlement of German democracy."

 GER_zentrum_unity: "Prod Zentrum to Enforce Party Discipline"
 GER_zentrum_unity_desc: "One of the largest parties in the German Empire, Zentrum is also heterogeneous, and thus has a history of enforcing party discipline in Reichstag votes to prevent splitting. This discipline can be used against Schleicher's opponents - by prodding Zentrum to maintain discipline, we can prevent them from aligning with an opposition coalition for some time."

 GER_zentrum_right: "Negotiate with Prussian Zentrum"
 GER_zentrum_right_desc: "The Zentrum faction in the Prussian House of Representatives is notably more reactionary than their peers, and their leader Franz von Papen is an acquaintance of Schleicher who can be bent to follow his goals. Through this inter-connection, the Reichskanzler may come to good terms with all of the Zentrum Right, and convince them to stay loyal."

 GER_querverbindung: "Querverbindung"
 GER_querverbindung_desc: "Querverbindung (\"inter-connection\") is Schleicher's tactic for subjugating the Reichstag and putting it under control. A schemer who relies on personal connections with party and union leaders to push his agenda, Schleicher operates under a simple principle - parties are abstract units of power, and a combination of some of them can always be found to further his goals."

 GER_spd_prussia: "SPD in Wilhelmstraße 63"
 GER_spd_prussia_desc: "Since Black Monday, the cabinet in Prussia has grown unstable, and one solution to this disorder is to rely on the left. A coalition between SPD, LVP, the Poles and some defectors could be stable, and though such a coalition leading Prussia is a terror to any Prussian aristocrat, it will also keep the Social Democrats satisfied, for now."

 GER_shuffle_prussian_ministries: "Shuffle Prussian Ministries"
 GER_shuffle_prussian_ministries_desc: "Since Black Monday, the cabinet in Prussia has grown unstable and one solution to this disorder is to rely on the right. By giving additional ministries in Prussia to the DVLP, they may become more loyal to the incumbent cabinet, and so give it a backbone to resist attempts to vote it out of power. It will also keep the Nationalists satisfied, for now."

 GER_ferment_dvlp_split: "Foment a DVLP Split"
 GER_ferment_dvlp_split_desc: "The DVLP, though united on the surface, is actually deeply divided between Hassell's national revolutionaries and Hugenberg's reactionaries. Deepening this rift through strategic appointments from one faction or another and personal contacts may finally rip that party apart, and turn it completely powerless to stop Schleicher's dictatorship."

 GER_thyssen_pact: "Schleicher-Thyssen Pact"
 GER_thyssen_pact_desc: "Fritz Thyssen is an infamous industrialist and political power broker who can connect Schleicher with influential business circles and get him to earn their approval. His vision is the only defence the Empire has from syndicalism, after all, and the interests of capital ultimately align with his."

 GER_propaganda_machine: "Construct the Propaganda Machine"
 GER_propaganda_machine_desc: "Through bombastic campaigns and the manipulation of truth, both the Reichstag and the populace can be molded exactly the way the Reichskanzler wants. The vast propaganda campaigns of the Weltkrieg give us the example of how we can string enough representatives into supporting a leader who will restore the Empire's strength and defend it from syndicalism."

 GER_guarantee_of_liberties: "Verbal Guarantee of Democratic Liberties"
 GER_guarantee_of_liberties_desc: "As more and more power is consolidated in Schleicher's hands, the SPD titans need to be appeased, and though their party is too consolidated to just split into irrelevancy, their chant for moderation will be their undoing. A guarantee that the Reichskanzler will maintain democratic liberties and will surrender any additional powers after the crisis will keep them at bay for some time."

 GER_ruhrkampf: "Escalate Ruhrkampf Suppression"
 GER_ruhrkampf_desc: "Though the thousands of workers fooled by socialist subversives may have legitimate grievances, their struggle for rights must take place in the legislative arena, not in the form of violent street clashes. We must mobilise our forces and suppress the Rhenish general strike, swiftly."

 GER_reward_loyal_unions: "Reward Loyal Trade Unions"
 GER_reward_loyal_unions_desc: "We must employ the carrot as well as the stick. The trade unions which refused to join the general strike and ordered their members to continue working will be rewarded with state support and additional benefits to their members. This will make the rest of the unionised workforce more interested in dialogue than action."

 GER_you_are_going_to_france: "Deport Ringleaders to the Commune"
 GER_you_are_going_to_france_desc: "The aggressive ringleaders of the General Strike, those who aren't prominent enough to be arrested, shall be removed from political life by deporting them to the Communards - they will be brought to the Alsatian border and stripped of their citizenship. May they rot in Paris and its bland worker blocks."

 # schleicher tree

 GER_red_general: "Regime of the Red General"
 GER_red_general_desc: "The first year of Kurt von Schleicher's chancellorship has shown that a strong hand is necessary to navigate Germany in today's troubles - the Red General provides it. With the Enabling Act in one hand and a clique of loyalists in another, he will reshape and transform German society, forging a New State which can overcome these adversities."

 GER_gewerkschaftsbund: "Establish the Gewerkschaftsbund"
 GER_gewerkschaftsbund_desc: "We must foster the relationship between the state and labour through a national Trade Union Confederation. Lothar Erdmann, a trade unionist loyal to Schleicher, shall chair this association of all loyal trade unions in the country - and we shall break apart the unions which do not cooperate."

 GER_railway_nationalisation: "Nationalise the Railways"
 GER_railway_nationalisation_desc: "Ever since the unification of Germany, the railways of the Empire have been divided between several railroad companies controlled by the states, fostering inefficiency and internal competition. In the name of national interest, we shall put an end to this division - all railway companies will be united into one Deutsche Reichsbahn."

 GER_autarky_doctrine: "Doctrine of National Autarky"
 GER_autarky_doctrine_desc: "The economic policy of Schleicher's regime calls for domestic economic development through cooperation between state and large business. The state must direct the economy, navigate it towards the interests of national defence and the populace, achieve independence from foreign imports, and ensure harmonious development."

 GER_mandatory_union_membership: "Mandatory Union Membership"
 GER_mandatory_union_membership_desc: "To control the German proletariat, we shall require every enterprise with a large enough number of workers to have a cell of the Gewerkschaftsbund. Workers will be required to join our state owned trade union, receive patriotic education through their institutions, have loyalty instilled - and receive benefits, such as vacations."

 GER_wehrsport: "Wehrsportorganisation"
 GER_wehrsport_desc: "Germany was forged by war, became a great power through war, and must never forget war. Slowly, we shall foster a new German militarism — our tool for this goal is the Wehrsport, \"Military Sport\", a state owned paramilitary organisation which will rally the German youth to participate in sports, military training, patriotic rallies, and give them a sense of purpose."

 GER_military_oversight: "Military Oversight of State Governments"
 GER_military_oversight_desc: "As the social guide of the Empire, the Army must have a greater say in political affairs. We shall establish a policy of Heer liaisons in all member states of the German Empire - these liaisons will cooperate with state governments to represent our interests and nudge those governments towards a more cooperative direction."

 GER_oaths_of_loyalty: "Bureaucrat Oaths of Loyalty"
 GER_oaths_of_loyalty_desc: "We shall require all members of the state bureaucracy to give an oath of loyalty to the Empire, the Kaiser and the Government upon employment - and we will remind them of this oath whenever the bureaucracy tries to resist our actions."

 GER_national_unity_front: "Establish the National Unity Front"
 GER_national_unity_front_desc: "The Reichskanzler is followed by a growing clique of loyalists, but so far, they remain merely a clique. It is time to transform this following into a political movement - a front of unity which is intended to supersede any partisanship and establish unity in the Reichstag."

 GER_nationalise_prussian_secret_police: "Nationalise the Prussian Secret Police"
 GER_nationalise_prussian_secret_police_desc: "The Preußische Geheimpolizei has long been infamous among the socialists and national traitors as a powerful weapon in the disposal of the Kingdom - however, the entire Empire needs their service. We shall get the Prussian police agencies into one organisation controlled by the central government and put it to use to establish order."

 GER_mobilisation_of_the_masses: "Mobilisation of the Masses"
 GER_mobilisation_of_the_masses_desc: "We must constantly foster our outreach to the masses and establish public organisations which involve as many citizens as possible - state owned youth societies, sports clubs, labour services, unions and party chapters. Our regime must permeate everyday life, and the people must rally behind us to give us an invincible foundation."

 GER_national_revolution: "Proclaim a National Revolution"
 GER_national_revolution_desc: "Slowly, but surely, the Reichskanzler and his clique coordinate all of Germany to their centralising course. We can loosen our mask more and more, and make it clear - Schleicher has led Germany towards a National Revolution! A transformation which will renew German vitality, unity and strength, and give the yearning masses a sense of purpose which parliamentarism never will."

 GER_diminish_reichstag: "Break Down the Rules of Legislation"
 GER_diminish_reichstag_desc: "We cannot move against the Reichstag easily, yet, but we have tricks to keep it under control. Nudging and amending the rules of the Reichstag, making it more difficult for the opposition to speak, easier for the government to push through laws, and limiting parliamentary debate to the minimum - it all adds up, creating parliamentarism without democracy."

 GER_corporatist_bundesrat: "Towards Corporatist Representation"
 GER_corporatist_bundesrat_desc: "To keep the Reichstag curtailed and foster our dream of a corporatist New State, we must consider the formation of a new parliamentary body - a council of interests from associations, unions and corporations to represent national interest. It will be an advisory body for now, but we can consider some more... revolutionary changes after the war."

 GER_reichland_losung: "Reichsland-Lösung"
 GER_reichland_losung_desc: "The final block in our centralisation programme will be the mediatisation of Prussia - the independent Prussian government will be abolished and its territory will fall under the direct control of the central government. Harnessing all of the Prussian resources in our direct disposal will be an unprecedented rise in Imperial power - and it will make the New State irresistible."

 # Wehrstaat foci

 GER_national_defence_state: "The National Defence State"
 GER_national_defence_state_desc: "The totalitarian regimes that are forming among our syndicalist opponents are an inspiration to follow - not ideologically, but because of how well they can mobilise such potential without any restraint. Let us use their weapons against them, and begin the construction of a Wehrstaat - a state by and for the Imperial German Army."
 GER_national_defence_state_tt: "Either §Y[FRA.GetNameWithFlag]§!, §Y[ENG.GetNameWithFlag]§! or §Y[RUS.GetNameWithFlag]§! exist and their current ruling party is §YTotalist§!\n\n"

 GER_war_industry_nationalisation: "Nationalisation of Critical War Industries"
 GER_war_industry_nationalisation_desc: "Only the State should hold possession of critical military industries, and so set its own standards and quotas, unrestrained by the so-called free market. While we will not abolish capitalism, we must abandon its principles when it comes to the defence industry - national necessity will drive its production, not greed."

 GER_no_idle_resources: "No Resources Left Idle"
 GER_no_idle_resources_desc: "We must drastically escalate the size of our resource gathering operations, grant financing to new resource exploitation across the Empire and place less profitable mines under state control to keep them operating. We must achieve self sufficiency in resources necessary for the war effort - especially coal and steel."

 GER_mobilisation_protocols: "Mobilisation Protocols"
 GER_mobilisation_protocols_desc: "We must establish a larger military reserve and form protocols on the mobilisation of this reserve into the army at a hastened timeframe, allowing us to fill the ranks of the Heer with a greater number of men and quickly."

 GER_society_control: "Sammlungspolitik"
 GER_society_control_desc: "All political parties in the Empire must bow to the will of the military and unanimously accept certain policies on economic and military mobilisation, without question. The ideal National Defence State should be entirely apolitical, concerned only with how to win wars fast and efficiently - and achieve total destruction of our enemies."

 GER_propaganda_campaigns: "Reactivate Propaganda Operations"
 GER_propaganda_campaigns_desc: "We must reinvigorate national pride and loyalty with greater and greater propaganda drives. Much like before the beginning of the Weltkrieg, the German people must be prepared to go to war, follow the lead of the prideful Heer, and learn to hate our eternal enemies."

 # Schwarz-Weiß-Rot path

 GER_conservative_revolution: "Die Konservative Revolution"
 GER_conservative_revolution_desc: "For over a decade, Germany has not had a proper conservative Reichskanzler, and if you consider that Posadowsky was short-lived, then this gap of decadence lengthens for two more decades. No more - this charade comes to an end, and we shall reshape the Empire according to the vision of proper German patriots in a grand Conservative Revolution."

 GER_anti_socialist_laws: "Renew the Anti-Socialist Laws"
 GER_anti_socialist_laws_desc: "Bismarck's Anti-Socialist Laws may have been unsuccessful, but their spirit remains - Social Democracy must cease poisoning the minds and thoughts of millions of German citizens. We will learn from the failures of our predecessors and uproot the strength of socialism among the working class, bringing a cease to pointless class struggle."

 GER_prussia_privy_council: "Restore the Privy Civil Cabinet"
 GER_prussia_privy_council_desc: "In 1920, the reformers abolished the Imperial Privy Council system, subordinating the Kaiser's advisors to offices controlled by the civilian government. This mistake must not stand. The Privy Civil Cabinet, which advises the Kaiser and handles his communications with the cabinet and state governments, must be restored - and staffed with good, patriotic conservatives."

 GER_engine_of_conservative_revolution: "Engine of the Conservative Revolution"
 GER_engine_of_conservative_revolution_desc: "Our Reichskanzler, though above the squabbling of the coalition, has a vision of his own — he will promulgate a \"Statute on the Regulation of Labour Deployment\", which will forbid the migration of labour, specifically from East Elbia, if not favoured by the government; and a programme of state grants to Junker estates, the Osthilfe, which will aim to improve working conditions and fund cultural activities in local communities."

 GER_suum_cuique: "Suum Cuique"
 GER_suum_cuique_desc: "Kleist's next step in his vision of a restored traditional order of community in the countryside will be support to rural charity organisations, churches, temperance movements, and pastor education. Suum Cuique, \"to each what he deserves\", will be the creed of the new Germany - every member of society is a part of his estate as ordained by God, and must accept their role in the idyllic rural community, for the betterment of all."

 GER_state_monopoly_on_agricultural_trade: "State Monopoly on Agricultural Trade"
 GER_state_monopoly_on_agricultural_trade_desc: "Protectionism has been pursued by German agrarian organisations since the 1890s - it is time we finally made it reality. We shall take control of the agricultural trade and use it to restrict the import of foreign cereals into the Mitteleuropa market, and guarantee minimum prices for domestically produced cereals."

 GER_support_agrarian_organisations: "United Front of the German Peasantry"
 GER_support_agrarian_organisations_desc: "The weakness of the agrarian interest groups lies in their division along ideological, class and confessional lines - through negotiation and force alike, we must unify these disparate groups into one Green Front that can effectively fight for the interests of the forgotten small landholders and large landowners alike."

 GER_curtail_banking_system: "Curtail the Banking System"
 GER_curtail_banking_system_desc: "The banking system, controlled by urbanites and especially Jews, neither of whom understand the plights of the ethnic German farmer, has drained the life of the countryside for many years. We must establish stricter controls for banks, offer bailouts to indebted farmers, and abolish grain futures trading."

 GER_agricultural_cooperatives: "Promote Agrarian Cooperative Banking"
 GER_agricultural_cooperatives_desc: "The cooperative banking system which sprung up in the German countryside in the 19th century, named the Raiffeisen banks after its founder Friedrich Wilhelm Raiffeisen, is the largest cooperative association in the world. It offers a local, reliable and patriotic alternative to urban banks that we must promote and support in the future."

 GER_proclaim_new_conservatism: "New German Conservatism"
 GER_proclaim_new_conservatism_desc: "The years after the war were not kind to the Conservative Party - yet, we have regained our bearings and found a new platform to rally the farmers and the upper class behind. Our new conservatism will accept the fundamental, now unquestionable tenets of the parliamentary system, and work within it to defend tradition, patriotism and the rights of the states."

 GER_cartel_of_productive_estates: "Restore the Cartel of Productive Estates" # Kartell des schaffenden Stände
 GER_cartel_of_productive_estates_desc: "The Cartel of Productive Estates was established by agricultural, industry and middle class representatives in 1913 to stop the growth of Social Democracy and work towards a stable traditional society where all attempts at liberalisation are neutered. Such an alliance of friendly interest groups will be crucial in our goal of unifying the state, if restored."

 GER_prussia_suffrage: "Enshrine the Prussian Plural Vote"
 GER_prussia_suffrage_desc: "In 1918, we surrendered to the pressure of the progressives and accepted the end of the three-class voting system in Prussia - yet, they've now begun to push for outright universal suffrage in the state, an unacceptable step forward. We must turn plural suffrage in Prussia into a constitutional amendment and thus prevent it from ever being abolished."

 GER_reichstag_cooperation: "Expand Cross-Partisan Cooperation"
 GER_reichstag_cooperation_desc: "Though abused by socialist and liberal ventures, the Reichstag is not inherently a terrible institution, and the moderate parties represented there such as the Liberals and Catholics can find common ground with us on certain points. Let us keep our options open, and hear our our compatriots across the aisle for the betterment of the nation."

 GER_prussian_cooperation: "New Prussian-Imperial Partnership"
 GER_prussian_cooperation_desc: "Our opponents do not shy away from their centralising goals, putting forth projects which will abolish the Prussian kingdom and replace it with iron-fisted federal rule - our vision is different. The autonomous Prussian government will be retained and their partnership will be restored, putting an end to the interwar squabble between these two regimes."

 GER_carrot_and_stick_federalism: "Carrot-and-Stick Federalism"
 GER_carrot_and_stick_federalism_desc: "Our coalition is the only political force which defends the rights and autonomy of the Imperial states - and we must harness this to our advantage. States which cooperate with us and form conservative governments will receive greater support from above and increased funding from the central government, while Socialist governments will be left in the dirt."

 GER_people_conservatism: "Foster Volkskonservatismus"
 GER_people_conservatism_desc: "The \"Popular Conservatives\" are a prominent faction within the DkP which seeks to transform the party into a constitutional, moderate conservative party, accepting of the parliamentary system and defending tradition from within - much like the British Conservatives. Fostering the growth of this faction will turn the Conservative Revolution towards a nominally democratic course."

 GER_organic_statehood: "Organic Statehood"
 GER_organic_statehood_desc: "Western liberalism does not fit German society. Instead, the ideologues of the DVLP pursue the ideals of the great Prussian reformer Heinrich Friedrich Karl vom und zum Stein - an Organic State, a meritocratic authoritarian regime founded upon the civil service, in which citizens are encouraged to participate via rising the ranks of local administration, rather than via corrupt electoralism."

 GER_reform_catholicism: "Promote National Catholicism"
 GER_reform_catholicism_desc: "The Conservative Revolution cannot be solely a project of the Protestant population - we must constantly expand our outreach to the Catholic community. Instead of fighting for their narrow interests, they must accept the German state and collaborate between religious lines towards the common goal of Volksgemeinschaft."

 GER_corporate_state_council: "Establish the Staatsrat"
 GER_corporate_state_council_desc: "The Staatsrat is envisioned as a national representation of government ministers, administrators and civil servants which will one day replace the Reichstag and concentrate all power in a narrow council of the most educated and deserving to lead. For now, it will merely be an advisory council, serving as a blueprint for the future."

 GER_vanquish_parliamentarism: "Vanquish Decadent Democracy"
 GER_vanquish_parliamentarism_desc: "With every move, we must take the fight to the cancer of democracy which saps the life of the German nation. We must break down the rules of procedure in the Reichstag and use all political finesse available to reduce its capacity to act, instead concentrating more and more power in the cabinet, the civil service, and the local institutions."

 GER_eastern_settlement: "Expand Eastern Colonisation"
 GER_eastern_settlement_desc: "Set up in 1886, the Prussian Settlement Commission has long been the arm of Germanness in its struggle to consolidate its grip over the East Elbian lands. Yet, the Poles of Posen and West Prussia have neutered its accomplishments by working together to retain their land rights and push back against settlement. Greater state support for the Commission will turn the tide once more."

 GER_clash_of_civilisations: "The Clash of Civilisations"
 GER_clash_of_civilisations_desc: "Germany holds a unique role in the history of Europe - in a clash for survival between continents, it is Europe's beating heart and natural leader, the future leader of Großeuropa, an anti-American and anti-Asian bloc. It must completely reshape the face of Europe and become an invincible empire that can defend Christianity, nationality, and tradition."
 GER_mountain_republic_clash_of_civilisations_tt: "If we take this focus and accept Russia's offer of conditional peace, we will be able to gain the §YMountain Republic§! from the peace terms."

 GER_abolish_universal_suffrage: "Abolish Universal Suffrage"
 GER_abolish_universal_suffrage_desc: "Parliamentarism and universal suffrage are both sickening polyps that pave the way for liberal, syndicalist, anti-German intrigues - however, we cannot abolish them both, as the furor would surely bring the monarchy to kneel. If we have to choose, we shall restrict the right to vote - once the Reichstag is composed only of intellectual patriotic loyal men elected via plural suffrage, we have nothing to fear from parliamentarism."

 GER_national_social_principle: "National-Social Principle"
 GER_national_social_principle_desc: "Our economic vision is the creation of Volksgemeinschaft - a people's community, where petty class and social divisions are set aside in the name of common labour for the national good. Workers and business owners must work together and make concessions towards one another, for the nation as well as for society."

 GER_league_for_national_economics: "BfNuW"
 GER_league_for_national_economics_desc: "The League for the National Economy and Labour Community (Bund für Nationalwirtschaft und Werkgemeinschaft) shall be an association of nationalist small and medium businesses aligned with the DVLP. It will fight against international monopolies and pervasive Jewish capital, in the name of a national economy by and for the German ethnos."

 GER_patriotic_workers_association: "Agro-Political Apparatus"
 GER_patriotic_workers_association_desc: "The old hands-off policy towards the agricultural sector no longer works and the Junkers can no longer be trusted - we must rapidly build up a food administration which will plan and control agricultural production. The various agricultural organisations must be integrated into the state apparatus and any conflicts betwene them quelled."

 GER_victory_of_democracy: "The Victory of Democracy"
 GER_victory_of_democracy_desc: "Even when faced against Schleicher's machinations and the reactionary plot of the Schwarz-Weiß-Rot Coalition, we prevailed, and a truly democratic coalition cabinet has been appointed. Our ambitions are vast, and as long as we remain together against all differences and keep an eye on the inevitable conspiracies of the reactionaries, we should change the face of the Empire forever."

 GER_interfaction_committee: "Restore the Interfaction Committee"
 GER_interfaction_committee_desc: "The Interfaction Committee was originally established in 1917 to coordinate the actions of the reformist parties during the last years of the Weltkrieg, and ultimately led to the promulgation of the March Constitution. The situation calls for us to reestablish it - a permanent committee of representatives from all coalition members will help find the necessary compromises."

 GER_lvp_demands: "LVP: Endorse Progressive Capitalism"
 GER_lvp_demands_desc: "Supportive of the free market and endorsed by business, the LVP desires us to moderate on our aggressive rhetoric and endorse the nullification of the negative effects of capitalism through social reform and cooperation. Business and state working together in the name of progress can ensure the prosperity of the common man."

 GER_lvp_demands_2: "LVP: Reject Private Education"
 GER_lvp_demands_2_desc: "An important point in the LVP's plank calls for a stronger and wider public education system, at the expense of private schools, to grow a new generation of intellectals with democratic values. We must adopt this demand as our own."

 GER_lvp_demands_3: "LVP: Enhance Jewish Protections"
 GER_lvp_demands_3_desc: "The LVP desires us to expand protections for the German Jewish community, their loyal supporters and loyal citizens of the German state, against discrimination in employment, the workplace, and trades."

 GER_lvp_demands_4: "LVP: Abolish the Wealth Tax"
 GER_lvp_demands_4_desc: "The LVP are highly critical towards the wealth tax, one of Germany's few federal taxes, and demand its abolition in order to reduce the burden upon the wealthy and the business owners."

 GER_lvp_demands_5: "LVP: Abandon Nationalisation Plans"
 GER_lvp_demands_5_desc: "The LVP are highly concerned with the Wissell Plan, which would require the state management or even nationalisation of large industries in the name of the common good. They demand that this plan is shelved and no large scale reorganisation of the economy takes place in the foreseeable future."

 GER_lvp_demands_finished: "LVP: All Demands Fulfilled"
 GER_lvp_demands_finished_desc: "We have fulfilled all of the LVP's demands.

 GER_z_demands_desc: "Zentrum, being a Catholic party first and foremost, wishes for us to tend to the interests of their constituents - we should strengthen the legal protections for Catholic schools and allow the state governments in Catholic states to establish more of them."

 GER_z_demands_2: "Z: Protect Small Business"
 GER_z_demands_2_desc: "Though Zentrum is heterodox on economic matters, the interests of small and medium business are close to their heart - and so they wish for us to protect these companies by reducing business taxes and increasing pressure on large trusts and business cartels."

 GER_z_demands_3: "Z: Infrastructure in Catholic States"

 GER_z_demands_4_desc: "Owing to its large size, Zentrum expects to hold a large share of the cabinet, and now they demand to be transferred the Interior Office, one of the most important offices in the cabinet. Johannes Bell is their Secretary of the Interior of choice - an experienced and capable jurist."

 GER_z_demands_5: "Z: Prevent Liberalisation of Women's Rights"
 GER_z_demands_5_desc: "Zentrum is highly concerned with our party's official policy of expanding women's rights - abortion, employment and financial independence.

 GER_pp_demands_2_desc: "The Polish representatives in the Minority Bloc demand us to restrict the xenophobic and nationalist German Eastern Marches Society, also known as the Hakata or Ostmarkenverein - their close proximity to the far right makes it an enemy to both us and the minority officials."

 GER_left_spd_demands_2: "Left-SPD: Expropriation of Estates"

 GER_left_spd_demands_3: "Left-SPD: Oppose Concessions"
 GER_left_spd_demands_3_desc: "Our left wing is frustrated with the concessions we have been making to our coalition partners recently - though they understand the necessity for maintaining a united centre-left coalition, they believe that we are debasing our electoral promises by surrendering too much for our allies. If we want to appease them, we should put an end to these concessions for some time."

 GER_left_spd_demands_4: "Left-SPD: A Socialist Secretary"
 GER_left_spd_demands_4_desc: "Our left believes that they should be represented in the cabinet.

 GER_left_spd_demands_5_desc: "Our left is highly concerned with the revisionist tendencies in the party which call for us to abandon the references to Marxism in our party programme.

 GER_equality_of_sexes_desc: "The SPD has long vowed to achieve legal equality between men and women, and we have a lot to push even beyond the obvious struggle for women's suffrage. We must legalise abortion in cases of grave danger to the mother's life and provide free access to contraception, and we must strive for equality of opportunity in employment to public institutions."

 GER_nationalise_rail: "Deutsche Reichsbahn"
 GER_nationalise_rail_desc: "For decades, the railways in the Empire have been divided between several state-owned corporations, each one retaining operational independence, which leaves the transportation system inefficient and raises costs of travel to the common man. It appears a full nationalisation of the railways is the only solution - we shall establish the Deutsche Reichsbahn and integrate all state rails into this institution."

 GER_cartel_busting: "Cartel Busting"
 GER_cartel_busting_desc: "Though we recognise the efficiency of cartelised business organisation, some of them have simply become too large, too influential and too reactionary, especially in the coal and steel industry. We need to begin applying restrictive measures and foster competitors less hostile to our interests."

 GER_nationalise_coal: "The Wissell Plan"
 GER_nationalise_coal_desc: "The idea of the \"socialisation of industry\", a process through which entire industries are subjugated in the service of Gemeinwirtschaft, has been championed by Rudolf Wissell and Wichard von Moellendorff since 1920. A radical proposal of unprecedented state control of the economy, it is nonetheless interesting enough to be considered by the Coalition - after all, the coal barons of the Ruhr are a serious threat to us..."

 GER_cartel_cooperation: "Cooperation with the Cartels"
 GER_cartel_cooperation_desc: "We recognise the efficiency of business cartels - instead of wasting resources on competition, they put all resources they can to improving production and efficiency. Some of their leaders may be hostile to us, sure, but it's nothing we can't resolve through simply talking things out."

 GER_privatisation: "Limited Privatisation"

 GER_municipal_socialism_desc: "Sometimes, the greatest improvements to the lives of the people come not from federal laws, but from the work of local governments who understand the needs of their people.

 GER_social_housing: "Social Housing Programmes"
 GER_social_housing_desc: "For decades, Germany has been gripped by a housing shortage, which leaves thousands packed in poor quality homes and raises the cost of living to unprecedented heights.

 GER_restrict_protective_custody: "Restrict Protective Custody in Prussia"
 GER_restrict_protective_custody_desc: "Protective custody was introduced into Prussian law in 1848 to allow Prussian police to detain individuals who had not committed any crimes - indefinitely, and without judicial control.

 GER_labour_court: "Arbeitsgericht"
 GER_labour_court_desc: "To ensure just and steady arbitration of labour conflicts and handle other issues regarding labour law, we will establish a Labour Court with nationwide jurisdiction. The presence of a final authority on labour questions will, hopefully, help prevent a second Ruhrkampf by allowing us to address the grievances of the workers through legal channels."

 GER_constitutional_committee: "Constitutional Review Committee"
 GER_constitutional_committee_desc: "We will not be content with simply being handed the reins of government. We must leave our mark on history by pursuing constitutional reform, even more grand than what was achieved in 1920, and finally transform the Empire into a parliamentary monarchy. A committee of Members of Reichstag and legal experts will be tasked with drafting reforms to the Constitution."

 GER_full_parliamentarisation: "Full Parliamentarisation of the Cabinet"
 GER_full_parliamentarisation_desc: "Though we may differ in our vision of the future, there is one thing we can all agree on - the Reichstag should be the final authority on all matters of governance, not the Kaiser. The reformed Constitution must grant the power of recommending Reichskanzlers, approving Reichskanzlers, and approving Secretaries to the hands of parliament - without it, we can't claim to have achieved any reforms at all."

 GER_prussia_equal_suffrage: "Pursue Equal Suffrage in Prussia"
 GER_prussia_equal_suffrage_desc: "In 1919, we achieved a compromise in the Prussian House of Representatives, abolishing the three-class voting system and replacing it with a plural voting system. Though it is considerably fairer, it is still not enough - and now that we have broken the conservative resistance in Prussia, we must finish what we started."

 GER_women_suffrage: "Women's Suffrage"
 GER_women_suffrage_desc: "Since the 1900s, the women's suffrage movement in Germany has struggled against the indifference of conservative society and sought to grant millions of German women the right to vote. This injustice will be corrected, and the amended Constitution will specify that all citizens, no matter their sex, have the right to vote."

 GER_proportional_representation: "Proportional Representation"
 GER_proportional_representation_desc: "In 1920, we made the first step away from the old and unjust constituency-based electoral system by introducing multi-member constituencies in major cities. Now, however, we have the opportunity to finish the job. The perfect representation of the multitude of interests through proportional representation will guarantee truly responsive governance."

 GER_direct_legislation: "Direct Legislation"
 GER_direct_legislation_desc: "For too long, the people have been forced to express their interests solely through the unreliable whims of elected representatives. It is time to improve our democracy by granting our people a new tool to shape the direction of the Empire with - petitions and referenda."

 GER_fundamental_rights: "Restore the \"Fundamental Rights\""
 GER_fundamental_rights_desc: "The Frankfurt Assembly of 1848 promulgated the Fundamental Rights of the German People, which may never be violated no matter who takes power - this includes equality before the law, freedom of expression, freedom of the press, freedom of association and habeas corpus. Let us include a modernised version of this document in our Constitution and strengthen our democratic foundations."

 GER_abolish_death_penalty: "Abolish the Death Penalty"
 GER_abolish_death_penalty_desc: "Capital punishment is increasingly seen as a barbaric practice incompatible with modern ethics - and the SPD has called for its abolition for decades. Now that we are in position to do so, let us put the guillotines and the shooting squads away, and create a system which focuses on rehabilitation of all but the worst criminals."

 GER_administrative_court: "Establish the Imperial Administrative Court"
 GER_administrative_court_desc: "The justice system of the German Empire remains decentralised and there is no administrative court with nationwide jurisdiction - let us untangle the complicated enforcement of law in the Empire and enforce a nationwide system of courts, with an Imperial Administrative Court (Reichsverwaltungsgericht) as the supreme authority on all non-constitutional matters."

 GER_uniform_municipal_law: "Uniform Municipal Law"
 GER_uniform_municipal_law_desc: "Our new Constitution should include an Imperial Municipalities Law which will establish uniform powers, duties and rights of municipal authorities across the entire Empire.

 GER_federal_police: "Federalisation of Police"
 GER_federal_police_desc: "Each state of the German Empire operates its own police, although they often cooperate, especially under Prussian overlordship.

For that, he has drafted a plan for an interest free loan to the US which will aid their economic recovery and curtail socialist growth." # Interest free loan to US

 GER_german_american_self_defence: "German-American Self Defence Associations"
 GER_german_american_self_defence_desc: "It appears that civil war in the United States is inevitable. Our last resort is to make sure that the socialists are suppressed by military force - through our contacts in German-American organisations, we can foster the formation of Loyalist self-defence militias which will rise up for the anti-socialist forces in the civil war."

 GER_new_world_activities_organisation: "Department for New World Operations" # when the acw actually begins
 GER_new_world_activities_organisation_desc: "The beginning of the American Civil War means the end of the Monroe Doctrine for the foreseeable future - which opens all of Central and South America to direct intervention from European powers.

 GER_central_asia_missions_desc: "The Central Asian statelets broke free in the Russian Civil War and have survived for two decades - but their independence is threatened by a resurgent Russia.

 GER_buying_time_with_spies_desc: "Our foreign intelligence service, Abteilung IIIb, is already aware that the next great European war is inevitable. That does not mean it has to come soon, however.

 GER_treaty_of_munchen_desc: "The Mitteleuropa organisation has become more democratic and more prosperous as a result. Let us apply this experience to the world stage - call a summit of the world's nations and establish an international forum for peace and unity, the Union of Nations."

 GER_officialise_cession_of_sovereignty: "Officialise Cession of Sovereignty"
 GER_officialise_cession_of_sovereignty_desc: "It is over. After years of reform, Mitteleuropa has become centralised and consolidated under our benevolent leadership. It is time to put an end to this facade and give Mitteleuropa - and, by extension, us - veto power over member governments, officially transforming them into our subjects."

 GER_france_invaded: "The Syndicalist Blow"
 GER_france_invaded_desc: "The Communards have struck! Millions of French troops are mobilising beyond our border and will not stop at anything but the complete destruction of the German nation and our way of life! The British and the Russians will not be far behind. This is the final struggle for the fate of Europe, and we must achieve victory at any cost!"

 GER_invade_france: "Operation: Scharnhorst"
 GER_invade_france_desc: "Now that our domestic situation has stabilised, we can turn our attention to our Western border. The machinations of the French Communards to topple peace in Europe are well known - if we strike them as a preventive measure, we can ensure that this conflict does not escalate to a second world war."

 GER_combat_defeatism: "Combat Defeatism"
 GER_combat_defeatism_desc: "The war has caught the German nation unprepared, and many, sapped by years of economic downturn and political squabble, are uncertain whether we will be able to endure a joint syndicalist and Russian attack. Such defeatism must be squashed immediately, and the patriotic spirit of all Germans uplifted. Together for victory!"

 GER_riefenstahl: "The Talents of Riefenstahl"
 GER_riefenstahl_desc: "Leni Riefenstahl, one of the most talented filmmakers of our age, has recently volunteered to shoot propaganda films for the Imperial Army - an incredible deal. Her awe-inspiring pieces will display the power of the Army and the glory of the Kaiser, and teach the people that they have nothing to fear."

 GER_notabitur: "Restore the Notabitur System"
 GER_notabitur_desc: "A Notabitur is a high school diploma received after a hastened and easier final exam to allow students in the last year of high school to volunteer for the Army in times of war. We must reinstate this system to give our youth a chance to serve their country without impeding their academic goals."

 GER_anti_sedition_laws: "Anti-Sedition Laws"
 GER_anti_sedition_laws_desc: "We must once again impose Siege Law and begin a crackdown on the fifth column residing in our country - the syndicalists and radical socialists who will surely sabotage the war effort to aid Paris' victory. They will receive prison and, in extreme cases, the bullet."

 GER_prevent_turnip_winter: "Prevent Turnip Winters"
 GER_prevent_turnip_winter_desc: "The wartime blockade depleted our food stocks during the first Weltkrieg and led to widespread hunger which nearly crippled the faith of our people by the end of the war. We must prevent this from happening again by expanding food stockpiles, fighting profiteering and investing in substitute foods."

 GER_dissolve_socialists: "Dissolve Socialist Organisations"
 GER_dissolve_socialists_desc: "The war gives us a chance to cripple both socialism and our perennial Social Democratic opponents. Pacifist, socialist and social democratic organisations will be disbanded due to the threat they pose to wartime unity, and the most vocal ring leaders will be detained indefinitely."

 GER_wartime_mobilisation: "Wartime Mobilisation"
 GER_wartime_mobilisation_desc: "The sleeping giant must awaken! We must put our industry and our society into war footing. Civilian industries must shift to military production and the production of military materiel must receive top resource and workforce priority."

 GER_relocate_industry: "Relocate Industry"
 GER_relocate_industry_desc: "We must move factories from the threatened Rhenish cities and transport their equipment further inland, where they would be safe from enemy bombers and, in the worst case, military occupation."

 GER_conversion_industry: "Conversion of Civilian Industry"
 GER_conversion_industry_desc: "In times of war, we require bullets, not butter, and shells, not sausages! We must order civilian companies to move part or all of their production capacity to military goods production."

 GER_guest_workers: "Fremdarbeiterprogramm"
 GER_guest_workers_desc: "As more and more of our workers are being sent to the front, factories lose necessary personnel and their production capacity suffers. Like in the previous war, women will have to be employed, but another source of labour can be thousands of Eastern European citizens who can be imported here as guest workers."

 GER_wartime_espionage: "Expand Wartime Espionage"
 GER_wartime_espionage_desc: "Our armies require precise intelligence on enemy troop movements, strategies and invasion plans if they wish to prevail. We need to expand the size of our espionage services and root out double agents within our ranks."

 GER_expand_conscription: "Escalate Conscription"
 GER_expand_conscription_desc: "The war is turning out to be a total one, requiring a complete dedication of all of each nation's resources to prevail. Our armies are running thin on reserves - we must expand the conscription bracket and hunt down those who slipped through our fingers."

 # Military

 GER_army_reform_stuff: "Initiate Military Reform"
 GER_army_reform_stuff_desc: "The German military is the greatest fighting force on the planet - however, even we must consider reform to match the worrying growing strength of our enemies East and West alike. New technologies must be integrated to our ranks, new strategies drawn and new military industries established."

 GER_the_reaction: "Adapting to Modernity"
 GER_the_reaction_desc: "The military establishment of the Heer is certain that our traditional military strategies are adequate and the extreme rhetoric of the Reformisten and Die Fronde would only lead to destructive results. We should adapt to modern technology somewhat, but retain our proven traditional touch."

 GER_streamlined_mobilisation: "Streamlined Mobilisation"
 GER_streamlined_mobilisation_desc: "The Second Weltkrieg is likely to be a war of the masses, just like the first. We must improve our mobilisation protocols to account for this, and so ensure that the Heer can swiftly enroll reservists for another great conflict."

 GER_adapt_weltkrieg_experience: "Adapt Weltkrieg Experience"
 GER_adapt_weltkrieg_experience_desc: "The Weltkrieg required us to adapt to the rapidly changing times, and proved that a mass breakthrough that succeeds through the will of the infantryman, mass applied artillery and armoured support will break positional warfare and restore mobility to a stalled front. As the second Weltkrieg is also likely to end in trench warfare, we should train our officers with this in mind."

 GER_foster_aristocratic_tradition: "Foster Aristocratic Tradition"
 GER_foster_aristocratic_tradition_desc: "Though we cannot close the officer corps to commoners entirely, the military-aristocratic lineages of Prussia should remain the primary source of generals and commanders for the Heer. We must also foster aristocratic tradition in the corps and bolster noble camaraderie among the officers."

 GER_strengthen_branch_cooperation: "Strengthen Interservice Cooperation"
 GER_strengthen_branch_cooperation_desc: "The Heer, the Kaiserliche Marine and the Luftstreitkräfte should remain separate, but we do need to strengthen cooperation between them through a streamlined process of common tactical and strategic planning."

 GER_armoured_support: "Armoured Support Strategy"
 GER_armoured_support_desc: "The Panzer will play a supporting role in future wars. We cannot rely on armoured divisions - instead, the armoured corps should remain in close proximity with infantry and provide them protection, offensive and defensive capabilities."

 GER_mobile_artillery: "Mobile Artillery"
 GER_mobile_artillery_desc: "The artillery piece is the queen of the battlefield and won us the Weltkrieg - it must play a central role in breakthroughs in future wars as well. Instead of stationary batteries, however, we must transition to mobile artillery which has greater freedom of action and can respond to emergencies on the front."

 GER_aggressive_breakthrough: "Mass Breakthrough"
 GER_aggressive_breakthrough_desc: "Once we recognise a vulnerability in the enemy lines, we must do a massive, aggressive breakthrough relying on elite unit infiltration and concentration of force - just like during the Kaiserschlacht. The enemy will be overwhelmed, scattered, and mopped up by the advancing infantry."

 GER_the_revolt: "Revolt of the Totalitarians"
 GER_the_revolt_desc: "The Die Fronde unites disparate factions which seek a totalitarian transformation of the Heer — from improving the \"psychology\" of the common soldier through national propaganda and devotion, to total mobilisation of all national resources for war. Technology serves the will of the German people and should be used for unrestrained destruction of the enemy!"

 GER_wehrmacht: "Establish the Wehrmacht"
 GER_wehrmacht_desc: "For too long, the army, navy and airforce of the German Empire have been independent of one another, hampering communication and cooperation between them. We shall put them all under a unified armed forces structure - the Imperial Defence Force, or the Wehrmacht."

 GER_rapid_mobilisation: "Enhanced Mobilisation Strategies"
 GER_rapid_mobilisation_desc: "The Wehrmacht must prepare itself to mobilise and begin offensive operations within 48 hours of an order being given. If a new world war breaks out, we must respond immediately and overwhelm our opponents before they can even react."

 GER_military_ideology: "Victory or Death"
 GER_military_ideology_desc: "In the eyes of some, the Heer, much like its predecessor, the Prussian Army, must be apolitical and serve as the right arm of the Kaiser. We disagree - our soldiers' minds must be injected with nationalist, patriotic ideology. They need to know that they are fighting for their nation's survival and be willing to sacrifice themselves if necessary."

 GER_total_war: "The Call to Total War"
 GER_total_war_desc: "The Weltkriegs are unlike any other conflict before them - they are wars of total resource mobilisation, and only a nation completely dedicated to war will prevail over their enemies. We must heed this call to total war - the German nation will rise to the great struggle as one!"

 GER_soldier_psychology: "The Psychology of the Footsoldier"
 GER_soldier_psychology_desc: "Technology can turn the tide of a battle if applied correctly, but only a determined and courageous force reliably wins whole wars. We need to improve the psychology of the footsoldier - instill them with nationalist ideology, improve their conditions, and establish strict training which will turn draftees into warriors."

 GER_unrestrained_warfare: "Unrestrained Warfare"
 GER_unrestrained_warfare_desc: "In a total war, nothing is beyond the pale - chemical or even biological weapons must be considered if we wish to break the will of the enemy and shatter them. Let us put an end to measly regulations and moral qualms and unleash unrestrained German power upon our opponent!"

 GER_counteroffensive_strategies: "Counteroffensive Strategies"
 GER_counteroffensive_strategies_desc: "After our determined troops endure the first blow of the enemy, we must do a spirited counteroffensive which will create openings in the enemy lines and turn the front into a manoeuvre war. This will allow us to encircle and shatter the enemy divisions. We must prepare for such a counteroffensive in advance."

 GER_stay_behind_units: "Stay-Behind Units"
 GER_stay_behind_units_desc: "We need to establish stay-behind units which can harass enemy supply lines under occupation, drain the resolve of the enemy push, and allow us to shatter them in a victorious counterstrike."

 GER_faith_in_german_race: "Nationalist Indoctrination"
 GER_faith_in_german_race_desc: "Above all else, the German soldier must believe in the Empire, the Kaiser, and the regime, and understand that he is fighting to save the German race from extinction. Such patriotic feelings will motivate our troops into breaking through even the toughest defences."

 GER_path_of_seeckt: "The Footsteps of Seeckt"
 GER_path_of_seeckt_desc: "The Reformisten build upon the reforms of Hans von Seeckt and seek to transform the Heer into a professional fighting force. There is no point in holding onto old aristocratic traditions when the masses can bring even more expertise and talent, and technology must be applied for a combined-arms offensive that runs laps around old infantry-based armies."

 GER_reichskriegsamt: "Reichskriegsamt"
 GER_reichskriegsamt_desc: "For too long, the army, navy and airforce of the German Empire have been independent of one another, hampering communication and cooperation between them. We shall put them all under a unified armed forces structure and establish the Imperial War Office as the official ministry of the army which will be responsible for all national military matters."

 GER_interservice_cooperation: "Interservice Cooperation"
 GER_interservice_cooperation_desc: "Modern warfare depends on effective cooperation between the army, airforce and the navy - without it, we will not be able to execute any grand manoeuvres or effectively execute out plans for combined arms warfare. Let us put an end to petty interservice rivalries and establish the mechanisms for fruitful cooperation."

 GER_general_staff_reform: "Thorough Education of the General Staff"
 GER_general_staff_reform_desc: "The General Staff need to be educated in politics, strategy and even economics if we wish for them to fully comprehend the scope of the war and make the correct strategic decisions. We must reform our curricula in the War Schools to account for this."

 GER_abolition_of_federal_armies: "Abolition of Federal Armies"
 GER_abolition_of_federal_armies_desc: "The armies of Bavaria, Württemberg and Saxony retain a certain level of autonomy, and though this has long been a point of pride for these three kingdoms, a unified Imperial Armed Forces need not be divided into Prussian and non-Prussian units. All federal armies shall be merged into the Deutsche Streitkräfte!"

 GER_abolish_immediatrecht: "Abolish Immediatrecht"
 GER_abolish_immediatrecht_desc: "Our reforms need to expand civilian control over the military - Immediatrecht, which allows military leadership to bypass the civilian government and speak directly to the Kaiser, will be abolished, and the Reichskriegsamt, led by civilian politicians, will thus be primary intermediary between military leadership and the government."

 GER_professional_core: "The Professional Core"
 GER_professional_core_desc: "The Heer must become a trained, drilled core of motorised, well supplied troops who can rout and destroy even larger enemy forces through the application of superior technology and tactics. We need to drastically increase professionalism of the standing army and improve their equipment."

 GER_combined_arms_offensive: "Combined Arms Offensive"
 GER_combined_arms_offensive_desc: "Led by a spearhead of independent Panzer divisions and supported by a vast airforce, our forces will shatter enemy lines and force the war into mobility, at which point we will be able to easily destroy and overwhelm the slow and less trained enemy units."

 GER_training_standards: "Top-Notch Training Standards"
 GER_training_standards_desc: "Our forces must reach the pinnacle of soldierly discipline. We must organise large scale manoeuvres involving units from all branches of the military to prepare for combined arms warfare, and always keep the professional core of the army ready for the next great war."

 GER_lower_class: "Open Doors to the Lower Class"
 GER_lower_class_desc: "For decades, the upper levels of the Heer officer ranks have been dominated by the nobility - limiting us to only a fraction of the intellect and talent of the German people. Let us break down the last barriers to commoner career advancement and create a more inclusive officer corps focused on talent rather than birth."

 GER_yearning_for_cannae: "Yearning for Cannae"
 GER_yearning_for_cannae_desc: "For centuries, German military doctrine has been built upon the principles of manoeuvre, encirclement and destruction. The ancient battle of Cannae is drilled into the heads of war academy students as the perfect battle - and we should continue striving for it, improving upon our principles of manoeuvre warfare to create an unstoppable doctrine of modern war."

 GER_einkreisung: "Second Einkreisungstheorie"
 GER_einkreisung_desc: "Much like before the Weltkrieg, we are becoming surrounded by enemies. This is, of course, the fruit of the villainous plotting of Russians and syndicalists, and not the outcome of mistakes by our foreign policy - however, force of arms will correct this development. This Second Einkreisung must serve as a waking up call for our armed forces and society."

 GER_infantry_motorisation: "Infantry Motorisation"
 GER_infantry_motorisation_desc: "The advancement of technology allows us to expand the manoeuvre capabilities of our entire infantry force, not just select spearheads, granting a new edge to our forces. Though even partial motorisation of infantry forces will be expensive, it is not impossible to afford, and the boons will outweigh the costs tenfold."

 GER_expand_kriegsschulen: "Expand the Kriegsschulen"
 GER_expand_kriegsschulen_desc: "The War Schools and War Academies have formed the core of the Prussian officer corps since the 17th century, and while they have not failed us, they should be expanded in order to accommodate additional students, especially from the lower classes, to whom we should slowly open up officer positions."

 GER_kampfgruppe: "Kampfgruppen Tactical Formations"
 GER_kampfgruppe_desc: "The Kampfgruppen are ad hoc combined arms formations established for specific tasks at any given moment during a large operation - they are much more elastic than standard divisions and can be formed to respond to immediate needs on the front. We must expand their use across the Imperial German Army."

 GER_technology_annihilation: "Annihilation Through Technology"
 GER_technology_annihilation_desc: "Discipline and faith are not enough to prevail in modern war - and our mobile tactics require greater emphasis on technological development than ever. We must expand our research and development capabilities to annihilate our opponents with superior application of technology - tanks, planes and support gear alike."

 GER_new_manoeuvre_warfare: "Commission Manoeuvre Warfare Textbooks"
 GER_new_manoeuvre_warfare_desc: "We must update the textbooks and manuals used by the Imperial German Army to account for the experience of the Weltkrieg and how it affects our doctrine of manoeuvre warfare. There are plenty of theorists in the ranks of our forces who have put their thoughts into words already, now all we need is a consistent theory to follow."

 GER_prepare_for_russia: "Prepare for Wide Front Operations"
 GER_prepare_for_russia_desc: "In Russia, we will face against rolling plains and forests, in which even vast conscription armies can get overstretched. We must prepare for long distance manoeuvre warfare in the East and ensure that our troops can move with discipline for longer."

 GER_prepare_for_france: "Vanquish French Fortifications"
 GER_prepare_for_france_desc: "In France, we will face against several layers of fortifications, designed to counter our usual aggressive pushes. To compensate, we must escalate our destructive capabilities and gear our forces for a vast combined arms breakthrough on the border."

 GER_mechanised_infantry: "Develop Mechanised Infantry"
 GER_mechanised_infantry_desc: "Motorised infantry struggles to maintain the momentum of an attack in battlefields obstructed by craters and trenches, and their soft skinned vehicles offer little protection for troops. We must transition towards elite infantry equipped with half-tracks that can keep up with tanks while providing adequate support."

 GER_panzer_divisions: "Panzer Divisions"
 GER_panzer_divisions_desc: "The age of infantry tanks is over. Armour must be massed in independent formations that can achieve sufficient breakthrough and rout enemy armies with its armour and mobility. Once developed, our tank fleet will overrun the syndicalists and the Russians!"

 GER_artillery_focus: "Queen of the Battlefield"
 GER_artillery_focus_desc: "Armoured warfare must always go alongside adequate fire support. Development of self-propelling artillery will ensure that the Queen of the Battlefield always roars and can always support the advancing armoured spearhead."

 GER_panzer_focus: "Mechanised Wave"
 GER_panzer_focus_desc: "We are one of the few countries on the planet which can afford mass deployment of tanks. We must grow the size and number of our panzer divisions, and rely on them as the primary offensive force of our operations."

 GER_tank_destroyers: "Tank Destroyers"
 GER_tank_destroyers_desc: "As we expand our armoured force, so do our enemies — thus, we need a solution to counter enemy tanks. One option is to deploy \"tank destroyers\", bolting anti-tank guns onto a tank chassis to pierce through enemy armour. It is not a permanent solution, but it works fine for now."

 GER_modern_communications: "Proliferate Modern Communications"
 GER_modern_communications_desc: "Modern manoeuvre warfare is only possible if we always maintain communications between units and the upper command, as otherwise any offensive will stall due to lacking orders and intelligence. We shall invest more in radio and radar technologies to account for this."

 GER_w_system: "Establish the W-System"
 GER_w_system_desc: "Another war is inevitable. Slowly, Germany must enter war footing once more. We shall declare certain factories, \"W-plants\", to produce solely military production, and begin the rearmament of our armed forces."

 GER_industriewerke: "Industriewerke Network"
 GER_industriewerke_desc: "Merely declaring that existing factories must work for the Imperial German Army is not enough - we shall begin the construction of a network of state-owned munition and weapons plants, the Industriewerke, to expand the existing military-industrial complex." # decisions to build more mil factories

 GER_naval_production: "Reinvigorate Naval Yards"
 GER_naval_production_desc: "The pride of the German coastal cities, its naval yards which built the invincible Kaiserliche Marine, must return to war footing - we shall grant them new contracts and hold meetings with naval arms manufacturers to receive preferential status and restore our lost potential."

 GER_assembly_line: "Assembly Line Production Methods"
 GER_assembly_line_desc: "The next war will be a war of mass production, not of individual quality. We must start implementing modern assembly line production in the Industriewerke and other state industries to drastically increase our production efficiency."

 GER_brabag: "Form BRABAG"
 GER_brabag_desc: "Surrounded by hostile powers from all sides, we must ensure energy efficiency, and we can achieve this through the advancements of modern technology - brown coal into synthetic fuel, Braunkohlen to Benzin. A state owned company dedicated to the development and production of synthetic fuels will aid us in this venture."

 GER_military_railways: "Military Railways"
 GER_military_railways_desc: "Civilian railways cannot fulfil the task of transporting enormous modern armed forces - infrastructure needs require the development and expansion of state owned railways dedicated solely to military transport, which can supply forces on the front and move troops from one side of Europe to another in a matter of weeks."

 GER_military_airports: "Build Up Western Airstrips"
 GER_military_airports_desc: "To break the syndicalists, we must win the war in the air - and if we want to win the war in the air, we must deploy more and more planes, and have place to store them. New airstrips along the western front will ensure that we always maintain our numerical edge."

 GER_domestic_steel: "Expand Ties with Friedrich Krupp AG"
 GER_domestic_steel_desc: "The Krupp conglomerate is one of the most famed steel and arms producers in all of Europe - and our ties with their establishment go a long way back. We must retain and expand these ties, fostering cooperation between our army and the defence industry."

 GER_infantry_development: "Expand Rifle Testing in WaPrüf-II"
 GER_infantry_development_desc: "WaPrüf-II is the Infantry Section of the Heereswaffenamt, which deals with research, development, testing and adoption of infantry kits. We must reopen contests for modern Heer infantry kits and begin testing new, improved rifles which will gives us an edge in firefights and skirmishes."

 GER_mauser_werke: "New Contracts with Mauser AG"
 GER_mauser_werke_desc: "Originating from Württemberg, Mauser has been the primary small arms supplier for the Imperial German Army since the 1870s, and their designs such as the Gewehr 98 are now popular across the entire planet. We must establish new contracts with the company for research and production of infantry equipment."

 GER_artillery_development: "Develop Self-Propelled Artillery"
 GER_artillery_development_desc: "For most of artillery history, artillery pieces were relatively immobile, horse-drawn at best - modern technology now allows us to surpass this limit and mount high-calibre guns on vehicles, allowing artillery to propel itself across the battlefield. We must investigate these tactics and pursue their widespread adoption in the Heer."

 GER_rocket_development: "Raketenwerfer"
 GER_rocket_development_desc: "The rocket launcher is a curious alternative to artillery, which is more expensive and less accurate, but allows for greater range and mobility, as vehicle-mounted rocket launchers have little to no recoil and allow the vehicle to leave the field at once. We must focus our research on the Raketenwerfer and deploy our first rocket artillery brigades."

 GER_railway_guns: "Krupp Railway Artillery Programme"
 GER_railway_guns_desc: "Railway guns are enormous artillery pieces which can blast fortifications to smithereens and are developed by Krupp. Let us adapt their railway artillery programme and field a flock of guns which can blast through Communard forts, letting mobile forces break through with ease."

 GER_tank_development: "Expand the HWA Automotive Section"
 GER_tank_development_desc: "The Automotive Section of the Heereswaffenamt deals with research and development of vehicles, especially tanks. We need to draw additional engineers and companies to the section and expand its funding - this will drastically improve our armour research capabilities."

 GER_anti_tank_development: "Panzerabwehrkanone"
 GER_anti_tank_development_desc: "We are not the only ones who focus on the application of armour - the French and the Russians will surely field armoured forces of their own, and we need to find ways to counter them. The development of anti-tank guns, which can pierce and destroy tanks, is the best solution, and we need to pursue it."

 GER_peenemunde_centre: "Establish Peenemünde"
 GER_peenemunde_centre_desc: "The advancements of modern aircraft and rocketry require a centre dedicated solely to the research and development of both. Peenemünde, in Pomerania, shall serve this role adequately, as soon as we establish the necessary infrastructure."

 GER_heavy_tanks: "Surpass Syndicalist Piercing"
 GER_heavy_tanks_desc: "Doubtlessly, the French will develop greater and greater armour piercing capabilities to counter our armour - this can only be answered with even heavier armour. Heavy tanks, with several layers of protection, will become behemoths of the battlefield, totally invulnerable to almost anything."

 GER_enigma_machine: "The Enigma Machine"
 GER_enigma_machine_desc: "Intelligence gathering has been a key part of warfare since its early beginnings - and with modern technology, we can make our actions truly in decipherable. The Enigma machine has been presented to us as an uncrackable code writer that will ensure our permanent advantage against syndicalist deciphering efforts - we need to put it to use."

 GER_nuclear_research: "Establish the Uranverein"
 GER_nuclear_research_desc: "Recently, our physicists have taken interest in the potential of so-called \"nuclear\" energy, released from the splitting of the atom, which could become an inexhaustible source of fuel - or set the atmosphere on fire in a chain reaction and cause the end of humanity. If we dedicate resources to investigating this phenomenon, we can figure out which of these is more likely."

 GER_electronics_research: "Zuse Apparatebau"
 GER_electronics_research_desc: "Konrad Zuse is a young genius who has managed to pioneer groundbreaking computing technology from very humble means. He built the world's first programmable computer in a Berliner flat, with a box of scraps! Granting him the funds to set up a computing company will allow us to put his skills to use in military and civilian applications alike."

 GER_wever_doctrine: "The Operational Air War"
 GER_wever_doctrine_desc: "Transferred from the ground forces to the Luftstreitkräfte, Walther Wever is a representative of the Seecktian reformist faction in the air force. His programme involves a balanced approach that would advance both direct offensive support and long range bombing."

 GER_armour_air_spearhead: "Support the Armoured Spearhead"
 GER_armour_air_spearhead_desc: "The air force is able to support advancing ground forces independent of railways - motorised units, armoured cars and especially the Panzer divisions. Disrupting the movement of enemy forces and targeting units on the ground will ease the breakthrough of our front line, enabling encirclement and annihilation."

 GER_tactical_destruction: "Tactical Annihilation"
 GER_tactical_destruction_desc: "We cannot rely solely on close air support - the necessity of targeting enemy infrastructure and industrial facilities requires the development of medium and long range bombers that can strike our foes near and far."

 GER_airbase_targets: "Airbase Destruction Focus"
 GER_airbase_targets_desc: "A long range bomber fleet must first strike enemy military infrastructure - above all them, air bases. Should we cripple the enemy air fleet while it is still on the ground, it will leave them helpless against total disintegration of their ground forces."

 GER_long_range_bombers: "Long-Range Bombers"
 GER_long_range_bombers_desc: "We must consider projects that push long range bombers to their technological limits. Perhaps, it will be possible to design a plane which will be able to reach all the way to the Ural mountains - the ability to cover such immense ground from a single air base would be indispensable."

 GER_seize_naval_air_arm: "Push for Transfer of the Naval Aviation to LSK"
 GER_seize_naval_air_arm_desc: "When the Luftstreitkräfte was finally turned into an independent branch of the armed forces of the German Empire, compromises had to be made, most notably leaving naval aviation to the all-imperial fleet. Representing the reformists, who seek to transform the Army into a modern armed force, Wever has actively pushed for redress of this agreement."

 GER_air_tannenberg: "Tannenberg in the Air"
 GER_air_tannenberg_desc: "The Battle of Tannenberg was won with the disruption of Russian infrastructure and communications, allowing the great marshal Hindenburg to defeat them in detail. A capable air force will be able to accomplish this even more easily, targeting supply lines and railways to cause chaos behind the front." # by preventing reserves from reaching the battle through disrupted infra, like Tannenberg

 GER_richthofen_doctrine: "Shattering Swords"
 GER_richthofen_doctrine_desc: "Wolfram von Richthofen, as well as his brother Manfred, the Red Baron, are supporters of the traditional approach of the Luftstreitkräfte - close air support and a powerful fighter plane corps which will ensure dominance in the skies, and allow the air force to cut costs by abandoning expensive strategic bomber plans."

 GER_air_superiority_focus: "Dominate the Skies"
 GER_air_superiority_focus_desc: "The war in the air can only be won by a massed force of fighter planes, which will crush the enemy wings and give free reign to our dive bombers to lay waste to the enemy forces. Let us make this our top priority."

 GER_ace_generation: "New Fighter Ace Cult"
 GER_ace_generation_desc: "Though fighter aces cannot win the war in the air alone, they serve as great propaganda icons and can be used to rally the home front around their impressive heroism. Much like during the Weltkrieg, we will foster a cult of these ace pilots and use them as an anchor to keep our war support afloat."

 GER_dive_bombers: "Dive Bomber Design"
 GER_dive_bombers_desc: "A dive bomber needs to be fast, precise and deal a lot of damage at once, disorganising the ground defences of the enemy and allowing the armoured spearhead to punch through the scattered troops. We must push our plane designers to achieve these design goals."

 GER_air_production_mass: "Economy of Scale"
 GER_air_production_mass_desc: "Dive bombers and fighter planes can be produced on a far greater number than their larger counterparts - and we must use this to our advantage. A massive air fleet composed of smaller planes will be able to overwhelm the enemy with sheer numbers."

 GER_ground_support_tactics: "Ground Support Tactics"
 GER_ground_support_tactics_desc: "In order to ensure that our ideal method of combined arms ground support is always pulled off without a hitch, we must improve communication and cooperation between the air force and the mobile units, and test these tactics in manoeuvres in advance."

 GER_knauss_doctrine: "Destruction of Will"
 GER_knauss_doctrine_desc: "A supporter of Giulio Douhet's ideas of complete annihilation of enemy will to fight with strategic bombardment, Robert Knauss is a radical choice aligned with the Psychologists - and he will seek to transform the Luftstreitkräfte into a terror inducing machine."

 GER_strategic_bombers: "Strategic Bombing Fleets"
 GER_strategic_bombers_desc: "Construction priority must be given to long range strategic bombers, and we must form entire fleets of bombers in order to lay waste to enemy facilities and cities before they do so to us."

 GER_firepower_focus: "Firepower Focus"
 GER_firepower_focus_desc: "The wars of the future will be won not via advanced tactics or individual heroism, but via enormous firepower. Nowhere else is this more clear than in the air force - with each passing year, our capacity to destroy grows greater and greater. Let us embrace this focus and overwhelm the enemy!"

 GER_terror_bombing: "Terror Bombing"
 GER_terror_bombing_desc: "Though it may seem inhumane, the destruction of cities and targeting of civilian buildings is necessary to break the enemy's will to fight. However, if it ensures lesser casualties for us - and for our enemy, as they will surrender sooner rather than later - these losses are acceptable."

 GER_strategic_target_analysis: "Strategic Target Analysis"
 GER_strategic_target_analysis_desc: "We must establish departments tasked with analysis of enemy industrial capabilities and the most crucial elements of their production grid - so they can subsequently be annihilated by our strategic bombers, crippling their ability to replenish their losses and bringing them closer to capitulation."

 GER_bomber_aerial_combat: "Bomber Aerial Combat Tactics"
 GER_bomber_aerial_combat_desc: "Though bombers will never be able to compete with fighter planes in air-to-air combat, they are not entirely helpless - and adding long-range escort fighters to our bomber squadrons will ensure we have back-up and prevent the enemy from simply annihilating our pilots during their raids."

 GER_air_defence: "Fortify the Cities"
 GER_air_defence_desc: "While ideally no enemy bomber will ever reach the Ruhr, we must be prepared for even the worst possible outcome. When our airforce cannot stop the enemy fleets, our last line of defence, stationary anti-air towers, will keep our cities safe."

 GER_radar_detection: "FuMG Detection"
 GER_radar_detection_desc: "The science of using electromagnetic waves for object detection has a long history in Germany and we must remain pioneers in this field. Physicist Rudolf Kühnhold in the Kaiserliche Marine has presented successful experiments in creating a Funkmessgerät - radio measuring device, which will detect incoming planes and ships from farther than the eyes can see."

 GER_sturmgruppen_focus: "Sturmgruppen"
 GER_sturmgruppen_focus_desc: "The bomber fleets fielded by the syndicalists require a counter - massed wings of heavy fighter interceptors, which can chase and intercept strategic bombers, will ensure that enemy bombers will be picked off and destroyed before they can deal any damage to our industry."

 GER_night_operations: "Night Operation Training"
 GER_night_operations_desc: "The night offers significant challenges to air operations, but provides advantages as well - covered by the veil of darkness, our planes could lay waste to enemy positions before they even know what hit them. We must establish special training regimen for our pilots to ensure that they fight in the night as well as in the day."

 GER_proliferation_of_anti_air: "Proliferation of Anti-Air Batteries"
 GER_proliferation_of_anti_air_desc: "As many planes as we produce, they cannot cover the entire front - this gives ample opportunity for enemy bombers to pick off vulnerable infantry formations before our fighters can intercept them. Providing our troops with mobile anti-air batteries will eliminate this concern."

 GER_hwa_aircraft_sector: "Reform the HWA Aerial Section"
 GER_hwa_aircraft_sector_desc: "The Aerial Section of the Heereswaffenamt deals with procurement, research and development of new aircraft - granting it additional funding and establishing additional sub-sections for new plane categories will allow us to retain the technological edge."

 GER_aircraft_industry: "Develop the Aircraft Industry"
 GER_aircraft_industry_desc: "We must establish permanent contracts with major aircraft producing companies and thus allow them to tap into their full wartime production potential. Civilian plane assembly lines can be retrofitted to build fighter planes and bombers - and we will need a whole lot more of those in the future."

 GER_siemens: "Collaboration with Siemens-Schuckert"
 GER_siemens_desc: ""I need a telegraph line and electric trams"\n"No problem, here you go, German government. Anything else?"\n"You wouldn't happen to know where I could get bomber planes using an air-cooled 14-cylinder-radial aircraft engine, would you?"\n"You're not gonna believe this""

 GER_parachute_divisions: "Form the Parachute Divisions"
 GER_parachute_divisions_desc: "Development of parachutes and transport planes provides the opportunity for aircraft to not just support, but launch invasions. We must immediately pursue this path - our Parachute Divisions will deploy behind enemy lines, capture strategic points and islands, and paralyse the enemy before the full invasion force arrives."

 GER_luftkriegsschule: "Expand the Luftkriegsschulen"
 GER_luftkriegsschule_desc: "The \"Air Warfare Schools\", established after the end of the Weltkrieg to supply the newly independent Luftstreitkräfte with pilots and officers, raise the next generation of military airmen. However, additional funding and expansion of facilities will allow them to provide even greater numbers of talent for the air force."

 GER_new_naval_theory: "The Second Naval Plan"
 GER_new_naval_theory_desc: "The plans of the great admiral Alfred von Tirpitz to expand the Imperial German navy were not completed by the Weltkrieg, but they prove that a strong navy is necessary for a great power. A Second Weltkrieg approaches, and we must once again expand and reform our navy to meet the challenges of the day."

 GER_submarine_arm: "The Submarine Arm"
 GER_submarine_arm_desc: "Our submarine fleet performed admirably in the Weltkrieg, even if their operations led to several diplomatic incidents. Even as we expand and reform the surface fleet, we must not forget the efficiency of underwater operations and expand their size as well."

 GER_elektroboot: "Elektroboot"
 GER_elektroboot_desc: "An electric submarine, unlike previous designs, would be able to operate underwater for very long periods of time without requiring to surface - a crucial step in submarine design which would drastically enhance their stealth and offensive capabilities. We must investigate this idea."

 GER_revised_wolfpacks: "Revised Rudeltaktik"
 GER_revised_wolfpacks_desc: "During the Weltkrieg, British ships began to assemble into convoys, which pushed our U-boats to organise into \"wolfpacks\" to counter them - yet, lack of coordination led to their failure. We must outfit submarines with radios and increase central control from the naval command to make up for these shortfalls."

 GER_navy_cartelisation: "Cartelise the Shipbuilding Industry" # Deschimag, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsche_Schiff-_und_Maschinenbau
 GER_navy_cartelisation_desc: "We must enhance the efficiency of ship building by encouraging smaller naval companies to unify into cartels - if it works for automobiles or steel, it will work for ships. The Deutsche Schiff- und Maschinenbau, a unification of eight private shipyards, will be the crowning jewel of a cartelised naval industry."

 GER_navy_league: "Activate the Flottenverein"
 GER_navy_league_desc: "The Flottenverein, or the Navy League, led by Adolf von Trotha, has campaigned in support of naval expansion since the early 1900s — and now that we are expanding our fleet once more, their propaganda support will be valuable yet again."

 GER_imperial_shipyards: "The Three Imperial Shipyards" # https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelmshaven_Imperial_Shipyard
 GER_imperial_shipyards_desc: "The shipyards of Kiel, Danzig and Wilhelmshaven are known as the Three Imperial Shipyards, as the produced the majority of the ships for the Prussian and Imperial navies. We must expand their facilities and sign new contracts with the shipyard authorities to bolster our naval production there."

 GER_germaniawerft_focus: "Remilitarise Germaniawerft"
 GER_germaniawerft_focus_desc: "Friedrich Krupp Germaniawerft is one of Germany's largest civilian ship building companies - yet, as the war looms closer, they must begin the switch to military production. Ocean liners and sailing ships will be replaced with submarines and battleships."

 GER_vulkan_schichau: "Bailout Vulkan Werft and Schichau-Werke"
 GER_vulkan_schichau_desc: "Vulkan and Schichau-Werke were key shipbuilding companies for our fleet during the Weltkrieg, but the years of peace have left them in dire straits. We must offer a bailout to these companies and sign lucrative military shipbuilding contracts with them, keeping them afloat and expanding our naval production further."

 GER_graf_zeppelin: "Flugzeugträger A"
 GER_graf_zeppelin_desc: "Experiments after the Weltkrieg have shown that air power is likely to play a crucial role in the naval battles of the future - planes launched off specially designed carriers can strike farther and deadlier than even the heaviest battleships. We must award a contract to a company to begin construction of Flugzeugträger A - Germany's own aircraft carrier."

 GER_super_bismarck: "H-Class Battleships"
 GER_super_bismarck_desc: "The future of naval design will be a never ending quest for bigger calibre of cannon. Let us construct true goliaths of the sea - H-class battleships, which will tower over the measly surface ships of the past and punch holes in enemy fleets."

 GER_naval_aviation: "Expand Naval Aviation"
 GER_naval_aviation_desc: "The cooperation of naval and aerial forces has become increasingly crucial in operations at sea - naval bombers can support surface fleets or even conduct bold bombing raids to take down key enemy ships att by themselves. We must expand our fleet's naval aviation section to accommodate this."

 GER_wegener_doctrine: "Wegener Doctrine"
 GER_wegener_doctrine_desc: "The balance of power may have shifted, but our primary enemy hasn't changed - the Union of Britain must be defeated in open battle at sea. Wolfgang Wegener has a vision of an aggressive fleet that will incite the British into open battle through convoy raiding and break them with superior firepower."
 GER_wegener_doctrine_tt: "§YWe will choose Wolfgang Wegener's vision for the Kriegsmarine - a full focus on open battle with the British syndicalists in the North Sea and the firepower to break them.§!"

 GER_fast_battleships: "Fast Battleships"
 GER_fast_battleships_desc: "We must task our ship designers to create smaller, but faster battleships which will be able to serve dual role as line ships and as convoy raiders thanks to their combined speed and power."

 GER_strike_force_concentration: "Strike Force Concentration"
 GER_strike_force_concentration_desc: "A large enough concentration of ships and cannons can break through any fleet - and we shall take this principle to its natural conclusion. Our operations in the North Sea will see a vast concentrated force crushing through measly British task forces!"

 GER_expand_marines: "Expand the Seebataillone"
 GER_expand_marines_desc: "Marine forces are necessary if we wish to acquire strategic basing in the North Sea region and force enemy fleets out of their ports for a decisive battle which will crush the British fleet and allow us to reign supreme. We must expand our Sea Battalions for this plan."

 GER_shetland_gamble: "Prepare for the Norway- Shetland Gamble"
 GER_shetland_gamble_desc: "Once the war begins, our fleets will advance towards the gap between Norway and the Shetland isles and establish a blockade on all shipping which will force Britain into sending their fleet against us. This will incite a decisive battle which we will win, as long as we are prepared!"

 GER_officer_training: "Offensive Officer Training"
 GER_officer_training_desc: "The commanders of our ships must be trained with the offensive plan of decisive battle in mind, they must know the ins and outs of surface fleet combat and learn to take risks when necessary. We must root out the old guard and replace them with brilliant and aggressive young officers, as well."

 GER_police_north_sea: "Policing the North Sea"
 GER_police_north_sea_desc: "Our fleets must police the North Sea during wartime at all times, and register all movement of hostile fleets, all with the intent of drawing out a decisive battle which will sink the British fleet to the sea and grant us dominance in the oceans!"

 GER_raeder_doctrine: "Raeder Doctrine"
 GER_raeder_doctrine_desc: "Our new worldwide empire and challenges from several fronts require us to rethink our naval approach. Erich Raeder's double-pole approach and emphasis on carrier task groups will allow us to target and harass our enemies' lines worldwide."
 GER_raeder_doctrine_tt: "§YWe will choose Erich Raeder's vision for the Kriegsmarine - a balanced approach that will emphasise worldwide operations by combined arms carrier task groups.§!"

 GER_combined_arms_task_forces: "Combined Arms Task Forces"
 GER_combined_arms_task_forces_desc: "Our surface fleet must be organised into task forces with capital ships and carriers as their backbone, supported by auxiliary ships, and tasked with a specific mission or objective - this system of operations, responding to the needs of the war rather than rigidly following flotilla numbers, will be much more effective."

 GER_memel_to_noumea: "From Memel to Noumea"
 GER_memel_to_noumea_desc: "Our naval forces should be able to operate beyond our home waters in Europe - the entire Empire must be defended from enemy attacks. We must prepare our fleets for long distance operations and contract ship designers who would be able to answer these needs."

 GER_double_pole_approach: "Double-Pole Approach"
 GER_double_pole_approach_desc: "Rather than concentrating on a single decisive battle in the North Sea, we must force the syndicalist fleets to stretch themselves out by engaging them both in home waters and in the Atlantic - give their convoys and fleets no reprieve and besiege their nations."

 GER_worldwide_annihilation: "Worldwide Supply Route Annihilation"
 GER_worldwide_annihilation_desc: "Long distance operations will allow us to expand the reach of supply route raiding and target enemy convoys worldwide, pushing their logistics system to the absolute brink and forcing their fleets out of port, into a standoff we are certain to win."

 GER_speed_and_efficiency: "Speed and Cooperation"
 GER_speed_and_efficiency_desc: "Our task forces must emphasise swift organisation, movement towards the objective, and cooperation between different arms of the navy to create a perfect symphony of destruction."

 GER_long_distance_bases: "Expand Long-Distance Bases"
 GER_long_distance_bases_desc: "We must expand and outfit bases outside of Germany to house our large fleets operating worldwide - otherwise, our strategy of long distance operations will simply have no effect, and our colonies will be starved by enemy raiders."

 GER_pax_germanica: "Pax Germanica"
 GER_pax_germanica_desc: "Near and far, our enemies were numerous. For the first time since 1919, the hegemony of the German Empire was truly under threat. Yet, in spite of all they threw at us, our armies prevailed. The heroes return home, having cemented our reign for generations, and a new era of glory and prosperity begins."
 GER_pax_germanica_event_tt: "Near and far, our enemies were numerous. For the first time since 1919, the hegemony of the German Empire was truly under threat.

 GER_victory_arches: "Construct Victory Arches"
 GER_victory_arches_desc: "In the Second Weltkrieg, we lost many, and killed even more. Our sacrifices will be honoured, and our enemies will be humiliated, with the construction of victory arches throughout the Empire. Standing before plaques and pedestals, we may then move on from our postwar fervour for good, and think about the future."

 GER_woe_to_the_vanquished: "Woe to the Vanquished"
 GER_woe_to_the_vanquished_desc: "Our rivals in Europe stand defeated and occupied. In 1919, we were too soft on the French, basically letting them go free after taking border territories, and we couldn't even touch the Brits. This mistake will not be defeated - though nation building, we will crush our enemies' dreams of revanchism and consolidate the European order."

 GER_fifty_percent_plan: "The Fifty-Percent Plan"
 GER_fifty_percent_plan_desc: "We must cut down our enemies' industrial capabilities if we wish for them to never challenge us again. Let us set a goal - the defeated puppet states must have their heavy industry reduced to 50% of prewar levels. That which is not retained will be shipped to Germany wholesale - machinery, equipment and all."
 # The first "level of industry" plan, signed by the Allies on March 29, 1946, stated that German heavy industry was to be lowered to 50% of its 1938 levels by the destruction of 1,500 listed manufacturing plants.[3]

 GER_intellectual_property: "Seize Intellectual Property"
 GER_intellectual_property_desc: "Our enemies' scientists have created numerous inventions and patented them - this intellectual property now belongs to us. Their technological and scientific know-how now belongs to us - patents will be seized, research will be harvested, designs will be taken and applied in German factories."
 # The Allies confiscated large amounts of German intellectual property (patents and copyrights, but also trademarks).[30] Beginning immediately after the German surrender and continuing for the next two years the US pursued a vigorous programme to harvest all technological and scientific know-how as well as all patents in Germany.

 GER_seize_ships: "Commandeer Ships and Aircraft"
 GER_seize_ships_desc: "To ensure that our occupied enemies can never start a Third Weltkrieg, we must ensure that they have no more heavy weapons capacity. We will seize the ships and aircraft once operated by them and put them into our army's reserves, and ban the production of any new ones. If their militaries are ever established, they will merely be small numbers of ground troops for border policing."

 GER_lease_coal_oil: "50-Year Coal and Oil Leases"
 GER_lease_coal_oil_desc: "The resource deposits in the occupied zones could be used for the reestablishment of a military-industrial complex if they are returned to French and British hands - so, we will seize them for ourselves. Fifty years should be enough to profit from our enemies' resources and root out their revanchist ambitions."

 GER_promote_light_industry: "Promote Light Industry"
 GER_promote_light_industry_desc: "Export of heavy industrial products from our occupation zones will be banned, and instead we will promote leather goods, beer, wines, spirits, toys, musical instruments, textiles and apparel for export. This will neuter the heavy industry in these territories and make it impossible for them to swiftly rearm." # General agreement, he continued, had been reached on the types of German exports — coal, coke, electrical equipment, leather goods, beer, wines, spirits, toys, musical instruments, textiles and apparel — to take the place of the heavy industrial products which formed most of Germany's pre-war exports.[7]

 GER_lilleland: "The Lille Territory"
 GER_lilleland_desc: "It is unlikely that France will be able to pay reparations for all the damage it caused to us during the Second Weltkrieg by itself. So, let us occupy the resource rich surroundings of Lille and establish a resource extraction territory which will send all of its production to the German market and allow us to profit."

 GER_desyndicalisation: "De-Syndicalisation"
 GER_desyndicalisation_desc: "The poisonous ideology of syndicalism runs deep among the population of the defeated syndicalist states. We must reeducate these people - teach them the truth, the real truth, about the Commune and the Union, destroy syndicalist organisations, and create a compliant, pacifist society."

 GER_recruit_collaborators: "Recruit Collaborators"
 GER_recruit_collaborators_desc: "The syndicalist states faced numerous internal enemies - religious groups, liberal and conservative politicians, and monarchists, who will be willing collaborators as long as we reach out to them. We will offer them positions in the occupation administration and prepare them for national leadership."

 GER_formation_of_parties: "Orchestrate Formation of New Parties"
 GER_formation_of_parties_desc: "As much as we might want to, we cannot simply leave the syndicalist states and declare that our job is done - we must leave behind a stable political system which will not fall to radicalism again. Let us encourage the formation of new, enduring political parties which will be able to succeed us and keep their country peaceful and compliant."

 GER_local_elections: "Allow Local Elections"
 GER_local_elections_desc: "To show our intent to leave our occupied states and return control to their citizens, we should hold regional elections and mayoral elections, of course, only for candidated approved by the military administration. This will also gauge the strength of our newly established collaborationist parties."

 GER_hunt_down_resistance: "Destroy Resistance Cells"
 GER_hunt_down_resistance_desc: "Though the syndicalist armies have been broken, a handful of holdouts remain - retreating to the shadows, they are causing trouble in our supply lines and are sabotaging our desyndicalisation activities. We need to expand our presence in the occupation zones and root them out."

 GER_local_police_forces: "Establish Local Police Forces"
 GER_local_police_forces_desc: "To reduce the burden on our occupation forces, we must transfer more and more duties to local collaborators - allow them to establish volunteer groups and police which will fight syndicalist resistance for us and also build popular trust in our occupation."

 GER_amnesties: "Amnesties for Low-Level Officials"
 GER_amnesties_desc: "Though many officials in former syndicalist administrations were die-hard believers, some were not - they had only entered service for careerism or because they had no other choice. Though they cannot be fully trusted, we can offer amnesties to some of these officials and integrate them into our occupation regime to smoothen its day-to-day operations."

 GER_restore_civilian_administration: "Restore Civilian Administration"
 GER_restore_civilian_administration_desc: "Our hard work has paid off, and we can finally allow the election of a constitutional convention in our occupation zones which will establish new systems of government - which means we can leave and transfer all power to the collaborators. Of course, this does not mean that we should trust them."

 GER_russian_federation: "The Russian Federation"
 GER_russian_federation_desc: "After victory on the Eastern Front, we established a new Russian state - but simply defeating Russia in war is not enough to ensure that it will never challenge us again. We will rewrite its constitutional system, turn it byzantine and convoluted, and promote the interests and identities of its numerous ethnic minorities through large territorial autonomies - so that Russia would spend more time fighting itself than plotting a rebellion."

 GER_scapa_flow: "Take Over Scapa Flow"
 GER_scapa_flow_desc: "Having defeated Britain, we must seize their main naval base in the North Sea - Scapa Flow in northern Scotland, which oversees the northern entrance into the sea. It now belongs to us - we will seize it and turn it into a German naval base, and with it, we will turn the North Sea into our sea."

 GER_deutsches_weltreich: "Deutsches Weltreich"
 GER_deutsches_weltreich_desc: "Victorious in Europe, the Eagle now spreads its wings - and it has many places to fly to. As the unquestioned leader of the world, we must continue intervening, reshaping Asia, Africa and the Americas how we see fit - and challenge the last rivals remaining."

 GER_national_union: "Form the National People's Union"
 GER_national_union_desc: "Victorious in the Second Weltkrieg, we have earned the adoration of the masses - let's put it to use. We will unify the German right at last, and establish the National People's Union - which will establish itself as the permanent guide of the German people in the transformation of the Empire into a prosperous conservative state."

 GER_ban_spd: "Ban the Social Democratic Party"
 GER_ban_spd_desc: "At last, the Social Democratic giant has been crippled - through tactical sabotage of their auxiliary organisations and party grassroots, the SPD is weak enough that we can safely ban it without facing a revolution. Of course, it is unlikely that the Social Democrats will take this lightly, either..."

 GER_death_of_syndicalism: "Proclaim Death of German Syndicalism"
 GER_death_of_syndicalism_desc: "It was not long ago that traitorous syndicalist organisations within our borders loudly proclaimed that Germany would fall to the reds. Indeed, they all had contempt for the German nation and its way of life. But now, they and their foreign backers have been vanquished, and Germany stands tall as the vanguard of anti-syndicalism - now and forever."

 GER_bismarck_youth: "Establish the Bismarckjugend"
 GER_bismarck_youth_desc: "The renewal of Germany cannot be complete if the young generation is not instilled with patriotic values and Christian faith. Let us establish an official right-wing youth organisation for the DNVB - the Bismarck Youth."

 GER_consolidated_democracy: "Conservative Democracy"
 GER_consolidated_democracy_desc: "Though we respect the parliamentarian traditions of the Empire, we must do what we can to restrain the passions of the German people and serve as their patriotic, experienced caretakers. Parliamentarism is tolerable, as long as it is constructive, and so we will assume a leading position while our electoral opponents will calmly work with us."

 GER_defense_of_the_weltreich: "Defensive Power Projection"
 GER_defense_of_the_weltreich_desc: "While radical populists in the DNVB would have us on an international crusade, the Reichskanzler and his advisors appreciate German hegemony for the delicate balance it is. We will focus on keeping every corner of our global reach safe and our might respected through naval and armed presenses, deterring threats rather than inciting them."

 GER_all_christian_conservative_party: "An All-Christian Conservative Party"
 GER_all_christian_conservative_party_desc: "We must bridge the gap between Catholics and Protestants. Both religions have patriotic conservatives who care for the German nation deeply and are more alike than different. We must welcome them into the DNVB and expand our reach southwards."

 GER_adjust_constitution: "Adjust the Constitution"
 GER_adjust_constitution_desc: "We must fix some of the imperfections in the Imperial Constitution. Some of the reforms in 1920 gave too much power to the Reichstag, while others make it too easy for socialist agitators to spread their ideology among unsuspecting German people. Our control over the Reichstag should allow us to fix these issues safely."

 GER_tactical_social_reforms: "Tactical Social Reforms"
 GER_tactical_social_reforms_desc: "We need to retain the faith of the people to keep them from falling to socialism, much like Bismarck many years ago - we will improve upon the welfare state and grant subsidies to the countryside to maintain their growth and keep the people placated."

 GER_defang_german_liberalism: "Defang German Liberalism"
 GER_defang_german_liberalism_desc: "It is not just social democracy which threatens the Conservative Revolution - certain liberals have grown too aligned with socialists to be left untouched. We must foster the revival of the National Liberalism of the old days, and thus create a more cooperative liberal movement."

 GER_revival_of_german_soul: "Revival of the German Soul"
 GER_revival_of_german_soul_desc: "At last, we can complete the revolution - the failed, mechanistic illusions of liberalism and parliamentarism will be eradicated and an organic system built upon German values will arise in their place. Now is the time for action and revival!"

 GER_empower_staatsrat: "National Representation"
 GER_empower_staatsrat_desc: "The Reichstag shall be replaced with the National Representation, formed out of the professional civil service, grown in local communities where the elite and the most talented will be selected for a lifetime's service to the German Volk. It will have no parties and no divisions."

 GER_revival_of_christianity: "Restoration of Christianity"
 GER_revival_of_christianity_desc: "These modern times have led to a downfall of Christian values, and all virtue as a result. Crime and degeneracy have become a daily sight, all because we have distanced ourselves from our faith and nationality. No more. We shall dedicate our state to faith and virtue as much as we dedicate it to the nation itself."

 GER_natural_elite_rule: "Rule of the Natural Elite"
 GER_natural_elite_rule_desc: "It is a fact of life that those who are the most well educated and the most noble should rule. We must break down the last vestiges of democratic representation and ensure that all positions in the administration are earned through a strict hierarchy of appointments. The German way of life desires such a hierarchy."

 GER_weltwolk: "Weltvolk"
 GER_weltwolk_desc: "The German Volk has always desired to expand and rule - it should not be restrained. The post-Weltkrieg future will see Germany become the unquestioned ruler of greater Europe and the leader of its struggle against enemies far and wide, until it establishes a vast empire."

 GER_permanent_enabling_act: "Permanent Enabling Act"
 GER_permanent_enabling_act_desc: "To institute all of our reforms and ensure that they are never overruled, we must be able to rule by decree. Nobody - neither the representatives below, nor the Kaiser above - will be able to stop our Conservative Revolution."

 GER_schleicher_constitution: "The Schleicher Constitution"
 GER_schleicher_constitution_desc: "Victorious in the Second Weltkrieg, we have earned the adoration of the masses - let's put it to use. We will call an extraordinary session of the Reichstag and approve a number of amendments to the Bismarckian Constitution which will do away with unwanted federalist elements and create a centralised, more powerful German Empire."

 GER_social_role_of_army: "The Social Role of the Heer"
 GER_social_role_of_army_desc: "Our armed forces have always been the backbone and the soul of the Prussian and the German nation. Their function in society is to unite disparate ideas and movements behind a common cause. Now that it is finally in charge, it can make this ideology into a reality."

 GER_mobilisation_of_society: "Mobilisation of Society"
 GER_mobilisation_of_society_desc: "Our Germany is like a regiment always on the march. At every turn, we must rally more resources, bring more soldiers to the army, raise more support for our cause. We must escalate our control over daily life and erode the last limits on our power, for the sake of the Empire."

 GER_spiritual_reconstruction_forces: "The Spiritual Reconstruction Forces"
 GER_spiritual_reconstruction_forces_desc: "Together with heavy industry advocates and the Hugenberg-Group, we will establish the Association for the Promotion of Spiritual Reconstruction Forces - a business association which will finance propaganda and expand control over the media, to ensure that the people hear only what we want them to hear." # Wirtschaftsvereinigung zur Förderung der geistigen Wiederaufbaukräfte

 GER_prussian_socialism: "Preußentum und Sozialismus"
 GER_prussian_socialism_desc: "In truth, the German people are inherently socialistic - not the vile anarchy of the syndicalists or the Marxists, no, but the sense of community, discipline, productivity and self-sacrifice through which they devote their all to their nation. Let us turn this into a tenet of our new regime's ideology. In our new Germany, everyone - business and worker - will work for the common good."

 GER_abolition_of_partisanship: "Abolition of Partisanship"
 GER_abolition_of_partisanship_desc: "Nothing divides society more than political parties - the fact that they only represent a part of society rather than the whole is in their name. We shall finally put an end to this despicable practice - only the Front, which is explicitly not a party, but a union of all German nationalists, can be a representative of the German people."

 GER_state_commissar_system: "The Staatskommissar System"
 GER_state_commissar_system_desc: "It is time to put an end to the weakness that is the federal system. All state governments will be replaced by commissars, much like the one we established in Bavaria after their insurrection. Once these governments are removed by force, we can start merging and disbanding states until we end up with a rational map of powerless state units."

 GER_unity_of_army_and_state: "The Unity of Army and State"
 GER_unity_of_army_and_state_desc: "Even after Schleicher, and if we return power back to civilian Reichskanzlers, we must ensure that the Heer, as the social guide of the state, always retains power over state operations. They must be allowed to veto government actions and Reichskanzler appointments, and society must serve to support the Army."

 GER_disband_bundesrat: "Disband the Bundesrat"
 GER_disband_bundesrat_desc: "The Schleicher Constitution has abolished the Bundesrat, but now we need to finalise the process by moving all of its former duties to the courts and to corporatist representative bodies. We shall never give the states such representation again - that much is certain."

 GER_german_shogunate: ""The Shogunate""
 GER_german_shogunate_desc: "The Kaiser still has theoretical ability to remove us from power and set back our takeover of the state - let us put an end to this threat by forcing him to surrender almost all of his executive power. We will retain the monarchy at the throne, but it will be powerless - all decisions will be done by a sprawling dictatorial clique centred around the National Unity Front, the heirs to Reichskanzler Schleicher."

 GER_second_parliamentarisation_desc: "Victorious in the Second Weltkrieg, we have earned the adoration of the masses - let's put it to use. We shall call forth an extraordinary session of the Reichstag and enact a thorough reform of the Bismarckian Constitution, putting out reformist democratic ideals on paper and turning them into law. Germany shall, henceforth, become a true parliamentary democracy."

 GER_christian_democracy: "Christian Democracy"
 GER_christian_democracy_desc: "The Christian People's Party has won the election. The downfall of Prussian conservatism has turned us into the flagbearer of the new German right - modern and democratic, accepting of economic reform, and founded upon all-Christian ideals. Let us put our agenda into practice."

 GER_christian_unions: "Promote Christian Unions"
 GER_christian_unions_desc: "We must foster the development of CVP-aligned union organisations, not just in the Catholic South and the Rhineland, but also among the Protestants in Saxony and the northern cities. The working class must distance itself away from socialism and align itself with pragmatic conservatism."

 GER_hermes_plan_desc: "Our ideologue on agricultural policy, Andreas Hermes, has drafted a plan on agrarian reform, which includes reorganisation of land ownership in the countryside, promotion of agricultural cooperatives and cooperative banking, and absorption of moderate Protestant organisations into the CVP-aligned VdB. Let us enact his plan to strengthen our control in the countryside."

 GER_social_market_economy: "The Social Market Economy"
 GER_social_market_economy_desc: "Unlike the SPD, we are committed to a market economy, but that doesn't mean that we fall in with the Liberals. The state must maintain a certain amount of intervention to foster healthy competition and prevent monopolies. The ideas of the so-called \"Freiburg School\" are especially interesting in this regard, and we should give them a look."

 GER_combat_socdems_in_labour: "Combat SPD Dominance Among Labour"
 GER_combat_socdems_in_labour_desc: "The unions are the source of the Social Democrats' power, and breaking this source will turn the workers into a competitive electorate once more. Let us support our union wing further and appeal to religious workers in order to reduce the SPD's dominance among the proletariat."

 GER_protect_states_rights: "Defend States' Rights"
 GER_protect_states_rights_desc: "Since the SPD is increasingly positioning itself as the centralist party, we have to assume the federalist niche. The rights of the constituent monarchies must be protected, as they are much closer to local concerns than a distant federal government in Berlin, and we must respect the local histories and traditions of German states."

 GER_second_spd_government: "The Second Mandate"
 GER_second_spd_government_desc: "The Social Democratic Party has won the election once more. The people have given us a second mandate and we will use it to continue the reforms we began and building up a state which cares for all, not just for the wealthy and the privileged."

 GER_finish_welfare_state: "Complete the Welfare State"
 GER_finish_welfare_state_desc: "We must build upon our achievements before the Second Weltkrieg and strengthen the social security system, raise pensions, expand access to healthcare and thus finalise the creation of a welfare state - a system in which capitalism is tempered by a system that cares for the poor and the downtrodden."

 GER_new_social_democracy: "New Social Democracy"
 GER_new_social_democracy_desc: "By now, it has become clear that our days of permanent opposition are over. Leading the German nation for almost a decade, our leaders now see that productive work towards regulated capitalism will lead us farther than vague dreams of revolution. Let us call forth a new Party Conference and draft a new programme, which will remove the last vestiges of Marxist theory from its pages at last and declare that we are a \"people's party\"."

 GER_party_of_governance: "The Natural Party of Governance"
 GER_party_of_governance_desc: "Our enormous size and the proof of our ability to work with the establishment should make us a natural choice for leadership. Established in federal and state level governments for long, our politicians will gather the necessary experience to make the wheels of governance turn faster and more efficiently."

 GER_inquiry_into_bm: "FfW Banking Reforms"
 GER_inquiry_into_bm_desc: "The disaster of Black Monday was one of the worst crises of modern German history and could not have come at a worse time. To prevent future economic failures of this scale, the causes of the crisis have been studied by our friends in the Forschungsstelle für Wirtschaftspolitik and we will legislate their recommendations to stamp out negligence and corruption."

 GER_fight_heer_influence: "Pursue Civilian Control of the Army"
 GER_fight_heer_influence_desc: "In the reforms to the Wilhelmine Constitution, one point we were unable to achieve much progress on was civilian control of the military, yet not all is lost. The Reichskriegsamt is a good start, but we will expand its powers and so bring the Imperial German Army closer and closer in line with the wishes of the civilian government."

 GER_dismantle_prussia: "Prussian Local Government Reform"
 GER_dismantle_prussia_desc: "Prussia's dominance among the German states has long been a headache for reformists in Germany - though we cannot dismantle Prussia, we can get close. Prussia shall be decentralised, regions such as the Rhineland and Hanover will receive local parliaments, and these parliaments will receive a certain number of Prussia's Bundesrat votes which they can use at their own will."

 GER_liberal_resurgence: "The Liberal Resurgence"
 GER_liberal_resurgence_desc: "The Liberale Volkspartei and their allies have won the election. Together, we shall build a Germany where any man - regardless of wealth or status - can thrive."

 GER_emphasise_private_sector: "Emphasise the Private Sector"
 GER_emphasise_private_sector_desc: "One thing that most economists can agree on is that private firms are simply more efficient than state-owned enterprises. Thus it is only natural that we support them: granting subsidies to our most adventuring entrepreneurs will allow the private sector to grow and the economy with it."

 GER_mitteleuropa_as_example: "Mitteleuropa as Example"
 GER_mitteleuropa_as_example_desc: "It was the liberal thinker Friedrich Naumann who laid out the idea for Mitteleuropa, which was put into practice not long after his death. Mitteleuropa has evolved significantly over time, but the free trade it brings is a benefit to all, not just Germany. We must stay involved in efforts to continually expand the responsibilities and duties of the organisation."

 GER_enhance_minority_protections: "Enhance Minority Protections"
 GER_enhance_minority_protections_desc: "Those seeking to undermine our minority Jewish and Polish population have been proven wrong time and time again. Beyond all doubt they have proven their loyalty to Germany and are just as nationally-minded as any other citizen - naturally, they will be rewarded with the same protections and rights as well."

 GER_public_education_grants: "Public Education Grants"
 GER_public_education_grants_desc: "If we are to make a Germany where everyone thrives, then our public schools, which educate millions of Germans, must have the proper means to give everyone a chance. It is disheartening to see that many are left behind because they cannot afford proper education"

 GER_new_social_democracy_two: "The Liberal-Left Alliance"
 GER_new_social_democracy_two_desc: "Cooperation between the LVP and the SPD has always been rather shaky, especially due to the presence of right-leaning industrialists in the former. Thankfully, we still have much in common, as the LVP still retains support for welfare policies and many have worked tirelessly to make the party independent from said industrialists in the long term."

 GER_consolidate_thuringia: "Consolidation of Thuringia"
 GER_consolidate_thuringia_desc: "For too long, Thuringia has been shattered into numerous principalities with their own governments, which stymies the economic growth of the region. Let us put out foot down and order the unification of these states into one Grand Duchy."

 GER_second_weltkrieg_legacy: "Legacy of the Second Weltkrieg"
 GER_second_weltkrieg_legacy_desc: "The Second Weltkrieg, much like the First, was one of the largest and most destructive wars in world history. We have a lot to learn from the new technologies and tactics that were put to the test during the war, as well as rebuild ourselves and all of Europe."

 GER_universal_tanks: "The Universal Panzer"
 GER_universal_tanks_desc: "The race towards the heaviest and most powerful tank has proven to be a design dead-end. Instead of focusing on several different varieties of tanks, we should develop a tank with the speed and firepower to make both medium and heavy tanks obsolete."

 GER_infantry_mechanisation: "Infantry Mechanisation"
 GER_infantry_mechanisation_desc: "Motorised infantry proved itself to be effective during the war, but it is a bit too vulnerable to enemy fire - so, we should consider moving infantry from trucks to armoured personnel carriers which have armour and their own firepower."

 GER_fireteam_tactics: "Fireteam Tactics"
 GER_fireteam_tactics_desc: "Working in small groups and given specific tasks as opposed to large formations commanded by precise orders can drastically expand the efficiency of our infantry units."

 GER_jet_technology: "Develop Jet Aircraft Technology"
 GER_jet_technology_desc: "New advancements in jet engine technology shows promise - as well as guesses that a plane using one may even be able to break the sound barrier. We must invest in this technology and develop a fleet of jet aircraft which will be able to fly circles around our enemies."

 GER_helicopters: "Adoption of Utility Helicopters"
 GER_helicopters_desc: "The first experiments in helicopters, machines using spinning rotors to generate lift and thus being able to take off pretty much off anywhere, took place at the end of the war. We must make use of this technology at haste - it will drastically improve the recon and special ops capabilities of our units."

 GER_modern_carriers: "Supremacy of the Aircraft Carrier"
 GER_modern_carriers_desc: "The war has shown that the old style of naval warfare, based upon heavy ships and the calibre of their guns, is on its way out. The navies of the future shall strike from hundreds of kilometres away with airplanes taking off from carriers. Let us reshape our naval strategies according to this tenet."

 GER_modern_computers: "Civilian Adoption of Computing Technology"
 GER_modern_computers_desc: "The war led to an explosion of progress in computing technology - it may seem ridiculous, but one day, computers may shrink to the point where they are only the size of a wardrobe! We must put computers to use in our universities and research labs to make use of their impressive capabilities."

 GER_nuclear_power: "Civilian Nuclear Power Experiments"
 GER_nuclear_power_desc: "The Uranverein continues their research into the potential of nuclear power. Their research is very promising - yet, the scientists say that it might be usable for more than just bombs. A controlled chain reaction, if possible, would allow the creation of a nuclear reactor - which could, theoretically, provide endless energy for humanity!"

 GER_foster_postwar_growth: "Foster Postwar Growth"
 GER_foster_postwar_growth_desc: "We must turn our reconstruction into new growth - the soldiers returning from the front require new work places, while a surge of war reparations from our defeated enemies should be invested into our economy. Should we be careful, we can create an economic miracle!"

 GER_aid_civilian_shift: "Aid the Shift to Civilian Production"
 GER_aid_civilian_shift_desc: "Many industries shifted to producing material for the Army during the war, but now they must transition back to civilian production. Through tax rebates and subsidies, we can ensure that this process is as painless as possible."

 GER_modern_agriculture: "Combine Harvesters and Pesticides"
 GER_modern_agriculture_desc: "The inefficient agricultural sector in Germany can be uplifted from its malaise through the application of new technology - old farms shall be turned into hyper-productive, modern ones, and Germany shall once again become a breadbasket of Europe."

 GER_pan_european_optimism: "Pan-European Optimism"
 GER_pan_european_optimism_desc: "The Second Weltkrieg was a time of European unification - soldiers from a dozen nations stood side by side, led by Germany, to defend our way of life, tradition and freedom. We must not let these feelings fade - we must ensure that the future of Europe is that of brotherhood and unity, not senseless bloodshed."

 GER_kalterkrieg: "Kalter Krieg"
 GER_kalterkrieg_desc: "The Second Weltkrieg may be won, but the struggle for the fate of the world is not. This time, it will not be fought by arms, though arms we need. The Entente, on the other side of the Atlantic, once again pose a threat to us, but we will not falter..."

 GER_destroy_europe_syndicalism: "Extinguish Syndicalism in Europe"
 GER_destroy_europe_syndicalism_desc: "Germany has cemented itself as the first and foremost fighter against syndicalist intrusion across Europe. Previous blunders allowed socialist movements to prosper and wreak havoc ever since 1925, and like dominoes one country fell to revolution after another. We shall be clear: the same mistake will not be repeated again."

 GER_overthrow_reichspakt_governments: "Enforce Ideological Loyalty in the East"
 GER_overthrow_reichspakt_governments_desc: "Unlike the First Weltkrieg, the Second was a great struggle not just for economic or military supremacy but ideological supremacy as well. Nowhere was this more pronounced than in the west, but in the east things remain much the same as old, with alliances simply based around national security. It is time we change this - our client states in the East shall follow Berlin's ideals."

 GER_overthrow_romania: "Overthrow the Legionary Government"
 GER_overthrow_romania_desc: "Nowhere can a more hostile anti-German government be found than in Romania. We have not forgotten when they nationalised their oil fields almost as soon as the economic crisis hit, and they have since agitated against us and our allies. If they believe they can poke the German eagle with no consequences, so be it - soon they will regret it."

 GER_overthrow_balkans: "Secure the Balkan Region"
 GER_overthrow_balkans_desc: "The Balkans are an area of great strategic value, and having important allies there would bolster our access to the Mediterranean. For some time, this aim has been hindered by governments unwilling to work with Germany, but as the undisputed master of Europe, we will be able to settle such matters."

 GER_restore_suez: "Restore Control over the Suez"
 GER_restore_suez_desc: "The Suez Canal remains the most direct link between European and Asian trade. While for a time it remained open to us, its occupation by foreign powers means that at any time our access could be cut off. Though any of our adversaries may dismay at our seizure of it, we will be ready to defend our interests."

 GER_restore_sudwestafrika: "Into Südwestafrika"
 GER_restore_sudwestafrika_desc: "Southwest Africa has been a German colonial holding for more than half a century, but the collapse of Mittelafrika made it vulnerable to seizure. While it has never been the most profitable colony, it is a matter of pride - and nobody strikes at German pride and gets away with it."

 GER_reclaim_mittelafrika: "Reclamation of Mittelafrika"
 GER_reclaim_mittelafrika_desc: "Just because we have been busy reshaping Europe in our image does not mean we have forgotten about our African holdings.

 GER_invite_african_states: "Align African Minors"

 GER_colonial_rear_guards: "Colonial Rear Guards"
 GER_colonial_rear_guards_desc: "Colonialism is a mission of the German Empire, a great pride of the Reich.

 GER_reclaim_east_asia_desc: "It is an unfortunate matter that opportunist powers sought to strike our Asian holdings when we were fighting in Europe, making it difficult to keep them.

 GER_pacific_war: "War in the Pacific"
 GER_pacific_war_desc: "Japan has gotten cocky. They believe that just because they can kick Russia when it's down, and seize our Asian colonies when we were facing a war on two fronts, that their path is divinely ordaned and they were destined for greatness. Let's completely erase that notion by using their tactics against them: a surprise attack on Okinawa just off the coast of the Home Islands will force them to cower."

 GER_bauer_putsch_claims: "Siegfrieden"
 GER_bauer_putsch_claims_desc: "We will not rest until we completely destroy our enemies East and West. It was the weakness of the parliamentarians, letting France and Russia go scot free, which guaranteed that a Second Weltkrieg will take place. If we win, we will not make the same mistake again."

 GER_black_terror: "The Black Terror"
 GER_black_terror_desc: "Unsurprisingly, our putsch wasn't received well by everyone.

 GER_appeal_to_old_friends_desc: "With the war turning against us, it is becoming clear that we need powerful allies. Perhaps it would be wise to turn to our old allies in [From.GetNameDef] for support? The unity of the Central Powers quickly fell apart at the end of the Weltkrieg, but they remain states generally sympathetic to the protection of monarchism.

 GER_Reichsland_SPD: "Clausula Antiborussica"
 GER_Reichsland_SPD_desc: "The Provincial Landtags of Prussia have been empowered, creating a second layer of federalism in Prussia, and certain states such as Hanover and the Rhineland are able to cast a part of Prussia's votes in the Bundesrat independently from Berlin.

The Weltkrieg made Germany an uncontested World Power, yet things have been going downhill for her since the 1920s. A recessive world economy has dampened the nation's industries while other nations' manufacturing power recovers, and now nationalism grows in the eastern client states, which are starting to drift away from the Reich. In 1936, Germany stands at a crossroads, and already we can see cracks in her mighty empire, as her ancestral enemies are regaining their former strength..."

### Intro Screen ###
 GER_country_intro_header: "The Place in the Sun"
 GER_country_intro_content: "For the past seventeen years, the German Empire has enjoyed its rightful \"place in the Sun\" that was promised by Reichskanzler Bernhard von Bülow. Defeating the Entente in the Weltkrieg, seizing a worldwide colonial empire and earning a flock of satellites in Central Europe, it established itself as the preeminent economic, diplomatic, cultural and military power in Europe, if not the entire planet. From literature to finance, the German language is growing to a new lingua franca, while the word of the Foreign Secretary in Berlin can make entire countries bow, from petty dictatorships in the Americas to warlords on the coast of the Yellow Sea.\n\nThe end of the Weltkrieg saw the final victory of the Parliamentarisation process which began during the war. The Kaiser and the Reichstag prevailed over Ludendorff's ambitions and promulgated the March Reforms to the Bismarckian Constitution, ushering in greater power to the legislature and partial parliamentary control of the Reichskanzler. The two following decades have been marked by a consensus of middle-class liberals, Catholics, and moderate conservatives, and has seen a string of Reichskanzlers seeking to maintain the achievements of the \"March Constitution\".\n\nTimes are changing, however, and this consensus will not last. A few months ago, the \"March Coalition\" between the LVP and Zentrum collapsed, and a fallen government now sits in Berlin. New elections to the Reichstag approach in April, and it is becoming increasingly clear that initiative in parliament will be held not by the Liberals or Catholics, but by the socialists in the SPD, or, possibly, even the hardline conservative bloc of DkP and DVLP. The aging Kaiser and his Crown Prince search for alternate solutions to the deadlock, however, even if it means a death blow to the Empire's democracy...\n\nWhen even the sentinel of the new world order wavers, uncertain of its future, what can the rest of the world do but worry for what's to come?"

 GER_country_intro_header_1: "The End of the Weltkrieg"
 GER_country_intro_content_1: "When the armistice between the remaining Allied powers and the Central Powers was signed on 12 August 1919 in the beautiful castle of Chantilly to the northeast of Paris, the German people rejoiced, realising that the devastating Weltkrieg had finally found an end after 5 years of intense fighting. However, while Germany had ostensibly emerged as the glorious victor of the conflict, the nation was in dire straits. The British naval blockade had caused countless deaths due to starvation and disease, the German forces in the west were war-weary after dozens of bloody offensives into no man's land, and the people on the home front were thirsting for reforms to an outdated political system.\n\nLong-existing tensions had already culminated in the so-called \"September Insurrections\" in 1918, when anti-war strikes escalated into far-left uprisings in various Northern German cities, but these were brought down with extensive military violence; while internal peace could be restored, the influence of the military was clearer than ever before. Minor concessions to the public were made in the form of a slight reform to the Prussian suffrage and the reshuffling of the government cabinet, but nonetheless, the supreme army command (OHL) around Hindenburg and Ludendorff expanded their powers further and further over the following months, more and more sidelining the civilian government — a period colloquially known as the \"Ludendorff Dictatorship\". It was due to their pressure that the controversial unrestricted submarine campaign was relaunched in late 1918 after more than 2 years of semi-successful restricted submarine warfare in accordance with international law, and it was due to their restless lobbying that German diplomats pressed the most far-reaching possible demands out of the war-weary French at the 1919 Versailles peace negotiations, therefore indirectly contributing to the outbreak of the French Civil War soon after.\n\nHowever, as 1920 dawned, the legitimacy of the OHL's far-reaching influence on civilian affairs began to crumble. Calls for reform, elections, the end of wartime censorship and demobilisation became louder. A major political crisis was imminent."

 GER_country_intro_header_2: "Reform and Recovery"
 GER_country_intro_content_2: "The situation escalated in February 1920, when a motion about the long-anticipated reform to the Bismarckian Constitution was placed in the Reichstag, in an effort to finally turn the Empire into a parliamentary monarchy. This move was backed by chancellor Brockdorff and the Kaiser, but harshly opposed by the far-right and the military. In an effort to force the government to abandon the reforms, Ludendorff telegraphed his resignation to the Kaiser, a strategy he had often made use of during the war to achieve his goals, well aware that the Kaiser would never dismiss him in Germany's darkest hour; but this time, things turned out different. Behind Ludendorff's back, the government had entered into talks with Hindenburg and managed to get him on board for their reformist vision in return for generous concessions to the military's autonomy — therefore, Ludendorff was left isolated within the OHL. To his surprise, his resignation was accepted by the Kaiser, and his \"dictatorship\" ended in the most unspectacular way possible.\n\nNot long after Ludendorff's dismissal, far-reaching constitutional reforms were passed in the Reichstag, later known as the \"March Constitution\". While the reforms finally turned Germany into a parliamentary monarchy, they did not end up as far-reaching as especially the SPD had hoped due to compromises with the conservatives; the Kaiser retained his nominal leadership over the armed forces and the right to appoint the chancellor despite the latter's dependency on the confidence of the Reichstag. In late March, the first elections since 1912 took place - a progressive coalition of SPD, FVP and Zentrum formed, with the former Colonial Secretary Wilhelm Solf as a nonpartisan chancellor. Under Solf, order was restored in the Empire: the occupation in the east was lifted in favour of establishing satellites, control was re-asserted over the pre-war colonies as well as the newly-gained possessions in Asia and Africa, stable diplomatic relations with the neighbouring powers, like the Commune of France, the Russian Republic and Britain, were reestablished, and the Mitteleuropa economic bloc was founded."

 GER_country_intro_content_3: "Solf's government fell in 1922 due to disagreements within his cabinet, and he was succeeded by Zentrum politician Matthias Erzberger, who however resigned after only a few months due to a humiliating political scandal. The fall of Erzberger spelt an end to the progressive SPD-FVP-Zentrum coalition and saw the re-emergence of the conservatives, as many Germans were unsatisfied with the new parliamentary leadership in the aftermath of the war; they thought that the new government had abandoned the hard-earned gains from the war for the sake of Germany's international reputation and that they just were not able to present Germany as a strong and assertive power on the global stage. Erzberger was succeeded by the national liberal-conservative cabinet of Posadowsky-Wehner in 1923.\n\nHowever, with the outbreak of the British Revolution in 1924, the next major internal crisis hit the Empire as Foreign Secretary Stresemann accidentally caused a war scare after proposing a military intervention in civil war-plagued Britain — mere weeks later, the next government had fallen and snap elections were held. In the aftermath, the Kaiser decided for a grand coalition under former late wartime chancellor Ulrich von Brockdorff-Rantzau. A known democratic compromiser and master diplomat who was dubbed \"the last Bismarckian\" for a reason, he led Germany into a new golden era: while he did not intervene in Britain, Brockdorff orchestrated the peaceful reorganisation of the unprotected British colonies into the \"Mittelafrika Customs Union\" at a grand colonial conference in Berlin, pressured the Ottomans to intervene in the looming conflict in Iran, signed a far-reaching economic agreement with Russia and ordered the intervention of German colonial forces during the Chinese Northern Expedition after the Yangtze Incident of September 1926. As Britain was left incapaticated due to its revolution and the US faded into the background as a result of the Great Depression, Germany had finally emerged as the world's uncontested hegemon."

 GER_country_intro_header_4: "The Gathering Storm"
 GER_country_intro_content_4: "On 8 September 1928, Brockdorff passed away at age 59. The coalition he had commanded over for most of his tenure, consisting of liberals and moderate conservatives, went down in history as the \"March Coalition\", and remained in power for the next few years under the leadership of Wilhelm Marx and Johann von Bernstorff. Simultaneously, pivotal changes were happening in Germany, both internally and in foreign affairs. Blinded by their \"Golden Era\", the Germans failed to see that they were slowly getting isolated on the global stage. To the west, France had escaped containment and formed a powerful bloc of socialist nations with Britain and Italy, and to the east the revanchist Russians were radicalising further and further, culminating in the election of Boris Savinkov in 1934. The old pre-war fears of \"encirclement\" had returned.\n\nAt home, reorganisations within the various conservative and liberal parties took place to appeal to a broader mass, but mostly to no avail - with the inflexible moderates clinging to the status quo, both the SPD, which had slightly moved to the left again since its exclusion from the Grand Coalition in the mid-20s, and the far-right DVLP, which had long remained a fringe niche party, but had risen to prominence after the ascension of the more inclusionist Ulrich von Hassell to the chairmanship, were growing stronger and stronger.\n\nIn 1934, another crisis brought the fall of the Bernstorff Cabinet, and this time, the Kaiser decided to intervene, hoping to regain some of his old powers that had been vastly limited in 1920. He decided for the appointment of the non-partisan diplomat Herbert von Dirksen, former ambassador to Russia and known yes-man of the Kaiser. From the very beginning, this minority government suffered from severe difficulties to find majorities in the Reichstag and pass laws, but any proposals of getting rid of the chancellor via a vote of no-confidence died down once it became clear that the \"permanent opposition\", DVLP and SPD, would not back said plans, well-aware that it would be more beneficial for them to wait for the approaching elections of 1936, where both parties would surely have prime chances to finally ascend to the government. As 1935 comes to an end, the situation is looking dire for Dirksen, especially with the tumultuous situation in nearby Norway - far-reaching changes lie ahead for the German Empire, that much is certain."

 GER_country_intro_header_5: "The March Constitution"
 GER_country_intro_content_5: "The March Reforms to the Bismarckian Constitution were a compromise between the emboldened reformist legislature and the conservative establishment, but were nonetheless a major step in the direction of true constitutional monarchy in the German Empire. By far the most important reform in the package was that the Reichstag now has the ability to remove the Reichskanzler in a vote of no confidence, or indict them in a constitutional court for vast violations of conduct and duties. Though Reichskanzler appointment was nonetheless vested solely in the Kaiser, he now has to keep the intentions of the Reichstag in mind when choosing his favorites. Depending on whether there was an obvious coalition in the Reichstag or it was fractured, Reichskanzlers have since wavered between partisan politicians and tolerable favorites of the Kaiser.\n\nAdditionally, the Reichskanzler is now responsible for all political actions of the Kaiser, the members of the Reichstag can now simultaneously be members of the government, and declarations of war as well as peace treaties now require the Reichstag's assent. The minimum voting age of 25 was reduced to 21 and redistricting of Reichstag constituencies took place, reducing the power of enlarged rural constituencies and establishing multi-member constituencies in major cities, where partial proportional voting reigns. Finally, though it was implemented a year prior rather than during the March reforms of 1920, the despised three class franchise in Prussia was replaced with a system already tested in Saxony and other constituent German states - plural voting, a system in which each citizen starts with one vote, but can get up to eight votes through fulfilling certain wealth and education qualifications. Though much less imbalanced, it nonetheless helps contain Social Democratic and Liberal momentum in Prussia."

 germany.7.t: "Reichstagswahl 1936"
 germany.7.d: "One after another, moderate chancellors perpetuating the consensus of the March Constitution have ruled the Kaiserreich since 1920. Solf, Erzberger, Posadowsky, Brockdorff-Rantzau, Marx, Bernstorff... That does not mean that there has been no opposition to this consensus, however. A \"Permanent Opposition\" of two parties has been lurking on the sidelines for years, despite their popular appeal. Eyed with suspicion by the Kaiser and the political establishment, they await the end of this consensus with glee. The elections of 1936 may prove to be what they have wanted for so long — a path to power.\n\nOn the left, the Social Democrats had been one of the main champions of the March Reforms and took it as a victory, yet grew increasingly estranged from their liberal-Catholic allies during the 20s. The dream of a SPD Chancellor never came about due to the Kaiser's reluctance, and the end of Brockdorff's Grand Coalition saw the SPD move to the opposition again. A plurality in the Reichstag is their priority, but so is dealing with the worrying growth of the right — if the conservatives take advantage of the fall of the March Coalition, then the democratic rights which the German people finally achieved in 1920 may fall under threat.\n\nThe German Fatherland Party is a party of a new breed of the right — not the agrarian aristocracy of the DkP or the petty one-note politics of the pre-war Anti-Semites, but a party of the radical middle class, the yellow workers and the nationalist masses, officially established in 1919, but born in 1917 as an all-national organisation campaigning for wartime unity. Due to its connections with the Tirpitz Circle, the OHL dictatorship and secret plots to overthrow the Kaiser during the War, it's eyed with suspicion by everyone, be it Wilhelm II or the other parties. But times have changed, and disappointment with the March Coalition can easily benefit the DVLP. Not powerful enough to achieve a majority itself, it will need to build a grand coalition of the right, which will mean compromising some of their \"national revolutionary\" principles - but a step forward is better than no step at all, right?"
 germany.7.a: "Schützt eure demokratischen Volksrechte - wählt SPD!"

 germany.8.t: "Resignation of Reichskanzler Dirksen"
 germany.8.d: "It had been anticipated ever since late last year, but it finally arrived thanks to the Black Monday market crash. Not long after that day in February, Reichskanzler Herbert von Dirksen announced his resignation, offering little comments to the press or to the members of the Reichstag. Though a competent diplomat, Dirksen's composure and character of a vain, pompous aristocrat left him isolated in high politics, and he never managed to shake off the veneer of being a royal appointment, less legitimate than partisan chancellors in the post-March German Empire. His Vice-Chancellor, Heinrich Brüning, refused to seek the Kaiser's appointment as the next Reichskanzler. After the Black Monday crisis, the office became a poisoned chalice.\n\nSeeing little initiative from the parties in the Reichstag, Wilhelm II appointed the current Minister-President of Prussia, Siegfried von Roedern, as the new Reichskanzler. An elder civil servant with years of experience in the Federal and Prussian governments alike, he currently heads a nonpartisan government of the centre and right in Prussia, staffed with right-wing politicians and nonpartisan professionals. Though his government is not planning to survive the April election, it has a lot on his plate regardless.\n\nRoedern's preference is to assemble a nonpartisan emergency cabinet, staffed mainly by civil servants he relied upon in Prussia, and promulgate emergency economic controls. This Prussian lockdown of the federal government is bound to go poorly with the states, however. An alternative approach would be to keep Brüning as Vice-Chancellor and work with the Reichstag - Brockdorff could forge a Grand Coalition after the dramatic 1924 elections, so perhaps Roedern can replicate the same feat?"
 germany.8.a: "Germany needs a responsible cabinet above party politics."
 germany.8.b: "Perhaps Roedern can restore the grand Coalition?"

 germany.9.t: "Deadlock in the Bundesrat"
 germany.9.d: "The formation of Roedern's nonpartisan government was taken as an affront by Germany's numerous federal states, especially the south — Bavaria, Württemberg and Baden viewed the formation of a government dominated by Prussian officials with extreme suspicion. Their governments, mainly led by Zentrum and the LVP, also did not appreciate their respective parties being shut out of the government by the Reichskanzler. The result was that in the Bundesrat, Germany's upper house composed of representatives of its member states, a hostile majority has formed against the Reichskanzler, composed of the Southern states and numerous minor states who have joined in protest against the Reichskanzler.\n\nThough Zentrum and the LVP led the attack against the Reichskanzler, it was the SPD who benefitted in the election polls the most. Their campaign and Reichstag delegation took advantage of the political drama to protest the \"bureaucratisation of the government\" and the growing trend of lacking Reichskanzler accountability to the Reichstag - which spells out the necessity for further democratic reform in the Empire."
 germany.9.a: "At this point, will we even find a government come April...?" # The nonpartisan government excluded SPD and so SPD grows

 germany.10.t: "March Coalition Falls Again"
 germany.10.d: "Reichskanzler Roedern only enjoyed a majority in the Reichstag for a very short amount of time. Even though he presided over a diverse coalition of liberals, Catholics, and conservatives in Prussia for years, his skills were non-applicable on the national level - ultimately, his efforts to revive the March Coalition turned out fruitless.\n\nThe LVP and Zentrum delegations in the Prussian House of Representatives are known for being much more conservative than their national counterparts, with the liberals being strongly influenced by National Liberalism and the Prussian Zentrum being dominated by right-wing agrarians such as Franz von Papen. In the Reichstag, however, little consensus could be found between the liberals and the Catholics on the one side and the conservative right on the other. After a few failed inter-faction meetings on fiscal reform and work creation programmes, the LVP finally withdrew from the coalition, denying the Reichskanzler his majority.\n\nThe DVLP capitalised upon the situation in the Reichstag and took advantage of it in their electoral campaign, denouncing \"divided partisanship which paralyses the German government while millions suffer\", and demanding \"a government of action, not words, ruling by strength, not committee\". As the current government is indeed paralysed, these calls have resonated with many across the nation."
 germany.10.a: "At this point, will we even find a government come April...?" # DVLP finds easy prey for propaganda, calling partisanship weak

 germany.11.t: "City Council Elections in Berlin"
 germany.11.d: "The term of the incumbent mayor of Berlin, Heinrich Sahm, is set to expire, and a new election is thus slated to be held by the Berlin city council. A technocratic independent, Sahm served as the mayor of several other cities in the past before moving to Berlin, and is generally supported by the local liberal and conservative deputies. The political upheaval after Black Monday gives an opportunity for the Berlin Social Democrats to win elections to the city council and appoint one of their own - Otto Ostrowski, current mayor of the Prenzlauer Berg borough of Berlin.\n\nOstrowski is seen as a member of the left wing faction of the SPD, and a victory for him would signal a significant change in Berlin politics. It would also be a bellwether of the nation's turn to the left and empower Social Democratic activity in other cities. Because of this, LVP and DkP have joined forces in Berlin, seeking to keep Sahm in power and return a victory for the right and centre. Once the election comes and passes, the result is..."
 germany.11.a: "Heinrich Sahm wins another term."
 germany.11.b: "Otto Ostrowski is elected Mayor of Berlin."

 germany.12.t: "On Ecumenism"
 germany.12.d: "Zentrum has seen better days. Since the end of the Weltkrieg, the party has helped to form all 10 cabinets, whether to the left, right, or centre, - a strategy that has left it sorely unprepared for these times of polarisation, as it now struggles to keep its voters away from the SPD, DVLP, and upstart agrarian parties. Under these conditions, the party's ruling cadre has begun to waver. Zentrum's current chairman, Theodor von Guérard, has served for the last 5 years with an eye on managing the party's various factions - but he has indicated that, should Zentrum be pushed from power in the coming elections, he will retire from his position.\n\nThe news has put the entire party on manoeuvres, and the first blow has come from the right flank. Heinrich Held, the Bavarian Minister-President, has published an article in the Kölnische Volkszeitung on the party's future, in which he calls not only for a stronger commitment to regional and conservative issues, but for the party to reach out to Protestant voters willing to defend both. In throwing the glove forth, Held revisits one of the party's most contentious debates - over time, many rightists and trade unionists have entertained the idea of taking Zentrum \"out of the tower\": transforming it from a purely Catholic party to an all-Christian people's party. In their eyes, such a party could unite middle-class, working-class, and rural interests and provide a bulwark against the growing left. Held's remarks on Christian unity have been echoed by leading trade unionist Adam Stegerwald, who many believe to be the frontrunner to succeed von Guérard.\n\nThe party's progressives watch these developments with concern. In recent years, the left flank have championed the Catholic nature of Zentrum out of fear that Protestant votes would draw the party to the right - and indeed, both Held and Stegerwald have suggested overtures to the DkP and even more rightward parties. The strongest rebuttal to Held's article has come from leading Baden progressive Joseph Wirth, who argues that such adventures risk the party's position in the centre and the trust of their Catholic electorate at a critical time. Whether Wirth's words will be heeded is an open question."
 germany.12.a: "This is not the time to be exposing ourselves to such risk."
 germany.12.b: "Held has a point - the party must reach out from the tower to survive."

 germany.13.t: "Democratic Union Formed"
 germany.13.d: "Reorganisation is taking place among the German parties, as the social democratic SPD and liberal LVP have announced an official agreement on cooperation in the 1936 Reichstag elections. The agreement, made between Hermann Müller and Erich Koch, the respective party chairmen, entails joint candidates in key constituencies and common policies the two parties will push to relieve the effects of the Black Monday crisis in the next Reichstag. These policies include banking reform, public works and other employment measures. In addition, both parties have professed their loyalty to the achievements of the March Reforms of the Constitution and their dedication to defending them from encroaching conservatives, hence the name \"Demokratische Union\" (Democratic Union)\n\nBefore and during the Weltkrieg, the Progressive People's Party (FVP) was a close ally of the SPD and persistently ended up in its shadow, and the unification of the liberal parties into the LVP was seen as a way how to escape this shadow and allow German liberalism to become a powerful force in its own right. The LVP's decision to restore the alliance with SPD thus shows that ultimately, they were unable to avoid their fate as a secondary power..."
 germany.13.a: "Together for a democratic German Empire!"

 germany.14.t: "Black-White-Red Front Formed"
 germany.14.d: "Reorganisation is taking place among the German parties, as long suspected collaboration between the conservative agrarian DkP and the far-right DVLP has been officially announced by their chairmen, Kuno von Westarp and Ulrich von Hassell. This agreement entails raising joint candidates in key constituencies and a common chancellor nominee for the upcoming elections. In an official statement, both parties have described the alliance as a necessary measure to "defend the German banner from ceaseless partisanship and societal decline", reflected in the alliance name - \"Schwarz-Weiß-Rot\" (Black-White-Red), the colours of the Imperial flag.\n\nThe left has already criticised the duplicity of this alliance of convenience. Since 1923, the DkP has been involved in every government without interruption and epitomises the partisan establishment that the DVLP claims to be fighting against. Earlier right-wing cooperation had failed to materialise throughout the 20s and 30s due to leadership disagreements and the overlapping voting blocs of the two parties, as well as the DkP's convenient position within the March Coalition. The altered political climate post-Black Monday, however, has led to a change of mind - old hurdles fade away as closer links between the old conservative establishment and the radical nationalist opposition are being forged..."
 germany.14.a: "All for renewing the German spirit!"

 germany.15.t: "Neue Wirtschaft"
 germany.15.d: "Having earned the attention of the public with his accurate prediction of the Black Monday stock market crash, Walther von Rathenau has not stopped there. Instead, in the aftermath of the Black Week and the onset of the greatest economic crisis Germany has faced since the Weltkrieg, he has published an 11 page document for a full scale reform of the economic system. This document has been proliferated across parties and major newspapers. Those well read could tell that this document was a summary and somewhat moderate implementation of Rathenau's ideas in his 1919 work, \"Neue Wirtschaft\" (The New Economy), and mirror the economic reforms he pursued during the Solf and Erzberger governments as Secretary of the Economy.\n\nA firm believer in his economic programme, Rathenau believes that Black Monday is the perfect opportunity to pursue a full economic reform. The powers of the government in economic management must be greatly expanded and wartime offices for the control of economic affairs and distribution of resources must be restored, as permanent institutions. Rathenau sees economic planning as compatible with the free market — state intervention will be able to harmonise the market, prevent waste of resources, and most importantly, combat the alienation of millions of factory workers employed in dull, mundane jobs across Germany.\n\nWhile he does not propose it in his economic programme (yet), Rathenau dreams of a utopian, classless society which will free workers from soulless labour. The mundanity of work cannot be resolved with socialist promises of wage raises or shorter hours — a complete restructuring is necessary. Through a panacea, \"Arbeitsausgleich\" (equalisation of work), menial and mental workers would switch offices for factories and factories for offices, a few hours every day, and would be able to find their calling somewhere in a vast society of choice. Classes would dissolve, all work would be open according to talent, and mundanity of work would cease.\n\nBut for now, economic planning will suffice."
 germany.15.a: "Interesting programme..."

 germany.16.t: "Federalist Bloc"
 germany.16.d: "Finding themselves under increasingly greater competition, Zentrum branches in competitive regions, such as Silesia, Westphalia and Hanover, have been struggling to maintain their ground against popular Social Democratic and right-wing candidates. To alleviate this disparity, Zentrum candidates and party branches have begun independently making deals with local parties to unite behind a common candidate in competitive districts and thus increase their chances of victory.\n\nIn Hanover, Zentrum has renewed its historic cooperation with the German-Hanoverian Party, commonly known as the Guelph Party (Welfen). A regionalist political party created after the annexation of the Kingdom of Hanover, it generally sat with Zentrum in the prewar Reichstag, however, the postwar years have seen it experience a sharp decline. The Guelph conservative federalism has struggled in the postwar environmment and losing their last lease of life might just prove to be the end of the party.\n\nOn the other side of the Empire, Zentrum members in Posen have begun expanding their collaboration with Polish autonomists, particularly those closer to the ChZJN in Poland proper. Unlike in Hanover, the Polish ethnic constituency has not lost its potency, although it still needs to compete with anti-Polish electoral pacts in mixed constituencies. For them, much like for the Welfen, Zentrum is a natural ally, as they are both ideologically conservative and concerned with maintaining the federal model of the state, with hope of decentralising it further, against centralist encroachment from the left and the right alike. Not everyone in Zentrum subscribes to the idea of tagging along with a flock of weak minor parties, however."
 germany.16.a: "Support these pacts. Zentrum defends federalism!"
 germany.16.b: "We do not need them to hold our ground."

 germany.17.t: "Hugenberg Group's Propaganda Drive"
 germany.17.d: "Alfred Hugenberg, 2nd Chairman of the DVLP, is among the Fatherland Party's most prominent faces, below only Ulrich von Hassell. Though his position is largely symbolic, a token compromise made to the party's reactionary old guard after Hassell's rise to power in 1929, he commands a notable clique within the DVLP and keeps it alive through his considerable wealth. As one of Germany's most powerful businessmen and press barons, Hugenberg is in charge of the gigantic "Hugenberg Group", a media empire controlling newspapers, publishers and advertising agencies across the Empire - their papers sell hundreds of thousands of copies and hold considerable sway on public opinion. Of course, their articles are biased towards Hugenberg's preferred beliefs, rabid anti-Socialism and anti-Semitism.\n\nThe 1936 electoral campaign has given the DVLP hope that they can position themselves as the leader of an all-right coalition in the Reichstag after the election, so the party's central committee has requested a mass propaganda drive from the 2nd Chairman. An aggressive promotion campaign for the Münchner Neueste Nachrichten and Der Tag, expansion of the Telegraphen-Union news agency and promotion of their articles to more and more newspapers, perhaps even a few movie deals - all could serve to form the desired image of the old Party of Tirpitz out there.\n\nWhere should the resources of the campaign be concentrated, however? Focusing on the Illustrierte Nachtausgabe and cutting deals with urban newspapers will improve the DVLP's chances to win the middle class in the cities and cut down social democratic growth - on the other hand, the Telegraphen-Union has fostered good relations with independent rural news outlets, and investing more in this relationship will aid the conservative cause in the Prussian countryside."
 germany.17.a: "We have a real chance of winning the urban districts."
 germany.17.b: "Invest more in rural news outlets."

 germany.18.t: "Rising Worker Militancy"
 germany.18.d: "It had been anticipated ever since the February market crash, but it has now become clear - the breakdown of the German economy has greatly bolstered the far left of the political spectrum. Socialist propaganda has swept up thousands of workers across the nation, offering an easy answer to the confusion of many workers thrown out of their job because of factors they could not control. It is because the illusion of prosperity that the bourgeoisie, the Junkers and the Kaiser at the top maintained has shattered - the final hour of international capitalism is at hand, so make sure to stand in line and hoist the red flag!\n\nThe German far left parties are generally small and fractured, and though they are not banned, they are only somewhat tolerated by the political establishment. After years of splits and reunions, the Communist Workers' Party of Germany (KAPD) has garnered most of the socialist share. Though supportive of French-style syndicalism, the KAPD holds some reservations, believing that trade unions in Germany have become hopelessly reformist and so the revolutionary vanguard must be factory councils of workers - hence, \"council communism\". The Communist Party of Germany (KPD) is also prominent, distinguished by the fact that they participate in electoral politics, unlike their cousins.\n\nIn spite of bad blood between the numerous factions of the far left, they find the strength to cooperate from time to time - and today is one of those cases. The KAPD, KPD and their aligned trade unions are planning a mass demonstration in Berlin on International Workers' Day, May 1st, and expect to be joined by similar events in the Rhineland and Saxony."
 germany.18.a: "This is not good..."

 germany.19.t: "Blutmai"
 germany.19.d: "In response to growing militancy of the German workers and citing previous sporadic cases of violence during the electoral campaign, the police force of Berlin issued a ban on open-air political gatherings in the city during May 1, aiming to prevent the planned May Day demonstrations. This did not deter far left activists, however, and even emboldened some — these restrictions appeared to affirm the official party line of the KAPD that capitalism has entered its Third Period, and so will respond to workers' movements with more and more draconian force.\n\nDemonstrations took place across the city, rough tallies of the numbers showed that threats of police violence balanced out the growing socialist membership, meaning that the size of the KAPD and KPD gatherings were hardly larger than normal. Still, Berlin Police responded with force, sending out flying squads and attacking with truncheons wherever demonstrations were reported. Even the lawful conventions, such as SPD and liberal trade union assemblies, were mistaken for socialist protests and attacked. Street combat broke out in the socialist-dominated Wedding district, but it was one-sided and only served to escalate police response — live rounds were fired upon KAPD demonstrations and over thirty people were killed by the end of the day. Around 200 were injured and 1200 were arrested by the police.\n\nDistribution of Kommunistische Arbeiter-Zeitung was curtailed in the aftermath to suppress the casualty numbers, but the message spread across the nation nonetheless, and further inflamed friction between the government and the labour movement. The events were largely viewed positively by the right wing of the Reichstag, while the liberals and SPD were more divided — in particular, while the SPD newspaper Vorwärts produced a scathing piece stating that the KAPD was \"seeking to intentionally sacrifice supporters' lives\", the Social Democratic delegation in the Reichstag officially protested the actions of Berlin policemen and demanded an investigation.

 germany.20.t: "Work Creation Plans in the ADGB"
 germany.20.d: "The economic crisis has sparked discussions across various ideological circles and associations — the traditional consensus among German economists has failed, or, at least, is no longer being trusted by the average worker and politician. Witnessing millions being thrown to the streets and dozens of banks collapsing overnight, parties, associations and trade unions now look towards the government for potential salvation. That state intervention may help drive up demand and reinvigorate the economy during the financial cycle has been contemplated during the interwar period and these ideas have only gained more traction since Black Monday.\n\nThe journal of the General German Trade Union Federation (ADGB), Die Arbeit, has opened discussion on what they have named \"active economic policy\" after the publication of a political economic programme by the trade unionists Fritz Tarnow and Fritz Baade. This plan, titled the "Tarnow-Baade Plan" after its creators, posits the creation of massive public works which could employ up to one million people across the Empire, as well as tighter banking controls which would allow an extensive inflationary policy. According to Tarnow and Baade, work creation and fiscal inflation will provide relief for the poor and drive up demand, solving the downfall.\n\nThough the ADGB is closely allied with the SPD, the party has actually distanced itself from the Tarnow-Baade Plan. Otto Wels and Rudolf Hilferding have both criticised the ADGB for its direct intervention in politics, which should be delegated solely to the party, and for Tarnow and Baade's intentions to "play doctor at the bedside of capitalism". Undeterred, the trade unionists have been making waves across the press nonetheless, and earned the surprising endorsement of the Prussian Minister of War, Kurt von Schleicher, who described work creation as \"the only way out of today's plights\"."

 germany.21.t: "Outbreaks of Antisemitic Violence"
 germany.21.d: "The beginning of the economic crisis sparked by the Black Monday market crash has given fuel to antisemitic agitation and even a handful of outbreaks of violence across Germany. In local legislatures, right-wing deputies, generally those belonging to the DVLP, have proposed taxation on Jewish businesses or boycotts of Jewish goods, while Jewish citizens in the cities have had to cope with suspicion and constant libel from right-wing newspapers.\n\nThe Jewish population of Germany has historically been more integrated than their peers in the former Russian Empire, and have gifted Germany with numerous scientists, politicians, cultural figures and war veterans — however, suspicion and mistreatment of them remains to this day. The Black Monday market crash was difficult to comprehend for many German citizens, and decades of propaganda espousing an \"international Jewish financier conspiracy\" did not make it difficult for the most downtrodden to connect these two events, thus claiming that the German Jews were somehow responsible for the market crash. Aggressive DVLP agitation during the 1936 electoral campaign, which often played upon these antisemitic fears, helped escalate them even further.\n\nThe Jewish population is not completely helpless, however. Organisations such as the Centralverein have consistently fought antisemitism in Germany through legal means, and they have already begun documenting and reporting instances of this outbreak, while providing support for Jewish citizens who have been defamed or were injured by antisemitic attacks."

Negotiations between Papen and Martin Spahn were successful, and Papen pledged the loyalty of not just himself, but also his allies in Bavaria and the other Southern Catholic states.\n\nThis is a considerable victory for the Schwarz-Weiß-Rot coalition, who have already scored several high profile endorsements and actively push for their chance to launch a \"Conservative Revolution\"..."

After many years of aimless leadership under the moderate Rhenish wing, two mediocre election results in 1931 and 1936, and the collapse of several government cabinets with Zentrum participation over the course of the last few years, Zentrum chairman Theodor von Guérard has officially announced his retreat from the leadership of his party. A party conference, the first in many years, is due to be called in the near future, and politically interested observers are convinced that it will be one of fierce party-internal confrontations. Throughout the last decade, new factions within Germany's oldest political party have sprung up like mushrooms and are willing to seize power and lead the party onto a new political course, but the question will be, what political wing will come out on top?"

 germany.25.t: "The Zentrum Party Conference Nominates Stegerwald"
 germany.25.d: "This week, Zentrum convenes its party conference in the city of Essen in the heart of the Ruhr, a known hotbed of the powerful Christian trade union movement. Quite fittingly, the board has already nominated a candidate that comes from a trade union background and who, according to observers, has an undeniably high chance of winning — Adam Stegerwald, the most influential representative of the party's labour wing for several decades and, since recently, the leader of the Zentrum parliamentary faction in the Reichstag.\n\nHowever, while Stegerwald enjoys enormous influence and sway within Zentrum's party board, parliamentary faction and among the Christian trade unions, he is viewed with scepticism by the church, Catholic interest groups and middle class organisations, who fear that Stegerwald might be too divisive and not a proper leading figure for one of the Empire's most diverse parties. His opponents perceive him as power-hungry and anti-clerical, and his questionable support for Reichskanzler Schleicher's \"Querfront\" concept has made him many enemies. Thus, many Zentrum delegates at the conference loudly demand that Stegerwald should only be able to run for chairman under one condition: he has to resign as parliamentary leader in the Reichstag. Will the trade union behemoth negotiate with his opponents under these circumstances?"
 germany.25.a: "Stegerwald offers to negotiate."

 germany.26.t: "Attack of the Unions"
 germany.26.d: "To the surprise of many, Stegerwald has proven himself willing to make concessions to his party-internal opponents. However, a harsh protest of the United Federation of Christian Trade Unions and the trade union-aligned representatives in the Zentrum party board has put an end to these negotiations before they could even start. In their eyes, the broad opposition against Stegerwald's leading role within the party is nothing less than a serious affront to the German working class. Thus, the trade unions have announced to refuse any kind of further cooperation as long as \"the demands of the Christian working class remain unheard\". Stegerwald himself has also been harshly criticised by some of his own associates for being weak enough to even consider negotiating with his enemies in the first place - the situation for Stegerwald and the party itself is looking increasingly dire.\n\nTo mediate between the entrenched fronts, the less anti-clerical and interconfessional Catholic Working Associations have agreed to broker a compromise. They claim that the scepticism towards Stegerwald is not an affront to the working class, but a natural reaction to Stegerwald's power-hungry behaviour. As a solution, they advocate for the establishment of a compromise triumvirate leadership, consisting of Stegerwald, their own candidate Josef Joos, and the moderate Rhenish party leader Hugo Mönnig. Such a constellation would leave Stegerwald in charge of the parliamentary faction, but drastically weaken his influence within the party board."

Earlier this day, an altered version of the triumvirate plan was planned with a replacement candidate for Stegerwald plus Joos and Mönnig, but the project was shot down by a powerful front of younger candidates. Multiple reasons are named against it, among them that a triumvirate would be against the traditions of the party, and the fact that the unassertive leadership that was already a problem under Guérard would remain an issue without a decisive leader. Instead, the delegates have brought forward a motion in which they demand an immediate vote on the future chairman without any compromise constellations, which was approved by a slight majority.\n\nWith Stegerwald out of the race, Joos remains as the sole representative of the trade union wing. Despite being initially reluctant about running solo, well-aware of his lacking charisma, Joos eventually accepted his nomination, and the moderate Mönnig soon after followed suit. To the surprise of many, another faction also began to make its move - emboldened by both Mönnig's and Joos' comparably low popularity, the conservative federalist-minded delegates from the constituent states of Bavaria, Alsace-Lorraine and Luxemburg decide to nominate the Bavarian Finance Minister Fritz Schäffer, a young political firebrand, pious Catholic and proud Bavarian with rightist tendencies, with whom they hope to appeal to the more traditionalist, agrarian and middle class-oriented delegates at the conference while stealing the votes of Mönnig. With the trade unionists severely weakened after Stegerwald's disqualification and the Rhenish moderates more unpopular than ever, the rightists should have good chances to win the vote."

 germany.28.t: "The Triumvirate is Rejected"
 germany.28.d: "Even though Stegerwald accepted the counter-proposal of the Catholic Working Associations and has proven himself willing to join a triumvirate with Joos and Mönnig, the plan has been shot down by a front of younger delegates before it could even be properly initiated. Multiple reasons are named against it, among them that a triumvirate would conflict with the traditions of the party, which always has been led by one leader and not several, and the fact that a multi-member leadership would continue to suffer from the unassertive leadership that was a problem under Guérard.\n\nInstead, the delegates demanded an immediate vote on the future chairman without any compromise constellations, which was approved by a slight majority. These new circumstances massively complicate the search for a truly non-decisive party chairman - Stegerwald is more than convinced to remain in the race and claim the chairmanship for himself, but his most promising competitor from the initial triumvirate plan, the progressive trade unionist Joseph Joos, announced the withdrawal of his bid soon after, well aware that he wouldn't have a chance against Stegerwald on his own due to his lacking charisma. This means that, apart from Stegerwald, only Mönnig remained in the race, who is hardly considered to have a high chance of winning due to his similarity to Guérard.\n\nHorrified by Stegerwald's strong standing against Mönnig, the conservative federalist-minded delegates from Bavaria, Alsace-Lorraine and Luxemburg have made their move as well. They nominate Bavarian Finance Minister Fritz Schäffer, a young political firebrand, pious Catholic and proud Bavarian with rightist tendencies, and hope to appeal to the traditionalist, agrarian and middle class-oriented delegates at the conference. While it's true that Schäffer has higher winning chances than Mönnig, the fact that now two conservative representatives are running against Stegerwald could play into the trade unionists' hand."

 germany.29.t: "The Compromise Chairmanship"
 germany.29.d: "The chairman elections are over, the votes have been counted — and the result is shocking. The votes are almost equally split between the three candidates, with Stegerwald and Schäffer outpassing the moderate Mönnig only by a few votes. The worst case scenario has occurred. Technically, such a result would mean that a second voting round needs to be conducted, however, that would likely result in a more than controversial \"Kampfkandidatur\", a direct confrontation between two popular candidates in which both sides have very high chances of winning. The party board is firmly opposed to that, fearing that a head-to-head face-off between two highly-influential wings of the party could tear Zentrum apart, especially as regionalist tendencies play a very pronounced role in this competition.\n\nThus, after lengthy negotiations and loud protest by the younger delegates, Stegerwald, Schäffer and Mönnig agreed on a not very glorious compromise solution - an altered version of the initial triumvirate plan. Stegerwald will remain in charge of the parliamentary faction, while the party chairmanship will be taken over by a shared leadership of moderates and federalist conservatives. This constellation weakens the trade unionists' influence substantially, to the delight of their opponents, but leaves Stegerwald's far-reaching power in the Reichstag unchecked. All in all, this can only mean one thing - Zentrum will continue its unassertive and inconsistent course in the near future."
 germany.29.a: "How long can such a course last?"

 germany.30.t: "Declaration of the Kampfkandidatur"
 germany.30.d: "In an emotional speech, Stegerwald has officially rejected any kind of concession to his opponents, under thundering applause from his supporters; in his words, the party leader of the future needs to retain full command over both the chairmanship and the parliamentary faction, otherwise Zentrum is bound to continue its feeble course and will be reduced to a second fiddle in German party politics. Naturally, however, Stegerwald's stance has evoked even greater hostility among his opponents, escalation is imminent.\n\nThis morning, a strong united front of middle class and church representatives, and delegates from the particularist-minded states of Bavaria, Luxembourg and Alsace-Lorraine has formed to challenge the ambitious trade unionists in a direct confrontation, a so-called \"Kampfkandidatur\", a party leadership race in which both sides have high chances to win. Since the end of the war, the Zentrum party organisations in Munich, Straßburg and Luxemburg have maintained far-reaching autonomy which they are more than willing to defend — the ever-growing influence of the Christian trade unions could harm these achievements, and thus resistance to Stegerwald's rise is rampant.\n\nTheir vision is the nomination of a shared leadership of representatives from all major Catholic constituent states under the lead of the firebrand Bavarian Minister of Finance Fritz Schäffer, who, as a pious Catholic and proud Bavarian with rightist tendencies, would perfectly symbolise a return to a more traditionalist, federalist and middle class-oriented course. The party board, however, is not happy at all about these plans, fearing that a direct confrontation between two highly-influential wings of the party could tear the entire Zentrum apart, especially as regionalist tendencies play a too pronounced role. Their counter-proposal is a \"triumvirate of compromise\" against Stegerwald consisting of the Rhenish moderate Hugo Mönnig, the progressive trade union leader Josef Joos, and the moderately rightist compromise candidate Heinrich Brüning, the former Vice Chancellor."

 germany.31.t: "The Progressive Gambit"
 germany.31.d: "The federalists have rejected the board's counter-proposal and are determined to stick to their shared leadership plan with representatives from Prussia, Luxembourg, Alsace-Lorraine and Bavaria, in which Schäffer would take a prominent leading role. Now, direct confrontation is unavoidable, and the future of the entire party could be at stake after the upcoming chairman elections, which are likely to become the most controversial in the entire history of the Zentrum. However, to the surprise of many, a relatively obscure faction of the party has capitalised upon this tense stand-off for their own benefit: the progressive Catholics. This wing stands in the tradition of Matthias Erzberger and dominated the party leadership during the Weltkrieg and the early twenties, up until its disgraceful downfall following the Erzberger-Helfferich Trial of late 1922.\n\nEver since, the progressives have been largely sidelined by moderates, rightists and trade unionists - but now, their time to shine again has seemingly arrived, as when two people quarrel, the third usually rejoices. In a speech full of conciliatory rhetoric, Joseph Wirth, formal leader of the progressives in the Reichstag, has suggested the nomination of the Silesian Zentrum prelate Carl Ulitzka as a neutral candidate of compromise. According to Wirth, Ulitzka stands above petty economic, federal or class interests as a cleric and would be the perfect guiding figure for the party - his election would emphasise the general Catholic worldview of the party instead of the interests of one particular wing. Wirth's suggestion is wholeheartedly embraced by the party board, which believes that the nomination of a third neutral candidate could alleviate the tensions of a two-candidate Kampfkandidatur. What many delegates are, however, unaware of, is that Ulitzka is far from being as politically neutral as Wirth claims due to his ties with the progressives, making him practically a Trojan Horse of a political faction that has long been perceived as dead in the water."

With an absolute majority, the compromiser Carl Ulitzka has left his powerful yet controversial opponents Stegerwald and Schäffer in the dust. This means that an actual cleric has ascended to the position of party chairman for the first time in Zentrum history. Ulitzka's election is also the first major score for the long-sidelined progressive Catholics in over a decade. With Ulitzka at the helm, it is likely that the party will pursue a more left-leaning course than in previous years, as Ulitzka is a known advocate for closer cooperation with both the social democrats and the left-leaning liberals.\n\nIn his native Silesia, Ulitzka has been a popular yet controversial representative of his party for over 15 years. He is famous for his almost revolutionary stance on German-Polish reconciliation, much to the dismay of the nationalist Upper Silesian Polish Party leader Adalbert Korfanty and the local German conservatives, and firmly believes that Zentrum has more in common with the left-leaning democratic parties than with the political right with whom his party has long maintained a government coalition in the Prussian Landtag — according to the motto \"Against the Right we must defend our religion; with the Left, our differences are merely ideological.\" The future role of Stegerwald in the party is yet to be determined. According to Zentrum party officials, it is likely that he will stay in charge of the parliamentary faction for the near future - but at some point, the victorious progressives will surely make their move and further centralise power in accordance with the wishes of the younger delegates."

However, almost immediately after, the plan has been shot down by a front of younger delegates. Multiple reasons speak against it, among them that a triumvirate would be against the traditions of the party, and the fact that a multi-member leadership would mean that the unassertive leadership that has been a problem for years would remain an issue.

This means that, apart from Stegerwald, only the moderate Mönnig remains in the race, who is hardly considered to have a high chance of winning due to his similarity to Guérard. The right, however, soon found themselves struck by disaster, to the surprise of many. The short-lived acceptance of the compromise triumvirate plan created an open conflict in the right wing, with Southern German and Prussian representatives suddenly at each other's throats. The Bavarians accuse the group around Brüning, who is now supposed to run as the rightist solo candidate, of having made a pact with the party board for opportunistic and selfish motives in order to secure North German dominance. To an outsider, the conflict might seem silly and ridiculous, but it appears to have substantially weakened the party's right wing -  at what cost?"

Despite initial difficulties, the Christian trade unionist Adam Stegerwald stands victorious over his moderate and rightist contenders by a considerable margin. In the end, a bad case of crippling factionalism has paralysed the rightists at the worst possible moment and paved the way for the labour wing's glorious victory. For Stegerwald, this victory is proof that it was worthwhile to stand firm in the face of his opponents' demands. In accordance with the wishes of the younger delegates, he will now seize virtually unrestricted control over both the Reichstag faction and the chairmanship. In the Reich Chancellery, this news will certainly be received with great delight — the Christian trade unions are considered main supporters of Schleicher's vision and are more than willing to finally bridge the gap between left and right for the benefit of the German working class.\n\nStegerwald's own political views, on the other hand, are relatively elusive and flexible. Although in essence positive about Schleicher, like many of his fellow trade unionists, he still harbours a certain scepticism due to Schleicher's dubious military past. Stegerwald's pragmatism enables fruitful cooperation with practically every party from the SPD to the DVLP, but his ideal conception of the Zentrum is undoubtedly located in the political centre. The idea of an interconfessional \"German, Christian, national and social people's party\", which would form a bulwark for the interests of the patriotic, religious and deeply monarchist middle and working classes and at the same time weaken the rise of the Marxist parties and trade unions, has played a major role in his vision for a long time. Only the future will show at what point Stegerwald's flexibility will reach its limits."

 germany.35.d: "The chairman elections are over, the votes have been counted, and the final result is ready to be announced to the public. As expected, Schäffer and his conservative, federalist-minded associates managed to beat Joos and Mönnig by quite an edge. In a grandiose speech earlier this day, he stressed that in times of a globally emerging left and other radicals, a conservative Catholic party of the political centre is more important than ever. Germany's traditional federalist order must be defended against the unitarist enemies lurking both at home and abroad. Thus, one of his main goals is to place greater emphasis on the federalist roots of the Zentrum; the party leadership, previously Prussian-dominated, has to be \"broadened and ideologically consolidated\" through the inclusion of numerous new members from the south and southwest.\n\nIt is very likely Schäffer will continue the party's moderate right-wing course, without much experimentation with the Social Democrats or Schleicher's revolutionary ideas of a \"New State\". It could even be that the Zentrum will soon adopt a more flexible attitude towards the far-right, from which it still kept a certain distance under Guérard in previous years. Schäffer himself, although charismatic and close to the people, has often enough caused controversy in the past. Despite presenting himself as a man of the centre and as a democratic representative of middle-class interests, he has attracted attention several times for anti-Semitic and anti-socialist statements. In the Bavarian regional branch of the Zentrum, the Bavarian People's Party, where he has had an unparalleled career since the early 1920s, he is feared for his hunger for power and is seen as a dangerous rival to Minister-President Heinrich Held. Many Bavarians should therefore be relieved that Schäffer will now spend his time in Berlin. The future role of Stegerwald in the party is yet to be determined. According to Zentrum party officials, it is likely that he will stay in charge of the parliamentary faction for the near future - but at some point, the victorious rightists will surely make their move and further centralise power in accordance with the wishes of the younger delegates."

As article after article is printed on grand plans to dismantle the already fairly weak parliamentary system in Germany in order to replace it with decades of right-wing dominance, social democrats grow increasingly uneasy. This concern is especially held among the young generation of the SPD - who, unlike their predecessors, have a far different image of politics. While the party elders entered leadership during the Anti-Socialist Laws of the late 19th century and thus swore to always seek the most legal path to power to avoid a second period of repression, the politicians born in the 1890s or later never experienced this and thus are far more aggressive, though not necessarily more ideologically radical.\n\nWithin chapters of the SPD, trade union meetings and socialist study groups, tense discussion is taking place on whether the Social Democrats should take to the streets to fight for the defence of democracy - and it seems a large bulk of the party's mass membership are swayed by this rhetoric. Leading members of the SPD's youth wing, such as Kurt Schumacher and Theodor Haubach, as well as the long forgotten yet existing radical left wing of the party, which includes such people as Max Seydewitz and Kurt Rosenfeld, have been recognised as the leaders of this move. Though the party central committee still expects to just wait out a short-lived period of right wing rule, not everyone believes that democracy will simply defend itself."

Named after the date of the promulgation of the March Reforms to the Imperial Constitution, it refers to its goals with said name alone — the defence of the March Reforms against what is perceived as \"encroaching reactionary rule\". Though the Club professes to be a non-violent organisation that seeks to use public pressure in order to force the regime to reconsider its moves, we can pierce through the veil and recognise what this \"movement\" truly is.\n\nThe pervasive influence of traitors, perhaps even syndicalist and Russian funded, runs deep, and it's likely that the Club's wide contacts with fellow social democrats, liberals, and trade unionists will allow it to organise numerous actions of protest through the following years.

Supposedly, and foolishly, according to them, Germany is under no threat except for the threat it creates with its aggressive military.\n\nNot only that, but the SPD deputies pointed out the supposed influence of the Heer in political appears, claiming that the OHL is influencing the incumbent government - attacks which were immediately rebutted in the parliamentary arena."
 germany.42.a: "How dare they attack our national heroes?"

 germany.43.t: "Local Zentrum Politicians Attack the Government"
 germany.43.d: "Several mayors and a few members of state governments, all from the Zentrum party, have recently lodged criticism of the direction of our government, claiming that \"some of the projects and plans envisioned by the cabinet stand against the democratic nature of the constitution and are highly suspicious\". Their statements, publicised among the press, demand a return to a moderate conservative government - which will defend tradition and the rights of the states while retaining the achievements of March."
 germany.43.a: "Who are these nobodies?"

 germany.44.t: "The Zentrum Reichstag Faction Speaks"
 germany.44.d: "Our government policy has come under fire in the Reichstag - several members of the left wing of the Zentrum delegation have begun using it as a tribute, criticising the direction of our government. Pointing out several of the policies proposed by our cabinet as well as the biographies of the cabinet members, they claim that they perceive a naked return to Bismarckian authoritarianism - and cannot endorse this move, much like their predecessors, who had fought against the tyrannical policies of Kulturkampf. Though their claims are absurd, their speeches have been highly publicised."
 germany.44.a: "Sounds a bit treasonous."

 germany.45.t: "Tensions Between Zentrum and SPD"
 germany.45.d: "Unity within the democratic opposition has suddenly taken a significant blow, as several of the new generation socialists writing for Vorwärts openly called for the secularisation of the education system and fight against the influence of the churches in politics, which caught the attention of Zentrum politicians. An article war has broken out in the press, each side attacking the other for supposedly weakening the unity of the anti-reactionary coalition and putting the struggle in jeopardy. Ultimately, we are the ones who benefit, as we can take a break from the constant criticism."
 germany.45.a: "We win by doing absolutely nothing!"

 germany.46.t: "Anti-Syndicalist Trials"
 germany.46.d: "Investigations by the Prussian Secret Police have unveiled unquestionable ties between organisers of the general strike in the Ruhr that took place in 1936 and syndicalist intelligence. And it is not merely representatives of the radical socialist parties who are being accused of such connection - suspicion has befallen several leaders of SPD-aligned trade unions and Social Democratic politicians in the Rhineland. The prosecution is still ongoing, and though the democratic forces are claiming that this is no more than political persecution, the government-aligned press has trumped this up as a display of the SPD's secret syndicalist sympathies."
 germany.46.a: "This will certainly affect the reputation of the Social Democrats..."

 germany.47.t: "Another Strike"
 germany.47.d: "The news of the ongoing prosecution of Rhenish trade union activists has, perhaps ironically, sparked yet another strike in the Rhineland - this time, it is one of solidarity rather than a struggle for material gains. Free socialist trade unions and the ADGB have joined forces, demanding the charges on their comrades to be dropped. The Movement of March 3rd immediately chose to endorse this action, and even raising additional demands for the strikers to follow - such as the resignation of the incumbent government and new elections to the Reichstag. The Frankfurter Zeitung and the Vorwärts have also endorsed the strike.\n\nThis will not go like last time, however. There will be no tolerance of unpatriotic paralysis of the German economy - a military response by the armed forces of the Kingdom of Prussia has already been approved and just needs to be deployed to restore order."
 germany.47.a: "You have made a grave mistake, syndicalists."

 germany.48.t: "Criticism in the Reichstag"
 germany.48.d: "Even though a military operation to quell the strike in the Rhineland was approved, it ended up a dud, and the response was bungled, which meant that ultimately the government was forced to accede to the demands. Several high profile trade union leaders and known radical socialist agitators have been released from their confinement and acquitted of their charges. Both the far right and the moderates were left disappointed by this failure - but especially the latter.\n\nAccusing the government's hardline actions of having shaken the trust of the people in the government and only escalated the growth of socialism among German workers by miscalculated repression, they have even left the coalition, instead forming a moderate conservative grouping which has aligned itself with Zentrum."

 germany.49.t: "The War Begins"
 germany.49.d: "The beginning of the Second Weltkrieg caught German society unprepared - and not only because Germany was not an instigator of the conflict this time. Since 1934, it has been occupied with internal conflicts partisan squabbles, all of which were far more relevant to the politicians and the common people than distant worries of another military conflict. Russian aggression in the East and syndicalist rearmament in the West were concerning, for sure, but the expectation was that the undefeated Imperial Germany Army will make quick work of the aggressors.\n\nAs a result, the German Empire enters the war unprepared, and rapid mobilisation policies will need to be passed in order to hasten our rise from slumber. Yet, do we truly have the time?"

 germany.50.d: "The initial glut of the Imperial German Army and the industrial base appears to be receding - the fighting prowess of our soldiers is getting back to shape thanks to growing flows of new material from the factories and a wave of propaganda. Slowly, the Empire will return back to fighting shape - and when that happens, all of our enemies will tremble."

 germany.50.b: "Very good!"
 germany.50.c: "Let our people labour without the fanfare."

 germany.52.t: "Democratic Opposition Continues"
 germany.52.d: "In 1914, the beginning of the Weltkrieg led to the formation of a peace between all of the differing parties and movements in the German Empire, and even the Social Democrats chose to endorse the war in near unison. Now, however, times appear to have changed. Throughout the past few years, democratic civil society has struggled against our reform projects, which they deemed tyrannical and authoritarian, as baseless as their claims might be — and they are no longer as enthusiastic to defend it as they were twenty years ago.\n\nOf course, no true Social Democrat or progressive liberal would ever accept a syndicalist regime, thus the agitation of the Movement of March 3rd will be somewhat muted — however, their line is that we must immediately make \"an honourable peace\" with the aggressors and resist any return to the military dictatorship of the First Weltkrieg. Any attempts to mobilise the industry against the rights of labour will be sure to spark strikes, and our opponents will continue demanding democratic reform in the Reichstag."
 germany.52.a: "Bastards!"
 GER_democratic_resistance_continues_tt: "Events on the resistance of democratic society will continue, until you complete the National Foci §YAnti-Sedition Laws§! and §YDissolve Socialist Organisations§!, as well as all of their unlocked §YDecisions§!."

 germany.53.t: "Decline of the Democratic Opposition"
 germany.53.d: "Our directed focus at squashing the seditious elements within our populace appears to have yielded benefits at last. The nation is more united than ever, while the left — whether revolutionary or claiming to be moderate — is being driven out of the public sphere. Members of our cabinet have dreamt of the chance of destroying Social Democracy and socialism for years, and the opportunity given to them by the Second Weltkrieg has been used well.\n\nWe now have little to fear from internal \"democratic\" opposition. All we need to do now is to win the war - and the unity of our nation in waging it to its victorious conclusion will certainly be helpful."
 germany.53.a: "Perfect."

 germany.54.t: "The Reichskriegsflagge"
 germany.54.d: "The Reichskriegsflagge is the war flag of the German Empire, officially intended solely to be flown at sea, yet its fame among the German nation has led to it being widely adopted in national propaganda. It is especially beloved by the political right, to whom it is associated with the glorious victories of the First Weltkrieg and the national unity that they desire to replicate with their agenda.\n\nNow that Germany is once again embroiled in a world war, the question of using the Reichskriegsflagge has returned once more. Though the Schwarz-Weiß-Rot will remain the official flag throughout the conflict, we have the option of relying deeply on the war flag in wartime propaganda, as well as flying it in official instances and at the front, making it a de facto state flag. Alternatively, if it isn't to the government's liking, the peacetime tricolour can be maintained as the primary national symbol."
 germany.54.a: "The war flag will guide us to victory once more!"
 GER_reichkriegsflagge_tt: "We shall adopt the §YReichskriegsflagge§! for the duration of the war."
 germany.54.b: "Let us retain the tricolour."

 germany.55.t: "Guest Worker Programmes"
 germany.55.d: "Starved for labour in their factories, the German Empire has unveiled a new programme to raise production of military goods — recruitment of our citizens, among many others, as guest workers for German industry. This is the Fremdarbeiterprogramm, and as we currently do the German government's bidding, we are required to participate. Some of our conscripts, who do not fulfil health requirements for frontline service, will instead be transferred to Germany, and German recruiters will now work in our cities to find volunteers or \"volunteers\". As wages in Germany are higher than here, at least some men may choose to move West willingly.\n\nWhile this programme is taking place, we will lose out on manpower, both in the army as well as in our factories."
 germany.55.a: "Okay, but it's temporary, right...?"

 germany.56.t: "End of the Fremdarbeiterprogramm"
 germany.56.d: "As we have achieved victory in the West, we are no longer in a pressing need for manpower - so, the Fremdarbeiterprogramm has been shut down, and the workers imported from our subjects can now return back to their families. Some will choose to stay, however, as they either have nothing to return to or they wish to live a better life in our prosperous cities than in their squalid villages. In the future, this may lead to more and more migration from the East, as immigrants bring their relatives or recommend life here to their countrymen - but, it's nothing to worry about."
 germany.56.a: "It won't become a hot-button political issue or anything."

 germany.57.t: "End of the Fremdarbeiterprogramm"
 germany.57.d: "As the Western Front has been won, Germany is no longer in a pressing need for manpower, and so the Fremdarbeiterprogramm has been shut down, and thousands of our countrymen now return home. Some chose to stay, either because they have nothing to return to or because they became enamoured with prosperous Western life and wish to make a living in Berlin. Those who did come back bring important technical skills, gained during their time in Krupp or Rheinmetall factories - and though the absolute majority of them were manual workers and so we shouldn't expect them to bring precise blueprints of German technology, their insight will nonetheless be helpful in improving our own military industry."
 germany.57.a: "Sounds like we profited off this deal in the end."

 germany.58.t: "War Scare"
 germany.58.d: "Two events have shaken German press this week — first, an incident on the heavily fortified Franco-German border, in which a few French soldiers wandered into German soil and turned back after a stern warning; second, an article in the Kreuzzeitung by General Ludwig Beck, which assessed the \"staggering growth of the Russian and syndicalist armies in size and quality of materiel\", which has gotten the officer to warn that both of the revisionist powers may be ready for another world war sooner than we expected.\n\nThough few in the German Empire believed that Paris and Moscow would be content with the post-Weltkrieg order, most civilian politians assumed that the Imperial German Army, invincible on the battlefield, would deter any invasion. Since 1936, economic downturn and political conflict have caused Germany to withdraw deeper into internal affairs - a break which our enemies used to close the gap masterfully.\n\nOur hegemony across Europe seems invulnerable, but is it, really?"
 germany.58.a: "We already have enough on our plate..."
 GER_war_scare_tt: "§RThe economic crisis caused by Black Monday and political conflict has left us unprepared for another war. Military reform and industrial expansion should soften the initial blow, but it will happen regardless.§!\n\nNational focuses under the §YWar Preparedness§! focus filter will make us more prepared for the Weltkrieg."

 germany.59.t: "The End of the Ruhrkampf"
 germany.59.d: "One and a half years have passed since the beginning of general strikes and socialist insurgency in the Ruhr, and little initiative has been done by the changing German governments in quelling it. No thorough agreement has been signed and individual companies were forced to cut deals with radicalised trade unions by themselves, generally forced to make concessions. Over a hundred violent deaths have been recorded in the Rhineland alone - this experience has gotten thousands of workers to arm themselves and band together, defending their livelihoods and ideology from law enforcement and far-right gangs.\n\nThe strikes have receded, and most workers have returned to work, although their experience of the events in the Ruhr has shaped their lives forever. Now they know that they can resist the despotic Imperial government, and that they have allies near and far. Others have abandoned their workplaces entirely, and are conducting a low level insurgency throughout our industrial cities. Violent crime and manslaughter numbers are sure to increase in the following years..."
 germany.59.a: "This isn't good."

 germany.60.t: "Victory in Europe - End of the Second Weltkrieg"
 germany.60.d: "After a long and grueling conflict, our armies return victorious, having forced all of our enemies in Europe to kneel. There may be some resistance among the stragglers and the minor powers who foolishly chose to join forces with the Russians or the syndicalists, as well as at sea, but they are no longer a threat to our supremacy.\n\nIn the first Weltkrieg, we imposed harsh terms upon the Russians and the French in order to make sure that they never rise to challenge us again - it appears that they were not enough. We shall not repeat our mistake a second time. A military occupation and a compliant puppet regime will dismantle the military industry of those states and exploit them to the point of harmlessness.\n\nOur hegemony shall never be challenged again. A Pax Germanica descends upon Europe - a peace enforced for decades by German arms, peace and prosperity brought thanks to our benevolent leadership, which the rest of Europe will learn to respect in time, whether they want to or not. Of course, our struggle does not end here. We have to extinguish syndicalism worldwide, enforce our hegemony throughout the continents, and challenge the remaining superpowers, whether with the pen or with the sword."

Fuelled by the instability of the market, panic selling erupted as soon as the stock market opened on Monday morning.\n\nIt took well into the night for the teleprinters to stop sputtering out the results of what became known as Black Monday. When the results had been analysed, it was clear that the situation had only got worse.\n\nThe shock of this unprecedented economic catastrophe will, no doubt, be felt over the entire world. The German golden age has ended - for now, at least..."
 gerblack.0.a: "Mein Gott!"

 gerblack.1.t: "Aftermath of the Assassination"
 gerblack.1.d: "The shots firing on the streets of Moscow yesterday mark the first unexpected event this year, and it has struck Germany directly, as in their aftermath, the German ambassador in Moscow, Friedrich-Werner von der Schulenburg, received an invitation from the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs to negotiate on the future of Russo-German relations. The upcoming expiry of the Vilnius Agreement and the fate of large German investments in Russia were the main topics of discussion. However, the contents of the Russian note were leaked to the press by a clerk in the embassy, and instantly embellished with second-hand rumors and fearmongering about planned nationalisations of German investments - or, possibly, even a road to war.\n\nThe stocks of companies with large investments in Russia, especially heavy industry giants such as Krupp AG and Rheinmetall, began to tremble in the aftermath, and what has so far been a steady stock market spike has turned to a volatile market. Interventions by key stock market brokers and banks, such as the Association of Berlin Banks and Bankers, prevented a stock market crash, but the faith of the investors has taken a sharp dive.\n\nIn the midst of this flurry of economic news, few were asking the question of what could await Eastern Europe in the future. For two decades, Russia has been seen as an unstable eastern buffer whose great power ambitions have been permanently shattered - but perhaps it was not as permanent as people thought?"
 gerblack.1.a: "How could Russia be a threat to Germany again?"

 gerblack.2.t: "Ten Years After the Intervention"
 gerblack.2.d: "For the past month, the Berlin Stock Exchange has been in a volatile plateau, and some voices, such as Walther von Rathenau, have already predicted an impending stock market crash, though others are sceptical of such doomsaying. Still, sense of unease permeates the markets and trading volumes are relatively subdued.\n\nUntil now, when a one-two punch dealt a second severe blow to the stability of the stock market. After forced audits by the Reichswirtschaftsamt (Imperial Economic Office), numerous instances of fraud have been revealed among companies operating in German East Asia — the deplorable finances of their Eastern branches were being hidden by fudging numbers, and the same fudging was used to avoid taxes. Just in time when a retired official from German East Asia, Franz Brüninghaus, published a piece in the Berliner Tageblatt, titled \"Ten Years After the Intervention\", referring to German intervention in China with an expeditionary force to topple the Kuomintang's \"Northern Expedition\".\n\nIt is an alarmist piece, describing the failure of German foreign policy in East Asia and stating that the instability in the League of Eight Provinces is the fuse which will set off an explosion of socialist and anti-concessionist revolts in China - threatening all German investments in China.\n\nFor a market whose stability is already wobbling, this was not good news to wake up to - investors began pulling out of affected companies in droves, causing a dip in overall stock price. A flurry in trading on German government bonds occurred, as exposed investors needing liquidity sold them to other, less exposed institutions seeking stabler investments. If this continues, it could lead to the greatest stock market crash in German history."
 gerblack.2.a: "But what could be done to stop it...?"

 gerblack.3.t: "Impasse in the Reichstag"
 gerblack.3.d: "In the Frankfurter Zeitung, Walther von Rathenau has repeated his call for action, demanding the government to impose a week-long temporary bank holiday from Monday, February 3rd onwards, which would take the heat off an overheated market and allow tension in the air to cease. News of this proposal reached the President of the Reichsbank, Hjalmar Schacht, who forwarded the proposal to Chancellor Herbert von Dirksen. The two statesmen consequently spent the weekend trying to organise an emergency response to an impending economic collapse.\n\nMeanwhile, a meeting of the Reichstag's party leaders on Saturday was fruitless, however. Though the parliamentary leaders all agreed on the necessity to act decisively, they disagreed on the specifics - and, ultimately, the two largest opposition leaders, Hermann Müller of the SPD and Ulrich von Hassell of the DVLP, were anticipating an economic downfall, as the blame for it would fall not upon them, but especially upon LVP, DkP, Zentrum, and the Chancellor. In the end, stating that \"getting a few plutocrats bankrupt might just leave Germany better off\", Müller accused the March Coalition of creating the conditions for the crash in the first place and ended the meeting.\n\nDesperate and disheartened by the political impasse, Schacht chose to act independently. On Sunday, the Reichsbank published a note declaring that access to credit with the Reichsbank will henceforth be based on their primary coverage ratio, and temporarily suspended the Reichsmark's convertibility to gold. His goal was to bring long-term stability to the market by minimising the damage done to the banks in a stock market crash, but, on the last day before Monday, it has sown terror in the market, and neutered the role of the Reichsbank as a lender of last resort."
 gerblack.3.a: "Let's hope Monday brings good news..."

 gerblack.4.t: "Economic Freefall Ceases"
 gerblack.4.d: "Having been in freefall for the past months, the economic crisis has finally reached a modicum of stability - or, at least, it doesn't have much else where to fall. The least stable companies and banks have gone under, and now, the more durable ones compete in a shrunken, silenced environment. Investor trust is at an all time low, so new investments are nonexistent and production stagnates. And, of course, millions of workers who had stable jobs last year are now on the streets, desperate for work - but companies, shaken by the financial collapse, are very hesitant to expand and employ more workers again.\n\nThe initial surprise and shock in the German government has subsided, and our secretariats and ministries may begin developing solutions. The amount of work is enormous - the state must somehow recover the economy of the Empire back to its old heights, taking on challenges which may require wildly different financial strategies each. The bureaucrats and officials thus eagerly await the results of the April election. Perhaps the next government will have the political capital needed for this necessary action."
 gerblack.4.a: "We shall restore the miracle of the Golden Twenties!"

 gerblack.5.t: "Collapse of Danatbank"
 gerblack.5.d: "The Darmstädter und Nationalbank (Danatbank) is the first major casualty of the Black Monday financial crash. The second largest bank in the German Empire, it went deep into high risk loans prior to 1936, offering quick and easy loans to would-be stock brokers and growing companies, and now reaps the consequences. One of the companies which had been severely indebted to Danatbank was Norddeutsche Wollkämmerei & Kammgarnspinnerei (Nordwolle), a wool and worsted processing plant in Delmenhorst. Much like hundreds of other companies, it announced its bankruptcy in the aftermath of the crash, having barely stayed afloat for the past several years and finally received the blow which made the plant insolvent.\n\nNews of Nordwolle's bankruptcy caused a bank run on Danatbank, as many other investors were fearful of the bank's future and rapidly pulled their savings while they can still get their money's worth. As Danatbank had failed to reach its primary coverage ratio for the past several years due to its speculative loaning practices, it could not be saved by the Reichsbank in this moment of crisis, and so was forced to declare bankruptcy as well. The collapse of this old and respected bank has sent terrifying tremors across the German banking system.\n\nAcross the Empire, investors and citizens alike are withdrawing their savings and retreating from the market. Banks are collapsing one after another, caught completely unprepared by the enormous crash, and the financial system of the Empire has been left completely crippled."
 gerblack.5.a: "This is a nightmare!"

 gerblack.6.t: "Mass Layoffs"
 gerblack.6.d: "As the end of February dawns, the Reichsbank and the state institutions have finally begun making the first actions towards stabilising the freefall markets. A bank holiday has been established and emergency bailouts for the keystone banks that survived the initial crash have been sent out, though all of the state's actions so far have been kept at minimum, as the Reichstag remains deadlocked and the election is approaching soon.\n\nBy now, however, the damage has already been done. With the financial sector crippled and the international economic system trembling, demand for German exports has collapsed and companies across Germany are forced to either declare insolvency or drastically cut costs. For almost all industries, this meant relieving workers, many of them, and the number of unemployed who have been cast out to the streets is now in the millions.\n\nThe Bauer-Giesberts labour reforms of 1925 established a system of unemployment insurance for German workers, and thus a meagre pension allows the unemployed to make ends meet somewhat - but this has taxed the already struggling finances of the Empire greatly. And in numerous cases, the impact of the crash has been a lot more tragic. Stock market brokers who had lost everything in the past few weeks, struggling artisans who had refined their humble career for decades and saw their life ambitions crash these days, all have taken a liking to ending their lives, and state police forces have been forced to patrol bridges more and more often."
 gerblack.6.a: "The government must intervene and do something..."

 gerblack.7.t: "The German Agrarian Crisis"
 gerblack.7.d: "The German agricultural sector, struggling for years at this point, has suffered greatly from the economic crisis sparked by the Black Monday market crash. It is the latest step in the persistent decline of German agriculture ever since the late 19th century; the culmination of many years of inefficient and outdated methods, unfortunate global market developments and stalling, poorly future-oriented agrarian policies.\n\nCompared to its Western competitors, such as Britain or the United States, German agriculture has consistently lagged behind in efficiency. Twenty five percent of all arable land across the Empire is held by 0.2 percent of the land owners, most of which are operating in East Elbia. But since the late 20s, small and mid-sized farmers all across the nation have started to feel the effects of this looming efficiency crisis as well: Steady price erosion for agricultural goods due to cheaper competition from abroad and shrivelling purchasing power have slowly led many farmers into the never-ending downwards spiral of growing indebtedness.\n\nWhat could initially be battled via the reintroduction of protective tariffs and import quotas, undoubtedly a controversial policy instrument within Mitteleuropa, has at the end of the day only postponed the inevitable. With the collapse of the German banking sector, the looming crisis will soon aggravate as many estates and enterprises which have relied on loans to stay afloat are bound to default on these in the near future, and the collapsing demand for agricultural goods could be the nail in the coffin. This substantial crisis has already begun to fuel the DkP electoral campaign and placed the question of a drastically different agricultural policy on the agenda. What many have seem to forgotten, though, is the fact that the conservatives are partly responsible themselves for this dilemma, via their candidate in the State Secretariat of Agriculture, Martin Schiele, and his controversial agricultural policies during the last decade. For now, his political fate is on a knife's edge."

 gerblack.8.d: "Our worst expectations have become reality — the economy remains in the sink while our debt ticks up every year, until, finally, we reached a point where our shrinking revenues are no longer able to cover both our numerous spending needs and debt servicing. International investors watch in horror, as the German Empire, once seen as the lynchpin of the new financial order, is becoming insolvent.\n\nEconomic recovery has completely stalled, as we are simply unable to afford the projects necessary to reinvigorate the industrial sector. Large scale construction, be it for civilian or military needs, has to be set aside for the time being — and the \"time\" will be long. Recovering from our financial glut will take many years, and it is safe to declare that we are living in a \"lost decade\". That is, if the syndicalists and Russians do not eat us alive..."

 gerblack.9.t: "The German Sovereign Debt Crisis"
 gerblack.9.d: "The worst expectations of international observers have become reality — Germany has entered a sovereign debt crisis. Already significantly indebted before the economic crisis, it has to take out many loans with harsh interest rates to finance its economic recovery — but results did not come, while shrinking revenues mean that the Empire is simply no longer able to pay both for recovery and debt servicing.\n\nAs its economy flounders and crashes to a \"lost decade\", so does ours, as we are tightly connected with the German market - though it will take less time for us to recover, what does it mean when a crippled and broke Germany won't be able to protect us against the syndicalists and Russians...?"
 gerblack.9.a: "This is a catastrophe!"

 gerblack.10.t: "The Economy Recovers"
 gerblack.10.d: "A long period of economic downturn has finally come to an end - a long series of strategic government policy to alleviate the malaise have finally had their effect, and for the first time in years, Germany has reached pre-1934 industrial production levels. Not only have the effects of the economic crisis sparked by Black Monday been curtailed, but also the instability that set in the markets ever since the election of Boris Savinkov in the Russian Republic.\n\nNow that productivity and employment have been restored to stable levels, emergency economic controls can be loosened, and financing for other government programmes expanded - the Heer has been itching to initiate major reforms and their leadership has already begun lobbying members of the Reichstag to finance ambitious rearmament projects."
 gerblack.10.a: "Long live the unsurpassed Empire!"

 gerblack.11.t: "The Economy Shifts to War"
 gerblack.11.d: "Throughout the entire buildup to the Second Weltkrieg, we were burdened by the lingering effects of the economic crisis caused by Black Monday. Unemployment remained high and industrial production has remained below 1934 levels. Our time to amend this crisis has ran out - the Empire has been pulled into the maelstrom of world war, and must immediately shift to war production.\n\nThe influx of wartime economic controls, large scale investment and mass employment in arms factories will, inevitably, alleviate the remaining effects of the crisis - however, it is no longer for us to solve. It will passively recover during the war - yet, is it not too late for our economy to heal from its malaise?"

 gerschl.1.t: "No Majority in the 1936 Election"
 gerschl.1.d: "As predicted by quite a few during the campaign, no majority has been found in the Reichstag after the elections of 1936. A majority is impossible without the participation of either the SPD or the DVLP, two parties on different ends of the political spectrum, either of which would need time to dismantle the old consensus and craft a new coalition in the legislature. However, there is no time for the Reichstag to bicker amongst themselves until they finally form a government — with each passing day, the economic situation grows worse and the faith of the people falters further.\n\nWhen the parliamentarians cannot lead, the duty to make a decision falls to the Kaiser, Wilhelm II. Even after the March Constitution, his role in the formation of governments remains definite, and whenever there is no obvious majority in the Reichstag, he has seen fit to appoint compromise choices like Brockdorff or loyalists of the court like Dirksen. Through Crown Prince Wilhelm, the Kaiser was recommended an interesting choice — Kurt von Schleicher, the current Minister of War of Prussia.\n\nEver since Leo von Caprivi's resignation in 1894, Wilhelm II has been reluctant to appoint military candidates to the office, and parliamentarians would hardly wish to see a uniformed man command the Empire either, as it brings back memories of Hindenburg and Ludendorff's plotting during the Weltkrieg. However, Schleicher offers several valuable qualities as well. During the past two decades, he has nurtured the image of a moderate who works well with the Reichstag, has ties and connections across the political spectrum and is a noted supporter of trade unions such as the ADGB, earning him the moniker \"The Red General\". At a time when national unity is necessary, all of these qualities are crucial. Finally, he is a close friend of Crown Prince Wilhelm, who is a major influence on his aged father and eventually got him to appoint the new Reichskanzler."

 gerschl.2.t: "Matters of National Stability"
 gerschl.2.d: "In his first speech before the Reichstag, Reichskanzler Schleicher announced that the first and biggest priority of his government will be to contain the economic crisis caused by the Black Monday market crash. To this end, he spoke out against orthodox economists and their agendas, by stating that the most crucial step to take is a war against unemployment. Stability in the financial markets, management of Imperial debt, they are all important - but they cannot be more important than the millions of yearning masses thrown out of their jobs during the course of the past few months.\n\nJob creation and a war on unemployment - those were the slogans of the hour, popular with the people, who demanded quick solutions to their personal economic issues. Already, the new Reichskanzler has been in contact with likeminded officials, such as Fritz Tarnow and Fritz Baade, who have been developing an employment-based recovery plan with the aid of the ADGB trade union confederation - or, potentially, even the famous Walther von Rathenau, who has developed a complex scheme for full reform of the German economy along state control lines during the Weltkrieg.\n\nHowever, that was not the controversial event of the day. With the Reichskanzler's backing, the first law of the cabinet was proposed in the same session, amending the procedure for votes of no confidence established by the March Reforms - which were described vaguely in the Constitution itself and thus clarified in ordinary Reichstag bills. Citing the necessity for cabinet stability under the fractured nature of the current Reichstag, Schleicher pushed for a system of constructive no confidence vote - a no confidence vote on the government may only be voted for and pass if a replacement candidate for Reichskanzler is proposed by the same people. This proposed replacement candidate is then recommended to the Kaiser, though he still has full power to choose whoever he wants.\n\nThis has delayed any no confidence vote towards Schleicher by making sure that the SPD and DVLP could not just band together and remove whoever they wish - though it does not mean that they have given up just yet. The parliamentary parties now just need to build a critical mass in the Reichstag to push through their choice..."

 gerschl.3.t: "Choosing the Vice-Chancellor"
 gerschl.3.d: "Officially known as the General Deputy to the Reichskanzler, the Vice-Chancellor may be appointed at the request of the Reichskanzler. He is able to fulfil the duties of the Reichskanzler and countersign Imperial orders and decrees in the Reichskanzler's stead, and generally holds considerable influence in the collegial Federal government. Traditionally, the Vice-Chancellor also serves as the Secretary of the Interior, although this is not an iron-clad rule.\n\nDuring coalition governments in the Empire, the Vice-Chancellor is generally given to the most important coalition partner of the Reichskanzler. For Schleicher, this is an issue, as he is an outsider to the Reichstag and seeks to work beyond the partisan barrier — but, it also gives an opportunity. By tactically appointing a delegate of a bothersome ideological wing, he can satiate them for a time, and spend that time furthering his agenda. An independent, nonpartisan, yet generally conservative official, such as Tilo von Wilmowsky, would be seen as an act of trust by the conservatives in the Reichstag. On the other hand, a member of the right wing of the SPD, such as August Winnig, would ensure that Schleicher's government reinforces its pretense as a \"Red General's Government\", and grants some assurances to the SPD.\n\nAlternatively, it is possible to simply leave the office of Vice-Chancellor vacant - this would forgo opportunities for building cross-connection, but it would consolidate even more power in the hands of the Reichskanzler. What will be Schleicher's decision?"
 gerschl.3.a: "Tilo von Wilmowsky - inoffensive and a conservative choice."
 gerschl.3.b: "August Winnig - a maverick, but tolerable to the SPD."
 gerschl.3.c: "Schleicher does not need a second-in-command."

 gerschl.4.t: "Prussia and the Reichskanzler"
 gerschl.4.d: "For the first few decades after the formation of the German Empire, the Reichskanzler and the Minister-President of Prussia were the same person and were considered to be the same position by many in practice. This was because the Emperor, as King of Prussia, generally preferred to keep the two positions consolidated, and it also perpetuated Prussian dominance over the Empire.\n\nThis state of affairs changed after the Weltkrieg, for two reasons. First, the March Reforms to the Constitution introduced a vote of no confidence in the Reichskanzler, allowing the Reichstag to control him and possibly remove him, which implicitly meant that the Reichstag could now remove a Prussian Minister-President. The second is Matthias Erzberger, a liberal southern Catholic, becoming Reichskanzler in 1921, which infuriated the Prussian House of Representatives. After being petitioned to do something by the Prussian legislators, Wilhelm II ultimately acceded and appointed Bill Drews as the first independent Prussian Minister-President.\n\nSince then, an uneasy system of dual rule has formed in the Empire. Prussia controls 70% of the Empire's population and territory, and as it now has its own government, cooperation between it and the Federal government, or lack thereof, can rescue or bury a Reichskanzler. However, as tension within the Prussian Grand Coalition grows, Reichskanzler Schleicher has spoken out against this system. In this critical moment, the Empire must have one head, not two, it needs to consolidate its resources. Being a respected official from Prussia, Schleicher has the potential to become the first Reichskanzler to also be the Prussian Minister-President in over a decade - which will put Prussia's resources, influence and law enforcement under his direct control, for better or worse. His decision will be to..."

 gerschl.5.d: "Under the advice of his advisors, Wilhelm II, as King of Prussia, has accepted Schleicher's petition and appointed him as the next Minister-President of Prussia. The move has generally received negative reactions from the Prussian legislature, and has been decried on the left as a threatening expansion of Schleicher's power - however, most of the political establishment accepted the decision without much fanfare. On his opening speech before the Prussian House of Representatives, Schleicher stated that he intends to maintain the spirit of cooperation fostered by his predecessor, Siegfried von Roedern, and his first action will be to establish and expand work relief programmes across the Kingdom."

 gerschl.6.d: "Under the advice of the Prussian House of Lords, Wilhelm II refused Schleicher's petition to appoint him as the next Minister-President of Prussia. An official telegram from the Stadtschloss stated that Roedern is currently fulfilling his duties well and the King of Prussia \"sees no immediate necessity to replace him\".\n\nThe move was welcomed by the conservative nobility in the House of Lords and much of the Prussian legislature, who had hoped to maintain their independence from the Federal government, but was met with disappointment from the government. Numerous political figures, supportive of Schleicher's economic recovery plans, criticised the decision as well, stating that today's economic collapse requires consolidation of resources, not infighting between Prussia and the Empire."
 gerschl.6.a: "We will work with what we have."

 gerschl.7.t: "The Kanzler and the Radio"
 gerschl.7.d: "The months leading up to the 1936 elections did not give the German populace a good image of their government — divided, fighting over petty conflicts and ignorant of the needs of the people, they appeared complicit in the financial collapse in February. Recovery from the financial crisis requires for the government to regain the people's trust — both to ensure that the masses of unemployed and impoverished do not resort to radical ends, and also to sway the Reichstag by displaying the Reichskanzler's personal popularity. Kurt von Schleicher, though more of a technician of politics than a public face, took upon the task.\n\nThe office of the Reichskanzler established a programme of weekly radio talks, during which the Reichskanzler explained his plans for economic recovery, the policies he intends to present before the Reichstag for a vote and how they may benefit the German people. During the radio talks, he invoked a comparison between Germany's current bereft state with the condition of Prussia in the first half of the eighteenth century and compared his vision with the policy of \"a more moderate Friedrich Wilhelm I\" for national recovery. Much like the King concentrated on domestic reorganisation and avoided conflict during his long reign, so too Schleicher intends to focus patiently on domestic problems. Much like he had attended to economic development and granted privileges to productive workers, so will his government encourage a \"streamlining of the economy\" and \"offer the most far reaching satisfaction of the legitimate desires of the entire working class\".\n\nThis unprecedented move of personal connection between the Reichskanzler and the German people was a success. Hundreds of thousands across Germany turned out to listen to the radio talks and the contents of Schleicher's speeches were consistently commented and discussed throughout the press."
 gerschl.7.a: "He has a way with words!"

 gerschl.8.t: "Ewald von Kleist-Schmenzin Attacks Schleicher"
 gerschl.8.d: "A scathing criticism of the Reichskanzler has been delivered in national newspapers by Ewald von Kleist-Schmenzin, the Oberpräsident of Pomerania. From his offices in Stettin, he denounced Schleicher's lack of principles and heartless pragmatism which will bring no new vision to the German Empire, merely a mockery cobbled up from a hundred competing ideas - to him, the Reichskanzler is \"a liberalist tactician; unprincipled opportunist; girondin\". One day, he acts as nearly a syndicalist before trade unions in the Rhineland, another day, he denounces those same ideas as he plots with business owners and puppet bureaucrats. Such a man can never reinvigorate the German nation - merely drag it down deeper.\n\nThe words of this rising star among German conservatives has travelled far. A well connected East Elbian aristocrat and a leader in the Pomeranian agrarian movement, Kleist-Schmenzin represents a new Junker generation, and has already been considered by the conservatives as a potential candidate for Prussian Minister-President, or even Reichskanzler. His sentiment towards Schleicher is shared by the DkP in particular - who have chosen this week to finally announce that their electoral alliance with the DVLP will continue in the Reichstag as well."

 gerschl.9.t: "Fall of the Roedern Cabinet"
 gerschl.9.d: "The incumbent nonpartisan government in Prussia, led by Minister-President Siegfried von Roedern, has not endured the aftermath of the economic crisis. The elections of 1936 have driven tensions between the members of Roedern's coalition as well — the Prussian DVLP, DkP, Zentrum and LVP witnessed the change of demeanor in their federal counterparts and thus began drifting themselves. After a failed vote on government subsidies to Silesian coal industries, which were blasted by the DVLP as \"ridiculous support for sycophants and Jews\", Roedern chose to resign due to the legislature's lack of confidence in the cabinet.\n\nWilhelm II, as King of Prussia, accepted the recommendation of the House of Lords and appointed Adolf Tortilowicz von Batocki-Friebe as the next Minister-President of Prussia. A relatively pragmatic East Prussian aristocrat of Lithuanian roots, Batocki earned notoriety for his leadership of the Imperial Nutrition Office during the Weltkrieg. News outlets believe that he will seek to maintain Roedern's coalition of the centre and right, and retain most of the incumbent ministers."

 gerschl.10.t: "Fall of the Batocki Cabinet"
 gerschl.10.d: "The government of Adolf Tortilowicz von Batocki-Friebe in Prussia was short lived. The DVLP and LVP have both fully severed their membership in the House of Representatives Coalition — the liberals could no longer find an accord with the nationalists and conservatives, while the DVLP demanded to earn additional ministries to account for their size in the legislature, but were rebuffed. Briefly, Batocki considered negotiations with the significant Social Democratic faction in the assembly, but these talks broke down as well, as the SPD demanded no less than subjugation.\n\nAdvised by his circle and by the House of Lords of Prussia, Wilhelm II announced the dissolution of the Prussian House of Representatives. The King of Prussia's short note on the decision, sent from the Königliches Schloss in Berlin, stated that \"as the composition of the current House cannot come to an agreement and back a lasting government, the King has found it fitting to return their mandate back to the people and await a new legislature\". Snap elections will be held in a month, and though the plural election system of Prussia means that all sides expect only minor adjustments, a Prussian electoral campaign has begun."

 gerschl.11.d: "The snap elections in Prussia have finally arrived, and have witnessed considerable gains for the Schwarz-Weiß-Rot Coalition thanks to active campaigning and mobilisation by the agrarian movements of East Elbia. Though they did not earn a majority, they collected allies in Zentrum and the minor liberal parties, such as the Wirtschaftspartei and the National Liberals, and, most importantly, have swayed the Kaiser to their side. Wilhelm II, as King of Prussia, chose to appoint the coalition's preferred candidate, Ewald von Kleist-Schmenzin, as the Minister-President of Prussia.\n\nIn his first speech before the Prussian House of Representatives, Minister-President Kleist announced two axes of his cabinet's political programme — reform in the Prussian countryside, which will relieve the struggling agricultural sector and lay the path towards economic recovery, and second, \"asserting Prussia's position in the Empire\". Observers, including the Reichskanzler, are certain that this will amount to open resistance to the central government, support for the right wingers in the Reichstag, and a dangerous Federal-Prussian dualism in the Empire.

As such, no matter if they were on the left or the right, the Reichstag began to plot, seeking to overthrow the Reichskanzler with the power of no-confidence vote, granted to the Reichstag in the constitutional reforms of 1920.\n\nThe SPD and its allies, an informal alliance known as the \"Democratic Union\" (Demokratische Union), ultimately took the lead, forming a majority in the legislature and initiating a no-confidence vote, citing that the Reichskanzler could no longer manage the government under these conditions and must step down. Though Schleicher fought to the best of his ability, he was unable to break the will of the SPD, and he was forced out after a majority vote.\n\nHis role in history will thus be that of a mere interim period, an independent who led Germany for a few brief months before handing the reins over to the government of Hermann Müller.

The Association of German Iron and Steel Industrialists, the most influential employers' organisation in the Ruhr, chose a policy of confrontation with the working class, refusing negotiations with trade unions - their worry was that further wage increases, demanded by steel workers to cope with high inflation, would make their production uncompetitive and spell doom for the industry in the volatile economic environment.\n\nWhen the trade unions in the Ruhr, led by the Free Trade Unions, but also involving their liberal and Christian counterparts, terminated the collective agreement to demand a 15 pfennig per hour wage increase, the industrialists responded with a lockout, trying to force the unionists to bend to their will. In a country already suffering from economic plight and societal tension, this triggered a cascade effect - unions across the nation, but especially in the Ruhr, declared their sympathy with the locked out workers and joined the call for a general strike. Even several representatives in the Reichstag, most notably Max Seydewitz, spoke out in favour of the strikers and declared the lockout illegal.\n\nOver a million workers have joined the strike by the end of the week, paralysing industry across much of the country.

Though he has attempted to maintain a pragmatic, at times even friendly, approach towards German labour movement, occasionally being even nicknamed the \"Red General\", our comrades were not so easily fooled. They saw through this thin veil of deceit: Schleicher is one of the most dreadful militarists of them all, a prototypical reactionary smiling at the thought of crushing the People's Revolution, either the willing accomplice of the Junkers or their unwitting puppet.\n\nAnd so, our German comrades have ramped up their efforts towards organisation and mobilisation of the proletariat. A general strike has been called, to protest against the new government and the steadily worsening conditions of the workers. The bosses blame the Black recession but this drudgery is enabled by the unending greed for profits of Capital, passing on the costs of their failure unto the toiling man. In the Ruhr, the beating heart of Germany's heavy industry, where the mobilisation is the strongest, we have been informed by well-connected German exiles that perhaps more than just a strike is simmering. Repression has been particularly harsh and if things continue like this, the workers might at the very least further radicalise, perhaps enough to grasp our extended hand. We, of course, already do discreetly provide funds, literature and general logistical help to German socialists, but this is where our exiled friends come in play.

 gerschl.25.b: "We must begin selective negotiations with unions to settle this."

 gerschl.26.t: "Bielefeld Summit"
 gerschl.26.d: "Under the leadership of Carl Severing, one of the main figures in the right wing of the SPD and a powerful figure in the Bielefeld SPD, a summit has been held between the main representatives of the government and the strikers. Regional representatives of political parties ranging from Zentrum to the KAPD, local trade union leaders, municipal dignitaries and representatives of the political executive committees of the strikers took seat, as well as a minister from Prussia and the central government each for observation and consultation.\n\nThe two priorities of the conference, as described by Severing, was to negotiate an armistice between the arming workers and the central government in a way that would not make either side resort to violence - and, second, a comprehensive settlement that would allow the workers to return to their jobs safely. The demands of the Ruhr workers have risen well beyond the wage increases which sparked the Ruhrkampf, however, and the government may not be interested in fulfilling their demands, either."
 gerschl.26.a: "We must seek a thorough agreement, even with the extremists."
 gerschl.26.b: "Isolate the KAPD and KPD, but make concessions to establishment unions."
 gerschl.26.c: "Make a show of talks with few loyalists to stall for time."
 gerschl.26.e: "Negotiate through SPD party contacts and aligned unions."

 gerschl.27.t: "Progress in Negotiations"
 gerschl.27.d: "The Bielefeld Summit is over, and has shown some promise. Moderate trade unionists among the Ruhr strikers are willing to compromise on some of their political programme in order to achieve material gains for the workers - and while the KAPD-influenced radicals are obviously not going to concede, cooperation with the moderates may leave them marginalised and thus turn the strike harmless. Of course, a lot more work is necessary to moderate the radicalism of the strike and contain its spread, and even the strikers who were receptive to compromise have not returned to work thus far, hoping to get even more gains by pressuring their factory owners a bit more."
 gerschl.27.a: "It's better than nothing."

 gerschl.28.t: "Negotiations Break Down"
 gerschl.28.d: "Our attempt to negotiate with the Ruhr strikes has been met with failure. Even the moderate wing, more concerned with material gains than political objectives, chose to not waver from their programme and kept the trade unionist movement united, and the KAPD-influenced radicals were active as ever agitating for no compromises with the government. We will have to seek alternate approaches if we want to get the workers to return back to their factories."
 gerschl.28.a: "Not good."

 gerschl.29.t: "A Visit to the Ruhr?"
 gerschl.29.d: "The staff of the Reichskanzler have drafted a proposal for Schleicher — an official visit to the Ruhr to alleviate some of the tensions personally. This would involve several speeches to trade union representatives in the region and a final public one in Essen, where the Reichskanzler is to promise labour law reform and state protection for strikers who peacefully return to work. This would strengthen Schleicher's reputation as \"the Red General\" and pave the way towards a peaceful resolution of the General Strike.\n\nOf course, this proposal comes with its own risks. There is no telling what impression the Reichskanzler will make towards an agitated, frustrated proletarian public, whether they will be impressed by his promises or be only more emboldened to resist. Finally, while the risk is low, the presence of armed radicals among the Ruhr strikers means that there is a possibility some may... take matters to their own hands."
 gerschl.29.a: "Meeting the Reichskanzler may convince some to return to work."
 gerschl.29.b: "It's too risky."

 gerschl.30.t: "Good Impression in the Ruhr"
 gerschl.30.d: "The Reichskanzler's visit in the Ruhr has left a good impression upon the population. Schleicher made several speeches in major Rhenish cities, speaking to crowds and granting them promises of stronger labour regulations, earning the ovation of the public. The trade union representatives and strike organisers were informed of the planned reforms as well, and they were convinced by the Reichskanzler's proposals, smoothening the potential road towards negotiations.\n\nOf course, Schleicher did not hesitate to follow this by informing his allies in the business sector that this will not endanger their position, rather take the wind out of the sails of the general strike, appease the majority with narrow reforms, and restore peace in the industrial sector."
 gerschl.30.a: "That's very good news."

 gerschl.31.t: "Ruhr Visit Met by Protests"
 gerschl.31.d: "The Reichskanzler's visit in the Ruhr has not left a good impression upon the population. As Schleicher and his cabinet note, the situation in the Ruhr has grown increasingly radicalised, and each speech made in the Rhenish cities was met with protests and demands to resign. Due to growing security concerns, the visit had to be cut short, meetings with trade union leaders had to be cancelled, and the Reichskanzler swiftly returned to Berlin.\n\nThe events were not received well across the rest of the Empire. Business leaders and members of the Reichstag took this as a sign of weakness and lack of support from the Schleicher government - an impression that needs to be handled, somehow."
 gerschl.31.a: "Ungrateful..."
 GER_schleicher_weaker_tt: "You will now be able to flag §R1§! less faction to protect it from conversion."

 gerschl.32.t: "Assassination Attempt on Kurt von Schleicher"
 gerschl.32.d: "The worst we could have expected has happened in the Ruhr - while making a speech in Essen, the Reichskanzler was fired upon from the crowd, causing mass panic and a riot which the city police forces only restrained after two hours of fighting and several lives. Schleicher survived the attack, but was wounded in the arm and had to be immediately hospitalised for an operation.\n\nAfter interrogations of captured rioters, the assailant has been identified as Erich Mielke - a member of the KAPD, trained by its self defence units in espionage, handling weapons and terrorism. The assassination attempt was planned by Mielke's unit in advance. Unfortunately, the failed assassin vanished in the crowd and escaped the grasp of justice, but the news coming from Essen have emboldened the government. The public demands action against these terrorists, and they shall provide."
 gerschl.32.a: "No more silk gloves!"

 gerschl.33.t: "Strike of the Luxembourg Mining and Metalworkers' Union"
 gerschl.33.d: "The winds of the Ruhr General Strike have reached the small, yet industrialised Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, one of the most recent additions to the German Empire. Here, Nicolas Biever, the chairman of the Luxembourg Mining and Metalworkers' Union, one of the largest trade union confederations in the Grand Duchy, has pledged himself to the strike, pushing thousands of workers across Luxembourg to do so as well. The famous Luxembourg steel industry has frozen almost entirely in the aftermath, and conglomerates such as ARBED now desperately seek workers to fill critical positions in their plants.\n\nThe news were not taken well in the Chamber of Deputies of the small duchy, where the Luxembourger Party of the Right, an affiliate of Zentrum, has denounced the strike as an act of treason against the Grand Duchy itself. Prime Minister Joseph Bech has warned that \"syndicalist infiltration\" from France will be met with harsh countermeasures."
 gerschl.33.a: "How long could this last?"

 gerschl.34.t: "Luxembourger Party of the Right Proposes \"Maulkuerfgesetz\""
 gerschl.34.d: "The strikes in Luxembourg, which has already been very vulnerable to syndicalist agitation and mobilisation, have made rounds in the small state's Chamber of Deputies. Located near France, on the \"frontier\" before the syndicalist bloc, and highly industrialised, with powerful unions and local socialist organisations, it has been highly anxious of a possible socialist revolt since 1920. Prime Minister Joseph Bech, representing the Luxembourger Party of the Right, has proposed a law to curtail the growth of socialism in Luxembourg, the \"Law for the Defence of the Social and Political Order\".\n\nOpponents of the law, however, have taken to calling it \"the muzzle law\", or Maulkuerfgesetz. It would give the government the power to dissolve any other organisation believed to be threatening the Constitution - as a result, it has been highly criticised by socialists and the Luxembourger SPD, who claim that Bech intends to use this law to ban all opposition to his government and orchestrate the creation of an authoritarian regime, with the Ruhrkampf as a mere excuse. The worrying growth of authoritarian elements within the Party of the Right, influenced by the authoritarian anti-socialist turn in the rest of Germany, certainly gives these claims credence."

 gerschl.35.t: "Joseph Bech Calls Referendum on Maulkuerfgesetz"
 gerschl.35.d: "The Chamber of Deputies of Luxembourg passed the infamous Maulkuerfgesetz with a majority vote — however, this was not the end of the story. Enormous protests took to the streets in the small Western state, demanding Bech's resignation and the revocation of the antidemocratic \"muzzle law\". Criticism on the national level was equally fierce — numerous parties, including the SPD, LVP, and even the progressive elements of Zentrum lodged their criticism, especially as neither the Luxembourger government nor the major steel producers have even considered negotiation with the strikers.\n\nFrustrated with the opposition, Bech chose to put an end to this rhetoric once and for all, by announcing a referendum on the Maulkuerfgesetz — believing that he represents the \"silent minority\" outside the main working-class towns, he expects to win the referendum with a large margin and legitimise his authoritarian move."
 gerschl.35.a: "We will see the results in three months."

 gerschl.36.t: "Maulkuerfgesetz Passes in Luxembourg"
 gerschl.36.d: "The Chamber of Deputies of Luxembourg passed the infamous Maulkuerfgesetz with a majority vote — however, this was not the end of the story. Enormous protests took to the streets in the small Western state, demanding Bech's resignation and the revocation of the antidemocratic \"muzzle law\". Criticism on the national level was equally fierce - numerous parties, including the SPD, LVP, and even the progressive elements of Zentrum lodged their criticism, especially as neither the Luxembourger government nor the major steel producers have even considered negotiation with the strikers.\n\nHowever, Bech received the endorsement of the Reichskanzler and his government, and, subsequently, the wide breadth of right-wing media throughout the Empire. Throughout the following weeks, endorsements of the Maulkuerfgesetz drowned out the criticism and, ultimately, led to the protests against the law receding in Luxembourg. Still, however, most believe that the state is heading towards outright authoritarianism..."
 gerschl.36.a: "Finally, some progress."

 gerschl.37.t: "Schleicher Out, SPD In"
 gerschl.37.d: "The beginning of the Ruhr General Strike, the greatest challenge to the political establishment of the Empire since 1925, ultimately proved to be Reichskanzler Schleicher's undoing. The \"Red General\"'s plot, as suspected, was to keep the strike going for as long as possible in order to pressure the establishment parties into supporting him, as the only option to prevent syndicalism — yet, he was unable to handle the situation.\n\nThe SPD and its allies, an informal alliance known as the \"Democratic Union\" (Demokratische Union), took advantage of the situation. The strike has grown moderate enough that its leadership began open cooperation with the Social Democrats, and through his progressive allies close to the Kaiser, Hermann Müller convinced the court, including Wilhelm II, that a Social Democratic government will be able to settle the strike swiftly - and ensure that such mass industrial actions do not repeat again. This proved more attractive than the Reichskanzler's vague promises of national security. Though Schleicher fought to the best of his ability, he was forced to resign.\n\nHis role in history will thus be that of a mere interim period, an independent who led Germany for a few brief months before handing the reins over to the government of Hermann Müller. For the first time in the Empire's history, a Social Democrat has been begrudgingly appointed as the Reichskanzler - all of the Empire's resistance and conservatism could not stand against the march of history."

 gerschl.38.t: "Kaiser Loses Faith in Schleicher"
 gerschl.38.d: "The beginning of the Ruhr General Strike, the greatest challenge to the political establishment of the Empire since 1925, ultimately proved to be Reichskanzler Schleicher's undoing. The \"Red General\"'s plot, as suspected, was to keep the strike going for as long as possible in order to pressure the establishment parties into supporting him, as the only option to prevent syndicalism — yet, he was unable to handle the situation.\n\nThe DkP and the DVLP, joining forces in the \"Black-White-Red\" (Schwarz-Weiß-Rot) alliance, took advantage of the situation. Through the Kaiser's reactionary advisors in the royal court, Kuno von Westarp and Ulrich von Hassell convinced him that a united conservative government will immediately defeat the strikers with force and put an end to their syndicalist plotting. This proved more attractive than the Reichskanzler's vague promises of national security. Though Schleicher fought to the best of his ability, he was forced to resign.\n\nHis role in history will thus be that of a mere interim period, an independent who led Germany for a few brief months before handing the reins over to the government of Ewald von Kleist-Schmenzin - an independent appointed to mediate between the two powerful coalition partners. For the first time in decades, a true conservative government leads Germany again - years of parliamentarisation, liberalism and reform could not hold back the reaction of the German conservatives, and they've returned with a vengeance."
 gerschl.38.a: "Let us hope this does not end in something terrible."

 gerschl.39.t: "Peace in the Ruhr"
 gerschl.39.d: "The Ruhr general strike is over. Moderate, revisionist factions of the uprising who sought material gains for their workers have either been appeased or surrendered due to supreme force from Berlin, while radicals which envisioned this rising as the foundation of a German revolution have been scattered. For now, an uneasy peace has set in the Ruhr.\n\nConservative press has already proudly declared victory against \"syndicalist and anarchist terrorists who sought to overthrow the state and bring forth a reign of terror\". Their liberal and socialist counterparts are more reserved, their journalists commenting that such incidents are likely to continue unless a comprehensive reform to labour law and social security is passed. Though some agree, others, such as the Hugenberg concern and other far-right activists, were only radicalised in their opposition to socialism by the events."
 gerschl.39.a: "We will have to make labour reforms in the future."

 # Notes for later events:
 # There should be some sort of strength scale where you have to stay within the golden mean throughout to keep Schleicher

 gerschl.40.t: "Red Brunswick"
 gerschl.40.d: "The tensions and conflict in Germany have finally spilled over - and a terrifying spark has just been lit in the small, industrialised Duchy of Brunswick. During an absence by Duke Ernst August and his wife, Princess Viktoria Louise of Prussia, for a solemn celebration of the sovereign's birthday at the family's winter residence of Cumberland Castle in Upper Austria, violence and fighting broke out on the streets on the capital. The small statelet has been engulfed by the general strike for months, and yet the Minister-President, Werner Küchenthal, refused to make any concessions to the socialist movement. In spite of these vast historic class tensions and a past attempt at revolution in 1918, the government and political system remained conservative, refusing to implement universal suffrage and clutching onto a system of plural voting to contain the growth of Social Democrats and the far left.\n\nOver time, however, secret armament of worker self-defence groups in Brunswick and defections from the small Brunswickian garrison turned the tide in favour of the strikers, and yet another police raid at midnight in November led to a sudden violent response from the workers. The police and garrison were defeated in street clashes, barricades were erected and the revolutionaries occupied several public buildings, including the police headquarters, railway station and the prisons. Küchenthal's government fled from the Duchy, and the leader of the Brunswicker KAPD, Rudolf Lindau, has proclaimed the creation of the Socialist Republic of Brunswick off the steps of Brunswick Palace."

 gerschl.41.t: "The Enabling Act"
 gerschl.41.d: "The next session of the Reichstag was held with horror in the air. The overthrow of a legitimate government of a German state by socialist revolutionaries immediately pressed almost the entire legislature to unite behind the Reichskanzler, Kurt von Schleicher, who immediately took advantage of the situation. The first motion discussed in the Reichstag today was presented from the government and read out by the Chancellor himself.\n\nCiting the extraordinary conditions in the Empire and the necessity for a strong national government during an emergency, Schleicher invoked the experience of 1914 and presented an Enabling Act to the Reichstag. This act would suspend the power of parliamentary no confidence for its duration to ensure national stability and grant the Reichskanzler the ability to enact executive decrees at will, with only the counter-signature of the Kaiser. The Reichstag's assent would still be required for declarations of war and peace, however, and the Reichstag would also hold the ability to revoke the Act once the crisis is deemed to be over.\n\nMuch of the legislature was already convinced that only a stronger government under Schleicher could afford an answer to the current malaise, while the doubters on the left and the right were whipped into line by Schleicher's hints that a defeated Enabling Act may mean his resignation, spiraling the Empire into further disarray in this critical moment. Aside for a few dissenters among the far left and SPD, the Enabling Act passed almost unanimously, and marks a new page in the history of the Empire."

 GER_enabling_act: "The §YEnabling Act§! has been passed."

 gerschl.42.t: "Reichsexekution on Brunswick"
 gerschl.42.d: "Under Article 19 of the Constitution of the German Empire, the Bundesrat is able to grant permission for a Reichsexekution — an intervention against a federal state in the condition that the state does not fulfil its constitutional duties. Until today, this power had never been used in the Empire's history. There are several ways how a state may not fulfil their duties — refusing to pay its matricular contributions to the budget or provide the necessary military contingents, introducing laws that violate the Constitution, or \"being responsible for activities against the existence of the Empire\". The last of them was invoked in a session of the Bundesrat today, where the council unanimously approved a Reichsexekution against Brunswick.\n\nNormally, an Exekution would first take the form of negotiations before military force is considered, but the government dismissed the option from the outset. The Brunswicker socialists had no desire to end their struggle with mere concessions, either - the Socialist Republic was being rapidly reorganised and has already established a small militia, preparing for the onslaught and hoping to endure the crackdown until the rest of the Empire raises the flag of revolution.\n\nArticle 19 states that the Kaiser, though his government, executes the Reichsexekution. The task falls upon the Reichskanzler to organise the troops to suppress this failed revolution."
 gerschl.42.a: "Order will be reestablished!"

 gerschl.43.t: "End of the Brunswick Revolution"
 gerschl.43.d: "The operation to extinguish the revolutionary events in Brunswick took place at haste, aiming to snuff out the Brunswick socialists before any other cities or states fall to the syndicalist scourge. Mobilised units of the Imperial German Army crossed the border early in the morning, and though they caught the militias protecting the small duchy unaware, a response was soon organised and clashes broke out across the streets of the capital. However, even highly motivated workers could not resist disciplined soldiers and heavily armoured vehicles - tanks drove through the hastily erected barricades and militia units were scattered after swift firefights. In the Brunswick Palace, Chairman Rudolf Lindau and the small cabinet of the Socialist Republic were found and rounded up.\n\nThough Werner Küchenthal returned to Brunswick soil, he was not reapponted as Minister-President - instead, after agreement between the Reichskanzler and Duke Ernst Augustus, a non-partisan State Commissar was appointed to manage the restoration of order in the state. Brunswick is now de facto under central control from Berlin. Executions of main leadership of the Brunswick revolutionary attempt, including Lindau, took place in the capital's prison soon afterwards. Understandably, the suppression of the Socialist Republic was decried as bloodthirsty tyranny in socialist press."
 gerschl.43.a: "The red flag will never fly here!"

 gerschl.44.t: "Paramilitary Intervention in Brunswick"
 gerschl.44.d: "Though a Reichsexekution on Brunswick may have been declared, the government delayed action for one reason or another — leading to utter chaos in Brunswick, as the citizens themselves took arms to put an end to the revolutionary upheaval. Remnants of security forces and police forces of Brunswick, joined by army veterans and activists from numerous far right associations, staged an uprising in the unstable Socialist Republic — and after several days of brutal street fighting, this so-called \"Free Corps (Freikorps) of Brunswick\" managed to overthrow the revolutionary regime and suppress the socialist uprising. Extremist paramilitaries and vengeful loyalists to the House of Hanover did not hesitate to enact vigilante justice upon everyone perceived to be working with the revolution, leading to hundreds of executions and ceaseless brutality in the aftermath. The Schleicher government was forced to accept this as a fait accompli and appoint a temporary military occupation government to manage the member state until civilian rule could be restored, but this failure is a deep scar upon the people's faith in the Chancellor, and the trust which Germany commands overseas. The Third Internationale will certainly make martyrs of the revolutionaries executed in this \"White Terror\".\n\nBecause of the chaotic suppression of the Brunswick Revolution, violence and bloodshed continued across the Duchy for numerous months, leading to further reprisals and escalation of terror. The most infamous casualty of this chaos was the wife of Duke Ernst Augustus of Brunswick, Princess Viktoria Louise of Prussia - she was killed on accident by a syndicalist revolutionary aiming for her husband, and was granted a tearful state funeral. The ire of the Royal Family falls not just upon the revolutionaries, however, but also upon Chancellor Schleicher, who could have prevented this tragedy..."

 gerschl.45.t: "Weakening Schleicher-Block"
 gerschl.45.d: "Over months, the Reichstag has divided itself into several hostile camps, and the one that is aligned with Reichskanzler Schleicher is rapidly dwindling. More and more factions in the legislature have declared their loyalty to the SPD's or the conservatives' no confidence vote, to the point where only the Reichskanzler's guile and ability to play off both sides has allowed him to remain in power.\n\nThis ploy cannot last forever, however. Schleicher's ability to call upon his contacts is dwindling and the parties that still see him as the best solution for Germany are reconsidering their choice. It might not be too late for them to hop on the train and secure a government ministry in the next government, after all."

 gerschl.46.d: "After some time, during which they assessed the situation and then witnessed the establishment of a right-wing government in Prussia, the Polish workers in the industrial Upper Silesia region have joined the ongoing strike. The motion to pledge themselves to the goals of the Ruhr workers was taken as a collaboration between the two main Polish labour unions in the German Empire — the Polish Professional Association (Zjednoczenie Zawodowe Polskie) of a Christian and national character which generally focuses on the Poles in the Ruhr, and the Central Trade Union of Poland (Centralny Związek Zawodowy Polski) that is closer with the socialists and SPD. Dozens of thousands of workers in the coal mines and steel mills of Upper Silesia have emptied their work places and their peers in the Ruhr have joined their German comrades.\n\nThe decision by the Polish trade unions has inflamed the generally tepid relations between the Germans and Poles in the ethnically mixed Upper Silesian region — the German workers have generally refused to associate with the strike and this move has made them even less likely to join forces. This has been criticised by the chairman of the ZZP, Józef Rymer, in the press organs of the union, describing this as \"the use of ethnic tensions as a tool by the developing Prussian dictatorship to divide the workers in their struggle for rights\"."
 gerschl.46.a: "They will perish like the rest."

 gerschl.47.t: "Founding Conference of the National Unity Front"
 gerschl.47.d: "Ever since Kurt von Schleicher's rise to power, his followers both in government and across the nation have called for him to turn his movement of national revival into an official organisation, one which can aid him in his vision and provide him a base of support against his numerous opponents. For the longest time, Schleicher was not recipient to such calls — such a move would only make German politics more divisive, as he explained back in 1936. Times change, however, and the Reichskanzler has given his informal approval for the formation of a movement standing behind the Reichskanzler — the German National Unity Front.\n\nReichstag members of the \"Schleicher-Block\", civil society groups and circles such as the League for the Reorganisation of the Reich (Bund zur Erneuerung des Reiches, or the Luther-Bund), and numerous independents and right-wing politicians finding opportunity in alignment with the Reichskanzler are expected to appear in the party's founding conference in Berlin, the beating heart of the Empire. Schleicher himself, emphasising his independent, all-unifying position, is not expected to become a member of the party, but will be a key speaker and his position will shape the direction his following will take.\n\nForeign observers watch with concern, witnessing hints and makings of a populist right-wing movement that already took Russia and Romania by storm - more conservative and moderate, perhaps, but still a concerning development in German politics."

 GER_schleicher_founding_conference_tt: "§YWe shall define the nature of the Front in a chain of events.§!"

 gerschl.48.t: "The Nature of the Front"
 gerschl.48.d: "The concept of partisanship itself is controversial in the German right, as the partisan conflicts within the Reichstag and the public at large are seen as a cause of the Empire's decline. A political party could never truly represent the entirety of Germany, all of its different social, political and ethnic groups, as it must necessarily attach itself to a specific ideology and worldview. An alternate solution for the Reichskanzler and his followers would be to establish not a party, but a movement, one which transcends party lines and focuses on organic work rather than petty politicking.\n\nThe Fatherland Party was one such movement before its reorganisation into a party, allowing members from different political parties to participate and work together, and numerous interest leagues, such as the Agrarian League and the Navy League, are also successful examples. Perhaps the old political parties of Germany can remain, but simply decay into irrelevance as the entire nation, from the left to the far right, join in support of the Reichskanzler? Or perhaps the organisational efficiency of a political party with a strict membership and ideology will be more helpful to Schleicher's goals?"
 gerschl.48.a: "It is a political party, representing a new force in German politics."
 gerschl.48.b: "It is not a party, but a movement for every patriotic German."

 gerschl.49.t: "The Breadth of the Front"
 gerschl.49.d: "Political parties in the German Empire are mass parties, surrounded by civil society organisations which provide practical benefits to party members and develop disparate members into communities. The reach of any individual party is limited due to natural processes, however. Now entrenched in power, the Front can make a step further and develop itself into a mass movement that will make itself permanent, total in daily life. Youth organisations, women's groups, veteran groups and affiliates in different sectors of society, such as agriculture, sports, the arts and business, all would help orchestrate the creation of a loyal, dutiful German nation, where discipline and patriotic allegiance prevails. Of course, this would also mean that participation in the Front is a sign of political loyalty, and thus permission to advance in public career.\n\nThis would make Schleicher's regime veer closer towards the total control pursued by National Populists in Russia or Romania, in which the party and state have become effectively one and the same. In addition, such massification of partisanship would not appease everyone - politicians and aristocrats in Schleicher's circle see such moves as a dilution of politics into mere spectacle and lifeless speeches, rather than organic work."

 gerschl.49.b: "We are a group of trusted loyalists, no need for a mass following."

 gerschl.50.t: "Failings of Parliamentarism"
 gerschl.50.d: "Though he came to power through the democratic process and has spoken positively of the March Constitution and the German parliamentary system, the Reichskanzler has surrounded himself with men and women that have no love for parliamentarism and it is no mystery that he himself prefers a stronger hand regime. The parliamentarisation of German governance has led to weak governments led by men of no charisma and filled with sycophants, and all attention has been drawn towards the Reichstag instead, its battles and its scandals.\n\nProfessor Carl Schmitt, one of Schleicher's allies and a participant in the founding conference, is known throughout the Empire as a critic of parliamentarism - his thesis of liberal democracy as a system detached from the nation, which fosters a new aristocracy and gradually enters decay, resonates with many in Schleicher's circle. If we include these theses as tenets of our party programme, our solution to the decay of liberal democracy will be a government of decisive action, which wields power beyond the slow parliamentary process in order to address the true desires of the people and the German nation."
 gerschl.50.a: "We will include prof. Schmitt's brilliant critique of parliamentarism."
 gerschl.50.b: "Make no overt comments on the democratic system in the programme."

 gerschl.51.t: "Comments on Economic Policy"
 gerschl.51.d: "Ever since the Weltkrieg, where he criticised war profiteering as an officer-bureaucrat in the Kriegsamt, Schleicher has held the reputation of an economically progressive politician. Among the alliances he tactically developed during the postwar period are several trade unions, and key trade unionists, such as Lothar Erdmann and Theodor Leipart, are in his circle, endorsing the formation of a national state-controlled trade union federation to mediate conflicts between business and labour. The Reichskanzler has also not shied away from endorsements of economic autarky and military focused developmentalism — with the efforts of the state, he believes, a stronger, self-reliant economy can be built to serve the Imperial German Army.\n\nEconomic policy is a major point of contention in the debates on the party programme of the Front, as while the left wing of Schleicher's movement hopes he continues with his reputation as the \"Red General\", the conservatives and business leaders he has earned the trust of wish for him to cease with the heartless populism. They would much rather prefer a stronger stance on syndicalism, the root of all evil in the modern day."

 gerschl.52.d: "Culturally conservative, Schleicher has made comments in the past years that many of Germany's economic and cultural problems have risen because of the loss of their connection to the soil and nation, and has responded positively to proposed restrictions on free speech to halt the \"defamation\" of the state and \"corruption\" of the arts. It is a view he shares with much of the German right, and emphasising these views could grant the Reichskanzler powerful allies. The so-called \"National Revolutionaries\" of the DVLP, united around Ulrich von Hassell, rebuilt their party on populist conservative grounds with a heavy dose of Christian rural culture and Sammlungspolitik (right-wing unity politics).\n\nNot only that, but their ideal Germany is one led by an imperialist, charismatic strongman who can transcend toxic parliamentarism to guide the Empire as a sole, capable ruler — Schleicher's persona, though rather too pragmatic and \"progressive\" for their taste, could attract at least some among the ranks of the DVLP. This would entail specific articles on protecting traditional values in the Front's programme, as well as even stronger emphasis on anti-socialism and anti-parliamentarism."
 gerschl.52.a: "Attract \"National Revolutionaries\" by endorsing Christian rural culture."
 gerschl.52.b: "Remain vague on cultural policies and religion."

 gerschl.53.t: "Centralisation of the State"
 gerschl.53.d: "One of Schleicher's key goals is to further and complete the centralisation of the German Empire at the expense of its member states, thus completing the vision of Otto von Bismarck. Though some moves in the centralised direction, granting additional powers and authorities to the regime in Berlin and wielding soft power to curtail the unruly Southern states, can be accomplished relatively quickly, the constitutional balance of power between the Empire and its states is much harder to alter. The Reichskanzler places his hopes in the Second Weltkrieg, however — should he lead the Empire to victory against the syndicalists, the postwar fervour will surely grant him the political capital to amend or even rewrite the Imperial Constitution to his liking.\n\nRumours of the so-called \"Schleicher Constitution\" are already scattered throughout the newspapers thanks to comments slipped by government authorities on the necessity to \"enact constitutional reform\", but the foundation of the Front gives an opportunity to make this desire official. Such a decision would greatly alarm the States, but help unite the centralist elements of German politics around our banner."
 gerschl.53.a: "Openly proclaim our desire to promulgate a centralised \"Schleicher Constitution\"."
 gerschl.53.b: "Remain vague on federal relations."

 gerschl.54.t: "Position on the Jewish Population"
 gerschl.54.d: "Political antisemitism has been present in German politics for many decades, and time, the Bolshevik and syndicalist revolutions, and the Black Monday crisis have only seen it grow. Among the grassroots rural agrarian right, and the slowly growing and strengthening middle class in the cities, xenophobic positions see widespread acclaim, from calls to curtail Jewish business, land speculation, immigration and perceived influence in newspapers, to extreme positions such as expulsion to Palestine. Of the major political parties, only the DVLP explicitly has antisemitic points in their programme, but other right-wing parties have to accept prevalence of antisemitic positions among their membership.\n\nSchleicher is personally not antisemitic and has described antisemitism as \"the greatest folly\" in an interview before his Chancellorship, and his overarching idea of a united German society may include the German Jews as well, but his party will inevitably have to address antisemitism somehow or else risk losing a portion of their support base to the radical right."
 gerschl.54.a: "Limit ourselves to unofficial dogwhistles at most."
 gerschl.54.b: "The programme will mention goals to curtail non-German business and culture."

 gerschl.55.t: "The Front and the Monarchy"
 gerschl.55.d: "No mainstream political party in the German Empire calls for the abolition of the monarchy - while the approval of the current Kaiser can certainly vary and is not very positive even among the right, the monarchy as an institution is viewed as a symbol of Germany as a whole, and its replacement with an elected presidency is either extreme radicalism or a vague distant change that is nothing to die for. The Front is expected to fit itself into this Overton window as well - the question lies, however, on how much this monarchism should be emphasised in the programme.\n\nExplicit monarchism and extoltations towards the Kaiser would strengthen the trust of those conservatives who are suspicious of Schleicher's intentions, but would weaken the Reichskanzler's standing among the liberal and social democratic wings of German politics, to whom the monarchy would best serve as a figurehead that every party could safely ignore."
 gerschl.55.a: "Proclaim that we are, first and foremost, a monarchist party, and extol the Kaiser."
 gerschl.55.b: "Merely state our acceptance of the current system."

 gerschl.56.t: "The Conference Finished"
 gerschl.56.d: "All of the important questions regarding the direction and ideology of the National Unity Front have been settled — and, as expected, the majority of the attendees declared their full allegiance with the tenets of the programme. After it was approved by a majority vote in the convention, a series of speeches followed — among the most well received speakers were Hans Luther, Lothar Erdmann, Otto Gessler, Siegfried von Kardorff and Paul Reusch, all of whom were also included into the central committee of the newly established party. Finally, the Reichskanzler himself spoke a few words before the delegates, commending them on \"the duty of the renewal of the Empire they have choson to place on their shoulders\" and stating that \"the delegates gathered today are certainly up for the task, and I hope to achieve productive work with them\".\n\nSchleicher himself remains independent, so the chairmanship of the Front falls to Hans Luther, the former Mayor of Essen and Secretary of Finance. However, he is expected to be merely a first among equals in the central committee and a figurehead. After a final collective singing of \"Heil dir im Siegerkranz\", the National Unity Front was proudly proclaimed to be founded."
 gerschl.56.a: "Hurrah, followers of the Second Bismarck!"

 gerschl.57.t: "Rise of the Luxembourger Fundamentalists"
 gerschl.57.d: "Worrisome developments are taking place in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg.\n\nThe passing of the Maulkuerfgesetz has already resulted in the banning of the KAPD, KPD and other far left parties on Luxembourger soil, but this is not enough for the entrenched regime of the Party of the Right. The Maulkuerfgesetz was endorsed by the \"Fundamentalist\" faction of the party, championed by priest and party ideologue Jean-Baptiste Esch, who believe that the Party of the Right should form a single party state on the principles of Political Catholicism and the collaboration of the social classes. It is known that President of the Council Joseph Bech is sympathetic to their ideas as well, and so are many in the Party — after all, they live on the border with the Commune, and few in Germany fear French revolutionary belligerence more than they do.\n\nStrengthened and emboldened by the passing of the Maulkuerfgesetz, the Fundamentalists have increased their hold upon the party and pushed through several additional reforms in Luxembourg — all parties besides the Party of the Right have been severely restricted, a government controlled Christian trade union was established and all independent unions were banned, and freedom of the press has been restricted. Luxembourg is becoming an authoritarian regime — as the Frankfurter Zeitung described, it is \"a dictatorial ulcer in the heart of Germany\"."
 gerschl.57.a: "Curious."

 gerschl.58.t: "The Tat Circle"
 gerschl.58.d: "In order to mobilise the masses in this day and age, influential allies in the media are indispensable, as the democrats and rightists have shown us in recent years. As a non-partisan military man, Schleicher unfortunately lacks this far-reaching crucial media support — with the help of the so-called \"Tat Circle\", that is now going to change. The editorship of the Berlin-based monthly journal \"Die Tat\" (The Action) has been a stalwart ally of Schleicher's political vision for quite some time; in fact, it played a crucial role during the fateful weeks in spring 1936, during which the magazine acted as a powerful opinion leader in the media campaign that eventually resulted in Schleicher's controversial appointment as Reichskanzler.\n\nExtremely popular in intellectual patriotic youth circles, \"Die Tat\" aims for the reversal of the March Constitution order and the instatement of a non-partisan, charismatic leader who is able to synthesise the best components from both the left and the right into an entirely new ideology: \"German Socialism\", or \"Nationaler Sozialismus\". According to Chief Editor Hans Zehrer, all existing parties have been deeply corrupted by \"liberal\" currents, and only the creation of something entirely new will be able to strengthen the German Volksgemeinschaft in its struggle against syndicalism and Savinkovism. Of course, Schleicher's Querverbindung ideas and his close cooperation with the trade unions, no matter which ideology, fit well into that agenda.\n\nDuring the past months, the young and charismatic Zehrer has closely worked together with Schleicher to advise him on domestic and foreign political affairs. This symbiosis between \"Die Tat\" and the Reich Chancellery might now grow even closer. Zehrer and his colleagues have recently acquired the formerly Christian Conservative newspaper \"Tägliche Rundschau\" and are now planning to transform it into one of the most important propaganda flagships for the government's vision; while \"Die Tat\" will continue to appeal especially to an intellectual audience, the Rundschau has to be the paper for the masses."
 gerschl.58.a: "Finally, good patriotic media."

 gerschl.59.t: "Report on a Disappearance"
 gerschl.59.d1: "Today, German newspapers have reported on the disappearance of a fairly notable journalist influential in the Empire's civil society throughout the past decade. After 1936, this journalist moved to opposition against the government, reporting on authoritarian measures and calling for a new election which would form a government responsible to the Reichstag. Some will call conspiracy, but are too afraid to show themselves and say that in public.\n\nIt is likely that, in time, the body of the unfortunate victim will be found, but, by then, the trail will already have gone cold and the citizens of the Empire will be either forced to accept mere unfounded allegations or simply move on."
 gerschl.59.d2: "Today, German newspapers have reported on the disappearance of a former member of one of the state parliaments, aligned with the reformist parties. After 1936, this politician moved to opposition against the government, demanding an end to the Enabling Act and calling for a new election which would form a government responsible to the Reichstag. Some will call conspiracy, but are too afraid to show themselves and say that in public.\n\nIt is likely that, in time, the body of the unfortunate victim will be found, but, by then, the trail will already have gone cold and the citizens of the Empire will be either forced to accept mere unfounded allegations or simply move on."
 gerschl.59.d3: "Today, German newspapers have reported on the disappearance of a former left wing union leader and participant in the Ruhrkampf. After 1936, this trade unionist moved to opposition against the government, calling out the Red General's shallow appeasement of the trade unions and calling for a new election which would form a government responsible to the Reichstag. Some will call conspiracy, but are too afraid to show themselves and say that in public.\n\nIt is likely that, in time, the body of the unfortunate victim will be found, but, by then, the trail will already have gone cold and the citizens of the Empire will be either forced to accept mere unfounded allegations or simply move on."
 gerschl.59.a: "Whoops."

 gerschl.60.t: "The 1938 Budget Vote"
 gerschl.60.d: "According to the Imperial Constitution, the annual budget of the German Empire was proposed by the Imperial government and approved by the Reichstag and the Bundesrat. Each item on the budget had to be discussed separately, allowing the parliamentarians to lodge directed criticism towards government policies. With the Enabling Act eroding away standard parliamentary procedure and reducing the ability of the parliament to control the Reichskanzler's actions, the democratic opposition parliamentarians — which now include many SPD, LVP and left-wing Zentrum deputies — expected to use the budget vote to hit Schleicher hard. In the Bundesrat, similar plans were being crafted by a bloc of opposition-aligned states.\n\nThe Reichskanzler was aware of these plans. After discussing the matter with his clique of advisors and informing the Kaiser of his plans — and receiving his green light after a short discussion — he announced something unexpected. Stating that the stability and national security of the Empire depends on the steady funding for the government apparatus without it being bogged down with parliamentary debates, he invoked the Enabling Act to approve an \"emergency budget\" for 1938, even though pretty much everyone understood that there was nothing \"emergency\" about it.\n\nThe news caused an uproar, accusations of powergrabs and imposition of dictatorship, and enormous protest. Thousands of German citizens took to the streets of the major cities - however, most of the protests were suppressed by mobilised police and military units.\n\nThe last vestiges of power are slipping away from the grasp of the old institutions..."
 gerschl.60.a: "Procedure matters little in the modern age."

 gerschl.61.t: "The Red General and the Landvolk"
 gerschl.61.d: "Having survived the great crises of 1936, the Schleicher cabinet must now turn words into deeds. The agricultural crisis that has plagued Germany since the late 1920s has become even worse in the wake of Black Monday, and DkP State Secretary of Agriculture Martin Schiele, who has been in office for several years, has not yet been able to deliver sustainable results. His strong advocacy for the complete autarky of the German agricultural sector, a continuation of protectionist tariff policies and even stricter import quotas, has alienated Mitteleuropa proponents, export industry lobbyists and trade union leaders alike. They are fearful that Schiele's policies might aggravate the economic dilemma by destroying wage levels and hampering profitable trade with other countries. Thus, Schiele has no future within Schleicher's government. Who should replace him?\n\nFor Schleicher, two potential options are on the table. A clean break with the methods of old would be one possibility - in keeping with his controversial Querfront strategy, Schleicher could try to build a bridge between left and right. One of his closest confidants is the conservative Saxon civil servant Günther Gereke, Landbund functionary and chairman of the German Rural Municipal Association, a powerful rural interest group. Gereke is an expert on agricultural policy and the social question in the right-wing camp and a proponent of cross-partisan cooperation, which he is used to in his role as a lobby group functionary. In cooperation with the high-ranking SPD agricultural expert Fritz Baade, who could be assigned to Gereke as an Under-Secretary of State, a completely new and innovative approach to solving the agricultural crisis would be possible. This decision, however, might be controversial in Junker circles. A young, dynamic representative of the old order like the Rhenish agricultural functionary Hermann von Lüninck, well-connected both in the local Landbund and in Catholic farmers' associations and willing to balance the interests of landowners, farmers, and industry, could be a less divisive compromise candidate overall."
 gerschl.61.a: "Choose Gereke and Baade, for a more thorough approach!"
 gerschl.61.b: "Choose Lüninck, the West German compromiser!"

 gerschl.62.t: "A Pragmatist with a Firm Hand"
 gerschl.62.d: "Hermann von Lüninck, chairman of the Rhenish Peasant Association, has been one of the rising stars of the German agricultural lobby for several years, and not without reason. Aristocratic, Catholic, and yet populist, Lüninck represents a new type of landowner, much different to the East Elbian elites of old - his religious background and Western German origin make it harder for his critics to defame him as a typical \"Krautjunker\". Lüninck's vision in the recent past consists mainly of enforcing closer cooperation between the Empire's two largest agricultural lobby groups, the Protestant Reichslandbund (RLB) and the Catholic Association of the German Farmers Associations (VdB), which the Rhenish Peasant Association is a part of, to strengthen the agrarian unity front. Said cooperation between RLB and VdB has already started in the Rhineland and Westphalia, but similar efforts on the national level have been blocked by powerful Zentrum-affiliated VdB functionaries.\n\nLüninck is of special relevance to us due to his open ear both for agricultural and industrial concerns, something that is rooted in his Western German origin, and tries to involve the plethora of freeholding farmers that dominate the West German agrarian sector closer in agricultural decision-making to break the dominance of East Elbian Junker circles. It is therefore expected that he will approach the crisis with a careful, but firm hand, while granting us valuable connections to agriculture and industry."
 gerschl.62.a: "Compromises have to be made - this is one of them."

 gerschl.63.t: "Gespann Gereke-Baade"
 gerschl.63.d: "Günther Gereke and Fritz Baade are one of the strangest combinations that Schleicher's cross-party Querfront concept has brought forth: The conservative civil servant from Prussian Saxony and the SPD-aligned agricultural and economic expert with his own estate in the Province of Hanover do not seem to share many similarities. In fact, however, the two men have a lot in common: agricultural expertise of the highest quality and pronounced pragmatism, willing to achieve the best for Germany during the darkest times no matter the partisan affiliation.\n\nGereke, a close associate of Schleicher, has long been a bit of an outsider within the DkP due to his ties to many different political camps. Far-right populist Landbund functionaries from Thuringia are just as much part of his circle of acquaintances as the social democratic economist Rudolf Hilferding. The German Rural Municipal Association that he presides over represents many different parties, trade unions, and farmhand associations, and therefore seems exemplary for underpinning Schleicher's political vision. The same holds true for Baade, long-time social democratic champion against orthodox Marxist doctrine. Thanks in part to his efforts, the SPD reformed their agrarian programme from ground up in the late 1920s, borrowing heavily from liberal concepts. Baade is also renowned as an economist, most recently thanks to his controversial plan for solving the economic crisis, co-authored with Fritz Tarnow.\n\nWe can count on the Gespann Gereke-Baade to strengthen the situation of smallholding farmers in particular and to push back the damaging influence of the Junkers, which has fuelled the agrarian crisis in recent years. The SPD and DkP leadership are not one hundred percent enthusiastic about Schleicher's choice, and Gereke and Baade are facing fierce criticism - but that should settle down soon."
 gerschl.63.a: "Two advocates for the interests of all strata of society!"

 gerschl.64.t: "An Agrarian Bolshevist?"
 gerschl.64.d: "As of late, agrarian-conservative journals in the Empire have revolved around only one topic: The controversial agricultural policy pursued by Reichskanzler Schleicher and his cross-partisan Agricultural Secretariat. Earlier this week, the Kreuzzeitung, Germany's leading traditional conservative newspaper, published a several-page commentary on Günther Gereke and Fritz Baade, accusing them of using their policies to further the \"disenfranchisement of the East\" and the class division in the countryside, which has lead to almost \"Russian or French conditions\" everywhere. Even harsher criticism was voiced by Count Eberhard von Kalckreuth, the German Landbund's most important leadership figure: He went so far as to defame the entire Schleicher Cabinet as being staffed by \"Agrarian Bolshevists\". After tremendous pressure, the DkP decided to expel its black sheep from the party, so that Gereke is now listed as an independent conservative.\n\nIt is a fact that great ambitions always conjure up detractors - but it is also indisputable that as long as the old agrarian Junker establishment remains in opposition to us, our scope of action will be massively limited."
 gerschl.64.a: "Just ignore them."

 gerschl.65.t: "Bauernwall"
 gerschl.65.d: "Schleicher may act like a statesman, but deep inside he still has the zeal of a general staff officer — everything the Reichskanzler envisions inevitably also serves defence purposes, and so does his agricultural programme. The connection between border security, people's armament, job creation and rural settlement is undeniable. The Junkers' large, inefficient grain fields lie fallow, contributing not to Germany's economic recovery but to agricultural ruin, and on top of that provide no protection against foreigners infiltrating our sacred lands.\n\nSince the end of the war, the Poles in the neighbouring kingdom have officially become our allies and friends, but the silent struggle between Germans and Poles in the East has still not come to an end. The Prussian Poles are well organised with their own patriotic clubs and settlement associations, legally buying foreclosed Junker land and thereby Polonising our border regions largely unopposed. Schleicher's settlement policy is intended to actively counteract this and to achieve by means of internal colonisation what Ludendorff wanted to accomplish 20 years earlier via a forcibly annexed, Germanised Polish border strip — the creation of a vigorous human \"peasant wall\", a Bauernwall, against Slavic expansion along the German-Polish frontier.\n\nThus, one has to perceive the settlement efforts in the east on a much larger, future-oriented scale. In the event that foreign armies dare to cross into East Elbia, as the Asiatic hordes did in East Prussia in 1914, tens of thousands of patriotic small farmers on their own soil armed with shotguns and hunting rifles will be waiting for them, instead of a handful of Junkers fleeing westwards in their luxury cars. For national defence, it is a matter of life and death that there is a population on the Eastern border that is rooted in its soil, that is crisis-proof as far as it is possible in such times of need, and that remains confined to the flat countryside even in our darkest hour!"
 gerschl.65.a: "Kein fussbreit deutscher Erde soll verloren gehen!"

 gerschl.66.t: "The Consensus of Compromise"
 gerschl.66.d: "Even the most populist statesman should not shy away from entering into clandestine deals with questionable figures in the name of national interest — only with the support of the old elites will we be able to put our ambitious goals into practice. An axis of contacts between Düsseldorf, Berlin and East Elbia will ensure that powerful agrarian and industrial interest groups do not undermine, but further our goals. The final goal must be to have loyal contact men in every Chamber of Commerce and Chamber of Agriculture from Belfort to Memel.\n\nThe talks between State Secretary for Agriculture Lüninck and the Esplanade Circle in Berlin have already contributed a large part to this vision, laying the foundation for a potential relaunch of the Cartel of the Productive Estates, of course with the inevitable implications for agricultural and trade policy. Schleicher himself has also launched attempts to burnish his reputation among Western Germany's most powerful industrialists by giving eloquent speeches to the Industrial Club in Düsseldorf, the proverbial \"Desk of the Ruhr\". He is already certain of the generous support of the Thyssen Group, and other large enterprises will follow - this is excellent news in terms of our vision for further armament and militarisation.\n\nWithin his circle of confidants, Schleicher's pragmatic approach towards the old elites, especially the Junkers, is still viewed with ambivalence. His close companion Hans Zehrer, an important right-wing media entrepreneur, is said to have accused Schleicher behind the scenes of deliberately avoiding a clean break with the old conservative-national liberal elites of yesterday and thus standing in the way of the dream of national revolution and rejuvenation. But Schleicher is more foresighted than his overly ideological companions - he will not share the same fate as his predecessor Caprivi more than 40 years ago and let his political vision be foiled by a few angry agrarians, if he can instead opt to wrap them around his finger and intertwine them into his ever-growing spider web of intrigues and power."
 gerschl.66.a: "Keep your friends close, and your enemies closer."

 gerschl.67.t: "Old Wine in a New Bottle"
 gerschl.67.d: "Schleicher may be an opaque person, but one thing is clear for all to see: his strained relationship with State Secretary for Agriculture Hermann von Lüninck, who from the outset had been more of a compromise choice than a desired candidate of the Imperial Chancellery. While Lüninck's agrarian reform programme has been celebrated as a turning point of the entire agrarian crisis on national radio, the actual record speaks volumes. All of his reforms clearly resemble the empty slogans of the old March Coalition governments and ex-State Secretary Martin Schiele, but in a new packaging, with a slightly populist tinge and a somewhat firmer hand of the government.\n\nIn reformist circles, people are sceptical whether the programme will bring about the promised turnaround in the long run. Lüninck's \"Erbhof\" programme has already turned into an over-bureaucratic mess and is vastly unpopular among the rural population due to its inconsequential implementation — it does not leave a good impression when the Imperial government promises legal protection for centuries-old family property in order to enhance the status of the peasantry, only for the Prussian War Ministry to disregard all of these regulations just a few weeks later and confiscate the land for the expansion of military infrastructure, another important component of Schleicher's political vision. Whether the newly \"rationalised\" cooperatives will stop the ever-increasing rural exodus in the long run is still written in the stars, too.\n\nAs things stand, Germany's food supply would probably still be rather shaky in a hypothetical future conflict. In retrospect, Schleicher should probably have stayed true to his principles - but sometimes, one has to look at things with a long term-focus, and as long as the old elites continue to serve our cause faithfully, the German peasantry has to play second fiddle in the name of national interest."
 gerschl.67.a: "It will work out in the end."

 gerschl.68.t: "Rural Support for the Red General"
 gerschl.68.d: "Since time immemorial, the common farmhand has had a harder fate than his urban comrades. Most of our fallen soldiers in the Weltkrieg originated from the simple rural masses, the harvesters, gardeners, milkers, and other members of the rural proletariat, and yet the socio-political concessions for this section of society were far more minor than for employees in industrial enterprises. The pervasive reactionary influence of the Landbund and its affiliated yellow unions effectively prevented a widespread expansion of the social-democratic German Agricultural Workers' Union (DLV) and the Christian national Central Association of Agricultural Workers (ZLA). The influence of the farmhand trade unions is also hampered by ideological divides, with \"godless social democrats\" and \"puppets of the clergy\" uncompromisingly opposed to each other.\n\nBut that was not always the case. In the darkest days of the war, there were brief attempts at cooperation between the Social Democratic union leader Georg Schmidt and the Christian-Social union official Franz Behrens to form a common front of trade union interests against ruinous coercive wartime policies. With the end of the war, the front broke up again, however, and eternal empty debates and pointless hostilities, combined with the constantly worsening economic and agrarian crisis, have put the farmhand in an almost worse position than 25 years ago.\n\nThanks to Reichskanzler Schleicher, there is light at the end of the tunnel. He has managed to bring Behrens and Schmidt back to the table after almost two decades, has personally lauded in a radio address the outstanding achievements of the agricultural workers for the German people, and announced numerous improvements in workers' rights, collective bargaining and protection against exploitative landlords. Not only the smallholder, but also the farmhand is key to keep our society well-fed and satisfied. He has the potential to become one of the most important figureheads of Schleicher's Querfront strategy - if we are assured of the support of the rural masses, soon no one will be able to stop us."
 gerschl.68.a: "Des Bauern Not ist des Volkes Tod!"

 gerschl.69.t: "A Powerful \"Green Front\""
 gerschl.69.d: "After lengthy negotiations, we finally fulfilled one of our most important goals, an omnipresent matter in German agrarian circles during the last few decades: The formation of a United Front of the German Peasantry. With Andreas Hermes driven out of the Catholic VdB's chairmanship, which is now staffed with functionaries loyal to our cause, the Catholic Farmers Associations are not tied to the Zentrum's Rhenish wing anymore and can fully embrace our less conventional vision; and with Eberhard von Kalckreuth willing to make certain concessions to turn the Protestant Landbund's praesidium into a fairer representation of every aspect of Prussian rural life, be it Junkers, smallholders or farmhands, the balance of power between Landbund and VdB will be more evenly distributed within the new unity organisation.\n\nFor many years there had been rejection of such a unification, especially in Catholic circles; it was said that there were insurmountable divides between Catholic and Protestant farmers, politically, confessionally, and socially; that cooperation with the Junkers would discredit the VdB among the Catholic peasantry; and that the Junkers would eventually sideline the Catholics within the organisation. And yet, in the end, the opposite side's arguments prevailed; even more ironically, it was a West German Catholic who was finally able to chalk up this historical achievement.\n\nIn a few days, the agrarian organisations of old will be gone forever. In their place, the Reichsbauernfront (Imperial Farmers' Front) will arise, a nominally independent organisation loyal to the government's agricultural agenda. Even more importantly, it will guarantee that we will not lose control over the German peasantry, something that could be beneficial for our political vision in the future, after the agricultural crisis is resolved. By counterweighting populist and elitist currents within the organisation, it is guaranteed that the moderate centre will come out on top who we already have firmly in our pocket  - we just killed several birds with just one stone."

 gerschl.70.a: "Let's arrange some meetings..."

 gerschl.71.t: "Enthusiasm Among the Trade Unions"
 gerschl.71.d: "A core component of Schleicher's \"Querverbindung\" is the abandonment of fixed coalitions and the formation of cross-party alliances on the back of trade unions and other non-partisan organisations. Amongst the two leading union movements in the Empire, the Christian Trade Unions, traditionally close to the Zentrum and the DkP, and the SPD-aligned Free Trade Unions, the vision is welcomed with open arms. For years, tensions between the unions and their respective parties have intensified, mostly due to dissatisfaction with the policies of their partisan associates; Zentrum and DkP have become the epitomes of standstill, while the SPD's resolute refusal to assume government responsibility as a junior partner has aggravated pragmatic-minded left-wing unionists. Schleicher's vision enables trade unions to have much more direct influence on social policy questions without having to rely on the mediation of useless political parties.\n\nEspecially in the wake of the current crisis, trade union interests can no longer be ignored by Berlin. In times of mass unemployment, strikes have become even more useless as a means of achieving political goals than they already were, and thus, fruitful cooperation across society is a must. Party affiliations and other divisions are finally receding into the background, and the will of the people is replacing the will of political classes. What partisan politicians have been unable to achieve for years must now be transferred by means of the principle of self-help - the most democratic principle of all - to powerful organisations at the base that know how to fulfil the will of the masses in a social and national sense.\n\nAs the first concession to the unions, the well-known Christian trade unionist Adam Stegerwald, a high-ranking member of the Zentrum Party, is to be appointed to the Labour Secretariat. His reputation and charisma should have a mitigating effect in the face of ever-worsening unrest on the streets."
 gerschl.71.a: "A toast to the most fruitful possible cooperation!"

 gerschl.72.t: "Winnig Expelled from SPD"
 gerschl.72.d: "Today, the central committee of the SPD unanimously voted in favour of suspending the membership of August Winnig, an infamous member of the SPD's \"right\" wing. Winnig had a degree of influence within the SPD during the 1920s and 1930s, when he held various high-ranking offices in East Prussia Province and was later elected to the Reichstag - however,  he also quickly diverged from the party mainstream and was described as a \"social imperialist\". As early as 1915, he belonged to the nationalist current of the party and these tendencies only grew after the war.\n\nIn 1935, Winnig was one of the first to endorse Kurt von Schleicher for Reichskanzler, citing his belief that the integration of the German workers into the \"national community\", which he refers to as the \"Standwerdung der Arbeiterschaft\" (empowerment of the workforce), could only be achieved through cooperation with a progressive, yet nationally-minded government. Subsequently, he joined Schleicher's government and remains an important figure there to this day.\n\nMeanwhile, the SPD has long moved on from foolish dreams of achieving economic gains for the proletariat through the \"Red General\", its leadership now seeing his authoritarian measures as actively detrimental to the socialist cause. Winnig's expulsion was thus seen as a natural development - yet, it marks a shift in relationship between the Social Democrats and the Reichskanzler. While Winnig, embittered by the expulsion, intends to attract other national-minded social democrats and trade unionists into the National Unity Front, Schleicher no longer has any qualms with bringing down the full strength of the \"New State\" upon the SPD."

 gerschl.73.t: "The Long-Awaited Unification of the German Trade Union Movement"
 gerschl.73.d: "The seemingly impossible has been achieved: after tireless efforts and negotiations, the Reichskanzler was able to finally forge the unification of the eternally divided German trade union movement. For decades, the rifts between the moderate conservative Christian Trade Unions, the social democratic Free Trade Unions, and the liberal Hirsch-Duncker Unions were too deep to overcome due to partisan and ideological considerations, but in this new era of unionist self-determination heralded under Schleicher, the parties' influence on their aligned trade unions' decision-making has started to fade away.\n\nAn emerging younger generation of constructive, forward-looking trade unionists, long disenchanted by their old idols and partisan allies, played a key role in the negotiations. With the formation of the unified, government-aligned and on paper non-partisan \"Gewerkschaftsbund\", they hope to further expand the domestic political weight of union interests. The young ex-SPD functionary Lothar Erdmann, an old contact of Schleicher, is supposed to chair the new organisation, assisted by high-ranking representatives of all the old trade unions like the Catholic Stegerwald protege Jakob Kaiser, the Free Trade Unions leader Wilhelm Leuschner, or the liberal unionist Ernst Lemmer.\n\nThe scepticism of some of the older union cadres could be calmed via the establishment of a prestigious \"Labour Convent\" in which various old guard trade union leaders are to be appointed for advisory purposes. However, it is apparent that this body is more of a symbolic nature; thus, for now, the old trade unions have not yet fully dissolved or subordinated themselves to the Gewerkschaftsbund, with some of the old leadership figures frantically clinging to their entrenched leading positions.\n\nThe passage of time will also catch up with the rebellious. For the time being, we have no choice but to supplant the remaining rump unions with our loyal men and, if necessary, use determination to persuade the old elites into submission."

 gerbav.1.t: "Bavaria Sues Schleicher"
 gerbav.1.d: "The Zentrum-dominated government of Bavaria has announced an unprecedented decision — they are taking the government of Kurt von Schleicher to the Bundesrat for gross violations of the Constitution. The decision was accepted without significant dissent by Heinrich Held's cabinet and was communicated to Berlin the day after, immediately picked up by newspapers and the public.\n\nThe Bundesrat has been compared to the Senate and the House of Lords as an upper house of the German \"parliament\", though it holds different duties and is considered separate from the Reichstag. It is an assembly of representatives from Germany's federal states which rules on certain government procedures, such as dissolutions of the Reichstag or Reichsexekutions, and it also serves as the supreme constitutional court of the Empire. Never before has it had to rule on a case where a member state takes the federal government to court, however, only on disputes within and between states.\n\nThe Bavarian government declares that Reichskanzler Schleicher's reforms are a violation of the federal principles of the Empire and some of them have even violated the Constitution - in addition, Schleicher has yet to give up his emergency powers in spite of said emergency having passed. The fact that Bavaria is the state championing the federal cause is not unexpected - historically, it was the most protective of its autonomy among Imperial states and extracted greater concessions than any other state in the compromise which led to the foundation of the Empire in 1871. The decision of the Bundesrat may soon test the durability of this compromise."
 gerbav.1.a: "Who do they think they are?"

 gerbav.2.t: "Bundesrat Finds No Violations"
 gerbav.2.d: "After some deliberations, the Bundesrat has found that the government of Kurt von Schleicher has committed no violations of constitutional law and Bavarian claims are therefore unfounded. The news being made public have caused a debate in civil society, reactions ranging either from tacit approval of the judgment to disappointment with perceived infringement of civil rights.\n\nThe government of Bavaria has accepted the defeat for now, but has stated that unless Schleicher's government swiftly abandons its alarmingly centralist line and recognises that the emergency behind the intentions of the Enabling Act has passed, they will be required to take extreme actions to defend federalism."
 gerbav.2.a: "Good, they are put in their place."

 gerbav.3.t: "Bundesrat Makes a Token Resolution"
 gerbav.3.d: "After some deliberations, the Bundesrat has made a resolution requesting the Reichskanzler to follow constitutional law and respect the federalist principles of the German Empire - a statement which is ultimately token and does not commit Schleicher to any action. The news being made public have caused a debate in civil society, reactions ranging either from tacit approval of the judgment to disappointment with perceived infringement of civil rights.\n\nThe government of Bavaria has accepted the defeat for now, but has stated that unless Schleicher's government swiftly abandons its alarmingly centralist line and recognises that the emergency behind the intentions of the Enabling Act has passed, they will be required to take extreme actions to defend federalism."
 gerbav.3.a: "Good, they are put in their place."

 gerbav.4.t: "Bavaria Declares Nullification"
 gerbav.4.d: "Finding no resolution in the courts, the government of Bavaria has chosen an extreme option to force the government to bend to their will - according to a proclamation by the Minister-President, all of the laws passed under Reichskanzler Kurt von Schleicher's constitutionally illegal Enabling Act do not apply on the soil of the Kingdom of Bavaria and will not be enforced by Bavarian authorities. This has immediately raised the attention of the entire Empire to the brewing conflict between the government and the States, and the reactions ranged from tacit support to horror at the possible collapse of the Empire.\n\nIt is a nullification of Imperial Law, unprecedented in the history of the Empire. Even those politicians and public figures opposed to Schleicher's centralising direction and sympathetic to Bavaria's goals of retaining the federal constitutional order raise their eyebrows at this breach of legality - especially due to the dangerous precedent this may cause.\n\nHowever, these are also dramatic times."
 gerbav.4.a: "How dare they?!"
 GER_Bavarian_Nullification: "Nullification of Imperial Law"

 gerbav.5.t: "Meeting of the Cabinet"
 gerbav.5.d: "The shocking news from München were followed by an emergency meeting between the Reichskanzler and his numerous secretaries, as well as delegates of friendly parties in the Reichstag and the Crown Prince as a representative of the interests of the Kaiser. The room agreed that this situation was unprecedented, and, if not managed properly, could lead into a breakdown of the Empire's relations with its constituent states. As a decentralised monarchy built upon the compromise between Prussia and the other member states, such a blow would shake the very constitutional foundations of the German Empire.\n\nThe plurality view in the cabinet favors a harsh approach, which would protect the integrity of the Empire against the rebellion of the state governments. Bavaria's actions can easily be construed as illegal, a violation of a state's duties to the Empire which is pretext enough for an intervention, a Reichsexekution. To clear out any further constitutional issues, this view also supports amending the Enabling Act and giving it additional powers, turning it to a constitutional act that is superior to the whim of any state. Such moves may finally complete Schleicher's dreams of a centralised Germany, but are bound to meet severe resistance.\n\nSome offer negotiation with Bavaria first - though it's unlikely an acceptable compromise will be found without Schleicher's fall, it would delay the constitutionalists and give us additional time to gather allies. Finally, there is the minority view that no centralisation, full or partial, is worth a possible dissolution of the Empire - and faced with such unprecedented resistance, Schleicher should resign and allow a more acceptable government to replace him."
 gerbav.5.a: "We will protect national integrity by any means necessary."
 gerbav.5.b: "We should start with negotiation to resolve this."
 gerbav.5.c: "The only way to win is not to play. Submit my resignation."

 gerbav.6.t: "Resignation of Reichskanzler Schleicher"
 gerbav.6.d: "A flurry of papers filled with shocked news articles have flooded the streets of Germany - one after another, they announce that Reichskanzler Kurt von Schleicher resigned from all offices today. For the average person, the news came as quite a surprise - though Schleicher was challenged by Bavaria days prior, with an unprecedented attack on constitutional sovereignty, the general belief was that Schleicher would fight this. After all, he was seen as a strongman who will stop at nothing to bring forth his vision for Germany... Some even claimed that Schleicher received an unexpected health scare that made him reconsider his stay in the office.\n\nThough Schleicher's time as Reichskanzler was relatively short, his impact on the country was enormous. The power of the Reichstag in choosing and controlling heads of government, increasingly growing over the past few decades, has been severely weakened, and more and more power is held in a clique of generals, bureaucrats, party officials and business leaders who composed Schleicher's circle during his cabinet. Following their advice, Wilhelm II, as German Emperor, appointed Carl Friedrich Goerdeler as the next Reichskanzler.\n\nA conservative civil servant and Mayor of Königsberg, Goerdeler was one of Schleicher's close allies, and his first task will be to clean up his former superior's mess."
 gerbav.6.a: "Let us hope the new government can resolve this..."

 gerbav.7.t: "The Goerdeler Compromise"
 gerbav.7.d: "Reichskanzler Goerdeler immediately called the Bavarian government forth for talks - and, though the negotiations took twists and turns, he proved to be more acceptable for the Bavarians than his predecessor. Goerdeler was willing to sacrifice much more of his programme than Schleicher was in the name of national unity, enough to appease the states.\n\nProblematic decrees passed with the Enabling Act will have to be reverted, and the Bundesrat will be able to cancel decrees passed with the Enabling Act hereforth. The government also officially declared that the Enabling Act will not be used to infringe on the powers and rights of the States, as defined in the Constitution, and will also abandon its most ambitious goals of national centralisation.\n\nThough this is a defeat for Schleicher's circle, the rest of the nation drew an easier breath. Anything is better than a breakdown of constitutional norms and prolonged conflict between the government and the states."
 gerbav.7.a: "Centralisation will forever remain incomplete."

 gerbav.8.t: "Bavaria-Berlin Talks"
 gerbav.8.d: "The Bavarian government accepted the offer of talks and joined representatives from our cabinet in a meeting in Berlin. However, little progress is expected from them, as Bavaria set forth red lines regarding our centralisation plans that we simply will not be able to fulfil, not without sabotaging our programme. If we stall for time, however, we might be just a little more prepared for what's to come next."
 gerbav.8.a: "Schleicher successfully stalls for time."
 gerbav.8.b: "The negotiations break down."

 gerbav.9.t: "Negotiations Cease"
 gerbav.9.d: "As expected, the Bavarian representatives returned to Munich without any agreement, nor any strong promises from our cabinet. Disappointed, yet not surprised by the outcome, they have chosen to continue to fight, and bring the topic to the other states in order to convince them to join the nullification.\n\nWhat they did not know, however, was that the failed negotiations is exactly the political capital we need to activate our true plan to pacify the Bavarians..."
 gerbav.9.a: "This shall be solved through force."

 gerbav.10.t: "Bavaria Curtailment Project"
 gerbav.10.d: "A second meeting of the Schleicher cabinet has been held, this one with a much more unanimous mood than the last. Bavaria has burned all of its bridges, and so, in the name of a reformed, centralised German Empire, it will need to be punished.\n\nTwo projects have thus been lodged forth by the government - the first, a Reichstag Act with which the Enabling Act would be declared a piece of constitutional law, and thus above the laws of the states, making it illegal for any state to violate its terms or nullify its effects; second, a Reichsexekution on Bavaria. An intervention in Bavaria, if approved by the Bundesrat, will remove the rebellious government of Heinrich Held and appoint a temporary executive authority from Berlin which will enforce the state's proper dues towards the central government. Ideally, this execution will be achieved without a rebellion of the Bavarian Army, and thus a civil war in German territory. That would be unthinkable.\n\nHowever, a majority in the Bundesrat is required for this project to go ahead. We can count on votes from Prussia, and Bavaria will always hold Bavaria's own votes. Delegations to negotiate with the other states have already been sent forth - and they will judge whether they want Schleicher's New State or a return to the decentralised past."
 gerbav.10.a: "Let us hope the other states are more reasonable..."

 gerbav.11.t: "The Grand Duchy of Baden"
 gerbav.11.d: "The Grand Duchy of Baden, located in the German southwest, is in many ways quite similar to neighbouring Württemberg, and shares its democratic and progressive traditions to an even more far-reaching degree. The old Alemannic frontier was once the burning torchlight of the 1848 Revolution in Germany, after all. While the liberals are not the strongest force in the Landtag anymore nowadays, slowly sidelined by both Zentrum and the SPD during the 1910s, they remain an important pillar of the currently ruling black-red-gold coalition under Minister President Josef Schmitt. In fact, the notions that helped foster unification attempts within the German liberal movement and eventually culminated in the foundation of the LVP in the late 20s are in large part rooted in Baden.\n\nHumorously called \"Parlamentarisches Musterländle\" (\"Parliamentary Model State\") due to exemplary constructive cooperation between all the local parties and a healthy political climate, Baden stands at the foremost front within the Empire when it comes to federalist interests. This is, however, not necessarily due to particularist beliefs, but because of growing scepticism towards the ever-growing influence of the Prussian behemoth and the centralist ambitions of Reichskanzler Schleicher. Convincing Karlsruhe of the well-meaning intent of our aims will be a tough task."

 gerbav.11.b: "They are a lost cause. Focus efforts elsewhere."

 gerbav.12.t: "The Kingdom of Württemberg"
 gerbav.12.d: "Unlike in neighbouring Bavaria, particularist tendencies have never played a too prominent role in Württemberg, and yet, it is among the most convinced defenders of the federalist order. For decades, the Swabian kingdom has been the bulwark of progressive thought and liberalism within the Empire: no Kulturkampf, early electoral reform, tendencies towards parliamentarisation long before most other states, and able and popular monarchs with enormous wisdom and political expertise. Many iconic progressive-minded statesmen have their origin in the deep south, such as Matthias Erzberger and Friedrich von Payer.\n\nAll these factors certainly make Württemberg one of the prime allies of the Bavarian cause. However, Minister President Eugen Bolz, a respected jurist who presides over a moderate coalition of the Zentrum Party, the LVP and the Farmers' League, will not shy away from restraint in case the Bavarian complaints appear too outrageous or unjustified - after all, as even the Deutschlandlied says, freedom always comes in connection with justice. Württemberg's final stance on the matter therefore remains to be seen."

 gerbav.13.t: "The Grand Duchy of Alsace-Lorraine"
 gerbav.13.d: "The Weltkrieg and its consequences had far-reaching consequences on Alsace-Lorraine's internal political development. The formerly badly integrated ugly duckling at the Empire's Western frontier was elevated to a true constituent state under a Bavarian Grand Duke in 1920, and ever since, the region's political conditions have quite ironically slowly but steadily aligned themselves with the predominant developments in Bavaria proper. Like in Munich, a particularist, vastly autonomous branch of the Zentrum has become deeply entrenched in Straßburg, the People's Party of Alsace-Lorraine (ELVP).\n\nCatholic-Conservative, extremely regionalist, and anti-socialist, the ELVP has absorbed almost all the remaining pro-autonomy groups in Alsace & Lorraine over time and won the masses' favour with populist phrases a la \"Alsace-Lorraine to the Alsatians & Lorrainers!\". After decades of marginalisation, the ex-Reichsland is now finally riding on a wave of unbridled particularist pride, and with the emergence of the Commune next door, Francophile tendencies have almost been entirely sidelined due to Paris' controversial stance on religion: the ELVP's political hegemony is almost uncontested. Alsace-Lorraine's close ties to Munich of course make them a prime ally of the federalist cause. It will be hard to convince them to support our efforts against their most important strategic partner within the Empire, but Straßburg might be more easily swayed with populist promises of anti-syndicalist, democratic-federalist safeguards than we think."

 gerbav.14.t: "The Grand Duchy of Luxembourg"
 gerbav.14.d: "The Grand Duchy of Luxemburg is the youngest constituent state of the Empire, only officially joining its ranks in 1919 via a treaty of accession in return for keeping sovereignty over its own affairs and being granted a broad array of special privileges. While limited liberalisation arrived in the wake of the post-war March Reforms, Luxemburg's regional politics remain dominated by an elite of local dignitaries and Catholic conservatives, in a more or less obvious pact with the rather unpopular, right-wing Catholic Grand Duchess Maria-Adelheid. The Luxembourgian Party of the Right, an autonomous branch of the Zentrum similar to the Bavarian People's Party, is infamous for being one of the hotbeds of the Catholic corporatist movement in the Empire, and sympathy for openly radical right-wing ideas reaches into the government's highest cadres.\n\nThe dominance of the political right paired with the close proximity to the Communards and the increasing radicalism of the local working class in the plethora of coalfields and steelworks has reinforced the Grand Duchy's role as a stalwart bulwark of anti-syndicalism. Our own interests are therefore congruent with theirs, which could be beneficial to persuade Luxemburg to support our domestic political agenda for the greater good of the national interest. Then again, as a prime ally of Bavaria in the federalist axis, Luxemburg might be reluctant to openly abandon their associates in Munich, especially as the targeted government is also dominated by right-wing Catholics."

 gerbav.15.t: "The Grand Duchy of Hesse"
 gerbav.15.d: "In conservative circles in Berlin, the reputation of the Grand Duchy of Hesse-Darmstadt hasn't been all too great in the recent past. Under the leadership of the recently deceased Grand Duke Ernst Ludwig, Hesse transformed into one of the Empire's foremost cultural centres during the last 50 years. A very progressive political and cultural climate fostered both the emergence of art styles that were not inherently in accordance with Wilhelm II's extremely traditionalist stance on the fine arts, and the fruitful cooperation between most local political parties, very much to the delight of Ernst Ludwig, who was long denounced in the capital as \"the Red Grand Duke\".\n\nSince late 1937, the state's liberal traditions are carried on by the new Grand Duke Georg Donatus, but even more importantly by the progressive black-red-gold coalition which has governed the country uninterrupted since the end of the war. The social democratic State Minister Bernhard Adelung is known for his relatively sceptical opinion about us, and it is quite likely that Hesse will flock to Bavaria's side in the Bundesrat in an effort to defend the sovereignty of the states south of the Main - therefore, our chances to sway Darmstadt are not the most stellar."

 gerbav.16.t: "The Central Princes"
 gerbav.16.d: "Surrounded by Prussia on almost all sides, three minor and barely significant enclaves still withstand the ever-growing influence of Berlin, calmly following their very own political destiny over the course of the last few years: The Duchy of Anhalt, the Principality of Schaumburg-Lippe, and the Principality of Lippe. Unlike the Prussian behemoth, these three states have long pursued a moderately liberal course of reform, manifested in moderate big-tent coalitions under a non-partisan local dignitary or old-guard liberal state minister, often supported by a mostly ambivalent monarch with not much interest in political meddling.\n\nWhile the economic crisis has resulted in a temporary return of non-partisan experts' cabinets in Bückeburg, Schaumburg, and Dessau, it can not be expected that the three dwarf states are in any way of supportive of our careful efforts to dismantle democracy and initiate violence measures against a democratic constituent state. Population-wise, all three states barely have 700,000 inhabitants in total, but their united power in the Bundesrat should not be underestimated - after all, their three votes make them as strong as other states with more than double the population and economic potential. Naturally, their geographic position makes them vulnerable, however; with the right measures, we might still be able to threaten them indirectly to vote in favour of our agenda."

 gerbav.17.t: "The Hanseatic Cities"
 gerbav.17.d: "The three Hanseatic Cities of Hamburg, Bremen and Lübeck in the far north are insofar special as they constitute the only republican member states within the otherwise monarchical-dominated Empire, and yet, they can ironically be considered even more traditionalist than their princely neighbours. An extremely elitist upper class of wealthy Grand Burgher dynasties has controlled the cities for centuries, and only very recently political parties have begun to penetrate these power structures of old and became a force to be reckoned with in the cities' citizen councils and senates. All three states maintained governments with SPD participation during the past two decades, and Lübeck currently even has a social democratic First Mayor. However, partisan predominance in government affairs hasn't gotten the ancient pearls of the Hansa to lose their distinct regional identity, and as it stands, they remain one of the firmest defenders of the federalist order. The sovereignty of all the constituent states needs to remain unquestioned and uncontested, and thus, Hamburg, Bremen and Lübeck's stance on the Reichsexekution in Bavaria can be described as highly sceptical."

 gerbav.18.t: "The Grand Duchies of Mecklenburg and Oldenburg"
 gerbav.18.d: "The Grand Duchies of Oldenburg, Mecklenburg-Schwerin and Mecklenburg-Strelitz are the quintessential bulwarks of agrarian interests in the Empire, their economy is built upon giant rye fields and livestock pastures, making rural organisations like the Landbund extremely powerful. The two Mecklenburgs have always been quite reactionary, being in large part dominated by junker dynasties similar to neighbouring East Elbia and having remained absolute monarchies up until 1920, but the circumstances in Oldenburg are more complex. For decades, it was a liberal state with a progressive electoral law and a countryside dominated not by junkers, but by thousands of smallholding farmers. The political climate only began to change during the 20s, when the North German Agrarian Crisis caused the emergence of far-right radicalism. Nowadays, Oldenburg is among the first constituent states in Germany with DVLP participation in the government, while the Mecklenburgs find themselves under uncontested control of the DkP.\n\nWhile all three states pursue a right-wing agenda and have generally authoritarian aims in mind, they are still slightly reluctant to work with us - Schleicher appears to them as an unpredictable blend of old and new, and they are unsure whether his chancellorship will safeguard the interests of the agrarian countryside as much as they hope. On the other hand, the farming strongholds of the north have not much to gain from cooperation with Munich, it is very likely that they will vote in our favour and approve the Reichsexekution."

 gerbav.19.t: "The Kingdom of Saxony"
 gerbav.19.d: "The Kingdom of Saxony has been known by many nicknames throughout its eventful history, among them \"Model State of Conservatism\", \"Testing Ground of Reaction\" or \"the Red Kingdom\". These terms hail from a time when Saxon politics were under the firm control of an uncontested conservative-national liberal front against the emerging social democrats, who, in spite of extremely repressive electoral restrictions, had managed to achieve almost 50% of the votes, but had zero presence in the Landtag in practice. Only in 1909, these restrictions were mostly lifted after wide-spread strikes, and the SPD's seats in the Landtag rose from 1 to 25 in the subsequent elections. Ever since, especially since 1920, social democratic dominance over the kingdom has remained unimpeded.\n\nHowever, the Saxon SPD is quite different from the party's branches in other parts of the Empire. They are in favour of cooperation with even the more rightist bourgeoisie parties, well aware that a positive attitude towards the state in the tradition of Ferdinand Lasalle benefits the party more than remaining eternally in opposition. Patriotism and Saxon particularism also play a major role in their programme, gaining them the trust of the late King Friedrich August III and his young successor Georg II. This of course could make them powerful allies of the Bavarians. However, the Red General also embodies many things that the Saxons have propagated for years, most prominently a healthy combination of socialism and patriotism. Thus, the SPD-LVP-WP government in Dresden could play a very important role in fulfilling our political aims."

 gerbav.20.t: "The Duchy of Brunswick"
 gerbav.20.d: "While peace and order have ostensibly long returned to the Duchy of Brunswick, memories of the socialist uprising attempt in late 1936, the third revolution on Brunswickian soil in 106 years, are still quite vivid in the minds of the local population and governance. The old unpopular liberal-conservative cabinet of State Minister Werner Küchenthal was not reinstated in the aftermath of the Reichsexekution, instead being replaced by a temporary non-partisan emergency government under a Berlin-appointed, but local State Commissar. However, the foundations of the new cabinet have grown increasingly shaky over the course of the last few months due to a lack of broad parliamentary support, and with resistance both on the left and right steadily growing, it is only a question of time before it falls.\n\nFor now, however, the administration remains in charge, and with full control over the Duchy's two votes in the Bundesrat, it will certainly decide in favour of their benefactors in Berlin on the matter of the planned Reichsexekution in Bavaria. Only extremely unlikely odds would probably be able to change that - but who knows, maybe the scars of 1936 are still deeper than they might appear, causing the Brunswickers to make an erratic and unexpected decision, thereby thwarting our plans when we expect it the least."

 gerbav.21.t: "The Thuringian Circle"
 gerbav.21.d: "The final region whose votes are in question, Thuringia, is truly one of absolute contrasts. Amidst forested hills and idyllic medieval towns, highly specialised industry meets extensive farmland, cosmopolitan high culture meets narrow-minded peasant life, and the political left meets the political right. The extreme fragmentation into 8 small principalities plus a large Prussian part in the north has long held the region back, but unification, demanded by progressive radicals for decades, remains incompatible with the German constitution. Ironically, the fragmentation has at least one enormous advantage: together, all the Thuringian states with less than 2 million inhabitants have more votes in the than powerful Bavaria with almost 7 million inhabitants, making them precious allies to achieve a majority.\n\nCurrently, four of the Thuringian states find themselves under a rightist government, mostly with Landbund, DkP, NLP and WP participation. Since very recently, the DVLP is also on the rise - in Saxe-Coburg & Gotha, which was a hotbed of the SPD a few decades ago, they are already firmly established, in part due to the indirect support of the reactionary Duke Carl Eduard, and they continue to grow in popularity in the other states. Historically, most of Thuringia has always proven to be a stalwart ally on which we could count when we needed a majority, so our hopes are high that our interests align with those of the governments in Gotha, Weimar, Altenburg and Greiz."

 gerbav.22.d: "While Gotha, Weimar, Altenburg and Greiz are led by the right, the other four Thuringian states are led by left-wing governments. The SPD dominates those states with a strong industrial and mining sector and lacking agricultural potential - without a strong Landbund presence to hamper their popularity, the social democrats govern almost uncontested in these regions. Reuß-Gera, Saxe-Meiningen and the two Schwarzburgs have been ruled practically continuously by SPD-led governments since the post-Weltkrieg reforms, and the local monarchs have remained mostly apathetic to this extreme political caesura, devoting their time to charity and the fine arts instead of trying to meddle in local politics. Of course, the social democratic governments in Gera, Meiningen, Rudolstadt and Sondershausen might be harder to sway to our side than their conservative neighbours. However, considering they have never been too keen about federalism, it's quite likely that they would prefer the \"Red General\" over the condescending and conservative Bavarians to their south."

 gerbav.23.t: "The Fall of Schleicher"
 gerbav.23.d: "The Bundesrat has gathered, and its decision is final — Schleicher's gambit did not pay off. Citing several instances of Schleicher's government's violation of the rights of the states enshrined in the Constitution, the representatives of the states declared that \"Bavaria's concerns have to be taken into consideration\" and dismissing the government's request for a Reichsexekution, which was a careful acceptance of the Bavarian nullification of the Enabling Act. This has dealt a final blow to the Red General's government - faced with uproar from the states, the Reichstag, and even from his own allies, he offered his resignation from all offices.\n\nThough Schleicher's time as Reichskanzler was relatively short, his impact on the country was enormous. The power of the Reichstag in choosing and controlling heads of government, increasingly growing over the past few decades, has been severely weakened, and more and more power is held in a clique of generals, bureaucrats, party officials and business leaders who composed Schleicher's circle during his cabinet. Following their advice, Wilhelm II, as German Emperor, appointed Carl Friedrich Goerdeler as the next Reichskanzler.\n\nA conservative civil servant and Mayor of Königsberg, Goerdeler was one of Schleicher's close allies, and his first task will be to clean up his former superior's mess."

 gerbav.24.t: "Bavaria's Defeat"
 gerbav.24.d: "The Bundesrat has gathered, and its decision is final - the choice of the Bavarian government to nullify the decrees made under the Enabling Act was declared a violation to the duties of the federal states of the Empire. The representatives granted the Schleicher government the green light to enact a Reichsexekution on Bavaria, although, unlike in Brunswick, there was no violence involved. Once units of the Imperial German Army were mobilised and dispatched to Munich, King Rupprecht of Bavaria took the initiative and joined the side of the interventionists - he did not want a civil war between Germany and Bavaria to take place and chose to cooperate with Schleicher's regime even if it meant dismissing the government of Heinrich Held.\n\nA State Commissar, Ludwig Siebert, has been appointed in Munich in Held's stead, and he immediately formed a nationalist right-wing cabinet loyal to the government in Berlin. As Bavaria had long since been the most powerful defender of the rights of the states in the German Empire, the destruction of its will to resist Schleicher's ambitions of a New State means that no more challenges will come from the states."

 gerbav.25.t: "Takeover of Prussia"
 gerbav.25.d: "The defeat of Bavaria allowed Schleicher to turn his eyes to Prussia - which, up until now, was still led by a cabinet separate from the federal one, occasionally clashing with the Reichskanzler's programmes and reforms. The rift between the federal government and the Prussian government, which controlled seventy percent of the population, territory and industry, has long since been one of the weaknesses of the German state which Schleicher despised - and, even before he became Reichskanzler, he stood in favour of proposals to dissolve or divide Prussia, turning it into a Reichsland which would be under full control from Berlin.\n\nCiting persistent economic decline and political unrest requiring emergency measures from above, Schleicher, using the Crown Prince as an intermediary, successfully convinced Wilhelm II to remove the incumbent Minister-President and appoint the Reichskanzler in the position, reuniting them in the same way they had been prior to 1923. A snap election for the lower house of the Prussian legislature was called, which soon yielded a result favourable to the Red General - opposition parties such as the SPD and DVLP were weakened and a far greater number of deputies elected were those who endorsed the Reichskanzler's course, whether from the DkP, Zentrum, LVP or the right wing of the SPD. This has given Schleicher the political capital necessary to consider unprecedented centralisation of the Empire..."

 gerbav.26.t: "Stegerwald Resigns as State Secretary for Labour"
 gerbav.26.d: "To the surprise of the public, Adam Stegerwald, long-time backer of Reichskanzler Schleicher and one of the key figures in his complex cross-connection network, has officially announced his resignation from the State Secretariat for Labour in the aftermath of the Reichsexekution against Bavaria. The attentive political observer is naturally fully aware of the true reasons. As the leader of a highly diverse party, Stegerwald cannot afford to remain part of a government that took militant action against the most powerful Zentrum-led constituent state. The pressure from the federal states was ultimately too much even for a self-confident chairman like Stegerwald - the resignation therefore came primarily to preserve the unity of his party in a moment of crisis.\n\nThat is not the sole reason, however. Despite his initial naivety, the titan of the Christian trade union movement seems to have finally realised that he was just a small chess piece in Schleicher's extensive network of contacts, one cog in a thousand. It is obvious that Schleicher's vision does not end with the co-optation of established trade union leaders - no, his ultimate goal is the complete infiltration and subjugation of the entire trade union scene, including its old leaders, with the help of new organisations that orbit entirely around the chancellor. Knowing full well that Schleicher's interests are not congruent with his own, Stegerwald has now pulled the ripcord - what will be the consequences?"

 gerbav.27.t: "Crackdown on the BVP's Leadership"
 gerbav.27.d: "The attempted breach of the constitution by leading Bavarian People's Party (BVP) cadres in Munich has proven to everyone what the old establishment figures are capable of in order to preserve their own selfish interests. It is crystal-clear that not only the Bavarian state government was behind this outrageous declaration, but an anti-Berlin intrigue by federalists and particularists that reaches up to the highest echelons of the Zentrum Party, of which the BVP has only been one of several deeply entrenched autonomous regional branches for years. Now, the opportunity to strike has come.\n\nUnder the supervision of the newly-instated Bavarian puppet government, a crackdown on suspicious high-ranking BVP figures has been instituted, with Stadelheim Prison now being filled to the brim with famous faces of the ultimately unsuccessful federalist front. Among them is none other than Zentrum chairman Fritz Schäffer himself, ever since the 1936 party conference the quintessential link between the party's Berlin leadership and the autonomous regional branches, first and foremost of course in Bavaria.\n\nWithout Schäffer, the party has become effectively decapitated. We will make sure that Schäffer and his henchmen in protective custody show the necessary humility, and that they will never set foot in the political arena again after their release. The Schäffer Case will be a lesson to his particularistic co-conspirators in Luxembourg and Alsace-Lorraine in particular. If we can track you down and get you in Munich, the beating heart of Bavarian particularism, then we will find you anywhere."

 gerbav.28.t: "Stegerwald Expelled from Zentrum"
 gerbav.28.d: "Crisis is brewing in the Zentrum Party. The Reichsexekution against Bavaria has created an unbridgeable rift between Schleicher's government and the bulwark of Catholic interests, and caught between the fronts is none other than one of Schleicher's closest associates and most high-ranking Christian trade unionists, State Secretary for Labour Adam Stegerwald, appointed by Schleicher in the summer of 1936. By not voluntarily withdrawing from the ruling cabinet as a reaction to the intervention, Stegerwald, according to his party's leadership, has silently condoned the actions of his superior, which makes him a disgrace to the Catholic community. Faced with the accusation of disloyalty to his party comrades, expulsion proceedings have been initiated against Stegerwald.\n\nAlthough media outrage is huge, the exclusion should not have many negative consequences for the towering union titan. Despite years of attempts to finally assert his claim to leadership within the Zentrum, Stegerwald always emerged as the eternal runner-up; at the latest since his renewed defeat at the 1936 party conference, relations between the Christian trade unions and the rest of the party have grown colder and colder. Now entirely detached from party politics, Stegerwald is finally in a position to forge even closer ties between his trade unions and the Schleicher apparatus; his future now lies entirely in the chancellor's orbit."

 gerswr.1.t: "The Conservative Revolution"
 gerswr.1.d: "Decades ago, \"Sammlungspolitik\", a strategy aimed at uniting like-minded factions to form a robust opposition against the rising left in support of imperialist aims, played a crucial role in maintaining the interests of the Imperial state. But times have changed. Today, the state faces threats not only from external ideologies but also from its own shortcomings. The Kaiser's transformation into a weak puppet of internationalist parliamentarians has made him and the government targets of the very policy they once championed: Sammlungspolitik against the State.\n\nThanks to the wise guidance of DVLP chairman Ulrich von Hassell and DkP chairman Kuno von Westarp, what previous conservative statesmen failed to achieve due to petty rivalries and a lack of determination has now finally come to fruition: Long-standing disputes have been resolved, forging a bridge that unites the conservative movements of the past with those of the present. The era of aimless moderatism and Schleicher's pseudo-leftist experiments is over. A truly national front has brought down the rotten power structures of old, hopefully once and for all - the Conservative Revolution is imminent.\n\n While the black-white-red front encompasses a broad spectrum of right-wing factions ranging from middle-class populists and moderate conservatives to far-right industrialists and Völkische, the national revolutionary German Fatherland Party and the predominantly agrarian-aristocratic German Conservative Party maintain the upper hand. Selected key government ministries will be split between them, with the titular leadership of the coalition, the Imperial Chancellorship, going to a non-partisan compromise candidate, long-time conservative Prussian civil service official Ewald von Kleist-Schmenzin. As one of Schleicher's most vocal critics, Kleist has garnered respect across the political right. His conciliatory leadership is anticipated to eliminate factionalism within the conservative front."

 gerswr.2.t: "Hugenberg Demands the Economic Office"
 gerswr.2.d: "As expected, the DkP will keep a firm grip on agricultural matters, with long-time State Secretary Martin Schiele retaining his position. Meanwhile, the DVLP has made its move on the Economic Office, with a quite controversial nomination: None other than infamous media mogul Alfred Hugenberg, the party's 2nd Chairman.\n\nIn recent years, Hugenberg has sparked controversy on numerous occasions. As an ultra-reactionary, he represents a vestige of a bygone era within a party that has steadily moderated since 1929 to broaden its appeal to a wider electorate. Before that, Hugenberg was regarded as the party's foremost economic authority under the ultra-right leadership of Wolfgang Kapp and Georg Schiele, certain of leading the DVLP himself one day. The 1929 party chairman elections, however, swept a younger generation of national revolutionaries led by Ulrich von Hassell into power, with a less ideologically rigid, more populist approach to parliamentary politics. The appointment of Hugenberg as 2nd Chairman was merely a symbolic act, a concession to the old party elites - ever since, he has played second fiddle.\n\nHowever, nonetheless, Hugenberg's enormous wealth has rendered him indispensable within the party leadership. Also, his political resume is remarkable; few can boast of having been involved in the foundation of two highly influential German far-right organisations: the extra-parliamentary Pan-German League in 1890, and the Fatherland Party in 1917. Not to mention, of course, his enormous economic influence. Hugenberg's fingers are everywhere like an all-encompassing octopus - he will not take it lightly if his demands are ignored, no matter how limited his power base within the DVLP is.\n\nHis candidacy might be viewed as an effort to alleviate internal tensions between national revolutionaries and reactionaries, and to rein in Hugenberg through his governmental role. However, Hugenberg's divisive reputation and strained relations with the Kaiser add complexity to this decision - opting for a moderate compromise candidate could be a wiser choice."

 gerswr.3.t: "Postenschacher"
 gerswr.3.d: "Ironically, now that Schleicher has fallen, the very same \"patriots\" that once criticised the democratic parties for prioritising party interests above people's interests are now vying for vacant state secretary positions, eager to advance their own party's agenda. The new candidate for the Foreign Office, DVLP chairman Ulrich von Hassell, was quickly agreed on. Though Hassell is a retired diplomat with experience in Italy, Spain, and the Commune of France, his nomination signals a historic shift as he brings party politics to a traditionally non-partisan role. Hassell's preference for the Russians over the Syndicalist bloc hints at potential changes in German foreign policy - the future will show if such a policy is compatible with Germany's global interests.\n\nMeanwhile, the more moderate DkP has secured the State Secretariat for the Interior, a position that requires mediation skills. Party Chairman Kuno von Westarp remains out of the question due to his affiliation with previous governments and will focus on his well-established power base in the chairmanship. Instead, the choice fell on the lesser-known Wilhelm von Gayl. With a background in the Bundesrat, governance experience in the former Eastern European wartime occupation zones, and connections within agrarian and corporatist circles, he brings a wealth of expertise. Gayl might be an inconspicuous man, but his prowess and low ambition ensure that he won't become a rival to party leader Westarp while delivering good results for the DkP.\n\nThe remaining state secretary positions are still up for grabs, but it's probable that the DkP will retain control of the agricultural secretariat, while the DVLP may pursue dominance in economic affairs."

While the Catholics will not directly join the coalition in order to preserve party unity, their party's stance towards the new government will decide how easy it will be for the rightists to efficiently govern the country in the future. A more left-leaning Zentrum could severely hamper their ambitious visions, while a more right-leaning Zentrum is much more likely to tolerate them, thereby handing them out a carte blanche as long as Catholic and federal interests aren't harmed.\n\nQuite fortunately for Kleist, Hassell, Westarp and co, the second case applies. The newly-elected conservative-federalist leadership of the Zentrum Party around Schäffer welcomes the appointment of the Kleist government, despite a certain degree of party-internal opposition. Schäffer himself has lauded the nationalists' united efforts against the Schleicher administration to prevent pseudo-revolutionary experiments and military-imposed centralisation attempts, and expressed his hope that the new government will take a tougher line than previous governments in defending both Germany's domestic order and the European order in the name of international peacekeeping."

The newly-elected progressive leadership of the Zentrum Party around Carl Ulitzka has condemned the appointment of the new far-right coalition, and, despite a certain degree of party-internal opposition, has decided to adopt a resolute attitude of no tolerance towards it. With a strong and united front ranging from the far-left to the Catholics forming in the Reichstag, the future of the Kleist government remains uncertain. A rocky road lies ahead."

Within the Christian Trade Unions, fears have become loud that certain reactionary circles within the DkP and DVLP could work towards a reversal of many hard-won labour laws. Stegerwald himself tolerates our government for now, but will keep a close eye on our future labour policy programme - the wrong decisions could cost us the silent support of one of the Empire's most powerful mass organisations."

Staffed by many right-wingers and moderates who will hopefully outbalance the harmful influence of Stegerwald's Christian trade unions within the board, the party chairs should hopefully keep their mouths shut as long as we keep the basic democratic-federal framework intact, and they might even be swayed with certain corporatist concessions, ideas which have long gained appeal even in the moderate establishment."

 gerswr.7.d1: "Another day, another sensational rumour about the Royal Family's \"dark secrets\" is making the rounds. This time, Crown Prince Wilhelm and one of his many alleged love affairs stand in the centre of attention again. Censorship on articles that openly \"defame\" the Hohenzollerns and threaten their reputation is very resolute, and most mainstream newspapers try to refrain from publishing such controversial articles in the first place out of respect. With the quick emergence of the less professional tabloid press in recent years, however, some unpleasant information always manages to slip through to the public. Considering the Crown Prince's relatively low popularity, barely anyone can really be expected to be shocked about the new headlines, though. Only in the heart of the Empire, in the Reich Chancellory, did the future monarch's behaviour cause more than great displeasure.\n\nReichskanzler Kleist's views on the role of the monarchy and the nobility in general are peculiar, to say the least. Deeply fascinated with the \"Prussian spirit\" and the divine right of kings, he is convinced that a state is kept alive by the forces that once founded it. However, with the god-given role that the king plays within society, certain important duties come. The true conservative selflessly serves his people just as God intended him to do, Kleist believes, and doesn't put personal interests above everything else. Such notions are responsible for the Reichskanzler's quite idealistic perception of the aristocracy, the \"second estate\" - in order to be respected by the common man subordinated to them, they need to be heroic, determined, loyal to their own convictions, just and full of faith - all of which are traits that the Crown Prince is lacking.\n\nWhile Wilhelm's extramarital adventures might not be that important to the general public and won't inherently harm the royals per se, they could hamper the new government's ambitious reform plans in the future on a more subtle level. After all, the behavior of a decadent, egoistic sovereign is likely to rub off on the population that is guided by the former, causing a loss of all morals and traditions, eventually losing the proud German nation for the conservative cause forever! After a secret emergency session with high-ranking government members, Kleist is determined - certain actions have to be taken."

 gerswr.8.t: "A Change of Course in the Countryside"
 gerswr.8.d: "The new government has not been in power for long, and already has to face its first major challenge - the creeping agrarian crisis in the countryside. Over the past twelve months, even during the brief Schleicher intermezzo, State Secretary of Agriculture Martin Schiele, a prominent representative of Westarp's moderate DkP leadership faction and well-connected man within the Landbund, has remained in office - despite enormous criticism. He staunchly championed a protectionist tariff policy, coupled with stringent import quotas, firmly believing that these measures would usher Germany towards salvation, ultimately striving for complete autarky in the agricultural sector.\n\nThis plan, however, has now failed, in a large part because of the enormous resistance of Mitteleuropa proponents, export industry lobbyists, and trade union leaders who fear that Schiele's policies might aggravate the economic dilemma by destroying wage levels and hampering profitable trade with other countries. German agriculture's most profiled advocate is faced with the ruins of his own collapsed house of cards - his efforts have only postponed the inevitable. Now, one thing is clear - with the situation still deteriorating and the rural population becoming more and more radical, Schiele and his methods need to be replaced. Germany's new agrarian policy needs to start with a clean slate."
 gerswr.8.a: "But who could fulfil that role?"

 gerswr.9.t: "Bauernschach"
 gerswr.9.d: "The dismissal of Schiele means the loss of a key ministry for the DkP, and thus potentially a massive loss of power in favour of the DVLP. Therefore, it is clear: in order to keep the balance within the coalition, his successor must also hail from Westarp's party. However, nowadays, \"conservative\" doesn't mean conservative anymore. Even the old DkP has evolved into a diverse party with many ideologically divergent wings, and depending on which of those will be able to provide Schiele's replacement, things might not end as well for the old moderate leadership around Westarp.\n\nEspecially in connection with the pressing agricultural question, two powerful factions have emerged in the last few years, between which Schiele recently managed to mediate more or less successfully. On the one hand, there are the classic Prussian aristocratic landowners, the Junkers. Reactionary, elitist and narrow-minded by nature, they are mostly keen on two things - preserving the societal status quo and protecting their traditional property. A popular younger politician from their ranks is the Rhenish agricultural functionary Hermann von Lüninck, who is well-connected both within the local Landbund and in Catholic farmer organisations. Willing to balance the interests of landowners, farmers and the industry, he is seen as a compromise candidate with good relations to the party leadership.\n\nThe second major group are the non-aristocratic small and mid-sized farmers, many of whom hail from Central and Southwestern Germany. Vastly outnumbering the Junkers, they are an up and coming political force to be reckoned with. The economic crisis has reopened old wounds between the two groups, mistrust is at an all-time high, and appeasing the farmers with a government office and involving them in the political process could calm tensions down. However, many of these farmers adhere to quite radical ideas with a völkisch-corporatist touch quite similar to the DVLP's vision; thus, choosing the non-aristocratic candidate Hans Schlange-Schöningen, a renowned agricultural expert from Pomerania, could benefit Hassell more than Westarp in the long-term."

 gerswr.9.b: "Choose Schlange, the voice of the common man."

 gerswr.10.t: "Hermann von Lüninck"
 gerswr.10.d: "Hermann von Lüninck has been one of the rising stars of the German agricultural lobby for several years, and not without reason. Catholic, aristocratic, populist and quite right-leaning, he is walking in the footsteps of his late mentor, long-time chairman of the Rhenish Peasant Association Clemens von Loë-Bergerhausen, whom Lüninck succeeded after the former's death in 1930. Lüninck represents a new type of landowner, different from the East Elbian elites of old - his religious background and Western German origin make it harder for his critics to defame him as a typical \"Krautjunker\".\n\nThis, however, doesn't mean that the ambitious overachiever could be described as more moderate than his East Elbian brethren. Deeply anti-democratic and religious, he despises Zentrum for supposedly betraying their own values by contributing to the parliamentary reforms of 1920, and thus gravitates towards the conservative parties. Lüninck's vision in the recent past consists of two important pillars: enforce closer cooperation between the Protestant Reichslandbund (RLB) and the Catholic Association of the German Farmers Associations (VdB) of which the Rhenish Peasant Association is a part of, and work towards a strong rightist alliance, against Zentrum if necessary, to rejuvenate conservatism. Said cooperation between RLB and VdB has already started in the Rhineland and Westphalia, but similar efforts on the national level have been blocked by powerful Zentrum-affiliated VdB functionaries.\n\nThough in favour of a strong agrarian front and potentially even unity organisation dominated by the old aristocratic elites, Lüninck also has an open ear for the interests of the West German industry and the plethora of freeholding farmers that dominate the West German agrarian sector.  It is therefore expected that he will approach the crisis with a careful, but firm hand; hopefully without any major controversies."

 gerswr.11.t: "Hans Schlange-Schöningen"
 gerswr.11.d: "Hans Schlange-Schöningen is among the most renowned personalities of the Conservative Party. While technically a Junker of non-aristocratic origin, the long-time leader of the Pomeranian DkP branch has more in common with the small and mid-sized farmers west of the Elbe than with his reactionary, grain-growing brethren in East Elbia. His estate Gut Schöningen near Stettin is regarded as an internationally renowned model business that survived the agricultural and economic crises thanks to clever entrepreneurial management, and Schlange's know-how is undisputed in all political spheres. What's not undisputed, however, are his methods.\n\nSchlange is in favour of an interventionist approach when it comes to solving the agrarian crisis; in his eyes, a true \"agro-political turnabout\" is needed, \"at the end of which there will be a German East that is economically strengthened and nationally consolidated\". Schlange ultimately strives for a complete restructuring of the agricultural economy, especially in East Elbia, via indirect land reform — too heavily indebted Junker estates will not be bailed out by the state, but parceled out among small and mid-sized farmers or re-settled by unemployed factory workers or farmhands. Schlange's pragmatic, efficiency-oriented vision is not only rooted in his background as an experienced agricultural economist, but also has ideological implications. The combination of agrarian revitalisation and Eastern settlement is embraced as a project to \"awaken the coloniser spirit of the Germans and thus lead the people back from the overpopulated cities to productive work on the rural soil which gives food and life\".\n\nSuch almost revolutionary plans are opposed to the ideas of many of his party colleagues, but could really guarantee an improvement to the disastrous situation of German agriculture in the long-term. One thing is clear - Schlange's appointment will provoke tensions."

 gerswr.12.t: "Consolidation of the East"
 gerswr.12.d: "A core concept in Schlange's writings is that of the \"economically strengthened, nationally politically consolidated and demographically balanced German East\". Thanks to our efforts, this vision is starting to become a reality. Various thriving farming settlements have sprung up all over East Elbia on the vast land that was previously in the hands of heavily indebted aristocratic landowners. While their numbers are still insignificant compared to the proportion of Junker estates in the region, it can be considered the first successful step of our far-reaching rural restructuring campaign.\n\nThe idea of \"national consolidation\" goes hand in hand with the intensified Germanisation campaign that has been initiated once again in Posen and West Prussia during the last few months - of course, the agrarian crisis has played excellently in the cards of said campaign, as many estates owned by the Polish nobility are facing the same issues as that of the Junkers. Fully in accordance with applicable law, formerly Polish-owned soil in our Eastern frontier has been acquired by the Prussian Settlement Commission and turned into \"land reform settlements\" for our unemployed.\n\nOne of the most recent examples of these efforts is the settlement of Kobylepole, or Gutenbrunn, on the Southeastern outskirts of Posen. Famous for its brewery, the Kobylepole domain and the surrounding estates of Szczepankowo (Stephansort) and Spławie (Rossteich) had previously been owned by the Polish Mycielski family, until the crisis took its toll. Now, the Mycielskis are left only with their old Italian-style villa on the premises, surrounded by parceled out lots owned by German settlers from the west.\n\nThe case of Kobylepole is just one of many successes of our re-agrarisation agenda in the East. As soon as our plans start to bear fruit, settlements like this will become the revitalising lifeblood of the future political order, much to the benefit of our children and grandchildren, and, as a bulwark against Slavism, a true symbol of our German resilience."

 gerswr.13.d: "Back in the golden days of the Iron Chancellor, when our social structure was much less polarised than it is in these challenging times, an important political alliance of industrialists and landowners, of rural manor and blast furnace, of iron and rye kept our state afloat and secured the interests of the ruling elite. But as time went by, the creeping globalisation and the subsequent undermining of our society by rationalist, materialist and egoist, in short un-German, notions, deeply upset this fragile balance.\n\nWith the post-war and post-parliamentarisation order, ultra-capitalism arrived and put enormous harm to our German soul. A deep rift divided the interests of industry and agriculture, and while the one tried to maximise its profits on the global market, the other struggled to compete with more competitive producers abroad. The times of benevolent and considerate \"solidarity protectionism\" were over. In the end, this rift led us into the agrarian crisis that has been looming since the 20s, and ultimately also into the economic dilemma we are facing now.\n\nBut said crises have been an impetus for change towards betterment. We are in the process of cleansing ourselves from these harmful influences as both our economy and our nation are reformed, maybe even revolutionised, from above and from scratch. Our future trade and agricultural policy will return to its old roots, to the times when there was consensus and not division. The formation of the black, white and red parliamentary front was the first step, the re-established accord between industry and agriculture is the second, now, the third step has to be the revitalisation and rejuvenation of our entire society, so that the sun, more beautifully than ever before, shines over our proud nation again."

 gerswr.14.t: "Accusations of Agrarian Totalism"
 gerswr.14.d: "As of late, agrarian-conservative journals in the Empire have revolved around only one topic: the controversial agricultural policy of State Secretary Hans Schlange-Schöningen. Earlier this week, the Kreuzzeitung, Germany's traditional conservative newspaper, published a several-page commentary on the aspiring agricultural politician, accusing Schlange of using his policies to further the \"disenfranchisement of the East\" and the class division in the countryside, which has lead to almost \"Russian or French conditions\" everywhere. Even harsher criticism was voiced by Count Eberhard von Kalckreuth, the German Landbund's most important leadership figure. He went so far as to defame Schlange as an \"Agrarian Totalist\" and publicly called on the DkP and Chancellor Kleist to distance themselves from their black sheep for the good of the nation. It is a fact that great ambitions always conjure up detractors - but it is also indisputable that as long as the old agrarian Junker establishment remains in opposition to us, our scope of action will be massively limited."
 gerswr.14.a: "What idiocy."

 gerswr.15.t: "The Green Front"
 gerswr.15.d: "After lengthy negotiations, we have fulfilled one of our most important goals, an omnipresent matter in German agrarian circles during the last few decades - the formation of a United Front of the German Peasantry. With Andreas Hermes driven out of the Catholic VdB's chairmanship, which is now staffed with functionaries loyal to our cause, the Catholic Farmers Associations are not tied to the Zentrum anymore and can fully embrace our anti-parliamentary vision, and with Eberhard von Kalckreuth willing to make certain concessions to turn the Protestant Landbund's presidium into a fairer representation of Prussian rural life, be it Junkers, smallholders or farmhands, the balance of power between Landbund and VdB will be more evenly distributed within the new unity organisation.\n\nFor many years there had been rejection of such a unification, especially in Catholic circles, it was said that there were insurmountable divides between Catholic and Protestant farmers, politically, confessionally and socially, that cooperation with the Junkers would discredit the VdB among the Catholic peasantry, and that the Junkers would eventually sideline the Catholics within the organisation. And yet, in the end, the opposite side's arguments prevailed - even more ironically, it was a West German Catholic who was finally able to chalk up this historical achievement.\n\nIn a few days, the agrarian organisations of old will be gone forever. In their place, the Reichsbauernfront (Imperial Farmers' Front) will arise, a nominally independent organisation loyal to the government's agricultural agenda. Even more importantly, it will guarantee that we will not lose control over the German peasantry, something that could be beneficial for our political vision in the future, after the agricultural crisis is resolved. By counterweighing populist and elitist currents within the organisation, it is guaranteed that the moderate centre will come out on top, thereby securing the societal status quo that we want to preserve at all costs - we just killed several birds with just one stone."
 gerswr.15.a: "Together for a rejuvenated rural life!"

 gerswr.16.t: "Question of the Labour Office"
 gerswr.16.d: "Soon after his appointment as Economic Secretary, Alfred Hugenberg reached out to the government, offering Gustav Hartz as a potential Secretary of Labour. Hartz is a member of the DVLP and the German National Union of Commercial Employees, a white collar trade union with considerable influence across the right-wing political spectrum. He is much more famous, or infamous, for \"Errors of German Social Policy\" (Irrwege der deutschen Sozialpolitik), his work in which he called for the abolition of the Bismarckian social insurance system and its replacement with mandatory personal savings.\n\nAccording to Hartz, the welfare state is a fundamentally flawed system which only empowers \"slackers\" and takes advantage of diligent workers and business owners — a mandatory personal savings system, on the other hand, would force society to value wealth more and grow \"capitalist spirit\" among the working class. These views are in accord with Hugenberg himself, a major entrepreneur and a vitriolic opponent of socialism and trade unionism - Hartz is, in fact, a close ally of his.\n\nThe Secretariat of Labour was intended to be delegated to the DVLP in the first place, so there would be no issue with appointing Hartz as Secretary of Labour - however, this would grant Hugenberg further control over economic and social policy of the government, is this what we truly want?"
 gerswr.16.a: "This seems reasonable."
 gerswr.16.b: "We shouldn't give Hugenberg more power than necessary."

 gerswr.17.t: "The Economic Saviour"
 gerswr.17.d: "In the months following Hugenberg's appointment as Secretary of the Economy, his vast press empire has gone into overdrive - newspaper articles flood the nation, lauding the politician's financial and economic acumen. Hugenberg is heralded as the "Economic Saviour," portrayed as the linchpin for Germany's economic resurgence, with his indispensability to the government being emphasised at every turn. Similar rhetoric flies from the entrepreneur's allies in the Reichstag, which has received a handful of new members thanks to this propaganda drive.\n\nTo the national revolutionary leadership of the DVLP, and Hassell in particular, this initiative poses a threat more than a boon. The relentless focus of the Hugenberg press on their owner's persona, with only cursory mentions of his role within the DVLP, raises concerns about his motives; it is hard to ignore the fact that he is building up his personal reputation. Some even float suspicions that the Economic Secretariat is merely his first stepping stone to fully controlling the government's actions with his influence - after all, the State Secretary of the Economy wields substantial power within the cabinet..."
 gerswr.17.a: "I don't trust the papers, anyway."

 gerswr.18.t: "The Urgent Measures"
 gerswr.18.d: "After a few weeks of silence, the Secretariat of the Economy, led by Alfred Hugenberg, published a white paper announcing their priorities in the Kleist government. It emphasises the importance of immediate and thorough economic reform to reinvigorate the economy, foster a beneficial environment for industry, and curtail the strength of the socialist movement which, according to the Secretary, saps the Empire of its strength with its constant demands. The thirteen point list, described as \"The Urgent Measures\", reflects Hugenberg's economic and political worldview.\n\nHugenberg advocates for immediate deregulation and privatisation of state owned industries, the implementation of import controls and tariffs despite potential conflicts with Mitteleuropa agreements, the overhaul of the welfare system in favour of mandatory savings schemes, a complete ban on strikes, and a one year time limit for all trade unions to either disband or abandon all \"socialist elements\". Additionally, the white paper hints at the prospect of restricting Jewish economic activity, although specifics on such measures remain elusive.\n\nNeedless to say, the Urgent Measures immediately garnered criticism - not just for their radicalism, but also because their publication was completely uncoordinated with government policy. In effect, Hugenberg went off on his own, assuming he can do anything he wants and present the government with a fait accompli."

 gerswr.19.t: "The Secretary's Response"
 gerswr.19.d: "Hugenberg's response to our attempts to disassociate with the Urgent Measures paper was unexpected - he declared that the Urgent Measures represent the economic programme of the Fatherland Party, and must be taken into account by the Schwarz-Weiß-Rot Coalition. As the foremost economic expert in the DVLP, he was indeed highly influential in drafting the economic tenets of their programme, although it does not go as far as Hugenberg's promised reforms.\n\nSenior members of the DkP and the Kleist cabinet are growing increasingly frustrated with Hugenberg - he is impossible to talk down and is utterly convinced that not only the government should listen to his proposals, but that his proposals will save Germany in one stroke, and once they do, the Reichskanzler and the rest of the coalition will have no option but to back down.\n\nHe is not the only one in the DVLP who believes this, however, and moving against him might push them to raise hell..."

 gerswr.19.b: "Hassell should be able to leash his dog."

 gerswr.20.t: "Clash in the DVLP Secretariat"
 gerswr.20.d: "Instructed to restrain the Second Secretary of the Fatherland Party, Ulrich von Hassell called him forth to a meeting in the party's headquarters in Berlin — yet, this merely heightened the tensions. According to witnesses, the debate between them quickly turned sour and Hugenberg's well known stubborn nature prevented any sort of compromise. Hugenberg remains certain that his course for the Economic Secretariat will shut down every naysayer as soon as its inevitable enormous dividends arrive, and threatened Hassell of a leadership challenge several times during the conversation.\n\nThe tone of the Hugenberg press has begun to shift dramatically, denouncing the government as cowards and traitors to the Conservative Revolution who have made a pact with \"liberals, socialists and Jews\" to suppress true German patriots. A party split is impending..."
 gerswr.20.a: "That's not good..."

 gerswr.21.t: "The Tirpitzian-Reactionary Cleavage"
 gerswr.21.d: "Growing tensions between the Reactionary and National Revolutionary wings of the Fatherland Party, especially thanks to Hugenberg's machinations, have now spilled into outright internal war. Regional associations are infighting, party press is confused on its political positions, and support for the Party among the population flounders. Some liberal and socialist outlets are already predicting a split, if not a complete breakdown and collapse of the once feared titan of the far right. Should this happen, the Kleist cabinet might follow in its fall.\n\nThe leadership of the DVLP could tell that a party split is impending. Fearing such an outcome, Ulrich von Hassell has decided to call an emergency conference of the party. Held in Berlin in four months, it will gather representatives from the party regional associations, affiliate organisations and influential backers, and answer at least some of the many, many questions about the future of the party. Far from everyone expect the Conference to become a unifying measure. Should Hugenberg feel confident, he may finally split from the party with his clique, or even give a second try at running for party leadership..."

 gerswr.22.t: "War in the Press"
 gerswr.22.d: "The Urgent Measures paper was received with controversy. Though it has been endorsed by a surprisingly large number of right-wing figures, including major independent news outlets and politicians both from the DVLP and from the other parties in the Schwarz-Weiß-Rot coalition, equally many stood against. Criticism of Hugenberg's vision generally came from the moderate members of the Conservative Party, the self-proclaimed \"People's Conservative\" faction. Organised around leaders such as Walther Lambach and Gottfried Treviranus, they desired the creation of a \"popular conservative\" party that would accept the fundamentals of the democratic system and work within - the British Conservative Party is their inspiration.\n\nTo this wing, Hugenberg's reactionary rhetoric and open war towards the socialists is an obstacle rather than a laudable decision. This conflict has been greatly exploited by the SPD's large propaganda machine - of course, they utterly despised Hugenberg and the entire government, but this internal strife within the S-W-R makes them easy targets for attack."
 gerswr.22.a: "We are all on the same side here!"

 gerswr.23.t: "Paul Bang's Socialist Restriction Act"
 gerswr.23.d: "A new law proposal has been tabled in the Reichstag — it comes from Paul Bang, a DVLP deputy, a member of the Hugenberg clique of the party, a notorious antisemite and a leading member of the Pan-German League. Named the \"Socialism Restriction Act\", it is the first attempt to codify the relatively vague goals of Hugenberg's Urgent Measures paper into law.\n\nThe law, defining \"socialism\" as all ideologies founded upon the worldview of Karl Marx or the French syndicalists, will place a one year timetable for all trade unions in the Empire to abandon all such ideology from their programmes, and also require all unions to cooperate with state secret police on cracking down on enemies of the state. Strikes will be prohibited and agitation for general strike will be punished by prison - instead, any and all struggle for workers' rights must take place through legal channels and bargaining, which will naturally favour the powerful employers.\n\nAs the Ruhrkampf and its violence is still fresh in the memory of German citizens, other members of the Schwarz-Weiß-Rot coalition find it difficult to speak out against the law - even though the government and both party leaders believe it is too soon. Though they sympathise with the goal of destroying socialism and even social democracy, it is too soon - at least before the Internationale is destroyed. There is also little doubt that Hugenberg was involved in the drafting of the bill, and his press began agitating in favour as soon as it was tabled - he is lavishly terrorising the rest of the coalition to get what he wants."

 gerswr.23.b: "There is no choice. The act is put to law."

 gerswr.24.t: "The Secretary's Response"
 gerswr.24.d: "A rift has opened between Secretary Hugenberg and the Kleist government — and seeing the way which the wind is blowing, Hugenberg chose to fight. The Hugenberg press opened up with scathing articles declaring that the coalition has abandoned the cause of conservatism and made a deal with \"liberals, socialists and Jews\" in order to bury the Conservative Revolution. The only person who can save Germany and bring it on track towards national rebirth is the Secretary, who rallies the flag around which all true German patriots should gather.\n\nAs Hugenberg has openly chosen to split from the government, there is little goodwill left for him, and thus there is no option left but to start the process of removing him from office."
 gerswr.24.a: "It's time to end this charade."

 gerswr.25.t: "Hugenberg vs Lambach"
 gerswr.25.d: "Seeing that the Reichskanzler is not speaking out against his moves in the Reichstag, Hugenberg has gone on an unprecedented offensive in the media. In Der Tag, he published a new editorial, titled \"Block oder Brei?\", in which he suddenly threw scathing attacks on Lambach, Treviranus and the other volkskonservatives. They are being attacked for criticising coalition policy and thus threatening the \"union of all positive nationalist forces in Germany\". In the editorial, he demanded that since the right is constantly under attack by all enemies of Germany — socialists, liberals, Jews, and others — any dissent within the ranks of the Coalition is unacceptable and thus all parliamentarians who opposed the Urgent Measures programme should be punished by their party leadership.\n\nHis criticism was especially directed towards Hassell, whose support \"for the implementation of the DVLP party programme\" he demands in the paper. It is believed that unofficially, he has sent a few more ultimatums to the party leader, claiming that if he does not have the full support of the Party for his reforms, he will withdraw all of his supporters and all of his enormous funding. Without his support, the DVLP is sure to collapse."

 gerswr.26.t: "Irreconcilable Pressure"
 gerswr.26.d: "Gottfried Treviranus has called Reichskanzler Kleist and the two party leaders - Hassell and Westarp - to a private meeting in Berlin. Here, the DkP parliamentarian explained that should the current situation last, the coalition is not going to last long. The sharp extreme right turn of the Coalition, initiated by their constant surrender to Hugenberg's whims, is alienating the moderate conservatives, and Hugenberg's constant attacks towards them, equating them to national traitors, is making matters worse. They, German patriots, cannot tolerate the implication that they are in cahoots with socialists and liberals.\n\nTreviranus' demand is that Hugenberg is fired from the Economic Office at haste - if this does not happen, they will have no other option but leaving the coalition. Yet, the DVLP's internal situation has not changed - the Hugenberg clique is stronger than ever and the Party is still reliant on his finance. The Coalition is at crossroads. No matter what choice, they will hurt - but which will hurt less?"
 gerswr.26.a: "Hugenberg has to go, soon."
 gerswr.26.b: "Hassell cannot leave Hugenberg on ice."

 gerswr.27.t: "The People's Conservative Association"
 gerswr.27.d: "The hard-right turn of the Schwarz-Weiß-Rot coalition has alienated the moderate conservatives enough that they have chosen to bolt from the coalition outright. Led by Walther Lambach and Gottfried Treviranus, several influential members of the DkP have proclaimed the formation of the People's Conservative Association, an influence group whose goal is to turn the conservative government back towards the course of moderation. In spite of criticism from the right that their actions are weakening the unity of the movement at a moment when they have the greatest chance to steer the Empire in a right direction, the rift became definite.\n\nReceiving no offers of armistice from the Kleist government and the S-W-R coalition, the volkskonservatives transformed the Association into a party - the Conservative People's Party (Konservative Volkspartei). Its official goal is the formation of a compassionate conservative government which respects the foundations of democracy and defends Germany from the radicalism of the left and the right. An all-Christian coalition with Zentrum, and perhaps the DkP, is their preferred government, which, if formed, would leave the DVLP in the dust and partially restore the balanced governance of the March Coalition."

Relations which were tense ever since 1928 have turned into infighting, and once again putting his press to use, Hugenberg has suddenly announced that \"he no longer holds any confidence in Ulrich von Hassell's leadership of the Party\". This is an open challenge to the current party leadership, and liberal and socialist outlets are already predicting a split, if not a complete breakdown and collapse of the once feared titan of the far right.

 gerswr.29.d: "The results of the party conference of the DVLP are conclusive — the wider membership of the DVLP has endorsed the direction of Ulrich von Hassell and does not approve of Alfred Hugenberg's ultra-reactionary militancy. Hugenberg was soundly outvoted with even greater margins than in 1928, and once it concluded, several of his former allies denounced him, declaring that they disapprove of Hugenberg's \"actively hostile and particularist stances, which threaten the unity of nationalism against syndicalist and Jewish threats\".\n\nFaced with such overwhelming defeat, Hugenberg finally decided to throw in the towel. He resigned from all positions in the government and new articles in Der Tag affirmed the newspaper's support for the Kleist cabinet. The Chancellor, the DkP and the National Revolutionaries can draw an easier breath. The first challenge to the Conservative Revolution has been overcome."

 gerswr.30.d: "The party conference of the DVLP did not lead to the easing of tensions that Chairman Hassell hoped for - with each motion and each topic of discussion, the rift between him and the ultra-reactionaries gathered around Alfred Hugenberg grew wider and wider. Old scars from several years ago reopened, and disagreement over the direction of the government only put salt on these wounds.\n\nThough Hugenberg's faction is stronger than it was in 1928, it still was not able to acquire a majority in the conference, and was defeated in several close votes. With few other options remaining, the politician suddenly declared their departure from the conference. The rift between the National Revolutionaries and the Reactionaries turned into an outright split - both factions denounced each other as splitters, traitors and crypto-socialists in the press during the aftermath, and Hugenberg never returned. He resigned from his positions in the government and founded the German National State Party (Deutschnationale Reichspartei), a separate far-right party.\n\nThe loss of numerous deputies and party members has greatly shaken the DVLP's position in the coalition, and the stability of the cabinet itself is called into question."

 gerswr.31.t: "The Rise of Hugenberg"
 gerswr.31.d: "The party conference of the DVLP did not lead to the easing of tensions that Chairman Hassell hoped for - in fact, the worst possible outcome developed. It turns out that the number of supporters that Hugenberg had among the party membership was greater than anticipated. Representatives who were uncertain which side to join were swayed by the reactionaries with promises of appointments and a more aggressive political line. Confident in his chances, Hugenberg suddenly denounced Hassell's leadership and demanded a vote of no confidence in the conference - a vote which Hassell, ultimately, lost.\n\nThe leader of the National Revolutionaries resigned in shame and Hugenberg was elected in his stead, completing his triumphant march to power. Though Hassell remains the Foreign Secretary, full power in the DVLP is now held by the Reactionary faction - whose leader declares that the DVLP will now pursue a true, national conservatism, not the crypto-socialism that was supported by his predecessor."

Though this is not necessarily a death sentence to a government, especially if it is equipped with an Enabling Act to strengthen the position of the Reichskanzler, it does mean that passing any law will become a struggle - especially annual budgets, which may not be possible without backing from Zentrum, the far right or the left.\n\nThe recent era of Reichskanzler Dirksen is a sharp reminder of what a cabinet without majority support in the Reichstag may degenerate to. Needless to say, this is sparking panic among cabinet secretaries and parliament notables, and any option is being considered. A prolonged minority government?

Instead of sweeping away the liberal and Jewish construct that had been imposed upon the Empire in 1920, he says, \"the national right has entered into business with democracy and the result is that its own position is made more difficult.\" In the same article, he demands the Kleist cabinet to implement harsh measures against socialism and in favour of business interests, to destroy the fifth column and rejuvenate the German economy."

Though this is the status quo, and the government has learned to accept that he cannot be satisfied, his opposition with our current focus has been especially vitriolic. The Hugenberg press has gone independent and is listing various ways in which our actions misrepresent national interest and are detrimental to the future of the Conservative Revolution.\n\nWhile we can try to simply ignore him, this would widen the rift between us and the Hugenberg clique - whereas appeasing him with some alterations to policy will keep him satisfied for some time, but like the embodiment of greed itself, Hugenberg will never be truly satisfied."

 gerswr.35.t: "Growth of Hugenberg's Influence in the Regions"
 gerswr.35.d: "The Fatherland Party appears strong on the outside, especially to foreign observers who search for a strong far-right German party that they can emulate - but its internal structure betrays many crippling weakness. One is the deplorable situation of the party's regional organisations, which are financially weak and have low member discipline, which means that many of the party's members are not paying their dues. This means that they often become reliant on wealthy individual backers, who seek to push forward an agenda acceptable to themselves. In addition, unlike the Reichstag delegation of the DVLP, which needs to compromise with the moderate right in some form, the members of the party's regional organisations take radical propaganda literally.\n\nThis makes the party's regional organisations particularly weak to Hugenberg's influence - and he has been using this advantage well, placing allies in numerous local branches over the past few months. His power within the party is growing right under our noses, and, for now, there is little that Ulrich von Hassell can do about it."
 gerswr.35.a: "This seems worrying."

 gerswr.36.t: "The Unified Phalanx of the Right"
 gerswr.36.d: "Emboldened by the growth of his influence in the regional organisations, Hugenberg appears to be taking the fight to Hassell directly — he decided to write a letter to the Foreign Secretary, in which he articulated his position and approach. He finds no salvation in cooperation with the moderate right — participation in a government which tolerates the parliamentary system prevents the DVLP from tackling fundamental issues and bringing forth a \"National Revolution\", which discourages young, enthusiastic voters from joining the party.\n\nIts structure has become ossified and the party leadership has growth too detached from the grassroots. To answer this, Hugenberg proposes a radical solution — the local organisations of the DVLP should be allowed to openly criticise the actions of the party's Reichstag delegation. This would inject renewed ideological loyalty into the DVLP and allow the common party members to serve as the \"party conscience\" by confronting their representatives on their weakness and delays.\n\nNeedless to say, Hassell quickly realised what this proposal meant - an attempt by Hugenberg to topple him from leadership by getting the regional organisations allied to him to criticise him to no end. Such a move would rapidly escalate the rift between Hugenberg's Reactionaries and Hassell's National Revolutionaries, and perhaps lead to the collapse of the entire party."

 gerswr.37.t: "Internal Breakdown of the DVLP"

Der Tag and the rest of the Hugenberg press immediately took to the offensive, denouncing Hassell for his weakness, collaboration with the moderate right, and refusal to listen to the wishes of the party membership. Reminiscent of 1929, a split between Hugenberg's and Hassell's factions has risen, and some regional organisations are openly talking about defecting to a \"true\" nationalist party."
 gerswr.37.a: "Oh no..."

 gerswr.38.t: "Negotiations Failure"
 gerswr.38.d: "Negotiations with Alfred Hugenberg are a very simple affair - either you accept his positions, or you reach no agreement. Assured of his support among the party membership, Hugenberg did not waver on any of his positions in the negotiations and even responded with an ultimatum where he would withdraw his financial support for the party if his demands are not met. Not only has this made the leadership of the DVLP appear weak in front of an impending party split, swaying a few members of the Reichstag to Hugenberg's side, but it has also made such a split effectively inevitable, unless something is done to save the party."
 gerswr.38.a: "Oh no..."

 gerswr.39.t: "The War on Socialism"
 gerswr.39.d: "Another day, another issue with the Reactionary faction of the DVLP — this time, the problematic actor is one of Hugenberg's top lieutenants, Paul Bang, who has come to the fore with a series of scathingly anti-socialist articles. Ever since the Ruhrkampf, the right's worries about syndicalist sabotage and interference in German politics has been at a record high and Bang has fanned the flames. \"The enemy\", as he declared, \"is on the left\"! And \"the left\" does not merely refer to the small and powerless communist parties filled with French spies and puppets - the SPD, according to Bang, is complicit in forming the right conditions for syndicalist influence to be channeled among German workers and intellectuals. Perhaps even willingly...\n\nNeedless to say, the SPD, which has had to fight off such accusations for decades, disagrees - but support for Bang's hardline anti-socialist stance is found among the far right, and he has been endorsed by figures such as Magnus von Levetzow. Ruhr industrial magnates and Alfred Hugenberg, who can't want to crush trade unions and worker activism in order to increase productivity, are on the same side as the reactionary members of the Fatherland Party as well. Hassell's wing leading the DVLP, on the other hand, would prefer a more measured and careful approach - of course, the destruction of Social Democracy is the goal of everyone in the black-white-red coalition, but should they really be so hasty?"
 gerswr.39.a: "Order the Hugenberg faction to cool down their enthusiasm."
 gerswr.39.b: "Just allow internal debate to play out."

 gerswr.40.t: "The Slap Across the Face"
 gerswr.40.d: "Hugenberg's near ceaseless presence in the political scene earns him allies, but also many, many enemies, both on the right and on the left. Recently, his conflicts with the ruling coalition have gotten a DkP-affiliated newspaper to publish an article which has dealt a slap against the old rat's face - it accused Hugenberg of being a republican!\n\nThe evidence in favour of this claim is numerous - few believe that Hugenberg holds any love for the monarchy, especially ever since Wilhelm II tactically allied with the refomists in the Reichstag and toppled the OHL. During the war, Hugenberg openly expressed his demand for a nationalist dictatorship that would enforce wide annexationist gains in the East and West - and if the Kaiser does not agree, as he supposedly said, then the Kaiser should go! Few also believe that Hugenberg would wish to share power with anyone if he became Reichskanzler, even with the Kaiser himself.\n\nHugenberg, who has kept his frosty relationship with the monarchy on the down low since the Weltkrieg, is obviously unhappy with this - and he demands Hassell to act. This is clearly defamation of his character, and such attacks by a member of the coalition cannot be tolerated."

 gerswr.41.t: "Old Wine in New Bottles"
 gerswr.41.d: "Over the last few weeks, the government has exorbitantly praised the supposed progress of State Secretary Hermann von Lüninck's great agrarian reform over the state radio programme, presenting it as a turning point of the entire agrarian crisis. The actual record, however, speaks volumes. Essentially, the German Conservative Party has just dug out Martin Schiele's old slogans from the early 30s in new packaging, with a slightly populist tinge and a somewhat firmer hand of the government.\n\nIn reformist circles, people are sceptical whether the programme will bring about the promised turnaround in the long run. Lüninck's \"Erbhof\" programme has already turned into an over-bureaucratic mess, a bottomless pit, and whether the newly \"rationalised\" cooperatives will stop the ever-increasing rural exodus in the long run is still written in the stars. As things stand, Germany's food supply would probably still be rather shaky in a hypothetical future conflict, but as long as tiny advances can still be stylised as groundbreaking reforms and major political successes, that will likely not sink in that soon at the DkP's party headquarters."
 gerswr.41.a: "It's going to be fine."

 gerswr.42.t: "Chaos in the Right"
 gerswr.42.d: "Only those with their heads in the sand could have thought that Hugenberg's ascension would bring good news to the government. The first meeting of the leaders of the Schwarz-Weiß-Rot coalition, initiated by Westarp to smoothen out the differences between the Conservatives and the new leader of the Fatherland Party, went poorly. Hugenberg allowed his newfound power to immediately go into his head — so, he began flexing his muscle and demand Conservative surrender to his will, from more secretaries in the cabinet to large adjustments to government policy. Westarp could only offer vague promises and platitudes, convincing no one.\n\nDays later, the first articles in DkP-aligned newspapers, such as the Kreuzzeitung, criticising the DVLP were published — they pointed out the instability of the extreme right, and claimed that Hugenberg was jeopardising the \"Conservative Revolution\". Was the coalition about to collapse? The liberals and socialists certainly awaited it with glee. The DVLP's delegation in the Reichstag tried to salvage the situation with a declaration that they will \"support a national conservative government under any circumstances\" - this motion was pushed forward by Hassell and his National Revolutionaries, going around Hugenberg and his reactionary faction - a direct repudiation of the new Chairman's authority."
 gerswr.42.a: "Is there any way out?"

 gerswr.43.t: "The Winterfeld Motion"
 gerswr.43.d: "Alfred Hugenberg activated his trump card - at his behest, Fatherland Party Member of the Reichstag Friedrich von Winterfeld proposed a resolution which would give the chairman of the Party the sole right to determine whether the Party would participate in a government. This was directly prompted by the revolt of the party's Reichstag delegation, and outside observers fear that Hugenberg would use this resolution to pull out from the government unilaterally.\n\nUlrich von Hassell and his allies were not informed of this plan and, understandably, oppose it vociferously. Nevertheless, Winterfeld has introduced the motion to the executive committee of the DVLP, which is now asked to vote for or against turning into party policy."

 gerswr.44.t: "Hugenberg Quits!"
 gerswr.44.d: "The Schwarz-Weiß-Rot Coalition is dead. Now in full control of the Reichstag Delegation of the DVLP, Hugenberg suddenly announced his departure from the Coalition and issued a demand for all DVLP secretaries to resign from their offices at once. Newspapers frantically announced his titanic realignment to the nation within hours. To the rest of the conservative establishment, this is a bout of madness - but for Hugenberg, this is all a part of a brilliant plan. His goal is to shotgun the coalition into destruction and then use his control of the media to present it as the fault of the DkP and Reichskanzler Ewald von Kleist-Schmenzin - this way, conservative voters would realign to the DVLP. The political system must be polarised between a national opposition bloc and the radical left, at which point all moderate voters would only flock to him.\n\nNot everyone in the DVLP agrees with this plan, however. The National Revolutionary faction, which has had enough of Hugenberg's incompetence and stubborness, refused to pull out - instead, gathered around Ulrich von Hassell, it broke off into a new party which proclaimed its loyalty to the government and, at least in part, restored the black-white-red coalition. Their influence in this coalition has been torpedoed, however."
 gerswr.44.a: "Is this the end of the Conservative Revolution...?"

 gerswr.45.t: "Collapse of the DVLP"
 gerswr.45.d: "The defeat of the Winterfeld Motion did not rest well with the new Chairman - convinced that there is a conspiracy within the party to sabotage him and his perfect plan, he began taking radical actions in order to consolidate his grip over the party. Numerous leading politicians, including parliamentarians, Hassell's associates, and regional leaders opposed to Hugenberg's direction have been expelled, in order to strengthen Hugenberg's hold over the Central Committee. This put the final nail in the coffin of the disintegrating DVLP.\n\nThroughout the following weeks, the party broke apart - numerous regional groups and ambitious individual members left the party and established their own movements, drawing significant numbers of the rank-and-file membership with them. Hugenberg unilaterally declared his departure from the Schwarz-Weiß-Rot coalition, and in response, a smaller faction around Hassell defected and banded together, remaining in government - their influence over government policy, however, is completely crippled.\n\nThe DVLP is now dead as a potent political force. The extreme right is back to its fractured, scattered self from before the Weltkrieg."

 gerswr.46.t: "Resignation of Reichskanzler Kleist"
 gerswr.46.d: "The deadlock in the coalition has been resolved in a swift stroke - the Reichskanzler, Ewald von Kleist-Schmenzin, suddenly announced his resignation. The news came as a shock to all the major power holders in the coalition, and it immediately initiated a scramble for a replacement. It is believed that Kleist's decision was motivated not just by the collapsing situation of the coalition, but personal motivations as well - in his heart, he was an idealist who chose to move to politics because he sought to create what he envisioned as a virtuous harmonious society. The cutthroat politics that he experienced since his appointment as Reichskanzler shattered his expectations, and it is believed that he will distance himself from politics entirely in the aftermath, instead retiring to his estate in Pomerania.\n\nWith the advice of his inner circle and the representatives of the Reichstag, Wilhelm II, as German Emperor, saw it fit to appoint Paul Lejeune-Jung as the next Reichskanzler. This is a significant shift - Lejeune-Jung was chosen as a moderate Catholic conservative who is respected by DkP and Zentrum, and the cabinet he formed reflected that, shutting out the DVLP and the rest of the far-right from government and replacing them with Zentrum representatives. Though he is sympathetic to the reforms envisioned by the DkP, few believe that he will be anywhere near as thorough or radical as the previous DkP-DVLP cabinet."

 gerswr.47.t: "Free Rein for the Diligent"
 gerswr.47.d: "With the introduction of Dr. Schlange's far-reaching agrarian policy reform, a wind of change has begun to shake up Germany's struggling and trailing agricultural sector. A new era has dawned in which modern tractors and combine harvesters finally reach the most remote parts of the Empire, in which high-performance fertilisers finally allow our producers to compete with cheap mass-produced goods from Eastern Europe and overseas, and in which the large-scale expansion of livestock-centred agriculture slowly pushes the Prussian anachronism of the grist and grain monoculture into the history books.\n\nAll of this is made possible by the generous policy of the state-affiliated Preußenkasse, which in recent months has ceaselessly provided all the necessary funds to our farmers in need. Unlike in the past, the principle of merit has finally been applied here. The times in which the complacent Junkers of East Elbia could borrow without limits without contributing any part to our economic salvation are over. While their contributions to our nation's greatness in the past remain unquestioned, their sceptre is now being passed to a new generation. The days of the small-scale farmer and his small patch of land have now arrived.\n\nIt is said that Germany's renewal can only arise out of the simple man's soil, through hard work, tears, blood and sweat. We will not stand in the way of those that are generously giving Germany all of their rejuvenating lifeblood: Free Rein for the Diligent!"

 gerswr.48.t: "Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha Receives British Dissidents"
 gerswr.48.d: "Last weekend, peculiar events took place at Friedenstein Palace in Gotha, the winter residence of Duke Carl Eduard of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. At a grand gala of the Anglo-German Fellowship, the Duke welcomed many representatives from the former British Empire as well as important functionaries of various British émigré circles, including the infamous \"Committee for the Restoration of Great Britain\" (CRGB).\n\nIt is no wonder that Carl Eduard, a grandson of Queen Victoria whose English titles were revoked in 1917 under the Titles Deprivation Act, seeks close ties with such controversial dissident organisations. Germany has long gained a reputation in English émigré circles as the last bulwark against socialism, and the formerly shunned Duke is now praised by his ex-enemies as a \"brilliant example of Anglo-German ties\". This circumstance is underpinned all the more by Carl Eduard's personal ideology - demonstratively reactionary and authoritarian, he is anything but a friend of the post-March Constitution era's parliamentary order, something that has found favour with the CRGB, an elitist group consisting primarily of exiled English businessmen and nobles.\n\nApart from the British guests, numerous local German dignitaries also appeared at the gala - such as business tycoons and representatives of the Duchy's national conservative state government. Thuringia has been a hotbed of right-wing thought for several years, and Gotha in particular has been the seat of a government with DVLP participation since the early 1930s. The Fatherland Party maintains close ties to the far-right British dissident scene, and Weimar-based DVLP-aligned publisher Walther Bacmeister translated and circulated many dissidents' literary works. As long as such meetings take place behind closed doors and are not associated with our government, they principally do not pose a problem. Nevertheless, in times of rising global tensions, caution is advised - a bit more apolitical professionalism would suit the Coburg Duke quite well."

 gerswr.49.t: "Incident in London"
 gerswr.49.d: "After weeks of investigation and a search for clues, the RED has captured two saboteurs on our soil - members of the Committee for the Restoration of Great Britain, a treasonous organisation of exiles which operates in Germany, is suspected of receiving financial support from the Abteilung IIIb and German monarchs, and whose members were conducting espionage of our military and industrial capabilities. Though they took all the precautions they could to not be discovered, both were eventually captured in Dover, and are now in our custody.\n\nThis is the latest and most egregious of a list of dissident-related incidents in the past few years - we have reason to assume that they are instigated from Berlin."
 gerswr.49.a: "Bring this straight to the German embassy."
 GER_swr_49_tt: "German ambassador Leopold von Hoesch will be summoned to the Foreign Office, and we will demand a cessation of German support for the CRGB."

 gerswr.50.t: "Incident in London"
 gerswr.50.d: "In London, trouble is brewing. This morning, another note verbale of the [ENG.GetLeader] administration has arrived at our embassy at Carlton House Terrace. It demands the immediate appearance of ambassador Leopold von Hoesch at the British Foreign Office.\n\nNormally, such drastic measures are only taken in case of serious policy disagreements between two states, but in recent months, London has made use of this tool quite often to express their disagreement with all kinds of dissident-related events taking place somewhere on German soil. Accordingly, our ambassador was not very surprised when it transpired that the matter at hand was another trivial one. It turned out that recently, British counterintelligence had arrested two members of the Committee for the Restoration of Great Britain in Dover, and found compromising documents on them that revealed their ties to our secret service, Abteilung IIIb. Of course, London now demands that measures against that are initiated immediately.\n\nHoesch is thus faced with a foreign political dilemma. In principle, it is not uncommon nowadays for intelligence services to have opposition members of rival states on their payroll. In the syndicalist bloc, it has been common practice to support the left-wing scene in Germany, too, even if we have no tangible proof of this. In addition, the German Foreign Office has no control over the secret service, and therefore cannot be held responsible for this incident. Therefore, this British harassment - one of many in a row - seems like an act of deliberate provocation.\n\nNow, the following question arises - are we really willing to grant the British concessions in the name of international detente, or is it a better option to remain uncompromising and rebuff this audacious request? After all, no foreign country has the right to intervene in our domestic affairs."

 gerswr.52.t: "Germany Does Not Bend"
 gerswr.52.d: "Confronted over the connections which their espionage has with reactionary exiles and traitors, Germany chose to dismiss our claims outright. They declared that we have no real proof of these exiles' cooperation with their intelligence and even accused us of stoking the flames of war, by using this incident as an excuse for a diplomatic confrontation. Needless to say, this has strained the already poor relations between our countries."

 gerswr.53.t: "Hoesch Willing to Compromise"
 gerswr.53.d: "As one of the most renowned representatives of Germany's diplomatic corps, Leopold von Hoesch always knows which words are needed in what situation to pour oil on troubled water. After a short, but determined consultation with Berlin, he decided to promise London vague concessions in the name of rapprochement; he has recognised the validity of London's complaints and promised that the German government will initiate investigations within the German secret service to track down black sheeps, certainly not an uncontroversial move.\n\nAlready sensing that tensions with Britain are likely not going to ease in the future despite all efforts, and that London's primitive affront could be interpreted as a deliberate provocation attempt, Hoesch's strategy primarily boils down to underpinning Germany's reputation on the world stage as a tranquil bulwark of righteousness - a Germany that deliberately creates tensions in peacetime merely in the name of national prestige might be isolated in case war breaks out, as has already been proven more than 20 years ago. Foreign policy hardliners may disagree with this assessment, and will surely soon overwhelm the Cabinet with countless angry memoranda."
 gerswr.53.a: "As Bismarck said: \"The duty of the diplomat is to make reciprocal and unceasing concessions\"."

 gerswr.54.t: "Hoesch Stands Firm"
 gerswr.54.d: "As one of the most renowned representatives of Germany's diplomatic corps, Leopold von Hoesch always knows which words are needed in what situation to act in the Empire's best interest. After a short consultation with Berlin, he has decided to rebuff London's audacious demands in a polite, but determined way. Germany's supposed ties to British dissidents have been dismissed as regrettable but legal ventures by private individuals, and the alleged links of the captured saboteurs to Abteilung IIIb are bogus.\n\nNaturally, London is enraged about our reaction, but in no position to do anything against it: using such a minor incident with questionable proof to provoke open conflict would ruin the reputation of the syndicalist bloc on the global stage, especially considering that they have been complicit of similar deeds in the past. We have demonstrated our integrity and determination for another time, unwilling to concede to this act of obvious and deliberate provocation. Foreign-political doves may disagree with this assmement, and will surely soon overwhelm the Cabinet with countless angry memoranda."
 gerswr.54.a: "As Bismarck said: \"We will become the anvil if we do nothing to become the hammer\"."

 gerswr.55.t: "Intervention from Berlin"
 gerswr.55.d: "As one of the most renowned representatives of Germany's diplomatic corps, Leopold von Hoesch always knows which words are needed in what situation to mediate conflicts while acting in the Empire's best interests — however, despite his excellent reputation as a master negotiator, the Foreign Office in Berlin has directly intervened into this diplomatic dispute. This is no surprise — State Secretary for Foreign Affairs Ulrich von Hassell has long been a critic of Hoesch's pragmatic course and has pushed for his replacement with a more resolute hardliner.\n\nHassell's efforts to shorten the leash of the German Ambassador in London during this moment of weakness can be interpreted as a desperate attempt to fully bring the Empire's old-guard diplomats in line with the Fatherland Party's understanding of \"good\" foreign policy — potentially with far-reaching consequences. At a press conference in Berlin, Hassell declared the British accusations a fabricated claim of Germany's ancient enemies that lurk in the shadows, and reinforced that no foreign country can arrogate to itself the right to judge or intervene in Germany's internal affairs. This move has been applauded by the Empire's foreign-political hawks, who have long described the mediocre, ambivalent relations between London and Berlin as \"duplicitous hypocrisy\". London's reaction has been comparably restrained, an official government statement is still being awaited."
 gerswr.55.a: "As Bismarck said: \"We will become the anvil if we do nothing to become the hammer\"."

 gerswr.56.t: "An Ace Up Their Sleeve"
 gerswr.56.d: "Yet, it seems Hassell's all-in strategy has failed and backfired. Tangible documents were submitted to Hoesch which prove the undisputable involvement of the DVLP in supporting the British dissident scene, including several compromising photographs which come from Duke Carl Eduard's controversial social event in Gotha earlier this year. In every other situation, it would have been one person's word against another's, but the emergence of the photos put the Foreign Minister under severe pressure, as they render all of his previous statements null and void. Lies and deception have naturally always been part of diplomacy, but they usually only become a problem when they can be proven - Hassell's integrity is at stake.\n\nBut not only his own career is in jeopardy. London's revelation also severely threatens to damage the reputation of the DVLP as a whole, especially within the black-white-red bloc, because it would indirectly confirm the prejudices and concerns of many old-guard conservatives about the amateurish, unreliable and overly hawkish behaviour of the national revolutionaries on the political stage. As a result, the DVLP's influence within the coalition might suffer from this incident.\n\nTherefore, Hassell is now faced with a risky game of chess. In order to emerge victorious from this standoff, he must both smooth things over in order not to further worsen relations with England, and somehow save face, reinforce his position and preserve the strong standing of the Fatherland Party within the Kleist Cabinet. A dangerous race against the clock has begun - now we will see who is really a master diplomat of the Bismarckian school and who will go down in the annals of history as an unfortunate loser, like many before."

After eighth years of more or less stable relations between the German Empire and the Union of Britain, initiated by the well-intentioned diplomatic efforts of Foreign Minister Arthur Henderson and the Wilhelm Marx Cabinet in 1930, ties between London and Berlin have been severed again, a clear signal that Germany's Foreign Secretary Ulrich von Hassell seeks to escalate tensions.\n\nHow shall we respond?

Ambassador Hoesch has begun negotiations with our diplomats on the future of the German-British relationship, our emigres on German soil, and other demands we require to be fulfilled.\n\nYet, as time drags on, it does not seem like the ambassador is offering much to us - deferring to the German foreign ministry on every step and refusing to make any tangible concessions nor assurances, he has kept the negotiations at a standstill for days. Of course, it might simply not be easy for the German foreign service to offer anything while they are at the whims of the Kaiser, but it could also be that this is a deliberate tactic from Hassell's part.

 gerswr.60.a: "Hopefully, it will be."

 gerswr.61.t: "All Eyes on Berlin"
 gerswr.61.d: "Our strategy did not work out as expected, as the Brits did not respond to our withdrawal of Ambassador Hoesch from London by withdrawing their own ambassador from Berlin as a retaliation. Consequently, we are now perceived on the global stage as one-sided provocateurs for deliberately fuelling global tensions and harming Anglo-German relations over an apparently trivial diplomatic incident.\n\nNow, two choices remain: we can either decide to carefully reach out to London to calm both the waves and the international community - which would surely deter London from publishing the compromising documents about the DVLP that are in their possession - or we can decide to double down on our efforts and further escalate, to prove to the world that our cause is the rightful one. The first choice might deescalate this difficult situation, but could end in a humiliation, as we would certainly be forced to make concessions. Sometimes, ruthless force is the best way to further our interests - a little naval manoeuvre near Dogger Bank could put a quick end to the ambitious Icarian flight of the complacent Englishmen."

Unsettled by our passivity, Berlin has actually backed down, now that the international spotlight is focused once again on Germany's erratic foreign policy, and agreed to enter into a second round of secret bilateral negotiations with us. This is something we can definitely capitalise on: Here in the Foreign Office, we most certainly hold the home advantage, which we need to use to the fullest extent to further our interests."

After several days of complete diplomatic radio silence, we suddenly received reports both from the C.I.C and from several port cities on the North Sea coast that a massive naval force of unknown origin had been assembled at Dogger Bank, dangerously close to our home waters. Upon further investigation, it turned out to be an enormous German naval demonstration, described in the German media as an extension of the annual Kaiser Manoeuvre, which is usually held in late summer. The actual intentions, however, are more than clear: the Germans are making use of an ancient trick in their foreign-political repertoire, gunboat diplomacy, to force us into submission. However, we are not yet a Central American banana republic to fall for such a cheap attempt at escalation - it would not be the first time that the Germans underestimated our resolve. This will have immediate consequences!"

Not only the temporarily recalled German Ambassador Leopold von Hoesch made the symbolic journey to Canossa across the Channel, but this time also Foreign Secretary Ulrich von Hassell himself.\n\nAfter several rounds of heated debates, both parties were apparently able to reach a compromise agreement, which, however, in reality seems to slightly favour the British side, which was able to make clear use of their home advantage. The Germans have been contractually obliged to immediately cut off all government support for British dissident groups and must make new appointments in the top echelons of the intelligence service, Department III b. This is all the more embarrassing for Germany, as the same outcome could have been achieved if Berlin had cooperated with London from the outset, instead of being wilfully obstructive for the sake of saving face and thereby fuelling global tensions.\n\nNevertheless, the worst has been prevented for Hassell and the DVLP, as the documents in London's possession did not find their way to the public. For a party that embodies uncompromising, hawk-like foreign political positions, the agreement is a clear humiliation, though, and Hassell's reputation as a foreign political hardliner has suffered - certainly with consequences for the internal power struggle within the black-white-red cabinet."

Not only the temporarily recalled German Ambassador Leopold von Hoesch made the symbolic journey to Canossa across the Channel, but this time also Foreign Secretary Ulrich von Hassell himself.\n\nSurprisingly, it seems that the presence of the latter was able to increase Germany's leverage during the negotiations massively. Hassell presented himself as a relentless defender of German interests and was able to redeem his previous amateurish behaviour by being able to talk the British side into accommodating selected German counter-demands, with an overall reducing effect on the concessions to be made by Germany.\n\nThe consequent Anglo-German Agreement, hedged with a mountain of ambiguous clauses, therefore does not seem to favour the British as much as initially expected. While the Germans have been contractually obliged to immediately cut off all government support for British dissident groups, none of the clauses are actually able to de facto enforce any tangible measures against it; simultaneously, however, London only conceded not to publish the compromising documents, but no clause mentions an outright destruction of the material. In the end, this more or less means that neither side can derive a clear benefit from the agreement, which makes it - on a cynical level - surprisingly fair.\n\nFor Hassell, however, this is enough to play himself up as the great strategist who managed to turn the tables in the German interest at the last moment. His strange foreign-political manoeuvre and the Ambassador Crisis in general are viewed with incomprehension and confusion in Germany, but at least Hassell has somehow managed to save face within the black-white-red coalition and spare his party a humiliation of much greater extent."

Consequently, we are now perceived on the global stage as one-sided provocateurs for deliberately fuelling global tensions and harming Anglo-German relations over an apparently trivial diplomatic incident.\n\nNow, two choices remain. One, we can decide to carefully reach out to Berlin to calm both the waves and the international community, to demonstrate to the world that our intentions are pure and not deceitful, as our first diplomatic move might have made the impression of, and that we are willing to find a compromise as long as our well-justified interests are met. This might deescalate this difficult situation, but could end in a humiliation, as we would certainly be forced to accept concessions. The other strategy would be to double down on our efforts and further escalate, to make it clear to everyone that our cause is the rightful one - we would have no choice but to publish the compromising documents in question. This might backfire in the worst case if the international community questions our trustworthiness, but it would be a strong sign of our determination."

This act of insolent slander is unacceptable, but fits all too well with the cowardly character of the deceitful Englishman who would rather stick a knife in his opponent's back than play by the honourable rules of international diplomacy. For Foreign Secretary Hassell and the Fatherland Party, these documents could result in a major scandal and damage their trustworthiness on the global stage and within the Empire - our fate now depends on whether we or the British will be given more credence."

The reaction of the German media, however, can be described as relatively reserved, as the opposition media has not seized upon this opportunity to rush against the government. In fact, the incident seems to have boosted the legitimacy of Hassell's uncompromising foreign-political course and granted him the golden opportunity to present himself as a stalwart fighter against Anglo-Saxon and syndicalist lies and deceit. For the DVLP, the crisis therefore came at just the right time, as it will certainly strengthen its position within the black-white-red cabinet - London, on the other hand, will have a hard time getting rid of the reputation of the dubious and at the same time amateurish provocateur."

This does not seem to have been the case, however.

In the end, both sides were therefore forced to make a certain amount of concessions, making the agreement comparably fair, as both are able to at least draw some advantage from the agreement, even if only minor.\n\nFor the DVLP, the worst has been prevented as the documents in London's possession have been destroyed, and Hassell is able to play himself up as the great strategist who managed to force Britain into yielding merely by remaining calm and not reacting to their unjustified provocation - the fact that concessions were made will likely not strengthen his position within the black-white-red coalition, though. London, on the other hand, can be relieved that Germany guaranteed them by treaty to cut off all government ties to the British emigre community.

Krieg in Sicht? La guerre est-elle en vue? Predviditsya li voyna? The times of secret diplomacy and bilateral negotiations are over - now, the attention of the entire globe is directed towards both nations, as fears of further escalation are rising high. In Paris, Vienna and Moscow, fearful observers and opportunist schemers make themselves ready to intervene or further their influence.\n\nThe standoff between London and Berlin has now reached the hottest phase; every minor decision will determine the outcome of the crisis, possibly the fate of both nations - only one side will be able to emerge victorious.

For Berlin and Foreign Secretary Hassell, the best possible case has occurred: In an almost Bismarckian fashion, he decided to show restraint at the height of the crisis and got his opponents to strike first, which in turn isolated them on the global stage and gave Germany greater leeway to act - the Brits have managed to mercilessly expose themselves through their own behaviour.\n\nThe incident seems to have boosted Hassell's reputation as a stalwart defender from syndicalist lies and deceit.

By remaining calm instead of further escalating, he tried to win the standoff by keeping his poker face, waiting out and getting his opponent to strike first, reminiscent of Bismarck's strategy in 1870. He probably should have learned better from his unmatched role model - sometimes, it's classic display of power and brusque pushing ahead that rewards the strongest, not witty mind games.

Now that the German right has unified into one hegemon, however, it requires a united youth organisation as well - so, the disparate youth groups of both parties, as well as numerous other right-wing youth organisations, joined together and established the Bismarckjugend (Bismarck Youth). The coat of arms of the House of Bismarck was adopted as its new symbol, and, incidentally, Herbert von Bismarck, the famous Reichskanzler's grand-nephew, was elected as its chairman.\n\nThrough the DNVB's control of the education system, hundreds of thousands of young Germans have been enrolled into its ranks.

Over a century ago, the Prussian reformer Heinrich Friedrich Karl vom und zum Stein realised this exact same prophecy - and rather than blindly following the French Revolution like so many others, he devised a unique system which would have embarked Prussia on its own path. His Organic State would be ruled by a National Representation council made up of a homegrown elite, formed from patriotic, educated German citizens who earned a name for themselves in the civil service of their local community.\n\nTimes have changed, nor can we blindly copy Stein's ideas - but we can come close.

Though the conservative movement did not have much in common with these patrons of history, the NLP was sadly overtaken by even worse elements from the bourgeoisie electorate - left-wing liberals who began aggressively agitating for parliamentary reforms which would mechanically import the sterile practices of the Western European states. The National Liberals, though not faultless, understood the folly of such dreams. They saw themselves as more liberal than democratic, after all.\n\nThe reconfiguration of the political system after our Conservative Revolution has given the NLP a new lease of life - disappointment with the failures of left-liberalism has pushed many right-wing liberals to embrace a more cooperative attitude towards the regime, defending business interests against the massive rural, authoritarian, conservative DNVB bloc. Our representatives have thus developed a cooperative relationship with the strengthened NLP, and they will hopefully serve as a harmless, constructive opposition."

 gerswr.87.t: "The Weltvolk"
 gerswr.87.d: "It is a fact of history that Germans are a people born to dominate and rule, who do not deserve to be stuck in central Europe, but must expand throughout the world — they are a \"Weltvolk\", a people of the world. Tirpitz understood this - he was an unparalleled Weltpolitiker who was willing to lead Germany out of its continental confinement, and though he is no longer with us and he was stopped by egoistic party politicians, we need to follow his footsteps and lead Germany into a grandiose future.\n\nOf course, we should not go at it alone. Germany is the heart, the engine of a Greater Europe - Großeuropa - but a heart cannot beat without all the other organs that make up the body. Much like how Europe without Germany would be a shell of itself, so would it be without Spain, France, Russia or Italy. Still, Europe needs to be led by a world-minded people such as the Germans, and all of Europe has something in common - Christian spirit and a pure European character.\n\nGermany thus has a natural role to lead Europe, a pan-European bloc which will struggle against the other grand civilisations and prevail - a German-led Europe must dominate the globe, from the Americas to the farthest reaches of Asia, and our regime, reviving Germany's national pride, will see this dream through."

 gerswr.88.t: "The Kleistian Vision: A Close Watch on the Crown Prince"
 gerswr.88.d: "With the restoration of the Privy Council, our influence on the Imperial family and Kaiser Wilhelm's political decision-making has vastly increased, enabling us to enforce our ideological agenda on the Hohenzollerns more smoothly. The Crown Prince, however, is quite an unpredictable figure; while nominally aligned to our vision of weakening the parliamentary order,  he is unwilling to listen to the advice of our conservative-moralist advisors. Questionable personal friends of his like ex-Chancellor Schleicher are undermining our efforts by trying to persuade the Crown Prince that we are only using him as an instrument, unwilling to actually strengthen royal prerogatives. As if Schleicher didn't have the same plan!\n\nReichskanzler Kleist has never been a friend of the Crown Prince, downright disgusted that this decadent clown, unworthy of inheriting the legacy of his great ancestors, is the one that will succeed to the Prussian throne in the near future. Someone who is that unpopular with the people could ruin our great conservative project with one misstep. There needs to be some way to rein in this man -  perhaps a slow guy like him needs a bit more... well, direct persuasion.\n\nWilhelm is known as an enthusiastic hunter, often to be found at royal hunting lodges in East Prussia, Silesia, or in the distant forest of Bialowieza. It's time for him to get back in touch with old Prussian virtues such as sobriety, temperance, and frugality. Kleist will send the Crown Prince an invitation to a joint hunting event in the old Prussian style on the Kleistian hunting grounds in Farther Pomerania, far-away from the Hohenzollerns' usual pompous lifestyle. A little one-on-one talk might open his eyes."
 gerswr.88.a: "Waidmannsheil!"

 gerswr.89.t: "The Kleistian Vision: On the Hunt for Long-Gone Ideals"
 gerswr.89.d: "Quite surprisingly, Crown Prince Wilhelm accepted Kleist's invitation. Upon arriving at Gut Schmenzin, the Reichskanzler's picturesque Pomeranian estate, he could not know yet that neither his state-of-the-art hunting equipment nor his closest confidants would be needed for the programme itinerary set up by Kleist. It would be a two-way affair between the chancellor and the Crown Prince, in an effort to lead the latter back to his ancestral roots, showing him what really counts in life - a spiritual trip to the days of Old Fritz.\n\nAlready on the first night, Wilhelm is confronted with the rustic reality of traditional Prussian rural life. Awoken at 3 o'clock by the manor's servants, he would meet the chancellor for a small breakfast. Over rye bread, strong tea and a cigar, the details of the upcoming hunt are discussed. Wild boar is on the shooting list that morning, nothing special for the Crown Prince, who is otherwise used to hunting wisent, moose, and other big-game. But for Kleist, it's not about the hunt itself, but about the subliminal message that he wants to convey.\n\nFor a simple boar hunt, the trip takes quite a while. Wilhelm is amazed at how Kleist lasts so long in the forest without luncheon, and after they finally shoot the boar, he admires Kleist's dedication to the dead animal. A brief wake next to the carcass, later a careful measurement of its tusks - a stark contrast to the carefree killing sprees that are common on the Hohenzollerns' hunting grounds. \"Appreciation of God's Creation is one of our most important obligations\", reminds him Kleist. Later that evening, the two hunters meet for a conversation in the fireside lounge. Kleist, famous for his astute analytical skills, seizes every moment to examine Wilhelm's behaviour. Who is the man behind the crooked facade?\n\nWhen the Crown Prince departs the next day, the Chancellor finally has a clearer picture in mind. Like his father, Crown Prince Wilhelm seems to be concerned with recognition. Those who have remained in the shadows for so long, who have grown up without any virtuous influence, turn into an amoral shell. Kleist hopes that the tete-a-tete has had some effect on the Crown Prince and that he has become more aware of his role in society and the joys of a simple, virtuous life."
 gerswr.89.a: "We will see whether it bears fruit."

 gerswr.90.t: "The Kleistian Vision: The Talents of Tomorrow"
 gerswr.90.d: "It is another one of those days on which Kleist's work life in the stone desert of Berlin becomes too much to handle; someone who spends every day with cutthroat career politicians is in danger of falling into mental degeneration himself. Intellectual exchange helps to calm his nerves in such moments. Today, Kleist decides to visit the Friedrich Wilhelm University, not far away from the Imperial Chancellery. A young Doctor of Theology by the name of Dietrich Bonhoeffer who manages to captivate his students even with the driest theological topics is supposed to lecture there - the Reichskanzler, a well-read Protestant himself, simply has to see a man of such talent in person.\n\nKleist mingles inconspicuously with the crowd of students and observes Bonhoeffer's lecture from the auditorium grandstand. He is impressed that a communal prayer is held at the beginning, and the rhetorical talent of the young man, probably just 30 years old, casts a spell over him. Kleist does not agree with all of Bonhoeffer's theological conclusions, especially not with his pronounced ecumenical attitude, but the lecture leaves him with enthusiasm. He needs to have a personal chat with this young talent!\n\nAfter all the students have left, Kleist reveals his identity, and the two decide to meet for a theological debate at a nearby street café. Hours pass in deep discussion, and the conversation is becoming increasingly political. How can the German Christian of today still experience hope in a Europe plagued by aggravating tensions, by looming war? What key role can and will Germany, the heart of the continent, play in all of this in the future?\n\nBonhoeffer bases his argumentation on the New Testament Sermon on the Mount. \"Because we can in no way understand war as God's order of preservation and therefore as God's commandment\", he argues, \"the next war must be condemned by the Church. We should not shy away from the word 'Pacifism' here.\" Kleist agrees only partially, making a direct connection between the political and the religious spheres. \"The true conservative selflessly serves his people just as God intended him to do\", he claims. \"Since God's main task to us is to defend His creation, can war not be perceived as a legitimate, if last resort matter of defence?""
 gerswr.90.a: "Herr Dr. Bonhoeffer, what would you say?"

 gerswr.91.t: "The Kleistian Vision: Christian Ethics in an Un-Christian World"
 gerswr.91.d: "Bonhoeffer shakes his head. \"How does peace come about? Through a system of political treaties, through armament for the purpose of securing peace? No, not through any of this, for the one reason that peace and security are being confused. There is no way towards peace by way of security. Peace is the opposite of security. Demanding security means having mistrust, and this mistrust in turn gives birth to war.\" Germany has contributed to the escalating European tensions by further fueling them with their rhetoric and exaggerated defensive posturing. Kleist nods reluctantly, arguing that this is because Germany has lost access to its own roots, the Prussian spirit, for many decades. \"Germany must once again assume its God-given role as the \"Empire of the Centre\", creating a balance on the continent in the Old Prussian manner! That's why it's good to have clear-thinking, constructive Christians such as you, to leave the degeneracy behind that has led us astray for decades at this point!\"\n\nSoon after, the two go their separate ways again. While on his way back to the Chancellery, Kleist thinks about Bonhoeffer's words. How to deal with them in practical politics? Deep in thought, he suddenly comes to a terrible realisation. How can he, the Reichskanzler, even contribute to lasting peace, the only true Christian duty, with a cabinet consisting primarily of foreign politics hardliners and career politicians who openly stoke tensions for petty prestige-related reasons? The domestic political reorganisation after 1936 was undoubtedly a necessity, but is the outbreak of war inevitable in the same way? The day will come when Kleist has to justify himself in front of his God - will he then be able to claim with a clear conscience that he has done everything within the realm of possibility to fulfil his divine duty?"
 gerswr.91.a: "Sometimes, we realise that we hold less power than we initially assumed."

 gerswr.92.t: "The Kleistian Vision: A Conservative Matriarch"
 gerswr.92.d: "Decadence is has permeated not only the Hohenzollerns for decades, but also a majority of the aristocracy, right down to the most impoverished landed gentry. How can the Second Estate still assume their divine responsibility of acting as idols for the common man? It's no wonder that today's youth are seen as particularly spoiled, they lack people they can look up to! The veneration of role models begins at the village level; the lord of the local manor is more likely to serve as an identification figure for the simple farmhand than the Kaiser in far-away Berlin. Kleist is certain that there is a need for pioneers who lead the way to bring about a change of mind among the nobility.\n\nLuckily, such a pioneer happens to live not too far from Gut Schmenzin: Kleist's aunt Ruth von Kleist-Retzow of the neighbouring Klein Krössin estate, elderly matriarch of the Kleist family and Pomerania's most famous female Junker. Throughout her life, Ruth, who shares most of the religious-idealist ideas of her Schmenzin relative, has written a plethora of guidebooks about the nobility's obligations, the most famous being \"The Responsibility of Landed Property in This Social Crisis\". Here, she stresses that large-scale land ownership brings not only privileges, but also responsibilities.\n\nAs the \"little king\" of his small community, the Junker must care for the well-being of his subordinates, for example by providing funds to increase local healthcare and accommodation standards for his agricultural workers and farmhands; to quote Ruth, \"A landowner who affords a car, but not a community nurse, is not worthy of the estate that God has given to him!\"\n\nOur recent reforms should relieve the Junkers and detach them slightly from the capitalist framework while preventing rural exodus to the cities more resolutely. Only without profit-related considerations in mind, the Junker class will be able to assume its ancient responsibilities again. The writings of Ruth von Kleist-Retzow should be mandatory literature in every noble household - in the long term, this will not only strengthen the ties between Junkers and rural workers, but will also turn the Prussian countryside into a reliable bulwark of stalwart tradition."

 gerswr.93.t: "A Quiet Moment"
 gerswr.93.d: "Far away from Berlin on a cold morning, the bell of the small church in the Pomeranian village of Hopfenberg strikes 10:30, marking the end of the weekly Sunday sermon. The few attendants leave the building, wish themselves farewell, and go their separate ways. Among them is a prominent and honoured guest, an older man with a bushy moustache, slim and slender, rooted to his home district like an ancient oak - none other than ex-Chancellor Ewald von Kleist-Schmenzin.\n\nWhile on the way to his parked car, he takes out his pipe and tries to locate the little matchbox in the depths of his coat pocket, as he is suddenly approached by a stranger, someone Kleist has never seen before in this tranquil village. \"Herr von Kleist-Schmenzin\", he hears him yell through the cold wind, \"Belgarder Kreisblatt! Could we get your statement on the recent political events in Berlin?\"\n\nIt is not the first time that the Altkanzler has been sought out by reporters, mostly from local papers or foreign newspapers. But what he really thinks about the current government would not even be printed under the given censorship anymore. A political project with so much potential, and yet, it got diluted along the way by the very same kind of people Kleist had pledged to fight many years ago: greedy, egoistical parliamentarians, in the guise of upright conservatism. What has it brought over Germany? Entrenched rule of one corrupt party, a far-cry from the organic leadership many envisioned a decade ago. The nobility has become even more decadent, nationalist rhetoric even more vulgar - arguably, the Prussian spirit is just as dead as it was ten or twenty years ago. Populism, radical nationalism, materialism, and mass politics have long substituted the old Prussian values of noble quality.\n\nAll this would only have been half as bad if Kleist himself had not contributed to this abomination - with his own naivety. But the Altkanzler has long grown weary of political discussions. He packs away his pipe unlit and waves the reporter off. \"Tell your audience\", he replies, \"that I am at full peace with myself and my God. I am not available for interviews\". While his Mercedes pulls away, Kleist looks melancholically into the distance. Lying may be a sin, but what else remains in these bleak times than to flee into privacy and seclusion?"

 gerswr.94.t: "The Legacy of Grand Admiral Tirpitz"
 gerswr.94.d: "The principles of National Revolution and Organic Statehood play a central role in the DVLP's rhetoric, despite only taking root in the party a few years ago. First being formulated by post-war far-right ideologues and later popularised after Chairman Hassell's ascension in 1929, the essence of these ideas is as old as the DVLP itself.\n\nTheir roots can be traced back to one of the most controversial men in recent German history, Grand Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz. Globally notorious as the brain behind unrestricted submarine warfare, as the main driver of the Anglo-German Naval Arms Race, his role as a right-wing ideologue should not be underestimated. Despite his direct involvement in the DVLP spanning only from 1917 to 1920, his ideas wielded lasting impact, now notably being championed by his son-in-law Hassell at the party's helm.\n\nTirpitz was among the earliest to recognise that true conservatism required more than mere preservation. Entrusting the defence of tradition to an entrenched elite of gatekeepers was bound to result in dilution and infiltration by more adaptable forces - survival of the fittest. Already in 1914, Germany had reached that point, and in 1920, the final blow was dealt. The March Reforms underscored the realisation that even the Kaiser could no longer be trusted as a defender of Germany's true soul; as a true patriot, Tirpitz recognised that Germany's most sacred institution, the monarchy, had to be protected from itself.\n\nPreserving German traditions and advancing true conservatism, embodied by the Organic State, demands staying ahead of adversaries and beating them at their own game. Germany needs to find the way back to her roots via a national-minded movement from below, including as many groups as possible in the process: Catholics, workers, even Jews. This is precisely what Tirpitz' national revolution means, what national-revolutionary thought embodies, and what the “new” DVLP of Hassell and his associates strives for!"

 gerswr.95.t: "Caught Between Old and New"
 gerswr.95.d: "With the formation of the black-white-red coalition, the German Conservative Party faces a challenging dilemma. The establishment of a purely right-wing government has been a long-awaited dream of many conservatives, but now the DkP finds itself as the smaller junior partner in the coalition, vulnerable to marginalisation by the DVLP over time, given the latter's vast support base. Both parties target a similar electorate, technically making them rivals, and the DkP's association with the despised partisan establishment further complicates its position.\n\nTo avoid becoming a mere stirrup holder for the more radical coalition partner, proactive measures are required. Chairman Kuno von Westarp has spent years refining his own concept of conservatism, termed "Applied Conservatism", asserting that conservatism has the god-given obligation to rule, while advocating for a broader, catch-all approach instead of remaining entrenched in an elitist ivory tower. This concept has worked well for the past 15 years, firmly establishing the DkP within the rural Protestant electorate - but it now requires further development.\n\nIt is clear that the DkP will never have the same appeal to the radicalised masses as the DVLP. That's why it's time to draw strengths from one's weaknesses - the reputation of being an establishment party will always cling to the old conservatives, so it must be used to their advantage. When being offered a reasoned alternative to radical populist nationalism, the masses will reorient themselves in the DkP's favour as soon as the heated political climate starts to calm down. Then, strategic navigation between tradition and innovation, a skillful balance of old and new, as well as Westarp's ties to the moderate establishment will be key to maintain control over the population while undercutting the DVLP's influence within the coalition."

 gerswr.96.t: "The 1939 DkP Chairman Elections"
 gerswr.96.d: "For the first time in years, the German Conservative Party is preparing for leadership elections. Kuno von Westarp, long-time party chairman for almost two decades, finds himself at a crossroads: Despite his enduring vigour at 75, he recognises the need for a transition, and has proposed an unprecedented concept in the party's history, a dual leadership model. In this arrangement, Westarp would retain his symbolic duties as First Chairman, enabling him to devote more time to his eventual retirement, while a younger co-chair would inject fresh vigour into the party. His aim is clear: A symbolical handshake between old guard and new guard.\n\nYet, navigating this transition will not be smooth sailing, as the DkP's new guard stands hopelessly divided. Since 1936, the rift between the so-called Popular Conservatives under Gottfried Treviranus and the Farmers' Wing under Hans Schlange-Schöningen has steadily widened. While the former seeks to expand on Westarp's concept of "Applied Conservatism" to transform the DkP into a modern mass party on a right-wing democratic basis that can outbalance the DVLP's radical influences, the latter advocates for a völkisch-nationalist agenda and supports corporatist, anti-elitist ideas, thus playing directly into the DVLP's cards.\n\nAs the DkP stands at a critical juncture, the outcome of this power struggle within the new guard will shape the party's trajectory for years to come."

 gerswr.97.d: "The chairman elections went in favour of Gottfried Treviranus, the Popular Conservatives' spiritus rector and personal protege of Westarp. Once a promising naval commander who fought in illustrious battles such as the legendary confrontation at Jutland, Treviranus technically belongs to the same demographic that flocked in masses to the Fatherland Party during the early 30s, the self-designated “Young Conservatives”. Where others of his generation have given in to the aberrations of radical populism, he has chosen the path of moderation, dialogue, and compromise, working closely with Westarp to broaden the appeal of the struggling DkP in recent years.\n\nAt the end of the day, Treviranus is no friend of the parliamentary order either - like most conservatives, he holds a deep contempt for social democracy and the March Reforms and yearns for a return to a more organic system, a romanticised past. But unlike more radical voices, he and his Popular Conservatives do not plan to destroy the democratic order from the ground up to replace it with a corporatist-dictatorial alternative. The broken system simply needs to be streamlined a bit, to serve conservative interests. Embracing traditional conservative definitions of responsibility and duty, he advocates not for the wholesale abandonment of the given political system but for the adaptive evolution of conservatism to assert dominance within it."

 gerswr.98.t: "Populist Agrarians Stand Victorious"
 gerswr.98.d1: "The chairman elections went in favour of Hans Schlange-Schöningen, State Secretary of Agriculture since 1937 and the farmers' wing spiritus rector. Despite the controversies surrounding his ambitious reform programme, Schlange's tenure witnessed unprecedented strides in resolving the agrarian crisis, earning him widespread support among common farmers and peasants. As a result of these successes, the victory of his faction within the DkP was only a matter of time.\n\nHowever, for the entrenched establishment of the Conservative Party, the victory of the “Bauernflügel” marks a seismic shift away from rational governance towards a populist trajectory. With Schlange assuming co-chairmanship, the era dominated by traditional elites, Junkers, and bureaucratic influence within the DkP draws to a close, making way for the ascendancy of the right-wing populist agrarian faction. The drift into the shallows of nationalist populism is now imminent - for the first time in the history of the DkP, the völkisch-nationalist concept of popular sovereignty could take precedence over the traditional Prussian ideal of state sovereignty.\n\nThe main beneficiary of the upcoming shift will certainly be the Fatherland Party. Schlange and his associates share a common ideological ground with Hassell's national revolutionaries and will likely align the party closer with the more radical coalition partner. This could effectively turn the Conservative Party into a weak junior partner within the coalition, putting its role as a balancing counterweight against radical influences at stake."
 gerswr.98.d2: "The chairman elections went in favour of Hans Schlange-Schöningen, long-time leader of the Pomeranian DkP branch and the farmers' wing spiritus rector. In 1937, Schlange found himself passed over as State Secretary for Agriculture in favour of the moderate compromiser Hermann von Lüninck - consequently, Schlange emerged as a prominent dissenting voice within the party ranks. Lüninck's limited success in tackling the agrarian crisis only served to embolden Schlange and his supporters - the victory of his faction within the DkP was only a matter of time.\n\nHowever, for the entrenched establishment of the Conservative Party, the victory of the “Bauernflügel” marks a seismic shift away from rational governance towards a populist trajectory. With Schlange assuming co-chairmanship, the era dominated by traditional elites, Junkers, and bureaucratic influence within the DkP draws to a close, making way for the ascendancy of the right-wing populist agrarian faction.

 gerswr.99.t: "Death of Kuno von Westarp"
 gerswr.99.d: "Today, Germany mourns the passing of Kuno von Westarp, long-time leader of the Conservative Party, who peacefully died at the age of 81. Though retaining the title of First Chairman until his death, Westarp assumed a subordinate role ever since the chairman elections of 1939, dedicating himself mostly to scholarly pursuits, most recently a comprehensive volume on conservative politics during the Wilhelmine Era.\n\nThe political legacy of the old-conservative titan is legendary. Defamed by his opponents as an archetypical Junker who adopted a pragmatic disguise after the introduction of the March Constitution to preserve the Conservatives' standing, Westarp was in fact a quite complex figure. Born into a modest family of rural gentry, without vast estates to his name, Westarp ascended the political ladder through sheer diligence and merit within the civil service, avoiding traditional avenues of power, wealth, or familial connections. Thus, unlike his genuine Junker colleagues, his convictions stemmed not from agrarian lobby interests but from an intrinsic loyalty to the monarchy and the Prussian civil service.\n\nAlthough Westarp's allegiance to such old-fashioned ideals meant that he was never able to detach himself from the 19th century's Bismarckian mindset, his guidance ensured the Conservative Party's survival at pivotal moments in recent history. Under the banner of "Applied Conservatism," he revitalised the party, bringing it to the forefront of politics again and dominating the landscape throughout the 1920s and 1930s. Initially sceptical of the Black-White-Red coalition, Westarp eventually found his role within the "new" Germany that has arisen throughout the last decade - primarily as an internal opponent to the national revolutionary ideas of Hassell and his associates.\n\nRegardless of one's personal opinions on Westarp, his enormous mark on conservative ideology during the 1910s, 20s, and 30s is undeniable. But while influential in his time, his way of thinking is now a relic of the past. A new era of conservatism has begun, and only the future will show what will become of Westarp's political legacy."

 gerspd.1.d: "In the streets of Paris, Berlin and New York, the German Empire has always been stereotyped as a country of Junkers and soldiers commanded by the Kaiser like a general commanding his regiment, but that could not be further from the truth. Since the very beginning, the forces of democracy fought against the deeply rooted aristocracy, the interests of reactionary business owners and corporations, the influence of an all-powerful Prussian army, and the machinations of the monarchy. Among the workers, the Social Democratic Party arose and became the most powerful party in the country; from the heterogeneous conflux of German liberalism, a united Liberal People's Party ultimately formed; within the Catholics, a desire and a will to reform the Empire towards inclusion and democracy finally took over.\n\nToday, a union of the democratic forces has vanquished the reactionaries of the conservative-nationalist bloc and the deceitful rise to power of the militarist Schleicher. And it is not led by a weak figurehead appointed by the Kaiser, or a moderate selected from the Liberals or Catholics - no, for the first time in the history of the German Empire, a Social Democrat holds the office of Reichskanzler. Hermann Müller, the leader of the parliamentary group of the SPD, has assumed the position, and will chair a cabinet composed of representatives from all of the members of the Coalition, a partisan government through-and-through. Already, hopes and dreams race in Social Democrat leadership discussions - what reforms will they finally be able to push forth, finally given the means to do so? Has the time come for a Second Parliamentarisation of the Empire?

The defection of the radical wing of the party and the revolutions in France and Russia also required the party to define its stance on these tremendous changes. Thus, in 1922, a national party conference was held in the Silesian town of Liegnitz, where, after several days of deliberation, a new party programme was adopted and remains the primary guide of SPD policy to this day.\n\nThe Liegnitz Programme retains the Marxist fundamentals of the party, such as the concept of class struggle and the eventual transition to socialism, yet is noticeably more vague on their shape and form. It is more accepting of non-proletarian membership, such as agrarians and white-collar workers, and declares that the SPD's medium term priority is a democratic parliamentarian government where workers can express their interests, defend their rights, and grow their class consciousness. Its constitutional goal is to reform the Empire into a fully parliamentarian monarchy - the achievements of the March Constitution must be defended and expanded further, and the people should become the primary source of power in the German Empire.\n\nPractical demands include nationalisation of rail, coal and steel industries, welfare system reform, social housing, cartel busting and civil service reform. In the elections of 1936, SPD candidates campaigned on these programmes, rather than distant goals of constitutional reform, so the Party is under pressure from its voters to keep to their promises..."

As long as these fires get contained, these disagreements over the direction can be accepted, but we should still ensure that nobody splits off and sinks the cabinet.\n\nThis time, it is the Minority Bloc which has gotten into conflict with the rest of the Coalition. The only issue which drew them to the Democratic Union is the defence of minority rights and on both social and economic issues they are very culturally and socially conservative, which was the cause of significant discord between them and the other parties. The conflict briefly flared up in the press before settling down."
 gerspd.6.a: "Calm down!"

 gerspd.7.t: "Tension Between the Coalition and the Left"
 gerspd.7.d: "Unlike our opponents on the right, we rely on parliamentary support to keep our government going, and the heterogeneous nature of our coalition means that conflict between our partners inevitably flares every once in a while. As long as these fires get contained, these disagreements over the direction can be accepted, but we should still ensure that nobody splits off and sinks the cabinet.\n\nThis time, it is the left wing of the SPD which has gotten into conflict with the rest of the Coalition. Active in civic society, distrusting of the monarchist system and supportive of working with the far left, they are hard to bear for more conservative members of the coalition and have thus been challenged. The conflict briefly flared up in the press before settling down."
 gerspd.7.a: "Calm down!"

 gerspd.8.t: "Budget Failure in the Prussian Legislature"
 gerspd.8.d: "It should be no surprise that not everyone is happy with the formation of the first Social Democratic government in German history. Conservative and reactionary politicians are livid, and are searching for any levers of power with which they could topple our cabinet. The solution they found came from Prussia - where, thanks to plural suffrage in the House of Representatives and the aristocratic composition of the House of Lords, they hold an outsized amount of power. In Prussia, they have chosen the path of complete obstruction. One after another, protests against federal legislation have been lodged by the Prussian legislature, and cooperation between these two branches of government has become increasingly difficult, if even possible.\n\nThe final slap in the face came when the Prussian House of Lords suddenly refused to vote on the next year's Prussian budget, and declined any alternate proposals with the same level of vitriol. Outright obstructionism, with the intent of taking down the Prussian government in order to press the pain on the SPD - a very tactless move, but one which is genuinely painful. The federal government still relies on the Prussian administration to execute its laws, and if Prussian civil service is getting furloughed, then the entire government may end up paralysed."
 gerspd.8.a: "This is outright sabotage!"

 gerspd.9.t: "Prussian Rochade"
 gerspd.9.d1: "The failure of the budget in the House of Lords was not kind to the government of Otto Braun — unfortunately, our key ally in the Kingdom of Prussia could not keep his coalition together in the aftermath. A few days after the budget failure, he chose to resign, and his government disbanded.\n\nIn his place, a yet another anti-Social Democratic \"grand coalition\", in the same vein as the nonpartisan government of Siegfried von Roedern, was formed. The independent lawyer and former Minister of Finance in Roedern's government, Johannes Popitz, was invited to head the new government.\n\nPopitz decided to bow to the will of the House of Lords and the new majority in the lower house - so, he has rebuffed all offers of negotiation with the federal government and brutishly refuses to cooperate. A very conservative budget which would deliberately cripple federal government functions may be passed in the future, but for now, government is increasingly becoming paralysed."
 gerspd.9.d2: "Faced with the aggressive resistance of the House of Lords, the government in Prussia, which was already conservative and opposed to the SPD, chose to join along. The Prussian cabinet has been reshuffled and more right-wing conservative politicians have been added to their ranks, all while the Minister-President has announced that they will refuse all offers of negotiation with the federal government for the time being.\n\nA standoff between the federal and Prussian governments, feared ever since the positions of Reichskanzler and Prussian Minister-President were severed from one another, has begun. A very conservative Prussian budget which would deliberately cripple federal government functions may be passed in the future, but for now, government is increasingly becoming paralysed."
 gerspd.9.a: "Not good..."

 gerspd.10.t: "Meeting in Berlin"
 gerspd.10.d: "A partially secret meeting between numerous influential figures of the right has been held in Berlin, where the reforms by the Müller cabinet and the recent political realignment in the Prussian legislature were being discussed. In a surprising show of unity ever since their failure to topple either Kurt von Schleicher or the democratic coalition in 1936, the meeting was organised by the chairmen of the DkP and DVLP — Kuno von Westarp and Ulrich von Hassell. They were joined by their contact in the Prussian House of Lords — Otto II zu Salm-Horstmar, a long known sympathiser of Hassell's far-right movement.\n\nHeinrich Class, representing the Pan-German League, Adolf von Trotha from the Navy League, and Tilo von Wilmowsky, a conservative well acquainted with several interest groups, were also present. The discussions centred around the SPD-led government and its future — all attendees agreed that the Social Democratic agenda will lead to syndicalism, mob rule, economic collapse, decay of moral values, so on and so forth.\n\nThough nothing specific came out of the meeting — yet — all attendees guaranteed their support to the rebellion of the Prussian legislature, and vowed to \"see the downfall of the cabinet of Müller, and the ascension of a responsible government from the National Opposition, by all means necessary\"."
 gerspd.10.a: "Not good..."

 gerspd.11.t: "Carl Severing Points Out Inefficiency"
 gerspd.11.d: "Months pass, and the political struggles that marked the year after the Berlin stock market crash still have not died down. The slowness of reform and the constant necessity of compromise with conservative politics continue to frustrate the support base of the Social Democratic Party — though few believed that Müller and the rest of the cabinet could swipe a magic wand and bring forth an equitable social order in a single day, they were hardly expecting such a struggle, either.\n\nSecretary of the Interior, Carl Severing, has recently stoked the flames in German society significantly. Tasked to reform the federal and Prussian administrations to ease the enforcement of social and political reforms, Severing has called out the perceived reactionary tendencies in the Prussian civil service — a historically signficant, respected, and very powerful institution. They obstruct the passing and enforcement of reforms with the intent of sabotaging the first Social Democratic government.\n\nNeedless to say, the political right has not taken these criticisms well. Numerous attacks against Severing and the Müller government were published in the Kreuzzeitung, the influential newspaper of the Prussian upper class, in which the impartiality and perfection of the civil service system was defended and the SPD attacked for its intentions to \"politicise the civil servants in order to enforce a dictatorship of the working class\"."
 gerspd.11.a: "We must review the bureaucracy."
 # https://www.jstor.org/stable/4284896

 gerspd.12.t: "Unhappy Prussian Zentrum"
 gerspd.12.d: "It is not just the conservatives who found themselves offended by Carl Severing's criticism of the civil service system — the Prussian wing of Zentrum has tabled a complaint about the statements as well. Dominated by arch-conservatives and aristocrats such as the former Interior Minister of Prussia Franz von Papen, the Catholic politicians see the Prussian civil service system as a tool with which to prevent a \"liberal and socialist takeover\", a devil they know and prefer to the disgusting radicalism of the SPD - at least, from their point of view.\n\nBeing a heterogeneous party of all Catholics, Zentrum has to include such politicians in their ranks as well - and though such criticism of coalition policy needs to be punished, perhaps we can let this mud-slinging from a few irrelevant reactionaries slide?"
 gerspd.12.a: "Demand our Zentrum allies to restrain their peers."
 gerspd.12.b: "Let it slide."

 gerspd.13.t: "The Party is Disappointed"
 gerspd.13.d: "Conservative newspapers quickly picked up von Papen's statements and published them in bold letters on their front pages, loudly declaring that the coalition is in trouble and that Severing's \"disgusting attacks on the pride of German society, its civil servants\" are in the minority. This is agitating the left wing of the coalition - the SPD and the liberals, to whom reform of the civil service is a necessary move in order to democratise the Empire from the very roots.\n\nPetitions from party members are arriving to the office of Reichskanzler Müller, demanding him to not waver to the pressure - they often carry an accusative tone, fearful that the Party is being all words and no talk. We will need to spend additional effort to convince our membership that this is merely a fluke."
 gerspd.13.a: "Bastards!"

 gerspd.14.t: "The Constitutional Review Committee"
 gerspd.14.d: "After initial discussions on the direction of the government's envisioned constitutional reforms, a committee of law experts and members of the Reichstag has been established with the task of drafting constitutional amendents for a thorough reform to the Bismarckian Constitution. The SPD had campaigned on constitutional reform for years, claiming that the March Reforms were incomplete and more work needs to be done to establish a truly parliamentarian monarchy. Anxiety over the fragility of our democratic government has played a role as well - the fear that we may be replaced by conservatives after any wrong turn means that the Reichskanzler and his Secretaries wish to leave as large of a mark as possible.\n\nThe talented academic and legal expert Carlo Schmid has been appointed as the chairman of the Constitutional Review Committee. Throughout the next few years, it will review each article of the Constitutions as well as historical examples of their practical use, and present recommendations to the Reichstag based on their analysis. Of course, it will also try to figure out how to best implement progressive reforms such as women's suffrage, proportional representation, and greater federal power over the states..."
 gerspd.14.a: "Finally, the Empire will become truly democratic."

 gerspd.15.t: "Cabinet Meeting on the Prussia Question"
 gerspd.15.d: "An extraordinary meeting of the Reichskanzler and his Secretaries, as well as representatives of all parties represented in the Demokratische Union, has been held, in which the budget failure in the Prussian legislature was the main topic of discussion. A few options were considered. Briefly, the possibility of Reichsexekution was brought up - however, though Prussia's uncooperation with the federal government certainly fulfills the requirements, it is considered too extreme to ever be pulled off. How could the Prussian Army choose to overthrow its own government? Instead, the Cabinet came to the conclusion that they must negotiate.\n\nThere are a few avenues to make Prussia bend without a violent rupture. The anti-Social Democratic coalition in the House of Representatives is not solid - it is composed of several different interests, and some may be more willing to negotiate with us than others. We could also find helpful allies in the Prussian government, who could do the negotiating for us..."
 gerspd.15.a: "Let us review our options..."

 gerspd.16.t: "Schleicher Agrees"
 gerspd.16.d: "After his downfall, the former Reichskanzler, Kurt von Schleicher, went into temporary retirement - his health issues had caught up with him after the most intense months of his life, and this would also allow the runaway emotions to settle down. However, he could not say no to an opportunity to claw back to power through cooperation with the SPD. Both him and the Social Democrats have some things in common - opposition to the old conservative establishment, for one - and thanks to his personal connections and prestige, Schleicher would have a far easier time getting appointed Reichskanzler than any appointee from the Demokratische Union.\n\nThough he has agreed to the pact, it has raised some concern within the Reichstag - Schleicher will not be easy to control, and who knows what his intentions may be? Regardless, he may prove to be a valuable ally in the battle for Prussia."
 gerspd.16.a: "Naturally, the Demokratische Union in Prussia will back our new ally."

 gerspd.17.t: "Schleicher Appointed"
 gerspd.17.d: "With the backing of the Demokratische Union, Kurt von Schleicher made a challenge for the office of Minister-President of Prussia - and after leveraging some support from the representatives and the House of Lords, he gathered enough influence that Wilhelm II, as King of Prussia, officially appointed him. A welcome victory - Schleicher will immediately start helping us in our negotiations with the parliamentary factions and the lords."
 gerspd.17.a: "He will be useful to us."

 gerspd.18.t: "Schleicher Denied"
 gerspd.18.d: "With the backing of the Demokratische Union, Kurt von Schleicher made a challenge for the office of Minister-President of Prussia -  however, he does not find any support beyond the SPD and other reformists, which means that his challenge ultimately falls flat. Or does it? Now that Schleicher's entrance has caused chaos in the House of Representatives, the Prussian government appears weak, and enough pressure could trigger a snap election, which may go to our favour..."
 gerspd.18.a: "Just a brief setback."

 gerspd.19.t: "New Prussian Election Called"
 gerspd.19.d: "Though we could not force Kurt von Schleicher into the Minister-Presidency, his bid for power has weakened the standing of the current government and, through a handful of defectors, allowed the House of Representatives to call a snap election. After a very chaotic period from 1936 onwards, this was welcomed by many as a breath of fresh air - at the same time, however, they are also aware that this will merely be another battleground for the government and the opposition.\n\nSince 1918, the three-class voting system in Prussia has been replaced by a system of plural voting. This means that though every adult man is given one vote, some have more than one - additional qualifications such as military service, age and political position award them additional votes, ones which favour the elite and the higher classes. Thus, they have a disproportionately large amount of the vote, though nowhere near as much as under the old three-class system. We may have our work cut out for us, if we wish to get a favorable majority in Prussia."
 gerspd.19.a: "Just a brief setback."

 gerspd.20.t: "Agricultural Policy"
 gerspd.20.d: "The vast estates and farmlands of Prussia, especially its eastern provinces, make the agricultural question key to victory in any election in the Kingdom. Now that a snap election has been called, we are required to specify our policy on East Elbian agriculture - after all, Prussia has been hit the hardest by the agricultural crisis of the postwar period, and thousands of voters demand solutions. How will we try to steal the DkP's thunder as the representatives of the interests of the rural peasantry?" # https://www.jstor.org/stable/4545892
 gerspd.20.a: "We should emphasise creation of agricultural cooperatives."
 gerspd.20.b: "Borrow the LVP programme - dissolution of large estates to individual farms."
 gerspd.20.c: "Emphasise welfare for destitute peasants."

 gerspd.21.t: "Fate of the Prussian Settlement Commission"
 gerspd.21.d: "Established in 1886, the Prussian Settlement Commission is a Prussian government commission tasked with the colonisation of Prussia's eastern provinces, on the border with Congress Poland. It has granted land to thousands of German families with the intent of breaking Polish power over the region and Germanising it - however, since 1918, it has been mostly moribund, and the agricultural crisis in East Elbia from the 1930s onwards has hardly brought it any favors either. Even those who support German colonisation of the East have to agree that the Settlement Commission has been counter-productive, as it motivated a Polish defensive response and heightened tensions in the region.\n\nProgressive politicians and, of course, Poles themselves demand its abolition, but Junkers and German peasantry fear that without it, Poles will encroach on German soil - they point to higher Polish birth rates and larger families to claim that Germans will be replaced throughout all of Posen if nothing is done. What will your position be on the Commission during the campaign?"
 gerspd.21.a: "It is an unjust programme which must be abolished."
 gerspd.21.b: "We will stay silent on the issue for now."

 gerspd.22.t: "States' Rights"
 gerspd.22.d: "The fact that this election was called soon after open conflict began between the Prussian and federal governments is not lost to the voters. In fact, the claim that you instigated this election in order to coordinate the Prussian government with the Empire is a major talking point of the right-wing parties. Should we defend ourselves against this rhetoric, or should we make it clear that we indeed desire for Prussia to be more coordinated with the federal government and to put an end to its legislative rebellion?"
 gerspd.22.a: "You know, greater cooperation with the Empire will bring benefits for Prussia..."
 gerspd.22.b: "We will form a democratic government which will defend Prussia's interests."

 gerspd.23.t: "Cooperative Majority"
 gerspd.23.d: "The polls close - and the results show that the Prussian parties of the Demokratische Union have won a majority of the seats in the Prussian House of Representatives. Perfect! Almost immediately, Kurt von Schleicher was appointed Minister-President of Prussia, and will set to helping us put an end to the Prussian budget crisis."
 gerspd.23.a: "Thank goodness."

 gerspd.24.t: "Electoral Defeat"
 gerspd.24.d: "The polls close - and there is little change in the election results. The Demokratische Union was unable to acquire a majority in the Prussian House of Representatives, and so we won't be able to get a cooperative government in Prussia this way."
 gerspd.24.a: "Well, damn, what else?"
 GER_prussia_coalition_number_tt: "The §YDemokratische Union§!: §Y[?GER_Prussia_coalition]§! of 443 seats in the Prussian House of Representatives."

 gerspd.25.t: "Negotiations with Prussian National Liberals"
 gerspd.25.d: "After the unification of the NLP and the FVP into the united Liberal People's Party, the National Liberals effectively disappeared from the political scene on the federal level, aside for a few local candidates who still hold onto their individual constituencies — however, they remain a powerful force on the Prussian level. Here, the more conservative electorate and the greater influence of the wealthy elite thanks to plural voting allows them to carve out a reasonably sized parliamentary group, which cooperates with the DkP and participated in Siegfried von Roedern's anti-SPD \"grand coalition\" government in the past.\n\nThat does not mean that they cannot be negotiated with, however - especially as the business interests that support the NLP are likely anxious at the Prussian legislature's terroristic actions and would much rather prefer a cooperative attitude that keeps the markets stable. Of course, this also means that we will have to make promises to industry and businesses if we wish to sway them."
 gerspd.25.a: "We will be generous with our promises."
 gerspd.25.b: "Negotiate as equal partners."

 gerspd.26.t: "Negotiation Success"
 gerspd.26.d: "After negotiations, the National Liberals in Prussia accepted our offer and will now cooperate with us in passing a new Prussian budget."
 gerspd.26.a: "Great success!"

 gerspd.27.t: "Negotiation Failure"
 gerspd.27.d: "After repeated negotiations, it has become clear that no agreement can be found with the National Liberals in Prussia. We will have to cut our losses and abandon our attempts to sway their parliamentary group."
 gerspd.27.a: "Verdammt!"

 gerspd.28.t: "Negotiations with the Agriculture Lobby"
 gerspd.28.d: "Agrarian organisations such as the Landbund and Association of the German Farmers Associations hold considerable sway over members of both houses of the Prussian legislature - and though some, especially the Landbund, are fairly reactionary, their single-minded focus on the interests of the farmers means that we can find agreement with them, should we offer generous support to their support base. The VdB, led by Zentrum politician Andreas Hermes, will be particularly helpful in seeing an agremeent through, though we will still need to make promises and offer assurances."
 gerspd.28.a: "We will seek to appease the agrarians."
 gerspd.28.b: "We will negotiate as equals."

 gerspd.29.t: "Negotiation Success"
 gerspd.29.d: "After negotiations, the agriculture lobby in Prussia accepted our offer and will now cooperate with us in passing a new Prussian budget."
 gerspd.29.a: "Great success!"

 gerspd.30.t: "Negotiation Failure"
 gerspd.30.d: "After repeated negotiations, it has become clear that no agreement can be found with the agriculture lobby in Prussia. We will have to cut our losses and abandon our attempts to sway them."
 gerspd.30.a: "Verdammt!"

 gerspd.31.t: "Prussian House Boycott"
 gerspd.31.d: "With lacking other option, Otto Braun, the leader of the Prussian wing of the SPD, has proposed a radical weapon to force the House of Lords and the conservative government in Prussia to negotiate. All of the MPs who belong to coalition parties will be instructed to boycott all sessions of the House of Representatives - through abstentions, sick leaves and other events among the conservative deputies, this will cause the House to consistently fail quorum and paralyse governance. We would continue this boycott until the House of Lords and Minister-President begin negotiations with us.\n\nHowever, unless we get a critical mass of deputies to sign up, this is likely to fail."
 gerspd.31.a: "We will pull out all the stops."
 gerspd.31.b: "We will keep this boycott restrained and still vote on essential bills."

 gerspd.32.t: "Successful Boycott"
 gerspd.32.d: "The boycott went well - numerous important legislation was blocked because the session was lacking quorum, and the Prussian electorate is blaming the conservatives for having instigated this conflict in the first place. This should encourage them to renew negotiations with us."
 gerspd.32.a: "Great success!"

 gerspd.33.t: "Boycott Failure"
 gerspd.33.d: "In spite of a promising start, the boycott of the Prussian House failed to gather the critical mass necessary to fail quorum. We will have to cut our losses and abandon this strategy."
 gerspd.33.a: "Verdammt!"

 gerspd.34.t: "Recruiting Konrad Adenauer"
 gerspd.34.d: "Though the House of Lords may be haven for the reactionaries, we do have a few of our men in there. One of them is Konrad Adenauer, Mayor of Cologne since 1917 - and, due to a clause in the Prussian Constitution, also a member of the Prussian House of Lords. In the Zentrum, he is a known entity, somewhat connected to Stegerwald and no friend of the left, yet close to us due to his bitter hatred towards Prussianism.\n\nHe is willing to use his presence in the House of Lords to negotiate for us and bend peers to our favour - however, he needs us to guarantee some promises which he can propose to the lords in order to sway them."
 gerspd.34.a: "We will give Adenauer as much support as he needs."
 gerspd.34.b: "We will simply allow him to do his work."

 gerspd.35.t: "Successful Negotiations"
 gerspd.35.d: "Adenauer was successfully able to negotiate some power brokers in the House of Lords into reconsidering their position. This should encourage them to renew negotiations with us."
 gerspd.35.a: "Great success!"

 gerspd.36.t: "Negotiation Failure"
 gerspd.36.d: "In spite of a promising start, Adenauer was simply unable to convince any major members of the House of Lords to reconsider their position. We will have to cut our losses and abandon this strategy."
 gerspd.36.a: "Verdammt!"

 gerspd.37.t: "Turning a New Leaf"
 gerspd.37.d: "After some time, and thanks to successful efforts to initiate negotiations from our part, the support for the rebellion in the Prussian legislature has waned, as more and more of its former supporters are now accepting of a compromise. Ultimately, even the reactionaries in the Prussian House of Lords had to accept that the situation was no longer tenable. An ad-hoc committee between Prussian legislators and members of the Reichstag was established, in which an agreement was struck. Prussia will vote on a new, moderate budget, while the Demokratische Union government will reduce Prussia's payments to the Imperial budget somewhat and cut down on their attempts to influence the Prussian civil service.\n\nNot everyone in the SPD is comfortable with this agreement, but a cooperative Prussia is still better than an angry Prussia and a paralysed government."
 gerspd.37.a: "Good work, team!"

 gerspd.38.t: "Kleist-Schmenzin Criticises the Government"
 gerspd.38.d: "Another day, another article hostile towards our government in the Kreuzzeitung, the prestigious newspaper of the Prussian aristocratic elite. This time, one was penned by Ewald von Kleist-Schmenzin, the Oberpräsident of Pomerania and a statesman highly respected by the right. According to Kleist, the government \"abuses the social question\" — though he recognises that certain individuals abuse their power in society and the natural hierarchy which develops within it, neither the SPD nor their coalition can ever hope to represent the needs of the entire nation. They are particularists, whose main interest is not the organic prosperity of the entire social stratum, from the landowner and businessman to the average workers, but merely appeasing the class they represent.\n\nHe is especially hostile towards the liberal representation in the Demokratische Union, as, in his eyes, liberalism represents the \"most disgusting form\" of individualism arisen from the ideals of 1789 which puts the needs of the individual person over their community.\n\nNaturally, he has been endorsed by the DkP and DVLP, two parties which have assumed the title \"National Opposition\" — as a sign of their ambition to represent the \"patriotic\" opposition to the \"unpatriotic\" Social Democratic government."
 gerspd.38.a: "Are they still sore about their loss?"

 gerspd.39.t: "Carlo Mierendorff Raises Concern"
 gerspd.39.d: "An article in the Vorwärts has raised the attention of the Social Democratic leadership. It is penned by Carlo Mierendorff, member of the Reichstag and an up and coming star in the SPD — considered to be the leader of the neo-revisionist wing, steadfast in favour of democratic reform, mass mobilisation and taking the fight to the conservative right.\n\nMore suspicious of the intentions of the so-called \"National Opposition\" than the passive party leadership, he warns that incidents such as discontent among the civil service and the Prussian budgetary crisis are not isolated, but in fact make up a greater whole. Referring back to the era of Bethmann-Hollweg during the Weltkrieg and how he was opposed by a right-wing \"Chancellor Overthrowal Movement\" (Kanzlersturzbewegung), he claims that a similar movement has formed behind all of their backs. The DkP, the DVLP, heavy industry and right-wing associations, they all are uninterested in any kind of cooperative opposition and seek to topple the first SPD government via any means necessary.\n\nMierendorff finished his article by demanding a more proactive attitude by the SPD. They should not assume that the battle for democratic society was won when Schleicher was toppled - no, the fight is merely beginning and they must prepare for it."
 gerspd.39.a: "Interesting... but is this really the case?"
 GER_chancellor_overthrowal_movement_tt: "The Chancellor Overthrowal Movement will stop at no lengths to cause the downfall of our cabinet..."
 GER_schleicher_endorses_brunswick_front_tt: "Kurt von Schleicher's power over the Prussian administrative apparatus will greatly strengthen the Chancellor Overthrowal Movement!"

 gerspd.40.t: "The National Opposition Organises in Brunswick"
 gerspd.40.d: "Surprising and concerning news have reached us from the ideological right. The so-called \"National Opposition\" — DVLP and DkP — have announced their intention to hold a gathering of all right-wing politicians in the Empire in one summit where they will agree on cooperation and a common set of goals, which will certainly include trying to topple our government and put an end to the \"Marxist experiment\" in Germany. Otto Schmidt, one of the DVLP's leading figures and chairman of their parliamentary group, was apparently the initiator of this project, but it was endorsed both by DkP's Kuno von Westarp and DVLP's Ulrich von Hassell. Brunswick was chosen as a symbolic site of victory against a failed revolution in 1936, and also because it is currently run by a right-wing emergency government which will allow the attendees to arrive without restriction.\n\nIt is also believed that this \"National Opposition Front\", wherever it is held, will be attended by representatives from right-wing associations such as the Pan-German League, Landbund and Navy League, as well as the minor right-wing parties - National Liberals, German Socialists and the Völkisch Party, possibly the Guelphs as well. Individual right-wing politicians also intend to attend.\n\nSuch a collection of our enemies cannot mean anything good."
 gerspd.40.a: "We need to watch this closely."

 gerspd.41.t: "Schleicher's Stab in the Back"
 gerspd.41.d: "Shocking news have reached us from the halls of Wilhelmstraße 63 - where Kurt von Schleicher, having seemingly forgotten the fact that he only serves as Minister-President of Prussia due to our support, has declared his endorsement for the impending summit of the National Opposition in Brunswick. According to him, it is \"a welcome forum of discussion for all patriotically-minded politicians\", and, even worse, he announced that he will attend the meeting himself!\n\nThis has put the government of Prussia in a position openly hostile to us, and this will certainly do us no favours."
 gerspd.41.a: "That snake, why did we trust him?!"

 gerspd.42.t: "Schleicher Open to Discussion"
 gerspd.42.d: "During his brief chancellorship, Kurt von Schleicher managed one important change to the political landscape in Germany - he established himself as the Minister-President of Prussia, and though he resigned from the chancellorship, he held onto this post, and now leads a moderate right-wing government slightly less hostile to the Social Democrats than Roedern's government. That's not to say that he is very friendly either, though. Though the rebellion in the Prussian House of Lords was not his doing, he tolerated it and aligned his government with the conservative opposition.\n\nBeing the pragmatic snake that he is, Schleicher is definitely not on the side of the Prussian revolt for ideological reasons. As long as we have something to offer him, he should be possible to convince to join our side."
 gerspd.42.a: "Let's hope the negotiations go well."

 gerspd.43.t: "Accords with the Prussian Government"
 gerspd.43.d: "After secret negotiations, Schleicher agreed to switch sides - he will now support us in our fight against the conservative resistance in the Prussian legislature. This should make negotiations with lobbies and other actions much easier to pull off."
 gerspd.43.a: "He will be useful to us."

 gerspd.44.t: "The Prussian Government Refuses to Cooperate"
 gerspd.44.d: "Unfortunately, negotiations with Schleicher took the wrong turn, and in the end, the Minister-President was not convinced why working with the Demokratische Union would possibly help him. We will have to do without his aid."
 gerspd.44.a: "Just a brief setback."

 gerspd.45.t: "Franz von Papen Will Attend Brunswick"
 gerspd.45.d: "The extreme right of the Zentrum party, made up of Catholic aristocrats who are similar to their Junker peers in demeanor and tone, reactionary Catholic politicians and leading statesmen in federal states who despise any encroachment on their territory, have caused trouble ever since the Demokratische Union came to power. They have protested the government's reforms, and they question the necessity of constitutional reform envisioned by the rest of the coalition - if they could, they would certainly form a coalition with the DkP, yet, until today, them cooperating with the \"National Opposition\" seemed unlikely.\n\nToday, like a thunder in a bright summer day, the news arrived that Franz von Papen, former Interior Minister of Prussia and a leading member of Prussia's Zentrum delegation, has announced he will attend the summit of the right in Brunswick. Well-connected, an aristocrat himself - almost a more personable version of the reactionary Junkers who helped topple Reichskanzler Bethmann back in 1917, such as Oldenburg-Januschau - Papen intends to speak in favour of agrarian interests in the Brunswick summit. It is likely, however, that he will also start to encourage the Zentrum right against the government behind the scenes, and if he succeeds, he could even cause Zentrum to consider departure from the coalition to avoid a party split..."
 gerspd.45.a: "We will need Zentrum to chain him to his estate..."

 gerspd.46.t: "The Brunswick Front"
 gerspd.46.d: "A grand total of 4000 people - most of them ordinary DVLP and DkP members - have attended the conference in Brunswick today, in an event which took almost the entire day. The conference was opened by a sermon from the conservative Protestant priest Bruno Doehring, then was followed by a march of the attendees, an intimidating event led by Ulrich von Hassell, Otto Schmidt, Kuno von Westarp and Alfred Hugenberg, to the conference hall. Behind them were representatives from all of the major conservative parties, as well as a surprisingly large element from the small radical DvP and DSP, who tried to present themselves as equals to the two conservative giants - unsuccessfully. Julius Streicher of the DSP was not allowed to even come near the front row.\n\nIn the conference, the numerous speakers denounced the Social Democratic government and the impending \"bolshevisation\" and \"syndicalisation\" of Germany. Hermann Müller was compared to Alexander Kerensky - supposedly, a doomed socialist head of government who will be overthrown by radical socialist elements unless the National Opposition stops him. All patriotically-minded Germans had to choose whether they support \"the Russian and French way, or the German way\". Yet, there was also some disappointment among the attendees - representation from the heavy industry was very limited, as even the nationalist-sympathetic industrialists such as Thyssen did not attend, worried about repercussions to their enterprises. Tensions within the conference were also noticeable - an attempt to organise a joint lunch ultimately failed.\n\nThe conference was ended with a joint declaration of action. The \"Brunswick Front\" will organise speeches and rally more and more patriotic German elements until the Kaiser finally takes note and removes the despised Social Democratic government at last."
 gerspd.46.a: "Alright, so we're fighting this now!"

 gerspd.47.t: "The LVP Leaves the Coalition"
 gerspd.47.d: "After months of tensions, arguing and internal debates, it appears that the direction of the Demokratische Union government and the interests of the LVP have become completely incompatible. Finding no compromise with the SPD government, the Liberals finally decided to withdraw and declared that they will chart an independent \"third way\" in German politics."
 gerspd.47.a: "Unfortunate."

 gerspd.48.t: "Zentrum Leaves the Coalition"
 gerspd.48.d: "After months of tensions, arguing and internal debates, it appears that the direction of the Demokratische Union government and the interests of Zentrum have become completely incompatible. Finding no compromise with the SPD government, the Catholics finally decided to withdraw and declared that they will chart an independent \"third way\" in German politics."
 gerspd.48.a: "Unfortunate."

 gerspd.49.t: "Agrarians Leave the Coalition"
 gerspd.49.d: "After months of tensions, arguing and internal debates, it appears that the direction of the Demokratische Union government and the interests of the agrarian parties have become completely incompatible. Finding no compromise with the SPD government, the Agrarians finally decided to withdraw and declared that they will prefer a DkP-Zentrum government that more thoroughly defends the interests of the rural worker."
 gerspd.49.a: "Unfortunate."

 gerspd.50.t: "The Minority Bloc Leaves the Coalition"
 gerspd.50.d: "After months of tensions, arguing and internal debates, it appears that the direction of the Demokratische Union government and the interests of the Minority Bloc have become completely incompatible. Finding no compromise with the SPD government, the minority representatives finally decided to withdraw and declared that they will seek to cooperate with a LVP-Zentrum government of the centre instead."
 gerspd.50.a: "Unfortunate."

 gerspd.51.t: "The Left-Wing of the SPD Splits"
 gerspd.51.d: "Having been suppressed and ignored for months on end, the left-wing dissenters within the SPD declared that they have had enough. A founding conference for the Socialist Workers' Party (Sozialistische Arbeiterpartei Deutschlands, or SAPD) has been called, in which 20 thousand founding members, most of them from the left wing of the SPD, the socialist youth, and some from the far-left parties, proclaimed its founding. This has raised shock, horror and confusion among the left - especially as large numbers of the SPD representation in the Reichstag defected to the new party."
 gerspd.51.a: "Unfortunate."

 gerspd.52.t: "The Fall of the First Social Democratic Cabinet"
 gerspd.52.d: "The government has lost its majority in the Reichstag.\n\nFor past cabinets, this would be a heavy yet not insurmountable blow, as they could simply work across the aisle or rely on the support of the monarchy to remain as an apolitical cabinet. The cabinet of Hermann Müller, on the other hand, could not afford such a favour. Having stormed into power as representatives of parliamentary interest and Reichstag power over the monarchy, they thus relied on backing from the legislature since the very beginning. Without it, they have no way of passing their agenda, and government work has stopped to a halt as a result.\n\nBrief discussions on an Enabling Act were quickly shut down - unlike their enemies on the right, the SPD was not willing to sabotage Germany's fragile democracy for power. Since their very inception, it has sought only a legal path to power. Instead, Reichskanzler Müller resigned from his post.\n\nAs German Emperor, Wilhelm II appointed independent liberal bureaucrat and a noted successor to Friedrich Naumann's reformist liberal thought, Rudolf Schwander, as the new Reichskanzler - as the Reichstag remains dominated by progressive forces, he was deemed to be the most reliable option for working with the parliamentarians while also curtailing any of their radical tendencies. A few SPD secretaries remained in Schwander's cabinet, but, for the most part, it is a whole different beast and will not pursue the social democrats' wide economic reforms."
 gerspd.52.a: "Yet, we've shown all of Germany that we can lead the country... and we will return."

 gerspd.53.t: "The Fall of the First Social Democratic Cabinet"
 gerspd.53.d: "Constant conservative resistance in the Reichstag, state parliaments, and the civil service have led to a situation where a continuation of the Müller cabinet has become untenable. As demands for his resignation pile up, Kaiser Wilhelm II, under the advice of his advisors, finally made the choice of removing him from his post. This immediately sparked a brief parliamentary crisis, as the SPD chose to not go out without a fight. Several times, the coalition reapproved the Reichskanzler, only leading to his subsequent removal.\n\nBrief discussions on amending the Constitution to take away the Kaiser's prerogative of dismissal were quickly shut down - with a narrow majority in the Reichstag, it was effectively impossible. Instead, the SPD chose to negotiate.\n\nAs German Emperor, Wilhelm II appointed independent liberal bureaucrat and a noted successor to Friedrich Naumann's reformist liberal thought, Rudolf Schwander, as the new Reichskanzler - as the Reichstag remains dominated by progressive forces, he was deemed to be the most reliable option for working with the parliamentarians while also curtailing any of their radical tendencies. A few SPD secretaries remained in Schwander's cabinet, but, for the most part, it is a whole different beast and will not pursue the social democrats' wide economic reforms."
 gerspd.53.a: "Yet, we've shown all of Germany that we can lead the country... and we will return."

 gerspd.54.t: "The \"Young Turks\" Seize Control!"
 gerspd.54.d: "The first Social Democratic government has been in power for a while now, and yet, little progress in the welfare of the people has been achieved. Instead, this time has been clouded by petty disputes with coalition members and conflicts with the conservatives, to the point where significant numbers of the party's members have had enough of this complacency. A rebellion has begun within the SPD, led by a collection of factions which the newspapers have dubbed \"Young Turks\", a byname for rebellious next generation party leaders who seek to aggressively take control.\n\nThe \"Young Turks\" are heterogeneous, but although they have a radical Marxist element such as Seydewitz and Rosenfeld, the leaders of the resistance to Müller are the so-called neo-revisionist wing, led by Carlo Mierendorff, Theodor Haubach and Kurt Schumacher. After joining forces with resistance within the regional party branches as well as even some moderate figures with personal misgivings towards Müller, such as Braun and Severing, they have pushed Müller to hold an emergency party conference. There, much of the chairman's sub-chairmen and executive offices were replaced and young activists were voted in, all with a determination to put an end to the party's passivity.\n\nAlready, the first worried messages come from our coalition members - fear that the change within will cause a more aggressive and less cooperative SPD are abound."
 gerspd.54.a: "This will make future negotiations with the rest of the coalition... difficult."

 gerspd.55.t: "Departure of the Rightists"
 gerspd.55.d: "The change of leadership within the SPD has alienated several veterans of the party as well as specific groups which had been fine with a more passive and cooperative government attitude. Most notably, this is the position of the Saxon branch of the party — a wide and powerful wing which had managed to form governments in the Kingdom through cooperation with rightist bourgeoisie parties. It is also, notably, more nationalist and rightist than their federal level counterparts, and also play a lot on Saxon particularism, which clashes with the centralist vision of the Wilhelmine Constitution.\n\nFearful that staying in the SPD after the rebellion of the \"Young Turks\" could jeopardise their coalition with the rightist liberals in Saxony, they chose to defect and were joined by a heterogeneous mix of old guard members such as Gustav Noske and \"social nationalists\" like August Winnig. A founding conference established the Old Social Democratic Party of Germany (Alte Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands) as a result - though it was envisioned as a \"moderate wing of the German Social Democracy\", it immediately shifted towards various concepts of proletarian nationalism, which has, perhaps ironically, placed them close to far-right extremists such as Julius Streicher and Gregor Strasser's DSP. It is unlikely that they could displace the SPD, but they will eat into the Social Democrats' Saxon stronghold."
 gerspd.55.a: "Unfortunate."

 gerspd.56.t: "The Second Fall of Schleicher"
 gerspd.56.d: "Kurt von Schleicher's government in Prussia was never truly stable - achieved through his machinations as Reichskanzler, it relied on the goodwill and cooperation of most parties in the Prussian House of Representatives. Applying pressure from above and holding meetings with members of the House thus easily toppled his house of cards. A vote of no confidence removed him from his post and Schleicher was tossed out to the street.\n\nAs King of Prussia, Wilhelm II appointed Jakob Kaiser as the new Minister-President of Prussia. A Zentrum trade unionist somewhat aligned with the Stegerwaldian wing of the party, he was a minister in Schleicher's Prussian government and thus offers a degree of continuity. He has established a broad coalition from the LVP to the DkP, which maintains its distance from the Demokratische Union, but is not hostile to it. As for Schleicher, he has finally been driven to retirement after years of plotting and manipulation in the highest echelons of government."
 gerspd.56.a: "Please don't come back again."

 gerspd.58.t: "The Fall of Papen"
 gerspd.58.d: "Thankfully, it seems that the leaders of Zentrum themselves do not hold Papen in high regard. After internal criticism of the Westphalian aristocrat's plotting, he decided to cut his losses and leave the party outright. A handful of reactionary deputies elected alongside him joined him, but their attempt at a wide reactionary-federalist rebellion were shattered, as the BVP ultimately refused to work with Papen.\n\nAs long as our coalition is not a knife's edge away from losing the majority, we should be fine."
 gerspd.58.a: "Thank God, he won't bother us anymore."

 gerspd.59.t: "The Question of Papen"
 gerspd.59.d: "The chairman of Zentrum, Fritz Schäffer, is no friend of us, and much closer to Papen than he is to us - still, as he somehow ended up in a coalition with us, he followed through with a few of our demands. We have been informed that the Westphalian aristocrat has been reprimanded and will leave the committee of the Brunswick Front - however, our move against him was not taken by the party very well.\n\nIt is possible that they might consider splitting from us even if Papen is no longer active..."
 gerspd.59.a: "Well, at least he won't bother us anymore."

 gerspd.60.t: "Disturbances in the Brunswick Front"
 gerspd.60.d: "The first months after the foundation of the Brunswick Front were filled with enthusiasm, soon, it has increasingly been replaced by cold, hard reality. There is a reason why the German right has always been fractured between numerous small, relatively insignificant parties - their goals and interests differ, as though some merely seek a conservative democracy, others desire a national revolutiion or a restoration of traditional monarchism.\n\nWe are receiving reports that the \"Brunswick Committee\", a collection of right-wing leaders established during the initial meeting in Brunswick and subsequently tasked with the management of the fight against our government, is suffering difficulties in coordination. Consensus on things as simple as joint protests and coalitions on the state level is difficult to find, and the Front has also started to receive criticism from all directions."
 gerspd.60.a: "Is this our chance?"

 gerspd.61.t: "Outbreak of Violence in Berlin"
 gerspd.61.d: "Though the Brunswick Front was founded with a joint plan of action, each of the member parties and individuals interpreted their goals differently. Moderate conservatives only see this as a temporary alliance to put an end to Marxist aspirations and allow the country to return to respectable parliamentarian life as seen before 1936 - whereas their radical counterparts hope that the polarisation between the left and the right will pave the way to a \"national revolution\", putting an end to parliamentary democracy and bringing forth a strongman regime.\n\nOne of believers in such is the German Socialist Party, a minor far-right party led by Julius Streicher and Gregor Strasser, overrepresented among nationalist students and veterans and using this to occasionally cause trouble in the streets. Thanks to their aggressive activism, they were invited to the Brunswick Front - and they have used this opportunity brilliantly, forcing themselves into the papers with harassment, loud protests, antisemitic actions and rallies, while receiving generous funding from the Brunswick Committee.\n\nNow, the final piece in Streicher's plan is put into place. The DSP's rally in Berlin today is unexpectedly violent even by their standards - deliberately so, it seems, as the \"German National Populists\" seek to provoke the counter-protests held by the All-Democratic Front into aggression. The police in Berlin receive reports of the first beatings, broken windows in Jewish shops, and rocks thrown..."
 gerspd.61.a: "This cannot stand! Restore order in Berlin at once!"
 gerspd.61.b: "This cannot stand! Arrest Streicher and Strasser at once!"

 gerspd.62.t: "Breakdown of the \"National Opposition\""
 gerspd.62.d: "The events in Berlin divided the National Opposition. While the DkP was vehemently against any sort of \"childish revolutionary action\", as their leadership put it, the response among the DVLP was more divided. Not very surprisingly, Hugenberg commended the action of the DSP and their DvP affiliates, perhaps with the illusion that he could use this increasing polarisation to position himself as the new leader of the radicalised right and so use the national populist radicals to gain power. Others in the DVLP were unwilling to expel the DSP from the common front, some were sympathetic, yet others were against and took the same position as DkP on the \"misguided radicals\".\n\nUltimately, the rift grew too quickly for the movement's leaders such as Schmidt, Westarp and Hassell to cover it up. Pressured by the moderate conservative wing, the DkP announced their decision to withdraw from the Brunswick Committee, soon joined by many right-wing statesmen who had gotten involved in the alliance of the right. What remains of the united resistance against our government is now unified around the increasingly fragile Fatherland Party."
 gerspd.62.a: "Ha! The fools fight amongst themselves!"

 gerspd.63.t: "Closure of the Brunswick Committee"
 gerspd.63.d: "The Brunswick Committee, established less than a year ago during the meeting of the Brunswick Front, has closed down, as it no longer has the funds or momentum to keep going. Protests and rallies against our government will cease, and the moderate conservatives, such as the DkP, instead offer us a hand of careful cooperation, provided we curtail our party's radical tendencies.\n\nHumiliated by the failed resistance against our government, the German right is shattered. Their moderate wing no longer seeks to topple the first Social Democratic government through any means necessary, whereas the radical right is splintering. The past months reopened old rifts between Hassell and Hugenberg within the DVLP and it is believed that no reconciliation between them is possible. Hassell is sure to blame his Second Chairman for the collapse of the Brunswick Front, which means that a purge, a splinter, and subsequent decline of the radical right is coming soon."
 gerspd.63.a: "There is no country for these old men."

 gerspd.64.t: "Victory of the \"National Opposition\""
 gerspd.64.d: "Though Rudolf Schwander is a far cry from a conservative, the mere fact that their agitation was able to cause the downfall of the first Social Democratic government has greatly motivated the National Opposition. This success even covered up the increasingly growing rifts within the conservative opposition which, after a time, could have caused the conservative opposition to split and break down.\n\nKuno von Westarp and Gottfried Treviranus have spoken in favour of Schwander in the Reichstag, expressing their desire to cooperate much like the old March Coalition days. Schwander is open to such a working relationship as well, even if it means that some of the reforms most important to the SPD will have to be abandoned."
 gerspd.64.a: "Unfortunate."

 gerspd.65.t: "The Prussian House of Representatives Debates Electoral Reform"
 gerspd.65.d: "In 1918, the replacement of the infamous three-class voting system in Prussia with plural voting law was considered a tremendous achievement for progressive politicians, but by 1936, it is no longer enough. Much of the Empire has, by now, adopted universal equal voting, and, no longer satisfied with the achievements from two decades ago, the SPD was the first to demand the establishment of equal suffrage in Prussia in its electoral programme.\n\nNow that resistance to central rule in Prussia has been squashed and the Demokratische Union appears stable, the SPD representatives in the Prussian House of Representatives have presented a proposal for electoral reform to the floor. It will have to not only defeat resistance from the Conservative deputies, but also from the reactionary deputies in the Prussian House of Lords, who will fight back against any perceived threats to their power. Already, their influence was curbed in 1919 with the introduction of professional interest representatives, from the farmer to the artisan to the junker to the industrialist.\n\nWhat proposal will the Social Democrats bring?"
 gerspd.65.a: "We will be thorough. Abolition of the Lords! One man, one vote!"
 gerspd.65.b: "Equal suffrage and proportional representation in the lower house."
 gerspd.65.c: "Simply push for equal suffrage in the lower house."

 gerspd.66.t: "Reform Success"
 gerspd.66.d: "After long and arduous debates, the Prussian legislature finally approved the reform package pushed forward by the Demokratische Union. All inequality in voting law has finally been swept away, and it is anticipated that the next elections to the House of Representatives will see enormous gains for the democratic parties. The Junker elite, the conservative farmers and reactionary businessmen have to cope with yet another defeat, and consider how to reinvent their movements for the new era. Perhaps they will embrace compassionate conservatism, align themselves even closer with agrarian politics, or even, possibly, join forces with the Catholics..."
 gerspd.66.a: "Another victory for Social Democracy."

 gerspd.67.t: "Reforms Moderated Away"
 gerspd.67.d: "Through long and arduous debates, forcing compromise from the Demokratische Union at every junction, the conservatives in Prussia managed to unravel the bill and maintain a lot of their institutional positions. The House of Lords will be maintained and some restrictions, such as disenfranchisement of those reliant on poor support, will be retained - however, equal suffrage will be established in Prussia. In most regards, this is still an accomplishment, although it means that the next generation will have to finish the job."
 gerspd.67.a: "Better than nothing."

 gerspd.68.t: "Reforms Blocked"
 gerspd.68.d: "After long, ceaseless debates, it became clear that the resistance of the reactionary bloc in the House of Lords will not be defeated. Ultimately, the reform proposal was withdrawn. Plural suffrage will be retained for the time being - an unexpected defeat for the Demokratische Union. Still, though the Junkers and the reactionary industrialists may be overjoyed with the defence of their parties' institutional safeguards, the mood in the SPD is that of resolve rather than defeatism. The time is on our side - with each passing year, the old reactionary generation dies out and the power of those remaining weakens. The next generation will pick up the torch and finish the fight in the House of Representatives."
 gerspd.68.a: "Let us hope so."

 gerspd.69.t: "The Rebellion of the Civil Service Ends"
 gerspd.69.d: "Through appeasement of the conservative politicians, civil service reforms, or breakdown of the influence of the reactionary forces in German society, we have finally broken down their resistance to our rule. One after another, major conservative politicians, from the leadership to the DkP to the movers and shakers of the agrarian and industrial interest groups, choose to take on a path of cooperation and waiting, committing to a peaceful transfer of power after elections rather than political sabotage.\n\nThough not everyone will accept our progressive coalition - far-right parties such as the DvP and DSP, or the interest groups such as the Pan-German League, will always continue to spread insidious anti-democratic, anti-parliamentarian and antisemitic propaganda, but they are no threat alone."
 gerspd.69.a: "Good."

 gerspd.70.t: "The Wissell Plan"
 gerspd.70.d: "The first time that Rudolf Wissell and Wichard von Moellendorff, followers of Walther von Rathenau's idea of a rationalised, efficient economy that works for the nation at large rather than profit, the Gemeinwirtschaft, proposed their ideas for the German economy was in 1920, during Wilhelm Solf's term as Reichskanzler — however, they did not gain much traction. Inspired by the wartime control of the German economy and Otto von Bismarck's failed National Economic Council project, they pursued a \"conservative socialism\" of national cartelisation, intensified industrial output, and the reconstruction of the entire economy into a single systematic body, which was too idiosyncratic for the Social Democrats and went too far for the bourgeoisie.\n\nSecretary of Labour Wissell and Manager of K-W Society's Institute for Metal Research Moellendorff are ready to put their plans back on the agenda. According to Moellendorff, the socialisation of the coal and steel industry will be a proof of concept for the total nationalisation of the German economy. A German Mining and Steelworks Commission (Deutsche Bergwerks- und Hüttenkommission) will be established to oversee the two economic sectors and include commissions for implementation of rational production techniques, controlling foreign trade, formulation of long-term development plans, and an Economic Council where worker and employer representatives will advise the government. Though private ownership will remain, the capitalists will be treated as regional managers within a vast nationwide system, and will be required to merge into the nationwide cartel."
 gerspd.70.a: "A new economic system for a new century!"

 gerspd.71.t: "Paragraph 175"
 gerspd.71.d: "After the unification of the German Empire, Prussian penal law was adopted as common Imperial penal law — including Paragraph 175, which punishes all acts of male homosexuality with imprisonment and loss of civil rights. Ever since its adoption, this paragraph has been the target of an active public campaign, led by the Scientific-Humanitarian Committee (Wissenschaftlich-humanitäres Komitee), led by Magnus Hirschfeld. In 1897, the SPD first presented a proposal to abolish the Paragraph to the Reichstag, and has consistently fought to legalise homosexuality since. In this struggle, they have been joined by radical socialists and progressive liberals alike, and now that they have gained power and formed a cabinet, the public organisations that campaign for Paragraph 175 abolition once again send a petition to amend penal law.\n\nUnderstandably, not everyone in our coalition will be happy with the proposal to legalise consensual homosexuality. Right-wing members of Zentrum, cooperating with Protestant conservatives, have even fought to expand Paragraph 175, seeking to increase its penalties, ban female homosexuality, and classify certain cases of homosexuality such as prostitution as \"severe cases\". It will take significant pressure and negotiation to bend our partners to support the law - but perhaps it is a price worth paying for?"
 gerspd.71.a: "Surely, our partners will agree to support us if we make concessions..."
 gerspd.71.b: "Let us not poke this bear just yet."

 gerspd.72.t: "Negotiations with the Liberal People's Party"
 gerspd.72.d: "Representatives from the LVP, such as Hugo Preuß, Erich Koch and Otto Geßler, have been invited into the Interfaction Committee to negotiate on terms of their inclusion into the coalition, and thus a restoration of the Demokratische Union which had been fostered by SPD and LVP leadership during the 1936 electoral campaign. It will be a task easier said than done — not only does the LVP both feel scorned and empowered and will certainly impose high terms for their participation (several liberal secretaries and a more moderate economic policy are guaranteed), but far from everyone in the LVP is enthusiastic to cooperate with us in the first place.\n\nFormer National Liberals who joined forces with their left-wing counterparts in 1929 and represent the interests of business, especially the \"pragmatic\" followers of the late Gustav Stresemann, believe that working with the SPD will lead to the marginalisation of liberal ideology and turn the LVP into a bourgeois appendage of Social Democracy. If we wish to convince them to join forces with us, we will need to remind them of the alternative - the far-right alliance of DkP and DVLP, which would surely take power if our cabinet falls."
 gerspd.72.a: "Simply allow the negotiations to proceed normally."
 gerspd.72.b: "We will fearmonger about a right-wing takeover if the LVP does not support us."
 gerspd.72.c: "You are either with us, or you will be crushed! Make your choice!"

 gerspd.73.t: "The LVP Accepts"
 gerspd.73.d: "Negotiations with the liberal deputies were fruitful and a coalition agreement was signed. Kaiser Wilhelm II will have to be convinced to fire several secretaries and replace them with liberal appointments, and our cabinet's policies will be adjusted to accommodate liberal interests. The Demokratische Union is restored!"
 gerspd.73.a: "Great!"

 gerspd.74.t: "The LVP Declines"
 gerspd.74.d: "Pressured by the right wing of the party, the LVP ultimately declined our call for progressive unity and stated that they will seek to become a \"third force in German politics, between left and right extremes\". They will not join our coalition - a significant blow to our longevity."
 gerspd.74.a: "Damn it!"

 gerspd.75.t: "The Agrarian Dilemma"
 gerspd.75.d: "Last year, our cabinet was busy fixing the overall economic situation of the Empire, but until now, it was primarily the urban population which has profited from these efforts. The countryside, however, has been struggling for over a decade, and progress by previous cabinets and our current government to alleviate this has been marginal. That needs to change.\n\nThe rightists have long discredited the SPD and their coalition partners, or as Count Westarp of the DkP would say, \"the mortal enemies of German agriculture and their appendages\", as socialist robber barons hell-bent on driving a wedge between small-scale farmers and Junkers in the agrarian unity front and depriving the humble property owner of his last remaining savings.\n\nAs long as conservative sway in many rural regions is still uncontested, many peasants will blindly believe these audacious accusations - thus, we need to set up an agrarian programme that will be able to convince the common peasant otherwise. The Agricultural Secretariat will work out various reforms in accordance with the vision of all our coalition partners to herald a new era in the countryside!"
 gerspd.75.a: "Für die Volksherrschaft auf dem Dorfe!"

 gerspd.76.t: "Free Peasant on Free Soil"
 gerspd.76.d: "For decades, a social democratic agricultural programme had been an oxymoron. The early SPD had primarily perceived itself as a representation of the urban proletariat, and decried the peasantry as \"the foster child of the state\". The only vaguely defined goal was the eventual socialisation of the rural means of production, in the best case in the form of large, cooperative-run estates. After all, Marx himself had prophesied the eventual demise of the small subsistence farm and saw the future in mechanised, rationalised and plantation-like large-scale agrarian enterprises.\n\nOver time, however, wise comrades started to realise that Marx had been misguided. Not the small farm was doomed to die, but the inefficiently-run large Junker estate of the East. Revisionists like Eduard David, Arthur Schulz and Georg von Vollmar started to contest the Orthodox Marxist doctrinaires and developed the concept of democratic agrarian socialism, closely inspired by social liberal notions. Ideas like the partition of large agrarian estates into parcelled out family enterprises, solidarity between worker and farmer and large-scale internal colonisation were rejected by party leaders like Bebel and Kautsky, as it would only guarantee the property ownership of an archaic class threatened with extinction, which was incompatible with party doctrine and the class struggle.\n\nOnly after the war, the voices of reason prevailed. Old hardliners faded into the background as the age of social democratic political practice began under Solf, Erzberger and Brockdorff. Nonetheless, it took almost another decade until the party finally embraced the theories set up more than a generation before them, and yet another until their final implementation under the Demokratische Union government. Hand in hand with compromise-willing bourgeois parties, the SPD has finally dared to build a bridge to the ordinary farmer, curtailed the influence of the big estates and embraced the idea of democratic agrarian socialism. Now, as the free peasant finally stands on his own free soil, another pillar of German democracy has been reinforced against the omnipresent reaction."
 gerspd.76.a: "The future belongs to the freeholding peasant!"

 gerspd.77.t: "Building Bridges Between City and Countryside"
 gerspd.77.d: "German society has always been defined by a huge divide between rural and urban regions. Widespread resentment and enemy images of one another dominate not only everyday social life, but also voting patterns. The economic and agrarian crises reinforced these beliefs, and right-wing parties have long built upon rampant anti-urban notions as a way to expand their electorate. This curse on the German people must be lifted - the supposed irreconcilable differences between city and countryside are merely a myth constructed by entrenched elites to keep the lower classes divided in an effort to reinforce their hegemony. Only unity makes us strong!\n\nThanks to our policymakers, efforts have been undertaken to build bridges between urban and rural areas and alleviate long-standing tensions, because a solution to the agricultural and economic crises is only possible through cooperation, as reflected in our reforms. An upsurge in rural settlers increases the demand for industrial products and strengthens our urban industrial economy. This in turn has a positive impact on the wage level of the workers, who consequently can spend more money on high-quality local agricultural products such as dairy, vegetables, and meat. In the long term, this means a more satisfied, well-fed, and prosperous society, a competitive agricultural sector, and a low unemployment rate.\n\nOf course, it will take a long time before all animosities between rural and urban areas are fully eliminated - despite our fight against speculators, cartels, and profiteers that artificially inflate prices and have long evoked hate between consumers and producers, the wounds are too fresh, and populist phrases of the last few decades run deep. As always, patience is key - one day, a strong common front of farmers and workers might be able to stand up against the ruling elites, and for their interests."
 gerspd.77.a: "Für das arbeitende Volk in Stadt und Land!"

 gerspd.78.t: "Revitalisation of the Vistula Valley"
 gerspd.78.d: "For many of our fellow citizens, West Prussia is an archetypical barren farmland in the middle of nowhere. Everything beyond Danzig, the Pearl of the Baltic Sea, is associated at the very most with romanticised images from the time of the Teutonic Knights. However, West Prussia is much more than that — it is the link between East and West, between the Baltic and Poland, and its lifeline, the Vistula, offers enormous potential for urbanisation. Years of rural exodus must finally be counteracted.\n\nThe hinterland between larger regional centres such as Elbing, Graudenz, Dirschau and Thorn is characterised by countless small villages which, if they grew closer together through settlement measures initiated by us, will form an increasingly urbanised bulwark against creeping Polonisation. Although the province's raw material base is relatively sparse, its agricultural potential, especially for the livestock sector, is enormous. The days of unbridled grain cultivation are over, and in the future the West Prussian farmer should specialise in what the province is widely known for — excellent dairy products and the cultivation of sugar beet.\n\nOf course, industrialisation efforts can't be neglected either. Danzig is famous for its wharves, the Komnick motorworks in Elbing bear an enormous potential for the motorisation of the province, and the iron foundry of Herzfeld & Victorius in Graudenz is the largest of its kind in Northeastern Germany. Nonetheless, employment in the secondary sector is rather sparse compared to other provinces. In the countryside, there must be further rationalisation of distillery enterprises, sugar refineries, and the wood industry. If the port facilities in Danzig are then gradually expanded and the motorway network is extended, nothing will stand in the way of exemplary development anymore. A strengthened West Prussia will lead to a better integration of even more rural Posen and far-flung East Prussia, and improve the overall East Elbian economy."

 gerspd.79.d: "The wide spectrum of different democratic ideologies represented in the Front is understandably difficult to handle at times.

The question of an appointment in the Front's propaganda department has renewed conflict between these two wings - and it is up to us to decide which of them to favour."

 germil.1.t: "Direction of the Military"
 germil.1.d: "It was said long ago that Prussia is an army with a state, and though Germany has advanced beyond this brutish image somewhat, it is no surprise that the Imperial German Army is one of the most influential, and valued, arms of the Empire. The Weltkrieg has given it an aura of invincibility, and though it may be true, the Army is nonetheless mired by issues that may prove to be its Achilles' heel. A vicious interservice rivalry, lacking central coordination and a calcified aristocratic officer corps are just some of the many problems that worry the OHL and the Prussian Ministry of War.\n\nFactions, or cliques, have formed within the Army, each with a different vision. The Reformisten are the followers of the ideas of the late Hans von Seeckt and are represented by the current Chief of Staff, Kurt von Hammerstein-Equord. They envision a centralised, modernised, professional army open to all social strata and employing combined arms mechanised warfare. On the other side of the fence are the Altgardisten, the old establishment who prefer mere streamlining of the existing army structure. Finally, off to the side, Die Fronde, championed by generals such as Joachim von Stülpnagel, wish for a nationalistic, ideologised military fit for a total war that will require the mobilisation of the nation from top to bottom.\n\nThe entrenchment of the Army in politics means that each of the three factions has powerful allies in the Reichstag and a preferred government of choice - now that the dust has settled somewhat, the winners of the political battles of 1936 are free to support their allies in the Army, and shape the military according to their vision."
 germil.1.a: "We are ready."
 GER_military_mechanics_tt: "Our chosen political path will determine the direction of military reform:\n - The Schleicher dictatorship will support §YDie Fronde§!.\n - The Schwarz-Weiß-Rot Coalition will support §Ythe Altgardisten§!.\n - Demokratische Union will support §Ythe Reformisten§!.\n\nThrough §YDecisions§!, you will have to strengthen the grip of your faction of choice by swaying or promoting commanders friendly to your cause. The stronger the grip, the more §YNational Foci§! will become available."

 germil.2.t: "The Reformisten"
 germil.2.d: "In 1924, General Hans von Seeckt was appointed Chief of the German General Staff after many decades of decorated service in the Imperial German Army - and immediately got to work. Seeckt had a fairly radical vision of military reform - he wished to transform the inadequate Heer into an army of the modern age, with separate land, naval and air arms under a singular armed force that answers to a singular ministry of the military, all while the army is transformed into a professional core that employs cutting edge combined arms tactics in order to break through enemy lines, encircle them and destroy them.\n\nHis battles with the establishment and civilian politicians eroded his political capital and he was removed after the crown achievement of his leadership, the independence of the Luftstreitkräfte and establishment of the Secretariat of the Air Force in the Imperial cabinet. His vision still attracts followers, however, and they are called Reformisten, or Reformists. Kurt von Hammerstein-Equord, the current chief of the army, is a follower of these ideas, Walther Reinhardt was one of their inspirations while Ernst Volckheim, Erich von Bonin and Oswald Lutz are their main ideologues, and they also garner support among the veteran rank-and-file.\n\nThough few of them hold democracy in high regard, they have entered an uneasy alliance with the SPD and the parliamentarian reformists - after all, their radical vision requires a radical political look, too, and only the SPD is willing to challenge the old Prussian military establishment."
 germil.2.a: "Modern war requires a modern army."

 germil.3.t: "Abolition of the Federal Armies"
 germil.3.d: "The unification of the German Empire in 1871 was only achieved through thorough compromise with the southern states - one of the concessions made was regarding the militaries of the larger states, Saxony, Bavaria and Württemberg. Instead of being folded into a united \"German Army\", they retained their distinct organisation, officer lists, and even separate ministers of war - though important to the national identities of the Southern states and Saxony, it was also highly despised by reformist army leaders due to causing organisational inefficiency. The Bavarian, Saxon and Württemberger armies fell under the supreme command of the Prussian army in wartime, but were mostly autonomous in peacetime, making uniform army reorganisation difficult.\n\nAfter long negotiations with the Demokratische Union government, a constitutional amendment has finally been passed to put an end to this practice. Certain distinction between former Bavarian, Saxon, Württemberger and Prussian regiments will remain, such as national insignia for some regiments, but all armed forces in the Empire will now answer to one ministry and one general staff."
 germil.3.a: "Let us hope they understand our reasoning in time."
 GER_du_has_majority_tt: "The government has a reformist majority in the Reichstag."

 germil.4.t: "Reichskriegsamt"
 germil.4.d: "Since 1871, Germany has not had a ministry of war - the fact that its army was actually divided into Bavarian, Saxon, Württemberger and Prussian armies meant that each of those states had their own ministries of war, with the last one being the most powerful and serving as the de facto ministry of war of Germany. This hampered military-civilian cooperation and civilian control of the military, to near-disastrous results during the Weltkrieg. The ongoing centralisation of the military has finally put an end to this weakness of the Imperial Army - the Imperial War Office, or Reichskriegsamt, has been established and is now an integral part of the (informal) minister cabinet headed by the Reichskanzler.\n\nAt the same time, an overarching structure unifying the three arms of the German military - land, naval and air - and answering to the Reichskriegsamt has been established. After long discussion over the name, more \"centralist\" names such as the Reichswehr were pushed back in favour of the politically neutral Deutsche Streitkräfte (German Armed Forces)."
 germil.4.a: "A central command is necessary for modern war."

 germil.5.t: "Die Fronde"
 germil.5.d: "The late stages of the Weltkrieg proved that the wars of the future will be nothing like the past - they will require total mobilisation of a state's resources in order to rally the largest military force they possibly and can outlast their opponent. As such, Germany can only win the next war if it follows this principle to the letter. \"Die Fronde\", an antiquated term meaning \"The Revolt\", unites two smaller factions with similar goals - the Psychologists and the Volksarmee. They are hardline militarists of a far-right ideological outlook who seek to improve the \"psychology\" of the German soldier and establish a \"people's army\", a highly nationalistic and ideologised military which encompasses all of German society. Ludwig Beck, Joachim von Stülpnagel and Werner von Blomberg are their main ideologues, while their spiritual \"grandfather\" is General Max Bauer, one of Erich Ludendorff's closest colleagues and the ideologue of his \"Ludendorff Dictatorship\".\n\nThough not all of them are on good terms with Schleicher, his ambitions of transforming the German Empire into an authoritarian regime guided by the army align with Die Fronde. As such, they are natural allies."
 germil.5.a: "All on board for total war!"

 germil.6.t: "The Wehrmacht"
 germil.6.d: "The land, naval and air forces of the German Empire remain separate since 1871 - while the ground force is divided into Bavarian, Saxon, Württemberger and Prussian armies, the navy and the airforce are all-Imperial institutions with their own Secretariats in the Reichskanzler's cabinet. This hampers the interservice cooperation of our army and makes grand strategic planning difficult, as there is no official platform to coordinate the actions of the different branches. This ends today with the establishment of the Imperial Defence Force, or the Wehrmacht - the unified ground forces of the German Empire.\n\nThe supreme command of the Wehrmacht will answer solely to the Kaiser and the Reichskanzler - the ignorant parliamentarians do not deserve to exert any control upon the military. The centralisation of the military is unlikely to be thorough for now, however - the Bavarian, Saxon and Württemberger armies will still remain, as abolishing them would cost a bit too much political capital. Once the war is won, we can finish the job."
 germil.6.a: "A national army for a national Empire!"

 germil.7.t: "The Altgardisten"
 germil.7.d: "Though all commanders and theorists of note in the Heer follow the doctrine of mobility and encirclement, far from all desire to radically reform the system. After all, the Weltkrieg was won by the time tested German army, and now our enemies are even weaker - all that the Heer needs to do is to adapt to certain modern technological developments to maintain its edge. The \"Altgardisten\" (Old Guard) are formed by veteran generals of the Great War, Prussian aristocrats, leaders of the federal armies who are worried that their autonomous structures and traditions might be abolished by their reformist-minded colleagues, and many others - they are not a defined faction, merely a conservative establishment which does not desire to fix what is not broken,\n\nThe Schwarz-Weiß-Rot coalition, seeking to defend the tradition of the German nation from the encroachment of radicals, and who too are supported by the Prussian aristocracy, are their natural allies."
 germil.7.a: "The Imperial Army is the best in the world!"

 gerflavour.1.t: "Behind the Curtain"
 gerflavour.1.d: "A nationwide media frenzy has broken out in the aftermath of the recent market crash; the belief that Germany's golden era is over once and for all is undisputed. Enormous consequences will ensue, economically and politically - some sooner than others.\n\nIn a dimly lit office at the Prussian War Ministry, inside Berlin's deepest political machinations, one man is restlessly drawing up a damage limitation plan: The young and ambitious Minister of War Kurt von Schleicher. For some, Schleicher, who has been in charge of his ministry for roughly four years, is merely a stereotypical “office general”, a diligent pen-pusher without noteworthy frontline experience. Others, however, see him as a “Grey Eminence”, a puppet master of easily controllable statesmen nominally above him - an assumption that is not awfully wrong.\n\nIndeed, Schleicher is among the Empire's most influential men. His political wit, ability to compromise, and enormous sway both on civilian and military affairs have opened him many doors throughout the early 30s, together with his ties to all kinds of influential figures, from trade unionists to the Crown Prince himself. In 1934, he put his influence to use during one of the most severe diplomatic incidents in recent German history, the Lake Lubahn Crisis; during a diplomatic standoff with Russia, he managed to sideline his war hawk opponents in the General Staff and indirectly enforced both the appointment of a Chief of Staff more loyal to his own pragmatic political agenda, as well as the dismissal of Reichskanzler Bernstorff in favour of the easily controllable diplomat Herbert von Dirksen. Consequently, by 1936, Schleicher's sway both on the military and the civilian government is considerable.\n\nBlack Monday, however, threatens that influence. Only the latest of many disasters during Dirksen's 15 months tenure, it has become apparent that the Reichskanzler's days are numbered. Opportunists on the right and left have begun to prepare for the final strike against the ailing establishment; maybe it's time for the biggest schemer of them all to take matters into his own hands, instead of delegating responsibilities to inept puppets."

 gerflavour.2.t: "Legacy of the Kanalrebellen"
 gerflavour.2.d: "After more than three decades, one of Germany's most ambitious and controversial building projects has finally reached its completion. With the last connection piece between Aller and Elbe finished, the Mittelland Canal, Europe's longest artificial inland waterway connection, is open for traffic. Ships loaded with coal and iron in the Ruhr can now reach the industrial centres in Hanover, Brunswick, Brandenburg and Saxony without large detours via the North Sea, and even have access to the far-away markets in East Elbia.\n\nEven though most of the public, including the conservatives, rejoiced with the completion of this prestige project, this most certainly wasn't always the case. Back in 1899, when construcion efforts were initiated by Kaiser Wilhelm II himself, the canal was harshly opposed by the East Elbian junker elite who feared that a connection between Rhine and Elbe would flood rural Prussia with cheap imported grain. Resistance by DkP and the Agrarian League in the Prussian Landtag was so overwhelming that the Kaiser had to drop his ambitious plans for the time being, the resistance of these so-called \"Canal Rebels\" (Kanalrebellen) was one of the first precedents of conservative opposition to the plans of Kaiser and government. By now of course, all of these particularist hardcore protectionists have long passed away and have been replaced by a generation of younger, more compromising conservatives, but nonetheless it is interesting too see how drastically the stance of a selected political party on a certain topic can change over time."
 gerflavour.2.a: "Andere Zeiten, andere Sitten."

 gerflavour.3.t: "The Indochina Debate"
 gerflavour.3.d: "The recent outbreak of the Indochina Revolt has led to heated discussions in the Reichstag on the other side of the globe after a project for direct military intervention in the colony was put on the floor. While most parties agree that an abandonment of the colony is entirely out of question, a stale after-taste remains as one painful question has been raised in the debate: why did Germany expand into the Far East in 1919 in the first place? For the first time in years, it seems as the parliament has come to an agreement for once — namely, that the acquisition of the French colonies outside of Africa has barely had any benefits for Germany.\n\nRepresentatives of the SPD argue that colonialism should serve the purpose of civilisation, which is already hardly the case in Africa, but it most certainly is not in Asia, where corrupt colonial authorities continue the exploitative legacy of the French and, British. Delegates of the Wirtschaftspartei complain the fact that despite Indochina being initially intended as a replacement for far-reaching reparation payments, all it has done in recent years is to burn money en masse, therefore contributing to the economic dilemma Germany finds herself in. Even the DVLP reluctantly admits that the acquisition of Indochina has made Germany vulnerable, as it exposed her on her Eastern flank to the expansionist Japanese, which worsened the so-calle \"Einkreisung\" (encirclement) of Germany on the global stage, just like in the decades prior to the Weltkrieg.\n\nIn the end, Germany is not that different from the French and British empires before the Weltkrieg, and repeats the same mistakes as its predecessors, to the chagrin of the parliamentarians. However, never-ending discussions remained only that, discussions - it will be the task of our brave Schutztruppe in East Asia to put an end to the rebellion as quickly as possible, and a plan to reinforce the forces in the colonies was ultimately adopted by the Reichstag."

 gerflavour.5.t: "Deportees from Germany"
 gerflavour.5.d: "A \"tense trickle\" is how the Parisian press is describing the peculiar event occurring at a checkpoint in the Vosges. Day after day, dozens are crossing the border with only the clothes on their back and whatever they can carry, corralled towards our authorities by Feldgendarmerie companies. These poor wretches are the many glorious leaders of the free workers of Germany, whose only crime was daring to stand up to the Junkers.\n\nWith the Ruhr events at an end, the strikes ruthlessly suppressed, the Imperial authorities ended any pretence of conciliation with proletarian forces within the Empire and went on what can only be described as a campaign of reactionary \"legal\" terror. For now, we are not aware of any deaths: the Kaiser's men were not foolish enough to make more martyrs. However, many prominent voices have already been imprisoned on spurious charges. Some socialist newspapers were shut down, and unions deemed too radical were banned. As for those deemed troublesome but not worth throwing in chains, they have been turned into examples, stripped of their citizenship and deported. These are those now thrown on our doorstep.\n\nOf course, we are happy to welcome them. They might have been made stateless by the German Crown, but the universal workers' federation does not care for such bourgeois notions. The second they step across the border, they are taken into the care of the Secours Populaire, many showing signs of mistreatment, some clearly having gone through a beating. With each new wave, tensions rise further between guards on both sides, with insults, threats, and occasionally improvised projectiles, flying across the border. The situation seems unlikely to spiral out of control, but public opinion is outraged. One day, this flagrant abuse will be avenged, we swear this. In the meantime, these exiles join those already in France, each and every one of them now deathly determined to come back and liberate their homeland."

 gerflavour.6.d: "General Wilhelm Groener, a renown hero of the Weltkrieg, has passed away today in Bornstedt. During the Weltkrieg, his reforms of the military railway system helped the Imperial German Army gain the edge on its Entente rivals, but his cooperation with civilian authorities as head of the Kriegsamt earned him criticism due to cooperation with trade unions and inflammatory comments towards corporate interests, and he was temporarily disgraced. Groener returned to importance in the Army after Ludendorff's fall and became involved in civilian politics, earning a name as not just a capable military commander, but as an able liaison of the Heer's interests in the government and in the Reichstag. His passing is mourned by his peers in the army and by his family."

 gerflavour.7.d: "After the Franco-German war of 1870-1871, the Sedantag was established to celebrate our victory at Sedan, where we captured the last French Emperor Napoleon III and the cream of their army. Originally a holiday to honour the Prussian military, the Sedantag transformed into a celebration of the Reich's foundation, and after the Weltkrieg the humbling of its foes.\n\nIn every town and village from Aachen to Memel, every street is decorated in black, white, and red. Every bell proudly proclaims this day of celebration. Nobles, soldiers and innumerable veterans parade proudly through the streets, cheered by the happy masses.

Even ignoring the problematic geopolitical situation, the coronation was faced with some issues, as the Empire does not actually have a tradition of ceremonial investiture. No German Imperial Crown was ever made and it only exists on paper, only a ceremonial Crown of Wilhelm II does - and neither he nor his predecessor Friedrich III had a coronation. A coronation ceremony was held following Prussian tradition in the capital.\n\nWilhelm III needs to not only fulfil the expectations left behind by his father, but also battle his own less than splendid reputation. He is despised by the left and viewed as a buffoon by the right. However, no matter what one side or another may think of him, they have to accept that he is now their Kaiser."

While the legacy of \"only\" 14 years of rule might seem small compared to his father and grandfather who both ruled Saxe-Meiningen for around half a century, Ernst definitely will not be forgotten, as many of the Duke's beautiful self-painted pictures are already displayed as part of a permanent exhibition at the Lindenau Art Museum in Meiningen."

Lauded by critics as a grand example of the poetic realism genre, the film tells the story of an aging and cynical ex-seafarer named Johnny who spends his retirement as a singing entertainer at a club along the Große Freiheit, a street in Hamburg's famous red-light district St. Pauli. After he promises his dying brother to watch for the latter's girlfriend Gisa after his death and allows the young girl, barely 20 years old, to live in his room as a housemaid, he begins to develop feelings of love for the first time in many years - albeit entirely without Gisa suspecting anything, who in the meantime begins courting a shipyard worker without Johnny's knowledge. Johnny becomes so obsessed with the girl that he goes as far to plan proposing to her and giving up his old unstable life, but just when he bought the rings he finds out about Gisa's secret relationship. Aggrieved, ashamed and disgraced, the old seadog decides to leave his old life behind forever and embarks yet again on a ship that same night, never to return.\n\nThe movie has not only become widely popular because of its deeply melancholic and fatalist storyline, which captures the spirit of the wartime era perfectly, but also due to its fantastic soundtrack - many schlagers featured in the film, like the iconic \"La Paloma\" and \"On the Reeperbahn at Half Past Midnight\", have already become instant classics and are played on record players all over Europe."

Despite his lacking charisma and barely existent political legacy, Friedrich achieved what many German monarchs have dreamt of: he is now officially the longest-reigning sovereign in the 75 years-long history of the German Empire, surpassing even the legendary Wilhelm II by just a few weeks, something that probably makes the \"Eternal Kaiser\" turn in his grave.\n\nThe great insignificance of Prince Friedrich can be attributed not only to the fact that Waldeck is one of Germany's smallest and least populous constituent states, but also to Waldeck's extreme dependency on Prussia. Due to a controversial treaty signed in 1867 as the principality was not able to cover the yearly matricular contributions every member state has to pay, the prince was turned into an irrelevant figurehead, while the internal administration was taken over by the Prussians from nearby Kassel and Hanover. On several occasions, outright dissolution of Waldeck-Pyrmont was on the table, in parts because activists in Bad Pyrmont, who have not much in common with their rulers in Arolsen, called for a unification with the Province of Hanover, but these plans always came to nothing.\n\nIt will be the duty of Friedrich's son, Prince Josias of Waldeck-Pyrmont, to steer the tiny principality through a new era."

 gerflavour.16.d: "Ever since US Congress designated the second Sunday of May as Mother's Day in 1914, as a sign of love and reverence for the mothers of the world, this American tradition has slowly gained traction across the Atlantic. After the end of the Weltkrieg, the Association of German Flower Shop Owners (Verband Deutscher Blumengeschäftsinhaber) took advantage of this as a marketing tactic, promoting the date to raise flower sales in May. The liturgical emphasis of the original vision of the holiday also earned the support of religious conservative groups, who considered it a viable alternative to International Women's Day, initiated by socialist organisations. Movements calling for making it an official holiday earned traction in the German Empire in the 1920s and 1930s.\n\nAlongside business owners, conservative societies, and women's rights activists, the campaign in Germany was also endorsed by völkisch groups, who connected the idea of Mother's Day with their far-right ideal of a loyal childbearing mother who is the future of the Germanic master race. The appointment of Kurt von Schleicher, a patriotic, nationalist Reichskanzler who nevertheless displays a progressive streak, has uplifted the hopes of this activist campaign, and numerous letters have reached Berlin, requesting him to finally make Mother's Day a national holiday.

Though it took a while for the team to confirm that what they saw was not merely contamination, Hahn and Strassmann ultimately coined the term Uranspaltung (uranium fission) to describe the phenomenon.\n\nThis may pave the way to new technology, should the presumably enormous energy released by nuclear fission could be contained and used."

 gerflavour.19.d: "The appointment of Paul Lejeune-Jung as the next chairman of the Mitteleuropa Commission under German initiative is expected to bring benefits to the member states of Mitteleuropa due to greater efficiency of transnational construction projects.

 gerflavour.20.t: "Discovery of the Citric Acid Cycle"
 gerflavour.20.d: "In the newest publication of \"Chemiker-Zeitung über die wichtigsten Gebiete der Chemie und chemischen Industrie\", readers could find an article submitted by Hans Krebs M.D., entitled \"The Role of Citric Acid in Intermediate Metabolism in Animal Tissues\". In it, Krebs presented his newest discovery of a cycle of reactions involving the molecule citric acid, that has proven to be essential in the functioning of all living organisms. The process involves a series of cyclical chemical conversions, and is a vital element of cellular respiration, allowing all organisms to function.\n\nThe author of the paper, Dr. Hans Krebs, is a researcher at the University of Freiburg, known for discovering the Ornithine Cycle in 1932. Using previous work by Albert Imre Szent-Györgyi de Nagyrápolt, who discovered several products and reactions in the cycle, Krebs has presented his discoveries in a succinct fashion.\n\nThis recent discovery has been seen as extremely innovative, and Krebs is already receiving further honours and renown in the scientific world. The achievement has also bolstered the reputation of German scientific circles, and more importantly, the Kaiser-Wilhelm Society."

 gerflavour.21.t: "Vydūnas"
 gerflavour.21.d: "The nominations for the 1940 Nobel Prize in Literature are already reaching the Nobel Prize Committee, and among them is an unexpected name — Wilhelm Storost, more commonly known by the name \"Vydūnas\".\n\nVydūnas is a spiritual leader of the Prussian-Lithuanian community, a member of Theosophist societies, a poet and philosopher, as well as a noted preserver of local traditions, folklore, songs and even their ancient pre-Christian faith, which he has sought to rebuild and redeem. His moral influence among the shrinking Lithuanian-speaking population in East Prussia is unquestioned, and he has even made a name for himself on the other side of the Memelland, in the Kingdom of Lithuania, where his works are read and cited. Of course, he has garnered respect among German intellectuals as well, although his minority status and focus leaves him relatively unknown.\n\nStill, the news were met warmly in Berlin and with joy in Tilsit, and though his victory is not assured at all, merely taking Vydūnas into consideration is a significant accomplishment for the Prussian-Lithuanians. The only point of tension is the possible clash between him and the aristocratic Prussian establishment - a considerable portion of Vydūnas' works is dedicated to the conquest and colonisation of Prussia by the Teutonic Knights, and the destruction of local culture and way of life that this process caused. As not only Prussia, but arguably the Empire itself originates from the territories gained in the Ostsiedlung, this has gotten right-wing press to deride the poet as unpatriotic."

 gerflavour.22.t: "An Endorsement"
 gerflavour.22.d: "Though seemingly besieged from all sides by the conservatives and reactionaries, the Demokratische Union coalition has plenty of supporters as well. Today, a novel, yet not entirely unexpected endorsement came from the Nobel Prize laureate and long time chairman of the Institute of Physics of the Kaiser-Wilhelm Society — Albert von Einstein.\n\nRecognised as one of the greatest minds of the twentieth century thanks to his groundbreaking theories of general and special relativity, Einstein holds great prestige across German high society — and he uses this weight to campaign for political ideals. He is a member of pacifist Bund Neues Vaterland which campaigns for world peace and adherence to international law, has written fondly of socialism and social reform, and supports the creation of a Jewish national homeland in Palestine.\n\nNow, he also openly endorses our government, stating in writing that \"of the parties competing in the Reichstag, the necessity for great social and political reform in the Empire can only be achieved by the SPD\"."

 gerflavour.22.b: "Let us repay in kind to the genius of our age."

 gerflavour.23.t: "The Kaiser's New Groove"
 gerflavour.23.d: "Though much of his power was curbed by the Daily Telegraph Affair, the Parliamentarisation process and the March Reforms to the Constitution, Wilhelm II remained influential in German politics almost until his death. Not through his persona — to the end of his life, he could not fully adapt to parliamentarism — but through his advisors and court, which adapted to the March Reforms by cooperating with the Reichstag to push though candidates preferred to the Kaiser at times when the parliamentarians could not agree. This is how Reichskanzlers such as Posadowsky, Brockdorff-Rantzau and Dirksen could assume power in spite of the composition of the Reichstag, even after the March Reforms.\n\nWilhelm III is an entirely different beast. With a militarist's upbringing, two decades of being adored by the far-right as \"their saviour\", and a self-centred resolution to be this \"saviour of Germany\" in a way that his weak father was not, he came to conflict with the incumbent government since the first days of his reign. His aim - to find a way to topple the SPD and appoint someone he likes, such as Kurt von Schleicher or Elard von Oldenburg-Januschau, as Reichskanzler. Realignments in high politics after the coronation of a new German Emperor are nothing new in the Empire's history - Wilhelm II himself had done much of the same, dismissing Otto von Bismarck soon after his coronation, after all. Still, were the times really the same?"
 gerflavour.23.a: "It is not 1890 anymore, Your Majesty."

 gerflavour.24.t: "The Shattering Defeat"
 gerflavour.24.d: "One of the most tense situations in the history of the Demokratische Union government took place throughout the following few days. From his lodge in Potsdam, Wilhelm III considered several possible options for Reichskanzler — yet, the realisation that they will require the approval of the Reichstag dashed those plans one after another. Faced with renewed challenges from the conservative establishment, all the coalition parties banded together to refuse assent for any Reichskanzler proposed by the Kaiser, sticking to their guns and demanding the incumbent cabinet to be retained.\n\nWilhelm III's offer of a reshuffled government, forming a \"government of experts\", was refused as well. Some thought was given to radical options, such as dissolving the Reichstag entirely - yet, the Kaiser was dissuaded from such moves by his advisors. The mood in the nation increasingly stood in favour of the Reichstag, not the Kaiser, the first demonstrations were beginning to gather in the streets, demanding government independence from the monarch's whims - whereas the tensions between these two levers of power reached the point where an abolition of the monarchy was being occasionally considered in the parliamentary halls.\n\nUltimately, Wilhelm III stood down. No government changes were passed, and, peacefully, the Parliamentarisation process achieved its last and most thorough victory. Precedent has been set that the Reichstag is the ultimate decision making authority in the country, and if it and the Kaiser disagree, it is the Kaiser who has to give way. He may still hold the power to fire the Reichskanzler or any secretary, but, in practice, he cannot wield this power without explicit parliament approval.\n\nThe constitutional monarchy in Germany is by no means perfect, and the Kaiser's influence is still significant. However, by now, it will be increasingly difficult to revert this achievement."

Now that the Second Weltkrieg has passed, the country can once again return to peacetime politics, debates about taxation, social services, education and ethnic policies that were so frequent before the Black Monday incident.

 gerflavour.27.t: "\"The History of Kashubia\" Released"
 gerflavour.27.d: "Aleksander Majkòwsczi — a leading figure in Towarzëstwò Młodokaszëbów (Young Kashubians Association) — has been working to release his project \"The History of Kashubia\" in snippets for the \"Gryf\" newspaper since 1922, and in book form since 1936, in reaction to \"Geschichte der Kaschuben\" by Friedrich Lorentz. As Lorentz's book was perceived as a history of Germanisation in Kashubia, Majkòwsczi decided to highlight Kashubian nationality as Slavic by beginning his book with a short history of Slavic Nationalities. He perceived that Western Slavs, including Pomeranians and Kashubians, were influenced by Western Europe — with German as its main influence, strengthened by Germanisation. It was followed by a geographical overview of Kashubia, its local groups, and the historians of the nation. Later the book presented history from legends: through pagan culture, Polish Rule, the Duchy of Pomerelia under the local Sobiesławice dynasty, Teutonic Rule, renewed Polish Administration and finally Prussian Rule which lasts to present day.\n\nAleksander Majkòwsczi didn't live long enough to see his book published as he passed away earlier this year when it was being printed. A committee was formed, made up of his former colleagues, who decided to publish the book in his name alongside his novel \"Żëcé i przigòdë Remùsa\". Since release, the book was met with harsh criticism from the Right, who call for banning the book, but has been lauded by Kashubian and liberal politicians."

 gerflavour.29.t: "The Constitutional Amendment Vote"
 gerflavour.29.d: "Plans for a reform to the Imperial Constitution have been drafted ever since the formation of the Demokratische Union coalition in 1936 — and now, with the end of the Second Weltkrieg, they may finally be put into place. Though the Kaiser had little to do with it (and is in fact opposed to many of the proposals for the constitutional reform), the term \"Wilhelmine Constitution\" has already begun floating throughout the press and civil society. After all, it would be the crowning achievement of the Wilhelmine Era - it may have begun with the Personal Regiment of the Kaiser and the tyranny of the OHL during the First Weltkrieg, but it ended with a victory for the democratic process and became synonymous with the parliamentarisation of the Empire.\n\nToday, however, is not going to be the day. It turns out that no definite project for constitutional amendment has been drafted by the coalition partners, at least not one they can all agree on, and so debate on constitutional amendment ceased in the Reichstag session as soon as it began. Having campaigned on amendments to the Constitution and the democratisation of the political process, the ruling parties will certainly suffer."

Though adjustments were made to the constitution to ensure more streamlined and democratic rule, key features which the SPD and LVP campaigned on, namely full parliamentarisation of the cabinet, were not included in the final draft. This means that the struggle for democracy in the Empire will have to continue for another generation."

It turns out that an successful negotiation process allowed the SPD to bend all of its coalition partners to accept pretty much all of its demands - the government system has been fully parliamentarised, the powers of the reactionary states have been curtailed, and progressive reforms such as women's suffrage have been passed. Germany has, finally, entered the ranks of modern civilised states."

 gerflavour.33.d: "Encouraged by the government in Berlin, the representatives of the small Thuringian states - Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, Saxe-Meiningen, Saxe-Altenburg, Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, Schwarzburg-Sondershausen, Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt and the two principalities of Reuss - gathered in the city of Weimar to deliberate on the unification of these small monarchies into one Thuringian state. The partition of Thuringia into statelets, each with their own governments and laws, has held back the development and progress of the state for quite some time, and finding a resolution to this division has been on the mind of politicians pursuing centralisation for a while.\n\nAfter some time, and a little pressure from Berlin, a workable agreement has been found - a united Thuringia will be established and Grand Duke Karl August II of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, the largest of the small states, will be crowned Grand Duke of Thuringia. However, the other princes will retain their property and their lineages will be represented in the upper house of the Thuringian Landtag, alongside appointed and elected peers. The lower house will be elected via universal suffrage, and the government will reside in Weimar.\n\nThe Thuringian Constitution has been approved by all state parliaments and the necessary amendments to the Constitution have been approved by the Bundesrat, and so, the Grand Duchy of Thuringia has become a reality."

 gerflavour.34.d: "As the country mobilises fully for yet another Weltkrieg, many in the film industry have volunteered to use their artistic talents for the sake of the German war effort. Among these patriotic volunteers is none other than Marlene Dietrich, the glamorous and beautiful former silent film actress who has visited the frontlines to lift the spirits of those in the trenches.\n\nBorn Marie Magdalene Dietrich on 27 December 1901, she came from an affluent Berliner family and created her name by merging her first two names at 11. With an early background in music, a wrist injury deterred her from a career in the orchestra, and she instead found herself playing minor roles on the silver screen. In 1929, she scored her breakthrough role with the character \"Lola-Lola,\" a cabaret singer, in UFA's production of \"The Blue Angel\" (1930) — directed by Austrian filmmaker Josef von Sternberg. The film's roaring success led von Sternberg and Dietrich to work together for six more films, especially with Dietrich's signature image of a glamorous and mysterious femme fatale. Of her films, Morroco (1930) and Shanghai Express (1932, a film detailing the political turmoil of the Qing Empire), have stood out as true masterpieces. While many of her films were done in the United States, the growing instability of the country — led her to return back to Germany by 1936.\n\nWith the war now in full swing, Dietrich has taken to the airwaves with her rendition of the popular love song \"Lili Marleen.\" The government has commended her for her efforts in mobilising the German war effort and her songs are becoming favorites from soldiers on both sides of the Weltkreig."

The empowered \"permanent opposition\" parties - the SPD and DVLP - gained a large enough share of the vote that another moderate Liberal-Catholic cabinet is no longer possible. In light of the difficult situation, Kurt von Schleicher has been appointed as a unifying figure.\n\nSchleicher is a general of the Heer and the Prussian Minister of War who accumulated impressive influence in the past few years. Pragmatic to the core, he expresses his wish to work with all parties in the Reichstag to combat the crisis, but he does not shy away from his true goal - a stronger, more centralised and militarised Empire."

It was the parliamentary left and centre which benefited from his fall — a reformist government backed by a SPD-led \"Demokratische Union\" coalition acquired a majority in the Reichstag.\n\nHermann Müller, the SPD's co-chairman, has become the first Social Democratic Reichskanzler in Germany's history - and his cabinet promises an ambitious programme of social reform and constitutional changes to transform the Empire into a parliamentary monarchy. These goals will inevitably face the resistance of the conservative establishment, however."

It was the right wing which benefited from his fall — the two conservative parties, the DkP and DVLP, joined into a \"Schwarz-Weiß-Rot\" alliance and acquired a majority in the Reichstag.\n\nEwald von Kleist-Schmenzin, a nonpartisan civil servant and conservative ideologue, was appointed as a compromise between the two conservative titans - forming the first conservative cabinet in Germany since 1924. Their despisal for the reformed constitutional order will certainly lead to attempts to undo the process of Parliamentarisation."

Socialist revolutionaries briefly occupied the city and sent a wave of terror and fear throughout the Empire. Reichskanzler Kurt von Schleicher used the opportunity to present an Enabling Act before the Reichstag — legislation which would allow him to restore order with emergency powers.\n\nFearful of a revolution, the parliamentarians approved the Act — even if, in the long term, it might be a mistake. Schleicher is now almost unassailable — it is likely that he will use the opportunity to begin reshaping Germany into a centralised, militarised \"New State\" and consolidate the control of his military clique."

For two decades, they had hoped to bring a \"conservative revolution\" to Germany, even by allying with the moderate right, yet even the aftermath of the greatest crisis in German economic history was not enough to propel them to power. Many of the DVLP's financial backers pulled out, recognising that their money is being thrown into a giant hole. Old enmities from a decade ago resurfaced - Alfred Hugenberg proclaimed a challenge to the chairman of the party, Ulrich von Hassell, yet again.\n\nHugenberg's aggressive Reactionary faction, even more antisemitic and anti-parliamentary than their rivals, attempted to topple Hassell in a party conference, yet failed, and thus chose another path - splitting off. Over the year, the DVLP began to disintegrate - Hugenberg's faction formed the Deutschnationale Reichspartei (German National State Party), whereas a few other ambitious figures in the local branches either defected to the radical far-right such as the DvP and DSP, switched to the Conservatives, became independent, or even formed their own doomed right-wing parties. The fragile unity of the German far right has ended - infighting dominates the radical current once more, much like it had before the Weltkrieg."

While Hindenburg, who died three years ago, is almost universally revered as a master tactician and saviour of Germany in its darkest hour to this day, Ludendorff's legacy is far more controversial. His military ability is unquestioned, yet he is seen as the puppetmaster of the authoritarian military regime that took control of Germany by the end of the Weltkrieg. In 1920, trying to stop the Parliamentarisation process, he attempted to threaten Wilhelm II one last time, yet as his services were no longer necessary, and his superior Hindenburg made a deal with the parliamentary reformists to keep the power of the Army untouched, Ludendorff was forced to resign in disgrace.\n\nSince then, he remained a looming shadow over the German far right, yet even those who revered him began having second thoughts once he got involved with the neopagan völkisch fringe under the influence of his wife Mathilde. His eccentric conspiracy theories and dabbling into esotericism ultimately led to him being ignored by far-right politicians who wished to present themselves as respectable. Regardless, he will be given a state funeral, which will be attended by surviving members of his entourage as well as the Royal Family."

Thus, the union professed its support for parliamentary democracy, though with plenty of caveats, although its traditional conservative agenda of rural interests, defence of the monarchy, and German nationalism remained. Not everyone in the government accepted this decision, however.

Many of their civic organisations have been closed due to police investigations, while others chose to disband voluntarily so they could reform into collaborationist groups which try to win over the workers for the government without any socialist ideology behind them. Some leaders of the SPD, finding no recourse, have left the country entirely, claiming that it is no longer safe for their health.\n\nIn these conditions, the government has finally chosen to deal the final blow. Ever since the SPD's temporary ban during the last years of Bismarck, the German right considered the possibility of restoring it, a desperate plan to stop what they deemed Germany's greatest threat, a \"cancer\". Yet, it was deemed infeasible due to the SPD's enormous size and influence - until today. A second Anti-Socialist Law has been imposed, declaring all socialist organisations, including the SPD, disbanded and their reestablishment illegal. The law enforcement services of Prussia and the other German states have been empowered to persecute anyone attempting to breach this law.\n\nThe last outlet for serious opposition to the Conservative Revolution has been broken. Time will tell whether this will truly deal the death blow to Social Democracy which the DNVB government expects... or whether the lack of other avenues to resist an increasingly nepotistic and degenerated regime pushes the next generation towards more radical measures."

It was not the German Empire which won the Second Weltkrieg - but the Republic, proclaimed in the nation's darkest hour after the flight of the Hohenzollerns. The reforms to the Constitution planned before the war were thus adopted into a republican Constitution - one which defines the political structure of the new regime. The office of Reichspräsident has been established to replace the old imperial role, with strengthened powers, but also with a strict balance of powers between him and the Reichstag.

It must still find a way to curtail the power of the military, the ever present concern for any democratic reformist in Germany — as well as rationalise and reform the state makeup of the Empire. One way or another, the dominant position of the Kingdom of Prussia must be weakened, and this giant transformed from a stronghold of reaction into a democratic bulwark.\n\nStill, the victories already earned are exhilarating, and they are already having a change on the party's thinking. Those in the party who still held onto old dreams of a party for the workers by the workers, perhaps even an eventual spontaneous revolution that would bring forth the socialist revolution prophesied by Karl Marx, have been completely marginalised — the past decade has proven that the only way the workers can make gains is through participation in the democratic process.\n\nPerhaps Marxist promises, which are still written in bold in the Liegnitz Programme, were misguided, and the ideas of the young revisionists, the so-called \"Young Turks\", were correct - the true role of the SPD should be that of a defender of the liberal democratic order, a \"people's party\" which pursues social progress solely within the democratic framework? The old guard of the party is still reluctant to abandon Marxism, of course - but, at this point, it appears inevitable."

 gerflavour.46.t: "The All-Christian Party"
 gerflavour.46.d: "The elections since Zentrum's transformation into the Christian People's Party were surprisingly successful for the Catholics — perhaps the voters did not hold the Social Democrats' reforms in that much respect, or perhaps the toll of war made them choose an opposition alternative, or any number of reasons. This victory legitimised the uncertain departure from the Tower which the party initiated immediately after the Weltkrieg — few believed that Protestant farmers and middle-class voters would ever switch to a former Catholic party, but their doubts have been proven wrong.\n\nThe party system in the German Empire is shifting. Once a party of the centre, the CVP may increasingly have to take positions on the right in order to fill in the niche left behind by the dying Protestant conservative parties. The Prussian Protestant voters are more conservative than their peers in the South, after all. What will happen of their progressive wing, as a result? Before the transformation to the CVP, it was their Catholic faith which attached them to Zentrum — but is a general \"Christian democracy\" equally potent in keeping this big tent still standing?\n\nOnly time will tell. Many expect the next few elections to be dominated by the SPD and the CVP, perhaps with minor parties shaking this up by shifting to one coalition partner after another. Then, as new social issues arise, new questions are posed... especially ones which may divide this tent of progressives, conservatives and reactionaries, will it last?"

 gerflavour.47.d: "Long ago, the LVP was founded in order to escape the fate it has now found itself in - a junior partner to either the left or the right, enabling them in order to allow a majority government. Electorally, they simply are not powerful enough to take the reins of the state and thus establish good, practical governance of the centre - what's worse, the shifting political landscape threatens their positions further. After all, the more SPD abandons its Marxist working-class roots, the more they will be able to attract left-leaning middle class voters who traditionally voted for the LVP.\n\nNot all is lost, however. The LVP's niche remains - unlike the SPD or the CVP, it is fully committed to the market economy, albeit with the obvious concessions in the name of social harmony, and that gives it solid backing among the middle and upper class. The longer that the postwar economic boom continues, the longer the prosperity, the more their promises of sound economic management that will continue this miracle become appealing. What is also on their side is... time. Old themes and conflicts will vanish, while new social and political questions will arise - the world will never stop changing.\n\nAnd who knows how that will realign the party system? After all, the LVP is the party for those who don't know who to vote for."

 gerflavour.48.t: "The Agony of German Conservatism"
 gerflavour.48.d: "The government of the Demokratische Union was a nightmare for the German conservatives. The dreams of the reformists and socialists finally became true — and the masses were convinced by their populistic slogans, so, they abandoned the already shrinking conservative electorate. The DVLP suffered internal splits and conflicts in the aftermath of the 1936 election, as Hassell's and Hugenberg's egos clashed once more, while the DkP now had a competitor — the newly established CVP put forth strong competition for the vote of the conservative rural Protestant electorate.\n\nSome leading conservative figures responded with depressive resignation, believing that there was no place left for them in their homeland any longer — but others continued the fight. The DkP will struggle for survival in the post-Wilhelmine Constitution world. Far from all Protestant rural voters will switch to the CVP, but it was hardly a wide electorate in the first place. The DkP's future is thus uncertain.\n\nPerhaps it is finally time to orchestrate the unity of the (Protestant) German right? It was not possible before, but perhaps the remains of the DVLP can be stitched together into something workable once more. Perhaps they can make the \"urban pivot\"? There are quite a few frustrated, dissatisfied petty burghers who voted for the Wirtschaftspartei or the LVP and who could be turned towards reactionary politics. Or perhaps there is no choice but to surrender and merge into the CVP... Whatever choice the future leaders of the DkP make, nobody knows how long the agony of German conservatism will last."

 gerflavour.49.d: "The beginning of the American Civil War has made the acquisition of Coca-Cola syrup difficult — trade with the United States, or what is left of it, has effectively ceased. This has put Coca-Cola Deutschland, the company's rapidly growing subsidiary in the German Empire, in a difficult position — and the entire nation is sure to feel the squeeze as well, as the dark carbonated drink is used not just for civilian consumption, but also as medicine, such as for wounded soldiers.\n\nIn response, the subsidiary decided to figure out an alternative, using ingredients which are only available domestically — fruit juice, sugarbeet sugar, and whey. This resulted in a sweet fruit-flavoured drink of an orange colour. After a brainstorming session, the company's salesmen stumbled upon \"Fantasie\" (Imagination), after one of the company's employees, Max Keith, demanded them to \"use their imagination\". The drink was a success, especially thanks to marketing which described it as a \"local and patriotic alternative\" to existing imported soft drinks. According to a rumour, Coca-Cola Deutschland even sent a box of Fantasie to the Royal Family, and received a positive response."

 gerflavour.50.t: "The Schleicher Constitution"
 gerflavour.50.d: "The Second Weltkrieg has been won. For a second time, the Imperial German Army has vanquished opponents on the West and on the East, and this time enshrined its hegemony over Europe for good. Having led the Empire during its darkest hour, the Reichskanzler, Kurt von Schleicher, thus earned everlasting fame and a place in the pantheon of German heroes - a position he immediately put to use for his advantage. He should not waste his immense political capital - not when his status as a war hero would allow him to finalise the creation of a stronger, more consolidated German Empire without any protest.\n\nA session of the Reichstag has been called, where, thanks to endorsement from much of the political spectrum, Schleicher acquired an enormous majority for constitutional changes - and thus he presented a list of amendments, drafted by a team of jurists led by Carl Schmitt, Hans Luther and Wilhelm von Gayl, which would dramatically restructure the constitutional framework. The Bundesrat was to be abolished at last, replaced by the Ständekammer (Chamber of Estates) - a corporatist upper house composed of representatives from professional organisations. The powers of the states were drastically weakened and the central government assumed a superior position over them, but the civilian cabinets were not free from control, either - an infamous clause was added to the Constitution which effectively allowed the supreme command of the Heer to veto a cabinet member's appointment, thus giving the military an immense amount of control over civilian policy.\n\nThe dreams of the centralisers were achieved at last - the meddling and complaints of the states would now never be able to hold back a powerful central government in Berlin - but at what cost?"

 gerflavour.51.t: "Association for the Promotion of Spiritual Reconstruction Forces"
 gerflavour.51.d: "Alfred Hugenberg, the leading financier of the Fatherland Party and chief of the influential Hugenberg Group, has long been a troublemaker within the German far right, and Schleicher maintained his distance from him, suspicious of \"the Hamster's\" intentions, or his lack of political competence. Now that he has passed away, however, his successor is much more willing to extend a hand to Hugenberg - especially as the businessman and newspaper monopolist has become aware that the National Unity Front dictatorship is the closest that Germany has come to his vision.\n\nAfter negotiations, the Reichskanzler and Hugenberg came to an agreement - the Hugenberg Group will receive the full endorsement of the state and will be financed by a 12-man committee of leading industrialists and government representatives, the so-called \"Association for the Promotion of Spiritual Reconstruction Forces\". This unwieldy name refers to the business association's goal of promoting nationalism, sense of belonging to the Volksgemeinschaft, and spreading propaganda in order to \"reconstruct\" the German national spirit.\n\nOver time, this will mean that the government's message will grow increasingly reactionary, ethno-nationalist and antisemitic. Let's also not forget that this fairly blatant case of corruption is certain to inspire imitators, abuse of the regime's friendly relationship with \"national capitalists\" to enrich themselves... but that is something future generations will have to worry about, not us."
 gerflavour.51.a: "The media will say what we want to hear."

 gerflavour.52.t: "The Ständekammer"
 gerflavour.52.d: "The Bundesrat, established for the North German Confederation to serve as a balance between Prussia and the numerous smaller states who signed up for the unification of Germany, has long been a thorn at the side of every politician and general obsessed with national efficiency. Neither representative nor competent, only serving to hold up necessary legislation in the name of \"state rights\", it has been swept away. Today, the first session of its replacement, the Ständekammer, or Chamber of Estates, has been held. Economist and mayor of Essen Hans Luther was elected as its first chairman.\n\nThe Ständekammer implements the modern ideological thought of corporatism to its fullest. 500 representatives from local governments, the Gewerkschaftsbund and other organisations affiliated with the National Unity Front, and appointments to represent government interests make up the chamber. Division into parliamentary groups or partisan affiliations is banned, but informal groupings of militarists, conservatives and a handful of reformists have already formed.\n\nIn theory, and in propaganda, the Ständekammer should represent the true needs of the German state and work together in the name of this national interest. In practice, it does not work exactly like that - lacking a Syndicalist threat to unify itself around, the dictatorship left behind by Kurt von Schleicher is increasingly degenerating, dipping into nepotism and corruption, and the Ständekammer embodies this shift more than any other institution."
 gerflavour.52.a: "To a new, more efficient age!"

 gerflavour.53.t: "Formation of the Christian People's Party"
 gerflavour.53.d: "The elections of 1936 and the faction conflict in the aftermath proved that Zentrum needs thorough internal reform if it wishes to compete for leadership of the nation in later elections and avoid dying out, pushed at from both sides and no longer able to form a moderate March Coalition. The political landscape of the Empire has changed greatly since 1936 as well, requiring a different approach to parliamentary elections.\n\nFor decades, the debate of \"staying in the tower\" against \"leaving the tower\" has been a headache for Zentrum leaders — some taking the position that Zentrum should reform itself into an all-Christian conservative party and so position itself as the main right-wing alternative to the Left, while others were concerned that abandoning Catholicism would make the party lose its one substantial unifying factor. The trade union wing and the reactionary right were especially interested in \"leaving the tower\", but they were opposed by the progressive wing, to whom a reform into a right-wing conservative party would be a death knell.\n\nNonetheless, the political reality of postwar Germany has made reform to the CVP necessary. A conference of the party was organised in which a new programme was drafted, the gates to Protestant members were opened in full, and a new agenda for the new Christian People's Party (CVP) was adopted. The conference declared that the CVP is \"an interdenominational, Christian democratic party dedicated towards the causes of parliamentary democracy and social market economy\". A new leadership was subsequently elected - mostly a continuation of the former Zentrum party, though with greater Protestant representation as well as greater influence by the Stegerwaldian trade union wing."
 gerflavour.53.a: "Wohlstand für alle! Wählt die CVP!"

 gerflavour.54.t: "New Leadership for a New Party"
 gerflavour.54.d: "The Zentrum conference in 1936 ended with an unhappy compromise — as no faction could claim victory, Adam Stegerwald remained in control of the parliamentary faction while a compromise board composed of representatives from the feuding factions and headed by Hugo Mönnig took control of the party itself. Few were happy with this compromise, and many blamed the indecisiveness of the board for the party's subsequent decline after 1936. Even fewer people expected the compromise board to last after the formation of the CVP.\n\nYet, initially, it seemed like the outcome will not be any different — the trade union, progressive and right-wing factions feuding within Zentrum had not vanished anywhere and were ready to fight out their differences again. Fearing that a prolonged battle for leadership would undo the gains from the party's renewal, Mönnig resigned and recommended an unexpected choice — Konrad Adenauer, Mayor of Cologne since 1917. Though not completely unfamiliar to the national arena — as Mayor of Cologne, he was reserved a seat in the Prussian House of Lords and was thus Zentrum's leading representative there, and he was also an active supporter of \"leaving the tower\" even before 1936 - he lacked the profile of Stegerwald or Joos.\n\nHowever, Adenauer cleverly played off the feuding factions by offering tangible promises to them all. Ideologically, he was closest to the Stegerwald group, but he could also find common ground with the right-wing federalists. The progressives were not entirely opposed to him due to his history of working with the SPD and LVP in the Prussian legislature. Though some were still unhappy with yet another compromise choice, Adenauer was thus elected as the first chairman of a united Christian People's Party."
 gerflavour.54.a: "But he's only a mayor, can he really lead us to victory?"

 gerflavour.55.t: "The Reichskanzler's Resignation"
 gerflavour.55.d: "Mere days after the promulgation of the Schleicher Constitution, Schleicher announced his shocking decision to resign and retire. Though the masses and even the average member of the National Unity Front were surprised, his closest associates could tell that this was a long time coming. For over a decade, Schleicher has battled pernicious anemia, a fatal disease for which an unreliable cure has only recently been developed. As early as 1930, his doctor informed him that severe overexertion could lead to him dying in six months or less. Still, with the best medicine that the German Empire could cover, he endured the sickness until it finally became too much to bear.\n\nThe Schleicher circle will thus be required to continue the National Revolution by themselves - few believe Schleicher has long to live. The decision on who will succeed him may shape the future of the German Empire for decades? Should another candidate from the Heer be appointed and strengthen the regime's grip, through Reichskanzler Ferdinand von Bredow? Or should civilian rule be restored and the National Unity Front be turned into a party for power, led by trustworthy bureaucrats and politicians, through Reichskanzler Carl Friedrich Goerdeler? Or perhaps Schleicher's Vice-Chancellor, if he has one, can calmly continue his directives? Who will be recommended to Kaiser [GER.GetLeader]?"

 gerflavour.56.t: "Kurt von Schleicher Dies"
 gerflavour.56.d: "The greatest Reichskanzler in recent history, Kurt von Schleicher, passed away in his villa in Neubabelsberg, near Potsdam, from late stage pernicious anemia. Schleicher spent the last few months of his life in slow and careful retirement to avoid worsening his disease, meeting with various figures in his villa, starting on his memoirs and going on a few trips with his wife. The government announced mourning on the day of his death and a massive funeral was held in Berlin, attended by the Kaiser, Reichskanzler, all members of the cabinet, numerous representatives of the Heer and the Reichstag as well as hundreds of civilians. General Kurt von Hammerstein-Equord, who cherished his friendship with Schleicher in spite of them falling out, led a toast of 400 officers in Schleicher's honour.\n\nSchleicher did not leave any children — his marriage to his wife Elizabeth, herself the daughter of General Victor von Hennings, was a political one. Her good looks and charm earned the Schleichers admiration in social events and allowed her husband to connect with influential figures, and he himself wrote that he \"needed a certain amount of support from female wisdom and feminine tact in his work\". However, he leaves behind a legacy that will shape the future of Germany for a century or more."

 gerflavour.57.t: "Adam Stegerwald taken into Protective Custody"
 gerflavour.57.d: "According to local media reports, Zentrum leader and former State Secretary for Labour Adam Stegerwald has been taken into protective custody this morning by secret police forces at his home in Cologne. Formerly a key supporter of the \"Red General\", Schleicher and Stegerwald parted ways after the controversial Reichsexekution in Bavaria, which threatened to tear Stegerwald's party apart and forced him to reconsider his stance on the chancellor's course. Insiders describe the endeavour as the climax of a state-planned strategic strike against former leaders of the German trade union movement, with Stegerwald already being the second high-ranking trade unionist to be arrested by Schleicher's regime this week, after the Social Democrat Wilhelm Leuschner.\n\nStegerwald, in his position as a former leading figure of the Christian Trade Unions, had long resisted subordination to Schleicher's National Unity Front and Gewerkschaftsbund, unwilling to relinquish his own wide-ranging influence in the Christian labour movement to the upstart dictator's henchmen. The sudden wave of arrests seems to have broken any remaining resistance to Schleicher within the unions; both Stegerwald's and Leuschner's current whereabouts are unknown. The chairmanship of Zentrum has been temporarily taken over by an interim committee, but the future remains uncertain.\n\nAs his rule becomes more entrenched, the aspiring general slowly begins to show his true colours. More and more politicians of the old, crooked system disappear overnight, and a new order rises on the horizon, pulling inexorably towards the future like a steamroller which only leaves behind a trail of devastation. Those who supported Schleicher just a few years ago for opportunistic reasons might ultimately reconsider their stance - but now, it is too late for remorse."

 gerflavour.63.d: "The fall of the monarchy and the formation of the German Republic shattered the monarchist right-wing, especially as many of their leading figures fled right before our armies turned the war around, or were killed by the syndicalist and Russian forces. Thus, now that peace has been reestablished and normal political procedures may, with some uncertainty, continue, the fragmented and weakened extreme right has failed to reunite and pose a significant challenge to the republican system.\n\nInstead, this challenge had to come from the moderate right. The National Liberals, however weak they were before the war, and the fractured and weakened Conservatives, especially their moderate \"volkskonservative\" wing, found common ground in opposing the Republican system and wishing to democratically challenge it. A convention has been held in Berlin, where several hundred figures attended and proclaimed the establishment of the German People's Party (Deutsche Volkspartei), with a united monarchist platform to come with it. Alongside the expected rhetoric that the Republic is not a system fitting for the German people and proposing an \"enlightened\" parliamentary monarchy instead, the DVP seeks to defend the interests of the middle class and, thanks to influence from former DkP figures, agriculture interests.\n\nIt is, however, expected to remain a secondary force in German politics."

 gerflavour.64.d: "Soon after the formation of the DVP, it was endorsed by numerous former royals, for understandable reasons — hoping for the restoration of the old Wilhelmine Germany, they assumed that their old estates and principalities would be restored as well. Of them, however, the greatest media attention came towards Prince Wilhelm of Prussia.\n\nThe oldest son of (now claimant) Crown Prince Wilhelm, Prince Wilhelm served in the Heer during the Second Weltkrieg, and managed to survive the conflict in spite of a few near brushes with death. Even before the war, he was considered the hope of many monarchists — whereas Wilhelm II was known for his blunders and lack of tact, the Crown Prince for his infidelity and flirting with the far right, the potential \"Wilhelm IV\" is well-educated, modern, and relatively liberal. Now, he chose to openly endorse the DVP and vaguely confirm that should the German people offer him or his family the throne back, even under a strictly parliamentary system, he would accept. This has raised speculation that he could be the DVP's candidate in a future presidential election, once the Constitution of the Republic is promulgated."

As was entirely expected, the DVP has put forward Wilhelm Prinz von Preußen, the grandson of Wilhelm II and eldest son of Crown Prince Wilhelm, as their candidate. The charming war hero prince is already drawing large numbers of conservative, rural and middle-class voters to his camp, raising concern that in spite of his party's weakness compared to the SPD and Catholics, he could actually end up winning the election.\n\nThe President will have to swear an oath to the Constitution, which includes the fundamentals of the republican regime, but there is no telling whether Prince Wilhelm will actually follow the duties of the office.

Since then, he has governed the state in a calm and modest manner, all while the DVP has frantically searched for a way to use this in order to reestablish the monarchy. Working with the SPD was out of the question, but the Catholics, who were ultimately neutral towards the question of government, were more accommodating. A solution was found — restoration of the monarchy through national referendum, which, thanks to the Reichspräsident's high personal popularity and electoral victory, was easily winnable. This referendum would establish a fully parliamentary monarchy which would effectively retain the Republican Constitution, except with a ceremonial monarch at the top.\n\nIt would, ironically, be a loss of power for Wilhelm, as he would have to accept this ceremonial power as opposed to the real power he holds as President of the German Republic.

 gerflavour.69.t: "Pommerland ist abgebrannt"
 gerflavour.69.d: "Last week, the wrath of the Russian forces has reached the outskirts of Farther Pomerania. Here, in the beautiful forests not far away from the endless white beaches along the Baltic Sea, one of the highest concentrations of junker estates in all of Germany can be found, and many of them have been in the hands of the prestigious Kleist family for centuries. News have reached Berlin that yesterday one of the largest & most beautiful of these estates, Gut Schmenzin, the main residence of Reichskanzler Ewald von Kleist, was captured and burned down by marauding Russian soldiers; reportedly, Kleist's elderly mother Lili as well as his older brother Hermann-Conrad, an influential Pomeranian Landbund functionary, were shot when they tried to defend their home.\n\nThe tragic fate of Gut Schmenzin is just one of many in rural East Elbia, which finds itself under firm control of the Russian military. The Reichskanzler remained calm & reserved after being approached by the media for an official statement, just briefly commenting that the Germans have to continue to fight for \"an idea that cannot be described in words, an idea that can only be compellingly exemplified if one is prepared at any time to die for it and to sacrifice everything a man calls his own. He who swears by the Prussian flag no longer has anything that belongs to him - neither property, nor freedom, neither life, nor family.\""

 gerflavour.70.t: "The End of the Temporary Solution"
 gerflavour.70.d: "The Reichskanzler, [GER.GetSecondInCommand], was appointed as the temporary head of government during their cabinet's crisis years ago, and few expected him to get very far - yet, he's subsequently been forced to lead the Empire during a war for survival, the Second Weltkrieg, and eventually came out victorious. The nation cheers its saviour, already compared to the late Otto von Bismarck and Ulrich von Brockdorff-Rantzau, the great Reichskanzlers of the past. Still, he never intended to end up in this position, and now that the dust of war has settled, he will finally be able to give up the reins and retire.\n\nNew elections are slated to be held after the war - and as there is no party which will truly be able to benefit from the Reichskanzler's leadership, it appears that the old moderate consensus of liberals and Catholics will return to dominance. Though somewhat wounded by the authoritarian turn after 1936, and with no reforms done to the outdated Constitution, democracy in the German Empire still stands.\n\nBut for how long? One day, a new generation will grow up, the battles of old will be renewed, and the struggle between liberalism and reaction will restart. Perhaps it will have different leaders and will take a different form, but it is inevitable."

 gerflavour.71.t: "Max Bauer"
 gerflavour.71.d: "A new article submitted to the Militär-Wochenblatt, the magazine of the Heer which has served as the primary publication of the military since 1816. has made rounds among the readership. It was penned by Max Bauer — an infamous officer in the General Staff during the Weltkrieg who later rose to the rank of General, before his retirement. More famously, he was a protege of Erich Ludendorff and considered his right-hand man — much of the so-called \"Ludendorff Dictatorship\" during the Weltkrieg was his initiative, and the near-total mobilisation of the nation during the last years of the Weltkrieg was envisioned by him. As a result, he has become a sort of symbol and respected spiritual predecessor to the officers and generals who desire for the Heer to transition towards total war.\n\nBauer's article, drawing from his Weltkrieg experience, reflects this - he is highly critical of the government's lack of interest in military matters and predicted that the next great war in Europe will be even more total than the last. Such a war can only be won by a complete dedication of the state's entire resource base to war, without hesitation or qualms - there's little illusion that this implies a totalitarian military dictatorship..."

 gerflavour.72.d: "Due to the war, the annual Rhineland carnival celebrations have sadly been called off this year — instead of happily parading through the festively decorated streets of Cologne, Mainz, Aachen, Bonn and Düsseldorf, the carnivalists will spend the so-called \"fifth season\" at the front to defend Germany against her enemies. These colourful festivities have a long tradition on the western side of the Rhine and have always been a symbol of Rhenish patriotism as it was a way to express subversive anti-Prussian and anti-French thoughts in times of occupation, mainly through parody and mockery. Now however, with the artillery fire roaring only a few hundred kilometres away from the large Western German metropolises, even the jolly Rhinelander has fallen under the spell of the militarist Prussian war machine."

 gerflavour.73.t: "All Quiet on the Home Front"
 gerflavour.73.d: "The summer of 1942 is a particularly hot one, and while millions of brave German soldiers are sacrificing their lives for the greater good of Europe, the people at the home front are in search of distraction and light entertainment to cope with the heat and the uncertainty about what will happen to their sons, fathers and brothers at the front. Great places to do so are the many public swimming pools, bathing ponds and sports venues across the country that still draw in thousands of visitors every day, despite the war.\n\nLast Saturday, among these visitors were none others than His Majesty Kaiser Wilhelm III and his wife Duchess Cecilie, who were spotted at a tennis match in the Berlin suburb of Wannsee. Down to earth and close to the people, the couple presented themselves in leisurely summer outfits and with modern sunglasses - definitely a stark contrast to the imperial, almost divine grandeur that the royal family demonstrated to the outside world during the last 50 years under Wilhelm II.\n\nWhile this encounter of the entertaining kind might be worth a short side article in the vast array of German tabloid magazines, it doesn't change the fact that the war is still raging - sometimes, it's the small things in life that can make people forget what really matters."
 gerflavour.73.a: "I see, we are deep in the annual silly season again."

 gerflavour.74.t: "A Winter's Tale"
 gerflavour.74.d: "Peace has returned to Europe for a while now, and uncertainty is looming over the \"victorious\" German Empire. Reconstruction has begun, people are trying to get on with their lives; the victory parades and fairs in the large cities are long over, the flower arrangements that are lying in front of countless graves and war memorials have already begun to wilt, but the trauma of many, many months of war will plague a full generation until the end of their lives, that much is certain. Now, the first winter after the war is approaching, and eternal coldness and darkness begin to descend over the Kaiserreich again.\n\nWhile the Prussian military leadership is desperately trying to prop up their own little puppet regime in Paris as part of their vision for the future of Europe under German hegemony, a lone train is approaching the Franco-German border checkpoint near Étain, where it is stopped in its track by the German border guard. It turns out the train is loaded with former German POWs from a godforsaken camp in the Pyrenees; hundreds of emaciated men with pale faces are forced to unboard the vehicle as grim-looking border officials begin to search their baggage for contraband, illegal literature, and more. Booklets with socialist writings, given out by the French authorities to the German prisoners during their detainment, end up in the muddy snow, and so does the occasional war diary. Everything of worth disappears in the large pockets of the guardsmen's coats.\n\nThe lengthy procedure takes a short eternity, and while the weary passengers silently endure this harassment, cold wind blowing around their ears, the local Grenzmajor sits not too far away in the heated and comfortable border post and listens to the radio. Old speeches of Reichskanzler Schleicher are broadcast on repeat. \"The new European order will finalise our German nationhood; it gives us internal unity, unity in thought and in feelings; it will unite the fragmented continent into a whole, for the world's greater good - we need a united Europe pacified by the German sword to rule our outward and inward dealings!\" The Grenzmajor turns the radio off.\n\nNot long after, the train and its passengers continue their course into the German inland - back home to their small villages, where they will be defamed as deserteurs, cowards, losers. While German democracy slowly succumbs to the military-industrial complex and its henchmen in the government, old memories from a hundred years ago arise in the minds of the people. The new order might give them external unity, a unity that is real and material; the regime however dictates them the unity of spirit - in reality, the most ideal."

 gerflavour.75.t: "Neither sturmfest, nor erdverwachsen"
 gerflavour.75.d: "Prussia is a large realm and rules over many territories whose population is not too fond of their East Elbian overlords. While these opponents of Prussian rule can mostly be found in the distant periphery of the Empire, some of the most ardent regional patriots in fact do not live too far away from the capital — the Lower Saxons, who inhabit the Prussian Province of Hanover, the Duchy of Brunswick, the Principality of Schaumburg-Lippe and the Grand Duchy of Oldenburg. While similar to the Prussians in faith and dialect, they have a strong regional identity that reaches back thousands of years, and the Hanoverians have a deep disdain for the Prussians due to the annexation of their kingdom back in '66, manifested among others in the existence of the Guelph Party (DHP), whose main aim is the restoration of a sovereign Kingdom of Hanover within the Empire.\n\nLower Saxon patriotism however is not confined to the DHP, but also has a strong extra-parliamentary presence, most prominently the Lower Saxon Homeland League. The oldest German regionalist movement, it evokes an even older image of the flat and marshy territories between Elbe and Ems, celebrating the medieval spirit of the Saxon Kingdom that bravely asserted itself against Romans, Franks and Staufers, and embraces illustrious leaders such as Arminius, Duke Widukind and Henry the Lion, famous scientists like Leibniz and Gauß, and acclaimed writers such as Hermann Löns, Wilhelm Busch and Hoffmann von Fallersleben.\n\nHowever, though local patriotism in the far northwest is strong, it never was enough to actively resist Prussian rule, as petty rivalries have plagued the Lower Saxon movement for decades. The official \"Song of the Lower Saxons\" does not even include the lands west of the Weser. A protestant Harzer does not have much in common with a catholic Emslander, and the Oldenburgers are so proud of their Grand Duchy that they keep a certain distance to their \"brethren\" on the other side of the border. Annually, the Homeland League convenes the so-called \"Lower Saxon Day\" to foster local identity and celebrate their \"common\" history, but one thing is certain - as long as the Prussians control most of the region, the Lower Saxons will remain a spiritually divided people."
 gerflavour.75.a: "As long as they squabble, they will remain under the Prussian boot, simple as that!"

 gerflavour.76.t: "The Archduchy of Austria"
 gerflavour.76.d: "Ever since the Prusso-Austrian War of 1866, the German-speaking lands of Austria and Bohemia were fated to be excluded from a united Germany. In spite of this, sympathies for the \"greater Germany solution\" remained on both sides of the border. The black-red-gold flag of the 1848 Revolution inadvertently became one of the symbols of Greater Germany, as opposed to the black-white-red of the German Empire. The Pan-German League in Berlin and Greater German People's Party in Wien kept the idea alive and tried to unite it with their respective far-right - in spite of this, even Social Democratic politicians expressed their sympathies for unification.\n\nNow, it has been achieved, and the dreams of Greater Germany meet cold reality. Austria is the newest addition into the federal structure of the German Empire - its large size, surpassing even Bavaria, means that once the Constitution is amended to include Austria, it will likely receive a large number of Bundesrat votes, perhaps even eight or nine. Already, Prussian politicians are concerned that this will lead to a large Catholic bloc in the Bundesrat that can match Prussia and destabilise law-making in the chamber. The fate of the Austrian army, whether it will be integrated or receive independent status such as their Bavarian counterparts, is also in question, as well as numerous other concessions in economic and political affairs. The negotiations on Austria's integration are not going to be easy.\n\nThe House of Habsburg has been invited to assume the throne of the Archduchy of Austria, thus being required to surrender their imperial status and accept subordination to the Hohenzollerns. Needless to say, this will cause resentment in the family, as well as among the Austrian people. Still, overall, the masses in both Germany and Austria are jubilant."
 gerflavour.76.a: "Deutschösterreich, du herrliches Land, wir lieben dich!"

 gerflavour.77.t: "Reorganisation of the Party System"
 gerflavour.77.d: "Now that Austria is being integrated into the German Empire, the parties of the former Habsburg empire are being absorbed into the German party system, some winning considerably, others losing out.\n\nThe integration of the SDAP into the SPD went without any issues - the two parties had already had a close working relationship for decades, as well as intellectual sharing. After all, both Karl Kautsky and Rudolf Hilferding, who were massively important to the intellectual development of the SPD, came from Austria. Similarly, the CSP began negotiations with Zentrum on unification, but they faced several key issues. Prolonged negotiations on Austria's integration into the Empire, which raised concerns about the loss Austrian identity within Germany, as well as CSP's more conservative outlook meant that the merger was incomplete. Much like the Bavarian People's Party and the Luxembourger Party of the Right, the CSP became an autonomous part of Zentrum - it retained its leadership and freedom of action within Austria, but their Reichstag members (once any are elected) will caucus with Zentrum.\n\nThe GDVP, meanwhile, followed the lead of the Christian-Social Homeland Party of Alsace-Lorraine and became an autonomous part of the DVLP. Again, in spite of ideological similarities, various conflicts bubbling within, as well as DVLP's largely Protestant leadership, meant that the merger was incomplete. The other parties, ultimately, received little - LVP absorbed the minor Demokraten, while the Deutsche Fortschrittspartei stayed around as a minor party in Austria. It is assumed that Zentrum and SPD will benefit the most of the union with Austria - which stings a little to the far-right Pan-Germans who had championed the cause of Greater Germany the most."

 gerflavour.78.t: "Reemtsma-Affäre"
 gerflavour.78.d: "A lengthy investigation by the police of the Kingdom of Prussia and the Reich Treasury has confirmed that Reemtsma, one of the largest cigarette manufacturers in the German Empire, has been using consistent political pressure in order to bypass numerous laws against hostile acquisition of opposing cigarette brands and avoid tobacco taxes in numerous member states of the Empire. The sons of the company's founder, Bernhard, Hermann and Philip Reemtsma, transformed it into an impressively profitable enterprise since his death - it appears that it was done through illicit deeds.\n\nWhat is highly concerning to the Treasury is that this is not the first time that Reemtsma has fallen under suspicion by the federal authorities. An investigation into their tax evasion was first initiated in 1926, but it was discontinued, and a similar investigation in 1932 ended in the same way. Government officials suspect that this too was the result of their political pressure, perhaps connections and friends in high levels of government..."
 gerflavour.78.a: "Continue the investigation. We must know the truth!"

 gerflavour.79.t: "Göring Implicated in the Reemtsma Scandal"
 gerflavour.79.d: "Careful analysis of declared and undeclared income, as well as investigation into the activities of the Reemtsma brothers during the 1931-1932 timeframe, has confirmed that they staved off corruption investigations due to connections with DVLP's Member of the Reichstag Hermann Göring. Göring, a Weltkrieg flying ace, was forced into retirement in 1928 after a series of conflicts with the airforce leadership, his affairs coming to light, and him openly flaunting his support for the far right. The DVLP came to the defence of this \"slandered war hero\" and Göring subsequently ran as their candidate in the 1931 elections, winning the only Bavarian constituency for the party in Nuremberg.\n\nIn the Reichstag, Göring generally stayed in the background, largely irrelevant in the party's activities, but used his new status for personal enrichment. Large donations from Reemtsma allowed him to fund an extravagant lifestyle, acquire a hunting lodge and purchase numerous artworks. In retrospect, it should not have been hard to guess that this \"Goldfasan\" life was financed through bribery.\n\nThe nationwide outrage is enormous, and even Göring's old allies are forced to distance themselves from him. The former ace defended himself to the best of his ability and declared this to be \"Judeo-Marxist slander\", but ultimately chose to resign. The courts will now decide his fate, and they will not be kind."

 gerflavour.80.t: "Our Darkest Hour?"
 gerflavour.80.d: "Deep in the Thuringian hill range of Kyffhäuser, a giant sandstone column rises, decorated with engravings and ornaments, a typical grand monument of the early Wilhelmine Era. The memorial site houses opulent sculptures of two of our greatest recent national icons, Kaiser Wilhelm I \"the Great\", and Paul von Hindenburg, but neither of them can hold a candle to the man whose huge statue is resting on an oversized throne in a stone hollow at the foot of the column: Friedrich I \"Barbarossa\", legendary medieval Emperor and military commander, famous for his demise during the Third Crusade in 1190.\n\nGerman history has produced a plethora of myths and tales, and the Kyffhäuser Legend is certainly among the most famous. An ancient folklore trope, it claims that Barbarossa did not drown in a Cilician river 750 years ago, but that he sleeps in a cave deep under the hills of Kyffhäuser, accompanied by his most loyal knights, eternally waiting for his sole vocation: Awakening from his slumber in Germany's darkest hour to finally leave the cave and \"restore Germany to its ancient greatness\". Legend has it that as long as ravens circle over Kyffhäuser, the old emperor is tied to his throne - only when a magnificent eagle appears and chases the ravens away, Barbarossa is allowed to follow his calling.\n\nAccording to propaganda, the ravens - which on a purely metaphorical level can stand for many things - were driven out a long time ago, and yet the war is going badly for the Empire. Priorities have shifted in the wake of air raids and combat on German soil, and the Kyffhäuser Monument, once a popular tourist attraction, has become a shadow of its former self, abandoned, neglected, forgotten, a depressing memory of former glory. Where once crowds of people enjoyed the view over green treetops, now only a few superstitious locals show up, desperately hoping to catch sight of an eagle high above Barbarossa's statue, a good omen in these times of darkness.\n\nBut all hope is futile. Despite Berlin's best efforts, Germany's situation remains devastating, and yet, the symbolic awakening of the legendary Emperor has not happened. An uneasy premonition arises: What if Germany's darkest hour is still yet to come?"

 gerflavour.81.t: "The New Ostpolitik"
 gerflavour.81.d1: "Until now, German Ostpolitik has relied on two - and only two - goals: to ensure German economic and military interests in Eastern Europe. Domestic politics of the Oststaaten have been of little concern to us, as long as these two goals are being honoured. The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk meant self-determination and freedom for many nations that languished under Russian imperial oppression, and Germany became merely their protector. The years following left the social question in the East unanswered, however - until today.\n\nJust as we have been pushing for democratic reforms at home, the same process seems to be occurring for our Eastern proteges. Reactionary governments have largely been pushed out, whether by legal means or by force. To many, this transformation has marked the victory of the original vision of Mitteleuropa in accordance with the ideas of its spiritual father, Friedrich Naumann. Though deceased for roughly two decades, his idealist vision of a German-dominated bloc not only united by economic and foreign-political interests, but also by its liberal-democratic, pluralistic outlook, has left an enormous mark among the progressive Central European intelligentsia.\n\nGlobally renowned social sciences polymath Max Weber, a close friend of the late Naumann and an important early Mitteleuropa ideologue himself, has reflected on Naumann's political legacy and the fulfilment of the latter's vision with the developments that have recently unfolded themselves in the East in his newest article. His conclusion stresses that Germany's mission in the East has finally expanded to an ideological sphere; Berlin has become the protector of democratic, forward-leaning ideals in the East against harmful, eternally backward-leaning Russian revanchism. Implicitly or explicitly, Ostpolitik has changed - a new European community is being born anew. Perhaps some day, it will inspire something even greater..."
 gerflavour.81.d2: "Until now, the German Ostpolitik has relied on two - and only two - goals: to ensure German economic and military interests in the Eastern Europe. Domestic politics of the Oststaat have been little concern of us, as long as these two goals are being honoured.\n\nFor many on the right, however, this has been shortsighted and potentially dangerous. Without exerting a great deal of control over our client states in the East, including in ideological matters, Germany will never be safe from Syndicalist or Russian intrusion.\n\nThe past few years have seen the transformation of Ostpolitik in this direction. Paul Rohrbach, an early Mitteleuropean thinker and conservative writer, put it best in a recent article. According to Rohrbach, the long term goal of Germany's influence in the east should be to contain Russian aggression. This is best achieved by a united, organic and anti-Russian bloc of states dominated by Germany, much like the one that has come to fruition today.\n\nWhether or not the transformation of Ostpolitik was intentional, it was always meant to be. Where we lead, others will follow."

 gerflavour.82.d: "Though years of service as the Reichskanzler has caused them to become somewhat distant, the new Kaiser, Wilhelm III, remains a friend of Kurt von Schleicher - and now that he has finally assumed his late father's throne, he is certain that this will allow him to finally restore the power of the Crown. Surely, Schleicher prepared the Empire for him - that was one of the promises which he made when proposing his candidacy during those fateful days in 1936.\n\nYet reality, as it turns out, is a bit different from his imagination. In truth, Schleicher never had any intention to strengthen the power and standing of the Kaisers - though they are important symbols of patriotic pride whose presence allows him to unify all of Germany behind his vision, that is all they need to be. A symbol, not a powerful actor - and especially not Wilhelm III, whom Schleicher always saw as quite dim.\n\nThe Reichskanzler ordered the reestablishment of the Privy Council, this time to serve as a direct connection between the government of the National Unity Front and the Kaiser and brief him on most important matters - however, his suggestions during council meetings will remain suggestions. Wilhelm III might imagine himself to be involved, but the truth is, perhaps ironically, that the disintegration of constitutional practice means his power is the smallest of all the Kaisers in history."

Their Conservative coalition partners were equally sceptical, and even Ewald von Kleist-Schmenzin, long seen as a patron of traditional monarchism in the Empire, shied away from such an arrogant, out of touch, dim-witted prince.\n\nAfter a meeting with the conservative leaders, Wilhelm III ultimately backed down and accepted his reduced role in the affairs of the state. Though he and the coalition share certain common principles, and the Conservative Revolution vehemently defends the traditional monarchical order, it appears that the monarch at the top of this hierarchy will be no more than a prop, a symbol who surrenders his authority to the bureaucracy and the ministers below."

A newly-signed settlement has recognised Japanese “custodianship” over Germany's possessions in Asia, as the latter looks to consolidate its resources towards Europe. What the Japanese plan to do with the colonies is unclear — but Germany's defeat seems to leave them the undisputed master of the Asian waters."
 gerflavour.84.d2: "The outbreak of war in Asia has not necessarily developed in Germany's favour.

 gerflavour.85.d: "The small Principality of Liechtenstein now finds itself at the crossroads. Considered the last remnant of the Holy Roman Empire by many, it has for the majority of its history been dependent on the Austrian Empire, with many of its Princes personally living there and owning many estates across the region. With the unification of Austria and the German Empire, that chapter of its history has now come to a close. While the people of Liechtenstein would have normally tried to reorient themselves towards their Swiss neighbours in the West, this is no longer a possibility - as such, the tiny principality remains isolated, with Germany being their only window to the larger world.\n\nWith both Pan-German fever and economic worries in mind, the locals have now begun to petition their Prince Franz-Joseph II to apply for accession into the German Empire. After careful consideration, the Prince, with the hope of alleviating the worries of his people and being able to strengthen his influence as the ruler of a full-fledged German constituent state, has thus officially sent a formal request to the German Emperor to allow Liechtenstein's integration.\n\nPowerful voices in German politics have offered varied reactions to this proposal. While many fear that Liechtenstein may, over the course of time, turn into some sort of tax haven nestled right within the midst of the Empire if left independent, others worry that adding a state with a population smaller than even the current smallest German state, Schaumburg-Lippe, could skew fair representation in the Bundesrat. As such, proposals have been made that Liechtenstein could instead be given only an observer role in the Bundesrat, with their interests being represented by Austria.\n\nThe German people, filled with enthusiasm due to the recent territorial expansion, are thrilled at the notion of the last remnant of the Holy Roman Empire finally joining the united Kaiserreich.

The Imperial German Army has been defeated on the battlefield and is being driven deeper and deeper into the country, sacrificing millions of our citizens to the occupation of the syndicalist bloc and the Russian alliance. The mood in the country and its army varies. Many believe that the fall of the Empire is inevitable and wish to either save their skin or force the country to negotiate a crippling peace treaty, even though no hints of a negotiating mood can be seen among French and Russian leadership. Others, including the Reichskanzler, believe that the war can still be turned around, or that the front can be expanded by bringing in new allies which will relieve the pressure. Still others blame the government's weakness, declaring that it simply doesn't have what it takes to bring the nation to war footing. If it finally gave up on the pretenses of legalism and established a totalitarian dictatorship, it could muster the necessary resources to turn the war around.\n\nThe hopes of the doubters were crushed when the first rumours of the Kaiser's flight from the country began spreading throughout the streets of Berlin. The heart and soul of the Empire, the symbol of its rise to world supremacy, allegedly boarded a submarine with his family in order to escape to the colonies, or to a neutral country in South America - whatever his fate may be, he clearly did not have faith in Germany's ability to win the war. Even more damning were the suggestions that [GER.GetSecondInCommand] ordered [GER.GetLeader]'s escape as a part of a plan to set up a government in exile that could continue the fight in a manner similar to the Entente powers after their revolutions.\n\nSo, is it over?"

These same leaders were among the first to question the government's less than stellar leadership during the War — meanwhile, at the same time, they desired an assertive authoritarian dictatorship which would immediately mobilise all of the Empire's resources for the war effort. They found allies — numerous young officers inspired by totalitarian, far-right ideologies who were certain that they could turn the course of war around as long as they were given power; then, contact with Max Bauer, the last of the leaders of the old Ludendorff clique during the first Weltkrieg. A retired general highly respected by the Die Fronde, both due to his immense political and organisational talent and his management of the Hindenburg Programme during the war, he was selected as the public face of their conspiracy.\n\nA putsch was organised in Berlin, in which the old government was overthrown and detained by Army officers. The Reichstag, Bundesrat and Prussian legislature were all dissolved, and a series of emergency decrees declared Bauer \"the supreme commander of the German Empire and leader of the National Salvation government\". Waldemar Pabst, his co-conspirator, became his second in command, and the putsch received the endorsement of other hardliners - Eugen von Schobert, Walter von Reichenau, Wilhelm List, Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck, Franz von Epp and Georg Lindemann, among others.\n\nBut will this be any more than Germany's dying gasp?"

The Imperial German Army has been defeated on the battlefield and is being driven deeper and deeper into the country, sacrificing millions of our citizens to the occupation of the syndicalist bloc and the Russian alliance. The mood in the country is pessimistic. The democratisation of the Empire since 1936 has also led to a reasonable, though modest growth to Germany's radical socialist movements - which have been emboldened even more by the Army's defeats at the front. For some, it seems certain that the only way Germany can survive is if it surrenders, and the only way it can surrender is if it topples the reactionary monarchist regime.\n\nSo, today, the blow to the German monarchy has been struck. Spontaneous revolts, instigated by the KAPD and KPD with participation from the National-Communists, begun throughout Berlin and the other major cities, the first workers' councils have been set up, intending to wrestle power from the state and pave the way to a syndicalist revolution. Naturally, law enforcement and reserve divisions responded with force. Street clashes have begun throughout Berlin.\n\nHowever, the Kaiser did not stay to get overthrown or, worse, lynched by the furious crowds. The heart and soul of the Empire, the symbol of its rise to world supremacy, allegedly boarded a submarine with his family in order to escape to the colonies, or to a neutral country in South America - whatever his fate may be, he clearly did not have faith in Germany's ability to win the war.\n\nSo, is it over?"
 geregg.3.a: "Germany is now headless. Does it still have a future?"

 geregg.4.t: "The Republic"
 geregg.4.d: "The Social Democratic government was left to lead a country on the verge of extinction — as a hail mary action to prevent a syndicalist revolution, they proclaimed the overthrowal of the Kaiser themselves. A \"German Republic\" was declared by Reichskanzler [GER.GetSecondInCommand] from the balcony of the Reichstag building, where the politician also promised a hasty peace and the establishment of immediate reforms for the betterment of the protesting working class - though neither of them seem likely to get implemented, owing to the geopolitical situation.\n\nAn emergency committee chaired by the Reichskanzler, who has become the de facto head of state, and fellow Social Democratic politician Hans Vogel was established. Their first priority is to maintain the faith of the army, somehow, and either find a way to turn the war around or make the subsequent death of the German Empire as painless as possible - that is, if it is even possible.\n\nBut will this be any more than Germany's dying gasp?"
 geregg.4.a: "Deutschland über alles!"

 geregg.5.t: "The Future of the Salvation Regime"
 geregg.5.d: "Against all odds, we were victorious, and all of Europe is our playground once more. We shall not allow ourselves to become soft like our predecessors were — the French and the Russians, as well as the thousands who betrayed Germany during its darkest hour will receive their due. A question arises, however — what shall be the future of our regime? The General, Max Bauer, took power merely as leader of an emergency government to save Germany in its darkest hour, after all.\n\nOur loyalty has always been to the monarchy, and the Hohenzollerns could be reinvited to Germany to assume their throne again. However, they disgraced themselves by abandoning the nation when it needed them most, and so, if we do choose to restore the monarchy, we should choose a puppet we can control — the grandson of Wilhelm II, Prince Wilhelm, should serve our purposes well in spite of his wavering sympathies to our ideology.\n\nAlternatively, the betrayal of the Hohenzollern family may indicate the need for a more direct hand — our \"New Germany\" shall be led by a suitable great man given the title Reichsverweser, whose command is completely unquestioned, until a suitable Kaiser can be crowned."

 newgerfor.1.d: "We have received a message from Berlin through the Ambassador of the German Empire in Washington, Friedrich Wilhelm von Prittwitz und Gaffron. Though the United States avoided involving themselves in the Weltkrieg, the relationship between us and the German Empire has declined in the past two decades regardless — the sympathy of the public for the Entente cause, news of Central Powers atrocities in Belgium, Serbia and Armenia, and a brief renewal of unrestricted submarine warfare in late 1918 all layered upon this suspicion. However, Berlin appears interested in turning a new leaf in our relationship and establishing a productive partnership between the two largest economies in the globe.\n\nThe ambassador offers a trade and investment project named \"The Prittwitz Plan\", which would reduce tariffs for German-American trade and lend us several interest-free loans with which we can get our sluggish economy going again. Informally, this plan is focused in containing the growth of socialism in the United States - and while it would certainly be helpful, accepting that we are becoming a secondary power influenced by the German hegemon might be too much for American pride to swallow."

 newgerfor.28.d: "How she has fallen, the \"Eldest Daughter of the Church\". For more than a century now, she has rebelled against not just Rome, but Faith itself, God Himself, and with each fit of rage from revolutionaries, bourgeois or proletarian, the blood of the martyrs flowed like a torrent. Each time we could only watch in horror, close enough to hear the cries of the oppressed. Like in Paris in 1871, where the demented wretches consumed even their archbishop, a holy man who had always fought for the poor. Their hatred of all that is good knows no bounds, and so when they repressed the Church first in 1905, and then obsessively attempted to entirely root her out since 1920, none of us were surprised. German Catholics, concerned for their fellow faithful, organised an \"Association for the Defence of French Catholics\" under the patronage of Monsignor Clemens August von Galen, creating links with organisations within France, paying for the studies of priests in exile, but most importantly keeping their plight in the spotlight.\n\nWe too had our differences with the Church but the hatchet is deeply buried now, and it is simply our duty as fellow Christians to go beyond divisions and do all that is in our power to support them. Particularly as an uptick in Catholic unrest had been noticed by our agents in France, and it would have been foolish of us to not take advantage of it. And so funds, and the occasional crate of weapons, flowed towards Catholic organisations in France and the underground networks of their most radical elements. Positive effects are already showing: it was reported that a particularly anticlerical militia officer was recently killed by such a cell, much to the relief of locals. The first of many. Some see these underground fighters as the new Chouans, these heroes who had resisted against the first godless Republic. Their name came from the local dialect for owl, and so Operation Eulen, Owl, was baptised."

 newgerfor.29.d: "Ever since the end of the Weltkrieg, German interests have expanded their investments in our country, making use of postwar free trade agreements and other pathways - though we have been trying to assert our economic independence, we have yet to fully achieve it. A massive influx of new investments and buyouts have taken place, seriously threatening the supply chain in several sectors.\n\nThis seems unnatural, especially as such an influx surely required cooperation with local authorities and members of the Duma, and we suspect that foreign operatives may have played a role in orchestrating it."

 newgerfor.30.d: "All that we've done in the name of the New Germany - and Berlin is not only ignorant of our efforts, but is trying to stamp us out!

 newgerfor.33.d: "The German ambassador to Ukraine has met with [ROOT.GetLeader] relaying Berlin's demands for a number of changes to be made to our government, which they say are concerned with matters of stability more than anything else. Though we could simply choose to accept these demands, we have asserted our independence from Germany thus far, and many are opposing what they see as a foreign-backed coup."
 newgerfor.33.a: "Their terms are acceptable."
 newgerfor.33.b: "Berlin be damned!"

 newgerfor.34.t: "Realignment Successful in Ukraine"
 newgerfor.34.d1: "For some time now, the Ukrainian State, while seemingly under the autocratic administration of Hetman Pavlo Skoropadskyi, has truly been led from the shadows by the Otaman-Minister, Ivan Poltavets-Ostrianytsia. The Otaman-Minister's rule has been marked by grave abuses and authoritarian rule almost unseen in Eastern Europe.\n\nIt is on this fact that the German ambassador in Ukraine Johannes von Welczeck had requested a meeting with Hetman Skoropadskyi, where he relayed that Berlin expressed \"deep concern\" about the situation in Ukraine. Unexpectedly, the Hetman agreed, acknowledging the appointment as a mistake, but further stated that he was unsure whether he would be able to unseat the Otaman-Minister without causing another violent conflict. In response, Welczeck promised German military support to assist in a \"transfer of power\" if necessary - a response that would have significant consequences the following day.\n\nThat transfer of power would happen as smoothly as the ambassador had hoped. Units of the Ukrainian army, assisted by a German division, captured government buildings in [202.GetName] and surrounded the Otaman-Minister's residence. Poltavets-Ostrianytsia was then arrested on corruption charges, as Hetman Skoropadskyi, seeking to reassure the populace in [202.GetName], made a radio address announcing his support for the army's actions.\n\nIn the same address, the Hetman had announced his abdication, citing an inability to provide proper governance due to poor health, and that according to constitutional law, his son Danylo would reign as the new Hetman. In his last act as Hetman, Skoropadskyi appointed nonpartisan war hero, Oleksandr Shapoval, to the Otaman-Ministership. The new Otaman-Minister and his government are expected to undergo a gradual democratisation process, one that will be overseen by the constitutionalist-leaning Hetman Danylo." #Ivan P-O SHD
 newgerfor.34.d2: "For some time now, the Ukrainian State has been under the autocratic rule of Pavlo Skoropadskyi and his Otaman-Minister, Borys Homzyn. Though Homzyn's government underwent a partial democratisation process after the war, many of the restrictions on political organisation dating back to the foundation of the Ukrainian State remained in place.\n\nIt is on this fact that the German ambassador in Ukraine Johannes von Welczeck had requested a meeting with Hetman Skoropadskyi and Otaman-Minister Homzyn. Welczeck relayed that Berlin expressed concern about the slow nature of Homzyn's democratisation process.  He brought up the Anti-Hetman Revolt as an example - the restrictions on political organisation and lack of reform only angered the populace, and the uprising was crushed with brute military force, not genuine support for the Hetman's government.\n\nWhile Homzyn had taken some offence to Welczeck's statement, the Hetman was clear in his support for the idea. Some days later, it was clear that his approval had influenced Homzyn, who announced a constitutional reform package to the Soim. Several vague clauses in the constitution had been modified, and laws banning socialist-leaning parties from running in the elections had been declared null and void.\n\nWith many of the restrictions now gone, the autocratic nature of the Hetman's government is sure to be phased out. The leading party, the Union of Hetmanites, is still unlikely to fall anytime soon in the elections of the near future, but a more constitutional administration than ever is now in place - something that Welczeck has reported to Berlin with pleasure." #Homzyn SHD
 newgerfor.34.d3: "For some time now, the Ukrainian State has been under the rule of Pavlo Skoropadskyi and a non-partisan government accountable to the Hetman and All-Ukrainian Class Assembly. This arrangement came as a result of 1937 elections, which brought Ukrainian Union of Agrarians-Statists and its vision of \"classocratic society\", based on Viacheslav Lypsinkyi's ideas, to the forefront of Ukrainian politics. So far, the results of this experiment have been mixed — non-agrarian organisations have been shut out of politics, and the organisation of political parties have been restricted.\n\nIt is on this fact that the German ambassador in Ukraine Johannes von Welczeck had requested a meeting with Hetman Skoropadskyi and Otaman-Minister Serhii Shemet. Welczeck relayed that Berlin expressed concern over the classocratic administration, saying that it was marred with inefficiencies and would likely not be able to sustain itself forever. He brought up the Anti-Hetman Revolt as an example — the restrictions on the people's ability to organise themselves into political parties would only bring instability.\n\nIn response, the Hetman vowed that soon the most democratic measures would be ensured which would \"not severely compromise\" the system. Though he had few words in the meeting with Welczeck, Otaman-Minister Shemet seemingly followed the Hetman's will, as he announced the lifting of the ban on political parties the next day, along with reforms aimed at weaking the post of the head of the Council of Jurors. The post's holder, Mykola Kochubei, has reportedly been furious at the act, but the reform process has gone smoothly nonetheless, something that Welczeck has reported back to Berlin with pleasure." #USKhD
 newgerfor.34.d4: "For some time now, Ukraine has been under the rule of \"Providnyk\" Yevhen Konovalets and the League of Ukrainian Nationalists, who came to power after a coup against the Hetman's government. The coup did not earn any goodwill from Berlin, given that the Hetman had led Ukraine as a staunch German ally for two decades at that point — but it was a done deal, and we were forced to compromise.\n\nThough reinstating the Hetman is out of the question, there have been proposals to attempt to moderate the League's influence. These proposals have inspired a meeting between the German ambassador to Ukraine, Johannes von Welczeck and Providnyk Yevhen Konovalets. Welczeck relayed that Berlin expressed \"deep concern\" over the LUN's undemocratic behaviour, as well as some anti-German sentiment from its most fanatical adherents.\n\nWhile Konovalets questioned what position Berlin was in to be making such statements, he expressed that a political isolation of more troublesome elements in the party was not out of the question. Tensions between the old membership of the League, composed of radical nationalists, and the new membership, composed mostly of military figures, have existed since the coup, and were now becoming greater. It was in his nation's interest, Konovalets told Welczeck, that Stsiborskyi, Lypa and other members of the party were to have their posts reassigned — and Welczeck had given Konovalets a clear reason for doing so.\n\nThe Providnyk was vague on whether or not multiparty elections would be held in the future, and remained adamant that there were more \"pressing issues\", but Konovalets' stance has reassured Berlin to a comfortable degree." #LUN
 newgerfor.34.d5: "Since the early 1937 Germany's largest eastern client state, Ukraine, has been governed by a democratic republican government, which established itself in the wake of the successful anti-Hetman insurrection. The collapse of the ruling regime was so utter and swift that Berlin was left with little choice aside from recognising the new authorities, especially considering that [202.GetName] showed readiness to comply with Germany's demands.\n\nTo its credit, the new government dutifully observed its security obligations and played its part in the war. Still, there remains a concern that with the immediate threat of Moscow gone, Ukraine may start testing the boundaries of what is allowed, potentially disrupting the carefully built system of security and economic dominance in Eastern Europe.\n\nTo prevent this, citing the incompatibility of the most recent legislative package with the Mitteleuropa regulations, Germany significantly raised tariffs for exported Ukrainian grain and threatened to withhold several large loans. All this, together with anonymous leaks to the press regarding several cases of embezzlement and ineffective usage of state funds, led to the parliamentary crisis and string of resignations in the government. Fearing that this situation may potentially lead to the fall of the cabinet, Ukrainian authorities acquiesced to Berlin's demands. Disgraced statesmen, affiliated to various parties, were to be replaced with pragmatic experts and business representatives, many of whom in the past were tied to the now defunct Union of Industry, Trade, Finance and Agriculture. All legislation regarding trade and financial policies was from now on to be discreetly subjected to the scrutiny of the German Chamber of Trade and Commerce in [202.GetName].\n\nThe last stipulation has significantly weakened the left wing of the URDP, one of the largest Ukrainian forces in the parliament, thus shifting the balance of power in the legislature in the direction much more suitable for Berlin."

 newgerfor.37.d: "A note from [FROM.GetName] informs us that they will not challenge our claim to the Suez Canal and will allow a German garrison to arrive to Port-al-Said immediately. This is an impressive victory for our diplomacy, and gives us unprecedented power in the control of the seas."
 newgerfor.37.a: "Without a shot fired."

 newgerfor.38.t: "[FROM.GetName] Asks for Support Against Germany"
 newgerfor.38.d: "We have received a concerned diplomatic note from [FROM.GetName] - apparently, Germany has recently demanded them to turn over the Suez Canal, at the threat of an invasion. As we have no direct designs on [FROM.GetName], they have officially requested our support in this diplomatic crisis - perhaps we stand to gain quite a bit if we back it against the Germans and score a diplomatic victory?"
 newgerfor.38.a: "We will protect [FROM.GetName] against German imperialism!"
 newgerfor.38.b: "We will not risk a war with Germany."

 newgerfor.39.t: "[FROM.GetName] Resists!"
 newgerfor.39.d: "[FROM.GetName] has informed us that they will not hand the Suez over to us, and have cut diplomatic relations with us. It appears that only war can resolve this crisis."
 newgerfor.39.a: "Then we shall crush them!"

 newgerfor.40.t: "[FROM.GetName] Supports Us!"
 newgerfor.40.d: "[FROM.GetName] has informed us that they will support us against Germany's encroachment in the Middle East and will guarantee our territorial integrity! This should give Berlin a reason to reconsider their imperialist policies."
 newgerfor.40.a: "Together, we will stop German imperialism!"

 newgerfor.41.t: "[FROM.GetName] Does Not Support Us!"
 newgerfor.41.d: "[FROM.GetName] has blown us off! They are not interested in protecting us against German threats and have left us to fend for ourselves. Meanwhile, the German demand for the Suez is still pending... Do we have a chance if we resist, or should we simply give up the canal?"
 newgerfor.41.a: "We now have no choice but to acquit."
 newgerfor.41.b: "Let them be damned! We will resist Germany alone!"

 newgerfor.42.t: "The Suez Crisis"
 newgerfor.42.d: "The situation has escalated. [FROM.GetName] has suddenly joined the conflict over the Suez Canal by guaranteeing their territorial integrity and threatening to intervene if we use military force to seize the Suez Canal. We don't know if this is a real threat or an empty one, but we should tread carefully from here on out."
 newgerfor.42.a: "Then you will both be crushed!"
 newgerfor.42.b: "We must back down, we cannot risk a war."

 newgerfor.43.t: "Germany Backs Down"
 newgerfor.43.d: "Joined by our new allies, we have forced Germany to back down! For now, our independence is asserted, and Germany has been somewhat humiliated in the international arena."
 newgerfor.43.a: "A victory of our diplomacy!"

 newgerfor.44.t: "Germany Demands Control of Oil Fields"
 newgerfor.44.d: "We have received a shocking message from the German ambassador - their country is highly interested in the oil that is being extracted in our country, and wish for us to sell these oil fields to a German-owned company, thus giving Germany control over our oil production. This would greatly jeopardise our economic independence - however, should we refuse, it is possible that the Germans will use military force to seize our oil..."
 newgerfor.44.a: "We cannot fight the Empire."
 newgerfor.44.b: "We will defend our economic independence!"

 newgerfor.45.t: "[FROM.GetName] Accepts"
 newgerfor.45.d: "[FROM.GetName] saw the writing on the wall and surrendered their oil resources to us. Now, this oil can be used to fuel our ever growing industry."
 newgerfor.45.a: "Perfect."

 newgerfor.46.t: "[FROM.GetName] Refuses"
 newgerfor.46.d: "[FROM.GetName] has proven to be both stubborn and idiotic - they have refused all attempts to negotiate and declared that they do not wish for us to violate their economic independence. Perhaps a military solution can force them to surrender."
 newgerfor.46.a: "Time for a war in the Gulf..."

 newgerfor.47.t: "German Support for African Resistance"
 newgerfor.47.d: "For many years, we have had to deal with resistance in Africa — everything from Tuareg raiders to brewing nationalist movements in the Maghreb. Now, worryingly, Berlin has joined the fray as well — officially pledging their support to the \"anti-colonial struggle in French Africa\", as hypocritical as it sounds. It is likely that underground anticolonial resistance will start receiving more and more support as well..."
 newgerfor.47.a: "Bastards..."

 newgerfor.48.t: "Germany Offers Economic Agreement"
 newgerfor.48.d: "Our reunification of China was not missed by the world's great powers — and Germany, which has won the Second Weltkrieg and consolidated its positions in Europe, has now reached out to us with an offer to \"reboot\" our relationship. They offer a trade and economic agreement - lesser trade barriers and large amounts of joint German-Chinese investment in special economic zones which can help kickstart our transition to an industrial economy.\n\nUnderstandably, there is reason to be suspicious of Berlin's intentions - their meddling in China is well known, and infamous. However, now that a strong, stable and united China stands behind our backs, perhaps we can finally create an equitable agreement between us and the Westerners?"
 newgerfor.48.a: "Of course, this will be mutually beneficial."
 newgerfor.48.b: "This is just another attempt to jeopardise our independence!"

 newgerfor.49.t: "[FROM.GetName] Accepts"
 newgerfor.49.d: "[FROM.GetName] has put our old disagreements behind and agreed to our trade and economic agreement. Already, we are reaping the fruits of this investment."
 newgerfor.49.a: "Perfect."

 newgerfor.50.t: "[FROM.GetName] Refuses"
 newgerfor.50.d: "[FROM.GetName] is not interested in economic cooperation, and so the negotiations for a Sino-German Economic Agreement have swiftly ceased."
 newgerfor.50.a: "Oh well..."

 newgerfor.51.t: "Growing German Investment"
 newgerfor.51.d: "A section of the Foreign Office of the German Empire has been established in our country, which is intended to facilitate investment within our country and serve as a channel for greater and greater German control of our economy. Already, Berlin's efforts are seeing success - German investors have taken control of several large companies and intend to channel their profits back to their homeland. Some growth of our industrial base has been noticed as well, however."
 newgerfor.51.a: "Oh well..."

 newgerfor.52.t: "Eastern Railway Plan"
 newgerfor.52.d: "We have been informed that the German Empire has begun a rail expansion programme which will connect our states with Eastern Germany and thus allow easier transfer of troops between the West and the East. In addition to this, some German-built rolling stock has been transferred to our stockpiles in order to make operation of these improved rails easier."
 newgerfor.52.a: "Good."

 newgerfor.53.t: "Germany Demands Return of African Colonies"
 newgerfor.53.d: "We have received a telegram from the German Empire - they demand the return of their colonies in Africa which we, according to them, have stolen from their righteous ownership - even though it was their incompetent rule which led to the collapse of their colony in the first place. Regardless, Berlin seems intent to back their words with weapons, if we don't surrender our newly conquered territories."
 newgerfor.53.a: "We have no choice but to accept."
 newgerfor.53.b: "They can't get to us here!"

 newgerfor.54.t: "[FROM.GetName] Accepts"
 newgerfor.54.d: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] has chosen to settle this conflict peacefully and has surrendered their territories in Africa to us. Now, we can safely reestablish our colonial administration there."
 newgerfor.54.a: "Perfect."

 newgerfor.55.t: "[FROM.GetName] Refuses"
 newgerfor.55.d: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] has refused our peaceful demand to return the African territories they control, and so we will have no option to either accept this change of ownership or try more violent methods."
 newgerfor.55.a: "Our words are backed with weapons."

 newgerfor.56.t: "Support from Germany"
 newgerfor.56.d: "Our fatherland has sent us an influx of resources, supplies and reinforcements in order to facilitate our reconquest of our former holdings in Central Africa."
 newgerfor.56.a: "Thank you."

 newgerfor.57.t: "Final Cession of Sovereignty"
 newgerfor.57.d: "Over several years, the Mitteleuropean institutions have grown more and more controlling - each reform increasingly empowering their bureaucracy while at the same time increasing the control which the German Empire has over these institutions. By now, they are effectively one and the same - who assumes positions in Mitteleuropa is now pretty much always decided by Berlin, and said institutions have a lot of power in making us act according to their wishes. Our economic and political independence is increasingly put in jeopardy.\n\nNow, the final stone is being laid - which will grant Mitteleuropa unprecedented control over our government, to the point where governments which are deemed unacceptable to the \"goals and directions of the customs union\", effectively, to German interest, would likely end up falling due to economic pressure. Is this it? Or do we still have a choice?"
 newgerfor.57.a: "No, we have no choice..."
 newgerfor.57.b: "Yes, we have to stay out!"

 newgerfor.58.t: "[FROM.GetName] Refuses Cession of Sovereignty"
 newgerfor.58.d: "The politicians in [FROM.GetName] have refused to bow to our wishes and have left the Mitteleuropa organisation instead of surrendering their sovereignty to our supranational organisation. They say they would likely stay an independent ally of our alliance."
 newgerfor.58.a: "I see..."

 newgerfor.59.t: "Invitation to the Munich Conference"
 newgerfor.59.d: "The Second Weltkrieg has settled down. Inspired by their successful experience in pluralistic international institutions after democratic reforms to Mitteleuropa, the German Empire has called up a conference made up of representatives from all countries in the world - with the intent of establishing an international arbiter, one which could finally put an end to a worldwide spiral of war and push countries to settle their disputes on the diplomatic arena, rather than with military might.\n\nThis institution would be the Union of Nations, and though Germany would serve as its key enforcer, membership in this organisation promises considerable economic and trade benefits, as well as German protection. Should we join such a proposal?"
 newgerfor.59.a: "Yes, perhaps we can prevent a Third Weltkrieg together."
 newgerfor.59.b: "No, what for?"

 newgerfor.60.t: "[FROM.GetName] Refuses Union of Nations Membership"
 newgerfor.60.d: "The government of [FROM.GetName] has refused to attend the Munich Conference and will not be a founding member of the Union of Nations. Though they may join in the future, they will remain outside of our aegis for the time being."
 newgerfor.60.a: "I see..."

 newgerfor.61.t1: "Germany Demands Restoration"
 newgerfor.61.t2: "Germany Demands Regime Change"
 newgerfor.61.d1: "While the Clover revolution made it appear that Germany would allow Poland the freedom to determine its own future, we now know this was merely a facade. Now that they do not need our help in defending Europe from syndicalists, the regime of [GER.GetSecondInCommand] has demanded the restoration of the Hohenzollerns, who have no more ties to Poland than the Kaiser himself.\n\nThis naked imperialism is not lost on the public, who are already demonstrating for the government to oppose Berlin's orders."
 newgerfor.61.d2: "The government of [POL.GetLeader] has fallen out of favour with Berlin.\n\nThe tumult of Poland's recent history — the subject of a failed minority government, a revolution, and a coup — has endowed the ChZJN government with respect as a force of responsible and stable government. The Centrolew coalition, who had taken power by force after ignoring the constitution, had proven that they could not govern responsibly after the passage of anticlerical measures led to fears of an extremist takeover, and Rydz-Śmigły's temporary junta before restoring civilian government solved this.\n\nApparently the incumbent regime in Germany do not agree with this assessment. Despite the frustration of opposing parties in the Reichstag, they have declared Rydz-Śmigły's coup illegal and demanded the Centrolew bloc be allowed to form a new government."
 newgerfor.61.d3: "As Marxists and nationalists have threatened Poland both internally and abroard, the Studnicki Cabinet has made it the goal of the government to prevent these threats from escalating by carefully reforming the economy and maintaining close ties with Germany. Now, Germany wishes to dismantle it.\n\nPoland's Constitution gives the King the power to appoint governments at his pleasure, and these governments have enjoyed the ability to enact their agenda through decree while bypassing the elected Sejm. The radical parliamentarians in Germany have deemed this, along with percieved corruption, as unacceptable. They have demanded Poland form a reformist government which can build greater legitimacy through measures such as abolishing the royal veto."
 newgerfor.61.a: "We are doomed."
 newgerfor.61.b: "They must be bluffing!"

 newgerfor.62.t: "Poland Accepts"
 newgerfor.62.d1: "As demanded, the unelected government in Poland have stood down. Władysław Studnicki will step down as Prime Minister of Poland in favour of a transitional government led by liberals in the Interpartisan Circle designed to reform the Polish constitution and prevent aristocrats from meddling on such a scale again."
 newgerfor.62.d2: "As demanded, the Endecja-aligned government in Poland have allowed the Centrolew-aligned Republicans to restore their regime until the ChZJN coalition are able to secure a mandate legally through democratic elections. Although ChJZN planned to continue elections on their terms, it was felt that this would allow all parties to compete fairly."
 newgerfor.62.d3: "The populists in Warsaw have capitulated to our demands, and the constitutional government under the rightful monarchy has been restored.\n\nThe Kaiser's son was reluctant to return to the throne, citing his low popularity and the risk his return could pose. Neither the Kaiser nor the Reichskanzler disagreed, but either way Germany cannot afford for Poland to be lost."
 newgerfor.62.a: "Excellent"

 newgerfor.63.t: "Poland Resists"
 newgerfor.63.d1: "Warsaw have refused to heed our warnings. Apparently they believe that because their King made the difficult choice to abdicate in dire circumstances, any German who tries to engage with them will simply let the Polish people walk all over them. This notion will not last."
 newgerfor.63.d2: "Bafflingly, the Polish government have refused to get out of the way of the democratic process even when faced with military intervention. Given their economic and political reliance on us it's not clear how they expect to hide from justice, but it seems they're going to try."
 newgerfor.63.a: "This shouldn't take long."

 newgerfor.64.t: "Germany Demands Regime Change"
 newgerfor.64.d1: "Getting the German Empire on board with what has always been a socialist movement was never going to be easy. However, for a time this seemed to be working. The Hrmada and later BDSP were able to foster good relations with Berlin as it moderated and sought allies against Russia, but the radicalised government of [GER.GetSecondInCommand] put this policy to an end.\n\nIt is obvious that Berlin are planning a coup. After publically disavowing the socialist nature of the BDSP and the instability it has brought the country, we have recieved word that far right leader Vacłaŭ Łastoŭski has departed to meet with the German foreign office. Although with advanced knowledge we may be able to rally the Army and prevent an easy takeover, preventing Germany from intervening and installing their preferred government is another problem."
 newgerfor.64.d2: "Despite their crucial role in his rise to power, Radasłaŭ Astroŭski has fallen out of favour with Germany. They consider the failure of the Taraškievič government an \"illegal coup\", despite the impending danger of socialists selling the country to Paris, and demand that we release imprisoned leftists for them to form a new government.\n\nWhether this is because they think a patriotic right wing Belarus would drift away from them, that removing us would improve their prestige, or simply that the BDSP would be reliant on them is not clear, but it is obvious that they do not value our sovereignty."
 newgerfor.64.d3: "Germany was not the ally of independently minded Kryvians we hoped they were. After a feud between Astroŭski's right and Taraškievič's left proved that the Sojm was only worsening the safety of the country, revolutionary Agrarian Party members managed to solve the crisis by bringing about a new state.\n\nWe hoped that, given the importance of our geopolitical position, Germany would recognise the importance of this and it seemed they did at first. Unfortunately, liberalism has poisoned the German state into the belief that democracy must be thrust back upon us. Berlin have demanded a new Sojm session, with a government led by NDA members who survived the chaos of the coup. This would be a terrible fate, but it's not clear what we can do."
 newgerfor.64.d4: "Generalgouvernment Minsk was never seen as a permanent solution to the political situation in White Ruthenia. Rather, it was used to ensure that the unrest in the country did not leave it vulnerable to Russia, which succeeded. Likewise, Kempf has never seen himself as a permanent overlord of the country — rather one note in his career of service to the German fatherland.\n\nBerlin, no longer needing the dictatorship, has delivered orders for the Generalgouvernment to restore Belarusian sovereignty without further delay and for Werner Kempf to return to his post as a military attaché. The moderate NDA bloc have been earmarked as leaders of a provisional government, owing to their willingness to build a diplomatic relationship with the military regime."
 newgerfor.64.a: "It's a small price for a prosperous future, right?"
 newgerfor.64.b: "Maybe we can stall for time."
 newgerfor.64.c: "We're on it, sheesh."

 newgerfor.65.t: "[WHR.GetNameDefCap] Agrees"
 newgerfor.65.d1: "Despite their ostensible loyalty to us, the BSDP have been flirting socialism since their inception. Their leader Taraškievič has been noted for especially warm feelings towards it and for coddling the marxist wing of the party despite its views.\n\nFortunately, we are not the only ones who have noticed this. One of the largest opposition parties to the BSDP is the Belarusian Peasant Party. Holding a solid base in the Sojm, a paramilitary wing, and a hatred of socialism and russophilia, Łastoŭski's party are ideal allies for this. Taraškievič's government could not withstand our pressure and Łastoŭski entered Minsk almost unopposed."
 newgerfor.65.d2: "The memory of democracy in White Ruthenia is still fresh in both our minds and theirs. After the Weltkrieg the country was established as a free democratic republic, and despite the recency of White Ruthenian national identity, this had proven itself very viable. The only thing that could vanquish this order was the corruption of the elite and the army, who could not allow popular land reform to challenge their vicegrip on the economy. Today, however, the coup has been undone. Under our pressure, the Astroŭski cabinet have seen the writing on the wall and abdicated their power after releasing BDSP prisoners. We have succeeded."
 newgerfor.65.d3: "However grisly the end of White Ruthenian democracy might have been, we could not tolerate the Łastoŭski dictatorship any further. No democratic power could sit by and watch its supposed ally's violent totalitarianism destroy the livelihood of its people as the Kryvian state has been gleefully doing. The government have sent Minsk their demand to stand down or face intervention, and either out of fear or a rare moment of sensibility, they cowed. This new government will have an unenviable job of rebuilding, but they have at least secured power."
 newgerfor.65.d4: "The [GER.GetSecondInCommand] government has a reputation to uphold on the world scene. The reformed German government must show that it conducts fair, good faith diplomacy, and this will not be possible while swathes of land lie illegally annexed by the Heer. To this end, the Generalgouvernment in Minsk has been abolished effective immediately and German officers in White Ruthenia have been returned to attaché positions. In order to ensure the instability of the Taraškievič regime does not repeat, the moderate Christian Democrat-led coalition have been tapped for overseeing the return to democracy."
 newgerfor.65.a: "One headache saved."

 newgerfor.66.t: "[WHR.GetNameDefCap] Refuses"
 newgerfor.66.d1: "Despite their ostensible loyalty to us, the BSDP have been flirting socialism since their inception. Their leader Taraškievič has been noted for especially warm feelings towards it and for coddling the marxist wing of the party despite its views.\n\nIt appears that they have finally shown their true colours again: after initial plans for a bloodless coup were thwarted, the Taraškievič cabinet have chosen to ignore our demands for regime change, perhaps hoping to negotiate a better deal. In any other case this may have been a courageous deed, but Marxism cannot be allowed to encroach on German borders once again."
 newgerfor.66.d2: "Given the imbalance in power between the leading power of Eastern Europe and one of its poorest states, one might conclude that the Central Rada have overplayed their hand. In response to a note demanding that the coup toppling the legal BDSP government be reversed, the de jure government in Minsk claimed that doing so would mean a communist revolution and stressed the need for careful cooperation between the two governments. Perhaps if it is unsafe for the Central Rada to fulfil our demands as is, our Army will be able to assist them with such a task."
 newgerfor.66.d3: "The political situation of White Ruthenia is a grim affair. Tensions between the government and Army during the mid-30s ended in a failed coup leaving the extreme right of Vacłaŭ Łastoŭski's BSP to fill the vacuum. Given the desparate situation at the time and their willingness to cooperate against Russia, Germany had to sit and watch the totalitarian regime develop, but no more — after the dictatorship refused a chance to stand down willingly, we are now poised to restore the legal parliamentarian government ourselves."
 newgerfor.66.a: "They didn't have to make us do this."

 newgerfor.67.t: "Germany Demands Regime Change"
 newgerfor.67.d1: "While we remain one of the most democratic and constitutional governments in Eastern Europe, the government of [GER.GetSecondInCommand] has been trampling all over constitutional protocol and we have received reward that they are even planning a coup to appoint Smetona as the Prime Minister. This blatantly illegal act is a brazen attack on all Lithuania's people, but perhaps we have no choice as Germany shall reinforce its hegemony..."
 newgerfor.67.d2: "[LIT.GetLeader]'s government has fallen out of favour with Germany. While more hardliner measures have kept the socialists and Lithuanian Activist Front at bay, Berlin has demanded that we hold new elections. It is almost assured that these elections will be in favour of the LKDP or LDSP.\n\nIt is likely that we will be forced to yield, but all the measures we have taken were for stability's stake - should we really throw away that just to please Berlin?"
 newgerfor.67.a: "We are doomed."
 newgerfor.67.b: "They must be bluffing!"

 newgerfor.68.t: "[LIT.GetNameDef] Agrees"
 newgerfor.68.d1: "Thankfully, the incumbent Lithuanian government has chosen to stand down and allow the liberal and socialist elements in their country to be dispersed. Antanas Smetona, though a Lithuanian nationalist, has been sworn in as Lithuania's prime minister and the Seimas has been readjusted with his Nationalist Party. Hopefully, his rule will stabilise Lithuania and keep it at bay from the socialists and ultranationalists who seek to undermine German rule in Eastern Europe."
 newgerfor.68.d2: "The authoritarian government in [LIT.GetName] has chosen to stand down. To accomodate our request, they have chosen to hold a snap election, which will likely result in either the victory of their Social Democratic Party or Christian Democratic Party."
 newgerfor.68.a: "Good news."

 newgerfor.69.t: "[LIT.GetNameDef] Resists"
 newgerfor.69.d1: "Surprisingly, the government in [LIT.GetName] has called on its citizens to resist our request. Antanas Smetona, who urged the Lithuanian government to stand down, has called on intervention from Berlin to secure his rule. This is not a request we will turn down, of course."
 newgerfor.69.d2: "Surprisingly, the government in [LIT.GetName] has already been preparing the Lithuanian Army to resist our request for democratic elections to be held, calling it an attack on their sovereignty and expelling our military mission there. We have no choice but to restore democracy there by force."
 newgerfor.69.a: "This shouldn't take long."

 newgerfor.146.t: "Germany Denounces Us"
 newgerfor.146.d1: "A few mere remarks by German leader [GER.GetSecondInCommand] have caused uproar to spiral throughout the country. After Germany's acquiescence years earlier and the fall of Russia, the independence of the Estonian nation felt guaranteed. However, the end of Russia also meant that Germany would be newly emboldened to shape Europe as they see fit. In this new light, Berlin has made the simple move of suggesting that they do not believe in our legitimacy.\n\nJournalists, demonstrators and politicians across the country were sent into a panic, and even if an intervention to restore ducal rule did not manifest, it looked like the government could collapse from their seeming lack of strength. Even liberal-leaning officers in the Estonian army were increasingly losing faith, which was the perfect backdrop for the disgraced would-be dictator to make his return. A chaotic march on Tallinn routed the civilian government and quickly installed Sirk, who made an ominous speech about preserving Estonia at all costs and the necessity of tough rule to prevent the breakdown of society. In order to legitimise this, Sirk spoke before the Riigikogu and asked them to vote to temporarily prorogue business, and all that remains is to see if they will agree."
 newgerfor.146.d2: "After our service in the Second Weltkrieg one might hope that Germany would be grateful or at least respectful of our competence. Unfortunately, the quasi-socialists regime are singing a different tune. To them it seems that if a government is not like-minded it must be illegal and illegitimate, and they are willing to back up this view with a genuine threat. As much as it would be nice to ignore them entirely, this may be the end of the line for us."
 newgerfor.146.a: "Fine, have your government."
 newgerfor.146.b: "This is short-sighted sabotage."
 newgerfor_146_tt: "§CThis may be what they wanted.§!"

 newgerfor.147.t: "[EST.GetNameDef]'s New Government"
 newgerfor.147.d1: "Our gambit in the Baltics has gone incredibly smoothly, perhaps making an example of how to back a coup to future leaders. By making it look like we could move to abolish their newfound independence, building up near the border and closely cooperating with sympathetic elements, the Tallinn government vanished almost overnight, and our friend Sirk has been able to assume power with almost no bloodshed. Estonia will no longer bother us."
 newgerfor.147.d2: "The despots running Estonia may have been unscrupulous and cruel, but they weren't irrational, and they knew when their time was up. While the last thing we wanted was to dismantle the self-determination of peoples in the East, a nudge towards democracy will certainly do a lot to ensure our relations remain mutually amicable and prosperous, so it's only right that we liberate our friends from their oppressors. Our pressure has already succeded and a new provisional government under the Rahvaerakond party is in place."
 newgerfor.147.a: "That wasn't too hard."

 newgerfor.148.t: "[EST.GetNameDef] Defies Us"
 newgerfor.148.d1: "Regrettably, our effort to peacefully bring Estonia into our fold failed at the eleventh hour. While we could see that Sirk was the best option they had to ensure sovereign prosperity, their legislature could not. Perhaps we should never have trusted the Forest Brothers in the first place, but in any case, we have few options now."
 newgerfor.148.d2: "[EST.GetLeader] is an idiot. The hour of democracy has finally dawned over Europe after the defeat of the western syndicalists and eastern revanchists, and all he could do is flounder and waffle about sovereignty. Perhaps in a happier world authoritarians in such countries would realise their fate and give up, but with no signs of an uprising or coup, we may have to liberate Estonia from above."
 newgerfor.148.a: "Sad day, refuel the tanks."

 newgerfor.70.t: "Operation: Jacobus"
 newgerfor.70.d: "Over the course of several weeks, the R.E.D. has acquired information about new German intelligence activities on our soil. Apparently, agents of Abteilung IIIb are meeting with unidentified monarchist loyalists and organising a stay-behind organisation, which will remain completely inactive until wartime, at which point they will organise and join a reactionary landing on the British Isles as collaborating troops. Scotland, with its relatively high number of loyalists as well as lesser population density, has been the focus of their activity thus far.\n\nOur counter-intelligence will do whatever it takes to hunt down these circles of traitors, but we should consider all possibilities, even the worst ones."
 newgerfor.70.a: "Understood."

 newgerfor.71.t: "Volunteers in Scotland"
 newgerfor.71.d: "Our troops in Scotland have been met by an uprising of local anti-syndicalist collaborators, who, as we have been informed, were preparing to rise up against the syndicalist regime in Britain for years. They had been prepared by German intelligence during the so-called \"Operation: Jacobus\", and their trained military formations now join our ranks in the liberation of the isle!"
 newgerfor.71.a: "We welcome their support."

 newgerfor.72.t: "Restoration of the [FRP.GetAdjective] Throne?"
 newgerfor.72.d: "After long and hard work, we finally finished our de-syndicalisation of France and can safely hand over the reins to a loyal puppet government. However, as our own experience has shown, no republic is invulnerable to the propaganda of the venomous red snakes - only a nation with a monarch, such as ours, can resist this venom and remain loyal to the national cause. Perhaps France needs the same solution?\n\nThe Bourbons and the Action Francaise, who had lost their opportunity to take power in Algiers, could prove to be valuable collaborators if we invite them to their home and offer them a deal. After all, they could not miss the chance to finally return to the homeland they desire most - and be given the opportunity to implement their own \"conservative revolution\" in Paris, as long as they do not stray away from our overlordship. Alternatively, if we deem them untrustworthy, we can simply establish a local authoritarian regime."
 newgerfor.72.a: "Invite the Bourbons back to their throne!"
 newgerfor.72.b: "Let's not do such monarchical experiments."

 newgerfor.73.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Claims [GER_claimed_state.GetName]"
 newgerfor.73.d.greece: "A worrying note has reached us from Berlin. Apparently, [FROM.GetNameDef], which is supposed to be our ally, has laid claim upon the Eastern Mediterranean islands which are a part of our Greek homeland - intending to turn them into naval bases for their planned Mediterranean dominance. Should we now wage war for these islands, it is possible that Germany will seize them and deny us the change to reunify Greekdom. How should we respond?"
 newgerfor.73.d.italy: "A worrying note has reached us from Berlin. Apparently, [FROM.GetNameDef], which is supposed to be our ally, has laid claim upon the island of Malta - they intend to transform it into an unsinkable aircraft carrier and thus exert pressure upon the entire Mediterranean. Should we end up in war over Malta, it is possible that Germany will seize it and deny us the chance to hold it. How should we respond?"

 newgerfor.74.d: "Our declare claim over [GER_claimed_state.GetName] has had diplomatic consequences. [FROM.GetNameDefCap], who also have claims over the island, feel slighted by our decision and decided to withdraw from our alliance.

 newgerfor.75.t: "Socialists Sweep The Polls in Ukraine"
 newgerfor.75.d1: "After a months long election campaign, the result in [202.GetName] was clear: the so-called \"Workers' Democratic Union\", an alliance of Ukrainian socialist parties, emerged with a plurality of seats and shortly formed a government with the Social Democratic Workers' Party. The new leader of Ukraine, Chairman Volodymyr Vynnychenko, has rather questionable sympathies, to say the least.\n\nAlready, the black-white-red coalition has come under fire for this \"grave mistake\". While Foreign Secretary Ulrich von Hassell has attempted to garner a reputation as a foreign policy hawk who will defend German interests against syndicalism, the Ukrainian election has put this in doubt. After all, if Germany's client states in the east are allowed to freely let socialists come to power, what does that imply for the future of our economic and military hegemony in the region, let alone our very security?\n\nUpon coming to power, Vynnychenko has attempted to distance himself from the Third Internationale, saying that his government is solely \"pro-Ukrainian\". Still, right-wing newspapers have ruthlessly criticised both Vynnychenko's Bloc and the foreign office, lamenting that Berlin did not intervene in the Hetman's favour. Hopefully, cooperation with Vynnychenko will be smoother than we expect it to be, and Ukraine will continue its anti-Russian course first and foremost. But that is the future - for now, we can only suffer the consequences of our actions."
 newgerfor.75.d2: "After a months long election campaign, the result in [202.GetName] was clear: the so-called \"Workers' Democratic Union\", an alliance of Ukrainian socialist parties, emerged with a plurality of seats and shortly formed a government with the Social Democratic Workers' Party. The new leader of Ukraine, Chairman Volodymyr Vynnychenko, has rather questionable sympathies, to say the least.\n\nAlready, Schleicher's government has come under fire for this \"grave mistake\". Schleicher himself has yet to respond to the development, but it is almost certain that our ambassador to Ukraine, Johannes von Welczeck, will be assigned on a mission to soften the worst elements of this socialist takeover in [202.GetName]. However, it is unlikely the election result can be undermined completely, at least without significant bloodshed.\n\nUpon coming to power, Vynnychenko has attempted to distance himself from the Third Internationale, saying that his government is solely \"pro-Ukrainian\".  Still, right-wing newspapers have ruthlessly criticised both Vynnychenko's Bloc and the foreign office, lamenting that Berlin did not intervene in the Hetman's favour.

But that is the future - for now, we can only suffer the consequences of our actions."
 newgerfor.75.a: "I thought he was a collectocrat, not a communist?"

 newgerfor.76.t: "Our Security in the East"
 newgerfor.76.d: "Our General Staff has received a report from the German Military Mission in Ukraine, which just conducted a regular joint session with the Ukrainian General Staff. To put it bluntly, it states that the projected strength of the Ukrainian Armed Forces are insufficient for the war scenario the High Command has been preparing for. Fears that the Ostwall may crumble to a potential Russian invasion without significant German reinforcements - which would certainly dampen the effort in the West - no longer seem like just hysteria.\n\nFor Schleicher, Germany's eastern allies have always played a pivotal role in planning a German defence of Europe against Syndicalist and Russian intrusion. To that end, he is not dissimilar from his predecessors in that he sees them primarily as instruments of German economic hegemony in the region, as well as buffer states between Berlin and Moscow. Thus, trying to enforce ideological hegemony is, for the most part, a wasted effort.\n\nYet, the report speculates that the reason for Ukraine's military faltering may be due to lessened spending. Since the Republican government has come to power, they have diverted much of their budget to land reform and welfare efforts, and it is said that many of their higher-ups are distrustful of the high military spending that was present during the Hetmanist era. With these developments, critics of Schleicher's eastern policy seem to have been vindicated.\n\nWe must not forget the leverage we have over Ukraine - after all, they owe their independence to us. Perhaps we should be straightforward, and send over our ambassador to [202.GetName] to demand they ramp up spending on their armed forces."
 newgerfor.76.a: "Of course we should make the demand."
 newgerfor.76.b: "Taking care of foreign budgets are outside of our capabilities anyhow."

 newgerfor.77.t: "Berlin Demands Increased Military Spending"
 newgerfor.77.d: "The German ambassador to Ukraine, Johannes von Welczeck, has come to our Foreign Minister with a demand: to increase our military spending. They predict that our armed forces are insufficient for a proper defence of the country, assuming war with Russia.\n\nFor some time now, our government has diverted funds away from the military and towards land reform and the welfare of Ukraine, so accepting Germany's demands wouldn't be a particularly good look... but at the same time, Germany has considerable leverage over us. Not to mention that right-wing groups have constantly agitated for increased military spending, and this may be a way to get them in line."
 newgerfor.77.a: "We must agree..."
 newgerfor.77.b: "If they lend us the funds, sure."
 newgerfor.77.c: "How about no?"

 newgerfor.78.t: "Ukraine Agrees"
 newgerfor.78.d: "The Ukrainian government has responded positively to our request, and immediately began increasing the budget for their military. While this is clearly a foreign policy victory for Schleicher, it is no doubt a domestic one as well, as those who have criticised his eastern policy are now silenced by his hardline stance."
 newgerfor.78.a: "Good news for both of us!"

 newgerfor.79.t: "Ukraine's Counteroffer"
 newgerfor.79.d: "The Ukrainian government has responded positively to ambassador Welczeck's request. However, they have requested a loan to finance their military development, as they are wary of the consequences if they divert funds away from their land reform and industrialisation programs."
 newgerfor.79.a: "It'll be interest free too!"
 newgerfor.79.b: "Sure."
 newgerfor.79.c: "This is your problem too, you know. Forget about it."

 newgerfor.80.t: "Ukraine Declines"
 newgerfor.80.d: "The Ukrainian government has responded negatively to ambassador Welczeck's request. They also questioned what position we were in to make a request, and stressed that the Ukrainian government will make the decisions necessary on these matters on its own accord, not on that of Berlin. Sadly, critics of Schleicher's eastern policy have only been emboldened by this development."
 newgerfor.80.a: "This is your problem too, you know!"

 newgerfor.81.t: "Ambassador Expelled from Russia"
 newgerfor.81.d: "The international reaction to our military intervention in Poland has been decidedly mixed. Our faithful allies have backed our lawful restoration of order, but elsewhere it has provoked backlash. The strongest response, expectedly, has come from the Russians.\n\nFor Russia, the Polish affair vindicates the narrative that the nations of Eastern Europe have been reduced to servants of a tyrannical German Empire. Boris Savinkov was elected President in large part on a tide of Germanophobia, and ever since, the Russians have frequently criticised our actions and those of our eastern allies on the diplomatic stage. But with the resolution of the Lake Lubahn Incident years earlier, such posturing has remained just that: posturing.\n\nAnd so, it came as quite a shock when Russia announced the expulsion of our embassy this morning. A denouncement from Russia was expected—at this point, even normal—but what was not expected was its strength. The Russian foreign minister declared our operation an \"abhorrent violation of the sovereignty of the Polish people\", and that it proved beyond all doubt that, after 20 years, we have \"irrevocably destroyed peace in Europe\". The foreign minister concluded that the breaking of diplomatic ties was \"the one just choice\", and that only by the withdrawal of German forces from Poland and Eastern Europe as a whole will Russia revisit its position and reinstate our embassy in Moscow.\n\nWhile ties with Russia have not been totally severed, it is hard to grasp the significance of their decision. Now more than ever before, war seems on the horizon... and many understand it will be sooner rather than later."
 newgerfor.81.a: "Rich coming from the ones behind the Weltkrieg."
 RUS_expels_ambassador: "Russia Expels German Ambassador"

 newgerfor.82.t: "Russia Expels Polish Ambassador"
 newgerfor.82.d: "Mere days after Władysław Studnicki was appointed Prime Minister of Poland, there was an unexpected occurrence in Moscow. The Russians had expelled the Polish embassy there, forcing our allies' diplomats to be recalled back to Warsaw.\n\nTheir response is not unexpected, even if the Poles were taken back by the severity of the move just as we were. For years, a far-right Polish exile group, the Polish National Committee, has resided in Moscow and has attempted to influence their homeland's politics from abroad. While Russia does not recognise the group, it has been funded by government officials in the Kremlin who have found a common cause in their anti-German direction.\n\nIt comes as no surprise, then, that Studnicki's appointment has greatly angered Moscow. Overwhelmingly pro-German and anti-Russian, there is little doubt that Studnicki's cabinet will seek to crack down on the nationalist movements in Poland, accusing them to be foreign agents of the National Committee. In a statement justifying the expulsion of the Polish diplomats, the Russian foreign minister referred to Studnicki's appointment as an \"unfriendly gesture towards Russia\" and an \"affront to Polish national sovereignty, encouraged by German military and industrial interests\".\n\nOur attempt to summon the Russian ambassador was refused. The audacity of such a move cannot be understated; just ten years ago, Moscow's dissatisfaction would never be so fierce and open. Times have certainly changed, but as time goes on, it seems conflict with Russia is only becoming more inevitable..."
 newgerfor.82.a: "How dare they intervene in the affairs of our allies?!"

 newgerfor.83.t: "The Future of Ukrainian Democracy"
 newgerfor.83.d: "For two decades, Ukraine has been the dominion of Pavlo Skoropadskyi's Hetmanate. It is not so today, after the nationalist officer coup in the country finally did away with his authoritarian rule — and replaced it with their own.\n\nThe only welcome part of this entire charade is the ascension of General Yevhen Konovalets. Strong-willed and steadfastly loyal to his country, there is little doubt that he will prove a far more capable leader than the old Hetman, as well as a reliable partner to Berlin. The issues mainly lie in the rest of the conspirators; rather than tear down the inefficient and elitist bureaucracy the Hetman had built, they have gone backwards, only cementing the defeat of democracy in Ukraine after the Anti-Hetman Revolt.\n\nOnly one proper conclusion can be drawn from the past and present political developments in their country: centuries of Tsarist oppression have left a mark on the very nature of Ukrainian politics. Where one autocrat comes and goes, another shall take their place. Their ability to foster a truly functioning democracy, at least without external support, is seriously in doubt.\n\nFor now, there is no reason to try to push Ukraine in a more reasonable direction — as long as their cooperation against Russian imperialism is guaranteed, that is. Once that is all said and done, though, perhaps we should revisit that position. Our Ostpolitik has always been pragmatic at heart, but one day we must make an example to the world that the forces of democracy will win out against reactionary tyranny, whether at home or abroad."
 newgerfor.83.a: "It's a shame to be associated with them."

 newgerfor.84.t: "Ideological Exchange with Ukraine"
 newgerfor.84.d: "One of the core tenets of the German conservative movement is that, separate from its ancient roots, a state will naturally enter decay and be led to ruin. The past twenty years of near-uninterrupted liberal rule has shown as much — and this decadency had spread to our eastern client states as well, in one way or another.\n\nThe end of the Anti-Hetman Revolt in Ukraine, however, has finally given us a truly faithful ally. The liberal Otaman-Minister in Ukraine, Dmytro Doroshenko, has been dismissed by the Hetman and replaced by a more rational statesman: Borys Homzyn.\n\nThe Reichskanzler has quickly cultivated a personal and political friendship with Homzyn. In his writings, Homzyn has stressed that the restoration of the Hetmanate, the historical, organic government of Ukraine closest to its roots, was what has given Ukraine success thus far — and in his conversations with the Reichskanzler, he stressed that the same is now occurring in Germany via the conservative revolution. Homzyn views the Zaporozhizhian Sich —  the long forgotten first Ukrainian state, as an ideal which to emulate: a state centred around the Cossack class, with the Hetman being the supreme military and political authority. Likewise, the Reichskanzler's views envision the ideal Germany as one thoroughly connected to the times of old, like under Frederick the Great, where the old Prussian spirit and benevolent aristocracy would guide the state.\n\nIn retrospect, the political situation in Ukraine has greatly mirrored ours; the republican movement in the country has sought to emulate foreign ideals taken from the French Revolution, just as the social democrats and liberals here do. Homzyn's ascension certainly proves one thing: this age of degeneracy is soon to collapse, both here and elsewhere."
 newgerfor.84.a: "Europe is being awakened to its roots."

 newgerfor.85.t: "Germany Demands Annexation"
 newgerfor.85.d: "With the German reconquest of the land surrounding the city state of Riga they have formally requested our annexation into the German Empire proper."

 newgerfor.87.a: "What a stupid idea!"

 newgerfor.88.t: "Nanjing Victorious"
 newgerfor.88.d: "Our advisors in Nanjing have reported to us with good news from China. Despite fears of complete collapse, warlord Qi Xieyuan has finally crushed all dissent in the League of Eight Provinces, preventing the socialist Kuomintang from taking over the region. Xieyuan has stated that he will restore order and stability to China, and it seems that he will use whatever means to do so, even if it means that German businesses will be able to control his economy.\n\nFor the immediate future, we should be able to reap the benefits of this largely unequal relationship - as long as Xieyuan can stay in power, that is."
 newgerfor.88.a: "Good."
 newgerfor.88.a.tt: "You received this event because you took the focus §HThe Second Expedition to China§!."

 newgerfor.89.t: "The Reichspakt Moves Into Courland"
 newgerfor.89.d: "In the early morning, the Lithuanian 11th Infantry Division, supported by the motorised units of the German III. Armeekorps crossed north into the Latvian region of Courland. From Riga, a Baltic German division crossed south, and with assistance from allied forces, captured the city of Jelgava. All of Latvia behind the Daugava river was now controlled by German forces and their allies.\n\nThese actions came after the city-state of Riga's government requested a call for help to establish defensive positions in the wake of the Russian invasion of Latvia. Without them, Riga would have been encircled by Russian forces, which would put a huge wrench in the Ostwall plans.\n\nFears that the incursions into Courland would draw the Russians into seemed to be vindicated, as Russian forces began massing on the Daugava just when defensive positions were beginning to be established. After a short standoff, however, it seems that the operation is successful, and that peace shall remain - for now."
 newgerfor.89.a: "Another Baltic crisis is resolved."

 newgerfor.90.t: "The Germans Move Into Courland"
 newgerfor.90.d: "News has reached us that Germany has moved units into southern Latvia, proclaiming the operation was to 'protect' its citizens from the danger of invasion. This is obviously a setback, but in due time we will get our revenge for this defiance."
 newgerfor.90.a: "So be it."

 gerfor.67.d: "The Germans have been defeated by the syndicalist usurpers. While there are those who argue it was their fault that the syndicalists control Europe, they are now in the same position as we were just a few years ago and they have sent a delegation to the [Root.GetAdjective] government asking to become part of the Entente - promising that any disputes between Germany and Entente members regarding territory or colonies can be handled once Europe is regained. What do we say?"

 gerfor.80.d: "Entangled in a war for its survival, the German Empire has reopened negotiations concerning the permanent presence of our empire in the Reichspakt, their military alliance. Although the people are exhausted from years of war, there still remains a strong pro-German sentiment amongst the ruling class and a desire to stand side by side with the victors of the new order.\n\nNonetheless our empire does not intend to sell its skin cheaply and has demanded that the Caucasus, traditionally part of the Ottoman sphere, be restored to its control and that Azerbaijan becomes more tightly connected to the Sublime Porte. Although angered by our demands, it nonetheless seems like the German government is willing to consider the cost if it leads to the strengthening of their Southern Flank."
