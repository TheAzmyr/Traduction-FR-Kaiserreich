##New Denmark ideas##
 DEN_idea_danish_arty: "Improved Range Finders"

### Focuses ###
 DEN_black_monday: "Black Monday Hits Denmark!"
 DEN_black_monday_desc: "The market crash of the Berlin Stock Exchange has crippled most sectors of the Danish economy. Fortunately much of our economy is based on agriculture, meaning by cleaning up the non-agricultural excesses we could possibly contain the crisis with quick government intervention and the arrival of harvesting season to revitalise the farming industry."
 DEN_agricultural_surplus: "Purchase Agricultural Surplus"
 DEN_agricultural_surplus_desc: "By injecting money into our home agricultural market, we'd ensure domestic food production continues and farmers can keep the economy moving with their increased purchasing power."
 DEN_buy_out_stock_market: "Buy Out the Stock Market"
 DEN_buy_out_stock_market_desc: "The German Stock Market crash didn't happen in isolation, markets in Europe and abroad are falling, but that presents us with an opportunity: the companies are now cheap to buy, which we can use to provide full employment with government funds."
 DEN_bail_out_industries: "Bail Out Failing Industries"
 DEN_bail_out_industries_desc: "Industry is the greatest employer of our time, providing jobs for the greatest share of population in Denmark. These companies failing and closing shop is not an option for us right now, having the workers go by without salaries could not only worsen the current crisis, but have them fall into the arms of extremist ideologues."
 DEN_kanslergaden: "Kanslergaden Agreement"
 DEN_kanslergaden_desc: "Unfortunately the Danish upper house, the 'Landsting' is controlled by the opposition, rendering the government's efforts without opposition support hamstrung. If we are to mount an effective response to the hardships Black Monday brings with it, we shall have to work with them: let us invite the opposition leaders to Stauning's apartment at Kanslergaden."
 DEN_schachtian_tactics: "Schachtian Economics"
 DEN_schachtian_tactics_desc: "The German economist Hjalmar Schacht has developed a theory to combat economic upheaval by having the government spend money during such crises, bringing more money in the market which in turn softens its impact. We should adopt these doctrines, as it is clear that the crisis is too rough for us to just rely on the free market."
 DEN_desanction_lockouts: "Ban Lockouts and Strikes"
 DEN_desanction_lockouts_desc: "Constant employer-employee conflicts are harsh on our economy: because of the lack of profit due to black monday, employers try to lower the wages, and when employees don't accept this, they simply close the factory until they submit. Conversely, when the employees protest against their conditions, they strike. Both should be banned for a temporary period, until we can afford it."
 DEN_agreement_with_germany: "Bolster Trade Relations with Germany"
 DEN_agreement_with_germany_desc: "With Britain incinerating in the fires of revolution, Germany, and in a wider form Mitteleuropa have developed into our main trading partners. Part of the issue is that our goods are too expensive in these markets. This could possibly be resolved by erasing the few trade limitations still in place and receiving permission to support our own farmers over Germans in return for other concessions."
 DEN_devalue_the_krona: "Devalue the Krone"
 DEN_devalue_the_krona_desc: "Part of the problem is that Danish agricultural products are simply too expensive for the crisis-ridden Germans. By artificially lowering the value of the Krone in relation to the Mark it will be cheaper for the German market to buy Danish produce compared to other agricultural options."
 DEN_public_works: "Public Works and Projects"
 DEN_public_works_desc: "By spending our money on public works we can employ people that would otherwise be unemployed, meaning they have some money to spend which in turn will bring back life to the market. As a cherry on top we will also be able to improve our infrastructure at a relatively low cost."
 DEN_state_funded_industry: "State Funded Industrialisation"
 DEN_state_funded_industry_desc: "During the aftermath of Black Monday most people lost their savings, be it caused by the contraction of the economy or the failing stock prices. Not so the state of Denmark, which can reactivate the economy, produce the tools and products people need and create new jobs for all with a programme of rapid industrialisation and heavy investing."
 DEN_steinckes_reforms: "Steincke's Reforms"
 DEN_steinckes_reforms_desc: "Our minister Karl Kristian Steincke has had several extensive reforms to the Danish welfare state planned, but was so far unable to implement them due to the oppositions unwillingness to support it. Now, with access to a majority in the Landsting and as part of the agreement, this may be implemented, and it will likely change the world's perception of Denmark forever."
 DEN_invalidity_subs: "Invalidity Subsidies"
 DEN_invalidity_subs_desc: "Those who are unable to work due to a medical condition should be supported by the government. It does not fit a civilised state to let their sick and crippled die of starvation if they don't have a family when such a calamity can be avoided."
 DEN_extended_unempl_subs: "Unemployment Benefits"
 DEN_extended_unempl_subs_desc: "Many in Denmark have found themselves to be unemployed due to Black Monday. Earlier it would have been private insurance that would have taken this function, but the spike in unemployment has increased the premium to such a degree that few can still afford it. It is the government's duty to create a safety net."
 DEN_universal_healthcare: "Universal Healthcare"
 DEN_universal_healthcare_desc: "Naturally ensuring the health of all is a primary objective of a full Social Democratic state. Medicine has been historically prohibitively expensive for the common worker, but with the funds the state has it'd be feasible to construct newer hospitals and employ more medical personnel, using the increased size of the healthcare sector to procure more beneficial contracts with suppliers."
 DEN_twinkling_socdem: "A Twinkling Welfare State"
 DEN_twinkling_socdem_desc: "Full employment and ensuring the well-being of all the people, we strived and achieved our short-term objectives with our policies, but we must continue to provide a shining example of what Social Democracy can achieve."
 DEN_madsen_mygdal_plan: "The Madsen-Mygdal Plan"
 DEN_madsen_mygdal_plan_desc: "Named after the leader of Venstre, Thomas Madsen-Mygdal, the Madsen-Mygdal plan calls for a reticent approach of the government, focusing on austerity and fiscal responsibility instead of the social democratic approach that is bound to just leave Denmark in debt."
 DEN_strengthening_investor_confidence: "Boost Investor Confidence"
 DEN_strengthening_investor_confidence_desc: "By supporting our companies and maintaining our balance, we shall show potential investors that Denmark is one of the safest countries to invest in, even in this turbulent time. The financial injection into the market that will hopefully follow shall help us carry ourselves out of the crisis in time."
 DEN_loan_to_danish_companies: "Loans to Danish Companies"
 DEN_loan_to_danish_companies_desc: "By giving loans directly from the treasury to Danish companies, we will be able to support them and allow them to bridge this time of economic uncertainty hopefully mostly unscathed, despite the fact that some of the loans will likely never be paid back."
 DEN_strengthen_the_krona: "Strengthen the Krone"
 DEN_strengthen_the_krona_desc: "By strengthening the backing of our currency and thus increasing its value, we will further emphasise the stable nature of the Danish economy. In addition, it will make imports cheaper making many products more affordable to the common man."
 DEN_encourage_foreign_investment: "Encourage Foreign Investment"
 DEN_encourage_foreign_investment_desc: "We should encourage foreigners to invest in Denmark now that we have shown that this is a safe investment. With their investments, money will enter the Danish economy which will help us recover from the crisis that hit us like a bus."
 DEN_increase_tax_rate: "Increase Tax Rates"
 DEN_increase_tax_rate_desc: "We can't maintain a balance without some form of action: as a growing segment of the population is unemployed the tax returns have been drastically lowered. To compensate for this we should raise the rates lest we incur a large amount of debt."
 DEN_austerity_measures: "Austerity Measures"
 DEN_austerity_measures_desc: "We cannot maintain the balance with taxes alone: at some point these taxes will simply have a negative effect on the economy and prolong its hardship after all: therefore it is important that we limit our expenses as well."
 DEN_cut_subs: "Cut Subsidies"
 DEN_cut_subs_desc: "Subsidies particularly are expenses with very limited returns: after all the money invested in these people does not find its way back to the treasury through some sort of revenue and in addition they discourage people from working. They should be drastically cut in the interest of everyone involved."
 DEN_encourage_unempl_insurance: "Private Unemployment Insurance"
 DEN_encourage_unempl_insurance_desc: "By supporting unemployment insurance we can ensure that the premiums do not rise to such extremes as had been happening in the last months, without having to resort to undue government interference or expenses giving subsidies ourselves. We should definitely support this business!"
 DEN_limit_union_activity: "Limit Union Activities"
 DEN_limit_union_activity_desc: "Syndicalists are a major factor in the limitation of the market economy. It should speak for itself that by limiting the activity of unions the owners of the factories will be able to cut the costs more efficiently and thus move us to recovery faster. It is in the common man's interest as well!"
 DEN_healthy_dose_of_capitalism: "The Healthy Dose of Capitalism"
 DEN_healthy_dose_of_capitalism_desc: "Our emphasis on the free market is slowly letting the economy recover. Recent times have been tough but the worst is over now and while we have not fully recovered yet, it appears we are already seeing the results of our sound economic policy."
 DEN_recovery: "Black Monday is Over!"
 DEN_recovery_desc: "Through our sound economic policy Denmark has fully recovered from Black Monday. With unemployment down and earnings as well as public confidence back at pre-crisis levels, few can argue that the government did a poor job dealing with the events that were."
 DEN_invest_in_maersk: "Invest in Maersk"
 DEN_invest_in_maersk_desc: "The Maersk company was founded in 1904 and has a strong presence over all Danish shipping. By investing into the company we should be able to stimulate more trade by expanding the merchant fleet and infrastructure in the country."
 DEN_support_nordisk_film: "Support Nordisk Film"
 DEN_support_nordisk_film_desc: "Nordisk film is one of the oldest cinema companies in the world. By investing into the company they should be able to create more and better movies. While also making movies that support Denmark and its current government hopefully allowing us to get greater support from the people."
 DEN_reinvigorate_danish_cinema: "Reinvigorate Danish Cinema"
 DEN_reinvigorate_danish_cinema_desc: "Our support of the cinema seems to have worked stellarly. Its time that we expanded our operations dedicating time and money for advertisement of the great Danish cinema. We can also use this as a chance to headline a new movie about the ever watchful Danish military protecting its people from harm."
 DEN_enlarge_industry: "Consumer Industry Expansion"
 DEN_enlarge_industry_desc: "With the revolutions in Britain and France, America's decline, and our position inside of Mitteleuropa; Denmark has seen a sharp decline in the availability of basic consumer goods to most of our population, by increasing our basic industrial production we can alleviate our deficit if not remove it."
 DEN_Fyn_Development: "Funen Land Reform Project"
 DEN_Fyn_Development_desc: "Funen, while being the third largest island in our country and in the centre of our nation, is almost completely agricultural and rural in nature. Through extensive land reform and deforestation, Funen will begin to industrialise to meet the remainder of Denmark."
 DEN_Jutland_Development: "Jutland Industrial Development"
 DEN_Jutland_Development_desc: "Its no secret that Danish industry is small compared to other countries in part because of our size. While Zealand itself is very industrialised Jutland still has plenty of room to exploit so by sponsoring constructions of new factories we should hopefully be able to increase industrial output in the region."
 DEN_Jutland_Highway: "Jutland Highway Project"
 DEN_Jutland_Highway_desc: "With the rise of industry in Jutland it has found itself in need of more infrastructure to support it and the growing needs of the region. So we shall dedicate time and money to expanding the already good infrastructure of the area to hopefully support our other efforts in the area."
 DEN_expand_kastrup: "Expand Kastrup"
 DEN_expand_kastrup_desc: "The Kastrup airport is still relatively new however it is pridefully considered the first civil airport in the world and as of recently has seen huge activity. With its large growth in popularity around the world we should expand the airport to help accommodate the new demand that's grown for its services. "
 DEN_improve_sjaelland_infra: "Improve Sjælland's Infrastructure"
 DEN_improve_sjaelland_infra_desc: "With new projects and expansions being sponsored around the country attention finally shifted to Zealand. With the increase of economic activity industry in the capitol region needed to be improved to help with shipping of goods and transportation to and from Jutland. "
 DEN_support_the_tiftp: "Support the Institute for Theoretical Physics"
 DEN_support_the_tiftp_desc: "Founded in 1921 the Institute for Theoretical Physics of Copenhagen University is a beacon of science across europe spearheading research into Atomic and Quantum physics. Lead by the famous Niels Bohr most scientists in europe have visited the institute to learn from Bohr and his studies. If we supported the institute hopefully they could expand their operations and conduct more higher quality tests. "
 DEN_fund_the_copenhagen_university: "Fund the Copenhagen University"
 DEN_fund_the_copenhagen_university_desc: "Much like the Institute of Theoretical Physics the University of Copenhagen is a centre of knowledge and learning. By funding and supporting the university at large they should be able to expand and take in more students hopefully allowing more highly skilled scientists and engineers to come from their university and into Denmark. "
 DEN_expand_belt_ferry: "Expand the Belt Ferry"
 DEN_expand_belt_ferry_desc: "The Great Belt ferries connect the many islands of Zealand together and allow automobile and trains to travel across the islands. However there have been many complaints about the ferries mostly due to not being able to handle the amount of traffic coming through. So by expanding the ferries across Zealand and into Jutland we should be able to help alleviate the demand that has formed and provide better access through our country."
 DEN_bridge_designs: "Designs for a Bridge"
 DEN_bridge_designs_desc: "With the growing issues of Ferries some people have been asking for bridges to connect Denmark together. However we do not have the means to construct such a bridge, but it could be a better solution in the end hopefully by sponsoring research into construction we should be able to design a workable blueprint and methods for such bridges."
 DEN_Military_Industry: "Encourage Military Industry"

 DEN_bring_haere_to_20th_cent_desc: "Our army is woefully out of date, without many standards of modern war like machine guns, and couldn't put up a fight if Denmark was invaded.

 DEN_focus_on_defensive: "Focus on the Defensive"
 DEN_focus_on_defensive_desc: "Denmark has always been proud of its neutrality and our small size would prevent any major military attacks against our enemies.

 DEN_fortify_jutland: "Fortify Jutland"
 DEN_fortify_jutland_desc: "We shall move to strengthen our land border in Jutland. By utilising the narrow front we should be able to put up an effective defence from an invasion by land especially with further expansions in the years to come."
 DEN_fortress_sjaelland: "Fortress Sjælland"
 DEN_fortress_sjaelland_desc: "Now that Jutland and Fyn have been fortified we can turn our focus to our capital.

We must endeavour to turn Sjælland into a fortress to repulse any possible invasion and to defend the heart of our country."
 DEN_fortress_fyn: "Fortify Fyn"
 DEN_fortress_fyn_desc: "Fyn is the stepping stone to both our capital and industrial heart. With fortifications placed at key strategic locations across the island we can ensure that Sjælland will always remain out of reach until it falls."

 DEN_doctrinal_guidance: "Doctrinal Guidance"
 DEN_doctrinal_guidance_desc: "In order to help with the modernisation of our army we've hired a foreign advisor who has given valuable advice on the structuring of our tactical doctrine that has severely helped our general staff develop new tactics for war."
 DEN_doctrinal_advancements: "Conduct War Games"
 DEN_doctrinal_advancements_desc: "War games are more than peacetime entertainment for generals, they allow us to test both true and tested and revolutionary tactics without wasting countless lives. This allows us to complete our theoretical discoveries."
 DEN_equipment_upgrades: "Equipment Modernisation"
 DEN_equipment_upgrades_desc: "For a long time, military breakthroughs were slow, and having a good bolt-action rifle was enough. However, these rifles of the 19th Century are completely out of place on post-Weltkrieg battlefield. We must stop being complacent and get new equipment."
 DEN_motorisation_focus: "Invest in Motorisation"
 DEN_motorisation_focus_desc: "While the rest of our army has undergone major reforms logistics in the army have yet to be changed. By investing into motorisation we can hasten logistics and also use them to quickly redeploy troops around the country in case of a naval invasion."
 DEN_legged_infantry: "Leg Infantry Shall Do!"
 DEN_legged_infantry_desc: "While some have been considering the idea of using motorisation for logistics and for possibly a form of mechanised infantry we believe that due to the size of our country we can focus on improving our standard infantry instead with better supplies and tactics to make up for a less mobile force. "
 DEN_unconventional_warfare: "Unconventional Warfare"
 DEN_unconventional_warfare_desc: "Denmark will never raise an army that is capable of challenging hegemonic powers like France and Germany even to the extend of merely dissuading them from invading Denmark; our population is simply too small. We should invest in a specialised special force that will be able to strike anywhere."
 DEN_form_jaegerkorpset: "Form the Jægerkorps"
 DEN_form_jaegerkorpset_desc: "Jæger corps have existed in some form since 1785 as Denmark's elite special forces. By establishing an official Jægerkorpset command, we shall make anyone thinking about messing with Denmark think twice."
 DEN_reestablish_marineregimentet: "Reestablish the Marineregiment"
 DEN_reestablish_marineregimentet_desc: "By establishing a special training of marine regiments we can start recruiting specialised amphibious divisions that are capable of doing extraction operations or that can prepare a larger invasion anywhere by securing a position on the ground."
 DEN_reestablish_faldskaermregimentet: "Establish the Faldskærmregiment"
 DEN_reestablish_faldskaermregimentet_desc: "A new form of warfare is that of parachutists. By dropping these specially trained forces behind the enemy lines we can wreak havoc and potentially turn a losing front into a winning one."
 DEN_better_terrain: "All Terrain Soldiers"
 DEN_better_terrain_desc: "The Danish Army must be prepared to engage the enemy no matter the location. By having our soldiers endure long periods of training and isolation they have become resistant to all but the most deadly of conditions Earth has to offer."
 DEN_more_special_forces: "Expanded Special Forces Trainings"
 DEN_more_special_forces_desc: "While the Danish army maybe small no one can claim they are not the best of the elite. By expanding our soldiers training routines they will both grow in size and gain the ability to truly operate in any condition."
 DEN_surprise_element: "The Element of Surprise"
 DEN_surprise_element_desc: "No one expects it, when Danish forces suddenly appear behind them. By leveraging this element of surprise we can and will be victorious in front line situations that would otherwise be doomed due to our limited military size."
 DEN_expand_the_army_airforce: "Expand the Air Force on Land"
 DEN_expand_the_army_airforce_desc: "The Hærens Flyvertroppen is the most recently created branch of our armed forces, and still in much need of further expansion. After all it is vital that we can defend our skies overland, lest our troops find themselves in the situation where they are unable to mount a significant defence because they are by shot at from the sky."
 DEN_invest_in_bombers: "Prioritise Bombers"
 DEN_invest_in_bombers_desc: "Our best bet is to cripple the enemy by bombing their industry to ruin. This will give us the small edge that may change the tide of any war and potentially saving us from serving as the vassal of a hegemonic power rising in Europe."
 DEN_support_on_the_battlefield: "Support on the Battlefield"

 DEN_invest_in_fighter: "Focus on Fighters"
 DEN_invest_in_fighter_desc: "If we fail to invest in fighters, we will soon find that our bombers will fail to reach their target and that our skies will soon be ruled by the enemy instead. We should instead invest in agile fighter planes that will allow us to defend our sovereign airspace."
 DEN_rule_the_skies: "Secure Aerial Dominance"

 DEN_conventional_airforce: "Conventional Air Force"
 DEN_conventional_airforce_desc: "The difference in our two branches are rather unconventional. By bringing them more together we can ensure that our aerial assets will be able to act with the same efficiency as other air forces, if not better."
 DEN_establish_flyvevabnet: "Establish the Flyvevåben"
 DEN_establish_flyvevabnet_desc: "We should unite the Hærens Flyvertroppen and the Marinens Flyvevæsen into a single new air force branch in our nation.

 DEN_expand_the_navy_airforce: "Expand the Air Force Above the Seas"
 DEN_expand_the_navy_airforce_desc: "We should primarily support the Marinens Flyvevæsen. Without air support our navy would be left sitting ducks against any enemy that does invest in this kind of warfare, and in a country like Denmark, divided by bodies of water, this is a potentially highly dangerous disposition."
 DEN_build_aircraft_carrier: "Pursue the Hangarskib"
 DEN_build_aircraft_carrier_desc: "Imagine the range of influence we'd have if we could produce an aircraft carrier. Denmark would be able to make its influence count on the world stage; we should construct such a gargantuan ship as the pride of our navy."
 DEN_invest_naval_bombers: "Invest in Naval Bombers"
 DEN_invest_naval_bombers_desc: "Naval bombers would be superb in supporting our naval forces in battle. By investing in them, we can ensure that our enemies will always have to keep their eyes in the sky, lest they find themselves hit by the bombs these bombers drop."
 DEN_carrierbased_planes: "Carrier Based Aircraft"
 DEN_carrierbased_planes_desc: "In order to be able to send our airplanes to operate from the carrier, some key technical amendments will have to be implemented. We shall have to invest in these elements because not doing so would render the carrier we are pursuing useless."
 DEN_modernize_Sovaernet: "Modernise the Søværn"
 DEN_modernize_Sovaernet_desc: "The Danish navy, Søværnet, has not been updated in a while, yet it becomes evermore needed because of the rising global tension.

 DEN_proper_surface_fleet: "A Proper Surface Fleet"
 DEN_proper_surface_fleet_desc: "The Danish fleet needs to operate properly at the surface level, otherwise we will not be able to compare with the enemy. A fleet not focused on destroying the enemy fleet will intimidate or deter no potential foe from invading Denmark."
 DEN_acquire_battleship: "Acquire a 'Slagskib'"
 DEN_acquire_battleship_desc: "We should invest in a battleship to lead the Danish navy on. One large admiral's vessel will ensure that few if anyone will consider the Danish navy a joke. The presence of the battleship surrounded by the smaller vessels of our navy shall intimidate them all."
 DEN_proper_screening: "Safeguard the Pride of Our Navy"
 DEN_proper_screening_desc: "Our new vessel is the pride of our navy and must be nurtured: imagine the morale hit if something were to happen with it. Fortunately, the existing Danish navy composed of smaller ships is available to defend our pride, but reinforcing their numbers can never hurt."
 DEN_submarine_fleet: "The Danish Ubåd"
 DEN_submarine_fleet_desc: "We need to face the reality that Denmark is simply too small, both in population and economy, to maintain a fleet that confront Sweden, let alone Germany or the syndicalist Britons. By investing in submarines, however, we will have the capacity to at least create a risk of heavy losses, hopefully deterring them from attacking us, at a relatively low cost."
 DEN_harass_tradelanes: "Harassing Tradelanes"
 DEN_harass_tradelanes_desc: "Tradelanes are vulnerable to our sub-surface vessels preying on their ships. By attacking convoys we can inflict relatively significant economic damage on the enemy in relatively low risk operation, which could end up winning us the war."
 DEN_one_submarine_a_time: "One Sub at a Time"
 DEN_one_submarine_a_time_desc: "Group attacks do not work with submarines, it would only render it easier for the enemy to catch up with them.

 DEN_kings_cabinet: "The King's Cabinet"
 DEN_kings_cabinet_desc: "It is the king's right, no, duty by the constitution to protect the Danish people when their democratic government is about to make a mistake that will destroy the nation: if Germany were defeated Denmark would find itself doomed to fall to the zealots in France and Britain, everyone knows they shall be here to subject the Danes to syndicalist tyranny!"

 DEN_danish_democracy: "Danmarks Demokrati"
 DEN_danish_democracy_desc: "The road to democracy in Denmark has been a long and tedious one, and even today the monarch affords himself rights that some might say are not appropriate for the role he is supposed to fill, but today our democracy is in a decent state.

 DEN_encourage_voting_desc: "While Denmark already has an active democracy with invariably high turnout in parliamentary elections, other smaller elections, such as local elections and plebiscites suffer from less significant turnouts leaving our constitution, which can only be amended through use of the latter, hardly amendable. We should push voters to go to the polls just a bit more."
 DEN_constitutional_referendum: "The Constitutional Referendum"
 DEN_constitutional_referendum_desc: "The desire has risen to amend the Danish constitution to replace the Danish lower house, the 'Landsting' with a new 'Rigsting' that may be united with the Folketing under certain circumstances, and to lower the electoral age from 25 to 23 years old. As per the constitutional amendment procedure however, the issue needs to be placed in the hands of the Danish people by plebiscite."
 DEN_republican_future: "A Republican Future"
 DEN_republican_future_desc: "The king has failed: in his narrow-minded lust for power he broke with tradition and used the reserve powers that survived from a different era to force Denmark in a direction the Danish people did not desire. This has revealed that the monarchy is an outdated concept from a different era that needs to be abolished."
 DEN_modern_government: "A Modern Government"
 DEN_modern_government_desc: "It is a reversal, to suddenly not have a lineage traceable to the ancient vikings as the face of our nation, but we must conclude that it is an outdated institution not fitting with the direction of the world. With this new modern government, we shall prosper!"

 DEN_model_monarchy: "A Model Monarchy"
 DEN_model_monarchy_desc: "The Danish monarchy is an example for the world: by carefully combining the tenets of tradition and the liberal ideas that were once propagated by the French revolution (that is the one in 1789, not 1919) we have created perhaps the most pure of governments possible."
 DEN_pride_in_traditions: "Pride in our Traditions"

 DEN_statsraad_regime_desc: "The situation has been dire. With conflict having arisen with Germany, perhaps through poor posturing, the commune was our only option and unsurprisingly they made demands.

 DEN_ban_venstre_and_dkf_desc: "With our democracy taking the shape of a trade union, we should ensure that market liberal and socially conservative elements affiliated to Venstre and the DKF shall be disenfranchised. It is the only way to oblige to France's terms."
 DEN_discourage_monarchism: "Discourage Monarchism"
 DEN_discourage_monarchism_desc: "Monarchism has long been ingrained in Danish society, but we cannot combine it with the syndicalist-esque system that circumstances formed it to build. It is best to help the people forget about this institution and accept the facts of life."
 DEN_limit_private_property: "Limit Private Property"

 DEN_socialize_large_companies_desc: "This plan has already in part been planned and executed by the Social Democratic government in the 1920s and '30s. We will have to take it a bit further however to convince our allies that we will not fall back to plutocratic involvement."

 DEN_KR_gathering_storm_desc: "Denmark exists under the shadow of Berlin. Its relation with the new hegemon of the world is ancient and has often been hostile, even as recently as 1864, which resulted in the loss of Slesvig to the Germans. Yet, in 1936, ties are warm and Denmark, by grace of having remained neutral in the Weltkrieg, maintains its sovereignty in full. Under the guiding hand of the popular social democratic prime minister Thorvald Stauning, Denmark has been profiting from German economic prosperity. Domestically, the future looks bright, but internationally, clouds are gathering. Some fear Denmark will be in the wrong place at the wrong time..."

### Intro Screen ###
 DEN_country_intro_header: "Denmark in 1936"
 DEN_country_intro_content: "Denmark remained neutral in the Weltkrieg, but at a great cost: it had to yield to its German neighbour when they demanded it mine its territorial waters. German influence over Danish society and government did not wane once the war was over, however, and Denmark soon found itself incorporated into the German Mitteleuropa economic system at its foundation.\n\nWhile Denmark profited from the German boom in the 1920s, the Radical Left had reorganised itself into the 'Kommunistisk Føderation' (Communist Federation) while the Social Democrats of the charismatic Thorvald Stauning, who, barring a hiatus between December 1926 and April 1929, served as prime minister consecutively since 1924. Stauning's dream of a Danish welfare state has not be materialised yet however, since the Danish upper house, Landstinget, which has been under the control of the conservatives (KF) for all this time, has continued to block any such motions. Many wonder what the future will hold for Denmark: will it find itself practically reduced to a German client state? Or will this tiny Nordic country secure a future for itself as new forces rise to challenge the international establishment?"

### Events ###
 den.2.t: "Black Monday hits Denmark"
 den.2.d: "The Stock Crisis on the Berlin Stock Exchange has rapidly rippled throughout Europe, and has naturally hit Denmark as well. Investors are panicking at Børsen and the crisis is hurting other sectors as well. Fortunately, a large part of the Danish economy is based on agriculture, which means we could possibly contain the crisis by simply having the government buy up stocks; and surely the shockwaves of this crash will have withered out when it's harvesting time for our farmers?!"
 den.2.a: "And even if not, everyone needs to eat!"

 den.3.t: "Workers strike"
 den.3.d: "In response to the hardships the Danish economy has been hit by, lots of people got laid off. Worrying for their own jobs, workers in one of Denmark's major companies have started a strike, seeking an arrangement with the bosses to ensure job security."
 den.3.a: "Let them strike!"
 den.3.b: "Compromise!"
 den.3.c: "Drive them back to the workplaces!"

 den.4.t: "Unrest from the Far Left"
 den.4.d: "Large marches have been held today by the so-called 'Kommunistisk Føderation', led by the prominent syndicalist Christian Christensen. This collection of radical left wing parties stands for Syndicalism, with many of its leaders affiliated with the infamous 'storm at Børsen' assault on the Copenhagen Stock Exchange, who are directly being supported by Paris. Following the fallout of Black monday, they happily point out how in the Commune, there is no crisis, arguing for a syndicalist system in Denmark.\n\nAlthough there have been a few instances of violence where the police could intervene, especially there where the small Totalist wing of this organisation, led by former social democrat Martin Andersen Nexø, was involved, most marches remained peaceful, possibly in the hope of provoking police action where it wasn't needed. Within the boundaries of the constitution, there is little we can do."
 den.4.a: "Syndicalism? In Denmark?"

 den.5.t: "The Clash between DS and the DFP"
 den.5.d: "Ever since the establishment of Danmarks Folkerepublikanske Parti (People's Republican Party of Denmark) by Max Arildskov after his personal friend Boris Savinkov's NRPR in 1935, the far-right of the Danish political spectrum has been hopelessly divided. Prior to the establishment of the DFP, the Dansk Samling (Danish Unity) ruled here, but as much as their policies may seem similar, they could hardly be more divided; where the DS supports the monarchy and calls for supporting Germany at least until Syndicalism has been purged from the continent, the DFP accepts no compromise over the German occupation of Slesvig-Holsten and openly antagonises Germany over it. In addition, they are republican in nature contrary to the DS. It is clear that only Arildskov, the so-called 'Danish Codreanu', could've torn open this fringe part of the Danish political scene, but considering the size of the pond they're fishing from, these events are more likely to harm the Danish far-right than to do it any good."
 den.5.a: "The DS remains in the lead here."
 den.5.b: "The DFP is rising..."

 den.6.t: "Arildskov visits the Vozhd"
 den.6.d: "Max Arildskov, former volunteer fighter in the Russian Civil War and so-called 'Fører' of the Savinkovite People's Republican Party of Denmark has visited his colleague Boris Savinkov in Moscow. In his meeting he congratulated the 'Vozhd' with his newfound greater power in the Russian Republic and used the opportunity the harden his stance on the German and syndicalist influence in Denmark.\n\nWhile it may not amount to much, some people do seem suspectible to his words and his Russian ally's success and we do see a small growth in his movement, even if it is still barely enough to win a seat or two in the Folketing in the coming elections. The Dansk Samling is probably worried however, being the main pool of support for the party of the 'Fører'."
 den.6.a: "'Fører'? It sounds so dumb..."

 den.7.t: "Troubling Reports at the Farms"
 den.7.d: "Danish Agriculture is the backbone of the Danish economy, and while this may have limited the effects of the stock collapse, troubling reports are surfacing. Contrary to our expectations, the free economies of Europe have not recovered from the shock of Black Monday, and consequently, food prices are much lower than usual. As a result, a lot of food remains either unsold or is sold at a loss, meaning that many farmers risk an inability to pay for their mortgages and therefore are liable to foreclosure of their farms. And even beyond that, the fact that they have fewer funds means that they can't buy as much from other sectors of the Danish economy as before..."
 den.7.a: "This might be bad..."

 den.9.t: "Farm Foreclosures"
 den.9.d: "As expected, many farmers can no longer keep up with their loans, forcing the bank to sell their farms in impromptu auctions that are usually being bought up by large landowners who have the reserves to buy these plots of land, making the whole deal even more painful to the farmers. Many voices are raising in the government to relieve the farmers, but can we afford to do it?"
 den.9.a: "Relieve them as soon as possible!"
 den.9.b: "Such is the free market!"

 den.11.t: "General Farmer's Strike"
 den.11.d: "Across the country, farmers have entered into a farmer's strike. Recognising that the low prices are forcing them to sell their farms, they hold off on selling their produce to force the prices to rise again. While this initiative is commendable, it hurts non-farmers immensely, who often have been hit by the crisis by now as well, who can't afford to buy their bread anymore."
 den.11.a: "Give concessions to stop the strike!"
 den.11.b: "We'll just have to tire them out!"
 den.11.c: "Break this 'Farmer's strike'!"

 den.12.t: "Farmer's Strike stands fast"
 den.12.d: "Despite our unwillingness to give them further relief, the farmers are resilient. They don't budge and still hope to force the food prices up so they can maintain their farms."
 den.12.a: "It is time for us to give in!"
 den.12.b: "It's almost done, I assure you!"
 den.12.c: "We should've broken this long ago!"

 den.13.t: "Farmer's Strike subsides"
 den.13.d: "As a result of the farmer's strike, the foodprices have risen somewhat, but not nearly as much as the farmers would've liked. They probably also hoped that the government would give them relief, but neither did this come. As more and more farms are expropriated by the banks, more and more farmers give in and sell their goods with the new marketprice that has stabilised. And since this has caused it to shrink again, this process is only being accelerated."
 den.13.a: "That's good, I guess..."

 den.14.t: "1936 Landsting Elections"
 den.14.d: "The 1936 landsting elections for the Danish upperhouse have come. Since 1870, no Danish government has held a majority in both chambers of the rigsdag, so it would be a major upset if the coalition would now be able to seize the moment. And surprising, considering the economic state Denmark is in at the moment."
 den.14.a: "Stauning does it again!"
 den.14.b: "The Opposition maintains control."

 den.15.t: "Kanslergade Agreement."
 den.15.d: "This morning, representatives from the Venstre Party arrived at Thorvald Stauning's apartment at Kanslergade 10, meeting with Stauning and representatives of the ruling coalition. It is clear the results of black monday will require a greater effort than just buying up stocks to stabilise the Børsen exchange, now that Denmark's agriculture has been hit, but the government does not have the mandate in the Landsting, meaning no measures would ever come through without an agreement with the liberals. The whole day was spent viciously arguing over the details, but in the evening, possibly after some drinks..."
 den.15.a: "... the Venstre representatives signed."
 den.15.b: "... it was concluded no agreement could be reached."

 den.16.t: "The Government falls"
 den.16.d: "It would be an understatement to say that prime minister Stauning was demoralised by his inability to gain an agreement; he has been contemplating leaving politics behind forever. However today, the choice was made for him, as the social liberal party, Radikale Venstre, left the coalition. They argue action would need to be taken to relieve the Danish people from black monday, and if that needs to be the Austerity Programme of the conservative opposition, then that's preferable to taking no action at all. Det Radikale Venstre formed an alliance with the KF and Venstre the same week, kickstarting the second Madsen-Mygdal cabinet, with the Socialdemokraterne reduced to the opposition."
 den.16.a: "So be it."

 den.17.t: "Establishment of the Rigspolitiet"
 den.17.d: "Today the Rigspolitiet (Realm Police) started operations. This new organisation will serve henceforth as the uppermost level of Danish police, being under the command of a single national 'rigspolitichefen' - chief of police. This reform will be sure to streamline the Danish police apparatus for years to come, aiding the efficiency of our law enforcement and securing the law with an additional layer."
 den.17.a: "... in addition it creates jobs."

 den.18.t: "Birth of Princess Margrethe"
 den.18.d: "Joyous news from the royal family today: crown prince Frederick and his wife Ingrid of Sweden announced that their first child has been born; Margrethe. The Danish constitution does not allow for women to inherit the throne however, so experts consider it unlikely she will some day be queen of Denmark. For now however, it is time to feast, for the royal family has received its newest member."
 den.18.a: "Hurrah!"

 den.19.t: "Opening of the Storstrøm Bridge"
 den.19.d: "After 4 years of construction, the Storstrøm bridge has been opened by [DEN.GetLeader]. The bridge connects the island of Falster with the island of Masnedø, which itself had been connected to Sjælland in 1935 with the Masnedsund Bridge. Now the island of Falster can be reached by train from Copenhagen. Additionally, with the Guldborgsund Bridge, Lolland can be reached by train without the need for a ferry now as well."
 den.19.a: "Next station: Langeland... Though that might be a bit trickier."

 den.20.t: "Aarhus' New Coat of Arms"
 den.20.d: "The City of Aarhus has presented a standardised version of its coat of arms, describing it as 'a blue shield with a red portal, flanked by two red towers and a spire, with depiction of St. Clement and St. Paul, dressed in blue robes. Above the portal is a golden moon and a seven-spiked golden star and underneath it and above 4 silver wives a red painted wall', having been based on the original coat of arms as featured in 1250."
 den.20.a: "Congratulations Aarhus!"

 den.21.t: "Death of Louis Glass"
 den.21.d: "The famous composer Louis Glass has died today in Copenhagen. Glass studied at the famous Brussels Conservatory, after which he was one of Denmark's leading concert pianist until his paralysis in one arm. When his disability struck, he devoted himself to composing which resulted in several pieces of music in varying genres, including six symphonies that would later be recorded."
 den.21.a: "Requiescat in Pace."

 den.22.t: "Death of Thorvald Aargaard"
 den.22.d: "Composer and Organist Thorvald Aargaard has been reported to have died in the city of Ringe on Funen today. Aargaard is widely considered to be one of the innovators of Danish popular music, having written the music to several popular songs, like Aakjær's 'Spurven sidder stum bag kvist'."
 den.22.a: "Rest in peace."

 den.23.t: "Hans Niels Andersen died"
 den.23.d: "Entrepreneur and adventurer H.N. Andersen, reportedly died today. Andersen was the founder of the so-called 'East Asiatic Company', the largest company in Denmark today. In addition to his business ventures, he also served diplomatically, having unsuccessfully tried to initiate peace negotiations during the Weltkrieg and as Danish Consul General in Siam. As a Knight of the Elephant, a title awarded for his good work, he will surely be missed!"
 den.23.a: "Most definitely!"

 den.24.t: "Norwegian Documents transferred"
 den.24.d: "A large number of documents concerning Norway, mostly originating from the time of Denmark-Norway, are about to be shipped to Oslo from our national archives, the royal Danish library and the University Library. Norway will be sure to be pleased that their history will be brought to its proper location."
 den.24.a: "This is only natural."
 den.24.b: "Wait a sec, I see an error in the paperwork."

 den.25.t: "Norwegian Documents transferred"
 den.25.d: "A shipment from the Danish national archives, the Danish royal library and the Copenhagen University Library has just arrived. These are documents concerning Norway from the time Norway was part of Denmark. By moving these to our national archives, our history will be just a little bit more complete!"
 den.25.a: "Thank you, Denmark!"

 den.26.t: "Death of Karl Madsen"
 den.26.d: "The artist/art historian Carl J.W. Madsen, also known simply as Karl Madsen, has died the 16th of April. Madsen was part of the Skagen painters of the last century. In addition to his talent and splendid knowledge, he became one of Denmarks most influential art critics, frequently contributing to the Politiken newspaper. He worked as the director of the Skagens museum for the last 10 years."
 den.26.a: "Requiescat in Pace."

 den.27.t: "Death of Thomas Thrige"
 den.27.d: "Danish entrepreneur T.B. Thrige has reportedly left this world. Thrige was the founder of the company of the same name which produced electric motors for agricultural and other purposes. Thrige worked in the United States until he returned to Denmark after the war, on which many speculated that he foresaw the harsh years that America would come to face. In any case, Thrige's factories are one of Denmark's leading suppliers of jobs and for that in any case, we shall be thankful!"
 den.27.a: "Rest in Peace!"

 den.28.t: "Death of Harald Scavenius"
 den.28.d: "We have been notified that former foreign minister and first cousin of the current cabinet member Erik, Harald Scavenius, has died in The Hague where he was assigned for foreign service since 1928. Scavenius, who considered himself a conservative and has been known for his strongly antisyndicalist attitude, has died as he lived. A diplomat working abroad."
 den.28.a: "Indeed..."

 den.29.t: "Death of Peder Pedersen"
 den.29.d: "Engineer Peder Oluf Pedersen has died today in Copenhagen. Pedersen is known for his collaboration with Valdemar Poulsen, inventor of one of the first wireless telegraphy, which had been instrumental for the development of radio. Since 1922 Pedersen had been principal of the College of Advanced Technology (Den Polytekniske Lærenstalt)."
 den.29.a: "He will be missed."

 den.30.t: "Death of Thorvald Stauning"
 den.30.d: "Thorvald Stauning, one of the most influential statesmen of Denmark ever, has died today. Stauning, longtime chairman of the social democrats brought his party to power and then to a share of the popular vote that before him no one could've conceived before. Stauning is widely credited with containing Syndicalism as well as the DFP and the DS and some voices are calling for him to be given a state funeral, an honour normally not bestowed on Danish Prime Ministers, but considering the time he has held power, he isn't 'just a prime minister'."
 den.30.a: "Nothing less than a state funeral will do!"

 den.31.t: "Lockout"
 den.31.d: "Employers of several companies in one of Denmark's major cities have locked out their employees in order to force their demand of lower wages, which the employees were unwilling to accept. This will hurt our industrial output severely and some want the government to meddle in it to negotiate with the owners so production can resume as soon as possible and so the workers can make their bread again once more."
 den.31.a: "No place for the government to meddle."
 den.31.b: "Let's negotiate."

 den.32.t: "Trouble in the KF"
 den.32.d: "The Danish Conservative People's Party, formerly known simply as the Right, are the third party in the Folketing. Recently however, they have been the victim of in-fighting: witnessing our system of government, the party is hopelessly divided by its democratic wing, led by John Christmas Møller, who also leads the party's parliamentary faction at the moment, who stand for the healthy democracy we enjoy in Denmark today. As well as Victor Pürschel, who, aided by Jack Westergaard and his Conservative Youth, desires a return to the more traditional Høyre stance with a lot of power to the king, aiming for a system that expands upon the king's already overreaching reserve powers. It seems that the two branches will continue their bickering for a while, allowing their social democratic competition as well as their natural allies in conservatism, Venstre, to pick off support."
 den.32.a: "A divided opposition is good for the government."

 den.33.t: "The Second Weltkrieg"
 den.33.d: "The first skirmishes have been reported and it seems Europe will be on fire once more. Meanwhile, in Denmark a rift has formed between the social democrats, hoping to preserve Danish neutrality like in the first war, and the liberals and conservatives, who worry that the syndicalists can not be trusted to leave Denmark alone if they win the war. As such, they call upon the government to join the Reichspakt while we can still fight for our independence, instead of leaving our fate hanging to the German military alone."
 den.33.a: "We have no choice but to join!"
 den.33.b: "We should remain neutral, like last time."

 den.34.t: "Denmark petitions to join the Reichspakt"
 den.34.d: "Wisely seeking to fight along our forces, the Danish government has petitioned us to join us in our struggle against our enemies. There is seemingly little reason to not have them join, especially since their ascension in the pact would lock down the Baltic sea in our favour, safeguarding our flank there."
 den.34.a: "Willkommen!"
 den.34.b: "No, thanks!"

 den.35.t: "Germany agrees"
 den.35.d: "Germany has agreed to let us into their faction. Together we shall crush our enemies and scare away our foes!"
 den.35.a: "Når tysken kommer her."

 den.36.t: "Germany rejects us"
 den.36.d: "Germany has rejected our appliance to join the Reichspakt, referencing to their need to protect us and that they can't spare the troops to do that."
 den.36.a: "The implication is what hurts the most."

 den.37.t: "The King fires [getDanishPrimeMinister]"
 den.37.d: "Unexpected news arrived from the palace: king Christian X has dismissed [getDanishPrimeMinister] and his ministers and replaced him with Victor Pürschel, the leader of the authoritarian (royalist) wing of the KF, citing concerns over the cabinets unwillingness to join the Weltkrieg and the risk this brings to the continued prosperity of Denmark, calling it gambling that the Hær will not be necessary for the German Heer to fend off the syndicalist menace. It is highly questionable however if the king's resolve will stay this strong if significant resistance grows to these actions."
 den.37.a: "Should we have allowed these reserve powers to persist?"

 den.38.t: "Outrage over the king's actions"
 den.38.d: "Unsurprisingly, the king's borderline authoritarian actions have cause massive resistance, with newspapers calling him out to dismiss this 'cabinet without a mandate' and to then abdicate from his throne. Public Opinion on the monarchy plummeted overnight to a razorthin republican majority and people start going to the streets against this undemocratic action."
 den.38.a: "You'll understand soon, children!"

 den.39.t: "Folketing starts vote of no confidence"
 den.39.d: "As the dust clears a bit on the sudden removal of the previous government, the former coalition swiftly started a vote of no confidence, that's backed by all parties in the Folketing except the Dansk Samling and the more radically conservative representatives of the KF who are on Pürschel's side. The leader of the conservative youth movement, Jack Westergaard has proposed to the new cabinet that they block the opposition representatives from entering folketing tomorrow to establish constitutionally dubious emergency laws to strengthen our control, but at the same time former prime minister Thorvald Stauning tries to convince the king to back down while the monarchy or even he himself have not yet completely fallen from grace."
 den.39.a: "Stauning convinces the king to back down."
 den.39.b: "The king doesn't back down and Westergaard's plan takes place."

 den.40.t: "Protests in front of Amalienborg"
 den.40.d: "The actions of the king and this new government have provoked large scale demonstrations in front of the Amalienborg palace, where the king resides. Føderationen seems to be highly represented in these so called 'peaceful protests.' After a few hours though, Totalist elements start to provoke violent incidents and slowly the situation is degrading in outright rioting. The commissioner of the Copenhagen police advises using the riot police to contain the protests, while prime minister Pürschel wants to quell this dissent once and for all by deploying the army."
 den.40.a: "Deploy the riot police."
 den.40.b: "Deploy the army."

 den.41.t: "Protests in Front of Amalienborg Contained"
 den.41.d: "After the peaceful protest spiralled into a full-on riot, the riot police was dispatched by the government to contain the rioters. The Riot police assembled on both sides of Amaliegade street and the Amalie garden, slowly dislodging the rioters of the Palace's courtyard and pushing the crowd towards the Marmorkirken, where the protestors began to scatter. There have been no reported deaths amongst the rioters, although plenty of arrests have been made by the police during the cleanup.\n\nHowever, with many windows of the palace shattered and some damage to the Rytterstatuen, it is clear that the King must not remain in the premises for the near future, as his life might be endangered if the rioters return in strength another time."
 den.41.a: "Send in the riot police to secure the surrounding area and evacuate His Majesty."

 den.42.t: "Føderationen Calls for a General Strike"
 den.42.d: "Just when the situation seemed to be improving, the 'Kommunistisk Føderation' has called for a General Strike in order to accomplish the demands that the protests at Amalienborg could not. However, only syndicalist elements of our nation have adhered to the strike so far, which makes of this strike only a minor hindrance for now."
 den.42.a: "Only syndicalists would support that..."

 den.43.t: "General Strike Extends Beyond Syndicalist Spheres"
 den.43.d: "In the recent days, the General Strike has been gaining strength, managing to slowly attract support from the non-syndicalist parts of our populace that see our actions as undemocratic. Now the strike has become more than a hindrance, and is starting to become a strain on our economy, grinding the country almost to a halt. The strikers demands are clear, and they don't seem to wish to return to their workplaces anytime soon..."
 den.43.a: "They'll return to the workplaces with time."
 den.43.b: "Give in..."

 den.44.t: "General Strike Continues"
 den.44.d: "Several days have passed by, and the Strike is still in full strength and with an ever more growing influence amongst our populace. Our government is starting to run out of options, as the economy has ground to a halt. The King is growing impatient, as We have little choice but to keep waiting for the strike to wither out or to give in to their demands, and the strikers do not seem to be willing to give up anytime soon."
 den.44.a: "They'll return to the workplaces with time."
 den.44.b: "Give in..."

 den.45.t: "General Strike Withers Out."
 den.45.d: "Finally, after weeks full of protests, the most moderate populace has started to cave in, returning to their work and leaving the syndicalist without any tangible support to continue the strike. In this struggle of attrition, it seems that the government has prevailed over the people..."
 den.45.a: "Hah..."

 den.46.t: "Military Intervention in Protest Turns Sour"
 den.46.d: "With the life of the king apparently endangered by the rioters, the government has chosen to follow Pürschel's advice. However, as the army closed in and began evacuating the King, one of the soldiers trying to control the protestors lost his nerve and shot one of the protestors. The riot quickly devolved into a firefight, as the people proceeded to throw rocks at the soldiers, with some protestors even pulling out their own weapons to fire at the attackers, which were answered by more gunshots from the army until many soldiers decided to switch sides and joined the crowd. The populace finally overwhelmed the loyalist armed forces and retook the palace and its surrounding area. The army has been forced to pull back from the area until reinforcements arrive, as they don't possess the strength to suppress the revolt at the moment."
 den.46.a: "Uh-oh..."

 den.47.t: "Formation of the Copenhagen Commune"
 den.47.d: "With the takeover of the Palace, Christian Christensen, with the backup of his Enhedspartiet, has proclaimed the Copenhagen Commune at the courtyard, with the crowd cheering at their victory. However, success of the commune is still far from certain, as the King has managed to escape and the army is still loyal to the old government. However, the people is rallying to the new government's call, and with their improvised forces the commune has managed to capture the Rosenberg Barracks after facing some loyalist resistance, seizing the armoury and using its weaponry to prepare the once peaceful protestors for an armed resistance..."
 den.47.a: "Uh-oh..."

 den.48.t: "Communal government Convenes on the Next Step"
 den.48.d: "The Communal government has convened at the Amalienborg Palace to decide on its next move. Former prime minister Stauning has held a speech at the assembly, calling for the commune to negotiate with the army rather than to face them in battle. While Stauning is a well respected political figure amongst the protestors, many within Føderationen have denounced him as a counter-revolutionary and as a class traitor, asking for him to be imprisoned..."
 den.48.a: "Stauning convinces the majority."
 den.48.b: "Stauning does not Convince the Majority and is Imprisoned."

 den.49.t: "Civilian planes dump leaflets over military bases across the country"
 den.49.d: "Under Stauning's orders, a couple of citizens have seized the Berlingske tidende printing press, and have began printing leaflets denouncing the loyalist forces and their crimes at the Palace and stating the demands of the protestors, which are the removal of the Authoritarian cabinet and the abdication of the king. Then a group of enthusiast civilian pilots has volunteered to drop these leafleats all over the country's military bases. The result is almost immediate, soldiers willingly dropping their posts and joining the commune's forces and others threatening to mutiny if the army doesn't negotiate with the commune..."
 den.49.a: "The generals have no choice but to accept."

 den.50.t: "The Army Crushes the Commune"
 den.50.d: "With the imprisonment of Stauning, many of the protestors with democratic leanings have denounced the Commune, accusing it of acting exactly the same as the authoritarian cabinet. This caused a power struggle, and as both factions battled out for the control of Copenhagen, the Danish army regrouped at the gates of the city. With one swift strike, the city was retaken and both factions were put down in a matter of hours. Now, with the commune being put down, the authoritarian cabinet has finally consolidated their position."
 den.50.a: "Good riddance."

 den.51.t: "The Arrival of king Christian"
 den.51.d: "Christian von Glücksburg, former king of Denmark, has arrived in Berlin following a worrying development in his home country: in his attempt to bring the country in line with Germany, seeking to influence it into joining the Weltkrieg, he caused a scandal that ended in him losing the Danish throne, putting Denmark solidly at the path of neutrality.\n\nSome in our government consider it not helpful to push Denmark towards the internationale, but on the other hand: Christian is the brother in law of the duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin and kronprinz Wilhelm's wife. Denmark should be easy to pacify, perhaps even before they have the chance to contact the internationale."
 den.51.a: "An intervention is non-negotiable."
 den.51.b: "We won't die for Denmark!"

 den.52.t: "The enemy of my enemy..."
 den.52.d: "The Germans have decided to show their grudge towards us once more: we are at war with them, and so are the commune. Their syndicalist ideals may seem quite far away from our own, but shouldn't one be pragmatic in war?"
 den.52.a: "Attempt to join the Internationale!"
 den.52.b: "We won't fit in one boat with the syndicalists!"

 den.53.t: "Denmark wants our help!"
 den.53.d: "The Danish class snobs have put themselves in a delicate position: they got themselves stuck in conflict with our imperial enemy. While the idea of letting bourgeois socialists into our internationale might be appalling, they do open a solid northern front if they can hold out long enough and we could leverage the situation into them reforming into a proper syndicalist system."
 den.53.a: "Only if you reform!"
 den.53.b: "We will not ally ourselves with class traitors!"

 den.54.t: "The French demand reforms"
 den.54.d: "The French have come back to our request, requiring significant reforms moving Denmark to a syndicalist system. It may not be the most appealing option, but the reality is probably that the alternative is either German or French dominion after the war otherwise."
 den.54.a: "We have no choice..."
 den.54.b: "We will not stain democracy like this!"

 den.55.t: "Denmark accepts"
 den.55.d: "The Danish have reluctantly accepted our demands. With the political issues out of the way, the way is open for them to join the Internationale."
 den.55.a: "Welcome, brothers!"

 den.56.t: "Denmark rejects our suggestion"
 den.56.d: "The Danish are unwilling to make the reforms we suggested to them, declaring they would go against Danish democracy. This is fine too: after we defeat the Kaiserreich Denmark will be liberated and a full and true syndicalist system will be properly installed."
 den.56.a: "This works for us too..."

 den.57.t: "France rejects us!"
 den.57.d: "Claiming letting 'bourgeois socialists' (us, apparently) in would subvert the revolution, the French have dismissed our suggestion to join the Internationale."
 den.57.a: "We'll do just fine without them!"

 den.58.t: "The question of the monarchy"
 den.58.d: "King Christian's staunch support for Pürschel's illegitimate government has done the monarchy much harm, with the support for it laying, according to most polls, far beneath the 50% mark. Many however note that this is mainly Christian's personal unpopularity rather than an outright desire to be republic. The king's position clearly can't be maintained and his abdication is inevitable, but should he simply abdicate according to the normal proceedings, letting his son prince Frederick inherit, or should we take some less orthodox measures to make sure this never happens again? Many support the establishment of a republic."
 den.58.a: "Frederick should inherit!"
 den.58.b: "Abolish the monarchy and establish a republic!"

 den.60.t: "[GetYear] Folketing Elections"
 den.60.d: "Election time has come again: after several months of intensive campaigning the Danish people will cast their ballot for their preferred party, with the battlelines drawn between the Social Democrats and Radical Left party on the one side and the Left party with the Conservative People's Party on the other side."
 den.60.a: "The Socialdemokraterne and Radikale Venstre secure the Folketing!"
 den.60.b: "Venstre and the KF secure the Folketing!"

 den.61.t: "[GetYear] Folketing Elections"
 den.61.d: "Election time has come again: after several months of intensive campaigning the Danish people will cast their ballot for their preferred party, with the battlelines drawn between the Social Democrats and Radical Left party on the one side and the Left party with the Conservative People's Party on the other side."
 den.61.a: "The Socialdemokraterne and Radikale Venstre secure the Folketing!"
 den.61.b: "Venstre and the KF secure the Folketing!"

 den.62.t: "The King picks a Chancellor"
 den.62.d: "Stauning's socialists and Det Radikale Venstre have secured themselves a majority in the Folketing. Unlike earlier times though, the king is now willing to use his constitutional rights to prevent disaster from occurring due to an incompetent government. Many are imploring the king to ignore the stand of the Folketing and to put the KF in power regardless."
 den.62.a: "Let the social democrats form the government."
 den.62.b: "Appoint Pürschel but include some ministers as a compromise."
 den.62.c: "Appoint Pürschel and the KF instead."

 den.63.t: "The King picks a Chancellor"
 den.63.d: "The Danish right secured themselves a majority in the Folketing. Many agree that this government should be allowed to run its course: after all they don't pose a serious upset to Danish politics, but the KF would like the king to ensure that they will hold the prime ministry and thus fulfil the primary role in the government."
 den.63.a: "Let it all proceed as usual!"
 den.63.b: "Enforce the KF as the senior coalition partner."

 den.64.t: "75 years since the loss of Slesvig-Holsten"
 den.64.d: "Three quarters of a century ago, the wretched Germans took the Duchy of Schleswig-Holstein and claimed it for their own, leaving many Danes under German rule. Unsurprisingly, Danish radicals, primarily the Danmarks Folkerepublikanske Parti, but to an extent also the Dansk Samling and the Kommunarder clique of the Kommunistisk Føderation have ratcheted up their rhetoric on this day.\n\nThe DFP has even organised a large feast 'to celebrate the impending liberation of Slesvig'. This growth of revanchism is most worrisome."
 den.64.a: "Indeed..."

 den.65.t: "The Liberation of Christiansfeld"
 den.65.d: "Perhaps under the influence of a few drinks too many at the DFP feast, a gathering of Frikorps members decided that the liberation could no longer be delayed: they took up their guns, put their Frikorps uniforms on and moved for the bordervillage of Christiansfeld. They encountered resistance from one soldier on leave and two customs official, all three of whom were killed by this angry mob. Upon their 'conquest', they declared Christiansfeld to be 'the first of many Slesvig towns to be liberated' and some villagers even cheered to this sentiment. Unsurprisingly however, the nearby German garrison soon after intervened, resulting the Frikorps fleeing back to Denmark, although not before having taken the freedom to beat up a few German-speaking villagers for ratting them out."
 den.65.a: "The Germans will not like this..."

 den.66.t: "The Raid on Christiansfeld"
 den.66.d: "Danish thugs have brutally attacked the village of Christiansfeld, killing a soldier on leave and two customs officials in the process and hurting German-speakers in the village. Unsurprisingly, when the local garrison intervened the cowards quickly fled back to Denmark, leaving us without the perpetrators."
 den.66.a: "Denmark should extradite those thugs right now!"
 den.66.b: "Let's not make a big deal out of this..."

 den.67.t: "The Germans demand Extradition"
 den.67.d: "The Germans demand that we extradite the Frikorps members who mounted the attack on the village of Christiansfeld. We know who they are, but are we really prepared to give Danish citizens to the Germans?!"
 den.67.a: "Of course, they broke the law in Germany!"
 den.67.b: "No, I like their sentiment!"

 den.68.t: "Denmark concedes!"
 den.68.d: "The Danish have conceded: they arrested those responsible behind the raid and properly delivered them to us. The German court of law will decide the fate of these barbarous murderers as it should be."
 den.68.a: "Good!"

 den.69.t: "Denmark is Resistant!"
 den.69.d: "The Danish are unwilling to extradite their countrymen to us: they are apparently worried that we will not treat them fairly. The implications of these Danes are disgusting; these are murderers they're talking about!"
 den.69.a: "We won't forget this!"

 den.70.t: "20 Years Storm at Børsen"
 den.70.d: "Exactly 20 years ago, disgruntled anarchists and syndicalists raided the Copenhagen Stock Exchange, also known as 'Børsen'. Among syndicalist circles, it is fondly remembered as the day Denmark came closest to the revolution and unsurprisingly, with this questionable anniversary, they are organising several activities in remembrance of those who were arrested there."
 den.70.a: "Worrisome!"

 den.71.t: "Grundlovsdag"
 den.71.d: "It is Grundlovsdag, or Constitution Day today: on this day the Danish people celebrate their democracy; many politicians hold a speech today and most people have half the day off."
 den.71.a: "Hurra!"

 den.72.t: "Election of the Secretary of External Affairs"
 den.72.d: "As per the French demands, the government is being radically overhauled. Henceforth the Rigsdag's functions will be taken over by the Kommunistisk Føderation, of which all Danish workers are obligatory members. Contrary to many Orthodox Syndicalist systems, these are much more open, also to more 'radical voices' like many of the former Radikale Venstre party members. Today the vote will be held on who will become secretary of External Affairs: Ib Nørlund, of the Enhedspartiet, who stands for strong relations with the Third Internationale, Hans Hedtoft of Stauning's faction, who is taking a pragmatic approach with full support here and now and review after the war is won, and Otto Mohr, who stands for a distancing of relations after the war is over. There are also Kommunarder and DVSP delegates but their factions are too small to have a legitimate chance."
 den.72.a: "Enheds Nørlund"
 den.72.b: "Stauninger Hedtoft"
 den.72.c: "Liberal Mohr"

 den.73.t: "Election of the Secretary of Economic Affairs"
 den.73.d: "Today the Kommunistisk Føderation elects their secretary of economic affairs. The three most prevalent factions once more deliver the candidates who stand a chance: old-time syndicalist Poul Gissemann stands for the Enhedspartiet, supporting complete unionisation of the Danish economy; he is opposed by Stauninger Viggo Kampmann, who wants to strictly adhere to the minimum of the French demands while letting the free market take care of the rest, and Bertel Dahlgaard, who clearly seeks to mostly preserve the Danish free market, insofar as that's possible without provoking the French."
 den.73.a: "Orthodox Gissemann"
 den.73.b: "Stauninger Kampmann"
 den.73.c: "Liberal Dahlgaard"

 den.74.t: "Election of the Secretary of Internal Affairs"
 den.74.d: "Next the Kommunistisk Føderation elects their secretary of internal affairs. Once again, the three most prevalent factions deliver the candidates who stand a chance: for the Enhedspartiet, Poul Gissemann once again, on the platform of safeguarding the Danish revolution by cracking down on the still wide antisyndicalist dissent; his opponents Alsing Andersen and Jørgen Jørgensen of the Stauninger and the liberals respectively, are against these tactics, arguing that it will only deepen the distrust of the Danes to the new system, which many view as imposed on Denmark."
 den.74.a: "Orthodox Gissemann"
 den.74.b: "Stauninger Andersen"
 den.74.c: "Liberal Jørgensen"

 den.75.t: "Election of the Chairman"
 den.75.d: "At last, the Kommunistisk Føderation arrived at the office of Prime Minister-President. For the longest of times, Christian Christensen has garnered total domination over Føderationen, but with the large influx of new members due to the popularity of Socialdemokraterne, his office is now threatened by Thorvald Stauning, who by his social democrats is seen as the saviour of Denmark by bringing it French protection. Peter Munch, who is supported by many reactionaries also attracts a lot of attention, considering his victory would leave a sour taste in the mouths of our new allies."
 den.75.a: "Christensen is reelected."
 den.75.b: "Stauning takes the chairmanship."
 den.75.c: "Cryptoreactionaries carry Munch to the chairmanship."

 den.76.t: "Enhedspartiet Victory"
 den.76.d: "In an upset, the Enhedspartiet has managed to remain in control of its own organisation despite the influx of new members. Richard Jensen, who leads the 'young guard' of the Solidarity Party has congratulated Christensen, who leads the 'old guard,' in his victory. This victory marks the establishment of the first ever Syndicalist government in Denmark's history, many in the Socialdemokraterne remains dissatisfied at the electoral results, but in exchange for French protection, it is a necessary evil. "
 den.76.a: "I guess the French will be happy..."

 den.77.t: "Stauninger Victory"
 den.77.d: "Unsurprisingly, former prime minister Stauning has taken over Føderationen using his personal popularity and taking credit for saving Denmark by getting it allies. This secures the prevailing view that no matter what happens, the social democrats will always remain a significant force in Danish politics."
 den.77.a: "No surprises there."

 den.78.t: "Liberal Victory"
 den.78.d: "The syndicalists have been beaten at their own game; the French allowed a more open system in Denmark because they believed that the small Radikale Venstre party would never become influential, but the exclusion of the conservatives and other liberals has obviously resulted in great gains for this previously small group. Some wonder whether the liberals will remain in power once the dust settles, as France and the other members look down on Radikale Venstre's victory as entirely illegitimate."
 den.78.a: "Very moderate, this revolution."

 den.79.t: "No majority"
 den.79.d: "The new influx of members has left the Kommunistisk Føderation hopelessly divided. No majority could be reached and a compromise will have to do to make sure Denmark will have a government."
 den.79.a: "The Stauningerne ally with the Enhedspartiet."
 den.79.b: "The Stauningerne ally with the Liberals."

 den.80.t: "King Christian passes away..."
 den.80.d: "His Royal Majesty, King Christian, has passed away in his home, Amalienborg Palace. He will be buried among his kin - other members of the Danish royal family - in the Roskilde cathedral some thirty kilometres outside Copenhagen. In the meantime, the prime minister has announced his son, crown prince Frederick, is the new king of Denmark!"
 den.80.a: "The King is dead, long live the King!"

 den.81.t: "The Constitutional Referendum"
 den.81.d: "The government has proposed an amendment on the Danish constitution: they seek to lower the electoral age from 25 to 23 years and to replace the Landsting, Denmark's senate, with a new body called the Rigsting while the 'united Rigsdag' consisting of the Rigsting and the Folketing that will form a third chamber that will handle important bills like the budget and future changes to the constitution.\n\nThere is relatively little opposition against this change - not in the last place because the opposition parties support it - but according to the Danish constitution it needs to be approved by 45% of the electorate (including blank votes and those not showing up to vote), an amount of voters that might be hard to reach. Failing to pass the amendment could be a massive blow to our government."
 den.81.a: "We'll need to raise awareness!"

 den.82.t: "The Constitutional Amendment fails!"
 den.82.d: "Disaster! Despite our best efforts, the amount of people who came out to vote remained stuck at 1,063,764. This amounts to 48.9% of the electorate and with a ratio in favour of 91.9%, it means the percentage of the electorate supporting the amendment remained at 44.46%; just below the threshold of 45% needed to pass. Not only does it seem we'll have to do with the old constitution from 1916. Both Thorvald Stauning from the Socialdemokraterne and John Christmas Møller of the DKF have spoken out conceding their defeat and neither seems to be very happy with this outcome."
 den.82.a: "This won't be good for our government's image!"

 den.83.t: "The Constitutional Amendment is approved!"
 den.83.d: "Good news! Our extensive campaign of awareness has brought fruit, and the referendum passed easily: not only did over 90% of the electorate vote in favour of the proposed amendment, the turnout was over 55%, clearly securing 45% of the electorate behind the change and allowing the constitutional amendment to move on in full force. Both Thorvald Stauning and John Christmas Møller have expressed their approval with this outcome and it seems all but assured that the 1916 referendum will be replaced now!"
 den.83.a: "Hurrah!"

 den.85.t: "Thomas Madsen-Mygdal passes away"
 den.85.d: "Thomas Madsen-Mygdal, the active leader of the Venstre party, has passed away today in his home among his family. Having been switching between member of the government, primary leader of the opposition and even prime minister, he has surely pressed his mark onto Danish politics. Venstre has been swift to announce Knud Kristensen as the new leader of the party; it will surely be a challenging for him to match this illustrious leader of the Danish right."
 den.85.a: "His funeral will likely be busy with liberals..."

 den.86.t: "Denmark offers an economic deal"
 den.86.d: "Our small neighbour Denmark has been hit hard by the very Black Monday plague that sweeps our nation as well. In an attempt to soften the blows, the Danish government seeks to make the import of Danish goods more attractive. To that end, they want to lower the exchange rate of the Danish Krone to our Mark, two currencies that are pegged to each other within the Mitteleuropa system. In return for our cooperation the Danish state offers to buy additional German goods as compensation."
 den.86.a: "A sensible deal, go ahead!"
 den.86.b: "We will not betray the German common man like that!"

 den.87.t: "Germany accepts our deal"
 den.87.d: "The German government has accepted our offer to buy additional German goods from the market if they'll cooperate in our endeavour to lower the Krone in value compared to the Mark, which has been pegged to the Krone since the Weltkrieg."
 den.87.a: "Good, this will aid the recovery!"

 den.88.t: "Germany rejects our deal"
 den.88.d: "The German government has rejected our offer to buy additional German goods from the market in return for their acceptance of us lowering the Krone cin value compared to the Mark. This is a setback as any attempt to do so anyways is bound to provoke German countermeasures. We'll have to recover through other means."
 den.88.a: "Unfortunate!"

 den.89.t: "The Founding of 'Lego'"
 den.89.d: "The woodworking shop of Billund carpenter Ole Kirk Christiansen had been going through a rough time during the last year: due to the Black Monday crisis that hit Denmark, fewer customers order furniture in the once-prospering carpentry workshop. Christiansen therefore decided to focus on smaller projects and started to produce toys for kids. While the process has not been extremely profitable, with most customers paying in kind, it has allowed the workshop to stay afloat and the toys - now being shipped under the brand 'Lego', a contraction of 'Leg godt', 'play well' - are growing in popularity throughout Denmark as well as in Schleswig-Holstein and profits are rising."
 den.89.a: "A splendid display of Danish ingenuity!"

 den.91.t: "Seeking German protection?"
 den.91.d: "Disturbingly, both Norway and Sweden have shortly after each other fallen to Syndicalism, and undoubtedly they are now looking at destroying our status-quo as well together with those in Denmark sympathising with their cause. Voices are rising day after day that we should seek to enter into an alliance with Germany, purely for our own safety. A war with Sweden and Norway is unlikely to end well..."
 den.91.a: "Contact Berlin as soon as possible!"
 den.91.b: "We will survive on our own!"

 den.92.t: "August Uproar"
 den.92.d: "Riots have started to take place as exhaustion about the prolonged state of war Denmark has found itself in keeps dragging on. This month especially the unrest has been growing: starting in Odense, the demonstrations have spilled over to other cities in Denmark, including Funen, Esbjerg, Aalborg en Aarhus. Fortunately, Copenhagen seems to be calm, but it is clear that the appetite for war is running out."
 den.92.a: "We have almost won, I assure you!"

 den.93.t: "Syndikalistloven"
 den.93.d: "The 'Law no. 349 on Prohibition of Syndicalist Associations and against Syndicalist Trade Unions' will be voted on in the Folketing, calling for the complete prohibition of syndicalist activities, specifically those of the 'Kommunistisk Føderation' on the grounds that this hurts state security and that these trade unions support our enemy.\n\nDespite the circumstances at hand, the law is controversial, as some jurists have called out the law as a violation of the freedom of association as enshrined in our constitution."
 den.93.a: "The law passes despite the controversy."
 den.93.b: "The law fails, letting syndicalists still operate."

 den.94.t: "The Danish Statsraad System"
 den.94.d: "With the state of the Weltkrieg not quite leaning in the German Empire's favour, Denmark, a nation generally considered deep within Germany's sphere, has moved to join the Third Internationale in a bid for self-preservation.\nAfter the attempted coup by the king of Denmark to install an authoritarian hegemony over the nation, Denmark dissolved the monarchy of their nation to secure their democracy. However, under threat of German invasion due to the ousting of King Christian, the new Danish Republic has agreed to join the Third Internationale for protection, under the conditions that their government become socialist.\nWhile there has been opposition, the government has agreed so long as their democratic institutions are still protected."
 den.94.a: "A stab in the back like no other."

 den.95.t: "Denmark turns to Autocracy"
 den.95.d: "As the Second Weltkrieg wages on in the European theatre, the small Reichspakt aligned nation of Denmark has been in a crisis of its own. The Danish parliament has been gridlocked for weeks on the future of their nation in this new landscape. Fed up with the inability of his government to reach a satisfactory conclusion, King Christian X has, using his leadership of the Danish Army, dissolved the democratic institutions of Denmark, and has thrown the full weight of Danish society behind the Reichspakt's interests.\nWidespread protests have taken place all across the nation as German garrisons send troops to assist local police and militia in quelling the masses. While this decision comes as a shock to almost all who have been watching the Danish situation, there is no question now where the loyalties of the Jutland peninsula lie."
 den.95.a: "Long Live the King!"

### Characters ###
 DEN_martin_andersen_nexo: "Martin Andersen Nexø"
 DEN_martin_andersen_nexo_leader_desc: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! June 26th, 1869, in Copenhagen, Kingdom of Denmark\n§YPolitical Career:§! Born to an impoverished and dysfunctional family in the slums of his nation's capital, most of Martin's early life was spent in Nexø, on the island of Bornholm, which the family had moved to when he was eight years old. He was expected to find work and leave home early, toiling as a janitor, cobbler and mason, until he was able to afford to attend high-school in his early 20s. Though drawn to Christian Humanism, Martin also showed sympathies for Socialism and became committed to elevating the voice of the working class as an author. He appended "Nexø" to the end of his surname, both due to the love of his hometown but also to stand out. During the 1800s his works saw little purchase outside of the island, and to make things worse he began to show signs of tuberculosis, which forced him to travel to the Mediterranean to convalesce. There he saw that the working classes of Italy, Spain and North Africa were not any different than those of Denmark. Inspired by this commonality as well as by tales of daring Iberian and Italian revolutionaries, Martin returned to Denmark a committed internationalist and a true socialist. By the turn of the century he had begun writing his seminal work, "Pelle the Conqueror" about a young Danish boy who rises to become a labour organiser, while also starting to attend meetings of the Social Democratic Party.\n\nHe wrote often of pessimism and hopelessness as a "bourgeoise disease", but began to personally show doubts over time whether Social Democracy and Reformism was sufficient to elevate the working class. By the late 1910s, the revolutions in Russia and France made him a full blown Communist. He would later emerge as a Danish delegate to the first meeting of the Third International and for many years a resident of the French countryside. Even so he was not a professional politician nor a professional revolutionary, as old age and infirmity wrapped him in their embrace, Martin returned to writing as his principal method for changing the world around him. Though a literary force of nature, the proletarian from Nexø is more renowned as a figurehead due to his connections to Paris and for the political patronage he has offered younger Danish communists, particularly of the radical "Kommunard" clique."

Christian von Glücksburg rose to the Danish throne in 1912 after his father, king Frederick VIII, passed away in Hamburg. The king has thus far guided Denmark through the Weltkrieg, in which the nation remained neutral, and into the interwar, presiding over the political shift that was the rise of the social democrats of Thorvald Stauning in 1924. It is said that the king is sceptical about the prime minister and his party, but that he accepts their position in government in the knowledge that he can use his reserve power should excesses occur.\n\nMany have considered that the fact that this has still not happened after 12 years means that the king has eventually accepted the democratic parliamentarism that has been in place since the ascension of the Deuntzer cabinet in 1901."
