### Ideas ###
 ETH_Debt_idea_1: "Crippling Debt"

 ETH_Slavery_idea: "Slavery"
 ETH_Slavery_idea_desc: "Slavery is an extremely widespread practice within Ethiopia. Despite efforts, which were mostly symbolic in nature, undertaken by former emperors following Menelik II, slavery and descendants of slaves continue to exist and, despite working hard, receive no pay for their efforts. This institution is both inefficient and a great source of shame for Ethiopia as the practice of slavery is seen as improper for any civilised nation."

 ETH_Land_Reform_idea: "Land Income"
 ETH_Land_Reform_idea_desc: "We're now utilising our lands much more efficiently and managing them with modern methods. This has greatly impacted our agricultural output."

 ETH_Aristocratic_Army: "Aristocratic Military"
 ETH_Aristocratic_Army_desc: "Positions held within our armed forces are determined by birth and all of the top positions are held by men who are of noble blood and, yet, as seen in the Weltkrieg, of questionable competence."

 ETH_Speech_Freedom: "Freedom of Speech"
 ETH_Speech_Freedom_desc: "We now possess laws to protect the people's right to and freedom of speech. Furthermore, we also possess the political will to enforce these new laws."

 ETH_Ethiopian_Prosperity: "Ethiopian Prosperity"

 ETH_Lion_of_Judah_idea: "Empire of the Lion"
 ETH_Lion_of_Judah_idea_desc: "The Lion of Judah is more than just a mere dynastic symbol. It stands for all the hardships and challenges that Ethiopia, the one nation to survive colonialism and even triumph against the colonisers, has overcome. Time and time again, in our thousand-year history, the empire has stood tall since the Heirs of Solomon had first set foot here."

 ETH_Imperial_Inspiration: "Imperial Inspiration"
 ETH_Imperial_Inspiration_desc: "Our Emperor is a man who, himself, is larger than life. To any foreigner, he may seem meek in personality and small in stature. However, when he speaks, all listen. He inherited a broken and bankrupt empire from Zewditu, and everyone can see, yet only few understand, the greatness he truly stands for."

 ETH_Fringe_Integration: "Fringe Integration"
 ETH_Fringe_Integration_desc: "Since our proclamation of equality before the law our relationship with those outside of Amhara society and culture has substantially improved. Although they may still resent the dominance of northern officials and culture they are more willing to accept at least the nominal authority of Imperial officials and government."

 ETH_Trained_Pilots: "Trained Pilots"
 ETH_Trained_Pilots_desc: "A piloting school, headed by foreign advisors, has been opened in Addis Ababa."

 ETH_Ethiopian_Guns_idea: "Ethiopian Guns"
 ETH_Ethiopian_Guns_idea_desc: "By utilising foreign expertise and basing our designs off external blueprints, we can ensure Ethiopian-made guns, made by Ethiopians for Ethiopians, are of the highest calibre whilst remaining inexpensive."

 ETH_Levy_Army: "Army of Levies"
 ETH_Levy_Army_desc: "Ethiopia, unlike the powers of the modern era, does not possess a united and organised army. The 'army' of Ethiopia, in fact, belongs to individual lords, whose men are loyal to them and only them."

### Focuses ###
 ETH_Nationalised_Railroad: "Nationalised Railway"
 ETH_Nationalised_Railroad_desc: "We've now nationalised our railways, ensuring that they are Imperial property. We will take good care of them, ensuring that the transportation of goods and troops flows swiftly and efficiently."

 ETH_Privatised_Railroad: "Privatised Railway"
 ETH_Privatised_Railroad_desc: "We will allow the German-owned railways to continue operation under German personnel, however we will continually monitor them, ensuring that their quality remains of the highest calibre."

 ETH_Expand_Railroad: "Expand the Railway"
 ETH_Expand_Railroad_desc: "Expanding the current railway system is crucial to the long-term benefit of our nation. Lines of communication, the distribution of goods, and the movement of troops are all equally important and will help our nation prosper. Thankfully, the Emperor understands the importance of transportation."

 ETH_Southern_Expansion: "Southern Railway Expansion"
 ETH_Southern_Expansion_desc: "The next step of our railway expansion plan is to connect the southernmost regions of the empire to the rest of our infrastructure and, hopefully, the rest of the nation."

 ETH_Expand_Into_Eritrea: "Expand the Railway into Eritrea"
 ETH_Expand_Into_Eritrea_desc: "The next step of our railway expansion plan is to connect the empire's only coastal region, Eritrea, to the rest of the nation, improve the prosperity of people living there, and better manage the flow of goods in the region."

 ETH_Speak_Amharic: "Make Them Speak Amharic"
 ETH_Speak_Amharic_desc: "While in the past every province and region could operate as an entity unto itself that time has long since passed and today allowing distant regions to operate by their own rules only furthers the danger of detachment and ultimately the disintegration of the whole realm. With Eritrea firmly under the control of the Emperor we will enforce the use of Amharic in official matters and encourage its use in commerce and public life."

 ETH_Tribe_Integration: "Tribal Integration"
 ETH_Tribe_Integration_desc: "We can sway the Eritrean leadership to our side... if we offer them substantial incentives."

 ETH_Officer_Integration: "Officer Integration"
 ETH_Officer_Integration_desc: "Many of our veteran fighters had served under the Italians and others under private militias after the Liberation. We should apply the same principles we'd applied then and take steps to seamlessly integrate the Eritrean forces into the Ethiopian military."

 ETH_Construct_Naval_Base: "Massawa Naval Base"
 ETH_Construct_Naval_Base_desc: "We will spare no expense in the creation of a port in Massawa, which will be so grand, that it will blow away the naval empires of today as it will showcase the true naval strength of the empire!"

 ETH_Integration_Of_Eritrea: "Integration of Eritrea"
 ETH_Integration_Of_Eritrea_desc: "Twenty years later, unrest within Eritrea has almost subsided and the people living within the region are beginning to form an optimistic view of the empire. It seems that, in the near future, potential unrest will begin to decline."

 ETH_Develop_Eritrea: "Develop Eritrea"
 ETH_Develop_Eritrea_desc: "Unlike the Italian imperialists, who had rarely invested in Eritrea, as a show of goodwill, we will begin heavy investments into the region."

 ETH_Invest_In_Industry: "Invest in Industry"
 ETH_Invest_In_Industry_desc: "Industrialisation is the only way forward. We cannot avoid this crucial policy as the empire requires more factories to boost its production."

 ETH_Legal_Equality: "Equality Before the Law"
 ETH_Legal_Equality_desc: "Much of the fringes of Ethiopia is occupied by people with long standing rivalries and discontent with the Amhara people and culture which dominates the Ethiopian state. By ensuring that these people are at least nominally equal in the eyes of the law to any Amhara person we can earn much goodwill and facilitate their integration with the rest of the country."

 ETH_Southern_Industrial_Expansion: "Southern Industrial Expansion"
 ETH_Southern_Industrial_Expansion_desc: "We shall expand our industrialisation programme and create new factories in the southern portion of our nation. That way, profits and jobs from this sector of the economy will be better distributed, boosting both productivity and profit."

 ETH_Military_On_The_DKAEB: "Ethiopian Military on the DKAEB"
 ETH_Military_On_The_DKAEB_desc: "We must demand our German partners allow our troops priority on the DKAEB railroad throughout our lands. Without this, we will be hamstrung by the preference the railroad currently gives to German troops."

 ETH_German_Investment: "German Investment"
 ETH_German_Investment_desc: "Since we have demonstrated our relative stability and unwavering loyalty towards Germany, perhaps they could begin investing abroad, in Ethiopia, to help combat the effects of Black Monday and, in the process, help better develop Ethiopia."

 ETH_German_Aid: "German Aid"
 ETH_German_Aid_desc: "We will ensure Germany does not forget the assistance we'd provided them with during the Weltkrieg. German investors, private and state-sponsored, will help bring prosperity to Ethiopia."

 ETH_German_Military_Mission: "German Military Mission"
 ETH_German_Military_Mission_desc: "Since we've already reached out to Germany with regards to receiving investment and aid, it would also be in our best interest to request military advisors in order to learn how to better drill our soldiers, improve our tactics, and, overall, modernise our army."

 ETH_A_German_Partner: "A German Partner"
 ETH_A_German_Partner_desc: "With our industry booming and local enemies dealt with, it is time to turn our attention to the world at large, and perhaps aid the Germans in this Weltkrieg like we did in the last."

 ETH_Japanese_Investment: "Japanese Investment"
 ETH_Japanese_Investment_desc: "Perhaps Japan could begin investing in Ethiopia to help combat the effects of Black Monday and, in the process, help better develop Ethiopia."

 ETH_Japanese_Aid: "Japanese Aid"
 ETH_Japanese_Aid_desc: "Japanese investors, private and state-sponsored, will help bring prosperity to Ethiopia."

 ETH_Japanese_Military_Mission: "Japanese Military Mission"
 ETH_Japanese_Military_Mission_desc: "Since we've already reached out to Japan with regards to receiving investment and aid, it would also be in our best interest to request military advisors in order to learn how to better drill our soldiers, improve our tactics, and, overall, modernise our army."

 ETH_A_Japanese_Partner: "A Japanese Partner"
 ETH_A_Japanese_Partner_desc: "With our industry booming and local enemies dealt with, it is time to turn our attention to the world at large."

 ETH_Debt: "Deal with our Debt"
 ETH_Debt_desc: "Upon the conclusion of the Weltkrieg, our national debt had, and has continued to, spiral out of control. Sorely needed reforms cannot be enacted until the issue of the debt has been fully dealt with."

 ETH_Tax_Church: "Tax the Church"
 ETH_Tax_Church_desc: "Alas, we must turn to taxing the church as the funds are desperately required by the empire to pay off its debt."

 ETH_Tax_Slaveowners: "Tax Slave-owners"
 ETH_Tax_Slaveowners_desc: "A large majority, if not all, slave owners are well off. By taxing slaves, we can extract more wealth from the extremely well-to-do citizens of our nation. While this may be seen as controversial by some, it will be a great boon to our budget."

 ETH_Tax_Oromo: "Tax the Oromo"
 ETH_Tax_Oromo_desc: "The Oromo people have been granted many privileges. We will need to end them in order to promote equality within the empire and improve our budget and, by extension, our ability to pay off our debt."

 ETH_Tax_Eritrea: "Introduce Taxation to Eritrea"
 ETH_Tax_Eritrea_desc: "We freed the Eritreans upon the conclusion of the Weltkrieg and granted them special privileges within the empire. However, the time for them has ended as most Eritreans see themselves as Ethiopians anyway and, if they truly believe themselves worthy of our great nation, they must begin contributing towards the prosperity of the empire."

 ETH_Budget: "Budget Readjustment"
 ETH_Budget_desc: "Due to budget reform and readjustment, we can finally begin the next step of the Emperor's plan: reforming the Empire."

 ETH_Haile: "Selassie's Reforms"
 ETH_Haile_desc: "Haile Selassie I is a reformer in the best possible way. He is a dynamic man who understands what is required to modernise Ethiopia and drag it out of the past, which it has been stuck in for far too long. While the path of modernisation will not be easy, it says a lot about the King's character and his willingness to help his nation."

 ETH_Educate_Slaves: "Educate the Slaves"
 ETH_Educate_Slaves_desc: "With former slaves now free, it is clear that we must take steps to properly integrate them within Ethiopian society. Incidentally, this has also coincided with our plans to reform and expand the education system. By undertaking these planned reforms, we will ensure that the future minds of Ethiopia are well educated!"

 ETH_Slavery_Question: "The Slavery Question"
 ETH_Slavery_Question_desc: "Slavery simply has no place in any modern nation, let alone the great empire envisioned by Haile Selassie I. Thankfully, the newly instituted slaveowner tax has meant that it is cheaper to hire workers than own slaves, and so the abolition of slavery will, most likely, not face great opposition. However, it will still be a massive undertaking to heal the social and cultural wounds endured by the oppressed folk."

 ETH_Agriculture_Initative: "Agriculture Initiative"
 ETH_Agriculture_Initative_desc: "Ensuring the existence of an organised agricultural sector, especially a prosperous one, is paramount to the future of the empire. As Ethiopia grows, so does its population and its food consumption. In order to avoid overextending our production capabilities and suffering from famines, we must begin undertaking significant agricultural reforms."

 ETH_Land_Reform: "Land Reform"
 ETH_Land_Reform_desc: "Land ownership within Ethiopia still operates based on an archaic system, where the people who hold the land only do so because of their abundant power or wealth. Legal ownership of land is uncommon and this has been a problem for quite a long time. It is time we begin the reformation of land ownership and distribution and actively enforce those laws."

 ETH_Modernise_Bureaucracy: "Modernise the Bureaucracy"
 ETH_Modernise_Bureaucracy_desc: "In order to modernise our empire, we must drag ourselves out of the Dark Ages of the Zemene Mesafint and begin centralisation, increasing efficiency within the government and the bureaucracy. Successfully implementing these new ideas, however, will be an arduous task."

 ETH_Tax_Question: "The Question of Taxation"
 ETH_Tax_Question_desc: "As it stands, we've no official tax code. In order to westernise our nation, reformation of the tax code is crucial. We currently have a few options in front of us: one, we can support the people and institute a land tax that will primarily fall on the wealthy, two, we can listen to our western advisors and push for a progressive tax system, and, three, we can listen to the aristocrats and institute a low, flat tax."

 ETH_Permanent_Feudal_Borders: "Permanent Feudal Borders"
 ETH_Permanent_Feudal_Borders_desc: "Order and stability within the empire are both of the utmost importance. We must decisively, yet gently, end the infighting between the upper classes lest they remain at each other's throats, threatening the empire's stability."

 ETH_Governorship_Question: "The Governorship Question"
 ETH_Governorship_Question_desc: "Deciding who will govern the various provinces of Ethiopia will be an extremely crucial decision, with many far-reaching consequences. That being said, we've a few options in front of us: we can allow the people to elect their respective governors, allow the Negus to appoint governors, or we can allow the upper class to govern their own lands."

 ETH_Ethiopia_Scout_Association: "Ethiopian Scout Association"
 ETH_Ethiopia_Scout_Association_desc: "The Ethiopian youth need to spend their bountiful energy in better, more productive pursuits. What better way to help them do that than by creating the Ethiopian Scout Association, a state-sponsored organisation which will help young men within our nation work on bettering the empire."

 ETH_Military_Question: "The Military Question"
 ETH_Military_Question_desc: "Currently, the officers within our army belong only to noble backgrounds or are members of the Selassie family, with commoners being denied promotion to most of the high positions within the military, no matter their competency. Perhaps we could allow commoners to serve as high-ranking officers within the army, promoting them based on merit instead of class."

 ETH_Finish_The_Reforms: "Finish the Reforms"
 ETH_Finish_The_Reforms_desc: "We've finally completed the reformation of the empire, with the only thing left being the ratification of those reforms through the creation of a new constitution."

 ETH_New_Constitucion: "New Constitution"
 ETH_New_Constitucion_desc: "A new constitution will be written up for the empire, containing and enforcing the reforms made by us during its drafting. The empire shall move forward, now stronger than ever!"

 ETH_People_Constitucion: "The Sewochi's Negus"
 ETH_People_Constitucion_desc: "The legitimacy of a ruler is derived from the support of his people. Haile Selassie I will be the first Ethiopian emperor to grant control of vast parts of the state's apparatus to democratically elected officials. The voice of the common folk and the disenfranchised shall be heard."

 ETH_Freedom_Speech: "Freedom of Speech"
 ETH_Freedom_Speech_desc: "The people deserve the right to say as they please, no matter if we agree with them or not, and the state should defend their right to say those things. Disagreement is how we, as a nation, can bring forth new ideas and, ultimately, progress."

 ETH_Freedom_Religion: "Freedom of Religion"
 ETH_Freedom_Religion_desc: "Ethiopia, in its lengthy history, has been the home of people of many faiths. From the Jews of old Axum to the Muslims of the walled city of Harar, citizens of Ethiopia, no matter their religion, shall live peacefully and free, equal to all."

 ETH_Enrich_People: "Enrich the People"
 ETH_Enrich_People_desc: "Poverty prevents our citizens from experiencing potential material gain and prosperity. We must protect even the poorest of our subjects, to ensure that each and every single one of them can possess an optimistic future."

 ETH_Elections: "Hold Elections"
 ETH_Elections_desc: "Ethiopia, for the first time ever, will organise free and democratic elections. Political parties are beginning to rally, people are getting ready to vote, and many are eager for what lies ahead while others are anxious. Who shall be the first Prime Minister, appointed by His Majesty himself?"

 ETH_Emperor_Constitucion: "The Negusa Nagast"
 ETH_Emperor_Constitucion_desc: "We've allowed men of inferior character and lesser status to impede Ethiopia's natural progression for far too long. We shall have to take measures to reorganise the empire in such a way that will allow for the Negus to rightfully assume a position of power and authority."

 ETH_Revered_Emperor: "Revered Emperor"
 ETH_Revered_Emperor_desc: "The citizens of Ethiopia must keep in mind that His Majesty, Haile Selassie I, has brought peace, stability, freedom, and justice to the reformed Empire of Ethiopia."

 ETH_Control_Church: "Control the Church"
 ETH_Control_Church_desc: "Those who are faithful require proper guidance. Not from those who would seek earthly power or material possession, but from those who will ensure that peace and stability are maintained within the empire through the blessed rule of the King of Kings."

 ETH_Royal_Advisors: "Royal Advisors"
 ETH_Royal_Advisors_desc: "Only those who are close, and qualified, advisors to the Emperor shall have a say in the governance of His Majesty's empire. That way, we can ensure efficient governance and quality leadership."

 ETH_Lion_Of_Judah: "Lion of Judah"
 ETH_Lion_Of_Judah_desc: "From the entourage who helped escort the Queen of Sheba back home, His Majesty, Selassie, is the embodiment of the symbol of the mighty lion and the 225th king from King David. The greatest of all earthly lords, His Majesty has had a legacy so grand, that it outshines even his mighty efforts to help further Ethiopia's glory."

 ETH_Noble_Constitucion: "The Mekwanint's Negus"
 ETH_Noble_Constitucion_desc: "The noble lords and ladies of Ethiopia have managed to hold the empire together for millennia and shall continue to do so! Concerns such as the budget and management of the military are too trivial to bother the mighty King of Kings. Instead, his vassals shall tend to these affairs in his stead."

 ETH_Noble_Investment: "Noble Investments"
 ETH_Noble_Investment_desc: "We shall ensure that Ethiopia acquires whatever it deems necessary, by any means necessary. No matter the cost nor the people we shall deal with in order to acquire these necessities."

 ETH_Power_Of_Tradition: "Power of Tradition"
 ETH_Power_Of_Tradition_desc: "Nobles are of such high stature not because of their blood or ancestral ties, but because they have been trained from birth to obtain and better their skills as administrators, soldiers, or businessmen. Why alter a system that has worked, and will continue to work, for millennia?"

 ETH_Noble_Armies: "Mekwanint Armies"
 ETH_Noble_Armies_desc: "Our armies possess men who have been trained from birth to effectively and decisively lead our troops. In addition, with the recent acquisition of proper equipment and superior training for our foot soldiers, victory is only a natural outcome against any foe."

 ETH_Power_Council: "Power to the Council"
 ETH_Power_Council_desc: "It is time for a council made up of nobles to seize full power of the government from Selassie's thugs. From now on, Selassie will rule as a King among Kings, remaining a weak figurehead for the council to rally behind, if needed."

 ETH_Military_Reforms: "Military Reforms"
 ETH_Military_Reforms_desc: "Our military's performance during the Weltkrieg was, unfortunately, very poor. We shall evaluate the reason for this and discover a proper solution, so that we may reclaim and retake our territory in Ogaden; rightfully ours by treaty and law."

 ETH_Hire_Askari_Veterans: "Hire Askari Veterans"
 ETH_Hire_Askari_Veterans_desc: "Many of the Askari veterans within Mittelafrika tire of their garrison duty, constantly patrolling for unseen foes. We shall bring them here, where their skills and experience can be properly utilised."

 ETH_New_Arms_Production: "New Arms Production"
 ETH_New_Arms_Production_desc: "We must increase our efforts to better equip our army as, according to the Askari, our handguns are better suited to remain a part of a hunter's collection than remain in an army's arsenal."

 ETH_Import_Small_Arms: "Import Small Arms"
 ETH_Import_Small_Arms_desc: "The poor state and quality of our handguns can be improved, however, with some effort on our part by reverse engineering foreign models. The issue, however, is purchasing said guns."

 ETH_Artillery_Effort: "Artillery Effort"
 ETH_Artillery_Effort_desc: "As the Weltkrieg has shown us, and the rest of the world, artillery is an extremely vital part of modern warfare. Yet, we've never been able to master these large-calibre guns. Thankfully, our foreign advisors understand how to design and man these shell-firing guns."

 ETH_Buy_Tanks: "Buy Tanks Designs"
 ETH_Buy_Tanks_desc: "While tanks and other mechanised vehicles may be ill-suited for the highlands of Gondar, they may make all the difference in the flat plains of Ogaden and could be the deciding factor on whether or not we experience victory or defeat."

 ETH_Foreign_Doctrine: "Foreign Doctrine"
 ETH_Foreign_Doctrine_desc: "The military high command has reached a unanimous conclusion: hurling wave after wave of militia at the enemy may not be the best course of action. Perhaps it would be best to ask our foreign officers/advisors what would be the best course of action? Noble officers can be rather stubborn, after all..."

 ETH_Improve_Firepower: "Improve Firepower"
 ETH_Improve_Firepower_desc: "Victory will be achieved through the use of extensive firepower! Our enemies shall be trampled by both the might and range of our guns! We shall take steps to better utilise these guns, in order to achieve maximum efficiency."

 ETH_Modernise_High_Command: "Modernise High Command"
 ETH_Modernise_High_Command_desc: "Perhaps we should refine our military doctrine and, instead of attacking the enemy with the use of brute force, we should choose men who are patient, proper, and skilled to plan and lead our army."

 ETH_Legacy_Of_Adowa: "Legacy of Adowa"
 ETH_Legacy_Of_Adowa_desc: "We cannot nor will we ever rely on foreigners to acquire victory. The people of the world have, for far too long, forgotten the might of the Victory of Adwa. All of Africa shall see us for what we truly are; the mighty lion!"

 ETH_Ethiopian_Guns: "Ethiopian Guns"
 ETH_Ethiopian_Guns_desc: "By utilising foreign expertise and basing our designs off of external blueprints, we can ensure Ethiopian-made guns, made by Ethiopians for Ethiopians, are of the highest calibre whilst remaining inexpensive."

 ETH_Anti_Imperialist_Spirit: "Anti-imperialist Spirit"
 ETH_Anti_Imperialist_Spirit_desc: "Those who attempt to conquer us continually underestimate our spirit and determination. From Wofla to Adwa, envious and unscrupulous vultures attempt to break our spirit and subjugate the people of Ethiopia. So long as our spirit lives on, they shall never succeed!"

 ETH_Improve_Drilling: "Improve Drilling"
 ETH_Improve_Drilling_desc: "We will sharpen minds, tire legs, train arms, and, through relentless drilling, shape these ragged folk we call 'soldiers' into proper and trim fighting men!"

 ETH_Trust_Officers: "Trust our Officers"

 ETH_Develop_Weapons: "Develop Weapons"
 ETH_Develop_Weapons_desc: "Rather than purely copying advanced techniques, we should also ensure that our guns are designed and built within the empire, for the men of the empire."

 ETH_Professional_Army: "Professional Army"
 ETH_Professional_Army_desc: "We have managed to triumph in resolving the failures of our army and have turned them into advantageous successes. Our army, which was once a mass of conscripted men, has now become a truly proper and organised fighting force. We can now direct our focus towards our peacetime affairs, as we are truly prepared in the case of a war."

 ETH_Doctrine_I: "Naval Planning Effort"
 ETH_Doctrine_I_desc: "Understanding naval tactics is far more than merely steering a ship towards enemy waters. Missions and operational hierarchy are vital components of any naval doctrine. Thankfully, because of its young age, our navy is flexible and able to adapt to any sort of change."

 ETH_Submarine_Effort: "Submarine Effort"
 ETH_Submarine_Effort_desc: "Because of the strategic location of our ports near the Gulf of Aden, it is important that we invest in submarine technology in order to destroy enemy shipping lanes and, subsequently, starve them of desperately needed supplies."

 ETH_Submarine_Doctrine: "Submarine Doctrine"

 ETH_Doctrine_II_desc: "The creation of a proper school for prospective naval officers is paramount to the war at sea. As war fast approaches, we must ensure that our officers are ready to adapt and conquer the ever-changing tactics at sea."

 ETH_Dream_Sky: "Control of the Sky"
 ETH_Dream_Sky_desc: "Control of the skies is within our reach, but it could soon slip out of our grasp. News has reached Addis Ababa that Somalia is planning the purchase of more airplanes in order to expand its air force. The goal of this blatant escalation of tensions is obvious and shall not go unanswered!"

 ETH_Hire_Experts: "Hire Aviation Experts"
 ETH_Hire_Experts_desc: "In order to truly wrest control of the skies, it is clear that we will require the advice of experienced foreign experts. When we acquire the skills these experts possess, only then can we fully wrest full aerial control of the Horn!"

 ETH_Advanced_Doctrine: "Advanced Doctrine"
 ETH_Advanced_Doctrine_desc: "Planning air missions is a rather complicated matter due to the sheer number of factors that must be taken into account. Weather, distance, and the number of enemy forces must all be equally considered. However, most of our pilots are either not qualified or talented enough to understand the basics of aerial planning. Training them would be the obvious resolution to such an issue."

 ETH_Train_Pilots: "Train our Pilots"
 ETH_Train_Pilots_desc: "Possessing planes means little if our pilots are unable to skilfully and properly fly them. The Imperial Air Force can become a force to be reckoned with; however, we must give it the attention it deserves before it can reach such a level."

 ETH_Skylions: "Skylions"
 ETH_Skylions_desc: "The training of a group of men, who rank amongst the best of our pilots, shall take place. They will, with the heart of a lion, fall straight from the skies into battle and strike where we could never hope to reach and win the fight we could never hope to win!"

 ETH_Crush_Somalia: "Crush Somalia"
 ETH_Crush_Somalia_desc: "Ogaden is rightfully ours as mandated by the treaty which ended the Weltkrieg. However, the weakness of previous rulers and trouble within Eritrea prevented us from enforcing this claim.

 ETH_Pacify_Ogaden: "Pacify the Ogaden"
 ETH_Pacify_Ogaden_desc: "The easiest part of conquest is often gaining control of the land itself.

Integrating Ogaden into Ethiopia is of the utmost importance, so that we may retain control of the land and its people."

 ETH_Technical_Experts: "Invite Technical Experts"
 ETH_Technical_Experts_desc: "Ethiopia is sorely lacking in terms of industrial capacity and manufacturing. On top of that, our economy is largely feudal and isolated from the wider world.

 ETH_Coffee_Harvesting: "Modernise Coffee Harvesting"
 ETH_Coffee_Harvesting_desc: "Coffee may have originated and been domesticated in Ethiopia but when it comes to international sales our output lies well below newer players on the market like Brazil.

### Intro Screen ###
 ETH_country_intro_header: "Ethiopia, an Empire at a Crossroads"
 ETH_country_intro_content: "Abyssinia, also known as Ethiopia, is the only African state to have remained independent in the 19th century, having successfully repelled an Italian invasion in 1896. This victory was symbolic of the process of modernisation within the Abyssinian Empire, which sought to bring the country up to European standards in terms of its economy, military and administration.\n\nIn 1918, under Empress Zewditu, Abyssinia entered the Weltkrieg on the side of the Germans, successfully annexing the Italian colony of Eritrea and dealing with the pretender Emperor Iyasu. However, the army performed rather poorly against the Italian garrisons and the few Entente raids into the Empire. Control over the disputed area of Harar was not enforced as the Somali forces who held much of the area could not and have not been dislodged to this day.\n\nWhen the old Empress Zewditu died without surviving children, her cousin, regent and often rival Ras Tafari Makonnen ascended to the throne as Emperor Haile Selassie. The new monarch announced his intention to introduce a new series of reforms in order to westernise Abyssinia, as the main leader of the reactionary faction, his predecessor, was now out of the picture. These initiatives, however, are fiercely opposed by the conservative nobility of the nation, lesser kings and dukes who saw in Zewditu someone much more amenable to their vision for the Empire.\n\nTies with Germany, the new owners of nearby Djibouti, were strengthened when a railway was built (largely with German capital) between this outpost, Addis Ababa, and Kenya. Relations have since been positive, despite reports of eccentric behaviour by the new Mittelafrikan governor. But relations with Somalia and its Ottoman backers remain strained at best, and confrontation seems inevitable. The Emperor knows that such a war would require a united Empire, under one banner and one cause, as the ambitious dukes might well side with an enemy if left unchecked and so matters at home must be dealt with first."

### Events ###
 ethiopia.2.t: "The DKAEB Nears Bankruptcy"
 ethiopia.2.d: "The Deutsche Kaiserliche Abessinien Eisenbahn (DKAEB) railway was established in the early 20th century, linking Addis Ababa, in Ethiopia, to Djibouti. After a series of German-backed expansions, it is now used mainly to transport ore from the Congo Basin, in Mittelafrika, to Djibouti. The present economic downturn in the world has meant that ore is no longer being purchased at the rate it once was and so the future of the DKAEB railway is in question. This could be a great opportunity to rid ourselves of this economic domination.\n\nOf course, severing such economic ties with the Germans will also mean that they will be unlikely to invest in us in the future, and we will find ourselves diplomatically isolated from them. The correct course is uncertain, though the choice may be made for us should we not have our priorities clear."
 ethiopia.2.a: "We must keep an eye out."
 ethiopia.2.b: "It would be more trouble than it's worth."
 ethiopia.2.c: "We would do well to take it off their hands."

 ethiopia.3.t: "Mittelafrika Takes Control of the DKAEB"
 ethiopia.3.d: "With the looming bankruptcy of the DKAEB in mind, the Mittelafrikan administration in Dar-es-Salaam has bought the state-owned section of the railroad from the German government. If Mittelafrika is able to keep the conduit running throughout this Depression, we might emerge from this crisis with stronger ties to the German giant. If they fail, however, the consequences could be disastrous."
 ethiopia.3.a: "Our relationship with Dar-es-Salaam grows stronger, for now."

 ethiopia.4.t: "DKAEB Abandoned by the German Empire"
 ethiopia.4.d: "With the looming bankruptcy of the DKAEB in mind, the German government has offered to sell the state-owned section of the railroad to our government for a low price. If we do not accept, it is likely a European or North American consortium will take the railroad over, confirming foreign influence in our economy."
 ethiopia.4.a: "We don't need to spend the money."
 ethiopia.4.b: "We will buy the shares."

 ethiopia.5.t: "The DKAEB Stays Afloat"
 ethiopia.5.d: "The choice of the Mittelafrikan colonial government to keep the railroad afloat has paid off, as Governor [MAF.GetLeader] has kept the DKAEB running throughout the crisis. Our relationship with the German Empire has grown stronger."
 ethiopia.5.a: "Good news."

 ethiopia.6.t: "The DKAEB Goes Bankrupt!"
 ethiopia.6.d: "The Deutsche Kaiserliche Abessinien Eisenbahn has gone bankrupt! This major transport link, running from the Congo to Djibouti through Ethiopia, has been forced to shut down. Large numbers of people now stand jobless, and our relationship with Mittelafrika has been damaged."
 ethiopia.6.a: "We will take the railroad over."
 ethiopia.6.b: "Find another foreign investor!"

 ethiopia.7.t: "Ethiopia's Place on the World Stage"
 ethiopia.7.d.germanyatwar: "With the defeat of Somalia, Emperor Haile Selassie has declared it the right time to take stock of Ethiopia's diplomatic position. The Germans, our friends, are now fighting for the survival of monarchy - that is, just rule - against the ravages of anarchism from the decadent Western Europeans. Should we join the fight against these godless radicals, or remain neutral?"
 ethiopia.7.d.germanyvictorious: "With the defeat of Somalia, Emperor Haile Selassie has declared it the right time to take stock of Ethiopia's diplomatic position. The Germans, our friends, have defeated the godless anarchists of France and Britain. Perhaps it is best to join the Reichspakt, and ensure our security in a German world. Should we join our friends, or remain neutral?"
 ethiopia.7.d.japanatwar: "With the defeat of Somalia, Emperor Haile Selassie has declared it the right time to take stock of Ethiopia's diplomatic position. The Japanese, our friends, are now fighting for the survival of monarchy - that is, just rule - against the ravages of anarchism from the decadent western powers. Should we join the fight against these imperialists, or remain neutral?"
 ethiopia.7.d.japanvictorious: "With the defeat of Somalia, Emperor Haile Selassie has declared it the right time to take stock of Ethiopia's diplomatic position. The Japanese, our friends, have defeated the imperialist Germans in Asia. Perhaps it is best to join the Co-Prosperity Sphere, and ensure our security in a free world. Should we join our friends, or remain neutral?"
 ethiopia.7.a: "We must contribute to the global fight against syndicalism!"
 ethiopia.7.a1: "We must contribute to the global fight against western imperialism!"
 ethiopia.7.b: "We should join the Reichspakt!"
 ethiopia.7.b1: "We should join the Co-Prosperity Sphere!"
 ethiopia.7.c: "We will ask for a German guarantee only."
 ethiopia.7.c1: "We will ask for a Japanese guarantee only."

 ethiopia.8.t: "Drought!"
 ethiopia.8.d: "A great drought has swept through eastern Ethiopia. With the economy already weakened by the decline of the DKAEB, we are now at risk of facing mass starvation as crops continually fail."
 ethiopia.8.a: "Damn!"
 ethiopia.8.b: "Use the newly nationalised railway to distribute food!"

 ethiopia.9.t: "Budget Readjustment"
 ethiopia.9.d: "Now that we have taxed our people and institutions enough to pay off our crippling debts, it is time we began the readjustment of our budget and ended this debt crisis once and for all. We can choose to refocus the aim of our budget on one of three things: military production, civilian production, or construction. Which one shall we choose?"
 ethiopia.9.a: "Military Production."
 ethiopia.9.b: "Civilian Production."
 ethiopia.9.c: "Construction."

 ethiopia.10.t: "Reforms in Ethiopia"
 ethiopia.10.d: "Our emperor, Haile Selassie, is known to hold the ambition of modernising the country. This includes not only plans to build new factories, the reformation of our infrastructure, and the modernisation of our army, but also several legal and institutional reforms that will, hopefully, improve the Ethiopian quality of life. However, the broadening of these reforms will mean an end to the many privileges held by the nobility."
 ethiopia.10.a: "Start the reforms."

 ethiopia.11.t: "Question of Slavery"
 ethiopia.11.d: "The institution of slavery is still widespread in Ethiopia, with almost 2 million people currently living under its oppressive rule. This has brought much criticism from the west upon Ethiopia and it is quite obvious we must abolish this institution in order to truly westernise our nation. However, the nobility will be quite angry with this change and we may instead institute a new law, nicknamed the 'Freedom of Womb', to try and appease them and delay the death of slavery, yet slowly kill it off."
 ethiopia.11.a: "Abolish Slavery!"
 ethiopia.11.b: "We must delay the abolition, Freedom of Womb."

 ethiopia.12.t: "Land Reform"
 ethiopia.12.d: "Land ownership within Ethiopia still operates based on an archaic system, where the people who hold the land only do so because of their abundant power or wealth. Legal ownership of land is uncommon and this has been a problem for quite a long time. It is time we begin the reformation of land ownership and distribution and actively enforce those laws. There are a few ways we can go about doing so: "
 ethiopia.12.a: "Redistribute the land to the people."
 ethiopia.12.b: "All land shall be owned in name by the Negus."
 ethiopia.12.c: "Formalise the current ownership under the nobility."

 ethiopia.13.t: "Tax Reform"
 ethiopia.13.d: "The Empire of Ethiopia has never, in its entire history, formalised an official tax code. In order to westernise we must begin the reformation and finalisation of our tax code. There are a few options: we can listen to the people and institute a land tax, which will fall primarily on the rich landowners, we can listen to our western advisors, who advise us to copy the progressive tax system of the European powers, or we can listen to the nobles and institute a low flat tax."
 ethiopia.13.a: "Institute a land tax."
 ethiopia.13.b: "Institute a progressive tax."
 ethiopia.13.c: "Institute a flat tax."

 ethiopia.14.t: "Governorship Reform"
 ethiopia.14.d: "It is time to decide who will govern the various provinces of the Ethiopian empire. There are a few options: we can either allow the people to elect their governors, we can allow the Negus to appoint them, or we can allow the nobles to govern their own land."
 ethiopia.14.a: "Governors should be elected by the people."
 ethiopia.14.b: "The Negus shall appoint his governors."
 ethiopia.14.c: "Let the nobles govern their own land."

 ethiopia.15.t: "Military Reform"
 ethiopia.15.d: "As it stands, our army is commanded by nobles and members of the Selassie family. Commoners are barred from most, if not all, of the high positions within the military — even if they possess a better understanding of military affairs or warfare than the nobles. Should we allow commoners to hold high ranking positions within the army?"
 ethiopia.15.a: "Military positions shall be meritocratic."
 ethiopia.15.b: "Keep the army as it is."

 ethiopia.16.t: "End of the Reforms"
 ethiopia.16.d: "Selassie's era of reforms is now over. For better, or for worse, the nation has changed radically and modernisation has been achieved. The Lion of Judah has been added to the empire's flag in order to symbolise the rebirth of the Ethiopian empire and it is now time to start looking towards the drafting and formalisation of a new constitution for the empire."
 ethiopia.16.a: "God bless the Lion."

 ethiopia.17.t: "Selassie's Constitution"
 ethiopia.17.d: "Selassie has managed to secure supreme power for himself, and this is reflected in the new constitution. It includes many articles which bestow powers upon the Negus, however it also contains reforms built towards modernising the legal framework of Ethiopia. Ethiopia is now very much the Emperor's nation."
 ethiopia.17.a: "All hail the Lion of Judah."

 ethiopia.18.t: "Mekawint's Constitution"
 ethiopia.18.d: "Through the blocking of many reforms and the institution of their own, the nobles have managed to secure power for themselves, and the new constitution reflects this. It contains articles that grant absolute power to the Upper House, which is dominated by nobles, and restricts democracy and the Emperor's power. The age-old traditions of Ethiopia have been protected and it will continue to remain a country of the nobles and for the nobles."
 ethiopia.18.a: "The Negusa Nesat is weak."

 ethiopia.19.t: "People's Constitution"
 ethiopia.19.d: "Haile Selassie has instituted reforms that have westernised and brought democracy to the country, and the new constitution reflects this. It contains articles that protect the freedoms of the people and empowers the Lower House, which is controlled by the people. The power of the nobles, and even Selassie himself, has been restricted and it is clear that Ethiopia is now a westernised, constitutional monarchy."
 ethiopia.19.a: "The people are strong."

 ethiopia.20.t: "The First Elections"
 ethiopia.20.d: "For the first time in Ethiopia's grand history, democratic, and fair, elections will take place. The main participants within the election are: the right-wing 'Democratic League', the centre-right 'United Ethiopian Democratic Forces', the centre-left 'Coalition for Unity and Democracy', and the left-wing 'Ethiopian People's Democratic Front'. The ballots have been counted, and the winners of the election are the: "
 ethiopia.20.a: "Democratic League."
 ethiopia.20.b: "United Ethiopian Democratic Forces."
 ethiopia.20.c: "Coalition for Unity and Democracy."
 ethiopia.20.e: "Ethiopian People's Democratic Front."

 ethiopia.21.t: "The Ethiopian Elections of [GetYear]"
 ethiopia.21.d: "As stipulated by our constitution, free and fair elections are to take place every five years. The main participants in the election are: the right-wing 'Democratic League', the centre-right 'United Ethiopian Democratic Forces', the centre-left 'Coalition for Unity and Democracy', and the left-wing 'Ethiopian People's Democratic Front'. The ballots have been counted, and the winners of the election are the: "
 ethiopia.21.a: "Democratic League."
 ethiopia.21.b: "United Ethiopian Democratic Forces."
 ethiopia.21.c: "Coalition for Unity and Democracy."
 ethiopia.21.e: "Ethiopian People's Democratic Front."

 ethiopia.22.t: "Power to the Council"
 ethiopia.22.d: "It is time for the council of nobles to seize full control of the government from Selassie's goons, as from now on, he will be ruling as a King among Kings, remaining a weak figurehead for the council to rally behind, if and when he is needed."
 ethiopia.22.a: "Praise the council."

 ethiopia.23.t: "Eritrean Revolt!"
 ethiopia.23.d: "The people of Eritrea have had enough of being taxed to oblivion, and with the tribal leaders and army officers remaining unintegrated, Eritrean nationalists have managed to organise a revolt against our rule during this desperate time of war. We must begin swift mobilisation in order to put them down and ensure stability!"
 ethiopia.23.a: "Damned backstabbers!"

 ethiopia.24.t: "The Empire of Ethiopia Requests a Military Mission"
 ethiopia.24.d: "The Empire of Ethiopia has been brought more closely into the German fold since Mittelafrika bought our shares in the DKAEB railroad in 1936, and they are now requesting a German military mission to modernise their army. If they are victorious in the upcoming war against their Somali foes, they may even join the Reichspakt."
 ethiopia.24.d2: "The Empire of Ethiopia has been brought more closely into the Japanese fold since we brought the DKAEB railroad under our management in 1936, and they are now requesting a Japanese military mission to modernise their army. If they are victorious in the upcoming war against their Somali foes, they may even join the Co-Prosperity Sphere."
 ethiopia.24.a: "A small sacrifice for an ally!"
 ethiopia.24.b: "Do we really need Ethiopia?"

 ethiopia.25.t: "Germany Agrees to Send a Military Mission"
 ethiopia.25.t2: "Japan Agrees to Send a Military Mission"
 ethiopia.25.d: "The Germans are agreeable to our motions of friendship and have dispatched a military mission to aid us in our struggle with our regional adversaries. Once again, our Christian brothers have given us the help we need."
 ethiopia.25.d2: "The Japanese are agreeable to our motions of friendship and have dispatched a military mission to aid us in our struggle with our regional adversaries. They have clearly seen the benefits of our mutual struggle against western imperialism."
 ethiopia.25.a: "Even better than the Portuguese."

 ethiopia.26.t: "Germany Refuses to Aid Us"
 ethiopia.26.t2: "Japan Refuses to Aid Us"
 ethiopia.26.d: "The imperialist and Eurocentrist Germans have refused to help organise our army in any way. It seems our partnership with the German Empire has come to an abrupt end."
 ethiopia.26.d2: "The two-faced and arrogant Japanese have refused to help organise our army in any way. It seems our partnership with the Empire of Japan has come to an abrupt end."
 ethiopia.26.a: "Alone, then!"

 ethiopia.27.t: "The Empire of Ethiopia Requests Alliance"
 ethiopia.27.d.ethiopiaatwar: "Our brother monarch in Addis Ababa has noticed our plight in Western Europe and has already declared war on the godless syndicalists. Should we agree to incorporate our old Weltkrieg ally into our alliance?"
 ethiopia.27.d.ethiopianotatwar: "Our partner in Ethiopia has approached us, asking for an alliance between Ethiopia and Germany. With Sudan and Somalia no longer a threat to Ethiopia, we would be taking few risks in allying with them, but they could not offer us a lot, either."
 ethiopia.27.d.ethiopiaatwar2: "Our brother monarch in Addis Ababa has noticed our plight in Greater Asia and has already declared war on the German imperialists. Should we agree to let Ethiopia into our alliance?"
 ethiopia.27.d.ethiopianotatwar2: "Our partner in Ethiopia has approached us, asking for an alliance between Ethiopia and Japan. With Sudan and Somalia no longer a threat to Ethiopia, we would be taking few risks in allying with them, but they could not offer us a lot, either."
 ethiopia.27.a: "Accept their offer!"
 ethiopia.27.b: "Who needs Ethiopia?"

 ethiopia.28.t: "Germany Accepts!"

 ethiopia.28.d: "The Germans have agreed to let us join the Reichspakt! Our future in a German-dominated world is assured."
 ethiopia.28.d2: "The Japanese have agreed to let us join the Co-Prosperity Sphere! Our future in a world free of western imperialism is assured."
 ethiopia.28.a: "Hurrah for diplomacy!"

 ethiopia.29.t: "Germany Refuses Alliance"
 ethiopia.29.t2: "Japan Refuses Alliance"
 ethiopia.29.d: "The Germans have clearly indicated they feel they do not need our help or friendship. Although we will maintain a partnership, it seems the Germans will not be our allies."

 ethiopia.30.d2: "Having vanquished Somalia, our partners in Ethiopia have decided not to involve themselves in more wars. They request a Japanese guarantee of their territorial integrity, but offer little in return besides promises."

 ethiopia.32.d: "A massive breakdown occurred yesterday in Berlin's stock market. The German economy is in tatters, and with our largest trade partner in such straits, our economy is feeling the effects too.
