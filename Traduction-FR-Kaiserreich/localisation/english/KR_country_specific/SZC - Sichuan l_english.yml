 SZC_totalist_party_long: "Kuomintang\n§gThe Kuomintang's influence in Sichuan is primarily felt through the presence of the Officer Department's guerrilla forces, secretive political clubs in the urban city centres and in rural communes throughout the countryside. Among these, it is the Officer Department which can wield the most direct political power and stands a slim but still plausible chance of bringing the three principles to Sichuan. Yet they are also moderate and cautious, whilst the radical propagandist and peasant leaders adhere to more irreverent, reckless displays of ideological fanaticism. Those few organisations within the province who preach such extreme beliefs as Syndicalism or Wang Jingwei Thought remain a helpful asset to the Officer Department, but largely powerless on their own.§!\n"

 SZC_social_democrat_party: "Officer Department"
 SZC_social_democrat_party_long: "Officer Department (Junguan Xi)\n§gThe Officer Department emerged as a political force in Sichuan after Tang Jiyao's invasion of the region in 1931, wherein numerous republican aligned officers were recruited to Yunnan's side and organised into a rival Sichuan government in an attempt to weaken Yang Sen's legitimacy. Whilst Tang Jiyao's invasion failed and the officers were driven into hiding as a weakened guerrilla force, their radical political legacy still endures.\n\nAmong those who rallied under Tang's banner were numerous Kuomintang generals, chief among them Lü Chao, who sought to bring peace and stability to Sichuan in the form of implementing Sun Yat-sen's famous three revolutionary principles. Whilst Lü Chao may have alienated many of his colleagues, thanks to his political ambitions and leftist beliefs, he has gained a sizeable following among younger, more radical recruits, who have eagerly flocked to his vision to destroy the warlordism and corruption that has plagued Sichuan for decades.§!\n"

Whilst Tang Jiyao's invasion failed and the officers were driven into hiding as a weakened guerrilla force, their radical political legacy still endures.\n\nOne of Tang's personally handpicked leaders for the Officer Department was an old colleague, Xiong Kewu, a former governor of the province who had administered it during the Xinhai Revolution. Xiong and Tang shared many political principles, most notably in regards to Federalism, but Xiong had an independent streak and desired to run the Officer Department himself, free of the Yunnan Clique's heavy handed political influence. He eventually worked to organise an independent base of power, joining forces with old friends and enemies, such as Lü Chao and other senior officers to operate free of Tang's meddling.§!\n"
 SZC_market_liberal_party: "Baoding Department"
 SZC_market_liberal_party_long: "Baoding Department (Baoding Xi)\n§gAs its name implies, the Baoding Department was formed by graduates of the Baoding military academy and officers of the Baoding army, who either originated in Sichuan or found themselves stationed in the province. Although they are considered politically liberal and fiscally responsible, the Baoding Department has earned a reputation for favouritism and nepotism, as well as frequently interfering with Yang Sen's government. Liu Wenhui, the uncle of the infamous Industrial Corps leader Liu Xiang, perhaps best embodies the liberal politics of these senior generals, with his laissez-faire approach to governance, he has conceded much ideological ground to the well-educated and well-meaning progressives in his department, as long as he can maintain his hold over Sichuan's opium production and foreign policy. Although this has led to some radical reforms, some believe Wenhui's greed and ambition ultimately hinders Sichuan's potential.§!\n"
 SZC_social_conservative_party: "Baoding Department"
 SZC_social_conservative_party_long: "Baoding Department (Baoding Xi)\n§gAs its name implies, the Baoding Department was formed by graduates of the Baoding military academy and officers of the Baoding army, who either originated in Sichuan or found themselves stationed in the province. Although they are considered politically liberal and fiscally responsible, the Baoding Department has earned a reputation for favouritism and nepotism, as well as frequently interfering with Yang Sen's government. Deng Xihou's faction within the Baoding Department is quite idealistic and believes in implementing genuine reforms, unlike some of his more pragmatic peers which merely pay lip service to these ideals. Deng's name is almost synonymous with fiscal responsibility thanks to his “Model Province Project”. To implement these impressive reforms he has built up extensive connections in the Sichuan, allowing him to greatly influence the government's military as well as economic developments.§!\n"
 SZC_authoritarian_democrat_party: "Armament Department"
 SZC_authoritarian_democrat_party_long: "Armament Department (Wubei Xi)\n§gThe Armament Department enjoyed a half decade of prestige after Yang Sen was recognised as the legitimate ruler of Sichuan by the Zhili Clique, but the bold and cunning general slowly witnessed his grip slip away. The Yunnan Clique's invasion of his province was the last straw which corroded his authority, putting much of Sichuan back in the hands of warlords and radicals. The Armament Department was forced to adapt to these disastrous circumstances and reluctantly invited several of these key warlords to join the government.\n\nYang since then strove to rebuild his authority over Sichuan, but faced great resistance from the newly emboldened warlords, as well as opportunists within his own clique such as the Confucian general Liu Cunhou and the leader of the bandit suppression army, Tian Songyao. Much of the department doubts if Yang can maintain this moribund, decentralised government much longer. His generals eagerly hope he will at last rein in the warlords, or finally give up and make way for a more aggressive leader like Cunhou. Without a firebrand like him to egg them on however, the generals may very well fall back in line behind Yang.§!\n"
 SZC_paternal_autocrat_party: "Industrial Corps"
 SZC_paternal_autocrat_party_long: "Industrial Corps (Shiye Tuan)\n§gThe enormous army of the Industrial Corps, led by Chongqing warlord Liu Xiang, is frequently derided by Zhili Loyalists and progressive officers as nothing more than a host of bandits. Whilst it is true that his oversized military favours quantity over quality and has certain moral failures, the Industrial Corps have accomplished great things thanks to their raw manpower and their intense firepower. The fact that Xiang has managed to keep his hold over south-eastern Sichuan as well keep his countless men paid and fed is testament to this fact.\n\nAfter being passed up for governorship of Sichuan and left bereft of any recognition from the Zhili Clique he had once so loyally served, Liu Xiang turned his attention towards taking what he declared was rightfully his, now by force and cunning. He has pushed for genuine modernisation and economic reforms, caring little for short term profits from bandit and opium selling when there is so much more up for grab, should the Industrial Corps successfully expand their influence over Sichuan. These aggressive policies mean Xiang's army and his reforms both rely on raw momentum, a single mislaid plan or an unexpected roadblock in his path could grind his ambitions to a halt.§!\n"
 SZC_national_populist_party: "YCP"
 SZC_national_populist_party_long: "Young China Party (Zhongguo Qingniandang)\n§gBorn from the student \"Young China Society\", the Young China Party would be one of the society's successors, as it split into \"nationalist\", \"socialist\" and \"idealist\" factions, led by Zeng Qi and Li Huang, Li Dazhao, and Wang Guangqi respectively. Travelling to France to study, Zeng Qi and Li Huang and the other members of their nationalist faction would engage in spats with other students in France such as Zhou Enlai, Cai Yuanpei and Li Shizeng.\n\nSometimes becoming violent, the amassment of support for the Chinese Syndicalist Party would result in Zeng and Li forming their own party, announcing the formation of the Young China Party in 1923, outside Paris. Developing rapidly amongst Chinese student organisations, the Young China Party would stand in concrete opposition towards the Kuomintang's cooperation with the CSP, and the YCP would return to Shanghai founding a series of political societies and newspapers in 1924.\n\nIngratiated both within Sun Chuanfang's forces, the likes of Yuan Zuming in Guizhou and most importantly the nation's assembly within Beijing, the Young China Party naturally retains a local branch within its home province of Sichuan. Carrying large influence within local military forces and administrations, the Young China Party is perhaps its strongest in Sichuan.§!\n"

 SZC_Liu_Cunhou_party_long: "Armament Department (Wubei Xi)\n§gIn the wake of Yang Sen's sudden, unfortunate death, coupled with the rapid disintegration of the Armament Department's political rivals, a massive power vacuum emerged in Sichuan Province. The position of leadership was swiftly filled by a popular, charismatic figure among the Armament Department's generals, the zealous Confucian and chaotic rabble rouser Liu Cunhou.\n\nLiu has in many ways turned Sichuan's greatest weakness, its factional disputes and decentralised government, into his own greatest strength. By bribing, threatening, extorting and executing those generals who have questioned his authority, he has filled much of the province with loyal yes men and greedy opportunists, who will gladly manage their own fiefs and maximise the province's overall profit through completely unscrupulous measures. Whilst this chaotic confederation of warlords is functioning for the moment, some of Liu's colleagues quietly doubt if it can hold on for the foreseeable future. However few dare to bring this up to his face and none have ever done so twice.§!\n"

Following Feng's death in 1919, the Zhili Clique would become split between three endeavouring warlords — Cao Kun, Wu Peifu and Wang Chengbin. Engaging in rivalries with the Fengtian and Anhui Cliques, the Zhili Clique would reign supreme in 1922.\n\nDominating the Beiyang Republic for years, the Zhili would experience a climactic fall from power after a war between Qi Xieyuan and Lu Yongxiang would evolve into the Second ZhiFeng War, where Feng Yuxiang, a Zhili member at the time, would betray the clique and launch the 1924 Beijing Coup, ejecting President Cao and Wu Peifu. Whilst briefly regaining their power in an interregnum, it would appear that the Zhili have been ejected from the Central Plains altogether. Without directly intervening on either side in the League Collapse, the Zhili would open themselves to a coup from the detested Royal Court. Resulting in the death of both the primary and secondary leader of the Zhili Clique, it would fall under the tertiary leader, Marshal Wang Chengbin, to wage the fighting retreat to Sichuan province.\n\nNegotiating an agreement with Yang Sen, the Remnant Zhili Clique would see its patronage network severely cut down, with many dying in the Central Plains fighting. Now coalescing around esteemed diplomat Yan Huiqing, the intelligent and quizzical man has proven himself a capable rallying point upon which the civilian bureaucracy can pose a viable alternative to the dominance of Wang's militarists.

 SZC_legitimacy_of_the_republic_desc: "Oh the irony of it all. Having originally been enunciated through the acquiescence of Empress Dowager Longyu, on behalf of Boy Emperor Puyi, the Beiyang Republic was formed in 1912 after the bloody struggle and sacrifices of legions of martyrs for the eradication of the monarchy. Bounding with hope and optimism, the people marched forward under the banners of reformers and revolutionaries alike, experiencing the great equalisation and pluralisation of the new, young and malleable republic. Yet it would all be snuffed out following the machinations of a despot. Having torn itself apart through strongmen and warlords, the Beiyang Republic was nothing but a corrupt, incompetent tool hoisted by whatever warlord clique controlled Beijing at the time. Cabinets lasted months, the Governmental system transitioned seven times in its whole existence, and despite it all there was still a sense of hope.\n\nExpelled from its rightful place in Beijing, the Beiyang establishment and the Zhili Clique have been cowed into exile with amicable allies in Sichuan. However that is perhaps one of many mistakes the Royalists have embarked upon. Under the auspices of Marshal Wang Chengbin, the Zhili have recuperated, and with it the legacy of the Xinhai Revolution lives on within them. And yet the common people, the common masses, and some of our estranged allies, doubt how genuine our sentiments are. Given that the Zhili tossed away the Republic when it was convenient, many believe our nation-state building project to be a sham.

Whilst Marshal Wang is surely not a fool, he is not a God of War either. To succeed, we must re-examine our doctrines, for all facets of warfare."

 SZC_cao_kun_constitution: "The 1923 Cao Kun Constitution"
 SZC_cao_kun_constitution_desc: "A remarkable piece of progressive legislature, the 1923 Cao Kun Constitution perhaps represents the peak of Beiyang idealism and hope in the merits of the Zhili Clique. Ultimately receiving a pluralist support from the majority of the Northern Assemblymen at the time, the Cao Kun constitution marked a significant attempt to formalise proper governance in the Beiyang Republic following a tumultuous era of blatant abuses by Duan Qirui and his Anfu Club. Seeking to establish a structured, organised and centralised government, it places significant executive power within that of the President. However it features remarkable components such as a clear separation of powers and an outline of clear civil rights of the Chinese people. Rather unfortunately, its implementation a decade ago was marred by allegations of corruption and autocracy, having been conducted around the similar timeframe in which Cao's bribery scandal concluded. And yet again, its re-implementation in this new era of chaotic times signals another attempt to rapidly stabilise the political situation. Rife with potential loopholes for executive abuse, one must merely place faith in the institutions at this current time to truly exert the will of the people."

 SZC_providing_bread_and_circuses: "Providing Bread and Circuses"
 SZC_providing_bread_and_circuses_desc: "To truly win the hearts of the people, it would not be prudent to toss meaningless concepts of \"reform\" at them. For the people do not desire reform at this moment. They need food, shelter, water and an enjoyable life. Therefore the age old metonymic phrase applies precisely in our situation. True reform can wait for the resumption of good governance in Beijing."

 SZC_embracing_militarism: "Embracing Militarism"
 SZC_embracing_militarism_desc: "For our own national salvation, it requires the participation of every single citizen's martial spirit in order for an overseeing of the revival of the militaristic nation-state. Under the auspices of General Jiang Baili, the people are undergoing a revival of their own bushido, their own capacity for self-sacrifice for the motives of an ulterior goal. Greater than the individual, we must reclaim the spirit of the nation."

 SZC_legacy_of_the_academies: "Legacy of the Academies"
 SZC_legacy_of_the_academies_desc: "Deprived of Baoding, deprived of Kunming, the militarists are without the very cradles of their cliques. Nonetheless, we must carry on, with or without their expertise. For the majority of our officers and commanders are descendants of the martial spirit invoked in such institutions, and we'd be damned if we forgot our origins now."

 SZC_dawn_of_the_final_offensive: "Dawn of the Final Offensive"
 SZC_dawn_of_the_final_offensive_desc: "It is upon us! The hour of judgement! A true test of our new, reformed capabilities! Now is the time of great struggle, for our enemies lord over our rightful national capital, and if we are to fail, the Zhili Clique as we know it will perish. The Beiyang Republic does not linger on under the auspices of that perfidious Old Marshal, but under the Marshal of Tianjin! Zhonghua Mingguo Wansui!"

 SZC_old_hope_and_glory: "Old Hope and Glory"
 SZC_old_hope_and_glory_desc: "Our men grow tired, their morale plummets, our factories halt, and our workers lament. The absolute dedication of every manageable resource to our total victory has come with an unduly cost. Whilst it will depart with time, the strain, the tears, they lie with our nation, seeping into its ground. One can only hope the sacrifices were worth it."

 SZC_hundred_years_war_of_resistance: "Hundred Years War of Resistance"
 SZC_hundred_years_war_of_resistance_desc: "The invaders dare trespass on our territory! The foreign imperialists, the vile Japanese! They have arrived to finally seize and eradicate our nation in a war of national survival! Every man, women and child must truly dedicate themselves in body and spirit to the preservation of China's millennia old civilisation, for we must prove to the Japanese that we can wage a Hundred Years War of Resistance!"

 SZC_sounding_the_bugles_of_victory: "Sounding the Bugles of Victory"
 SZC_sounding_the_bugles_of_victory_desc: "Finally we have done it! The grand reclamation of the Zhili Clique's rightful position within the Chinese nation-state. No more shall we be forced to co-exist with the perfidious monarchists, no more shall we bow to any foreign power! The Zhili Clique may have been deposed, it may have initially lost its leadership, but it has found a new soul in the likes of Marshal Wang and Yan Huiqing. The bugles of victory sound, and the people rejoice!"

 SZC_extending_a_hand_to_the_young_china: "Extending a Hand to the Young China"
 SZC_extending_a_hand_to_the_young_china_desc: "Despite their convictions and reluctant participation in the Manchu bureaucracy, the Young China Party at its core is that of a nationalist, patriotic and devoutly Republican one. Whilst we were at odds before, many within the Assembly and the soldiery view their ideological tenacity with pride. Whilst hardliners would rather see them excise, cooperating once more with the YCP can see a reinvigoration of Chinese militarism and nationalism."

 SZC_intellectualism_with_endeavour: "Intellectualism with Endeavour"
 SZC_intellectualism_with_endeavour_desc: "The Endeavour Society, a long functioning intellectual organisation and article producer, was founded under the likes of Cai Yuanpei, Hu Shih, Li Dazhao, Liang Shuming, Wang Chonghui, Tao Menghe and many other reformist, later revolutionary in certain cases, intellectuals. Continuously championed by Hu Shih in some form, they represent one of the many Federalist blocs within the North's political scene. Sharing a mutual home during our exile, let us further integrate this think tank further into our government, however they expect much of our government. Most importantly, immediate reform of its institutions."

 SZC_public_safety_bureau: "The Public Safety Bureau"
 SZC_public_safety_bureau_desc: "The Public Safety Bureau, or PSB, is the name of the Intelligence Agency moonlighting as the Zhili's secret police, nominally led by Liu Menggeng and Wang Yujia. Utilising both their contacts within the Central Plains and elsewhere alongside their admirable experience in running Cao Kun's spy and intelligence rings, the entity has been established to ensure that the possibility of a Manchu Coup could never happen again. Espionage, suppression of internal dissent and counter-intelligence are just some of the many objectives the institution has been authorised to deal with."

 SZC_vindicating_the_invisible_element_idea: "Behind Manchu Lines"
 SZC_vindicating_the_invisible_element_idea_desc: "They may have squashed our military might on the surface, but little do the Royalists know that the Zhili networks and influence seeps deep into the earth of the Central Plains. Our beloved King of Baoding may have been mercilessly slaughtered at the hands of the Manchu Princes, but his networks remain forever strong. And willing to leverage us any benefit for the annihilation of our enemy."

 SZC_reconstituting_the_beiyang_navy: "Reconstituting the Beiyang Navy"
 SZC_reconstituting_the_beiyang_navy_desc: "Following through with a rather ambitious plan drawn up by restored Minister of the Navy, Admiral Sa Zhenbing, a significant portion of the country's budget is being prioritised for a state-planned modernisation and production effort of a brand new fleet of ships. It is hoped that by the end of this year plan, the Chinese Navy will have rapidly modernised, and will no longer sail ships of a decade before."

 Sichuan_Famine_decisions: "Famine Relief Efforts"
 Sichuan_Famine_decisions_desc: "The famine that wreaked havoc on Sichuan in 1925 has left a deep scar upon our people. While we've done what we can to prevent another one, the collapse of the League, persistent drought and rampant unrest has turned our worst fears into reality. We must now do everything we can to fight this famine.\n\n§1The famine will end when its §Y$MODIFIER_GLOBAL_MONTHLY_POPULATION$§! modifier reaches §!§Y0%§!

 SZC_International_Famine_Relief: "International Famine Relief"
 SZC_International_Famine_Relief_desc: "China has endured a lot in recent years and there is only so much we can do to help ourselves. In places abroad, that have not been blighted by war or famine, there's more than enough grain to go around. We should appeal for them to help us in our time of need."

 SZC_Service_For_Food: "Service for Food"
 SZC_Service_For_Food_desc: "Every able-bodied man that can serve must do his part to overcome the disaster! As such, we'll offer civilians increased rations in exchange for military service and have these soldiers assist in the distribution of food to the masses."
 SZC_Labour_Relief: "Labour Relief"
 SZC_Labour_Relief_desc: "There isn't enough food to go around, so those that can must work to earn their rations. We'll set up a programme where the unemployed and able-bodied are conscripted as labourers and paid in rations to build the infrastructure and facilities we need to better combat the famine."
 SZC_Allocate_More_Government_Funds: "Allocate More Government Funds"
 SZC_Allocate_More_Government_Funds_desc: "In order to fight the famine, we'll need to step in with more resources from the government. This will, however, come at the expense of other state projects."
 SZC_Increase_Relief_Efforts: "Increase Relief Efforts"
 SZC_Increase_Relief_Efforts_desc: "It's clear that more must be done to distribute the food into the countryside. Local leaders in rural parts of Sichuan will be tasked with setting up programmes to distribute rice to their communities."
 SZC_Food_Banks: "Food Banks"
 SZC_Food_Banks_desc: "The government will work with farmers and Buddhist temples to bring food to the people of Sichuan, better helping us reach every level of society with our efforts to combat this disaster."
 SZC_Subsidise_Food_Production: "Subsidise Food Production"
 SZC_Subsidise_Food_Production_desc: "Sichuan has plenty of farmers, but since most of them don't earn enough to rely on anything but the weather and antiquated methods the spectre of a new famine looms with every drought. By stepping in with money from its own coffers, the state can help farmers combat waste and increase productivity."
 SZC_Enact_Price_Controls: "Enact Price Controls"
 SZC_Enact_Price_Controls_desc: "When the famine broke out many merchants started to hoard grain and rice while charging extortionate fees for these goods. The state, backed by the army if need be, will make sure no one profiteers from the misery of our people by enacting price controls."
 SZC_Child_Protection_Programme: "Child Protection Programme"

 SZC_Fading_Famine: "Fading Famine"

 SZC_famine_relief_desc_LEC: "From Hong Kong to Shanghai, the Legation Cities possess an abundance of wealth and resources. Compared to the rest of China, they're largely left unscathed by the death of Marshal Sun and the subsequent turmoil. Because of this, they're in a position to help - whether their bureaucracy is willing to, however, is another matter altogether."

 Sichuan_Opium_Monopoly_decisions: "Sales Monopoly Bureau"
 Sichuan_Opium_Monopoly_decisions_desc: "The opium situation is beyond our control at this point and we're in no position to completely rid ourselves from it. Instead of eradicating the industry entirely, we'll bring it under the control of the state and put the profits from this vice into our coffers.\n\nCurrent Opium Control: £opium_texticon  [?SZC_opium_control|+%1]"
 SZC_Bureaucratic_Reforms: "Bureaucratic Reforms"
 SZC_Bureaucratic_Reforms_desc: "We need to take measures to mould the state bureaucracy into functioning less like a conventional one and more like a business as far as opium is concerned. By making gradual changes to this effect, we'll streamline our control over the market."
 SZC_Buy_Out_Merchants: "Buy Out Merchants"
 SZC_Buy_Out_Merchants_desc: "Sometimes the best way to deal with the competition is to simply buy it out. While a costly investment for the state to make, in due time these costs to our state coffers should be paid back through the profits we'll make."
 SZC_Forced_Acquisitions: "Forced Acquisitions"
 SZC_Forced_Acquisitions_desc: "By adopting a very literal interpretation of the law, we can send in the police to forcibly shut down a few private markets and use their goods and property to expand our monopoly."
 SZC_Tax_Harvesting_Scheme: "Tax Harvesting Scheme"
 SZC_Tax_Harvesting_Scheme_desc: "In order to increase revenues to fund our government plans, we can devote extra resources to local administrators and help their efforts to collect the taxes - old, current and new - owed to us and squeeze out every penny from those that thought they were above the law. It'll be unpopular, but it's for the good of Sichuan."
 SZC_Transit_Tariffs: "Transit Tariffs"
 SZC_Transit_Tariffs_desc: "We'll have the military and police establish checkpoints throughout the key roads and transit points around Sichuan to tax the transportation of opium. While a hassle for the commoner, it'll fill our coffers and prevent the competition from moving their goods."
 SZC_Farmer_Licensing: "Farmer Licensing"
 SZC_Farmer_Licensing_desc: "Every farm engaging in opium production will need a licence to operate from here on. Failure to comply will, of course, force us to confiscate their property."
 SZC_Uncontested_Monopoly: "Uncontested Monopoly"
 SZC_Uncontested_Monopoly_desc: "There is no more opium market in Sichuan, only a state monopoly that the criminals and smugglers can't touch. If they aren't directly under our control, they're de facto so through our regulations and taxes. While some may say that we're no better than the criminals we ousted, we've brought security and a steady stream of money to the state."
 SZC_Combat_Corruption: "Combat Corruption"
 SZC_Combat_Corruption_desc: "Our efforts to maintain market control are hampered by some of our officials taking bribes in order to turn a blind eye to the non-sanctioned opium businesses. By removing them, there'll be fewer cracks for the non-state actors to slip through."
 SZC_Combat_Smuggling: "Combat Smuggling"
 SZC_Combat_Smuggling_desc: "By diverting our army to patrol the roads and rivers of the country we'll be able to greatly hinder the smugglers cutting into the state's monopoly. Gradually, this will drive them out of business."

 Sichuan_Opium_Removal_decisions: "Opium Prohibition Committee"
 Sichuan_Opium_Removal_decisions_desc: "Since the Treaty of Tianjin was imposed upon us, the opium trade has ravaged China and brought despair to millions of Chinese. Our guilt in this is significant - Sichuan is the rotten core of this destructive industry. The challenge facing the Opium Prohibition Committee is immense, but we owe it to our people to free them from the clutches of opium.\n\nCurrent Opium Spread: £opium_texticon  [?SZC_opium_spread|+%1]"
 SZC_Promote_Crop_Production: "Promote Crop Production"
 SZC_Promote_Crop_Production_desc: "One of the reasons for the prevalence of opium crops is their profitability. By subsidising and otherwise promoting the growth of regular crops we should start seeing more of our farmers move away from growing opium."
 SZC_Poppy_Burning_Campaign: "Poppy Burning Campaign"

 SZC_Prohibitionist_Victory: "Prohibitionist Victory"
 SZC_Prohibitionist_Victory_desc: "Through the dedication of the OPC, the scourge of addiction that has plagued Sichuan for so long is finally contained and those profiteering from it are behind bars or chased out of our provinces. This is truly a victory worth celebrating!"
 SZC_Anti_Corruption_Campaigns: "Anti-Corruption Campaigns"
 SZC_Anti_Corruption_Campaigns_desc: "Our efforts in containing the spread of opium are greatly hindered by corrupt officials and civil servants that take bribes, embezzle funds and ignore the law when convenient.

 SZC_Purge_The_Administration_desc: "Drastic times call for drastic measures and we presently have too many weasels in our midst that profiteer from our people's hardships.

 Sichuan_Diarchy_decisions: "The Diarchy"
 Sichuan_Diarchy_decisions_desc: "Unlike many warlord cliques in China, Baoding is noted for being more prone to cooperation than competition. If the balance is maintained it'll bring powerful benefits to Sichuan. Both sides need to give and take for the cooperation to work, for if one side becomes too dominant the diarchy may start to resemble the autocracies that surround it."
 SZC_Favour_The_Militarists: "Favour the Militarists"
 SZC_Favour_The_Militarists_desc: "By supporting the more conservative military wing through funding and favours, our army will reap the benefits while giving their faction a boost in the public eye. If the army is neglected, it'll degrade their performance in the field. Letting them grow too strong, however, risks crippling Sichuan's civilian branches of government. While it's certainly tempting to favour the army in times of war in particular, we should be careful not to provoke a hostile response by letting our administrative duties crumble."
 SZC_Favour_The_Bureaucrats: "Favour the Bureaucrats"
 SZC_Favour_The_Bureaucrats_desc: "By providing more resources and public support for the civilian branches of government, we'll see an well-oiled bureaucracy, more able to tackle the challenges that the province faces. Should we favour them too heavily, however, our army will suffer the results of spending cuts and perform worse in the field. If this goes on for too long, we can't rule out the army taking measures into their own hands to adjust this imbalance."

However brutally beaten, losing many good men along the way, the Remnant Zhili Forces join our native Sichuan armies as a spent force. On the bright side, all is not lost. With veterans from the ZhiFeng Wars, and intense experience fighting the Manchu armies in their withdrawal, the men are skilled, hardy and all too capable. We should seek to integrate and reform the Zhili forces, so that we can strike back on the war path against the Royalists, anyone else who dares stand in our way of national unification."

Once the Central Army, the Zhili are now reduced to a paltry force, outer Zhili members such as Tang Xiangming, or the League non-withstanding. Perhaps a costly endeavour, the §PMarshal§! has constructed a plan in-which the forces will be demobilised, reorganised and reconstituted into a group of elite \"Xinguojun\" divisions (New National Army). Despite the cost, it would provide a group of uniquely skilled and uniquely motivated soldiers for the army."

 Sichuan_Arms_Purchases_decisions: "Foreign Arms Deals"
 Sichuan_Arms_Purchases_decisions_desc: "Devout in our crusade against the Manchu and their royalists, this does not necessarily mean we are opposed to the practices and convictions of the imperialists. Not quite yet. After all, one thing at a time, no? Whilst our noble armament arsenals such as Chongqing and Daxian work around the clock to produce the artillery, the shells, the bullets and the rifles necessary to sustain our armies, another avenue for armaments has defined itself. Far reduced from our stature as the Central Government, internationally recognised, that does not matter in the scale of the arms trade. Looking towards a wider expanse of benefactors in the international arms area, we can arm ourselves for the great reconquest!"
 SZC_Purchase_Foreign_Guns: "Purchase Foreign Guns"
 SZC_Purchase_Foreign_Guns_desc: "With the increasing military modernisation around the globe, clearly in preparation for some broader national conflict on the horizon, international rifles are being rapidly modernised similarly. Resulting in an influx of outdated designs gathering dust in global stockpiles, our logistics staff have drafted a series of contracts in which we would purchase an assortment of excess armaments."
 SZC_Purchase_Support_Equipment: "Purchase Foreign Support Equipment"
 SZC_Purchase_Support_Equipment_desc: "A surprising hotbed of armament manufacturing and design, the Danish Madsen Machine Gun has proven itself an undeniably reliable, effective and wonderful support light machine gun for not just our soldiers, but that of armies in the here and now. The world's first true light machine gun produced in quantity, the military command staff has taken a particular liking to the Dane's support weaponry."
 SZC_Purchase_Artillery: "Purchase Foreign Artillery"
 SZC_Purchase_Artillery_desc: "A curious choice amongst our other potential military armament benefactors, the Swiss military industrial complex has nonetheless remained an admirable, if modest, national industry. With their neutrality ever present however, their equipment usually ends up for sale on the international weapons market. All too familiar with the fact that artillery is king in Chinese warfare, the Army would be all too delighted to receive modern guns, in significant quantity for once."

 SZC_Hire_RCW_Veterans: "Hire Russian Civil War Veterans"
 SZC_Hire_RCW_Veterans_desc: "With our relationship with Germany tenuous at best, and other imperialists distant due to our lack of legitimacy, many believe that our grand ambitions for a reconquest are bereft of assistance in military development. Yet there remains one Western, modern nation that has yet to openly oppose us as of recent. Russia.\n\nGranted, many despise the Russian Bear due to their previous colonial expansionist policies, such as the seizure of Outer Manchuria, or the further invasion of Dongbei in the wake of the Boxer Rebellion. Nonetheless, their disparaged, ambitious and older officers prove themselves incredibly fitting to substitute what the German advisors could provide. Clearly skilled in nearly all facets required of them."

 SZC_Industrial_Planning_Committee: "Industrial Planning Committee"
 SZC_Industrial_Planning_Committee_desc: "Before we launch any major industrialisation programmes we need to set up a committee to assess our available resources after the civil war and plan the best approach for our future expansions. While it'll considerably expand the bureaucratic apparatus, the increased efficiency will pay dividends in the end."

 SZC_Import_Foreign_Machinery: "Import Foreign Machinery"
 SZC_Import_Foreign_Machinery_desc: "With both our industrial hubs of Chongqing and Chengdu badly battered by the war, we'll need to import equipment from abroad in order to get our industry back on its feet again. The planning committee has already laid out a budget for this and they only await our approval."

 SZC_Modern_Construction_Technology: "Modern Construction Technology"
 SZC_Modern_Construction_Technology_desc: "The Industrial Planning Committee has reached the conclusion that there's no way around the fact that our construction methods, tools and even basic know-how are all outdated.

 SZC_Study_Production_Innovations: "Study Production Innovations"
 SZC_Study_Production_Innovations_desc: "It's one thing to have access to advanced machinery, but if we are to be able to match the production methods of the Europeans and Japanese with our own, we need to study their respective approaches and apply what we learn to our own manufacturing techniques. As always, the IPC has budgeted for the associated costs."

 SZC_Urban_Modernisation_and_Sanitation: "Urban Modernisation and Sanitation"
 SZC_Urban_Modernisation_and_Sanitation_desc: "With our industry's rapid growth and the early successes of our urbanisation programme, the next step is to bring the great cities of Sichuan into the twentieth century by modernising their infrastructure to modern standards.

 SZC_Increase_Steel_Production: "Increase Steel Production"
 SZC_Increase_Steel_Production_desc: "Many of Sichuan's steel mills and ore mines use techniques and tools from the last century and sometimes these methods even more backwards and outdated to the point where they endanger our labourers. Bringing these methods into the current century will turn Chongqing into the beating heart of Chinese steel production."

 SZC_Rebuild_Chengdu_Machine_Bureau: "Rebuild the Chengdu Machine Bureau"
 SZC_Rebuild_Chengdu_Machine_Bureau_desc: "Underutilised before the war and damaged during it, the Chengdu Machine Bureau has great potential thanks to previous investments into its infrastructure. We'll rebuild it and make it a cornerstone of Chengdu's industrialisation process."

 SZC_Huaxi_Machinery_Factory: "Huaxi Machinery Factory"
 SZC_Huaxi_Machinery_Factory_desc: "With the rapid industrialisation efforts that we have planned, the ways of old are ceding ground as we utilise more and more machine tools and vehicles. In order to keep up with demand, our planners have proposed establishing industries in the Huaxi district, turning it into a model for industrialisation."

 SZC_Textile_Production: "Textile Production"
 SZC_Textile_Production_desc: "Chinese textiles are known far and wide for their quality and unique style. Sichuan has always had a large role in this trade and with both the increased demand for these goods and the relative safety of the basin these days, it'd be a good investment to deepen our role in this trade."

 SZC_Xikang_Hydropower: "Xikang Hydropower"
 SZC_Xikang_Hydropower_desc: "For the time being, most of Sichuan's energy needs comes from the use of coal power and natural gas. Our engineers tell us, however, that there's vast amounts of untapped energy in the mountainous west, offering numerous opportunities for the construction of hydro electric dams. This should allow our energy needs to keep pace with our growing industrialisation."

 SZC_Electrification_Efforts: "Electrification Efforts"
 SZC_Electrification_Efforts_desc: "Leave the confines of Chengdu and Chongqing and much of Sichuan is lit by candles and oil at night.

Electricity will keep the countryside bright at night, our people warm in the winter and make our factories even more productive."

 SZC_Build_the_Electro_Steel_Mill: "Build the Electro-Steel Mill"
 SZC_Build_the_Electro_Steel_Mill_desc: "A big part of the plan to industrialise Sichuan was to construct an Electro-Steel Mill in Chongqing. But due to the many conflicts of the past, the mill was destroyed. Now that we have the power and industrial capabilities to do so, we can materialise this powerhouse of a mill again!"

 SZC_Modernised_Manufacturing: "Modernised Manufacturing"
 SZC_Modernised_Manufacturing_desc: "Our efforts that began with the reconstruction after the civil war have blossomed and helped turn Sichuan's basin into a small, if growing, industrial heartland.

 SZC_The_Arsenal_Programme: "The Arsenal Programme"
 SZC_The_Arsenal_Programme_desc: "Chongqing has long boasted some capable military industry, with the Chongqing Arsenal being the biggest among them. The Industrial Planning Committee has proposed an expansion of the arsenal using the techniques and equipment they've acquired, allowing us to maintain our military production edge in the region."

 SZC_Expand_Production_Artillery: "Expand Production: Artillery"
 SZC_Expand_Production_Artillery_desc: "Sichuan is home to some of the most effective small arms production in China, but there's still room for improvement when it comes to heavier ordnance. Just like the Chongqing arsenal is known across China for its effective rifles, the Heijang Artillery Arsenal will bring modern artillery production methods to Sichuan."

 SZC_Expand_Production_Tanks: "Expand Production: Tanks"
 SZC_Expand_Production_Tanks_desc: "Tanks have proven their worth in the Weltkrieg and subsequent conflicts thanks to their ability to break through enemy defences. With our growing industrial base, we're finally in a position to start small-scale production of tanks that will help us dominate the Asian battlefields."

 SZC_Expand_Production_Aircraft: "Expand Production: Aircraft"
 SZC_Expand_Production_Aircraft_desc: "Often neglected by Chinese military planners, aircraft are becoming an indispensable part of any modern military. Because of Sichuan's mountainous geography, catching up here could be vital for future conflicts where planes will provide eyes in the sky for our troops and artillery and rain death from above upon our enemies."

 SZC_Promote_Mount_Emei: "Promote Mount Emei"
 SZC_Promote_Mount_Emei_desc: "The high and lofty mountain of Emei is one of China's great, sacred mountains of Buddhism along with Wutai, Jiuhuam and Putuo.

 SZC_Rebuild_The_Sichuanese_Army: "Rebuild the Sichuanese Army"
 SZC_Rebuild_The_Sichuanese_Army_desc: "The current state of Sichuan's army leaves a lot to be desired. It's an outdated and splintered body lacking in cohesion. Our first step will be to bring the army together from its fractured background so that our soldiers can fight more effectively for their homeland."

 SZC_Rebuild_The_Officer_Corps: "Rebuild the Officer Corps"
 SZC_Rebuild_The_Officer_Corps_desc: "Fractured between many different factions, it's an unfortunate fact that our army's leadership is splintered and lacks a unified sense of strategy. By establishing our own Sichuanese military academy we can start instilling a proper understanding of modern warfare into our commanders."

 SZC_New_Infantry_Weapons: "New Infantry Weapons"
 SZC_New_Infantry_Weapons_desc: "Even by the standards of the rest of China, our army lags behind in many areas. It's time we started to combat this by taking steps to modernise our infantry divisions and give our soldiers the equipment they need to defend Sichuan."

 SZC_Import_Modern_Artillery: "Import Modern Artillery"
 SZC_Import_Modern_Artillery_desc: "As it stands, many of our artillery detachment use the same guns that they fielded in the conflicts of the past decades. This won't stand. Importing foreign artillery pieces and know-how would help us a great deal in mitigating this issue."

 SZC_Recon_Unit_Training: "Recon Unit Training"
 SZC_Recon_Unit_Training_desc: "Most of Sichuan's terrain is harsh with high mountains and mighty rivers covering most of our lands. Knowledge of the terrain can mean the difference between life and death. Let's make sure we're on the favourable side in that equation."

 SZC_Mountain_Warfare: "Mountain Warfare"
 SZC_Mountain_Warfare_desc: "What our army may lack in modern equipment can easily be made up for by using terrain to our advantage. With most of Sichuan and her neighbours being covered in rugged mountains, a company trained to fight among them can often be worth more than a division of regular soldiers."

 SZC_Adopt_The_Southern_Doctrine: "Adopt the Southern Doctrine"
 SZC_Adopt_The_Southern_Doctrine_desc: "We should not blindly modernise for the sake of modernisation. Our resources make it more prudent to adopt the Southern Doctrine instead and focus on what the Europeans call unconventional tactics but fit the Chinese hand like a glove. Whether it's large-front assaults or guerrilla warfare, we'll master at it."

 SZC_War_Logistics: "War Logistics"
 SZC_War_Logistics_desc: "Fielding a larger army means that we have a bigger supply chain to maintain. By creating a specialised department of logistics and assigning some of our more qualified officers to oversee it, we'll ensure that our troops stay supplied while minimising corruption and waste along the way."

 SZC_Asymmetric_Warfare: "Asymmetric Warfare"
 SZC_Asymmetric_Warfare_desc: "At the present it's unrealistic for us to try and match countries like Japan in terms of massed tanks, air power and artillery. Instead we should negate their advantages using our own cunning and encouraging our officers to rely of tactics that let their agile forces choose the terms of the battle, not the rigidly structured foe they face."

 SZC_Heavy_Fire_Tactics: "Heavy Fire Tactics"
 SZC_Heavy_Fire_Tactics_desc: "By training our officers and soldiers to detect weak points in the enemy's lines and quickly exploit them with overwhelming force, we can achieve breakthroughs more easily."

 SZC_Increase_Munitions_Production: "Increase Munitions Production"
 SZC_Increase_Munitions_Production_desc: "Our production of munitions need to keep pace with our increased use of heavy guns in the field.

 SZC_Continue_The_Northern_Doctrine: "Continue the Northern Doctrine"
 SZC_Continue_The_Northern_Doctrine_desc: "What we lack in modern equipment we shall make up for by being adaptable, quick and resourceful.

 SZC_Focus_On_Speed: "Focus on Speed"
 SZC_Focus_On_Speed_desc: "We'll train our troops in path-finding and invest in equipment like improved boots and tyres to fine-tune our army's performance. By doing this, we're sure to dictate the terms of battle and where it's fought!"

 SZC_Improved_Army_Training: "Improved Army Training"
 SZC_Improved_Army_Training_desc: "An army of untrained soldiers is hardly more effective than a mob of bandits. Although our efforts to improve the training of both our soldiers and officers have been substantial, there's still room for more refinement. We don't just want a good army - we should aim to have the most professional one in all of China."

 SZC_Anti_Tank_Preparations: "Anti-Tank Preparations"
 SZC_Anti_Tank_Preparations_desc: "Tall mountains, deep valleys and wide rivers. Nearly every inch of our land is a potential death trap for enemy tank crews and we'll make sure that our soldiers make the most of this fact."

 SZC_Study_Tank_Designs: "Study Tank Designs"
 SZC_Study_Tank_Designs_desc: "The tank has proven to be a key component in the modern battlefield. We cannot afford to lag behind in this development and must study the tank designs of Germany, France and Japan to develop our own armoured companies."

 SZC_Irregular_Tactics: "Irregular Tactics"
 SZC_Irregular_Tactics_desc: "The mountains, forests and cities have long been the only reliable allies for our armed forces. Our expertise in using asymmetrical warfare has served us well in the past and it will keep doing so in the future as well."

 SZC_Decentralised_Chain_Of_Command: "Decentralised Chain of Command"
 SZC_Decentralised_Chain_Of_Command_desc: "It's essential that our soldiers and officers act on their own initiative. While our enemy lays idle while waiting for instructions from the head of the army, our brave men will use their own heads instead!"

 SZC_Night_Warfare: "Night Warfare"
 SZC_Night_Warfare_desc: "The darkness of night may blind conventional armies, but we've learned how to use it as an asset. Even an open field can be turned into an ambush spot and provide cover from enemy detection and fire. We'd be fools not to make the most of it."

 SZC_Army_Of_Shadows: "Army of Shadows"
 SZC_Army_Of_Shadows_desc: "We'll defeat our foes not by sacrificing our soldiers in head-on assaults, but with a thousand cuts from the shadows. Behind their lines, in their cities and even from within their ranks - there nowhere will our enemies find safety. Deception and cunning will win the day, not the foolhardy sacrifices of soldiers so many careless warlords commit."

 SZC_Professional_Legacy: "Professional Legacy"
 SZC_Professional_Legacy_desc: "Most of our commanders trace our military roots back to the esteemed Baoding Military Academy and many more are influenced by its teachings. We must build upon this legacy and turn Sichuan's army into a professional and disciplined military force worthy of respect."

 SZC_Military_Education_Corps: "Military Education Corps"
 SZC_Military_Education_Corps_desc: "Far too often military teachings put emphasis on the officers, with little regard for the education of the soldiers. With the right education, not only will our soldiers know how to drill and march, but they'll also have a keen eye for doctrine and its applications on a tactical level as well."

 SZC_Well_Trained_Officers: "Well-Trained Officers"
 SZC_Well_Trained_Officers_desc: "Many of China's modern heroes learned how to fight in the Baoding Military Academy. Carrying this legacy forward, we must make sure to do our utmost to ensure that as many of China's future heroes are trained in our academies. In producing excellent officers, even the Europeans will have to learn to respect us."

 SZC_Army_Of_Professionals: "Army of Professionals"
 SZC_Army_Of_Professionals_desc: "Much of China's suffering has come from warlords and corrupt officials pretending that an unruly mob can act as an army - let alone take a city without behaving like bandits in the process. We shall instead create an army of well-trained soldiers and officers, one that will fight for China with discipline and honour in equal measure."

 SZC_Doctrinal_Innovation: "Doctrinal Innovation"
 SZC_Doctrinal_Innovation_desc: "An army is only as good as its doctrine. If we don't adapt to the modern battlefield and its conditions, we'll be left in the dustbin of history. It's high time that we refine our tactics and strategies."

 SZC_Equipment_Standardisation: "Equipment Standardisation"
 SZC_Equipment_Standardisation_desc: "During the days of the warlords, any logistics officer would often have the unenviable burden of every local war band, governor militia and splinter force having their own rifles, ammunition and uniforms. More steps need to be taken to streamline our equipment, from the smallest manufacturing floors, all the way into the battlefield."

 SZC_Engineer_Units: "Engineer Units"
 SZC_Engineer_Units_desc: "Our home of Sichuan is a harsh landscape to fight in with its tall mountains and wide rivers. As such, specialised detachments of engineers ought to be used as much as possible to allow our forces to build the best defences and surmount the mightiest of fortifications."

 SZC_Improved_Army_Drills: "Improved Army Drills"
 SZC_Improved_Army_Drills_desc: "It is true that while our soldiers are disciplined and brave, our training methods sometimes leave something to be desired as our training methods haven't always kept pace with other developments. We need to refine our methods and make sure our soldiers perform to the utmost of their ability."

 SZC_Creative_Solutions: "Creative Solutions"
 SZC_Creative_Solutions_desc: "Sichuan and indeed most surrounding provinces are inhospitable for any army and difficult to traverse. A clever and cost-effective solution to the restrictions on mobility could be the widespread implementation of bicycle infantry, proven by the previous war in Europe to be effective even in some of the most demanding war zones."

 SZC_Armament_Department_Holds_On: "The Armament Department Holds On"
 SZC_Armament_Department_Holds_On_desc: "Neither treacherous deceit nor backstabbing opportunism could stand up to the strength and courage of the Armament Department. Yang Sen holds on to power despite the odds and now the Armament Department will deal with these rebels once and for all."

 SZC_Evict_Officer_Department: "Evict the Officer Department"
 SZC_Evict_Officer_Department_desc: "Yunnan's Federalist and KMT lapdogs have been a thorn in our side for far too long, having waged a guerrilla campaign against us since the 1920s. With the civil war won and our enemies on the run, it's time we chase them out of Sichuan once and for all."

 SZC_Restore_Order_In_Chongqing: "Restore Order in Chongqing"
 SZC_Restore_Order_In_Chongqing_desc: "Chongqing is the industrial heartland of Sichuan. Even though Liu Xiang is gone, the city itself was badly scarred in the civil war and remains in a state of turmoil. We need to use the army re-establish government control over the city and bring stability to its inhabitants."

 SZC_Bring_Peace_to_Sichuan: "Bring Peace to Sichuan"
 SZC_Bring_Peace_to_Sichuan_desc: "With the other factions gone and order restored to most of the country, all that's left is to clear out the last holdouts and restore government control to the last few villages in the country affected by turmoil and banditry. It won't be long before the worst scars of the war are finally mended."

 SZC_Yang_Sens_Ambition: "Yang Sen's Ambition"
 SZC_Yang_Sens_Ambition_desc: "Yang Sen has ruled over Sichuan with a firm hand since the Qing restoration, but the internal strife never allowed him to fulfil his vision for Sichuan. With all enemies from both within and without dealt with, he can finally realise his ambition for a modern and prosperous Sichuan."

 SZC_Centralise_The_Province: "Centralise the Province"
 SZC_Centralise_The_Province_desc: "Chengdu may be the seat of the government, but the reach of our administration's reach doesn't reach all of Sichuan. By reforming our administration so that the local mayors answer to the governor in Chengdu rather than their own agenda, we'll make the Department's control over the province more effective."

 SZC_Armed_And_Ready: "Armed and Ready"
 SZC_Armed_And_Ready_desc: "Even though peace has been brought back to Sichuan, it's likely only a matter of time until we have to go to war again. Let's expand our arms production so that we're prepared for when that day arrives."

 SZC_Modernising_Sichuan: "Modernising Sichuan"
 SZC_Modernising_Sichuan_desc: "Sichuan is currently nowhere near its full potential thanks to the wastefulness, bickering and inaction caused by our rivals. We need to take the first bold steps towards bringing all of Sichuan into the modern era, starting with our cities."

 SZC_A_Break_With_Tradition: "A Break With Tradition"
 SZC_A_Break_With_Tradition_desc: "The ways of old shouldn't be venerated to a fault. It isn't just the cities and infrastructure that need to be brought into the modern era, but the way we think and act as well. This should be reflected in how our administrators and researchers work as well, of course."

 SZC_Parks_And_Venues: "Parks and Venues"
 SZC_Parks_And_Venues_desc: "The beauty of Sichuan's forests and basins are foreign to many of those living in our biggest cities. Given our goal of urbanisation, it's only fair to bring that beauty into the cities as well."

 SZC_Popular_Education_Institute: "Popular Education Institute"
 SZC_Popular_Education_Institute_desc: "No longer constrained by old ways and outdated methods, we need to establish modern research facilities so that we can reap the rewards of our hard work. Soon, Sichuan will be known far and wide as a centre of thought and research in Asia."

 SZC_City_Administration: "City Administration"
 SZC_City_Administration_desc: "The next step in our modernisation plan is an overhauling of the administrations in the major cities and their bureaucracies. They're currently outdated, decentralised and full of cracks. By creating a more effective administrative framework, we're certain to see a rise in productivity."

 SZC_Road_Construction: "Road Construction"
 SZC_Road_Construction_desc: "The roads that connect our cities often wouldn't look out of place in the Qin dynasty, assuming any exist at all. Step by step, we'll replace them with paved ways that we can quickly transport cargo, goods and soldiers across."

 SZC_Farmers_Markets: "Farmers' Markets"
 SZC_Farmers_Markets_desc: "Part of modernising the country is to bring the farmer's goods into the cities by giving economic incentives for the creation of more farmers' markets, centralising the commerce around the agricultural sector. It'll enrich both us and our farmers and make lives easier in the cities as well."

 SZC_The_Luzhou_Woodworks: "The Luzhou Woodworks"
 SZC_The_Luzhou_Woodworks_desc: "With its location along the Yangtze, Luzhou is an excellent location to establish a new industrial zone for lumber, both for our own use and to trade along the river."

 SZC_A_Man_Of_The_People: "A Man of the People"
 SZC_A_Man_Of_The_People_desc: "Yang Sen's rule has been firm, but fair. For over a decade he's guided Sichuan's people through hardship and into prosperity. Not just a common warlord like the others, he's truly a man of the people and a father figure to the modern Sichuanese province he's helped build."

 SZC_Liu_Cunhous_Tradition: "Liu Cunhou's Tradition"
 SZC_Liu_Cunhous_Tradition_desc: "Given their vastly conflicting visions for the future of Sichuan, Yang Sen and Liu Cunhou's partnership wasn't meant to last. Now with Liu Cunhou in charge of the Armament Department, Sichuan will finally know peace and order without and dangerous radicalism burdening us."

 SZC_Build_Up_The_Province: "Build Up the Province"
 SZC_Build_Up_The_Province_desc: "The wars and strife have scarred our province. Before any further steps are taken, we need to take actions to mend Sichuan with our strength and tools so that we'll once more have a foundation in place for a strong nation and people."

 SZC_Rally_The_Warlords: "Rally the Warlords"
 SZC_Rally_The_Warlords_desc: "Many strongmen across Sichuan hold control over militias and play an important role in the country. Rather than struggling for power, we should rally them to Liu Cunhou and create a united front within Sichuan with a degree of autonomy for them all in return."

 SZC_The_Daxian_Mint: "The Daxian Mint"
 SZC_The_Daxian_Mint_desc: "Up until now, the practice of local warlords and mayors making their own money has led to confusion at best and fraudulent waste at worst. We should turn this practice into a tightly controlled state monopoly instead."

 SZC_Heavenly_Announcements: "'Heavenly Announcements'"
 SZC_Heavenly_Announcements_desc: "With Sichuan firmly under our control, we need to build up our coffers before we do anything else. 'Heavenly announcements' will be declared by Cunhou and the people will need to pay them. Some may call it greedy, but would they really do so when our decrees are backed by our loyal army?"

 SZC_Confucian_Dominance: "Confucian Dominance"
 SZC_Confucian_Dominance_desc: "It's an unfortunate fact that the role of faith has had a diminished role because of more pressing earthly matters. Now that we finally know peace again, we'll promote our religious traditions as the rallying point for our people, to give them hope in harsh times and bring stability to our nation."

 SZC_Four_Virtues_Movement: "Four Virtues Movement"
 SZC_Four_Virtues_Movement_desc: "We should actively encourage people to participate the State's neo-Confucian movements. By actively participating in these religious organisations, the people will get a better understanding of the cornerstones of Confucian thought. It'll help connect the people to their religion, and tie the state to this religion."

 SZC_A_Nationalist_Haven: "A Nationalist Haven"
 SZC_A_Nationalist_Haven_desc: "For us to endure in these troubled times we must become a stronghold of nationalism. While radicals such as the Kuomintang would seek to uproot the very essence of our nation we'll embrace it. A love for China being the shield that protects us from harm, and the sword that strikes down our enemies."

 SZC_Confucian_Schooling: "Confucian Schooling"
 SZC_Confucian_Schooling_desc: "If an education system is to exist in Sichuan, it should promote religious and traditionalist values first and foremost. Some of the money gained through the Heavenly Announcements should therefore go to fund the construction of more schools to combat the scourges of illiteracy and irreligiosity that still haunt Sichuan."

 SZC_A_Victory_From_Baoding: "A Victory from Baoding"
 SZC_A_Victory_From_Baoding_desc: "Once more, the professionalism and dedication of the Baoding Department has won the day. With their rule over the province secured, Sichuan can now forge its own destiny."

 SZC_The_Diarchy: "The Diarchy"
 SZC_The_Diarchy_desc: "Unlike other cliques guided by the lofty ambitions of one autocrat, the cooperation between two factions has kept them from being dominated by one internal clique. Though the balance of power may shift back and forth between them, this cooperation will continue as the diarchy's reforms start to shape Sichuan."

 SZC_Repair_The_Wars_Damage: "Repair the War's Damage"
 SZC_Repair_The_Wars_Damage_desc: "Much of Sichuan lies in ruins following the war. From the cities and out to the countryside, most of the east and south was consumed by the fighting. Restoring our infrastructure and cities ought to be a top priority for our new administration."

 SZC_Distribute_Grain: "Distribute Grain"
 SZC_Distribute_Grain_desc: "Although the war and drought hit our province hard, there's still surplus grain in a handful of depots held by the military. Since the fighting is over, we should have our soldiers help distribute it throughout the countryside."

 SZC_Build_Up_Support: "Build Up Support"
 SZC_Build_Up_Support_desc: "Not only did our department rise to power through conflict and the collapse two other cliques, but our ideas don't have a universal appeal with the public either. If we don't make an effort to win people's hearts, we may become the third Sichuanese regime to collapse."

 SZC_Fight_Corruption: "Fight Corruption"
 SZC_Fight_Corruption_desc: "Other cliques throughout China are rightfully despised for being corrupt and self-serving. We should prove that we're different by actively rooting out corruption and prove to the people that we have the best interests of the province in mind."

 SZC_A_Model_Province: "A Model Province"
 SZC_A_Model_Province_desc: "Representing a more traditionalist side of the diarchy, the lifelong career officer Deng Xihou seeks to turn Sichuan into a model for all of China through balanced social and economic reforms. Popular with the rural population and the military, his reforms will see the latter gain prominence, leading to a more disciplined army."

 SZC_Moral_Invigoration: "Moral Invigoration"
 SZC_Moral_Invigoration_desc: "Corruption, war, famine and countless other struggles have had their toll on our people. A good place to start the healing process and overcome these years of hardship is with a campaign to restore the virtues of morality into our people. With a strong spirit, the effort to rebuild Sichuan will be swifter."

 SZC_Culture_Of_Productivity: "Culture of Productivity"
 SZC_Culture_Of_Productivity_desc: "A strong work ethic can be more powerful than any tool. Our people should be encouraged to feel a strong sense of pride in their labour and joy in being able to contribute to their communities and their prosperity."

 SZC_Combat_Vice: "Combat Vice"
 SZC_Combat_Vice_desc: "The scourges of addiction, gambling and other immoralities harm our people and lead them to fruitless lives of criminality rather than ones of virtue and fulfilment. More efforts should be made to help combat vice and help those consumed by it to return to a normal, healthy living."

 SZC_Civic_Nationalism: "Civic Nationalism"
 SZC_Civic_Nationalism_desc: "Every citizen of Sichuan should feel a sense of pride in their province. Rather than encouraging envy and anger and we'll channel this pride towards further improving the lives of the Sichuanese."

 SZC_Support_Rural_Reconstruction: "Support Rural Reconstruction"
 SZC_Support_Rural_Reconstruction_desc: "During peacetime, the countryside has been neglected in favour of the great cities of Chengdu and Chongqing. During the war, it was hit hard by advancing armies. Our rural citizens deserve to finally be given the care they deserve."

 SZC_Farmer_Credit: "Farmer Credit"
 SZC_Farmer_Credit_desc: "As part of our programme to ease the burden on our rural regions, we'll issue state subsidies to help our struggling farmers recover in the wake of their recent hardships. Keeping the countryside prosperous and stable will pay dividends for all of Sichuan."

 SZC_Model_Farm_Program: "Model Farm Programme"
 SZC_Model_Farm_Program_desc: "With our agricultural sector restored, the time has come to build upon it. A model farm programme for the model province, one to make our farmers the most productive and prosperous in all of China. The programme will encompass funding towards modern irrigation and mechanised equipment and is sure to lead to a farming boom."

 SZC_Rural_Road_Plan: "Rural Roads Plan"
 SZC_Rural_Road_Plan_desc: "Beyond the few transit hubs connecting the major cities, a significant portion of our roads are the same trails that we've walked for generations. By linking up our smaller townships with proper roads we'll ease the lives of our rural population and provide a boost to their local economies."

 SZC_Build_Hospitals: "Build Hospitals"
 SZC_Build_Hospitals_desc: "The state of our health services leave much to be desired due to historical neglect for generations. The people of Sichuan deserve better than this. We'll set aside more funds for the construction of major hospitals, local clinics, as well as the training of doctors."

 SZC_Peoples_Welfare: "People's Welfare"
 SZC_Peoples_Welfare_desc: "Helping out your fellow man down on his luck is not a matter of left or right, nor a question of reformism or traditionalism. The state of Sichuan will help its poor like institutions from states to monasteries have for millennia in China. It's nothing less than our diligent and moral people deserve."

 SZC_Education_Reform: "Education Reform"
 SZC_Education_Reform_desc: "The model province needs a model educational system. With some effort, Sichuan will soon be known for having one of Asia's finer schooling systems, well up to modern standards."

 SZC_The_University_Of_Chengdu: "The University of Chengdu"
 SZC_The_University_Of_Chengdu_desc: "Plans have long existed for the construction of a university in Chengdu that will be up to international standards. The time has come to finally realise this vision and turn Chengdu into one of Asia's great centres of learning."

 SZC_A_Modern_Province: "A Modern Province"
 SZC_A_Modern_Province_desc: "Liu Wenhui represents the a more reformist side of the diarchy. He seeks to fully modernise Sichuan with reforms that, while not outright revolutionary, break from some traditional norms and are popular in the cities and with the administrative classes. His reforms are sure to lead to a more well-oiled bureaucracy."

 SZC_Reform_The_Civil_Service: "Reform the Civil Service"
 SZC_Reform_The_Civil_Service_desc: "The civil service is outdated, a relic of the past era of bickering warlords. The first step towards bringing our administration up to date should be to reform our civil services and have a unified framework for them across the region."

 SZC_National_Government_School: "National Government School"
 SZC_National_Government_School_desc: "A lot of our public servants are untrained, a holdover from past administrations. We should standardise their training and the rules they operate under so that everyone in Sichuan knows that they can rely on their government representatives."

 SZC_Industrial_Modernisation: "Industrial Modernisation"
 SZC_Industrial_Modernisation_desc: "Much of Sichuan's industry, even the mighty factories in Chongqing, often resemble the ones of the last century more than this one. Efforts should be made to update them to the standards seen in more developed parts of Asia."

 SZC_Institute_Of_Technical_Research: "Institute of Technical Research"
 SZC_Institute_Of_Technical_Research_desc: "Our industries often rely of a kind of brute force. Numbers, volume, magnitude. Very little effort has been made, however, to empathise technique and refinement of methods. By better training our workers and technicians, we'll be able to maximise the efficiency of what we already have."

 SZC_Light_Industrial_Development: "Light Industrial Development"
 SZC_Light_Industrial_Development_desc: "Sichuan's industrial economy has mostly relied on massive factory complexes. Broadening our focus to encompass smaller industries with a focus on more nimble, precise engineering and production will diversify our economy and bring our industrial boom to the countryside."

 SZC_Shenghang_Hydropower_Plant: "Shenghang Hydropower Plant"
 SZC_Shenghang_Hydropower_Plant_desc: "There's still a lot of untapped energy potential in hydroelectric power and Sichuan's terrain is perfect from it. If the construction plans for a hydroelectric plant in Shenghang are realised, we'll be able to fulfil much of our country's energy needs and expand our economy."

 SZC_Attract_Foreign_Intellectuals: "Attract Foreign Intellectuals"
 SZC_Attract_Foreign_Intellectuals_desc: "A wise man knows that he has a lot to learn and a good government will not be afraid to use the best talents from abroad to improve the lot of their people. By attracting some of the brightest minds from Asia, America and Europe to Sichuan, we'll be able to drastically improve our educational and research efforts."

 SZC_Buddhist_Influence: "Buddhist Influence"
 SZC_Buddhist_Influence_desc: "Wenhui may be a reformer, but a lot of his visions have a foundation in Buddhist thought. By bringing this to the forefront and gaining the assistance from Buddhist institutions in Sichuan, we'll be able to win more support for our ideas among Sichuan's more traditionalist elements."

 SZC_Break_The_Gender_Roles: "Break the Gender Roles"
 SZC_Break_The_Gender_Roles_desc: "With the advancements in technology, there's no reason for women to be forced out of traditionally male roles. Advancements in military technology even let them take the fight to the enemy, be it with a rifle in their hands or in the cockpit of a plane."

 SZC_Protect_The_Tibetans: "Protect the Tibetans"
 SZC_Protect_The_Tibetans_desc: "Though we may not always see eye to eye with the government of Tibet, we should do our best do make sure that the Tibetans living within our borders are treated fairly both by the state and its citizens."

 SZC_Industrial_Victory: "Industrial Victory"
 SZC_Industrial_Victory_desc: "The dice were cast and Liu Xiang's gamble paid off. The Zhili may have denied him the governorship in the past, but now he holds all of Sichuan in his iron fist. A man of great ambitions, he's unlikely to stop here."

 SZC_Consolidate_The_Province: "Consolidate the Province"
 SZC_Consolidate_The_Province_desc: "The war has been won and the petty warlords vanquished, but we can't rest on our laurels. There is plenty of work to be done and we must take steps to secure or victory and expand our base of power beyond Chongqing, by force if others make it necessary."

 SZC_Family_Matters: "Family Matters"
 SZC_Family_Matters_desc: "One of the most prominent figures of the defeated Baoding Department in Sichuan is Liu Wenhui, the warlord of Xikang and also Liu Xiang's uncle. It's an unfortunate state of affairs, but one which will have to be addressed one way or another. Liu Xiang hopes he'll come to his senses, but is nonetheless prepared for the worst should he be stubborn in his opposition."

 SZC_Align_The_Minor_Warlords: "Align the Minor Warlords"
 SZC_Align_The_Minor_Warlords_desc: "Even though our rivals are dead or exiled, several lesser warlords remain with their own militias, posing a threat to our power. Some of them can be brought on board by integrating them into our armies and police forces and the rest can surely be pacified once their numbers become irrelevant."

 SZC_Entice_The_Urban_Merchants: "Entice the Urban Merchants"
 SZC_Entice_The_Urban_Merchants_desc: "Order cannot be maintained at gunpoint alone. If we are to succeed, we need to win over the region's wealthy bourgeoisie, small as it may be, to our cause. With the right mix of carrots and the occasional stick, we're sure that they'll see the benefits of siding with us."

 SZC_Form_The_National_Protection_Alliance: "Form the National Protection Alliance"
 SZC_Form_The_National_Protection_Alliance_desc: "It's finally time for the independent governors of China to assert themselves against the Beijing regime. [SZC.GetLeader] will therefore try to create an alliance between us and our like-minded partners in the region against the Zhili. Once they're finally dealt with, the rest should surely fall in line behind our leadership."

 SZC_A_Grandiose_Plan: "A Grandiose Plan"
 SZC_A_Grandiose_Plan_desc: "Ever since Liu Xiang was denied the governorship of Sichuan, the Zhili and their lapdogs have done nothing but hold us back. We can only tolerate this for so long. It's high time that [SZC.GetLeader] marched his army into Beijing and shattered them, once and for all - uniting all of China under his rule if he has to."

 SZC_The_Lord_Of_Sichuan: "The Lord of Sichuan"
 SZC_The_Lord_Of_Sichuan_desc: "With [SZC.GetLeader]'s undisputed rule over Sichuan now a fact, the age of bickering warlords is finally over. Now that all the pieces are on place and any potential threat to the Industrial Corps has been either destroyed or pacified, we can finally forge ahead and decide Sichuan's fate for ourselves."

 SZC_Famine_Relief_Corps: "Famine Relief Corps"
 SZC_Famine_Relief_Corps_desc: "The people - or our soldiers, for that matter - cannot feed themselves from bark, grass and clay. Since the recent civil war created countless prisoners of war from the traitorous factions, we'll offer them the prospect of amnesty in exchange for tilling the fallow fields and preparing the distribution of food. Under close watch of our soldiers, of course."

 SZC_Aggressive_Modernisation: "Aggressive Modernisation"
 SZC_Aggressive_Modernisation_desc: "The old regime evidently didn't bother to catch up with the rest of the China. Instead, it clearly neglected its duty to its people and now we're the backwater of China. Our people will need to work hard to make up for the past decade's neglect and we'll make sure it bears fruit."

 SZC_Fund_The_Construction_Industry: "Fund the Construction Industry"
 SZC_Fund_The_Construction_Industry_desc: "Yang Sen was content to simply lord over fields of opium that wouldn't look out of place in the worst periods of the 19th century. If we are to bring Sichuan into the new era, however, the state will need to invest big in order to make it happen. Spare no expenses today, so that the next generation will be prosperous!"

 SZC_The_Riches_Of_Xikang: "The Riches of Xikang"
 SZC_The_Riches_Of_Xikang_desc: "The wealth of Xikang lays mostly untapped beneath the mountains. We'll need a modern steel industry so that our mighty military can march into battle with the rifles, cannons, vehicles and ships that they need."

 SZC_Expand_Arms_Production: "Expand Arms Production"
 SZC_Expand_Arms_Production_desc: "The original ambitions of Liu Xiang always accounted for the inevitability of war. The Industrial Corps rose to prominence through conflict, and we're unlikely to bring peace to China without more bloodshed. Whether it's defensive or offensive, we need to arm ourselves for fend off our future foes as well."

 SZC_Mass_Education_Campaigns: "Mass Education Campaigns"
 SZC_Mass_Education_Campaigns_desc: "It wasn't just the cities that were neglected by the old Qing overlords and their stooges, but the minds of Sichuan's people as well. Illiteracy runs rampant and most people are clueless as to their rich history and duty to the state. Our literate officers shall act as teachers and the masses will learn by the millions."

 SZC_Currency_Reform: "Currency Reform"
 SZC_Currency_Reform_desc: "Before we defeated our rivals, every local province's warlord had their own worthless currency. That is, if they weren't even relegated to an ancient barter economy. Now that we're in charge, it's time we stamp out these vestiges of the past and start to use one united currency for one united Sichuan."

 SZC_Sichuan_Central_Bank: "Sichuan Central Bank"
 SZC_Sichuan_Central_Bank_desc: "Up until recently much of Sichuan's economy has been splintered into various local financial ecosystems under local mayors and warlords. By finally creating a centralised banking system with its beating heart centred in Chongqing we will be able to break this trend and drive our economy in one unified direction."

 SZC_Standardise_Land_Tax: "Standardise Land Tax"
 SZC_Standardise_Land_Tax_desc: "The old tax system was a byzantine mess. Depending on which province you were in, it was either broken, inefficient or a governor's attempt to rob the people blind. We'll do away with this nonsense and implement our own centralised tax law, free from the grift and inefficiency of the past."

 SZC_Urban_Expansion: "Urban Expansion"
 SZC_Urban_Expansion_desc: "We cannot call ourself a modern nation unless we urbanise. We must encourage people to move in from the countryside and devote everything into expanding our cities. After we're done, Chongqing and Chengdu may well be the envy of Shanghai and Hong Kong!"

 SZC_The_Mighty_Navy: "The Mighty Navy"
 SZC_The_Mighty_Navy_desc: "Our capital of Chongqing rests near the Yangtze River, leaving it rather vulnerable to naval attacks from downriver, but also making it into a perfect base for the future navy of Sichuan. Eventually, a mighty armada of ships shall patrol the rivers, protecting our trade and people from banditry and showing our might to the rest of China."

 SZC_The_Mighty_Air_Force: "The Mighty Air Force"
 SZC_The_Mighty_Air_Force_desc: "Why should we scale the mountains of Sichuan to meet every threat when planes can simply attack them from the air? We'll start by importing foreign technology to use as a base. Once we're done, our air force will be the greatest in all of China, able to protect our skies and strike any foe!"

 SZC_Army_Drills: "Army Drills"
 SZC_Army_Drills_desc: "For far too long, the warlords of Sichuan were content with their forces resembling bandits more than actual soldiers. To mark a clear break from this past, the Chongqing high command is preparing for a programme of province-wide army drilling and retraining. With enough effort, we'll have soldiers that are the most disciplined in all of China!"

 SZC_Adopt_Radio_Communications: "Adopt Radio Communications"
 SZC_Adopt_Radio_Communications_desc: "Modern wars are increasingly fought with the help of radio, radar and computing machines. It's therefore crucial for our modernisation programme that we procure and develop new advances in these fields and that our forces, down to every company, receive training in their use."

 SZC_Dedicated_Logistics_Units: "Dedicated Logistics Units"
 SZC_Dedicated_Logistics_Units_desc: " Even after our army becomes the mightiest in China - at least on paper - it'll be helpless in the field without a steady stream of supplies to keep it marching forward. By utilising Chongqing's industry, we'll set up specialised supply trains that will be the envy of all Chinese military planners!"

 SZC_Large_Front_Operations: "Large Front Operations"
 SZC_Large_Front_Operations_desc: "The key to winning battles is to properly utilise the vast manpower of Sichuan to wear down and overwhelm our foes. While a common warlord would simply use them as a bludgeon, we'll develop sophisticated methods for using large infantry charges as our spearheads, including the management and rapid deployment of reserves."

 SZC_Reverse_Engineer_Modern_Weapons: "Reverse-Engineer Modern Weapons"
 SZC_Reverse_Engineer_Modern_Weapons_desc: "It'd be a waste to simply distribute the foreign equipment we have acquired to the troops. To make the most of it, we'll dispatch our brightest military engineers to reverse-engineer them so that we can produce our own, superior variants."

 SZC_Heavy_Firepower_Tactics: "Heavy Firepower Tactics"
 SZC_Heavy_Firepower_Tactics_desc: "It's clear that we need to double our efforts to produce qualified artillery officers, since many of them still use their batteries in the most rudimentary ways. When we're done reforming our training methods, our artillery will shake the earth itself with mighty barrages ahead of every offensive we launch!"

 SZC_Armament_Production_Innovations: "Armament Production Innovations"
 SZC_Armament_Production_Innovations_desc: "We cannot call our army truly modernised unless we develop our own modern arms. We'll pour more funds into our military R&D department so that they have the means to produce new weapons, made from the ground up by Chinese hands."

 SZC_The_Industrial_Army: "The Industrial Army"
 SZC_The_Industrial_Army_desc: "All our efforts to modernise have borne fruit. Our now mighty army has perfected the fusion of both military and industrial might to overwhelm any foe. Thanks to our industries, we can amass more guns, bullets, bombs and shells to use against our foes than anyone else in China. Let them tremble before the might of the Industrial Army!"

 SZC_Republican_Triumph: "Republican Triumph"
 SZC_Republican_Triumph_desc: "Against all odds, the Officer Department has secured control over the provincial government. The two leaders, Xiong Kewu and Lü Chao, are preparing to consolidate their position and make Sichuan a bastion of republicanism and democracy."

 SZC_Restructure_The_Army_desc: "The Sichuan Provincial Army is in dire need of reforms. Not only to improve its fighting capabilities and loyalty, but to increase its administrative efficiency by reducing bloat and tackling corruption among its ranks. Succeeding will have important consequences by freeing up funds for civilian projects."

 SZC_Recruit_NRA_Veterans: "Recruit NRA Veterans"
 SZC_Recruit_NRA_Veterans_desc: "There is no shortage of former members of the National Revolutionary Army scattered after the failed Northern Expedition. The army is in dire need of experienced officers to confront warlord remnants and help reorganise the army; they will help form the future cadre of officers."

 SZC_Form_Minjun: "Form Minjun"
 SZC_Form_Minjun_desc: "Minjun, or popular/citizen soldiers, are a moniker during the Warlord era referring to volunteer soldiers ranging from militia to bandits. They, therefore, have a mixed reputation, but form the bulk of our forces. They should be properly organised to improve their reputation and abilities."

 SZC_The_Sichuan_Provincial_Army: "The Sichuan Provincial Army"
 SZC_The_Sichuan_Provincial_Army_desc: "The Provincial Army must slowly transform from a bloated mess loyal to different cliques to a proper republican force under a proper civilian government."

 SZC_Military_Affairs_Commission: "Military Affairs Commission"
 SZC_Military_Affairs_Commission_desc: "Until the provincial army is put under command of a civilian central government, the Military Affairs Commission will direct it. This will ensure that it remains under civilian control, improving its strategic and operational expertise with modern organisation and staff officer training."

 SZC_The_Guofangjun_Model: "The Guofangjun Model"
 SZC_The_Guofangjun_Model_desc: "The National Defence Army (Guofangjun) was the armed force of the Federalist movement before and during the Northern Expedition. It was mainly an army composed of volunteers that would be transferred to a future central government when the United Provinces were established. It is this model that we should aspire to."

 SZC_An_End_To_Banditry: "An End to Banditry"
 SZC_An_End_To_Banditry_desc: "Bandits have been endemic to China for decades. Soldiers of defeated cliques, if not integrated into the victor's army, would melt into the countryside and wreak terror as bandits or \"volunteers\". It is time to finally clean up the province and bring peace to the countryside."

 SZC_Repeal_The_Warlord_Taxes: "Repeal the Warlord Taxes"
 SZC_Repeal_The_Warlord_Taxes_desc: "The many warlords of Sichuan had a poor grasp of economics to say the least and the oppressed people were burdened with heavy and inconsistent taxes. They must be repealed as part of our financial reforms and replace unsustainable sources of revenue with better, more stable ones."

 SZC_Provisional_Legal_Code: "Provisional Legal Code"
 SZC_Provisional_Legal_Code_desc: "The old Qing and Republican legal codes have proven to be unsatisfactory as the two barely differed. Until a new central government is formed, a new provisional code should be drafted to help restore stability and improve our legitimacy via the fair handling of justice."

 SZC_County_Self_Governance: "County Self-Governance"
 SZC_County_Self_Governance_desc: "The main Federalist party in China believes that counties are the basic administrative unit of the province and that self-government will help introduce democracy in China. Autonomy will allow the people to be truly free by giving them the ability to make their own political decisions and develop their region."

 SZC_Restore_The_Provincial_Assembly: "Restore the Provincial Assembly"
 SZC_Restore_The_Provincial_Assembly_desc: "Under Xiong Kewu, Sichuan was to adopt a provincial constitution and introduce a legislature as per Chen Jiongming's Reconstruction Plan before he was ousted due to growing factionalism. The Plan should be renewed to introduce democracy to the province."

 SZC_Rural_Literacy_Programs: "Rural Literacy Programmes"
 SZC_Rural_Literacy_Programs_desc: "The literacy rate is very low, causing numerous problems in China. Institutions typically never even reach the countryside. Educating the poor, especially in Sichuan's many rural communities, is our priority in order to create long-term benefits for not only the province, but China as a whole."

 SZC_Education_Reforms: "Education Reforms"
 SZC_Education_Reforms_desc: "After years of war, schools have been thoroughly neglected and the education system ranging from inadequate to non-existent. Education is in dire need of reform in order to meet the demands of our modernisation programmes. China will need more and better educated people in order to prosper."

 SZC_Ban_The_Vices: "Ban the Vices"
 SZC_Ban_The_Vices_desc: "Vices such as gambling and opium addiction have practically destroyed Chinese society. Long campaigns against them will be needed to destroy them and improve the province's social and cultural standing, remove illicit profits and eradicate the problem at its root."

 SZC_Public_Healthcare: "Public Healthcare"
 SZC_Public_Healthcare_desc: "Public health is extremely behind in Sichuan. Many rural communities struggle with access to clinics and hospitals. These institutions should be improved and more of them built so that they can adequately serve the people."

 SZC_Housing_Projects: "Housing Projects"
 SZC_Housing_Projects_desc: "Sichuan is a heavily-populated province, but housing is absolutely inadequate to support it. Expanding it will improve people's livelihoods and, of course, create needed jobs."

 SZC_Infrastructural_Planning: "Infrastructural Planning"
 SZC_Infrastructural_Planning_desc: "Infrastructure is the basis of any development and Sichuan is lagging behind in both road and railroad development. Even river transportation using the Yangtze is inadequate. Infrastructure projects will help the economy by creating jobs and spurring development."

 SZC_Rural_Development: "Rural Development"
 SZC_Rural_Development_desc: "Improving the cities is nice and all, but the vast majority of Chinese will neither see or benefit from it. Our focus should be on Sichuan's innumerable rural communities so that the millions of peasants and townsfolk can benefit from improved development and livelihood."

 SZC_Civil_Service_Reform: "Civil Service Reform"
 SZC_Civil_Service_Reform_desc: "Factionalism caused by Sichuan's numerous cliques fostered serious corruption, making our reforms in other sectors hard to implement. With the warlords out, we can safely purge the civil service and replace corrupt officials and bureaucrats with clean, competent ones."

 SZC_First_Steps_Of_Land_Reform: "First Steps of Land Reform"
 SZC_First_Steps_Of_Land_Reform_desc: "Peasants form the absolute majority of the Chinese population and Sichuan is no exception, being very rural. Few of them own the land they work, killing any chance of socio-economic advancement. Land reform is a necessity to improve their livelihoods and reduce social tensions."

 SZC_Create_A_New_Currency: "Create a New Currency"
 SZC_Create_A_New_Currency_desc: "The Central Government had been unable to enforce a proper and transparent fiscal policy. Until this is improved, we should focus on ourselves and adopt a new currency, a fairly typical move for provincial governments in recent years, to reform the provincial economy."

 SZC_Land_Value_Tax: "Land Value Tax"
 SZC_Land_Value_Tax_desc: "Sun Yat-sen pushed for a Land Value Tax to he adopted in order to improve the country's finances, help push for land reform, and create a fairer taxation and economic system. The Nationalists are pushing for such a system to help modernise the province and improve revenue."

 SZC_Campaign_Against_Corruption: "Campaign Against Corruption"
 SZC_Campaign_Against_Corruption_desc: "Corruption is endemic throughout China from years of conflict and mismanagement. Public campaigns denouncing it and thorough application of punishment against corrupt officials will help purge it from the administration and deter it in the future."

 SZC_Judicial_Renewal: "Judicial Renewal"
 SZC_Judicial_Renewal_desc: "There was little fair application of law during the Warlord era and Sichuan has had it particularly bad. With reforms to our judicial system being introduced, we can restore people's confidence in the rule of law and zealously apply fairer justice."

 SZC_The_Last_Bastion_Of_Federalism: "The Last Bastion of Federalism"
 SZC_The_Last_Bastion_Of_Federalism_desc: "Liangguang has fallen to the Guangxi Clique in a dastardly coup, ejecting the democratically-elected governor Chen Jiongming. Having fled to friendly Sichuan, he hopes to rally federalists and republicans alike and form the movement's last fortress in the province."

 SZC_Solve_The_Opium_Crisis: "Solve the Opium Crisis"
 SZC_Solve_The_Opium_Crisis_desc: "Sichuan is facing an Opium crisis unprecedented in the rest of China, essentially being the centre of production for the drug. The Federalists have been highly successful in stamping out Opium in Guangdong - surely they can replicate there successes in Sichuan."

 SZC_Burn_The_Poppies: "Burn the Poppies"
 SZC_Burn_The_Poppies_desc: "First things first, the poppies must be destroyed. It is a drastic measure, but breaking the industry at its root is merely part of the process, as making production as difficult as possible will encourage farmers to move away from drug production and towards more sustainable agriculture."

 SZC_Promote_Production_Of_Grain: "Promote Production of Grain"
 SZC_Promote_Production_Of_Grain_desc: "If we do not present a viable alternative to the Poppies, the peasants will resent our programme and it will fail. Farmers should be encouraged, if not subsidised, to grow grain instead. This should, hopefully, also reduce the chances of another disastrous famine."

 SZC_The_Breadbasket_Of_China: "The Breadbasket of China"
 SZC_The_Breadbasket_Of_China_desc: "The Sichuan Basin, part of the Upper Yangtze River, has always been highly fertile and was, despite the latest famine, known as the breadbasket of China. Eradicating Opium production and encouraging farmers to return to food production will ensure that Sichuan won't starve again and resume feeding China as a whole."

 SZC_Campaign_Against_Opium: "Campaign Against Opium"
 SZC_Campaign_Against_Opium_desc: "While targeting production of the drug, targeting consumption is also part of solving the crisis. The people must be discouraged from using the drug and, thus, lower demand for it in the first place."

 SZC_Break_Down_The_Opium_Trade: "Break Down the Opium Trade"
 SZC_Break_Down_The_Opium_Trade_desc: "Eradicating the supply chain is as important as attacking demand. With our heavy-handed campaign, trade has been driven underground and low supply has raised its prices and potential profits. We must dismantle this emerging black market for the good of the people and ensure that criminals cannot supply abusers."

 SZC_Peoples_Healthcare: "People's Healthcare"
 SZC_Peoples_Healthcare_desc: "While prevention is more important than healing, there are far too many addicts to ignore. Improving the province's healthcare system will ensure that not only more people can access modern medicine, addicts will be able to seek proper treatment, eradicating that source of demand once and for all."

 SZC_Federal_Institute_Of_Technology: "Federal Institute of Technology"
 SZC_Federal_Institute_Of_Technology_desc: "With the help of the Federal Government, we can establish technical schools in Sichuan, helping train future engineers and specialised workers. This will help create a better future for not only the province, but China as a whole, creating a stronger, wider class of educated people and improving the generally improving quality of life."

 SZC_Mass_Literacy_Campaigns: "Mass Literacy Campaigns"
 SZC_Mass_Literacy_Campaigns_desc: "The Federalist movement is big on education and improving the literacy rate of China. Campaigns to improve it, including night classes for workers and women, will ensure that this rate will improve, helping China catch up to the West."

 SZC_The_University_Of_Chongqing: "The University of Chongqing"
 SZC_The_University_Of_Chongqing_desc: "There are so few institutions of higher education in China. Many of them are in the hands of Westerners, even. Chen Jiongming was successful in founding a university in Guangdong and the new Sichuan Education Committee is eager to establish one in Chongqing as a testament to the progress of Sichuan."

 SZC_Adopt_The_Guangdong_Model: "Adopt the Guangdong Model"
 SZC_Adopt_The_Guangdong_Model_desc: "Chen Jiongming and the Federalists have achieved unparalleled success in reviving Guangdong's economy. The Kuomintang had left the province in a sorry, decrepit state, but they managed to restore and even improve the provincial economy into one of the strongest in all of China. We must follow their model to improve Sichuan's economy."

 SZC_Local_Development_Scheme_2: "Local Development Scheme"
 SZC_Local_Development_Scheme_2_desc: "Unsurprisingly, the Federalists love to focus on the local level. Provinces and even counties within them should be at the forefront of economic development, as only the locals know and understand their own situations. Local businesses and local trade and professional organisations must be involved in any provincial economic plan."

 SZC_Industrial_Planning_Committee_2: "Industrial Planning Committee"
 SZC_Industrial_Planning_Committee_2_desc: "Industrial development requires careful planning. Industry is obviously the future that will drive China towards prosperity and a proper committee should be formed in order to plan this complex development. This is the best course for long-term economic development for both the people and the nation as a whole."

 SZC_Financial_Reform: "Financial Reform"
 SZC_Financial_Reform_desc: "Corruption in the province's finances is highly problematic. Making government finances open to the public will help reduce this corruption while further reforms will ensure that efficiency can be improved, generally improving the provincial government's ability to sustain itself and make better economic decisions."

 SZC_A_True_Civilian_Government: "A True Civilian Government"
 SZC_A_True_Civilian_Government_desc: "Guangdong has had a decade to develop and improve. The Federalists in Sichuan are, however, working from an essentially blank slate: The previous government is in shambles, finances non-existent, popular support low. From this new slate, however, something better can be built for the good of the people."

 SZC_Crack_Down_On_Corruption: "Crack Down on Corruption"
 SZC_Crack_Down_On_Corruption_desc: "Corruption is rampant. After decades of misgovernance, it was inevitable and the cleanup will be substantial. Now under new management, the Federalists has to crack down on this corruption to improve its image to the people and, of course, improve the government's overall situation."

 SZC_Land_To_The_Tiller: "Land to the Tiller"
 SZC_Land_To_The_Tiller_desc: "The Land to the Tiller programme has been a cornerstone of the federalist Public Interest Party since its inception: A reasonable programme of land reform to finally free the peasant without alienating landowners by properly compensating them. An expensive, hard to implement programme to say the least."

 SZC_Rally_Federal_Support: "Rally Federal Support"
 SZC_Rally_Federal_Support_desc: "It's no secret that a movement claiming to be democratic needs popular support and Chen Jiongming's Public Interest Party desperately needs to rally potential supporters to its cause. Republicans must unite, regardless of their party or political affiliation, in the face of tyranny, monarchism and dictatorship."

 SZC_Decentralise_The_Administration: "Decentralise the Administration"
 SZC_Decentralise_The_Administration_desc: "China has a long history of local self-governance due to its sheer size and the coming-and-going power of central authority. The Federalists want to use this tradition to build up local democracy and help people understand and engage in democratic institutions, preparing them for popular rule at a national level."

 SZC_Self_Organisation: "Self-Organisation"
 SZC_Self_Organisation_desc: "As part of this tradition for self-rule, the people should be encouraged to form local organisations of interests, from trade and professional unions to cooperatives and embrace self-organisation as the best way to achieve freedom and prosperity."

 SZC_Establish_The_Chongqing_Government: "Establish the Chongqing Government"
 SZC_Establish_The_Chongqing_Government_desc: "With our presence in Sichuan secured, it is time to continue Chen Jiongming's plan for national reunification: Uniting the southern provinces into a federal government and begin showing to the rest of China that we are capable of creating a democratic government and a prosperous economy. This is the only way to prove tyrants and dictators wrong."

 SZC_The_Chengdu_Conference: "The Chengdu Conference"
 SZC_The_Chengdu_Conference_desc: "A conference of Federalist leaders will be held in Chengdu to discuss the movement's future and, especially, the formation of a federal government. Representatives from the other competing governments of China will also be invited as a way to prove our willingness to cooperate and show our movement's resolve."

 SZC_Provisional_Constitution: "Provisional Constitution"
 SZC_Provisional_Constitution_desc: "Constitutions are one of the most important aspects of a democratic government. The failure of previous Chinese constitutions have been noted and Federalist leaders will draft a provisional one that address their issues and create the base for a federalist, democratic China."

 SZC_The_China_Reconstruction_Plan: "The China Reconstruction Plan"
 SZC_The_China_Reconstruction_Plan_desc: "Chen Jiongming's Reconstruction Plan is the blueprint of the Federalist movement, discussing the failures of the first Republic, of monarchism, of warlordism and the Kuomintang, all while detailing a plan to rebuild and reunite China, potentially peacefully, and bring prosperity, democracy and freedom for the Chinese people."

 SZC_Recover_The_First_Province: "Recover the First Province"
 SZC_Recover_The_First_Province_desc: "The Guangxi Clique's betrayal cannot be forgiven. They must be removed from power once more, and the Federalists will return triumphantly before they can ruin Guangdong with their misrule."

 SZC_Revive_The_Federal_Project: "Revive the Federal Project"
 SZC_Revive_The_Federal_Project_desc: "The idea of a Federal Republic has not been lost. Securing the southern provinces will be one of the first steps in establishing ourselves as a viable alternative to the monarchists in the north, party-dictators in the south and warlords everywhere."

 SZC_Military_Unification: "Military Unification"
 SZC_Military_Unification_desc: "Warlordism cannot be tolerated; the armies of the Federal Republic must be united under a single command structure under civilian oversight. The generals must serve the people and the Republic, not their selfish interests and soldiers will be the protectors, not oppressors."

 SZC_From_Chongqing_To_Beijing: "From Chongqing To Beijing"
 SZC_From_Chongqing_To_Beijing_desc: "The United Provinces must stretch from Chongqing to Beijing. If they will not hear of our words of peaceful reunification, democracy and prosperity, we will bring the tyrants down and free the people ourselves."

 SZC_Purge_the_Party_State: "Purge the Party-State"
 SZC_Purge_the_Party_State_desc: "The Kuomintang have long been our greatest rival. Although the nationalists say they espouse democracy and welfare- the Kuomintang, both Left and Right, are nothing more than supporters of a Party-State with their ideals of ‘political tutelage'. It is time to eradicate them, once and for all!"

 SZC_Liberate_the_Northeast: "Liberate the Northeast"

 SZC_A_New_China_desc: "The Federalists are now the uncontested leaders of China. Under the United Provinces, a New China will be born; the Chinese people will be free and masters of their own destinies. Long live the United Provinces! Long live the Republic!"

 SZC_The_Zhilis_Last_Stand: "The Zhili's Last Stand"
 SZC_The_Zhilis_Last_Stand_desc: "Despite the Royalist's rather foolish attempt to decapitate our Clique by murdering Cao Kun and Wu Peifu in cold blood, they would underestimate our Clique's capacity to rise from the ashes like a mighty phoenix. Rallying under the auspices of the Marshal of Tianjin, and with the most grateful assistance of our true comrades Yang Sen and Liu Cunhou, we will transform Sichuan into the foundational base camp to annihilate the Emperor."

 SZC_modernisation_of_the_desperate: "Modernisation of the Desperate"
 SZC_modernisation_of_the_desperate_desc: "The task before us of taking on the traitors that exiled us is a gargantuan one. If we are to take on the Qing, Sichuan's war-torn industrial base won't do. We'll need to double our industrial efforts, utilise ever resource we can possibly possess in its most absolute form, and dedicate the full strength of the Zhili Clique. All for our final reclamation."

 SZC_partners_of_law_and_order: "Partners of Law and Order"
 SZC_partners_of_law_and_order_desc: "Germany has long been an erstwhile friend of the Zhili in the past, even if temporarily estranged as of recent years. Without them, the Zhili Clique may very well have seen its extinction in the late 1920s. Through our connections and ties to the AOG, the Legation Cities and German East Asia, we're in a position to bring in engineers from Krupp to assist us in the construction of new weapon facilities under this German supervision."

 SZC_emulating_the_smiling_tiger: "Emulating the Smiling Tiger"
 SZC_emulating_the_smiling_tiger_desc: "Whilst much detested in Northern Zhili Circles, it would appear, despite the state of his League, that Sun Chuanfang was indeed correct about something. With our ties to Germany restored and business flourishing, we'll be able to import as many German guns as our gold reserves can purchase. With German armaments, we are sure to annihilate the under-equipped Royalist soldiers."

 SZC_friends_on_the_golden_waterway: "Friends on the Golden Waterway"
 SZC_friends_on_the_golden_waterway_desc: "The \"Hubei Generals\", an informal grouping of retirees, bureaucrats, and businessmen within the Hubei area used to be one of Xiao Yaonan's greatest assets. Utilising his connections he promulgated a stranglehold upon Wuhan's industrial sectors. Whilst the Generals are led by Ha Hanzhang, who finds himself as our enemy, Xiao nonetheless has his own ties."

 SZC_friends_of_many_enemy_of_one: "Friends of Many, Enemy of One"
 SZC_friends_of_many_enemy_of_one_desc: "Maintaining our connections from our days as the legitimate Central Government, the Cabinet and rump Assembly retain considerable influence amongst the international community. With this in mind, the necessity of armaments to fund our future conflict requires more guns than our current industry can provide. By forging new deals and putting our money reserves to good use we should be able to quickly re-equip and retrain our army with foreign help."

 SZC_the_north_remembers: "The North Remembers"
 SZC_the_north_remembers_desc: "If we fight the Qing alone, then we'll surely die alone as well. Before any further action is taken against them it would be wise to rally as many potential allies to our cause as we can muster in the region. Luckily for us, there we're hardly the only ones with grievances against Beijing. With Zhili factions all across the nation, and those who are sympathetic, we are sure to construct an anti-monarchy alliance to rival the Tongmenghui!"

 SZC_vindicating_the_invisible_element: "Vindicating the Invisible Element"
 SZC_vindicating_the_invisible_element_desc: "Perhaps their ultimate undoing, and proof of China's inherent Republican outlook, the Central Plains still retains numerous Republican and Zhili sympathisers within the Qing's current domain. More than happy to once again stick it to the Royalists, they are already establishing sects of secret networks, and are in communication with our own intelligence staff. The Qing army will know no respite as we wreak havoc on them from the shadows."

 SZC_Rally_The_Zhili_Remnants: "Rally the Zhili Remnants"
 SZC_Rally_The_Zhili_Remnants_desc: "Loyal soldiers and officers alike are worth their weight in gold at this crucial moment. With Sichuan established as the last line of defence for the Zhili, it's imperative that we put out a call to our friends and allies that Sichuan is a safe haven where the long arms of the Qing's secret police can't reach them. Under the auspices of the Marshal of Tianjin, we will no doubt reclaim our rightful land!"

 SZC_the_path_of_reform: "The Path of Reform"
 SZC_the_path_of_reform_desc: "Reforming later is too pitiful of an outlook! The Marshal of Tianjin would see a form of martial law instituted until the reclamation of Beijing. That is simply not good enough. The Manchu Coup undoubtedly displayed the fallacies of the Zhili's old regime, and if we are to truly reconstitute both the Beiyang Republic and the people's adoration, we must adopt a more open model of governance."

 SZC_administration_of_fraternity: "Administration of Fraternity"
 SZC_administration_of_fraternity_desc: "If we are to truly conduct a great overhaul of our old system, we must ensure the participation of exceptional individuals in order to provide an exceptional governance. With President Yan having descended from the famous and adored Diplomatic Corps, he has seen it fit to welcome Diplomat Wellington Koo into our government. Together they shall lay the groundwork to take the initial steps towards administrative reform."

 SZC_new_leaf_of_a_reborn_republic: "New Leaf of a Reborn Republic"
 SZC_new_leaf_of_a_reborn_republic_desc: "No more shall the Beiyang Republic be ruled by military strongmen! No more shall the legacy of Xinhai be beholden to autocrats! The mission of Good People's Governance shall be seen to fruition, and by welcoming the participation of the Political Science Clique and the Independents, we shall construct a true Assembly and Senate that answers to the people."

 SZC_three_cliques_one_mission: "Three Cliques, One Mission"
 SZC_three_cliques_one_mission_desc: "Our administrative structure is a horrific and hastily composed abomination of the Armament Department's local provincial administration, and the influx of both Beiyang and Zhili officials. Rather unfortunately brought together in such dire circumstances, the Armament Department, the Jinbao Clique and the Luoyang Clique must ultimately streamline and unify their internal structures, so as to ensure efficient governance."

 SZC_legacy_of_jinbao_and_luoyang: "Legacy of Jinbao and Luoyang"
 SZC_legacy_of_jinbao_and_luoyang_desc: "The most premier of any and all warlord cliques, the Jinbao and Luoyang factions of the Zhili Clique are perhaps the closest Cliques to completing the full transition to good, responsible statesmen. With many members of either faction having folden within the civilian bureaucracy, we have truly proven the fact that the Zhili are the legitimate rulers of China. Orthodox and principled, technocratic governance is assured under our watch."

 SZC_following_the_king_of_baoding: "Following the King of Baoding"
 SZC_following_the_king_of_baoding_desc: "Whilst the Cao Kun Constitution of 1923 proves itself to be a radically progressive piece of institutional documentation, it has also proven itself capable for extreme abuse by the executive. To modernise and surpass our forebears, whilst preserving their intentions, we must follow precisely in Cao Kun's footsteps. Drafting our own constitution, considering the faults and merits of the previous, we will march into a new era of liberty and prosperity."

 SZC_a_state_run_by_competence: "A State Run by Competence"
 SZC_a_state_run_by_competence_desc: "For far too long military and civilian advancement within the state has hinged more on lineage, connections and bribes than actual talent. Now that we're forced to start from scratch, many within the cabinet and military are advocating for a \"State Run by Competence\". One that prioritises meritocracy, and servitude rather than relations."

 SZC_shus_march_of_progress: "Shu's March of Progress"
 SZC_shus_march_of_progress_desc: "Ever most capable, ever a stalwart grouping of solid friends, comrades and associates, the Armament Department has proven itself more than capable of being integrated into the Zhili Clique. With the support of Sichuan, we shall bring the province into modernity, wiping away the decades of warlord squabbles, for a new revived state-building project. Together, hand-in-hand, a new China is forged."

 SZC_march_of_the_grieving_army: "March of the Grieving Army"
 SZC_march_of_the_grieving_army_desc: "True, our army grieves. For it has lost not only its leader, but one of its greatest commanders. As much as the animosity between Marshal Wang and Marshal Wu tore them apart, at the end of the day they still had a duty to do. Wu served to the end, fulfilling his duty. No doubt attempting to defend Cao from hails of bullets. Similarly, Marshal Wang and the rest of the Zhili Army must march forever onwards. For their memory, at the very least."

 SZC_the_return_of_tianjin: "The Return of Tianjin"
 SZC_the_return_of_tianjin_desc: "Finally, the odd one out, the little Clique in the internal Zhili power struggle, Tianjin has formally succeeded both Baoding and Luoyang. Whilst it was merged into that of Baoding to form Jinbao, it nonetheless has survived both Cao and Wu. With its founders being that of the late Cao Rui, Bian Shoujing and of course, Marshal Wang, Tianjin used to play second fiddle to Wu and Cao. Not any more."

 SZC_constitutionalism_for_the_masses: "Constitutionalism for the Masses"
 SZC_constitutionalism_for_the_masses_desc: "Cao Kun's service and sacrifice will not be forgotten. He may have been murdered along with Wu, but his legacy will live on through the constitution he drafted in 1923. A hallmark piece of legislature, it will provide the people with the security and freedoms they deserve, both here in Sichuan as well as Beijing when we return home. Truly without Cao Kun, there would be no new China."

 SZC_government_of_one_mind_one_body: "Government of One Mind, One Body"
 SZC_government_of_one_mind_one_body_desc: "For too long has the meddling assembly bickered over the intricacies of legislature, the whims of bureaucrats derailing good governance for their ill-informed agendas. Their damnable haranguing nearly cost the whole Zhili Clique, and their prized Beiyang Democracy! For this period of reclamation, the governmental body must act with one mindset, and in perfect unison. Surely even our opposition will adhere to such a fact."

 SZC_government_of_bread_and_circuses: "Government of Bread and Circuses"
 SZC_government_of_bread_and_circuses_desc: "Despite our best efforts, there are still those that do not understand their place by putting personal interests ahead of the nation. For these individuals we must appease them during this time of great struggle. Satisfying the people's most immediate requirements and desires, they may support our regime for its perennial struggle. Reform will happen, but it must wait until the reconquest."

 SZC_primacy_of_the_central_army_desc: "To best face the challenges that lie ahead our society will need be a militant one. From top to bottom, we'll embrace the virtues of military service and honour the Central Army. For without the Central Army, the legacy of Xinhai would very much have died in the coup. Knowing this, our soldiers will be instilled with a greater sense of duty and valour, putting them well above the rabble our enemy is sure to field."

 SZC_salvaging_the_lessons_of_baoding_desc: "We may have been deposed from the most premier of all military academies within the nation, but its lessons stay with us no matter where we travel. By refining local training methods on the merits of Baoding, we'll have our officers and soldiers drilled to a point where they'll be better equipped not only to adapt to battlefield developments, but we'll be more resilient to any loss of institutional knowledge."

 SZC_the_nations_first_line_of_defence: "The Nation's First Line of Defence"
 SZC_the_nations_first_line_of_defence_desc: "We must always be three steps ahead of our enemies. By giving more freedom to our military intelligence branch to act unrestrained, we'll know every move our enemy makes, be it a foreign or internal threat. One of our many follies was not adequately trusting our military intelligence rings before it was too late. Marshal Wang shall not make such a mistake. The people of China will forever be safe under the Public Safety Bureau."

 SZC_Prepare_The_Final_Offensive_desc: "Sichuan province is rapidly preparing itself for the twilight struggle. For the final push. Our entire society backs both Military and Marshal.

Together with the civilians, the remnants of Beiyang, and his ever loyal Zhili officers and soldiers, the Zhili Clique shall bring the much anticipated hammer to the anvil.

 SZC_xinhai_all_over_again_desc: "We rose from the ashes after the Qing thought they'd destroyed us. Now they and everyone else that stood with them against us have been humbled by our victories. We must consolidate our position and restore order to China, for the Zhili is here to stay. The restoration of normal efforts in the Assembly, collaboration with the Senate, and widely anticipated elections has resulted in a new burst of idealism."

 SZC_elections_of_the_victorious_desc: "Most fortuitously, Marshal Wang and Diplomat Yan were truly only leaders in the nation's most dire moments. With the restoration of our rightful place within the Chinese nation, a series of scheduled national elections have been announced. The first to have been held in many years. Hopefully with the new mandate, the new president can foresee a period of reconciliation, reconstruction, and new popular support."

 SZC_unity_forged_through_tragedy_desc: "Surrounded by the rubble, the bodies of our comrades, the tears of the revolutionaries, and the ashes of the nation.

Now it is nothing more than a shadow, neglected by the government. To truly reclaim the birthright of the Chinese Republic, we similarly must revive China's naval tradition. Famously apolitical, mostly, the Navy worked with the Manchus, however we cannot blame them. After all, they only want to sail the seas."

 SZC_forging_modernity_through_strength_desc: "Whilst they rather reluctantly collaborated with the Manchu Royalists, it has become increasingly clear that the Young China Party were merely victims of their own hubris.

 SZC_country_intro_content: "As 1936 dawns, §gSichuan§! remains in a very fragile balance between its multiple factions. §gYang Sen§! holds for now, buoyed by §PZhili§! support from his personal backer, the §PJade Marshal Wu Peifu§! and aided by his close associate and former governor of §gSichuan§!, §PLiu Cunhou§!, whose status and connections, as well as considerable forces, give §gYang§! sorely needed stability and legitimacy. However, the military disasters of the past decade led §gYang Sen§! to rely on the cliques led by §cDeng Xihou§! and §PLiu Xiang§!, who now hold considerable influence in the government and in Sichuan itself. The remnants of the §RKMT-aligned§! §SOfficer Department§! still control parts of southern §gSichuan§!, though the years since have seen their area of control steadily diminish.\n\n§gSichuan§! stands at the edge of a knife, internally divided, with multiple factions vying for ultimate power in the province. It may take only the slightest sign of weakness in the §PZhili§! for this powderkeg to blow up..."

 SZC_country_intro_header_1: "The §gSichuan Clique§!"
 SZC_country_intro_content_1: "The modern history of §gSichuan§! begins in 1912. When the §lXinhai Revolution§! reached §gSichuan§!, the region entered a period of prolonged instability, with regional warlords vying for the governorship by diplomacy and force. Between 1912 and 1926, the region was alternatively controlled by §lXinhai revolutionaries§!, §RKuomintang loyalists§! and §Plocal warlords§!.\n\nThis state of affairs would last until the failure of the Northern Expedition in 1926. With the personal support of the victorious §PZhili§! leader, §cWu Peifu§!, §gYang Sen§! was able to establish himself as the firm ruler of §gSichuan§!, finally restoring some semblance of stability to the region. However, the profound divisions within §gSichuan would§! not disappear, with §gYang§! rapidly becoming beheld to the interests for various internal cliques that formed and unable to remove their influence. §PLiu Xiang§!, one of these warlords, established himself in §PChongqing§! by allying himself with the local administration, quickly becoming §gYang's§! main rival for control over §gSichuan§!.\n\n1928 saw §gSichuan§! face an invasion from the neighbouring clique of §gYunnan§!. While at first a success, the invasion was soon defeated by §gSichuanese§! forces, causing considerable losses among §gYang's§! personal forces. A §PTibetan§! invasion in 1930 deteriorated the situation even further, with §PTibetan§! troops reaching the Yangtze River and directly threatening the capital of §gChengdu§!. While the involvement of the §PMa Clique§! to the north eventually turned the tide against the §PTibetans§!, §gSichuan§! was forced to cede half of the §gXikang§! region to §PTibet§! and §gYang's§! military was left in tatters."

 SZC_country_intro_header_2: "The §gSichuan Clique§! (Part 2)"
 SZC_country_intro_content_2: "While the §PTibetan§! invasion was repelled, this was not the end of §gSichuan's§! troubles. In 1931, a group of §RKuomintang-aligned§! officers, §Pwarlords§! and §gformer governors§! of §gSichuan§!, the §SOfficer Department§!, launched its first expedition into §gSichuan§! from their bases in northern §gYunnan§!, with tacit support from §PTang Jiyao's Republican government§!. The tattered §gSichuanese§! forces under §gYang§! were no match for the §RKMT§! troops, being routed time and again, losing most of their supplies to the advancing invasion forces. With the §gClique§! on the brink of collapse, warlord §gYang Sen§!, in a move of desperation, formed a temporary alliance with §PChongqing§! warlord §PLiu Xiang§! and his clique, the §PIndustrial Corps§!. With assistance from §PLiu's§! forces, §gYang§! was able to beat back the expedition. Further cooperation with the §PIndustrial Corps§! allowed §gSichuan§! to begin rebuilding its army, at the cost of ever increasing §PIndustrial Corps§! influence within the government.\n\nAnother group to rise in influence at this time was §cDeng Xihou's Baoding Department§!, whose forces helped suppress the §SOfficer Department§! while §gYang§! rebuilt his forces. The highly visible work by the §cBaoding Department§! in suppressing the rebels led to an increase in the group's popularity, which is seen by more and more citizens as the true protectors of §gSichuan§!.\n\nAnother invasion attempt in 1933 by §gYunnan§!, in support of the §SOfficer Department§!, was quickly aborted when the §PLeague-Marshal of the Eight Provinces§!, §PSun Chuanfang§!, threatened to intervene. The unexpected §gYunnanese§! retreat allowed §gYang§! to partially reoccupy §gsouthern Sichuan§!. The chaos also allowed §gTian Songyao§! to establish himself in the northeast as a §gminor warlord§!, yet his ambitions remain a mystery."

 SZC_country_intro_header_3: "§gSichuan§!, Divided"
 SZC_country_intro_content_3: "§gSichuan§! in 1936 stands divided, with multiple factions vying for absolute power.\n\nThe ruling faction at the moment is the §gArmament Department§!, led by §gYang Sen§! and his close associate §PLiu Cunhou§!. Due to §cWu Peifu's§! personal support over the years, the §gDepartment§! is closely aligned to the §PZhili authorities§! in §cBeijing§! and §PNanjing§!. While their influence remains secure for now, the §gclique§! has grown dependent on §PZhili support§! in the last decade. Should something befall the §PZhili§!, §gYang's§! authority will be dangerously threatened.\n\n§gYang's§! chief rival for control over §gSichuan§! is §PChongqing§! warlord §PLiu Xiang§!, leader of the §PIndustrial Corps§!. §PLiu Xiang§! remains an erstwhile ally of §gYang§! since the §RKMT§! expedition in 1931, but §PLiu§! is an ambitious man and makes no secret of his desire to rule §gSichuan§!. Should the opportunity appear, the §PIndustrial Corps§! may quickly reconsider the usefulness of their alliance with §gYang Sen§!.\n\nThe third most important faction is the §cBaoding Department§!, a clique formed by former §cBaoding§! graduates - though this is not a prerequisite for membership - and led by §gYang's§! general §cDeng Xihou§!. In the last few years, their highly visible operations against §Srebel enclaves§! in the south have seen them gain popularity among the people. The §cBaoding Department§! forms a core of §gYang's§! support in the region. While §cDeng§! has long been loyal to §gYang§!, he may very well be considered a threat to §gYang's§! rule.\n\nIn the south, the remnants of a §RKMT§! expedition in 1931 continue to hold territory. The §SOfficer Department§!, as they are called, are the main group openly resisting §gYang's§! control of §gSichuan§!. Led by §gLü Chao§! and §lXiong Kewu§!, the group maintains close relations with the nearby clique of §gYunnan§!, on whose support they depend to survive."

 sichuan.5.t: "Unrest in the South"
 sichuan.5.d: "Following the sale of the ZheGan railroad in the League of Eight Provinces, worrying rumours of widespread unrest have begun to emerge. Starting off as whispers of protests suppressed by League police forces, our border guards now report streams of refugees fleeing violence and an explosion of banditry flowing across our borders.\n\nIt appears a peaceful protest in Wuhu escalated into a violent bloodbath after League forces fired upon the protestors - a scene that began to repeat itself across the League in the days following what is now being termed the 'Wuhu Incident'. Some are now claiming the League - and the Zhili order that backs it up - are on their last legs, though most are still willing to believe that military force can keep the unrest contained."
 sichuan.5.a: "It will pass, as it has done in the past."

 sichuan.6.t: "Marshal Sun Chuanfang Shot by Assassin"
 sichuan.6.d: "Grave news coming from the League of Eight Provinces: League-Marshal Sun Chuanfang, the highest Zhili authority in the region, lays in a coma, mortally wounded after being shot by an assassin. Zhili control over the south has already begun to break down and it will not be long before the waves reach us in Sichuan. Should the worst come and the south fall to chaos, Beijing may become too busy to be able to assist us."

In Nanjing, general Qi Xieyuan has appointed himself acting League-Marshal after assuming control of the city. With the League collapsing in the aftermath of Sun's shooting, KMT rebels long thought suppressed have risen up in Fujian in an attempt to restore the National Government. The governor of Anqing has declared war on Qi, accusing him of masterminding the assassination attempt to take over the League. Further west, the governors of Hunan, Guangxi and Guangdong have refused to recognise the authority of the new League-Marshal, but so far have not opened hostilities.\n\nThe situation has become dire enough for the central government in Beijing to become directly involved, with Qing troops and supplies already on their way south. For now, it seems Beijing's attention is completely captured by the crisis to the south and we are on our own."

Further west, the governors of Hunan, Guangxi and Guangdong have refused to recognise the authority of the new League-Marshal, but so far have not opened hostilities.\n\nTo make matters worse, the government in Beijing has refused to intervene to restore order and is facing massive protests over its decision.

 sichuan.7.a: "This is a catastrophe!"

 sichuan.8.t: "Liu Xiang Mobilises Against Us"
 sichuan.8.d: "As the fragile Sichuanese order turns against us with the troubles in the League of Eight Provinces, Liu Xiang has decided to cross the Rubicon, so to speak. With his gargantuan army, he has moved out of Chongqing and soldiers of the Industrial Corps can be seen moving all around Sichuan, mainly its Eastern portions. Our former allies have betrayed us and our friends have left us. For now, however, the Baoding Department has decided to stick with us. All around Sichuan, armies are mobilising - and we must mobilise too. The time has come for us to cast the die, the fate of Sichuan hangs in the balance."

 sichuan.9.t: "Sichuan Collapses into Civil War"
 sichuan.9.d: "Sichuan has descended into chaos.\n\nAll across the province, the forces of the Industrial Corps battle with the Armament Department and the Baoding Department, temporarily fighting side-by-side against the largest army in Sichuan. Liu Xiang has issued a command from Chongqing for his troops to move in and engage, and they have done just so. Heavy fighting has started, especially on the Yangtze.\n\nIn the South, the Officer Department sees an opportunity to push North, with their troops moving in as well.\n\nThe Baoding Department has remained loyal to Chengdu, with their forces fighting alongside ours in the bloody war of provincial unification. The facade of stability in Sichuan has been broken and only the heavens know what will come of the province."

Rather than burning that bridge with the downfall of the Armament Department, we decided to nurture this bond in light of the past cooperation between us as well as the fact that many members of their leadership trace their military roots back to the Baoding academy.

With the outbreak of the Two Lius' War in Sichuan, the province was once again plunged into conflict - a final chance to stop Xiang's ambitions. However, this was not meant to be. Despite fierce resistance, the former warlord of Xikang and leader of the rebels, Xiang's uncle Liu Wenhui, has been decisively defeated in Meishan, with Xikang being overrun soon afterwards, forcing him to flee his nephew's wrath. He has now arrived in [Root.GetNonIdeologyNameDef], asking to join our armed forces. Some believe he's out for revenge, but despite said rumours, he's also a skilled general who could prove to be a valuable asset."
 sichuan.20.a: "Welcome to [Root.GetNonIdeologyNameDef]."
 sichuan.20.b: "We have no need of opium warlords."

 sichuan.50.t: "Yang Sen Requests Support"
 sichuan.50.d: "Dire news coming in from Chengdu.\n\nThe tenuous peace in the region fell apart not long after the troubles in the League of Eight Provinces reached a boiling point, greatly diminishing the influence of the Sichuanese leader Yang Sen. The internal divisions in the clique have escalated into open conflict as the Chongqing warlord Liu Xiang, leader of the Industrial Corps with its massive force in manpower and firepower alike, has begun to march on Yang's forces. For now at least, Yang's allies in the Baoding department under Deng Xihou remain, but even that is an uncertainty as the situation spirals further out of control with every passing day.\n\nWith the current chaos in Sichuan, it can't be ruled out that a prolonged conflict where both sides exhaust their strength could lead to the remnants of the KMT under Lü Chao seizing the moment to reverse their old misfortunes. As if that wasn't enough, persistent droughts have hit hard Sichuan's already struggling people. With disaster looming, our old friend Yang has reached out to us, pleading that we offer any support we may muster. While the consequences of a defeat for Yang could prove severe for us in the future, we also have our own crises in the light of the situation in Nanjing."
 sichuan.50.a: "Send them what we can spare."
 sichuan.50.b: "We can't spare anything right now."

 sichuan.51.t: "Wu Peifu Sends Support"
 sichuan.51.d: "After so many of our erstwhile 'allies' having turned on us, it's good to know that some of our friends will still stand by our side. Heeding our calls for help, Wu Peifu has pledged to support [SZC.GetLeader] and the [SZC.GetRulingParty]. This has bolstered the morale of our forces and the supplies provided will surely prove invaluable as we face the full might of the Industrial Corps."
 sichuan.51.a: "At least *someone* still likes us..."

 sichuan.52.t: "Wu Peifu Abandons Us"
 sichuan.52.d: "As if the internal duplicity wasn't grave enough, our 'friends' from abroad now turn their backs on us as well. More concerned with internal matters than the plight of a loyal friend, Wu Peifu has refused to lend us any help in the struggle against Xiang and the Industrial Department. It seems that for now at least, we're on our own. News of this unfortunate turn of events has already reached the front lines, demoralising our soldiers."
 sichuan.52.a: "Well, at least there are no allies left to betray us..."

 sichuan.53.t: "Officer Department asks for Support"
 sichuan.53.d: "The military clique of Sichuan to the north has collapsed into civil war, with the various warlords of the province turning on each other. While in most cases this would be business as usual in China, the very south of Sichuan has been occupied by the Officer Department, remnants of the KMT-aligned groups that supported our last invasion in 1933. Now, with this civil war, they have a chance, however small, of taking control of the entire province and are asking for our support on their endeavour. Supporting the Officer Department will certainly be costly, but the advantages of turning Sichuan into a KMT stronghold must not be underestimated."
 sichuan.53.a: "Send them some troops."
 sichuan.53.b: "Send them some guns."
 sichuan.53.c: "This is not worth the cost."

 sichuan.54.t: "Yunnan Supports the Officer Department"
 sichuan.54.d: "With the current turmoil in Sichuan, Yunnan has seized on the opportunity to back their Officer Department lapdogs that supported them in their invasion of us in 1933, no doubt hoping that they'll do their dirty work for them. Our spies tell us that Yunnan has already begun shipping aid and arms across the border, bolstering the Officer Department's forces in the south."
 sichuan.54.a: "Stop meddling in our affairs!"

 sichuan.55.t: "Industrial Corps Approaches Suining"
 sichuan.55.d: "Reports are coming in that the massive forces of the Industrial Corps are marching towards Suining at an alarming pace. The location is of great strategic importance because of its proximity to both Xiang's and our own base of power, serving as the hub of the road network in the southern basin not far from Chongqing.\n\nLiu Cunhou, a trusted ally of Yang, claims that the city can be defended against the superior numbers of the Industrial Corps and that even if spread thin, our fortifications in and around the city will even the odds in our favour.\n\nWang Lingji, another capable commander of ours, advocates for a more cautious approach, claiming that a strategic withdrawal would allow our currently stretched forces to fight from a better position in the days ahead."
 sichuan.55.a: "Retreat north to Santai and Mianyang."
 sichuan.55.b: "Evacuate towards Chengdu."
 sichuan.55.c: "Entrench and attempt a defence."

 SZC_battle_suining_santai: "§gOrganising a fighting retreat towards the northern towns of Santai and Mianyang is a safe course of action and almost guaranteed to keep our troops safe, but in doing so we will be handing control over a large part of the Basin to Xiang's forces.§!"
 SZC_battle_suining_chengdu: "§cThe quickest retreat route from Suining heads directly towards our capital of Chengdu, but Xiang has been advancing rapidly into the basin. There might not be enough time to reach Chengdu before Xiang's forces arrive.§!"
 SZC_battle_suining_hold: "§cSuining controls a fair bit of road traffic to and from the central Sichuan Basin, but it is also far closer to Xiang's headquarters in Chongqing than our own in Chengdu. Our forces may need to stay dangerously spread out to keep the supply lines open.§!"

 sichuan.56.t: "Flight to the North"
 sichuan.56.d: "After extensive planning and careful preparations, our forces managed to organise and pull off an orderly withdrawal from Suining. Little of military use was left behind as they withdrew to the north, with their numbers fully intact both in men and equipment. While Xiang now controls the region, our forces are in a much better position to deal with any future incursions by the Industrial Corps. The situation may be far from ideal, but opting for the safe alternative has won us valuable time and saved many lives."
 sichuan.56.a: "We got our troops out safely, at least."

 sichuan.57.t: "Battle in Jianyang"
 sichuan.57.d: "The quickest route was also the most predictable. On their way to Chengdu, our forces were attacked in their flanks by Xiang's advancing armies. Despite putting up a valiant resistance, our forces were decimated as they were attacked in the open by the forces of the Industrial Corps. While our forces managed to break out of this dire situation and live on to fight another day, valuable manpower and equipment has been lost in our hasty retreat."
 sichuan.57.a: "This is not good."

 sichuan.58.t: "Encircled in Suining"
 sichuan.58.d: "Since the order to hold Suining at all costs was issued, a confident Liu Cunhou had his forces dig in and prepare for the inevitable assault. As our forces dug in, the forces of the Industrial Corps moved out and encircled our city with their overwhelming advantage in numbers while Liu's forces remained like sitting ducks.\n\nThe battle was brief as most of the forces of the Armament Department surrendered in droves once they realised that they'd merely dug their own graves around a doomed city, netting Xiang a complete victory over our forces. A disgraced Liu Cunhou fled north to the Zhili, narrowly escaping capture himself after this strategic blunder."
 sichuan.58.a: "Disaster!"

 sichuan.59.t: "Neijiang Under Assault"
 sichuan.59.d: "The Industrial Corps and Armament Department are engaged in heavy fighting over the river crossings around Neijiang. The river crossings are of huge strategic importance as whoever's in control of them effectively controls the gateways into the Sichuan basin. These battles have raged since the outbreak of hostilities, but it seems as if Xiang is preparing to launch a final push to seize the bridgeheads.\n\nWhile outnumbered, we should be able to funnel Xiang's forces into our well-prepared defences along these bridgeheads where their numbers will be cut down, although it'd certainly be a costly victory if we aim to hold off the entire might of the Industrial Corps.\n\nWe could, however, have our engineers rig the bridgeheads to blow and trap Xiang's forces. Doing so would, however, prove costly in the long term as the strategic infrastructure of the region would be left in tatters."
 sichuan.59.a: "Defend the bridgeheads at all costs!"
 sichuan.59.b: "Let them cross, then blow the bridges."

 SZC_battle_neijiang_defend: "§cNeijiang controls some of the largest crossings and would be well positioned to attack Xiang's flanks if it is held. However, the attacks by Xiang's forces become more intense by the day. If this trend continues, our defenders may be overrun.§!"
 SZC_battle_neijiang_blow: "§gUsing timed explosives on the bridges, we can draw a fair amount of Industrial Corps soldiers into becoming trapped on our side of the Tuo River and the lack of bridges will make its capture useless for Xiang. It will also become useless to us, unfortunately.§!"

 sichuan.60.t: "Neijiang Overrun By Enemy Forces"
 sichuan.60.d: "Our soldiers and engineers spent day and night preparing the defences of the bridgeheads. Trenches were dug, sandbags and barbed wire was put in place and machine guns and mortars were positioned into effective kill zones for anyone daring to approach them. The first waves of attackers were cut down en masse, but as the hours turned into days and the relentless assaults refused to let up the forces of the Armament Department were running low on ammunition, equipment and soldiers in face of this overwhelming attack.\n\nOne by one, the bridgeheads fell and with them some of our most veteran troops."
 sichuan.60.a: "The Department can't stand much more of this!"

 sichuan.61.t: "Battle of the Bridges"
 sichuan.61.d: "Last night and under cover of darkness our engineers placed dynamite along the key support structures of the bridgeheads. This morning, our forces feigned a withdrawal from the bridges and as expected the enemy took the bait. As the army columns crossed to the other side, the explosives were triggered. Anyone that had made it to the other side was caught in an ambush as our forces emerged, surrendering in droves midst the panic and confusion that ensued. Anyone remaining on the other side could simply watch on helplessly as their comrades-in-arms were overrun, crushing their morale.\n\nWhile we have lost the bridgeheads for the foreseeable future, we've secured an important victory."
 sichuan.61.a: "A victory at last!"

 sichuan.62.t: "Deng Xihou Takes Chengdu"
 sichuan.62.d: "Hammered by blow after blow, the Armament Department has been brought to the brink of a complete collapse. To preempt the coming catastrophe, this morning Baoding troops under control of general Deng Xihou have entered Chengdu. With Yang's forces being bloodied and demoralised by the repeated setbacks of the conflict, it was effectively a bloodless coup as Yang's rule was brought to an effective end with the Baoding Department seizing full control of the state apparatus. The last few forces loyal to Yang have either deserted or joined our side.\n\nWith the situation remaining as dire as ever, we must now prepare Chengdu's defences."
 sichuan.62.a: "We are Sichuan's last stand."

 sichuan.63.t: "The Siege of Chengdu"
 sichuan.63.d: "Early in the morning, the formations of the Industrial Corps finally arrived near Chengdu for what Xiang hopes will be the final battle of this war. It very well may be, but it's a high stakes gamble, to say the least, because at this point his armies are tiring from weeks of marching and fighting.\n\nThe city itself is surrounded by channels derived from Dujiangyan's levees upriver and fortified by walls dating back to the late Qing era, before the Xinhai Revolution. Old as they might be and built before the time of modern artillery the walls still stretch nearly seven miles around the city and stand at over thirty feet in height. Effectively they form a mighty citadel that has stood the test of time, which make it a daunting task for any attacking army to breach.\n\nKnowing that a head-on assault would cause ruin to the Chongqing army, Xiang has instead opted to lay siege to Chengdu. Sporadic shelling has been exchanged between both forces all morning, but it's clear that Xiang's troops have no hopes of breaching the defences anytime soon and have thus dug in for a long siege. While our defences stand for now, this city will be our grave if we simply wait behind these walls. Swift action must be taken!\n\nIf their schemes aren't disrupted, Chengdu will surely fall."
 sichuan.63.a: "Sichuan's fate hangs in the balance."

 sichuan.64.t: "Choosing a Plan of Attack"
 sichuan.64.d: "Liu Xiang's forces have advanced on Chengdu from the east and south and are subjecting the city to a siege. All will be lost if we don't act fast and mount a relief effort to break the siege. Our military leaders all know that we simply can't wait this one out and that offence is our only defence in this situation.\n\nOne such plan is to take advantage of their thin spread around the city to try and cut off and encircle them in a bold offensive strike against Jianyang. In doing so, we can hopefully force the surrender of Xiang's main force, especially their prized engineer units.\n\nOn the other hand, with most of their experienced forces committed to the siege, other members of our high command believe that we should cut the head of the snake by attacking the Chongqing outright. The city should be lightly defended by Xiang's reserve units under mayor Pan Wenhua and its capture would massively disorganise Xiang's efforts due to the city's vital infrastructure.\n\nFinally, there are the officers in our ranks that warn us against putting all our eggs into one basket, urging us instead to split up our forces and attack both targets at once, negating their chances to reinforce their objectives.\n\nThe only thing they seem to agree on is that whatever course of action we choose must be considered carefully as there is no room for mistakes."
 sichuan.64.a: "Move towards Jianyang to encircle Xiang's forces."
 sichuan.64.b: "Move towards Chongqing, it will be weakly defended."
 sichuan.64.c: "Split the forces into two groups and engage in a two-pronged offensive."

 SZC_troop_mobilisation_jianyang: "§lXiang's best forces are concentrated around Chengdu due to the ongoing siege and our forces may be able to cut off Xiang's supply lines by taking the nearby town of Jianyang. We will need all our available forces for this course of action, which will leave the south unattended, possibly giving the Officer Department an opening.§!"
 SZC_troop_mobilisation_chongqing: "§gThe continuing control of Chongqing is absolutely vital for Xiang's war effort and its capture would be a deathly blow to his cause. On the other hand, Pan Wenhua commands a sizeable garrison in the city. Should we fail to quickly overwhelm the city's defences, we risk being caught in a pincer movement between the garrison and any troops Xiang sends to counter our advance.§!"
 SZC_troop_mobilisation_split: "§PSplitting our forces into two attack groups will prevent Xiang and Wenhua from reinforcing each other, but this means our army will need to fight most of the Industrial Army at once. The Industrial Corps is strong and our army might not be up to the task.§!"

 sichuan.65.t: "Yang Sen's Gambit"
 sichuan.65.d: "Having over-extended themselves, the most experienced forces of the Industrial Corps were committed to the siege of our capital while the flanks and rear were guarded by a fresh conscripts from their reserve. Moving swiftly, we managed to sweep away Xiang's thinly spread rear guard detachments. Their superior numbers were spent trying to encircle Chengdu and now they have been cut off, stuck between our main force and the relatively intact Chengdu garrison."
 sichuan.65.a: "Don't let them escape!"

 sichuan.66.t: "The Tides Turn"
 sichuan.66.d: "Xiang's forces had put themselves in a precarious position by committing their most experienced soldiers against the Chengdu defences in an all-or-nothing bid to knock us out of the war. After cutting off Xiang's main forces a swift battle followed between our forces and the trapped vanguard of the Industrial Corps, now desperately attempting to break out of the encirclement. With nowhere to retreat and no hope to be rescued, it wasn't long before morale and unit cohesion broke down within their ranks, leading to Xiang's forces surrendering in droves.\n\nWith Chengdu safe, we must now press the attack into the enemy's heartland!"
 sichuan.66.a: "Onwards now, to Chongqing!"

 sichuan.67.t: "Pan Wenhua's Betrayal"
 sichuan.67.d: "Despite the Industrial Corps' main force falling into disarray following the defeat in Chengdu, the Chongqing garrison remained a formidable force. Under the capable command of Xiang's second-in-command, the mayor of Chongqing, Pan Wenhua, it numbered in the thousands and was being directly resupplied every day by the city's large factories. It was clear that if there was a fight for the city, it'd be a long and hard fight, even with Liu Xiang out of the picture. When word reached us that forward detachments from the Officer Department were marching towards the city, our commanders were relieved. Surely expecting the Industrial Corps to not put up a fight, the Officers would march into a death trap as they neared the city.\n\nUnfortunately for us, this was not meant to be.\n\nInstead of being greeted with bullets and bombs from the city's defences, they were greeted with open arms as the banner of the Industrial Corps flying over the city was quickly exchanged for the colours of the Kuomintang and of the Federalists. Pan Wenhua declared his loyalty to the cause of the revolutionary army. This was apparently not just the cowardly act of an opportunistic turncoat, but an act of planned deceit and treachery. Not only had Pan Wenhua coordinated this with Lü Chao and Xiong Kewu of the Officer Department, but it became clear that he's likely been in contact with major KMT figures like Song Qingling and Deng Yanda for a very long time.\n\nAlthough their armies have yet to fully link up, Chongqing's considerable industrial output has effectively been given to the Officer's Department as a wrapped gift, all right under our noses.\n\nThis is dire news indeed and it has effectively changed the entire situation on the ground in an instant."
 sichuan.67.a: "Wait, what?"

 sichuan.68.t: "The Industrial Corps Disintegrates"
 sichuan.68.d: "Xiang gambled big on a quick victory and lost it all. Overstretched, exposed and exhausted from weeks of fighting with little regard for losses, the vanguard of the Industrial Corps has been utterly routed. Xiang now faces utter defeat at the front and treachery in the rear. Demoralised from their many setbacks and, with their vital stronghold of Chongqing lost, the remaining Industrial troops have begun to desert and defect en masse. Meanwhile, Liu Xiang is nowhere to be found, presumably having fled Sichuan like a coward rather than sharing the fate the Industrial Corps soldiers. With only token resistance remaining from this once formidable force, it is only a matter of time before they surrender completely."
 sichuan.68.a: "About time!"

 sichuan.69.t: "Chongqing Under The Officers"
 sichuan.69.d: "In the days following the defeat of Xiang and the defection of Pan Wenhua, Chongqing had been transformed as quickly as the Officer Department had. It'd gone from the fortress of a warlord to a fortress of republicanism, federalism and the Three Principles of Dr. Sun Yat-sen. Whether or not Pan Wenhua himself believes in this is anyone's guess, but he's certainly playing the part and the people of Chongqing hardly seem unhappy that the promises of glory through war are being replaced with promises of prosperity and freedom, at least given that the alternative seemed to be a ruinous conquest at the hands of Yang Sen and his Zhili allies. The Officer Department itself, too, has been transformed. Gone are the days of being a ragtag guerrilla force, as they now receive the finest arms and uniforms that Chongqing's manufactories can produce. They're still the same revolutionary army in spirit, only this time they look the part of a professional force.\n\nThis pact between the revolutionaries and the turncoat in Chongqing is a dire threat, to say the least. Under no circumstances must we let the Kuomintang dogs that we and our Zhili allies fought so hard to contain rise to power. Their ideas are a threat to all of China and they must not be permitted to uproot the very foundations of our civilisation. Orders have already gone out to our officers to begin our final push against the enemy. We'll take them down and bring peace and order to Sichuan at long last!"
 sichuan.69.a: "We beat them before and we'll do it again!"

 sichuan.70.t: "Clashes in Ziliujing"
 sichuan.70.d: "When Chongqing was treacherously handed over to the Kuomintang, the entire situation changed overnight. All is not lost, however, as the two forces have yet to link up. Our situation may be dire, but we still have a good chance to win. United, they're a potent force. Alone, it's ragtag guerrillas and conscripts against our veteran army, exhausted as it may be. We must use this opportunity to strike while they're still divided. While we've only seen small skirmishes in the area so far, a big battle between the three forces is inevitable.\n\nWe have to make sure it's on our terms.\n\nOur forces are led by the capable Wang Lingji, a proven veteran of the war whose experience and tactical expertise should make up for the spent state of our army. The forces he commands are mostly veterans with several victories to their credit and a fair amount of heavy equipment still intact. Our enemies are the a force of equally veteran, but poorly equipped, Kuomintang irregulars led by the cunning Liu Bocheng, to be reinforced by Pan Wenhua's Chongqing forces. All other things considered, both are proven military leaders and should not be underestimated. Where the battle takes place is of our choosing - the area around Ziliujing is a mix of hills and plains with plenty of forests. After carefully considering all these facts and weighing his options, Wang Lingji decides to..."
 sichuan.70.a: "... seize Ziliujing and use it as a strong point."
 sichuan.70.b: "... attack Pan Wenhua's forces before they reach Bocheng."
 sichuan.70.c: "... feign an attack, then withdraw to flush out the KMT."

 SZC_ziliujing_defense: "§lZiliujing is likely to be the point where the enemy intends to link up before heading to Chengdu. We'll take the city and turn it into a defensive strongpoint. They'll have to take the city to link up, or expose their flanks to our inevitable attack from this position.§!"
 SZC_ziliujing_attack_wenhua: "§lThe KMT is likely holed up in the hills and forests in the basin. Attacking them head-on would be time-consuming, costly and uncertain. We should instead attack the marching Chongqing garrison and decimate them before they can link up with their new KMT allies.§!"
 SZC_ziliujing_feign_withdraw: "§gThe guerrillas won't come out of their hiding places unless they think they have the upper hand. We'll use deceit to lure them out and then have them fight us on open ground where our superior firepower and numbers can actually play a role.§!"

 sichuan.71.t.pincer: "The Tongnan Pincer"
 sichuan.71.d.pincer: "Deeming the Chongqing force to be the easier foe to best on its own, Wang Lingji ordered his tired but determined forces eastwards to strike at them first, hoping to crush them before they could link up with the battle-hardened Kuomintang guerrillas. While not a pushover by any estimate, it's still a fact that Liu Xiang's military defeats had spent most of the Industrial Corps' best soldiers and equipment. What was left were reservists and conscripts that had weren't as well-trained as the regular army, particularly in the use of heavy equipment. The fate of this gamble would be decided outside of Tongnan, a town northwest of Chongqing.\n\nWhen the two armies made contact, Wang Lingji was surprised to learn that his opponents were not marching in the open, but had been able to create makeshift defences outside of the old city. While hardly a formidable chain of defences, the Chongqing reserve had still been able to dig fresh trenches overnight. Rather than being greeted by the confusion of ambushed marching columns, our troops were greeted by the artillery of Pan Wenhua's soldiers. It quickly dawned on Lingji that the guerrillas, with their extensive knowledge of the region, had been able to inform their new allies of the Armament Department's latest offensive. The greatest concern, of course, weren't the makeshift defences, but rather the realisation that Bocheng knew of his plans as well.\n\nChoosing between a humbling retreat and a fast assault, Lingji opted for the latter, knowing that the former would likely put him in an even worse position and doom Chengdu. With little time to prepare, he had his forces deploy and set out against their enemies. Although they were caught off-guard, their veterancy showed as they acted with a skill and courage that their opponents couldn't match, but were nonetheless facing a steep uphill struggle. As day turned into night, Pan Wenhua's defences were battered but not beaten. Worse yet, nightfall marked the arrival of Liu Bocheng and his soldiers, only making their presence known as they rushed up against the flanks of the exhausted Armament Department forces. This was the final straw and the army broke soon thereafter, surrendering in droves to the sudden and relentless attack on their rear.\n\nWang Lingji's whereabouts are currently unknown and the roads to Chengdu have been blown wide open. We fear for the worst."
 sichuan.71.a.pincer: "This is a catastrophe!"

 sichuan.71.t.stalemate: "Stalemate in Ziliujing"
 sichuan.71.d.stalemate: "As expected, the capture of Ziliujing itself was the easy part and holding it wouldn't be a significant challenge either. In doing so and relying on a mix of static and elastic defences against what turned out to be a very mobile and aggressive force, however, the clash around Ziliujing soon turned into a cage for its conquerors.\n\nRather than taking the bait, the Kuomintang guerrillas knew that attacking such an obvious strongpoint would be a disaster and would rely on their usual harassment tactics instead. In choosing to rely on a strong defence rather than a mobile offence, the Armament Department ceded the initiative to their enemies. After a few days of sporadic fighting with light losses on both sides, Pan Wenhua's Chongqing reserve arrived to relieve Bocheng's forces. Now, the hardened guerrillas were backed up by the remaining might of the Industrial Corps with its heavy equipment. The fort thus became a trap as the artillery of the Industrial Corps was now being guided by the superior local knowledge of the Kuomintang, restricting its movements. While the city itself was safe due to neither side wanting to risk the lives of its inhabitants, any attempt to move out would lead to large losses for Wang's forces. While portions of Pan Wenhua's and Liu Bocheng's forces remain committed in Ziliujing, a large detachment is moving towards Chengdu on the now open road, recruiting resentful civilians and deserters from Xiang's old army alike as they go. With every step they take, they grow stronger while we weaken behind our walls.\n\nDespite Wang's forces being tied down, he's already making plans for a safe withdrawal and should be able to make it out with most of his forces intact. The bad news is, by the time he does it's doubtful whether there's still a Chengdu for him to relieve."
 sichuan.71.a.stalemate: "His army may be safe. Chengdu is not..."

 sichuan.72.t: "The Fall of Chengdu"
 sichuan.72.d: "After numerous battles, a costly siege and being called upon to aid in the attack on Ziliujing, Chengdu's garrison was a shadow of what it once was. Unwilling to endure another siege with absolutely no hope of relief, the garrison simply raised a white flag over the city's main gates rather than subjecting the city's people and historical legacy to needless death and destruction. Though the mighty walls of the Qing remain unbroken, the same can't be said for the will to fight among those behind them. Chengdu now flies the Kuomintang and Federalist flags and its surrender marks the end of Sichuan's bloodiest civil war yet. The victorious forces rejoice, celebrating in the mostly empty streets of the ancient city. Its inhabitants remain indoors and at this point most are just relieved that the war is over.\n\nA silver lining, at least, is that the decision to surrender swiftly has spared the ancient city from any looting and plundering by victors."
 sichuan.72.a: "The Officers have returned."

 sichuan.73.t: "Clash of Two Minds"
 sichuan.73.d: "In the past, when fighting the guerrillas, they'd fought from the hills and forests. This was their territory and any attack directly into their areas where they would defend on their terms would be suicide. Knowing this, Wang Lingji knew that he'd have to draw out Liu Bocheng's forces into an open attack. Bocheng was no fool; he'd proven his tactical acumen many times over. He was famous for seizing opportunities presented to him and attacking aggressively from positions of strength and Lingji aimed to use this trait against him.\n\nThe plan was risky and he knew that sacrifices would be unavoidable. His main force was to remain concentrated in the rear, with a few forward detachments being sent out as bait for the KMT to take. Throughout the morning they made probing attacks against their enemies with sporadic attacks in the hills and forests. While unsuccessful at first, eventually Liu Bocheng decided that these forward forces were likely to be the only Armament Department forces in the area, as they had received no reinforcements, nor withdrawn and reported the KMT activities. Once the guerrillas switched tactics to Liu Bocheng's famous frontal infantry assaults, they were quick to withdraw as overwhelming numbers headed their way. Losses weren't light, but enough of them managed to return to friendly lines. Believing that he'd broken the enemy like he had on so many other occasions, Bocheng decided to press the perceived advantage and keep up the attack.\n\nClose to noon, the KMT forces caught up with the retreating forces, but were hammered by the artillery and machine gun emplacements that the Armament Department had set up. The trap had sprung, but now they had the unenviable task of trying to defeat a revolutionary force led by a noted war hero. Bocheng's forces lacked heavy equipment, but they were still a formidable force. They threw themselves at the enemy positions, only to be cut down. By the end of the first day the KMT withdrew hoping to draw the enemy out into a more favourable position. When Wang Lingji held his forces in place rather than falling for his own trick, the assaults continued well into the next day. All the while, the Chengdu forces failed to provide support as their heavy equipment meant that it'd be at least half a week before they could make contact with the two fighting generals.\n\nAfter days of fighting, Liu Bocheng had taken crippling losses and been forced to withdraw to regroup and recover his losses. Once Pan Wenhua received word that the force he was supposed to link up with was beaten in battle, he decided to turn around back towards Chongqing. The gambit was costly, but it'd won the day for the Armament Department. The road to Chongqing was now open."
 sichuan.73.a: "A dangerous gamble has won the day."

 sichuan.74.t: "The Fall of Chongqing"
 sichuan.74.d: "Following the end of the siege of Chengdu, the heart of the former Industrial Corps is now being overrun by our determined soldiers. Despite being heavily depleted from the brutal civil war, the ancient city's small garrison under command of Pan Wenhua offered stiff - albeit futile - resistance as the Armament Department cleared them out street by street in the days that followed. After several days of fighting, the Upper City finally fell and with it the city's industries. The fighting did, however, leave parts of the city in ruins, including many of its factories and critical infrastructure. Once the dust settled Pan Wenhua was nowhere to be found, most likely either killed in the battle or long gone.\n\nWith any hopes of victory lost, along with their only ally, most of the remaining Officer Department troops have begun to desert or surrender, except for small pockets of die-hard KMT guerrillas in the countryside. The war is over and Yang Sen has retained control of Sichuan."
 sichuan.74.a: "We are victorious."

 sichuan.75.t: "Chongqing Under Assault"
 sichuan.75.d: "The war had started to take a toll on Yang Sen's forces. As they approached Chongqing, the veterans of this force were both eager to finally stand at the brink of victory, but also well-aware of the fact that they were about to take on the difficult task that laid ahead. They were to seize not only the enemy's final stronghold, but also take on one of China's major industrial hubs. A battle for this city would surely be difficult as each of the mighty factories of the city could easily be turned into a fortress for any defender.\n\nWhile time is of the essence, a head-on assault is a very difficult task. The hilly areas around the city could provide us with excellent positions for spotting and to place our artillery, giving us a tremendous strategic advantage going in. Some commanders on the ground are suggesting that the time it would take to secure those positions to take advantage of them is time that we simply do not have, preferring a swift assault against the battered remnants of the Industrial Corps instead."
 sichuan.75.a: "Take up positions in the hills before attacking."
 sichuan.75.b: "Assault the city, we have little time!"

 SZC_chongqing_hills: "§gOur officers on the ground are insisting that we should take the hills and use them to our advantage. It could save a lot of lives and provide a big strategic advantage in the battle ahead, both against Chongqing and our pursuers. It is, however, time-consuming and will spread our forces thin.§!"
 SZC_chongqing_assault: "§POur generals are insisting that they have the numbers to take the city in a head-on assault. With every minute wasted allowing the enemy to entrench further while a second army approaches their flanks, this call for an all-out assault is hardly without merit.§!"

 sichuan.76.t: "Defeat in Chongqing"
 sichuan.76.d: "Faced with only difficult options, a direct assault against the under-equipped garrison seemed like the most likely to succeed. Wasting no time, the forces charged under cover of artillery fire as they stormed the trenches surrounding the city. After hours of fighting, the Armament Department had seized these positions, albeit at a heavy cost in lives. The rushed deployment also meant that the inaccurate artillery had a fairly limited effect on the field. Worse yet, once the trenches were taken it was clear that Pan Wenhua had managed to gradually withdraw his forces as the attackers made progress. He was gambling for an effective delaying operation, and it was working.\n\nAs running into the city at night would be a disorganised suicide, the Armament Department could only wait in the ancient city's outskirts for daybreak while Pan Wenhua rushed to prepare new defences inside the city itself and have the civilians evacuate towards the inner sections of Chongqing. Once daybreak came, every factory and every government facility had been turned into a makeshift fort. Progress was slow, and the Armament Department soon became bogged down in street fighting. After a second night with little progress, the situation grew desperate as the enemy's reinforcement were rapidly approaching. Knowing that they'd be destroyed if caught between the two armies, the next day saw no fighting. Instead, a few soldiers were sent with a white flag to discuss their surrender. It was accepted by Pan Wenhua shortly thereafter, ending the brief battle for Chongqing with a catastrophe for the Armament Department.\n\nIn the end, the attacking force became prisoners of war and with some of the most experienced soldiers wiped from their order of battle, it's now very unlikely for the Armament Department to be able to recover. Already word of this defeat is spreading among the people, despite the best effort of the censors in Chengdu. To say that their will to resist Xiang has diminished would be an understatement."
 sichuan.76.a: "It's all over now..."

 sichuan.77.t: "The Fall of Chongqing"
 sichuan.77.d: "Moving in at night, the hills were taken with relative ease. The Chongqing garrison had evidently focused its defences on the city itself in an all-or-nothing approach, likely because Pan Wenhua hardly has soldiers to spare either. Before dawn, our engineers had established positions on the hills followed by the arrival of light artillery and observers under the cover of darkness. Once daybreak came, our soldiers were able to launch their assault on the city with the enemy forces still far behind them. Their charge was initiated by a barrage that was as accurate as it was devastating against the entrenchments of the defenders, and soon the fighting for the city itself raged.\n\nDespite the odds, the heart of the Industrial Corps was soon being overrun by Yang's forces. In the hours that followed, the ancient city's small garrison offered disorganised resistance as the Armament Department cleared them out street by street. The swiftness of the assault and ferocity of the bombardment had crushed Wenhua's plans of gradually falling back into the city, and now his forces were being mopped up at a rapid pace. Before long, the city and its mighty industries finally fell. The fighting did, however, leave parts of the city in ruins, including many of its factories and critical infrastructure. Once the dust settled, Pan Wenhua was nowhere to be found. He's presumed to either killed in the battle for the city, or having fled long ago.\n\nThe city had fallen so quickly that the Industrial Army sent to relieve it had no idea of its fate. Thus, they were greeted by shelling from the mountains and fire from the city's outskirts as they approached. Realising quickly they were too late as they saw the banners of the Armament Department flying over the city, they were quick to raise a white flag. Their surrender was accepted without further bloodshed, and their capture now means that the Industrial Corps is no longer a factor. Victory is ours!"
 sichuan.77.a: "A great victory!"

 sichuan.78.t: "The Industrial Corps Begins to Disintegrate"
 sichuan.78.d: "Xiang gambled big on a quick victory and lost it all. Overstretched, exposed and exhausted from weeks of fighting with little regard for losses, the vanguard of the Industrial Corps has been utterly routed. Xiang now faces utter defeat at the front and treachery in the rear. Demoralised from their many setbacks and with their vital stronghold of Chongqing lost, the Industrial Corps troops have begun to throw away their guns and uniforms, hoping to escape into the countryside as civilians. With only token resistance remaining from this once formidable force, it is only a matter of time before they surrender completely."
 sichuan.78.a: "About time!"

 sichuan.79.t: "Liu Xiang Escapes"
 sichuan.79.d: "Reports are coming in from Chongqing that Liu Xiang has abandoned his own soldiers and fled Sichuan. With the head of the snake cut off, what little remained of the Industrial Corps has ceased all resistance, utterly unwilling to fight for the man who hung them out to dry. The war is over and Yang Sen has retained control of Sichuan."
 sichuan.79.a: "We are victorious."

 sichuan.80.t: "Defeat in Detail"
 sichuan.80.d: "In a daring all-or-nothing gamble, we split the bulk of our remaining army south of Chengdu and had them attack the cities of Jianyang and Chongqing at once. With most of the Industrial Corps tied down in a lengthy siege, our armies could attack in both locations and still outnumber the overstretched enemy. Two large armies on the march are impossible to conceal, however, and neither force would ever reach their destinations before word of our intentions reached the enemy.\n\nSeizing the initiative, Liu Xiang was quick to divert his forces at once, leaving behind a token force to make sure that the Chengdu garrison remains tied down. As our plan hinged on the enemy being committed to the siege, the moment Xiang's forces were on the move our forces were fighting time itself as fiercely as they were fighting scouts and local militias from the Industrial Corps. They were, however, oblivious to this fact before it was too late. The infrastructure in Sichuan was poor before the war and by this point our army was marching through broken roads with radio communications being all but non-existent. The two armies didn't realise they were being chased before Liu Xiang's forces attacked them from behind.\n\nThe plan had no room for error and once the two halves of the army were attacked in their rears and flanks any semblance of cohesion quickly broke down as they scrambled to assume defensive positions. It was only the tactical skills of Wang Lingji that saved the day, miraculously rallying the troops and fending off the first wave of attackers, buying time and allowing the two halves of our army to link up and re-group near the Yangtze. The losses on his side had been crippling, however, and he'd barely been able to begin entrenching before the final nail in the coffin was hammered in with the arrival of the Chongqing garrison's forces under the capable command of Pan Wenhua. Hopelessly outnumbered, attacked on all sides and without any chance of survival, Wang Lingji surrendered to the Industrial Corps rather than dooming them all to an early grave. The battle has been lost and with it likely the war as well."
 sichuan.80.a: "We have gambled and consequently failed."

 sichuan.81.t.battle: "The Surrender of Chengdu"
 sichuan.81.d.battle: "Over the past few days nothing but bad news had reached the commanders in Chengdu and even with the army's censorship it was clear to everyone within the city that things were not going well beyond those tall walls. As the increasingly meagre rations were being handed out around noon, the city's lookouts were treated to an unpleasant surprise.\n\nMarching towards the city were thousands of soldiers wearing the uniforms of the Armament Department, followed closely by the forces of the Industrial Corps. The bulk of this force stopped not far from the city's walls, with only a flatbed truck narrowing the gap between the besieging army and the city's walls. The truck wasn't loaded with enemy troops or bombs, but instead the vehicle was full of high-ranking officers from the Armament Department. One officer picked up a megaphone with shaky hands and as the man's identity dawned on the garrison, he started to address the soldiers manning the walls. Wang Lingji told them that they were all that remained of the relief force, that their armies were broken and that their so-called leaders had fled to the Qing. But have no fear, he insisted, because Liu Xiang had been gracious enough to spare both them and the city if they surrendered.\n\nThe answer didn't let itself wait for too long. The commanders in charge of the garrison knew that with morale being as low as it was, once news got out that the entire Armament Department army had been crushed he'd surely have an insurrection on his hands. The tall walls of Chengdu still stood and the siege ended not with a bang, but with a white flag being raised above the now open city gates."
 sichuan.81.t.sapped: "The Fall of Chengdu"
 sichuan.81.d.sapped: "As the days went on, with no relief reaching the city, Xiang's engineers were slowly but surely able to map out the weak points of the Qing-era defences around the city. Every night they toiled to dig beneath the city's walls and plant explosives in key locations. Just over a month into the siege, these explosively finally went off before the sun had risen. The massive explosions quickly caused large breaches in the walls, with the falling debris blocking some of the Dujiangyan levees that surrounded the city. In an instant, the walls that had stood for so long crumbled like dust with dozens of the city's defenders passing away in the initial explosions. This marked the final assault on Chengdu and it'd be a long and difficult battle for the large city.\n\nDespite the collapse of the walls and the capture of the East Gate, the garrison still put up stiff resistance against the attacking forces. Putting their knowledge of the city's layout to good use, the defences that the Chengdu garrison and drafted civilians had built within the city proved difficult to overcome even for the massively superior attacking force. Wherever they went, they were greeted by machine guns, snipers, mines and ambushing infantry. Though the garrison fought valiantly, it was all for naught. By the end of the first day, a sort of calm was brought in by the night with a third of the city having fallen. The Industrial Corps regrouped and in the morning they attacked the city's centre. Low on men and ammunition though, the half-starved defenders could only hold out for a few hours before they were forced to surrender the city hall to the advancing Industrial Corps. This marked the complete collapse of the city's defence with any remaining forces quickly surrendering. By the evening, Chengdu finally fell silent, a silence that would soon be broken by the cheers of the victorious Industrial Corps and its soldiers.\n\nAlthough he'd paid a high price for it, Liu Xiang's gamble for control over Sichuan had paid off."
 sichuan.81.a: "An end to the war."

 sichuan.82.t: "Mobilising the Xikang Troops"
 sichuan.82.d: "Although Chengdu is now under Baoding control, the fate of the war itself still hangs in the balance and the Baoding Department must work together to prevail. General Deng Xihou is well aware of this and has sent a general mobilisation order to the Baoding troops, down to the last reserves. Our main forces outside the area around Chengdu are the well-trained mountaineer forces under general Liu Wenhui's command, currently based in the western region of Xikang. He has received a letter from Xihou, which tells him to..."
 sichuan.82.a: "... reinforce the garrison in Chengdu."
 sichuan.82.b: "... move east towards Luzhou and Chongqing."

 SZC_xikang_troops_jianyang: "§WSending the troops towards Jianyang would allow us to cut off Xiang's supply lines from Chongqing, but it is also an obvious move. If he manages to anticipate our plan, he will surely attempt to stop our forces from reaching each other.§!"
 SZC_xikang_troops_chongqing: "§WWith Xiang's forces concentrated around Chengdu, the southern region of Sichuan along the Yangtze River should be lightly defended. A mobile offensive following the river towards the crossing at Luzhou should be able to overwhelm any resistance and reach Chongqing, but Xiang will eventually deduce what we are truly planning. If our forces are not strong enough to quickly capture Chongqing, we risk being caught in a pincer movement and encircled.§!"

 sichuan.83.t: "Guanxian Under Heavy Attack"
 sichuan.83.d: "Liu Xiang has a history of cunning boldness and this time it is no different. He appears to have correctly deduced our planned troop movements and has ordered a detachment of his forces currently besieging Chengdu to move towards Deng Xihou's former capital in Guanxian, to the north of Chengdu, now commanded by his loyal subordinate Wang Zuanxu. It is imperative that the city does not fall, lest our forces be cut into two separate groups and face the same fate as Yang Sen's forces did earlier in the war. Faced with a difficult decision, general Zuanxu ultimately chooses to..."
 sichuan.83.a: "... prepare an attack on the enemy camps, in the dark of night."
 sichuan.83.b: "... entrench and fortify the positions around the Er Wang Temple."
 sichuan.83.c: "... block the Baopingkou Channel, diverting its flow into the enemy camps."

 SZC_guanxian_night_attack_text: "Rather than face the full force of Xiang's army on terms of his choosing, we can negate the enemy's advantage in numbers with a well-planned night attack against their encampments around Guanxian. It'll cause disarray among their ranks and blunt any future attacks.§!"

 SZC_guanxian_flood_baopingkou: "§cWith the enemy's advantage in numbers and firepower, some commanders are suggesting that our opening barrage should not be with guns, but to instead have the channel's water sweep away their positions before we attack. The flooding risks, however, damaging the surrounding areas.§!"

 sichuan.84.t.victory: "The Defence of Guanxian"
 sichuan.84.d.victory: "Wang Zuanxu had little time to prepare and even less to manoeuvre - though that did not seem to alarm the sometimes rash commander. Believing that a cunning offence would be the best defence, he had planned for a string of night-time attacks against the enemy, with our forces' eventual withdrawal being backed by artillery barrages against the enemy's encampments. After forcing Xiang's hand in a state of disarray, the first waves of his forces would be smashed by a mix of rear-guard actions and defensive artillery, with a series of infantry counter-attacks aimed at breaking up the exhausted attackers and force the Industrial Corps to retreat.\n\nAlthough the night-time raid was a success that disrupted Xiang's planned offensive, the battle for Guanxian itself would rage on for days. Most plans do not survive first contact with the enemy and this did not either. Both Xiang and Zuanxu's forces had their successes and setbacks as ground around the city was traded between the two. Wang Zuanxu's penchant for quick decisions meant, however, that any breakthrough made by Xiang was swiftly met by a counter-attack or artillery barrage. After three days of fighting, his forces had been badly damaged, but the Industrial Corps were also badly bloodied to the point where they called off any further attacks, opting instead to regroup to fight again another day. Though the battle may be recorded as a draw by the history books, it's a strategic victory that has prevented our enemy from advancing to the south against Liu Wenhui."
 sichuan.84.t.flood: "The Baopingkou Floods"
 sichuan.84.d.flood: "At the orders of Wang Zuanxu, military engineers set out to not build defences, but to block the Baopingkou Channel in a way that'd cause a controlled flooding, one that wouldn't affect the Baoding positions and causes as little civilian damage as possible. The goal was to flood Xiang's forces and turn their encampments into a swamp. The military engineers worked hard to make sure that the damages to the Dujiangyan systems and the surrounding areas would be limited. Realising that they were short on time however, they could only hope to mitigate the destruction at best.\n\nOnce the preparations were made, the channels were blockaded with wooden slabs and from there it didn't take long for the surrounding levees to overflow away from their determined paths, straight into the encampments of the Industrial Corps. Many soldiers were rudely awakened as their tents offered absolutely no protection against the rising waters that slowly turned the grounds into a soggy swampland. Cases of guns were drenched and the ground that many artillery pieces stood upon quickly turned into a soft mud that slowly swallowed the larger guns. A hasty retreat followed with the troops trying to save as much of their equipment as possible from the rising water. Needless to say, their abandoned equipment and positions are as useless to us as it is to them, but they certainly won't be able to mount an offensive now.\n\nAlthough a military victory, reports are coming in that despite our best efforts the damage to the Dujiangyan system has been considerable and that the floods have washed away many nearby crops. However, we have won the initiative in this war without losing a single soldier. Let's hope the risk was worth it."
 sichuan.84.a: "They shall not pass!"

 sichuan.85.t: "Guanxian Defences Collapse"
 sichuan.85.d: "Despite the strong defences set up by Wang Zuanxu and various rear-guard actions taken against the enemy, the overwhelming numbers of the enemy and the strategic skills of Liu Xiang proved too much for our forces to handle. Although the Industrial Corps paid a heavy price for their victory thanks in no small part to the many artillery kill zones set up beforehand, by the third day they'd broken through the defences through a mix of ruthless aggressiveness and discipline. A series of counter-attacks were mounted in an attempt to retake our defensive positions, but it was all for naught in the end and the banner of the Industrial Corps soon flew over the Er Wang Temple.\n\nHumbled by this defeat, the Baoding troops were forced to retreat further and further west. While a last-ditch defence of the Dujiangyan crossings has prevented a rout and allowed most troops to escape to Pixian to the southeast, our troops are now spread out defending the levees and will not be unable to reach Chengdu or Meishan in time to join Liu Wenhui's forces. They're now on their own and must do their best to defend against the Industrial Corps' southward thrust."
 #sichuan.85.d.insubordination: "Desperate times call for desperate measures, so it was decided earlier in the war to hire local bandits to do our fighting for us. As our losses throughout the war have mounted, we've been forced to rely more and more upon them to replenish our ranks. This isn't terribly uncommon for warlords in China, though it's undeniable that these men aren't ideal troops. More often than not, they're ill-disciplined and can barely grasp military tactics. They often act like a mob - nonetheless, a mob of ruthless, heavily armed men. Only motivated by the prospect of gold and amnesty for past crimes however, their loyalty was always in doubt. Today, we've been made to pay dearly for relying on them.\n\nBefore the battle and contrary to how we'd operate under ideal circumstances, many bandits had been deployed with our forces at the front, even outnumbering our regular soldiers in a lot of key areas. As Xiang's forces advanced and the sheer overwhelming size of the assault dawned on them, many of these conscripted criminals simply deserted or refused to follow orders. With our reliance on them being as great as it was at this point, we simply weren't able to have our officers force them to stand and fight. Despite fierce resistance by the remaining loyal regiments, the Baoding troops were forced to retreat further and further west due to the betrayal in the ranks.\n\nWhile a last-ditch defence of the Dujiangyan crossings has prevented a rout and allowed most troops to escape to Pixian to the southeast, our troops are now spread out defending the levees and will not be unable to reach Chengdu or Meishan in time to join Liu Wenhui's forces. They're now on their own and must do their best to defend against the Industrial Corps' southward thrust."
 sichuan.85.a: "Good, but bad."
 sichuan.85.b: "Damned traitors!"

 sichuan.86.t: "Reckoning in Meishan"
 sichuan.86.d.success: "With our success in Guanxian preventing the Industrial Corps from moving to the south as planned, Liu Wenhui's troops were able to reach Meishan without further interference by Industrial forces. They are currently crossing the Min River to link up with the main force in Chengdu and Deng's triumphant reserves in Guanxian. With our armies finally linked up, we'll be able to finally bring an end to the traitor Liu Xiang and end this war."
 sichuan.86.d.failure: "With the collapse of our positions around Guanxian despite our valiant efforts, the Industrial's northern flank is now secure. Wasting no time, Liu Xiang has ordered his triumphant forces to advance south-west towards the Min River crossings. The arriving Xikang forces find themselves facing an entrenched enemy across one of Sichuan's larger rivers and unwilling to throw away his soldiers in a futile attack, Liu Wenhui has halted the planned offensive.\n\nBoth camps eye each other across the river, with only sporadic skirmishes and sniper fire being exchanged between the two sides. Both consider a river crossing to be suicide, a fact that spells doom for us and success for our foes. With any attempt at relief being halted at the river, Chengdu has been cut off. We can only pray that its defenders pull off a miracle."
 sichuan.86.a: "Finally!"
 sichuan.86.b: "It's all over now..."

 sichuan.87.t: "The Battle of Longquanyi"
 sichuan.87.d: "Xiang knew that he was making a risky gamble when he laid siege to Chengdu, but he is still a skilled enough general to see a trap coming. He began to take measures to fortify his now exposed positions. Short of breaking the siege and retreating to Chongqing, this is the only card he was able to play and our commanders were well-aware of this fact. The resulting simultaneous movements led to both forces trying to outmanoeuvre each other, eventually leading to them crashing into each other in the village of Longquanyi, southeast of Chengdu.\n\nWhat started out as a small skirmish between scout detachments soon escalated into a full-blown battle. While Xiang had the upper hand initially thanks to his own skill and his vast numbers, a determined defence of the countryside and the good coordination between our commanders allowed our reinforcements from Chengdu and Guanxian to arrive in time to reinforce our positions and deal a decisive blow to the enemy forces. With the bulk of his forces broken, the only cohesive force that remains of the once mighty Industrial Corps outside of Chongqing is the token besieging force left around Chengdu, now trapped between our vast armies and the walls of the city. Rumour has it that the Industrial Corps' organisation has begun falling apart after this devastating defeat."
 sichuan.87.a: "This is the end for you, Xiang!"

 sichuan.88.t: "Liu Xiang Disappears"
 sichuan.88.d: "It seems that Xiang's luck finally ran out. After the debacle in Longquanyi and the severe defeat his forces suffered there, the once mighty warlord of Chongqing has seemingly vanished. It is unknown at this point if he died in the field, or simply fled from Sichuan altogether once his defeat became inevitable. Whatever the case may be, the fact that he's gone has sent shockwaves throughout the region, not least among the ranks of his army, now a demoralised shell of its former self."
 sichuan.88.a: "A fitting end."

 sichuan.89.t: "Pan Wenhua's Betrayal"
 sichuan.89.d: "Despite the Industrial Corps' main force falling into disarray following the disappearance of Liu Xiang, the Chongqing garrison remained a formidable force. Under the capable command of Xiang's second-in-command, the mayor of Chongqing, Pan Wenhua, it numbered in the thousands and was being directly resupplied every day by the city's large factories. It was clear that if there ware to be a fight for the city, it'd be long and hard-fought, even with Liu Xiang out of the picture. When word reached us that forward detachments from the Officer Department were marching towards the city, our commanders were relieved. Surely expecting the Industrial Corps to not put up a fight, the Officers would march into a death trap as they neared the city.\n\nIn an unexpected turn of events, this was not meant to be.\n\nInstead of being greeted with bullets and bombs from the city's defences, they were greeted with open arms as the banner of the Industrial Corps flying over the city was quickly exchanged for the colours of the Kuomintang and of the Federalists. Pan Wenhua declared his loyalty to the cause of the revolutionary army. This was apparently not just the cowardly act of an opportunistic turncoat, but an act of planned deceitful and treachery. Not only had Pan Wenhua coordinated this with Lü Chao and Xiong Kewu of the Officer Department, but it became clear that he's likely been in contact with major KMT figures like Song Qingling and Lin Biao for a very long time.\n\nChongqing's considerable industrial output has effectively been given to the Officer's Department as a wrapped gift, all right under our noses.\n\nThis is dire news indeed and it has effectively changed the entire situation on the ground in an instant."
 sichuan.89.a: "Wait, what?"

 sichuan.90.t: "Chongqing Under The Officers"
 sichuan.90.d: "In the days following the disappearance of Xiang and the defection of Pan Wenhua, Chongqing had been transformed as quickly as the Officer Department had. It'd gone from the fortress of a warlord to a fortress of republicanism, federalism and the Three Principles of Dr. Sun Yat-sen. Whether or not Pan Wenhua himself believes in this is anyone's guess, but he's certainly playing the part and the people of Chongqing hardly seem unhappy that the promises of glory through war are being replaced with promises of prosperity and freedom, at least given that the alternative seemed to an invasion by Baoding Department forces. The Officer Department itself, too, has been transformed. Gone are the days of being a rugged guerrilla force as they now receive the finest arms and uniforms that Chongqing's manufactories can produce. They're still the same revolutionary army in spirit, only this time they look the part of a professional force.\n\nThis could be a dire threat, but it may not have to be that way. Many members of the Officer Department, from the soldiers to its generals, are not inherently hostile to the Baoding Department. With the regime of Yang Sen gone and what little was left of Liu Xiang's forces having abandoned his foolish ambitions for domination by force, many on both sides are speaking openly of the possibility of a peaceful end to the conflict."
 sichuan.90.a: "Maybe we can solve this without more bloodshed."

 sichuan.91.t: "An Offer From An Old Friend"
 sichuan.91.d: "After the devastation wrought by Liu Xiang and the Armament Department in Sichuan, much of the country bears deep scars from the conflict. With both instigators of hostilities out of the picture, neither of the remaining parties were willing to continue this bloody war that they didn't start and never intended to fight, especially not against each other.\n\nIn light of this, a meeting between the leaders of the Baoding and Officer factions was arranged. Xiong Kewu, speaking on behalf of the Officers, was quick to offer an olive branch to his old friend Deng Xihou, who he long ago counted as a subordinate, more than willing to work together for the betterment of the province. If Pan Wenhua could see reason and choose cooperation over war, then surely we could work together as well."
 sichuan.91.a: "Yes, let's end this war."

 sichuan.92.t: "The Race for Chongqing"
 sichuan.92.d: "After the last battle, time is of the essence. With little time to spare and no room for error, Liu Wenhui is scrambling his forces for a quick and decisive strike against Chongqing. Keeping a force of this size concealed for long was going to be impossible and it was only a matter of time before the cunning Liu Xiang would be on their trail again."
 sichuan.92.a: "Get moving!"

 sichuan.93.t: "The Officer Department"
 sichuan.93.d: "After the war with Yunnan, the Officer Department had been reduced to a sorry state, a small, if resilient, guerrilla force, dependent on Tang Jiyao's regime for support. Because of the war, however, their fortunes have changed drastically. With Yang Sen and Liu Xiang destroying each others' forces, the Officer Department began to rise in strength to fill the vacuum created in the wake of the civil war, both by attracting defectors from the armies, but also by propagating skilled propaganda against the \"bloody warlords\". As Baoding entered the war after the collapse of Yang Sen's regime, it was only a matter of time before the two factions met in the south of the country. However, this needed not have be a hostile encounter between enemies, but perhaps a chance for cooperation instead.\n\nAs fate would have it, one of the leaders of the Officer Department, Xiong Kewu, is an old friend of Liu Wenhui. He has made him an offer: They'll fight for Baoding, in exchange for working together later. Although joining forces with our old friends would have great benefits for both of us, some of our generals and other high ranking officers are weary of the stability of an alliance with what up until now has been a rag-tag militia of radicals, dependent on Yunnanese aid."
 sichuan.93.a: "Yes, we can work together."
 sichuan.93.b: "No, they can't be trusted."

 sichuan.94.t: "The Baoding-Officer Alliance"
 sichuan.94.d: "Rather than fighting each other, we've decided to unite against our common enemy Liu Xiang and the Industrial Corps. Albeit hastily and with little fanfare, the Baoding and Officer factions are now united in a common struggle. Already, our forces are cooperating together while our commanders have begun to plan our next joint move against the enemy."
 sichuan.94.a: "Together against Xiang!"

 sichuan.95.t: "The Combined Offensive"
 sichuan.95.d: "Liu Wenhui has had a bold plan since the start of this war: the capture of Chongqing from under the nose of Liu Xiang while his men are tied down in the siege of Chengdu. A bold and risky move, to be sure, but far more realistic than beating Liu Xiang's massive army in the open.\n\nKeeping an army of this size concealed for long was going to be impossible. It was a matter of when, not if, the Industrial Corps eventually caught on to the machinations of the Baoding army. Predictably, Liu Xiang ordered a detachment of his forces to leave the siege of Chengdu to intercept his uncle's army. This whole plan fell apart among the mountains and rivers of Sichuan, however, as the Industrial troops sent to attack Liu Wenhui's forces fell victim to the constant attacks of the hardy guerrillas of the Officer Department. Ambushes, traps and blocked roads meant that any hope to reinforce Chongqing was utterly futile. Pan Wenhua's city garrison in Chongqing was now on its own as nothing seemed capable of stopping the Baoding force at this point."
 sichuan.95.a: "Now to make their efforts worthwhile."

 sichuan.96.t: "The Fall of Chongqing"
 sichuan.96.d: "Sending the bulk of the Baoding army towards Chongqing was an all-or-nothing gamble, but one where the odds seemed to be in our favour, thanks to our advantageous strategic position. Although Liu Xiang had foreseen this move, he'd not planned for the alliance formed between the Baoding and the Officers.\n\nBe that as it may, Chongqing was still a heavily defended city, being the beating heart of Sichuan's industry. The Baoding commanders are known for their skill and that'd show during this battle. Opting for a methodical approach, Chongqing's defenders were flushed out one street at a time. Despite the size of the city and its garrison, however, the city would not hold out for long. Once Pan Wenhua had learned that Liu Xiang's relief force wasn't going to arrive for at least another week thanks to the continuous attacks by the Officer guerrillas, he swallowed his pride and reached out with an offer of surrender, rather than seeing the city he was mayor of be reduced to rubble."
 sichuan.96.a: "A great victory!"

 sichuan.97.t: "Collapse of the Industrial Corps"
 sichuan.97.d: "Chongqing was a vital stronghold for Xiang's forces, due to city's many factories and the control over the Yangtze River traffic. Cut off from this vital lifeline following Pan Wenhua's surrender, Xiang's troops currently besieging Chengdu have stopped receiving much-needed supplies such as food, ammunition and weapons. Perhaps most dire of all, the soldiers' paychecks have also ceased to arrive with the complete paralysis of Chongqing's administrative functions. Without guns, pay, or even a functional leadership structure, desertion and insubordination has become widespread. The siege of Chengdu has already faltered as most soldiers and officers feel that the war is lost and in the countryside the forces of the Industrial Corps began to melt away as news of the fall of Chongqing reached them. Most simply cast away their rifles and headed back towards their homes, unwilling to fight for a lost cause.\n\nAfter being outmatched in a mutual high-stakes gamble, Xiang has utterly lost control of the situation. Seeing his army disintegrate and unwilling to face justice for his treachery, he has opted to flee north towards the Ma Clique in Xibei along with what remains of his inner circle. Without their capital, without their factories and without their leader, the Industrial Corps has now been utterly defeated. Victory is ours, to share with our new friends in the Officer Department."
 sichuan.97.a: "We stand triumphant."

 sichuan.98.t: "Disaster in Beipei"
 sichuan.98.d: "After rejecting the alliance with the Officer Department, Liu Wenhui marched towards Chongqing, aiming to take the city from his nephew while also fighting against the KMT-aligned guerrillas. Predicting this move, Liu Xiang was able to order a portion of his main force to move to intercept his uncle's advancing army without needing to worry about the Chengdu siege being broken. Thanks in no small part to persistent harassment by the guerrillas, Liu Wenhui's forces were slowed down significantly, allowing elements of Pan Wenhua's reserves from Chongqing to mobilise while Xiang chased the Baoding army. This eventually led to them being caught in a pincer between the two advancing Industrial armies near the city of Beipei, just north of Chongqing. A desperate defence was to follow.\n\nSurrounded and cut off, the Baoding army was in a terrible position. The areas around the city did not provide any good defensive positions, made even worse by a terrible supply situation. Skilled though he may be, Liu Wenhui only had hours to prepare anything resembling a defence. The task presented to him was simply impossible given his own dire situation and the enemy's superiority. The Baoding forces bravely stood their ground, but after less than an hour of actual fighting the makeshift defences had crumbled under the combined assaults mounted by the Industrial Corps. With the permission of Liu Wenhui, the bulk of the soldiers and their officers surrendered soon thereafter, not wanting to cast their lives away for an unwinnable battle."
 sichuan.98.a: "It's all over now..."

 sichuan.99.t: "Liu Wenhui Retreats to Xikang"
 sichuan.99.d: "Part of being a good officer is to realise when you've been beaten and retreat while there's still a chance to save the lives of your soldiers. Though the Beipei catastrophe had marked the end of any effective resistance by the main Baoding army, their defence against the unexpected pincer move had allowed him to escape with a retinue of his closest men. It was a close call and he only narrowly evaded capture first by the advancing Industrial Corps and later by the Kuomintang guerrillas as he fled westward.\n\nWhile he is rallying his remaining forces in the relative safety of Xikang's mountains, Chengdu and its defenders are on their own."
 sichuan.99.a: "At least he made it out in one piece."

 sichuan.100.t: "Deng Xihou Surrenders"
 sichuan.100.d: "As the Industrial Corps' vanguard headed back north to continue their siege of Chengdu in full force, it the Baoding Department has decided to accept the inevitable. With Liu Wenhui's forces defeated, Deng Xihou knows he has no chance to overcome the combined Industrial Corps forces and that continuing the fight would merely cause the needless deaths of his own soldiers and the people behind the walls of Chengdu. As a result, Xihou sent out an emissary to Xiang's field headquarters outside of Chengdu to ask for a ceasefire. Given his poor bargaining position, the only thing he asks in exchange for Chengdu's peaceful transfer over to Xiang is for the safe passage out of Sichuan for Deng and the Baoding leadership. Liu Xiang, knowing that a ruined city and high casualties wouldn't help him unite the country still beset by petty warlords and guerrillas, was quick to accept and honour the deal.\n\nAlthough Chengdu's walls still stand, the gates were opened for the triumphant Industrial Corps. At this point, most citizens of Chengdu are only relieved that the war may be over soon and that they were spared a direct assault."
 sichuan.100.a: "So it ends. Or begins?"

 sichuan.101.t: "Governor Xiao Invades Enshi"
 sichuan.101.d: "The region of Shihe, in Southwestern Hubei, formerly controlled by [SZC.GetNameDef], has been split between de-jure and de-facto governorship ever since the conclusion of fighting in Western China following the Xuantong Restoration. Incensed by this, Hubei Governor Xiao Yaonan has consistently petitioned the Central Government to act, and seize the territory as the rightful lands of Hubei. However, this has never come to fruition, for the Government valued stability and goodwill with Yang Sen rather than instigation.\n\nFollowing the collapse of Qing authority however, the region has been seized by Governor Xiao Yaonan's forces in an independent rogue act. He managed to overwhelm the local [SZC.GetAdjective] garrisons, and has gained a valuable prize for his position within the Zhili clique. The Industrial Corps have been reported to have organised some sort of futile resistance against the Zhili Clique's large army and Sichuan has already sent divisions to try and take back the region, but Xiao Yaonan's forces have been able to fight them off with relative ease so far."
 sichuan.101.a: "He can't defeat an entire clique by himself!"

 sichuan.102.t: "Enshi seized by Zhili Warlord"
 sichuan.102.d: "The region of Shihe, in Southwestern Hubei, formerly controlled by [SZC.GetNameDef], has been split between de-jure and de-facto governorship ever since the conclusion of fighting in Western China following the Xuantong Restoration. Incensed by this, Hubei Governor Xiao Yaonan has consistently petitioned the Central Government to act, and seize the territory as the rightful lands of Hubei. However, this has never come to fruition, for the Government valued stability and goodwill with Yang Sen rather than instigation.\n\nSeeing the opportunity, Xiao Yaonan has invaded southwestern Hubei. Establishing a temporary occupation in the city of Enshi, his forces have routed the local garrisons and are on the move. Divisions have already been sent to the provincial border and heavy fighting has broken out between Liu Xiang's forces and the forces of the Zhili army."
 sichuan.102.a: "Liu Xiang manages to fend the Zhili off!"
 sichuan.102.b: "Liu Xiang's campaign is defeated!"

 sichuan.103.t: "Assault on Enshi"
 sichuan.103.d: "The forces of General Liu Xiang in Shihe have failed their assault on the town of Enshi. With [SZC.GetAdjective] soldiers tired out and outnumbered, a retreat was ordered and the Zhili moved in to re-occupy the lands they had lost in the Industrial Corps offensive. During the [SZC.GetAdjective] retreat, many men were lost on the road as the Zhili made a vicious attack on the retreating forces."
 sichuan.103.a: "A brilliant success Xiao!"

 sichuan.104.t: "The Battle of Enshi"
 sichuan.104.d: "After Liu Xiang's forces successfully flanked and encircled the town of Enshi, the Zhili's presence in Hubei collapsed. Pushing them back to the [QIE.GetAdjective] border, General Liu Xiang was hugely successful in retaking and occupying Hubei. Zhili presence has been mostly wiped out from the region, with small pockets of panicked soldiers trying to make their way back to the main force that was occupying Enshi."
 sichuan.104.a: "You cost us gravely for acting rogue!"

 sichuan.120.t: "Drought?"
 sichuan.120.d: "Just over a decade ago in 1925 a great famine wracked Sichuan province. Hundreds of thousands died and just as many fled the province. Exacerbated by the internecine warfare of that era, the famine was sparked by a long-lasting drought and caused irreparable economic and financial damage to Sichuan. For the last ten years the farmers that survived the drought hurriedly pray whenever the sun stays in the sky for over a week - but it appears their prayers have gone unanswered this year. Rain has not fallen in the province for over a month and many are fearing a return to the catastrophe of 1925..."
 sichuan.120.a: "The rain must come soon..."

 sichuan.121.t: "Transport Links Severed"
 sichuan.121.d: "With fears of a famine already high after the drought refused to let up, many in [SZC.GetLeader]'s inner circle advised stockpiling rice imported down the Yangtze. Now, however, that plan has been cast aside. High tides, caused by unusually large glacial melts in the mountains, prevented any river trade from reaching Chengdu this year and the ongoing chaos in the League has largely cut off all railroad trade from the Legation ports where food is imported to. With Yunnan's government taking more and more overtly hostile action towards us, the only route to a port is through the Liangguang clique. While the route is stable, they aren't exactly close friends of ours and we may be cut off from *any* international trade soon."
 sichuan.121.a: "We need an alternative route, now!"

 sichuan.122.t: "Rice Prices Spike"
 sichuan.122.d: "With imports into our province becoming more and more scarce and public fears of a famine rising with every sunny day, marketplaces across Sichuan have widespread increases in food prices. Already, this has sparked riots and demonstrations from small mountain villages to Chengdu itself. Those who can afford it have started to leave the province, with most heading towards the relative safety of the north."
 sichuan.122.a: "As if the war weren't a large enough problem!"

 sichuan.123.t: "Famine!"
 sichuan.123.d: "Our worst fears have come to pass - the looming threat of famine is now reality. The drought and the unrest in the League cutting off most of our import have created a perfect storm of misery and chaos as former neighbours turn on each other over scraps of food and officials across the province report mass food riots, looting, deaths from starvation. Public order has broken down as policemen become too weak with hunger to stop criminals and refugees stream out of the province through whatever means they can. If rains do not fall soon total anarchy is inevitable."
 sichuan.123.a: "Not again!"

 sichuan.124.t: "Famine Breaks Out in Sichuan"
 sichuan.124.d: "The province of Sichuan has long struggled with famine. Rocky terrain and unpredictable weather kept populations low until the early Qing era, when widespread land clearances and immigration incentives brought hordes of peasants to the province. In 1925 a lengthy drought turned into a devastating famine that ravaged the province, leading to hundreds of thousands of deaths and millions of refugees.\n\nNow, with chaos in the League disrupting food shipments and another lengthy drought the spectre of famine haunts Sichuan once more. Already horrifying stories are emerging of mothers selling their children into slavery for scraps of bread and anarchy gripping even the richest market towns."
 sichuan.124.a: "This year just keeps getting worse!"

 sichuan.125.t: "Rains Return to Sichuan"
 sichuan.125.d: "[SZC.GetLeader] was hunched over his desk desperately writing letter after letter to [GXC.GetLeader] to negotiate importing rice when he heard it. It started as the occasional droplet, but within minutes [SZC.GetLeader] heard the steady drumming of rain on the roof of his building. Scarcely believing it, he ran outside and was almost immediately drenched. Around him his soldiers celebrated and even the normally dour-faced guards to the Governor's mansion were practically dancing with joy.\n\nWhile it will take a while to grow a new crop of food, the rain will help calm down the peasantry and put a stop to the anarchy gripping most of the province."
 sichuan.125.a: "Blessed rain!"

 sichuan.127.t: "The Famine Fades"
 sichuan.127.d: "As more and more of the Sichuanese agricultural sector recovers its productivity, the dark cloud of famine has been steadily receding from the province. More and more farms have begun to increase their output, while the devastation of the civil war continues to fade from public memory. We may never know the full extent of the damage, but even so it certainly appears that we'll soon be able to declare an official end to the famine.\n\nNonetheless, with millions of our citizens dead from this catastrophe, the famine has left an indelible dark mark upon Sichuan, one that will take decades to fully remove. Even now, many areas are still in a limbo of sorts, with the grain supply still unsteady. As our first step, we must work to fully solve the lingering famine pockets."
 sichuan.127.a: "An end to a dark era."

 sichuan.128.t: "Sichuan petitions the Central Government"
 sichuan.128.d.zhili: "As if things couldn't get any worse, the Sichuanese government recently informed us that the drought that has gripped their province for the last month is now a full-blown famine, with social order breaking down as food becomes increasingly scarce. Subsequently, they have petitioned our government for aid. While we do have more pressing concerns to attend do, the province is of critical importance to our regime and ensuring the loyalty of their government will be key in reuniting China."
 sichuan.128.d.manchu: "Although our new government lacks recognition from many of the warlords surrounding it, the Sichuanese provincial administration of [SZC.GetLeader] recently reached out to our government asking for aid. This is a great opportunity to show that we are the new 'legitimate' government of China. The agricultural ministries, however, are still reeling from the shock of the coup and may take time to prepare the aid required to help Sichuan."
 sichuan.128.a: "Order the ministries to send aid."
 sichuan.128.b: "We have other concerns."

 sichuan.129.t: "Ministerial Infighting!"
 sichuan.129.d: "As is typical for Beijing, our order to the various ministries of agriculture sparked an intense war of contract bidding, bureaucratic infighting and general inaction that typifies the lackadaisical Beijing government apparatus. One example today particularly exemplifies this corruption: sacks of rice have been assembled in Beijing, but a dispute over which rail company is to actually ship them to Chendu sparked a week-long series of negotiations involving kickbacks, bribes and bizarrely, accusations that one company's owner was a homosexual. While lots of money is changing hands, only a few grains of rice have actually made it to the hands of the starving peasantry of Sichuan."
 sichuan.129.a: "Get on with it!"

 sichuan.130.t: "Continued Ministerial Infighting"
 sichuan.130.d.zhili: "It appears the various agriculture ministries are still yet to actually deliver any of the food they have collected in Beijing. Sacks of grain sit rotting in warehouses across the city as the peasantry of Sichuan starve and Yang Sen's situation grows ever more tenuous by the day. Wu Peifu has devised a solution to get things moving - by threatening to fire the heads of the various ministries, Wu hopes he can light a fire under their chairs and push them into action. As always, however, this comes with a cost. Wu would have to spend political capital he can spend elsewhere in the government on reassuring the various patron networks backing the ministries that these threats are not *actually* serious. Or are they?"
 sichuan.130.d.manchu: "It appears the various agriculture ministries are still yet to actually deliver any of the food they have collected in Beijing. Sacks of grain sit rotting in warehouses across the city as the peasantry of Sichuan starve. The new government has an opportunity to flex their muscles by threatening to fire the ministers in charge of food distribution - but this would be costly."
 sichuan.130.a: "Pressure the ministries to start working!"
 sichuan.130.b: "Let them keep squabbling..."

 sichuan.131.t: "Famine relief from Beijing"
 sichuan.131.d: "While we were worried by the lack of trains from Beijing following our request for aid - their daily telegraphs that it was 'on its way' hardly relieving concerns - it seems they were able to whip the notoriously byzantine agriculture and aid ministries into some semblance of action. Even though some of the promised sacks of rice were less than full - no doubt skimmed by some salacious official - we've received enough food to temporarily alleviate the worst of the chaos."
 sichuan.131.a: "Finally!"

 sichuan.132.t: "Beijing Ignores our Petition"
 sichuan.132.d.zhili: "While Yang had hoped his old ally Wu Peifu would come to his aid in this moment of need, it appears the Jade Marshal has larger fish to fry. While he telegraphed Yang a sympathetic note, he claimed that the ongoing chaos in the former League of Eight Provinces robbed him of any resources available for famine relief."
 sichuan.132.d.manchu: "While we had always feared that the government in Beijing would ignore our requests, those fears proved well-warranted today when [QIE.GetLeader] formally informed us that he could not supply the necessary aid to counter our famine. Many suspect this is due to our 'warlord' loyalties and already [SZC.GetLeader]'s position looks increasingly tenuous by the day."
 sichuan.132.a: "We shall remember this!"

 sichuan.133.t: "CERA Congratulates the Government"
 sichuan.133.d: "Few groups within the Assembly loathe the Harmony Association and the Zhili more than the CERA. Comprised of naive intellectuals, they frequently protest the 'warlord nature' of our government and claim we are simply corrupt kleptocrats more interested in robbing the peasantry than developing the nation. Following our promise to aid [SZC.GetLeader] and stop the famine gripping his province, however, they publicly praised our 'surprising display of compassion for the peasantry of China'.\n\nNobody in the HA is really sure if they are naive enough to believe we are doing this to actually help the peasantry, but the support is certainly better than their usual loud protests."
 sichuan.133.a: "Thanks, I guess?"

 sichuan.134.t: "CERA Criticises the Government"
 sichuan.134.d: "Our decision to turn down Governor [SZC.GetLeader]'s request for aid was met with mostly silence - until today. The CERA - nominally the party of the 'peasantry' but really little more than a group of rich philanthropists convinced they can save China's peasantry by throwing their father's money at their problems - loudly denounced our inaction. This is certainly not unusual, as they seem to protest nearly everything we do. What, however, is unusual is the fact that people are starting to pay attention to them. While their protest pamphlets are normally only distributed in the cities, soldiers across our territory have reported seeing pamphlets denouncing the 'warlords that let their own people starve in the streets' in every city and village of our nation!"
 sichuan.134.a: "Let them shout!"

 sichuan.135.t: "The International Famine Relief Commission"
 sichuan.135.d: "Our cries for help have not fallen on empty ears! A consortium of wealthy philanthropists in the Legation Cities have convened to organise the 'China International Famine Relief Commission' (CIFRC). While most of them are helping out desire more for international recognition Western cash is desperately needed to buy food for our starving peasants, as the leaders of the surrounding warlord cliques, recognising our predicament, have jacked up prices. Hopefully these wealthy westerners can help save Sichuan!"
 sichuan.135.a: "Any aid is welcome."

 sichuan.136.t: "Support the CIFRC?"
 sichuan.136.d: "The province of Sichuan has long been subject to food insecurity. Recently, however, this problem has greatly worsened and the province has officially entered a famine. Philanthropists from around the world have begun to assemble conferences to help the province and have organised internationally into the China International Famine Relief Commission (CIFRC). Many of these philanthropists, who have influence within our government, are petitioning we directly support famine relief efforts. This has the potential to greatly improve the international perception of our government, but it will be costly."
 sichuan.136.a: "Send them a shipment of grain."
 sichuan.136.b: "Give them financial support."
 sichuan.136.c: "Send them what aid we can spare."
 sichuan.136.e: "We cannot help at this moment, unfortunately."

 sichuan.137.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Supports the CIFRC"
 sichuan.137.d: "[From.GetNameDefCap] has agreed to formally support the China International Famine Relief Commission branch in their country, sending some government aid our way! Already, the CIFRC has begun to put this money to good use buying food and other supplies for the starving peasantry."
 sichuan.137.a: "Thanks, comrades!"

 sichuan.138.t: "Send Aid to Sichuan?"
 sichuan.138.d.no_soy: "The province of Sichuan still struggles with a massive famine and now their representatives have come to us of all people, requesting famine relief. By supporting famine relief efforts in the province we could greatly bolster our legitimacy and convince them that we, not the foul traitors in Beijing, are the true rulers of China!"
 sichuan.138.d.soy: "The Soy Agricultural Initiative has created a grain surplus in Fengtian, while to the southwest Sichuan still struggles with a massive famine. Their representatives have come to us of all people, requesting famine relief. By supporting famine relief efforts in the province we could greatly bolster our legitimacy and convince them that we, not the foul traitors in Beijing, are the true rulers of China!"
 sichuan.138.a: "Prepare a large shipment."
 sichuan.138.b: "We cannot spare anything right now."

 sichuan.139.t: "Sichuan Grain Shipments Ready"
 sichuan.139.d: "At last, our shipments of grain intended for Sichuan are almost ready to be sent. Shipping them will be circuitous owing to the large amounts of hostile armies between us and Sichuan proper, but we doubt even the [GetZhiliManchu] are heartless enough to stop grain bound for the sufferers of a famine."
 sichuan.139.a: "Proof of our legitimacy!"

 sichuan.1390.t: "Shenyang Ignores our Petition"
 sichuan.1390.d: "While we had always feared that the government in Shenyang would ignore our requests, those fears proved well-warranted today when [FNG.GetLeader] formally informed us that he could not supply the necessary aid to counter our famine. Many suspect this is due to our 'warlord' loyalties and already [SZC.GetLeader]'s position looks increasingly tenuous by the day."
 sichuan.1390.a: "We shall remember this!"

 sichuan.140.t: "Fengtian Sends Aid To Sichuan"
 sichuan.140.d: "Our allies in the Fengtian Government have recently decided to send grain to Sichuan, both to help alleviate the famine there, but also to improve their legitimacy in the eyes of [SZC.GetLeader]. The grain will be sent down rivers under the Fengtian flag, which could cause problems.\n\nWe could pressure the Fengtian Government to fly our flag, which would no doubt prevent any hostile armies from attacking the transports due to fears of reprisal."
 sichuan.140.a: "Pressure them to use the [Root.GetAdjective] flag."
 sichuan.140.b: "It's their choice."

 sichuan.141.t: "The Japanese Demands"
 sichuan.141.d: "While we had hoped the [GetZhiliManchu] would not dare intercept our famine aid, Japanese agents have informed us that they have information suggesting the traitors will do just that!\n\nThe Japanese have provided an alternate proposal - flying their own flag on our shipments. The [GetZhiliManchu] would never dare provoke an international incident by attacking Japanese ships, though this would paint us as puppets to Tokyo in the eyes of those watching the ships."
 sichuan.141.a: "They might have a point..."
 sichuan.141.b: "Ignore them."

 sichuan.142.d.japan: "Fengtian has accepted to send grain under our flag, preventing the [GetZhiliManchu] from trying to hijack or stop the shipments from reaching Sichuan."
 sichuan.142.d.fengtian: "Fengtian has refused to send grain under our flag, claiming that this would undo any attempts to present their government as legitimate and instead convince the peasants that their regime was little more than a puppet of ours."

It appears that they are carrying large amounts of grain, though it would be very easy to hide guns under a layer of grain sacks...\n\nWe can demand the ships stop for a search, though this could greatly offend the Japanese government and potentially cause an international incident."
 sichuan.143.d.fengtian: "The Wuhan garrison commander has reported a flotilla of ships bearing the Fengtian flag sailing up the river towards Sichuan, laden with grain and relief supplies. We are faced with a dilemma - allowing the ships to pass will greatly increase the Sichuanese government's loyalty to Fengtian, but stopping and seizing them could create an even bigger backlash and risk painting our government as cruel and uncaring..."

 sichuan.146.d.fengtian: "Dire news! [GetZhiliManchu] authorities in Wuhan have seized our shipments of grain and are sending them to Sichuan under *their* banner!

After speaking with Governor-General Chen Jiongming, they pleaded before the Provincial Assembly for support. Their moving words showing desperation, coupled with disturbing photographic evidence, made it feel far more real to the assemblymen than the newspaper headlines could ever convey.\n\nDisorganised and emotional discussions were quickly cut short by the assembly president bringing back order. An elected legislature ought to act like one; the matter will be thoroughly discussed before a vote will be held. At the very least, it was clear that the people of Guangdong understood the gravity of the situation of their countrymen further north."

Sceptics were quick to criticise the Sichuan provincial government that allowed for the situation to worsen so much and the intense factional disputes there. There were divided opinions on the matter even among the organised political parties in the Assembly. While few could argue about the morality of sending aid, it was clear that Sichuan was not only suffering from famine, but from endemic corruption, which could very-well make any relief effort a complete waste."

 sichuan.153.t: "Chen Lianbo Pressures the Assembly"
 sichuan.153.d: "Chen Lianbo of the Guangzhou Chamber of Commerce, head of the Merchant Corps, spoke to the Provincial Assembly about the Sichuan famine. The wealthy Cantonese businessman, fond of philanthropy, was highly critical of the scepticism of many assemblymen and made it very clear that if the Provincial Assembly wouldn't act, he certainly would, and would publicly denounce every single member of the Provincial Assembly that voted against relief.\n\nThe merchant is certainly influential among the higher strata of Cantonese society; his pressure could certainly affect the Assembly's final vote on the matter."
 sichuan.153.a: "That should help matters."

 sichuan.154.t: "Chen Lianbo's Personal Donation"
 sichuan.154.d: "The wealthy head of the Merchant Corps doubled-down on his earlier statements to the Guangdong Provincial Assembly by making a huge private donation for relief to Sichuan. Making true his reputation as a philanthropist, Chen still warned that private donations, even from wealthy donors such as himself, could not compare to the potential relief the Guangdong Provincial Government could provide. His statement was a clear message to the elected representatives of the Provincial Assembly, even if the more pessimistic shrugged it off as a mere publicity stunt from a wealthy public figure."
 sichuan.154.a: "Thanks, friend."

 sichuan.155.t: "Pressure the Assembly?"
 sichuan.155.d: "It seems that the Provincial Assembly is far less united on relief fund to Sichuan than hoped. After all, it was clear that any relief to the province may never reach the starving people and that it would be yet another expense to the Provincial Government's fragile budget. Yet, Chen Jiongming believed that, despite the costs, not only was it the right thing to do, that it would put Guangdong in a good light and help the province's reputation throughout China. Of course, Chen also deeply believes in democracy and he must act within the law. While he could add further pressure to the Provincial Assembly, his intervention could backfire and open himself to public criticism, or set a dangerous precedent for future governors."
 sichuan.155.a: "It's the right thing to do."
 sichuan.155.b: "Don't interfere with the process."

 sichuan.156.t: "The Assembly Votes Yes"
 sichuan.156.d: "After several discussions, the Guangdong Provincial Assembly finally voted on famine relief to Sichuan. A majority of assemblymen voted in favour of the resolution and a relief plan will be drafted. This will help Guangdong's national reputation and appears to be a success for provincial democracy in China."
 sichuan.156.a: "Excellent."

 sichuan.157.t: "The Assembly Votes No"
 sichuan.157.d: "After several discussions, the Guangdong Provincial Assembly finally voted on famine relief to Sichuan. The motion failed to pass when it failed to gather a majority of the vote. This will certainly affect the province's reputation throughout China and opens up strong criticism against democratisation."
 sichuan.157.a: "What are you doing!?"

 sichuan.158.t: "Aid Arrives from Guangdong"
 sichuan.158.d: "The first shipment of aid from the Province of Guangdong finally arrived. Not only thanks to the private donations of many wealthy individuals in the province, but the Provincial Government's own relief fund will be able to help alleviate the crisis in Sichuan."
 sichuan.158.a: "Good news, at last!"

 sichuan.159.t: "No Aid from Guangdong"
 sichuan.159.d: "Despite our pleas, the Guangdong Provincial Assembly refused to allocate funds for famine relief to Sichuan. Their public refusal to send aid has sent a message not only to us, but to all of China, about the state of morality in wealthy Guangzhou and the provincial democracy they brag about so much."
 sichuan.159.a: "We'll remember this!"

 sichuan.160.t: "The Clay Eaters"
 sichuan.160.d: "The starvation crisis is reaching disturbing proportions in the countryside. Just like in 1925, some villagers with nothing else to turn to have started to dig up clay from the ground in a desperate bid to sate their hunger. Tragically, this has only led to sickness and more misery. We've instructed local administrators and police to inform the people on the dangers of resorting to these measures, though with the situation being what it is these warnings are likely to fall on deaf ears."
 sichuan.160.a: "That won't help matters!"

 sichuan.161.t: "Rice Riots"
 sichuan.161.d: "The scuffles and shouting matches following the price spikes earlier in the year are nothing compared to the displays that often haunt the major cities of Sichuan. All too often when bags of rice arrive in the markets, fights break out over them. Allegations of hoarding, price rigging and other malicious practices are rife and sadly, not inaccurate a lot of the time. With anger fuming among the hungry citizenry of the cities, we've been forced to deploy military police in the cities to maintain order and prevent, or at least mitigate any future outbreaks of violence and vandalism. This is hardly a permanent solution though as the presence of what some may see as uniformed thugs is likely to cause tensions and discontent to rise even further if we can't solve these shortages."
 sichuan.161.a: "We need this crisis solved, now!"

 sichuan.162.t: "Violence in the Markets"
 sichuan.162.d: "The merchants in the cities are often bearing the brunt of the anger that the desperate food shortages in the cities have caused. Shouts that they're famine profiteers and food hoarders are rampant, with many of them being attacked in the broad daylight of the marketplaces. Sometimes, even the rumour of a merchant withholding bags of rice for himself is enough to cause them to be attacked, only for the rioters to find out all too late that the store they sacked was as empty as their stomachs. This has led to several stores and markets closing down out of fear for more violence, which has only had the effect of making food even harder to come by. If the merchants weren't hoarding their last few bags of rice before, they certainly are now. Extra police have been deployed to handle these situations, but the damage has already been done."
 sichuan.162.a: "Can this crisis get any worse?"

 sichuan.163.t: "Unusual Solutions"
 sichuan.163.d: "Eating grass, leaves and berries has become commonplace around Sichuan as people, especially in the countryside, have started to take to rather unorthodox solutions to feed themselves in lieu of any other alternatives. Many are turning to more outlandish solutions though, with various flora and fauna commonly regarded as inedible being used as substitutes for food. The creative solutions are sometimes almost as disturbing as the crisis itself and though having something to eat is better than having nothing to eat, this only underscores the urgency in getting proper relief out to the hungry masses."
 sichuan.163.a: "We'll need to monitor this development."

 sichuan.164.t: "Spike in Poisoning Cases"
 sichuan.164.d: "The recent rise in makeshift solutions to the famine has led to tragic yet predictable results, despite our best efforts to spread awareness of the risks these practices bring with them. Hospitals and rural clinics are seeing a large increase in patients suffering from acute cases of poisoning, assuming they're even able to make it there in the first place. With our medical services being pressed to their limits, local administrators have been tasked with informing their people on the dangers of these activities. As long as the famine endures though, cases aren't likely to stop occurring."
 sichuan.164.a: "We should've acted faster."

 sichuan.165.t: "Child Poverty Rises"
 sichuan.165.d: "Poverty has sadly been a companion to most of Sichuan throughout our history. With the famine sweeping the nation, it's only gotten worse as families already on the brink have been hit hard by this crisis. Where before there was scarcity, now there's hardly anything for them at all. Without any safety net in hard times, the youngest are some of the worst affected by this."
 sichuan.165.a: "Sichuan can't take much more of this!"

 sichuan.166.t: "The Abandoned Children"
 sichuan.166.d: "Because of the terrible conditions gripping the province recently, there's been a massive increase in abandoned children being left to fend for themselves. Sometimes it's because their parents simply have no means to feed their families, although often the tragic reason is that they aren't even in the picture any more. With thousands of cases like this already and many more appearing every day, the people are pleading that the government takes action to help the children of the province."
 sichuan.166.a: "We *must* help them. No one else will."

 sichuan.167.t: "Children of the Famine"
 sichuan.167.d: "The worst hit by the famine have been the children of Sichuan. With food being scarce and disorder being rampant, no one's spared from the effects of the famine. Worst hit of all are the children with the tragic tales being too many to count. We cannot stand for this. Together with our international relief partners we've established a special government operation to safeguard them and our future. This includes everything from special allocations of food and other aid resources to prevent future tragedies, all the way up to providing shelter and orphanages in the cases where tragedy has already struck.\n\nThese are small and costly steps on the road to recovery from the famine, but it's worth every effort to let our people know that no matter what, the children of our province will not be forced to fend for themselves."
 sichuan.167.a: "We take care of our own."

 sichuan.168.t: "Refugees Flee the Province"
 sichuan.168.d: "Seeing no future in Sichuan, people are fleeing the province in their thousands for the literal greener pastures to the north, south and east. Several smaller villages have been turned into ghost towns due to the massive number of people leaving them. Unless we put a quick end to this disastrous famine, this will only be the first wave out of many."
 sichuan.168.a: "The bad news continue to pile up..."

 sichuan.169.t: "Refugees From Sichuan"
 sichuan.169.d.QIE: "Drought and the aftermath of a brutal civil war has caused a terrible famine to grip Sichuan. With the government of Sichuan seemingly being incapable of solving these problems, many have simply given up and fled the province by the tens of thousands for the greener pastures in our lands. While they aren't the only ones that have fallen on hard times in China, many both among the population and in our government demand that we do something to help our fellow Chinese. Others believe and hardly without reason either, that given the crisis following the collapse of the League of Eight Provinces on top of our own struggles that there's little we can do to help. Given the scale of the situation, turning them back to Sichuan is only bound to make matters worse.\n\nRegardless of our actions, our government has filed an official request to the government in [SZC.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] that they increase their efforts to solve this crisis."

 sichuan.169.a: "Try to help out however we can."

 sichuan.170.t: "Corruption Shows Its Face"
 sichuan.170.d: "It's a tale as old as time itself. Whether it's a crate of relief goods that simply disappeared or a colonel requesting food rations for regiments that only exist on paper, the chaos in the country has opened the doors for a lot of shameless individuals to take something extra for themselves. Whether it's desperation or greed, we cannot stand for any of this. More efforts need to be taken to root out this kind of thievery."
 sichuan.170.a: "Seriously? Stealing from starving peasants?"

 sichuan.171.t: "Corruption Delays Relief Efforts"
 sichuan.171.d: "Recently there have been reports of soldiers and officials extorting people for bribes in order to allow aid shipments to pass through, calling it a toll fee or something similarly disingenuous. An order has been issued that anyone caught engaging in these kinds of activities will have disciplinary actions taken against them. That should get them to think twice before attempting to earn a few coins this way."
 sichuan.171.a: "Not this again..."

 sichuan.172.t: "Black Market on Foodstuffs"
 sichuan.172.d: "With a bag of rice being worth its weight in gold, smuggling food has become a lucrative business for criminal syndicates and ruthless opium farmers alike. Some are using hoarded resources and selling them at a premium to desperate people across Sichuan while more brazen criminals simply steal the food relief packages to sell on the black market. The police are doing everything they can to combat this shameless criminality, but their efforts are so far coming up short in eliminating the problem altogether."
 sichuan.172.a: "More profiteering off the suffering?"

 sichuan.173.t: "KMT Raids on Food Shipments"
 sichuan.173.d: "China is hardly a stranger to war and although we recently concluded our civil war, conflicts are still gripping China. In a worrying new trend, some of our international aid shipments have been raided by Kuomintang guerrillas. While we have yet to determine if they're from Yunnan, Guangxi or even the Left Kuomintang fighting in what used to be the League of Eight Provinces, we need to step up security to prevent these actions from happening in the future."
 sichuan.173.a: "Now this is just ridiculous."

 sichuan.174.t: "Prayers for Rain"
 sichuan.174.d: "Whether driven by genuine belief or if he simply wished to instil hope in a despairing public, Liu Xiang has gathered several religious leaders from across the province to pray for rains to come back to Sichuan and put an end to the drought. While it's certainly a nice display, it's hardly done anything to help matters on the ground as days after the prayers were called there still isn't a cloud in the skies, let alone rain."
 sichuan.174.a: "This isn't helping!"

 sichuan.175.t: "Dujiangyan, Damaged"
 sichuan.175.d: "During the civil the Dujiangyan system for irrigating the area around the Baopingkou Channel was tampered with, causing a flooding meant to repulse Liu Xiang's forces without having to fight them in the field. It turns out, however, that by taking the easy route that day we've made the famine situation worse for ourselves. The operation by our engineers caused lasting damages that have now caused the channel to dry up. Without any means or irrigating the area, a drought has stricken the nearby fields, worsening an already dire situation. We have no one to blame for this ordeal but ourselves and we must now take responsibility for our actions."
 sichuan.175.a: "What have we done?"

 sichuan.176.t: "James Yen's Personal Donation"
 sichuan.176.d: "It seems that despite our miserable conditions, there are still friends out there willing to help. One of them is Y.C. James Yen, a leading intellectual in Beijing and a leader of the Chinese Empire Reform Association, as well as the mastermind of the Rural Reconstruction Movement. We have just received a missive from Yen, stating his desire to help with the famine relief efforts. To that end, his Rural Reconstruction Movement has made a hefty donation to our relief efforts, and more aid is to come."
 sichuan.176.a: "Thanks, friend."

 sichuan.200.t: "Affairs of the Red Basin"
 sichuan.200.d: "The Sichuan Basin, also named the Red Basin for the red sandstone lining the soil, is currently in a sorry state. The hilly region boasts some of China's most fertile land, as well as ample avenues for irrigation and terrace farming. However, the last decades have not been kind to the province. A succession of inept governments since the late Qing era has left the province stagnated and isolated relative to the Chinese economy.\n\nIn the last three decades, cultivation of opium has become perhaps Sichuan's largest and most important economic sector, due to the high profits obtainable from the growth of the poppy. Opium brings much wealth, but it is also a major problem due to its effects on the population. Its unregulated growth was one of the causes of the Famine and also a source of conflict due to both criminal associations and even the Sichuanese warlords attempting to control the trade.\n\nBefore we can even start to work on improving our economy, we must decide the fate of the opium industry. The status quo is unsustainable, but there are a few options we could choose..."
 sichuan.200.a: "We must eradicate opium from the province."
 sichuan.200.b: "We shall bring the opium under our control."

 SZC_opium_removal_tooltip: "§ROpium cultivation is omnipresent in Sichuan. Reducing its spread will be an arduous and politically costly task. The potential benefits, however, should not be underestimated.§!"
 SZC_opium_monopoly_tooltip: "§RThe opium trade is extremely prevalent in Sichuan, bolstered by the complete lack of regulation in the past decades. We should expect heavy resistance against any form of regulation.§!"

 sichuan.201.t: "Assessing the Spread of Opium"
 sichuan.201.d: "Sichuan can make the claim of being the world's largest producer and consumer of opium with thousands of tons of the plant being cultivated within our borders every years. It's often said that Sichuan is the very rotten core of the Chinese opium crisis and has been ever since the Anglo-Chinese wars of the 19th century. Given the enormity of the scale of both the production and consumption of opium that takes places in Sichuan, no one is under any illusions that this will be a tremendously difficult task to tackle."
 sichuan.201.a: "It must be done."

 sichuan.202.t: "The Scale of Corruption"
 sichuan.202.d: "From top to bottom, every segment of Sichuanese society is affected by the opium trade and its associated vices, to the point where the everyday functions of government and society are impaired. For instance, a soldier being paid in opium while his commander pockets his wages is an alarmingly common practice. Not only does this foster corruption and bad morale within the army, but as our recent civil war tragically proved, widespread opium addiction within the ranks led to needless deaths and suffering on all sides of the conflict. Similar practices are seen in other branches of the government, from local mayors enriching themselves through the drug trade, all the way down to petty bureaucrats accepting bribes and harassing the local population. Even the common man in Sichuan isn't immune to the temptations of this corruption, despite more often than not being merely its victim.\n\nWe have to come to terms with the daunting fact that corruption infests every facet of our society - from top to bottom - with hardly a single entity in Sichuan being spared from it. We have a long and hard road ahead of us if we are to curb this problem."
 sichuan.202.a: "It's *that* bad?!"

 sichuan.203.t: "Addiction to Opium"
 sichuan.203.d: "The scourge of opium is so widespread in Sichuan that it's part of every-day life in the province. Its effects can be seen wherever you look, from the people in the streets that cast away their lives over it to the very top of society. No one is spared from its consequences. It's truly a sign of the times that sights that would've shocked anyone throughout most of history is seen as part of the daily routine in Sichuan."
 sichuan.203.a: "We'll need to deal with this sooner or later."

 sichuan.204.t: "A Plan Against Opium"
 sichuan.204.d: "The commission tasked with stamping out the opium abuse and profiteering in Sichuan has started to draft plans for the monumental task of ridding Sichuan from this blight. The measures proposed point towards a difficult road ahead with even the most optimistic projections suggesting that this will be an incredibly costly and hard-fought endeavour.\n\nSome of the lighter measures include reforms and rather conventional anti-corruption measures. The commission also insists on the urgency to rehabilitate addicts and force them off their dependency, something that will burden our healthcare system. A representative of the army was also present at the meeting and laid out plans for what they can do by aiding the police's efforts in curtailing production and smuggling, although some of their methods may be a bit heavy-handed.\n\nIt's a long road ahead for us. Let's see this one through to the end."
 sichuan.204.a: "Let's get started."

 sichuan.205.t: "Rise of the Black Market"
 sichuan.205.d: "As soon as the government began its initiative to crack down on opium addiction an inevitable side-effect was an explosion in opium prices and the rise of a black market. Already this underground economy is one of the larger in Sichuan in terms of GDP, all of which goes straight to the pockets of the criminals. The price hike is also sure to cause immense hardships for the addicts in Sichuan's population unless we intervene and provide them with the help they need. Breaking the black market should, however, be our utmost priority."
 sichuan.205.a: "They are thugs and shall be dealt with."

 sichuan.206.t.delays: "Our Efforts Are Delayed"
 sichuan.206.d.delays: "With opium becoming worth its weight in gold thanks to the supply being pushed underground, there's a lot of money to be made in turning a blind eye to it. Officials routinely 'forget' to report opium being transported through their districts as the temptation of getting a cut from the black market is often all too tempting. Without stricter measures against administrative corruption, these issues are unlikely to go away."
 sichuan.206.t.bribery: "Bribery Scandal"
 sichuan.206.d.bribery: "A major scandal has rocked our army. Several military officials tasked with overseeing the eradication of opium fields have been arrested for distributing the seized opium stocks they were meant to destroy. Under their command, conscripts were also paid in opium packages while the money meant to pay for their salaries went straight into the pockets of the officers. They'll be dealt with harshly, but as long as there's money to be gained from corruption this isn't likely to be the last case of this kind."
 sichuan.206.t.no_enforcement: "Lack of Law Enforcement"
 sichuan.206.d.no_enforcement: "It's no secret that a crate of opium can fetch a police officer's yearly salary. They're only human and as such a lot of previously honest police have been caught taking bribes or even participating in smuggling operations as middlemen. The most common practice though is that of officers simply not reporting what they see and turning a blind eye to things, all in exchange for money and drugs. It seems that we need to step up our efforts to straighten out our police force. If they falter, so will our anti-opium efforts."
 sichuan.206.a: "How deep can this go?!"

 sichuan.207.t: "Start of the Anti-Corruption Campaign"
 sichuan.207.d: "The efforts to stamp out corruption are already bearing fruit. Though arrests and convictions are few so far, we've made it known that no one is safe from the long arm of the law. The serious threat of being thrown into a dungeon if caught is forcing a lot of these spineless cowards to comply and do their jobs. Slowly but surely, the bureaucracies are being brought in line with the rest of our anti-opium initiative."
 sichuan.207.a: "We shall root them out, one by one if need be!"

 sichuan.208.t: "Corruption In The Civil Service"
 sichuan.208.d: "Even our administration isn't safe from the temptation of making a quick buck in the wake of the war on opium. Embezzlement, theft and bribery is running rampant with several quite embarrassing arrests already having been made. There's still a lot that needs to be done to rid our administration of these weak-willed two-bit criminals, it seems."
 sichuan.208.a: "How did this become so huge?!"

 sichuan.209.t: "Corruption In The Army"
 sichuan.209.d: "Large parts of our army has long suffered from a poor reputation for a widespread lack of professionalism. A lot of this pertains to opium with a large portion of our force being addicts that are often covertly paid in opium while their commanding officers pocket their requisitioned wages. These practices have long been tacitly accepted, but when we announced our anti-opium initiative they could hardly expect to be made exempt from the law. This has already caused problems both with soldiers and officers. The generals are going to have a hard time sorting out this mess."
 sichuan.209.a: "Even in the army?!"

 sichuan.210.t: "Smugglers In The Administration"
 sichuan.210.d: "With the amount of money to be made from opium smuggling it was inevitable that officials in our administration would give in to the temptation of money. Already many lower and even middle-ranking officials have been put behind bars for aiding smuggling efforts in the countryside, usually by taking bribes in exchange for letting smuggling operations go unhindered. It seems that no matter how many we catch, there's always more corrupt officials behind every corner."
 sichuan.210.a: "You can't break the law if you *are* the law, apparently."

 sichuan.211.t.committee: "Opium Committee Involved in Smuggling"
 sichuan.211.d.committee: "In what may be the biggest embarrassment for the committee yet, a ranking member of it was caught red-handed in a police sting operation. The now former official had been taking large bribes in exchange for reporting that operations that didn't even take place were in fact successful, which in some cases led to resources being diverted from much-needed law enforcement in the region. While the arrest is a positive development, the fact that it happened at all has humiliated the committee."
 sichuan.211.t.bureau: "Sales Bureau Involved in Smuggling"
 sichuan.211.d.bureau: "Several members of the state sales bureau have been arrested today after being caught cutting deals with the smugglers. This has not only harmed our efforts to establish a healthy state monopoly in this business, but it has also led to large sums of opium going untaxed right under our noses. Those arrested now faces long jail sentences while we're forced to increase our efforts against the smugglers if we are to regain our market share."
 sichuan.211.a: "Now this is just plain ridiculous!"

 sichuan.212.t: "Political Murders"
 sichuan.212.d: "As the saying goes, if you're above the target, they'll fire at you. With their market share shrinking thanks to the efforts of our law enforcement, military and administration, a sad reality is that the criminals will retaliate against us. Today two officials that had been stalwart fighters against corruption were assassinated in broad daylight by hired thugs. The criminals soon joined them thanks to our police, but it shows that the smugglers are ready to stop at nothing to win this war."
 sichuan.212.a: "They must be getting desperate!"

 sichuan.213.t: "Opium Fades"
 sichuan.213.d: "The efforts to tackle opium have finally yielded significant results. Though the fight has been tough and a lot of hardships have been endured, the role opium is playing in the Sichuanese economy has started to diminish. Addicts in the streets are becoming a scarcer sight and the debauchery associated with the opium dens is now gradually being phased out of society. Slowly but surely, we're winning this fight."
 sichuan.213.a: "We can't stop now!"

 sichuan.214.t: "Rising Grain Production"
 sichuan.214.d: "Opium as a crop is very labour-intensive, requiring huge amounts of work, resources and attention to cultivate. With the amount of opium being produced in Sichuan, a massive portion of our province's arable lands were devoted to opium production. With the growth of opium likely to lead to a jail sentence or worse, however, fewer and fewer farmers are growing it these days. This is a positive development as it has led to a gradual but significant increase in food crops being grown by our farmers. From having endured a famine not long ago, we may not be far from an agricultural boom."
 sichuan.214.a: "Never another famine!"

 sichuan.215.t: "Tax Evasion Discovered"
 sichuan.215.d: "Sichuan has long had a problem with corruption. In large part caused by a dysfunctional government split between various warlords, a relic from those times is that tax collection has been very ineffective. Only 10-20% of what's collected seem to end up in [SZC.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], while the rest is lost to waste and fraud along the way."
 sichuan.215.a: "Do we need to do everything ourselves?"

 sichuan.216.t: "Tax Evasion Increases Enormously"
 sichuan.216.d: "The plans to monopolise and tax opium has proven to not only be wildly unpopular, but it's also facing stiff resistance. Tax evasion, already a big problem before, has exploded since we put our plans into effect. As resistance to taxation comes from every level of society and not just a handful of dejected merchants, this will be a tremendous hurdle to overcome if our monopoly is to gain legitimacy."
 sichuan.216.a: "Get rid of those parasites!"

 sichuan.217.t: "Merchants Revolt Against Our Policies"
 sichuan.217.d: "Many of Sichuan's largest merchant houses and farm owners are beginning to mount stiff resistance against our monopoly. With their combined resources, they hold a very significant power base in the country through their economic influence alone. This has allowed them to actively defy our newly imposed rules and taxes. In hindsight, we should probably have expected them to put up this kind of fight when faced with the prospect of being parted from their ill-gotten gains. We have no choice but to fight fire with fire on this one."
 sichuan.217.a: "Together or alone, they'll be crushed all the same."

 sichuan.218.t: "Smugglers Cut Into Our Profits"
 sichuan.218.d: "With new taxes being created and tax collection being streamlined, the smuggling of opium has become an even more lucrative business than ever before. The high taxes and - allegedly - 'draconian' measures by the state has allowed the gangs to undercut what the government is offering through its legal venues. Despite the best efforts of the police and army, they're still able to operate with relative ease."
 sichuan.218.a: "Hunt down those thugs!"

 sichuan.219.t: "Illegal Opium Production"
 sichuan.219.d: "Before the establishment of the Sales Bureau, the growth of opium was completely unregulated and undocumented. This has caused tremendous difficulties in establishing just how much opium is being grown illegally as no reliable records exist. Already our tax collectors and police are complaining that their work is like searching through the dark and that they're having a lot of difficulties bringing it all under the auspices of the state. Measures ought to be taken to expand the state's abilities to track and tax these matters!"
 sichuan.219.a: "New law: all producers must now have a licence!"

 sichuan.220.t: "The Bureau Takes Action"
 sichuan.220.d: "The creation of the Sales Monopoly Bureau to control has already had some successes. Through their early work, they've managed to establish framework for how to operate and how both legal and illegal production is to be dealt with. Slowly but surely, we can expect their hard work to fill our coffers as the efficiency of their efforts rise by the hour."
 sichuan.220.a: "This should be profitable!"

 sichuan.221.t: "Taxation Hampered By Corruption"
 sichuan.221.d: "The temptation of money gets to even the best of us. We're facing a growing problem of officials taking bribes in order to let smugglers cut into our profits. Others are simply collecting taxes and pocketing the money for themselves, only to then report it as a shortfall caused by merchants evading taxes. It seems evident by now that we simply haven't implemented sufficiently harsh punishments for this kind of selfish criminality."
 sichuan.221.a: "Get rid of those idiots!"

 sichuan.222.t: "First Opium Profits Arrive"
 sichuan.222.d: "Step by step, the Sales Monopoly Bureau has grown in power to become an all-encompassing, nationwide institution. Through their hard work, they've managed to cut tax evasion to a record low and brought an end to most major smuggling operations in the province. We're already starting to see tremendous profits pour into the state's coffers. With the amount of riches we're seeing from our monopoly's success, we should have no problems funding future government projects."
 sichuan.222.a: "Excellent!"

 sichuan.223.t: "Army Crushes Smugglers!"
 sichuan.223.d: "Utilising a mix of good intelligence and brute force, the army has swept in against a series of opium fields and smuggling hubs across Sichuan, burning and bombing several to ashes and inflicting grievous losses on the criminals. By the end of the day, a large quantity of illegal fields and warehouses were destroyed and a significant portion of the known smuggling ships used along the Yangtze were destroyed as well. All around, this operation has dealt a devastating blow to these criminals. Not only has this operation utterly routed several of the smuggler outfits, but it's also sure to send a clear message to criminals that their profiteering from narcotics will lead to their demise.\n\nThis decisive victory by the army has helped us to significantly improve the situation in our fight to curb opium and taught our army valuable lessors in fighting unconventional enemies in varied environments."
 sichuan.223.a: "A cutting blow!"

 sichuan.224.t: "The Army Fights Smugglers"
 sichuan.224.d: "Recent days have seen a large offensive by the military against the smugglers plaguing Sichuan. A series of raids on illegal farms, smuggling warehouses and other facilities used by criminal gangs around Sichuan. Although not decisive, the army has won a victory while taking relatively light casualties from enemies armed with light arms smuggled into the country. This operation has also taught our troops and commanders a few valuable lessons in fighting foes in forests and towns."
 sichuan.224.a: "Our soldiers fought well today."

 sichuan.225.t: "Army Struggles Against Smugglers"
 sichuan.225.d: "Our recent military operations against the smugglers were met with mixed results. Utilising weapons left behind during the civil war, they fought back and locked our forces in a series of guerrilla battles that bogged them down. While we were able to disrupt their operations and kill several criminals, their tenacity allowed them to evacuate and relocate large amount of opium and weapons before we could destroy them. Although losses were only moderate and some progress was made, even the biggest optimists are having a hard time spinning this as a victory."
 sichuan.225.a: "We'll get them next time."

 sichuan.226.t: "Army Routed By Smugglers!"
 sichuan.226.d: "Terrible news from the latest round of anti-smuggling operations. As embarrassing as it may sound, our inept commanders have allowed their soldiers to be routed by common bandits. Using military-grade weapons salvaged from the civil war and likely knowing where we would strike, they were able to ambush and gun down our forces. Losses are said to be very heavy and the nature of the attacks leave little doubts that we may have several moles within our ranks acting on the behalf of the smugglers. An investigation is already being carried out into the matter.\n\nThere's no way to spin this other than as a complete defeat and despite our efforts to suppress it the newspapers in [SZC.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] are already reporting on it as a humiliating defeat that has tarnished the reputation of [SZC.GetLeader]. Some members of our government are even demanding that we urgently rethink the military's role in our campaign against opium."
 sichuan.226.a: "A shameful display! Reprimand the commander!"

 sichuan.250.t: "Tian Songyao Expands Into Industrial Territory"
 sichuan.250.d: "With Eastern Sichuan still disorderly following Xiang's flight and the fall of Chongqing, Tian Songyao has taken the opportunity to send his forces into the region, ostensibly to 'restore order'. While he has been effective in this aspect, his dislike for Yang Sen is well known and his ambitions remain a mystery for now."
 sichuan.250.a: "Keep an eye on him."

 sichuan.251.t: "Liu Cunhou Expands Into Officer Territory"
 sichuan.251.d: "As we continue our efforts to restore order in Southern Sichuan, following the defeat of the Officer Department in the war, we have received some... interesting reports from our commanders in the field. Our erstwhile ally, general and former governor of Sichuan Liu Cunhou, has been unusually active in sending his troops to the region. It's certainly a nice gesture and for all intents and purposes not something to worry about, but Yang Sen suspects something may be afoot..."
 sichuan.251.a: "Is he planning something?"

 sichuan.252.t: "Shadowy Meetings"
 sichuan.252.d: "Conflicting reports continue to arrive from the Eastern and Southern Sichuan. While warlord activity is nothing new in Sichuan, it seems something else may be going on. There have been several meetings between minor warlords in the region. Our spies have not obtained much information for now, but general Fan Shaozeng, Yang Sen's second in command, strongly suspects they might be planning a coalition of minor warlords.\n\nFor what reason, it remains unknown."
 sichuan.252.a: "Alright, what's really going on here?"

 sichuan.253.t: "The Baoding Efforts"
 sichuan.253.d: "It seems history is repeating. Once again, the Chengdu army is in a sorry state, following the heavy fighting in the last months. As in 1931, after the first Officer Department expedition, the Baoding Department has taken up efforts to restore order in the south. Reports continue to come of areas successfully being pacified.\n\nWhile Baoding may yet prove to be a threat, for now our alliance with them continues to bring dividends."
 sichuan.253.a: "Thanks, comrades!"

 sichuan.254.t: "Tian Songyao Pledges Allegiance to Liu Cunhou"
 sichuan.254.d: "Unexpected news out of Nanbu, warlord Tian Songyao's main base to the northeast. Songyao, a man known for his political neutrality - having blocked off his domain to all forces involved in the civil war a few months back - but also for ruthless opportunism, has suddenly and publicly declared his allegiance to the former governor of Sichuan and Armament Department leader Liu Cunhou. Songyao is not doing this out of loyalty for the Department. Something dangerous is happening and Liu Cunhou is certainly involved in it.\n\nWe may be facing betrayal in the ranks."
 sichuan.254.a: "Investigate this, now!"

 sichuan.255.t: "An Offer from the Baoding Department"
 sichuan.255.d: "With tensions rising in the province after the unexpected alliance between Liu Cunhou and Tian Songyao, we have received a missive from Deng Xihou, who claims to have valuable information about Liu's movements and intentions. Our spies have found nothing on Cunhou's plans so far and this is a tempting offer. However, their demands might yet prove to be too much."
 sichuan.255.a: "Arrange this meeting. Secretly."

 sichuan.256.t: "Meeting Deng Xihou"
 sichuan.256.d: "Deng Xihou arrived tonight in Chengdu under utmost secrecy. In a shoddy basement under the old Manchu palace and after a few rounds of discussion a deal has been hashed out: Deng Xihou informs that Liu Cunhou has contacted him recently, asking for a public declaration of loyalty or at least neutrality. In exchange for guarantees of autonomy and government influence for the Baoding Department, as well as a freer hand in implementing their economic projects, both Deng Xihou and Liu Wenhui will pledge their loyalty to Yang Sen and the Armament Department.\n\nThe Baoding Department has its own interests, but Yang Sen's modernisation programme mostly aligns with their goals. Furthermore, the Baoding troops are the best-trained troops in Sichuan and will certainly prove invaluable.\n\nThe ultimate decision now rests with Yang Sen."
 sichuan.256.a: "Very well, we accept your deal."
 sichuan.256.b: "Deng cannot be trusted."

 sichuan.257.t: "Plots in the Dark"
 sichuan.257.d: "With our deal signed and Baoding being given their long-desired autonomy and influence, Deng Xihou now has given our agents all the information they have on Liu Cunhou's movements. Liu Cunhou is planning to execute a coup a week from now, with support from Tian Songyao and several minor warlords in the province, having bought their support with promises of wealth, power or influence.\n\nWith detailed knowledge of Cunhou's planned movements and with support from the Baoding Department, we can turn this to our advantage. Liu's coup will become an inescapable trap when he launches his plot."
 sichuan.257.a: "We'll be ready for him."

 sichuan.258.t: "A Declaration of Neutrality"
 sichuan.258.d: "News coming from Ya'an and Guanxian today. Following our refusal of Deng Xihou's deal, both his Northern troops and Liu Wenhui's Xikang troops have been steadily withdrawing towards their home territories. This has been followed today by a joint declaration from the two leaders, denouncing the incompetence of the Chengdu leadership. However, they have stopped short of declaring for Liu Cunhou and have instead professed their full neutrality from this moment onward. Already our soldiers are being evicted from their areas."
 sichuan.258.a: "We may have made a mistake..."

 sichuan.259.t: "Fires in the Garrison"
 sichuan.259.d.trap: "As dawn rises over Chengdu Liu Cunhou jumped into action and his troops have now begun taking over the Manchu garrison that forms the Armament headquarters. Tian Songyao is also present in the city, commanding troops to take control of several strategic points. Unfortunately for him, we are well prepared for his treason..."
 sichuan.259.d.coup: "Dawn rises to find Chengdu in absolute chaos. Unexpected by anyone in the Armament leadership and believed to be still in his base of Daxian, Liu Cunhou's troops have now begun taking over the Manchu garrison that forms the Armament headquarters. On the city streets, Tian Songyao's goons have been quick to assert their control over our drowsy troops. Heavy fighting has broken inside the old Manchu garrison that is now the Armament Department headquarters and Yang Sen is nowhere to be seen."
 sichuan.259.a: "Spring the trap!"
 sichuan.259.b: "Chengdu hangs in the balance..."

 sichuan.260.t: "The Countercoup"
 sichuan.260.d: "Within hours of his attempted coup, Liu Cunhou has utterly failed in any of his objectives. With advance knowledge of the coup, Yang Sen and Fan Shaozeng feigned chaos in the garrison, which Liu Cunhou took as proof of his success. When they attempted to take the rest of the building, several battalions hidden around the enormous complex sprung into action, forming barricades and trapping Cunhou's soldiers. Looking down at Liu Cunhou's corpse on the floor, Yang Sen orders his loyal general Fan Shaozeng to sweep the building and force the surrender of any remnants of Liu's troops.\n\nDown in the lower city, Tian Songyao lays dead on the streets, killed by Baoding agents infiltrated among the populace.\n\nThe coup is over and peace can now finally return to Sichuan."
 sichuan.260.a: "A traitor's death."

 sichuan.261.t: "Liu Cunhou Assumes Leadership"
 sichuan.261.d: "The fighting was heavy, but brief. Caught completely unaware, Yang Sen's troops were no match for Liu Cunhou and Tian Songyao's troops and by noon most of the city was solidly under their control. Yang Sen and Fan Shaozeng are dead, killed in the firefight, while their now-leaderless troops have surrendered.\n\nFrom the courtyard of the old Manchu garrison, Liu Cunhou has declared his assumption of the Armament leadership and nobody is left in the city to oppose him."
 sichuan.261.a: "Once again, Liu is governor of Sichuan."

 sichuan.262.t: "Sichuan declares support for the Central Government"
 sichuan.262.d: "Despite their recent troubles, it seems [SZC.GetLeader]'s Armament Department has managed to beat the odds and retain control of the province, bringing it into our sphere. We have received a missive from [SZC.GetLeader] declaring his loyalty to our government."
 sichuan.262.a: "One more province into the fold!"

 sichuan.263.t: "Sichuan Sends Support"
 sichuan.263.d: "In a positive turn of events, our ranks have recently been bolstered by a steady stream of reinforcements from our friends in Sichuan. The League may have fallen on hard times, but it seems that we still have allies to count on. We'll put these forces to good use as we stamp out the last of these insurrectionists from our lands!"
 sichuan.263.a: "Some good news, at least."

 sichuan.264.t: "Marshal Wang Chengbin Arrives In Sichuan"
 sichuan.264.d: "Following the devastating Manchu Coup as of recent, many feared that the North Zhili Clique was doomed, cast away to the dustbin of history. With the brutal Zhili-Manchu War seeing the third hierarch of the Zhili Clique, Marshal Wang Chengbin, rally the forces of the Zhili in a last ditch effort to retake Beijing, the losses were tremendous. With the loss of Cao Kun and Wu Peifu in one fell swoop, the Zhili rank and file were initially heavily demoralised. Without the Jade Marshal, could they stand a chance? Could they even defeat the Manchu? Let alone any other warlord? And so here he arrived, the pale horse, here to vanquish the Zhili Clique once and for all.\n\nYet there stood a man, defiant of the Royalist's ambitions, defiant of the bloodshed, defiant of the death of his mentor Cao Kun. Minister of the Army Marshal Wang Chengbin, having not been present at Beijing during the coup attempt, stood as the first rallying point for the chaotic Zhili forces. Championing the emergency strategies of the Civil War, he would fight tooth and nail to preserve Zhili Hegemony, to avenge his fallen friend, and even regretfully that of Wu Peifu. For what would he be for their memory to die in vain? Staging a delayed retreat, Wang would have to bear the full brutality of the Royalist armies. Levelling whole cities, annihilating Luoyang, rampaging in Wuhan, and it was all for naught.\n\nWith many presuming that Wang Chengbin died in the fighting, perhaps in Luoyang or Wuhan, none within [SZC.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] would have expected the humble arrivals last night. A convoy of trucks, unmarked, and clearly worn down, arrived on the outskirts of [SZC.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. A military patrolman ordered them to turn back. Although when they stopped, the patrolman was in utter disbelief. Stepping out of the first truck, arm wrapped in a blood-soaked bandage and face covered in shrapnel wounds, was Marshal Wang.\n\nThe guardsman quickly flagged the convoy to [SZC.GetLeader]'s compound in the centre of the city, where he received Wang and the remnants of Beijing's command structure. Fury and revenge in his eyes, Wang pleaded to [SZC.GetLeader], imploring  him to assemble his forces and prepare for a campaign of reconquest against the despised Royalists."
 sichuan.264.a: "\"Last stand of the rightful government of China...\""
 sichuan.264.b: "Regretfully, return the despondent Marshal."

 sichuan.265.t: "Marshal Wang Chengbin Resurfaces!"
 sichuan.265.d: "In our resounding triumph against the Zhili dogs, we were positive that the King of Baoding and the Jade Marshal had persihed, for their bodies littered the throne room. Ever a loyalist to Cao however, the previous Minister of the Army, Wang Chengbin, launched an immediate counterattack against the coup. With brutal fighting taking place in the streets of the capital, the demoralised, disorganised Zhili forces ultimately crumbled to our elite Imperial Guards let by Xiqia. Rebounding however, Marshal Wang would carry on his fruitless, pointless struggle against the Son of Heaven.\n\nWaging a fighting retreat from north of the Yellow River, Wang would fight a bitter, even admirable, supposed last stand within the Jade Marshal's old Headquarters of Luoyang. With his soldiers rather dying than giving up the city, they ultimately forced our hand in the civil war, resulting in the nigh flattening of Luoyang. Presuming to have perished in the fighting, many of our sources supposedly confirmed such statements. However with the civil war continuing elsewhere under the likes of Liu Zhenhua, Xiao Yaonan and Zhang Qihuang, we could hardly spare the manpower to count the bodies.\n\nWith rumours having surfaced in the Capital that the King of Baoding's most staunch ally and friend escaped to Sichuan, it would appear that the Marshal managed to sway [SZC.GetLeader] to his side. Attempting to mount one last, final campaign of reconquest to oust our Mandate, the Zhili Clique have proven themselves an exceedingly resilient opponent. Despite controlling a famine and civil war province largely considered a backwater, the Zhili still retain a large amount of their forces, and have the sheer willpower to see their campaign through."
 sichuan.265.a: "That blasted Marshal of Tianjin!"
 sichuan.265.b: "Their cause has merit!"

 sichuan.266.t: "Growing Rifts"
 sichuan.266.d: "Long a component of the internal politics of the Zhili Clique, the Clique itself is distinctly split amongst numerous lines. The North Zhili, under the auspices of the late Cao Kun, Wu Peifu and Wang Chengbin. The South Zhili, under the whims of Sun Chuanfang and Qi Xieyuan. Even within those branches, there lies intra-personal faction dynamics. The North has its Luoyang and Jinbao factions, belonging to Wu and Cao. The South has the dispensable loyalties of all of Sun Chuanfang's underlings. And even then, there remains the crucial split between the men of guns and the men of words.\n\nWhen the Zhili Clique restored their control of Beijing in the late 1920s, the Zhili Clique would formally attempt to organise themselfs into a legitimate government. With the majority of the men of words taking positions within the Assembly and Cabinet, the men of guns would resign themselves to controlling Provinces, and their own sections of the provincial and central armies. Following the death of Cao and Wu however, the intricate balance and relationships between the military and political wings of the Clique has been torn apart.\n\nWith Wu and Cao reigning in their respective wings, their absence has led to the drawing of daggers between the likes of Marshal Wang and his suited contemporaries. Exile further straining relations, the civilians have gathered themselves around the magnanimous Yan Huiqing. A senior diplomat, bureaucrat, former Prime Minister and President, he has begun to frequently argue with Wang Chengbin and the rest of the Zhili Military Apparatus over the best course of action for the future of their governance. Due to their conflict, many within the former Sichuan provincial government fear that a deep rift is beginning to open."
 sichuan.266.a: "We cannot be divided now!"

 sichuan.267.t: "Ascension of the Diplomat"
 sichuan.267.d: "A curiosity amongst the inner circles of the Zhili Clique, many within the internal patronage network actually consider Yan Huiqing to be that of an outsider. Having never formally been welcomed into the fold of the Zhili, Yan himself represents the prestigious, and mostly apolitical, diplomatic corps of the Beiyang Republic. Serving multiple times in a caretaker role as Prime Minister or President on behalf of the Zhili Clique, Yan has proven himself incredibly dilligent in regards to ensuring that Beiyang governments remain afloat.\n\nOnce again it would appear that Yan is necessary to maintain stability and prevent anarchy for the Zhili. Having managed to negotiate enough support, leveraging his extensive ties to the bureaucracy and spotless track record, Yan has utilised his position within the government to request from Marshal Wang that they pursue a civilian path, which Wang has accepted. Being elected to the position of President, in exile of course, alongside being joined by the likes of Gu Weijun, Bai Jianwu, Wang Kemin, Marshal Wang and Gao Lingwei amongst others, Yan Huiqing's government resembles that of one carefully balanced between Beiyang bureaucrats and Zhili diehards.\n\nWith the noble goal of asserting civilian control over the military, and preventing the foolish missteps that lead to the Manchu Coup in the first place, many are hopeful of their goals. Albeit many are equally sceptical that they will accomplish anything of note."
 sichuan.267.a: "We must learn from our mistakes."

 sichuan.268.t: "The Rise of the Scion of Tianjin"
 sichuan.268.d: "The Third Hierarch. The Scion of Tianjin. Minister of the Army. Marshal of the Republic. Traitor to the Zhili. Wang Chengbin retains numerous monikers of mixed sentiments. Lacking the national respect and loyalty of the Jade Marshal, Wang has always played second fiddle to Wu Peifu. Yet Wang was perhaps the only man Wu Peifu feared, for he genuinely threatened his position within the Zhili Clique, having been a companion of Cao Kun longer than Wu had been. Putting everything on the line to aid his mentor, Wang would ultimately be relegated to soft retirement due to Wu's machinations, resulting in Wang's treachery in the Beijing Coup of 1924.\n\nReturning to the fold during the third ZhiFeng War, Wang would prove himself to be President Cao Kun's most loyal advocate within military circles, acting as his mouthpiece and an ever present reminder of the King of Baoding's looming network over the military apparatus. And on that day, Wang was one of the few suspicious of the buildup towards the eventful coup attempt, colluding with the Jade Marshal over reports of strenuous troop manoeuvres. And yet he could feasibly do nothing to save his mentor, or the reviled Wu Peifu. Consumed by himself, he would nonetheless order a relentless counter-attack attempting to squash the rebellion before it gained any steam.\n\nUltimately futile, now here he is, a vengeful spirit, a dead man walking. Having shot up to the forefront of the Zhili Hierarchy, Wang commands the admiration of the full essence of the Jinbao Clique, and even some members of the Luoyang Clique curry favour with the Marshal of Tianjin. Utilising his now legendary status, Wang managed to force the civilians under Yan Huiqing to kowtow to the military's primacy in such an emergency situation. Promising a swift retribution towards the fledging, paltry Manchu forces to the Remnant High Command, many within the Clique and the nation are preparing for the last ride of the Zhili Clique."
 sichuan.268.a: "Rip and tear...until it is done."

 sichuan.269.t: "New Blood in New Water"
 sichuan.269.d: "Utterly demolished beyond repair, having lost both its Head and Second-in-Command, the Zhili Clique Guanxi system has been thrown into complete disarray following the Coup attempt. Able to muster some semblance of authority, at least enough to mount an admirable resistance in lieu of the Jade Marshal, Wang Chengbin's new position as the absolute authority of the North Zhili Clique has only recently been cemented, with the acquiescence of all other potential claimants, such as that of Zhang Qihuang or Cai Chengxun.\n\nHowever what remains of the Zhili military hierarchy is a shambled corpse, riddled with bullet holes. Losing numerous officer in the fighting still, there has been a dire neccessitation for reform, modernisation and the elevation of youthful survivors to the forefront of military command. Blaming Wu Peifu's reluctance and inability to enact meaningful reforms in the high command due to believing in his perfect system of complete officer autonomy, Marshal Wang Chengbin has written letters to a series of commanders, requesting the names of exceptional individuals whom have proven themselves beyond the normal line of duty.\n\nUndertaking a massive reform effort in light of the exile, the Marshal has collaborated with the likes of Jiang Baili to implement and utilise his extensive military strategy knowledge in the hopes that the new doctrine will be enough to vanquish the nascent and inexperienced Royalist armies. Reflecting, one can only place faith in the loyalty and tenacity of the common soldier to see the Zhili's vengeance to fruition."
 sichuan.269.a: "Marching to the Future under Marshal Wang!"

 sichuan.270.t: "Resugence of the Zhili Clique?"
 sichuan.270.d: "Having long ruled China intermittently, from 1922 to 1924, and from 1927 to 1936, the Zhili Clique seemed as if it was the de-facto dominant power within the whole nation. With Beijing in its stranglehold, the most powerful man in China at its side, and the numerous connections utilised by Cao Kun, many believed that their rule would weather any storm. Although following the League Collapse, and the inaction of the Cabinet to intervene on the side of either the League or the Anti-Concessionists, the Royal Court utilised the negative popular sentiment, and the estrangement of the Zhili's German benefactors, in order to spur an opportunity to eradicate the hydra at its head.\n\nAnd so the Manchu Princes and the Zongshe party would doubt the tenacity, stubborness and willpower of the Zhili Clique. Rallying around the now infamous Marshal of Tianjin, Wang Chengbin, the Zhili would greatly wound the Manchu Government as they fought a delayed retreat into neighbouring provinces. Willing to sacrifice self and soul in order to prevent the return of an absolutist monarchy, the numerous last stands in the Zhili-Manchu Civil War was reminiscent of the Xinhai Revolution. Dying as martyrs for their cause, the Manchu would treat them with extreme prejudice. Eradicating villages and whole cities to ensure the annihilation of the Zhili Clique.\n\nHowever here they are, the [SZC.GetName], representatives of the steel defiance of the Zhili Clique. Under the auspices of [SZC.GetLeader], they have reached out to [ROOT.GetLeader] with a peculiar offer. Proposing an equal pact of loyalty and co-belligerence, they desire a collaborative effort to oust the Manchu menace from Beijing, and restore the true authority of the Xinhai Revolution's former republican glory."
 sichuan.270.a: "Of course! Old friends must stick together in trying times."
 sichuan.270.b: "You were beaten back once, who's to say it won't happen again?"

 sichuan.271.t.accept: "[FROM.GetName] has accepted our request!"
 sichuan.271.d.accept: "Seeing the wisdom in our request, and perhaps admiring our ambitions, our tenacity, our ferocity, [FROM.GetName] has willingly accepted our request for a co-belligerence agreement. Pledging their soldiers, their weapons, and their government towards our cause of joint eradication against the Manchu upstarts, we will soon see the return of a true, revolutionary and republican Chinese government! Zhonghua Minguo Wansui!"
 sichuan.271.a: "A toast to our new compatriots!"

 sichuan.271.t.refuse: "[FROM.GetName] has rejected our request!"
 sichuan.271.d.refuse: "The weak fools in [FROM.GetName] have, perhaps out of cowardice or fear of reprisal from Beijing, utterly refused our request for a common co-belligerence agreement. Whilst not devastating to the Anti-Manchu cause, it clearly showcases that [FROM.GetName] has absolutely no intentions of following in the footsteps of the revolutionary martyrs that bled and suffered for the resolution of Xinhai. No matter! With the Marshal of Tianjin we shall crush the perfidious Manchu, and then these inept stragglers!"
 sichuan.271.b: "Your time will come!"

 sichuan.272.t: "The Zhili Clique Returns"
 sichuan.272.d: "After the assassination of Wu Peifu and Cao Kun in Beijing during the Manchu Coup and the subsequent collapse of the Zhili Clique, most consigned the former warlord alliance to the dustbin of history. Yet, recent developments have cast doubt upon these assumptions.\n\nRumours swirl that Marshal Wang Chengbin, thought dead after the fall of Luoyang, miraculously survived Luoyang and allied himself with the province's governor [SZC.GetLeader] - a former ally of Wu Peifu. Both leaders are now rallying the disparate Zhili remnants that fled the North after the Coup and already anti-Manchu propaganda has begun to spread into the surrounding provinces. It seems the Zhili Clique is far more resilient than it was given credit for."
 sichuan.272.a: "Do they ever give up?"
 sichuan.272.b: "A new threat to the Manchu."

 sichuan.273.t: "Arrival of a Comrade"
 sichuan.273.d: "Ever a sturdy, adaptable grouping of durable commanders and soldiers, the Zhili Clique has handled nigh destruction numerous times in its history, and has always returned stronger. During the Second ZhiFeng War, the Clique first faced absolute annihilation. With Feng Yuxiang and Wang Chengbin's defection spurring on the 1924 Beijing Coup, it would see the capture of Cao Kun, the expulsion of Wu Peifu and the majority of his command staff, with the last remnants of Zhili control remaining within the hands of Hubei Governor Xiao Yaonan.\n\nEven at that point, the Clique rejuvenated themselves, with Wu seeking refuge with Zhao Hengti, retaking Henan Province, and recapturing Zhili province with the additional aid of Fengtian. And again, when the all consuming torrent of revolutionary fervour, the National Revolutionary Army, marched northwards to expel all warlords, of any allegiance, the North and South Zhili alongside Fengtian banded together to form the Anguojun. Cao Kun, utilising his connections and wit, negotiated German intervention, and the rest was history.\n\nPresumptuously here we are again, with the core Zhili Clique and the Cabinet fleeing to Sichuan, none were aware of the true extent of the Clique's losses. Presumably, many had their flames extinguished in the fighting. Early this morning, however, a general and some of his retainers have straggled into Chengdu, carrying with them armaments, and a small reserve of gold."
 sichuan.273.a: "Your time is not over yet!"

 sichuan.274.t: "Luoyang Retaken"
 sichuan.274.d: "The wreckage, the carnage, the bloodshed. Marshal Wang and his other compatriots are all too familiar with the scene of Luoyang not too long ago. Long an ancient, core cradle of Chinese civilisation, Luoyang as it stands is but a shell of its former self. With history dating back to the Classical Era, Luoyang was even the capital of numerous dynasties, such as that of the Eastern Han, becoming the focal point of China for decades. With such a stature however, Luoyang has seen numerous hardships, numerous destructions, pillaging, the whole ensemble of devastation.\n\nEver since the Yuan dynasty, Luoyang's status as the \"Middle Capital\" and the natural legal capital was much reduced, having been razed completely numerous times. Nonetheless, modern Luoyang was once again a nexus of importance. Considered the headquarters of the Jade Marshal, it garnered significant attention during the Second ZhiFeng war, and all ensuing conflicts between the Zhili and its enemies.\n\nDespite its historical status however, that did not prevent the zealous Royalist soldiers from nigh razing Luoyang once again. With Marshal Wang holding his presumed last stand in the city, the Royalists responded with extreme prejudice and force. Now that we've retaken the province however, it is clear the raw devastation that the Manchu have wrought in their fury. The first step in the reclamation of China, and it is bittersweet.\n\nNonetheless, the Zhili have a duty to preserve, and order to reinstitute, and the capture of Luoyang is a fantastic propaganda victory for our nation's morale."
 sichuan.274.a: "If only Wu could see us now!"

 sichuan.275.t: "The Fall of Wuchang"
 sichuan.275.d: "Another one of the Zhili's tremendous strongholds, Wuhan (the collective name for Wuchang, Hankou and Hanyang) was not spared the ferocity of Royalist forces in their bloodlust to drive the Zhili out of the Central Plains. With history dating back to the Shang Dynasty, in its hallowed ground lies 3500 years of Chinese culture and civlisation. One of the key hotspots of ancient Confucianism, it spurred on the \"Wenjin Academy\", which is known as the \"the oldest existing university in China\", lying similarly amongst the ranks of Yuelu Academy in Hunan, or Donglin Academy in Jiangsu.\n\nTruly flourishing and setting the stage for the modern city in the Three Kingdoms period, the city transformed into a cultural and economic hub along the Yangtze. The seat of many opposition regimes, it truly became a renowned market for merchants, as its unique position straddling the Yangtze and the Han River resulted in it being the natural meeting point between traders all across Central China. Even garnering the nickname \"Chicago of the East\" in reference to the industrial, financial, transportation and cultural importance of Chicago to America.\n\nFairly prosperous and spared from much retribution compared to other Chinese hubs of development, Wuhan would nonetheless become the site of the greatest battle of the last century. With Hankou and Hanyang falling to advancing National Revolutionary Armies in the Northern Expedition, Wuchang itself would continue to resist. Following German intervention, and the internal politicking of the Kuomintang, the National Revolution would tear itself apart, allowing for the forces of Wu Peifu, Xiao Yaonan and the Southern Zhili to extinguish the Kuomintang remnant forces.\n\nWith out forces now capturing such an ancient, and beloved industrial city, our soldiers have begun to praise the seizure as a repeat of the \"Miracle of 1927\", with Marshal Wang being heralded as a military genius. Already there is a growing sense that our path is a righteous one, and that we will soon retake the Northern Capital, and restore the rightful rule of the Zhili once and for all."

 sichuan.276.t: "The Fall of Beijing"
 sichuan.276.d: "Perhaps the most pivotal, valued, and internationally known city in all of China, Beijing's history dates back 3000 years, and its role both in our catapult to power, and in our downfall, is with no equal. The earliest events of Beijing's history however, are shrouded in myth and legend, with the first event in its history retaining historical backing being the deposure of the last Shang King by King Wu of Zhou. Long a seat of power within the north, Beijing's history is marred by raids from frontier nomads, and the continued construction of even more elaborate defences to defend against them.\n\nIronically, Beijing would first be placed onto the map of significance under the guise of \"Nanjing\" for the Liao Dynasty's seat of power was in present-day Inner Mongolia. Under Liao rule the city developed gigantically, becoming a cultural hotspot of Khitan, Xi, Shiwei, Balhae and Han. Later becoming \"Zhongdu\", or the \"Central Capital\" under the Jin, the city would once again see a doubling in its size, and rapid development. Yet it would see the most advance under the Yuan dynasty.\n\nWith Kubali Khan dubbing it \"Dadu\", or \"Grand Capital\", it would become the seat of power for the whole of China. Finally, it would gain the moniker of \"Beijing\" in 1403, under the Ming dynasty. Flourishing under the Ming and Qing, Beijing's integral importance to Modern Chinese culture would cemented, becoming the most sought after city in the Warlord Era. The seat of the Beiyang Republic and all of its faculties, whomever ruled Beijing ruled China.\n\nAnd so it is clear, with the recapturing of the Northern Capital, that once again the Zhili have resuscitated the Republican dream. Vanquishing the Royalist defenders, our elite forces managed to methodically sweep through the city's streets, resulting in a desperate last stand within the Forbidden City, reminiscent of the last stands held in the Liao, the Ming and the Qing. Nonetheless, [SZC.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] has erupted in a bouquet of celebrations as the last remnants of a bygone era are deposed once more!"

 sichuan.277.d: "Finally our forces managed to break into the heavily fortified Forbidden City. Inundated with the elite, devoted and zealous forces of the Imperial Guard, several layers of defense lay before our brave soldiers. With the majority of our forces, diverted to other fronts or otherwise clearing out the streets of Beijing from its decadence, only a small grouping of several detachments were dispensed with sieging and taking the Imperial Court. Under the local authority of Guo Jijiao, an exceptional young commander with a flood of potential, he devised an excellent strategy of thorough sweeps between the halls and annals of the Palace and its external structures.\n\nExperiencing heavy casualties, but with morale overflowing, the brave men under Guo implemented a methodical search for the Boy Emperor and his clan. Encountering the likes of Jixing and Zaitao as exterior defenders, the two Manchu Princes would ultimately fall to advancing Zhili units. Leading a small squad, Guo would successfully excavate the throne room, finding Puyi hidden behind the Dragon Throne, cowering in fear. As they tried to drag him from the room his brother alongside his cousin, Princes Pujie and Xiqia, burst into the room with a few remaining guardsmen, attempting to suicidally prevent Guo from seizing the Emperor.\n\nHowever futile their last stand was, many brave men died in the exchange, with Guo even being wounded. Not withstanding, the Emperor has been captured, and his puppetmasters are dead! Whilst many of the more radical members of the military staff and cabinet are demanding blood for blood, Marshal Wang and Yan have soothed tempers. Recognising that Puyi was genuinely unaware of the original coup attempt, they have instead elected to throw Puyi into prison. For whilst he cannot be blamed for the death of Cao or Wu, his crimes against the Republic are numerous. Potentially in the future, he can be released, as a model citizen. Until then, he rots."

Many were lost in the perennial struggle, Republicans against the Monarchy. In the Zhili-Manchu War, in our reconquest, in Xinhai and the struggles thereafterwards. A nation of so much beauty, love and compassion, constantly at our kinsmen's throats over perfidious ideological convictions, power games, and the hunger of warlords. Under the miasma of it all, the ever encompassing consumption of conviction and rage, it is often understated that we're all human. Fellow Chinese. Are we not proud of our millenia old civilisation, having withstanded the test of time?\n\nInstead we squabble amongst ourselves, with revolt, civil war, whilst the foreign imperialists grow stronger ever more. The martyrs, our nation's heroes! Oh how bountiful their knowledge and majesty! Only they truly understood what was at stake. And only now do we fully understand their message. Attempting to construct a nation out of a shambling cadre of warlord militarists is not an easy task. President Cao and Marshal Wu knew this too well. And yet they numerate many of the dead in this struggle. The King of Baoding, decried as the Bribing President, a true patriot intending nothing more than to strengthen his nation. The Jade Marshal, despite his continued animosity with Marshal Wang, also carried with him a grandeur of nation-building.\n\nTo erect a monument out of the rubble of the Chinese Republic, to reconstruct it singlehandedly. That was their task, and they were wiped away too soon to see it to fruition. And so it falls to us, their descendents, to carry on the mission of our forebearers and allow the Five Races Under One Union to finally fly with pride. Commemorating this occasion of remembrance and reflection, [SZC.GetLeader] has instituted a day of mourning across the nation for those who sacrificed to see the Republic carry on. It is our only hope, our only desire, that their extinguishment was not in vain."

 sichuan.279.d: "With the mantle of the Beiyang Republic now upon our shoulders, it is unto us to carry forth its lofty dreams. Born out of idealism, born out of the hope for something better than the faithless monarchists, it ultimately bore no fruit. Torn apart by rabid militarists more keen to stuff their pockets and keep their influence than do their just and lawful service for the nation.\n\n\"No more! Today marks a new day in our nation's history! No more do we bow to militarists, to warlords! No more do we allow democracy to be placed in the guillotine! The monarchy is gone, and so too shall autocracy follow!\" Those were the words echoing from Huang Fu on the outskirts of the National Assembly in Beijing as of recent, following the announcement of a new Presidential Election. To be held swiftly, it is a hallmark moment in the Chinese nation's history. For it is the true test of the people's capacity to exert their will on the future of our nation. The Zhili of course, are all too familiar with the primacy of democracy as the most premier method by which the people grant their voice to the nation. Expected to also posit their own candidates within the election, many believe that the Zhili's candidates have a sure-fire spot to the Presidency.\n\nNonetheless that does not stop a myriad of parties and factions from proposing their own candidates. Within the Independents there lies the magnanimous Hu Shih, from Political Science there is the aforementioned Huang Fu, Xu Qin from the Constitutionalists alongside Liu Chongyou from the National Salvation Federation. All increasingly enwrapped in the promulgation of their presidential campaigns, the opposition collectively expect the announcement of the candidacy for the Harmony Association to occur soon."

Expecting his own merits and service to carry him to victory, he likely is correct in that assumption as carrying the torch during China's darkest hour is no small feat. Yet many within his inner circle are concerned that he may perhaps be opposed by a candidate at the behest of Marshal Wang's Tianjin faction.

 sichuan.282.d: "As is the spirit of the Begonia Flower, the election cycle as of recent was cordial, cautious and considerate. With even the most fiercely anti-Zhili candidates such as Huang Fu and Hu Shih acting with respect for the Clique. As even they acknowledge that without the Zhili's sacrifices, they would not even be standing in their current positions, and the Republic as we know it may very well have been squandered.\n\nIn light of this, the many delegates within the Assembly and Senate were the real figures to sway. With the majority of the Harmony Association either fleeing, being imprisoned or murdered in light of the Beijing Coup, their previous stranglehold in the organs of government is far from certain. And therefore a real chance for the opposition to seize the day presented itself. At least, that's what the newspapers and idealists believe.\n\nIn reality, the Chinese people and officials know all too well that whilst the opposition parties contributed their fair share to the reconstitution of the Beiyang Republic, it was the Zhili and Zhili alone that rallied for the Five Races Under One Union in defiance of Japanese lapdogs and autocratic Monarchists. To this end, the Election of [GetYear] whilst feasibly split between numerous candidates, really was isolated towards two. With the Baoding and Tianjin factions of the Zhili Clique propping up their preferred candidate, Gao Lingwei, the Luoyang faction alongside the \"technocrats\" of the Republic backed that of Yan Huiqing.\n\nAll to play for, the future of the Chinese Republic in this time of reconciliation is dependent on the strength and character of these two long-serving veterans of state.

Until such matters are concluded however, an interim period has been instituted by [ROOT.GetLeader].\n\nThe Zhili have endured worse, far worse, facing nigh extinction numerous times.

Whilst usually they would be immediately detained upon entering our borders, the Luoyang faction, Cabinet, and the rest of the civilians have put their political weight behind their amnesty.

On one side, there's Deng Xihou, a career officer mostly concerned with military theory, social reforms and rural development. On the other, there's Liu Wenhui, Liu Xiang's uncle, who is known for his dedication towards academic and administrative reform.\n\nTogether they form an equilibrium between traditionalism and reformism, having a good track record of working together. While having a system of balancing influences has saved the department from spiralling into the kinds of internal squabbling and feuding that has marked many other cliques in China, should this balance be broken and one said gain too much prominence over the other there's little doubt that the Baoding Department could fall victim to these kinds of problems as well. As such, care should be taken to preserve the diarchy and not have it become seen as yet another Chinese autocracy."

While no one can doubt that Sichuan has some of the most well-drilled soldiers in China and that Deng has had great successes in helping out those in the countryside, this has come at the expense of other areas of reform. Indeed, the emphasis of one over the other has led to the administrative side being neglected.

Indeed, while no one doubts that he's had successes in his fields, this has come at the expense of an army nearing disarray and a rural population faring little better now than they did before the civil war. In light of this, Deng and other high-ranking members of the department are urging a swift change of course towards the balance that has previously been the hallmark of the department. If this doesn't happen, there's a certainty that a more drastic course correction measure will be seen."

In the wake of the routing of the Baoding Department during the war, Wenhui was able to escape to his power base in the mountainous region of Xikang, just to the east of Tibet. While the remnants of the Baoding force are badly scarred by their loss in the civil war, the sheer distance between Chongqing and Wenhui's mountain stronghold makes a swift military victory unlikely. The logistical nightmare of such a venture alone makes it unthinkable without serious preparations.\n\nOne way or another, this situation will need to be resolved if Liu Xiang is to fully consolidate his victory."

As time goes by, Wenhui will grow stronger, making the already difficult task of invading his mountainous stronghold more difficult with each day that passes.\n\nLiu Xiang must now decide how to deal with his wayward uncle.

He wants to see his dreams of a new Sichuan be realised under Xiang's rule. With widespread social and educational reforms that don't fully align with Xiang's own vision for Sichuan.

Wenhui clearly doesn't trust his nephew and Xiang isn't pleased with the sacrifices he has been forced to commit to in order to secure this deal. Hands were shook, a picture was taken for the press and the meeting ended almost as soon as it started.\n\nWhile the situation isn't ideal, the truce seems to hold for now.

Either remove him through underhanded means, or prepare for an invasion of Xikang itself and evict Wenhui from his little mountain kingdom."

 sichuan.405.d: "While Ya'an's remoteness from the rest of Sichuan has spared it from the worst of the civil war's violence, any illusions of it lasting were dashed today as Xiang fired the first shots in the war between him and his uncle.\n\nThe city hall which had become Wenhui's de-facto headquarters since assuming power was the scene of the attempted crime. With only a narrow window to take him out, an assassin opened for on him with a scoped Gewehr 98k rifle from a nearby building as Wenhui exited his car on the short way to the building itself. It was a brazen act that nearly succeeded. As luck would have it though, the shot miraculously missed Wenhui by a mere fraction of an inch, leaving a mark as it passed near the very fabric of his uniform but spared the warlord from any injuries. His personal bodyguards then quickly covered him and rushed him into the building, leaving the sniper with no hopes to succeed with a second shot.\n\nThe tight security in the city meant that the culprit was apprehended by soldiers before he could escape. On pain of death, he confessed to everything, as if an admission of Xiang's involvement was really needed at this point. Absolutely furious at the cowardice and brazenness of his nephew for trying to kill him, Liu Wenhui ordered his forces into full war readiness. It seems that war will have to resolve this matter now."

 sichuan.406.d: "Early this morning, the restructured remnants of the Baoding Department under the leadership of Liu Wenhui invaded the Sichuanese basin. After the attempt on his life, this was seen as an inevitability. Knowing that an invasion was imminent, Xiang had ordered his troops to prepare for the inevitable, meaning that it wasn't long until the two armies met.\n\nThe first battle took place between the bulk of Wenhui's forces and a few smaller brigades of troops from the Industrial Corps sent to guard the long border with Wenhui's domain. The length of this border, however, meant that Xiang had a hard time creating a defensive strongpoint, meaning that this force was mostly meant to hold off the invasion long enough to fall back once the rest of the Industrial Corps had mobilised and prepared for a counter-attack. The battle would be a draw, with Xiang's soldiers being forced to withdraw sooner than expected, but hampering the advance of Wenhui enough to prevent them from overrunning the basin. The war is far from over however and for now it seems like either side can win this."

 sichuan.407.d: "As expected, the march on Ya'an was proving to be a difficult venture. As soon as his forces entered Xikang, they were met with prepared defences in the mountains with few roads to speak of, meaning that even small squads with machine guns and mortars could hold off Xiang's forces for hours and inflict debilitating losses upon them as narrow roads were turned into kill zones. Be that as it may, the Industrial Corps marches on, evidently determined to take the mountains by force no matter the costs."

 sichuan.408.t: "Two Lius' War"
 sichuan.408.d: "What started out as border skirmishing quickly developed into the two standing armies trying to advance into one-another's territory. A back and forth followed, as neither side was initially able to gain a clear advantage over the other. While the Industrial Corps is stronger on paper, their task of taking Ya'an is a daunting one to say the least. Once more, Sichuan has fallen into a bloody civil war."

 sichuan.409.t: "The Two Lius' War"
 sichuan.409.d: "After the victory of the Industrial Corps in the recent Sichuanese civil war, the ambitious and aggressive Liu Xiang rose to power. Many observers both at home and abroad saw this as a worrisome development as few believe even for a second that his lust for power will stop at his own border. Recently, however, an opportunity to remove him has shown itself.\n\nThere is a known rivalry between Liu Xiang and his uncle Liu Wenhui, the latter still controlling large portions of the remnants of the Baoding Department which fought in the last civil war. This rivalry has now turned into yet another civil war between the two. While it's certain to harm Xiang's ambitions regardless of outcome, this does present the opportunity to bring the far less aggressive Baoding Department to power. Perhaps we should tip the scales of the conflict by providing covert aid to Liu Wenhui's efforts to oust his nephew?"

 sichuan.410.d: "The rush to war seems to have had unintended consequences for the Industrial Corps. Tian the turncoat has switched sides numerous times in the past and served every master known to Sichuan. While a backstabbing opportunist, his considerable personal force has still allowed him to scrape by. It seems that now, however, he's officially declared himself loyal to the Baoding Department once more and sided with them, as he did over a decade ago. Why he had this convenient change of heart in the middle of a war is anyone's guess, but anyone that knows this snake ought to know that it likely won't be his last."
 sichuan.410.a: "Traitor!"

 sichuan.411.t: "The Battle of Meishan"
 sichuan.411.d: "Regardless of who shot first, the Baoding remnants weren't going to survive for long if they advanced into the basin. As such, they had been predominantly relied on the harsh terrain of Xikang to wear down the Industrial Corps. They could hold off the superior enemy forces with relative ease and few numbers by simply funnelling them through prepared defences. While this slowed them down, this was a war of attrition where one side was able to replace their losses while Xikang was devoid of an industrial base.\n\nEventually, the slow push by the Industrial Corps put the bulk of their forces outside of the city of Meishan, the last major strategic obstacle on the road to Ya'an. While Baoding had bought themselves plenty of time to prepare their defences, they were clearly in an unenviable position as they fought an enemy that, on paper, was superior. It had, however, been withered down by attrition and a portion of the heavy equipment was still being transported through the mountain passes.\n\nLiu Xiang must now choose: mount a full-on assault without the support of the department's heavy equipment, or wait for it to arrive and utilise it to full effect. Attacking now should provide a good chance for surprise, but it's a risky gamble against the city's prepared defences. On the other hand, it would at the very least take several days to bring the artillery pieces to the front, giving Baoding valuable time to prepare."
 sichuan.411.a: "Storm the city now!"
 sichuan.411.b: "Wait for reinforcements before attacking."

 SZC_meishan_assault: "The mountains were their only ally. With them behind us, they have nothing. They're poorly supplied, disorganised and under-equipped. Even without our heavy guns, we should have enough firepower to make short work of them. Once we storm the city, their defences are sure to crumble before the might of the Industrial Corps."
 SZC_meishan_reinforce: "Although they're in a difficult position, without our artillery to take out their cannons and machine guns we'll endure staggering losses. Although getting them here will prove very difficult given the terrain, more cautious officers believe it's well worth the effort."

 sichuan.412.t: "The Assault on Meishan"
 sichuan.412.d: "Choosing to attack right away, the Industrial Corps was pitted against the city's defenders without their heavy equipment. Even without them however, the divisions had many more mortars, machine guns and light cannons to prove a match for the city's defenders. Baoding had already lost most of their heavy equipment in the first phase of the civil war that saw Xiang take Chengdu. With little chance to replace these losses, the city's defences were rather simple, all told. Trenches, old machine guns and rifles made up the bulk of them, with an occasional cannon forming a handful of strong points in a wedge outline.\n\nAlthough Xiang's forces faced heavy losses in taking the city, the main defensive line was broken within hours of fighting. Wenhui wasn't a brilliant strategist by any stretch of the imagination and his primitive defensive lines offered few surprises for the attackers. After the centrepiece of the defensive line was broken, the Industrial Corps swarmed into the city and shattered the remaining defences from the sides. Although Liu Wenhui managed to escape, prisoners of war already tell that morale is low and that even he has no hopes of winning."
 sichuan.412.a: "The family feud will soon have a winner."

 sichuan.413.t: "The Xikang Rout"
 sichuan.413.d: "While opting to wait, not only did Xiang give the defenders more time to prepare, but his forces were constantly subjected to harassment by Baoding forces in the mountains. Getting supplies to the front was a logistical nightmare and many of the artillery pieces being moved were damaged or lost to the perilous mountain roads as Xiang had ordered haste to go before safety.\n\nOnce the attack was ready, the few artillery pieces that made it to the front did not make much of a difference. Xiang's forces had been withered down by the thousands through attrition, both at the hands of the mountains and rear-guard actions by Baoding. It was a demoralised force that eventually attacked the well-prepared defences and the losses suffered to nature quickly showed. While the defences around the city were an unimaginative imitation of Weltkrieg-era fortifications, the few cannons and machine guns that Wenhui possessed were able to hold the line against the enemy, albeit narrowly. After several successive assaults, the city had been damaged, the defences were badly battered, but Xiang's vanguard had been destroyed. Thousands laid dead on the ground, many more were injured or taken prisoner.\n\nWith no hopes of taking the city, Xiang is now forced to retreat from Xiking. While no force in Sichuan was able to match the Industrial Corps in the field, the Industrial Corps had finally been bested by the mountains themself more than anything else. As they retreated, it was a disaster akin to Napoleon's flight from Moscow as the terrain and pursuers kept withering down the once might Industrial Corps. There's already talk about a mutiny within the Industrial Corps and Xiang's future seems very uncertain."
 sichuan.413.a: "The family feud will soon have a winner."

 sichuan.414.t: "The First Naval Exercise"
 sichuan.414.d.landlocked: "Despite being a landlocked country, Liu Xiang insisted that a navy was of utmost importance. He envisioned a future where mighty ships that would rival the German Hochseeflotte in its finest days would patrol the Yangtze River and protect Sichuanese trade. The 'first steps towards greatness' have earned Sichuan complete naval dominance in the region, granted, but simply because no one bothered with contesting it. Nevertheless, a victory is a victory. Soon it was announced that a public display of this newly attained naval might was to be had. To impress the locals and terrify future foes, of course.\n\nThe public was invited to this first naval exercise showing off the strength of the Navy. The biggest warships on this part of the Yangtze were a handful of old steam-powered ships that had been hastily converted from their old civilian roles and pressed into military service. The makeshift warships had iron plates fitted onto them, as well as batteries of guns that had been taken from local artillery regiments and forcibly converted to fit this new role. Once the naval exercise kicked off in full force, it didn't take long before the obvious problems started to show up.\n\nSichuan's first admiral must've drawn a sigh of relief when the ships could actually move despite the increase in armour and armaments. Unbearably slowly, granted, but at least they didn't sink to the bottom of the river. It would all culminate into a triple gun salute, but when the old howitzers fired, the recoil of the shots nearly made the old steam ship capsize. Panic gripped the crew and several of them jumped off into the Yangtze, fearing that their ship would fully turn over. While their worst fears were not realised, this whole farce has led to a fair bit of ridicule as the narrowly avoided naval disaster led to more than a few satirical poems being written at Xiang's expense. While the people are laughing (at least when they're sure the secret police isn't around), the same can't be said for Xiang.\n\nOr Sichuan's first admiral, for that matter."
 sichuan.414.d.not_landlocked: "Despite Sichuan's humble beginnings as a landlocked province, Liu Xiang always insisted that a navy was of utmost importance. He envisioned a future where mighty ships that would rival the German Hochseeflotte in its finest days would patrol the South China Sea to protect Sichuan's growing status as a regional power. The 'first steps towards greatness' have not impressed the other naval powers in the region, granted, but Xiang has nonetheless earned the attention of the naval powers in the region, if only by virtue of actually managing to building a navy in the first place. To commemorate this, it was soon announced that a public display of this newly attained naval might was to be had. To impress the locals and terrify future foes, of course.\n\nThe public was invited to this first naval exercise showing off the strength of the mighty navy. The \"Grand Sichuanese Navy\" currently only consisted of old steam-powered ships that had been hastily converted from their old civilian roles and pressed into military service. The makeshift warships had iron plates fitted onto them, as well as batteries of guns that had been taken from local artillery regiments and forcibly converted to fit this new role. Once the naval exercise kicked off in full force, it didn't take long before the obvious problems started to show up.\n\nSichuan's first admiral must've drawn a sigh of relief when the ships could actually move despite the increase in armour and armaments.

 sichuan.414.a: "Admiral Kui, you're fired!"

 sichuan.415.t: "The Mighty Air Force"
 sichuan.415.d: "Today the first shipment of imported aircraft arrived in Chongqing for official inspection from none other than the triumphant Liu Xiang himself. The whole affair had a very ceremonial flair to it more than anything else, however. This was a way to show off the beginnings of Sichuan's so-called Mighty Air Force to the world, or at the very least the assembled Chinese press. While the triumphant bombast was over-the-top for the occasion, Xiang was right to mark this as an important occasion marking the modernisation of Sichuan and the province's rapid adoption of contemporary military technology and methods.\n\nThe planes were hardly anything spectacular by global military standards, granted. While they were fine machines in the Weltkrieg, the assembled collection of formerly mothballed holdovers would hardly cause the lords in Beijing to quake in their boots - nor the emperor in Tokyo, for that matter. By the standards of China's oft-neglected interior, however, these were a great leap into the twentieth century. Given the state of the regional powers, these handful of relics could fly over the mountains and gather information on enemy positions that would be very difficult to gather on foot. The often narrow terrains of mountain passes and openness of the basins meant that even a Weltkrieg-era holdover with a pair of synchronised machine guns could effectively harass infantry formations that had never faced a strafing run before.\n\nFor all his bluster about an air force that could dominate the skies over China, he might be very right, at least as far as his own backyard is concerned. All that said, pictures were taken of Xiang shaking the hands of pilots and engineers and the stories would be printed the following day."
 sichuan.415.a: "Mark my words, Sichuan shall rule the skies!"

 sichuan.416.t: "The Chongqing Air Parade"
 sichuan.416.d: "It wasn't long after the creation of Sichuan's 'mighty air force' that Liu Xiang declared that all of China and even the world was to tremble before its might. Eager to show to allies and enemies alike that Sichuan was to dominate the skies above China from here on out, the Chongqing Air Parade was hastily organised to demonstrate Sichuanese aerial dominance.\n\nWhile the air force itself was merely a collection of old interwar planes collecting dust in European and Japanese warehouses, it certainly impressed the crowds that had gathered to see the spectacle. After all, most of Sichuan's peasants and city-dwellers alike had scarcely even seen such flying machines in photographs. With this being the first time some of these pilots had set foot inside a cockpit, the air parade was a far cry from its counterparts in Canada and Germany and the rookie pilots would simply start and perform the most basic manoeuvres before landing, usually without any complications.\n\nSimple as it may have been, this was enough to draw applause from the crowds, many of whom were genuinely proud that their nation could boast such modern European airplanes. Towards the end of the show Xiang offered Pan Wenhua, the mayor of Chongqing, a chance to try flying along in one of the two-seat fighters. Pan, perhaps a bit weary from knowing just how inexperienced these pilots were, politely declined the offer, citing his busy schedule running the capital. His adjutant would get the honour in his place and thus the old fighter set off for the final display of the day, ordered by Xiang himself to push the plane to its limits. All remaining audience members saw the plane lift, but amazement soon turned into horror as black smoke started to pour out from the old plane's engine. The inexperienced pilot struggled to regain control of his plane as its altitude fluctuated back and forth until finally and tragically his attempts caused the plane's engine to stall, sending it down to the ground like a comet.\n\nBoth the pilot and the passenger died on the spot, to the shock and horror of the civilian and military members of the audience. It wasn't long afterwards that Pan, realising of just how narrowly he cheated death, started to quietly suspect that this had been an assassination attempt on him by the paranoid Liu Xiang. This caused discord in the alliance between him and Liu Xiang, not to mention region-wide ridicule at the farcical, yet tragic, air parade over the outskirts of Chongqing."
 sichuan.416.a: "Someone will be shot for this!"

 sichuan_industrial.18.t: "Liu Xiang Falls Ill"
 sichuan_industrial.18.d: "Today, Xiang gathered the general staff of Sichuan for a routine meeting. What started out as something as ordinary as a review of new uniforms and equipment took a turn for the bizarre, however, as Liu Xiang started to suddenly show signs of acute exhaustion. In the middle of a showing of new officer kits to be introduced in next year's army reform plan, the storied warlord suddenly collapsed onto the table, losing consciousness in the middle of the meeting.\n\nA military doctor was soon brought in and assessed that Xiang was suffering from a bad fever, but that it was impossible to tell what the issue is beyond these mere symptoms. The doctor advised that Xiang is to be taken to a hospital for further examination. However, the final decision on that lies with Xiang when he wakes up."
 sichuan_industrial.18.a: "Seek a medical professional."
 sichuan_industrial.18.b: "Don't bother, it'll pass soon."

 sichuan_industrial.19.t: "Death of Liu Xiang"
 sichuan_industrial.19.d: "After days of worsening health, Liu Xiang has died. While outwardly it points to natural causes, the suddenness of the disease raises suspicions of an attempt at assassination. Pan Wenhua, mayor of Chongqing and Lu Xiang's second in command, is now in control of Sichuan. Xiang's grandiose plans for the province are over, most likely."
 sichuan_industrial.19.a: "How convenient for general Wenhua..."

 sichuan.500.t: "Successful Civil Service Reforms"
 sichuan.500.d: "Sichuan province since the Xinhai Revolution developed a byzantine system because of the competing military and civilian cliques. With the Officer Department fully in charge, efforts were made to thoroughly reorganise the administration. The civil service in particular was thoroughly investigated, corrupt elements purged, capable hands hired to fill gaps and positions removed or shifted around for better efficiency. On the one hand, this disrupted the bureaucracy for quite some time, but visible improvements are already noted. It will take some more time, but the Sichuan civil service is on the way to becoming cleaner than ever."
 sichuan.500.a: "A renewed service, for a renewed province."

 sichuan.501.t: "Land Reform Shows Results"
 sichuan.501.d: "Land reform is a tricky field. On one hand, few in China would argue against its necessity. On the other, however, reformists struggle to find the needed support such an expensive and arduous project regardless of the long-term benefits. Plus, the landowners in rural communities are lukewarm about it at best, openly hostile at worst, with the peasants unable to do anything about it despite being the principal beneficiaries.\n\nThe Officer Department is pushing through the Land to the Tiller programme and while it has brought the provincial government significant expenses and temporary instability, their work is beginning to bear fruit. More land is being worked and more peasants actually own the land they work. Of course, the bar was low considering how thoroughly inadequate land distribution was beforehand, but visible progress is important to gauge the success of such an expensive programme."
 sichuan.501.a: "The first step of many."

 sichuan.502.t: "A New Currency for Sichuan"
 sichuan.502.d: "While there is a single currency for all of China on paper, this hasn't been true in reality for decades. Individual, provincial, national and foreign governments, as well as banks and so on, have been printing and minting currency independently with varying legality. Sichuan has had it particularly bad because of the various cliques fighting for control of the province. Monetary reform has entered a new stage with the Officers' takeover. With proper finances restored, inflation is being brought under control, useless currencies destroyed and illegal mints shut down. With currency issuing properly restored, economic stability is slowly being restored as the provincial government's ability to run finances improves."
 sichuan.502.a: "Another successful step forward."

 sichuan.503.t: "A Blow Against Corruption"
 sichuan.503.d: "Corruption is endemic throughout China and Sichuan province is no exception. Too many cliques, unscrupulous and ambitious strongmen have been fighting over the province for too long and rooting out corrupt elements has been a serious challenge for our well-meaning, but young administration. Despite disruptions being noted in the administration and sometimes confrontations between government forces and powerful criminal organisations or hired goons leading to violence and damage, the Officers openly boast about different corrupt figures being arrested and punished. These events, with news spread to the people as much as possible, are helping restore confidence in the administration and, more importantly, the rule of law as corruption and banditry attain record lows."
 sichuan.503.a: "You can't outrun the law. Not anymore."

 sichuan.504.t: "The First Session of the Assembly"
 sichuan.504.d: "The Federalists among the Officers have been working towards establishing a Provincial Assembly for Sichuan in the model of Guangdong province. Support from the pro-Nationalist faction has been lukewarm at first, but were convinced by the success of Song Qingling's democratic experiments in the MinGan zone.\n\nWith the opening of the Sichuan Provincial Assembly, delegates from the counties under Officer Department control were sent to attend and began work. Their first order of business was the drafting of a provincial constitution, also on the Guangdong model, which led to some debates between the Federalist and Kuomintang-aligned Officers. Nevertheless, the new assembly is proving to be a significant boost of legitimacy for the provincial government, helping them solidify their reputation among the people as true to their reformist promises."
 sichuan.504.a: "The first of many."

 sichuan.505.t: "Zhongchuan Military Act"
 sichuan.505.d: "The Zhongchuan Act was drafted by Xiong Kewu, inspired by Chen Jiongming, intending to downsize the army and demilitarise the province to reduce expenditures. The bloated armies in Sichuan have been a massive burden on the government and, more importantly, the people. The measure is meant to help restructure the provincial army and free up revenue for public works and social programmes. Since armed internal opposition has become marginal since the Officer Department's victory, it has become safe enough to implement such a radical step against warlordism and the remaining troops will focus on fighting bandits instead of each other."
 sichuan.505.a: "The army shall serve the people now."

 sichuan.506.t: "Army Reform Successful"
 sichuan.506.d: "The armies in Sichuan have been bloated during the Warlord Era, fighting among each other, murdering and looting indiscriminately. Reforms have been a necessity for many years, but none of the warring cliques in the province were willing to open themselves to attacks. With the power struggle over, the provincial army has been transferred back under the government's control and measures were taken to avoid the buildup of paramilitaries. With bloat reduced, funds can be put elsewhere while the remaining military budget can be used to modernise our forces and focus on combating banditry."
 sichuan.506.a: "A new army, for a new province."

 sichuan.507.t: "The End of Banditry"
 sichuan.507.d: "Banditry is inevitable when governments collapse and it has been endemic for years in Sichuan as the warlords struggled for control. Things became worse when rival cliques were defeated as those soldiers not integrated fled to the countryside and became bandits themselves. With reforms well-under way in the army and administration, the Provincial Army has been able to focus on rooting out the remaining bandit strongholds in the province and the latest campaign has been a major success. It won't be long before rule of law is restored across the entire province."
 sichuan.507.a: "A warzone no more."

 sichuan.508.t: "Parties Begin to Form"
 sichuan.508.d: "With the growing strength of the Provincial Assembly came the emergence of political parties to organise representatives along clear sets of policies. While the Officers remain relatively united, two major parties naturally formed around the main factions of the Department, the Federalists and the Nationalists.\n\nThe Self-Government Party is aligned with Chen Jiongming's Public Interest Party, or Zhigongdang (CZGP) and have largely adopted their platform, focusing on provincial and county-level democratisation and autonomy. Xiong Kewu is their chairman.\n\nThe pro-Kuomintang faction organised itself as the Three-Principles Party, or Sanmin Party, clearly united in their goal of implementing Sun Yat-sen's political theories. Lü Chao leads them as de facto head of Sichuan's Kuomintang.\n\nOutside of the question of provincial autonomy and their allegiance to different national parties, the two overlap significantly in terms of policy and a consensus government is likely."
 sichuan.508.a: "Democracy has arrived in Sichuan."

 sichuan.509.t: "The First Provincial Elections"
 sichuan.509.d: "It has long been a goal for the Federalists and the Kuomintang to introduce democracy in Sichuan and their efforts are paying off. The people of the province are about to elect their own representatives to the Provincial Assembly and, in turn, their own provincial government. Two parties are running and while they are likely to form a grand coalition regardless of the outcome, they are aligned with two different national parties.\n\nThe Federalists are running as the Self-Government Party and are aligned with Chen Jiongming's Public Interest Party (Zhigongdang, CZGP). They wish to implement Chen's Reconstruction Plan and join in his effort to turn China into a federal republic.\n\nThe Nationalists of the Kuomintang are under the Three-Principles Party and wish to implement a programme based on Sun Yat-sen's political theories. They are aligned with Song Qingling's faction within the Nationalist Party and want to support their efforts in unifying the country."
 sichuan.509.a: "The Kuomintang controls the Assembly."
 sichuan.509.b: "The Federalists control the Assembly."

 sichuan.510.t: "The [GetYear] Provincial Elections"
 sichuan.510.d: "The people of Sichuan are about to exercise their civic duty once more as new provincial elections have been called. The Federalists and Nationalists remain the two major parties with a chance of winning.\n\nThe Federalists are running as the Self-Government Party and are aligned with Chen Jiongming's Public Interest Party (Zhigongdang, CZGP). They wish to implement Chen's Reconstruction Plan and join in his effort to turn China into a federal republic.\n\nThe Nationalists of the Kuomintang are under the Three-Principles Party and wish to implement a programme based on Sun Yat-sen's political theories. They are aligned with Song Qingling's faction within the Nationalist Party and want to support their efforts in unifying the country."
 sichuan.510.a: "The Federalists control the Assembly."
 sichuan.510.b: "The Kuomintang controls the Assembly."

 sichuan.511.t: "Chen Jiongming Arrives in Sichuan"
 sichuan.511.d: "A few months ago, Chen Jiongming was ousted from Liangguang by [GXC.GetLeader] and fled with his trusted officers and closest supporters. Instead of going into exile to Hong Kong like in 1924, however, he instead made the trek from Guangzhou to Chongqing and arrived today, cheered by local Federalists.\n\nAfter briefly addressing the crowd to reaffirm that he had no intentions of abandoning the Federalist cause, he privately met with [SZC.GetLeader] to discuss the future.\n\nChen made it clear that he wanted to make Sichuan the new centre for the Federalist movement, being one of the few provinces left that had significant support, both with its government and people, for it. He promised that implementing the Guangdong model in Sichuan would help it not only recover, but prosper despite over a decade of misfortunes and the recent famine.\n\nWhile the promises seem lofty, Chen has extensive experience in provincial administration and a very good reputation, having turned Guangdong into one of the wealthiest provinces in China and, before that, governed Fujian with similar success. Among his entourage are experienced military officers and civil administrators, which Sichuan is in dire need of, making the deal quite convincing."
 sichuan.511.a: "Sichuan is a bastion of Federalism!"
 sichuan.511.b: "Federalism is dead. Send him away."

Like many others from his province, in 1910, he attended the Baoding Academy, which he then left when the Xinhai Revolution broke out in 1911. He then travelled to Shanghai, where he worked with Chen Qimei, Wang Jingwei, and Li Shizeng (prominent associates of Dr. Sun) until he was forced to flee to Sichuan in exile after Yuan Shikai took power.\n\nIn 1915, the National Protection War to resist Yuan's regime in Beijing broke out, and Lü joined fellow Sichuanese Xiong Kiwu as part of Cai E's army in Sichuan. When Chen Jiongming and the Federalist movement attempted to kick Sun Yat-sen out of Guangdong, Lü took the side of Sun and fought against his former comrade Xiong Kiwu for control of Sichuan. He then joined Sun in exile in Shanghai and returned with Sun in his return to Guangdong in 1923 and became one of Sun's trusted allies in the Kuomintang. During the doomed Northern Expedition, Lü represented the Sichuanese forces, and after the mission's failure, he fled back to his native Sichuan in exile once more. Yet, despite numerous defats, the revolutionary spirit installed within Lü never died out. Instead, he continued to bide his time, believing fervently in the principles illustrated by the late eternal premier of the Kuomintang. As he waited in exile under the Yang Sen regime that once again took control of Sichuan, he maintained his contacts with the Kuomintang throughout the country."

He became intrigued by the ideas of democracy and modernism presented by the West and lamented that China had fallen gravely behind the rest of the world. In 1903, he attended the Sichuan East Literature Hall and later became acquainted with revolutionaries such as Dai Jitao. After achieving the sponsorship of his uncle, Xiong went to study in Japan, where he met Sun Yat-sen and would later join Sun's Tongmenghui. After the Xinhai Revolution, Xiong served as commander of the Dahan Sichuan Military Government until 1913. Yuan Shikai and the Beiyang Government expelled Sun's forces from China, and Xiong was forced to flee to Japan in exile.\n\n Yet, the defeat did not deter Xiong from dreaming of a free China. In Japan and Southeast Asia, he raised funds for the revolution and returned to China to join Cai E in the victorious National Protection War against Yuan. Despite being comrades in the National Protection War, Xiong turned against his former ally Lü Chao in 1920 and successfully expelled him from the province with the help of the warlord Liu Cunhou. In that same year, he issued a firm declaration that the people of Sichuan would no longer play second fiddle to the Beiyang and Guangzhou Governments that had arisen in the chaos of the Warlord Period. This did not last long as Sichuan collapsed into civil war and Liu Cunhou joined forces with the Beiyang Government, and Xiong was once again forced to flee into exile. He then fled to Guangdong, joining the Chinese Kuomintang, and participated in its first Congress in 1924.\n\nXiong's brief stay in the Kuomintang ended in 1925 when he was betrayed by Wang Jingwei and Chiang Kai-shek on charges that he was colluding with the Chinese Federalist leader Chen Jiongming. After the Northern Expedition's failure and the Kuomintang's breakdown, Xiong returned home to Sichuan dissatisfied with political life. And yet his passion for republican ideals never died, and although he has not forgotten the betrayal of the KMT, he lends an open ear to the Chinese Federalists in Guangdong."

His background and connections allowed him to gain prominence when the Xinhai Revolution occurred.

While he is a competent enough military leader, the fact that Yang Sen owes much of his success to dealmaking and supporting the right people at the right time has put him and the Armament Department in a precarious position. His position is further undermined by his own lifestyle contradicting what he claims to be best for Sichuan, which has limited his public support. For instance, he would earn the ire of more conservative elements of Sichuan by speaking out against traditional roles for women and practices such as foot binding, and would then squander any goodwill he might have gotten from reformists by having eight concubines of his own and as many as thirty children between them.\n\nDespite his many imperfections, he's managed to hold on to power thus far with enough support both from the army and common folk to be a force to be reckoned with.

Joining a military unit in 1906, Tang would enter the Sichuan Army Speed Training School, entering a class with the likes of Pan Wenhua, Liu Xiang, Wang Zanxu and Yang Sen. Having been a fellow soldier of the 33rd Brigade with Pan wenhua, the duo would ultimately end up in the service of their old friend Liu Xiang.\n\nAssisting Liu much akin to Pan, Tang advised the former during Cai E's invasion into Sichuah in 1916, allowing Liu to win numerous victories over the Yunnanese. Always ambitiously desiring his next promotion, Tang would grow dissatisfied as he consistently had to endure living in Liu Xiang's shadow.\n\nNevertheless, Tang continues to advise Liu Xiang on military matters, providing an able subordinate, despite his lofty ambitions.§!"
