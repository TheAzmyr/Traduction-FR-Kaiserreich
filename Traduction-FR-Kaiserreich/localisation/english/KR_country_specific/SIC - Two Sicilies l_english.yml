 SIC_pretty_much_feudalism_desc: "Ever since the invasion of the Lombards, our lands have been dominated by large-scale landholders.

 SIC_apenini: "Arditi degli Appennini"
 SIC_apenini_desc: "The mountainous region in the border with the Syndicalist-controlled areas will be a crucial battleground. As will be the Alps, once we are forced to face the French menace. Our elite troops, heirs of the surviving Alpini of the Royal Italian Army, will gallantly serve again."
 SIC_fusilero: "Sicilian Marine Corps"
 SIC_fusilero_desc: "Our navy can ensure superiority in the seas; with that advantage, we will strike at the coastlines of the Syndicalists and reclaim Italy for the Italians."
 SIC_army_reform: "Consolidate Division Structures"
 SIC_army_reform_desc: "Our army is still in many ways a mish-mash of militias, old Federal Italian divisions, conscripts and foreign volunteers. Organising it into an effective fighting force will be a complicated task."
 SIC_army_innovation: "Support Army Reformists"
 SIC_army_innovation_desc: "A small clique of generals is planning audacious reforms to our military structure and planning. Perhaps allowing them to have their voice heard is in our best interest."
 SIC_he_protecc: "Defensive Stance"
 SIC_he_protecc_desc: "We are hopelessly outnumbered by the Third Internationale. The best course of action is to defend our perimeter defences until the time is right to strike down the Syndicalists in a devastating counteroffensive."

 SIC_coastal_batteries: "Coastal Batteries"
 SIC_coastal_batteries_desc: "The perfidious Syndicalists will no doubt be frustrated by our effective resistance and will attempt many naval landings against us to seize key ports and supply lines of our kingdom. We will have especially large and modern guns as a special welcome gift, as planned."

 SIC_development: "The Future of the Mezzogiorno"

 SIC_agrarian_issue: "The Agrarian Question"
 SIC_agrarian_issue_desc: "Ever since the invasion of the Lombards, our lands have been dominated by large-scale landholders.

 SIC_theshipyardmatter: "The Shipyard Matter"
 SIC_theshipyardmatter_desc: "Sicily has, for more than a decade, greatly profited from the use of its large drydocks to sell warships to various nations in these troubled times.

 SIC_seize_existing: "Nationalise Shipyards"
 SIC_seize_existing_desc: "By seizing the shipyards for our own use and cancelling ship orders, we can immensely increase our naval production capacity!"
 SIC_merchant_marine: "Expand Port Facilities"

 SIC_naval_moderniazation: "Naval Modernisation"

 SIC_heavy_buildup: "Heavy Buildup"
 SIC_heavy_buildup_desc: "We need more ships, capable of beating back the Syndicalist scum and ensure they meet a watery grave deep in Neptune's realm. Not small, puny escort ships, but the great towering barrages of flagships will win us the sea."
 SIC_bb: "New Dreadnoughts"
 SIC_bb_desc: "Our current dreadnoughts are old; some almost relics that should be kept in Museums in peaceful times. If we don't make new, better dreadnought designs, our navy's performance will simply fall short."
 SIC_carry: "Carrier Experiments"
 SIC_carry_desc: "The idea of a Ship Carrier isn't new, but how to make it function properly and how to produce such a gargantuan ship are entirely alien concepts to our shipbuilders, and efforts will be made to remedy that failing."
 SIC_shbb: "Flagship Designs"
 SIC_shbb_desc: "The Kingdom needs a new Flagship; a fully armed and operational dreadnought capable of laying waste to a Syndicalist port in a matter of hours. To make this goal a reality, our top experts in many related fields will tirelessly work to ensure peace reigns in the seas, supported by superior firepower."
 SIC_smaller_navy: "Strategic Navy"
 SIC_smaller_navy_desc: "Our navy cannot stand up alone in an open battle to the Internationale. Instead, we will use it to protect our coastlines, and focus on the production of smaller ships and commerce raiding to protect our ageing capital ships and damage their economies, respectively."

 SIC_medit_tactics_desc: "Naval Warfare in the Mediterranean is not a simple affair, nor can it be compared to that of the Open Sea. Control of coastlines and ports, and of the skies, will be fundamental, as our capacity to plan naval campaigns and expeditions."
 SIC_subs: "Submarine Effort"
 SIC_subs_desc: "Our quest to naval dominance may well be reliant on more indirect means. Through submersible warfare, we will ensure our capacity to keep a naval presence even in areas which would be conventionally inaccessible by our forces."
 SIC_barbones_air_tree: "Air Force Reform"
 SIC_barbones_air_tree2: "Aerial Supremacy"
 SIC_barbones_air_tree3: "IMAM Subsidies"
 SIC_barbones_air_tree_desc: "Our air force is small and untrained, and Southern Italy's aircraft industry isn't very well developed. Fortunately, the 1923-founded Industrie Meccaniche e Aeronautiche Meridionali, commonly referred to as IMAM, is a rising star in the sector. Supporting its growth could only benefit us."
 SIC_barbones_air_tree2_desc: "To truly win the war that approaches, we must ensure that the skies of our great Kingdom are under our control at all times."
 SIC_barbones_air_tree3_desc: "Our industries must be able to produce the best aeroplanes they can, even if this means we must cut a few corners here and there."

### Foreign Policy Focuses ###
 SIC_old_order: "The Old Order"
 SIC_old_order_desc: "It is clear that a centralised Italian state will only once more bring ruin by neglecting those outside of a few urban centres. The future of Italy must instead look once more to the past, and we will ensure that the new confederation will bring prosperity to all of Italy and its many peoples."
 SIC_preserve_status_quo: "Preserve the Status Quo"
 SIC_preserve_status_quo_desc: "The Confederation respects regional differences, local customs and cultures and is far more representative than the Savoyard kingdom ever was. However, we must keep vigilant to remind would-be traitors that we are still all Italians, and that our motherland must be defended."
 SIC_rebuild_northern_arms_industry: "Rebuilding the Northern Arms Industry"
 SIC_rebuild_northern_arms_industry_desc: "With northern Italy now free of syndicalist oppression much work must be done to fully restore the region to its former glory. To help our fellow confederation members achieve this goal, we should strive to restore the once great arms industry to its former glory."
 SIC_coordinated_commercial_development: "Coordinated Commercial Development"
 SIC_coordinated_commercial_development_desc: "The years of syndicalist rule have not been kind to northern business, but with the weight of socialism having now been lifted from them it is time for Italian commerce to once again spread throughout both the peninsula and one day the world."
 SIC_customs_union: "Confederate Customs Union"

 SIC_organise_conferate_army: "Organise a Joint Confederate Army"
 SIC_organise_conferate_army_desc: "While all states of the confederation are expected to maintain their own personal armies, it is clear that not all of these armies will be equal. To solve this we must ensure that proper command structures are developed to allow all of the armies of the confederation to act in unison, fighting as one cohesive unit taking advantage of each army's unique strengths while also tackling their weaknesses."
 SIC_combined_theory_development: "Combined Theory Development"
 SIC_combined_theory_development_desc: "Italy is a fantastically diverse region where each of its peoples have their own unique experiences, and when developing the combat theories of our armed forces we should not neglect the knowledge this can impart upon us. Through cooperation and knowledge sharing within the confederation, we will be able to develop much more efficiently and effectively."
 SIC_constituent_training_schemes: "Constituent Training Schemes"
 SIC_constituent_training_schemes_desc: "With the Sicilian army being the largest and strongest of those within the confederation, it is no surprise that many from the constituent states wish to join it directly.

 SIC_frattelli_ditalia: "Fratelli d'Italia"
 SIC_frattelli_ditalia_desc: "It is clear that disorganised confederations do nothing but hold a nation back.

Lead by a southern monarch who has Italy's true interests at heart, we will surely prosper for a thousand years."
 SIC_imppero_italiano: "First Italian Empire"
 SIC_imppero_italiano_desc: "An empire must have an emperor, regardless of our great King's humble reluctance to claim the title. Having restored the nation from the brink of ruin, stamping out the threat of syndicalism, and rejecting the dominion of foreign powers who wish to see Italy remain divided and weak, it is finally time for him to receive the crown he deserves."
 SIC_restore_royal_titles: "Restore Royal Titles"
 SIC_restore_royal_titles_desc: "When the north was seized by socialism, much of the northern nobility were forced into exile across the world.

 SIC_direct_centralised_rule: "Direct Centralised Rule"
 SIC_direct_centralised_rule_desc: "The feudalistic approach is an undated relic of a bygone age, one which will simply hold Italy back from the greatness it deserves.

 SIC_rebuilding_the_north: "Rebuilding the North"
 SIC_rebuilding_the_north_desc: "While many of the northern nobles may have been restored to their positions, much of the north still remains scarred by the remnants of syndicalist occupation. Italy cannot just simply sit by while its people suffer, and so we should focus on aiding the reconstruction and rebuilding of the northern states."
 SIC_rewarding_the_south: "Rewarding the South"
 SIC_rewarding_the_south_desc: "Southern Italy has long been seen as the neglected backwater of the peninsula, one that those in the north often wish to ignore the existence of.

 SIC_roma_caput_mundi: "Roma Caput Mundi"
 SIC_roma_caput_mundi_desc: "Naples served the nation as a fine capital when the need to do so was thrust upon it, but with Italy now reunited again it is time for the \"Eternal City\" to return to its rightful place as the centre of a great Italian empire, and so the infrastructure needed to support such an important capital must be developed post haste."
 SIC_nuovo_regio_esercito: "Nuovo Regio Esercito"
 SIC_nuovo_regio_esercito_desc: "Italy is no longer just the Sicilies, it is once again whole, and so too should be its army. It is time to reorganise and expand the army into a New Royal Army that is made up of all of Italies peoples, one fit to serve it for many years to come."

 SIC_defenders_of_the_alps_desc: "The Alps are the natural shield of the Italian peninsula, one that guards Italy from dangerous adversaries who seek Italian submission and destruction.

 SIC_rethinking_the_rifle_desc: "A soldier's rifle is more than just a weapon, it is often the only thing that decides between his life and his death.

 SIC_dalmatian_autonomous_province_desc: "Once a prized possession of the Serenissima, Dalmatia has since fallen far under corrupt Habsburg rule.

 SIC_paolis_legacy: "Paoli's Legacy"
 SIC_paolis_legacy_desc: "While he never succeeded in his dreams of freeing Corsica from French rule, Pasquale Paoli has become an inspiration to many Coriscans and especially those who recognise the island's intrinsic relation with Italy.

 SIC_revitalise_maltese_culture_desc: "Under the rule of the British Malta has experienced great repression when it comes to the issue of language, with Britain suppressing Italian speakers and even Maltese speakers in a misguided effort to integrate the archipelago fully into their empire.

### Bookmark ###
 SIC_KR_gathering_storm_desc: "The Kingdom of the Two Sicilies initially sided with Austria during the civil war, a necessary evil to halt the advance of the Socialist Republic. Later, however, when war with the syndicalists seemed inevitable, the Austrians showed their true colours and abandoned the south. The war never happened, but the Sicilians came into the modern era wiser. They will have a difficult time meeting the more industrialised north head-on, but that war will someday come and they must be ready for it."

### Intro Screen ###
 SIC_country_intro_header: "The Legacy of the Civil War"
 SIC_country_intro_content: "Following the Napoleonic wars, the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies was created, combining the two old kingdoms of Naples and Sicily, which lasted until 1860 when Sardinia-Piedmont, aided by Garibaldi's partisans, united Italy under her rule. The South, which was always generally agricultural, suffered at the hands of the Savoyards, who did not care much for industrialising the south, and poverty became commonplace.\n\nWhen the Weltkrieg began Italy eventually chose the side of the Entente, much to her ruin. The Austrians signed an armistice in 1919, in which they were allowed to occupy Lombardy and Venetia until a peace treaty was signed. However, outraged nationalists, republicans and socialists rose up against the government for their foolhardy actions in starting a war they were doomed to lose, and when King Victor Emanuel and his son abdicated, the Kingdom of Italy collapsed into anarchy. Civil war soon convulsed the peninsula, and hope seemed lost for the White forces in the south of Italy until the Austrians rejoined the war, in exchange for southern participation in a new political system - the Italian Federation. The Austrians pushed back the syndicalists from Lombardy, and the syndicalist pressure on the Abruzzo line was removed. Following the ceasefire, the south joined the Italian Federation as the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, but it was always with the understanding that only the promise of Austrian aid kept the Federation intact. When the syndicalists threatened the south in 1927, Austria's promises of protection vanished... and while the war never materialised, the worth of the Federation was revealed. The Two Sicilies, the Papal State and Sardinia withdrew, leaving Austria's only place of influence the republic in the north."

 SIC_country_intro_header_1: "The Kingdom of the Two Sicilies"
 SIC_country_intro_content_1: "Since the end of hostilities, the Kingdom has been mostly focused internally. The Christian Democrats, in power since 1920, have been trying to pursue the age-old dream of land reform in the South. The lack of progress on this front, however, caused the Christian Democrat supermajority to fail in 1927, though a democratic coalition has kept power since, and made some small movements toward land reform in Campania and Capua. The rise of the opposing 'Integralisti 'e Doje Sicilie' could signal a radical change in the Kingdom's politics, and only time will tell if they get to achieve their reactionary aims or if democracy will prevail."

 SIC_country_intro_header_2: "The Second Risorgimento"
 SIC_country_intro_content_2: "As for the future of Italy, questions have slowly arisen regarding our place in the coming conflict. Peace on the peninsula is held by a delicate balance: if the syndicalists strike, they must do so without drawing the Third Internationale into battle with them. Should they do so, both Germany and Austria will feel compelled to intervene. They will not, however, feel so compelled if Two Sicilies strikes first. So it is on the Socialist Republic of Italy to make the first move towards a Second Risorgimento, and they must do so without French backing. We must keep a careful watch on the Abruzzo line, to see if they become so bold."

### Events ###
 sic.2.t: "Black Monday hits the Kingdom"
 sic.2.d: "The economic crisis that began in Germany has spiralled out of control and spread to Italy. The Kingdom of the Two Sicilies' prosperity has been shattered by Black Monday and confidence in the government has been shaken."
 sic.2.a: "May God protect us!"

 sic.3.t: "Poverty and Crime Rises"
 sic.3.d: "With Black Monday hitting our kingdom hard, poverty has skyrocketed and the living standards of many Sicilians have plunged. At the same time, the various criminal cartels and mafiosos have moved in to take advantage of this situation, much to the detriment of the government. Banditry and brigandry have increased in the countryside, and many are demanding that the government do something."
 sic.3.a: "Something must be done!"

 sic.4.t: "The Camicie Nere"
 sic.4.d: "With the rise of crime in the country due to Black Monday, the Milizia Volontaria per la Sicurezza Nazionale have been formed. The MVSN, or as they are informally called 'Camicie Nere' for their black shirts have been popping up throughout the kingdom, from Naples to Palermo. Supposedly led by Achille Lauro, this paramilitary organisation is described as the muscle behind the Integralisti in the Kingdom, for they have been keeping watch during their rallies, as well as disrupting and breaking up rallies of the left. Their disciplined, militaristic marches through the streets of major cities draw large crowds, and drum up more recruits, especially amongst the youth.\n\nThe Camicie Nere is rapidly becoming a force to be reckoned with, and their numbers are still expanding - it's unlikely they'll stay silent during the elections..."
 sic.4.a: "We should keep an eye on them."

 sic.5.t: "A Call for New Leadership"
 sic.5.d: "The Archbishop of Naples, Alessio Ascalesi, has given a stern and powerful sermon claiming that the government's Social Conservative policies are ruining the kingdom and are at fault for Black Monday. He says that it is time for the kingdom to have new leadership with new ideas. Many that support the Social Liberal Democrazia Cristiana have taken this as a sign, and are energised by his rhetoric."
 sic.5.a: "May God protect the kingdom"

 sic.6.t: "The Liberal Coalition"
 sic.6.d: "Since the founding of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, parliamentary power has been contested primarily by the Social Conservatives and the Social Liberals. However, with the rise of the Far Right and the creation of the Integralist Paramilitary force, the Partito Liberale and the Partito Popolare Democratico have agreed to form a coalition. This liberal pact is dedicated to preserving and strengthening liberal values within the Kingdom.\n\nThe creation of this alliance, however, weakens the Social Conservative party, for in the past the Partito Liberale tended to support the Partito Democratico Cristiano. For the liberals though there is hope that this new coalition will keep the torch of liberalism strong within the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies."
 sic.6.a: "The torch of liberalism shall not fail"
 sic.6.b: "The new coalition galvanises opposition"

 sic.7.t: "Fighting between the Left and Right"
 sic.7.d: "A rally by the Confederazione Generale Siciliana del Lavoro or the 'Sicilian General Confederation of Labour' for the ruling Partito Democratico Cristiano was disrupted when members of the Camicie Nere disrupted their rally. This disruption quickly turned into a bloody battle that left quite a few injured, and even worse a few fatalities on both sides. While the CGSL has forsworn syndicalism, the Camicie Nere have been lately decrying their members as agents to the Socialist Republic in the North.\n\nNow the outcome of this particular case must be decided. Are these members innocent, or do the words of the Camicie Nere hold merit and truth? Many conservatives are siding with the Camicie Nere, declaring that they are traitors to the Kingdom, while some of the Liberals claim that they are innocent."
 sic.7.a: "The Union members are innocent"
 sic.7.b: "They are disloyal traitors"

 sic.10.t: "The [GetYear] Sicilian Elections"
 sic.10.d: "The elections of [GetYear] are now upon us and this year is far more contentious of an election than before. There are currently five parties battling for political domination. Who shall win?"
 sic.10.a: "Partito Democratico Cristiano"
 sic.10.b: "Partito Popolare Democratico"
 sic.10.c: "Democrazia Cristiana"
 sic.10.e: "Partito Liberale e Agrario"
 sic.10.f: "Integralisti d'e Ddoje Sicilie"

 sic.11.t: "Sicilian Welfare Act of [GetYear]"
 sic.11.d: "With Black Monday over, a number of ministers from the Social Democrat Partito Popolare Demoractico have proposed a plan for an extensive welfare system. However, such a move seems to many as not dissimilar to syndicalism. Thus a more moderate form has been proposed as a counter by the Democrazia Cristiana, which has some attraction even among some of the conservatives. However, the remainder of the conservative faction believes we should not implement any sort of socialist or syndicalist reforms in our country, which is clearly what this is."
 sic.11.a: "Extensive Welfare"
 sic.11.b: "Moderate Welfare"
 sic.11.c: "We shall not bring socialism here!"

 sic.19.t: "End to the Camicie Nere"
 sic.19.d: "The Kingdom's stability has in recent years weakened the black shirts of the Camicie Nere, but today they finally disbanded. While Integralism is not gone, their paramilitary forces are, and we can breath a sigh of relief."
 sic.19.a: "Finally."

 sic.20.t: "The [GetYear] Elections"
 sic.20.d: "The elections of [getyear] are now upon us. Three main parties are vying for the voter's influence. Whom shall the people choose to be the new Prime Minister?"

 sic.20.b: "Partito Popolare Democratico"
 sic.20.c: "Democrazia Cristiana"
 sic.20.e: "Partito Liberale e Agrario"

 sic.21.t: "Nobility Act"
 sic.21.d: "One of the first acts of the Integralists was to restore various noble titles. While these were never abolished, many had become purely ceremonial, but today marks a full restoration of rights, making these nobles the leaders of their respective regions. Local rulers are the better rulers after all."
 sic.21.a: "The Nobility is restored."

 sic.22.t: "Trade Union Act of [GetYear]"
 sic.22.d: "The issue of Trade Unions must be dealt with and two proposals have been discussed lately. The first would outlaw and criminalise the Unions altogether. The second would force the trade unions into a single union that would be controlled by the government and be strictly non-socialist."
 sic.22.a: "Outlaw Unions all together."
 sic.22.b: "Force them into a controlled state Union."

 sic.23.t: "Catholic Recreation"
 sic.23.d: "As part of our new political plan, a programme of Catholic-oriented recreation has been created. The programme has the local churches sponsoring recreational activities, intertwining support for the Integralist ideology. Such a policy has become rather popular and increases support for our other policies, with the welcome side-benefit of higher church attendance."
 sic.23.a: "The beauty of God's work."

 sic.24.t: "Protests Against Dissolving Parliament"
 sic.24.d: "There have been a number of protests against the government with the permanent dissolution of Parliament, especially from the Partito Democratico Cristiano who are responsible for leading the majority of protests. In order to resolve this issue, three solutions have been proposed.\n\nThe first is to just let them shout and let them tire. The second is to lock them up and silence their voice. The third is to let the black shirts have their way with them."
 sic.24.a: "Let them Shout"
 sic.24.b: "Lock Them Up"
 sic.24.c: "Let the Black Shirts deal with them"

 sic.25.t: "Integrate the black-shirts?"
 sic.25.d: "With our control of the country secure, the question is how the Black Shirts should be dealt with. Some want to see them integrated into the secret police, while others think that keeping them as a separate organisation will be best."
 sic.25.a: "Integrate them"
 sic.25.b: "Keep them as our Paramilitary Force"

 sic.26.t: "National Catholic Youth League"
 sic.26.d: "The National Catholic Youth League has been created to help the youth of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies be taught the ideals of Integralism and Traditional values. The League has two main sub-organisations, one for boys and one for girls. By making sure that the youth are enrolled in the organisation this will make sure that they never sway from the government's ideals."
 sic.26.a: "The Youth are the future."

 sic.27.t: "Traditional Art Programme"
 sic.27.d: "With a return to traditionalism across the kingdom, traditional artwork has recently begun to be patronised by nobles. Styles that have not be seen in a century or more are once again being used. Traditional artwork is once again popular throughout the Two Sicilies."
 sic.27.a: "Futurism is all bunk anyway."

 sic.28.t: "Magna Curia"
 sic.28.d: "To govern the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, the Magna Curia has been re-founded. The Magna Curia was the principal organisation of the Kingdom of Sicily in the Middle Ages and it brought forth the nobles of the realm. Unlike the parliaments of today, this was a proper noble court and filled with art and learning. The Magna Curia will henceforth be the new governing body and limited only to the ruling local lords."
 sic.28.a: "A new Court for an old Kingdom."

 sic.29.t: "Ennobled Corporate leaders"
 sic.29.d: "With the decision to restore the Nobility to strength, a number of business leaders have either found, bought or forged patents of nobility to bring them within the new ranks of the nobility."
 sic.29.a: "A new generation of Nobles."

 sic.40.t: "The Italian Empire"
 sic.40.d: "Today, the region of Italy has been declared an Italian Empire. King Ferdinand has sworn upon the constitution of the Italian Federation to protect it as its new President, first among equals. Today all of Italy celebrates the dream of a united country and nation."
 sic.40.a: "Long live Italia!"

 sic.41.t: "De-syndicalisation"
 sic.41.d: "With the north under our control, we must begin the process of de-syndicalisation. Not just of the economy but of society as a whole. The question on everyone's lips is whether we will be harsh in our reforms, or prioritise reconciliation."
 sic.41.a: "They should learn their lessons"
 sic.41.b: "We should focus on reconciliation"

 sic.42.t: "Strengthening Monarchism"
 sic.42.d: "The north of Italy was ruled by two republics and republicanism is particularly strong in the north. However as time goes on, more and more are supporting the monarchy. While we will never be able to get rid of republicanism one hundred percent we can be happy to know that the imperial family is supported by our subjects more and more in the north."
 sic.42.a: "Long live the King."

 sic.43.t: "Integrating Generals"
 sic.43.d: "Today, several of the generals that previously fought for the various imposter governments have requested to fight for the Empire. Some feel that they should not fight for us, seeing as they fought against us, but others think that allowing them to fight for our shared country would make for an excellent statement of national unity."
 sic.43.a: "They should fight for Italy!"
 sic.43.b: "We don't need people who fought against us."

 sic.44.t: "Women's role in the empire"
 sic.44.d: "In the Socialist Republic of Italy, the traditional roles of women were destroyed. However, now that we are in charge the question of Women's role in the empire has arisen. Some want us to double down on the traditional role for ladies to protect the family, while others think giving them the right to vote, but not run for office, is good enough. Finally, a smaller number, principally from the Social Democratic Partito Popolare Demoractico suggest full suffrage including both the right to vote and the right to run for office."
 sic.44.a: "Re-enforce traditional Values"
 sic.44.b: "Let women have the right to vote"
 sic.44.c: "Let them vote and run for office"

 sic.45.t: "Dealing with Christian Socialism"
 sic.45.d: "In the Socialist Republic of Italy Christian socialism was rather popular in the north. As we focus on de-syndicalising society, many politicians want to turn away from liberal philosophies, with many more conservative and far-right members declaring them to be anti-Christian. However, some among the Partito Democratico Cristiano think that, by focusing on a moderate Christian democracy, we can turn people away from the more radical nature of Christian socialism. This policy is criticised for being just a ploy to increase their power in the north."
 sic.45.a: "Christian Socialism is anti-Christian!"
 sic.45.b: "Focus on Christian Democracy"

 sic.46.t: "Syndicalist Resistance"
 sic.46.d: "Even though we defeated the Socialist Republic of Italy, and many have accepted our rule over the north, there remains resistance. In a number of cities and communes, terrorist cells have been formed that are threatening the safety of the empire. The military is assured that they will be destroyed in due time."
 sic.46.a: "Damn Syndicalists."

 sic.47.t: "Syndicalist Terrorists Destroyed"
 sic.47.d: "Today the last of the godless leaders of the syndicalist terrorists have been captured. The people can rest easy in the north knowing that the syndicalist-terrorist bandits will no longer plague the countryside."
 sic.47.a: "Finally."

 sic.49.t: "Italian Irredentism claims"
 sic.49.d: "With the establishment of the Italian Empire, a number in the government are looking to expand the Empire's territory, especially in lands that are considered Italian. Two plans have been brought forth. The first only claims a few places, notable Malta, Trieste, and Trentino. The second plan calls for claiming all land, despite the fact this will upset our neighbours."
 sic.49.a: "Claim only a small amount."
 sic.49.b: "Claim all Italian Land!"

 sic.50.t: "The New Lands"
 sic.50.d: "It has been some time but we have finally liberated our rightful land. Now that we have reclaimed these lands, we can feel secure in their support for the Empire."
 sic.50.a: "Avanti Italia!"
 sic.50.b: "Avanti Italia!"

 sic.61.t: "Act of Succession"
 sic.61.d: "One of the concerns for the Kingdom is the succession to the throne of the Two Sicilies. The issue is that King Ferdinand only has daughters and at 67 years old, he is rather unlikely to have any more children. However, the issue is that his two brothers dispute whom should be the heir as the current law states only men can inherit.\n\nNormally according to the laws of the land, the throne would go to Ferdinand's brother Prince Carlos and his descendants, however, Ferdinand's other brother, Prince Ranieri, disputes that claim citing the Act of Cannes of 1900, due to Carlos' marriage to the Spanish princess Mercedes that put him in line for the Spanish throne."
 sic.61.a: "Prince Carlos and the rule of Agnatic primogeniture."
 sic.61.b: "Prince Ranieri and the Act of Cannes."

 sic.62.t: "Language of the Kingdom"
 sic.62.d: "The Kingdom of the Two Sicilies is divided by language. On the Island of Sicily, the Sicilian language is used and favoured while on the mainland the Neapolitan language is preferred. The government is debating three bills. The first two bills are about favouring one or the other, while the third is about encouraging Bilingualism and supporting both languages."
 sic.62.a: "Favour Sicilian."
 sic.62.b: "Favour Neapolitan."
 sic.62.c: "Favour Bilingualism."

 sic.63.t: "Royal Marriage"
 sic.63.d: "Today Prince Eugenio, a relative of Amedeo I of Sardinia, has married Princess Lucia Maria Raniera, the Fourth daughter of King Ferdinand of the Two Sicilies in a lavish ceremony in Naples."
 sic.63.a: "Who doesn't love a royal wedding?"

 sic.100.t: "An Offer from [From.GetNameDef]"
 sic.100.d: "A delegation from [From.GetNameDef] has arrived with an offer: in exchange for us returning to the mainland and assuming control over their holdings in Piedmont, they ask for [Root.GetNameDef] to join them in confederation, as a step in restoring Italy. In practice, this means we would become an autonomous puppet to the [From.GetAdjective] government. It is a tempting offer, though it means abandoning any of our current alliances and wars."
 sic.100.a: "We agree to their offer"
 sic.100.b: "Tell them to ask again when the war is over"
 sic.100.c: "We have no interest, now or ever"

 sic.101.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Agrees"
 sic.101.d: "The [From.GetAdjective] government was more than happy to exchange the return of their land in return for joining our confederation."
 sic.101.a: "Excellent!"

 sic.102.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] has Refused"
 sic.102.d: "The [From.GetAdjective] government apparently does not want their lands back badly enough, or does not trust our offer. Either way, they have refused to join our alliance."
 sic.102.a: "Their loss, it seems"

 sic.103.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Refuses, For Now"
 sic.103.d: "While the [From.GetAdjective] government was not entirely opposed to the idea of trading Piedmont for their sovereignty, they say they are entirely too preoccupied with their current war and intend to see it through. They have asked [Root.GetNameDef] to return with the proposal once more, when peace has been achieved."
 sic.103.a: "Well, that's something"

 sic.104.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Calls for Help"
 sic.104.d: "With war started between [From.GetNameDef] and [SRI.GetNameDef], and with no allies to back them up, they have called to us for help. If the Socialists win now, after all, who else will they turn against next but us? We must make a stand now, ready or not."
 sic.104.a: "We will go to their aid"
 sic.104.b: "Leave them to their fate"

 sic.105.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Has Abandoned Us"
 sic.105.d: "Despite knowing that [SIC.GetNameDef] will almost surely turn against them next, [From.GetNameDef] has refused our call for aid and abandoned us to our fate."
 sic.105.a: "They will get what they deserve, in the end"

 sic.106.t: "Claims over Northern Italy"
 sic.106.d: "Now that the war with the north is over, our claims over northern Italy are no longer required."
 sic.106.a: "So be it."

 sic.107.t: "Austrian Friendship"
 sic.107.d: "A Habsburg envoy, Archduke Maximilian Eugen has arrived in Naples as part of a diplomatic visit to our king. He has privately asked members of our government to try and mend the relations of our two nations, damaged when Austria withdrew its protection in 1925. Should we agree to renewed ties?"
 sic.107.a: "We are natural friends."
 sic.107.b: "They abandoned us once, they'll do it again."

 sic.109.t: "Negotiations Begin with [From.From.GetNameDef]"
 sic.109.d.sicconfedITA: "Today, negotiations have begun with [From.From.GetNameDef], as we bring to them an offer to join the Italian Confederation. It would, of course, mean splitting their country back up into its respective states and disbanding the central government, but we are trying to show them that this is the best way forward for all of Italy. They have begun deliberations, and tell us they hope to return with an answer within the next couple of weeks."
 sic.109.d.sicconfedNOTITA: "Today, negotiations have begun with [From.From.GetNameDef], as we bring to them an offer to join the Italian Confederation. While it would mean surrendering their sovereignty to [Root.GetAdjective] control, it would also mean being part of a greater whole. This is, as we see it, the best way forward for all of Italy. They have begun deliberations, and tell us they hope to return with an answer within the next couple of weeks."
 sic.109.d.empire: "Today, negotiations have begun with [From.From.GetNameDef] as we bring to them an offer: recognise that [Root.GetNameDef] is the only path forward for Italian unity and join our nation. Details such as the rights they will maintain as a state and the part they will play in the [Root.GetAdjective] government can be worked out in the months ahead. For now, all we wish to know is whether they wish to mend the rift caused by the civil war and bring Italy back together as it was meant to be. They have begun deliberations, and tell us they hope to return with an answer within the next couple of weeks."
 sic.109.a: "We pray the negotiations go well"

 sic.110.t: "A Path to Italian Unity"
 sic.110.d.sicconfedITA: "Today, a delegation from [From.GetNameDef] arrived with an offer: to mend the rift caused by the syndicalists and the civil war, and rejoin a greater Italy as part of the Italian Confederation. This would mean disbanding our central government, and our states surrendering their sovereignty to the [From.GetAdjective] leadership... but the states would still retain considerable autonomy, and a failure in the negotiations could mean war. We have told the [From.GetAdjective] delegation that they would have our answer within the next couple of weeks while we begin our deliberations."
 sic.110.d.sicconfedNOTITA: "Today, a delegation from [From.GetNameDef] arrived with an offer: to mend the rift caused by the syndicalists and the civil war, and rejoin a greater Italy as part of the Italian Confederation. This would mean surrendering our sovereignty to the [From.GetAdjective] leadership... but we would still retain considerable autonomy, and a failure in the negotiations could mean war. We have told the [From.GetAdjective] delegation that they would have our answer within the next couple of weeks while we begin our deliberations."
 sic.110.d.empire: "Today, a [From.GetAdjective] delegation arrived with an offer: to mend the rift caused by the syndicalists and the civil war, and rejoin a greater Italy as part of [From.GetNameDef]. Details such as the rights we will hold as a state and the part we will play in the [From.GetAdjective] government can be worked out in the months ahead. For now, what they await is an answer as to whether we are interested. Considering this will be tantamount to annexation, and a breakdown in negotiations could mean war, we must think about this carefully. We have told the [From.GetAdjective] delegation that they would have our answer within the next couple of weeks while we begin our deliberations."
 sic.110.a: "We believe this is for the best"
 sic.110.b: "We agree, but must first inform our faction"
 sic.110.c: "Tell them to ask again when the war is over"
 sic.110.e: "We refuse their offer"

 sic.113.t: "News from [From.GetNameDef]"
 sic.113.d: "The [From.GetAdjective] government today advised us that, after weeks of deliberation, they have decided to accept a proposal to unite with the government of [uniter.GetNameDef]. This, they say, is in the best interest of Italian unity, though it unfortunately does mean leaving the [Root.GetFactionName] and they wanted us to be the first to know."
 sic.113.a: "Perhaps [uniter.GetNameDef] would join the [Root.GetFactionName]?"
 sic.113.b: "Ask them to reconsider"
 sic.113.c: "Ask them to reconsider, for the sake of the war"
 sic.113.e: "They have our blessing"

 sic.114.t: "[uniter.GetNameDefCap] Invited to the [From.GetFactionName]"
 sic.114.d: "Unexpectedly, rather than protest our leaving the [From.GetFactionName], [From.GetNameDef] has said that it's fine with the [uniter.GetAdjective] proposal... but would extend an invitation to [uniter.GetNameDef] to join the [From.GetFactionName] instead. All would benefit, they say, from an expanded alliance."
 sic.114.a: "We'll let them know!"

 sic.115.t: "The [From.From.GetAdjective] Proposal"
 sic.115.d: "The [From.GetAdjective] government informs us that their national referendum came out in favour of our proposal, but that, as a member of the [From.From.GetFactionName] alliance, they have one lingering concern regarding their membership in the [From.From.GetFactionName] alliance. According to them, the [From.From.GetAdjective] government has asked if we would consider joining the [From.From.GetFactionName] - in exchange, they would give their blessing to the entire arrangement and we would both come out stronger. The [From.GetAdjective] government has not mentioned whether its answer would change if we refuse - we have no idea how committed they are to the [From.From.GetAdjective] cause."
 sic.115.a: "We would be happy to join"
 sic.115.b: "We'd rather not, thank you"

 sic.116.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Agrees to Join"
 sic.116.d: "Seeing the benefit of our proposal, [From.GetNameDef] has taken up where [From.From.GetNameDef] left off and agreed to join the [Root.GetFactionName]."
 sic.116.a: "Excellent!"

 sic.117.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Will Not Join"
 sic.117.d: "We passed on the wishes of our allies, but [From.GetNameDef] has declined their offer to join [Root.GetFactionName]. It is their right not to get caught up in wars outside of Italy, though we cannot help but feel regret from abandoning those who have protected us in the past. Now we must decide how to proceed."
 sic.117.a: "Tell them to ask again once the war is over"
 sic.117.b: "No, we intend to stay in the [Root.GetFactionName]"
 sic.117.c: "We intend to press forward"

 sic.118.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Will Remain"
 sic.118.d: "While it was not an easy decision, the [From.GetAdjective] government has elected to remain in the [Root.GetFactionName] and decline the [uniter.GetAdjective] proposal... at least for now."
 sic.118.a: "That's a relief"

 sic.119.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Leaves the [Root.GetFactionName]"
 sic.119.d: "While it was not an easy decision, the [From.GetAdjective] government has elected to leave the [Root.GetFactionName] anyhow, despite [Root.GetNameDef]'s attempt to have them remain. They intend to accept the [uniter.GetAdjective] proposal."
 sic.119.a: "So be it."

 sic.120.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Reverses Decision"
 sic.120.d: "Disappointed by our refusal to join the [From.GetFactionName], [From.GetNameDef] has now informed us that they cannot agree to our proposal. Their dedication to their allies is too great. They have, however, left the door open for us to reapproach them once their war is done."
 sic.120.a: "That will have to be enough"
 sic.120.b: "We will not wait!"

 sic.121.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Reverses Decision"
 sic.121.d: "Disappointed by our refusal to join the [From.GetFactionName], [From.GetNameDef] has now informed us that they cannot agree to our proposal. Their dedication to their allies is too great, they say. What's more, they made no indication that they are open to further discussion down the road. Apparently, they fully intend on maintaining their independence and having the [From.GetFactionName] there to back them up."
 sic.121.a: "So be it."

 sic.122.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Agrees to our Proposal"
 sic.122.d: "While they are disappointed in our refusal to join the [From.GetFactionName], the [From.GetAdjective] government assures us that this will not deter them from proceeding with our proposal as planned. For the sake of Italian unity, with or without the [From.GetFactionName]."
 sic.122.a: "Viva l'Italia!"

 sic.123.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Asks us to Reconsider"
 sic.123.d: "While not stopping us from accepting the [uniter.GetAdjective] proposal, the [From.GetAdjective] government has asked us to reconsider leaving the [From.GetFactionName]. They say the alliance between our countries is valuable to them, and suggest they can protect us from any potential [uniter.GetAdjective] aggression, should they decide to force our hand. Should we change our mind?"
 sic.123.a: "Tell [uniter.GetNameDef] to ask again once the war is over"
 sic.123.b: "Very well, we stay with the [Root.GetFactionName]"
 sic.123.c: "We intend to press forward"

 sic.124.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Refuses, For Now"
 sic.124.d: "The [From.GetAdjective] government has deliberated on the matter for weeks, and while they were initially inclined to accept our proposal it appears the [From.From.GetAdjective] government has persuaded them to remain in the [From.From.GetFactionName]... at least for the duration of the war. [From.GetNameDefCap] has assured us that they will welcome a new proposal once they are at peace."

 sic.125.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Refuses Our Proposal"
 sic.125.d: "The [From.GetAdjective] government has deliberated on the matter for weeks, and while they were initially inclined to accept our proposal it appears the [From.From.GetAdjective] government has persuaded them to remain in the [From.From.GetFactionName].

 sic.126.a: "Viva l'Italia!"

 sic.127.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Gives Blessing"
 sic.127.d: "The [From.GetAdjective] government says they are sorry to see us depart the [From.GetFactionName], but they fully understand our decision and wish us well."
 sic.127.a: "Now onto unity"

 sic.128.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Agrees"
 sic.128.d.noconfed: "After weeks of deliberation, the [From.GetAdjective] government has informed us that [From.GetNameDef] will unite with [Root.GetNameDef]. Details on the exact arrangement will be worked out in the months to come, but for now both nations can rejoice that peaceful agreement has been achieved."
 sic.128.d.confed: "After weeks of deliberation, the [From.GetAdjective] government has informed us that [From.GetNameDef] will be joining the Italian Confederation.

They have asked [Root.GetNameDef] to return with the proposal once more, when peace has been achieved."
 sic.129.a: "We will pray for their victory, then"
 sic.129.b: "We refuse to wait!"

 sic.130.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Refuses"
 sic.130.d: "After deliberating for weeks, the [From.GetAdjective] government has informed us that [Root.GetNameDef]'s proposal has been refused. Whether due to their distrust of the [Root.GetAdjective] government or a desire for a better deal, we cannot say, but they fully intend on maintaining their independence."
 sic.130.a: "So be it."
 sic.130.b: "I'm afraid that won't be happening"

 sic.140.t: "The Agrarian Question"
 sic.140.d: "How the government will approach the land issue is a serious matter. The landowners are members of the nobility, men who hold significant political power and who will oppose and kind of land reform forced upon them. Subsidising their farming methods and buying back land for the government's use, however, will prove costly. Either way, the issue can no longer be ignored - we fall behind the advancements of the north at our own peril."
 sic.140.a: "We will pursue land reform, no matter what"
 sic.140.b: "We will work with the landowners to make progress"

Having arrived well after the civil war in Italy was concluded, his position was always fragile, and he himself knows he is little more than a puppet in the great game of Sicilian, Italian and global politics at large, as his presence legitimises the Kingdom internationally and allows it to remain aligned with the powers that be in Europe, having effectively kept large scale syndicalist offensives at bay. His rule, while not without political issues, came after six years of war and strife, and he tries his utmost to ensure that he takes personal credit for this peace and relative prosperity. While he traditionally has kept himself away from political affairs, as he is aware of the fragility of the peace he and many others work to maintain, the matters of the constant syndicalist threat and the lack of a male heir of his body weigh heavily on him. The nascent feelings of powerlessness, even in his current position as a monarch, makes him more prone to overtures by radical monarchists than even he himself realises.§!"
