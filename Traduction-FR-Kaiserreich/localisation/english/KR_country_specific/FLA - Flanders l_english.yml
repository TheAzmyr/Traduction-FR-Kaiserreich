### Events ###

 flanders.1.t: "Formation of the Coalition Government"
 flanders.1.d: "Elections have been issued by the National Assembly for the first time in our newly independent country. Many political movements across Flanders have seen this as their chance to make it as the main Flemish party. Due to the many contestants it seems that we will not be able to elect a sole winner and a coalition will have to be formed. At 18:00 the last polling stations closed and Van Zeeland announced the results of the First Flemish Election."
 flanders.1.a: "The Social Democrats have taken the most seats!"
 flanders.1.b: "The Social Liberals have taken the most seats!"
 flanders.1.c: "The Catholic party has taken the most seats!"
 flanders.1.e: "The Liberal party has taken the most seats!"

 flanders.101.t: "Elections in Flanders"
 flanders.101.d: "After a stable government, it's once more time for the Flemish to vote. Both the KB and the VWP are polling well, with the LP following. At 18:00 the last voting booths closed with exit polls indicating victory."

 flanders.2.t: "Count Karel of Flanders Assumes Control"
 flanders.2.d: "To loud applause and with much fanfare, Karel van Belgie has taken control of the country and has assumed the position of Graaf van Vlaanderen. Based on the pre-Weltkrieg constitutional monarchy, he lacks absolute control and mostly serves symbolically to resolve political crises."
 flanders.2.a: "Good Luck Graaf Karel."

 flanders.21.t: "Adelbert Accepts the Throne"
 flanders.21.d: "The Aristocratic Council of Flanders has offered the Flemish crown to Adelbert if he agrees to rule only in name and further stays out of Flemish affairs. Through this action, the Council hopes to strengthen relations with Germany and further secure their independence from an aggressive Wallonia."
 flanders.21.a: "Long live Adelbert (again)!"

 flanders.3.t: "Verdinaso Takes Control"
 flanders.3.d: "Under the guise of providing stability and prosperity, Verdinaso, headed by Joris van Severen, has taken control of the country. Consisting of Flemish Council members, the party has an ideological inclination towards strong centralised government spearheaded by their party leader. Whether or not the newborn nation will benefit from this approach remains to be seen but the future will most definitely be interesting."
 flanders.3.a: "Van Severen takes the oath."

#Zeeuws-Vlaanderen

 flanders.5.t: "The Zeeuws-Vlaanderen Question"
 flanders.5.d: "The Zeeuws-Vlaanderen situation is a tricky one that has plagued our nation for years. The Dutch province is located on the southern bank of the Scheldt and has a strong Flemish attachment, but it has consistently refused integration into Belgium. Now with the Flanders itself an independent nation, a new push is being made by our government to convince the Zeeuws-Flemish people to join our country, thus securing our access to the Scheldt and consolidating our hold on the southern bank.\n\nTwo main proposals are being considered: the moderate wing of our government insists on pushing for a referendum, letting the people decide for themselves. Meanwhile our more aggressive political figures are keen to implement plans for a more direct path to integration. They want to infiltrate parts of their government and execute a quick and decisive blow when the time comes."
 flanders.5.a: "The people themselves may choose!"
 flanders.5.b: "Implement the 'Antigoon Plan'."

 flanders.51.t: "The Antigoon Plan"
 flanders.51.d: "We have designed a plan to both secure our rightful territory and to ensure that the Dutch people will be unable to military respond against us with the full force of their army. We will covertly arm Flemish patriots and nationalists in the Netherlands and place them at key strategic locations while our army mobilises in Ghent and Antwerp to cut off Dutch reinforcements. By executing a coup against the provincial administration and securing the arsenal at Terneuzen, we will be able to acquire an established grip on the province allowing us to concentrate all our forces on shoring up defensive positions behind the Adelbert Canal."
 flanders.51.a: "Put the plan in motion."
 flanders.51.b: "Back down."

 flanders.52.t: "Antigoon Executed"
 flanders.52.d: "At 11:00 AM, a group of well trained nationalists attacked the arsenal in Terneuzen, surprising the guards and infiltrating part of the compound. Meanwhile in Sluis and other villages in the province the town halls were taken by force and quickly secured. However elements of the Dutch army, which was unexpectedly in the midst of training exercises in the area, responded immediately. They managed to take back the arsenal and secure a strong defensive position, awaiting reinforcements from the main army."
 flanders.52.a: "Now is the time to attack, Vlaanderen de Leeuw!"

 flanders.6.t: "The Zeeuws-Vlaanderen Referendum"
 flanders.6.d: "The Flemish government has approached us demanding that we attend to the will of our people and hold a referendum in the province of Zeeuws-Vlaanderen. The Zeeuws-Flemish, although culturally very Flemish, have always stuck with us and are not very likely to abandon us. Nevertheless this may be risky as the will of the people is difficult to determine and "errors" can always happen."
 flanders.6.a: "Hold the referendum!"
 flanders.6.b: "Respectfully refuse their foolish request."

 flanders.61.t: "Zeeuws-Vlaanderen Referendum Refused"
 flanders.61.d: "The Dutch government has responded to our reasonable demands with outright denial, insisting that we have no claim on the region and that the people who live there have been and will always remain loyal citizens of the Netherlands."
 flanders.61.a: "They've silenced the people, we must protect them!"
 flanders.61.b: "We have no choice but to back down."

 flanders.7.t: "The Netherlands Allows a Referendum"
 flanders.7.d: "The Dutch government has agreed with us and are planning the referendum for later this month. Tensions are high on the border with residents from both sides rushing to sign up for the vote and sway the results in their favour. Nationalist propaganda is being spread by radio and even television, with Dutch newspapers flooding the streets. This will surely be an important day for Flanders and may even determine the course of its foreign policy."
 flanders.7.a: "Double our efforts to help the Flemish people!"

 flanders.8.t: "Zeeuws-Vlaanderen Joins Us!"
 flanders.8.d: "Pulling in a close victory for the Flemish nationalists, the people have spoken and have decided to join the Flemish. The vote was ultimately decided by just two little villages bordering the Ghent-Terneuzen Canal that were already very economically dependent on the Flemish country and as such voted heavily in favour of unification. The Dutch government has not yet responded to our requests for transfer of power and may still decide to label the referendum void."
 flanders.8.a: "One step closer to Great Flanders!"

 flanders.81.t: "Zeeuws-Vlaanderen Votes For Secession!"
 flanders.81.d: "Pulling in a close victory for the Flemish nationalists, the people have spoken and have decided to join the Flemish. The vote was ultimately decided by just two little villages bordering the Ghent-Terneuzen Canal that were already very economically dependent on the Flemish country and as such voted heavily in favour of unification. Rumours of election fraud are coming in however and we could still proclaim the referendum void."
 flanders.81.a: "Congratulate the Flemish government!"
 flanders.81.b: "The Flemish have tampered with the results, attack at once!"

 flanders.9.t: "Zeeuws-Vlaanderen Votes To Remain Dutch!"
 flanders.9.d: "With a large majority the people of Zeeuws-Vlaanderen have spoken and decided against Flemish annexation in favour of continued Dutch rule. During the prelude to the referendum, actions by the Flemish government led to an explosion of Flemish nationalism in Zeeuws-Vlaams. Some citizens even went as far as creating their own national anthem proclaiming themselves "a nation apart but still Dutch". The Flemish government has yet to respond to the outcome of the referendum."
 flanders.9.a: "Congratulate the Dutch government!"
 flanders.9.b: "The Dutch have tampered with the results, attack at once!"

 flanders.11.t: "Zeeuws-Vlaanderen Votes For Secession"
 flanders.11.d: "Pulling in a close victory for the Flemish nationalists, the people have spoken and decided to join the Flemish nation.\n\nThe vote was ultimately decided by just two little villages bordering the Ghent-Terneuzen Canal that were already very economically dependent on the Flemish country and as such voted heavily in favour of unification.\n\nThe Dutch government has not yet responded to Flemish requests for the transfer of power and may still decide to label the referendum void."
 flanders.11.a: "A victory for the Flemish people."

 flanders.12.t: "Zeeuws-Vlaanderen Votes to Remain Dutch"
 flanders.12.d: "With a large majority the people of Zeeuws-Vlaanderen have spoken and decided against Flemish annexation in favour of continued Dutch rule.\n\nDuring the prelude to the referendum, actions by the Flemish government led to an explosion of Flemish nationalism in Zeeuws-Vlaams. Some citizens even went as far as creating their own national anthem proclaiming themselves "a nation apart but still Dutch".\n\nThe Flemish government has yet to respond to the outcome of the referendum."
 flanders.12.a: "A victory for the Dutch people."

#Frans-Vlaanderen

 flanders.13.t: "The Flemish Situation in French Flanders"
 flanders.13.d: "After seizing the territories around Lille and Dunkerke from Flanders during the reign of Louis XIV, the French have made extensive efforts to undermine the Dutch language and marginalise the Flemish community. After the syndicalist revolution many of these Flemish nationals fled over the border to West-Flanders, awaiting German intervention to return to their homes. Centuries of French indoctrination however have undoubtedly left their mark and only a small Flemish minority still exists in the region making our claim weak at best.\n\nAs a result of the tensions in the region, a commission has been established, one tasked with improving conditions for the Flemish minority and to enthuse the rest to adapt to our language and culture."
 flanders.13.a: "We should reconsider this."
 flanders.13.b: "Back the Commission."

 flanders.14.t: "Plea to the Bishoprics"
 flanders.14.d: "Still devoutly Catholic, most of the Flemish living in Frans-Vlaanderen listen intently to their doctor and their pastor. Due to the hostility between the syndicalist government and the powerful bishoprics in the region, we could exploit these divisions to convince local church leaders to join our KB party and more importantly, tie them into our nation."
 flanders.14.a: "Strengthen Catholic ties."
 flanders.14.b: "This is a waste of time."

 flanders.15.t: "Investment Programme in Frans-Vlaanderen"
 flanders.15.d: "While all contact with the Communard government in France is strictly forbidden, we can still covertly send money and resources to the Flemish companies and workers that live there. The continuation of the Caritas programme, invented by the Catholic Church, is intended to help the working class and by properly backing it we could increase the welfare of locals in the region and boost their sympathy towards Flanders. There are risks however, as this would undoubtedly be a very expensive project and it is unclear whether any meaningful results could be guaranteed."
 flanders.15.a: "Invest in Frans-Vlaanderen."
 flanders.15.b: "A complete misuse of resources."

 flanders.17.t: "Francophone Protests"
 flanders.17.d: "Due to extensive efforts by the French government to increase the importance of the French language in the region, large swathes of land have become monolingual French and are resisting their new Flemish occupiers. To quell their resistance, we could allow the continuation of French facilities in those areas. This would decrease the amount of civil unrest in the region, but would unfortunately decrease the speed at which it would be successfully reintegrated into Flanders."
 flanders.17.a: "Setup French facilities."
 flanders.17.b: "Enforce the Flemish language!"

 flanders.18.t: "Bombing in Lille"
 flanders.18.d: "Unhappy with the Flemification of the province, French separatist movements have placed a bomb in the home of one of our top officials in the city of Lille. While he was able to escape unscathed, three of his family members and four members of his staff have perished in the explosion."
 flanders.18.a: "A sad day for all Flanders."

 flanders.19.t: "Bombing of the Yzer Tower"
 flanders.19.d: "Built after the Weltkrieg to commemorate fallen Flemish soldiers, the tower of Yzer has become a symbol of Flemish nationalism and peace. During this year's annual Yzer pilgrimage organised by members of the Frontpartij, a French anarchist has blown up the tower causing the total destruction of its support structure and the death of twenty-three Weltkrieg veterans. The Flemish public is outraged calling for a decisive and brutal response from the Vlaamse Wacht."
 flanders.19.a: "A symbol of peace no more."

 flanders.20.t: "Candle Wake for the Yzer"
 flanders.20.d: "In support of the casualties during the Yzer Tower attack, several small villages in Frans-Vlaanderen have expressed their condolences for the families of the victims by organising a special ceremony, followed by a very appropriate and moving speech from the mayors of the respective communities."
 flanders.20.a: "We should thank them for their support."

 flanders.201.t: "Integration of Frans-Vlaanderen"
 flanders.201.d: "It has taken a long time but at last can we count the people of Frans-Vlaanderen as true Flemish citizens. The Flemish language is slowly undergoing a resurgence and the final administrative reforms are passed. Frans-Vlaanderen is now officially the sixth province of Flanders!"
 flanders.201.a: "We embrace them as brothers."

#First Days of the Nation

 flnrev.1.t: "Dissolution of Flanders-Wallonia"
 flnrev.1.d: "The nation of Flanders-Wallonia was only short-lived. Beset by widespread corruption, an absolutist monarch and corrosive German favouritism, it was only a matter of time before the powder keg inevitably exploded. Finally the Flemish have left the union and can finally for the first time in recent history celebrate their independence. From Oostende to Brussels to Hasselt Flemish lions are being paraded through the streets and across the nation chants of the Vlaamse Leeuw ring out. Still, such public displays of jubilation are little more than a front for the politics that happens behind closed doors."
 flnrev.1.a: "Vlaanderen de Leeuw!"

 flnrev.2.t: "Foundation of the Flemish National Congress"
 flnrev.2.d: "With the German king ousted and the nation liberated, the once united parties of the revolution are slowly breaking apart. The Flemish Council claims that they are the only legitimate government and that only they should lead the nation until things have calmed down. The Catholic Party, the largest in the nation is divided with members of the Council supporting this regency and members who were seated in the pro-German Parliament. Neither group wishes to give up their power or allow their administrative organs to be abolished. The VWP is resolutely against any continuation of the old system as it forbade their participation and the party is continuing to bolster relations with the still armed revolutionaries. The Liberation army meanwhile is torn between allegiance to the Catholic Party and their self appointed leaders who are vying for control of the state."
 flnrev.2.a: "The First National Congress ends in failure."

 flnrev.3.t: "The Council Seizes Control"
 flnrev.3.d: "To preserve their power and keep the national situation under control, the Flemish Council has, with the assistance of the Vlaamse Wacht, seized control of the Assembly stationing forces at all entrances and throughout the surrounding city blocks. Van Severen has used this opportunity to stand before the Assembly and give his speech, trying to convince them of the necessity of stability and preservation of the old system. While he has mild success in convincing some members, most of them are waiting for the Liberation army to launch a counter-attack against the Vlaamse Wacht and liberate the Assembly."
 flnrev.3.a: "The situation is escalating."

 flnrev.4.t: "Divisions Within the Liberation Army"
 flnrev.4.d: "With the Assembly being kept hostage, the Liberation army is increasingly becoming plagued by internal strife and divided leadership.\n\nLed by Charles Claser, the Secret Legion stands by the dissolution of the Flemish Council and the creation of a new Flemish state. The Frontbeweging on the other hand, mainly composed of Weltkrieg veterans, stands by the Flemish Council and has been tearing men away from the combined effort to support the Vlaamse Wacht. The Geuzengroep is torn apart between its founding members who were part of the Vlaamse Wacht and the recruited partisans who fought out of anti-German sentiment and general discontent with the Flemish Council.\n\nA fourth faction has also emerged during the rebellion, consisting of mainly Dutch volunteers and Groot-Nederlands sympathisers. While their numbers are limited, support from the Dutch army and a stalemate between the other factions could result in their victory.\n\nWith no end in sight, the different factions are seeking the disarming of the others and to use the influence of both Church and State to achieve their goals."
 flnrev.4.a: "The Secret Legion achieves a majority."
 flnrev.4.b: "The Frontbeweging wins over the Geuzengroep."
 flnrev.4.c: "The Groot-Nederlandisten strengthen their power."

#Secret Legion

 flnrev.51.t: "Secret Legion Emerges Victorious the Stalemate"
 flnrev.51.d: "By sowing discontent in the ranks of the Frontbeweging and winning over the recruits of the Geuzengroep, the Secret Legion has been able to convince enough members of the resistance to their cause to force total disarmament on the other factions. While most of them have agreed with these terms and laid down their weapons, small pockets of radicals still remain throughout the countryside trying to gain the support of farmers and royalist civilians."
 flnrev.51.a: "Move on the capital!"

 flnrev.52.t: "Clashes Between the Vlaamse Wacht and the Secret Legion"
 flnrev.52.d: "The Secret Legion has finally achieved enough control to liberate the Assembly and are moving into Brussels trying to break the Vlaamse Wacht's stranglehold over the city and the national leadership. Inside the Assembly, Van Severen is still trying to convince members to support the continuation of the Flemish Council but word is spreading through the ranks that the Liberation Army is moving in."
 flnrev.52.a: "The Secret Legion defeats the Vlaamse Wacht."
 flnrev.52.b: "The Vlaamse Wacht holds out against the Secret Legion."

 flnrev.53.t: "Liberation of the National Assembly"
 flnrev.53.d: "With the defeat of the Vlaamse Wacht, the last power base of the Council has been disbanded and a new government can be established. Rooting out the remnants of their organisation will take time and effort though as last of their supporters still hold out in some of the Flemish villages."
 flnrev.53.a: "A provisional government is established."

#Frontbeweging

 flnrev.61.t: "The Frontbeweging Unifies With the Geuzengroep"
 flnrev.61.d: "Efforts by the Secret Legion to win the support of the Geuzengroep recruits have been successfully repulsed and even though their member count has dropped, reinforcement of the movement by experienced veterans of the Frontbeweging has enabled the combined group to consolidate their power and face the Secret Legion head on."
 flnrev.61.a: "The Secret Legion refuses disarmament!"

 flnrev.62.t: "Clashes Between the Secret Legion and the Frontbeweging"
 flnrev.62.d: "Seeing themselves as the last protectors of Flemish liberalism, the Secret Legion has entrenched itself in West-Flanders, recruiting civilians and repulsing attacks by the combined movement. The Frontbeweging has decided to post a large portion of their forces to safeguard the movement while reinforcements are sent to Brussels to increase pressure on the Assembly."
 flnrev.62.a: "The Council controls the army!"

 flnrev.63.t: "The National Assembly Gives In"
 flnrev.63.d: "Either convinced by the speeches of Van Severen and other Council members or pressured by the armed forces outside, the Assembly has given in and voted in favour of maintaining the continued existence of the Flemish Council. While all parties openly support the decision, behind the scenes plans for a more democratic government are being created."
 flnrev.63.a: "The Flemish Council rules supreme."

 flnrev.631.t: "Destruction of the Secret Legion"
 flnrev.631.d: "After their victory in Brussels, the forces of Flanders have turned their eyes back to West-Flanders where the last remnants of the Secret Legion have embedded themselves. By offering full amnesty to all who surrender as recognition of their deeds in the liberation of Flanders, many Legion members surrendered to the Flemish forces allowing for a swift end to the surviving extremist elements."
 flnrev.631.a: "Peace has once again been secured."

 flnrev.641.t: "Frontbeweging Reforms into the Frontpartij"
 flnrev.641.d: "With the Flemish Council firmly in power and reinforced by the Vlaamse Wacht, the Frontbeweging has agreed to lay down its arms. Prominent members of the movement have been awarded seats in the Council and have created their own party: the Frontpartij. They are strong supporters of the independent Flemish nation and have petitioned for a rewards programme for successful Resistance members."
 flnrev.641.a: "A first step towards a peaceful democracy."

 flnrev.81.t: "The VNV and Van Severen Unite"
 flnrev.81.d: "Due to the most unfortunate resignations of some of staunchest royalists in the Council and their replacement by VNV nationalists, Van Severen has acquired a slim majority. A vote on the continuation of the Regency will be the first point on the agenda during the next session and it looks set to be easily repulsed by his followers."
 flnrev.81.a: "Dark times are approaching."

 flnrev.82.t: "Resistance From the Frontbeweging"
 flnrev.82.d: "While the Frontbeweging supported the Council during the early days of the nation, this have heavily frowned upon its power grab. Many members of the movement have publicly spoken out against Van Severen in the Council, switching sides to the royalists. Though this is a mild setback for Van Severen's plans, further replacement of the Council members should still sway the vote in his favour."
 flnrev.82.a: "The vote is approaching."

 flnrev.83.t: "End of the Regency"
 flnrev.83.d: "With a small majority, Van Severen has been able to win the vote thus ending the Regency and replacing the monarchy with a more autocratic regime. The Flemish Council now retains full control of the Government and decides on all matters of state. While new members can still enter the Council, most seats are reserved for Van Severen's most loyal supporters thus repressing any real form of opposition."
 flnrev.83.a: "Van Severen and the VNV rule supreme."

 flnrev.84.t: "The Brussels Question"
 flnrev.84.d: "Nearly all of Flanders solely speaks Flemish but in the former capital of Belgium, a large French minority remains with their own education system and facilities. While their impact so far has been fairly limited and their size is diminishing due to German and now Flemish policies, the VNV has urged the Council to take a more forceful approach. They have demanded the complete abolition of French education and the unification of the VUB and ULB. All streets referring to French speaking Brusselois are to be changed and a strict uniform Flemish language enforced on the population."
 flnrev.84.a: "Retain the slow approach."
 flnrev.84.b: "Follow the VNV plan."

 flnrev.65.t: "The Aristocracy Increases Its Power"
 flnrev.65.d: "Sensing serious divisions between the factions in the Flemish Council, the old Flemish aristocracy has managed to boost its support and the loyalty of its members. Borrowing heavily from the disintegrating Van Severen faction, the conservative Catholics and some of the Liberals, the movement is steadily growing in power and confidence. Sensing an opportunity to increase his power in Flanders, Adelbert has offered the movement both monetary and political support."
 flnrev.65.a: "His offer is accepted."
 flnrev.65.b: "Refuse the German traitor!"

 flnrev.651.t: "Aristocratic Push For Power"
 flnrev.651.d: "After gathering enough influence for their faction, leading members of the nobility have gone ahead and declared a formal royal debate in the Flemish Council. Over the next few weeks, the Council must reach a decision between opting for a Flemish king of the House Van Vlaanderen or to symbolically offer the crown to Adelbert so they can reign freely without interference from a constitutional monarch."
 flnrev.651.a: "Karel Van Vlaanderen is elected King."
 flnrev.651.b: "Offer Adelbert the Flemish crown."

 flnrev.652.t: "The Flemish Crown?"
 flnrev.652.d: "The Flemish nobility has been able to seize power in the Flemish Council and has elected Adelbert to be their monarch. This would be a strictly nominal title as Adelbert is still not allowed to interfere in any Flemish politics, leaving power to the nobility."
 flnrev.652.a: "Accept the crown."
 flnrev.652.b: "Refuse their proposal."

 flnrev.653.t: "Adelbert Refuses the Crown"
 flnrev.653.d: "Adelbert has refused the Flemish crown and as such it's passed down to Karel Van Vlaanderen who has agreed to return to Flanders and take up the title."
 flnrev.653.a: "Crown the King!"

 flnrev.66.t: "Aristocratic Conspiracy Discovered!"
 flnrev.66.d: "A devastating series of article outlining allegations of nepotism and corruption within the aristocracy have been published on the front pages of both the Vooruit and De Standaard. Fully exposing their connections to the German King in Wallonia and the money trails back to Berlin, a massive crowd has gathered in Brussels to demonstrate against these perceived traitors to Flanders and their Council cronies. Pressure to overhaul the Council and open elections to all is mounting and may soon escalate if nothing is done."
 flnrev.66.a: "Close ranks, we must uphold the status quo."
 flnrev.66.b: "Dismiss all members implicated in the scandal!"

 flnrev.67.t: "The Aristocratic Question"
 flnrev.67.d: "Protests against the establishment are growing in size and number with many large organised rallies forming in Ghent and Aalter. 'For too long has the aristocracy profited from our sweat, for too long has a foreign monarch sent Flemish soldiers to die. No more!'. The VWP is quickly playing on the unrest and is urging workers to strike until the Council has been cleared of these traitors."
 flnrev.67.a: "Unrest is growing!"

 flnrev.68.t: "Attack on the Council"
 flnrev.68.d: "During his exit from the Flemish Council, Charles d'Aspremont Lynden was hit square on the face with a complete cream-cake in a protest against his title and place in the Council. While he seems to have escaped without further injury, reporters were able to take an ample number of pictures to sate the newspapers."
 flnrev.68.a: "These people are deranged."

 flnrev.69.t: "Protest in Brussels"
 flnrev.69.d: "Over a hundred thousand citizens have come down to the capital to persuade the Council to give up its protection of the aristocracy and German loyalists. The crowd has threatened that if their demands are not met a nationwide strike will be held until they give in. Council morale is faltering while the Vlaamse Wacht is starting to lose control of the crowds. Now that the power of Hendrik Elias has been broken many members are standing with the protestors."
 flnrev.69.a: "The Council gives in to public demands."

 flnrev.611.t: "Aristocractic Elements Forced From the Council"
 flnrev.611.d: "After the march on Brussels, the Council has finally given in to the demands of the public and dismissed all members holding titles or retaining loyalty to the German puppet King. The path to a free Flemish Republic is now finally opening up and propaganda is starting to flood the streets intending on swaying voters towards one of the parties."
 flnrev.611.a: "It's finally time for elections."

 flnrev.612.t: "Aristocractic Elements Forced From the Council"
 flnrev.612.d: "With the pressure from all sides starting to become unbearable and the nation becoming virtually ungovernable, the Council has finally given in to the demands of the public and dismissed all members holding titles or retaining loyalty to the German puppet King. The path to a free Flemish Republic is now finally opening up and propaganda is starting to flood the streets intending on swaying voters towards one of the parties."
 flnrev.612.a: "It's finally time for elections."

#Groot-Nederlandisten

 flnrev.71.t: "The Groot-Nederlandisten Grow in Power"
 flnrev.71.d: "Due to the endless bickering between the other factions, the Groot-Nederlandisten have been able to massive increase their number of supporters by attracting Dutch immigrants and intellectuals from both Ghent and Leuven. While they are still the smallest faction in the Liberation Army, they are starting to sway popular opinion by promoting the Flemish unification with the Netherlands and a stronger global Flanders. Without the armed support that the other factions enjoy however, they are unlikely to be able to achieve these goals. Therefore support from the Dutch will be required, who themselves are suffering from their own political issues."
 flnrev.71.a: "We must request Dutch aid!"

 flnrev.72.t: "The Flemish Groot-Nederlandisten Approach Us"
 flnrev.72.d: "After the recent independence of Flanders and the dissolution of the old Flandern-Walloon union, divides between the Council and the Liberation Army have been growing leading to increased unrest. A smaller faction in the Flemish Liberation Army that has emerged from the maelstrom is the Groot-Nederlandisten movement, a group which openly strives for Flemish unification with the Netherlands. While their member count is lower than that of other movements, they enjoy a large intellectual base in Leuven and Ghent that is requesting our government step in and send them military support."
 flnrev.72.a: "Support the Groot-Nederlandisten."
 flnrev.72.b: "Withdraw all connections to the movement."

 flnrev.73.t: "The Dutch Refuse Support"
 flnrev.73.d: "Our request for aid has been denied by the Dutch and they have severed all connections with the resistance group. With no chance of success on their own, the movement will now inevitably have to pick a side in the conflict between the Secret Legion and the Frontbeweging in order to survive. While siding with the Secret Legion may guarantee a shot at winning the coming elections and free promotion of the movement, siding with the Frontbeweging has its own benefits. Van Severen has already shown strong tendencies towards a pro-Dutch unification stance and siding with him may fulfil our goals."
 flnrev.73.a: "Unite with the Secret Legion."
 flnrev.73.b: "The Frontbeweging have our support."

 flnrev.74.t: "The Dutch Send Support"
 flnrev.74.d: "The Dutch have answered our call and decided to send weapons, equipment and experienced personnel to assist our movement in securing Flanders. With discussion escalating between the Frontbeweging and the Secret Legion, now is our time to strike and paralyse both movements at the same time, while the Dutch army prepares for their attack."
 flnrev.74.a: "The Netherlands shall be united once more!"

 flnrev.75.t: "The Dutch Military Moves In!"
 flnrev.75.d: "With supplies and operations of the resistance movements severely damaged, elements of the Dutch army have quickly been able to secure the cities of Antwerp and Ghent with divisions already moving into Brussels. The Vlaamse Wacht was no match for our fully supplied army and was quickly forced to lay down its weapons as well, transferring power to the Dutch forces. Members of the Groot-Nederlandisten movement have been appointed by the Dutch authorities as a transitional government while Amsterdam awaits the inexorable German response."
 flnrev.75.a: "The Netherlands are united once more!"

 FLA_Kickstart_Flemish_Army: "Kickstart the Flemish Army"
 FLA_Kickstart_Flemish_Army_desc: "A ragtag resistance no more, the Flemish Liberation Army must be fully integrated into the apparatus of state."

 FLA_establish_the_air_force: "Establish the Air Force"
 FLA_establish_the_air_force_desc: "Most of Flanders-Wallonia's air force was based in Wallonia throughout due to the more strategically important location of the region's main airfields. Thus, we must do now what we Flems have always done: adapt. With focus and increased funding, surely the effectiveness of our fledgling air force will be the envy of the world."
 FLA_heavy_fighter_effort: "Heavy Fighter Effort"
 FLA_heavy_fighter_effort_desc: "Fighter aircraft must be versatile first and foremost and possess a range adequate to conduct operations in far flung theatres if need be. We should thus focus on the development of heavy fighters."
 FLA_light_fighter_effort: "Light Fighter Effort"
 FLA_light_fighter_effort_desc: "Large long-range fighters are cumbersome jacks-of-all-trades, kings of none. Our fighters must be agile yet deadly, capable of wresting control of the skies from even the strongest enemy."
 FLA_cas_focus: "CAS Focus"
 FLA_cas_focus_desc: "With the assistance of specialised aircraft, our boys will fight all that much more effectively. While we may now be playing catch-up, with a concerted national effort to develop close-air-support craft, the men will soon fight like never before."
 FLA_tac_focus: "Tactical Bomber Focus"
 FLA_tac_focus_desc: "Medium bombers are the backbone of a truly independent air force. Capable of both supporting our forces on land and sea and attacking enemy buildings and installations, we must make a national effort to develop more effective models of such aircraft."

 FLA_army_maneuvers: "Army Manoeuvres"
 FLA_army_maneuvers_desc: "While the army has been formally established, it still operates much like the resistance it once was. To really hammer home that the status-quo had changed, we should hold a large wargame encouraging the organisation and order our forces must grow to possess."

 FLA_mobile_focus: "Mobile Focus"
 FLA_mobile_focus_desc: "The enemy must not be allowed to approach our cities and threaten our homes. We must use speed and careful planning to defeat them outright."
 FLA_Minerva_Trucks: "Minerva Trucks"
 FLA_Minerva_Trucks_desc: "Based in Antwerp, Minerva is the country's foremost producer of automobiles and bicycles. While Minerva dabbled in military production under the Flemish-Walloon regime, with independence, it is all the more essential that we subsidise Minerva's transformation into a military vehicle supplier."
 FLA_develop_tanks: "Develop Tanks"
 FLA_develop_tanks_desc: "British tanks were particularly effective during the Weltkrieg and despite German victory, the world saw the potential of this new machine of war. We must develop more advanced models of our own to truly take advantage of them."
 FLA_Remember_The_Yzer: "Remember the Yzer"
 FLA_Remember_The_Yzer_desc: "With an indomitable will, Flemish men bravely held the Yzer River. That same spirit with which this stand was made must be promoted throughout our armed forces."
 FLA_armored_warfare: "Armoured Warfare"
 FLA_armored_warfare_desc: "Our forces are capable of moving rapidly and defeating an enemy before it can react. Let us fully embrace armoured warfare and tailor our doctrine entirely around mobility."

 FLA_home_defense: "Defend Our Home"
 FLA_home_defense_desc: "The suffering experienced under German occupation has left in our people an inclination towards defensive warfare."
 FLA_FN_Assault_Rifles: "FN Assault Rifles"
 FLA_FN_Assault_Rifles_desc: "While FN largely operated from the Walloon town of Herstal, the state company also had smaller facilities in Flanders. We should amalgamate these holdings into a new Flemish arms company focused on the research and development of cutting edge small arms."
 FLA_artillery_effort: "Artillery Effort"
 FLA_artillery_effort_desc: "The guns of the Weltkrieg ground advances to a halt. New and improved models of artillery possess this same ability, but suffer much less from the issues which plagued artillery pieces in that war. To fully secure our lands, we must have such weapons, and in massive quantities."
 FLA_In_Flanders_Fields: "In Flanders Fields"
 FLA_In_Flanders_Fields_desc: "In Flanders fields the poppies blow./Between the crosses, row on row, / That mark our place; and in the sky / The larks, still bravely singing, fly / Scarce heard amid the guns below.\n\nOur experience in the Weltkrieg is without parallel. Through careful planning and coordination, man upon man who dares to brave our lands shall find an early grave."

 FLA_naval_warfare: "Naval Warfare"
 FLA_naval_warfare_desc: "During the Weltkrieg, both sides recognised the strategic importance of the Flemish coast, and many invasions there were planned, though such grand designs ultimately fell through. Both for our defence and for our ability to project power abroad, we should focus on expanding our navy and supporting infrastructure."
 FLA_Focus_On_Capital_Ships: "Focus on Capital Ships"
 FLA_Focus_On_Capital_Ships_desc: "Mighty battleships and burgeoning aircraft carriers incur both massive risks and reward. While their cost may be great, if our navy is to have any impact on global stage, we must base its doctrine around an unwavering backbone of capital ships."
 FLA_capital_ships: "Capital Ship Effort"
 FLA_capital_ships_desc: "While for our small nation to develop dreadnoughts would be but a waste of resources, battleships are well within reach. These kings of the bristle with guns both large and small and are key to the proper implementation of our new naval doctrine."
 FLA_Focus_On_Raiding_Ships: "Focus on Raiding Ships"
 FLA_Focus_On_Raiding_Ships_desc: "As a small nation, we may still project disproportionate naval power through the use of submarines and interdiction tactics. The great powers of this world shall fear the Flemish hounds of the sea!"
 FLA_destroyers: "Destroyer Effort"
 FLA_destroyers_desc: "With investment in submarine development, we should now look to create equally advanced destroyer models to both directly support them and perform missions to frustrate the enemy's ability to counter the threat of our submarines."
 FLA_cruisers: "Cruiser Effort"
 FLA_cruisers_desc: "Cruisers fill a multitude of roles, supporting ships both large and small. We should develop new advanced cruiser models."
 FLA_submarines: "Submarine Effort"
 FLA_submarines_desc: "Small and stealthy with deadly armaments, submarines are the bain of merchant ships and vessels of war alike; even a single midget sub could sink an enemy dreadnought or carrier. The Germans defeated British shipping in the Weltkrieg with their U-boats and our enemies shall suffer the same fate."
 FLA_carriers: "Carrier Effort"
 FLA_carriers_desc: "The role of aircraft in naval warfare has grown rapidly in recent years. Based from aircraft carriers, planes can project power across the world and affect naval engagements with a consequentiality disproportionate to their cost. While carriers themselves may be quite expensive, we must develop them."

 FLA_Syndicalist_Revolution: "Syndicalist Revolution"
 FLA_Syndicalist_Revolution_desc: "While the purifying fires of revolution consumed much of the former Entente, Flanders chafed under German imperialist oppression. History, however, ultimately moves in one inevitable direction; the land and its people at last have thrown off their chains. Let us herald in the revolution and begin the process of complete socio-economic transformation."
 FLA_Collectivize_Farmlands: "Collectivise Farmlands"
 FLA_Collectivize_Farmlands_desc: "In spite of the undeniable promise of socialism for the working man, the rural peasantry owe their loyalty primarily to that great redoubt of reaction - the Church and its agents. If the countryside is to progress with the rest of the nation, farms big and small must be seized and reorganised into collectives externally managed by urban industrial syndicates."
 FLA_Take_Control_Industry: "Nationalise Industry"
 FLA_Take_Control_Industry_desc: "While many factories and mills have naturally transitioned to worker self-management, these glorious syndicates have failed to penetrate many key industries. The stain of capitalism cannot continue to sully our nation! All industry not yet sufficiently collective must be run by the state for the time being."
 FLA_Hold_Party_Congress: "Hold the Party Congress"
 FLA_Hold_Party_Congress_desc: "The issues of greatest societal import have been at least partially dealt with, and given this bit of renewed stability, we must hold the first central party congress since the founding of our new Republic."
 FLA_Distribute_Royal_Wealth: "Redistribute Royal Wealth"
 FLA_Distribute_Royal_Wealth_desc: "The tyrants who once ruled our lands by right of birth alone accumulated unparalleled wealth over the centuries. Let us repatriate this great horde to those whose toil brought such wealth into being!"
 FLA_Reduce_Christian_Influence: "Reduce Christian Influence"
 FLA_Reduce_Christian_Influence_desc: "While the rural powerbase of political Catholicism has is under control, the influence of the Church and religion can still be felt throughout the country. The people must be freed from their own unfounded belief! We must promote irreligion at every opportunity, though the current situation would make complete state atheism politically infeasible."

 FLA_Netherlands_United: "United Netherlands"
 FLA_Netherlands_United_desc: "Our nation has drawn ever closer to our linguistic brothers to the north. The process of political and economic integration, however, is sure to be slow, so let's get to it."
 FLA_Transitional_Government: "Transitional Government"
 FLA_Transitional_Government_desc: "To guide the process, we should appoint a transitional government and reach over the party lines to strive for a successful integration for everyone."
 FLA_Attachement_To_The_Netherlans: "The Dutch Attachment"
 FLA_Attachement_To_The_Netherlans_desc: "To truly unite and do away with the cultural influence of centuries of Walloon domination, Flanders must work to fully attach itself to the Netherlands. While some may resist this aggressive integration process, the reward, we know, will be great and our land shall prosper as part of a Netherlands at last made whole."
 FLA_Language_Congress_Of_Leuven: "Hold the Leuven Language Congress"
 FLA_Language_Congress_Of_Leuven_desc: "While is language is fundamentally cut from the same clothe as the standard language of the north, there are also a number of differences in spelling, pronunciation, and even grammar which limit mutual intelligibility and hamper communication. If the Dutch speaking peoples are to be truly united, or language must be standardised, drawing from both the standard Dutch spoken in the Netherlands and our own language."
 FLA_Embrace_Dutch_Culture: "Embrace Dutch Culture"
 FLA_Embrace_Dutch_Culture_desc: "We must work to promote Dutch culture in Flanders, especially where French influence still prevails. To best accomplish this, our friends in the Netherlands have put our government in close contact with cultural experts and academics in their, soon to be both our, nation."
 FLA_Centralised_Government: "Centralised Government"
 FLA_Centralised_Government_desc: "While our fundamental system of governance and political structure is similar to that of the Netherlands, irregularities abound. In preparation of integration, we should pass sweeping reforms to emulate the Dutch and make the future centralisation of authority in Amsterdam a more effective process."
 FLA_Dismantlement_Of_French_Education: "Dismantle French Education"
 FLA_Dismantlement_Of_French_Education_desc: "Flanders was long beneath the boot of Wallonia, our people forced to learn French to have any chance of advancement. With some still clinging on to a Belgian identity, the teaching of French in schools has been preserved with independence. With the backing of the Netherlands, we should work to assimilate French speakers and wind down French education."
 FLA_Recovery_Budget: "Request a Recovery Budget"
 FLA_Recovery_Budget_desc: "Our lands are significantly less developed than those to our north. In order to begin to correct this historic injustice and prepare for integration, we must have Dutch funding. The money will be put primarily towards renovating industrial complexes and improving the plethora of systematically neglected holdings throughout the country."
 FLA_Decentralised_Government: "Decentralised Government"
 FLA_Decentralised_Government_desc: "The Dutch have met our demands and the process of integration is progressing rapidly. We should now look to formulate the exact structure of the coming Flemish region within the Netherlands."
 FLA_Unified_Transportation_Net: "Unified Transportation Network"
 FLA_Unified_Transportation_Net_desc: "The process of political and economic integration has been a rousing success. The strain increased economic activity has brought and issues caused by differences in our transportation systems with those of our Northern friends has become a burden. We must work to standardise all manner of minutia and connect many purely domestic transportation networks with the Netherlands proper."
 FLA_Vlaamse_Spoorwegen: "Vlaamse Spoorwegen"
 FLA_Vlaamse_Spoorwegen_desc: "The Dutch Nationale Spoorwegen must be replicated in Flanders, with a rapid expansion funded by the Netherlands with a single administration responsible for it. This new Vlaamse Spoorwegen, however, must not be subordinate to its northern counterpart, it must be Flanders alone that manages its own transportation systems!"
 FLA_Fullfill_Integration: "Fulfil Integration"
 FLA_Fullfill_Integration_desc: "Key points of contention with our northern brethren have been resolved and our nations physically connected like never before. Let us at long last be integrated into the Netherlands!"
 FLA_Nation_Within_A_Nation: "Nation Within a Nation"
 FLA_Nation_Within_A_Nation_desc: "Flanders must be united with its cultural brethren, but it cannot be subjugated. Within this new united Netherlands, our region must be a nation unto itself, with sweeping autonomy and assurances to the continued survival of a unique Flemish identity."
 FLA_Demand_Recognition_Of_The_Flemish_Language: "Demand Flemish Language Recognition"
 FLA_Demand_Recognition_Of_The_Flemish_Language_desc: "Our language is distinct in many ways from that of our northern neighbours. The recognition of our linguistic autonomy is contingent to any further progress towards our integration into the Netherlands. The Dutch will inevitably protest strongly, and as such, we must make a concerted national effort to assure that our demands are met in full."
 FLA_Separate_Flemish_Parties: "Separate Flemish Parties"
 FLA_Separate_Flemish_Parties_desc: "While through centuries of struggle, our land won autonomy within Belgium. While we have chosen rightly to throw or lot in with the Netherlands, there can be no compromise; Flanders must enjoy at least the same degree of political autonomy it did as a part of Belgium. To that end Flemish political parties must be allowed to establish themselves in the Netherlands and only our own parties can be allowed to compete in local Flemish elections."

 FLA_Economic_Transition: "Economic Cooperation"
 FLA_Economic_Transition_desc: "Plans for a thorough economic cooperation system date back to the 1820s when King Willem of the Netherlands still fostered plans to use Belgium as his manufacturing base whilst the Dutch ports would ship the products out. With our renewed union, the time has come to mend the broken relations and foster the integration of both economies into a unified system."
 FLA_Expand_Maastricht_Limburg_Corridor: "Expand the Maastricht-Hasselt Axis"
 FLA_Expand_Maastricht_Limburg_Corridor_desc: "Limburg on both sides of the old national borders has always been a neglected part of our nations and although a strong connection between the Limbourgish people of Flemish and Dutch Limburg kept the region somewhat united, the infrastructure and industry of the region were left far behind that of other provinces. The loss of the Walloon mines has now prompted us to focus on this province and to bring the outdated region up to speed with the rest of the nation."
 FLA_Deepen_The_Westerschelde: "Deepen the Westerschelde"
 FLA_Deepen_The_Westerschelde_desc: "The Westerschelde is the lifeblood of the Flemish economy as its main export harbours, those of Gent and Antwerpen rely on its connection to the North Sea. Requests to deepen the Westerschelde and as such allow larger ships to enter have been denied as the harbour of Rotterdam, the largest competitor of Antwerpen, and as such the Dutch government saw its expansion as a threat to their economy. As the borders are now lifted, the Dutch have finally agreed."
 FLA_Unified_Dutch_Currency: "Unified Dutch Currency"
 FLA_Unified_Dutch_Currency_desc: "Currently the Mark and the Gulden are used intertwined in Flanders as the rushed union with the Netherlands and the Black Monday crash has left the Flemish economy in the dumpster and without clear regulation. To ameliorate the issue, the ministry of financial affairs has agreed with Dutch demands to fully embrace the Gulden."
 FLA_Shell_In_Antwerpian_Harbour: "Shell in Antwerp Harbour"
 FLA_Shell_In_Antwerpian_Harbour_desc: "Lacking domestic oil production yet having a high need for the black gold, refineries in the harbours of Antwerpen and Gent have long attempted to keep as much of the oil industry domestically, only importing the raw material. As German companies are in shambles and with the importance worldwide of Shell, the city of Antwerpen has offered a concession to the company in the hopes of securing a reliable connection to the oil fields and reduce dependence on Dutch ports."
 FLA_Development_Of_Zeeuws_Vlaanderen: "Development of Zeeuws-Vlaanderen"
 FLA_Development_Of_Zeeuws_Vlaanderen_desc: "Zeeuws-Vlaanderen is a curious little province within the Dutch nation. Although it is predominantly inhabited by people sharing our Flemish culture, it refused to join Belgium in 1830 and has slowly created its own identity. Nonetheless one cannot deny that people from Zeeuws-Vlaanderen often work, live and shop in our lands and that one of the main economic hubs of the region, Terneuzen, is almost entirely dependent on the harbour of Gent."
 FLA_Flemish_Dutch_Scientific_Cooperation: "Flemish-Dutch Scientific Cooperation"
 FLA_Flemish_Dutch_Scientific_Cooperation_desc: "As we are now one nation, it is only reasonable that we pool our intellectual strength and improve our standing in the global scientific community."

 FLA_Regency_By_The_Flemish_Council: "Regency by the Flemish Council"
 FLA_Regency_By_The_Flemish_Council_desc: "The Flemish Council has established itself as the only legitimate form of government and quelled the radical ideas of the resistance. They are however meant to act solely as an advising organ to a King, a position that currently remains vacant."
 FLA_Direct_Rule_From_Council: "Absolute Rule of the Council"
 FLA_Direct_Rule_From_Council_desc: "The King only held us back! Without his oversight Van Severen and the VNV can reign freely and with an iron fist, eliminating all opposition and safeguarding our nation from the syndicalist threat."
 FLA_Unify_The_State: "Unify the State"
 FLA_Unify_The_State_desc: "While the abolition of the regency has increased the power of the Council substantially, its popularity is at an all time low. Large scale propaganda actions and nationalist rhetoric will sway our citizens to see that the enemy isn't on the inside but outside of Flanders."
 FLA_Crack_Down_On_Syndicalism: "Crack Down on Syndicalism"
 FLA_Crack_Down_On_Syndicalism_desc: "The Syndicalist movement cannot be allowed to exist in our country as it undermines our authority and falsely strays our sheep onto the wrong path. Strong and decisive action against its leadership may put the organisation out of its misery."
 #FLA_Enforce_Flemish: "Enforce Flemish" already defined above as an idea
 FLA_Enforce_Flemish_desc: "Flanders is a nation for the Flemish, not the Germans and most definitely not the French. By working together with the VNV we can end the facility towns on the language border and enforce a strict form of Flemish education. French will no longer be taught as a third language and will be strictly outlawed by the Council."
 #FLA_Democratic_Transition: "Democratic Transition" already defined above as an idea
 FLA_Democratic_Transition_desc: "The Council has only temporarily taken control and awaits the appointment of a new monarch. Tensions between the nobility and the nouveau riche are increasing with both groups seeking to stall the election until their power is secure."
 FLA_Expansion_Of_Council: "Expand the Council"
 FLA_Expansion_Of_Council_desc: "The Council is locked in a stalemate and the people on the streets are growing restless due to their exclusion from the Council and wider political franchise. Therefore we plan to open up fifty new places in the Council for all to compete over. Both the Catholics and the VWP would vie for these places as obtaining them could give them the majority they seek."
 FLA_For_The_People_By_The_People: "For the People By the People"
 FLA_For_The_People_By_The_People_desc: "No longer shall we be a German lapdog. The people have spoken and it's clear that they are heavily resisting the influence of both the aristocracy and the remnants of the German regime. Only a government chosen by and from the Flemish people will be tolerated!"
 FLA_Constitutional_Monarchy: "Constitutional Monarchy"
 FLA_Constitutional_Monarchy_desc: "Flanders is a monarchy and should re-invite the Count of Flanders to take control. His role would be heavily restricted due to the failures of Adelbert's regime, but he should still serve as our symbol of national unity to help guide the nation in times of peril!"

 FLA_Proclaim_The_County_Of_Flanders_desc: "It was during the rule of the Counts of Flanders that we achieved our national zenith.

 FLA_Flemish_Revanchism: "Flemish Revanchism"
 FLA_Flemish_Revanchism_desc: "In recent centuries we have been the toy of nearly every major European power and have on many occasions lost hard won land. No more! Flanders does not forgive nor does it forget its brothers abroad!"
 FLA_Zeeuws_Vlaanderen: "The Zeeuws-Vlaanderen Question"
 FLA_Zeeuws_Vlaanderen_desc: "The people of Zeeuws-Vlaanderen are just as Flemish as the Brusselois but have been stolen from our nation by the Dutch. With the recent independence of the Flemish State and due to the large amount of Flemish people commuting there from our nation, pushing the Dutch government for a referendum might result in the secession of their province to our rightful control."
 FLA_Frans_Vlaanderen: "Infiltrate Frans-Vlaanderen"
 FLA_Frans_Vlaanderen_desc: "Lost to France in the 18th century, the lands around Duinkerke and Rijsel still hold large Flemish speaking minorities which we should liberate from French oppression!"
 FLA_Revise_The_Flandern_German_Treaty: "Revise the Flandro-German Treaty"
 FLA_Revise_The_Flandern_German_Treaty_desc: "One of the conditions of our independence was to pay hefty reparations to Germany to make sure we couldn't escape their sphere of influence.

 FLA_Dismantlement_Of_Vlaamse_Wacht_desc: "Not only did the Vlaamse Wacht serve the German King, but they also sided with Van Severen and the power grab of the Council. In order to secure our nation's stability, they must be fully dissolved and integrated into the Rijkswacht."
