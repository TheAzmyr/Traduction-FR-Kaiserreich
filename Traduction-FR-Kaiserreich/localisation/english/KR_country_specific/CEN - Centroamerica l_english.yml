 cend.1.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Sends an Embassy"

 cend.1.d.GUA_socialist: "With the success of the socialist-Unity coalition, we have managed to escape the grasps of both Ubico and Orellana against all odds. This has managed to open up diplomacy with other like-minded revolutionary nations, the most recent example being [From.GetNameDefCap]. They hope to build ties with us and others to free the rest of Central America from what we also suffered from. Hopefully this can mean closer cooperation between our nations into the future."
 cend.1.d.GUA_liberal: "Since we have achieved greater democracy, our liberal friends from [From.GetNameDefCap] have approached us to establish closer ties. This is a grand gesture, one we cannot ignore. We must cooperate with our friends to further democracy in the rest of Central America."
 cend.1.d.GUA_military: "We have been approached by [From.GetNameDefCap]. They know our struggle and after we have successfully remained in power, they have now come to us with an offer of friendship. We cannot refuse this, as we are always threatened by revolution."

This has been noticed by the fellow revolutionary country of [From.GetNameDefCap], hoping to build ties with us to free the rest of Central America from what we also suffered from. Hopefully this can mean closer cooperation between our nations into the future."
 cend.1.d.ELS_liberal: "[From.GetNameDefCap] have sent a delegation to establish closer ties, following our restoration of the presidency.

 cend.1.d.HON_socialist: "Despite many questioning the legitimacy of our socialism across Central America, it is universally agreed that we stand alongside the revolution with our Central American partners. As a result, [From.GetNameDefCap] has sent an embassy congratulating our new government for its success in its revolution, hoping for further collaboration down the line."
 cend.1.d.HON_liberal: "After successfully holding our first truly open elections, our democratic friends from [From.GetNameDefCap] have come to us to establish closer ties. This is a great proposition and we will together work on strengthening democracy in both our countries, and in the rest of Central America."
 cend.1.d.HON_military: "Now that we are firmly in power, [From.GetNameDefCap] have offered to develop closer ties. We must accept this, so we can work together to prevent revolution spreading throughout Central America.

 cend.1.d.NIC_socialist: "As we have managed to survive through the storm of American occupation and Central American crisis, we are a highly desired ally among revolutionaries within Central America. [From.GetNameDefCap] has recognised this, sending us an embassy to ensure further cooperation between our nations."
 cend.1.d.NIC_liberal: "Following our liberal transformation, [From.GetNameDefCap] has approached us to congratulate us on our achievement and with the offer of developing closer ties.

 cend.1.d.NIC_military: "[From.GetNameDefCap] have come to us to develop better relations. We cannot refuse this as we are always at risk of being consumed by revolution, that is the nature of our regime. Developing closer ties with the countries like us will make sure that revolution will not spread throughout Central America."

 cend.1.a: "Socialist unity comes out strong."

The liberals who have betrayed us so many times in the past, the military dictators who have hurt us, and the foreign oppressors who support them. It is time this shackle is thrown off once and for all!"
 cend.5.d.liberal: "The Revolutionary Front, founded by [From.GetNameDefCap] is meant to be a pact to organise the men of Central America against those who would oppress them.

It is time this shackle is thrown off once and for all!"
 cend.5.d.military: "The Revolutionary Front, founded by [From.GetNameDefCap] is meant to be a pact to organise the men of Central America against those who would oppress them.

Furthermore, they claim that the Pact will be a bastion against socialist revolutionaries. We must prevent them from endangering our revolution!"
 cend.6.d.liberal: "[From.GetNameDefCap] has founded the Liberal Pact! it is designed to bring together the liberal countries of Central America to resist the evil growth of military dictatorships and socialist revolutionaries. Those who join it will defend each other and make sure that its members remain democratic."
 cend.6.d.military: "[From.GetNameDefCap] has founded the Liberal Pact! They aim to bring together what they call the liberal nations of Central America.

 cend.6.b: "It's time for true democracy!"
 cend.6.c: "You can't beat military democracy!"

 cend.7.t: "Formation of the People's Vanguard"
 cend.7.d.socialist: "The crooked dictatorship of [From.GetNameDefCap] has formed the People's Vanguard. They seek to insulate themselves from revolution by working together with other dictatorships! We will not allow this. We must prevent their coalition from taking shape and we must work hard to prevent them from ending the revolution in Central America. If they get what they want, all our work may be for nothing!"
 cend.7.d.liberal: "Because robbing their own people of their freedom is not enough, [From.GetNameDefCap] has formed the People's Vanguard. It is aimed to protect themselves from any outside challenge to their rule. We know that such an illiberal pact will soon fail, but we must make sure they do not permanently smother the torch of liberty in the rest of Central America. We must do everything we can to prevent them from attacking our democracy!"
 cend.7.d.military: "[From.GetNameDefCap] has founded the People's Vanguard! Just like us, they prefer a stronger type of government and for that reason, there are many who are jealous and seek to topple our governments. They seek to end this by working together to defend Central America from the rising tide of revolution."

 cend.8.d.liberal: "Our work has not been for nothing, as [From.GetNameDefCap] has joined the Liberal Pact! Together we will be stronger than alone and together we will be able to defend our shared values and our democracy. Together we can protect what is ours from the military dictators and socialist revolutionaries who wish to take it from us."
 cend.8.d.military: "Our friends in [From.GetNameDefCap] have joined the People's Vanguard. We no longer stand alone in our struggle to contain the revolution in Central America. We will work together with them to prevent any kind of spark from threatening the stability of our rule. Together, we will be even stronger as the liberals and socialists are isolated."
 cend.8.a: "Together for victory!"
 cend.8.b: "The torch of liberty stands strong."

 cend.9.b: "[CEN_petition_refuse_option]"

 cend.9.d.socialist: "We have been petitioned to join the Revolutionary Front, the pact founded by [From.GetNameDefCap]! They have asked us to join them in their revolutionary struggle to help rally the men and women of Central America to truly liberate us all. They say that we can only resist our oppressors together. If we are united in this pact, we now we have to decide whether or not their struggle is also ours."
 CEN_petition_accept_socialist: "Together for victory!"
 CEN_petition_refuse_socialist: "Victory will have to be sought after on their own."

 cend.9.d.liberal: "[From.GetNameDefCap] has asked us to join the Liberal Pact. Its stated aim is to further liberalism and democracy in Central America.

 CEN_petition_refuse_liberal: "Liberty belongs in one country, not many."

 cend.9.d.military: "We have been petitioned by [From.GetNameDefCap] to join the People's Vanguard.

They say that without cooperation, the countries of Central America will one by one fall to revolution. We must decide whether it is worth it to join their cause."
 CEN_petition_accept_military: "Cooperation is key in desperate times."
 CEN_petition_refuse_military: "We can stand on our own."

 cend.10.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Joins the [ROOT.GetFactionName]"

Not only are our forces united and will we be better prepared to wage war on our enemies, but our spirits are united as well, something which will undoubtedly help advance the revolutionary mindset of our country! Hail to our new brothers and sisters!"
 cend.10.d.liberal: "[From.GetNameDefCap] has accepted our request to join the Liberal Pact. They have made an excellent decision, as together we can create a lasting impact on our corner of the world and safeguard democracy for generations to come! United, we will make sure that the torch of liberty will not be extinguished. We will protect them and they will protect us."
 cend.10.d.military: "[From.GetNameDefCap] has made a wise decision and have heeded our petition. By doing this, we will make sure that together we will fight against the liberals and socialists who seek to topple our rightfully installed regimes. We fight for the people, more than the revolutionaries ever will. With the help of [From.GetNameDefCap], we will keep the revolution at aby."

 cend.11.d.socialist: "The cowards of [From.GetNameDefCap] have denied our petition. Instead of joining our forces in order to empower the revolution, they have decided to deny us and go their own path, thus betraying our revolution. But our spirits are strong and even without the help of our fellow Central Americans, we can take a stand against our oppressors. We will not let their refusal to cooperate affect us."
 cend.11.d.liberal: "[From.GetNameDefCap] has refused our petition! This is unfortunate, as we cannot be sure that freedom will remain in their country. They are vulnerable to the opportunists of this world and we do not have their support in our own struggles to come. But we are not weak, we have the power to protect ourselves, even without them and we will not forget our goals of preserving and spreading democracy!"
 cend.11.d.military: "[From.GetNameDefCap] has made a mistake by refusing to join the People's Vanguard. They and they alone will feel the consequences as we will stand strong in the People's Vanguard to keep the revolution at bay. Without them we still have the strength of our people to resist those who seek to topple our governments. We will not give up."

### Events ###
 cendem.1.t: "The Confederacy is Born!"
 cendem.1.d: "With the traitors dealt with and Central America held by our forces, we can now safely proclaim the Confederation of Central America. The dream of our nations unified under a democracy formed from each member nation is now no longer a remnant of the past. However, there is still a long way to go. As our territorial extension has grown significantly, our government has decided to delegate the executive power of the newly formed nation to the Central American Constitutional Convention until the new parties reorganise to take into account the newly acquired territories, and will decide upon the fate of the Central American Confederation once the parties with most members present themselves in the convention."
 cendem.1.a: "Long Live the Confederation!"

 cendem.2.t: "Formation of the Partido Unionista"
 cendem.2.d: "The Partido Unionista, born out of the many parties in Central America who wanted the unification of the continent, has held its first meeting in Ciudad de Guatemala. Having prepared for the unification of Central America for years, they have been the first party to present itself to the convention, and has taken over power temporarily until the other parties organise and the convention regarding the direction the country should take is held.\n\nPresided by the Guatemalan politician José Perfecto Azmitia González, the Unionist Party follows a conservative mindset and has already stated in their manifesto that their objective is to carry the Confederation to a more usual form of Republic and to create a Central American identity, that encompasses all the cultures within Central America. They also reject the intervention of foreigners in national affairs, and this might spell the end of the UFC influence in the country..."
 cendem.2.a: "The First of many parties, hopefully."

 cendem.3.t: "Formation of the Partido Unificacion Democratica"
 cendem.3.d: "The Partido de Unificación Democratica has held its first meeting as an official party of the Confederation. The meeting, held in the Honduran city of Tegucigalpa, has united the many free-market liberals that feel antagonised by the autarkical proposals of Sacasa, and have released a manifesto regarding the policies they are willing to pursue. Among them, cooperation with foreign companies like the UFC and to open Central American trade to the world. However, they claim they don't want to rely on any specific foreign power, as they see this as one of the reasons why Central America was thrown into chaos when the United States fell into the fires of Civil War.\n\nUnfortunately, not all issues have been solved during the meeting, as a faction lead by the Honduran undisputed face of liberalism, José Ángel Zúñiga, faces off opposition from a faction lead by the Nicaraguan José María Moncada. In order to solve to proclaim a party leader, the Democratic Unification Party has decided to call for an internal election amongst affiliates, and the winner will lead the party in the upcoming elections."
 cendem.3.a: "José Ángel Zuñiga stays as the solid popular choice."
 cendem.3.b: "Jose Maria Moncada comes ahead in the party polls!"

 cendem.4.t: "Formation of the Partido Liberal"
 cendem.4.d: "As the political landscape of the Central American Confederation is starting to take shape, another party has surfaced to challenge the Unionistas in the next election. The Partido Liberal has been officially founded in Managua, with the old Nicaraguan liberal Juan Bautista Sacasa as its head, has become an official party of the Confederation. The Liberals, promising economic independence for Central America and to move away from the old agricultural export-based economy towards an industrial based one. Despite this premise, they have stated that they are more than willing to cooperate with foreign companies in order to achieve this goal, which has eased unrest amongst foreign investors, particularly from the United Fruit Company that feared that their assets might be seized."
 cendem.4.a: "The flame of Liberalism continues to burn in Central America!"

 cendem.5.t: "Formation of the Partido del Trabajo"
 cendem.5.d: "As parties with grand ambitions like the Liberales or the Unionistas start their political campaign, the Partido del Trabajo has been formed in San Salvador, the many centre-left politicians and thinkers that, while agreeing in many aspects with the other parties, are more focused on helping the struggling peasants in Central America than in grand ambitions of prosperity. Amongst the many changes that the Labour Party wants to bring about to the confederation is the establishment of some form of welfare state, a land reform and the creation of a middle class, which is nearly non-existent in our country.\n\nHowever, despite bringing together many parties from different countries, it is unclear who shall lead the party during the elections, as orthodox social democracy, represented by the faction lead by Francisco Sequeira Moreno, clashes with many who follow Arturo Araujo's 'Vitalismo', a variant of Social Democracy created by the Salvadoran politician Alberto Masferrer. Elections for party affiliates have been called and the winner will represent the party in the convention and during the next elections."
 cendem.5.a: "The Rose will take root in Central America with Araujo's ideals."
 cendem.5.b: "The Rose will take root in Central America with Moreno's ideals."

 cendem.6.t: "The Constitutional Convention Starts"
 cendem.6.d: "Without a recognised central authority, managing to arrange a constitutional convention between representatives of all the newly founded parties has been difficult. No consensus could be made over which city should the convention be held, so the city of San Salvador was eventually chosen as its geographic location was near the centre of the Confederation, the city had the infrastructure to held large scale political demonstrations and it was also the symbolical place for Central American independence, as it was the place where the Primer Grito de la Independencia came to be. As the delegations arrive, proposals come forth regarding what the Confederation should look like in the near future, and the convention members have the duty to decide what shall be the future of the country."
 cendem.6.a: "We welcome you all."

 cendem.7.t: "Debate on the fate of our enemies"
 cendem.7.d: "Before the convention decides on any matter regarding the constitution, it has been deemed wise by the Unionistas to start the constitutional convention by discussing what will be done with the radicals that set out to destroy democracy in Central America. While it is clear that the death penalty is out of the question by all members of the convention, they still need to decide on a fitting punishment for the radicals. The PUD has proposed to exile the leaders and any who doesn't recognise the Federal government as legitimate, which is seen as the most lenient solution, but one that lets many criminals just walk freely. The Unionistas simply propose to imprison them for the rest of their life, which, while being a rather simple solution, could pose danger for our nation in case of a breakout. The Partido del Trabajo, on the other hand, has offered a proposal where the criminals can be imprisoned, but they can choose to work in improvised construction squads, which shall be vital during the reconstruction and improvement of our country, in exchange for reduced sentence times. Before the Convention moves forward, this matter will have to be settled, for the sake of the short term stability of our nation."
 cendem.7.a: "The proposal by the Partido de Unificación Democratica is the right one."
 cendem.7.b: "The Unionistas have a point, these criminals must not walk freely!"
 cendem.7.c: "The criminals should be allowed to earn their forgiveness!"

 cendem.8.t: "Executive power debate: The Power of the President"
 cendem.8.d: "One of the major concerns brought up, specially by the Salvadoran PT delegation, is how giving too much power to the president might be detrimental to the confederation in the long run, and so it should have its power reduced to have the congress be able to overturn a presidential decision on a two thirds majority, and they argue that it would otherwise open up the chance of an authoritarian regime rising. However, Unionistas argue that a strong executive power is needed to held the confederation in place, as the ineffective rule of the previous Confederation was what led to its eventual dissolution. After several days of debate, the convention members are once again ready to vote on the matter."
 cendem.8.a: "The President will have absolute veto power."
 cendem.8.b: "The Congress will be able to overturn a veto with a two thirds majority."

 cendem.9.t: "On the Subject of Constitutional Supremacy"
 cendem.9.d: "As the national constitution is starting to take shape, we have to decide on the role this document will take on our union. While the convention could install a constitutional supremacy clause in the document, rendering all local legislation useless if it contradicts the constitution, the Partido del Trabajo representatives argue that it would reduce the provincial autonomy to a dangerous level while empowering the Federal Government. Instead, they propose to use the constitution as a guideline for the local legislations, which shall operate freely as long as they respect some core tenets of the Federal Constitution. What should the convention choose?"
 cendem.9.a: "The Constitution should take precedence over any pesky provincial law."
 cendem.9.b: "The Constitution should serve as a guideline for the local legislations."

 cendem.10.t: "Centralise the Capital?"
 cendem.10.d: "One of the main issues brought forth by the Liberals is that a confederation should try to keep its members on equal footing, and with the convention about to choose a definitive capital for the nation, they have put forth a proposal to split the three powers of the republic to different cities in order to symbolically decentralise the nation. Should the convention members consider their proposition?"
 cendem.10.a: "No, Centralise the Confederation."
 cendem.10.b: "Yes, Split the powers to different cities."

 cendem.11.t: "Choosing a Capital"
 cendem.11.d: "After the rejection of the liberal proposal, it is now time to decide which city shall be the capital of our newly born nation. Among our choices are the old Guatemalan capital of Ciudad de Guatemala, which was the birthplace of the first confederation; San Salvador, the place where the First Cry of Independence took place more than a hundred years ago; Tegucigalpa, the original capital of the Central American republic back in 1880; and Managua, the old capital of Nicaragua and one of the greatest cities in Central America. As the convention members retire from the presidential house of San Salvador to rest until the next round of talks, the radio announces that the new capital is..."
 cendem.11.a: "Ciudad de Guatemala."
 cendem.11.b: "San Salvador."
 cendem.11.c: "Tegucigalpa."
 cendem.11.e: "Managua."

 cendem.12.t: "Choosing an Executive Capital"
 cendem.12.d: "After the acceptance of the liberal proposal, it is now time to decide which city shall be the executive capital of our newly born nation. Among our choices are the old Guatemalan capital of Ciudad de Guatemala, which was the birthplace of the first confederation; San Salvador, the place where the First Cry of Independence took place more than a hundred years ago; Tegucigalpa, the original capital of the Central American republic back in 1880; and Managua, the old capital of Nicaragua and one of the greatest cities in Central America. As the convention members retire from the presidential house of San Salvador to rest until the next round of talks, the radio announces that the new executive capital is..."
 cendem.12.a: "Ciudad de Guatemala."
 cendem.12.b: "San Salvador."
 cendem.12.c: "Tegucigalpa."
 cendem.12.e: "Managua."

 cendem.13.t: "Choosing a Judicial Capital"
 cendem.13.d: "With the executive capital chosen, the convention now has to choose a judicial capital, which shall be the place where the supreme court will be placed."
 cendem.13.a: "Ciudad de Guatemala."
 cendem.13.b: "San Salvador."
 cendem.13.c: "Tegucigalpa."
 cendem.13.e: "Managua."

 cendem.14.t: "Choosing a Legislative Capital"
 cendem.14.d: "After the Executive and Judicial capital cities have been chosen, we now have to decide which city shall have the Senate and most of the legislative body will be placed."
 cendem.14.a: "Ciudad de Guatemala."
 cendem.14.b: "San Salvador."
 cendem.14.c: "Tegucigalpa."
 cendem.14.e: "Managua."

 cendem.15.t: "Status of the Armed Forces"
 cendem.15.d: "After the defeat of the many military reactionary elements that once kept our citizens under their boot, we now have to decide what to do on the force that once gave them the power to end what once were free nations. It is recognised by all parties that a national security force is needed in order to secure our sovereignty, but each party has a different approach towards the armed forces. The Unionistas have proposed a Federal Army, subordinated to the Federal executive power and with a section under the direct control of the President, which would try to strive for professionalism and superior tactics where it was possible. The Partido del Trabajo has come up with a different proposal, aiming to create regional army structures, similar to those from before our nation was formed, they propose a confederation with individual armies which would come together in case of war, but would otherwise have very little executive power and be subjected to each province's executive power rather than the federal government. The Partido Unificación Demócratica has offered a middle ground, with a federal army backed by regional militias, similar to the system that Brazil has with their army. Once again, the convention members will take a vote in order to decide the future of our armed forces."
 cendem.15.a: "A Confederate Army with limited power is chosen as the best option."
 cendem.15.b: "Compromise is an art as old as politics, and it proves successful once more."
 cendem.15.c: "A Federal Army will secure Central American interests once more."

 cendem.16.t: "Provisional Cabinet Formation"
 cendem.16.d: "The last decision by the Council will be to designate a provisional president until the first election can be made. All the parties have put forth their representatives to fill the role until popular will can decide who will lead the country. While a the provisional president is chosen by the convention, the elections have already been officially scheduled to happen soon, giving the provisional representatives enough time to ensure the availability of voting booths and ballots throughout the country."
 cendem.16.a: "It is a temporary solution that pleases everyone."

 cendem.18.t: "Formation of the Partido Nacional Revolucionario"
 cendem.18.d: "Born from the ashes of what remained of several socialist movements in Central America, the Partido Nacional Revolucionario has formed today in Quetzaltenango. Lead by the Guatemalan Silverio Ortiz, the party is a rather moderate variant of socialism compared to old school socialists like Sandino or Martí, who have been banned explicitly by the other parties from the elections. The party has been forced to take an oath to the other parties as to not associate with the radicals who once plunged Central America into chaos in order to allow their participation in politics. Their platform of land reform, welfare for the working class and better rights for natives has attracted unexpected support and despite the defeat of socialism in Central America, they PNR might still become a relevant force in the Confederation."
 cendem.18.a: "Only time will tell if they'll be a strong as they once were."

 cendem.19.t: "The [GetYear] Central American Snap Election"
 cendem.19.d: "As the ballots are prepared in every city and town within our nation, our citizens wonder who shall be the party that shall lead the nation for the next four years. As the day nears its end, the ballots are counted and the result is..."
 cendem.19.a: "The PT led PT/PNR coalition gets the popular vote!"
 cendem.19.b: "The PL led PL/PUD coalition comes out victorious!"
 cendem.19.c: "The PUD led PUD/PL coalition takes the win!"
 cendem.19.e: "The PU led PU/PL coalition wins by a landslide!"
 cendem.19.f: "The PNR led PNR/PT coalition makes a comeback!"

 cendem.20.t: "The [GetYear] Central American Election"

 cendem.30.t: "Internal Elections of the Partido del Trabajo"
 cendem.30.d: "After many years of near hegemony in the ruling party, both Moreno and Morales have been relegated to secondary party work as the popularity of the two Guatemalans Arevalo and Arbenz skyrockets within the party. Both offering a unique take on the party's policies, they don't seem to agree on a common ground for the future. It is because of this that an election has been called to decide who shall lead the Partido del Trabajo for the years to come."
 cendem.30.a: "Jacobo Arbenz."
 cendem.30.b: "Juan Jose Arévalo."

 cendem.31.t: "Internal Elections of the Partido Liberal"
 cendem.31.d: "During the recent years, as liberalism has spread in the Central American nation, Sacasa's nearly unchallenged hegemony within the Partido Liberal is nearing its end. The recent polls had been indicating an ascendance in popularity of the Salvadoran Alfonso Quiñonez Molina, a controverted figure in Central America since he had been responsible for setting up a political dynasty in El Salvador, filled with corruption and abuses. However, he has been cleaning up his name for years, and his promises are slowly swaying the liberals away from Sacasa. Calls for an internal election within the party have been plenty in the recent time, and Sacasa has complied with the demands. Now the internal election shall decide who will lead the Liberals for the near future."
 cendem.31.a: "Sacasa retains his position as leader."
 cendem.31.b: "Molina takes a surprise victory!"

 cendem.32.t: "Internal Elections of the Partido del Trabajo"
 cendem.32.d: "Excusing himself about his old age and overall exhaustion of politics, Arturo Araujo has decided to step down as the leader of the Partido del Trabajo in order to retire permanently from public life. As one of the last original Vitalistas leaves the public life, the party has called for an internal election in order to decide who shall be the new party leader from now on. While Francisco Sequeira Moreno is still a relevant figure within the party, the young Honduran medic Ramon Villeda Morales has become more and more relevant within the party to the point of being a prime candidate for the election. As the party counts the ballots of the internal election, the results are..."
 cendem.32.a: "Ramon Villeda Morales takes a surprise victory and succeeds Araujo in the party."
 cendem.32.b: "Francisco Sequeira Moreno is rewarded for his patience and succeeds Araujo in the party."

 cendem.33.t: "The Death of Sacassa and the Aftermath in the Partido Liberal"
 cendem.33.d: "Tragedy has struck the liberal party as Juan Bautista Sacasa has passed away in Managua. With his death, the Liberal party is thrown into chaos as there wasn't any specific leader that could take over after Sacasa's death. The party has called for a new internal election that shall chose the new face of the Liberal party for the years to come and who shall honour the legacy of Sacasa and the many liberal thinkers before him."
 cendem.33.a: "Abelardo Cuadra takes a surprise victory."
 cendem.33.b: "Molina becomes the new leader of the party."

 cendem.34.t: "Jacobo Arbenz Becomes the Leader of the Partido Nacional Revolucionario"
 cendem.34.d: "After being defeated in the PT's elections, Jacobo Arbenz met José Manuel Fortuny, a young socialist who had been impressed by Arbenz's proposals in the Partido del Trabajo. As both became close friends, 'Che Manuel' offered Arbenz to join the Partido Nacional Revolucionario, where, despite not sharing the overall socialist ideals most members of the PNR have, he has gained an immense amount of popularity and respect due to his compromising nature and concern for the welfare of the citizens throughout Central America. With the PNR's elections taking place, Jacobo Arbenz has won the popular vote by a large majority, and will become the new leader of the party for the next elections."
 cendem.34.a: "Was the PNR moved further right? or Arbenz further left?"

 cendem.37.t: "Partido del Trabajo Protests!"
 cendem.37.d: "After the restoration of the military as a symbol of pride for Central America, the Partido del Trabajo has protested publicly, calling for people to rally against this display of what they call a 'Stepping stone towards a new autocracy'. While their insults hardly hurt our position, many people who feel afraid that the military might take the same anti-democratic decisions that they had taken in the recent years have been drawn into the Partido del Trabajo in order to fight off this influence."
 cendem.37.a: "Our Army needs to improve its Image."

 cendem.39.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Seeks to Establish Closer Relations"
 cendem.39.d: "As the first step in drawing our countries closer, [FROM.GetLeader] has suggested that we reduce our number of military personal as they are more fitting for taking the job of security.\nThis would hardly change our current situation as our army is already very small in comparison to them.\n\nBut something they demanded was a ban on all news that print anti-unification propaganda as they don't desire that these ideas later brew into rebellions and protest."
 cendem.39.a: "Agree to their proposal and start working on unification measures."
 cendem.39.b: "This is unacceptable."

 cendem.40.t: "Furthering Ties"
 cendem.40.d_level_2: "Another meeting was held today about further ties, in which the Central American government offered to invest in our industrial sector to reduce the amount of control foreign owned companies have in our country.\nBut our experts see that this would only be transferring that control over to them as no promises have been made regarding the control of the land and factories outside of a good share of the profits coming back to us.\nThere isn't much pushback knowing the full end goal of the negotiation, but the few that still resist, see this as our last chance to maintain our sovereignty."
 cendem.40.d_level_3: "On today's meeting, we were surprised by Central America \"offering\" to take care of most of our external diplomatic matters so we can fully prepare for future integration into the wider union.\nWith this being our last true chance to decline, many government workers are threatening to resign if we accept this deal."
 cendem.40.a: "Little by little, the union will be complete once again."

 cendem.41.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Refuses to Join!"
 cendem.41.d: "The Costa Rican government have turned down our offer and refused to join our nation. While many hot-headed politicians in the Unionist party are calling for war in order to solve this situation, the other parties find this solution completely abhorrent and ask for Costa Rica to be left alone. However, this may be the last chance we get to unify all the old members of the Federal Republic of Central America, and we ought to weigh our options carefully."
 cendem.41.a: "Kindly accept their decision and try to keep friendly relations."
 cendem.41.b: "Recall the delegation. We will solve this by force!"

 cendem.42.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Accepts Our Request"
 cendem.42.d: "Our Central American brothers have accepted the terms of our agreement, and now we can move to complete their integration into our nation."

 cendem.43.a: "$cendem.39.a$"
 cendem.43.b: "This is unacceptable."

 cendem.44.a: "Excellent!"

 cendem.45.d: "The Panamanian government have turned down our offer and refused to join our nation. While many hot-headed politicians in the Unionist party are calling for war in order to solve this situation, the other parties find this solution completely abhorrent and ask for Panama to be left alone. However, this may be the last chance we get to unify all of Central America at long last, and we ought to weigh our options carefully."

 cendem.100.t: "Foundation of the Universidad Zamorano"
 cendem.100.d: "Today, the Universidad Zamorano, has been founded in Honduras with the help of American Businessman Samuel Zemurray, one of the most influential UFC share-holders. The magnate, needing more capable manpower for his company, has generously founded the university for us to use as long as we recognise the institution and private. In order to solidify his staff, he has placed the renowned American botanist Wilson Popenoe, now widower of archaeologist Dorothy Popenoe, who will supervise all developments in the University and help students integrate faster to the UFC's working standards."
 cendem.100.a: "One more step towards improving our nation."

 cendem.101.t: "Foundation of the Universidad Centroamericana"
 cendem.101.d: "The Compañía de Jesús has decided to make a contribution to our nation by funding the creation of a new university in Nicaragua. The project, lead by the Jesuit priest León Pallais Godoy, has opened its doors today, and our party has already offered to fund several of their careers in order to make education accessible for more Nicaraguans."
 cendem.101.a: "We are grateful."

 cendem.102.t: "Construction of the Ciudad Universitaria 'Dr. Fabio Castillo Figueroa'"
 cendem.102.d: "The University of El Salvador was in need of an expansion, and since the times where the tyrant Martinez ruled their nation, the university has been more than willing to cooperate with the government. We shall woo them to our side by funding the acquisition of the San Carlos Homestead and beginning the expansion of their facilities. Hopefully this will help sustain the support of the PT in El Salvador, as well as improving the quality of our professional workforce in the future."
 cendem.102.a: "San Salvador will become a place of knowledge!"

 cendem.103.t: "Autonomisation of the Universidad Nacional de Honduras"
 cendem.103.d: "The National University of Honduras has been under the control of the Catholic church since its creation in 1847 where it was inaugurated with the sponsorship of Bishop Francisco de Paula Campoy y Pérez. Our cabinet has decided that the best way forward is to enforce our secularisation premises and pass the 'Ley Orgánica de la Universidad Nacional Autónoma de Honduras', which shall put the institution under direct government control, and will assign them a yearly budget to allow more students to join in their search for higher education."
 cendem.103.a: "Honduras has its education freed from oppression at last."

 cendem.104.t: "The Other Parties Protest our intervention!"
 cendem.104.d: "Backlash after the war declaration has been immediate. With the war being declared without being informed to the congress, the other parties have all come together in protest against our actions, and are actively calling out for Centroamerican citizens to burn their draft cards and to rally in the streets to protest our actions. Even our own supporters are slowly drifting away from our party after that rash decision, and we have no choice now but to accept the consequences of our actions."
 cendem.104.a: "Damnit! It wasn't supposed to be like this!"

 cendem.105.t: "Universidad Nacional de Guatemala Becomes Autonomous"
 cendem.105.d: "The Guatemalan tyrants like Orellana and Ubico have reduced the old Universidad Nacional de Guatemala to a mere state puppet of foreign companies throughout the years, kicking students that didn't agree with their regimes and slowing down several others in order to force them to comply. In order to prevent this from happening in the future, we shall decree total autonomy for the University. From now on, the University will be officially known as the Universidad de San Carlos de Guatemala and will have their own election system, and a yearly budget that we shall adjust based on their needs and projects."
 cendem.105.a: "Another trace of tyranny erased from our nation."

 cendem.106.t: "The Book "El Señor Presidente" Is Published"
 cendem.106.d: "The Guatemalan writer Miguel Ángel Asturias has finally published what many consider to be his masterpiece. The author claims to have finished the book in 1933, having to hide his work for years from authoritarian regimes that would've censored it. His book, taking several characteristics of the Magic realism genre, explores the nature of dictatorships and its effects on the society at large. Many are drawing parallels with the book and Asturias' observations of the Cabrebra government in Guatemala, and is quickly becoming a hit both in our country and in the rest of Latin America, with even other renowned writers calling it a 'point of reference' for Latin American literature overall."
 cendem.106.a: "A masterful work of literature!"

 cendem.107.t: "Expenditure of a New Passport for Our Citizens"
 cendem.107.d: "As the structure of the Central American nation becomes stronger with each passing day, we have decided to get rid of the old passports of the old individual members of the federation, and we will introduce a Central American Passport, so all who travel around the world be known as Central American, rather than part of an artificial construct like the previous nations were."
 cendem.107.a: "Another step to unite our nation."

 cendem.108.t: "The Central American Bank Is Founded!"
 cendem.108.d: "After having extensive talks with the several state banking institutions within the different nations, an agreement has been reached by all sides to create the Central American Bank, effectively dissolving all previous state banking institutions and putting their assets, both public and private, under the jurisdiction of the new entity. This move will certainly help reduce bureaucracy and facilitate the funding of projects throughout the nation, as we now only need to contact one bank instead of having to gather funds from several others for a single project. This unification has also left us with a great deal of extra capital available which will come in handy in the future reforms."
 cendem.108.a: "Uniting our efforts, we can truly achieve greatness."

 cendem.109.t: "Our Farmers Are Suffering From Our Autarky Efforts"
 cendem.109.d: "As we allow foreign companies to enter our country, the rural areas of the country are seeing a massive exodus towards the cities, where many new industries are being placed in dire need of workers. The farms and plantations can't compete with the wages the industrial sector is offering, and this is causing a severe manpower shortage in the agricultural sector, reducing production levels and hurting the rural peasantry."
 cendem.109.a: "It's the price of progress."

 cendem.110.t: "Expeditions That Scouted for Resources End in Failure"
 cendem.110.d: "In order to achieve total autarky, we have sent several expeditions to scout for resources throughout our country. However, our expeditions have reported back and there are hardly any new resources to be found, none that can be exploited on an industrial level. We have to unfortunately accept foreign resources as we can't sustain ourselves with our local ones."
 cendem.110.a: "We will have to focus on industry then..."

 cendem.111.t: "Industry Report of Our Last Reforms"
 cendem.111.d: "As our industrial investment have started to report profits, the reports are underwhelming compared to our projections when we started project. It seems that, despite how much we invest in industry and infrastructure, we cannot fully achieve autarky since it's both hurting our rural peasantry and the industry is dependant on the imports of foreign raw materials in order to work. However, the industrial investment has yielded a significant amount of wealth for our cities' population, and while autarky is now proving more and more to be impossible, we are still being benefited by our investments."
 cendem.111.a: "Well, we'll have to balance our system from now on."

 cendem.112.t: "Equal Laws for an Equal People"
 cendem.112.d: "As we push for new legislation throughout our nation, we are noticing more and more regional laws that undermine the livelihood of the black and native populations in our nation. As we enter a new age for our subcontinent, we are endeavouring our efforts towards cleaning up the remains of these despotic legislations and truly embracing the ideals of civic nationalism, allowing these minorities to truly take part in our nation's decision making and every day affairs. In order to do so, President [Root.GetLeader] has decreed that all old prejudices from old legislations be abolished, and a new set of Federal laws be complied in the individual regions. Considering the Decentralised approach of the PNR, this has come to surprise the PT, but it's a move that is both supported by the PL and PUD, allowing the legislation to be passed without further issues."
 cendem.112.a: "Diversity is not a weakness, it's a strength!"

 cendem.113.t: "New Set of Laws are Passed to Sideline the Military"
 cendem.113.d: "With the decades of authoritarianism that Central America has endured, President [Root.GetLeader] has decided to enact a series of law reforms to restrain and contain military power to strictly national defence, and has proposed several safeguards to be added to the constitution in order to prevent a military takeover to happen ever again."
 cendem.113.a: "We seek to avoid the errors of the past."

 cendem.114.t: "Corruption Trials Start"
 cendem.114.d: "After a great deal of debate with the PL, the corruption trials have finally been authorised by the congress. An in depth national investigation has started and several names of several important companies, including the United Fruit Company have come out. These individuals will be processed for their crimes and enacted an embargo of their ill-acquired goods and apply a jail sentence in the most extreme cases. Hopefully, this process will finish soon enough, and without major repercussions"
 cendem.114.a: "Money can't save you from the swift hammer of Justice!"

 cendem.115.t: "Nationalisation Laws Create Controversy"
 cendem.115.d: "After our nationalisation laws managed to be passed with a very slim majority, several representatives of the Partido Unionista and the Partido Liberal have come together to express their discontent at this turn of events, even accusing us of trying to collectivise the economy. While these insults are nothing but buzzwords, we are aware that there's public unrest regarding this law, and we should try to restrict its use to only key economic sectors."
 cendem.115.a: "We need to thread carefully."

 cendem.116.t: "Corruption Trials End"
 cendem.116.d: "After several hundred employees and concerned citizens have testified, and solid evidence has been presented, around 500 individuals, among high ranking politicians and industrial and rural barons, have been identified of embezzlement and illicit enrichment, and have been sentenced to a 4 million dollar embargo and varying prison times depending on the severity of their crimes. While there probably is still plenty of local corruption, the overall goal for the party has been achieved. While the search for corruption will continue, it'll be at a slower pace, and delegated to the individual states."
 cendem.116.a: "The future has become a bit brighter."

 cendem.117.t: "Goals of Our Land Reform"
 cendem.117.d: "Our initial draft of new land reform laws had great success in appealing to the people, and although we received some minor criticism from the other parties, the majority of the representatives were in favour of it. This has emboldened some of the most radical members of our party to propose adjustments to our land reform, taking it closer to what their socialist allies had planned to implement once they took power."
 cendem.117.a: "Let's continue with our initial goals."
 cendem.117.b: "Expand our aims and listen to our radical members."

 cendem.201.t: "[FROM.FROM.GetNonIdeologyNameDef] Wants to Sign a Friendship Treaty"
 cendem.201.d: "[FROM.FROM.GetNameDefCap] has contacted our embassy today to have us review a friendship treaty their chamber of deputies has approved. The proposal itself details a diplomatic reassurance were both countries promise to stand up for each other in case of an invasion, and reduces tariffs to trade between our country and theirs, and even stating that they're willing to create a free trade area further down the line if the treaty is accepted. What should we do?"
 cendem.201.a: "Accept their proposal."

 cendem.203.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government has refused our diplomatic proposal, and while they have stated that they are willing to continue diplomatic relations with our country, their refusal of our proposal have definitely set back our relationship for the foreseeable future."
 cendem.203.a: "How unfortunate."

 cendem.220.t: "The Status of Belize"
 cendem.220.d: "Occupied during the British Revolution of 1925, British Honduras, or as it is now known as Belize, has been part of Guatemala ever since. Now that Guatemala is part of the larger Central American Confederation, Belize remains a part of our nation. However, the British, better said the West Indies Federation, still claim Belize as a rightful part of their nation, which renders the full integration of Belize impossible.\n\nReturning the land would greatly improve our relations with them, but this would severely hurt our international prestige.\nAlthough, we could offer them a deal, keeping the region in exchange for joining their alliance in the future. While more powerful than us, the Entente can hardly stand up to the Reichspakt or the Third Internationale, so even a minor member like us could be a of great assistance for their cause."
 cendem.220.a: "Return Belize."
 cendem.220.b: "Offer a deal to the Federation."

 cendem.221.t: "Central America Demands That We Revoke Our Belizean Claim"
 cendem.221.d: "The Central American government has sent us a deal concerning the former colony of Belize. They demand that we renounce our claim on Belize and recognise its ownership by Central America, and in exchange our two nations will sign favourable trade deals to revive business ties, with them also joining our alliance."
 cendem.221.a: "Accept the deal."
 cendem.221.b: "Crazy and unacceptable terms!"

 cendem.222.t: "The Federation Rejects Our Offer!"
 cendem.222.d: "The West Indies Federation has ignored our deal and will not give up their claim no matter what. This will definitely destroy all future chances to improve our relations with the Entente."
 cendem.222.a: "If this is what they chose."

 cendem.223.t: "The Federation Has Revoked Their Claim!"
 cendem.223.d: "The West Indies Federation has finally accepted to revoke their claims on Belize, which will open the path for its full integration, but we will have to do our part of the deal and join the Entente sooner or later."
 cendem.223.a: "Great!"

 cendem.225.t: "Protests Against the Socialists"
 cendem.225.d: "After the all votes were counted, the Socialist PNR has been found victorious in the election. This has immediately sparked protests from the Unionista party, claiming the elections were rigged, and that the socialists were going to lead the republic towards disaster. While their protests do hurt us publicly, we still hold a tenuous control over the deputy chamber with the help of the PT, but we will have to thread carefully in order to avoid getting the Unionista and the Liberal parties united against us, as this would lead to our laws to be blocked both in the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies."
 cendem.225.a: "We won the popular vote fair and square, and they should respect it."

The West Indies and by extension their master, Canada, still claim the region. This has soured all relation between us and will obviously cause complication for our entry in their faction. As a result, many ask if we should handover the region in exchange for Entente membership."

 CENdem_diversify_trade_partners_desc: "One of the major mistakes that the previous Central American nations made was to trust their economies to a single trade partner, that being the United States.

 CENdem_instate_long_conscription_times_desc: "Our soldiers are precious, and their experience is now more important than ever before. We can't allow that expertise to be wasted on the civilian front if it's not needed, and so we shall increase conscription times. This way we can keep more of our experienced soldiers for a longer amount of time before they are finally replaced by fresh reserves."
 CENdem_the_central_american_task_force: "The Central American Task Force"
 CENdem_the_central_american_task_force_desc: "The Constitutional Convention has decided that the way forward for the Central American Army is a mixed forces with local militias and an elite federal army and our officers will start making the necessary reforms."

 CENdem_autonomy_don_the_command_chain_desc: "In order to be able to successfully reform our army into a mixed entity with both a federal and local structure, we cannot use any sort of fixed standards for our officers, so we shall proceed in the opposite direction. We shall grant them some much needed autonomy to carry on their duties with their troops however they see fit, making them responsible for the state of their soldiers and their fighting capabilities."
 CENdem_support_teams_integration: "Support Teams Integration"
 CENdem_support_teams_integration_desc: "An elite force isn't just a bunch of veteran soldiers carrying out orders. There have to be engineers assisting their advance on harsh terrains and scouts helping them avoid enemy strongholds and attack enemy weak points. It is the need for such support companies that we shall invest in the integration of said teams to our elite forces."
 CENdem_incorporate_shelling_into_doctrine: "Incorporate Shelling into the Doctrine"
 CENdem_incorporate_shelling_into_doctrine_desc: "With our system, we cannot depend on a number advantage to beat the enemy. Luckily, one of the greatest inventions in the 20th century for warfare has been artillery, which allows us to pound enemy positions from relative safety as long as we can outrange the enemy's artillery. In order to always have the upper hand against their artillery, we shall begin investing in better artillery models."
 CENdem_the_best_of_the_best: "The Best of the Best"
 CENdem_the_best_of_the_best_desc: "The Central American Federal Task Force, or Fuerzas Especiales de CentroAmérica (FECA) shall be moulded to the image of the American Marine Corps or the German Sturmtruppen and will be made of the best soldiers our country can offer."
 CENdem_acquire_tank_designs: "Acquire Tank Designs"
 CENdem_acquire_tank_designs_desc: "No modern army can underestimate the importance of armoured vehicles in combat, proven by the breakthroughs said machines managed to do achieve during the Weltkrieg. We shall start our own armoured vehicle programme, and invite foreign experts to supervise our new designs so that they may be both cheap and effective."
 CENdem_begin_motorisation: "Begin Motorisation"
 CENdem_begin_motorisation_desc: "With the improvement in speed in cars during the last few decades, the military relevance of motorised and mechanised cannot be underestimated. We shall start investing in motorised transport models for our troops, which will hopefully help our army become not only the strongest but also the fastest one in the continent."
 CENdem_swiftness_is_key: "Swiftness is Key"
 CENdem_swiftness_is_key_desc: "Armies that can't secure a victory quickly inevitably get drawn into prolonged attrition wars which are both costly and ineffective. We cannot afford ourselves to be drawn into such a conflict with our new armed forces, and it is for this reason that we should focus on achieving a swift victory over our enemies rather than pushing ourselves into an attrition war."
 CENdem_combined_arms_training: "Combined Arms Training"
 CENdem_combined_arms_training_desc: "The theory of combined arms combat is growing more relevant as the use of radio allows for greater coordination between the army, the armoured corps and the air force to combat the enemy more effectively. We shall focus in developing our tactics to incorporate these new doctrines to our fighting style."
 CENdem_keep_the_republican_armies_separated: "Keep the Republican Armies Separated"

 CENdem_divided_but_equal: "Divided but Equal"

 CENdem_watchers_of_the_army: "Watchers of the Army"
 CENdem_watchers_of_the_army_desc: "The Federal Government will keep a small token force that will ensure that no local army may disturb the peace of our nation for egoist provincial gains. This peacekeeping force will handle mostly inter-army relations and will work more like a military police than an actual secret police."
 CENdem_voluntery_but_encourage_conscription: "Voluntary but Encouraged Conscription"
 CENdem_voluntery_but_encourage_conscription_desc: "Volunteers for the army before were few and far between, mainly because the armies had a bad reputation of harbouring tyrants in waiting and having poor living conditions for the average soldier. We shall do away with such ideas and begin promoting army service like an honourable activity, as well as increasing the army wages significantly to attract less idealistic recruits..."
 CENdem_inter_republican_war_plan_simulations: "Inter-Republican War Plan Simulations"
 CENdem_inter_republican_war_plan_simulations_desc: "Only through practice we can manage to keep the edge of the several internal armies in case of a foreign invasion. In order to practise their respective skills, we shall set up a series of war games for our armies to practise manoeuvres and fire practices in a contained environment so that they may be ready in case of conflict."
 CENdem_army_infrastucture_projects: "Army Infrastructure Projects"
 CENdem_army_infrastucture_projects_desc: "The army may be property of the provinces, but logistics is on the Central Government's responsibilities.

 CENdem_discourage_nepotism: "Discourage Nepotism"
 CENdem_discourage_nepotism_desc: "Nepotism has been practically endemic in most of Central America, and while we do understand that 'better the devil you know than the devil you don't' has its usages in the military sphere, we can't afford the creation of military dynasties in our army that are not based on merit. We shall enact strict meritocratic measures to restrict generals from promoting family members unless they offer the qualifications needed for their posts."
 CENdem_military_parades: "Military Parades"
 CENdem_military_parades_desc: "A way of instilling pride for our armed forces is the celebration of yearly military parades nationwide, to give a chance to each local army to show off both at home and in the rest of the country the achievements they have accomplished in terms of discipline in such a short time. We shall decree the celebration of a military parade, effective immediately and that shall be made an annual celebration."
 CENdem_ingrain_democracy_in_the_army: "Ingrain Democracy in the Army"
 CENdem_ingrain_democracy_in_the_army_desc: "Democracy must be taught to every soldier and officer, democracy must be shown to be the system that keeps our nation together, and it will be for Democracy that our soldiers shall be willing to fight and die in the frontlines!"
 CENdem_a_most_loyal_army_to_the_confederation: "A Most Loyal Army to the Confederation"
 CENdem_a_most_loyal_army_to_the_confederation_desc: "Our armies, beyond their individual loyalties to their respective nation, also have a responsibility to a national scale to protect their brothers and sisters from the other members of the Confederacy as well as they would defend their own people. It is this feeling of camaraderie that gives our federal government the loyalty of its troops above the individual provinces, as each soldier knows that there's more at stake that just their provinces."

## Air Tree
 CENdem_airplane_trials: "Airplane Trials"
 CENdem_airplane_trials_desc: "The Central American Federation has begun its plans to build a new Air Force to defend ourselves. In order to begin this difficult task, early trials of new airplanes have begun to test the ability of our country to develop and fly these powerful engines."
 CENdem_airfield_constructions: "Airfield Constructions"
 CENdem_airfield_constructions_desc: "In order for our planes to fly, they must be able to land and take off safely. For this reason, the Central American Federation has begun the construction of new airfields for the use of our new Air Force. This will allow us to use more planes at once and successfully defend our airspace against attackers."
 CENdem_flak_gun_advancements: "Flak Gun Advancements"
 CENdem_flak_gun_advancements_desc: "Our ships need new weapons in order to keep them competitive. We must advance our flak gun technology and mount it on our ships in order to improve their fighting power and effectiveness in battle. These guns will help our fleet immensely."
 CENdem_ace_pilot_initiative: "Ace Pilot Initiative"
 CENdem_ace_pilot_initiative_desc: "The morale and efficiency of our Air Force will grow exponentially if our pilots have heroes to look up to and emulate. We must find pilots willing to do everything for their country, pilots who exceed what everyone thinks is possible. Hopefully, this will help us find new ace pilots in order to be the faces of our new Air Force."
 CENdem_fighters_arms_race: "Fighters Arms Race"
 CENdem_fighters_arms_race_desc: "We must not sit by idly as other countries develop better and more advances fighters that will easily outperform ours. We must stay competitive and work hard to develop and field newer and better fighter models. Our best minds must be put to work to make this happen."
 CENdem_dogfight_training: "Dogfight Training"
 CENdem_dogfight_training_desc: "Our pilots need to be trained in what could be called the art of dogfighting. They must be trained intensively in all kinds of situations in order to be able to always outmanoeuvre the enemy. If we learn them to become true heroes of dogfighting, our Air Force will become formidable through the sheer quality of our pilots alone."
 CENdem_long_range_detection: "Long Range Detection"
 CENdem_long_range_detection_desc: "RADARs are starting to become more and more common with new developments like the Decimetric radar allowing for a more accurate tracking of aerial objects in a determined airspace. It is clear to us that such a technology will become vital to secure our airspace from anyone who may dare cross into Central American skies, and it is because of this that we shall start investing in these innovative technology."
 CENdem_multirole_bombers: "Multirole Bombers"
 CENdem_multirole_bombers_desc: "Our quickly modernising Air Force has found the need for a new type of plane. We need bombers fit not for just one specific task, but with more flexible application in order to serve our diverse needs. For this reason, we must focus on developing multirole bombers, which will surely help us in the case of a war."
 CENdem_fighter_bombers: "Fighter-Bombers"
 CENdem_fighter_bombers_desc: "Our current bomber fleet cannot properly protect itself, and our fighter fleet cannot properly damage the enemy. We must introduce a new type of plane to our Air Force, the fighter-bomber. These planes will have both fighting and bombing capability and will allow us to win the skies and rain down fire on those who wish to threaten our democracy."
 CENdem_sea_bombers_trials: "Sea-Bomber Trials"
 CENdem_sea_bombers_trials_desc: "Our current Air Force lacks the power to damage enemy ships. We need to develop specialised sea-bombers that will be able to bomb enemy ships much more effectively. This specialisation will allow us to prevent enemy ships from arriving on our shores, possibly threatening our democracy."

## Naval Tree
 CENdem_propose_naval_ventures: "Propose Naval Ventures"
 CENdem_propose_naval_ventures_desc: "Our current navy is weak. Therefore, we must take a look at the possibility of focusing our military efforts on expanding it. If we don't, we will be the plaything of the other great powers. With a fleet, we can successfully defend our shores from those who would seek to topple our liberal democracy."
 CENdem_the_merchant_fleet: "The Merchant Fleet"
 CENdem_the_merchant_fleet_desc: "Our country lacks a formal merchant navy to speak off, and if we even want to consider starting a formal military navy, then maybe we should worry about acquiring a civilian navy first. We shall buy a few transport ships in the world market and then invest in some small dockyards to maintain these small merchant fleet."
 CENdem_next_generation_of_naval_officers: "Next Generation of Naval Officers"
 CENdem_next_generation_of_naval_officers_desc: "Our expanding navy requires officers that can properly handle the crews and efficiently control our ships. Without a proper officer corps, our ships will be little more than big pieces of floating metal. We must train a new generation of officers in order to properly staff our new ships and maintain the efficiency of our navy."
 CENdem_new_drydocks: "New Drydocks"
 CENdem_new_drydocks_desc: "In order to execute our naval expansion plans, we need new drydocks to aid us in the construction of new ships. These drydocks are expensive and we must focus our efforts in order to create a proper location for shipbuilding industries."
 CENdem_convoy_defence_fleet: "Convoy Defence Fleet"
 CENdem_convoy_defence_fleet_desc: "The most important thing on the seas is the protection of our trade. We need to defend our trade convoys and in order to do that we must seek the ships that will perform that task adequately. We cannot afford to spend too much resources on other things."
 CENdem_sea_lane_patrols: "Sea Lane Patrols"
 CENdem_sea_lane_patrols_desc: "With our newly acquired merchant fleet, we now run the risk of losing these precious cargo vessels to stealthy submarines and rogue destroyers. We cannot allow them to endanger our merchant fleet, and in order to protect said ships, we shall fund the development of a new cruiser model that shall help us protect our sea lanes ones they are built."
 CENdem_military_fleet_expansion: "Military Fleet Expansion"
 CENdem_military_fleet_expansion_desc: "To further our naval ambitions, we must focus on expanding our military fleet. It is wholly inadequate for our current strategic needs, which means that we must expand it. We must build new military ships to protect our convoys and safeguard our shores."
 CENdem_civilian_fleet_focus: "Civilian Fleet Focus"
 CENdem_civilian_fleet_focus_desc: "We have many goods to trade with the world and in order to expand our trade, we must build a strong and solid fleet. For this reason, we must focus on expanding our naval convoy fleet."
 CENdem_fleet_mainstay: "Fleet Mainstay"
 CENdem_fleet_mainstay_desc: "Our fleet may have destroyers and cruisers, but these ships might take a hit or two and will be forced to retreat to friendly ports. We need ships that can sustain heavier damage and continue the fight if we wish to stand a chance in a naval battle in the future."
 CENdem_flagship_designs: "Flagship Designs"
 CENdem_flagship_designs_desc: "With our reforms nearly finished, we are in dire need of a flagship for our navy. Not only due to its symbolical value, but because a flagship would become the sword and shield of our fleet, serving as a naval command platform to coordinate the rest of the fleet and as a formidable foe to any enemy ships in battle."

### Events
 centro.001.t: "Founding of the Central American Congress"
 centro.001.d: "Socialists from all over the country are coming together to determine the future and foundations of the united socialist Centroamérica! The most prominent are the ones who resisted the hardest against the various military dictators and enemies of socialism, but not all can reach the top as they might wish they can. We'll see in the coming weeks just who manages to make themselves known."
 centro.001.a: "To a new future!"

 centro.002.t: "Partido Nacional Revolucionario"
 centro.002.d: "The Partido Nacional Revolucionario has been founded by Sandino, and is gathering a small group of Guatemalans under his cause, leaving his previous partner Moreno out largely on his own. They desire a unified Central American Identity and wish to spread this identity and the revolution to more of Latin America. Many are calling Sandino a monster for leaving Moreno, who was key in his revolution in Nicaragua in the dirt, but his popularity is still steadily rising."
 centro.002.a: "The splits begin to show."

 centro.003.t: "Partido Maximista"
 centro.003.d: "Juan Wainwright has formed the Partido Maximista. His vision is that of a strong chairman, who leads Centroamérica forwards into a bright future, spreading his vision of socialism across Latin America. With his main and only real base of support located in Honduras, he is seen as an unlikely candidate to actually come out on top in the future of our new nation, but he claims he 'Just may surprise us'."
 centro.003.a: "A very dangerous party indeed..."

 centro.004.t: "Confederación Obrera de Centro América"
 centro.004.d: "The Confederación Obrera de Centro América, led by Agustín Martí, is founded on the ideals of European Syndicalism, created by the Brits and the French. They want to provide a government by and for the people; a safe place for future generations and especially natives, as a large amount of their base of support comes from the indigenous population located within our union. Besides overall native support, Martí enjoys admiration in his home country of El Salvador which sees him as their liberator."
 centro.004.a: "The European model could work after all..."

 centro.005.t: "Partido Popular"
 centro.005.d: "The Partido Popular, led by Silverio Ortiz, wants to take a moderate point. Making sure that people have food in their belly and get the education they need. Seen by some as too moderate, and might encounter resistance from people who believe they don't follow true Socialism. Serving as a Guatemalan based party, they hope to ensure the Maximistas cannot wrestle control even if they don't win, claiming they are a greater threat then the military dictators before them"
 centro.005.a: "A man of the people!"

 centro.006.d: "The Partido Popular, led by Rafael Calderón, aims to save his people from a lack of plenty, wants to implement a better healthcare system. To nay-sayers, accusing him of catering to liberals, he says that his unique form of moderate socialism will keep the country intact, running and alive!"

 centro.007.t: "Moreno, Lost and Found"
 centro.007.d: "With Moreno being left in the dust by Sandino, Moreno has been looking for a new home in the political spectrum. Many predict he is going to be forced into subordination under Sandino, but others think he could stab him in the back for his betrayal and join the Guatemalans in the Partido Popular. Anything is possible, but he decides to side with..."
 centro.007.a: "He sways them to the Partido Nacional Revolucionario!"
 centro.007.b: "He makes the Partido Popular sound quite appealing!"

 centro.008.t: "Calling of the Congress"
 centro.008.d: "Representatives from all over the country have arrived and are getting ready to start the grand debates in a week!"
 centro.008.a: "Let us begin."

 centro.009.t: "Status of Power"
 centro.009.d: "Congress or the Chairman. Some argue that power should never lie with one man, others argue that any nation needs a figurehead, who can lead them during the dark times. After many days of debating, the parties have finally agreed on an answer."
 centro.009.a: "The congress will always remain important."
 centro.009.b: "The chairman is the final factor."

 centro.010.t: "Status of the Army"
 centro.010.d: "An union of nations brings forth a few problems: each had their own army, their own structure. Should they all be incorporated into a singular large force, a professional army, or should they remain separate, a band of militias spread throughout the country and working more autonomous?"
 centro.010.a: "The militias are our own roots!"
 centro.010.b: "Maybe it is time to create a consolidated army!"

 centro.011.t: "Status of Industry"
 centro.011.d: "While the industrial revolution is far behind us, we have yet to entirely switch over. Some call for this to never change, and to focus on becoming the Socialist Breadbasket, ensuring full bellies. Others propose a more radical change for industrialisation, arguing that less people need to work in the fields these days and more can work in the factories, producing luxury goods and arms!"
 centro.011.a: "For a stronger future, industrialisation!"
 centro.011.b: "For a better people, agrarianism!"

 centro.012.t: "Status of the Future Elections"
 centro.012.d: "If the people are working in the factories and the fields, they cannot concern themselves with politics, at least, that is what the Maximistas and Confederación Obrera are reasoning. Others argue that no matter what, the people must vote, because is them who they are representing. Otherwise, what are they but impostors for the revolution!"
 centro.012.a: "The council is the backbone of the union."
 centro.012.b: "The people are the true deciders here!"

 centro.013.t: "The Maximistas Have Won!"
 centro.013.d: "The results are in! The Maximistas have proven themselves as the victors of the elections, and have already begun to implement their controversial reforms. With this, we can expect a centralisation of power resisted by other socialist cliques."
 centro.013.a: "Victory!"

 centro.014.t: "The Confederación Obrera de Centro América Have Won!"
 centro.014.d: "The results are in! The Confederación Obrera de Centro América have found itself on top in the congress, and have already begun to take office under Martí. Loud cheers can be heard from those who want Centroamérica to play a larger role in socialist politics and especially from the native population. What comes next however, is yet to be seen."
 centro.014.a: "For Socialism!"

 centro.015.t: "The Revolutionaries Have Won!"
 centro.015.d: "The results are in! The Partido Nacional Revolucionario has come out on top within our nation, as many seemed to expect. Sandino has always been a popular choice among the people due to his initial success in Nicaragua, and many expect it to be not so different now. What lies next in his political career is yet to been, but many look on in anticipation."
 centro.015.a: "For the Revolution!"

 centro.016.t: "The Moderados Have Won!"
 centro.016.d: "The results are in! Seen as socialist as you can get without entering the liberal camp, the Moderados wish to see the people be the main decider within our new union over petty politicians, along with ensuring their safety and everyday needs be met. Other politicians look on in contempt at what they see as filthy moderates, but today the people are the ones who rejoice."
 centro.016.a: "For the people!"

 centro.017.t: "Deadlock!"
 centro.017.d: "After weeks of debating the congress hasn't been able to make a clear winner. Another vote will have to be held, hopefully now with a clearer result. Who wins the new result?"
 centro.017.a: "The Moderados."
 centro.017.b: "The Maximistas."
 centro.017.c: "The Confederación Obrera."
 centro.017.e: "The Revolutionaries."

 centro.018.t: "The Capital Debate"
 centro.018.d: "A new nation requires a, possibly, new capital. We must decide if we want to move our capital to a new location, more fitting to our new government, or if we will stay put. In the end, the new congress decides and their choice left the doors just now!"
 centro.018.a: "San Salvador will do nicely."
 centro.018.b: "Tegucigalpa will do nicely."
 centro.018.c: "Guatemala will do nicely."
 centro.018.e: "Managua will do nicely."
 centro.018.f: "San Jose will do nicely."

 centro.019.t: "Our Funding?"
 centro.019.d: "We cannot rebuilt a country on just promises.\n\nFrom somewhere we must get the funding for our extensive projects. We can open our own coffers, but we have more bills to pay, so if we want to avoid spending even more money, we could appropriate some factories from their owners to give us some more assets to use, however, it won't make people that happy."
 centro.019.a: "We will have to open the coffers."
 centro.019.b: "We can just borrow some factories."

 centro.020.t: "Budget Readjustments"

 centro.021.b: "Let's focus in construction."
 centro.021.c: "Let's focus in mass production."

 centro.022.t: "Approaching Yucatan"
 centro.022.d: "Seeing as Yucatan had a socialist government similar to ours, we decided to prepare a meeting. There, something was made very clear, their desire to join into our nation and help to expand socialism in the rest of central america.\nNaturally, we accepted such opportunity and have already begun to prepare multiple projects to increase their integration to the wider union."
 centro.022.a: "Is a great day for socialism."
 centro.022.b: "We should ask their overlord first."
 centro.022.c: "We should ask their overlord first and offer a small compensation."

 centro.023.t: "Centroamerica Asks for a Union with Yucatan"
 centro.023.d: "A representative from the Centroamerican government has arrive today, asking for permission to unite with our Yucatan puppet.\nThey argue that an agreement has already been reach between the two and that denying this would be a violation of the desires of the people living there, but we still have the last word in this matter and we can do as we please."
 centro.023.a: "Let's give it to them, not much to lose anyway."
 centro.023.b: "They should have fought for it themselves."

 centro.024.t: "Our Request Has Been Accepted"

 centro.025.a: "There is nothing more we can do."

 centro.026.t: "Central American Troops Are Amassing on the Border"
 centro.026.d: "Recon squads have reported a rather large amount of Central American troops along our border. It is clear to the military that Central America is planning on attacking us in order to force us into the Union. As this information has been published in the newspapers, many patriotic men have signed up to defend the nation, but the independence of Costa Rica lies in grave danger."
 centro.026.a: "We shall defend our homeland, no matter what the cost may be!"

 centro.027.t: "Central American Ships Spotted by David"
 centro.027.d: "The Coast Guard has reported strange Central American naval movements around Panama recently, and the general activity of the FNCA has increased in a scary fashion.

 centro.028.d: "A massive amount of troop movement was noticed on our southern border, with some Centroamerican messengers carrying letters directed at the last socialist remains in our country, instigating them to rise up against our \"authoritarian\" government, with promises to restore the previous democratic revolutionary regime back to power.\nWe thankfully captured them, but is clear that an invasion is imminent."
 centro.028.a: "We shall defend our homeland once again from the socialist!"

 centro.029.t: "Integrating Yucatan"
 centro.029.d.mex: "With our recent victory against our northern neighbour, a restoration of a revolutionary democratic regime followed.\n\nBut, there is still a lot fear and uncertainty as this new democracy could just fall like the last one. That is why, a large group of people in our country and the region of yucatan believe that we should annex the region, to protect the people and natives from further injustices.\n\nAlthough, some think of annexing the regions of Chiapas and Tabasco to have a much shorter and defensible border."
 centro.029.d.yuc: "With our recent victory against our northern neighbour, it was decided to establish a new yucatanese sister republic and to restore a revolutionary democracy in Mexico.\n\nBut, there is still a lot fear and uncertainty as this new democracy could just fall like the last one. That is why, a large group of people in our country and the region of yucatan believe that we should annex the region, to protect the people and natives from further injustices.\n\nAlthough, some think of annexing the regions of Chiapas and Tabasco to have a much shorter and defensible border."
 centro.029.a: "Maybe more dangerous, but is the best for the people."
 centro.029.b: "We need more security from further Mexican threats."

 centro.030.t: "Furthering Our Naval Capacity"
 centro.030.d: "With our, pretty modest, naval plans finally over. Today, our naval experts surprise us, coming to with a plan to further increase our naval capabilities even more, but with most of the naval budget already spend, they have ask for more resources to be allocated to make this dream of even greater naval armada that will bring complete domination of the seas come true.\n\nThis would hurt our other productive sectors, but they argued that we need to catch up to the other powers of the region and that the plan has been crafted to use its resources as effient as possible."
 centro.030.a: "Dominance of the seas is of utmost importance."
 centro.030.b: "Let's politely turn down their offer."

 centro.031.t: "Continue Diverting Resources to the Navy?"
 centro.031.d: "After a year, the results of the programme have bring great mixed results, but haven't hurt us as much as we thought it would.\n\nBut our experts assure us that continuing this plan will keep our navy completive with other powers and even surpass them."
 centro.031.a: "No cost too great for a top quality navy."
 centro.031.b: "Let's put an end to this drain of resources."

 centro.032.t: "Negotiating Oil Concessions with Mexico"
 centro.032.d: "Our plans for a big navy have found another problem and that is our lack of oil to keep our navy running for more than small coastal defence mission. Thankfully, our northern neighbour has a vast amount of oil deposits in all their country, while they are more plenty in the north and centre of theri country, it is much easier to transport oil from the ones found in Chiapas and Yucatan, so let's proceed to ask them and hope for the best."
 centro.032.a: "Approach them with our best smile."
 centro.032.b: "Offer some economic concessions in return."

 centro.033.t: "Centroamerica Asks for a Small Oil Lease"
 centro.033.d: "We have been approached by our southern neighbours, asking for the lease of a small amount of oil deposits in the south of our nation. They claim this will be use to fuel their navy in the future which seems a rather suspicious reason, but with how backwards their economy is, it is hard to see them using it for anything that could threaten us."
 centro.033.a: "Reject their agreement."
 centro.033.b: "Share just a little of it."
 centro.033.c: "Give them what they ask."
 centro.033.e: "Their generosity should reciprocated, by giving them a little more oil."

 centro.034.t: "Mexico Rejects Our Agreement"
 centro.034.d: "Mexico has turn down our proposed agreement over fears of our 'real' intentions for their oil and general distrust of our government."
 centro.034.a: "So much for socialist solidarity."
 centro.034.b: "Expected response from reactionary scum."

 centro.035.t: "Mexico Accepts Our Agreement"
 centro.035.d: "Mexico has accepted our agreement and has lease some of the oil coming from their south, this has obviously come with a small fee."
 centro.035.a: "We are grateful for their cooperation."
 centro.035.b: "What kind of game are they playing on us?"

 centro.036.t: "Centroamerica Wants to Increase Its Oil Lease"
 centro.036.d: "Centroamerica has call us today to increase the amount of oil they have access to in our country. They are willing to increase to also increase their fees to compensate, so, what should we say?"

 centro.039.d.no: "Mexico rejected our deal and preferred to maintain the current fees."

 centro.100.t: "Cater to the 'Dirty' Moderados?"
 centro.100.d: "There are some in our midst that think we should sympathise more with the other factions, and try and include their ideas into ours. Others call this idea filthy, and call those who hold them 'dirty' moderates. We could try and be more inclusive, giving us a bit of stability, at the cost at angering the current Moderados, or we could just ignore them and try and expel the people that would argue for this!"
 centro.100.a: "They're called dirty for a reason."
 centro.100.b: "We rule for everyone!"

 centro.101.t: "Finally, Prosperity!"
 centro.101.d: "Our new policies have paid off! Our hard work trying to improve the living is paying its dividend, but we are far from done yet. While we can focus on the whole nation, it might be better to focus on a single state. This might anger some of the states left behind, but will result in larger improvements..."
 centro.101.a: "Focus further on Guatemala."
 centro.101.b: "Focus further on Nicaragua."
 centro.101.c: "Focus further on El Salvador."
 centro.101.e: "Focus further on Honduras."

 centro.103.a: "From north to south, we will bring prosperity to all."

 centro.104.t: "Moreno Shows Support for Our Education Reforms"
 centro.104.d: "Today, in the streets of Managua, a large group of people were seen with Moreno at the front. After hearing about the government's new education reforms, he decided to use his popularity to encourage everyone to send their kids to one of the many new schools made.\nHe finished his message saying that he will go to every Nicaraguan village to spread awareness of the news and help the future generation have opportunities we could only dreamt of."
 centro.104.a: "Still a man of the people."

 centro.200.t: "Sandino's Followers"
 centro.200.d: "More and more people flock to Sandino's words, not befitting of a socialist nation...\n\nThey call themselves the Sandiniastas, and have been becoming more vocal in their support of Sandino instead of the government. We must decide whether to stop this in its tracks, or to let him go on and risk this growing out of our control..."
 centro.200.a: "Curb his growth!"
 centro.200.b: "Let him have his fun!"

 centro.201.t: "Resistance to Change"
 centro.201.d: "Process does not come without sacrifices. We must purge all non-Hispanic influences that are currently holding us back. There has been some resistance to our advances.\n\nWe could silence them and push through our way, or we could listen to them, and take it a bit slower..."
 centro.201.a: "They will have to live with it."
 centro.201.b: "Maybe we should listen."

 centro.202.t: "Central American Hispanicisation"
 centro.202.d: "Centroamérica has been making worrying strides towards Hispanicisation, forcing marriages to be broken, expelling immigrants and banning any tradition that is not part of the Hispanic culture.\n\nMany in our nation are watching with weary eyes towards the south, and awaiting a denouncement..."
 centro.202.a: "Denounce it."
 centro.202.b: "Not our issue."

 centro.203.t: "Discontent in Honduras"
 centro.203.d: "Our new and more open stance in our religious position has angered the Maximistas in Honduras. They have started rallies in Tegucigualpa, saying that only men can rule other men and that a god is just another tool to control the population.\nThe people have reacted with apathy towards them, so there is not any apparent immediate threat, but it would be wise to keep them in check."
 centro.203.a: "They are not worth the time."
 centro.203.b: "Let's \"silently\" crack down on them."

 centro.204.t: "Sandino's Cult Grows"
 centro.204.d: "We have been careless, and the Sandiniastas have been gaining more and more followers...\n\nWe can still act, and ban the organisation, but it will cost us greatly, and anger Sandino even more. However, if we don't, Sandino might get ideas and try and pull even more power towards him self, bringing danger to the revolution.\n\nWe must decide quickly!"
 centro.204.a: "He is too powerful now..."
 centro.204.b: "Let us root him out for the last time!"

 centro.300.t: "The Native Question"
 centro.300.d: "There have been people in these lands for a long time. The natives have been looking at the new congress, not sure what to think. A representative came to us a few days ago, looking for a statement on their status.\n\nIf they would still be respected and seen as full citizens? We gave them a swift answer: "
 centro.300.a: "We welcome new and old residents!"
 centro.300.b: "We have no need for you!"

 centro.301.t: "The Central American Identity"
 centro.301.d: "With us welcoming the natives with open arms, relations have warmed up a good amount. A group of natives has taken initiative and formed the Central-American Identity. They are spreading the thought that we are all Central-American, not Guatemalan, Nicaraguan or El Salvadoran!\n\nThis will surely bring greater unity to our nation!"
 centro.301.a: "We stand for all Central-Americans."

 centro.302.t: "Following the European Lead"
 centro.302.d: "In these last months, our government has tried even harder to align our values and institutions to the ones in the Commune of France.\nWorks to quickly industrialise and propaganda efforts to increased the amount of people who join unions have been on rise and our leader, Marti Farabundo, has announce his future plan to distance ourself from his original idea of \"socialism according to Central American conditions\" as the circumstance slowly evolve to allow us to be like more like our western European allies."
 centro.302.a: "Everything to bring a brighter future."

 centro.303.d: "In these last months, our government has tried even harder to align our values and institutions to the ones in the Commune of France.\nWorks to quickly industrialise and propaganda efforts to increased the amount of people who join unions have been on rise and our leader, Marti Farabundo, has announce his future plan to distance ourself from his original idea of \"socialism according to Central American conditions\" as the circumstance slowly evolve to allow us to be like more like our western European allies.\nBut, after the \"Totalists\" came in power in the last election, is uncertain if our current actions will suffice to align with this more radical regime in Paris."
 centro.303.a: "Let's just hope this doesn't darkens our prosperity."

 centro.400.t: "Protest over new Religious laws"
 centro.400.d: "Multiple rallies against the new laws are taking place across the nation.\nThe Partido Popular has use all the protest to claim that more violations against the individual freedoms will continue under our rule.\n\nThis has caused multiple deadlocks in the congress as most of it is against us, saying that they \"stand for the people\".\nAll of this have left no choice, but to have to slightly turn down our laws for now."
 centro.400.a: "We should be more careful in the future..."

 centro.401.t: "Beginning to Consolidate our Rule"
 centro.401.d: "Since enough time has passed for most of the controversy surrounding our religious law to go away, the discussion over our centralisation laws has begun again, but many party members have voiced multiple opinion on how we should go around them.\n\nSome believe that there is no point to even trying because the other parties will rally the people against us and remove us from power, to keep the little regional power they have left after.\n\nA majority believe that we could strike a deal with Farabundo and his party, giving us enough power to be most of the time the majority at the congress, which will give us enough support to apply our laws in the other two administrations.\n\nBut some others still want to go through with the original plans, by first making ourself more friendly to the people and the congressmen to have a bigger chance of our laws passing."
 centro.401.a: "Is better to leave it here."
 centro.401.b: "Let's try to ally with the Confederación Obrera."
 centro.401.c: "We begun our rule with a goal and if it ends completing it, so be it."

 centro.402.t: "Approaching the Confederación Obrera"
 centro.402.d: "The meeting began uneventfully, but we decided to quickly bring the topic at hand, an alliance between both of us to not have as much constrains and rule with a shared vision.\n\nOf course, first we had to create said shared vision. The first point was in religion, while they helped the deadlocks, they explained that it was just to keep the support of the people and that if our alliance actually came to be, they will switch to support our atheistic vision.\n\nThe second one was about the status of the native americans, we don't feel strongly either way about them, so we agree to keep the current stances that the Confederación Obrera have.\n\nFinally, we both had similar visions of a strong central government to rule the nation, so that was a non-issue too.\n\nIn the end, it seems that we share more that we have against each other, so an alliance seems rather possible."
 centro.402.a: "We will not bend our ideals to gain their support."
 centro.402.b: "Perfect, this will serve to partially accomplish our goals."

 centro.403.t: "Gathering Support in Guatemala"
 centro.403.d: "Almost everything is set up to begin our talk in Ciudad de Guatemala, but which will be the topic that we focus on?\n\nSome have propose to attack their seemingly very idealistic policies either putting more emphasis in the toll that this had taken in their local economy or how in little of their goal they have actually achieve.\n\nWhile others talk of temporally adopt their welfare or just lie about doing it to convince the locals and shift more of them under us."
 centro.403.a: "Focus on attacking their idealistic goals."
 centro.403.b: "Focus more in the immediate economic problems"
 centro.403.c: "Welfare will win the people over to our side."
 centro.403.e: "Give a void promise of help."

 centro.404.t: "Gathering Support in El Salvador"
 centro.404.d: "Almost everything is set up to begin our talk in San Salvador, but which will be the topic that we focus on?\n\nSome have propose to attack how Faraundo's own ideas of socialism are perversive and not true to what socialism is or how their industrialisation programs are too extreme and could bring harm to the people.\n\nWhile others talk about rushing our own industrialisation programs to offer them as a better and government endorsed plan."
 centro.404.a: "Focus on attacking Farabundo's way of socialism."
 centro.404.b: "Focus more on how the reckless industrialisation will affect the people."
 centro.404.c: "We are more capable of bring new industry."
 centro.404.e: "Promise to bring more industry but don't do anything yet."

 centro.405.t: "Gathering Support in Nicaragua"
 centro.405.d: "Almost everything is set up to begin our talk in Managua, but which will be the topic that we focus on?\n\nSome have propose to attack the militaristic ambitions of Sandino who even has claim that he will bring all of latin america in a union, or his fervorous takes on religion that he even has tried to spread to his loyal militia.\n\nWhile others talk about offering support to the farmers, the main support base of Sandino, through providing better conditions and infrastructure."
 centro.405.a: "Focus on attacking Sandino's militarism."
 centro.405.b: "Focus more on how unhinged his ideas of religion are."
 centro.405.c: "We will be the champion of the farmers."
 centro.405.e: "Promise to relieve to the farmers but don't do anything yet."

 centro.406.t: "Moderados Make Their Move"
 centro.406.d: "The day started calmly, with Wainwright working at his desk. Soon the doors busted open and armed men rushed into the room.\n\nSoon Wainwright was in cuffs and led out of the building.\n\nThe army officers were successfully convinced to work together with the Moderados to coup the Maximistas and ensure a new government beneficial for the people and not only for itself."
 centro.406.a: "Let's stir Centroamerica back to its correct direction."

 centro.408.t: "Moderados Motion a Coup"
 centro.408.d: "With all our papers clear, we called for a new congress to assemble.\n\nBut when it came time to pass our laws, most of them were turned down swiftly. We were prepare to leave the congress, but then the Moderados called for a final resolution, in which they would assume the position of the chairman and make many of our laws void; surprisingly, the other parties accepted this, it seems that our aggressive and antagonist behaviour towards them left us without any public or political support and without it, we had no other but to accept."
 centro.408.a: "Let's stir Centroamerica back to its correct direction."

 centro.409.t: "A Successful Consolidation of Power"
 centro.409.d: "With all our papers clear, we called for a new congress to assemble.\n\nWith the amount of support we were able to gather, our laws passed without much problems. With so much control under our hands now, we are able to finally deal with the strong grip the local governments had in the other provinces, it will take time, but we will finally create the vision of a strong and organised union that we always envisioned."
 centro.409.a: "A true and strong union emerges today."

 CENmil_politicc_desc: "After the resounding victory of his party in the Military Congress of Central America, [CEN.GetLeader] is prepared to transform the Union into what he thinks it should look like.

 CENmil_combat_corruption: "Combat Corruption"

 CENmil_central_american_highway_2: "The Southern Central American Highway"
 CENmil_central_american_highway_2_desc: "The Central American Highway has become a vital infrastructural axis in the Northern parts of Central America, however the highway stops in Managua which limits its ability to be the main road axis of Central America.

### Events ###
 cenmil.1.t: "The New Union"
 cenmil.1.d: "Ever since the Federal Republic of Central America collapsed in 1843, there has been no successful attempt at reuniting Central America under a single flag.\n\nGuided by the armed forces of the various nations of Central America, our new Union shall not follow the same path as the attempts during the last century. As the Nicaraguan Revolution has finally come to an end and as the borders between our nations disappear, our Union shall remain a bastion of freedom and liberty, under guidance of the strongmen of the military.\n\nWe, as an union of nations, shall stand united against Syndicalism and everything that threatens our way of life."
 cenmil.1.a: "Long live the Republic!"

 cenmil.3.t: "Opening of the Military Congress"
 cenmil.3.d: "With Central America reorganised and unified, it is now time to choose a new regime to lead us into the future! For this purpose, the militaries of the former Central American states have met for a first session today in the President's Palace in Guatemala City. The Military Congress of Central America will be tasked with writing a new constitution for our Union as well as select ministers and a new President."
 cenmil.3.a: "Long Live the Republic!"

 cenmil.4.t: "The Economy of Central America"
 cenmil.4.d_shared: "Ever since the first American businessmen landed in Costa Rica, the United Fruit Company and many other foreign companies and investors have controlled our economies. However, with the revolution in Nicaragua and the political chaos that reigned in the Northern nations, the economy has been severely damage and is strongly weakened. Now that the revolution has been suppressed and that the political situation has stabilised, the Congress needs to decide on an unified economic plan and a head minister in charge of the reforms.\nBoth supporters of laissez-faire capitalism, the PLN has suggested Juan Manuel Gálvez and the PLP has suggested Aldana Sandoval to this position"
 cenmil.4.d.yes.martinez: "$cenmil.4.d_shared$, while the PNPP has suggested the interventionist Joaquín Valdéz."

 cenmil.4.c: "Joaquín Valdéz' Interventionism."

 cenmil.5.t: "A New Foreign Minister"
 cenmil.5.d_shared: "As a newly formed nation, our Republic will need to quickly align itself on the world stage. While we will remain with our old allies in the United States and in the anti-Syndicalists factions, we must quickly take action to establish favourable deals. As the foreign ministry holds large power due to how influential foreign powers are in our nation, the factions are fighting hard to get the position.\nAbraham Williams Calderón is the PLN's candidate,"

 cenmil.6.t: "A New Head for the Interior Ministry"
 cenmil.6.d_shared: "Despite the major internal threats and problems that the young Republic has to face at the moment, we still don't possess an organised, centralised institute that defends our way of life. As we can't rely on the unorganised police forces of the former nations to handle things forever, we need to reform our interior ministry. The ministry will need a head to run the show, and such an influential position is highly wanted.\nCarlos Hartling runs for the PLN,"
 cenmil.6.d.yes.martinez: "$cenmil.6.d_shared$ Francisco Javier Arana is the PLP's candidate, and the PNPP has brought forth Fidel Cristino Garay."

 cenmil.7.d: "Anastasio Somoza García, leader of the Partido Liberal Nacionalista, the moderate faction of the military congress, has taken to the balcony of the President's Palace of Guatemala to hold a speech in front of a large crowd. As many military men have feared, he wishes to use the fact that his faction is the most moderate to convince the population of his cause, even though he doesn't actively practice what he preaches.\n\nDespite the warnings and threats made by the more radical PLP and PNPP, the speech has also been transmitted via radio.\n\n'People of Guatemala, people of El Salvador, people of Honduras, people of Nicaragua, now we are all people of the Central American Republic. Syndicalists have tried to oppress us, but no more! Our nation is now free of the Syndicalist menace, thanks to the efforts of every single Central American patriot. Now that the holy task has been completed, your voice should be heard, and will be heard!'\n\nOn the next meeting, the military congress was so angry at Somoza that multiple congressmen took to the podium and screamed that Somoza should be court-martialled for high treason."
 cenmil.7.a: "Maybe his ideas aren't that wrong..."
 cenmil.7.b: "Somoza needs to be court-martialled indeed!"

 cenmil.8.t: "Reforming the Army"
 cenmil.8.d_shared: "The military has been the driving force behind the unification of Central America, but to spell it in singular is quite wrong. Due to the differences between the former nations of Central America, our army is currently a chaotic mix and depending on what nationality you have, you follow different military doctrines and use different equipment. The army currently has none less than 5 different modifications of the Mauser rifle in use!\n"
 cenmil.8.d.yes.martinez: "$cenmil.8.d_shared$The PLN and the PNPP have both presented plans to regularise and professionalise the armed forces, meanwhile the PLP has suggested a major militarisation policy to expand the army as much as possible to defend the union."

Known for his immense hate for Syndicalists and opponents in general, he is most (in)famous for his actions in the 1932 peasant uprising.\n\n'Dear Congressmen, dear men who have let us to victory against the godless Syndicalist, the crusade against Syndicalism is not over! Our Mexican neighbours suffer from an extensive case of Syndicalism, and our neighbours to the south are being tempted into the hands of the Internationale. As a beacon of liberty and prosperity, the Central American Republic needs a powerful, strong and unifying leader to lead us in the eternal struggle against the godless traitors! Our men will fight in the jungle, in the hills, in the mountains and in the cities, and we will never surrender to those who wish the foundations of society destroyed!'"

 cenmil.10.d_shared: "'Central America has been often seen as backwards by the outside world. Our roads have been described as lethal, our nations as corrupt and violent, and our economies as inefficient and underdeveloped.\nNo longer, the glorious Union and shall prove to the world that Central America is the land of the brave, strong and innovative! No longer will we suffer under the traitorous Syndicalist regimes, no longer will we suffer from corrupt officials, no longer will we suffer under division!\nWe need a strong, powerful regime, with a strong powerful leader, to finally reach the future, so to every congressman, to every citizen of the Union, to everyone I say, I will bring prosperity to our glorious Union! Only the brave and strong will achieve greatness, only those with willpower will go down in history, only those who lead their nation to glory will be remembered forever!\n\nThe Central American Republic shall march towards civilisation! Long live the Union and long live every Central American citizen!'"
 cenmil.10.d.yes.martinez: "Maximiliano Hernandez' speech has left quite an impression on the members of the congress, however not everyone was happy with his terms and conditions.

 cenmil.10.d.no.martinez: "Jorge Ubico, the leader of the Partido Liberal Progresista, has written a highly patriotic speech, hoping to convince the people for his own cause, and has presented it in front of the congress, while also transmitting it to the entire Union via radio.\n\n$cenmil.10.d_shared$"

Speeches, arguments, disputes and bribery have been common place in order to convince (or force) congressmen to join and vote for one of the factions, and the three strongmen who lead them respectively have been doing their best to secure as many votes as possible.

 cenmil.13.t: "Dealing with the Other Military Factions"
 cenmil.13.d: "An One-Party State, as the name implies, has to be dominated and controlled by a single party. It will be an easy task to get rid of the democratic and syndicalist opposition, however the other military factions will not surrender. Now that we have been victorious in the Congress, we will need to get rid of our opponents..."
 cenmil.13.a: "Destroy them."
 cenmil.13.b: "The military sticks together!"

 cenmil.14.t: "Military Rivalries Appear"
 cenmil.14.d: "It seems as that our move to destroy opposition inside the military has left it disorganised and split. Despite careful planning, many brigades have declared their loyalty to their former commanders before the unification has been completed."
 cenmil.14.a: "Dismiss the disloyal brigades."

 cenmil.15.t: "Dedicate More Manpower to the Police?"
 cenmil.15.d: "With the passing of the new, harsher laws, we're now finding ourselves with a dismal lack of police officers to enforce them. While we could draw from our Army's manpower pool to resolve this issue, it may just fan the flames of civilian discontent who may see this as a militarisation of the police."
 cenmil.15.a: "Yes, Dedicate More Manpower"
 cenmil.15.b: "No, We Don't Need to Anger the Public Further"

 cenmil.16.t: "The Civilian Puppet State"
 cenmil.16.d: "The PLN has been victorious in the congress thanks to the major support from the population, however now they expect us to fulfil our promises. Betraying them would risk an open rebellion, however Somoza has never actually planned to hand over any power to the civilian population. In order to avoid a second revolution, a civilian state has to be created, while being controlled by the military. However, in order to achieve legitimacy, how much are we willing to negotiate with the civilian politicians?"
 cenmil.16.a: "Lift the ban on opposition parties but only approve loyal politicians."
 cenmil.16.b: "Permit some civilian opposition but only led be controllable politicians."
 cenmil.16.c: "Solidify our power with bribes and threats!"

 cenmil.17.t: "Presidential Elections"
 cenmil.17.d: "The people do not seem satisfied by the liberties and freedoms we have given to them, as they are demonstrating in favour of new elections. However, unlike the congress election, the people want to vote themselves and decide their own president. Those demands are quite crazy, but we shouldn't risk a second revolution.\n\nAfter countless hours of voting and waiting, the election bureaus have finally closed their doors and the votes have been revealed to the election commission. There has been no reported incidents of bribery or election rigging... at least none that the military would permit to be reported."

 cenmil.36.d: "The Partido Liberal Progresista under the leadership of General Jorge Ubico Castañeda has solidified their position in charge of the Central American Republic.\n\nUbico, now the first president of the Union, has been forced to combat Syndicalist revolutionaries, democratic agitators and traitors in the military, however he has proven his adamancy and his incorruptibility during the times of troubles that now lie behind us. Jorge Ubico, who has often referred to himself as the Napoleon of Central America, has proven to the citizens of Central America that he is ready to 'march towards civilisation', as he had promised during his most famous radio transmission. Crowds have gathered today in Guatemala City for the inauguration of Jorge Ubico, and throughout the Union, the same sentence could be heard..."
 cenmil.36.a: "Long Live Jorge Ubico, Long Live the Republic!"

 cenmil.37.t: "Jorge Ubico Travels the Union"
 cenmil.37.d: "As a true president of the people, Jorge Ubico has announced today that he will be travelling across Central America, visiting every larger and smaller city as well as the beautiful country sides of the Union. He will be crossing the Union by car and plane, in order to be able to meet as many citizens of the Republic and to so that he can see every corner of our beautiful union. He will be leaving today for Quetzaltenango, after which he will continue to the disputed region of Belize. Along his route, which has been published in all major newspapers of the Union, crowds of cheerful and loyal citizens have gathered in order to see and meet the president personally."
 cenmil.37.a: "Onwards!"

 cenmil.38.t: "Jorge Ubico Arrives in Belize"
 cenmil.38.d: "On the second destination of his tour of the Republic, Jorge Ubico has arrived in Belize City.\n\nBelize, a former British colony under control of Guatemala and later the Central American Republic since the collapse of the British Empire, has remain a claim of the West Indies Federation, despite being no longer under British control for almost two decades. Jorge Ubico's visit, which was greeted with a flood of Republican flags, proves that the people of Belize truly feel as a part of the Union, and not part of the rotten federation across the sea.\n\nThe next destination is the Honduran border city of San Pedro Sula, which now is the main Atlantic port of Central America."
 cenmil.38.a: "Ubico truly unites our Republic."

 cenmil.39.t: "Jorge Ubico Crosses the Honduran Country Side"
 cenmil.39.d: "Honduras, the former bastion against the Syndicalist traitors of Nicaragua, has suffered under the status of frontier against an hostile force. The country side is the home to much of the poor population of Honduras, who can just keep themselves over water with the little they have. Jorge Ubico, who is currently travelling from San Pedro Sula towards Matagalpa, Nicaragua, has taken a major detour to visit as much of rural Honduras as possible. No matter where he arrives, the commonly illiterate citizens greet him with the utmost respect and hospitality, waving the Republican flag along his route. Jorge Ubico has promised to aid every man, woman and child of Central America, no matter their social class or rank, and has kept his promise along the way. By listening to the needs and demands of the common man, Ubico has gained much popularity in the country side, which will aid him in his 'march towards civilisation'."
 cenmil.39.a: "How could anyone not support Ubico?"

 cenmil.40.t: "Syndicalist Traitors Attack Ubico!"
 cenmil.40.d: "On route towards Managua, the capital of Nicaragua, a group of Syndicalist traitors and terrorists have attempted to ambush Ubico, and end the life of our great president!\n\nLuckily, the Syndicalists, just like their ideology, were not smart enough to cover up their plans, and have been discovered by brave loyalists! As the group of traitors was preparing to ambush the president's car using multiple French rifles, loyalist police forces have overwhelmed and arrested the terrorists. Jorge Ubico and his companions have not been present during the combat between the loyalists and traitors, and as such have not been hurt.\n\nDespite the risks that Ubico has taken, travelling in an open top car through the homeland of Central American Syndicalism, no threatening attacks have happened so far."
 cenmil.40.a: "Good Riddance."

 cenmil.41.t: "Jorge Ubico Crosses El Salvador by Train"
 cenmil.41.d: "The railway, the symbol of the industrialisation and of westernisation, only passes through limited parts of Central America. One of the largest tracks are located in El Salvador, connecting the ports of Acajutla and Cutuco and passing through San Salvador and San Miguel. Today, a special train has carried Jorge Ubico from San Miguel to the Salvadoran capital. Stopping in Usulutan, Zacatecoluga, San Vincente and other stations along the railway, at each point has he been greeted by cheerful crowds and the Republican flag. Upon his arrival in San Salvador, he announced that he will be providing more funding and incentives for a Trans-Central American railway, which will also be open for civilian transportation."
 cenmil.41.a: "The railway will be a cornerstone of the March Towards Civilisation."

 cenmil.42.t: "Jorge Ubico Is Back in Guatemala City"
 cenmil.42.d: "After more than a month of touring Central America, visiting all corners of the Union and all social classes, Jorge Ubico has arrived in Guatemala City. The tour has proven to be a genius marketing stunt, and Jorge Ubico's popularity has increased drastically throughout all regions of the Union. In front of the presidential palace, a massive crowd has greeted Jorge Ubico, who later made a radio broadcasted speech. During the tour, Ubico has promised many reforms, and the people are convinced that he will go through with all of them."
 cenmil.42.a: "Welcome Back!"

 cenmil.43.t: "Jorge Ubico's Statue is Completed"
 cenmil.43.d: "President Jorge Ubico, the hero of the Guatemalan Civil War, the saviour Central America from the Syndicalist traitors, will now forever watch the President's Palace.\n\nThe construction of his statue, which dominates the plaza in front of the palace, has been started when the Guatemalan flag was still on top of the palace's flag pole, when Central America was still divided due to the Syndicalist traitors.\n\nHowever now, the beautiful flag of the united Republic is guarding the entrance of the palace, all thanks to our hero, Jorge Ubico. The inauguration, on this beautiful day of June, has been declared a holiday so that all workers, students and intellectuals of Central America have the possibility of honouring our great leader.\n\nThe crowds which have gathered to see the statue are estimated at more than twenty thousand brave citizens, and the Republican flag is waving in every street of Guatemala City on this blessed day."
 cenmil.43.a: "An impressive statue for an impressive leader."

 cenmil.200.t: "Supporting a Side in the Civil War"
 cenmil.200.d: "The United States of America have fallen into a second civil war, more destructive than the first one. Central America has always been deeply connected with the United States due to the United Fruit Company and similar businesses, however the military is divided on who to help. Some are advocating to aid the official United States government, while others would rather support the new American Union State. Depending on which side we choose, the victory or defeat of said faction could have severe consequences."
 cenmil.200.a: "Help the official regime!"
 cenmil.200.b: "Support the Union State!"

 cenmil.201.t: "The Central American Republic Asks for Protection"
 cenmil.201.d: "The Central American Republic has put forth a request to our nation to protect it from their enemies who threaten the integrity and survival of the Republic. Accepting their request would ultimately lead to them joining our faction, however committing ourselves to their defence could upset the already fragile balance of power of the region."
 cenmil.201.a: "Guarantee their Independence."
 cenmil.201.b: "Where is Central America again?"

 cenmil.202.t: "The Central American Republic Asks to Join Our Faction"
 cenmil.202.d: "The Central American Republic has put forth a request to join our military faction. While we could receive an additional ally who could potentially control the Panama Canal in the future, the balance of power of the region could be destroyed through such a move."
 cenmil.202.a: "Accept their demand."
 cenmil.202.b: "Central America is by Brazil, right?"

 cenmil.203.t: "The Status of Belize"
 cenmil.203.d: "Occupied during the British Revolution of 1925, British Honduras, or as it is now known as Belize, has been part of Guatemala ever since. Now that Guatemala has evolved into the Central American Republic, Belize remains a part of our nation. However, the British, better said the West Indies Federation, still claim Belize as a rightful part of their nation, which renders the full integration of Belize impossible. Our only possibility to set up ties with the Entente is to return the land, but this would severely hurt our international prestige. Keeping will however forever lock us from the Entente."
 cenmil.203.a: "Return Belize."
 cenmil.203.b: "Offer a Deal to the Federation."

 cenmil.204.t: "Central America Demands That We Revoke Our Belizean Claim"
 cenmil.204.d: "The Central American government has sent us a deal concerning the former colony of Belize. They demand that we renounce our claim on Belize and recognise its ownership by Central America, and in exchange our two nations will sign favourable trade deals to revive business ties."
 cenmil.204.a: "Accept the deal."
 cenmil.204.b: "Crazy and unacceptable terms!"

 cenmil.205.t: "The Federation Has Refused Our Terms!"
 cenmil.205.d: "The West Indies Federation have refused to revoke their claim on Belize and have called our terms crazy and unacceptable!"
 cenmil.205.a: "Back off and maintain the Status-Quo."
 cenmil.205.b: "Place an Embargo on the Federation!"

 cenmil.206.t: "Central America Embargoes Us!"
 cenmil.206.d: "Angry about our adamant position concerning the status of Belize, the Central American government has placed an embargo against us! They have promised to improve trade ties, but now they have made the opposite. While this will hurt both of our economies, giving in now would be a political humiliation."
 cenmil.206.a: "We will have to accept their terms."
 cenmil.206.b: "What is there even to trade with Central America?"

 cenmil.207.t: "The Federation Has Cut All Ties With Us!"
 cenmil.207.d: "The West Indies Federation has ignored our warnings, and is now ignoring our embargo! It seems like the dispute over Belize will never end..."
 cenmil.207.a: "Maintain the embargo."

 cenmil.208.t: "The Federation Has Revoked Their Claim!"
 cenmil.208.d: "The West Indies Federation has finally accepted to revoke their claims on Belize, which will open the path for its full integration."
 cenmil.208.a: "Great!"

 cenmil.209.t: "Our Request Has Been Accepted"
 cenmil.209.d: "We have secured the guarantee we have requested and now are protected from the enemies of the Republic."
 cenmil.209.a: "Great!"

 cenmil.210.t: "Our Request Has Been Denied"
 cenmil.210.d: "We have failed to secure the guarantee we have requested and now remain alone against the enemies of the Republic."
 cenmil.210.a: "Disappointing."

 cenmil.211.d: "We have been formally accepted into the faction and can now participate in the international crusade against Syndicalism!"

 cenmil.212.d: "We have not been accepted into the faction, but we will continue our struggle against Syndicalism on our own."

 cenmil.220.t: "The Status of the IRCA"
 cenmil.220.d: "The International Railways of Central America, short IRCA, has held the monopoly on rail transportation and the ownership of most railway tracks in Central America since 1912. The IRCA, now part of the United Fruit Company, will be a major partner or obstacle in our quest to lay the railway from Guatemala to Panama. Previous Guatemalan administrations have signed various deals with the IRCA, and it is now up to us if we respect these signatures or break the deals in favour of a state-controlled railway."
 cenmil.220.a: "Grant them a monopoly as long as they follow our orders."
 cenmil.220.b: "Respect the previous deals."
 cenmil.220.c: "Nationalise the IRCA."

 cenmil.221.t: "The Planning of the Railway"
 cenmil.221.d: "Building a railway across the harsh terrain of Central America is not an easy task, and a proper railway suited for all kinds of transportation needs will be very expensive. As the Trans-Central American railway is a major prestige project for the government, some advocate that the government takes over the entire cost of the railway. While very costly, that would also guarantee state control of the rails. At the same time, foreign investors are also interested in the construction of the railway and could take over part of the costs."
 cenmil.221.a: "Let the investors handle the costs."
 cenmil.221.b: "Take over parts of the bill."
 cenmil.221.c: "Fund the project only with government money."

 cenmil.222.t: "Lack of Funding for the Next Rail Section"
 cenmil.222.d: "While the expansion of the already existing IRCA tracks was relatively cheap, the extension towards Tegucigalpa has proven to be very costly. The budget planned for this section has already been exceeded and the railway is still a long distance from the Honduran city. The hilly terrain has caused major delays, and now the construction organisers are asking for additional funding."
 cenmil.222.a: "Let our corporate partners pay."
 cenmil.222.b: "Increase our funding."

 cenmil.223.t: "Passing Through Syndicalist Land"
 cenmil.223.d: "The next section of the Trans-Central American railway will be passing through Nicaragua, which still hasn't fully recovered from the Syndicalist revolution. The construction organisers have made their fears clear over potential Syndicalist sabotage and attacks, and have asked for additional manpower from the army to guard the construction sites."
 cenmil.223.a: "What could possibly go wrong."
 cenmil.223.b: "Increase the manpower of the guarding forces."

 cenmil.224.t: "Syndicalist Attack on the Railway"
 cenmil.224.d: "Syndicalist partisans have kidnapped multiple construction planners who have been sent out to plan the railway section passing through the hills near the city of León, and have demanded an important ransom for their release. In order to get our men back, we were forced to pay the ransom, and the Syndicalists are most likely using the money to buy up equipment for future operations."
 cenmil.224.a: "So this is what could go wrong?"

 cenmil.225.t: "Passing Into Costa Rica"
 cenmil.225.d.costa.exists: "Despite Syndicalist harassment, the Trans-Central American railway has reached Managua in time. The next section of the railway however will be passing through Costa Rican land, so we will either need to ask their government for permission of the construction, which they will most likely refuse, or wait until we have finally captured Costa Rica."
 cenmil.225.d.costa.no.exists: "Despite Syndicalist harassment, the Trans-Central American railway has reached Managua in time. The next section of the railway will be passing into the recently pacified Costa Rica, where we expect minor resistance to the construction."
 cenmil.225.a: "Next year in San José."
 cenmil.225.b: "Next year in San José, with permission."
 cenmil.225.c: "Next year in San José, once it is part of the Union."
 cenmil.225.e: "We have reached our destination: Managua."

 cenmil.226.t: "Central America Asks for Permission for a Railway Project"
 cenmil.226.d: "The Central American government has asked us for permission to construct the section of the Trans-Central American railway passing through Costa Rica. The railway, once finished, will increase cross-border trade with the rest of Central America, however large parts of the government fear that the railway will not be used for trade, but to integrate us into Central America once the time is right."
 cenmil.226.a: "Grant them permission."
 cenmil.226.b: "Refuse."

 cenmil.227.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Has Given Permission!"

The Panama Canal is the single most important sea way in the Americas and connects the Pacific with the Caribbean Sea, but it also separates the major urban regions of Panama from the rest of Central America. The last section will connect San José, passing through David, with the western bank of the Canal. However, we will need the permission of the Panamanian government to construct the railway."

 cenmil.230.d: "The Central American government has asked us for permission to construct the final section of the Trans-Central American railway, which would connect San José with the western bank of the Panama Canal. While this would improve the infrastructure of western Panama, large parts of the government fear that the railway will be used for military purposes in order to integrate us into the Central American Republic."

 cenmil.250.t: "Major Strike!"
 cenmil.250.d: "Unhappy with their current salaries and work conditions, many plantation workers in Central America have joined a major strike. Their demands are crazy things like salaries which they can live on and less brutality by the land owners."
 cenmil.250.a: "Darn Syndicalists."

 cenmil.252.t: "Dealing with the Major Strike"
 cenmil.252.d: "As the strikers hurt both our economy and our business relations, the congress has decided to stop waiting for them to stop striking, but to intervene. By sending in either the army or the police, we will satisfy the land owners but there might be casualties. Agreeing to their demands will be humiliating but will hurt the foreigners more than us."

While we won't purge our fellow officers and soldiers, only we will have power now."
 CENmil_destroy_opposition: "Destroy the Opposition"
 CENmil_destroy_opposition_desc: "The opposition is an useless way to reduce the power of a regime by distracting it from the important subjects of governance and administration. We don't need an opposition to tell us that we're doing this or that wrong; We do nothing wrong, they just think wrongly."

## AuthDem
 CENmil_military_control: "Military Control"
 CENmil_military_control_desc: "Anastasio Somoza García and his Partido Liberal Nacionalista have won the congress election and now run the nation. The military has destroyed Syndicalism in Central America and the military has opened the path to unification, therefore the military has the right to rule, but an outright dictatorship is bad for the reputation of the state."
 CENmil_puppet_civil_state: "Puppet Civilian State"
 CENmil_puppet_civil_state_desc: "A military dictatorship is more of a derogatory term than an objective one. No, Central America is not a military dictatorship, it's a full-fledged democracy, just with Central American characteristics. We just remove the 'demo' and replace it with 'strato'."
 CENmil_permit_elections: "Permit Elections"
 CENmil_permit_elections_desc: "The people demand elections; the people demand to vote... We have no choice but to accept, but on our terms. The truth is, the election has been rigged from the start."
 CENmil_check_opposition: "Keep the Opposition in Check"
 CENmil_check_opposition_desc: "The opposition is a natural, yet annoying part of any nation. Some people will always find a way to disagree with the government, even if the latter has protected the entire region from the tentacles of Syndicalism and even if the latter has defended the freedom and liberty of its citizen in face of the dangers of dictatorship."
 CENmil_foreign_collaboration: "Foreign Collaboration"
 CENmil_foreign_collaboration_desc: "It is in the interest of the nation that we maintain close relations with the major powers of the world and that we collaborate with the strong nations around us. It would be foolish to isolate ourselves, surrounded by Syndicalists in the north and proto-Syndicalists in the south."
 CENmil_empower_companies: "Empower Companies"
 CENmil_empower_companies_desc: "We should not only collaborate with the major powers of the world, but also with the major companies of the world. The United Fruit Company, the prime success story, has brought modern railways, roads, radio installations and many other things to Central America, as well as a lot of money into the wallets of Somoza García's family and friends."
 CENmil_edit_constitution: "Edit the Constitution"
 CENmil_edit_constitution_desc: "The constitution is a sacred document that is to be protected at all times, but the content of the constitution doesn't deserve the same protection. If a law doesn't fit us, we just remove it. If we find that something is missing, we just add it. Nothing is easier than editing the constitution if you hold all the power."
 CENmil_limit_rights: "Limit Rights"
 CENmil_limit_rights_desc: "Rights are not always the right approach to guarantee freedom. Our citizens might have the right to hold their opinions, but this ends up creating Syndicalists who fight freedom. In order to protect the freedom and liberty of our people, we need to limit the rights that threaten it."
 CENmil_economic_control: "Economic Control"
 CENmil_economic_control_desc: "By controlling the entire economy of Central America, we can make sure that its profits and products will be used for the right things, such as making Somoza García's family members even richer. We will also be able to block off for example farmers, who are hostile towards our government policies, from bringing their goods to a port using government-owned transport systems."
 CENmil_national_monopoly: "National Monopoly"
 CENmil_national_monopoly_desc: "The Partido Liberal Nacionalista controls the state, it controls the economy, it controls the media, it controls every aspect of Central America. We have slowly and quietly purged the opposition, and no one stands between us and full power."

### Economic Tree
 CENmil_interventionism: "Interventionism"
 CENmil_interventionism_desc: "We cannot rely on the companies and investors only to fix the economic issues that the Republic is facing. The government needs to intervene in the economic process to create new opportunities and to improve the industry and infrastructure of our nation."
 CENmil_laissez_faire: "Laissez-Faire"
 CENmil_laissez_faire_desc: "The government is inherently inefficient in matters of economics, and as such we should hand over the job of fixing the economy to the businessmen and investors who have major experience in this sector. The government should only provide safety and inspire confidence in our economy."

# Infrastructure
 CENmil_infrastructure_fund: "Infrastructure Fund"
 CENmil_infrastructure_fund_desc: "Central America is missing major roads and railway networks. By rail, you can only get from Guatemala City to San Salvador, and even then, the existing tracks are mostly used by American businesses for freight transportation needs. Many villages and regions of Central America don't even have road connections which can be used by heavy transports. This needs to change!"
 CENmil_portuary_expansion: "Expanding our Ports"
 CENmil_portuary_expansion_desc: "The main economic sector of Central America remains the exportation of agricultural products. In order to increase our export capacities and as such the profits, we need to expand our ports to permit for large cargo ships to lay anchor there. Those ports could also come in handy for the ARCA."
 CENmil_world_exports: "The World Market"
 CENmil_world_exports_desc: "Our agricultural sector is not seizing to grow, and our exports have reached record values. With access to the entire world market, our farmers will be able to sell produce to the markets of Sofia and [202.GetName], to Tokyo and Sydney, with large profits."
 CENmil_roads_and_rails: "Roads and Rails"
 CENmil_roads_and_rails_desc: "Our economy is growing rapidly, however the poor infrastructure of Central America is keeping our growth rate in limits. The government has launched a new massive programme 'Roads and Rails', which provides part of the budget for infrastructure projects to connect the various regions of Central America."
 CENmil_infrastructural_profits: "Infrastructural Profits"
 CENmil_infrastructural_profits_desc: "Our infrastructure projects such as the 'Roads and Rails' initiative have cost a lot of money, and have forced the government to take up additional debt. Now that these projects are mostly finished, they are starting to bring in profits through usage fees and the additional economic growth."
 CENmil_briding_ca: "Bridging Central America"
 CENmil_briding_ca_desc: "Central America's communication lines are very sparse and the existing lines are poorly maintained. We need to invest strongly in communication technologies such as telegraphs and radio in order to bridge the jungles and hills of Central America while remaining in the government offices."

# Industry
 CENmil_industrialization_program: "Industrialisation Programme"
 CENmil_industrialization_program_desc: "The industrial base of Central America is very limited and our small heavy industry base can't properly handle the needs of the citizens and of the army. We need to industrialise our nation to take it out of the 17th century into the 20th century."
 CENmil_local_manufacturing: "Local Manufacturing"
 CENmil_local_manufacturing_desc: "Unlike the industrial regions of the Rhineland or Wallonia, Central America does not possess any concentrated industrial zones and has a very limited consumer goods industry. By promoting local manufacturing and providing help to local producers, we can increase our industrial output."
 CENmil_made_in_ca: "Made in Central America"
 CENmil_made_in_ca_desc: "So far, most consumer goods in the shops of Central America have printed on them 'Made in Germany', or 'Made in Canada'... Instead of protectionist measures to try to kick those products out, we should promote local production so that 'Made in Central America' becomes dominant in the shops of our nation."
 CENmil_invite_foreign: "Invite Foreign Investors"
 CENmil_invite_foreign_desc: "The government doesn't possesses the funds to industrialise the entire nation on itself. We need to cooperate with our corporate friends and our investing allies to help develop our nation."
 CENmil_corporate_investments: "Corporate Investments"
 CENmil_corporate_investments_desc: "We need to promote further corporate investments to increase the industrial development of our nation."
 CENmil_cheap_labour: "Cheap Labour"
 CENmil_cheap_labour_desc: "In order to attract foreign companies, we have reduced corporate taxes significantly and have provided major legal protection. However, one main selling point of Central America remains the very low wages, which permits e.g. American companies to produce much cheaper than in the US."

# Agriculture
 CENmil_agricultural_dev: "Agricultural Development"
 CENmil_agricultural_dev_desc: "The agriculture sector of Central America remains the most important pillar of our economy, and the majority of foreign investments end up in our farms and plantations. We need to provide additional support in order to mechanise our agricultural sector and to improve the living conditions of our farmers."
 CENmil_ufc_protecc: "Protect Corporate Assets"
 CENmil_ufc_protecc_desc: "In the chaos that has followed from the Nicaraguan Revolution and the turmoil in the other nations of Central America, our corporate allies have come under serious attack by Syndicalist and liberal forces alike. We need to safeguard the corporate assets so that confidence can be re-established in our economy."
 CENmil_ufc_attacc: "Further Land Grants"
 CENmil_ufc_attacc_desc: "Foreign companies such as the United Fruit Company hold major influence, both economic and political, in our nation. By providing those companies with additional, tax-free land, they will support the policies of our current administration and increase the agricultural output of our nation."
 CENmil_cash_crop_export: "Cash Crop Profits"
 CENmil_cash_crop_export_desc: "Cash crops make up a significant part of our agricultural output and bring in large profits."
 CENmil_efficent_plantations: "Efficient Plantations"
 CENmil_efficent_plantations_desc: "Many of the plantations of Central America have a very low output as they use outdated farming methods and are set up in an inefficient way. With additional government funding and educational investments, we can massively increase the agricultural output of our economy."
 CENmil_diverse_output: "Diverse Output"
 CENmil_diverse_output_desc: "As in any economic sector, we cannot rely on a single type of crop. In case of price fluctuations or crop failure, we need to have a diverse agriculture to overcome the difficulties presented."

### Army
 CENmil_army_investments: "Army Investments"
 CENmil_army_investments_desc: "The army is the backbone of the entire Republic. The credit for the successful unification goes to our military, and they will protect and expand our Union forever. In order to strengthen the state and the armed forces, the defence budget needs to be drastically increased."

## Warfare with European Characteristics
 CENmil_army_european: "European Doctrine"
 CENmil_army_european_desc: "The enemies that the Central American Republic faces aren't some unorganised guerrilla forces or an army consisting of a single division. Our enemies to the north and the south have powerful industrial bases, strong air forces and large armies. To defend our way of life, we need to adapt a modern, European doctrine."
 CENmil_increase_firepower: "Standardised Equipment"
 CENmil_increase_firepower_desc: "Our army currently operates a massive amount of diverse equipment, e.g. we currently use not one but multiple versions of the outdated Mauser rifle! In the chaos that is our military arsenal, nothing short of a massive standardisation programme will be able to sort things out."
 CENmil_standard_equi: "Heavy Guns"
 CENmil_standard_equi_desc: "Our army lacks heavy fire weapons despite the fact that artillery has proven to be decisive in the battles of the Weltkrieg. We need to rapidly equip our army with heavy guns and train specialised battalions to operate them."
 CENmil_heavy_guns: "Motorisation Effort"
 CENmil_heavy_guns_desc: "As we reform and expand our army, we are facing severe logistical issues. The terrain of Central America is rough and roads are rare, however we still need to get our artillery pieces from the factory or the port to our divisions on the border. Trucks will solve this problem."
 CENmil_chain_command: "Reorganise Chain of Command"
 CENmil_chain_command_desc: "Just like our military arsenal, our chain of command is nothing short of anarchy. As we are in the process of integrating armies from multiple nations into one, which all had different doctrines and hierarchies, no one knows anymore who takes orders from who and who is on top. We need to fully reorganise the entire chain of command."
 CENmil_trained_officers: "Trained Officers"
 CENmil_trained_officers_desc: "Our army has a severe lack of low ranking officers, and in general, trained officers who know what they are doing is as rare as successful Syndicalism at the moment. An extensive enrolling and training programme will be the first step to fix this terrible issue."
 CENmil_border_exercises: "Border Exercises"
 CENmil_border_exercises_desc: "The terrain of Central America is very rough and unforgiving, and it is badly mapped. By performing regular exercises and war games near our enemies' borders, we will know the terrain much better than the invaders and at the same time we will train our army."
 CENmil_professional_soldiers: "Professional Soldiers"
 CENmil_professional_soldiers_desc: "Regular conscripts may have the spirit and the will to fight, however when the first bullets are flying through the air, they will be hopelessly scared. A professional soldier on the other hand will remain calm and do his duty of defending his nation at all times."

## Central Army Tree
 CENmil_industrial_warfare: "Industrial Warfare"
 CENmil_industrial_warfare_desc: "A strong army isn't an army with a large manpower pool, but an army with a powerful industrial base to back it up. Without a proper economy, no nation will be able to fight in the 20th century."
 CENmil_mil_ind_complex: "Military Industrial Complex"
 CENmil_mil_ind_complex_desc: "Our military and heavy industries are unable to fully equip and supply our army. The government will need to step in to increase the capacity of the military industrial complex so that every soldier will get the rifle and helmet he needs."
 CENmil_scientific_warfare: "Scientific Warfare"
 CENmil_scientific_warfare_desc: "A strong army isn't an army with a large manpower poll, or an army with a powerful industrial base to back it up, but an army that has access to the most modern and sophisticated equipment and tactics."
 CENmil_military_science: "Military Science"
 CENmil_military_science_desc: "Central America doesn't have many educated scientists, and most of them don't work for the military. While we mostly profit of the technologies developed by our allies, we can't remain dependent forever."
 CENmil_economic_warfare: "Economic Warfare"
 CENmil_economic_warfare_desc: "A strong army isn't an army with a large manpower poll, an army with a powerful industrial base to back it up, or an army that has access to the most modern and sophisticated equipment and tactics, but an army that can use all of these threes with the backing of the entire nation's economy and production capacities."
 CENmil_arms_deals: "Arms Deals"
 CENmil_arms_deals_desc: "With our limited military industrial capacities, we will have to import most of our equipment for now. By negotiating good deals and trading with our close allies, our army will enjoy modern equipment at a low price."
 CENmil_equi_developing: "Equipment Development"
 CENmil_equi_developing_desc: "We can't rely forever on imports, as the political environment of the world may change from one day to another, rending our allies our enemies. We need to become more independent on the development and production of equipment."

## Warfare with Central American Characteristics
 CENmil_army_ca: "Central American Doctrine"
 CENmil_army_ca_desc: "To the north and the south, the enemies we face are much stronger than we are. Even though it is hard to admit, Sandino and his Syndicalist traitors have nonetheless proven that a smaller force can defeat a much larger enemy when using the terrain and the people's support to your advantage."
 CENmil_adapt_terrain: "Adapt to the Terrain"
 CENmil_adapt_terrain_desc: "Central America's terrain is very rough and unforgiving, except to those who know it well. Throughout the enemies' offensives, we will be able to harass and destroy them thanks to our knowledge of the terrain."
 CENmil_autonomous_officers: "Autonomous Officers"
 CENmil_autonomous_officers_desc: "Guerrilla warfare requires swift reactions and decisions taken by those who are in eye sight of the enemy, so we will need to give the officers in the field large autonomy to act independently from high command."
 CENmil_small_units: "Small Units"
 CENmil_small_units_desc: "Waging war in such difficult terrain requires large flexibility and mobility, which larger units don't have. Squads of a couple of men will be able to outmanoeuvre and outsmart the enemy in the jungles and hills of Central America."
 CENmil_improved_conscrip: "Improved Conscription"
 CENmil_improved_conscrip_desc: "In order to fight off our enemies, we will need to massively increase the size and manpower of our army. We need to increase our levels of conscription to get as many men as possible into the armed forces."
 CENmil_guerrila_tactics: "Guerrilla Tactics"
 CENmil_guerrila_tactics_desc: "In order to be an efficient guerrilla fighter, one needs to know much more than the environment. The art of camouflage and deception can strongly increase the efficiency of our soldiers, and they will also need to know when to engage and when not to."
 CENmil_guerilla_spirit: "Guerrilla Spirit"
 CENmil_guerilla_spirit_desc: "It takes an iron will to fight successfully as a guerrilla fighter. Many units will have to survive in terrible conditions, while being hunted by the enemies' air force and artillery."
 CENmil_large_force: "Large Force"
 CENmil_large_force_desc: "In order to rival the forces of our enemies, we need to further expand the size of our army."

 CENmil_military_awesome: "A Military with a State"
 CENmil_military_awesome_desc: "Upon the military rests the entire nation. The army has unified Central America, the army has fought off the enemies of Central America, and the army will keep Central America united. The military doesn't serve the state, but the state serves the military."

### Air and Naval Tree
## Air Tree
 CENmil_faca: "The FARCA"
 CENmil_faca_desc: "Formed from the air forces of the nations that are now part of the Republic, the Fuerza Area Republicana de Centroamérica will need a much larger budget and more manpower to effectively fulfil its task of defending Central America's airspace."
 CENmil_air_lads: "Air Officers"
 CENmil_air_lads_desc: "As with every branch of the military, the air force is not a newly created branch but the result of the merging of the air forces of the constitute nations of the Union. As such, it has no standardised chain of command or doctrine and needs reform."
 CENmil_aa_positions: "AA Positions"
 CENmil_aa_positions_desc: "Our air force is by far not large enough to guarantee that our industrial and infrastructural centres are defended from enemy bombers. In order to protect these vital centres, we need more and better anti air batteries."
 CENmil_airfield_expansion: "Airfield Expansion"
 CENmil_airfield_expansion_desc: "In order to perform properly, our air force needs new, modernised air bases to operate from."
 CENmil_fighters: "FARCA Fighters"
 CENmil_fighters_desc: "Our air force is currently mostly operating outdated biplanes. In order to fight the coming air battles, we need to import new, modern designs."
 CENmil_cas: "FARCA CAS Aircraft"
 CENmil_cas_desc: "Our air force doesn't have a standard close air support aircraft and our best ground supporters are converted fighter biplanes. In order to help our troops, we need to import new, modern designs."
 CENmil_bombers: "FARCA Bombers"
 CENmil_bombers_desc: "Our air force doesn't possess any heavy aircraft, and as such is unable to perform bombing missions against enemy industrial targets. We need to import new, modern designs."
 CENmil_protecc_sky: "Protecting the Sky"
 CENmil_protecc_sky_desc: "Thanks to our reforms, our air force is no longer seen as an air farce but as a real fighting force. With the new, modern aircraft and skilled pilots, it will be able to protect the beautiful Central America sky."

# Shared Air/Navy Tree
 CENmil_naval_air_coord: "Naval Air Coordination"
 CENmil_naval_air_coord_desc: "Given our country stands in a very narrow isthmus, any potential enemy will try to take advantage of the long shorelines and easy approaches from the air the sea gives. We must seize this opportunity first and deny it to the enemy."
 CENmil_nav_bombers: "FARCA Naval Bombers"
 CENmil_nav_bombers_desc: "Undisputed control of both sides of the Panama Canal can be achieved through a superior navy, but that requires enormous investments we can't make. Controlling movement of navies from the skies is a cost-optimal solution."

## Naval Tree
 CENmil_fnca: "The ARCA"
 CENmil_fnca_desc: "With our newly formed nation, new needs arise. Previous Central American nations had no need for a large navy, and did little to pursue any sort of naval dominance. With our reunification, we need to reassert ourselves at a regional level, and we can't do so without a navy. As such, we shall found the 'Armada de la Republica de Centroamérica' and begin investing in its development in order to project our power!"
 CENmil_select_main_port: "Selecting a Main Naval Base"
 CENmil_select_main_port_desc: "Considering the lack of interest in the past in forming functional navies, all of our ports have been built with trade in mind and are not suitable to hold a large surface fleet. We have several ports in our nation that are very promising options to invest in their improvement, but we need to choose which one, as we obviously don't possess the means to upgrade all of our ports."
 CENmil_screens: "Screen Ships"
 CENmil_screens_desc: "One of the steps towards establishing a new navy would be to establish a functional escort fleet, which is capable of defending our trade routes from rogue submarines in case of war. It will also help down the line when we can field larger ships, as the escorts are as vital to a large surface fleet as the very flagship. Since we lack any sort of dockyards in our nation, our best option to establish a fleet fast will be to acquire foreign screen ships until we can establish dockyards of our own."
 CENmil_cruisers: "Cruisers"
 CENmil_cruisers_desc: "One of the steps towards establishing a new navy would be to acquire a light cruiser that's able to provide support to our forces in the coastline and deal with enemy destroyers in the sea. Since we lack any sort of dockyards in our nation, our best option to field a cruiser will be to acquire a foreign cruiser for now, at least until we can establish dockyards to sustain a fleet on our own."
 CENmil_flagship: "Flagship for our Navy"
 CENmil_flagship_desc: "With escort ships and the cruiser ready to set sail, we now need a flagship for our young fleet. With a flagship we could finally start projecting our naval power towards the Caribbean and to finally have the means to face a small fleet in the open sea. Since we lack any sort of dockyards in our nation, our best option to obtain a flagship will be to acquire it from a foreign power until we can establish dockyards to build a flagship ourselves."
 CENmil_naval_lads: "Naval Officers"
 CENmil_naval_lads_desc: "With our new fleet, we have a new demand for officers to occupy the helm of our ships, and new admirals to coordinate our fleet. While some nations were in the progress of making a naval academy, like El Salvador, our best choice will be to send our officers to foreign naval academies in order to get acquainted with the modern basics of naval warfare and fleet manoeuvring."
 CENmil_merchant_navy: "Central American Merchant Navy"
 CENmil_merchant_navy_desc: "Central America not only needs military ships. Our great nation unfortunately lacks many resources that are plentiful in other places of the world, and we cannot continue our development unless we have a way to bring those resources to us. Provided this, we shall invest in a merchant fleet that will be tasked with keeping the Centroamerican trade alive and prosperous."
 CENmil_dual_sea_protecc: "Dual Seas Doctrine"
 CENmil_dual_sea_protecc_desc: "Our nation is one of the few in the world that occupy two separate oceans at the same time, having ports in both the Atlantic and the Pacific. However, this blessing is also a curse, as we will have to split our efforts in order to cover both oceans at the same time in case of a conflict. Considering we lack the ships in order to win a war by attrition, the defence of our 2 shores takes primacy."

 cafla.1.t: "Archaeological Expedition to the San Andres Site"
 cafla.1.d: "The American archaeologist John Dimmick has arrived today to our country, and has made a very particular request. In the San Andres homestead there have been reports by visitors of the Dueñas family of ancient structures which are partially buried, and could shed light on the history of pre-Columbian Mesoamerican Civilisations. He claims he will finance the expedition with his personal wealth all on his own, and they just need us to give them the green light. [Root.GetLeader] has already announced his support for the project, and has contacted the Dueñas family personally to ask for their lands to be visited by the expedition. After a meeting with both a representative of the Dueñas family, Dimmick and [Root.GetLeader], they have agreed to give a carte blanche to the expedition at the dig site until the end of May, with the coming of the rain season. Hopefully their discoveries will keep archaeologists interested in our country for years to come."
 cafla.1.a: "They are welcome to explore our Past."

 cafla.2.t: "The Izalco Volcano Intensifies Its Strombolian Activity"
 cafla.2.d: "The Izalco Volcano, located in the Sansonante department, El Salvador, has begun a series of irregular eruptions, breaking the cycle of one strombolian eruption per month to nearly one every twenty minutes, along with an increasing amount of ash and lava coming out of its interior. While the Izalco has erupted nearly ceaselessly since it was born in 1722, the 'Faro del Pacifico' is causing unrest in our population, as fears of a violent volcanic eruption are beginning to surface."
 cafla.2.a: "We'll have to keep watch on it."

 cafla.3.t: "The Izalco Volcano Intensifies Its Strombolian Activity Even Further"
 cafla.3.d: "Reports from our geologists indicate that the Izalco volcano is indeed increasing its activity even further than before. Now the volcano erupts once every eight minutes, and the local civilian populace is becoming increasingly uneasy about the situation, as there are no current government plans in case of an eruption."
 cafla.3.a: "Prepare evacuation plans, just in case..."

 cafla.4.t: "The Izalco Volcano Goes Back to Normal Activity Levels"
 cafla.4.d: "Despite recent panic regarding the Izalco volcano, our geologists report that the volcano has finally returned to its normal activities, and while it's still having normal eruptions of ash and lava towards the southern sector, the people of Sansonante can rest easy as the volcanic activity starts to recede."
 cafla.4.a: "Thank God it's over."

 cafla.5.t: "Flooding at San Salvador"
 cafla.5.d: "Due to the recent weather and the poor maintenance of San Salvador's drainage system, there has been a flooding in the Salvadoran city. While there have been no reported deaths by the incident, the damage done to the city's infrastructure is still significant and it will take some time until the city is back on its feet."
 cafla.5.a: "An unfortunate turn of events."

 cafla.6.t: "Paricutín Volcano Erupts in Michoacán"
 cafla.6.d: "We have received reports today of bad news from the small town of Paricutín. The nearby volcano Paracutín has begun erupting during the afternoon, and the small town's populace now stands threatened by the rains of ash, and our specialists confirm that the lava flow will cover the city at the current pace of emissions. The town have been ordered being evacuation immediately by President [Root.GetLeader] and efforts to relocate them near Uruapan shall begin. This will however take time and effort, but it's a necessary step to ensure the safety of our citizens from a natural disaster."
 cafla.6.a: "An unfortunate turn of events."

 cafla.7.t: "Earthquake Hits Guatemala!"
 cafla.7.d: "At 17:37, an earthquake of 7.7 Richter scale begun near the Guatemalan Pacific coast. The Earthquake has caused extensive damage to the area's infrastructure, tumbling telegraph lines and fracturing the Inter-American Highway. The town of Tecpan has been severely damaged as well, with nearly 60% of the civilian housing being demolished by the earthquake. The historic Palacio de los Capitanes Generales in Antigua Guatemala has also been partially damaged, as well as many old churches from the colonial era in the area. Unfortunately, thirty eight people have met their end in this tragic incident, and now we will have to deal with the aftermath of such an awful natural disaster."
 cafla.7.a: "Let's hope this isn't the First of Many."

 cafla.8.t: "Foundation of the Museo Regional de Arqueología in Copan"
 cafla.8.d: "Today, the Museo Regional de Arqueologia was finally founded in the town of Copán. The Copán Archaeological site houses one of the biggest surviving architectural complexes from the early pre-classic era, as well as one of the biggest cities of the old Mayan civilisation. The site was closed to the public in 1935 and has undertook an extensive restoration work, with the Acropolis, the main square, the 'Staircase of hieroglyphics', Temples 11 and 22 as well as the '38 Estelas' and all the altars being the main focus of the restoration efforts. With the inauguration of the museum, the archaeological site is open once more to the public to explore the past of pre-Columbian Central America."
 cafla.8.a: "Another step towards preserving our history."

 cafla.9.t: "Earthquake Hits El Salvador"
 cafla.9.d: "A strong earthquake has hit the small towns of Santa Clara and San Esteban, lying nearby the San Vicente Volcano. With a scale of 6.1 in the Richter scale, the earthquake has decimated the small towns, taking the lives of two hundred people and causing extensive damage in both towns and the roads connecting them. However, the earthquake doesn't seem to have been caused by the nearby volcano, and so the people of the San Vicente department can breathe a sigh of relief as the volcano is not giving any signals of activating any time soon."
 cafla.9.a: "Let's hope our luck improves."

 cafla.10.d: "Another earthquake has hit El Salvador, this time in the Ahuachapán municipality. The earthquake, with a strength of 5.9 in the Richter scale, has caused severe damage in the municipality of Ahualchapán and Atiquizaya. Luckily enough, there have been no reported dead due to the earthquake, and while the physical damage to both municipalities is extensive, rebuilding them won't be a difficult task as they were both fairly underdeveloped."
 cafla.10.a: "At least Everyone is Safe."

 cafla.11.d: "Another earthquake has hit El Salvador, this time in the municipality of Jucuapa. The earthquake began at 5:02 AM with a strength of 6.2 in the Richter scale, and when the emergency services where already mobilising, another earthquake began at 5:06 AM which caused even more extensive damage than the first one. The earthquake has caused severe damage in the departments of La Paz, Usulután and San Miguel and it is estimated that has taken the lives of four hundred people, wounded nearly a thousand and leaving more than twenty thousand people homeless. Plans are already been drawn by the 'Comité General Ejecutivo Prodamnificados' to resettle the victims to El Salvador, but it will be a costly endeavour..."
