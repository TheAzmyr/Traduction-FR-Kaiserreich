### Intro Screen ###
 PAN_country_intro_header: "Status of Panamá"
 PAN_country_intro_content: "In 1931, following accusations of government corruption and inability to handle the economic depression, the public rose up, led by Acción Comunal, a nationalist movement, and appointed Harmodio Arias Madrid and his National Revolutionary Party, formed from Acción Comunal itself, as leader of the Provisional Government.\n\nOne year later, they held elections and the Madrid-led NRP won easily. Immediately, Madrid's government began to stimulate the economy with public work programmes, improving economic conditions and creating jobs. However, despite the economic stimulation, the Panamanian economy is still struggling. The next elections are scheduled for April of 1936, four years after the first election, with economic recovery on the minds of both the parties and voters."

### Events ###
 panama.2.t: "1936 General Elections"
 panama.2.d: "With economic recovery finally obtainable, the 1936 elections may be the most important elections in Panamanian history. The two major parties are the National Liberal Party, led by Ricardo Joaquín Alfaro Jované, and the National Revolutionary Party, led by Harmodio Arias Madrid."
 panama.2.a: "National Revolutionary Party."
 panama.2.b: "National Liberal Party."

 panama.3.t: "National Police Coup"
 panama.3.d: "The National Police up to now has been silently sitting in the background waiting for our government to make a mistake. Now, with the country more disjointed than ever, they have stepped in to 'restore order' to Panama. This could spell the end of Panamanian democracy."
 panama.3.a: "What?!"

 panama.4.t: "Conservative Government"
 panama.4.d: "Due to instability in the populace and the government, Ricardo Joaquín Alfaro Jované has been forced to resign alongside his cabinet, and has requested that Juan Arosema forms a new cabinet as President. Arosema's government will likely undo many of the reforms of the Progressive government, especially those regarding the encouragement of labour unions."
 panama.4.a: "Hopefully the worst is now over."

 panama.5.t: "Canal in Crisis"
 panama.5.d: "Since the outbreak of the Second American Civil War, the Panama Canal Zone has been weak and unguarded. We could seize it to protect trade along the Canal and to appease the public, whose opinion is largely against the existence of the Canal Zone."
 panama.5.a: "Very well."

 panama.6.t: "Canada Demands that Panama Joins the Entente"
 panama.6.d: "The Canadians have demanded that we join the Entente so they can have the Canal under their influence. They guarantee that the Canal will remain in Panamanian hands, with a small peacekeeping force deployed to assist us. They will also likely redirect some of the canal profits to their own empire, reducing our own profits from the Canal."
 panama.6.a: "We have no choice but to join."
 panama.6.b: "We shall never surrender our sovereignty!"

 panama.7.t: "Canada Demands Panama Canal"
 panama.7.d: "The Canadians have demanded that we hand over control of the Panama Canal to them. This would essentially be a restoration of the status quo for us, with the Canal Zone acting as foreign sovereign territory. In return, the Canadians promise not to harm our sovereignty."
 panama.7.a: "We have no choice but to accept."
 panama.7.b: "Never again shall our lands be foreign!"

 panama.8.t: "Canada Prepares Invasion"
 panama.8.d: "Canada has not taken our refusal well. They have begun planning an all-out invasion to be executed within the next few days."
 panama.8.a: "Once more unto the breach, dear friends."

 panama.9.t: "The National Police"
 panama.9.d: "Our policy of foreign investments does not fit well with the National Police, and they are likely to coup us, should we step too far into that direction. We should find some way to pacify them as to avoid such a destabilisation."
 panama.9.a: "Perhaps some money shall influence their viewpoint..."
 panama.9.b: "Purge all disloyal elements!"
 panama.9.c: "Leaving them alone is surely the best choice."

 panama.10.t: "Status of Trade Unions"
 panama.10.d: "Trade Unions do not have a long history in our nation. As we begin to become a truly modern, 20th century nation, it may be a good idea to emphasise the government's policy regarding unions. The conservative faction and the National Police both are strongly against unions, fearing events similar to the British and French collapses, and we'll have to deal with their opposition should we encourage unions."
 panama.10.a: "Encourage unions, but regulate them."
 panama.10.b: "Encourage unions and leave them unregulated."
 panama.10.c: "Say nothing on the matter."

 panama.11.t: "Status of Trade Unions - Followup"
 panama.11.d: "The conservatives have long complained about our policy regarding trade unions, and strongly suggests that we simply opt to ban trade unions to preserve the de facto coalition between the conservatives and liberals."
 panama.11.a: "Ban the unions."
 panama.11.b: "Stay the course."

 panama.12.t: "Status of Trade Unions - Followup"
 panama.12.d: "Our complete removal of restrictions on trade unions is going poorly. Both the conservatives and the National Police are urging us to immediately revoke the policy, or they will be forced to take 'significant action'. Unfortunately, at this point, there truly is not much our government can do. Banning the unions would now cause widespread panic and riots, and we can really only appease one of the two factions on our back."
 panama.12.a: "Suppress political resistance."
 panama.12.b: "Suppress police resistance."
 panama.12.c: "Hopefully, it will blow over."

 panama.13.t: "Who Should We Ask to Invest?"
 panama.13.d: "Our options for investment are quite thin since no one in Europe or Asia is particularly interested in us, and South America is dealing with its own issues."
 panama.13.a: "Ask Canada."
 panama.13.b: "Ask the USA."
 panama.13.c: "Ask our overlord..."

 panama.14.t: "Panama Asks for Investment"
 panama.14.d: "Panama has asked us for a 'generous sum' of investment money, promising profit within a year. There is an obvious benefit to this, but it will come with a small hit to our economy."
 panama.14.a: "Let us invest."
 panama.14.b: "Sounds like some sort of scam."

 panama.15.t: "Investments Declined"
 panama.15.d: "Unfortunately, our generous request for investments have been declined."
 panama.15.a: "Sad."

 panama.16.t: "Investments Accepted"
 panama.16.d: "Our investments have been accepted, and we now have funds to continue along with our plans!"
 panama.16.a: "Excellent!"

 panama.17.t: "Harmodio A. Madrid's Retirement"
 panama.17.d: "Harmodio Arias Madrid has been ill for some time, and he has deemed himself unable to hold office. He is therefore retiring permanently from politics and is appointing his brother Arnulfo as the head of the PNR. Arnulfo promises some reforms to the previous PNR doctrine, although it will follow the same basic teachings."
 panama.17.a: "Farewell, Harmodio."

 panama.18.t: "Removing Progressive Reforms"
 panama.18.d: "The Liberal government implemented several socialist reforms during their tenure, and we now have the task of removing them. Issue is, the people have become adjusted to their new reforms, and removing it could be problematic. As such, we have to choose between compromising and removing some of the reforms or removing all of them."
 panama.18.a: "Remove all reforms!"
 panama.18.b: "Remove only some reforms."

 panama.19.t: "Status of the Party"
 panama.19.d: "Many have suggested that we finally branch off of the liberal party. We have two choices to do so. We may either merge with the existing conservative party, or form a new party, which many have suggested we call the Partido Nacional Conservador, or the National Conservative Party."
 panama.19.a: "Merge with PC."
 panama.19.b: "Create PNC."

 panama.20.t: "Military Junta Established"
 panama.20.d: "A military government has officially been established in Panama. It turns out that even the most stable of Central American democracies fall to authoritarianism eventually."
 panama.20.a: "Stability, but at what cost?"

 panama.21.t: "The New Constitution"
 panama.21.d: "The military junta has been creating its own constitution for Panama. Much of it is agreed upon to be stereotypical for a military government, but there is one thing that very few agree about - elections. There are three schools of thought - we can choose to have rigged elections every four years, have no elections at all, or restore democracy with the military as a legitimate party serving the remainder of the incumbent term."
 panama.21.a: "Let us rig future elections."
 panama.21.b: "No elections!"
 panama.21.c: "Free elections!"

 panama.22.t: "[GetYear] Presidential Elections"
 panama.22.d: "It's April 20th, election day. Shops, schools, and businesses are closed as the whole populace waits for the election results. It is a particularly contested election this year, and could go any way."
 panama.22.a: "National Revolutionary Party Wins."
 panama.22.b: "National Liberal Party Wins."
 panama.22.c: "Conservatives Win."

 panama.23.t: "[GetYear] Presidential Election"
 panama.23.d: "It's April 20th, election day. Shops, schools, and businesses are closed as the whole populace waits for the election results. It is a particularly contested election this year thanks to the formation of the Coalition, and the election could go either way"
 panama.23.a: "The CPN wins."
 panama.23.b: "The coalition wins."

 panama.24.t: "Democratic Opposition Holds Meeting"
 panama.24.d: "The opposing democratic parties - the Liberals, Conservatives, and the PNR, are holding a meeting to discuss their response to the surge in popularity for our government."
 panama.24.a: "We shall keep an eye on them."

 panama.25.t: "Opposition Forms Coalition"
 panama.25.d: "The CPN's popularity among the people has forces the opposition to form a coalition of its own - the Constitutional Coalition. This could spell trouble for us in future elections, but their own lack of cohesion could be their undoing."
 panama.25.a: "Arnulfo Arias Madrid shall lead the coalition!"
 panama.25.b: "Ricardo Joaquín Alfaro Jované shall lead the coalition!"
 panama.25.c: "Juan Demostenes Arosemena shall lead the coalition!"

 panama.26.t: "What to Do with Land?"
 panama.26.d: "We have zoned out and begun clearing land for the creation of new farms and factories, but this leaves us with an important question. What do we do with the land? We could either choose to give the land to corporations and farmers, or choose to keep it for ourselves."
 panama.26.a: "State-owned."
 panama.26.b: "Private-owned."

 panama.27.t: "Land Clearing"
 panama.27.d: "As part of our ambitious modernisation project, we must clear some of the jungle in our nation. Our politicians, however, are debating on whether we should prioritise agriculture or industry. Industry would likely take more time, but would leave us more modernised, while farming has near-immediate bonuses and gives us more crops to export worldwide."
 panama.27.a: "Prioritise Industry."
 panama.27.b: "Prioritise Agriculture."

 panama.28.t: "The Union Compromise"
 panama.28.d: "So far, the coalition has been very successful in dealing with major political issues. Now, we face one of our largest, the status of trade unions. Overall, there are three reasonable ideas. We could either create government-owned trade unions, which allows us to have control over the unions while still protecting the workers, or we could allow unions with some safeguards in place to ensure stability, or we may simply leave them disallowed."
 panama.28.a: "Create government-owned unions."
 panama.28.b: "Allow unions."
 panama.28.c: "Ban unions."

 panama.29.t: "The Constitutional Coalition"
 panama.29.d: "So far, we have managed to hold the coalition together reasonably well, but with our victory over the CPN, bickering among the many factions has become common. It may be advantageous for us to split the coalition now that we have dethroned the military from our country. We may, however, never again have the opportunity to unify our politics under such a popular system, so it may also be worth it to stick with the coalition and hope it holds together."
 panama.29.a: "The coalition stays!"
 panama.29.b: "Dissolve the coalition!"
 panama.29.c: "Dissolve the coalition!"

 panama.30.t: "Panama Pressures Coto!"
 panama.30.d: "The Panamanians have launched a small-scale military assault on the Coto region, which they have claimed for a long time now. If we are not careful, this could escalate to a large-scale conflict. Fortunately, thanks to the Monroe Doctrine, the US will likely put an end to this rather quickly."
 panama.30.a: "Those Panamaniacs!"

 panama.31.t: "Panama Pressures Costa Rica"
 panama.31.d: "The Panamanians have begun a small-scale military assault on the Coto region of Costa Rica, which they have had a claim on for some time. We should threaten intervention to prevent this turning into a full-scale war."
 panama.31.a: "Let us intervene."

 panama.32.t: "The US Threatens Us!"
 panama.32.d: "The United States has decided to threaten us, and has ordered us to turn our troops back or to suffer the consequences. We are now forced to obey the order, as our military forces do not stand a chance against the might of the USA."
 panama.32.a: "Issue the retreat."

 panama.33.t: "The US Intervenes!"
 panama.33.d: "The US has intervened on our behalf, and is ordering Panama to restore the status quo. They would be fools not to comply."
 panama.33.a: "Let us hope this stability remains."

 panama.34.t: "The Coto Region"
 panama.34.d: "The Coto Region of Costa Rica has been legitimately claimed by us for many years now, and many in the newly elected government feel now may be the time to attempt to take it back."
 panama.34.a: "Perhaps it is time to pressure the region."

 panama.35.t: "Panama Requests Investments"
 panama.35.d: "Panamanian diplomats have come to us requesting investments, claiming that, after a short period in the red, we will profit greatly from investing."
 panama.35.a: "Okay, sure!"
 panama.35.b: "Sounds like a scam."

 panama.36.t: "Investments Allowed!"
 panama.36.d: "Businessmen have scrambled into our country, and are investing money into our own businesses. The economy is thriving, and hopefully both sides will profit greatly."
 panama.36.a: "Excellent!"

 panama.37.t: "Investments Denied"
 panama.37.d: "Sadly, our request for investments has been declined. Neither side will be profiting from the other any time soon."
 panama.37.a: "Unfortunate."

 panama.40.t: "Panama Backs Down"
 panama.40.d: "After hearing of American support for Costa Rica, and not willing to escalate the situation into a full-blown conflict, the forces of Panama have begun to back down across the region. This is a victory for American diplomacy abroad."
 panama.40.a: "The Monroe Doctrine stands."

 panama.99.t: "Panama Seizes Canal"
 panama.99.d: "Upon the start of the American Civil War, Panama took the 13-mile long Panama Canal Zone from the US, officially to 'safeguard it from radicalism'. This could be advantageous for us, as we could demand that Panama either joins the Entente or hands over the Canal, and they would not be in a good position to refuse."
 panama.99.c: "Leave them alone."
 panama.99.b: "Demand they join the Entente and redirect some trade to the Entente."
 panama.99.a: "Demand the canal and offer them protection."

 panama.100.t: "Panama Seizes Canal"
 panama.100.d: "Upon the start of the American Civil War, Panama took the 13-mile long Panama Canal Zone from the US, officially to 'safeguard it from radicalism'. Unfortunately, there really isn't much we can do about this for the time being, as we have a civil war to fight."
 panama.100.a: "Oh, well."

 panama.101.t: "Panama Agrees to Terms"
 panama.101.d: "Panama has agreed to our generous terms, and we now have the Panama Canal under our influence."
 panama.101.a: "Excellent."

 panama.102.t: "Panama Declines Terms"
 panama.102.d: "Despite our highly generous terms, Panama has declined our request to have the Panama Canal in our sphere of influence. We can either admit defeat or prepare an invasion."
 panama.102.a: "Onwards!"
 panama.102.b: "Do nothing."

 panama.103.t: "Calls for Peace"
 panama.103.d: "Throughout our country and Canada, the populace calls for an end to the war. We should take advantage of this and propose a peace to the Canadians."
 panama.103.a: "Send the proposal."

 panama.104.t: "Panama Proposes a Peace"
 panama.104.d: "Resounding calls for peace have surfaced in both our nations, and Panama has taken advantage of this to publicly propose peace. We can either accept a white peace or continue fighting to the bitter end."
 panama.104.a: "Let us lower our arms."
 panama.104.b: "Not until we are at Panama City!"

 panama.105.t: "Peace in Panama"
 panama.105.d: "Panama has triumphed over an invading foreign power! We have shown the world our might, protected our sovereignty, and kept the Panama Canal's profits!"
 panama.105.a: "Peace is soon at hand."

 panama.106.t: "Canada Stands Down"
 panama.106.d: "Canada has decided against any further action following our refusal of their demand."
 panama.106.a: "Lucky for them."

 panama.107.t: "Panama Renounces Monroe Doctrine"
 panama.107.d: "Panama has renounced the Monroe Doctrine, citing that, since all surrounding countries have done so, they should also do so to ensure their own safety."
 panama.107.a: "A shame."
