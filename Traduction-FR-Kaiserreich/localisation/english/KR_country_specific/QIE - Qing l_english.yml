 QIE_aisin_gioro_puyi: "Aisin-Gioro Puyi"
 QIE_aisin_gioro_puyi_leader_desc: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! February 7th, 1906, in Prince Chun Mansion, Beijing, Zhili Province, Qing Empire\n§YPolitical Career:§! 'His Imperial Majesty, the Son of Heaven, the Xuantong Emperor’ - while Puyi holds many titles, the young Emperor has little power and has never really possessed any since his birth in 1906. Deposed in the Xinhai Revolution at the age of 5, he was returned to the throne as a condition of the German intervention in China, a move detested by the general population. With day-to-day governance largely handled by the civil government in Beijing, he has spent the last decade idly sitting in the Forbidden City, occupying his days with tennis matches and calligraphy. But the Xuantong Emperor may secretly harbour ambitions to restore China and his dynasty to the greatness they enjoyed centuries ago..."
 QIE_aisin_gioro_puyi_manchu_leader_desc: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! February 7th, 1906, in Prince Chun Mansion, Beijing, Zhili Province, Qing Empire\n§YPolitical Career:§! Restored following what has now been deemed the Manchu Restoration, Aisin-Gioro Puyi now sits at the helm of a government scrubbed clean of warlord influences. While some observers feared a return to traditional courtly intrigues, the new Qing government has opted to present a much more modern outlook. Puyi still lacks much power, but this is of calculated design. Fearing a tyrannical descendant of the same type that doomed his predecessors, the Emperor and legal scholars have drafted a constitutional structure of monarchy where Puyi exercises spiritual and patriotic power while only having an advisory role in legislation and day-to-day governing. While this new structure of government is untested, many in China and around the world are hoping Puyi can exemplify what it means to be a modern monarch."
 QIE_aisin_gioro_puyi_yiguandao_leader_desc: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! February 7th, 1906, in Prince Chun Mansion, Beijing, Zhili Province, Qing Empire\n§YPolitical Career:§! While many around China and the world hoped that the so-called Manchu Restoration would restore some semblance of constitutional monarchy to China, the scheming machinations of Honoured Teacher Zhang Tianran have buried any and all aspirations for modern imperial rule. With religious devotees rapidly filling all governmental posts and seizing control of the military, Puyi has been pushed back into a position of irrelevance, now answering to the beck and call of a religious cult rather than a military clique. His role remains relatively unchanged from the days of Wu Peifu, only now with more obscure religious rituals and less military reviews. Puyi himself seems to not mind very much, having completely fallen under the sway of the teachings of Zhang and the Yiguandao."

 #吳佩孚
 QIE_wu_peifu: "Wu Peifu"
 QIE_wu_peifu_leader_desc: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! April 22nd, 1874, in Penglai, Shandong Province, Qing Empire\n§YPolitical Career:§! Narrowly escaping death at the hands of Puyi, Pujie, and the other Manchu noblemen who plotted to overthrow the Zhili Clique, Wu Peifu has now dropped any facade of Imperial rule over China. Naming himself ‘interim head of the nation’, he is now tasked with building a legitimate system of government for his country. A military man for his entire life, Wu is not expected to remain in power for long, and may soon transfer control of the country to a hand-picked successor."
 QIE_wu_peifu_commander_desc: "§YGeneral Description\nBorn:§! §gApril 22nd, 1874, in Penglai, Shandong Province, Qing Empire§!\n§YMilitary Career:§! §gBorn in Shandong to a merchant family, Wu entered the Baoding military academy and quickly rose through the ranks of the new Beiyang army. Following the collapse of the Republic of China in 1916 he aligned himself with Feng Guozhang’s Zhili Clique, and following Feng’s death in 1919 rose to dominate the clique. In 1928 he lead it to victory over its main rival, the Fengtian clique, despite being betrayed by his former ally Feng Yuxiang. During these turbulent years he was mentored by Cao Kun, former and future president of the National Assembly, who taught him the intriguing and scheming skills he used to seize control over the government. Although opposed to the reimposition of the Qing monarchy by Germany, Wu has quickly adapted the Zhili Clique to China’s new governmental structure, sidelining the monarchists and ensuring that he and his allies dominated nearly every facet of the state. A token opposition is allowed to exist, but Wu truly controls the government.§!\n\n§YNotes: Wu reportedly owns the world's largest diamond, but has refused to allow anyone to verify this claim. He was once renowned for hanging a photograph of George Washington behind his desk, but due to the ongoing political turmoil in the United States he has replaced this with a photograph of Bismarck. 'A great political thinker, just like Washington', Wu said to a visiting journalist, ignoring any questions about his relationship with Germany."

 QIE_hu_shih_leader_desc: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! December 17th, 1891, in Chuansha, Jiangsu Province, Qing Empire\n§YPolitical Career:§! A political philosopher and intellectual, Hu Shih may seem like an odd choice for first president of the ‘Beijing Government of the Republic of China’. Yet the political philosophy he developed, ‘pragmatism’, was deeply influential to Wu Peifu during the years immediately following the restoration of the Qing, and the two frequently met in Hu’s office at Peking University, discussing how both men, former republicans, could and should dedicate themselves to the imperial project as the ‘least bad’ option for China. But with the aristocracy's treachery revealed, Wu has selected Hu to lead the new government, hoping that the philosopher’s writings and public persona can lend an air of legitimacy to a government seen by most as a sham and a front for the Zhili Clique."

He has remained a close ally of Wu, and has spent most of the early 1930’s attempting to prepare the country against the threat of Japanese invasion, something he sees as an inevitability.§!\n\n§YNotes: Skilled military theorist, and has written several works on defensive strategy, though some have accused him of stealing ideas from his subordinates.§!"

 QIE_wang_huaiqing_commander_desc: "§YGeneral Description\nBorn:§! §g1875, in Ningjin, Zhili Province, Qing Empire§!\n§YMilitary Career:§! §gWhile Wang was born into an upper-middle class family of bureaucrats in 1875, his father’s alcoholism and gambling drove the family into poverty. Wang left his family and joined the military at a young age, helping suppress revolts in 1905 and becoming a confidante of Yuan Shikai. When Shikai’s restoration fell apart, Wang allied himself with the Zhili Clique, becoming a close confidante of Cao Kun and Wu Peifu. Though he nominally commands several divisions of troops under the Qing command structure, he essentially uses these armies as thuggish extortionists, demanding outrageous 'protection' fees from towns near his troops' garrisons.§!\n\n§YNotes: Known affectionately as the 'toilet general' by his troops. There are two theories for this unique moniker: The first is that he loves his own toilet so much he orders it to be carried with him on campaign at all times, where it served as a makeshift standard. In one story of dubious veracity, he launched an attack on a mountain fortification sitting atop his toilet, stamped with the Chinese character for 'Wang'. His troops faltered once the toilet vanished in the chaos of battle, but Wang and his men lifted the toilet aloft, rallying his troops and (supposedly) inspiring them to climb up a sheer cliff and seize the bastion. Furthermore, he apparently even uses a toilet in lieu of an office chair at his desk. The second (and more plausible) explanation for the nickname is that his troops are unwashed and smell like toilets, as Wang believes peasant soldiers taken right from the fields are more honest and loyal.§!"

The younger brother of the Guangxu Emperor, he was acquainted with a baby Puyi while he was a teenager. Rising through the ranks of the Manchu nobility due to his family ties, he was promoted to Inspector General in 1909 before embarking on a tour of the world in 1910, and attended the funeral of King George V in 1911. Appointed head of the Imperial Guard upon his return, Zaitao served until 1912, when Puyi was overthrown. Briefly restored to the position in 1917, he was immediately removed once Zhang Xun’s restoration attempt failed. He finally returned to the post in 1927 with the German re-imposition of Puyi to the throne. One of the founding members of the Zongshe Party, Zaitao is more open to reform than most older Manchu nobility, having travelled around the world extensively in his youth.

A well-known incident recounted how Puyi threw a tantrum when he saw that the inner lining of one of Pujie's coats was yellow, because yellow was traditionally a colour reserved only for the emperor. Following the Restoration in 1927, Pujie attended university in Berlin, where he was given the nickname 'Peter' by his classmates, as they found Pujie too difficult to pronounce. Despite growing up in the shadow of his brother, Pujie rarely envied the Emperor, who was confined to pointless ceremonial duties and lacked much of an education beyond court formalities. Pujie, on the other hand, was exposed to the latest Western science, education, and culture. Dismayed by the moral laxness he found in Germany that sprung up following the horrors of the Weltkrieg, he returned to China impressed by Western science and industry, but wary of the libertine culture flourishing in Berlin. Furthermore, he was dismayed at the level of German control over the country, and especially despised the Zhili Clique, whom he viewed as essentially holding his brother hostage. Largely resigned to a ceremonial position within the military, he plots to one day help his brother return to the rightful position on the throne, with him serving as a ‘guiding hand’, of course.§!\n\n§YNotes: He has not married, despite rampant suspicion that the Emperor is infertile.§!"

Interested in engineering as a child, Runqi entered adolescence as the German intervention in China reached its zenith. One of his most distinctive childhood memories was attending the wedding of his sister Wanrong to the exiled Emperor in the Tianjin concession at the age of 10. After the German intervention placed his brother-in-law back on the throne, Runqi learned German from the horde of businessmen and military attachés that descended on Beijing in the economic boom of the late 1920s and early 1930s. This culminated in him attending the Preußische Kriegsakademie in Berlin, where he picked up the German name ‘Ruprecht’. Returning to China in 1935 following a tour of Europe, Runqi developed a fascination with armoured warfare and mechanisation, inspired Heinz Guderian, an instructor at the Akademie. He is somewhat more sympathetic to the Germans than other Manchu nobles, but the decadence and moral laxness he observed in Berlin during the boom years of the late 1920s and early '30s prevented him from becoming a full Germanophile.§!\n\n§YNotes: In Berlin he became obsessed wih American cinema, and he introduced the genre to his brother-in-law, the Emperor, also a fan of cinema in general.

Du's exact role in the events of 1911 have been heavily disputed, with some claiming he was initially loyal to the Qing, and other accusing him of being a key figure in organising the Wuchang Uprising. The story as told by Du himself and his Zhili allies has been heavily revised to put him on the right side of history. From 1926 and forward he served as Wu Peifu's handpicked governor of Hubei Province, initially struggling to oppose the Kuomintang's invasion of Zhili controlled territory during the Northern Expedition. After the Zhili Clique managed to turn the tide of the war, Du assumed full control of Hubei, managing to stabilising the war torn province into a loyal stronghold of Zhili influence. His ties to Japan kept him from being promoted too highly within the Zhili command structure, but following the reforms enacted by Wu in the wake of the LEP collapse he has been promoted to the high command."

After studying infantry for three years, he graduated with the highest score in his class and became a junior commander of the Yi Army. In 1914, Yu became an officer of the garrison in Rehe and in 1917, when the 18th Mixed Brigade was established, Yu's cousin, Zhao Ronghua, commander of the brigade, who was raised by Yu's father, invited Yu to serve under him.\n\nIn the Zhili-Anhui War of 1920, under the command of Zhao, Yu defeated Wu Guangxin's force with the aid of Lu Jinshan's force. In 1922, Xiong Kewu attempted to expel Yang Sen in Sichuan and besieged Yichang in Hubei, while Zhao and Lu intended to abandon the line as they were outnumbered, Yu Xuezhong held until Zhili reinforcements arrived, he thus received much recognition from Wu Peifu and became a regimental commander. In the following two years, Yu fought in Sichuan to aid Yang Sen in consolidating his rule. By 1924, Yu held the rank of major general and was appointed as the commander of his brigade after Zhao was fired for poor performance.

 QIE_yearofrat_desc: "As the nation prepares to begin celebrating Chinese New Year on January 24th, Assembly President Cao Kun and Wu Peifu have begun drafting a speech to mark the fourth year of concerted anti-trade debt efforts. The largest issue currently facing the central government, the Zhili Clique hopes to tackle this problem even as whispers of unrest emerge from the League of Eight Provinces."

 QIE_taxes1: "New Taxes"
 QIE_taxes1_desc: "Tax collection in the warlord era ranged from semi-organised to completely ad-hoc. Even though most people will resent the new taxes, enacting them through an established legislative body will hopefully mitigate some the unpopularity, as a tax-man is better than a horde of rapacious soldiers."

 QIE_subsistancefarming1: "Encourage Export Farming"
 QIE_subsistancefarming1_desc: "We do not have the industrial base required to enact large-scale industrial reform. What we do not lack, however, is a large number of peasant farmers. By carefully granting out subsidies to farmers, we can start to nurture a food-export system that can alleviate our trade debt."

 QIE_emergencysession: "Emergency Meeting of Senior Zhili Members"
 QIE_emergencysession_desc: "The unrest in the south has exploded into full-blown chaos. Rioting and looting are widespread, and civil authority has broken down. Wu Peifu must call a meeting of the senior Zhili generals and bureaucrats, in order to properly respond to this developing situation."

 QIE_capitalize_politics: "New Elections"

 QIE_meetwithassembly: "Meet with Assembly Parties"
 QIE_meetwithassembly_desc: "The dissent generated by our decision to remain loyal to the Germans has not reached down to the lower classes yet. By meeting with leaders from the major parties in the Assembly, we can placate them and ensure that they at least pretend to support our regime."

 QIE_futureofzhili: "Future of the Zhili Clique"
 QIE_futureofzhili_desc: "The upheaval of the last few months has shown that the Zhili Clique must reform itself if it is to survive the next few years, let alone the next few decades. We need to create a (reasonably) meritocratic promotion system in our military, and eliminate some of the most egregious corruption from our government, or we too will fade into obscurity."

 QIE_default_debt: "Default on Debt"
 QIE_default_debt_desc: "All other options have failed. The withdraw of German financial support means a full-scale international default on our debt is the only option to solve our financial crisis. It will certainly harm us in the short-term, but with any luck this will pay off in the long term."

 QIE_nationalize_germans: "Nationalise German Industry"
 QIE_nationalize_germans_desc: "A great deal of companies were wholly or partly owned by German financial concerns prior to their withdrawal of financial support for our regime. We can move in and nationalise these industries, helping our domestic production. Germany, crippled by Black Monday, cannot retaliate beyond some angry telegrams."

 QIE_locallogistics: "Local Logistics"
 QIE_locallogistics_desc: "Germany had promised to supply us with trucks and other logistical equipment for our future conflict with Japan. With their military mission's withdrawal, however, we need to turn to more traditional logistical methods to supply our army. In the end, this might be good news for us, as the infrastructure of our country cannot really support large amounts of motorised vehicles anyway."

 QIE_buyforeignguns: "Purchase Foreign Arms"
 QIE_buyforeignguns_desc: "Our anti-concession stance prevents us from dealing with the countries that have carved out pieces of our nation, but there are many countries in the world that have more or less respected our territorial integrity. Scandinavia, Bohemia, and others have military equipment that could be useful to our nation."

 QIE_siciliyships: "Commission Ships from Sicily"
 QIE_siciliyships_desc: "Although the Kingdom of Italy participated in the suppression of the Boxer movement, the Two Sicilies did not, and their dockyards are some of the largest in the world. Our navy will never be able to stand up to Japan's in a head-to-head showdown, but escorts for coastal defence and submarines for light raiding could help us in our upcoming conflicts."

 QIE_stealplanedesigns: "'Acquire' Foreign Airplane Designs"
 QIE_stealplanedesigns_desc: "We lack designs for domestic aircraft production, and promises of German designs never came to fruition for obvious reasons. Some of the more salacious Zhili generals have suggested sending infiltrators to the airfields of the Legation Cities with the hopes of finding schematics in the repair hangers there. It's an audacious plan, but we don't have many other options."

 QIE_expatairtraining_desc: "While a fledgling domestic air training industry exists, it may be more prudent to hire some of the various exiles and expatriates that wash up in the Legations to train our pilots. They may need to sober up before teaching any of our cadets to fly, but crashing is part of the training process too, right?"

 QIE_supportcompanies: "Develop Zhili Engineer Corps"
 QIE_supportcompanies_desc: "China's rugged terrain necessitates any military force having a strong engineering corps to support it. Unfortunately, the ad-hoc and amateur quality of many of our divisions prevents engineering support from being truly effective. We must develop our own military engineering schools, in order to ensure our troops have adequate support."

 QIE_reorganise_divisions: "Re-Organise Warlord Divisions"
 QIE_reorganise_divisions_desc: "Any warlord worth anything has his own personal militia to control the territory he rules. Unfortunately, these troops vary wildly in quality from semi-professional troops to mobs more used to robbing and burning the villages they theoretically protect. By devoting considerable resources to standardising and modernising these divisions, we can turn them into valuable assets on the battlefield."

 QIE_zhili_flood_dams: "Prepare to Breach Dams"
 QIE_zhili_flood_dams_desc: "A shocking plan has been developed by senior Zhili strategists - the breaching of major dams along the Yellow River. This would cause widespread flooding, and halt any enemy advances. The civilian casualties and economic cost, however, would be immense."

 QIE_studywars: "Old Methods, New Designs"
 QIE_studywars_desc: "While generals in Europe experiment with 'armoured warfare' and other cutting-edge ideas, our strategists have learned one lesson from the last decade of internecine warfare - artillery is king. By modernising our artillery stockpiles, we can ensure they go into battle with the best fire support available."

 QIE_work_with_manchu: "Work with Manchu Generals"
 QIE_work_with_manchu_desc: "While some of the younger Manchu generals are little more than jumped-up noblemen, the old guard like Aisin-Gioro Zaito can impart valuable lessons on cavalry tactics to the Zhili. At the same time, Zhili generals can teach these new noble officers the skills they learned over the last few decades of strife and warfare."

 QIE_expand_peking_uni: "Expand Peking University"
 QIE_expand_peking_uni_desc: "Peking (Beijing) University has a large focus on literature, art, and culture. While important, these things do not win wars. We can divert funding to Peking University with the purpose of building new research and development labs for computer, radio, and chemical advancement, all of which will help our military."

 QIE_zhili_mercs: "Hire Foreign Advisors"
 QIE_zhili_mercs_desc: "Our anti-concession stance keeps us from taking military aid from most European governments, but individual, independent advisors are fair game. The turmoil and conflict of the last twenty years has generated no shortage of men willing to sell their talents and advice to the highest bidder."

 QIE_jiangbailiplan: "Jiang Baili's Plan"
 QIE_jiangbailiplan_desc: "General Jiang Baili's plan is focused on static fortifications, defensive tactics, and preparing for Japanese naval invasions at the coast. While some have criticised him for stealing ideas from his subordinates, this is still a solid plan to defend our country."

 QIE_hubeigenerals: "Court Hubei Generals"
 QIE_hubeigenerals_desc: "The 'Hubei Generals' are an informal association of the leading manufacturers and industrialists in Hubei Province. Jiang Baili's close family friend, General Xiao Yaonan, is governor of the province, and has graciously volunteered to use his industrial contacts for the construction of many of the fortifications required for Jiang's plan."

 QIE_gongxianarsenal: "Expand Gongxian Arsenal"
 QIE_gongxianarsenal_desc: "The Gongxian Arsenal has normally played second fiddle to the much larger Hanyang weapons foundry. By expanding its manufacturing capabilities, we can sufficiently spread out our industrial base in case one arsenal falls into the hands of invaders."

 QIE_modern_contracts: "Modernise Armament Contracts"
 QIE_modern_contracts_desc: "Previously, contracts for the production of weapons were handed out on an ad-hoc basis, rife with corruption. By exerting considerable political willpower, we can modernise and clean up these systems, bringing our arms industry up to western standards."

 QIE_jinghanRR: "Improve the Jinghan Railroad"
 QIE_jinghanRR_desc: "The Jinghan Railway links all the major industrial and agricultural heartlands of our state. We should upgrade its capacity, in order to more efficiently move soldiers and war matériel."

 QIE_liumenggengplan: "Liu Menggeng's Plan"
 QIE_liumenggengplan_desc: "General Liu Menggeng's plan focuses on improving logistics and support networks for our troops, so they can be better able to fight. The trade off for this, however, is less industrial capacity dedicated to building defensive fortifications."

 QIE_expandmines: "Reorganise the Kailuan Mining Bureau"
 QIE_expandmines_desc: "The Kailuan Mining Bureau was founded in 1878 as a joint venture between the Qing government and a variety of British business interests. Largely destroyed during the fighting of the warlord era, we must rebuild and reorganise the mines to fuel our war efforts."

 QIE_devscheme: "Daye-Hanyang Development Scheme"
 QIE_devscheme_desc: "The Daye-Hanyang corridor houses the majority of our industrial capacity outside of Beijing, yet the infrastructure and urban planning in the region leaves much to be desired. By investing into clearing new land for factories, and building additional civilian industry to support military arsenals, we can modernise the region."

 QIE_shanxicoal: "Expand Shanxi Coal Fields"
 QIE_shanxicoal_desc: "Seized from Yan Xishan at the end of the last Zhifeng war, the coal fields of eastern Shanxi are some of the most prosperous in China. We should invest in these coal fields, in order to fuel our growing industry. This may provoke Yan though, so we must tread with caution."

 QIE_baodingarsenal: "Expand Baoding Arsenal"
 QIE_baodingarsenal_desc: "The Baoding Arsenal, attached to the military academy, is somewhat less developed than the Gongxian foundry. Yet with enough investments, we can turn it into one of China's main military manufacturers. Its proximity to the Academy is also a plus, as it allows us to test new equipment designs both practically and theoretically."

 QIE_restore_order_in_china: "Restore Order in China"
 QIE_restore_order_in_china_desc: "For far too long, China has been bitterly divided by ambitious strongmen and rebellious regional factions. In our weakness, predators of all stripes have come to exploit our land and corrupt our people. The next step in ending the Century of Humiliations is to end the Warlord Era. We must bring the various warlords to heel, reigning those who exploited the collapse of the League for seditious ends."

 QIE_destroy_federalists: "Destroy the Federalists"
 QIE_destroy_federalists_desc: "The Federalist movement, an outgrowth of regionalist generals and propped up by naive intellectuals is nothing more than a farce for further warlordism. Although we were forced to stomach Chen Jiongming's restoration as governor in 1927, he and his allies have since defied us. The division and corruption must end before it can consume further parts of the country and we will restore central authority."

 QIE_cross_the_dai_river: "Cross the Dai River"
 QIE_cross_the_dai_river_desc: "Many years have passed since the setback we experienced in the 4th Zhifeng War, and yet since then the threat of war from the northeast has grown only more dire. Zhang Zuolin sold both his soul and our country when he made his deal with Japan - a 5th Zhifeng is what we need to set this great wrong right. The Zhili will secure the northeast; this is the culmination of all our work and struggles up to this point, and the opportunity may not come again!"

 QIE_destroy_kuomintang: "The Kuomintang Menace"
 QIE_destroy_kuomintang_desc: "The Kuomintang, founded by an embittered Dr. Sun Yat-sen, is nothing more than a shambolic remnant - an excuse for socialist bandits and warlord criminals to loot and plunder in a ceaseless cycle of revolutionary violence. Despite their defeat in the Northern Expedition, many remain. A decisive strike to the south shall drive out these hooligans, ending this rebel bastion once and for all."

 QIE_endconcessions: "Eradicate the Concessions"
 QIE_endconcessions_desc: "The concessions, long a stain on Chinese sovereignty, have remained in existence for too long! Macau, the Legation Cities, and the remnants of German colonialism must be brought under our direct control, either through negotiation or direct action!"

 QIE_salvage_german_industry: "Salvage German Designs"
 QIE_salvage_german_industry_desc: "In their haste to flee back to their concessions, the Peking-Kommission and German investors left large amounts of industrial machinery behind. We should salvage these designs, and attempt to retro-engineer them for our own purposes."

 QIE_leverage_new_pop: "Attract Anti-Concession Intellectuals"

 QIE_open_up_to_investment: "Simplify International Investment Laws"
 QIE_open_up_to_investment_desc: "Despite German influence, our international investment laws remain a byzantine web of red tape, restrictions, and loopholes. By simplifying these laws, we can attract additional international investment to build up our industry and military."

 QIE_harmonious_balance: "Harmonious Balance"
 QIE_harmonious_balance_desc: "Few thought it possible, but we have managed to build a delicate balance between intellectuals, Manchu nobles, the Zhili Clique, and the Emperor himself. The common person now regards our government as a legitimate entity, and is willing to support it, at least most of the time."

 QIE_baoding_zhili_cooperation: "Encourage Baoding-Zhili Cooperation"
 QIE_baoding_zhili_cooperation_desc: "The cadets at the Boading Military Academy, most of which joined the YCP, long resented the continued influence of Germany and other foreign powers over our government. With our new anti-concession stance, however, they have started to support our regime. By drawing them into the Zhili command structure, we can ensure their loyalty for years to come."

 QIE_guardian_of_emperor: "Spread Pro-Imperial Propaganda"
 QIE_guardian_of_emperor_desc: "Many in the Zongshe Party have long accused the Zhili Clique of sidelining Puyi. By spreading propaganda promoting the Emperor to our troops, however, we can both increase their fervour to fight and placate the royalist nobles."

 QIE_lesson_of_intervention: "Lessons of the Intervention"
 QIE_lesson_of_intervention_desc: "The intervention in the League collapse has taught us many valuable lessons about modern warfare. We should put these to use before we deal with any larger conflicts."

 QIE_lesson_of_coup: "Lessons of the Coup Attempt"
 QIE_lesson_of_coup_desc: "The traitorous Zongshe attempt to overthrow the Zhili Clique has failed, but it revealed worrying problems with our internal security systems. We must rebuild our domestic intelligence apparatus, and ensure it can prevent future insurrections."

 QIE_placateassembly: "Placate the Assembly"
 QIE_placateassembly_desc: "Our decisions to deepen ties with Germany generated some unrest, but more importantly it drove a wedge between us and the opposition in the National Assembly. They have no real power, but having a loud opposition certainly won't help us in the long run. We need to placate these groups through whatever means necessary to ensure their loyalty."

 QIE_future_relationship: "Future Relationships"
 QIE_future_relationship_desc: "The defeat of Japan and the Fengtian Government raises new questions for us on the international stage. Should we draw closer to Germany, or instead turn inwards and focus on developing our nation?"

 QIE_request_german_bailout: "Request German Bailout"
 QIE_request_german_bailout_desc: "Our continued international trade debt continues to prevent us from making any meaningful industrial progress as a nation. While it may enrage die-hard nationalists, asking Germany for an international bailout will solve the problem of our debt and allow us to modernise."

 QIE_germanarsenal: "The Eagle and the Dragon"
 QIE_germanarsenal_desc: "German weapons and technology has its own set of benefits, despite the drawbacks associated with closer ties to Germany. Panzers, aircraft and more lie at our disposal, provided we are able to give concessions to the Peking-Kommission, of course."

 QIE_germandesigns: "Purchase German Production Licences"
 QIE_germandesigns_desc: "German weapon designs won them the Weltkrieg, and we have a long history of using German designs in domestic Chinese arsenals. We should try and purchase licences to build the newest German designs and give us an edge on our enemies."

 QIE_germanradio: "Study German Support Company Doctrine"
 QIE_germanradio_desc: "German divisions are innovative in incorporating the newest radios, engineering equipment and other support equipment. We should study their doctrine and seek to emulate it with our own military units."

 QIE_kriegsmarine: "Purchase Surplus German Ships"
 QIE_kriegsmarine_desc: "The German navy underwent a rapid expansion and modernisation programme after the Weltkrieg, and a huge number of German ships currently sit in mothball doing nothing. We should reach out to Germany and inquire about purchasing these old ships for our own use."

 QIE_luftwaffe: "License Luftstreitkräfte Airplanes"
 QIE_luftwaffe_desc: "While they might be hesitant to sell us their newest designs, Germany needs to keep Japan at bay. What better way of doing that then giving some of their planes to us?"

 QIE_motorized_armor: "Import Panzers and Trucks"
 QIE_motorized_armor_desc: "German Panzers and trucks are some of the most feared fighting machines in the world, and some of our younger officers are enthusiastic about their combat potential. We should see about licensing some from German factories and using them in our battles against the Japanese."

 QIE_buymauser: "Import German Small Arms"
 QIE_buymauser_desc: "German small arms designs are some of the most cutting-edge in the world. We should seek to directly import some to better equip our soldiers."

 QIE_germanattache: "German Attaché"
 QIE_germanattache_desc: "While German weapons are welcome, what we really need are German soldiers to help train our troops. The Peking-Kommission has just informed us that a crack group of elite German soldiers can be dispatched from Berlin, as soon as we divert some funding their way."

 QIE_seek_german_civ_investments: "Partner with German Manufacturing Firms"
 QIE_seek_german_civ_investments_desc: "German businesses frequently run into issues like unions and worker's rights at home. We can offer them land to build factories here and provide a workforce that will have no such complaints."

 QIE_grant_foreign_licenses: "Purchase German Tooling Equipment"
 QIE_grant_foreign_licenses_desc: "While we can build our own factories easily, what we really need is high-quality German tooling equipment. If acquired in enough numbers, we can jump-start our industry and allow it to quickly rise to a Western level."

 QIE_seek_german_RR_capital: "Hire German Rail Engineers"
 QIE_seek_german_RR_capital_desc: "Much of our rail network was constructed by European firms. While some might bristle at continuing to use them to build our railroads, they are the undisputed masters of the craft. We should seek out German railroad engineers and directly hire them to improve our infrastructure."

 QIE_import_krupp_steel: "Import Krupp Steel"
 QIE_import_krupp_steel_desc: "While most domestically produced steel is lacking in quality, Krupp is the international byword for quality. We should import large amounts of it to build our industrial network instead of relying on lower-quality domestic material."

 QIE_siemens: "Purchase Siemens Radios"
 QIE_siemens_desc: "Radios are a godsend in an enormous country like China, and ensuring our troops can coordinate their battle tactics is key. Siemens is the German king of radios, and we should import some to equip our troops."

 QIE_IGfarben: "Procure BASF Synthetic Formulas"
 QIE_IGfarben_desc: "China lacks much oil and rubber production, but with new German chemical formulas we can synthetically produce some."

 QIE_germanresearch: "University Exchange Programme"
 QIE_germanresearch_desc: "The best way to learn is to experience other cultures. By sending some Chinese students to German universities, they can return home with the latest knowledge and information. One hopes the Germans students who study here will learn something of our culture, and take it home to share with their countrymen."

 QIE_debt_issue: "Solving the Debt Issue"
 QIE_debt_issue_desc: "The debt issue that plagued the empire still plagues our new republic. While we could ask Germany for help, that would most likely cause our already unstable regime to collapse under public pressure. Instead, let's default and take an anti-concession stance, providing our government with legitimacy. It's not like the Germans ever liked us much beyond Puyi..."

 QIE_restoration: "The Manchu Restoration"
 QIE_restoration_desc: "In an almost unthinkable turn of events, strategic blunders made by Cao Kun and Wu Peifu have destroyed their own regime, with some of their former allies betraying them alongside the Qing aristocracy. The future of the new regime is uncertain, to say the least..."

 QIE_wu_constitution: "A New Constitution"
 QIE_wu_constitution_desc: "With the Qing dynasty overthrown, we must now set about building a new constitution for our regime. While it will still be 'guided' by the Zhili, many are hopeful for the return of republican rule to Beijing."

 QIE_unrest: "Deal with Unrest"
 QIE_unrest_desc: "Our decision to stay neutral in the League collapse has pleased nobody and angered everyone. We need to quickly suppress unrest before the situation becomes untenable."

 QIE_president_hu: "Implement President Hu's Reforms"
 QIE_president_hu_desc: "President Hu is a world-renowned political philosopher, and his writings have inspired many. We should work to implement some of his more practical thoughts, in order to better bolster the functioning of our new government."

 QIE_president_koo: "Implement President Koo's Reforms"
 QIE_president_koo_desc: "President Koo is a grey eminence, one of the world's most paramount diplomatic minds. We should put his expertise to work building international legitimacy for our regime and seeking new trade deals."

 QIE_pragmatism: "Pragmatism"
 QIE_pragmatism_desc: "Pragmatism, the philosophy espoused by Hu Shih, encourages cooperation with potentially unsavoury elements of the political environment in order to bring about the most productive changes. We should apply this theory to the workings of our government to better legitimise the 'warlord' elements of our government."

 QIE_hu_reconstructing_china: "Relief of Abuse"
 QIE_hu_reconstructing_china_desc: "Ever since the Wuchang Uprising, many men of prominence have come forth promising a glorious future for China. They spoke of grandeur and industrialisation, yet only a few had ever substantiated their plans. We are, however, under no illusions about the feasibility of those schemes. To ever have a chance at initiating such dreams, we must first relieve existing abuses in the system and improve the people’s material conditions."

 QIE_diplomacy: "Diplomatic Genius"
 QIE_diplomacy_desc: "Wellington Koo served our nation as ambassador to both the United States and the Copenhagen Conference. We should ensure his diplomatic ideals are transferred down to a new foreign service that can create international trade deals with the nations of the world."

 QIE_eradicate_manchu: "Eradicate Manchu Loyalist Remnants"
 QIE_eradicate_manchu_desc: "The Manchu nobility and their followers have wormed their way onto every corner of our society. Even after the fall of their make-believe Emperor and royal court, their influence can still be felt through many Manchu economic holdings and certain sympathisers within the bureaucracy. Weeding out these destabilising feudal elements is a must before we can proceed to consolidate China as a modern Republican nation-state."

 QIE_elimiate_baoding: "Destroy Baoding Cliques"
 QIE_elimiate_baoding_desc: "The treacherous Baoding cadets that planned the failed coup attempt must be suppressed through any means necessary, in order to safeguard the future of our young republic."

 QIE_deligitimize_oppo: "Delegitimise Opposition Parties"
 QIE_deligitimize_oppo_desc: "While the Assembly was a powerless body, it still forced us to pay lip service to the whims of nobles and out of touch urban elites. We should de-legitimise these aristocratic groups, and instead focus on the true needs of the people of our great republic."

 QIE_placate_intellectuals: "Placate Intellectuals"
 QIE_placate_intellectuals_desc: "The NCERA holds a great degree of popularity among the intellectuals of Beijing. With our new anti-concession stance, however, we can try and integrate them into the republican government, unifying them behind our new ideology."

 QIE_rebuild_arsenals: "Rebuild Arsenals"
 QIE_rebuild_arsenals_desc: "Fighting outside the Baoding Military Academy in the wake of the coup attempt left the arsenal damaged. We should rip out the destroyed parts of the foundry and put in new machinery instead, upgrading our production capacity."

 QIE_rebuild_domestic_ind: "Rebuild Civilian Industry"
 QIE_rebuild_domestic_ind_desc: "The riots and violence that engulfed Beijing destroyed large parts of the city, including some industry. We should clear the rubble and build larger, more advanced factories on top of the ruins."

 QIE_stable_republic: "The Republic Triumphant"
 QIE_stable_republic_desc: "The Zhili Clique has repeated its triumph of 1927, defeating all other 'republican' governments in China. Without Germany to impose a puppet emperor on us, we can truly begin to foster democracy in China. Long live the Republic!"

 QIE_purge_zhili: "Secure the North China Plain"
 QIE_purge_zhili_desc: "While the forces loyal to the coup control Beijing and the areas surrounding the Baoding Military Academy, the rest of our territory remains under the control of traitorous Zhili warlords. We need to first secure the northern frontier, eliminating the Zhili garrisons there before turning our eyes south."

 QIE_coup_backer: "Our New Benefactor"
 QIE_coup_backer_desc: "The coup that destroyed the Zhili Clique was not accomplished alone. Like it or not, in order to reclaim our country from the despotic warlords we had to cut a deal with local powers in the region. Now we must invite them to Beijing and see what they want in exchange for their support."

 QIE_zhang_tianran_backer: "Zhang Tianran"
 QIE_zhang_tianran_backer_desc: "The Honoured Master of the Yiguandao sect, Zhang Tianran commands an enormous amount of clout among the followers of his religion. His desired position in our government is unclear, but it appears that he is willing to lend us the support of the Yiguandao in return for unknown concessions..."

 QIE_qu_yingguang_backer: "Qu Yingguang"
 QIE_qu_yingguang_backer_desc: "The governor of Shandong, Qu Yingguang has long been a respectful religious man. While he wants to see the monarchy modernised, he also emphasises tradition and maintaining continuity with our past."

 QIE_yan_xishan_backer: "Yan Xishan"
 QIE_yan_xishan_backer_desc: "Governor Yan Xishan was an unexpected ally in our coup. Previously an anti-monarchist, his shrewd political mind realised that the Emperor is now a powerful political tool. He primarily desires to work with the existing establishment parties in modernising China and spreading his personalised ideology - a nebulous political philosophy that encompasses traditionalism, liberalism, nationalism, and syndicalism."

 QIE_yiguandao: "Invite Yiguandao Influences"
 QIE_yiguandao_desc: "With his new position in our government, Zhang Tianran has begun to expand the Yiguandao's power and influence within our country. While this has bolstered our legitimacy and popularity among followers of the faith, it is not clear who they are more loyal to - our government or Zhang's faith."

 QIE_gather_dynasties: "Gather the Dynasties"
 QIE_gather_dynasties_desc: "A major part of our benefactor's reform plans involve gathering the former ruling dynasties of China together to legitimise Puyi's rule. He has begun to send out invitations, and over the next few weeks the royals will arrive in Beijing."

 QIE_ceremonial_rites: "Restore the Ceremonial Rites"
 QIE_ceremonial_rites_desc: "During the Zhili regime, the Emperor's ceremonial rituals were largely sidelined and ignored. Court officials have proposed reintroducing these rites to the forefront of the Imperial Government, instilling patriotic fervour in the population."

 QIE_bolster_legitimacy: "Bolster Imperial Government"
 QIE_bolster_legitimacy_desc: "During the decade-long Zhili regime few thought the Emperor was any more than a puppet locked away in the Forbidden City. Now, however, with the backing of a new constitutional system and the Yiguandao faith, people are starting to see the Emperor as an important figure unifying the government in it's struggle to restore order."

 QIE_legitimate_emperor: "The Legitimate Emperor"
 QIE_legitimate_emperor_desc: "Our efforts have been successful. Puyi is now regarded as the legitimate ruler of China by every peasant and farmer! Zhang Tianran, having consolidated power in Shandong, has declared the province is to be fully integrated into our nation."

 QIE_modernize_monarchy: "Modernise the Monarchy"
 QIE_modernize_monarchy_desc: "While the Governor of Shandong is a Qing loyalist, he also realises the position of the Emperor needs to change to suit modern notions of government. He plans to push the Emperor to act more like a Western-style constitutional monarch, serving as an apolitical uniting figure and potential mediator in case of severe conflict."

 QIE_reinforce_confucianism: "The Emperor and People in One Body"
 QIE_reinforce_confucianism_desc: "Before the Wuchang Uprising, our predecessors had sought to elevate Confucius from a preacher of ancient wisdom to a new symbol of the Chinese nation-state. This new state cult was to help weave Confucius into a national narrative, where the venerated sage would epitomise the nation's cultural essence and Chineseness in general. Reinstitutionalising the state cult of Confucius in education, as well as cultural rites will aid us in creating a harmonious and enlightened Empire."

 QIE_revise_the_chinese_tripitaka: "Revise The Chinese Tripitaka"
 QIE_revise_the_chinese_tripitaka_desc: "The Chinese Buddhist canon has long been subject to debate but under Master Qu’s leadership we will create a revised “Tripitaka”, or collection of texts, that emphasises the conservative and esoteric elements of the “Red Hat Sects”, especially the Kagyu School, as a political cornerstone of our new government. We will then promote these ideals both to our government officials, as well as to the Emperor himself, who has proven amenable to Red Hat teachings."

 QIE_move_industry: "Move Industry to the Interior"
 QIE_move_industry_desc: "With the threat of foreign invasion looming, our new benefactor has offered to use some of their soldiers to help move industry near the coasts inland. In the event of foreign naval invasion, this will ensure we are still able to supply our troops."

 QIE_train_civil_servants: "Train Civil Servants"
 QIE_train_civil_servants_desc: "The Zhili bureaucracy relied on nepotism, cronyism and endemic, widespread corruption. This left the civil administration of China sorely lacking, with most positions filled by unqualified individuals. Governor Qu has proposed implementing a modernised version of the old civil service exams, to ensure that these positions are filled with qualified men."

 QIE_imperial_academy: "Found the Academy of Cultural Research"
 QIE_imperial_academy_desc: "Following decades of decline and devastation our very culture has started to wane from the constant erosion of state authority and western values. Our benefactor has finally seen fit to reverse these trends and unite the intellectual class behind the throne with the founding of a new cultural centre of research purpose-built to transform foreign ideas into more amenable and familiar ones for the future of the empire."

 QIE_lessons_of_model_province: "Lessons from the Model Province"
 QIE_lessons_of_model_province_desc: "The lessons learned by Yan Xishan and his men during his decades long tenure as Governor of Shanxi will be a crucial guide for the years to come in China. Shanxi's crowning achievements in Education, Agriculture, and Industrial development have achieved international renown despite Shanxi's material poverty. With the full resources of the Empire behind him, Yan intends to transform China for the better."

 QIE_chinese_bismarck: "The Chinese Bismarck"
 QIE_chinese_bismarck_desc: "\"The three great duties of the people are to serve in the army, to pay taxes, and to receive education\".\n\nA great admirer of the Prussian system, the German victory in the Weltkrieg has entrenched Yan's desire to introduce a military spirit to the land, urging parents to give their children toy weapons and forming a \"Blood and Iron Society\". China will be unified, by force if necessary."

 QIE_replace_corrupt_govs: "Replace Corrupt Governors"
 QIE_replace_corrupt_govs_desc: "Following the success of the coup many in the Assembly have begun expressing disgust with many of the former mid-level Zhili administrators we left in positions of authority in the wake of the civil war. Outspoken members of the [QIE.GetRulingParty] have proposed firing all of these men, and replacing them with more qualified and loyal candidates."

 QIE_nationalize_yan_thot: "Nationalising the Words of Yan Xishan"
 QIE_nationalize_yan_thot_desc: "Since his ascension to the Shanxi governorship, Yan has devoted enormous amounts of time to developing his personal ideology, an eclectic mix of federalism, Confucianism, Christianity, and even syndicalism. With his new position of national power, Yan has started to spread his ideas throughout China."

 QIE_vigor_modernization: "Vigorous Modernisation"
 QIE_vigor_modernization_desc: "Yan Xishan has long been a proponent of industrial modernisation, turning the backwater province of Shanxi into a small yet vibrant hub of mining and industry. Now with a position of national prominence, he has begun to urge those lessons of modernisation and industrialisation be applied at a national level."

 QIE_prepare_for_storm: "Prepare for the Storm"
 QIE_prepare_for_storm_desc: "Though we were initially sceptical of their influence, our benefactor has brought us an enormous number of benefits over the last few months. With his help, we are now more than ready to stand up to whatever threatens us."

 QIE_form_emergency_govt: "Form an Emergency Government"
 QIE_form_emergency_govt_desc: "Now that we have destroyed the remnants of the Zhili Clique, it is time for the Emperor to pick which of the three parties that formed the coalition will rule China."

 QIE_pick_NCERA: "Utilise the NCERA"
 QIE_pick_NCERA_desc: "The New Chinese Empire Reform Association, or NCERA for short, is a powerful party that controls the loyalty of both rural peasants and some urban intellectuals. Though less focused on industrial modernisation, their emphasis on helping the great mass of the population make them extremely popular."

 QIE_pick_YCP: "Utilise the YCP"
 QIE_pick_YCP_desc: "The Young China Party, or YCP, is made up of young Baoding Academy cadets, with some urban intellectuals providing the funding and organisation. Focused on centralising the country and urbanisation, they lack the broad popular appeal of the NCERA - though their modernising focus makes them a good choice for quick development."

 QIE_pick_MP: "Utilise the Zongshe"
 QIE_pick_MP_desc: "The Zongshe Party is, obviously, dominated by the Manchu nobility in Beijing. While this may appear an odd choice for a ruling party, over the last ten years the nobles used the relative freedom afforded to them by the Zhili to build up large industrial fortunes, investing in the few factories in Beijing not owned by German firms, giving them significant clout."

 QIE_rural_reform: "Institutionalise the Rural Reform Movement"
 QIE_rural_reform_desc: "The chaos and destruction of the Warlord Era left large swaths of rural China devastated and destroyed. The Rural Reconstruction Movement, half of the NCERA, has attempted to fix these problems independent of government support for the last few years. With proper funding, however, they can make a real difference in rebuilding China."

 QIE_ncera_industry: "Invest in Rural Industry"
 QIE_ncera_industry_desc: "While the little industry China has is currently concentrated in its cities, they are vulnerable to military attack and unrest. Instead, the NCERA has proposed spreading out industry to rural villages. This will encourage their growth and make our industry less vulnerable to foreign attack or incursion."

 QIE_kang_youwei: "The Legacy of Kang Youwei"
 QIE_kang_youwei_desc: "Kang Youwei was one of the founders of the NCERA, though he passed away soon after its inception in 1927. A brilliant scholar and legal reformer, Kang spent half a century arguing for a constitutional monarchy with an Emperor who truly looked out for his people. With the Zhili overthrown and the NCERA empowered, this dream is close to being a reality."

 QIE_rural_infrastructure: "Modernise Rural Infrastructure"
 QIE_rural_infrastructure_desc: "China's rural infrastructure is shockingly lacking, with some calling it the worst in the world after Africa. Concerted government investment must be made into improving rural transportation networks if we are ever going to lift China's peasantry out of poverty."

 QIE_benevolent_emperor: "A Benevolent Emperor"
 QIE_benevolent_emperor_desc: "While most in the West think the Emperor of China is some sort of despotic warlord straight out of the Middle Ages, we know that the Emperor is a benevolent and kind soul who wants the best for his subjects. Concerted propaganda efforts must be made to ensure that everyone sees our vision as the truth."

 QIE_rural_loyalty: "Rural Loyalty Ensured"
 QIE_rural_loyalty_desc: "The NCERA has completed its major rural reform plan and secured its hold on government. Even in areas of China we do not directly control, the people clamour out for our benevolent leadership! When our enemies enter our land they will not find the population easy to overcome as well - the peasantry are ready to lay down their lives to defend China!"

 QIE_reform_criminal_justice: "Legal Revision Office"
 QIE_reform_criminal_justice_desc: "When it was established in 1902, the Legal Revision Office and its patrons pursued sweeping judicial and constitutional reforms. Although the Office did successfully promulgate the Da Qing Xinglu (Qing Criminal Code) and the Da Qing minlu (Qing Civil Code), these successes were cut short by republican anarchy. As we rebuild, the office's judicial services are once again required."

 QIE_military_state: "Militarise the State"
 QIE_military_state_desc: "The Zhili Clique, while a military organisation, left large parts of the Qing military completely inefficient and underfunded. In order to rectify this problem, we have begun a whole-sale militarisation of the nation. Youth training leagues, a modernised conscription system, and other reforms will ensure we are ready to stand up to what ever enemy we face."

 QIE_centralize_state: "Centralise the State"
 QIE_centralize_state_desc: "The last two decades of internecine warlord conflict left China divided and decentralised. From our new position of power in Beijing we must now begin the long, arduous task of centralising this divided nation, for only then can its people enjoy true peace and prosperity."

 QIE_YCP_arsenals: "Modernise Arsenals"
 QIE_YCP_arsenals_desc: "The arsenals that are to supply our war machine are sorely out of date and underfunded. Concerted investment must be made into weapons and ammunition production if we are to stand any chance of victory over our foes."

 QIE_destroy_leftists: "Destroy Leftists"
 QIE_destroy_leftists_desc: "While there are few actual leftists within the territory we directly control, the recent KMT uprising to the south has sparked something of a 'Red Scare' within the elite. We can use this to our advantage, drumming up claims of 'socialist infiltration' to bolster our regime and encourage the people to support us."

 QIE_emperor_unifier: "A Unifying Emperor"
 QIE_emperor_unifier_desc: "While some may see the Emperor as anachronistic to our modernising, centralising vision, he can serve as a useful tool - a rallying point around which the formally disparate, decentralised country can unify. Propaganda can be employed to make sure every Chinese - from a farmer on the Yellow River to a goat herder in the steppes of Xinjiang knows they are part of the same nation."

 QIE_YCP_modernization: "Modernise Civilian Industry"
 QIE_YCP_modernization_desc: "The few civilian industries not formerly run by the Germans are laughable by Western standards. With the German industrial withdrawal, we can take their designs and apply them to our own factories, modernising them and significantly increasing our industrial output."

 QIE_cult_of_progress: "The Bureau of Progress"
 QIE_cult_of_progress_desc: "Unsatisfied with the meandering debates of the Assembly the YCP have taken it upon themselves to create a new 'Bureau of Progress' to oversee much needed reform to the armed forces and state industries. Under the auspices of Yan Xishan, the Young China Party hopes to overshadow the Assembly with organisations of its own design, completely bypassing legislative oversight."

 QIE_YCP_modern_warfare: "The Needs of Modern Warfare"
 QIE_YCP_modern_warfare_desc: "The tumult of the last decade has taught all officers the importance of fine artillery. None more so than the clique making up the core of the Young China Party. Many having been educated in Germany, have seen first-hand the power of modern armaments. The state cannot let up for even the briefest of moments our drive towards modernity."

 QIE_YCP_trappings_of_a_party_state: "Trappings of a Party State"
 QIE_YCP_trappings_of_a_party_state_desc: "Hand in hand, the Young China Party and Yan Xishan have worked towards a new China bereft of the chronic illnesses the old nobility and warlords birthed so many years ago. The world has moved quickly these last few years, it is the duty of the party to take these lessons to heart and mould the future of China accordingly."

 QIE_chinese_century: "The Chinese Century"
 QIE_chinese_century_desc: "With our sweeping reforms complete we enter the world as a rising power, ready to take on our foes and prove to the world once and for all that China is the true master of the East."

 QIE_appoint_viceroys: "General Administration of Communications"
 QIE_appoint_viceroys_desc: "Telecommunications development in China started with Governor Li Hongzhang's open letter in 1879. While he wanted to prioritise the imperial military's communication needs in tandem with the Empire's development of the imperial military-industrial complex, other reformers also recognised the vast civilian and economic benefits of the system. We've still yet to realise their ambitions, but restructuring the Telegraph Office would help kickstart the process. "

 QIE_new_coronation: "A New Coronation"
 QIE_new_coronation_desc: "A controversial idea has floated around the Qing nobility ever since the anti-Zhili coup - a second coronation for Puyi. While expensive, this could signal to China and the world we have formally cast off the shackles of warlordism and have entered a new stage of growth and renewal."

 QIE_imperial_arsenals: "Construct New Imperial Arsenals"
 QIE_imperial_arsenals_desc: "Industrialisation in China started with military production. It was the need for security and self-strengthening that drove earlier reformers to ramp up heavy industries for manufacturing ships and ordinances. However, wracked by social and economic constraints, our predecessors failed to catch up with the other imperial powers. Closing this gap now is a must for the survival of our empire."

 QIE_noble_factories: "Bureau of Industrial Affairs"
 QIE_noble_factories_desc: "With the seizing of all German-owned enterprises in the wake of the coup, many German-owned factories now lie vacant. While some short-sighted individuals bemoan the drop in economic production, we see this as an opportunity to further our home-grown industries. With the Hanyang Arsenal and Kaiping Mining Bureau as our models, we will indigenise and improve upon these German holdings."

 QIE_raise_banners: "Raise the Banners"
 QIE_raise_banners_desc: "While the Eight Banners were mostly dissolved in the wake of the Taiping Rebellion, some Qing generals are now suggesting we create a modern version of the system. While largely adhering to Western divisional organisational structures, we will apply Qing history and legacy to make them truly our own."

 QIE_imperial_roads: "The Dragon and the Iron Horse"
 QIE_imperial_roads_desc: "In times before Republican anarchy, Governors Li Hongzhang and Zhang Zhidong were pioneers of infrastructure development in the Great Qing. Their overland projects helped to tie the empire together, improving security and economic interconnectedness. We will honour their legacy and bind together the vast expanses of our empire with new road and railway networks"

 QIE_mandate_heaven: "The Mandate of Heaven"
 QIE_mandate_heaven_desc: "Some might claim it an outdated term, but what is the Mandate of Heaven but not a popular expression of the legitimate will of the government? Our scholars will need to update some texts, but with some work we can distribute propaganda that shows that Puyi is the true and legitimate Emperor of China."

 QIE_manchu_default_debt: "Default on Debt"
 QIE_manchu_default_debt_desc: "While we have created a new government, international creditors do not see things the same way. Our overwhelming international debt will continue to hinder our economic growth unless we default on it, harming us in the short term but allowing us to develop in the long run."

 QIE_more_equal_treaties: "Debt Negotiations"
 QIE_more_equal_treaties_desc: "While it may be tempting to default on our debt entirely, influential Zongshe members have come up with an alternative for the betterment of the empire's fiscal longevity. Germany has seen its influence dramatically hindered by the many anti-concessionists gaining prominence in our new government, but should we offer a chance to renegotiate our economic ties they may consider this a chance to salvage some influence in Beijing."

 QIE_county_reorganization: "County Reorganisation Act"
 QIE_county_reorganization_desc: "The County Reorganisation Act is perhaps one of the most risky pieces of legislation since the Hundred Days' Reforms. Its promulgation will would irrevocably change rural relations by imposing the Emperor's will into rural society. Although risky, it is hope that with the act, county governments will no longer be corrupt, self-serving institutions but genuine tools of the Emperor to better the lives of his subjects."

 QIE_county_assemblies: "Reinstitute the County Assemblies"
 QIE_county_assemblies_desc: "In 1910, Zhili province experimented with self-rule through the establishment of County Assemblies. The Assemblies became institutions with which local gentries and elites project power and negotiate their relations with the centre. Although the Zhili forcefully dissolved them the early 30s, we can revive these assemblies to gain the favour of rural elites, who would then cement our control over the countryside."

 QIE_imperial_consolidation: "Pacify the Nation"
 QIE_imperial_consolidation_desc: "The majority of China is ruled by warlord cliques, leftists, and even worse - republicans. These traitors must be destroyed! Soon, our armies will march out to destroy these rats and unify China behind the banner of the Emperor!"

 QIE_demand_fealty: "Demand Warlords Bend the Knee"
 QIE_demand_fealty_desc: "While we must seek out and destroy the leftists and republicans that infest large parts of our country, the more ideologically nebulous warlords may be brought to heel by the threat of our supreme army. If not, then we will simply destroy them."

 QIE_destroy_concessions: "Eradicate the Concessions"
 QIE_destroy_concessions_desc: "The Legation Cities are a stain on China's sovereignty and independence. While trade with the West is permissible, the cities are relics of the Century of Humiliation and have no place in our modern government. With the rest of the world embroiled in chaos now is the perfect moment to strike and reclaim our lost cities!"

 QIE_false_republic: "Dealing with the Northern Traitors"
 QIE_false_republic_desc: "The fools to the north claim to be the 'last bastion' of China's legitimate government. In reality they are little more than Japanese lapdogs. While they slavishly serve their masters we should strike and reclaim our homeland!"

 QIE_we_win: "The Dragon Rises from the Ashes"
 QIE_we_win_desc: "Few thought it possible, but we have triumphed over all of our foes! We now stand undisputed as the true masters of China, with the Emperor ready to lead the nation into this brave new world."

 QIE_rebuild_command_structure: "Restructure the Imperial General Staff"
 QIE_rebuild_command_structure_desc: "Officially, the Great Qing had never established a General Staff Office. While some proposals for instituting one were passed around in 1901, nothing ever materialised from those discussions. Our current Staff Office is a Zhili inheritance, wrought by nepotism and corruption. Nothing less than a clean sweep of the rotten structure will do to ensure maximum efficacy, as well as the loyalty of our commanders."

 QIE_foreigner_against_foreigner: "The Shanghai Connection"
 QIE_foreigner_against_foreigner_desc: "Within the foreign legations, there are many European military officials and career soldiers currently out of work. Whether French, British or Russian, the collapse of their Empires left them without suitable employment, and more than a few of these military men bear a grudge against Germany for sweeping up their former colonies. Gaining their service would not only benefit us militarily, but also give us valuable insider connections within the Legations."

 QIE_look_to_our_past: "Legacy of the New Armies"
 QIE_look_to_our_past_desc: "First established in 1895 to act as our shield against foreign encroachment and internal enemies, the New Armies had instead turned against the Emperor and gave way to republican anarchy. Our follies with managing them were many, most dire of all, allocating too much personal authority to local commanders. We've learned from our shortcomings since then, and will build a greater and more powerful force than our first attempt."

 QIE_assess_doctrines: "Commission for Army Reorganisation"
 QIE_assess_doctrines_desc: "The Commission for Army Organisation was first established to help promulgate key reforms to the imperial military in 1903, and it would not be overstating to say those reforms laid the foundations for our current force. However, the warlords have squandered the progress we've made with their endless bickering. We should reassemble the Commission to review, and perhaps help reorganise the imperial force once more."

 QIE_uneasy_coalition: "The Uneasy Coalition"
 QIE_uneasy_coalition_desc: "Each of the political groups that helped overthrow the Zhili Clique have much to offer the military. The NCERA brings the loyalty of the peasantry, the YCP is made up of Baoding cadets, and the Qing nobility control some of the finest cavalrymen in the nation. While we must all work together to defeat the Japanese, each group may want concessions if they are not in power."

 QIE_rural_defense_force: "Found the Rural Defence Forces"
 QIE_rural_defense_force_desc: "For too long the peasantry of China have been terrorised by roving warbands of looters and bandits. The NCERA has proposed enacting a system whereby each village will have its own defence force equipped with obsolete rifles. While of dubious military use, they will be useful at harassing enemies and making our territory costly to occupy."

 QIE_prepare_dikes: "Prepare the Dykes"
 QIE_prepare_dikes_desc: "The dykes along the Yellow River present a possibility for a drastic strike against the Japanese. Should we open them while enemy forces are advancing, the floodwaters will slow their progress immensely and may give our forces a better chance at defending the area."

 QIE_exploit_baoding_contacts: "Exploit Baoding Contacts"
 QIE_exploit_baoding_contacts_desc: "The Baoding Military Academy has contracts with military academies and arsenals all around China, even in areas controlled by ostensible enemies. With enough funding, these contractors could be persuaded to join our side, bringing with them their experience and technical expertise."

 QIE_reinstate_baojia: "Reinstate the Baojia System"
 QIE_reinstate_baojia_desc: "Founded during the Song Dynasty, the Baojia system was created maintain local order, collect taxes, and organise civil projects. By recreating a modern version of this system we can more effectively recruit and train soldiers."

 QIE_best_money_can_buy: "Military Preparatory Schools"
 QIE_best_money_can_buy_desc: "The Military Preparatory Schools were first established as a quick-fix for our critical shortage of trained officers and cadets for the New Army. While the provincial nature of the academies meant the quality of the graduates varied, they nonetheless helped to offset at least some of the training costs. We should look into reinitiating at least some of these military halls."

 QIE_imperial_propaganda: "Venerate the Citizen-Soldier Model"
 QIE_imperial_propaganda_desc: "For too long, the warlords have defiled what it meant to be a soldier through their petty material desires and power struggles. The ideal Chinese citizen-soldier, since times ancient, has been morally upright, honed in his physical strength yet equally sharp in his mind. We must enforce this model of upstanding military masculinity across the army, so that all soldiers of the Great Qing can stand toe to toe with the likes of Japan and Germany."

 QIE_manchu_naval_academy: "Found the Imperial Naval Academy"
 QIE_manchu_naval_academy_desc: "The Qing Navy was largely trained by European schools. While it is a secondary or tertiary concern at the moment, we should still devote some funding to training our naval cadets here rather than overseas."

 QIE_manchu_air_warfare: "Study European Air Tactics"
 QIE_manchu_air_warfare_desc: "While we would like to take as little as possible from the foreign devils, there is no debate that their mastery over aerial warfare is undisputed. We should study their doctrine and tactics, so that we may apply them to our own air force."

 QIE_expand_baoding_rnd: "Found Baoding Military Research Department"
 QIE_expand_baoding_rnd_desc: "With our military fully reformed along modern lines, we should set out to create an institution that allows our forces to keep abreast of the latest technological innovations. By creating a fully independent Baoding Military Research Department, our forces will have the technical backing to go toe-to-toe with any army in the world."

 QIE_commisars: "Political Commissars"
 QIE_commisars_desc: "Liu Menggeng has proposed an interesting idea - adding a dedicated ideological commissar to each military formation. While costly, these men will inspire our forces to fight with even greater patriotic fervour!"

 QIE_integration_harsh: "Integration by Force"
 QIE_integration_harsh_desc: "The foul traitors who rebelled against our benevolent rule deserve no mercy! Their rogue lands shall be re-integrated into our great nation by force!"

 QIE_integration_nice: "Benevolent Integration"
 QIE_integration_nice_desc: "While the rebel rulers who seized power over much of China must be punished, the peasantry the oppressed should not face the same fate. Instead, we should peaceably integrate former rebel lands into our government, so that all in China may live under our benevolent rule."

 QIE_fractured_empire_desc: "The Qing Empire theoretically controls all of China outside of Manchuria, Tibet, and Mongolia. In reality, the Emperor’s power barely extends outside the walls of the Forbidden City, while President Cao Kun is largely powerless beyond the assembly floor. Wu Peifu, the real power behind the throne, is more interested in consolidating his power base in Luoyang and balancing military cliques against each other than improving his country in any meaningful way."
 QIE_fractured_empire_removed_tt: "§YFractured Empire§! is removed"

 QIE_fractured_empire_manchu: "Fractured Empire"
 QIE_fractured_empire_manchu_desc: "The Qing Empire theoretically controls all of China outside of Manchuria, Tibet, and Mongolia. In reality, the Emperor’s power barely extends outside the Yellow River Basin. Although the tyrannical Zhili clique have been ousted, disorder still reigns across the land. It will still take mindful steps to mend the divisions even within our own limited grasp of China."

 QIE_big_debt: "Overwhelming National Debt"
 QIE_big_debt_desc: "China’s struggle to develop its national economy has resulted in an enormous trade debt fronted by the Beijing government. Industrial machinery is imported at a staggering cost, and what little domestic manufacturing does exist lacks the quality and quantity to compete on the world market. China’s main exports are thus mostly agricultural, and even cash crops fetch low prices compared to widely imported foreign luxuries like cigarettes and radios. This problem is only exacerbated by widespread institutionalised corruption and a thriving opium trade."

 QIE_black_monday: "Black Monday"
 QIE_black_monday_desc: "While most of China has escaped extensive economic fallout stemming from Black Monday, the intertwining of our economy with Germany's has caused a slight hit to economic production."

 QIE_leadership_crisis: "Zhili Leadership Crisis"
 QIE_leadership_crisis_desc: "The advanced age of many senior Zhili commanders is a worrying trend that must be rectified soon, lest our army be entirely controlled by old men."

 QIE_leadership_crisis_bad: "Deepening Leadership Crisis"
 QIE_leadership_crisis_bad_desc: "The death of several senior Zhili generals has further exacerbated our already dangerous lack of young (or even middle-aged) faces in our high command."

 QIE_outraged_parties: "Outraged Assembly"
 QIE_outraged_parties_desc: "Following our decision to support the League of Eight Provinces, the National Assembly erupted into outraged protest. The average peasant does not care too much, but we still need to act quickly to restore stability to our government."

 QIE_popular_warlord_idea: "Popular Support for Wu Peifu"
 QIE_popular_warlord_idea_desc: "Following Wu Peifu’s decision to intervene in favour of the anti-concessionist Governor Chen Tiaoyuan, he has seen a marked increase in popular support. While still viewed with some suspicion in some intellectual circles, he has gained a fair bit of legitimacy."

 QIE_defaulted_debt: "Defaulted Foreign Debt"
 QIE_defaulted_debt_desc: "In a move to bolster domestic legitimacy, we have defaulted on our international debts. The economic ramifications of this plan will ripple for months, and affect nearly every sector of our economy."

 QIE_harmonious_balance_idea: "A Harmonious Balance"
 QIE_harmonious_balance_idea_desc: "Our government has achieved a rare goal - forming and maintaining a harmonious balance between the spiritual power of Emperor and the temporal power of the Zhili Clique."

 QIE_local_logistics: "Traditional Logistics"
 QIE_local_logistics_desc: "While we may have been cut off from Western innovations like motorised logistics, China never had the infrastructure to support them anyway. Relying on traditional logistics may not win us any technological awards, but a mule can cross the rugged terrain of this nation easier than a truck."

 QIE_german_bailout: "German Bailout"
 QIE_german_bailout_desc: "In our most dire time of need we were forced to turn to our ‘friends’ in Germany one final time. German banks have taken over our enormous trade debt, re-packaged it, and sold it to unsuspecting customers in Germany as ‘stable government bonds’. While this solves our financial problems, it has created a whole new set of political ones."

 QIE_diplomatic_genius_idea: "New Diplomatic Corps"
 QIE_diplomatic_genius_idea_desc: "Wellington Koo, a diplomatic mastermind, is spearheading the creation of a new diplomatic corps for the republic. With his skill and expertise, these new diplomats should help reinforce our legitimacy."

 QIE_pragmatism_idea: "Pragmatism"
 QIE_pragmatism_idea_desc: "Writer Hu Shih, now President, is famous for his theory of ‘pragmatism’ - instead of uncompromising ideology, it stresses cooperation and conciliation, even with former enemies. It should help our government establish control over the fractured nation."

 QIE_unprepared_military: "Unprepared Military"

 QIE_legitimate_emperor_idea: "Defending the Emperor"

 QIE_rural_insurgency_idea: "Rural Loyalty"
 QIE_rural_insurgency_idea_desc: "Through the success of the Rural Reform Movement many peasants have been wholly won over to our cause, ready to die for the Emperor."

 QIE_mandate_heaven_idea: "Mandate of Heaven"
 QIE_mandate_heaven_idea_desc: "While some might claim it an outdated notion, the Zongshe Party has successfully re-branded the concept of the ‘Mandate of Heaven’ for a more modern framework of political theory. Instead of emphasising divine right, new propaganda emphasises how the Emperor acts as a manifestation of the civic forces of China."

 QIE_banner_idea: "Modern Banner System"
 QIE_banner_idea_desc: "In an effort to modernise the ad-hoc military left over from the Zhili Clique, the Zongshe party has attempted to bring back the banner system of the old Qing emperors. This is really just a bit of historical flavour added on top of a modern army organisational structure, but this historical allegory helps give the military more legitimacy."

 QIE_yan_xishan_backer_idea_desc: "A republican warlord, few thought Yan Xishan would want to have anything to do with the new Qing state. Yet with Fengtian currently under the Japanese heel and the south engulfed in chaos, the Model Governor has decided to throw in his hat with the new constitutional system. Promoting aggressive industrial and political reform, Yan will most likely try and keep the Emperor a ceremonial figure."

 QIE_zhang_tianran_backer_idea: "Zhang Tianran - Yiguandao Primacy"
 QIE_zhang_tianran_backer_idea_desc: "Zhang Tianran, leader of the esoteric Yiguandao cult, has formally joined our government as 'spiritual advisor' as a condition of his support during the intervention, a nebulous position that grants him unclear authority. While he certainly supports reform and modernisation, many in the coalition government fear that his true goals lie beyond his current influence. Still, he brings with him the ability court the influence of the Yiguandao."

 QIE_roc_idea: "The Republic Triumphant"
 QIE_roc_idea_desc: "We have vanquished all the so-called 'republics' that contested our rule over China. While some may doubt our legitimacy, few will doubt the strength of our army."

 QIE_YCP_militarized_state: "Militarised State"
 QIE_YCP_militarized_state_desc: "Under the YCP, the Qing state has undergone a rapid militarisation. Gone is the nepotistic Zhili command structure, and in its place is a new, Western-inspired structure of youth training leagues, a modernised conscription system, and other reforms."

 QIE_nationalized_yan_xishan_thought: "Nationalising the Words of Yan Xishan"
 QIE_nationalized_yan_xishan_thought_desc: "Governor Yan Xishan has begun to spread his personal political philosophy throughout the Qing Empire, adopting a nationalised, homegrown, and defensive characteristic. At first only a small circle of political thinkers, now there are political clubs discussing and handing out pamphlets for Xishan's favoured 'Heart Washing Society'. Yan Xishan has personally written many of the pamphlets that are now spreading throughout the heartland of the Qing Empire."

 QIE_Yan_party_state_idea: "Yan Xishan's Party-State"
 QIE_Yan_party_state_idea_desc: "Our great benefactor Yan Xishan has taken on the mantle of responsibility to protect the interests of all of China. His once peculiar philosophy has now aggregated into a defining element of our new regime. Throughout the land, people have begun to see the effects of our uncompromising stance on looking forward. After years of mutual building of rapport between Yan Xishan and YCP leadership a true synthesis has been established. There is nothing these stewards of state cannot upend."

 QIE_cult_of_progress_idea: "Bureau of Progress"
 QIE_cult_of_progress_idea_desc: "Tired of the slow processes of democratic debate the YCP has decided to engage in their own gambit for more immediate political action. Yan Xishan has given the go-ahead to the YCP's scheming allowing for the creation of small executive committees to accelerate political reforms. Time will tell if the YCP has the gumption to consolidate their control or slink back to working with the anachronistic Zongshe and naive NCERA."

While this will require some effort to organise, it will hopefully help show the Chinese people that unification is not far away.

Favouring rebuilding China from the ground-up, this group emphasises the value of the traditional Chinese village as the basic building block of society, rather than the warlords cliques that have dominated China for the last half-century. The second part of the coalition is a loose group of intellectuals inspired to the works of Kang Youwei, an ambitious reformer of the late Qing dynasty who advocated for a constitutional monarchy. Following the restoration of Puyi, his works have come back into prominence, and are popular among middle-class urban intellectuals.

 QIE_market_liberal_party_long: "Fanrong Lianmeng (Prosperity League)\n§gThe PL is mainly the party of the new industrialist and banker class, who are suspicious of the HA’s corruption and inefficiency. Germany, also wary of Wu’s ambition but not wanting to revoke its support for the only bulwark of an unpopular regime, has focused on turning informal social clubs frequented by the new industrial upper class into an organised political party, facilitating connections between elites across the country through AoG organised 'progress expositions' that pushed a free-trade agenda as well as modern farming techniques and the newest technology. While not overtly hostile to Wu’s ambitions, the PL mainly acts as a lobbying group, pushing for increased free trade, relaxed government regulations, and industrial stimulus - nominally for the interests of the elite - but truly for the Peking-Kommission. This is also the party favoured by German-trained officers in the fledgling Qing navy, whose inter-service rivalry with the Zhili-dominated army has been deliberately stoked by Germany.§!\n"

 QIE_KR_gathering_storm_desc: "The Qing Empire enters 1936 on the brink. Restored in exchange for German support during the fourth Zhili-Fengtian war in 1927, the Xuantong Emperor remains deeply unpopular and is viewed by many as illegitimate.\n\nThe Zhili clique, who trounced both the Fengtian clique and the KMT, stand as the victors of the chaos that engulfed China for nearly two decades, but their hold on the country is far from secure. Enemies from without and within threaten their hegemony, and it remains to be seen just how long their grasp on power can last..."

### Intro Screen ###
 QIE_country_intro_header: "The Great Qing"
 QIE_country_intro_content: "The internationally mediated end of the last Zhili-Fengtian War in 1928 brought an end to nearly four years of chaos and instability and began the longest period of peace enjoyed by some parts of China since the Xinhai Revolution of 1911. Though Wu Peifu and his Northern Zhili Clique accepted the return of the Qing dynasty, further German concessions were refused, leading to a cooling of relations. Germany continues to maintain support for the Qing Government, but mainly with the aim of ensuring consistent competition with the also-supported Southern Zhili as part of a larger divide and conquer strategy in China as a whole, as well as in the hopes of gradually building a Chinese bulwark against Japan.\n\nThough the spectre of Japanese domination looms across much of Northern and Eastern China, the country is nonetheless far more divided than most in Beijing would prefer, and Qing finds its authority contested on all sides, from the defiant Fengtian Government in the Northeast, to the various ostensible allies across the remainder of China; nominal components of the Empire granted near-total autonomy by grace of geography and regionalist sentiment. As a result, Qing enters 1936 largely contained to the North China Plain, and at the head of a faltering national order."

 QIE_country_intro_header_1: "The Political Situation"
 QIE_country_intro_content_1: "1936 finds the powerless Assembly on the brink. Five groups dominate the body, and although they have no power in the chamber, the groups that support them are not to be trifled with. The most powerful of these is the Harmony Association, nominally led by President Cao Kun. A depressed alcoholic, true power in the group resides with Wu Peifu, who founded the Association as a legitimising movement to ensure Zhili representation in the Assembly. While nominally an independent political party, the Harmony Association's deputies are all former Zhili officers, and following Cao Kun's legally dubious re-election few believe the group is anything more than a front for Wu to control the country.\n\nThe Prosperity League occupies a similar position, and while it claims to be a political party few see it as any more than a lobbying group for German interests in Beijing.\n\nThis leaves three parties in the opposition: The Zongshe Party, comprised of Qing princes and former royal hangers-on, the Young China Party, a clique of young officers at the Baoding academy styling themselves after the Young Turk Party, and the New Chinese Empire Reformation Association, a fusion of two reform groups that, while loyal to the Emperor, favour a structural reorganisation of China back to the traditional model of the rural village, and the end to warlord cliques. While these three groups are in opposition to Wu, he allows them seats in the powerless assembly as a way to legitimise his unpopular regime."

 QIE_country_intro_header_2: "Restructuring Our Debt"
 QIE_country_intro_content_2: "For the last few years Wu and Cao have spent most of their political capital attempting to restructure and reduce the enormous debt of the Qing Empire. While theoretically possible, this plan has run into numerous challenges, the chief being a lack of support from the provincial governors. Rumours of instability in the south have further complicated these plans, and Cao Kun is expected to deliver a speech on reducing the national debt to the Assembly after the New Year Celebrations later this month."

 qiedom.4.t: "Death of Wang Chengbin"
 qiedom.4.d: "Earlier this morning Wang Chengbin, a senior member of the Zhili Clique and major ally of Cao Kun, passed away due to old age. While his death in and of itself is a blow to our command structure, it reveals a worrying trend. Many senior Zhili military officials are of old age, poor health, or both, and the corruption endemic in our military prevents younger officers from advancing through the ranks. Unless a serious effort is made, our high command will soon consist solely of doddering, senile old men terrified of adapting new technologies and doctrines."
 qiedom.4.a: "What happened to age bringing wisdom?"

 qiedom.5.t: "Ripples of Black Monday"
 qiedom.5.d: "While in the weeks following Black Monday it appeared that we had escaped the worst of the damage, over the last few days German affiliated businesses have been hit with supply chain issues and increased prices. While the economic disruption is nowhere near the scale experienced in Europe and the Americas, this is still a blow to our economy."
 qiedom.5.a: "Damn it!"

 qiedom.13.t: "Election Results - Victory!"
 qiedom.13.d: "Results are in from the parts of China still stable enough to hold elections. Turnout was (as expected) quite low, but in cities like Beijing we received record numbers of votes from intellectuals, reformers, and others previously opposed to our rule. It appears the intervention, while robbing us of German support, has given us a large deal of political legitimacy and local support.\n\nIn the aftermath of the victory, president Cao Kun announced he was stepping down, to be replaced by Yan Huiqing. It unclear how much of an influence Wu Peifu had on this decision, but it is clear the Jade Marshal did not want any of Cao's drunken antics impacting the new government."
 qiedom.13.a: "We didn't even have to rig this one!"

 qiedom.14.t: "Meeting with the Zongshe"
 qiedom.14.d: "Following the announcement of our attack on Anqing Province, nearly every delegate to the Assembly outside the Harmony League reacted by walking out of the building. President Cao Kun has now been tasked with meeting with senior members of the Zongshe Party to ensure their continued loyalty following the speech.\n\n'You have to understand, sirs, that Japanese invasion is not a matter of if - it is a matter of when. Continued German support is required to ensure our national safety!'\n\nCao was initially successful at persuading many Manchu nobles, but some of the younger hotshots like Gobulo Runqi reacted poorly to the President's overtures. Several hours of negotiation later, they agreed on a 'noble pension' paid out to senior Manchu royalty with the express purpose of preserving 'Imperial culture'. It's little more than a bribe but it will keep the peace."
 qiedom.14.a: "President Cao is no stranger to bribery..."

 qiedom.15.t: "Meeting with the YCP"
 qiedom.15.d: "The Young China Party, an alliance of young idealistic Baoding cadets and urban reformers, reacted with the most hostility to Cao Kun's intervention speech. Claiming that the intervention was 'capitulation to foreign interests', they were the first to storm out of the assembly chamber in protest. President Cao is now tasked with ensuring their loyalty.\n\nInitially, they stubbornly resisted all attempts at negotiation, but eventually a deal was hammered out. They will maintain their loyalty in exchange for increased military autonomy and the end to supervision of the Baoding curriculum. This will hamper our efforts to ensure they stay loyal in the future, but we need their loyalty now."
 qiedom.15.a: "Let's hope this keeps them in check"

 qiedom.16.t: "Meeting with the NCERA"
 qiedom.16.d: "The New Chinese Empire Reform Association was the last to leave the Assembly in protest, and almost certainly will be the hardest to convince to rejoin. Primarily representing the peasants and rural farmers in China, the leaders take a paternalistic approach to their constituents. President Cao is sceptical of their devotion to the reformist cause, but nonetheless met with Y. C. James Yen, one of their leaders. Yen was initially hesitant, but eventually they were able to reach a compromise. Government controlled industries in Beijing will begin producing farming implements and other rural aid to help impoverished peasants."
 qiedom.16.a: "Easy enough"

 qiedom.17.t: "The Assembly Returns to Normal"
 qiedom.17.d: "Following President Cao's negotiations and 'gift giving' the delegates have all returned to the Assembly. Still powerless, the body can once again begin to rubber-stamp the President and Wu's agenda."
 qiedom.17.a: "Excellent"

 qiedom.18.t: "German Mining Companies Increase Their Operations in Eastern Shanxi"
 qiedom.18.d: "The Shanxi region has always been a good source of coal and useful metals for the Empire. Following the 4th Zhili-Fengtian War, we gained direct control of Eastern Shanxi, a slim area of land that used to belong to Yan Xishan’s Shanxi Clique. Our ownership of Eastern Shanxi has been the cause of tensions between us and the Shanxi Clique, but for now they are unable to compete with our military strength. Much like the rest of Shanxi, this area is rich with coal and iron. Multiple German companies took an interest in Eastern Shanxi, and so purchased the coal and iron mines there. These mines sit very close to the border with the Shanxi Clique, but this has not yet been a problem.\n\nHowever, news just came in that these Eastern Shanxi companies are going to increase their mining operations, and have presented plans that show some of their mines falling into Shanxi controlled territory. We personally do not need to worry about this, but it is likely to cause some problems in the Shanxi Clique, with many peasants feeling robbed that these German companies are taking their mines."
 qiedom.18.a: "We wish them good luck with their business ventures."

 qiedom.19.t: "Scandal!"
 qiedom.19.d: "Assembly President Cao Kun was just found passed out in his office, slumped over his desk and a bottle of liquor. Cao's alcoholism has been a matter of public knowledge, but until now he has mostly kept it under wraps. It seems the stress of managing the discontent following our intervention in favour of the Nanjing Clique has finally caused him to snap. Wu Peifu has 'persuaded' Cao to resign, and has promoted veteran diplomat and civil servant Yan Huiqing to fill the position."
 qiedom.19.a: "Alright"

 qiedom.20.t: "Resignation from the Legation Council!"
 qiedom.20.d: "With our new anti-Concession stance, we have formally resigned from the perfidious Legation Council! No more will we answer to the foreign scum who exploit our country for their own financial gain!"
 qiedom.20.a: "China for the Chinese!"

 qiedom.21.t: "[QIE.GetName] Quits the Legation Council!"
 qiedom.21.d: "Following their recent adoption of an anti-Concession stance, the [QIE.GetName] have formally quit the Legation Council, denouncing it as a 'tool of imperialism'! While they only held observer status, this is still a worrying development..."
 qiedom.21.a: "Disconcerting"

##LEP collapse##

 qielepcollapse.1.t: "The Sale of the Zhegan Railroad"
 qielepcollapse.1.d: "The past few weeks have seen a great deal of economic activity in the League of Eight Provinces, the southern conglomerate of provinces ruled by our nominal subordinate, Sun Chuanfang. Even more heavily influenced by German economic support than we are, the League just finished construction on a major railroad, the Zhegan line. Though funded by the Germans, it was largely built by Chinese labour, leading many to hope for a more equitable relationship between German and Chinese in the League, at least in economic affairs.\n\nA few days ago, in a surprising move, the AOG publicly announced its plans to purchase and consolidate a number of eastern railways on behalf of their subsidiary group, the Schantung-Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft - including this new Zhegan route.\n\nThis move angered many native Chinese residents of the League, who saw the Zhegan line as a potential building block in an equal relationship between Europeans and Asians. Widespread protests have broken out, inflamed by conspiracies of fraud and embezzlement on the part of Sun’s cronies."
 qielepcollapse.1.a: "We need to keep an eye on this"

 qielepcollapse.2.t: "Widespread Attacks on Foreigners"
 qielepcollapse.2.d: "Following the unrest surrounding the Zhegan railroad, a number of German investors and businessmen have been savagely attacked by rabid anti-foreign mobs. To make matters worse, widespread boycotts of German goods have began in the South, and this morning reports reached Beijing of bombings of railway stations in Hangzhou and other cities on the Central China Railway. Transportation has ground to a halt in many regions of the League, and KMT guerrillas have used this opportunity to stage increasingly daring attacks on isolated League garrisons.\n\nThe German ambassador is demanding accountability, and while the League is largely autonomous from our control we still need to do something. Jiang Baili and other Zhili officials have long pushed to exert greater control over the League, and are urging Wu to use this crisis to leverage greater control over the south. Wu is personally uncertain of this, but is currently drafting a telegram to demand accountability from Sun and offer our help should he need it. Unsaid, of course, is the demand for increased control over League affairs should he accept our help."
 qielepcollapse.2.a: "Let's see what Sun has to say..."

 qielepcollapse.3.t: "The Wuhu Incident"
 qielepcollapse.3.d: "Troubling information reached Luoyang and Beijing this morning. While reports are somewhat contradictory, it appears there was some sort of a massacre of peaceful protestors by League and German troops in the city of Wuhu. Some claim German troops simply mowed down the protestors, while others claim a group of KMT radicals attacked the Germans and League troops first. Whatever the cause, the city has fallen into anarchy and protests have sprung up all over the League.\n\nIronically, at the same time as we received this information we received a report from Sun claiming he has the situation under control. Some Zhili generals are pushing for a major intervention in the south should the situation deteriorate further, but Wu has yet to take a clear position on the issue.\n\nFurther exasperating our problems, an informant we have placed within the NCERA claims they have somehow received information on the situation, and are planning to give a scathing speech later in the assembly today. HA officials are attempting to rouse Cao Kun from a drunken stupor and write a counterspeech, but we’ve been caught off guard."
 qielepcollapse.3.a: "'Under control' my ass..."

 qielepcollapse.4.t: "Anhui Breaks Free"
 qielepcollapse.4.d: "The province of Anhui, long chafing under Sun’s rule, essentially declared independence from the League this week. In a widely-distributed pamphlet, Governor Chen Tiaoyuan claimed that the Wuhu incident ‘shows that Sun cannot manage this crisis, and essentially abrogates him from any responsibility in Anhui.’\n\nSome Zhili generals have unilaterally begun to mobilise their troops against ‘KMT incursions’, though Wu rightly suspects their true intention is territorial expansion. Seeking to undercut their opportunity to invade, he declared a ‘national state of readiness’ this morning to all Zhili and Manchu generals, urging them to ready their troops for ‘any possible armed conflict’. Confused Zhili troops have largely fallen into line with Wu and any premature attack south was effectively ended before it began."
 qielepcollapse.4.a: "Let's hope this keeps them in line"

 qielepcollapse.5.t: "A Telegram from Nanjing"
 qielepcollapse.5.d: "Minister Wu Peifu was woken from a restless sleep.\n\n'Sun Chuanfang shot 8:55 AM STOP\nPerpetrator unknown STOP\nIn coma STOP\nUnlikely to wake STOP\nRiots widespread STOP\nFleeing with gold and documents STOP'\n\nTwo hours later, Luoyang has become a frenzied hub of activity. Documents concerning Sun’s more salacious dealings with Beijing burn in the furnaces, while a group of senior Zhili officials confer with one another. In an unprecedented move, Wu has invited several Manchu nobles, notably the Emperor's brother Pujie, to be present for the drafting of some form of unified statement in response to the assassination."
 qielepcollapse.5.a: "What will come next?"

 qielepcollapse.6.t: "Imperial Navy Flees North!"
 qielepcollapse.6.d: "Lacking any suitable ports in the north, the Imperial Fleet has been based out of Nantong since the end of the 1927 conflict. With rioting, civil unrest, and general chaos enveloping the city, Admiral Wu Renli has ordered the fleet to leave the city, and head north for the small ports we control outside Tianjin. The fall of the Nanjing docks also means we have lost what limited naval manufacturing capabilities we had."
 qielepcollapse.6.a: "Damn!"

 qielepcollapse.7.t: "Chen Tiaoyuan Sends a Telegram"
 qielepcollapse.7.d: "‘To the eminent President Cao Kun, and Imperial Minister Wu Peifu,\n\nI, Governor Chen Tiaoyuan, humbly ask for funding for my troops. As outlined in the constitution of our great nation, it is the responsibility of the national government to provide funds to provincial governors to suppress unrest. With the situation of League-Marshal Sun in Nanjing unclear, I have taken the responsibility of protecting the province of Anhui against bandits and leftist agitators.’\n\nThis telegram was delivered to Wu Peifu this morning from the Anhui Governor Chen Tiaoyuan, of the Anqing Clique. While the tone of the letter was very bold, it appears Chen has restored order to his province.\n\nWu is faced with a choice - Chen would be a powerful ally, but he has a firm anti-concessions stance. Supporting him in the long-term would alienate Germany, whose support will be essential in the inevitable war against Japan. At the same time, taking a stance against Germany would undoubtedly endear Wu with the population."
 qielepcollapse.7.a: "Send the gold. We need stability on our borders."
 qielepcollapse.7.b: "Refuse. No funds for rebels!"
 qie_anti_concessions_decision_warning: "§RChoosing to support Chen Tiaoyuan will lead Qing on a firmly Anti-Concessionist path, meaning it cannot support the League of Eight Provinces and will take Anqing's side in the conflict. It will also guarantee alienating Germany. If Anqing loses the conflict, Qing will be very alone.§!\n"

 qielepcollapse.8.t: "An Offer from Marshal Qi"
 qielepcollapse.8.d: "Following our refusal of Governor Chen's telegram, a message has arrived from Qi Xieyuan - who has declared himself the new League-Marshal of the Eight Provinces, succeeding Sun Chuanfang.\n\n'To the most auspicious Marshal Wu - I, Qi Xieyuan, request your aid in suppressing the rebellion in Anhui. As you are my liege and commander it is only proper that you assist me in my times of need.'\n\nThe tone of the request leaves many suspicious, as theoretically Qi should be able to easily crush Anqing and the KMT rebellion to the south with German aid."
 qielepcollapse.8.a: "Let's hear him out - we could gain some leverage here."
 qielepcollapse.8.b: "He can handle this on his own."

 qielepcollapse.9.t: "Wu Accepts!"
 qielepcollapse.9.d: "Marshal Wu Peifu has accepted our request for help. We should send him another request asking on how he plans to intervene."
 qielepcollapse.9.a: "Excellent!"

 qielepcollapse.10.t: "Wu Refuses!"
 qielepcollapse.10.d: "Marshal Wu Peifu has refused our request for aid! We are on our own now..."
 qielepcollapse.10.a: "Damn!"

 qielepcollapse.11.t: "Another Offer to Chen?"
 qielepcollapse.11.d: "Following our refusal of aid to Anhui Governor Chen Tiaoyuan of the Anqing Clique, worrying reports have begun to emerge that he has reached out to Zhang Zuolin, leader of the rogue Fengtian government in the Northeast. Even more worrying is his use of a Japanese interlocutor to facilitate the conversation. Several of Wu's advisors are suggesting the Marshal reach out again to Chen with an offer of direct support in his rebellion, lest we end up with a Japanese lapdog right on our doorstep.\n\nBeyond just Japanese support for Chen, however, it also seems that non-intervention could lead to widespread domestic unrest. Many in both the opposition parties and the Zhili Clique itself are itching for an opportunity to extend our control in the chaos of the collapse, and already small protests in favour of Governor Chen's anti-concessions stance have broken out across urban areas. Staying silent could result in these protests escalating, further destabilising our already unpopular regime."
 qielepcollapse.11.a: "Let's see what he has to say."
 qielepcollapse.11.b: "This is too risky."

 qielepcollapse.12.t: "Marshal Qi's Offer"
 qielepcollapse.12.d: "Following our acceptance of Governor Chen's request for aid, a message has arrived from Qi Xieyuan - who has declared himself as the new League-Marshal of the Eight Provinces, succeeding Sun Chuanfang.\n\n'To the most auspicious Marshal Wu - I, Qi Xieyuan, request your aid in suppressing the rebellion in Anhui. As you are my liege and commander it is only proper that you assist me in my times of need.'\n\nUnfortunately for Marshal Qi, our commitment to Governor Chen forces us to refuse this request."
 qielepcollapse.12.a: "The die is already cast"

 qielepcollapse.13.t: "The Moment of Truth"
 qielepcollapse.13.d: "Skirmishes between Chen Tiaoyuan's troops and forces loyal to Qi Xieyuan's Nanjing Clique have escalated into open battle. It now comes time to honour our commitment to Governor Chen, and launch our intervention in support of his regime."
 qielepcollapse.13.a: "Our troops march south to defend China!"

 qielepcollapse.14.t: "The Moment of Truth"
 qielepcollapse.14.d: "Skirmishes between Chen Tiaoyuan's troops and forces loyal to Qi Xieyuan's Nanjing Clique have escalated into open battle. It now comes time to honour our commitment to Qi Xieyuan, and launch our intervention in support of his regime."
 qielepcollapse.14.a: "We march to war!"

 qielepcollapse.15.t: "Chen Accepts Our Offer"
 qielepcollapse.15.d: "Governor Chen Tiaoyuan of the Anqing Clique has accepted our offer of support in the League conflict. He also promises that any previous interactions he had with Fengtian or Japanese agents were conducted 'without his express consent' and those who met with the foreigners and traitors have been summarily punished."
 qielepcollapse.15.a: "Prepare the troops!"
 qielepcollapse.15.b: "This is a stupid idea..."

 qielepcollapse.17.t: "Popular Support for Wu Peifu"
 qielepcollapse.17.d: "Following Marshal Wu’s decision to attack the Nanjing government, he ordered President Cao Kun to make a public statement regarding the plan. Broadcast from a balcony in the Forbidden City to a large crowd gathered below, it was also transmitted over the radio - a first in China.\n\n‘Citizens! - For a century we have suffered under foreign oppression! For too long we have been lapdogs to the whims of the British, Germans, and Americans. But no more! Today - we stand independent! The armies of the Son of Heaven march south to destroy the traitor Marshal Qi and his German lackeys. We will no longer be subservient to the whims of Berlin. We cast of the shackles of the Century of Humiliation and say to the world - China is free once again!’\n\nThe speech is met with resounding applause and cheers, and soon sections of it are transcribed to pamphlets and passed around China."
 qielepcollapse.17.a: "Maybe people won't hate us now?"

 qielepcollapse.18.t: "The Peking-Kommission Withdraws from Beijing!"
 qielepcollapse.18.d: "Immediately following President Cao’s incendiary speech, plumes of smoke began to emerge from the streets outside the German embassy and the offices of the Peking-Kommission. A vast mob had formed outside the gates, chanting anti-concession slogans and burning German-made clothes, furniture, and even a hastily-constructed effigy of the Kaiser. Police and Zhili-aligned military units quickly arrived to prevent the scene from turning ugly, but by nightfall most German officials and their Chinese hangers-on had fled to Tianjin."
 qielepcollapse.18.a: "Get out, foreign scum!"

 qielepcollapse.19.t: "Drama in the Assembly"
 qielepcollapse.19.d: "Following Wu’s decision to intervene in favour of the LEP, President Cao Kun was given the somewhat unenviable job of delivering the news to the Assembly. ‘Cherished friends - today I bring you important news concerning the unrest to the south. Marshal Wu, in his eminent wisdom, has elected to support Marshal Qi in his struggles against the traitorous Governor Chen Tiaoyuan. Imperial troops march south to quell the unrest, and we expect a quick and decisi-’\n\nCao trailed off as members of the Young China Party stood up and silently started to march out. Soon after, they were followed by members of the NCERA and Zongshe Party. Soon, only the Harmony Association and Prosperity League members are left. A stunned Cao finishes his speech.\n\n\"a quick and decisive victory. Long live the Emperor!\" It does not take a political genius to see that only the Prosperity League members applaud with any enthusiasm."
 qielepcollapse.19.a: "Bastards!"

 qielepcollapse.20.t: "German Support"
 qielepcollapse.20.d: "Prosperity League members were quick to congratulate President Cao after his speech, and in the reception afterwards bottles of Rhenish wine, Cuban cigars, and other foreign treats were on offer to anyone willing to partake. In the place of the dour-faced Manchu nobles who normally attended these receptions, representatives from the German embassy and the Peking-Kommission stood around in the latest Berlin suits, offering exorbitant gifts to HA lawmakers and some Zhili generals who were also in attendance."
 qielepcollapse.20.a: "At least somebody likes us..."

 qielepcollapse.21.t: "Widespread Rioting Breaks Out"
 qielepcollapse.21.d: "Following Wu and Cao’s silence on LEP-related affairs, small protests began to emerge, clamouring for intervention. As the silence continued, these gatherings quickly grew into large street protests. With Cao finally announcing that he would support neither Qi nor Chen, the protests erupted into riots. Beijing and other major cities are paralysed by the unrest, and nearly everyone, from the richest intellectual to the poorest street vendor, are in the streets denouncing the government. Adding fuel to the fire are wild conspiracy theories that Wu was paid off by the German legation not to intervene, leading many demonstrators to carry anti-German slogans and burn German-made goods. In one instance crude effigies of the Kaiser, Wu, and Cao were all burned outside the Forbidden City before the perpetrators were hauled away in chains."
 qielepcollapse.21.a: "Damn it!"

 qielepcollapse.22.t: "Anqing Is Victorious!"
 qielepcollapse.22.d: "Governor Chen Tiaoyuan's troops, supported by our valiant forces, have entered Nanjing! While Marshal Qi and his German lackeys have fled, Chen has secured control over some of the territories peripheral to Anhui province. Our support in the war has also firmly aligned him within our sphere, and over the next few months we can fully bring him into our alliance."
 qielepcollapse.22.a: "Excellent!"

 qielepcollapse.23.t: "Nanjing Is Victorious!"
 qielepcollapse.23.d: "Marshal Qi Xieyuan's troops, supported by our valiant forces, have entered Anqing! While Governor Chen and his Fengtian lackeys have fled, Qi has re-asserted control over Anhui Province. Our support in the war has also aligned him within our sphere, and over the next few months we can fully bring him into our alliance, though we also have to manage Germany's influence over his regime."
 qielepcollapse.23.a: "Excellent!"

 qielepcollapse.24.t: "Refugees Flee League Chaos"
 qielepcollapse.24.d: "With widespread unrest sweeping the League of Eight Provinces, Governors Jin Yun'e of Henan and Xiao Yaonan of Hubei have reported increasing numbers of refugees flooding into their provinces. Although it started as a trickle, over the course of the last few days the flow dramatically increased, with whole families fleeing an explosion of violence and banditry. The governors have sent worrying telegrams after some of their men interviewed some of the refugees, indicating central authority within League has collapsed far more than previously thought. Furthermore, they have requested additional food and supplies to deal with the refugees."
 qielepcollapse.24.a: "Terrible news. Send the supplies."
 qielepcollapse.24.b: "Who cares?"

 qielepcollapse.25.t: "Bloodbath on the Yangtze!"
 qielepcollapse.25.d: "Despite their best efforts to deal with the influx of refugees, the governors of our southern provinces are overwhelmed. Following a province-wide declaration of martial law made in Hubei, Governor Xiao Yaonan ordered his troops to shut down all bridges and roads leading into the province from League territory, and denying entry to all refugees. A large number of them, however, began to mass at a bridge over the Yangtze River, demanding entry.\n\nWhile this started peacefully, it quickly escalated into a full-scale riot, as refugees began to pelt Xiao's troops with rocks, bottles, and other debris. Eventually, a group of men who had somehow armed themselves with stolen weapons began shooting at Xiao's troops, who responded by opening fire with machine-guns. Those not hit by the storm of bullets fled, stampeding other refugees and leaving their friends and family dead or dying on the bridge. This grisly scene is being repeated up and down our border with the League, as mobs of refugees have started to force their way into our territory."
 qielepcollapse.25.a: "Unfortunate news."

 qielepcollapse.26.t: "Southern Governors Cut Contact"
 qielepcollapse.26.d: "With violence in the League escalating daily, the governors of Yunnan and Guangdong, [YUN.GetLeader] and Chen Jiongming, have stopped responding to official government requests for information and updates on what is happening in their territory. They have long despised our government, and while this move is not unexpected, it represents a complete change in their official demeanour to our government. Many in Wu's inner circle fear that this heralds a complete collapse of our authority, and this morning news out of Shanxi confirms these worries.\n\nThe traitor Feng Yuxiang, holed up with his men in the hills of northern Shaanxi has formally denounced the actions of our government in what is now being termed the 'Yangtze Incident' earlier this week, when Governor Wang Huaiqing's forces fired upon a mob of refugees, and proclaimed that the Qing no longer had the 'capacity to rule China'. His nominal ally in Taiyuan, Governor Yan Xishan, has decried the violence but stopped short of condemning us or recognising the Fengtian Government, but it is clear the national order is breaking down."
 qielepcollapse.26.a: "Damnation!"

 qielepcollapse.27.t: "A Letter Of Thanks From Chen"
 qielepcollapse.27.d: "Governor Chen has written his sincere thanks to Marshal Wu Peifu, complimenting his Ministry in their dedication to Chinese solidarity. Governor Chen promises that his defence of Chinese sovereignty signals the end of Western interference in the Yellow River Valley, and lavishly affirmed Wu Peifu's belief in Chinese superiority over the AOG forces they face."
 qielepcollapse.27.a: "He is most welcome."

 qielepcollapse.28.t: "We Were Betrayed By Chen"
 qielepcollapse.28.d: "Despite Wu's best attempt to calm Governor Chen diplomatically, he now appears to be out of our reach. A border guard discovered refugees arriving in Qing lands carrying pamphlets from the infamous Japanese paramilitary Black Dragon Society. Now in the vacuum of silence from Anqing's leaders come more disturbing impressions. Governor Chen Yi, infamous for his association with the Black Dragons, has been spotted in Anqing by other refugees. It is highly likely that Governor Chen has betrayed not only Marshal Wu and Puyi, but the Chinese nation itself by allowing Japanese spies to enter his city."
 qielepcollapse.28.a: "Damn Japanese!"

 qielepcollapse.29.t: "Anqing Is Defeated!"
 qielepcollapse.29.d: "The valorous forces of Chen Tiaoyuan have been defeated in Anqing, and his provincial government destroyed. This is a dark day for our government, as many had pinned their hopes on."
 qielepcollapse.29.a: "Damn!"

 qielepcollapse.30.t: "Nanjing Is Defeated!"
 qielepcollapse.30.d: "We had all hoped that Qi Xieyuan would prove a valuable ally and would win the League War. However, disaster has struck and his government has collapsed, leaving our control and influence over the region in shambles. This is a dark day for our government."
 qielepcollapse.30.a: "Damn!"

 qielepcollapse.31.t: "Descent Into Anarchy!"
 qielepcollapse.31.d: "It would seem that the war situation has become untenable, and over a year of fighting has caused our forces to utterly collapse into anarchic bands, the central government in Beijing means therefore to sweep in and restore order!"
 qielepcollapse.31.a: "THAT'S IT, I'M RESTARTING!"

 qiecoup.1.t: "Whispers of Discontent"
 qiecoup.1.d: "In the weeks following Wu’s decision not to intervene in the LEP collapse, small groups from across the political spectrum began to gather in secret. Initially limited to criticising Wu’s inaction, the worsening violence in the streets led many to bring up revolt. Social networks between these groups have allowed a shaky coalition to develop. Comprised of Manchu nobles, cadets at the Baoding academy, reformers in the NCERA, and some Zhili generals annoyed at Wu’s inaction, this loose group has begun to speak clandestinely with one another and plot to overthrow Wu and restore the Emperor to some degree of power."
 qiecoup.1.a: "Keep an eye on this..."

 qiecoup.2.t: "A Clandestine Meeting"
 qiecoup.2.d: "In the basement of a shady Beijing bar, traditionally used as a cover for revolutionary activities, a strange coalition of individuals dedicated to overthrowing Wu Peifu and his rule over China has gathered. First is Pujie, the emperor's brother and a general in the Army, one of the few non-Zhili generals allowed to command significant numbers of troops. Next to him sits Y. C. James Yen, a leading intellectual and head of the NCERA. Across from him sits Xing Shilian, an army officer who has defected to the Zhili side in the 3rd ZhiFeng war, but has since become disgruntled at his lack of advancement under Wu Peifu.\n\nRealising that they are unable to beat the Zhili Clique on their own with their limited military resources, the plotters decide they must ask the leader of a neighbouring warlord clique for assistance. After much deliberation they choose..."
 qiecoup.2.a: "Yan Xishan in Shanxi."
 qiecoup.2.b: "[SQI.GetLeader] in Shandong."
 qiecoup.2.c: "There is no one to turn to..."

 qiecoup.3.t: "A Request to Governor Yan"
 qiecoup.3.d: "An unusual letter has arrived from a courier wearing Imperial robes this morning. Claiming to be a minor noble, this young man brings astonishing news. A group of Manchu princes, reformers, and disgruntled military officials are secretly plotting to overthrow Marshal Wu Peifu and restore Emperor Puyi! They are apparently seeking external aid and have come to Governor Yan Xishan for help. Their plan is audacious and the messenger could hardly conceal his excitement.\n\nNonetheless, Governor Yan is no stranger to bold moves, and across the three and a half decades of his rule he has seen plenty of such schemes fall flat. Several times in Beijing no less. With Feng Yuxiang already causing trouble in Yan'an and this plot only in its infancy, there is considerable risk in placing his weight behind this endeavour. At the very least, it will upend the fragile peace that has been struck between the Shanxi clique and the central government. But sometimes being bold is the only way to survive, and with the situation in Northern China in flux, perhaps there is no harm at least hearing them out."
 qiecoup.3.a: "We need more proof this plot will work."
 qiecoup.3.b: "Refuse outright. This is too risky."

 qiecoup.4.t: "A Request to Governor Qu"
 qiecoup.4.d: "An unusual letter has arrived from a courier wearing Imperial robes this morning. Claiming to be a minor noble, this young man brings astonishing news. A group of Manchu princes, reformers, and disgruntled military officials are secretly plotting to overthrow Marshal Wu Peifu and restore Emperor Puyi! They are apparently seeking external aid and have come to Governor Qu for help. How do we respond?"
 qiecoup.4.a: "Of course! For the glory of the Qing!"
 qiecoup.4.b: "Refuse. This is too risky."

 qiecoup.5.t: "A Request to Honoured Teacher Zhang"
 qiecoup.5.d: "An unusual letter has arrived from a courier wearing Imperial robes this morning. Claiming to be a minor noble, this young man brings astonishing news. A group of Manchu princes, reformers, and disgruntled military officials are secretly plotting to overthrow Marshal Wu Peifu and restore Emperor Puyi! They are apparently seeking external aid and have come to Honoured Teacher Zhang Tianran for help. How do we respond?"
 qiecoup.5.a: "Of course! For the glory of the Qing!"
 qiecoup.5.b: "Refuse. This is too risky."

 qiecoup.6.t: "Governor Yan's Response"
 qiecoup.6.d: "Governor Yan has replied to our request, in his usual charismatic but wily manner - showering gifts and charm upon the young messenger we sent to the extent observers would think him as another friendly old grandpa. But beneath that mask, the man asserted his dominance and cunning. Treating the noble like the many others who have come before him asking for a favour, his jovial demeanour thinly veiled his calculating nature as the decades-reigning \"Model Governor\" read his mark.\n\nBy the end of the meeting, as our representative quickly relayed a message home to his fellow conspirators in Beijing, the terms were unambiguous. Yan Xishan already holds a distinguished (if distrusted) position as a Governor within Wu Peifu's system, and he has little to gain backing our risky proposal unless we offer him something greater. Far greater. Although he took pains to never outright say it, it is clear that he expects full and autocratic powers if our plot does succeed.\n\nFurthermore, he expects proof that our plot can succeed, that it is something more than a pipe dream of spoiled aristocrats out of touch with political reality. Our messenger, despite playing the role of a naive appeaser, was quite percipient: he warns that although Yan is extremely ambitious, his ambition is tempered by his pragmatism. Still, it would be hard for a man like him to resist the tantalising prospect of national control. As we craft our response, it is critical that we reel in our target. The Governor can be mercurial as he is calculating, and what we say will likely determine his response."
 qiecoup.6.a: "Play on his ambition, emphasise his future role as \"Master of China\"."
 qiecoup.6.b: "Play on his fears of instability, emphasise the danger the Zhili pose."

 qiecoup.7.t: "The Plotters Promise Power"
 qiecoup.7.d: "We received a response from our contacts in Beijing, outlining their case for our support. In a secretive meeting attended by only Yan's select advisors, the message was read to the Governor. In it, the Manchu plotters, apparently backed by the Emperor himself, have bestowed upon us flowery praise and adulation as the heroic leader China needs to vanquish the treacherous Wu Peifu. They stress all the good that we could do for the Chinese nation, driving out the foreign imperialists and bringing the ideas we have developed in our \"Model Province\" nationwide. All of this, we would accept the role as Imperial Commissioner and Commander in Chief of the Imperial Army.\n\nThe letter continued on with extensive details of the preparations being made in Beijing, but by then the Governor had clearly made up his mind. A faint smile was on his face, which would have been unnoticeable if those present had not known him for years. More noticeable was the glean in his eyes, one clearly rapt with soaring ambitions. His advisors were quick to match his mood as the Governor took the time to think in silence, stressing the opportunities this coup will bring to at the very least cut the Zhili down to size, the need for stability across the Central Plains, the likelihood for the plot to succeed. At last, Yan put his hand up to silence them and made his opinion known:"
 qiecoup.7.a: "It was a happy day-dream, but no more than that."
 qiecoup.7.b: "When the nation calls, we shall rally to its banner!"

 qiecoup.8.t: "The Plotters Promise Stability"
 qiecoup.8.d: "We received a response from our contacts in Beijing, outlining their case for our support. In a secretive meeting attended by only Yan's select advisors, the message was read to the Governor. In it, the Manchu plotters, apparently backed by the Emperor himself, has painted a picture of a nation in peril - destabilised by the foolish leadership of the drunken Cao Kun and the scheming Wu Peifu. Without order, the nation will soon fall in anarchy, and the letter was very heavy in Confucian themes. In these times, a strong, wise hand must step up to the role of Imperial Commissioner to lead the armies of the Empire against those that would destroy it. That man, is the \"Model Governor\" of Shanxi, Yan Xishan.\n\nBefore any of his advisors could get a word in, all paid close attention to Yan's mood. The Governor had a dour expression as the room sat in silence, the cogs in his mind turning. All of his old retainers were quick to pick up upon what he wanted to hear as they began denouncing the letter - its lack of practicality, the instability it would cause, the risks it poses for our power, the hypocrisy of a foreign-imposed Emperor condemning Wu Peifu's collaboration with the Germans. Still with a contemplative expression, the Governor at least makes his opinion known:"
 qiecoup.8.a: "This plan is the idle talk of spoiled princes."
 qiecoup.8.b: "These princes need a wise hand to guide them."

 qiecoup.9.t: "Our Request was Refused!"
 qiecoup.9.d_yan: "Although our message was clear about the pressing national need for Governor Yan's intervention, his reply was nothing but a curt refusal and the prompt cutting of all contact between us and Taiyuan. Shanxi will not be coming to our aid, and they did not even have the decency to explain why. We can only guess however, in retrospect. It seems that the Governor has little faith in the ability of our coup to succeed, and he has quickly dismissed us as a group of spoiled aristocrats and dreamers. Instead, it appears that Shanxi will be retreating back into isolation, daring the Zhili to retaliate.\n\nWorse yet, it appears Wu Peifu has caught wind of these attempts through a disheartened plotter, who tipped off the Marshal following Yan's refusal. In his final message to us, the Governor made it clear that he will not be harbouring any of us in his province as fugitives, leaving us to our fate. Some speculate that we were betrayed to Wu Peifu by Yan himself, now washing himself of this situation. Not that it matters anyway, as our conspiracy collapses before our very eyes!"
 qiecoup.9.d_qu: "Despite his supposed monarchist sympathies, Governor Qu's reply was a blunt refusal. Citing the government's lack of assistance and his need to focus on riots in Shandong, it appears our coup has failed before it has even had the chance to begin!\n\nWorse yet, it appears Wu Peifu has caught wind of these attempts through a disheartened plotter, who tipped off the Marshal following Qu's refusal. In his final message to us, the Governor made it clear that he will not be harbouring any of us in his province as fugitives, leaving us to our fate. Some speculate that we were betrayed to Wu Peifu by Qu himself, now washing himself of this situation. Not that it matters anyway, as our conspiracy collapses before our very eyes!"
 qiecoup.9.d_zhang: "Honoured Teacher Zhang has refused our request! You should never see this unless you're playing MP and your friend is being a dick. Tough break buddy."
 qiecoup.9.a: "Damn it! We blew our one shot! Our one opportunity!"

 qiecoup.10.t: "Yan Accepts Our Offer"
 qiecoup.10.d: "After some deliberations, Governor Yan Xishan has announced his support for our cause in a humble message dedicating the resources of himself, his army and his province to the common Chinese national unification. Beneath this outwardly humble demeanor, however, it is clear that Yan is preparing to leverage his status as the muscle of our planned coup to ensure his own leadership of the nation - swapping out Wu Peifu for himself. Whether or not he will be any better than the previous tyrants we have served under and whether he will share his new found power will have to wait for another day as the preparations begin.\n\nIn northern Shaanxi and the neighbouring Shanxi province, Yan has assured us that he will enlist the support of Feng Yuxiang and his Guominjun. Nonetheless, he also emphasised that these radical traitors are nothing more than a means to an end. His own provincial army is amassing to our west, preparing to strike north of the Yellow River to quickly connect with our own forces. Already scouts are being sent out into eastern Shanxi and southern Shaanxi to destabilise Zhili control over the areas.\n\nWith the coup underway, the die has been cast. Either we will rid Beijing of these Zhili traitors once and for all, or we will meet our doom in their hands."
 qiecoup.10.a: "Let us hope this works!"

 qiecoup.11.t: "Qu Accepts"
 qiecoup.11.d: "Governor Qu has accepted the coup plotters request for aid. He agrees he will deploy his troops should the Zhili Clique not be fully destroyed in the coup. At the same time, however, he will probably demand concessions once Puyi has been restored to his proper position."
 qiecoup.11.a: "Excellent!"

 qiecoup.12.t: "Zhang Accepts"
 qiecoup.12.d: "Honoured Teacher Zhang has accepted the coup plotters request for aid. He agrees to deploy his troops should the Zhili Clique not be fully destroyed in the coup. At the same time, however, he will probably demand concessions once Puyi has been restored to his proper position."
 qiecoup.12.a: "Excellent!"

 qiecoup.13.t: "A Plot is Uncovered!"
 qiecoup.13.d: "A bizarre conspiracy has been revealed to Wu Peifu! Apparently a group of disgruntled Manchu princes, reformers, and Zhili generals have been clandestinely plotting to overthrow the Zhili Clique and restore Puyi to a position of power! A member of this plot grew disgruntled once their foreign backer reneged his support, and instead came to Wu, betraying his erstwhile allies.\n\nWu has already dispatched police to raid the safehouses where the plotters have been meeting, and arrested a confused Puyi, who was apparently unaware of any plot in the first place! President Cao Kun went before a stunned assembly where he announced the charges, before announcing his resignation in shame for failing to discover the plot. With the end of the Qing dynasty, Marshal Wu Peifu will act as a temporary "National Protector" until a new government can be assembled."
 qiecoup.13.a: "Long Live the National Protector!"

 qiecoup.14.t: "Purging Traitors"
 qiecoup.14.d: "With the Manchu aristocracy removed as a political force, the question now remains what to be done with the Manchu generals in our military. The obvious answer is imprisoning them, but then what about all the Zhili generals that sided with them? Several are quite skilled, and removing them from our officer pool would have consequences. Still, it would ensure loyalty going forward."
 qiecoup.14.a: "Only purge the Manchu nobles. The rest can be rehabilitated."
 qiecoup.14.b: "Purge them all!"

 qiecoup.15.t: "The Aftermath"
 qiecoup.15.d: "With the Manchu royalist plotters dealt with, we now need to turn our eyes to reconstructing our government. It won’t be easy, but a new set of laws needs to be drafted that rectifies the errors of the Beiyang Constitution, and ensures China will be properly guided through these turbulent years."
 qiecoup.15.a: "We need to create a legitimate government!"

 qiecoup.16.t: "Ominous Troop Movements"
 qiecoup.16.d_yan: "Unusual troop movements have been reported from Shanxi Province over the last few days. It appears the troops are preparing for some sort of military action on our border, with our informants reporting that supplies and equipment are being stockpiled near the mountain passes out of Shanxi. Further west, in the adjacent Shaanxi, Feng Yuxiang and his Guominjun have also been reported as active - once more the \"Traitor General\" dares to threaten us along with his coterie of socialist agitators. Like ghosts of our past, the two warlords once more come back to haunt us, having been bested by Wu Peifu's genius a few years ago during the Fourth Zhifeng War and Kuomintang Northern Expedition respectively.\n\nAn attack from them in these turbulent times to try and regain their lost lands in the north and west would not be out of character for the two, perhaps emboldened by the collapse of our allies to the south. Still, this is brazen, even for them. Both had seemed content to lick their wounds behind the natural fortress the Taihang and Luliang Mountains provide, festering in their pathetic squalor for decades in relative peace. Something definitely triggered this response, Cao Kun insists, it has to be. Although his poor treatment during his imprisonment by Feng Yuxiang no doubt contributes to his paranoia, perhaps he is on to something here."
 qiecoup.16.d_qu: "Unusual troop movements have been reported from Shandong Province over the last few days. It appears that large formations of troops are preparing for some sort of military action on our border, with our informants reporting that supplies and equipment are being stockpiled near the mountain passes out of the peninsula. Governor Qu technically swore fealty to us, but backstabbing is not unusual among warlords..."
 qiecoup.16.d_zhang: "Unusual troop movements have been reported from Shandong Province over the last few days. It appears that large mobs of Yiguandao militiamen are preparing for some sort of military action on our border, with our informants reporting that supplies and equipment are being stockpiled near the mountain passes out of the peninsula. Honoured Teacher Zhang Tianran of the Yiguandao certainly is no ally of the Zhili Clique, and an attack on our territory would not be out of the question for him."
 qiecoup.16.a: "What's going on here? Dispatch more spies to investigate this."
 qiecoup.16.b: "We have more pressing matters to attend to."

 qiecoup.17.t: "Devious Machinations!"
 qiecoup.17.d_yan: "Our informants have discovered a dangerous plot! It appears Yan Xishan and several Manchu princes, reformers, and traitorous generals are attempting to overthrow the Zhili Clique and install an imperial dictatorship (ostensibly) under Puyi! With the combined forces of the Shanxi Provincial Army and the Guominjun amassing along our border, it is essential that we dispatch of any fifth columnists within our government before outside forces strike. Any show of weakness will invite further challengers from the northeast and the south, dooming the efforts we have made for decades to stabilise our nation. A quick decisive strike against the treachery in Shanxi is the only way we can assert our authority in face of Sun Chuanfang's disaster. We march on Taiyuan!"

 qiecoup.17.a: "Arrest these plotters and prepare to invade Shandong!"
 qiecoup.17.b: "Arrest these plotters and prepare to invade Shanxi!"

 qiecoup.18.t: "Mysterious Occurrences"
 qiecoup.18.d: "Worrying news! It appears over the last few days anti-Zhili and anti-German pamphlets have been discovered distributed amongst some of our troops! When asked where they received this from, none were able to give a straight answer, with most saying it just appeared overnight.\n\nEven more worrying, several generals have dropped out of contact with Luoyang over the last few hours, Even worse, Baoding Military Academy appears to have been abandoned overnight, and communications with far-flung parts of the empire have been interrupted due to widespread radio and telephone outages."
 qiecoup.18.a: "What's going on here?"

 qiecoup.19.t: "A Summons to Beijing"
 qiecoup.19.d: "While Wu is attempting to process the alarming developments that have occurred over the last few days, an urgent telegram arrived from Beijing. Cao Kun and Wu have been summoned to a meeting with the Emperor over the state of the country. Widespread riots are still a daily occurrence, and while the Emperor technically has the constitutional prerogative to summon his President, this has never occurred. While Wu may sense a trap, Cao Kun has already informed the Emperor that he and Wu will present themselves to His Imperial Majesty later this week."
 qiecoup.19.a: "Damn you Cao Kun!"

 qiecoup.20.t: "Wu and Cao Prepare to Meet Puyi"
 qiecoup.20.d: "After arriving from Luoyang, Wu berated Cao for essentially inviting themselves into a trap. Still, the Jade Marshal is not one to go into a meeting like this without a trump card up his sleeve. As the two men prepare to enter the hall, Wu orders his bodyguards to wait outside the entrance to the chambers. The ceremonial bodyguards outside are unarmed except for traditional swords, and the Zhili soldiers have hidden pistols within their pockets..."
 qiecoup.20.a: "They enter the hall..."

 qiecoup.21.t: "Guards Rush into the Hall!"
 qiecoup.21.d: "As the two men enter and kneel before the emperor, around a dozen heavily armed Royal guards rush into the room! Surrounding the emperor, they move forward and attempt to arrest the two men, while Puyi flees the room! Upon hearing the commotion, Wu’s bodyguards outside quickly dispatch the ceremonial guards and rush in, while Wu and Cao duck behind pillars to avoid getting hit. Bullets fly back and forth among the ancient pillars of the hall, smashing priceless artefacts and wounding Cao Kun. When the bullets stop, however, one side emerges victorious."
 qiecoup.21.a: "Wu and Cao are killed! The coup succeeds!"
 qiecoup.21.b: "The Royal bodyguards lie dead on the ground!"

 qiecoup.22.t: "The Emperor Asserts Himself"
 qiecoup.22.d: "Puyi nervously re-enters the room, gazing down at the bullet-riddled bodies of the former Jade Marshal and his mentor, President Cao Kun. Pujie and another small group of Manchu loyalist guardsmen enter as well, all carrying submachine guns. ‘Dearest brother - I believe it’s time for you to make a speech.’ Puyi turns from the corpses and looks at Pujie. ‘I-’ he begins, his voice uncertain. ‘I am not sure if I can do that.’ Pujie is about to say something when General Xiqia bursts into the room.\n\n'My lord! The city is secure!’ He says, kowtowing almost to the ground facing Puyi. ‘But Jiang Baili and several other Zhili generals have retreated to Luoyang! They are planning to launch a campaign to destroy us and liberate Beijing!’ Pujie moves over to Puyi, and whispers in his ear. ‘You are the Emperor now - you must act like one!’ Puyi nervously attempts to gather himself. ‘I - the Xuantong Emperor, Son of Heaven, formally proclaim any members of the Zhili Clique who do not swear fealty to me by tomorrow no-’ His voice cracks, and he is forced to steady himself. ‘Who do not do so by tomorrow noon to be traitors to the Great Qing!’"
 qiecoup.22.a: "Death to Traitors!"

 qiecoup.23.t: "Honouring Our Obligation"
 qiecoup.23.d: "We have received word from Beijing that the coup plan has gone off without a hitch! Wu Peifu and Cao Kun were killed in a shootout in the Forbidden City, and Manchu generals and some Zhili who deserted are mobilising their forces to destroy those loyal to the old regime. It’s time to honour our obligation to the Emperor and destroy these traitors!"
 qiecoup.23.a: "Destroy the traitors!"

 qiecoup.24.t: "The Countercoup"
 qiecoup.24.d: "Following Cao and Wu’s narrow escape from death in the Throne Room, Wu’s bodyguards dispersed throughout the palace, gunshots echoing throughout the halls as they encounter sporadic Manchu loyalist resistance. A few minutes later, they burst back into the throne room, dragging a terrified Puyi with them. Wu, standing above the prostrated Puyi, gestures to a bodyguard. Drawing a pistol, he grabs Puyi behind him and leads him to the door. Outside, a small group of courtiers and hangers on have gathered, along with the Emperor’s brother, Pujie, and several other Qing nobles. Opening the door to the audience chamber, Wu steps forward, flanked by the Emperor and his captor.\n\n’Your plot has failed, traitors.’ He twists his mouth into a smirk, before gesturing the bodyguard to pull the emperor back into the room. ‘One step forward - and the Son of Heaven dies.’\n\nSecretly, Wu is terrified. But this will not be the first time he has cheated death. ‘You will all enter the throne room, where my guards will ensure you are watched over well. President Cao!’ he turns to the head of the Assembly, who at this point has retreated into the room himself. ‘Take some guards and get over to the Assembly chamber as fast as you can!’ He glances back at Puyi. ‘The time has come to end the Empire. China shall be a Republic once more.’\n\nA few hours later, once Zhili troops have raided the plotting rooms, documents are found implicating neighbouring warlords. Wu is quick to immediately declare them traitors, and mobilise his troops for war."
 qiecoup.24.a: "Death to Traitors!"

 qiecoup.25.t: "Victory!"
 qiecoup.25.d: "Reports have returned to the Imperial Palace that our troops have reached the Yellow River. The scattered Zhili garrisons around Beijing proved to be little match for the Baoding-led armies, and General Zaitao's Manchu loyalists assisted in harrying retreating Zhili troops as they attempted to flee to Luoyang. Many troops simply deserted to our forces, as the thought of serving a leaderless army with little concentrated political backing was unappealing.\n\nOur forces are now ready to begin an assault on Luoyang, Wu Peifu's old stronghold, currently being defended by forces under General Jiang Baili, Wu's second in command. Securing this fortress will be the beginning of the end for the Zhili Clique."
 qiecoup.25.a: "Long live the Son of Heaven!"

 qiecoup.26.t: "Victory in Luoyang!"
 qiecoup.26.d: "A telegram arrived this morning from Luoyang, confirming that our troops were victorious in storming the walls of the fortified city. Following hours of concentrated artillery bombardment, loyal troops crossed the river in impromptu barges, sustaining heavy fire. Once ashore, however, they quickly secured control over a beachhead, allowing more and more of our troops to land and begin attacking Zhili units garrisoned in the city. Fighting among the ancient grotto and temples that dot the city, our troops eventually stormed the Zhili headquarters. Most of the generals staff managed to escape, but several key leadership figures such as Jiang Baili have vanished, presumably dead among the throngs of thousands of other soldiers trapped in the burning city. Remaining Zhili troops have scattered throughout the surrounding countryside looting and pillaging even as they flee our forces."
 qiecoup.26.a: "Long live the Son of Heaven!"

 qiecoup.27.t: "Victory in the South!"
 qiecoup.27.d: "The last few weeks have seen intense fighting across the southern reaches of our territory, as the die-hard supporters of Wu Peifu and the Zhili Clique were hunted down and destroyed. Especially vicious was the fighting on all routes leading in to Wuhan, as the last remnants of the Zhili Command prepare to organise a desperate last-stand in the ancient city. With the isolated garrisons destroyed, we can turn our eyes on securing this city and destroying the Zhili once and for all."
 qiecoup.27.a: "Long live the Son of Heaven!"

 qiecoup.28.t: "Victory in Wuchang!"
 qiecoup.28.d: "In a final all-out assault our forces, bolstered by ranks of Zhili deserters, finally stormed Wuhan, destroying the remaining Zhili forces and capturing or killing many senior Zhili generals. With victory finally secured, we can now start to focus on rebuilding our country, and rearing it from both the ravages of the conflict we just endured and the decades of rampant corruption we were subjected to under the Zhili."
 qiecoup.28.a: "Long live the Son of Heaven!"

 qiecoup.29.t: "Prosperity League Dissolves!"
 qiecoup.29.d: "Following our recent upheavals, the Prosperity League has abruptly dissolved, citing a 'hostile atmosphere', with many of their prominent lobbyists leaving for Tianjin. While the German legation remains in Beijing, they have cut themselves off from any government contact, robbing us of German military and industrial support. The people, however are overwhelmingly in favour of this move, and are praising the new government for ridding itself of foreign influences."
 qiecoup.29.a: "We don't need them!"

 qiecoup.30.t: "Blood in the Water"
 qiecoup.30.d: "With the capital set ablaze in anti-Zhili and anti-foreigner violence it's become clear that even the very heart of the Qing Empire is faltering. Caught unawares the Fengtian government in Shenyang will order an all out offensive in our time of greatest weakness. Under no circumstances must our men on the border flinch in the face of Fengtian forays along the border."
 qiecoup.30.a: "Man the borders, Zuolin must not be allowed in."

 qiecoup.31.t: "Our Allies Send Aid!"
 qiecoup.31.d: "Our noble ally has sent us a great deal of money to help defeat the traitorous Zhili remnants hiding in the south!"
 qiecoup.31.a: "Thank you!"

 qiecoup.32.t: "The Qing Elections of [GetYear]"
 qiecoup.32.d: "The time has come for the long-promised elections, since the turmoil of the provisional government following the Manchu Coup has finally eased into political stability. While there are of course multiple political parties running, the only real contender is the [ROOT.GetRulingParty], in light of their clear successes in reforming Chinese politics and restoring our nation's greatness. While there might be a few accusations of corruption, that'd hardly be a novelty for China, and can anyone deny that the [ROOT.GetRulingParty] deserve another victory?"
 qiecoup.32.a: "The peasants prevail once again!"
 qiecoup.32.b: "The YCP still has the best interests of China at heart."
 qiecoup.32.c: "The Aristocracy is clearly capable."
 qiecoup.32.e: "Let's see the results of our years of preparations."

 qiecoup.33.t: "The Last Qing Elections?"
 qiecoup.33.d: "Clearly, the [ROOT.GetRulingParty] has proved triumphant over all obstacles in its path to reunite, reform and re-assert China's greatness. They only needed one more election to consolidate their power over the renewed Qing Empire!"
 qiecoup.33.a: "China requires a firmer hand before democracy can truly blossom."
 qiecoup.33.b: "Only the party can lead the nation!"
 qiecoup.33.c: "The nobles will continue to guide China for centuries more!"
 qiecoup.33.e: "The NCERA and Yiguandao bring about a benevolent Empire!"
 qiecoup.33.f: "Nobility and Peasantry restore harmony to the Empire!"

 qiecoup.34.t: "The New Order"
 qiecoup.34.d: "With the regime solidified we find ourselves not a party to be compromised and haggled with, but obeyed and grovelled to. This has not gone unnoticed in the Assembly either; already, party officials outside the [QIE.GetRulingParty] have either been cowed into silence or brought on board into the new ruling order of the day."
 qiecoup.34.a: "The NCERA already bend the knee."
 qiecoup.34.b: "The YCP are wise to respect our guiding hand."
 qiecoup.34.c: "The Zongshe know working with us is their only way to maintain relevance."
 qiecoup.34.e: "As the Assembly submits to our authority, so too does the Middle Kingdom!"

 #Zongshe were allied prior
 qieelection.1.t: "Elections shake up the Assembly!"
 qieelection.1.d: "After years of preparations due to the diligent efforts of Qu Yingguang and James Yen the Assembly swells with newly elected members after nearly 4 years of being a rump political body and decades without a true popular mandate. As the newly elected Assemblymen take their seats in Beijing a new governing coalition may need to take shape to more accurately reflect the will of the people. While the NCERA has a clear electoral victory compared to their competitors a broader coalition could still be in the cards in hopes to secure a stable transition for this newborn democracy.\n\nAmong the victorious members of the NCERA there is a consensus forming that they may in fact be the only force keeping democratic values alive in the empire and wish to close ranks to keep out any authoritarian tendencies in the ruling government.\n\nThe Zongshe, meanwhile, contend that they would make for a steady right hand as the country is brought into the broader world. Emphasising both their private and foreign connections as well as the burgeoning growth of a homegrown industrial class under their auspices; the Zongshe promise that a level of cooperation with industrialists and the old guard will ensure a smooth transition into orderliness and prosperity across the empire.\n\nSurprisingly the Young China Party had a surge in the polls as the election drew near, clearly showing their message of a stronger more centralised China focused on more radical modernisation and centralisation has a growing appeal in the war-torn provinces weary of warlords and division."

As China embraces modernity the nobility find themselves increasingly stripped of influence in a true democracy.\n\nSurprisingly the Young China Party had a surge in the polls as the election drew near, clearly showing their message of a stronger more centralised China focused on more radical modernisation and centralisation has a growing appeal in the war-torn provinces weary of warlords and division. They seek to legitimise their gains by formally joining a ruling coalition if it means the Chinese state can more closely align with their beliefs."
 qieelection.2.a: "The NCERA pulls away from the right establishing a constitutional front!"
 qieelection.2.b: "A deal is struck with the YCP promising greater centralisation for the vast empire."

 qieelection.3.t: "The Qing Elections of [GetYear] A New Era in Politics"
 qieelection.3.d: "Constitutional reform has been met with approval by many progressives lauding the expansion of rights and improving the efficiency of the government while also satisfying the Manchu nobility for preserving the institutional authority of the Emperor. In the countryside, Yan Yangchu and Liang Shuming have launched successful literacy campaigns among the peasantry that has improved access to education and rebuild village connections across the Empire. Reforms in the countryside have also significantly reduced the strain on Imperial bureaucracy by promoting local autonomy. Somewhat ironically, this strategy of political decentralisation has seemingly improved the cohesion of the Empire.\n\nThis democratic renaissance has caused the influence of the Zongshe to dwindle to the point of political irrelevance. As calls for reform grow louder the old guard conservatives find themselves increasingly out of touch and incapable of providing meaningful policy. Constantly undermined and quieted in any political discourse; their light clearly no longer illuminates the halls of power.\n\nThe last four years have also given rise to different voices in politics. One of the loudest is the Chinese Youth Party. The YCP are politically conservative with an emphasis on Chinese tradition, but stress the need for mass mobilisation and class collaboration, with the citizen as the foundation of a new Chinese society. Their literature and party branches have started cropping up in nearly every corner of the Empire, with particular focus in major cities and universities. Since the restoration of Imperial authority they have made significant inroads among many urban intellectuals, student organisations, and even high profile military officers. They are now poised to make their way into the Government. Allowing them into our Coalition can certainly prove useful in expanding our appeal to the urban masses and military. Though we might consider as well maintaining our focus in the countryside as the basis of our national reconstruction efforts."
 qieelection.3.a: "The Empire is committed to our present strategy in the countryside"
 qieelection.3.b: "The Youths will help inspire and reforge the Empire with their bold vision!"

 qieelection.4.t: "[GetYear] Elections - Choosing a vision for a New China"
 qieelection.4.d: "The last four years have proven to be quite productive for all members of the ruling coalition. Together in the Assembly a series of reforms have been passed with the term 'New China' characterising these efforts - a vision of rebirth, prosperity, and healing in contrast to the devastation of the last century. Meanwhile, the governing parties began to fissure in pursuit of their own agendas throughout Chinese society.\n\nIn the countryside, Liang Shuming's rural reconstruction efforts have begun to pay dividends; the new schools are producing many graduates who take what they've learned back to their villages and greatly heightening the quality of peasant life in the process. Schools and economic cooperatives are proving much more successful than previous state-run efforts. Furthermore, rural militia training and reorganisation has led to successful defences against ever-decreasing numbers of bandit attacks. Vast improvements to the welfare of the peasantry are expected if these programmes continue.\n\nThe China Youth Party has also taken the initiative to spread their platform of mass mobilisation to the towns and cities. Rallies and student organisations promote the YCP's 'Plebiscitarian Politics' nationwide; drawing in intellectuals, university students, and even the urban working class. Party Membership has also soared among National Army officers ever since the YCP put together new patriotic curricula at the Dongbei military academy. Altogether this has greatly enhanced the YCP's efforts in creating a new socially and politically mobilised Chinese citizen.\n\nWith a New China being born and the coalition drifting apart, the electorate must now decide between these two visions of the future. Will the NCERA prevail, rebirthing China anew from the traditional villages and country towns? Or will the YCP's methods of political and ideological mobilisation in the cities, universities, and army provide new lifeblood for the Chinese nation in the form of the citizen?"
 qieelection.4.a: "The NCERA will birth the Chinese nation anew in the countryside."
 qieelection.4.b: "The YCP's new Chinese citizen will be the foundation of our revived nation."

 qieelection.5.t: "Mapping out the Electorate"
 qieelection.5.d: "In any democratic state the importance of representation cannot be understated. Where exactly these representatives come from and what blocs of people end up electing them into office is a very important detail though. We will have to direct the Assembly to meticulously revise the voting districts if we want to move forward with our reforms."
 qieelection.5.a: "The Assembly will have to hash this out detail by detail."
 qieelection.5.b: "Gerrymandering is a very normal part of the democratic process!"

 qieelection.6.t: "Polling Infrastructure Needs"
 qieelection.6.d: "The actual mechanics of a functioning democracy are quite demanding for a nation as large as China. Across the land people have to be informed of their rights, the election parameters, the candidates running, the actual election locations themselves, and of course, we will have to collect the votes to be counted. Such a massive undertaking will require the government to invest a substantial amount of time and money to turn these lofty ideals into something that can actually be useful to the state."
 qieelection.6.a: "The people need access to the levers of power."
 qieelection.6.b: "Our limited treasury should be focused on military matters."
 qieelection.6.c: "The polling stations will be party strongholds."

 qieelection.7.t: "Empowering the Local Assemblies"
 qieelection.7.d: "As it stands, the local assemblies serve no function other than figureheads the populace can elect. If given more relevant power in their jurisdictions they could prove to be a vector of relief for the overburdened bureaucracy in Beijing.\n\nIf we have secured the loyalty of the rural villages we can rest assured in the knowledge that local democracy won't crop up subversive elements into the national government."
 qieelection.7.a: "Elections are called in regional governments within our territory"
 qieelection.7.b: "Appoint competent candidates from the capital for an eventual smooth transition."

 qieelection.8.t: "Results of Electoral Reforms"
 qieelection.8.d: "For decades China has had multiple attempts at implementing democracy across the country. Both Republican and Imperial attempts at implementing such reforms have descended into palpable corruption, bloody insurrection, or toothless rubber-stamps for their lords on high. After more than a year of concerted government attention on reforming the process of electoral politics, Qu Yingguang oversees the last touches to his revision of democracy in the heartland. Now he can only look on to see if his own efforts for Chinese democracy will prove to be the beginning of something greater or just another folly attempt in service of a corrupt authoritarian regime."
 qieelection.8.a: "The work of a lifetime still lies ahead of us."
 qieelection.8.b: "What seeds have we sown for our people."

 qiefocus.1.t: "Chinese New Year: Rat"
 qiefocus.1.d: "In a long, somewhat rambling speech to mark the Chinese New Year, Assembly President Cao Kun addressed the need to restore the glory of the Qing Empire, unite the country, and repay the debt burdening the economy. He laid out a three point plan: Government subsidies and tax cuts would be given to light manufacturing industries, farmers would be granted tax cuts to grow edible plants instead of cash crops, and an increased tax on provincial governors."
 qiefocus.1.a: "The speech is met with polite applause"

 qiefocus.2.t: "Emergency Meeting of the Zhili"
 qiefocus.2.d: "Following the collapse of the League to the south we have gathered nearly all senior Zhili-aligned military officers in Luoyang. As the meeting starts, Marshal Wu Peifu opens with a short statement.\n\n'Fellow soldiers - the time has come. With the collapse of the League we are - for the first time since the Zhifeng war - in a precarious situation. Every choice we make over the next few weeks will determine the outcome of China for decades to come.'\n\n'I would like to remind some' he says, glancing at the more hawkish members of the assembly 'that intervention is not necessarily the most sound course of action. We need to weigh our options first before committing.'\n\nThe various generals nod in agreement, and begin a series of discussions on the best course of action."
 qiefocus.2.a: "We need to be careful..."

 qiefocus.3.t: "New Elections"
 qiefocus.3.d: "Our decision to support the Anqing government has been met with great support and approval from the population. In response, Marshal Wu has 'persuaded' Assembly President Cao Kun to declare a national election to capitalise on our new support. Theoretically all literate men in China are eligible to participate, but local warlords, widespread chaos in the League, and other issues means that we only expect results from areas under our direct control. Previous elections have seen razor-thin margins, and while the body is largely powerless a buffer in the number of seats under our control will bolster our legitimacy in the long run."
 qiefocus.3.a: "Schedule the elections"

 qiefocus.4.t: "Drafting a New Constitution"
 qiefocus.4.d: "Following the overthrow of the Qing Empire, Wu Peifu assembled a group of constitutional and legal scholars to help him create a new government for China. Holding the city of Beijing gave him some level of legitimacy, and the military power he possesses gives any document he chooses to adopt force behind it.\n\nWith the question of legitimacy solved, the pressing question Wu has to answer is the form of the constitution. In order to save time and expedite the centralisation of China, he could simply adopt the last non-monarchist constitution of China, the 1923 one created by President Cao Kun. This, however, is rife with loopholes, opportunities for executive abuse, and other problems. Wu and the scholars he has assembled could draft their own constitution, though this would take time and political capital."
 qiefocus.4.a: "Re-adopt Cao Kun's old constitution"
 qiefocus.4.b: "Draft a new constitution"

 qiefocus.5.t: "Power of the Executive"
 qiefocus.5.d: "The first issue confronting Wu's constitutional scholars is the level of power the executive should possess. It is unsaid, of course, that Wu and the Zhili Clique will guide the executive through these trying times, but once China is unified there is a general understanding that Wu's government will (gradually) transition into some form of democracy.\n\nWith that being said, a strong executive guarantees stability, while an empowered legislative body is better at generating political capital and clout."
 qiefocus.5.a: "Ensure the executive has strong authority"
 qiefocus.5.b: "Ensure the legislature has strong authority"

 qiefocus.6.t: "The Issue of Autonomy"
 qiefocus.6.d: "The next issue facing Wu's constitutional assembly is the level of autonomy for the provinces. Previous republican governments often came into conflict with the provincial administrations, and this - in part - lead to the current situation in China. Strong centralisation, on the other hand, ensures that orders issued by Beijing are followed better."
 qiefocus.6.a: "Allow the provinces some autonomy"
 qiefocus.6.b: "Keep it centralised"

 qiefocus.7.t: "Drafting Is Complete!"
 qiefocus.7.d: "After many hours spent hunched over desks writing and arguing over the legal minutia, we have a new constitution! Wu and the Zhili Clique will ensure that the new government is stable for the first few years of its existence, but once China is reunified many scholars are hopeful China can begin a transition into a real democracy."
 qiefocus.7.a: "Now all we need is a president!"

 qiefocus.8.t: "Selecting a President"
 qiefocus.8.d: "Despite being one of the foremost military minds in China, Wu Peifu's skills are not well-suited to the halls of government. Already, he fears military matters are falling to the wayside due to his duties as 'National Protector', and has ordered that the scholars drafting the constitution come up with a list of potential new presidents for the Republic. Two candidates have emerged: Scholar and intellectual Hu Shih, and diplomat and (briefly) former president V. K. Wellington Ku (Gu Weijun).\n\nHu is well-known for his theory of 'pragmatism' (shíyànzhuyì), a concept first originating in the United States in the 1870s and 80s. In Hu's writings, he advocates for cooperation with warlords and working to change the Chinese government from the inside-out, instead of ripping it down and rebuilding it like many in the KMT. Following the failure of the Northern Expedition this theory has gained many adherents, and is quite popular in academic circles.\n\nWellington Koo, on the other hand, is a diplomatic genius and politician, who attended the Versailles conference in 1919 as an observer, and helped negotiate several deals with American, German, and British diplomats, giving him a dearth of diplomatic experience that will no doubt be useful in legitimising our government."
 qiefocus.8.a: "Wu selects Hu Shih"
 qiefocus.8.b: "Wu selects Wellington Koo"

 qiefocus.9.t: "Inaugurating the New Republic"
 qiefocus.9.d: "In an elaborate ceremony today, Wu Peifu oversaw the swearing in of the new President of the Republic to adoring cheers. The assembly remains firmly in the hands of the Harmony Association, and many still question the legitimacy of this new regime. Still, Wu no longer has to contend with the Qing aristocracy as a potential opponent, and can instead concentrate on fixing the massive debt issues facing China, and starting to re-unify the fractured country.\n\nAdditionally, despite our best efforts to present our government as the legitimate government of China, few see us that way. We will need to either destroy or coerce the groups that oppose our regime, and convince the general population we are the true government of China!"
 qiefocus.9.a: "Congratulations, Mr. President!"

 qiefocus.10.t: "Debt and Legitimacy"
 qiefocus.10.d: "The debt issue continues to interfere with our economic efforts, and impedes our attempts to reinforce the legitimacy of our new government. While we could ask Germany for support, it is likely that this will cause our already unpopular government to collapse under public pressure. The much more shrewd plan is to take an anti-concession stance, defaulting on our debt but earning us the loyalty of our population."
 qiefocus.10.a: "Default. It's the only choice."

 qiefocus.11.t: "The Future of the Zhili Clique"
 qiefocus.11.d: "The Zhili Clique, like every other warlord clique in China, operates primarily on a basis of seniority and on mentor-mentee relationships. While (usually) providing stability and helping reduce the possibility of back-stabbing, also stifles meritocracy and promotions based on skill. With the recent deaths and advancing age of many senior generals, however, we may be forced to take drastic action, and promote younger officers to the forefront of our military.\n\nFour candidates have emerged for elevation to the full general corps: Guo Jijiao, Wang Lingyun, Du Xijun and Wei Yisan."
 qiefocus.11.a: "Promote these promising young men! Now to start our defence plan."

 qiefocus.12.t: "A Defence Plan for China"
 qiefocus.12.d: "Following Wu Peifu’s call for a meeting of senior Zhili generals, a large number have arrived in Luoyang, leaving their subordinates in charge of front-line duties. The first pressing concern is picking a centralised defence strategy for the inevitable war with Japan and the Fengtian government. The northern traitor’s growing boldness in the wake of the League collapse has alarmed many senior commanders, including Jiang Baili and Liu Menggeng. The two men have spent the last few weeks codifying plans they have been developing over the last two years and have presented them to the assembled Zhili commanders. Jiang’s focuses on large-scale defensive fortifications, moving industry to the interior of China, and rousing the ‘fighting spirit’ of China in order to defeat Japan.\n\nWhile not a direct opposite to Jiang’s plan, Liu’s plan focuses more on improving the fighting capability of Zhili troops. Improved morale, drill standards, and logistical support are key, at least in his eyes, of ensuring Chinese victory. Updated medical care also plays a crucial part of the strategy. Both are compelling plans, but it is up to Wu Peifu to ultimately decide."
 qiefocus.12.a: "Let's see..."

 qiefocus.13.t: "Position of the Emperor"
 qiefocus.13.d: "As we begin to reorganise the state following the fall of the vile Zhili clique, the rump Assembly is calling for the monarchy's role to be enshrined more directly in the legal framework. There is general consensus among many in court that the Emperor's position can only be maintained with a strict adherence to non-intervention in matters of state policy. However, there is also a small but vocal minority, particularly among ideologues of the late Kang Youwei, calling for the safeguarding of Imperial prerogative if the Assembly finds itself deadlocked in a state of crisis."
 qiefocus.13.a: "We need a ruler above the fray of politics."
 qiefocus.13.b: "The Assembly should have a guiding hand if the need arises."

 qiefocus.14.t: "Rebuilding our Command Structure"
 qiefocus.14.d: "Following the purge of many senior members of the Zhili Clique, our army has been left without much of a command structure. It has fallen on the two Aisin-Gioro princes, the Emperor's uncle Zaitao and his younger brother Pujie, to reform the Imperial command structure. This will not be an easy task, as Wu and his cronies essentially did away with a modern divisional structure based on meritocratic promotion in favour of cronyism and nepotism. While their reforms will take time to implement, in the meantime they have called to request the aid of Zhang Yinwu, giving him a commission. Yinwu, a former general of Yan Xishan's Jin army who returned to his home province of Zhili following the defeat of Shanxi's forces against the Zhili clique in the fourth Zhifeng War, since then he has worked in positions such as officer training, and it has also been said he was involved with organising guerrilla activities to weaken the back of Zhili lines. He is also rumoured to be involved in some capacity with the Young China Party, though where his true loyalties lie is currently uncertain."
 qiefocus.14.a: "Excellent"

 qiefocus.15.t: "Imperial City Shuffle"
 qiefocus.15.d: "Political machinations are brewing within the imperial capital, on levels unseen since the dissolution of the rump Anfu Parliament in 1920. Alongside the military and bureaucratic vacuums left behind by the fall of the Zhili military-political apparatus, new contenders are emerging from the political voids to try their hands at a power grab, long since monopolized by the Zhili and their underlings. By now, several political organisations have consolidated their programmes and standings with the public and legislature, which we can now also identify.\n\nThe Zongshe, or Royalist Party is the newest to the scene, but by no means are they underprepared against their opponents. Composed mainly of Manchu aristocrats and even members of the Aisin-Gioro family. In theory, the Zongshe is made up of the sternest loyalists to the Emperor and his cause, with some observers pointing out parallels between them and the Imperial faction behind the Meiji Restoration.\n\nThe Young China Party is considered by some to be the greatest wildcard in the race for power. As opposed to imperial veneration or rural reconstruction, the Young China Party, like their namesake, wants to fundamentally reshape the concept of a Chinese nation-state. Thus, their programme is perhaps the most far-reaching of the three groups, calling for a fundamental restructuring of society and redefining the role of the imperial state as a guiding hand in the development of the nation.\n\nThe New Chinese Empire Reform Association represents the last, but not least of the main contenders for power. Unlike the YCP or Zongshe, the NCERA is not a single party but a larger alliance of two political blocs, the Constitutionalist Party led by Xu Qin and Liang Shuming's Rural Reconstruction Movement. The former has emerged as the dominant partner, thanks to its deep-rooted lineage tracing back to reformist elements before the Wuchang Uprising. To bolster their cause, Xu Qin is also widely considered a direct heir of Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao. For now, the two groups are united in their advocacy for continuation and furthering of pre-Republican reforms initiated under Cixi and Zaifeng."
 qiefocus.15.a: "But who will come out on top?"

 qiefocus.16.t: "The Uneasy Coalition"
 qiefocus.16.d: "While all of the reformist parties were formally united in their desire to overthrow the Zhili, now that the dust has settled following the coup they find themselves in an uneasy position. Japan and the Fengtian loom large, and they must work together in order to avoid annihilation. Yet at the same time the different reform groups have differing goals and objectives, and varying things they can contribute to the military. Puyi and his advisors need the support of each of the parties and their military wings to win the eventual war with Japan, but doing so will come at a cost..."
 qiefocus.16.a: "This is still better than the Zhili."

 qiefocus.17.t: "The Yellow Sand Society"
 qiefocus.17.d: "In addition to the Rural Defence Forces employed by the NCERA, the Yellow Sands Society, an esoteric sect with connections to the Yiguandao, have offered to join our army. They are fierce fighters, and relatively loyal given our new anti-concession stance, but some fear accepting their offer to join our army will allow the Yiguandao yet another opportunity to infiltrate as well."
 qiefocus.17.a: "Offer them a place in the army."
 qiefocus.17.b: "No, this is too risky."

 qiefocus.18.t: "The Emergency Government"
 qiefocus.18.d.zhang: "Active fighting in Beijing has finally subsided, with the last Zhili holdouts finally laying down their weapons after fending off assault after assault by the Imperial Guard. The Second Manchu Restoration stands victorious where Zhang Xun and his loyalists had faltered. The struggle, however, is far from over. While a superficial peace returns to Beijing, across the Empire, violence and chaos continues to be the order of the day.\n\nTaking down Cao Kun and Wu Peifu was the most important part of the Restoration Plot. So important, in fact that we only spared afterthought for what to do once the Zhili crumbled. This neglect is now coming to haunt us, as administrative paralysis and military breakdown grapples the nation. We broke the military-bureaucratic backbone that the two masters of the Zhili Clique had built, yet now find ourselves floundering to fill in the void left behind.\n\nFortunately, we are not alone. The Xuantong Emperor and his officials are convening a closed assembly of plotters and activists who were directly involved with, or supported the Manchu Coup through other means. This assembly is mandated to form a government of national salvation or an emergency cabinet in order to assist in stabilising our current domains. The three largest groups to participate in the assembly would be the Youths of the Young China Party, the New Chinese Empire Reform Association and the Zongshe, or the Royalist Party. Although each provided crucial assistance in toppling the Zhili, these three are fundamentally at odds when it comes to their post-Restoration plans.\n\nAt the end of the day, however, the Assembly must answer to the man who holds the gun. In this case, Honoured Master Zhang Tianran has professed his outright scorn of the Youths, much to their despair and consternation. Therefore, the other two contenders are fighting not just for a majority in this closed assembly, but also the approval of the Honoured Master with honeyed promises of rural reform or traditionalist revival."

The few observers allowed in to monitor assembly proceedings expected Yan Xishan to align with the YCP, owing to many parallels between their programmes and visions for a modern China. So far, however, Governor Yan has remained mostly neutral. Rumours abound of a backroom race between the three groups for the governor's favour but it still remains to be seen which of the three will win Yan over."
 qiefocus.18.a: "Favour the Zongshe Party."
 qiefocus.18.b: "Favour the YCP."
 qiefocus.18.c: "Favour the NCERA."

 qiefocus.19.t: "Fall of the Zongshe"
 qiefocus.19.d: "Whether by imprecise political manoeuvre or sheer incompetence the Zongshe party has found itself completely stripped of all influence from government proceedings. Time and again we have been overruled and outmanoeuvred in administrative policy to the point that our positions are held in name-only. With this embarrassing demise just about complete, it's clear a new party will need to take over stewardship of the empire- if only to save it from the folly of aristocratic machinations."
 qiefocus.19.a: "The New Chinese Empire Reform Association will take the reins of power more seriously."
 qiefocus.19.b: "The Young China Party will surely be less incompetent."

 qiefocus.20.t: "Kuomintang Sympathies Suspected"
 qiefocus.20.d: "As the guerillas turned National Revolutionary Army campaign in the south a steadily rising fear has begun to grip the Assembly in Beijing. With the regime still being in it's infancy many among the YCP and Zongshe have openly called for a crackdown on suspected leftists in the empire. Thousands of miles away from any Kuomintang heartland it's clear the real target of this vitriol is the NCERA, more specifically, the Rural Reconstruction Movement which makes up half of the NCERA coalition. Certainly it is true the organisation existed before the restoration of the Qing and there were ties between it and many republicans, but it's clear that this move towards punitive action is a dagger pointed towards domestic opponents."
 qiefocus.20.a: "Keep tabs on anyone with suspected ties."
 qiefocus.20.b: "Investigate the Rural Reconstruction Movement thoroughly."
 qiefocus.20.c: "A thorough purge will safeguard the Empire."

 qiefocus.21.t: "Yiguandao Contributions"
 qiefocus.21.d: "In the wake of the Honoured Master the Qing dynasty is finding its standing with the people renewed and reaffirmed. Recently Zhang Tianran has become further emboldened in his attempts to bind the court to the Yiguandao ever closer. In return for more Imperial appointments of the faithful the Yiguandao will perform ever grander service to the Emperor as a sign of their submission. While the state comes to rely on the Yiguandao, perhaps so shall the Yiguandao come to rely on the state."
 qiefocus.21.a: "Labour for our infrastructure projects would be incredibly helpful."
 qiefocus.21.b: "We should have a second coronation to show the people our own commitment to renewal."
 qiefocus.21.c: "Deputise the militias as a permanent irregular force within the military."
 qiefocus.21.e: "The People should rest easy knowing the Emperor will protect them."

 qiefocus.22.t: "A New Coronation"
 qiefocus.22.d: "An unusual idea has been circulating among the Qing nobility over the last few weeks - organising a second coronation for Puyi. They claim that since the Restoration of 1927 was carried out under the supervision of the Zhili Clique it was not really 'proper' and that a new reinstating ceremony must be carried out in order to appease the traditions of the empire. The cost for this would be staggeringly high, but it may give us some legitimacy, and will earn us further support from the nobles."
 qiefocus.22.a: "Organise the ceremony!"
 qiefocus.22.b: "We will make it a massive celebration for the capital!"

 qiefocus.23.t: "The Dynasties Arrive"
 qiefocus.23.d: "Over the last few days the Marquis of Extended Grace, Duke Minsheng, and other various descendants of old Imperial dynasties have arrived in Beijing. One by one they file past the Emperor, silently bowing to pay their respects. In a novel first, a court photographer has been tasked with capturing each of these submissions, and they will be distributed as propaganda to both prove the legitimacy of the Emperor, and erode any support for a non-Aisin Gioro ruling family."

 qiefocus.24.t: "Our New Benefactor"

 qiefocus.25.d: "Following our victory over Fengtian and the Japanese, senior Zhili diplomats are now considering the best course of action in regards to our continued relationship with [GER.GetName]. While we are far away from Europe, we may still be able to negotiate a treaty of cooperation and protection. However, other senior officials are arguing we should focus inward on rebuilding our war-ravaged nation."
 qiefocus.25.a: "Request a guarantee of independence."
 qiefocus.25.b: "Focus on rebuilding China instead."

 qiefocus.26.t: "A Request from Beijing"
 qiefocus.26.d: "The ambassador from the Qing Empire has formally requested to join the Reichspakt. This is an interesting opportunity - they could be a powerful ally in the East, having already bested the Fengtian Government and the Japanese Empire. At the same time though, they could drag us into wars far from home we care little about."
 qiefocus.26.a: "Grant them entry."
 qiefocus.26.b: "Refuse. They are a liability."

 qiefocus.27.t: "A Request from Beijing"
 qiefocus.27.d: "The ambassador from the Qing Empire has formally requested a guarantee of independence from us. This is an interesting opportunity - they were instrumental in defeating Japan, and this would not be binding for any of their aggressive wars."
 qiefocus.27.a: "Sign the guarantee."
 qiefocus.27.b: "Refuse. They are a liability."

 qiefocus.30.t: "Converting Baoding Military Cadets"
 qiefocus.30.d: "Our men have managed to infiltrate the various military academies within our lands, seeking to bring the promising upcoming generation of young Chinese to the rightful path of the Yiguandao."
 qiefocus.30.a: "Promote the promising candidates."

 qiefocus.31.t: "German Railway Engineers"
 qiefocus.31.d: "Modernity does not come quickly enough for China to resist roving warlords nor overt imperialism from the west and Japan. These facts won't prevent our demand for a more perfect system, while the public decries our work with German companies and capital it is clear these industrial tools will pave the way for a more solid foundation for the empire.\n\nAs we look to further expand our iron and steel arteries across the countryside German engineering continues to guide the way, but how far we take this relationship is a constantly embattled question on the minds of the civilian government."
 qiefocus.31.a: "Contract them for massive infrastructure projects"
 qiefocus.31.b: "Guarantee contracts for major railway projects to be developed."
 qiefocus.31.c: "Maintain them purely as consultants working with Chinese management."

 qiefocus.32.t: "Tianjin Conference"
 qiefocus.32.d: "Events in Beijing happened quickly these last few months, once the centre of China now a riotous bedlam engulfing the city in a blaze of anti-foreign and especially anti-German sentiment. All is not lost yet however, the new government in Beijing has quietly offered a rapprochement of sorts should we accept a significant loss in influence. In return for our continued economic and military aide in opposition to Japan alongside a significant reduction in German held debts the new regime in Beijing promises to uphold private economic investments as well as guaranteeing the rights of Germany in Qingdao and Weihaiwei.\n\nNegotiations between these suddenly fiercely independent Assemblymen and our own officials lasted well into the night as neither side could scarcely afford to leave without a firm answer. In the end the men from Beijing were able to convince most of the German delegates to accept a compromise on the matter of the massive debt racked up by the Qing Empire this last decade, ensuring an open default of the Beijing treasury was no longer on the table. Finally of course, the High Commissioner in Singapore is required to sign off."
 qiefocus.32.a: "We salvaged our position, The Japanese won't seize China from us."
 qiefocus.32.b: "They want an equal treaty? Not a chance."

 qiefocus.33.t: "Results of the Tianjin Conference"
 qiefocus.33.d: "Events in Beijing happened quickly these last few months, once the centre of China now a riotous bedlam engulfing the city in a blaze of anti-foreign and especially anti-German sentiment. Not every tie was cut however, several leaders of our emergency government quietly offered a rapprochement of sorts to the German Empire if only they accepted a significant loss in influence. In return for their continued economic and military aide in opposition to Japan alongside a significant reduction in German held debts we obliged to uphold private economic investments as well as guaranteeing the rights of Germany in Qingdao and Weihaiwei.\n\nNegotiations between our fiercely independent Assemblymen and their bewildered officials lasted well into the night as neither side could scarcely afford to leave without a firm answer. In the end our emissaries were able to convince most of the German delegates to accept a compromise on the matter of the massive debt racked up by the Qing Empire this last decade, ensuring an open default of the Beijing treasury was no longer on the table. Finally of course, our terms were accepted."
 qiefocus.33.a: "We were able to create a strong foundation for future trust with the Kaiserreich."

 qiefocus.34.d.republic: "As our settlement with Germany continues, certain elites and business figures from both sides of the negotiating table are expressing interest in rekindling economic ties between the Chinese Republic and the Reich, this time on equal footing. They argue on the basis of our already existing familiarity, and a common financial-military rival in Tokyo making cooperation a must. Despite this, we must still manoeuvre with caution when making deals with the Reich, so as to not be seen as their stooges again and taking only what we absolutely need instead of outright re-embracing our erstwhile masters. Right now, there are two offers coming from the German side, one for the return of Luftstreitkräfte advisors to continue their work with the Imperial Air Force, or a lucrative contract with Siemens to manufacture machinery and other electrical equipment in cooperation with our Imperial Production Bureaus, which we're sorely in need of at the moment."
 qiefocus.34.d.manchu: "As our settlement with Germany continues, certain elites and business figures from both sides of the negotiating table are expressing interest in rekindling economic ties between the Middle Kingdom and the Reich, this time on more equal footing. They argue on the basis of our already existing familiarity, and a common financial-military rival in Tokyo making cooperation a necessity. While this could be considered later down the line, the current political climate is too fragile for German businesses to re-establish their position in China, as we risk alienating intellectual circles, as well as an emerging class of petty capitalists and entrepreneurs. In view of our political conditions, and the potential of furthering industrial growth at home, we must hold off from German economic deals, at least until it is within our interests to do so again."
 qiefocus.34.a: "Sign the contracts with Siemens."
 qiefocus.34.b: "Control of the skies guarantees victory."
 qiefocus.34.c: "At least the economic situation is improving for our subjects."

 qiefocus.35.t: "A Favoured Partner in the East"
 qiefocus.35.d: "After years of being under the yoke of oppressive debt the regime has finally stabilised our economic situation. Now that our international creditors have begun to look about the regime in Beijing with a friendlier demeanour, new opportunities abound for us. German businesses with the express approval of Berlin have approached us with further economic offers to try and make a fortune on the ground level of a newly burgeoning and empowered Chinese economy. The new China being built can look forward to many more economic ties with the rest of the world, forevermore on equal footing."
 qiefocus.35.a: "German advances in Aeronautics will give us the edge on the battlefield."

Many of our generals fear our forces are unready for such a large conflict, and our Japanese backers have not yet signed off on such a quick attack. We can either override these generals at the cost of some political power, or wait the three months they say they need to prepare their troops, and inform Yan we will assist then.\n\nOf course, we could also refuse to get involved at all."
 qiefor.19.d_postcoup: "While reports are unclear of how exactly this occurred, it appears that Yan Xishan, governor of Shanxi and our former ally, was somehow involved in a coup attempt against the Zhili. We don't know the exact details, but the coup appears to have failed and now Zhili forces are mustering to attack Shanxi. While we want to defend our former ally, our forces have been caught off-guard. We can intervene immediately, though overruling our top generals will cost significant political power. Or, however, we can wait a few months to prepare our forces adequately, and hope that Governor Yan can hold on for that long.\n\nOf course, we could also refuse to get involved at all."

While there is no doubt we can defeat these rats on our own, we have also reached out to [FNG.GetLeader], our former ally during the last Zhifeng war, where we fought on his side against the Zhili traitors. Hopefully he can come to our aid!"

 qiefor.211.t: "Fengtian Refuses Our Call for Aid"
 qiefor.211.d: "In an act of utter cowardice, Zhang Zuolin has chosen to refuse our call for aid, and now cowers beyond the Great Wall."
 qiefor.211.a: "Then we are on our own."

 qiefor.2111.t: "Fengtian Begins to Mobilise"
 qiefor.2111.d: "Our agents in Shenyang have reported growing signs that Fengtian is mobilising, and preparing to march its armies south against our defences at Shanhaiguan. Fortunately, our attack on Shanxi seems to have caught Zhang Zuolin by surprise, and it could take several months for his forces to move decisively."
 qiefor.2111.a: "At least we know he's coming."

 qiefor.23.t: "Qi Refuses Our Request!"
 qiefor.23.d: "Governor Qi has refused our request, claiming matters 'internal security' took precedent. While this is unfortunate, our contacts within the Peking-Kommission told us they would begin to put pressure on Qi and 'encourage' him to intervene."

 #Shanxi Event Chain
 qiefor.24.t: "Rich Vein Discovered!"
 qiefor.24.d: "Following our recent focus on mining in the Shanxi region we have uncovered vast deposits of mineral wealth. Having seized this disputed area from Governor Yan during the last Zhifeng war, managing it has brought us considerable profit. Our engineers have just discovered a new vein full of coal and iron ore. The only problem, however, is that it extends underground into the remaining territory occupied by [SHX.GetName]. While we could mine this, [SHX.GetAdjective] engineers will no doubt notice the incursion.\n\nEver since the League Collapse, Shanxi has undergone a tremendous economic overhaul which has been largely hostile to outside investment thus far. This includes our own official government of the nation, which they have pointedly treated as an external entity. Although we have made some headway in earning influence within the province, our military occupation of Eastern Shanxi has always been a sore spot in our relationship with them. He has been known to play [FNG.GetLeader] against us, attempting to act as a counterbalancing to both sides in northern China's power games.\n\nStill, we are the legitimate government of the nation, and we ought to use China's resources as we see fit. Especially when it comes to strategic resources integral to defending our nation. It would save us a lot of red tape to simply press the issue, though some worry the escalation in tensions might be far more than its worth."
 qiefor.24.a: "Dig deeply and greedily!"
 qiefor.24.b: "Surely we can come to an arrangement."

 qiefor.24001.t: "The [QIE.GetName] Propose a Joint-Mining Project"
 qiefor.24001.d: "In their quest towards national self sufficiency in terms of strategic natural resources, the government of the [QIE.GetName] has uncovered vast deposits of mineral wealth, a vein of which has extended into deep into our own territories. They have proposed a cooperation between their engineers and mining interests, possibly backed by foreign investments, to help with extraction of coal and iron ore in Shanxi province. We would of course receive what they see as a \"fair share\" and the net profits are expected to be considerable for both sides.\n\nWe are reminded however that the military of [QIE.GetName] continues to occupy our rightful territory in eastern Shanxi despite having remained loyal to them for nearly a decade. They have either refused to pay or have paid a pittance for their usage of the wealth in that region, money that ought to be in the provincial treasury. On principle, some have argued, we should reject agreement with Beijing until the occupation ends."
 qiefor.24001.a: "We accept this proposition."
 qiefor.24001.b: "We can handle mining ourselves."

 qiefor.24002.t: "Rich Vein Discovered!"
 qiefor.24002.d: "Following our recent focus on mining in the Shanxi region we have uncovered vast deposits of mineral wealth. This has coincided positively with the recent turn Shanxi has taken, liberalising some commerce and reducing the financial isolation Shanxi has undergone since its bitter defeat in the Fourth Zhili-Fengtian war. Their ambitious economic overhaul, known as the \"Ten Year Plan\", has not gone unnoticed, though the extent to which it is being genuinely used to foster local prosperity versus serving as a mechanism for challenging our rule is unknown for now.\n\nWhat has been discovered, however, is a very valuable and rich vein of ore extending deep into Shanxi territory. Their outward facing economic policy leaves open the possibility that they may be open to engaging in a mutually beneficial mineral extraction project, greatly expanding the amount of coal and iron produced for the security of the whole Chinese nation. It would also expand our influence, but all of this is contingent on the acceptance of the fickle [SHX.GetLeader]."
 qiefor.24002.a: "Surely we can come to an arrangement."
 qiefor.24002.b: "We should leave things be."

 qiefor.25.t: "[QIE.GetAdjectiveCap] Miners Approach Territory!"
 qiefor.25.d: "Grave news has arrived from our disputed border with the [QIE.GetName]. Our engineers have discovered [QIE.GetAdjective] tunnels extending into our territory, with streams of foreign miners and machines intruding into our rightful domain. They are protected by troops from the central army, a grave insult that ever reminds us of the land stolen from us after the disastrous Fourth Zhili-Fengtian War. Now, not only are they collecting unjustly the royalties from the occupied lands in eastern Shanxi, they are also working to take what deposits we own in the western mountains for their own nefarious ends.\n\nThis grave insult and arrogance on the part of the [QIE.GetAdjective] will never end unless we stand up for ourselves, though doing so in face of a much stronger force is always risky. Still, if we say nothing, who knows what will the next escalation be? The ace card in our hand might be to invoke the threat other interested powers in the region..."
 qiefor.25.a: "Lodge a formal complaint."
 qiefor.25.b: "We bide our time, for now."

 qiefor.26.t: "[SHX.GetNameDefCap] Protests Our Mining Operations!"
 qiefor.26.intro: "[SHX.GetLeader] has lodged a formal protest with the Bureau of Mines, claiming that our miners have violated his provincial boundaries. His message brings up a litany of complaints, mostly grievances from our dealings related to Eastern Shanxi from the last few years. To back up his words, he has ordered his provincial army to amass along the border to carry out military exercises. This has sharply escalated tensions, and word has spread that he will soon be ejecting our miners by force."
 qiefor.26.d.fengtian: "$qiefor.26.intro$\n\nNormally, we would simply dismiss this as posturing or [SHX.GetLeader] implying trying to secure another payout, but he has also noted that should Beijing fail to act accordingly, he will seek out \"responsible government to address the problem\". This is almost definitely a pointed threat to ally with [FNG.GetLeader] in Fengtian, a challenge to our rule in the northern part of the nation and risking the reigniting of conflict. Sandwiched between both factions, while we are still favoured to defeat both in a conflict like we did in the 1920s, it would likely leave our southern flank exposed to developments in the south."
 qiefor.26.d.nofengtian: "$qiefor.26.intro$\n\nThe demise of Zhang Zuolin has lessened this threat considerably, however we ought to be at least somewhat cautious nonetheless. Shanxi has many mountains and few easily navigable passages. Not to mention multiple rivers bisecting the area. An invasion of the province should things escalate further will likely eventually end in our victory, but not without significant opportunity cost."
 qiefor.26.a: "Who cares? Keep mining!"
 qiefor.26.b: "Back down, this is getting risky."

 qiefor.27.t: "[QIE.GetNameDefCap] Ignored Us!"
 qiefor.27.d.nofengtian: "Unsurprisingly, the [QIE.GetName] ignored our request. Their perfidious miners continue to extend their grasp into our vast mineral wealth, ignoring our complaints and violating various decrees issued by our Governor. With our intentions clearly stated and since ignored, it is up to us now to decide whether or not it is worth enforcing. Sending troops into the disputed border areas eject those operating without a permit issued from Taiyuan is a risky option, but to fail to do so would make us appear weak."
 qiefor.27.d.fengtian: "$qiefor.27.d.nofengtian$\n\nAnother option available to us would be to enlist the support of the [FNG.GetName]. Ruled by the ambitious warlord [FNG.GetLeader], the Yan clique has previously worked with them to disastrous results in 1928 hoping to topple the Zhili clique in their moment of weakness. This is how we lost control of Eastern Shanxi in the first place, and many are not eager to cast their lots with them again. However, alone we are unlikely to be much of a match for the central army. Still, siding with them will mean depending on them for a successful outcome, and should they not come through we will be forced to back down."
 qiefor.27.a: "We place our full faith in [FNG.GetLeader]."
 qiefor.27.b: "Escalate and block further mining operations!"
 qiefor.27.c: "Back down, this has gone too far.."

 qiefor.27001.t: "Shanxi Blocks Our Engineers!"
 qiefor.27001.d: "In a brazen move of defiance against our authority, [SHX.GetLeader] has deployed troops in an armed attempt to prevent further mining operations along the disputed Eastern Shanxi area. They have confiscated many valuable machines after refusing to acknowledge the permits we have issued, arresting many of our miners and forced others to flee to the safety of our own lines. As our own garrisons in the area scramble to meet the challenge, Shanxi is looking increasingly like a warzone.\n\nWith tensions skyrocketing, many investors have already been spooked and withdrawn their funding for further projects. The roads and rails are filled with those fleeing the border area, and many of our own mining staff are no longer willing to work in what appears to be a dangerous environment. It seems that our economic investment in the area has already been spoiled, but that does not mean this has to be for nothing.\n\nGiven the circumstances, we can clearly charge [SHX.GetLeader] and his cronies for sedition, rebellion and a host of other crimes against our state. An arrest warrant can be quickly assembled, even if it would mean losing out on most of our remaining investments. If he would like to enforce his \"decrees\", then we can surely enforce ours."
 qiefor.27001.a: "They will pay for their insolence."
 qiefor.27001.b: "They have made their point, we will retreat."

 qiefor.28.t: "[QIE.GetNonIdeologyNameDefCap] Backs Down!"
 qiefor.28.d: "In face of our assertive stance and fearing the possibility of escalation, [QIE.GetNameDef] have quietly backed down. Their miners and engineers have left our territory, leaving us victorious in this dispute. Sympathetic voices in Taiyuan have fallen silent as those hoping to profit off [QIE.GetAdjective] encroachment now dread our retaliation as we move to assert our authority over the entire province. This is a double edged sword of course, as investments by those loyal to Beijing as well as international conglomerates have grown more hesitant to invest in what they see as an upstart province.\n\nThis should not detract from our celebration of what happened here however. We have scored a major victory against an overzealous central government, without firing a shot and avoiding any violent conflict. Moreover, thanks to the existing work those miners have done, we can now reap the benefits of Shanxi's richness for ourselves, the rightful owners."
 qiefor.28.a: "Great!"

 qiefor.29.t: "Shanxi Back Down!"
 qiefor.29.d: "In wake of our show of strength, [SHX.GetLeader] has ordered his men to stand down and the entire [SHX.GetName] to back away from the simmering dispute over mineral rights in Eastern Shanxi. This has allowed our miners access the valuable mineral veins in the area undisturbed, with nearly completely unfettered access to not only Eastern Shanxi but indeed almost all of the province. This is a great victory, allowing us to supply critical strategic resources for our war machine as we work towards national unification. [SHX.GetLeader]'s own status as a national figure has been cut down to size, humiliated over this outcome and forced to acknowledge our superiority, at least for the time being. He will have to be brought to heel eventually, but our victory today will probably be the first step in bringing Shanxi back into the fold."
 qiefor.29.a: "Great!"

 qiefor.30.t: "Mining Crisis in Shanxi!"
 qiefor.30.d: "What began as a minor spat over resource rights in Shanxi province has rapidly escalated over the last few months along the Shanxi-[QIE.GetName] border, presenting both risk and opportunity as we are potentially drawn into a simmering conflict in northern China. At the end of the failed Northern Expedition, Zhang Zuolin successfully brokered a secret pact between the Fengtian clique and a coalition of allies including Yan Xishan of Shanxi, Zhang Zongchang of Shandong, and Tang Jiyao of Yunnan.\n\nAn attempt to quickly defeat the Zhili clique failed with Shandong's defection and allied failure to make much progress, with Shanxi suffering the worst of the consequences. The eastern half of their province was occupied by [QIE.GetAdjective] forces since 1928, including their precious coal and iron reserves. The [QIE.GetAdjective] leadership apparently grew too greedy as of late, resulting in forces being amassed once more and threatening the balance of power in north China.\n\n[SHX.GetLeader] is asking us to step in and guarantee his provincial borders. Although on the best of terms, the presence of his armies to the west threatens Zhili hold over crucial cities such as Baoding, Luoyang and Xi'an. His province's geography is quite favourable to defence, but he lacks the industrial base to hold out forever. If we let him become trampled under foot, defeating the [QIE.GetName] becomes considerably harder. On the other hand, getting involved puts our reputation on the line, and perhaps is not the best course of action."
 qiefor.30.a: "Time to step in!"
 qiefor.30.b: "We are not ready."

 qiefor.31.t: "[FNG.GetNonIdeologyNameDefCap] Steps In"
 qiefor.31.d: "In our team of desperate need, [FNG.GetLeader] has come to our rescue. In a pointed message to [QIE.Capital.GetName], he has promised to guarantee our provincial borders against encroachment by [QIE.GetAdjective] agents, asserting that any legitimate government in China ought to respect provincial boundaries in authority. Zhang Zuolin's actual commitment to such federalist rhetoric is highly transient, but his military strength is not. Should the [QIE.GetName] continue to 'violate the boundaries of our province', he claims he will come to our aid, threatening a war on two fronts for the already overstretched [QIE.GetAdjective] army."
 qiefor.31.a: "Great!"

 qiefor.32.t: "[FNG.GetNonIdeologyNameDefCap] Protect Shanxi!"
 qiefor.32.d: "It appears that [SHX.GetLeader] was serious in his threat to reach out to the Fengtian - [FNG.GetLeader] has just announced he will protect the 'provincial integrity' of Shanxi against any 'rebel incursions'. This is a betrayal of the highest order and another sign that our national order has crumbled.\n\nHis actual ability to follow up with his threat however, remains in question. The Fengtian clique has numerous pressing issues, and is not necessarily eager for an actual large-scale war. The degree to which Japanese aid has improved his situation compared to our own military development over the last decade or so is questionable, and indeed we have defeated the combined might of both Fengtian and Shanxi in the past.\n\nHowever, we would be wise as to not underestimate the challenges of fighting a two fronted war, especially as we monitor the southern situation. Calling Fengtian's bluff is a risky play, no matter the scenario. But backing down now would make us look weak and embolden further action. The nation awaits us to make a final decision."
 qiefor.32.a: "Call their bluff - move troops into the area!"
 qiefor.32.b: "This is too risky. Stand down."

 qiefor.33.t: "Skirmishes on the Border!"
 qiefor.33.d: "It appears the fools in Beijing did not listen to reason! They have begun to move troops of their into the disputed mining areas, firing at the provincial units we have stationed there. Already we are hearing reports of isolated skirmishes between border guards and [QIE.GetAdjective] troops as war looms. As our men quickly rush into position across the front line, we must reach out to [FNG.GetLeader] for help at once! Combined, we will have the strength not only to hold off the advances of the so-called central army, but with any luck end the [QIE.GetName] once and for all!"
 qiefor.33.a: "Call [FNG.GetLeader] for aid!"

 qiefor.34.t: "Skirmishes on Shanxi-[QIE.GetNonIdeologyName] Border!"
 qiefor.34.d: "It appears that the [QIE.GetAdjective] have ignored our threats! Reports from [SHX.Capital.GetName] indicate that [QIE.GetAdjective] advance forces moved into the disputed territories over the last week, and have begun to attack border garrisons. Contrary to some expectations, it seems like the [SHX.GetAdjective] army has stood their ground - at least for now. Supplied with quality rifles and artillery from Taiyuan and relying on their knowledge of local terrain, the fact that they did not crumple immediately into a rout gives hope that they may prevail.\n\nThis could be the opportunity we have waited for - a chance to reverse the humiliation of 1928! With many [QIE.GetAdjective] divisions distracted attempting to quickly seize Taiyuan, we may finally be afforded the chance to storm Beijing and hopefully link up with [SHX.GetAdjective] forces. With the eyes of the nation fixed upon us, we must decide on our next move."
 qiefor.34.a: "Honour our commitment. To war!"
 qiefor.34.b: "Back down. We can't beat them yet..."

 qiefor.35.t: "[FNG.GetNonIdeologyNameDefCap] Attacks!"
 qiefor.35.d: "Our attempts to call Zhang Zuolin's bluff failed - he has begun mobilise his troops and formally declared war on us! Surrounded on two sides, we must rely on our defences along the Dai River, superior training and better resources to grind down the [FNG.GetAdjective] offensive. In the meantime, the [SHX.GetAdjective] army is unlikely to pose a considerable threat, though the long front line we share with them will unfortunately tie up many divisions. If we are to recreate our victory in 1928, we will have to work intelligently and bravely - the superior discipline of our army will carry the day. At this point, we are fighting for far more than just a few extra mines or taxation rights, we are now locked into a battle for the fate of the nation."
 qiefor.35.a: "Ready the troops!"

 qiefor.36.t: "[FNG.GetNonIdeologyNameDefCap] Back Down!"
 qiefor.36.d: "Our plan to call [FNG.GetLeader]'s bluff has succeeded! We have heard nothing from his government after we sent our troops into the disputed areas and we can now safely assume that we have free rein to do whatever we want with the Shanxi province! Already [SHX.GetName]'s armies have been thrown into disarray as they are forced to fend for themselves. Still, with the mountains and rivers behind them, they are expected to put up a considerable fight.\n\nWe have undoubtedly won the battle for eastern Shanxi, but whether or not to pursue the routing [SHX.GetAdjective] army west is another question. [SHX.GetLeader] has offered an array of primarily economic but some political concessions in hopes of staving off invasion. The more hawkish elements of our government have proposed that we destroy the traitorous [SHX.GetLeader], eliminating the threat permanently. The more cautions ministers however, warn that getting bogged down fighting in Shanxi may leave us vulnerable in the future."
 qiefor.36.a: "Easy pickings!"
 qiefor.36.b: "We have taught [SHX.GetNameDef] a less they won't forget."

 qiefor.37.t: "The [FNG.GetName] Back Down!"
 qiefor.37.d: "The traitorous [FNG.GetLeader] has let us down! Despite our request for assistance he has ignored us in the face of [QIE.GetAdjective] aggression, leaving us to manage our own fate. Seeing little choice and running short on options, [SHX.GetLeader] has quickly assembled a series of frantic proposals that will trade some of autonomy in the form of concessions in exchange for peace along the central plains. With few other options after our recent treachery in aligning with Fengtian, we have little choice but to hope they accept."
 qiefor.37.a: "Damnation!"

However, they have now requested that in order to make a statement and show the glory of the Emperor to the public in Nanjing, we should fund the construction of very large offices for them."
 qiefor.58.a: "No, it's not worth it"
 qiefor.58.b: "Fund construction"

 qiefor.59.t: "Resource Development with Anqing"
 qiefor.59.d: "We have recently struck a deal with Anqing to stimulate Qing enterprises to aid in the prospecting and development of resources in their territory. We of course indirectly benefit from these resources as we can trade with Anqing, but shouldn't we get some direct benefits as well? We could ask for control over one of their iron mines in Wuhu. Maybe they will be willing to accommodate us."
 qiefor.59.a: "No, this doesn't cost us anything"
 qiefor.59.b: "Yes, ask them for steel from Wuhu"

 qiefor.60.t: "Anqing Refuses Special Treatment"
 qiefor.60.d: "The Beijing Liaison Council has been hard at work to improve the ability of Qing enterprises to do business in the Anqing Clique. Due to the backwards nature and governance of the Anqing Clique, this is sometimes quite difficult. However, when the Liaison Council recently requested the Anqing Clique to do something about this, they outright refused! This is unacceptable. We should send them another offer. One they can't refuse."
 qiefor.60.a: "Send the offer"

 qiefor.61.t: "Anqing Still Refuses"
 qiefor.61.d: "Somehow, they refused an offer they weren't supposed to refuse. As a result, through coordination with the Beijing Liaison Council, we have temporarily implemented extremely far-reaching restrictions for Anqing companies operating within our borders. While we will make sure our own economy is not hit, we will prevent any kind of profit flowing to Anqing for at least the next few months. This will surely make them unhappy, but it should teach them for next time."
 qiefor.61.a: "Do it"

 qiefor.62.t: "Puyi Receives Warm Welcome in Nanjing"
 qiefor.62.d: "Emperor Puyi recently visited the Southern Capital, Nanjing, together with Wu Peifu. There they met with Chen Tiaoyuan, who made sure that he received an incredibly warm welcome. In fact, Puyi has been so delighted that he has asked Chen Tiaoyuan if an extensive renovation and rebuilding project for the city's ruined Ming Palace would be possible."
 qiefor.62.a: "Excellent"

 qiefor.63.t: "Puyi Shocked by Protests in Nanjing"
 qiefor.63.d: "Emperor Puyi recently visited the Southern Capital, Nanjing, together with Wu Peifu. There they met with Chen Tiaoyuan, leader of the Anqing Clique. However, to both the Emperor's and Wu's dismay, the streets were crowded with protestors. It was obvious that either Chen did not have things under control or he simply didn't care to provide a proper welcome for Puyi. Both scenarios are scandalous and require correction. The Beijing Liaison Council has received orders to make sure that Chen pays for this."
 qiefor.63.a: "Bad manners"

 qiefor.64.t: "Chen Agrees with Intellectuals"
 qiefor.64.d: "The intellectual gathering organised by the Beijing Liaison Council in Nanjing was a great success. Such a success even, that Chen Tiaoyuan himself announced that he agrees with their sentiment and will do all he can to accelerate their timeline. Hopefully he isn't lying."
 qiefor.64.a: "Good news"

 qiefor.65.t: "Chen Stresses His Autonomy"
 qiefor.65.d: "Recently, the Beijing Liaison Council in Nanjing organised a meeting of various famous Chinese intellectuals. They all came to the same conclusion: China must unite immediately. However, Chen Tiaoyuan, leader of Anqing, has spoken out against the urgency of their call. Instead, he says that local autonomy is more important than unification. What he says is practically a renunciation of his recognition of the Qing as sole national government! We cannot let him get away with such words and must speak against it immediately."
 qiefor.65.a: "Prepare a counter-message"

 qiefor.66.t: "The Qing Reach Out"
 qiefor.66.d: "Tensions are mounting in the north, with Qing afraid that it might be attacked by Fengtian, or even Japan. They are looking for allies and as we have not forgotten their help in the League war, have now come to us. Will we accept their request and enter into an alliance with them?"
 qiefor.66.a: "Of course"
 qiefor.66.b: "No!"

 qiefor.67.t: "The Qing Reach Out"
 qiefor.67.d: "Now that Qing is under attack from the outside, they have requested us to enter into an alliance with them and participate in the defence of China. If we don't help, China might be overrun. We really have no choice."
 qiefor.67.a: "Of course"
 qiefor.67.b: "No!"

 qiefor.68.t: "The Qing Reach Out"
 qiefor.68.d: "So far, we have evaded being integrated by Qing. However, now they have emerged victorious in their other major conflict, meaning that we are most likely next."
 qiefor.68.a: "Of course"
 qiefor.68.b: "No!"

 qiefor.69.t: "Chen Refuses Alliance"
 qiefor.69.d1: "Chen Tiaoyuan, leader of the Anqing Clique, has refused our request for an alliance. This is hard to believe, but true. There is little we can do now, as we do not wish to blow up our relationship, but we will make sure he accepts next time."
 qiefor.69.d2: "Chen Tiaoyuan, leader of the Anqing Clique, has refused our request for an alliance. This is hard to believe, but true. There is little we can do now, as we are at war, but we will make sure he bends the knee after we have emerged victorious."
 qiefor.69.d3: "Chen Tiaoyuan, leader of the Anqing Clique, has refused our request for an alliance. This even after we have defeated China's greatest enemy and shown that we are the rightful government! We cannot show weakness."
 qiefor.69.a: "He will pay for this"

 qiefor.70.t: "Anqing Canal Cooperation"
 qiefor.70.d: "The Beijing Liaison Council has again been successful. It noticed that Anqing had recently completed significant dyke and canal work, including the completion of the massive Subei Canal. It has now secured Anqing cooperation in dyke works in Hebei and Kaifeng. Work can begin as soon as we want."
 qiefor.70.a: "Excellent"

 qiefor.71.t: "Army Cooperation with Anqing"
 qiefor.71.d: "Anqing are now part of our alliance, and the next move must be closer army cooperation. We have already taken the first step, as the Beijing Liaison Council has set up an Army Cooperation Commission. Now we must decide if we want to expend resources to improve the Anqing armies, as they are quite outdated and based around age-old warlord tactics. The benefits are clear, as not only would it improve their fighting capabilities in war, it would also afford us valuable influence over them."
 qiefor.71.a: "We'll help them"
 qiefor.71.b: "They'll have to manage on their own"

 qiefor.72.t: "Anqing Refuses Further Army Cooperation"
 qiefor.72.d: "Unfortunately, Anqing has refused further army cooperation for now. However, they must eventually realise that this cooperation is critical if a strong defence is to be mounted against our common enemies. We can try again in the future."
 qiefor.72.a: "Alright"

 qiefor.73.t: "Army Cooperation Concluded"
 qiefor.73.d: "The projects of the Army Cooperation Commission that sought to intensify coordination and communication between the Qing and Anqing forces have now concluded. While more would always be preferable, we can be satisfied with the results and the improvements to the Anqing armies."
 qiefor.73.a: "That's good"

 qiefor.74.t: "Anqing Refuses Conference"
 qiefor.74.d: "Strangely, Chen Tiaoyuan has outright refused to hold a conference to discuss our country's future. This is quite outrageous and not something we expected from a man like Chen. We have to make sure he stays in our orbit. We won't forget he did this."
 qiefor.74.a: "Damn him!"

 qiefor.75.t: "End of the Conference"
 qiefor.75.d1: "The conference was a complete success! Chen was very willing on multiple fronts and the progress made has been tremendous. This event will most definitely be remembered as critical in China's history, as it marked the beginning of accelerated integration between the Northern and Southern Zhili."
 qiefor.75.d2: "The conference was a success, although maybe not as much as we had hoped for. Chen Tiaoyuan and other delegation members were willing to accept some of our proposals, but refused even more. This is unfortunate, but we still made some significant progress."
 qiefor.75.d3: "Unfortunately, despite our best efforts, most of our actual proposals have been refused by the Anqing delegation. This entire conference is a complete political failure. This is frustrating, as it seemed that Chen was willing to continue integration talks!"
 qiefor.75.a: "Good news"
 qiefor.75.b: "Damn!"

 qiefor.76.t: "Dalu Yinhang and Anqing"
 qiefor.76.d: "Dalu Yinhang, the Continental Bank, is one of our major commercial banks. Recently, through an initiative coordinated by the Beijing Liaison Council, they have made significant investments into the Anqing Clique to aid them with expanding their industry. We could potentially leverage this to increase our influence with Anqing. First of all, we could offer additional loans through other banks. This might strain our own resources, however. We could also decide to let them repay the loan on more favourable terms. Dalu Yinhang should be able to manage this, but they might not be happy. What will we do?"
 qiefor.76.a: "Offer more loans"
 qiefor.76.b: "Improve the terms"
 qiefor.76.c: "Nothing"

 qiefor.77.t: "Anqing Responds to Our Offer"
 qiefor.77.d1: "The offer concerning the Dalu Yinhang loans we made Anqing must have been very sweet indeed. They have accepted and also committed themselves to taking additional steps concerning further integration. That should definitely help make a united China a reality."
 qiefor.77.d2: "Unfortunately, what we offered was not enough for Anqing, and they have utterly rejected it. Again Chen Tiaoyuan has decided to frustrate our efforts, even when it is obvious that it is to the benefit of all of China!"
 qiefor.77.a: "Good news!"
 qiefor.77.b: "Unfortunate"

 qiefor.78.t: "Wu Meets Anqing Anti-Concessionists"
 qiefor.78.d: "In order to increase support in Anqing for unification with the Qing without having to go through Chen Tiaoyuan, Wu has decided to meet up with a number of leaders of the Anti-Concessions League, the largest organisation representing the usually disorganised Anti-Concessionist Movement. The League itself is split up into two factions, one of which is pro-republican and in bed with the Vermillion Society. The other is more to Wu's taste as it supports the Qing monarchy and believes that unification is necessary as soon as possible. The pro-Vermillion group has been somewhat an obstacle to unification, and so Wu has insisted they also be part of the meeting.\n\nThe leaders were impressed by the Marshal's words and his recent actions and policies within the Qing government. He also secretly confided in them that he also preferred a China without an Emperor, but a constitutional monarchy meant that both camps could have what they want. He swore to them that he would never allow Puyi to harm China. Wu's words reassured many and even convinced some who had previously been passively pro-republican to support immediate unification."
 qiefor.78.a: "Excellent"

 qiefor.79.t: "Anqing Reconstruction Aid"
 qiefor.79.d: "The Anqing Clique has decided to take a cooperative approach to tackling the great reconstruction required to get their country back on its feet. Through smaller initiatives, Qing is already helping and providing significant aid. We could escalate this to the national level and provide more aid there. However, this would constrain us for at least a short while."
 qiefor.79.a: "Help them more"
 qiefor.79.b: "Enough is being done"

 qiefor.80.t: "Qing Requests Integration!"
 qiefor.80.d: "Now that we are in their alliance and have become very close to their government, the Qing government has decided it is time to complete unification. While a united China is nice, it would mean an almost certain end to our prized autonomy. Will we agree, for the sake of China?"
 qiefor.80.a: "Yes, unification is urgent"
 qiefor.80.b: "No, autonomy matters more now"

 qiefor.81.t: "Eastern China United!"
 qiefor.81.d: "Anqing has agreed, meaning that Eastern China is finally united!"
 qiefor.81.a: "United we are strong"

 qiefor.82.t: "Anqing Refuses!"
 qiefor.82.d: "Anqing has refused integration! They dare stand against unification, even when it is so necessary in our coming battles. Unfortunately, there is little we can do right now."
 qiefor.82.a: "They'll come around"

 qiefor.83.t: "Qing Requests Integration!"
 qiefor.83.d: "Now that we are in their alliance and have become very close to their government, the Qing government has decided it is time to complete unification. Fengtian lies defeated and China has shown it can even keep out Japan. It is most likely time that we now unite."
 qiefor.83.a: "Yes, the time has come"
 qiefor.83.b: "No, it will never be time"

 qiefor.84.t: "Anqing Refuses!"
 qiefor.84.d: "Anqing has denied our proposal for unification. This even when we defeated Fengtian and kept out Japan. We can wait and ask again, but they won't come off so easy next time."
 qiefor.84.a: "We'll have to try again"

 qiefor.85.t: "Anqing Refuses Again!"
 qiefor.85.d: "Anqing has denied our proposal for unification for the second time. It is clear now that they are traitors to the cause."
 qiefor.85.a: "War is our only option"

 qiefor.86.t: "Wu Peifu Turns on Us!"
 qiefor.86.d: "Following the death of League Marshal Sun Chuanfang, we had hoped that our 'ally' in Beijing, Wu Peifu, would remain loyal to our interests. However it seems that he has decided to turn on us and take an publicly anti-concession stance. While this has bolstered support for his unpopular regime, it means that he has demanded that the Peking-Kommission, our lobbying arm in Beijing, leave the city. Facing massive riots outside the gates of their offices, most members have fled to Tianjin! Our ambassador has sent all non-essential staff to Tianjin as well, leaving a skeleton group of consular officials closely watched by Wu's forces."
 qiefor.86.a: "Damn him!"

 qiefor.87.t: "Riots in Beijing!"
 qiefor.87.d: "Ever since Marshal Wu Peifu refused to intervene in the collapse of the League of Eight Provinces, our agents in Beijing have reported an aura of tension and unease, with Wu's inaction offending every single major power bloc in his own government. These tensions exploded into open strife when a group of dissatisfied Zhili generals, allied with a clique of young radical officers and the Manchu nobility, attempted to murder Wu and President Cao Kun and 'restore' the Emperor Puyi! Even worse, this coup has been used as an opportunity to attack German interests, leveraging our unpopularity within the country to bolster this new shaky new regime. Massive riots have erupted outside of our embassy and the offices of the Peking-Kommission, and our ambassador has ordered all non-essential staff to leave the city for the relative safety of Tianjin."
 qiefor.87.a: "Curses!"

 qiefor.90.t: "Beijing looks weak."
 qiefor.90.d: "As the regime in Beijing continues to focus more and more forces to their south and west they have become far too deaf to our forces poised just across the border in Manchuria. As the days have passed certain enterprising units have pushed across what was a once tightly held frontier. Finding little opposition to their advance by the disorganised and demoralised [QIE.GetAdjective] forces, having suffered recent purges thanks to political instability in the capital, the vanguard became quickly emboldened. Field officers, eager for glory and a chance to prove themselves, pressed forward without further consultations with their superiors and within days our flag waved triumphant over Shanhaiguan,a critical pass in the Great Wall.\n\nAs news spread of our advance, the [QIE.GetAdjective] retreat quickly became a rout. Trenches and defences along the previously well fortified border were abandoned without a fight and we gave chase up to the Dai River before regionalist protests erupted in Shenyang and rail strikes broke out in the recently captured Qinhuangdao. From there, our senior officers retook command, deciding to stabilise our position along a natural front rather than press the advantage in risk a turnaround."
 qiefor.90.a: "We are one step closer to Beijing!"

 qiefor.91.t: "We Flinched in Shanhaiguan"
 qiefor.91.d: "As the war to the west and south fail to materialise a victory for the new government our great rival to the north has finally made a move. Fengtian soldiers strode forward with little resistance as we were too weak to contest them, humiliating losing the Shanhai pass (Shanhaiguan) and thus the symbolically important Great Wall. The garrison manning the border, undermanned and under-motivated, evidently lost heart and routed in face of the enemy advance, yielding valuable forward defences without firing a shot.\n\nWe were very lucky that the Dai River proved too great an obstacle for the Northeast Army to continue and add to our humiliations, and our generals were successful in re-establishing order on the other side. Still, the incident has badly shaken morale and commanders there have begged for further reinforcements to prevent a repeat of the incident. They warn that the Dai River can only hold off [FNG.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]'s ambitions for so long, and whatever threat we may face in the Central Plains, it cannot compare to the danger losing Beijing poses."
 qiefor.91.a: "The irony has not been lost among the Manchu."

 qiefor.92.t: "The Bridge on the River Dai"
 qiefor.92.d: "Despite our victorious entry through the Shanhai Pass (Shanhaiguan) in the Great Wall and their utter rout to the Dai River, the [QIE.GetAdjective] high command has been slow to to acknowledge their defeat. Either because of poor communication or general incompetence or because of a stubborn desire to see the Guominjun destroyed in the Central Plains, their response has been lumbering and ineffectual - leaving major gaps across the river which had become a natural boundary of sorts.\n\nThough our own high command was satisfied with the outcome and reluctant to press forward, scouting parties probing the area were more ambitious. Soon enough, they came across multiple lightly (or in some cases unguarded even) access points and soon enough bridgeheads were made. It quickly became a mad dash by overeager officers trying to claim they were first in reaching Beijing. As men finally reached the outskirts of the city local police belatedly started firing back from fortified positions, forcing a halt. Fearing overextension orders from on high cut back any further advances. As Beijing is within eyeshot of the new Fengtian border it remains to be seen how long until the Grand Marshal orders it's capture."
 qiefor.92.a: "This defeat is the gateway to many victories."

 qiefor.93.t: "Beijing in Peril!"
 qiefor.93.d: "Despite our disastrous loss of the Shanhai Pass (Shanhaiguan) in the Great Wall and our forces' utter rout to the Dai River, it seems our high command has been slow to acknowledge their defeat. Either because of poor communication or general incompetence or because of a stubborn desire to see the Guominjun destroyed in the Central Plains, their response has been lumbering and ineffectual - leaving major gaps across the river which had become a natural boundary of sorts.\n\nEvidently unsatisfied with the natural demarcation of territory the Dai River provided, Fengtian scouting parties probed the area and came across multiple lightly guarded access points. Facing only minimum resistance, they made several bridgeheads which allowed for fighting to resume. A mad dash to Beijing ensured as once more our troops were put to flight. Thankfully outside of Beijing itself local police units were able to mount a last minute defence of the city and artillery fire from behind Fengtian lines seem to have hit their own advancing troops. This allowed our men to rally, and while we've lost much ground in this sudden offensive, the capital still holds. For now at least."
 qiefor.93.a: "If we win another such battle we will be completely lost."

 qiefor.101.t: "Yang Sen Holds On"
 qiefor.101.d: "Our ally in Sichuan, Governor Yang Sen, has emerged victorious in his province's civil war! This is great news for both Sichuan and our government, as once Yang stabilises control over the region we can have him re-join our alliance."
 qiefor.101.a: "Great!"

 qiefor.102.t: "[SZC.GetLeader] Takes Control of Sichuan!"
 qiefor.102.d: "Grave news sire! It appears [SZC.GetLeader] has defeated our ally Yang Sen in Sichuan! While this is a major loss to the Zhili Clique, the province is industrially poor and militarily overstretched. Should they join any opposing faction we will crush them!"
 qiefor.102.a: "Damn!"

 qiefor.103.t: "Uprisings in Fujian!"
 qiefor.103.d: "While most of China and the world assumed that the Kuomintang were destroyed in 1927, League Marshal Sun had been fighting a low-intensity guerrilla conflict with remnants of the KMT in the Fujian area since that time. Reports were censored from the press, and even Wu Peifu remained largely unaware of the true scope of the conflict, with Sun keeping all details tightly under wraps.\n\nWith the current chaos in the League, however, the remnants of the KMT have re-emerged and declared a new campaign of national reunification! They have denounced our rightful government as illegitimate, calling us 'little more than a German puppet, slave to the whims of Berlin'! We can only hope that the remnants of Sun's forces can put these traitors down."
 qiefor.103.a: "Despicable traitors!"

 qiefor.104.t: "Hunan Secedes from the League!"
 qiefor.104.d: "Hunan Province had fallen under the sway of Sun Chuanfang during the chaos following the 1927 Northern Expedition, with Governor Zhao Hengti re-assuming control of the province after a brief period of KMT rule. A long time ally of Wu, Zhao has been governor of the region since 1920. However, he also has ties to the Federalist 'government' in Guangdong, tacitly supporting the federal model. As of now he has taken a strictly neutral stance, torn between his personal friendship to Wu and his political loyalties to Chen Jiongming. His neutrality cannot last long, however, as already clouds are beginning to circle around his rule of the province."
 qiefor.104.a: "Hopefully Wu's old friend remains loyal..."

 qiefor.105.t: "Yiguandao Take Over Shandong!"
 qiefor.105.d: "The esoteric, millenarian sect known as the Yiguandao have reportedly taken over Shandong Province, ousting our erstwhile governor Zhang Zongchang! While initially concern ran high that this sect would create chaos in our lands, level heads prevailed, pointing out Zhang's well-documented Fengtian loyalties. The cult is isolated, and once the chaos to the south has stabilised we may able to attack them, though this could cause unrest with the sizeable number of adherents the religion has within our territory."
 qiefor.105.a: "Interesting..."

 qiefor.106.t: "Zhang Zongchang Severs Ties with Beijing!"
 qiefor.106.d: "The position of Shandong Governor Zhang Zongchang had always been tenuous at best. An erratic, violent man, Zhang previously held close ties to Zhang Zuolin of the Fengtian Government, though he had been kept loyal to Beijing through bribery and lavish commissions. It appears he has used the chaos enveloping the south to cast us aside. This morning a number of our tax-collectors were halted at the provincial border, and spies within the province report he has carried out mass purges of Qing loyalists. Even worse, they report him making contact with Zhang Zuolin and the Japanese!"
 qiefor.106.a: "Damn you, Dogmeat General!"

 qiefor.107.t: "Zhang Zongchang Arrested!"
 qiefor.107.d: "Earlier today Governor Zhang Zongchang of Shandong was arrested by magistrates reporting to Qu Yingguang, an outspoken Qing loyalist and Confucian scholar within the province. While normally the arrest of a governor would be a cause for concern, Zhang had well-documented ties to the Fengtian regime and Japan, and many in Wu's circle feared that he would use the chaos currently enveloping the south to sever ties with our government and declare his loyalty to Zhang Zuolin. These fears have been laid to rest, as newly minted Governor Qu promises that he will uphold our government in the province."
 qiefor.107.a: "Finally some good news!"

 qiefor.108.t: "Civil War in Sichuan!"
 qiefor.108.d: "Sichuan Province, long plagued by overpopulation and food shortages, has erupted into civil war! Ever since the 1927 Restoration, Yang Sen, a close personal friend and ally of Wu Peifu, has ruled the province, but in the last few years his control began to slip. Various other factions loyal to the Fengtian regime, Kuomintang remnants, and isolationists loyal only to themselves began to consolidate power, and used the collapse of the League as the perfect moment to launch attacks on Yang's now-shaky government. Yang has yet to reach out to us for direct aid, preferring to hide the scope of the unrest, but Wu expects his old friend to come knocking for help any day."
 qiefor.108.a: "Terrible news"

 qiefor.109.t: "Liangguang Breaks Free!"
 qiefor.109.d: "Liangguang, a coalition of two of the former eight provinces of the eponymous League, seceded from both that agglomeration and our regime as a whole this morning. Under the command of scholar-bureaucrat Chen Jiongming, backed up by the warlord Lu Rongting, the provinces declared our government 'wholly illegitimate' and promised a 'swift end to the autocratic and anachronistic monarchy'."
 qiefor.109.a: "Rebel scum!"

 qiefor.110.t: "Zhao Hengti Wins Hunan Elections"
 qiefor.110.d.zhili: "Wu Peifu's old friend, Zhao Hengti, has just won the recent provincial elections in Hunan. While this initially might seem good for us, Zhao's electoral victory also means that he has reaffirmed his commitment to his federal values, placing what he thinks are the best interests of the nation over his true loyalties to Wu."
 qiefor.110.d.manchu: "Governor Zhao Hengti has just won the recent provincial elections in Hunan. Decrying the 'barbarity' of the Zongshe Coup, Zhao has refused to swear loyalty to us, instead declaring his autonomy. With the governor now hostile to our regime, it seems another threat has appeared on our southern flank."
 qiefor.110.a: "Following your principles? Really!?"
 qiefor.110.b: "Damnation!"

 qiefor.111.t: "The Buddhist General Seizes Power!"
 qiefor.111.d.zhili: "Tang Shengzhi, the 'Buddhist General' of Hunan, has deposed Wu's old friend Zhao Hengti and formally claimed rulership over Hunan! Tang is a stringent republican, and while his loyalties are at the moment are unclear, he is certainly no friend of ours. This is bad news for us, as our southern flank is now held by an enemy of our regime!"
 qiefor.111.d.manchu: "Tang Shengzhi, the 'Buddhist General' of Hunan, has deposed the Zhili lapdog Zhao Hengti and formally claimed rulership over Hunan! Tang is a stringent republican, and while his loyalties are at the moment are unclear, he is certainly no friend of ours. This is bad news for us, as our southern flank is now held by an enemy of our regime!"
 qiefor.111.a: "Damn!"

 qiefor.112.t: "Kuomintang Seize Power in Hunan!"
 qiefor.112.d: "[HNN.GetLeader], a Kuomintang rebel leader in Hunan, has seized control over the province, and formally declared his allegiance to the ideals of Dr. Sun! This is a concerning development, as our southern flank now lies exposed to the foul leftists!"
 qiefor.112.a: "Damnation!"

 qiefor.113.t: "Zhao Hengti Clings On in Hunan"
 qiefor.113.d.zhili: "Zhao Hengti, the Governor of Hunan, has held onto power after an election many in the province and around China are decrying as rigged and unfair. Despite his claims of loyalty to the Federalists to the south, Wu Peifu hopes that his old friend will take this experience as an example of why democracy simply doesn't work."
 qiefor.113.d.manchu: "Zhao Hengti, the Governor of Hunan, has held onto power after an election many in the province and around China are decrying as rigged and unfair. Decrying the 'barbarity' of the Zongshe Coup, Zhao has refused to swear loyalty to us, instead declaring his autonomy. With the governor now hostile to our regime, it seems another threat has appeared on our southern flank."
 qiefor.113.a: "Hopefully Governor Zhao remembers his loyalties..."
 qiefor.113.b: "Damnation!"

 qiefor.132.d: "According to our spies in [QIE.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], [QIE.GetNameDef] is preparing their forces for an offensive against us. This fight will be one for survival."
 qiefor.132.a: "We have only a short time to prepare."

 #Japanese event:
 qiefor.133.t: "The [QIE.GetName] Prepares to Attack the [FNG.GetName]"
 qiefor.133.d: "After days of troubling reports, our spies in [QIE.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] are now certain: [QIE.GetNameDef] is preparing for war against our Manchurian allies. The extent to which we ought to support [FNG.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] has long been debated, but there can be no doubt that the fall of Manchuria could mean a grave threat to Korea. We may need to consider action soon."
 qiefor.133.a: "Is it time to consider an intervention?"

 qiefor.134.t: "The [FROM.GetName] Calls for Aid!"
 qiefor.134.d: "News has come by telephone straight from [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], our allies in [FROM.GetNameDef] are about to be attacked by [QIE.GetName]! Already their forces are mobilising, but they cannot confront this foe alone."
 qiefor.134.a: "We must prepare!"

 qiefor.135.t: "The Question of Eastern Shanxi"
 qiefor.135.d: "We have maintained several garrisons in Eastern Shanxi ever since the conclusion of the last Zhifeng War, when Yan Xishan joined Zhang Zuolin and the Fengtian Clique against our restored government. In theory our control of the area provides a significant buffer and denies Yan resources should he turn on us again, but some advisors have proposed to negotiate with him. Yan might be prevented from turning against us at all, saving us any conflict to the west, if we promise to return the rest of his province to him. So long as we only return the land following our victory over Fengtian, we would have nothing to lose.\n\nOther advisors suggest that Yan's oft-espoused 'neutrality' is nothing but a farce, as proven in the last war, and that we would only waste time in approaching him."
 qiefor.135.a: "It's worth a try."
 qiefor.135.b: "Yan cannot be trusted."

 qiefor.138.t: "Shanxi has accepted our Offer"
 qiefor.138.d: "Yan Xishan has accepted our offer, securing our western flank, although at the cost of Eastern Shanxi following our eventual victory."
 qiefor.138.a: "Now we will see if Yan is a man of his word..."

 qiefor.139.t: "Yan Xishan Proposes a Counter-Offer"
 qiefor.139.d: "Apparently unwilling to trust our word alone, Yan Xishan has accepted our offer on one condition - we must hand over Eastern Shanxi immediately. This would, of course, deprive us of a valuable region and considerable strategic depth, where Yan to turn traitor.\n\nOn the other hand, Yan may have learned his lesson from the last war, and with his province reunited he could be less inclined to join Fengtian against us."
 qiefor.139.a: "We accept, Eastern Shanxi is his."
 qiefor.139.b: "He must accept our original proposal."

 qiefor.140.t: "Beijing Accepts the Counteroffer"
 qiefor.140.d: "Wu Peifu's government in Beijing has accepted our counter-offer, and Eastern Shanxi is ours again. In the intervening years the Qing government, and the Germans in particular, have clearly done a great deal to develop the area. Now it is ours to do as we will."
 qiefor.140.a: "Excellent news!"

 qiefor.141.t: "Beijing Refuses the Counteroffer"
 qiefor.141.d: "Unfortunately Wu Peifu has rejected our counteroffer out of hand. Perhaps we over-estimated our leverage."
 qiefor.141.a: "Then we must agree to the original proposal"
 qiefor.141.b: "Call off negotiations"

 qiefor.142.t: "A Deal is Brokered between Shanxi and Beijing"
 qiefor.142.d1: "During the last days of the Fourth Zhifeng War, Qing troops occupied Eastern Shanxi, and have remained there ever since - Wu Peifu's buffer against a second 'betrayal'. Now Wu and Yan Xishan have unexpectedly signed a non-aggression pact, with the implication that Eastern Shanxi will be returned to its rightful owner some time soon. Likely anticipating an attack from the north, Wu has secured his Eastern flank— at least for now."
 qiefor.142.d2: "During the last days of the Fourth Zhifeng War, Qing troops occupied Eastern Shanxi, and have remained there ever since - Wu Peifu's buffer against a second 'betrayal'. Now Wu and Yan Xishan have unexpectedly signed a non-aggression pact, and Eastern Shanxi has been returned to its rightful owner. Likely anticipating an attack from the north, Wu has secured his Eastern flank— at least for now."
 qiefor.142.a: "Good news!"
 qiefor.142.b: "So, Yan finally shows his true colours"
 qiefor.142.c: "Interesting"

 qiefor.143.t: "[QIE.GetName] and [SHX.GetName] are Forced Apart"
 qiefor.143.d: "As our non-aggression arrangement with Shanxi was between Wu Peifu and Yan Xishan in particular, recent events have rendered it null and void. We have been informed that any forces we may have in [SHX.GetName] territory have thirty days to leave."
 qiefor.143.a: "Times change"

 qiefor.144.t: "[QIE.GetName] and [SHX.GetName] are Forced Apart"
 qiefor.144.d: "As our non-aggression arrangement with [QIE.GetName] was between Wu Peifu and Yan Xishan in particular, recent events have rendered it null and void. We have informed the [QIE.GetName] that they have thirty days to vacate our territory. We must be sure to withdraw our own forces from their territory also."
 qiefor.144.a: "Times change"

 qiefor.145.t: "[QIE.GetName]'s Wuhan Government is Finished"
 qiefor.145.d: "In the end, [QIE.GetName]'s desperate decision to relocate their capital to Wuhan made little difference, and the country looks again to Beijing as the national capital, as it has for over four centuries. However, the unification of Wuchang, Hankou, and Hanyang under one administration, however brief, cannot be so easily undone - the three cities have already been drifting together for decades, and now seem inseparable."
 qiefor.145.a: "As it should be"
 qiefor.145.b: "Separate the three cities"

 qiefor.146.t: "Time to Return to Beijing"
 qiefor.146.d: "With our victory complete, the time has come to return our capital to Beijing. However, the unification of Wuchang, Hankou, and Hanyang under one administration, however brief, cannot be so easily undone - the three cities have already been drifting together for decades, and now seem inseparable."
 qiefor.146.a: "As it should be"
 qiefor.146.b: "Separate the three cities"

 qiefor.149.t: "Time to Return Eastern Shanxi"
 qiefor.149.d: "The time has come to honour our word, and withdraw our garrisons from Eastern Shanxi."
 qiefor.149.a: "So be it."

 qiefor.150.t: "[QIE.GetName] Garrisons withdraw from Shanxi"
 qiefor.150.d: "After many years, central government garrisons have finally left Eastern Shanxi, opening the way for a return of our rule. It seems they have honoured their word."
 qiefor.150.a: "Finally"

#Flavour Events
 qieflavor.1.t: "Illegal Brothel Raided!"
 qieflavor.1.d: "A cold rain fell from the sky as Zhang Beijiao, head of the Beijing Police Department’s Vice Squad, ordered his men to take up positions around a shabby-looking building on the outskirts of the city. Soft music could be heard from within, and wisps of smoke rose from the windows.\n\n‘What do you reckon - drugs or girls?’ Zhang’s second-in-command asked. ‘Both, and I’ll buy your next lunch if I’m wrong.’ Zhang stamped out his cigarette as he whistled loudly. Half a dozen men burst open the front door and streamed into a dimly lit hall. ‘Police - don’t move!’ Zhang shouted, as men and women in various states of undress lurched into the hall, yelling and crying. The second-in-command frowned as Zhang held up a sack of opium. ‘Guess you’re buying your own lunch tomorrow.’\n\nThe policemen fanned out through the building, arresting the prostitutes and drug dealers. This was a good haul. Opium, hemp, and even cocaine, a German luxury, were found in droves. Just as Zhang was about to order his men to drag the prostitutes and their clients back to the station, one of his junior officers called out. ‘Sir! You’re going to want to see this!’ Zhang could barely believe his eyes - amongst the line-up of clients, a tall, blonde, white man stood out like a sore thumb. ‘The German Legation will hear about this!’ he said in poorly accented Chinese. ‘I have friends in high places!’\n\nArresting the man would give the central government some much-needed leverage in curbing German influence, but at the same time be politically costly for the government. On the other hand, who knows what could happen if Zhang let the man go..."
 qieflavor.1.a: "Zhang arrests him."
 qieflavor.1.b: "Zhang lets him go."

 qieflavor.2.t: "Scandal in Beijing!"
 qieflavor.2.d: "A few days ago, Hans Schröder, a promising young diplomat in the Peking-Kommission, was arrested on trumped-up charges of soliciting underage and illegal prostitutes. The Beijing Government used this as pretext to push back several German-supported reforms proposed by the Prosperity League, our lobbying group in the National Assembly. While ultimately a minor scandal this has still hit us harder than we’d like to admit."
 qieflavor.2.a: "Damn!"

 qieflavor.3.t: "Corruption in the Beijing Police?"
 qieflavor.3.d: "When Vice Captain Zhang Beijiao made the strategic decision to release Hans Schröder, the young diplomat from the German Legation in Beijing he found in an illegal brothel, we thought we’d heard the last of him. But now it appears one of the men on his team was enraged by the lapse in punishment, and reported the news to one of Beijing’s underground printing presses. Existing in a legal grey zone, these pamphleteers often publish scathing critiques of the Harmony Association’s government through thinly-veiled allegorical poems, historical analogies, and other ‘respectable’ topics to skirt by government censorship laws.\n\nThis time, however, they published a full-blown attack on the ‘corruption’ of the Beijing police department and compared the situation to the murder of Lin Weixi by British sailors in 1839, the spark that set off the First Opium War. While we’ve tried to shut down publication of this pamphlet, it has quickly spiralled out of control and has incited small protests and riots."
 qieflavor.3.a: "Damn!"

 qieflavor.4.t: "German in Peking Seduced by Oriental Beauty!"
 qieflavor.4.d: "Tabloids across the nation are abuzz with a story from Beijing. Hans Schröder, a young diplomatic attaché in the Peking consulate, was apprehended by police after they raided an illegal brothel that also traded in drugs. Furthermore, it appears that the chief of police decided to let Schröder off without as much as a warning, probably fearing political controversy. The city is currently gridlocked by anti-German riots, and many SPD members are questioning the continued value of our involvement in China.\n\nOtto Wels, senior SPD leader, delivered a scathing speech in the Reichstag in response to the scandal. ‘While before the Party’s position was that intervention in China was pointless, it is now clear that the intervention actively harms the Chinese people. Our continued military presence undermines Chinese rule of law, and their attempts to build a stable, functioning country we can partner with against Japan.’"
 qieflavor.4.a: "Damn!"

 qieflavor.5.t: "Media Silence"
 qieflavor.5.d: "It appears that our decision to let the young German we apprehended in a raid on a brothel off without as much as a warning turned out better than expected. The boy was transferred to Tianjin, and Zhang Beijiao, the police officer who let him go, was given a raise to reward his ‘quick political thinking’."
 qieflavor.5.a: "Finally, good news!"

 qieflavor.7.t: "Prince Rui Requests a Commission!"
 qieflavor.7.d: "Aisin-Gioro Zaixun, Prince Rui and navy minister in the cabinet of 1911, has come to us with a request. Following the promotion of the young coup backers from the Baoding academy, he requests a full naval commission! While it is true many of the admirals have lingering Zhili connections, they are mostly loyal to us. Zaixun, despite having travelled extensively to study foreign navies has never actually commanded a ship in battle, and many are sceptical of his actual naval prowess."
 qieflavor.7.a: "Promote him."
 qieflavor.7.b: "What? Of course not!"

 qieflavor.8.t: "Bandits Run Wild!"
 qieflavor.8.d: "The 'soldiers of the forest' we hired have gone wild! Over the last few weeks they have pillaged friendly towns and even attacked government troops over women and loot! What should we do?"
 qieflavor.8.a: "Arrest and execute them!"
 qieflavor.8.b: "Let them stay."

 qieflavor.9.t: "The Lindbergh of the East"
 qieflavor.9.d: "A young pilot named Sun Tonggang has earned great renown for flying across Eurasia in his custom self-built aircraft. With the recent upheavals within the League, he has volunteered to serve our nation as a pilot, destroying our enemies from the skies! Originally based in Nanjing, he has fled the chaos currently enveloping the city for our territory in his small plane."
 qieflavor.9.a: "Great!"

 qieflavor.10.t: "A Refugee from New York"
 qieflavor.10.d: "Edith Clifford Williams, an American artist, author, and librarian, has maintained a long-running correspondence with Hu Shih after the two met in New York while Hu was studying at Columbia University in New York City. She had an immense influence in developing Hu's political thought, and it is suspected (though unconfirmed) that the two were briefly lovers.\n\nWith war ravaging America, however, Williams has written to Shih, requesting asylum and refugee status in China. Hu has accepted, and Williams is currently en route to Beijing aboard a ship."
 qieflavor.10.a: "Welcome to China!"

 qieflavor.11.t: "The Houmuwu Ding"
 qieflavor.11.d: "Archaeological excavations around Anyang, Henan Province, have unearthed a massive bronze burial vessel from the Shang Dynasty. Thought to be the largest ancient bronze in the world, its discovery has been celebrated around the world as a massive victory for Chinese culture and history. With the threat of war with Japan looming however, archaeologists have reburied the sarcophagus, hoping that once we have defeated Japan we can exhibit it safely in a museum."
 qieflavor.11.a: "A great victory for Chinese culture!"

 qieflavor.12.t: "The Clique of Strategies of the Warring States"
 qieflavor.12.d: "Following the ascension of the YCP, an organisation made up of intellectuals who studied in Germany called the 'Clique of Zhan Guo Ce' has emerged. They believe in statism, authoritarianism and Nietzsche's superhuman philosophy, but adapted to Chinese circumstances, promoting an esoteric blend of Confucianism with Nietzscheian philosophical thought. In particular, they see China's recent history, and near future, as repeat of China's historical "cyclical" warring states periods; brutal, uncompromising times, in which the weak are, one by one, consumed by the strong. Thus, they believe that forming a strong nation is paramount, but hold a pluralistic outlook on Chinese nationalism.\n\nGroups affiliated with this school of thought have started to crop up in major Chinese universities, and are lending much credence to our new government."
 qieflavor.12.a: "Interesting."

 qieflavor.13.t: "A Late-Night Card Game"
 qieflavor.13.d: "Night fell over the newly-inaugurated Presidential Palace in Beijing as President [QIE.GetLeader] and Wu Peifu played an evening game of cards. The two men discussed politics, current events, and the current state of the world. [QIE.GetLeader] played a great hand while Wu looked at him through narrow eyes.\n\n'You might relish the hand you just played.' Wu started. 'But remember - who dealt you the cards that led to you sitting in this building?'.\n\n[QIE.GetLeader] raised an eyebrow. 'The Constitutional Convention selected me, of course.'\n\n'Do you *really* believe that?' asked Wu. 'I thought you were far smarter than that.'\n\n[QIE.GetLeader] leaned back in his chair. 'The state is only as strong as its military, I suppose. Still - you are not immortal. One day we will need a true democracy once our period of guidance of the nation comes to an end.'\n\n'We will see,' said Wu, lighting a cigarette and staring out over the city."
 qieflavor.13.a: "From where does political power grow?"

 qieflavor.14.t: "An Exiled General from the Qing Arrives"
 qieflavor.14.d: "While our military does not reach the standard of loyalty seen in Western powers, we pride ourselves in meritocracy. The commanders and field marshals you see on the battlefield have proven their loyalty to their leader and the people. On the other hand, victory could hinge on the deadly will exhibited by some of the more mercenary commanders, those willing to do-or-die. This man comes to us from the tumultuous Qing, whose cliques have relied heavily on mercenary commanders in the past. The general tells us a sob story of how the tides turned against him, and he came ragged to us ready to fight the good fight for once. Whether he is genuine is hard to determine, but we must decide if he is worth recruiting in this already-traitorous times."
 qieflavor.14.a: "We need all the help we can get"
 qieflavor.14.b: "No, he could be a liability"

 qieflavor.15.t: "[ANQ.GetLeader] Affirms our Leadership"
 qieflavor.15.d: "Governor Chen Tiaoyuan of Anqing formally re-affirmed Puyi's leadership of China today in a radio speech broadcast across his territory. While he admitted initially finding the idea of an Emperor anachronistic, he followed that up by enthusiastically endorsing our new anti-concession stance, and Puyi's devotion to the cause. He concluded his speech with admiration for the Zhili leadership. 'An apolitical figurehead can be useful in a modern state. And with Wu Peifu and Cao Kun at the helm of our great nation, we can drive out the foreign scum who have polluted our country, and restore it to greatness!'\n\nThe speech was well received by intellectuals in Beijing and other urban areas, and some have begun to desert the NCERA and YCP for the Harmony Association, bolstering our popularity and legitimacy among the general population."
 qieflavor.15.a: "Great news!"

 qieflavor.16.t: "Chen Tiaoyuan - Model Governor"
 qieflavor.16.d: "Chen Tiaoyuan, governor of Anqing, has consolidated his rule after his victory over the Nanjing Clique in the League Collapse, and while he is technically part of our government, the province enjoys a large degree of autonomy. After the League War concluded, some Zhili generals insisted on directly integrating the province into our government, but this was largely rejected due to the fragility of our own regime.\n\nIt seems now that keeping Chen's autonomy was the right move. He has just announced a massive reform project for the province, promising major industrial and legal reform. The news was greeted with enthusiasm from many business leaders in our territory, as following the German military mission's withdrawal they have sought new markets to trade with."
 qieflavor.16.a: "Great!"

 qieflavor.17.t: "Chen Tiaoyuan Seeks to Mend the North-South Zhili Divide"
 qieflavor.17.d: "Ever since the conclusion of the 4th Zhili-Fengtian War and the German Intervention in 1927, the Northern and Southern halves of the Zhili Clique, lead by Wu Peifu and Sun Chuanfang respectively, have drifted apart. Now Chen Tiaoyuan, governor of Anqing and member of the Southern Clique has begun a concerted effort to mend the divide between the two. The top levels of both groups are open to the merger, but the more junior officers may harbour grudges against the other cliques, seeing potential competitions for promotion as the cliques draw closer together. Still, this is overall a good development."
 qieflavor.17.a: "Excellent"

 qieflavor.18.t: "Chen Tiaoyuan Proposes Joint Troop Training Exercises"
 qieflavor.18.d: "Following his efforts to mend the North-South Zhili divide, Governor Chen Tiaoyuan of Anqing has offered to host joint training exercises between our troops outside of Anqing city. His troops have learned much in their struggles against the Nanjing clique, and we both have much to learn from each other."
 qieflavor.18.a: "Good to hear"

 qieflavor.19.t: "Former German Factories Reopen"
 qieflavor.19.d: "After announcing our intentions to nationalise German factories in Beijing, many in our government feared backlash from the German government. Yet with Black Monday absorbing most of their attention, we were able to conclude nationalisation with little consequences. We have drawn up plans to distribute factory ownership to a variety of loyal contractors but we now face a question - what should these factories produce? Previously they produced bulk consumer goods to be shipped back to Germany, and could easily be retooled to do the same for our population. Alternatively, they could easily be modified to produce military support supplies such as blankets and cooking equipment, but having them produce weapons or actual ammunition would be prohibitively expensive."
 qieflavor.19.a: "Civilian goods"
 qieflavor.19.b: "Support supplies"

 qieflavor.20.t: "Kang Tongbei Rises to Prominence"
 qieflavor.20.d: "While Kang Youwei, the reformer whose works the NCERA are primarily based around, has been dead since 1927, his daughter Kang Tongbei inherited her father's genius and political talent. A graduate of Barnard College in New York City, she returned to China in 1911 to help agitate for women's rights and feminism. As the NCERA gained prominence in the tumultuous years after the German intervention and the Restoration, Kang's ideas of women's empowerment became increasingly popular within some intellectual circles, while alienating some of the more conservative members of the party. With our recent efforts to honour her father, some have suggested elevating her to a full minister position within our government, both as a symbol of our direct inheritance of the legacy of Kang Youwei and as a symbol of our modernity. Others counter that this would be too controversial, and instead argue that she should continue to promote her work at the local level."
 qieflavor.20.a: "Appoint her to the ministry!"
 qieflavor.20.b: "Let her continue her work at the local level"

 qieflavor.21.t: "The Emperor and the Zhili: Two Pillars of China's Independence"
 qieflavor.21.d: "Our recent support of anti-concession intellectual movements appears to have been remarkably successful, with more and more of Beijing's nascent intelligentsia writing papers and pamphlets in support of our government. A personal favourite of Wu Peifu's, published in a journal originating in the fiercely anti-warlord May Fourth movement, is 'The Emperor and the Zhili: Two Pillars of China's Independence'. A concise tract, it holds up Wu and his clique as bastions of China's fight against foreign domination, with the Emperor as a powerful symbol of China's modernisation. Zhang Zuolin and his Fengtian government are denounced as foreign parasites, leeching Manchuria's mineral wealth and sending it back to Japan while leaving the population impoverished."
 qieflavor.21.a: "Great!"

 qieflavor.22.t: "Mending the Military's Generational Divide"
 qieflavor.22.d: "There has long been a generational gap in China's officer corps. Among the older generals, born before the upheavals of 1911 and the ensuring Warlord Era, tradition and suspicion of modernisation reign supreme. Scarred by the violence and unrest that dominated most of their lives, they are politically flexible but lean conservative, hoping to restore the China of their youth. Younger officers, on the other hand, were born in or just before the Warlord Era, and tend to favour more radical political positions.\n\nOur decision to better integrate the Baoding Army cadets into the Zhili patronage and loyalty systems has paid off, with many of the younger officers abandoning their support for the YCP and joining the Harmony Association. Some of the older generals who were sceptical of Wu's about-face regarding German support have also become more supportive of his regime, owing to conversations with their new, more politically active subordinates."
 qieflavor.22.a: "Great news!"

 qieflavor.23.t: "Wu Peifu Ennobled"
 qieflavor.23.d: "Earlier this month the Emperor announced a new set of noble titles and awards. Rather than the arcane and opaque system used in the pre-restoration Qing, these new ranks followed a model similar to most western titles. The highest rank of these is 'Duke' (Gong), only to be given to those who have 'Given the Utmost Service or Sacrifice for the Emperor and China'. The first, and so far sole recipient of this honour is to be Marshal Wu Peifu - now Duke of Qi.\n\nIn a lavish ceremony Wu solemnly accepted the honorific from the Emperor, vowing to continue to protect him and the nation for 'as long as he drew breath'."
 qieflavor.23.a: "Long live the Duke!"

 qieflavor.24.t: "The General and the Emperor"
 qieflavor.24.d: "In a highly orchestrated ceremony today, Puyi invited Wu Peifu to the Forbidden city for an 'informal' luncheon. Carefully choreographed to look as 'relaxed' as possible, the two men sat together eating and discussing various matters of importance including modernising the military, reforming the bureaucracy, and other topics. After lunch, the two men were joined by the Emperor's brother, Pujie, outside the city for a brief ride on horseback. Cameras recorded the entire spectacle, and newsreel footage of the event has already been shown in cinemas in the major cities of China, as well as distributed to international agencies, which will show them that we have modernised without becoming just another Western puppet!"
 qieflavor.24.a: "I hope they had a nice lunch"

 qieflavor.25.t: "German-Owned Sweatshops Open"
 qieflavor.25.d: "Major Chinese cities have seen an explosion of German factory construction following our relaxation of international investment laws. While this no doubt helps boost our economy, a number of them have engaged in somewhat dubious business practices, no doubt motivated the practically non-existent labour laws in our country compared to those in Mitteleuropa. Earlier this morning, a minor scandal erupted when it was discovered that one German factory was forcing its employees to work 20-hour shifts for next to no pay. Even worse, the factory had cut a deal with the local police to arrest and intimidate any worker who complained or made a formal protest, making us look like little more than foreign stooges."
 qieflavor.25.a: "Oh well..."

 qieflavor.26.t: "German Railways Receive Praise"
 qieflavor.26.d: "While many protested the invitation of German railroad engineers to build our infrastructure, a few months on common people have already expressed praise for the improvements to the rail system. Maddeningly complex rail gauges have been standardised across the provinces, and corrupt local station owners who charged extortionate fees for tickets have been fired in favour of a standardised system for prices. Military benefits of a modern rail network aside, the German's reform of our rail system is earning overwhelming civilian praise as well."
 qieflavor.26.a: "You can always trust the Germans to make the trains run on time"

 qieflavor.27.t: "Imported Radios Well-Received by Troops"
 qieflavor.27.d: "Although some in the Finance Ministry balked at the exorbitant cost of importing hundreds of cutting-edge Siemens radios from Germany, our generals report them to be overwhelmingly popular with the officer corps. In a recent action to suppress bandits in the far north of our territory, groups of our soldiers were able to effectively split up and hunt down the bandits using the radios to stay in contact. These radios have immense battlefield potential, and already appear to have had a positive effect on our troops."
 qieflavor.27.a: "Great!"

 qieflavor.28.t: "The Fall of Luoyang"
 qieflavor.28.d: "After a prolonged struggle, the ancient walls of Luoyang have fallen to [FROM.GetName] forces. The city served as Wu Peifu's headquarters for many years, and only a matter of hours earlier its last government officials, still loyal to the Jade Marshal, evacuated with all manner of secret papers and war plans in their armoured cars. Much of the city's population fled too, well aware of the impending attack, while the rest hunkered down to ride out the storm.\n\nNow the city lies practically deserted and burning, a shell of its former self, and a symbol of our desperate struggle for survival."
 qieflavor.28.a: "Luoyang will be avenged!"

 qieflavor.100.t: "Aisin-Gioro Xianyu"
 qieflavor.100.d: "Aisin-Gioro Xianyu, better known in Japanese as Yoshio Kawashima, is a Manchu noblewoman and distant cousin of Puyi who has risen to great prominence in the Qing court over the last few years. Despite her young age, she has proven herself an adept schemer and intriguer, and has worked with the Zongshe Party to advance the goals of the Manchu nobility.\n\nBrought up in a Japanese family after she was given up for adoption in 1915, some around Puyi have questioned her loyalty to our nation. During the Emperor's exile in Tianjin, the young Xianyu pushed for Puyi to work with the Japanese instead of the Germans, a stance that put her at odds with many of the Emperor's closer family. Nearly a decade later, however, many are willing to forgive that as an act of youthful ignorance, and she has quickly made herself a force to be reckoned with."
 qieflavor.100.a: "Interesting"
