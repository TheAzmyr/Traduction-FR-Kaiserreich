A native to Hunan, Tang Shengzhi has successfully clawed back power after over a decade. A graduate of Baoding military academy and a staunch Buddhist, Tang enjoyed a prominent role in Hunan's military before internal tensions resulted in his defection to the National Revolutionary Army during the Northern Expedition. There, he was appointed Governor for the KMT, but was ultimately driven out with the collapse of the NRA. Forced into exile, his brother's prominence and his shrewd political scheming has allowed for him to return to Hunan and successfully challenge sitting governor Zhao Hengti in elections.\n\nTriumphant, Tang now seeks to implement his version of Buddhist Socialism. His doctrine holds that Buddhism and socialism are identical, materialism and spiritualism are interconnected. This, however, hardly means he can take Buddhist support for granted, and to many his approaches to the faith are far too revolutionary. It remains to be seen if this so-called Buddhist general can truly transform Hunan for the better."
 HNN_tang_shengzhi_commander_desc: "§YGeneral Description\nBorn:§! §gOctober 12th, 1889, in Dong'an County, Hunan Province, Qing Empire§!\n§YMilitary Career:§! §gAfter successfully enrolling in Baoding military academy, Tang Shengzhi would begin a long career in Hunan as an officer in Zhao Hengti's Clique. As Zhao emerged victorious in the 1921 election, he would bring Tang to prominence but this alliance would soon end with Tang growing jealous of Zhao's favouritism towards other military commands. Tang bided his time however, and saw his chance with the 1926 Northern Expedition. Joining up with the National Revolutionary Army, Tang ousted his former master and established his own administration under the auspices of the KMT. Deviating from his new bosses however, he began a Buddhisisation campaign, a syncretic Buddhist-Leftist programme. This would not last long however, before German intervention allowed for the Zhili government pushed out KMT forces from the region and brought Zhao back in tow. Tang fled to the concessions, where he would hide for several years in exile.\n\nThis was not the end however of Tang Shengzhi. Tang Shengming, his younger brother, proved popular enough to remain a general within the Hunan military and soon enough was able to rekindle support among the officers for Tang Shengzhi to return. Taking a risk, the older Tang returned to Hunan where Zhao proved too weak to order his arrest, instead opting to outmanoeuvre his old General in elections. Tang, for his part, has decided to take the political route as well - but regardless it is clear that his position in the military will be difficult to dislodge..."

 HNN_cheng_qian_leader_desc: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! March 31st, 1882, in Liling, Hunan Province, Qing Empire\n§YPolitical Career:§! Cheng Qian was raised in a wealthy family of landlords and received a classic Confucian education. This allowed him to pass the civil service examination and study at Changsha's Yuelu Academy before switching over to a military career at Hunan Military Academy. Later, he would go to Japan for further studies, where he met budding leaders of the Tongmenghui. He would convert to their cause after meeting Sun Yat-sen, and after graduation from the Imperial Japanese Army Academy, he would join the Xinhai revolution breaking out in 1911. A long-time KMT general, he would lead the NRA's invasion of Hunan during the Northern expedition and join the establishment of a provincial government under Tang Shengzhi. The failure of the expedition however, saw Cheng go into exile - at least until the emergence of a rebellion in Fujian. There he would again rise to prominence. However, with the announcement of a new election in Hunan, Cheng decided to go on leave from his post and contest the Governorship from sitting governor Zhao Hengti.\n\nWith Cheng emerging victorious in the election, he is now free to begin implementing the Three Principles of the People and the KMT programme in the province. However, he is looked upon with some suspicion by his former comrades, despite his supposed loyalty to the left-leaning Central Committee many believe he secretly continues to affiliate with the rightist elements of the KMT..."
 HNN_cheng_qian_commander_desc: "§YGeneral Description\nBorn:§! §gMarch 31st, 1882, in Liling, Hunan Province, Qing Empire§!\n§YMilitary Career:§! §gBorn to a prosperous landlord family in Hunan, Cheng received a traditional Confucian education and passed the imperial examinations with the first degree in the hopes of becoming a scholar. However, realising the political situation of late 19th century China, he instead pursued a career in the military. He attended the Hunan Military Academy and then went to Japan, where he studied and met revolutionaries such as Huang Xing, Song Jiaoren, and Li Liejun. In 1905, he met Sun Yat-sen and joined Sun’s Tongmenghui. He would graduate from the Imperial Japanese Academy alongside Tang Jiyao, specialising in the field of artillery.\n\nWhen the Xinhai Revolution broke out in 1911, he took part in the Battle of Changsha. He then became military governor of Hunan but was driven out when Yuan Shikai took power. He would demonstrate his loyalty to Sun’s ideals by joining the Kuomintang and aiding Sun in the National Protection War and the Constitutional Protection Movements. One of Sun’s closest allies in his war against Chen Jiongming, he became a military instructor preparing for the Northern expedition.\n\nHowever, when the Northern Expedition did come, he led the Sixth Army in the Battle for Nanchang. However, after the expedition’s defeat, he retreated with the remnants of the National Revolutionary Army to the MinGan Insurgent Zone. Nonetheless, he still commands a great deal of respect in Hunan, and it is likely that he still holds a lot of political influence there."

A graduate from Whampoa Military academy in 1926, on the eve of the Northern expedition, he would join the KMT and his elder brother in their efforts to liberate China. Although initially successful, the expedition would collapse with German intervention. Despite the elder Tang's exile from Hunan following the failure of the Northern Expedition and his Buddhist Socialist programme, Tang Shengming's rare ability to get along with virtually anybody resulted in him remaining in Hunan and even gaining a position of prominence within the Hunan military. He has secretly utilised this position to rehabilitate his brother's image among the people and also cultivate extensive ties within the military. He hopes to smoothen the way for a return of Tang Shengzhi and the rise of the Hunan Buddhisisation Society."

However, his unruly nature as a child resulted in him being sent to a private school, where he was given a strict education. He would enrol in the Hunan Military academy in 1905, before going to Japan to study. There he would join the Tongmenghui, participating in the Xinhai revolution before returning to Hunan in 1916 to join its local army. Although initially joining the Kuomintang during their Northern Expedition into Hunan, a timely defection by He Yaozu and his division helped shield him from the major political ramifications of the defeat. Although talented, his past associations means he is not likely to rise above a regional level of authority - however he remains a prominent member of the Hunan military staff."

 HNN_peng_dehuai: "Peng Dehuai"
 HNN_peng_dehuai_commander_desc: "§YGeneral Description\nBorn:§! §gOctober 24th, 1888, in Xiangtan County, Hunan Province, Qing Empire§!\n§YMilitary Career:§! §gPeng Dehuai was born in the village of Shixiang to a poor family of farmers. Although his family did not have much in the way of means, Peng would listen to his grandfather, a veteran of the Taiping rebellion, describe the ideals of social and economic equality. Initially able to go to a traditional Confucian school, his family's declining economic prosperity forced him to withdraw and beg for money to help support his family. After losing many of his family members to poverty, including his mother, he found himself working at a coal mine. It was around then that the Xinhai revolution broke out - and Peng found himself further destitute as the economy declined. He would join a local warlord army as an enlisted man and rise through the ranks - at one point his regiment joined with Tang Shengzhi's army. There Peng fought for Sun Yat-sen's forces against Wu Peifu's local allies. His attempt to join the Kuomintang in 1922 left him disillusioned however, and he initially returned home to become a farmer. Dissatisfied, he then applied to the Hunan military academy, taking on the name Dehuai. His regiment would initially back the Kuomintang during its invasion of Hunan, but Peng himself hesitated. This hesitation proved to be useful when the tide turned, and Peng successfully defected back to Zhili lines."

A battalion commander, two years after his graduation he would build a guerilla force to resist an invasion by Zhang Jingyao, which earned him the attention of Cheng Qian who promoted him as commander of local guerilla forces. Tang Shengzhi would then take him under his wing, and He Jian would fight for the Kuomintang during the Northern Expedition. The collapse of the NRA in 1927, however, initially set him adrift but a general amnesty in Hunan for those who were willing to defect proved to be a fortuitous opportunity for many of Tang's subordinates. He Jian now finds himself in the service of the Hunan military, but it is widely speculated that his loyalties, as well as many others, remain with Tang rather than Zhao."

He was then admitted into the first class of Whampoa military academy, and became the youngest graduate of the academy in 1924, joining the Kuomintang shortly afterwards. A friend of Chen Geng, he would initially flirt with the leftist part of the party, but the collapse of the Kuomintang in 1927 meant the future of the then 20 year old officer was drastically altered. Set adrift, he went to Japan to study for several years before returning home to Hunan to offer his services. There, he found plenty of old associates of Cheng Qian and the KMT serving in the Hunan army and was able to leverage his connections to slowly achieve a place of prominence in the regional forces."

Nonetheless, it would appear he had inherited some military skills from his father, a minor Qing officer, and at age 20 he began his long career as a guerilla leader after he killed a tax assessor out of revenge for the murder of his indebted uncle. Since then his legend as an outlaw and a Robin-hood figure has only grown, as He Long and his trusty signature knife built a local army right in time for the rise of the Kuomintang in 1920. A teacher and commander during the Northern expedition, He Long would soon find himself aligned with socialist elements of the party while serving under Zhang Fakui. The defeat of the KMT during the Northern Expedition has not sated his desire for change in China, and though he has fled back home to Hunan, he still commands the respect of his soldiers. His skills as a revolutionary are not to be underestimated, and he will be a useful asset to any army."

An eager socialist and affiliate of the Chinese Syndicalist Party, he would serve as chairman of the Hunan Provincial Farmer’s Association. The failure of the Northern expedition drove the young officer underground, where he would lead a brief resistance before accepting a general amnesty offer to join the local Hunan army under Peng Dehuai. A promising officer, Teng has achieved regional prominence despite his previous ties with revolutionary groups.

In 1923 Zhao gave Ye command over Hunan’s Third Division\n\nWhen the Northern Expedition came to Hunan it was Ye Kaixin who immediately brought his army against Tang Shengzhi, but was forced out of Hunan and fled with Zhao to Wu Peifu and the Zhili. Wu made Ye the Commander-in-Chief of the Hunan Army, and when the Northern Expedition turned to favour the Zhili, it was Ye’s forces that recaptured Changsha, bringing it under Zhili control officially, but it was an open secret that Ye wanted to bring Zhao back into power in Hunan.\n\nLuckily for the General, Wu Peifu decided to appoint Zhao as the Governor of Hunan, and civilian control over the province soon came back as the KMT’s forces were driven out. While not the biggest fan of Sun Chuanfang, he accepted Hunan’s entrance into the League of Eight Provinces, although he prefers to keep his army on the eastern border, not trusting Sun to accept Hunan’s autonomy, or put down the insurgency in the Min-Gan zone.\n\nFor nearly the last decade, Ye Kaixin has been satisfied with the Status Quo, loyal to Zhao and friendly with the Northern Zhili, he’s one of the main Generals Zhao can rely on without worry, and has enjoyed the support of the Governor of Hunan."

 HNN_Provincial_Curriculum_desc: "We must reform our curriculum to fit Buddhist Socialism and create a more effective way to teach and learn.

 HNN_Provincial_Stability_desc: "The socialists have been destroyed, and with them, many organs of popular dissent. Quarterlies, village loudmouths, and the like have all been silenced. We can not allow new rabblerousers to simply rise in their place. Villages must all have officials whose sole occupation is to ensure the correct information reaches the masses."

 HNN_Drive_out_Federalism: "Drive out Cheng's Supporters"
 HNN_Drive_out_Federalism_desc: "By the standards of the present KMT, Cheng Qian is quite the moderate. His advocacy, however, undermines our control in this most dangerous of times.

 HNN_Foster_Patriotism_desc: "As but a province of China with considerably diversity, few identify solely as Hunanese. By stressing our place within the greater Chinese project and the values we aspire to, we can begin to at least cultivate patriotic feeling, if not a unified identity."

 HNN_The_Anti_Socialist_Campaign: "The Anti-Socialist Campaign"
 HNN_The_Anti_Socialist_Campaign_desc: "Socialism is an endless font of moral corruption. Indeed, perhaps even our greatest foes on the left could have been allies in some other world where they had not heard its siren song. To precipitate more targeted future campaigns, we must make the people aware of the wickedness of socialism."

 HNN_The_Question_of_Women: "Empower Hunanese Women"
 HNN_The_Question_of_Women_desc: "Traditionally, women are expected to stay at home, but this practice does not fit the demands of this day and age. Auxiliary roles and positions in factories and workshops should be filled be the nation's patriotic women, freeing men for service on the frontlines."

 HNN_Zun_Lao: "New Filial Piety"
 HNN_Zun_Lao_desc: "Filial Piety, or Xiao, is the pillar of our society.

In the end, we are all children of Hunan, and we will protect it together!"

 HNN_Study_Sanmin_Zhuyi: "Study Sanmin Zhuyi"
 HNN_Study_Sanmin_Zhuyi_desc: "Minzu - a uniquely Chinese nationalism, Minquan - popular empowerment, and Minsheng - popular welfare, these are the Three Principles of the People. Laid down by Sun Yat-sen, they guide the Kuomintang to this day, often inspiring a near-religious fervour. We must encourage the study of this great ideology, perhaps to the point of the bureaucratic examinations of old."

 HNN_Our_Own_Path: "Our Own Path"

 HNN_Improve_Farmer_Livelihoods: "Improve Farmer Livelihoods"
 HNN_Improve_Farmer_Livelihoods_desc: "While many politicians focus on the demands of the cities, most of China remains rural. To secure the people's hearts and minds, we must also ensure farmers can survive times of hardship. When prices fall, the government should pick up the slack."

 HNN_Social_Welfare_Program: "Social Welfare Programme"
 HNN_Social_Welfare_Program_desc: "The scope and nature of social welfare is evolving rapidly. While European nations now offer robust pension programmes and services, such are not present anywhere in China. We should remedy this and at least begin to offer to the most destitute the most basic of necessities."

 HNN_Zhiquan_Reform_Provincial_Administration: "Zhiquan - Reform Administration"
 HNN_Zhiquan_Reform_Provincial_Administration_desc: "Zhiquan, the powers of the administration, describes Sun Yat-sen's idea of a government made up of five distinct branches. We must reorganise our regime along these lines."

 HNN_Religious_Unity: "Through Service, Harmony"
 HNN_Religious_Unity_desc: "Mixed regiments during a time of crisis were a great boon for the Xiang army. Our expanding party apparatus has become increasingly factionalised, and to combat that, we should look to the Xiang model. All party members, no matter their rank, must be made to regularly work with their hands to beautify their municipalities. Through these mixed Beautification Corps, we shall have harmony."

 HNN_Education_Reform: "Education Reform"
 HNN_Education_Reform_desc: "Members of Zhao Hengti's government made ambitious promises towards academia. We cannot allow this insidious influence to undermine our rule. We must institute broad education reforms and invest greatly in the sector to combat the influence of his cronies."

 HNN_Rural_Literacy: "Rural Literacy"

 HNN_Enforce_Democracy: "Enforce Democracy"

 HNN_Reform_the_Status_Quo: "Save the Textile Industry"
 HNN_Reform_the_Status_Quo_desc: "The textile industry in Changsha faces great financial difficulty. We can't afford to let it shrink down. We have to use provincial protectionism to save our industry."

 HNN_The_Arsenals_of_the_South_desc: "Hu Shuhua, a metallurgist serving in the provincial government, has submitted a detailed report on Hunan's great potential to develop heavy industry.

 HNN_Subsidies_to_Military_Industry_desc: "Zhuzhou, a city along the Xiang River and the Guangzhou-Wuchang railway, has been chosen as the site for an ambitious development plan, thanks to its industrial potential.

 HNN_Renovate_Yuelu_Academy: "Modernise Yuelu Academy"
 HNN_Renovate_Yuelu_Academy_desc: "The Yuelu Academy has a prestigious history dating back to 976 under the Song dynasty. Despite a superficial reform effort under some of the more forward-thinking warlords who have occupied Hunan over the years, the ancient name and legacy continue to resist attempts at forming a more modern curriculum. We must refound it as Hunan University, and improve our capacity for scientific advancement."

 HNN_Promote_Innovations: "An Army of Equals"
 HNN_Promote_Innovations_desc: "A Buddhist army is an army of equals.

 HNN_Not_One_Step_Back: "No Death, No Fear"
 HNN_Not_One_Step_Back_desc: "Buddhists know that life and death are ephemeral, and sacrifice for the greater good should not be feared. Tan Sitong, a martyr in the late Qing era from Hunan and also a student of Buddhism, led by example. With the support of the monks we can thoroughly indoctrinate our soldiers. Ideology is more powerful than guns to arm a military force in China. Our soldiers must be able to sacrifice their lives to serve and save Hunan and the country."

 HNN_New_Officers: "Grassroots Officers"
 HNN_New_Officers_desc: "As we take down factionalism in the army and our armed forces expand, a new generation of junior officers is needed.

 HNN_Support_on_the_Front_Lines_desc: "Not only has artillery has fundamentally altered warfare, the propagation of artillery is our duty as a virtuous land; let no man fall without at least an effort of support from his comrades in faith and arms. If we are to be victorious, we must improve our arsenal."

 HNN_Increase_Motorisation: "Increase Motorisation"
 HNN_Increase_Motorisation_desc: "Our army may possess the supplies, discipline, and fighting spirit that distinguishes a modern force - yet all this is useless if those supplies cannot reach the frontline, or if our brave men are gunned down because they are practically immobile against our more nimble enemies. The southern tradition of war, enhanced with modern technology, will make us unstoppable on campaign!"

 HNN_The_Changsha_Airport_desc: "To house and fly our planes, we will need to open a military air base in Changsha, where our airplanes are located. A location has been decided on the outskirts of the city, a plan has been drawn, and all we need to do now is to build it."

 HNN_Import_Fighters: "Foreign Fighters"
 HNN_Import_Fighters_desc: "We have decided to try out warfare in the air. For this, we have requisitioned 25 Fokker aircraft from the German Empire, which are to be imported to Hunan Province up the Yangtze from the Aufsrichsrat der Ostasiatischen Generalverwaltung.

 HNN_country_intro_header: "The Province of Hunan"
 HNN_country_intro_content: "The Xiang Clique in Hunan was once a major clique in Southern China. Under the leadership of the two cliques of Tan Yankai and Tang Xiangming, the province of Hunan was influential in Southern Chinese and Tongmenghui politics.\n\nIn 1916, Tang Jiyao declared the independence of Yunnan, leading to multiple other provinces declaring independence along with it - Guangxi, Guizhou, Guangdong, Zhejiang, and many others. Hunan found itself under siege, and the National Protection Alliance appointed Tang Shengzhi, the Buddhist General, as the provincial governor. He enacted his Buddhisisation Programme, but was pushed back a few years later, being replaced by the Federalist Zhao Hengti as governor. After the Zhili victory over the Kuomintang in the Northern Expedition, Hunan it was incorporated into the League of Eight Provinces, with Zhao Hengti declaring his personal allegiance to lie with Sun Chuanfang in Nanjing."

### Events ###
 hnn.1.t: "Hunan Breaks from the League"
 hnn.1.d: "With Sun Chuanfang's death, Hunan, one of the already autonomous provinces of the League of Eight Provinces, has regained full provincial autonomy under Zhao Hengti once again. The times ahead are turbulent ones - Tang Shengming, the brother of Tang Shengzhi, is making attempts to bring his brother back to Hunan and into power once again. Cheng Qian, a supporter of the KMT and a commander in the NRA, also looks to take over the province.\n\nTo the south is the Liangguang Clique, led by Chen Jiongming. Even though Zhao Hengti claims to be a federalist, Chen shows it. To the west are the Cliques of Sichuan and Yunnan, eyeing us with hungry looks. To the North are Hunan's friends - the Northern Zhili, but their power may not last forever."
 hnn.1.a: "It is time for action."

#Choosing Path Events

 hnn.2.t: "Restoration of the Hunan Provincial Constitution"
 hnn.2.d: "Zhao Hengti, the governor, is obsessed with legal procedures, no matter how rigged they are. Because of this, he has suggested that the province restore the old provincial constitution enacted in the 1920s. The future of the province depends on his decision."
 hnn.2.a: "Restore the Constitution!"
 hnn.2.b: "Pfft, who even needs legal procedures?"

 hnn.3.t: "The Constitution Restored"
 hnn.3.d: "We have decided to restore the constitution. We are now, in name and in some way in government, a democracy. We shall keep our land free and safe, and all our citizens will know the freedom of Hunan."
 hnn.3.a: "Three cheers for Hunan!"

 hnn.4.t: "The Constitution Rejected"
 hnn.4.d: "We have decided to reject the restoration of the constitution. We are a province, not a republic. There is no need for us to do so, to repeat the mistakes of our past that led to us becoming part of the League. Governor Zhao has torn up the Constitution with his hands and left it to burn. It has been decided - Hunan will no longer be democratic."
 hnn.4.a: "Three cheers for Hunan!"

 hnn.5.t: "Elections Announced"
 hnn.5.d: "With the restoration of the Hunan Provincial Constitution, Governor Zhao Hengti has decided to announce the new Hunan provincial elections. Candidates will need to announce themselves to run, and the people will be allowed to choose between them, depending on how they would like Hunan to be run and under what sort of governorship. All Hunanese can run, but not many are actually interested in politics. It is also suspected by many that Zhao Hengti has some tricks up his sleeve regarding the elections..."
 hnn.5.a: "A victory for Constitutionalism!"

 hnn.6.t: "Tang Shengzhi Returns to Hunan"
 hnn.6.d: "The Buddhist General, Tang Shengzhi, former governor of Hunan, has returned to the province today. After hearing about the constitution being restored, the Buddhist General decided to pack up his bags and move back from Hong Kong to Hunan. With the help of his brother, General Tang Shengming, Tang Shengzhi is temporarily staying in an inn in Changsha. He has not done anything yet, but many believe the former governor to have come back to run for governor. Indeed, he is quite popular within the military and the general populace for his 'Revolutionary Socialism' and Buddhisisation policies, and if he were to run, he would prove quite the threat to Zhao Hengti's reign."
 hnn.6.a: "What might he be planning to do?"

 hnn.7.t: "Cheng Qian leaves For Hunan"
 hnn.7.d: "General Cheng Qian, originally from Hunan expressed a desire to contest that country's newly announced general elections. He was given the go-ahead for his plan and has now left for Hunan."
 hnn.7.a: "Hopefully he finds success."

 hnn.8.t: "Cheng Qian returns To Hunan"
 hnn.8.d_1: "While the nationalist revolt in Longyang was crushed, Cheng Qian, an old KMT agitator from our province, managed to escape with his life. He has now returned to Hunan and announced his candidacy in the provincial election. While he presently lacks a wide base of support, circumstances may allow him to build one, especially among the urban poor."
 hnn.8.d_2: "Cheng Qian, an old KMT agitator from our province, has returned to Hunan and announced his candidacy in the provincial election. While he presently lacks a wide base of support, circumstances may allow him to build one, especially among the urban poor."
 hnn.8.a: "He will not win."

 hnn.9.t: "Zhao Hengti in Hengyang"
 hnn.9.d: "Two days ago, Governor Zhao Hengti returned to his home city of Hengyang, in the hopes that he would convince the people from his hometown to vote for him. He visited his family along with old childhood friends, and made multiple speeches around the city, gathering the attention of many people. However, his countrymen were indifferent to him, and when the Governor slipped during his speech, the reaction to his presence was openly hostile. He was booed and insulted. It seems that the population of Hengyang has turned to the alternative candidates..."
 hnn.9.a: "The people are drawn to Tang's Buddhist rhetoric!"
 hnn.9.b: "Cheng wins the people to the Nationalist cause!"

 hnn.10.t: "Zhao Regroups"
 hnn.10.d: "After being skewered in his hometown, Zhao Hengti has taken a few days off from campaigning to establish a new strategy with his advisors."
 hnn.10.a: "Hopefully he finds his footing."

 hnn.11.t: "Campaign in Yiyang"
 hnn.11.d: "Cheng Qian has found support in the city of Yiyang and the surrounding region. In a rousing speech, he stressed his humble origins and desire for Hunan to stand on its own two feet potentially separate even from the KMT in Longyang. Zhao Hengti and Tang Shengzhi have attempted to respond to this surge in support for Cheng in the area. Who shall ultimately be the city's favoured candidate?"
 hnn.11.a: "Zhao's Federalist platform proves victorious!"
 hnn.11.b: "Tang's Buddhist policies secure popular support!"
 hnn.11.c: "The city swings decisively towards Cheng!"

 hnn.12.t: "Electoral Battle For Changde"
 hnn.12.d: "Tang Shengzhi chose to begin his campaign in Changde, and has made steady headway in that important city. Recently, however, controversy has erupted in the city over Tang's actions during the Constitution Protection Movement. If the flames of this controversy were to be fanned, Tang could lose the city."
 hnn.12.a: "Zhao turns the populace against Tang!"
 hnn.12.b: "Tang holds on!"
 hnn.12.c: "Cheng's visit fans the flames!"

 hnn.13.t: "Down To The Countryside"
 hnn.13.d: "Through the efforts of Tang Shengzhi's brother, Tang Shengming, Tang Shengzhi has redoubled his support in the countryside, particularly the highly populous countryside around Changsha. Unwilling to cede the peasantry, the vast majority of the population though not a particularly politicised group, Zhao Hengti and Cheng Qian have also gone down to the countryside to campaign. Who finds the greatest support?"
 hnn.13.a: "The peasants rally firmly around Zhao!"
 hnn.13.b: "Tang secures the support of the countryside!"
 hnn.13.c: "Cheng comes out on top by a wide margin!"

 hnn.14.t: "Shaoshan Incident"
 hnn.14.d: "Angered by Tang Shengzhi's land policies during his governorship and the apathy of Zhao Hengti, a group of intermediaries from the small backwater of Shaoshan have started an uproar which is now reverberating throughout the countryside. They demand that, whatever may come, the long immoral practice of bringing grains and cash crops grown by large estates to market, be recognised by the provincial government. Because many of these intermediaries themselves also run large farms stocked with hired labourers, their impact has been particularly large."
 hnn.14.a: "Zhao's impassioned pleas sway the peasantry to his side!"
 hnn.14.b: "Tang Shengzhi agrees to incorporate them into his land reform policies."
 hnn.14.c: "The incident sparks a wave of pro-Nationalist fervour!"

 hnn.15.t: "The Slums Of Changsha"
 hnn.15.d: "Changsha has grown greatly in recent years, spurred by economic change and the beginnings of industrialisation, especially as many peasants have sought protection from campaigns which have ravaged their villages. The shanties on the edge of the city have become substantial, and while considered a blight their residents must at least be pandered to if the illusion of universal male suffrage is to be maintained. Who best appeals to them?"
 hnn.15.a: "Zhao regains the support of the slum's residents!"
 hnn.15.b: "Tang's populism wins the residents over!"
 hnn.15.c: "The residents throw their support behind Cheng!"

#hnn.16 removed

 hnn.17.t: "The Voting Begins"
 hnn.17.d: "It is time for the people of Hunan to cast their votes as to who they think should lead the province. People from all over Hunan now gather at voting booths to cast their vote into the ballot, and Hunan will see the democratic dream of Zhao Hengti come true."
 hnn.17.a: "A new chapter in our history begins..."

#hnn.18 removed

 hnn.19.t: "The Governor"
 hnn.19.d: "There has been a shocking turn of events as Zhao Hengti has stripped the province of Hunan of most of its legal procedures. He has rebounded on his promises of elections for governorship. The cries of the people were not heard, and Zhao promises prosperity and a new Hunan."
 hnn.19.a: "Long live the Governor!"

 hnn.20.t: "Protests in Changsha"
 hnn.20.d: "On the streets of Changsha, the sky clouded by mist, one could barely see past the mountains and seas of people protesting. One could barely hear across the noise they were making. It was clear that the people were not for the new policies of the governor, and are calling out for a return of democracy to the province.\n\nZhao Hengti, however, has remained calm, lounging in his office chair all day, sending more and more guards out to crack down on the protestors."
 hnn.20.a: "So this is how democracy dies..."

 hnn.21.t: "Wu Peifu Supports Us"
 hnn.21.d: "In the North, Marshal Wu Peifu has sent a letter to us, promising to help us in our cause and to help Zhao Hengti. With the Hunan-Hubei border becoming ever so militarised, it seems as if Wu Peifu will retaliate against the anti-Zhao Hengti protests with force if they get too out of hand."
 hnn.21.a: "In times of need, we need a helping hand."

 hnn.22.t: "The Buddhist General Returns"
 hnn.22.d: "Amidst the rising tensions between the people and the Governor, General Tang Shengming managed to bring back his brother from Guizhou, where he was hiding in a small mountain village. Tang Shengzhi, the Buddhist General, entered Changsha today, his face instantly recognisable by the local citizens from his Buddhisisation propaganda back when he was a governor. He became a topic of hot debate overnight, with family dinners interrupted by provincial politics.\n\nHe is currently staying at his brother's residence in Changsha, and rumours have been circulating about a potential plot to restore him to power."
 hnn.22.a: "What plans does he have going on in his mind?"

 hnn.23.t: "Tang Shengzhi Speaks Out"
 hnn.23.d: "The recently returned General Tang Shengzhi has spoken out against the revoking of the Provincial Constitution, calling it un-democratic and a betrayal of the province and her people. Along with his brother, Tang Shengming, Tang Shengzhi has been incredibly vocal about Zhao Hengti and his actions. It is even suspected that the General has sent spies to sabotage the acts of the Governor."
 hnn.23.a: "He is nothing but trouble..."

 hnn.24.t: "Assassination Attempt on the Governor!"
 hnn.24.d: "As the assassin entered the room, clutching the pistol in his pocket, he knew that he had two options - to succeed, or to fail. His comrades would have told him that he could step back and turn away at any moment, that he still had a long life to live. But the decision had already been made. There was no turning back.\n\nZhao Hengti must die."
 hnn.24.a: "It's time."

 hnn.25.t: "Failed Assassination Attempt on Zhao Hengti!"
 hnn.25.d: "The assassin's dead body was burned this morning. No one knew who he was, and no one cared for him. He had died, four shots in his chest, the blood long dried up.\n\nGovernor Zhao went up to the podium to deliver a speech today. The assassin shockingly had an attempt on Zhao's life, but he valiantly fought the assassin, killing him. He has displayed the assassin's body as a threat to all those who dare to oppose him."
 hnn.25.a: "How could someone do this to our governor?"

 hnn.26.t: "The Military Flocks to Tang Shengzhi"
 hnn.26.d: "As a very popular figure in the military, the Buddhist General Tang Shengzhi has garnered much support amongst the divisions of Hunan, riling up many generals and corporals to take his side. It seems that a military resistance is building, one that may threaten Zhao Hengti's rule over Hunan."
 hnn.26.a: "Troubling..."

 hnn.27.t: "Pro-Constitutional Protests Escalate"
 hnn.27.d: "More protests have been springing up over the province lately, with the local people very much angry at the constitution being torn up and revoked. There was a large protest in front of the Hunan Provincial Council building yet again today, and another one in Hengyang a few days ago. Over time, these protests have become much bigger and louder, gathering many people each day. Some have reported even seeing pro-Tang Shengzhi banners being used in the protests."
 hnn.27.a: "Are they really that angry about some useless piece of paper?"

 hnn.28.t: "Riots Break Out"
 hnn.28.d: "A riot occurred today in Changsha. It started as a normal protest, but after a spat between a Constitutionalist and a Provincial Council member escalated too far, a full-on riot broke out, with people raising and lowering their hands repeatedly. The local army was sent in, managing to push back the rioters down the streets and putting a temporary end to the chaos."
 hnn.28.a: "Damn it, we need to keep this under control!"

 hnn.29.t: "Violence in the Streets"
 hnn.29.d: "Changde and Changsha were hit with another wave of protests this week, with one of them ending bloodily. A guard opened fire on the protestors in Changde, prompting the crowd to go wild and an almost full-blown battle to be fought between the rioters and the guards, resulting in casualties on both sides. Over the past week, protests have become increasingly violent, resulting in serious injuries and even deaths in some cases. With each passing day, it becomes harder to restore order to the province and stop the people from protesting."
 hnn.29.a: "The Yuanjiang River runs red today..."

 hnn.30.t: "The Military Revolts!"
 hnn.30.d: "This morning, under the banner of the Buddhist General, much of our military has declared a revolt! They have set their provisional capital in Changde, while forces loyal to Zhao Hengti are beginning to flock to the frontlines. Major battles are predicted to start shortly, as the province is plunged into chaos."
 hnn.30.a: "This isn't good..."

 hnn.31.t: "The Battle of Fenghuang"
 hnn.31.d: "The city of Fenghuang, next to the eastern border of Guizhou, is the site of an ongoing battle between the two sides. Zhao Hengti's militia has entered the city, guns blazing, while the soldiers loyal to Tang Shengzhi have held up a valiant defence."
 hnn.31.a: "Tang Shengzhi's defence succeeds!"
 hnn.31.b: "Zhao Hengti takes over the city!"

 hnn.32.t: "The Battle of Changsha"
 hnn.32.d: "After the victory of the rebels at Fenghuang, they have moved in to attempt and take Changsha, Zhao Hengti's base. The city has been in chaos for days as the rebels romp through the streets, getting closer and closer to the provincial governor's house. The air is tense, and the ground is stained in blood. If the rebels win, this might mean an end to Zhao Hengti's governorship."
 hnn.32.a: "The rebels win!"
 hnn.32.b: "The loyalists push the rebels out!"

 hnn.33.t: "The Battle of Changde"
 hnn.33.d: "After Zhao Hengti's pyrrhic victory at Fenghuang, he has gathered up his confidence and his troops yet again, this time to strike at the heart of the rebellion - Changde. A series of skirmishes and battles have already happened, and the sound of artillery fills the air. The rebels could quite possibly be defeated today."
 hnn.33.a: "Tang defends the city!"
 hnn.33.b: "Zhao rolls in!"

 hnn.34.t: "The Battle of Hengyang"
 hnn.34.d: "After a series of close battles and an unsuccessful attempt to take the capital of a side, the revolt is in its last stages. The two sides have finally met with their full forces in the city of Hengyang, the birthplace of Zhao Hengti. With their divisions amassed, this might as well be the final battlefield of the revolt. This battle will decide the fate of Hunan, and whoever wins will be the one who will lead Hunan."
 hnn.34.a: "A victory for Tang Shengzhi!"
 hnn.34.b: "Zhao Hengti destroys the rebels!"

#hnn.35 removed

 hnn.36.t: "The Battle of Yiyang"
 hnn.36.d: "An important junction between the two cities of Changsha and Changde, the bases of Zhao Hengti and Tang Shengzhi, respectively, Yiyang has been attacked by the rebels. Tang Shengzhi and a few divisions have laid siege to the city and are currently bombarding the loyalist defences. Zhao Hengti, hearing these news, has quickly commanded his generals to send a relief force. However, there are fears that the force will not arrive in time, and that Tang Shengzhi will take over the city, bringing him one step closer to Changsha."
 hnn.36.a: "Tang breaks the defences!"
 hnn.36.b: "The reinforcements arrive!"

 hnn.37.t: "The Battle of Shaoyang"
 hnn.37.d: "Shaoyang, a city in the middle of Hunan, has come under attack by the Buddhist General's forces. From Shaoyang, Tang could possibly expand his power to the city of Hengyang and capture southern Hunan, severing our connections with Liangguang and cornering us in the North. He may also gain control of important roads leading to important cities such as Changsha. It is imperative that Zhao Hengti keep the city if he wishes to survive."
 hnn.37.a: "Tang kicks the loyalists out!"
 hnn.37.b: "Zhao routes the rebels!"

 hnn.38.t: "An Attack at Huaihua"
 hnn.38.d: "Huaihua, a city in Western Hunan, is currently under the control of the Buddhist General Tang Shengzhi. A force has been sent by the Governor to potentially break the front and capture the city of Huaihua, which could be used as a point to stage an attack on Changde and the North and cut off the Buddhist General's forces in the South. The city is well-defended, and the battle is close. Who will win?"
 hnn.38.a: "The attack fails!"
 hnn.38.b: "The attack succeeds!"

 hnn.39.t: "Across Dongting Lake"
 hnn.39.d: "Dongting Lake is a large lake in the north of Hunan, after which Hunan is named; \"hú\" means lake, referring to Dongting Lake, and \"nán\" means south - thus, Hunan means \"south of (Dongting) Lake\". If we are able to cross it, it may provide us with a huge tactical advantage over the rebels and take us closer to Changde. Boats are to be built and sent out into the lake to contest its current dominance by Tang Shengzhi. The objective is to secure coastal villages and hold out."
 hnn.39.a: "We will capture this lake!"

 hnn.40.t: "Up the Yuanjiang River"
 hnn.40.d: "The Yuanjiang is a river that flows from Dongting Lake and through Changde. Now that we have sufficient dominance over the lake, we are to strike up the river. Our men have been loaded onto boats with the objective of raiding riverside settlements and with the eventual goal of creating chaos in Changde and returning to Changsha."
 hnn.40.a: "Good luck."

 hnn.41.t: "A Raid on Changde"
 hnn.41.d: "Success! Our men have gone up the river and raided Changde, taking with them valuable documents, intelligence, and money. Many good men were lost, but the ones who escaped have brought us an invaluable advantage."
 hnn.41.a: "A great success!"

 hnn.42.t: "A Failed Raid"
 hnn.42.d: "Ou men have been captured and gunned down by the Buddhist General's forces in Changde. It seems they were expecting an attack up the river, and they sprung a trap, encircling our soldiers and forcing them to surrender."
 hnn.42.a: "You were the chosen ones!"

 hnn.43.t: "A Suspected Plot"
 hnn.43.d: "Military officers were overheard during their conversations today, talking about a plot to potentially overthrow the Governor. When news arrived at the Governor's office, he merely nodded and said that he had been expecting such a thing to happen. The Provincial Government has been told not to worry, although fears are brewing that the Governor has underestimated the threat..."
 hnn.43.a: "It'll be fine... Right?"

 hnn.44.t: "Tang Shengzhi denounces Zhao Hengti"
 hnn.44.d: "The Buddhist General has once again spoken out, now with much fiercer anger against the Governor. He spoke from a balcony in Changde with thousands of people watching him as he listed the many things he accused the current provincial government of. He was seen flanked by his brother, Tang Shengming, among other members of the military. Many concerns have been raised that the general has connections with the plot against Zhao Hengti."
 hnn.44.a: "The absolute bastard..."

#Tang Victory Events

 hnn.45.t: "Tang Shengzhi wins the Election"
 hnn.45.d: "Tang Shengzhi, the Buddhist General, has won the provincial election, and become Hunan's governor, the de-facto head of state."
 hnn.45.a: "Victory!"

 HNN_zhao_flees: "§HZhao Hengti§! becomes a general"

 hnn.46.t: "Tang Shengzhi takes over Hunan"
 hnn.46.d: "Tang Shengzhi has, once again, established full control over the province of Hunan. Earlier today, Tang Shengzhi and his men entered the Governor's house and ousted him from his position, installing Tang as the new governor. Zhao Hengti was reported to have fled across the provincial border to Hubei, a province under Northern Zhili control. Tang Shengzhi has started his spreading of 'Buddhist Socialism', and Hunan will see a new age, better or worse, under Tang Shengzhi. For now, we must see what he does."
 hnn.46.a: "The Governor is gone, long live the new Governor!"

 hnn.47.t: "Tang Shengzhi's Revolutionary Buddhism"
 hnn.47.d: "The new governor, Tang Shengzhi, has put forth his new ideology into Hunanese society once again. Calling it 'Revolutionary Buddhism', Governor Tang seeks to combine the best parts of many ideologies. He takes his inspiration from the Kuomintang socialists and their message of equality, from the National Protection Alliance and their patriotism, from the ideologies of the Third Internationale, and from the Buddhism of himself and his comrades. Tang Shengzhi combines all these elements to create his perfect new ideology.\n\nEven though some devout Buddhists and right-wingers are opposed to it, many in Hunan accept it, as they believe that it is the right way forward for the modernisation of the province. In order for Hunan to step upon the stage of China again, she must first revolutionise."
 hnn.47.a: "For Buddhism! For Revolution!"

 hnn.48.t: "The Landlord Problem"
 hnn.48.d: "There is quite a contentious problem in Hunan - the problem of what to do with our landlords. As Tang Shengzhi is a socialist, he must know how to deal with them effectively. There are three ways to deal with them - to kill them, to give them hard labour ten times the work of an ordinary farmer, or to set them free and tell them to not come back again. Which should the general choose?"
 hnn.48.a: "Kill them!"
 hnn.48.b: "Make them work!"
 hnn.48.c: "Set them free!"

 hnn.49.t: "The Question of Women"
 hnn.49.d: "Women constitute a large part of our population. Most adult women in Hunan are simple farmers or housewives, and do not have any say. However, influential women have begun to push their agenda, to have them working more in factories in big cities and to help women raise their statuses. Their demands are to have women be equal to men in work and pay, and for discrimination against females to be wiped out. However, there has been much opposition from the provincial council and the local men, as they do not wish to give up a large part of their power to women. They want to keep their positions and their male social and economic superiority as best they can. If we promise equality, it will be good for women, but it is a surefire way to anger the men of Hunan. How do we respond?"
 hnn.49.a: "Social and economic equality now!"
 hnn.49.b: "Promise to elevate the status of women."
 hnn.49.c: "Back to the kitchen, fools."

 hnn.50.t: "Founding of Yaoxiang Academy"
 hnn.50.d: "Today, near his home county of Dong'an, Tang Shengzhi announced that he would be opening a new secondary school, named the Yaoxiang Academy after his father. The academy, initially intended to be a university, will not have a board of directors, and Tang Shengzhi will be the chairman of the school, with Gu Chou as the principal. The Yaoxiang Academy, being a private school, is aimed at educating relatively wealthy teenagers. The academy has no specific focus, and it will open in the next year."
 hnn.50.a: "A noteworthy effort to improve education!"

 hnn.51.t: "Protests from Monasteries"
 hnn.51.d: "Some Buddhist monasteries in Hunan have expressed outrage at Tang Shengzhi's new Buddhisisation programme, claiming that it took away their way of life and adapted their religion to a harmful political agenda. Tang Shengzhi responded to these monks by saying 'Buddhism is nothing without socialism or politics. If you're concerned about politics being involved in religion, you should look at the Western provinces.'"
 hnn.51.a: "They probably didn't like that response..."

 hnn.52.t: "Military Rent Collectors"
 hnn.52.d: "It has come to the attention of the Provincial Government of Hunan that local landlords have been hiring members of the military to collect rent and evict their tenants for a cut of the rent money. This goes without saying as a severe transgression against the ideals of Buddhist Socialism, and with unanimous agreement from the Provincial Council, the military is to be told to stand down and stop its interference with landowners."
 hnn.52.a: "These pesky landlords are up to no good!"

 hnn.53.t: "Military Rent Collectors stand down"
 hnn.53.d: "With the order coming through from Changsha that all members of the military who engaged in the collecting of rent and eviction of tenants to cease their actions, most of the military personnel who engaged in rent collection stopped. They were either demoted or punished, and those who refused the order were stripped of their rank and arrested."
 hnn.53.a: "People will do anything for a little money..."

 hnn.54.t: "Reports on Arms Smuggling"
 hnn.54.d: "The North-South railway going through Hunan is being used extensively for the transport of cargo, and among it, weapons. These weapons are transported illegally to and from Guangxi, Guangdong, the Foreign Concessions, and the government in Beijing. There is now hot debate in the Provincial Council as to what to do with these illegal arms smugglers. Many members have stated that they do not care about the situation, and some urge governor Tang Shengzhi to take action immediately and crack down on the smugglers. The choice is ultimately his - what do we do with the illegal arms trade?"
 hnn.54.a: "Starting with the next cargo train that passes through, we must crack down on this at once!"
 hnn.54.b: "Leave them be, as long as they pay the transport fee they'll be fine."

 hnn.55.t: "The Xiangjiang Incident"
 hnn.55.d: "Local reports of suspicious boats on the Xiangjiang were never a matter of importance to the police. However, after a large gunfight in Changde, leaving around a dozen dead and many more wounded involving these boats, the local police force has started to investigate more into these strange barges. Many say that the boats are just regular ones, and that the participants of the gunfight should be apprehended, but some claim that the gunfight and the marked boats are examples of something bigger."
 hnn.55.a: "I'm sure it's nothing - arrest the troublesome ones and we'll be done with this."
 hnn.55.b: "This calls for an investigation!"

 hnn.56.t: "Massive Opium Smuggling Ring discovered"
 hnn.56.d: "The investigation of the strange, marked boats and the gunfight on the Xiangjiang River have led to the discovery of a massive illegal opium smuggling ring which has operated under the nose of the Provincial Government for years. Even though the Provincial Government does not care much about the use of opium, the fact that this smuggling ring has continuously avoided taxation has made the Provincial Government agree that this smuggling ring should be stopped. Operating within Hunan, Sichuan, and Yunnan, this ring is notorious for running from the law and defying local authority."
 hnn.56.a: "This must be put to an end at once!"

 hnn.57.t: "Yiguandao Rally"
 hnn.57.d: "A recent rural Yiguandao rally has turned the public eye to this strange religion. With an old 'Master' holding the rally, members of the Yiguandao tried to spread the word of the Yiguandao across the countryside of Hunan. The cult has been rejected by many farmers and peasants as crazy, but many other also started becoming devout followers. There is now hot debate about the Yiguandao and its possible effects on the province, with many citing the Yiguandao in Shandong, where they are perhaps one of the most powerful forces in the province."
 hnn.57.a: "This cult is a strange one."

 hnn.58.t: "Opium Smuggling Ring discovered in Southern China"
 hnn.58.d: "An illegal opium smuggling ring has just been discovered by the provincial government of Hunan. They have operated under the noses of the governors of Hunan, Sichuan, Yunnan, and eastern provinces along the Yangtze for many years, consistently evading taxation. Governor Tang Shengzhi of Hunan has dedicated himself in the past week to destroy this smuggling ring, or at least to make it pay taxes. Whatever the case, ceasing the evasion of taxes by this group will help us financially."
 hnn.58.a: "Good work, Tang!"

#Zhao Authoritarian Events

 hnn.59.t: "Zhao Hengti Wins the Election Through Fraud"
 hnn.59.d: "The election was so deeply fraudulent that the results were all but discarded. Zhao Hengti has been re-elected on flimsy grounds. While Tang Shengzhi and Cheng Qian may protest, the duration of the election gave Zhao Hengti sufficient time to cement his rule. Tang Shengzhi, worryingly, has fled from the province with some of his closest advisors in tow."
 hnn.59.a: "Victory!"

 hnn.590.t: "Zhao Hengti Puts Down the Rebellion"
 hnn.590.d: "Zhao Hengti and his men have walked into Changde, ousting Tang Shengzhi and the generals loyal to him, most of whom, if not all have fled on a train to neighbouring Sichuan, where they will lie low amidst the chaos. The rebellion is over, and Tang Shengzhi has fled from the province. The Governor has called a great feast to be held tonight, with his loyalist generals, to celebrate the end of the hard-fought but short rebellion. A new age will begin for Hunan under Governor Zhao Hengti."
 hnn.590.a: "He's gone for good this time."

 hnn.60.t: "The Hunt For Tang Shengzhi"
 hnn.60.d: "The initial search for Tang Shengzhi has failed to turn up any leads. The team responsible for the search has begun to look further afield. It might be a while but surely we will find the traitor and bring him to trial."
 hnn.60.a: "Let's hope he hasn't fled too far."

 hnn.61.t: "Tang Shengzhi Found in Hong Kong"
 hnn.61.d: "After two months of searching, Tang Shengzhi has been identified in Hong Kong. A team has been assembled to drag him back to Hunan in chains."
 hnn.61.a: "Bring him back, and we will put him on trial."

 hnn.62.t: "The Trial of Tang Shengzhi"
 hnn.62.d: "While two of our men were shot in Hong Kong in the process, Tang Shengzhi has been brought back to Hunan in chains. A show trial has been prepared and he stands accused of treason. While our rule is secure, Tang Shengzhi remains popular and executing him might leave a number of people quite upset."
 hnn.62.a: "Death to the traitor!"
 hnn.62.b: "Exile him!"

#Zhao Democratic Events

 hnn.63.t: "Zhao Hengti Wins the Election"
 hnn.63.d_1: "While the voting was extremely close, in the end, Zhao Hengti won by a narrow margin. While some whisper that it was fraud which pushed him over the edge, throughout the election, Zhao was uncharacteristically restrained, and given time to cement his regime, none can openly challenge Zhao in the field."
 hnn.63.d_2: "While many expected Zhao Hengti to fraudulently affect the results of the Hunanese general election, by all accounts the election was mostly free and fair. Zhao has been re-elected governor nonetheless."
 hnn.63.a: "Victory!"

#KMT Events

 hnn.64.t: "Cheng Qian Wins the Election"
 hnn.64.d: "Cheng Qian and the KMT have won the election. Not willing to wait to assume the governorship, Cheng Qian all but chased Zhao Hengti from his residence. While many expect Cheng to bring Hunan under arms in support of the KMT in Longyang, he possesses a notorious independent streak."
 hnn.64.a: "Victory!"

 hnn.65.t: "A Path for Hunan"
 hnn.65.d1: "With our victory secure, we must choose whether to align with the left or the less prominent right."
 hnn.65.d2: "The attempted Nationalist revolt in Longyang unfortunately failed before our rise to power in Hunan. With our victory secure, we must choose whether to align with the left or the less prominent right."
 hnn.65.a: "Conform to the party line."
 hnn.65.b: "Our own path - align with the right of the party."

 hnn.650.t: "Hunan Aligns with the Right"
 hnn.650.d: "While Cheng Qian only recently was a leading member of our party, following his victory in Hunan, he has officially proclaimed his desire to align with the discredited right. While perhaps some sort of arrangement may still yet be made between us, many see this as a betrayal."
 hnn.650.a: "A betrayal."

 hnn.69.t.assassinated: "Chen Jiongming Assassinated!"
 hnn.69.t.coup: "Coup in Guangdong"
 hnn.69.d.assassinated: "In a most heinous act, the warlord of Guangxi, Ma Ji, successfully ordered the assassination of our ally Chen Jiongming, the leader of China's Federalists and Liangguang. Chen had been tricked to attend the funeral of Ma Ji's predecessor and adopted father in Nanning, Guangxi, where he was gunned down in an ambush.\n\nWith the government of Liangguang and Guangdong in shambles along with the Federalist movement, our alliance with them has become null and void as they descend into civil war between bickering provincial leaders."
 hnn.69.d.coup: "Seeing an opportunity to seize power for himself, the KMT-aligned politician and general Chen Mingshu led a coup against our ally Chen Jiongming in Guangzhou. Chen Jiongming's fate is currently unknown, but the rumour mill in the city appears convinced that he is still alive and has fled either north or to Hong Kong.\n\nWhile this appears to be preventing a war between Liangguang's two provinces as Guangxi was recently seized by Li Zongren, another KMT-aligned warlord, our alliance with Liangguang has been rendered null and void with our ally's illegal removal from power."
 hnn.69.a: "Grave news."

 hnn.70.t: "Hunan Breaks Off Alliance"
 hnn.70.d.assassinated: "The carefully-plotted assassination of Chen Jiongming has had some further consequences, as his allies in Hunan have repudiated the alliance between Hunan and Liangguang. While we cannot expect support from them any longer, this also means we should not expect meddling from them as we secure Guangdong under our leadership."
 hnn.70.d.coup: "While war in Liangguang has been averted by the deposition of former governor Chen Jiongming, our neighbours in Hunan have made it clear that the alliance between it and Liangguang is no longer valid while denouncing our \"illegal seizure of power\"."
 hnn.70.a: "Whatever."

 HNN_join_faction_request_desc_LKMT_tang: "Hunan, led by the old Buddhist commander [FROM.GetLeader], has requested to join our faction. Though some are hesitant given Tang's frequent clashes with the nationalist general Cheng Qian, members of our government are largely sympathetic to [FROM.GetLeader]."
 HNN_join_faction_request_desc_LKMT_chen: "[FROM.GetLeader], the Hunanese general who once betrayed us, has surprisingly sent a message begging forgiveness for his past transgressions and protection for Hunan, still under his control. While many are hesitant to accept the traitor back into the fold, it could be beneficial to strike up an alliance with Hunan."
 HNN_join_faction_request_desc_LKMT_default: "Hunan, long our ally, has requested to formalise our relationship. They will now be all but a part of our revolutionary regime."
 HNN_join_faction_request_desc_RKMT: "Hunan, led by [FROM.GetLeader], has requested to join our faction. Given [FROM.GetLeader.GetHerHis] public split from the left of the Party, he would seem a natural ally."
 HNN_join_faction_request_desc_federalist_authoritarian: "Hunan, drawing on old connections to the Federalist movement, has requested to join our alliance. [FROM.GetLeader], however, is not the same man he once was. Once dedicated to constitutionalism, his rule in Hunan has become increasingly authoritarian. As such, many in our government hold strong reservations about allying ourselves with [FROM.GetLeader.GetHerHis] Hunan."
 HNN_join_faction_request_desc_federalist: "Hunan, drawing on old connections to the Federalist movement, has requested to join our alliance."
 HNN_join_faction_request_desc_zhili: "[FROM.GetLeader] was once a close ally of Chen Jiongming. However, domestic politics in Hunan and his mutual friendships with Wu Peifu have pushed him firmly into our camp recently. As such, seeking protection, Hunan desires to formally link their fate with ours, however, they desire a guarantee. [FROM.GetLeader.GetHerHisCap] request is simple: we shall never remove [FROM.GetLeader] himself as provincial governor, come what may."
 HNN_join_faction_request_desc_other: "Hunan has expressed interest in joining the [FROM.GetNameDef], but has reservations. As a small province, Hunan fear that should other Chinese factions be overcome, we may turn against them for our own gain.

#Economic

 hnn.97.t: "Ripples of Black Monday"
 hnn.97.d: "Even though Black Monday did little to affect the inland provinces, Hunan was still hit by it. There was a significant economic downturn overnight, but it was not sufficiently damaging enough to destroy the economy. Hunan has been in a rather stable position for years now, with a relatively weak economy amongst the other Chinese provinces. Our main exports are rhubarb, musk, honey, tobacco, hemp, and birds, and we are an important producer of tea and ramie, both of which, under the League of Eight Provinces, were sold to the concessions. The provincial government must now use its abilities to improve our economy, do business with other powers in China, and set our province on the right path."
 hnn.97.a: "We must aim for a better economy."

 hnn.98.t: "Economic Woes Gone"
 hnn.98.d: "Our economy no longer suffers from the slight setback of Black Monday. It has managed to repair itself, and we have shrugged off all the negative effects we have gotten."
 hnn.98.a: "May our economy become even stronger!"

 hnn.102.t: "Constitution Day"
 hnn.102.d: "Today is the anniversary of the restoration of the Hunan constitution. During the time the Constitution has been reimplemented, it has seemingly successfully protected the citizens of Hunan from too much corruption and misconduct, and Hunan's democratic experiment has worked well."
 hnn.102.a: "Here's to another successful year!"

 hnn.104.t: "'Entry No. 192 - Another Day in Changsha'"
 hnn.104.d: "'They say the Buddhist General has returned. I do not care about this, or Zhao Hengti, or anything. This is all just nonsense - I just want to protect my family without the fear of those protestors barging into my house. Hell, prices are rising fast from the collapse, and no one wants me to sharpen their blades anymore. I hate this - I am going to go north and move to Wuchang with what money I have left.'"
 hnn.104.a: "'Life is hard these days.'"

 hnn.105.t: "He Jian bans Alice in Wonderland"
 hnn.105.d: "General He Jian, the censor of Hunan under Zhao Hengti, has issued a unilateral ban over the book 'Alice's Adventures in Wonderland', by author Lewis Carroll. He claims that the book's portrayal of anthropomorphised animals acting with no difference other than physically than human beings was an insult to the humanity. He further explains that children, when seeing humans and animals on the same level as each other, will start to regard them as so, something he described as having 'disastrous' consequences.\n\nSoldiers were commanded to throw away and burn any copy of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland they saw. Across the province, his action has been seen very poorly by local parents and children."
 hnn.105.a: "He has a point."
 hnn.105.b: "It's just a children's book, reverse the ban."

 hnn.107.a: "Damn!"

 hnn.108.t: "Cheng Qian wins Hunanese Election"
 hnn.108.d: "Our man in Hunan, Cheng Qian, has been elected governor of the province. As leader of Hunan, he has immense power to bring the province in line with our movement."
 hnn.108.a: "An ally in Hunan."

 hnn.109.t: "He Jian Flees"
 hnn.109.d: "He Jian, the most prominent Hunanese commander and an ally of Zhao Hengti, has reportedly fled, likely for the protection of his allies in Beijing."

 hnn.111.d_gxc: "Tang Shengzhi, the 'Buddhist General' of Hunan, has deposed governor Zhao Hengti and formally claimed rulership over Hunan. Tang is a stringent republican, and while his loyalties are at the moment are unclear, he may prove to be an ally in the future. At the very least, our enemies in Beijing have been denied an ally."
 hnn.111.d_szc: "Tang Shengzhi, the 'Buddhist General' of Hunan, has deposed governor Zhao Hengti and formally claimed rulership over Hunan. Tang is a stringent republican and his loyalties are at the moment are unclear. He may prove to be an ally or an enemy in the future. What is clear is that Beijing's southern flank is now held by an enemy of their regime."
 hnn.111.a: "We shall monitor him closely."

 hnn.112.t: "Kuomintang Seize Power in Hunan!"
 hnn.112.d_gxc: "[HNN.GetLeader], a Kuomintang rebel leader in Hunan, has seized control over the province, and formally declared his allegiance to the ideals of Dr. Sun. This is a concerning development, as our northern flank now lies exposed to an enemy of our regime."
 hnn.112.d_szc: "[HNN.GetLeader], a Kuomintang rebel leader in Hunan, has seized control over the province, and formally declared his allegiance to the ideals of Dr. Sun. He will certainly align himself the KMT, which may prove to be a problem for us."
 hnn.112.a: "More KMT soldiers. Lap dogs for the party-state."
 hnn.112.b: "The party-state grows stronger."

 hnn.113.t: "Zhao Hengti Clings On in Hunan"
 hnn.113.d: "Zhao Hengti, the Governor of Hunan, has held onto power after an election many in the province and around China are decrying as rigged and unfair. Despite his claims of loyalty to the ideas of Federalism, it is obvious that he does not hold a strong commitment to democracy."
 hnn.113.a: "Hopefully Governor Zhao remembers his loyalties..."
 hnn.113.b: "Hard times for Hunan."

 hnn.114.t: "Zhao Hengti Wins Hunan Elections"
 hnn.114.d_gxc: "Governor Zhao Hengti has just won the recent provincial elections in Hunan.

 hnn.114.d_szc: "Governor Zhao Hengti has just won the recent provincial elections in Hunan. This has strengthened the Federalists as Zhao's electoral victory also means that he has reaffirmed his commitment to his federal values, placing what he thinks are the best interests of the nation over his previous loyalties to Wu Peifu."
 hnn.114.a: "It is rare to see a man follow his principles."

 hnn.115.t: "Ye Kaixin flees"
 hnn.115.d: "One of Zhao’s most loyal commanders, Ye Kaixin, has fled from Hunan, most likely due to the man’s bitter rivalry with Tang Shengzhi. The two met on opposite sides twice during the Northern Expedition. Believing Tang would have wished to settle the score for Ye’s capture of Changsha back from him, the General fled from Changsha and Hunan."
 hnn.115.a: "We have no need for deserters anyway!"

 hnn.116.t: "Ye Kaixin arrives in Beijing"
 hnn.116.d: "Ye Kaixin has fled Hunan after Zhao Hengti's loss of power there. Fearing retribution from Tang Shengzhi for actions during the Northern Expedition, he has renewed his strenuous Zhili ties and arrived in Beijing to seek our protection. "
