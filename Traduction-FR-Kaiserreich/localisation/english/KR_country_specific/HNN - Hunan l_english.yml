#####- Section 02: Party Names - #######
########################################

 HNN_totalist_party: "CSP-Radical"
 HNN_totalist_party_long: "Chinese Syndicalist Party - Radical Faction (Zhongguo Gongtuandang-jijon Pai)\n§gSimilar to their sisters in the mainstream, the Hunan branch of the Chinese Syndicalist Party contains within it a youthful, vigorous, and most importantly, politically radical, subset within it. Nominally coalescing around the intrepid and relentless Ren Bishi, who frequents between Hunan and Shanghai, the radical faction pushes for a more active and hardline approach to the role of the CSP in Chinese politics.\n\nWith a unique focus on the youth movement due to Ren Bishi's influence, their materialistic socialist radicalism hopes to bring forth a brighter future for China, free of the tyrannical grasp of capitalism. Zealous in nature, they have operated a form of militant resistance towards both Zhao and the Zhili, even fighting with Cai Hesen's Orthodox faction on occasion.§!\n"
 HNN_syndicalist_party: "CSP-Orthodox"
 HNN_syndicalist_party_long: "Chinese Syndicalist Party - Orthodox Faction (Zhongguo Gongtuandang-zhengtong Pai)\n§gA dominant force within Hunan's underground labour movement, the Orthodox Faction of the Chinese Syndicalist Party carries a hefty weight within Changsha and Changde. Owing its roots to the original CSP leaders from the League of Chinese Syndicalists, the Hunan Branch of the Chinese Syndicalist Party operates largely under the guidance of one Cai Hesen. Maintaining a series of underground contacts with the main branch of the party, and labour movements across all regions of China, they consider themselves the last bastion for the workers of Hunan\n\nHaving only truly kicked into action following Cai Hesen's return to the nation in 1932, the CSP functions largely as an obstacle to Zhao's anti-union and anti-labour stance. Aloof in the inter-factional CSP struggle between Li Lisan and Cai Hesen, and even that of the Kuomintang-CSP United Front, the Hunan branch is focused solely on provincial matters.§!\n"
 HNN_radical_socialist_party: "KMT-8th Army (Radicals)"
 HNN_radical_socialist_party_long: "Kuomintang-8th Army (Radicals) (Guomin Geming Jun Di Ba Jun (Jijin Pai))\n§gIf one person is symbolic of all of the Radicals within the 8th Army, it is that of its Commanding Officer, and unofficial leader, He Long. With a lot of its veterans having belonged to He's original divisions in the Hunan Army, Sichuan Army and alike, following the Commander with dogged loyalty. Having lead his troops to join the National Revolutionary Army in July 1926, serving as Commander of the 6th Division within the 8th Army, and garrison envoy of Western Hunan.\n\nSeeing fighting all throughout the expedition, He's division would distinguish itself as a premier fighting force, aiding in the swift fall of Hanyang. Yet He could not divert his attention everywhere at once, and the Northern Expedition soon collapsed under the German boot. Having followed his superior Tang Shengzhi all throughout the fallout, He would find himself situated within the MinGan Insurgency zone, wherein he would become acquainted with Peng Dehuai. The two men, sharing similar backgrounds, and strong socialist leanings, would begin to form a power-block within the 8th Army, coalescing into the \"Radicals\".\n\nFirmly within the Provisional Action Committee's camp, with He and Peng both being members, the two consistently push the factional line of agrarian socialism, hoping to convert their superior officer Tang Shengzhi closer and closer to their ideals.§!\n"
 HNN_social_democrat_party: "KMT-8th Army"
 HNN_social_democrat_party_long: "Kuomintang-8th Army (Guomin Geming Jun Di Ba Jun)\n§gWith its root in the Fourth Division of the Hunan Army, commanded by Tang Shengzhi, and the Ye Qi Brigade of the New Guangxi Clique, the 8th Army of the National Revolutionary Army is a hybrid force of peculiarity. Counting amongst its ranks the likes of He Jian, Li Pinxian, Liu Xing, Ye Qi, and finally He Long. Engaging the Northern Expedition with tenacity in July 1926, it made bounding efforts, and won many resounding victories such as the capture of Hanyang.\n\nYet all was for naught, as the Zhili clique called in the assistance of their German benefactors, who arrived to squash the forces defending Guangdong under their jackboot. Continuing their resistance on all fronts, the 8th fought valiantly, in the Battle of Jinhua, assisting the 4th Army. Their efforts resulting in a major defeat, the 8th Army could only look on in terror as the 4th Army disintegrated before them, scattering to Guangdong and MinGan. Desperately retreating, the 8th found themselves trapped within Eastern Hunan. Perhaps as petty revenge, Tang Shengzhi had to once again fight against Ye Kaixin's forces, ultimately losing a large component of the 8th Army, and retreating to MinGan to join the proto-insurgency there.\n\nFighting a revolutionary struggle within MinGan, the 8th Army merely radicalised in the absence of any overseeing authority, developing their own factions within the Army. A core of Tang Shengzhi loyalists, featuring the likes of Liu Xing and Li Pinxian, firmly loyal to his eclectic agrarian style socialism. In contrast to the 8th Army Radicals, under the auspices of Commanders He Long and Peng Dehuai, focused on a more radical line of socialism, towing close to the ideology of the Provisional Action Committee.§!\n"
 HNN_social_liberal_party: "Republicans"
 HNN_social_liberal_party_long: "Independent Republicans (Duli Gonghedang)\n§gCoalescing around the native Hunan intellectual Zhou Shizhao, the broad group of assemblymen known as the \"Independent Republicans\" are figures that cast their lot neither with Zhao's People's Renewal Society, the China National Democratic Construction Association, or even that of the Constitutional Democratic Party. Similar to the independent republican factions within the Beijing or Fengtian legislatures, the endeavouring politicians form their own political block within the Hunan political scene, and are lobbied for by the People's Renewal Society and CNDCA intensely.\n\nUnlike their similar fellows in the Beijing and Fengtian legislatures however, the independent republicans of Hunan can express genuine political power and opinions through Hunan's Assembly, a shining star of Chinese democracy. Whilst not capable of besting Zhao's People's Renewal Society in voting power just yet, perhaps in the future, Hunan's shining provincial democracy will allow parties of all shapes and colours to form from within the \"Independent Republicans\" clique. Until that day however, they remain a broad political faction, limited to their independent campaigns.§!\n"
 HNN_market_liberal_party: "CNDCA"
 HNN_market_liberal_party_long: "China National Democratic Construction Association (Zhongguo Minzhu Jianguo Hui)\n§gA unique case for Hunan's political parties, the CNDCA under Huang Yanpei can't trace their roots in Hunan, but rather in Jiangsu. Originally formed as the \"China Vocational Education Society\", by Huang in Shanghai after spending time observing different education systems around the world. Organised from Shanghai, it originally focused on expanding education from within the city, emphasising the necessity to teach practical skills helpful for acquiring jobs. Participating in the May 30th movement in 1925, the movement was a major democratic force in Shanghai.\n\nLargely unaffected by the Northern Expedition, despite the KMT capture and Zhili recapture of Shanghai. Huang continued his work until 1932 when the Shanghai Uprising saw a large-scale revolution in the city, primarily backed by the CSP and KMT. Reprisals for the uprising were swift and broad, with Marshal Sun using it as a casus belli against intellectuals and democrats in his core five provinces. With this repression Huang and the China Vocational Education Society fled from Shanghai, and Zhao greeted them with open arms. They have since reformed under the \"China National Democratic Construction Association\" name, becoming a proper political party in Hunan. While having similar democratic goals as Zhao, the CNDCA serve as a liberal opposition to him, and are notably more pro-worker and pro-union. However if push came to shove, they would be happy to work with the PRS in defence of Hunan's democracy.§!\n"
 HNN_social_conservative_party: "People's Renewal Society"
 HNN_social_conservative_party_long: "People's Renewal Society (Minxinshe)\n§gEasily the largest political block in Hunan, the People's Renewal Society can trace its roots back to 1922 and Hunan's first provincial election. Forming around Zhao Hengti in the 1922 election, the PRS serves as his political party, supporting him throughout his first term, Tang Shengzhi's revolt, and his reinstatement by Wu. Fully confident that Zhao would restore the Constitution as soon as he was able, the PRS has stood by his side through thick and thin, backing his efforts for education expansion, reducing the military budget in favour of public works, and generally establishing a more democratic system.\n\nIt's right-wing is, notably, mainly supported by Hunan's Gentry and elites, pushing it into a notably more Conservative direction. This direction has caused issues when it comes to labour activists and union workers. Its other major support base is that of Hunan's intelligentsia, which looks upon Zhao in a favourable light due to his efforts in establishing Hunan's democratic system, and broadly form the left wing of the PRS. The People's Renewal Society stands firm as the foremost political bloc in Hunan, and as loyal subordinates to Zhao Hengti, who enjoys support from both wings of the party.§!\n"
 HNN_authoritarian_democrat_party: "KMT-6th Army"
 HNN_authoritarian_democrat_party_long: "Kuomintang-6th Army (Guomin Geming Jun Di Liu Jun)\n§gTracing its origins back towards the days of January 1926, the National Revolutionary Army's 6th Army was formed from the original founding Hunan Army, with both maintaining their original Commander, Cheng Qian. Entering the Northern Expedition on July 6th 1926, the Sixth Army would see limited combat, mostly aimed at cleaning up after the lightning speed advances of the 8th, 4th and 7th armies. However, when the Northern Front collapsed, the 6th Army found itself trapped within the Western portion of Hunan alongside the 2nd Army in the Centre, and the 8th Army in the East. With a flood of the remnants of the 1st, 3rd and 7th Armies retreating into Guizhou, the 6th, largely unharmed, accompanied them into exile.\n\nBiding their time in Guizhou, even being used as a bargaining chip by Tang Jiyao, the 6th Army considers itself \"apolitical\" in the sphere of the Kuomintang exiles. Maintaining connections with Sun Fo and his Reconstruction Faction, alongside those of the Provisional Action Committee, the 6th manages to act as a connection between the leftist Central Committee, and those of the rightist factions, such as He Yingqin and Zhu Peide.\n\nWhilst all true on the surface, the 6th finds itself as a vessel of the old revolutionaries of the Tongmenghui days. Those aligned with the Kuomintang, true, but those who resisted the Reorganisation in private all the same. Finding friends amongst the Western Hills Clique, and other centrist Kuomintang factions, the 6th Army desires a swift Tutelage, and will fight to maintain that it holds true.§!\n"
 HNN_paternal_autocrat_party: "Yueyang Garrison"
 HNN_paternal_autocrat_party_long: "Yueyang Garrison (Yueyang Zhujun)\n§gOriginally falling under Wu Peifu through negotiations between him and Zhao, the Yueyang garrison has existed for almost as long as Zhao has been Governor of Hunan. Situated on an important border city between Hunan and Hubei, Yueyang serves as a direct link between Hunan and the Zhili clique. This fact become more clear after Tang Shengzhi's revolt, and the subsequent Northern Expedition. With Wu feeling it necessary to reinforce the garrison, and concerned about Zhao's entrance into the Sun's League, he appointed Admiral turned General Tang Xiangming to it in 1927. Over the last decade Tang has served as garrison commander faithfully, instilling a strict regimen and absolute loyalty, Admiral Tang has earned the respect and loyalty of Yueyang's garrison, and can rely on them come hell or high water.§!\n"
 HNN_national_populist_party: "Old Guizhou Clique"
 HNN_national_populist_party_long: "Old Guizhou Clique (Jiu Qian Xi)\n§gThe Old Guizhou Clique can trace it's roots back to, of all men, Tang Jiyao, who took over the province of Guizhou in 1912. His Governorship didn't last long however, as when Cai E lost power he went back to Yunnan to take his place, and installed Liu Xianshi as Military Governor. Despite losing power he managed to hold control over his clique until 1920, when his nephew Wang Wenhua staged a coup called the Minjiu incident, leading to the deaths of several prominent figures under Liu. Wang's brutality, however, meant he never took full power in Guizhou, and was assassinated by Yuan Zuming in 1921.\n\nThis secured Yuan's position as leader of the Old Guizhou Clique. Despite being forced out of power twice since then, once by Tang Jiyao and Liu Xianshi, and a second time by Liu Xiang and Yang Sen, Yuan has remained firmly in charge of his clique, and after his betrayal of the Kuomintang at the end of the Northern Expedition, on advice of his subordinate Zhao Yusong, Yuan's has been appointed Governor by Beijing, but only controls a sliver of Guizhou, the rest being occupied by Tang Jiyao. Since 1927 the Old Guizhou Clique has radicalised in an anti-KMT and anti-Communist direction, with Zhao Yusong becoming YCP leader in Guizhou, the party has functionally formed a civilian wing to the Old Guizhou Clique, supporting Yuan as an \"apolitical strongman\".§!\n"

### Rename ###
 HNN_zhili_clique: "Zhili Clique"
 HNN_zhili_clique_long: "Zhili Clique (Zhili Xi Junfa)\n§gForming out of Governor Tang's garrison in Yueyang, Hunan's branch of the Zhili Clique is loyal to their Commander-in-Chief. Composed of Northerners, primarily from Tang Xiangming's home province, Hubei, they prefer to keep their distance from the League and Southern Zhili, preferring the Northern Zhili in Beijing and Chongqing. While the inner Zhili, especially Wu Peifu, can often seem... apathetic to the Governor, those immediately under him recognise his skill in battle and as Governor. The Zhili clique in Hunan, ever faithful to the Admiral, serves to form his military arm, ready to crush any who dare oppose the Commander-in-Chief under their iron heels.§!\n"
 HNN_CERA: "Chinese Constitutionalist Party"
 HNN_CERA_long: "Chinese Constitutionalist Party (Xianfa Yanjiu Hui)\n§gThe Chinese Constitutionalist Party, led by Tang Hualong, can trace it's roots back to the Progressive Party and Liang Qichao's circle, of which Tang was a part of. Originally serving under Yuan Shikai, Tang's faction tried their hardest to make the best out of a bad situation, attempting to moderate and lighten his regime. However after Yuan declared himself Emperor, Tang grew disillusioned with the man, later advising he abdicate and retire from politics. With Yuan Shikai's death, and the ascendency of Duan Qirui, Tang Hualong's political might diminished rapidly, and he decided to travel the world for the next few years.\n\nTang Hualong returned to China in 1927 when his ally Liang Qichao became chairman of the CERA. Working in Beijing briefly until his brother, Tang Xiangming, invited him to Yueyang with silent promises of the mayorship. After brief discussion on the matter with Liang, He agreed and moved to the border city. After firmly winning the election to become Mayor of Yueyang, he used his old contacts to build a political block in and around the city, greatly expanding the Hunanese branch of the Chinese Constitutionalist Party, which he now leads. With his brother becoming Governor of Hunan, he and his \"Yueyang group\", as their informally known, are trying to act as a moderating influence on Tang Xiangming's regime, supporting him while influencing him towards a more moderate direction. At least that's their hope in supporting the new Governor.§!\n"
 HNN_harmony_association: "Harmony Association"
 HNN_harmony_association_long: "Harmony Association (Hexie Shetuan)\n§gTaking it's name from the same group in Beijing, Hunan's \"Harmony Association\" is a loose political circle centred around Governor Tang Xiangming. Made up primarily of members of the gentry, the Harmony Association has a notably conservative bent to it, although it is certainly influenced by Tang Hualong and his Chinese Constitutionalists Party, informally referred to as the \"Yueyang group\" due to the border city being their power centre. Utterly loyal to their Governor, the Harmony Association serves as his civilian arm, able to offer both the open hand, and the clenched fist, to any opponent of Governor Tang in the political arena.§!\n"
 HNN_kuomintang_second_army: "KMT-2nd Army"
 HNN_kuomintang_second_army_long: "Kuomintang-2nd Army (Guomin Geming Jun Di Er Jun)\n§gOriginating from Tan Yankai's warlord forces, the original \"2nd Army\" can date its inception back to the autumn of 1923, wherein Dr. Sun Yat-sen supported Tan Yankai as commander-in-chief of the Jianguo Hunan Army. A force of moderate thought amongst the revolutionary zeitgeist that was the Kuomintang, the original members of the 2nd Army heeded Dr. Sun's call to arms to defect to his Guangzhou Government, ostensibly united in purpose to fight against incursion by Beiyang armies.\n\nWith the reorganisation of the National Revolutionary Army, Tan Yankai initially maintained his independent provincial force, however after the rebellions of the Jianguo Yunnan Army and Jianguo Gui Army, Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek reorganised the army into the 2nd Army of the NRA in 1925. Under the leadership of Commander Tan Yankai and Deputy Army Commander Lu Diping. Under its jurisdiction were the 4th, 5th and 6th divisions, under the command of Zhang Huizan, Tan Daoyuan and Dai Yue respectively. Fighting valiantly in the Northern Expedition, the Army was ultimately encircled in Hunan, with Zhao extending a hand of mercy towards his old superior Tan Yankai, and offering amnesty if they surrendered.\n\nWith the Kuomintang's assumption of power within Hunan, Tan Yankai has deemed it fit to reactivate his 2nd Army. Whilst lacking any real military force, the 2nd Army represents a channel where the old moderates of Hunan can express their opinions. Positioning itself as a mediator and common ground between the 6th and 8th, the 2nd finds itself rather hard pressed, with the unenviable task of maintaining order within Hunan.§!\n"
 HNN_rural_pacification: "Pacification Office"
 HNN_rural_pacification_long: "Hunan Rural Pacification Supervision Office (Hunan Qing Xiang Duban)\n§gRepresenting the dual offices of the Rural Pacification Office and Peace Preservation Office, the \"Hunan Rural Pacification Supervision Office\" is a conglomerate title created for, and held only by, a singular individual. He Jian. Following the continued insidious Kuomintang infighting that raged ever since their electoral victory, He Jian practically poured tinder on the inferno as he openly defected his 2nd Division of the 8th Army towards Cheng Qian's 6th Army. Securing a promotion, and his two new positions in Hunan's Provincial Government, the ambitious general has set forth on reforming his native Hunan in whatever way he can.\n\nUtilising his dual titles to ensure peace and stability within Hunan, the General is ostensibly tasked with the handling of Hunan's endemic regional militia issue. However, He has utilised his personal forces and men under his command for far more wide-ranging goals than its initial purpose. Intent on ensuring that Hunan's new era under the Kuomintang is as prosperous as can be, the office works to promote He Jian's reforms through both official and unofficial channels, levying and lobbying both Cheng Qian and Tang Shengzhi for their support in the initiatives.\n\nPerhaps considered another pawn in the chess match between the 6th and 8th, those within He Jian's close circle are all too aware of the Generals exceeding ambitions, and some believe that the \"King\" of Hunan might be aiming for the Chairmanship himself. Nonetheless, the Rural Pacification and Peace Preservation offices still endeavour for, fair, unbiased and stable governance. As long as you're not a socialist...§!\n"

 HNN_zhao_hengti: "Zhao Hengti"
 HNN_zhao_hengti_bio: "Zhao Hengti, the governor of Hunan for well over a decade. Born in 1880 in Hengyang, Zhao Hengti attended the 6th Chinese Class of the Imperial Japanese Army Academy, graduating with a specialisation in the field of artillery. He joined the Tongmenghui under Sun Yat-sen and participated in both the Xinhai Revolution and the Second Revolution as a military commander. After the failure of the Second Revolution, Zhao was imprisoned by Tang Xiangming on behalf of Yuan Shikai. He was released two years later by Cai E, and was given command of Hunan's first division. In 1920 he and Tan Yankai expelled Zhang Jingyao as Governor, Tan becoming Governor and Zhao Army Director-General.\n\nWith the Pingjiang Mutiny Tan resigned as Governor in favour of Zhao, and introduced the first provincial constitutional movement in Asia, formulating the Hunan Provincial Constitution, establishing a democratic provincial council and gubernatorial elections, of which he won the ones held in 1922. As Governor of Hunan, Zhao limited his power as the governor, a move commended by many.\n\nWith the onset of the Northern Expedition, Zhao was pushed out of Hunan by his former subordinate, Tang Shengzhi. He sought help from Wu Peifu, who restored Zhao as the governor. However, his position was as a military governor appointed by the Central Government, not as an elected governor as he wanted himself to be. With Wu looking north, Zhao Hengti was tied to the League of Eight Provinces, and although he was the one who holds the most power over his province, not answering to Sun Chuanfang in Nanjing, he chose to stick with him to avoid troubles with Germany."

Tang alongside He Yaozu and Ye Kaixin drove Tan out of Hengshan, who fled back to Guangzhou. In the following years, Ye and Tang came into increasing conflict and the latter felt that Zhao favoured the former. In March of 1926, Tang launched a rebellion against Zhao, which was crushed and forced Tang to flee to Guangzhou.\n\nTang was welcomed with open arms and his army was reorganised into the 8th Army of the NRA. They would prove themselves as one of the most capable forces of the KMT, pushing Zhao out of Hunan and even scoring victories against Wu Peifu. However, the National Revolution was crushed when the German Empire intervened on Wu's behalf, which resulted in the death of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek and the Central Committee fled to Paris.\n\nTang and the 8th Army fled into the mountains of Jiangxi and Fujian, where they resisted Sun Chuanfang's League forces for several years. After the Shanghai Uprising, Deng Yanda and Song Qingling led PAC-affiliated forces south to join up with Tang and formed the Mingan Insurgency."

However, realising the political situation of late 19th century China, he instead pursued a career in the military. He attended the Hunan Military Academy and then went to Japan, where he studied and met revolutionaries such as Huang Xing, Song Jiaoren, and Li Liejun. In 1905, he met Sun Yat-sen and joined Sun's Tongmenghui. He would graduate from the 6th Chinese Class of the Imperial Japanese Army Academy alongside Tang Jiyao, specialising in the field of artillery.\n\nWhen the Xinhai Revolution broke out in 1911, he took part in the Battle of Changsha.

 HNN_tang_xiangming: "Tang Xiangming"
 HNN_tang_xiangming_bio: "Tang Xiangming's career started as an Admiral in the Qing Empire. When the Xinhai Revolution broke out in 1911, he was under the command of Qing loyalists, but saw which way the wind was blowing, siding with the Revolutionaries. In October 1913 Tan Yankai was forced to resign as Governor of Hunan, and Tang was appointed by Yuan Shikai as Governor, and supported Yuan's attempts at crowning himself Emperor while ruling Hunan with an iron fist and a strict regime, earning him the nickname \"Tang the Butcher\". Due to his support of Yuan Shikai, Tang had to flee Hunan in July of 1916 as the Province sided with the National Protection Alliance, being replaced by Tan Yankai.\n\nHe joined the Zhili clique in 1917, and during the second Zhili-Fengtian war he served in Military Law Enforcement. When the Northern Expedition was defeated, Tang was given a garrison in Yueyang. While Wu would officially support Zhao as Governor of Hunan, he made sure to keep Tang ready just in case the Government in Changsha decided to turn against Beijing. Tang has notable sway with the western warlords, Chen Quzhen and Tian Yingzhao, and the Zhili appointed Governor of Guizhou, Yuan Zuming. So if push comes to shove, Tang is ready to do what he must to keep Hunan under Zhili control."

 HNN_yuan_zuming_bio: "Born to the strict Yuan Tingtai, Yuan Zuming would become fascinated by the military growing up. In 1909, Xingyi military school director Wang Wenhua recommended Yuan to Guizhou military envoy Liu Xianshi to assist in training the town regiment in Xingyi. When the National Protection War began, Yuan would join the National Protection Army under Wang Wenhua's command.\n\nAfter Wang ousted Liu Xianshi and seized power in Guizhou, Yuan would plot his demise. Yuan assassinated Wang in 1921, realigning the province with Beijing, becoming governor the following year. This infuriated Yunnan Governor Tang Jiyao, who would assist Liu Xianshi in pushing Yuan into Sichuan. Yuan intervened in local conflicts, ultimately resulting in Yang Sen and Liu Xiang jointly pushing Yuan out. With his army in tatters, Yuan aligned with the KMT, and his army became the 12th Army of the NRA.\n\nYuan assisted Tang Shengzhi in an invasion of Hunan, but the Northern Expedition would soon turn into a disaster, as the German Empire intervened on the side of the Zhili Clique and Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek was killed in chaos. Negotiating with Wu Peifu via his subordinate Zhao Yusong, Yuan would realign with Beijing. Appointed once again as Guizhou Governor, Yuan was only able to control an eastern slice of the province, with the majority being controlled by Tang Jiyao who propped his brother Tang Jiyu as Governor. Although Yuan remains unable to dislodge Tang from Guizhou, he remains confident that the day is coming when he may punish the Tangs for their treachery."

He became sympathetic to Marxism in 1920, having been influenced by intellectuals in Taoyuan. He Long marched into Sichuan in 1922 at the behest of Sun, but was unable to make great gains due to internal divisions in his army.\n\nThis experience turned him against Sun's policy of cooperation with local warlords. He joined the Kuomintang in 1924, following the first reorganisation and alignment with the Internationale. After Zhao Hengti expelled him from Sichuan, He Long retreated to Guizhou. In 1926, He Long merged his armies into the 8th Army under General Tang Shengzhi, a KMT aligned warlord who wished to retake Hunan from Zhao Hengti. He Long and the 8th Army would perform admirably during the Northern Expedition, but German Intervention and a failure to take Wuchang resulted in the collapse of the Kuomintang in China.\n\nWang Jingwei took the Central Committee into exile in Paris, where they remained for nearly a decade. Tang Shengzhi operating independently from the CEC led his men into neighbouring Jiangxi to avoid Zhao's returning forces, engaging in guerilla war against Sun Chuanfang's League forces in the region. Tang would join up with Deng Yanda's Mingan Insurgency after the Shanghai Uprising of 1932.

There Cai fell into the influence of the esteemed Hunanese educator Yang Changji and would go on to form the New People's Study Society in Changsha.\n\nWhen Cai had heard that the anarchists Cai Yuanpei and Li Shizeng had organised a Work Study Programme, he decided to join them and arrived to France in 1919 with his sister Cai Chang. In Paris, Cai organized the Work and Study Cooperative Society and advocated syndicalism in concurrent with the political mainstream.

Tang served Yuan Shikai's government until the former decided to make his imperial ambitions known, after which Tang fled to Tianjin and then to Shanghai. Tang returned to Beijing after Yuan's death and Duan ascended, but found himself alienated by 1918 and left to travel abroad.\n\nHe returned to China a nearly decade later, first to Beijing in 1927 with his political ally Liang Qichao, then a year later he went to join his brother in Hunan, where the younger Tang was serving as the garrison commander of Yueyang. Tang became the mayor of the city, and spearheaded the expansion of the Chinese Constitutionalist Party within Hunan. Tang Hualong's hopes of returning to prominence rest on the actions of his brother, and how much constitutional reform the admiral is willing to adhere to.§!"

The decisions the government can make may accelerate the progress of their reforms, but at what cost? Either way, Hunan will not be able to truly recover until its agricultural crisis is settled."

 HNN_increase_taxation: "Recalibrating our Taxation"
 HNN_increase_taxation_desc: "In order to properly finance our economic reforms, it is crucial that we increase the amount of revenues flowing into our treasury. Whilst we dare not disturb the delicate balance of Hunan's agricultural system too much, by recalibrating our land tax alongside our misc taxes and duties, we shall effectively target the wealth of the gentry and other landowners. They will no doubt protest, cry tyranny, however it's this or downright anarchy."

 HNN_maintain_order_in_countryside: "Maintain Order in the Countryside"
 HNN_maintain_order_in_countryside_desc: "Our rural society is currently undergoing seismic events in the broader cultural perception of what it means to be a peasant, and a landlord. To dissuade any attempts of the peasantry organising against the government or its bureaucrats, the only just response is to at least attempt to equalise the system. By demanding implementing regular audits of estates, and instating forced budgeting for the gentry, that should travel a far distance in tipping the scales towards the peasants. Likewise, to prevent any dissemination of anti-government sentiment and rhetoric, dispatching additional police officers to the countryside will aid in the maintenance of security, and generate the gratitude of the gentry."

 HNN_emphasising_cooperation: "Emphasising Cooperation with the Gentry"
 HNN_emphasising_cooperation_desc: "Whilst the government is acting in a just, honest and logical matter in approaching the land issue, the gentry and elites still continue to protest fiercely against any attempts to encroach on their political weight. In line with our principles, we shall dispatch numerous government ministers to conduct meetings with the local landowners personally, and reassure them that their rights are protected to the utmost."

 HNN_limited_redistribution: "Limited Land Redistribution"
 HNN_limited_redistribution_desc: "Having already implemented a series of reforms aimed at winning the minds of both peasantry and landlord alike, it is time to make serious concerted efforts to tackle the root of the issue. With the absolute loyalty of a new generation of district officials, we shall undergo a limited policy of redistributing the patchwork lands under our control. Granting first rights to the purchasing of land within their local area, and with government support for the bids of farmers, we shall allow for the gradual reorganisation of Hunan's patchwork network of arable land, without the need for overt violence."

 HNN_strike_against_landowners_desc_nokmt: "Despite the Governor having provided security and relative stability to the gentry for a decade, alongside the global financial crash having crippled Hunan, the gentry continue to mobilise their assets to halt our efforts of land reform. Refusing to see reason, and only respecting force, it is time that the government has a greater role in their daily lives. By dispatching army units to villages, we shall the gentry that the government means business. And if they continue to disrupt our efforts, they will lose the rights to their lands too."
 HNN_strike_against_landowners_desc_kmt: "For too long have the corrupt Beiyang despots ruled Hunan, for too long have they managed to split the province and peasantry into a disparate, disgusting, feudalistic empire, and for too long has the government refused to act. No more. With the Kuomintang finally in charge, we will stand fully with the common people, and mobilise them to strike back against their tyrannical overlords. Whilst we must show some restraint, lest anarchy rule the day, arming the peasantry and training local militia to protect their interests will show the elites that Hunan's peasantry has had enough, and the government has heard their cries."

 HNN_supporting_non_compliance: "Supporting Non-Compliance"
 HNN_supporting_non_compliance_desc: "Not all forms of opposition to the elites takes on a violent, or even chaotic approach. For there is a peaceful method that still remains most damaging to the interests and revenues of the gentry. By subsidising peasant families to form pacts of \"non-compliance\", great swathes of potential farmers will simply refuse to toil away at the fields. With government protection and support, all that'll be left to do is wait until the elites come to the negotiating table."

 HNN_reducing_gentry_control_desc_kmt: "Even with our continued efforts to hammer away at the heart of the peasantry's troubles, the gentry continue to be aloof, clinging desperately onto whatever wealth or political power they can muster. Their injustices and resistance only continue to frustrate both KMT Radical ideologues and the peasantry alike. Within the various local roles of governance, the gentry have lined the officials pockets, transforming what would be honest bureaucrats working for the government into tools for continued exploitation. However with Kuomintang control established, we shall relieve all those with elite sympathies within the district governments, and dispatch our own cadres to fill their places."
 HNN_reducing_gentry_control_desc_nokmt: "Even with our continued efforts to hammer away at the heart of the peasantry's troubles, the gentry continue to be aloof, clinging desperately onto whatever wealth or political power they can muster. Their continued persistence into clinging onto the old ways has led to much grief within the government, and with numerous elites actually participating within the provincial assembly, a block of political opposition to our continued reforms. Refusing to see reason, the Governor has decided that radical action is necessary. By reshuffling local district magistrates with fresh cadres from Changsha, those committed to the ideals of Federalism shall rule even at the smallest level of governance. With this, we can only hope that gentry obstruction ceases."

 HNN_seizing_estates_desc_nokmt: "Finally, the last straw has been broken. Once a close ally of the gentry, working together with them to ensure a stable Hunan province, their continued attempts to cling to tradition and the past has been their downfall. With no other option left, and heavy regret, the Governor has authorised the forceful seizure, nationalisation, and redistribution of all gentry estates deemed to be violating the principles of the agricultural reform programme. Extreme in intent, it is hoped that this shall be the final step to freeing Hunan's peasantry from their shackles of torment."
 HNN_seizing_estates_desc_kmt: "The continued insolence of the landlords has come at continued great costs to the progress and advancement of the province, and the nation as a whole. How is Hunan supposed to aid in the conclusion of the National Revolution if it is too indecisive, too cautious, to deal with the issues at home? Authorised by all members of the Hunan Provincial Government, various soldiers of the National Revolutionary Army will see to the seizure of elite estates and landholdings, to be redistributed in a \"Land to the Tiller\" programme. With this, the gentry issue shall be ultimately handled, and Hunan can look ever so fondly to a bright future ahead."

 HNN_cheap_credit: "Cheap Credit"
 HNN_cheap_credit_desc: "Agriculture in Hunan province presents formidable challenges, often plunging farmers into debt as they invest in vital modern tools like fertilisers, hoping for a bountiful harvest to offset their expenses. When the harvest is poor however, these financial woes are compounded and result in a brutal cycle of chronic debt. In order to support our toilers, let us negotiate with the banks to offer loans at favourable rates. Furthermore, we shall work to provide crop insurance directly to the interested farmers, granting them a sense of financial security in such dire times."

 HNN_maintaining_proper_irrigation: "Maintaining Proper Irrigation"
 HNN_maintaining_proper_irrigation_desc: "Inundated with the prosperity and fertility granted by the Xiang river, Hunan is a province of great biodiversity and agricultural output. However to our West lies the lands of Guizhou province. Whilst relatively prosperous on its own, the mismanagement of the province by the respective parties of Yuan Zuming and Tang Jiyu has lead to a serious unevenness in agricultural harvests. Through the construction of irrigation canals directed from the Xiang river, we can establish new reservoirs to ensure that no harvest is truly a failure."

 HNN_modernising_our_communication: "Modernising our Communication Networks"
 HNN_modernising_our_communication_desc: "Like other provincial governments within the nation, Hunan has thoroughly taken to the advancements in global telecommunications technology, seeking the modernising progress and boons that it grants. Whilst previous decades within Hunan saw most established telegraphs being related exclusively to military affairs. With our new lease on development, let us work towards expanding our network to not only our districts, but in such a way as to achieve broader integration into the national network as whole. With such efforts, only then shall Hunan truly be a modern province."

 HNN_kaili_to_changsha: "From West to East"
 HNN_kaili_to_changsha_desc: "Rather disparagingly, the railway network across China, is to say the least, like tattered tracts of loose string. Disconnected in nature, and often remaining isolated within provincial borders, it is a situation most dire, yet one that will have to wait until national unification. Due to Hunan's greater integration with the internal trade routes of the nation, Changsha has the rare benefit of containing a direct line from Beijing to Guangzhou. Yet such a grand railroad reflects poorly on the fact that even within our own province, one of our larger cities remains disconnected from the capital. Through the use of state funding, we shall enlist the assistance of local railroad companies to finally connect Kaili to the rest of the nation."

 HNN_industrial_reform_mission_timer: "Industrial Reforms Progress"
 HNN_industrial_reform_mission_timer_desc: "Undergoing significant changes in the industrial sector, Hunan province is experiencing critical efforts to undo the decades of injustice and neglect experienced by its urban centres. The decisions the government can make may accelerate the progress of their reforms, but at what cost? Either way, Hunan will not be able to truly recover until its industrial crisis is settled."

 HNN_pursuing_new_partners: "Pursuing New Economic Partners"
 HNN_pursuing_new_partners_desc: "Ultimately, in order to reform our once export focused economy into that of one pursuing self-sufficiency, it will be necessary to not only mobilise the government, but the people as well. By emphasising local economic partners within our new ventures, we shall ensure that the consumption and purchase of goods of Hunanese nature, nominally stays within Hunan, and that the revenues created is used to develop the province proper."

 HNN_securing_urban_support: "Securing Urbanite Support"
 HNN_securing_urban_support_desc: "For quite some time, the Urban centres of Hunan have been hotbeds for the development and growth of the Chinese Syndicalist Party; fomenting divisions between the administration and the workers. It has created a large divide, effectively culling any attempts to hear their qualms, and for the government to likewise preach our reassurances. Whilst no doubt incredibly costly, it is without a doubt necessary that we bring the workers and government together once more, for progress has no time for petty squabbles."

 HNN_economic_controls_board: "Establish an Economic Controls Board"
 HNN_economic_controls_board_desc: "Decried by the defenders of capitalism within our province as authoritarianism on the government's part, the drafted plans for the establishment of the Economic Controls Board of Hunan Province would see the governing body control the ebb and flow of imports via licensing. With great care, the board would exclude unwanted foreign commodities that would have an unfair advantage with Hunan's own domestic production. However, the controversial aspect of the plan situates in the fact that the licensing applies not only to products outside China, but to those outside the provincial boundaries too, ultimately damaging national reunification. Whilst it is done with a heavy heart, it is crucial to seeing Hunan's economic recovery to its conclusion."

 HNN_zhuzhou_industrial_zone: "Zhuzhou Industrial Zone"
 HNN_zhuzhou_industrial_zone_desc: "Situated upon the Xiang River and the Guangzhou-Wuhan railway, the city of Zhuzhou is but prime real estate for greater economic development. Recently chosen as a site as part of our industrial reform programme, the government hopes to see a rather ambitious development of the city, transforming it into the Zhuzhou Industrial zone due to its sheer potential. Whilst the factories constructed there would be government owned, it will surely boost the might of Hunan's domestic metallurgical and chemical industries."

 HNN_reinforce_the_banks_of_hunan: "Reinforce the Banking Sector"
 HNN_reinforce_the_banks_of_hunan_desc: "Not being capable of rivalling the hubs of commerce within Guangzhou, Wuhan or Shanghai, the domestic banks of Hunan have largely either been bought out by enterprises outside provincial control, or otherwise gone bust. Despite bringing stability and profit to the Hunanese financial markets, there are numerous fears that the greater powers that own said institutions would sooner see to it that their assets within Hunan be liquidated when deemed unprofitable, rather than maintain them for the good of the people. Moreover, China is a nation split across many faces, and each one has their own coin. With banks frequently having to contend with a mixture of legal, local and illegal currency, it has led to a serious distrust of the value of Hunan's own provincial currency. Whilst a national currency will have to wait until unification, perhaps with proper government oversight and the establishment of a central bank, we can setup the groundwork for greater development of the province in the future."

 HNN_influx_of_capital: "Influx of Capital"
 HNN_influx_of_capital_desc: "The recent surge of currency flows and investments into Hunan has provided the government the tantalising experience of the considerable successes to be made in the future. Prospective investors have examined the possible expansion of our domestic agrarian products like tea, ramie and hemp, others have examined Hunan's desperate need for grand infrastructure projects to truly support our industrial reforms. We shall take full advantage of this new hustle and bustle within the province, ensuring that whatever these investors and their projects need, we can supply it."

 HNN_privatise_railroads: "Privatise Railroads"
 HNN_privatise_railroads_desc: "With Hunan's connection to the central Guangzhou-Beijing railway network, the provincial government has frequently seen attempts from private buyers to capitalise on the lucrative potential of such a connection. However all up to now, the ringleaders in Changsha have effectively refused the portioning and sale of such a crucial lifeline for the province. Yet with our industrial reforms progressing readily, and even more potential railroad acquirers, perhaps it is time to finally privatise the railroad. Reducing the government necessity to maintain such a line, whilst presumably producing much needed capital to further create railways throughout the province."

 HNN_acquiring_foreign_expertise: "Acquiring Foreign Expertise"
 HNN_acquiring_foreign_expertise_desc: "Well versed in the affairs of local culture, and the nation's society as a whole, Hunan's bustling intellectual scene grants great boons to our general intellectualism within the province, providing our universities and schools with great masters of which the future generations can learn from. Yet paradoxically, our local experts in industrial matters have struggled to maintain the forward momentum brough about by our education institutions. To supplement this, the government shall embark on a foreign hiring programme, in which those with the knowledge in modern industry and electronics will be invited to train our own workers and managers, so that Hunan's industry is truly brought into the new age."

Candidates will have to be carefully \"vetted\" to ensure their compliance with the Three Principles, and a certain degree of finesse will be required to ensure none of these local councils are ever out of step with the Provincial Chairman.

Having converted to Buddhism in a time of great personal strife, the general has experienced a new lease on life, that he ascertains to have originated from his religious philosophy.

 HNN_modernised_cavalry_command_desc: "China's national defence industry does not currently have the capacity to produce a true armoured, or even mechanised, force comparable to those within the West, however that does not mean we cannot adopt the primacy of manoeuvre warfare. As advocated for by the cutting edge theorists of Moscow, Berlin and London, let us supplement our limited motorised stockpiles with our pre-existing cavalry detachments, to allow us to truly exploit breakthroughs."

 HNN_pincer_and_envelopment: "Pincer and Envelopment"
 HNN_pincer_and_envelopment_desc: "Our enemies may utilise superior arms, or superior numbers to attempt to squash our Revolution, however through the utilisation of pincer and envelopment tactics, even a superior force can be shattered. By isolating hostile columns through our knowledge of the terrain and the coordination of our Regular Army alongside cavalry units, we can whittle and destroy whole enemy divisions."

 HNN_luring_the_enemy_in_deep: "Luring the Enemy in Deep"
 HNN_luring_the_enemy_in_deep_desc: "Long have Chinese military theorists toyed with the concept of \"luring the enemy in deep\". As evidenced by Qing theorists such as Yangfang Shuolue, Haiguo Tuzhi, or even modern revolutionary figures such as Cai E. Let us finally employ the methods these great thinkers drafted. Through careful enticement of enemy forces to follow our men, we will let the vastness of our lands crush them."

 HNN_centralised_planning_decentralised_execution: "Centralised Planning, Decentralised Execution"
 HNN_centralised_planning_decentralised_execution_desc: "As evidenced multiple times throughout history, stringent following of orders can often result in calamitous results, should the battle situation differ from what was planned. Whilst we should always hope to draft a concrete plan of objectives to take, and battles to fight, let us delegate the specific concise orders to the individual commanders on the field, granting them the initiative to decide the best course of action."

 HNN_hallmark_of_revolutionary_warfare: "Hallmark of Revolutionary Warfare"
 HNN_hallmark_of_revolutionary_warfare_desc: "Truly and utterly, the conjoining of the 6th and 8th National Revolutionary Army has birthed a fanatical force, intent on seeing that Dr. Sun's vision for China does not die. Carrying the torch of our slain comrades, and of the Chinese people of the future, we embark on our own brave journey. Mobilisation of all classes, acting in unison for the betterment of the nation, we are the true hallmark of revolutionary warfare."

 HNN_victors_of_weltkrieg_victors_of_china: "Victors of the Weltkrieg, Victors of China"
 HNN_victors_of_weltkrieg_victors_of_china_desc: "Seeing fierce fighting in the Weltkrieg, it was the Heer who ultimately shined victorious in the brutal battles. Time and time again they triumphed, and yet again, they triumphed when German boots intervened on the side of the Zhili clique, and crushed the National Revolutionary Army during the Northern Expedition. We must work to produce an army capable of such victories, whilst minimising the German Giant's faults."

 HNN_our_own_heer: "Our Own Heer"
 HNN_our_own_heer_desc: "As all around the world know, the armed forces of the German Empire are the most premier fighting force internationally. Far and wide, the German Eagle stretches its wings entirely due to the capability of its Heer. Whilst our province pales in German partnership compared to those within the League, or within Beijing, our own native theorists have managed to study the German Military Mission to the Zhili, and we can only hope to emulate it."

 HNN_acting_as_one: "Acting as One"
 HNN_acting_as_one_desc: "Critical to the German success was their capability to coordinate the mass action of their armed forces to secure a singular, common objective. With the rapid innovations within the sphere of radio communications, the usefulness and effectiveness of such coordinated actions has only skyrocketed. Through investment into the development of our own communications technology, let us bring forth the new age of warfare to China."

 HNN_concealment_and_reconnaissance: "Concealment and Reconnaissance"
 HNN_concealment_and_reconnaissance_desc: "With the world swiftly approach calamity, the Chinese nation too will no doubt be caught up in the whirlwind. In order to ensure we retain an edge on potential enemies, we should train our commanders on the principles of concealment and reconnaissance. By placing special primacy on maintaining secrecy, whilst expanding our recon detachments, and scouting operations, we shall forever maintain the initiative in combat."

 HNN_defence_and_industry_in_tandem: "Defence and Industry in Tandem"
 HNN_defence_and_industry_in_tandem_desc: "As espoused most critically by German theorists within the all factions of their military, the army and industrial sector most work towards a common synergetic goal of securing our independence. By initiating special business contracts with budding entrepreneurs, we shall work in unison to mobilise the full might of Hunan's industry and manpower."

 HNN_victory_through_innovation: "Victory Through Innovation"
 HNN_victory_through_innovation_desc: "The Weltkrieg brazenly displayed how the rapid development of arms can turn the tides of conflict. Through the development of tanks, air fleets, and even submarines, the balance was tipped to one side's favour. Whilst limited in capacity, our government shall place extensive investments into the education sector in order to ensure that Hunan maintains a technological edge on its rivals."

 HNN_officers_example: "Officer's Example"
 HNN_officers_example_desc: "Truly the soldiers could not achieve victory on their own, for it is the officer corps itself, the commanders, that lead the charge. Planning out how best to achieve the province's strategical objectives through the correct application of ground level tactics, these individuals deserve special recompense. For these great individuals are the swordbearers of Hunan's salvation."

 HNN_new_infantry_drill_regulations: "New Infantry Drill Regulations"
 HNN_new_infantry_drill_regulations_desc: "The \"Caofa\", or \"New Infantry Drill Regulations\", was the primary source for teaching in the late Qing military curriculums of old. Whilst it comes from a time before modern mobile warfare, its basic principles still ring true in this very age. Placing primacy on the infantry formation, and advocating to always be on the offensive, let us mandate that the officers of our army be educated in such a useful work of literature."

 HNN_the_example_for_the_nation_desc: "Our army knows no bounds. Peerless, and without adversary, it is a shining beacon to be emulated nationwide. Whilst it may not compare truly to the German Empire's Heer, on the Chinese battlefield, it shall reign supreme. Just like Hunan's honest governance and spirit is to serve as a model for the other provinces, so too shall our military might."

 HNN_revitalise_zhuzhou_arsenal: "Revitalise Zhuzhou Arsenal"
 HNN_revitalise_zhuzhou_arsenal_desc: "Having fallen into financial and production troubles following the turn of the new year, Zhuzhou arsenal still shows itself truly capable of manufacturing great swathes of arms for our native armies and outside the province. Let us renew our investments into the crucial arsenal, so that it might very well rival that of even Taiyuan."

 HNN_a_thorough_reexamination_of_strategy: "Thorough Examination of Strategy"
 HNN_a_thorough_reexamination_of_strategy_desc: "Through our great period of military slumber, our commanding officers have not truly caught up to the modern age, some still living in the era of the ZhiFeng wars. Even worse, when compared to western armies, China's armies would never hope to even be relative equals. It may be costly, but we shall embark on a thorough study of our strategies, for Hunan's very provincial integrity might be at stake."

 HNN_provincial_redoubts_desc: "Not truly capable of relying on our own native defences, a large portion of our engineering corps have suggested the construction of various national redoubts on the borders with our most dangerous enemies. Through government financing, great swathes of concrete bunkers shall be erected, sure to be the bulwark in any attempt to uproot our government in Changsha."

 HNN_producing_a_viable_air_fleet: "Producing a Viable Air Fleet"
 HNN_producing_a_viable_air_fleet_desc: "Truly Chinese attempts to control our own domestic skies have been paltry at best. With the most capable fleets being out of date biplanes sported by those within Guangdong, or Fengtian. We could never hope to truly challenge foreign skies, but let us work towards securing our own airspace's defence. At the very least, to protect Hunan's citizenry from fearing the skies."

 HNN_securing_hunans_airspace: "Securing Hunan's Airspace"
 HNN_securing_hunans_airspace_desc: "Lacking in an existing aeronautics industry, and without the funds or manpower to dedicate to its formation, the government has decided to invest in the implementation of a series of anti-air batteries, so that at the very least, our brave soldiers on the ground can shoot down any intrepid bomber or fighter that comes our way."

 HNN_developing_native_pilots: "Developing Native Pilots"
 HNN_developing_native_pilots_desc: "Completely alien to a large portion of Hunan's populace, the training of pilots to plan what little machines we can muster has been a thoroughly difficult process. Through concerted governmental effort, and perhaps by enticing those outside the province, we must implement a concrete curriculum to educate daring Hunanese airmen on the true qualities of an ace pilot."

 HNN_importing_fighter_designs: "Importing Fighter Designs"
 HNN_importing_fighter_designs_desc: "Bereft of any native fighter designs, but inundated with resources to secure foreign inventions, the government has deemed it necessary to secure the import of blueprints from nations willing to provide them. Whilst unfortunate, this will have to do until China sees its own air industry develop."

 HNN_a_democratic_province: "Constitutional Legacy"
 HNN_a_democratic_province_desc: "Unlike other provinces, Hunan is unique in that it has a constitution. Promulgated by Zhao Hengti and twelve others on January 1st, 1922, the Provincial Constitution seeks to uphold the rights of every Hunanese person, be they man, woman, and child. It promises free elections in the province of Hunan, with an elected Provincial Council and an elected Governor. While Zhao holds Hunan's Democracy close to heart, his commitment to his ideals (and the often rowdy Assembly) means that political deadlock is common. The Constitution also has a clause detailing Hunan's \"Monroe Doctrine\", which states that no Hunanese troops shall march out of Hunan, and no other provinces' troops may march into Hunan."

 HNN_constitutional_hopes_dashed: "Constitutional Hopes Dashed"
 HNN_constitutional_hopes_dashed_desc: "Tang Xiangming has revoked the reimplementation of the Hunan Constitution, and installed himself as Military Governor, crushing Hunan's democratic dream under his iron boot."

 HNN_intellectual_hub: "Intellectual Hub"
 HNN_intellectual_hub_desc: "Within China, Hunan is one of the few places where intellectuals can gather and speak freely. While this has been a wonder for advancement in our province, harbouring this many intellectuals can be costly on our relatively poorer province"

 HNN_the_western_diarchy: "The Western Diarchy"
 HNN_the_western_diarchy_desc: "The western part of Hunan, Xiangxi, is dominated by two warlords, Chen Quzhen and Tian Yingzhao. Nominal loyal to Zhao, they hold greater sympathies with Tang Xiangming. Either way they serve as a thorn in the Governor's side, and they must either be compromised with, brought in line, or the Diarchy must fall."

 HNN_clearing_house: "Clearing House"
 HNN_clearing_house_desc: "With Hunan's political situation finally settled away, the government can now undergo the critically necessary reforms in order to revitalise our officer corps and staff. Through a process of careful examination, harsh punishment for any perceived signs of corruption, and reinvigorated training drills, the Hunanese army will shine like never before."

 HNN_arise_hunans_peasantry_idea: "Ingenious Arms Manufacturing"
 HNN_arise_hunans_peasantry_idea_desc: "Whilst Hunan may not have the glorious industries in Shenyang, Taiyuan, or Jinling, what we lack in arms capacity we make up for in ingenuity. Through salvaging unusable equipment, reusing older equipment and retooling our machinery, the Hunan arm's industry can more efficiently produce a new generation of rifles for our new generation of soldiers."

 HNN_reexamining_our_strategies: "Re-examining Our Strategies"
 HNN_reexamining_our_strategies_desc: "Through a thorough process of analysing our previous faults on the battlefield, the performance of both the Zhili armies and the National Revolutionary Army, we aim to eventually modernise our own native Hunan army to those of western standards. However the additional bureaucracy, and new strategies, are impacting our commander's abilities to perform in live combat."

 HNN_perilous_industrial_sector: "Perilous Industrial Sector"
 HNN_perilous_industrial_sector_desc: "To the south lies the Shining Star of the Pearl River Delta, Guangzhou. To the northeast, lies the amalgamation of three industrial cities, Wuhan, and to the west, the practical metropolis of the interior, Chongqing. Yet lying in the crossroads between all of them, are the modest industrial hubs of Changde and Changsha. Towering far above the vast swathes of agrarian tilled land that innumerates Hunan Province, the two cities contribute the largest fair to our industrial capacity. Yet neither have received any due attention, with investors preferring to take their money to greener pastures in neighbouring provinces. This leaves the Hunanese government with a somewhat dangerous situation, for the entire industrial sector hinges on the success of two under-financed urban centres."

 HNN_intense_agricultural_imbalance: "Intense Agricultural Imbalance"
 HNN_intense_agricultural_imbalance_desc: "Not unlike the rest of China's interior, Hunan is a largely agricultural economy with scarce urban cities. Numerous villages and farming communities are scattered all throughout, with even more workers tilling their fields. Upon further analysis, one of the most striking characteristics of Hunan's — and the nation's, as a whole — agricultural system is the nigh Feudalistic nightmare that it represents. Local Gentry and Landlords rule their village communities like monarchs and their fiefdoms, and overwhelmingly the populace is worse off for it. However landowner interests are largely something the Changsha government has had to oblige with, for they control the strings that pilot the Hunanese economy."

 HNN_derelict_industrial_sector: "Derelict Industrial Sector"
 HNN_derelict_industrial_sector_desc: "The tsunami of Black Monday has finally washed over East Asia, and with the calamity alongside stringent unresting finally causing the death knell of the League, so too has Hunan's meagre industrial offerings gone with it. Like a battering ram, the chaos in the east has crashed through all businesses in Changsha and Changde alike, with small businesses closing, and larger ones making swathes of employees redundant. With our economy completely capsized, the vitality of our urban centres fades, and the government must absolutely act to alleviate the suffering."

 HNN_catastrophic_agricultural_crisis: "Catastrophic Agricultural Crisis"
 HNN_catastrophic_agricultural_crisis_desc: "Being mostly agrarian in nature, the global economic downturn has brought the hammer down hard on Hunan's agricultural stability. The once productive, if criminally imbalanced, agrarian situation has swiftly transitioned into a rapidly developing crisis. With money incredibly light, yet harvests continuing, there's a serious inundation of products yet no potential individuals to sell too, resulting in wasted efforts and foodstuffs. Worse yet, the landowners are deeming it necessary to liquidate jobs to protect their assets, causing further unrest."

 HNN_stabilising_industrial_sector: "Stabilising Industrial Sector"
 HNN_stabilising_industrial_sector_desc: "With the government finally deigning to address the industrial issue, our industry has seen remarkable stabilisation in line with other global economies throughout the world. Whilst still worse off than before the crisis, businesses are no longer closing, and unemployment is no longer rising. With such chaos lies opportunity, for the government can now work towards rejuvenating the economy from a simple starting position, as the stagnation of the past has been annihilated in economic fury."

 HNN_renewed_agricultural_balance: "Renewed Agricultural Balance"
 HNN_renewed_agricultural_balance_desc: "Embarking on a grand mission to revive, and ultimately, improve Hunan's economy, the government's early initiatives alongside the reduction of the landowner's assets and power has resulted in a sort of agricultural equilibrium. Whilst abuses still occur, and the gentry still hold significant sway over the province, the renewed balance has resulted in the blank slate necessary to build Hunan's agriculture in a productive manner."

 HNN_independent_industrial_sector: "Independent Industrial Sector"
 HNN_independent_industrial_sector_desc: "Pursuing a policy of economic independence, the government has seen to it that Hunan's industry will work for the Hunanese people, and not foreign investors outside of the provincial borders. Considered a radical policy by proponents of a free market, the government has witnessed what rampant unrestricted capitalism yields, and it's certainly not pretty. "

 HNN_developing_industrial_sector: "Developing Industrial Sector"
 HNN_developing_industrial_sector_desc: "Financing Hunan's urban development through the enticement of foreign investors, our economy will take a remarkable open doors policy in the terms of growth. Through incentives, promised stability, and subsidies, Changsha shall become a cornucopia of industrial innovation and manufacturing, rivalling even the towering smokestacks of Manchuria."

 HNN_self_sufficient_industry: "Self Sufficient Industry"
 HNN_self_sufficient_industry_desc: "Achieving true economic self sufficiency, the Hunanese government initiatives have yielded an economy that works for the people, not the investors. With wealth slowly developing within our people, their prosperity grows alongside it, and our province is all the better for it. Whilst not renowned by any means, a new era of prosperity has dawned on Hunan's people."

 HNN_export_oriented_industry: "Export Oriented Industry"
 HNN_export_oriented_industry_desc: "Not being comparable to the contemporary economies of Tokyo or the West, our industrial situation is still nothing to scoff out. Prioritising our exports, the rapid development of factories and the booming production of goods hs led to a flourishing marvel of excellent economic management. Whilst certainly reliant on the stability of foreign investments and trade, Hunan's economy flourishes nonetheless."

 HNN_careful_agricultural_reform: "Careful Agricultural Reform"
 HNN_careful_agricultural_reform_desc: "Foreseeing total land redistribution as inevitably resulting in chaos, Hunan's policymakers have deemed it necessary to initiate a policy of moderated land reform. In which, they implement a series of programmes dedicated to halting the flagrant abuses of the elite landowning class, whilst simultaneously using government funds to purchase and redistribute land to its workers. However even such moderate plans has led to contention from the gentry, concerned that it is merely a ploy of a the Governor to cement his own power further, yet the Governor has still sought to reassure them that this is for the prosperity of the province."

 HNN_embers_of_agricultural_redistribution: "Embers of Agricultural Redistribution"
 HNN_embers_of_agricultural_redistribution_desc: "Deliberating that radical action was necessary to salvage and rejuvenate Hunan's shaky agricultural system, the policymakers in Changsha have initiated a programme of limited land redistribution. In which, the government has begun to purchase (and seize) various landowner estates, and selling them to larger families, or peasant councils. Earning much anger from the elites, as to be expected, they have worked to produce attempts to block the government or otherwise obstinate the process, to little result."

 HNN_revitalised_agricultural_balance: "Revitalised Agricultural Balance"
 HNN_revitalised_agricultural_balance_desc: "Having reached the conclusion of their agricultural initiatives, the government's measured approach of land reform has seen to the creation of a new, revitalised, agricultural balance. With the scales not necessarily tipped too far in one direction, the leaders in Changsha have seen to a streamlining of Hunan's feudal patchwork landownership. However while more radical members of society may deem it not going far enough, the peasants and gentry of Hunan have seen mutual improvement in their daily lives, and the cries of dissent are largely drowned out."

 HNN_peasant_oriented_agriculture: "Peasant Oriented Agriculture"
 HNN_peasant_oriented_agriculture_desc: "Finally concluding their economic programme, the government's peasant focused approach has seemingly yielded considerable benefit to their livelihoods. With support of local peasant cooperatives and councils, alongside the now renewed redistribution of land from the few to the many, Hunan's agricultural system is a true shining star amongst China's agrarian interior. Try as they might, the old elites' attempts to block progress have resulted in futility, and with their power significantly diminished, all shall have their fair share of the land that is toiled."

 HNN_peasant_oriented_self_sufficient_economy: "Peasant Oriented Self Sufficient Economy"
 HNN_peasant_oriented_self_sufficient_economy_desc: "Fortuitously the final conclusion and integration of Hunan's economic reforms has yielded a fantastic result. With a reignited focus on Hunan first, the economy has taken a uniquely peasant-province outlook. Prioritising the needs of the peasantry, the workers, and all Hunanese, they can all experience their long overdue reprieve from endless toiling and working, for the meagre scraps granted to them by the \"goodwill\" of foreign financiers and gentry. With the economic sector secure and flourishing, so too shall Hunan prosper within the chaos of the Warlord Era."

 HNN_revitalised_export_oriented_economy: "Revitalised Export Oriented Economy"
 HNN_revitalised_export_oriented_economy_desc: "Fortuitously the final conclusion and integration of Hunan's economic reforms has yielded a fantastic result. With a reignited focus on transforming the province into an economic powerhouse, the financial system has taken on a uniquely industrious and modernised outlook. Rivalling the economic might of the League and Fengtian, without any of the dubious strings attached, Hunan's economic success story is that to be marvelled at. Boundless opportunities wait for the Hunanese capitalist utopia."

 HNN_peasant_oriented_export_oriented_economy: "Peasant Oriented Export Oriented Economy"
 HNN_peasant_oriented_export_oriented_economy_desc: "In what some ideological hardliners would decry as an esoteric mixture of muddled principles, Hunan's economic reform programmes have produced an eclectic peasant prioritising export economy. For the peasants labour fairly on the fields, and their agricultural production is transformed into goods such as clothing, or luxuries, which are then sold onto international markets. Ultimately, Hunan's economic model is that of a meritocratic one, integrated finely with the broader markets, ensuring that both worker and peasant alike experience the fortunes granted to them by their employment."

 HNN_revitalised_self_sufficient_economy: "Revitalised Self Sufficient Economy"
 HNN_revitalised_self_sufficient_economy_desc: "Having produced a two-pronged approach to economic management, the Hunanese economy has produced two faces. On one edge, lies the moderated land reform equalising the playing field between the gentry and tillers, whilst maintaining honesty and stability. On the other, a provincial focused development of the urban centres ensuring complete government management of its critical industries. In the end however, the financial situation is better off for it, as the government bears witness to an influx of revenues, and the people experience great wealth. Hunan's recovery is a model of great success, that much is for certain."

 HNN_balancing_the_books_idea: "Balancing the Books"
 HNN_balancing_the_books_idea_desc: "Through a process of critical assessment, cleansing of corruption, removal of unnecessary expenses and the tightening of the budget, the government is undergoing an intense period of economic balancing. Through our efforts however, the government should have improved Hunan's regional situation enough to resuscitate prosperity, even at the cost of a period of trudging through a bureaucratic swamp."

 HNN_seized_foreign_assets: "Seized Foreign Assets"
 HNN_seized_foreign_assets_desc: "In line with Hunan's independent economic direction, the government has seen to the nationalisation and seizure of various critical industries in the hands of the imperialists. With such radical action, our government coffers are being rapidly filled, and the economy is witnessing a marginal boom, even at the cost of foreign investors fleeing persecution."

 HNN_subsidised_military_industry: "Subsidised Military Industry"
 HNN_subsidised_military_industry_desc: "Deeming Hunan the bulwark of Zhili prosperity, Governor Tang Xiangming has utilised his contacts within the Central Government to invite a series of military industrial tycoons to promulgate new armament factories within Hunan. With this, the hope is that Hunan will develop into a hotspot for armament manufacturing, one to rival even the arsenals within Hubei or Shanxi."

 HNN_open_for_business: "Open for Business"
 HNN_open_for_business_desc: "With Hunan's fresh initiative on opening its markets to foreign investment, it has witnessed a flood of entrepreneurial ventures by local, and international, capitalists alike. With their assistance, our economy is riding a flourish of success, albeit the government has seen itself strained, unable to maintain the bureaucratic procedures to properly process the needs of the endearing businessmen."

 HNN_union_government_synergy: "Union Government Synergy"
 HNN_union_government_synergy_desc: "Extending an open hand to the usually agitative Changsha unions has resulted in an agreement between the government and union leaders. Acceding to the demands of the workers, the government has promised to prioritise their well-being in line with the government's self-sufficient industrial direction. In turn, the unions have seen to a glorious upturn in worker productivity, ensuring mutual benefit for both parties."

 HNN_industrial_self_sufficiency_idea: "Industrial Self Sufficiency"
 HNN_industrial_self_sufficiency_idea_desc: "Truly, detractors and allies alike can agree on one thing. The new economy of Hunan is that of a uniquely Hunanese one, no longer needing to be attached to any larger party like the League, instead it stands on its own two feet, powerful, and working for the Hunanese people first and foremost. With its renewed stature, it should be capable of withstanding any radical shift in economic prospects, now and forever."

 HNN_industrial_self_sufficiency_aat_idea: "Industrial Self Sufficiency"
 HNN_industrial_self_sufficiency_aat_idea_desc: "Truly, detractors and allies alike can agree on one thing. The new economy of Hunan is that of a uniquely Hunanese one, no longer needing to be attached to any larger party like the League, instead it stands on its own two feet, powerful, and working for the Hunanese people first and foremost. With its renewed stature, it should be capable of withstanding any radical shift in economic prospects, now and forever."

 HNN_harmonious_land_development: "Harmonious Land Development"
 HNN_harmonious_land_development_desc: "With our new economic initiatives resulting in bounding successes, our government has achieved a new level of \"harmony\" with the agrarian situation. Seeing rejuvenated efforts to produce not just for the economy, but also for the people, Hunan has achieved what could be considered the ideal form of agricultural economic management."

 HNN_peasant_councils: "Peasant Councils"
 HNN_peasant_councils_desc: "With government policy seeking a new peasant friendly approach to agriculture, it has allowed the formation of local peasant councils with the ultimate aim of serving as a counterbalance to the political control of the gentry. With their organisation, and support from Changsha, this new alliance with the peasantry has resulted in a flood of political support and patriotism throughout the whole province."

 HNN_lingering_kmt_insurgents: "Lingering KMT Insurgents"
 HNN_lingering_kmt_insurgents_desc: "Despite our victory over the KMT, there are still insurgent cells rooted in Hunan, it will take a concerted effort from Governor Tang Xiangming and his forces in order to root out the last of the KMT from our province."

 HNN_turbulent_intelligentsia: "Turbulent Intelligentsia"
 HNN_turbulent_intelligentsia_desc: "With our takeover of Hunan, we have diverted funds formerly given to the provinces intelligentsia and instead diverted them to more important matters. This, alongside the strong nature of our regime, has turned Hunan's large intelligentsia against us, hampering our development until we can deal with the disloyal intellectuals."

 HNN_martial_law: "Martial Law"
 HNN_martial_law_desc: "In order to properly crush the Kuomintang insurgents that managed to survive the initial fights with Tang, the Governor has declared a state of martial law. While it may seem harsh to outside and especially foreign observers, it is necessary for the safety of the citizens of Hunan, as it is the only way to keep the Kuomintang's insurgents from raiding their villages and pillaging everything from them."

 HNN_eradicated_opposition: "Eradicated Opposition"
 HNN_eradicated_opposition_desc: "With the Kuomintang eradicated, and the previous Governor's \"democratic\" allies properly muzzled, Governor Tang Xiangming has successfully eradicated all opposition to the Zhili clique, and to his own rule in Hunan. Some have asked if this means the martial law can end, but the sad truth is that Hunan still has many external enemies, and is still under constant threat from the outside."

 HNN_defence_commission: "Defence Commission - §LEstablished§!"
 HNN_defence_commission_desc: "The \"Commission for the Defence of the Hunan Province\", or Defence Commission for short, is a recently established government body that grants Governor Tang broad powers in \"Any matters related to the defence of Hunan\".

 HNN_defence_commission_2_desc: "The \"Commission for the Defence of the Hunan Province\", or Defence Commission for short, is a recently established government body that grants Governor Tang broad powers in \"Any matters related to the defence of Hunan\".

 HNN_defence_commission_3: "Defence Commission - §PRule by Decree§!"
 HNN_defence_commission_3_desc: "The \"Commission for the Defence of the Hunan Province\", or Defence Commission for short, is a recently established government body that grants Governor Tang broad powers in \"Any matters related to the defence of Hunan\". These powers have become so broad in nature that it means Governor Tang Xiangming can effectively rule by decrees through the Commission, not even needing the Assembly to act as a rubber stamp for his will to become action."

 HNN_alliance_with_the_diarchy: "Alliance with the Diarchy"
 HNN_alliance_with_the_diarchy_desc: "After recent talks with the Diarchy in western Hunan, Governor Tang has come to an understanding with them, their local knowledge of the region will be invaluable in planning for the defence of Hunan."

 HNN_socialism_vanquished_desc: "Between Tang Hualong's reforms and Tang Xiangming's crackdowns, what support for Socialism there was in Hunan is quickly breaking down into scattered remnants. With support for the Kuomintang and Chinese Syndicalists receding further and further, the rule of our Governor seems more secure each and ever day"

 HNN_safe_and_secure: "Safe and Secure"
 HNN_safe_and_secure_desc: "Governor Tang Xiangming has ensured two things, safety and security. Allying with the Xiangxi Diarchy, crushing the Socialist terrorists of the KMT and the CSP. This has required a somewhat steep, but necessary consolidation of power via his Defence Commission. With all that he has done for the Province, he can rest easy knowing that his iron grip on Hunan is consolidated, and that he will be able to protect it from any who dare threaten his province."

 HNN_a_democratic_province_2_desc: "Unlike other provinces, Hunan is unique in that it has a constitution. Promulgated by Zhao Hengti and twelve others on January 1st, 1922, the Provincial Constitution seeks to uphold the rights of every Hunanese person, be they man, woman, and child. It promises free elections in the province of Hunan, with an elected Provincial Council and an elected Governor. With the success of recent talks, Zhao has managed to get the Assembly to work with him, rather than against him. However, Hunan's \"Monroe Doctrine\" is still actively in effect, and it would require further talks with the Assembly to change that."

 HNN_peasant_support_strong_desc: "As rural infrastructure is improved and things get better in the average peasants day-to-day life, more and more of them have grown to support, or at least tolerate, our government. With the Kuomintang's biggest pillar of support removed, it's unlikely they can ever become a serious threat to Hunan's democracy ever again."

 HNN_bolstered_intellectual_hub: "Bolstered Intellectual Hub"
 HNN_bolstered_intellectual_hub_desc: "With the patronage of Governor Zhao Hengti, the already lively intelligentsia in Hunan has grown even stronger, it can be said that without a doubt Changsha is one of the best places for any Chinese intellectual to be."

 HNN_robust_academic_infrastructure_desc: "In the countryside many schools will be opening their doors for the first time this year. This, alongside our large intelligentsia, has lead to our province having some of the most robust academic infrastructure in China. The expansion of rural schools has also served to employ many of our local intellectuals, lessening the burden they put on our Governments budget."

 HNN_basic_welfare: "Basic Welfare"
 HNN_basic_welfare_desc: "As a part of our efforts against the Kuomintang, we have enacted a basic level welfare system, with unemployment benefits and social security. These reforms have reduced unrest in the unemployed and impoverished, making them far less likely to vote in autocratic populists."

 HNN_peace_with_the_unions: "Peace with the Unions"
 HNN_peace_with_the_unions_desc: "Our history with Unions, especially during our time in the League, has been difficult. But it seems those days have passed, with Union leaders reacting positively to Zhao's olive branch, a peace has been negotiated after some tense talks between our administration and the Union leaders. The hope being that this peace will be the foundation to better relations between the Government and the workers."

 HNN_bill_of_rights: "Bill of Rights"
 HNN_bill_of_rights_desc: "Now codified into Hunanese law, our very own Bill of Rights ensures that every citizen is given the expected rights to free speech, right of assembly, and more.

 HNN_legislative_debates: "Legislative Debates"
 HNN_legislative_debates_desc: "Within the Provincial Assembly the act of debating any Bill that lands on the Assembly floor is being pursued.

 HNN_democratic_traditions: "Democratic Traditions"
 HNN_democratic_traditions_desc: "While our democracy is still young, we have successfully laid down the foundations for strong democratic traditions in Hunan. With an established Bill of Rights and lively debates in the Provincial Assembly, Hunan's democracy is truly coming into it's own, and serves as an example for all provinces in China to follow."

 HNN_democratic_stronghold: "Democratic Stronghold"
 HNN_democratic_stronghold_desc: "Under Governor Zhao Hunan has become a shining beacon of democracy in China! With the anti-democratic resistance crushed, with an established a Bill of Rights, a strong academic system, and a flourishing local democracy. All of this while making peace with the unions and ensuring the support of the peasantry, serving to keep the anti-democratic forces in our province weak and divided. While the future may be turbulent, Hunan is a bright spot in a dark time."

##Kuomintang

 HNN_the_western_diarchy_3_desc: "The western part of Hunan has entered a state of siege and isolation following the Kuomintang's successful victory against both Tang Xiangming and Zhao Hengti. Ran akin to its own warlord province, the diarchy of Tian Yingzhao and Chen Quzhen oppose the Kuomintang's influence at every turn, formulating a campaign of borderline secession. West of them, the Old Guizhou clique under the auspices of Yuan Zuming has likewise locked down his section of Guizhou. Their inflamed efforts continue to cripple our governance."

 HNN_local_militias: "Local Militias"
 HNN_local_militias_desc: "Considered a principled part of Hunan's previous administrations, the local militias are a despotic group akin to local warlords, with the militia commanders being entirely under the control of local elites in some counties. Even worse, the quality of said militias ranges wildly between formations. If Hunan is to truly wrest itself free from the clutches of Beiyang, the militia issue will need to be handled."

 HNN_popular_support_desc: "The Kuomintang may have democratic and populist ideals, but it has a long way to go in terms of making those ideals into a reality. For the peasants and workers of Hunan, plenty of dreamers have come and gone with their utopian promises and few have delivered. If they wish to truly win over the hearts of the people, they must first save the hard-pressed commoners from their perennial strife.\n\nIt will take a long period of state building and careful policy implementation for the Hunanse people to see the Provincial Government as legitimate. In the meantime, plenty see the Kuomintang as hardly a step up from the warlord strongmen."

If they wish to truly win over the hearts of the people, they must first save the hard-pressed commoners from their perennial strife.\n\nNow with Tang Shengzhi's control of the province secured, Hunan's workers and peasantry will be able to reach their true potential. No more shall they be controlled, and traded by elites, autocrats and the gentry, seeking to extract profit from their misfortune.

For the peasants and workers of Hunan, plenty of dreamers have come and gone with their utopian promises and few have delivered. If they wish to truly win over the hearts of the people, they must first save the hard-pressed commoners from their perennial strife.\n\nWith Cheng Qian having steered the Province to moderation and salvation against the tides of violent revolution, Hunan's role in the nation's National Revolution is all but secured. Through the promulgation of local elections, and collaboration with independent republicans, the nation's future is bright, as long as Cheng Qian is within it."

 HNN_universal_education_efforts: "Universal Education Efforts"
 HNN_universal_education_efforts_desc: "Extracting a hefty price to pay, the ultimate goal of proliferating universal education amongst Hunan's poor and downtrodden is worth any sacrifices the provincial government has to endure. However, ideals and beliefs do not dissuade the effects on our governance."

 HNN_universal_education: "Universal Education"
 HNN_universal_education_desc: "Through our genius implementation of thorough education programmes, and the rapid expansion of schools throughout all stages of life, Hunan's education efforts have born a noticeable increase in literacy.

 HNN_centralising_militia_control: "Centralising Militia Control"
 HNN_centralising_militia_control_desc: "Despite some issues, the provincial government has made great strides in exorcising the rot of the resident militia system within the province. Through the extension of the authority of the Peace Preservation office, He Jian has managed to unify both local militia and household conscription militia under a unified bureau headed by the county magistrates, assisted by vice-heads. Whilst there remains some quirks, the militia are rapidly folding to the party's wishes."

 HNN_peace_preservation_corps: "Peace Preservation Corps"
 HNN_peace_preservation_corps_desc: "Not hesitating to exert his authority over the militia, He Jian has begun to impinge upon the lives of Hunan's people through his occupation of the Rural Pacification and Peace Preservation offices. Concerned with the tenacity and challenges raised by local bandits and Socialist activism, He has opted to consolidate all standing companies of the old militia into single \"Peace Preservation\" divisions. With newly professionalised training methods and organisation akin to regular army standards, Hunan shall be rigorously protected by its new force of local defenders."

 HNN_revolutionary_progress_corps: "Revolutionary Progress Corps"
 HNN_revolutionary_progress_corps_desc: "Originally the brainchild of Peace Preservation and Rural Pacification commander He Jian, Tang Shengzhi has managed to enact a series of policies to revolutionise and radicalise the \"Peace Preservation\" corps. Under the belief that He Jian seeked to use the divisions as his own loyal enforcers between both the Sixth and Eighth armies, Tang has introduced a series of political education programmes to function in tandem with the newly professionalised regimen that the militia follows Transforming the force from a tool of reactionaries, to a tool of the revolutionaries."

 HNN_a_reformed_administration: "A Reformed Administration"
 HNN_a_reformed_administration_desc: "Rife with decades of mismanagement, and corruption by warlords, local bullies and evil gentry, Hunan's provincial administration of the decade past was in dire need of reform.

 HNN_a_peoples_administration_desc: "Rife with decades of mismanagement, and corruption by warlords, local bullies and evil gentry, Hunan's provincial administration of the decade past was in dire need of reform.

 HNN_public_safety_bureau: "Public Safety Bureau"
 HNN_public_safety_bureau_desc: "Formed as a compromise between the competing Sixth and Eighth armies, the Public Safety Bureau was created by order of the Provincial Chairman in order to administer the party's line in matters of internal security, whilst also establishing a network of counter-intelligence and espionage to monitor and defend the national revolution from enemies within and outside."

 HNN_intellectual_safehaven: "Intellectual Safehaven"
 HNN_intellectual_safehaven_desc: "Fostered by the previous admirable efforts of Zhao Hengti, Hunan was transformed into one of the few places of intellectual freedom and safety within China. Furthering our cooperation with these intellectuals, with some sharing sympathies to the Kuomintang's ideals, has further bolstered Hunan's research capabilities. In culmination with a streamlining of their maintenance costs, Hunan is truly the cornucopia of science within the nation."

 HNN_assurances_of_dangguo: "Assurances of Dangguo"
 HNN_assurances_of_dangguo_desc: "Despite the honest circumstances and beliefs held by those within the now defunct provincial assembly, the bickering and constant opposition to their incumbent governor displayed quite brazenly the need for a vanguard party capable of guiding Hunan's populace towards the democratic ideal. A core tenet of Kuomintang ideology, the institution of Dangguo, or the Party State, is necessary to see the National Revolution to its conclusion."

 HNN_nationalist_youth_organisations: "Nationalist Youth Organisations"
 HNN_nationalist_youth_organisations_desc: "Dr. Sun believed that it would also be the youths who must participate in the national revolution. The youth are the foundation of a revolutionary future and the spirit of the Chinese National Revolution as well as Chinese Nationalism must persist to the next generations if China is to be strong. For China's weaknesses lie in her lack of unity and if we disregard the youth - we will not prepare them for the revolutionary struggle in the future. Let us reach out to the youths via nationalist organisations and to encourage membership for both boys and girls, to learn and carry on Dr. Sun's Three Principles' of the People."

 HNN_scientific_advancement: "Scientific Advancement"
 HNN_scientific_advancement_desc: "Only through the resolute belief in scientific advancement can China experience its salvation. As concluded by the Kuomintang's greatest philosophers, the elite scientific class must bring forth enlightenment to the producing classes, and with such a belief, the government has invested in a renewed scientific effort to advance the Chinese people."

 HNN_belief_in_minsheng: "Belief in Minsheng"
 HNN_belief_in_minsheng_desc: "Lacking any concrete infrastructure to be able to provide the principle of Minsheng towards the populace, the government enacted a series of infrastructure investments and expansion of highways alongside railways to provide the foundation for our social welfare services. Having revolutionised the healthcare systems of old China, Hunan is witnessing an increase in the standard of living for all of its citizens."

 HNN_expanded_social_services: "Expanded Social Services"
 HNN_expanded_social_services_desc: "In line with the Kuomintang's thorough belief in pursuing modernity, the Sixth Army has endeavoured to expand Hunan's provincial capacity to provide for its populace. With the assistance of the advisory committee implemented by He Jian, Hunan's citizenry and its role in the National Revolution is resolutely secured. Perhaps not as radical as those within the Eighth Army would desire, it has prevented perhaps an interregnum of chaos should they have their way."

 HNN_supporting_unions: "Supporting Unions"
 HNN_supporting_unions_desc: "Following the belief of the Central Committee's United Front, the Hunanese Provincial Government has opted to engage in a policy of open support with the Changsha unions, strengthening the Kuomintang bonds with the local Chinese Syndicalist Party branch.

Learning under the curriculum of Superintendent Tang Shengzhi, the young cadres will be enveloped in a space of avid learning, and tutoring in Dr. Sun's Three Principles. Similar to Whampoa, it hopes to train a new generation of revolutionaries to wage the war of the National Revolution.

 HNN_cooperation_with_the_CSP_desc: "The moderates within the Sixth Army, and the broader Right Kuomintang as a whole, split from the Left over one singular issue: the United Front with the Chinese Syndicalist Party. Disavowing any sense of revolutionary brotherhood, the Right parade their interpretation of the Three Principles as the most orthodox, not sullied by that of socialist misgivings or class struggle. Yet they refuse to see the many benefits brought forth by cooperation between our sister parties. Let us display, proudly to the world, the revolutionary unity of the KMT and CSP. For a brighter future for all, be they worker or peasant!"

 HNN_KR_gathering_storm_desc: "Flanked by militarists on all sides, Zhao Hengti must tread lightly if he is to maintain Hunan's hard fought peace. A federalist bastion, Zhao dreams of a free China steeped in the principles of provincial autonomy and democracy. However, threats both internal and external pose a challenge to Zhao's Federalist agenda.\nNationalist forces under Cheng Qian and Tang Shengzhi lurk just beyond Hunan's borders ready to pounce, and Admiral Tang Xiangming will ensure that Zhili influence remains in the province. Can Zhao defend Hunan's democracy, or will the province fall to the Party-State and militarist forces?"

 HNN_country_intro_content: "One of the first Provinces to join the §lXinhai Revolution§! under Governor §RJiao Dafeng§!, Hunan has had a turbulent history over the years. With §RJiao§! dying in battle during the §lXinhai Revolution§!, he was succeeded by §cTan Yankai§! in 1911. §cTan's§! tenure only lasted for two years, however, due to remaining neutral in the conflict between §PYuan Shikai§! and §gSun Yat-sen§!, which led to §PYuan dismissing§! §cTan§! and subsequently replacing him with §PTang Xiangming§!.\n\n §PTang's§! Governorship lasted from 1913 up until 1916, with Yunnan Governor §gTang Jiyao§! declaring independence in the wake of §PYuan's§! assumption of the Imperial Throne as §cHongxian Emperor§!. Like a cascade of dominoes, province after province began to follow suit, aligning with Yunnan and declaring independence, and soon enough..."

 HNN_country_intro_header_1: "Turbulent Times"
 HNN_country_intro_content_1: "...Hunan found itself under siege, with local warlord §PTian Yingzhao§! declaring for the NPA being the straw that crushed the camel's back, Admiral §PTang Xiangming§! fled Hunan by boat in the chaos, sailing up the Yangtze. In August, Central Government Premier §PDuan Qirui§! appointed §cTan Yankai§! as Provincial Governor yet again. This Governorship didn't last long either, and after a brief stint by §gCheng Qian§!, §PFu Liangzuo§! and §gZhou Zhaoxiang§!, §PDuan Qirui§! appointed §nZhang Jingyao§! as Governor.\n\nThe infamous \"Butcher of Hunan\" had a regime soaked in blood. Banditry and looting was practically official government policy, with mass unrest raging all throughout the province. The insanity led to §nZhang§! being ousted only two years later when §cTan Yankai§! and his subordinate, §cZhao Hengti§!, joined forces and expelled the Butcher from their Province. Unfortunately for §cTan§!, and much like his previous Governorships, he didn't remain Governor for long.\n\nAs pressure from Federalist intellectuals mounted, §cTan§! hesitated in the creation of an official constitution, and everything culminated with the mutiny of Pingjiang garrison commander §gYu Yingxiang§!, who was loyal to §gCheng Qian§!. With Army Director-General §cZhao Hengti§! refusing to assist the Governor, §cTan Yankai§! bowed out and granted the Governorship to §cZhao§! himself."

 HNN_country_intro_header_2: "A Decade under §cZhao§!"
 HNN_country_intro_content_2: "With §cZhao Hengti§! becoming the new Governor of Hunan, he immediately proceeded to invite China's best and brightest minds to draft a constitution worthy of Hunan and his Federalist ideals. On January 1st, 1922, §cZhao Hengti§! officially promulgated the \"Hunan Provincial Constitution\", and became the first democratically elected Governor that September.\n\nBetween his civilian reforms, §cZhao Hengti§! protected Jade Marshal §PWu Peifu§! in 1925 after §gFeng Yuxiang§! betrayed him, a favour §PWu§! would repay soon enough. In mid 1926, his two subordinates, §STang Shengzhi§! and §cYe Kaixin§!, had a dispute that §cZhao§! mediated in favour of §cYe§!. Believing the Governor was showing favouritism, §STang Shengzhi§! mutinied and joined the §RKuomintang§! in Guangzhou, kickstarting the Northern Expedition.\n\nThis would lead to §cZhao's§! forces being utterly routed, and kicked out of Hunan. However with §cYe Kaixin's§! assistance, the Federalists asked §PWu Peifu§! for help in retaking the Province. After §PWu Peifu's§! triumph against the Kuomintang, he appointed §cZhao§! as Governor of Hunan. But with §PWu's§! attention being forced back North due to the Fourth Zhifeng War, and §cZhao§! under ostensible military threat from the remaining §RKuomintang§! holdouts in Guizhou and across his province, Zhao was placed in a tense situation.\n\nRegretfully finding it necessary, Zhao petitioned Smiling Tiger §PSun Chuanfang§! to accede to his League of Eight Provinces, despite mutual personal distaste for the concessions. Sceptical of §cZhao's§! true allegiances however, Wu has \"granted\" the Hunan Provincial Government a direct attaché to the Zhili clique, in the form of Yueyang Garrison Commander §PTang Xiangming§!, returning to Hunan after a decade.\n\nAs the Year of the Rat dawns, Hunan has been stable through §cZhao's§! guiding hand at the wheel, however with the Zhili guillotine waiting to strike, alongside the presence of the §PDiarchy§! and §nOld Guizhou Clique§!, the times ahead are certain to be tough..."

 hnn.1.t: "Hunan Breaks from the League"
 hnn.1.d: "With Sun Chuanfang's death, Hunan, one of the already autonomous provinces of the League of Eight Provinces, has regained full provincial autonomy under Zhao Hengti once again. The times ahead are turbulent ones, with the violence in the MinGan region likely to spill over into our own province, we must keep an eye to the east. Our other eye, as it turns out, must keep watch on the western border with Yunnan. While Tang Jiyao is a fellow Federalist, his willingness to let the RKMT squat in western Guizhou has soured relations, and functions as another source of violence that could bleed into our province.\n\nLuckily for us, our north and south are safer fronts. To the south is a friend, the Liangguang Clique, led by Chen Jiongming. Both Chen and Zhao are forebearers of the Federalist movement, some of the only Democratically elected leaders of China. And to our north is another friend, Wu Peifu and his Government in Beijing. Zhao has personal animosity with Tang Xiangming, the Zhili's garrison commander in Yueyang, for arresting him and throwing him in prison back in 1913. Despite this he is still personal friends with Wu Peifu, and the two have known each other for over a decade, meaning the Zhili clique can be counted upon as one of our allies in China."
 hnn.1.a: "A careful balancing act..."

 hnn.2.t: "Restoration of the Hunan Provincial Constitution"
 hnn.2.d: "Zhao Hengti, the governor, came to power in the 1920s on the back of the Federalist movement, his first actions in power were to gather intellectuals from across China to write Hunan's Constitution, one that has sadly not been able to be restored while under the Zhili. With the League collapse and the chaos 1936 has brought to China however, Governor Zhao finally has the opportunity to restore the Constitution he helped create over a decade ago.\n\nWhile others, even other Federalists, warn against creating a Provincial Constitution without a central Federal Government to back it up, Governor Zhao believes that Federalism must occur at the provincial level first, that each province must overthrow their warlords and create their own Provincial Constitutions and build up democracy in their provinces. Only then will a confederation of provinces be able to form a central government and the Federalist movement will stand triumphant.\n\nWith that ideal in mind, Zhao formally announced that Hunan's Provincial Constitution was restored as of today!"
 hnn.2.a: "An important step to the future!"

#Election Events

 hnn.election.1.t: "Elections Announced"
 hnn.election.1.d: "With the restoration of the Hunan Provincial Constitution, the flame of democracy flickers yet again in the crossroads of China. Zhao gave a speech today in front of the Governor's office in Changsha, stating that elections will be held in three months time, and announcing his own candidacy for the race under the banner of his People's Renewal Society. Importantly, the Governor of Hunan is not directly elected, but rather follows a Parliamentary system, with voters electing their constituents and those Assemblymen voting for the Governor, any candidate requiring a majority to win the Governorship. It wasn't long before two more candidates announced their races. Zhao's major opponent in the race will be Huang Yanpei of the China National Democratic Construction Association. The third candidate, and the dark horse of the race, is political independent Zhou Shizhao. While not having a party of his own, he holds notable sway with some of the most leftwing members of the Assembly, fellow political independents. Finally, there is Tan Yankai, a man with a foot in both the Federalist and Kuomintang movements, he has announced he will run against Zhao, and may serve to undercut Zhao's base of support.\n\nWhile Zhao is the clear favourite to win, all three men will put their all into their campaigns, and Hunan shall have a truly democratic election in the coming months, an example for the rest of China to follow!"
 hnn.election.1.a: "To Hunan's young democracy!"

 hnn.election.2.t: "Tang Shengzhi Leaves for Hunan"
 hnn.election.2.d: "General Tang Shengzhi, famed Commander of the 8th Army in the Northern Expedition, and fellow fighter on the ground in MinGan, has reportedly provided his fellow Generals Deng Yanda, and Li Jishen, rather short notice in his desire to contest the recently announced Hunan Provincial Elections. Amidst the chaos of the fighting in the League War, many commanders within the insurgency zone have expressed vivid anger at the rogue General suddenly departing, accusing him and his loyalists of possibly sacrificing the very survival of the Kuomintang for a chance at attaining power in Hunan.\n\nTry as they might however, Tang and his 8th Army remnants have already scattered from their command posts, and are likely crossing the provincial border at this very moment, and so alas their cries of condemnation are to no avail. Whilst his gambit could likely end in failure, the rogue General could possibly secure the whole of Hunan province for the National Revolution. Only time will tell."
 hnn.election.2.a: "At the very least, good luck."

 hnn.election.3.t: "Tang Shengzhi Arrives in Hunan"
 hnn.election.3.d1: "Troubling news has reached the Governor's Office in Changsha. Amidst the chaos of the League War, and the Kuomintang uprisings within Fujian province, exiled Kuomintang Governor of Hunan and MinGan insurgent Tang Shengzhi, has reportedly crossed the provincial border. Flanked by his subordinates He Long, Peng Dehuai, and with a small detachment of what remains of his 8th Army, the general appears to have positioned himself to challenge incumbent Zhao Hengti in the recently announced elections.\n\nHaving previously been a subordinate of Zhao, and deposing him before being removed himself on the eve of the Northern Expedition, Tang Shengzhi has always desired the governorship of his native Hunan — even during his time in the Insurgency Zone. With his connections to the peasantry and leftists throughout the province, he has proven himself to be a serious contender in the national election, shaking up what was believed to be a guaranteed Zhao victory."
 hnn.election.3.d2: "Troubling news has reached the Governor's Office in Changsha. Amidst the chaos of the League War, and the failed Kuomintang uprisings within Fujian province, exiled Kuomintang Governor of Hunan and MinGan insurgent Tang Shengzhi, has reportedly crossed the provincial border, fleeing the devastation wrought on his comrades. Flanked by his subordinates He Long, Peng Dehuai, and with a small detachment of what remains of his 8th Army, the general appears to have positioned himself in a desperate challenge to incumbent Zhao Hengti in the elections.\n\nHaving previously been a subordinate of Zhao, and deposing him before being removed himself on the eve of the Northern Expedition, Tang Shengzhi has always desired the governorship of his native Hunan — even during his time in the Insurgency Zone. With his connections to the peasantry and leftists throughout the province, he has proven himself to be a serious contender in the national election — with or without Kuomintang assistance.\n\nWhilst he may very well be the last, desperate clutch for life of the Kuomintang, he has still ruined what was perceived to be a guaranteed Zhao victory."
 hnn.election.3.a: "One Tang was already enough..."

 hnn.election.4.t: "Cheng Qian Invades Through Guizhou!"
 hnn.election.4.d: "Another startling upset has found itself within the Hunan Provincial Governor Election. Whilst MinGan was a hotbed of Kuomintang sentiment, it had always taken on a uniquely leftist spin within the broader political sphere. As the Northern Expedition collapsed however, those who opposed the collaboration with the Chinese Syndicalist Party largely fled to Guizhou province — now split between the cliques of Hunan and Yunnan — remaining nominally under the protection of Yunnan Governor Tang Jiyao.\n\nWhilst Tang Jiyao is certainly not a member of the Kuomintang, the existence of the \"Right\" Kuomintang within Guizhou was frequently used as a bargaining chip against perceived Zhili encroachment, even at the expense of Tang's own Federalist brotherhood with Zhao Hengti.\n\nOne of the critical leaders within RKMT Guizhou, Cheng Qian, is a Hunanese native and was commander of the National Revolutionary Army's 6th Army during the Northern Expedition. In what appears to be an uncoordinated advance with his fellow party member Tang Shengzhi, the General has circumvented Yuan Zuming, and thrown his hat into the election."
 hnn.election.4.a: "This is getting out of hand, now there are two of them!"

 hnn.election.5.t: "The Campaign Begins in Hengyang"
 hnn.election.5.d: "Two days ago, Governor Zhao Hengti returned to his home city of Hengyang, in the hopes that he would convince the people from his hometown to vote for him. He visited his family along with old childhood friends, and made multiple speeches around the city, gathering the attention of many people. Despite appearances from both Cheng Qian and Tang Shengzhi, Zhao easily drew the largest crowds with his impassioned speeches, his campaigning in Hengyang ending with a triumph.\n\nZhao's popularity, naturally, poses a threat to both men in the Kuomintang. With neither seemingly able to beat Zhao alone, they have met in Hengyang after their speeches, and made discussions of a \"United Front\" between their different factions. While the two men are not friends, they'd rather see a fellow Kuomintang Comrade win the Governorship than the Federalist Zhao."
 hnn.election.5.a: "Zhao Hengti shall continue Hunan's democratic legacy!"
 hnn.election.5.b: "The Kuomintang shall bring the National Revolution to Hunan!"

 hnn.election.6.t: "Who Leads the United Front?"
 hnn.election.6.d: "With Cheng Qian and Tang Shengzhi agreeing on a United Front, an immediate question cropped up of who exactly should lead the United Front?\n\nOn one hand, you have Tang Shengzhi, aligned with the left wing of the party, his peasant focus and cooperation with the CSP makes him a naturally popular candidate, given Hunan's rural and agrarian nature. The concern however, is his status as a party outsider, a warlord and opportunist turned Kuomintang member, may serve to splinter the unity of the party when it needs to be most united.\n\nOn the other hand, you have Cheng Qian, a party insider who values unity and comradare of the Party greatly, and could easily serve as a moderate and unifying figure for the election. A member of the old guard, he's well known for his stubborn nature, and while not the best commander ever, still has a decent record behind him. The concern is that he may not bring as much to the table as his more radical counterpart.\n\nBoth men have advantages and disadvantages to being the leader of this United Front, but we can only pick one of them to take charge, who shall it be?"
 hnn.election.6.a: "Party Unity is paramount, Cheng shall lead the front"
 hnn.election.6.b: "We need a radical firebrand, give Tang the reigns"

 hnn.election.7.t: "A Deal With the Devil?"
 hnn.election.7.d: "The sudden appearance of Cheng Qian and Tang Shengzhi has put Governor Zhao in a tough spot. Well aware of the Authoritarian and Vanguardist tendencies of the Kuomintang, he worries that if they win this election for Governor Hunan's young democracy may be snuffed out. Wanting to avoid this at all costs, he has been pacing in his office mulling over one of his less... honourable options to winning the election. The Provincial Assembly is famously corrupt, and the Governor lacks the power to move against the corruption, despite his best attempts nothing seems to lessen it. These corrupt Assemblymen may not care for Hunan's democracy, but they don't hold any loyalty to the Kuomintang...\n\nIt would certainly be possible to find common ground with them, and gain their support in the upcoming election, provided Zhao was willing to... turn a blind eye to their corruption, both during and after the election. It would be regrettable to aid and abet corruption like this, but when push comes to shove, bending the rules is better than breaking them."
 hnn.election.7.a: "I am a man of principle!"
 hnn.election.7.b: "It's unfortunate, but needs must."

 hnn.election.8.t: "Unrest Amongst the Far Left"
 hnn.election.8.d: "Ever since Tang Shengzhi's arrival through the east, socialist unrest in Hunan has increased dramatically. On the border with Jiangxi socialist militia's have been harassing members of Zhao's Government, violence breaking out frequently and order breaking down. At the same time the cities of Changsha and Changde have had increased action by union workers and the Chinese Syndicalist Party, protests breaking out in both cities as the Kuomintang stoke the flames of unrest.\n\nTang Shengzhi has capitalised on this, speaking at length at how this unrest is a natural evolution of Zhao's failures to take care of Hunan's workers, and that under the Kuomintang every worker would be given their dues.\n\nZhao quickly countered Tang's claims, pointing out that it was Tang Shengzhi and the Kuomintang who has fanned the flames of this unrest, actively encouraged the violence on the border, and now is trying to promise that they'll be the ones to solve the problem they themselves caused."
 hnn.election.8.a: "Tang reaches out to the Socialist cause"
 hnn.election.8.b: "The violence frightens people to flock to Zhao's banner."

 hnn.election.9.t: "Tan Yankai's Choice"
 hnn.election.9.d: "Within Changsha, there's the former Governor of Hunan, and former member of the Kuomintang, in Tan Yankai. When the Northern Expedition collapsed Zhao offered him amnesty, on account of their old friendship, and safety from the reprisals from Beijing and Nanjing. With the recent elections being announced, he decided to run against Zhao for Governor, mainly soaking up seats in Changsha and among the Gentry, undercutting some of Zhao's own support base.\n\nThe question on his mind today is that, with the Kuomintang United Front between Tang Shengzhi and Cheng Qian, does he fold under the Kuomintang's banner or continue his campaign as an independent? While a leader during the Northern Expedition and member of the Kuomintang, he dislikes both Tang and Cheng on a personal level. Furthermore his main base of support is within the Gentry, so tying his name to the Socialist violence in Changsha and the east would be a dangerous move for him to make."
 hnn.election.9.a: "Run as an independent."
 hnn.election.9.b: "Run under the KMT banner."

 hnn.election.10.t: "Campaign in Changsha"
 hnn.election.10.d: "Changsha has grown greatly in recent years, spurred by economic change and the beginnings of industrialisation. With Tan Yankai splitting the gentry away from Zhao, he is instead banking on his support among the intellectuals in Changsha. The middle class, for their part, have grown distant from his administration, starting to look towards Cheng Qian and his promises instead. Both men are trying to court the city and swing votes in it to their side, with Zhao appealing to the intellectuals and to defending the work he has already done for Changsha and Hunan, meanwhile Cheng has been talking to the middle class in Changsha, speaking of reforming the system to benefit them, and encourage more development in the city if they vote for him. Tang Shengzhi is notably absent, his rural focused campaigns unable to gain enough traction in Changsha, so he has chosen to support Cheng in the city. Both men have a solid shot at swinging the city in their favour, but who's rhetoric will win over the most voters?"
 hnn.election.10.a: "Zhao's popularity among the intelligentsia give him the city!"
 hnn.election.10.b: "Cheng's promises of reform earn him the support of the middle class!"

 hnn.election.11.t: "The Minor Liberal Parties"
 hnn.election.11.d: "With the Kuomintang sweeping support with their populist rhetoric, the liberals running for Governor, Huang Yanpei and Zhou Shizhao, have an important choice to make. Neither of them wish to see the light of democracy in Hunan get snuffed out, as seems likely if the Kuomintang achieve victory. As such they have considered the option of dropping out as contenders for the Governorship, and formally endorsing Zhao, folding under his banner in order to create a \"democratic front\" against the Kuomintang. On the other hand, they can always continue their bids for Governor, trying to carve out their own niche in the Assembly, and discuss negotiations with Zhao after the post-election Assembly forms. Both options have their merits, but what strategy shall they go with?"
 hnn.election.11.a: "Fold under the Federalist Banner."
 hnn.election.11.b: "Continue running their candidates."

 hnn.election.12.t: "The Yueyang Garrison"
 hnn.election.12.d: "On the border with Hubei lies the city of Yueyang, and important chokepoint between our Province and the northern Government. This city is presently run as Tang Xiangming's personal fiefdom, with his brother, Tang Hualong, as the city's mayor. Neither man is a friend of Zhao's, Tang Xiangming even arrested Zhao in 1913 on Yuan Shikai's behalf, and threw him in a Beijing Prison. Despite this both men do have sympathies with the Zhili clique, and there's been an uneasy truce between them, although it's been particularly fraught with the League Collapse.\n\nThe Tang brothers have met today in Yueyang to discuss their strategy with the upcoming election. Tang Hualong, fearing a Kuomintang victory, has suggested Tang Xiangming make a truce with Zhao for now and focus efforts on blocking the Kuomintang from seizing power in Hunan. Tang Xiangming, not truly believing the Kuomintang can succeed in the election, disagrees with his brother, and states that they must minimise Zhao's success, lest the Federalist gets a big head from his victory in Hunan."
 hnn.election.12.a: "Tang Xiangming is right, keep Zhao contained"
 hnn.election.12.b: "Tang Hualong has a point, the KMT are the greater threat"

 hnn.election.13.t: "Clashes Between Classes"
 hnn.election.13.d: "Podiums and campaigns aren't the only battlegrounds during this election. With the Kuomintang's appearance and fiery rhetoric directed at the peasantry, there has been a massive wave of unrest, directed right at the upper class, the landed Gentry. With one member of the Gentry even being attacked by a number of peasants, who were subsequently arrested for assault.\n\nWith this violence seemingly escalating in nature, Zhao has met with many prominent members of the Gentry, listening to their concerns and trying to calm their fears, and humbly asking for their support in the coming election, that he would be able to solve the problems plaguing them.\n\nTang, on the other hand, has given yet another speech to the peasantry, saying that their political ascension is nigh, and that as long as they keep pushing forth and fighting they will win everything they desire.\n\nCheng, ever the moderate, has been significantly calmer than Tang. Speaking positively of the peasantry's actions, he still emphasises the need for compromise, that everyone involved is a citizen of Hunan and of China, and that together they could build a brighter future for everybody."
 hnn.election.13.a: "Zhao calms the Gentry's fears."
 hnn.election.13.b: "Tang fans the flames of peasant unrest."
 hnn.election.13.c: "Cheng does his best to mediate between all parties."

 hnn.election.14.t: "The Xiangxi Diarchy"
 hnn.election.14.d: "In the west of Hunan lies the Xiangxi Diarchy between Tian Yingzhao and Chen Quzhen, warlords in their own right, they've spent the last decade or so within Zhao Hengti's clique. Although within recent years Tang Xiangming has made more concerted efforts to sway the two to his own sphere of influence. While Tian joining the Constitutional Protection Alliance did lead to Tang Xiangming's resignation as Governor, relations between the two have healed since then.\n\nWith the popularity of the Kuomintang in the election, and their clear rhetoric pointed at \"Hunan's western warlords\" and the need to remove them, the Diarchy is naturally worried about the results of this election. They have two options clearly open to them, either they can throw their own electoral bloc and resources towards securing a victory for Zhao. Or they could instead respond to Tang Xiangming's overtures, and form an \"Anti-KMT alliance\" in case the wrong person wins this upcoming election."
 hnn.election.14.a: "Tang Xiangming will keep order."
 hnn.election.14.b: "Zhao's victory will keep them at bay."

 hnn.election.15.t: "Campaign in the Countryside"
 hnn.election.15.d: "Governor Zhao's support, historically speaking, has mainly come from the urban cities. This election cycle is no different, with large scale apathy among the peasantry towards Zhao's Administration, he is functionally unable to win over the majority of their votes. The Kuomintang's two candidates however, are a different story. Tang Shengzhi has a particular focus towards the peasantry, and has been making broad promises of land reform and support for peasant organisations. Cheng Qian, while still promising similar efforts of land reform, doesn't go quite as far as his leftist counterpart. However, if he redoubles his efforts and pushes for rural campaigns he may be able to take rural seats from Tang, and secure them for himself."
 hnn.election.15.a: "Tang's rhetoric ensures the support of the peasantry!"
 hnn.election.15.b: "Cheng narrowly gains a plurality of support!"

 hnn.election.16.t: "Changsha and Guizhou"
 hnn.election.16.d: "West of Hunan lies Guizhou, and with it the leader of the Old Guizhou Clique, Yuan Zuming. While technically a Governor in his own right, and recognised by the Zhili as such, he lacks the strength to stand on his own, and as such he has to rely on the Government in Changsha. While Zhao and Yuan don't agree on much, both have sympathies with the Zhili, and have decided it's best for both if they work together. With Cheng Qian making it past Yuan and through Guizhou, and Zhao focusing on the election, their alliance has begun to become more tenuous as of late. Zhao has been debating on if he should pull some of the funding going to Guizhou and instead focus on improving his odds of reelection in these final days, at the cost of angering his ally in the west. At the same time, Cheng has been speaking heavily on Yuan and his \"Autocratic Regime\" in Guizhou, that he will not stand for it any longer, and that if the Kuomintang is elected they will no longer support Yuan's regime."
 hnn.election.16.a: "Cheng Qian's anti-Yuan position proves popular!"
 hnn.election.16.b: "Zhao undercuts support to focus on the KMT and the Election."

 hnn.election.17.t: "Election Results are in!"
 hnn.election.17.d: "The votes have been counted, and Hunan's Provincial Election is coming to a close. All candidates involved have given it their all, but it's clear to everyone that the People's Renewal Society and the Kuomintang are the frontrunners. Going in it was unclear which of the two would be the winner in the election, while Zhao started as the clear favourite to win, Cheng and Tang's united front shook up the race in an unexpected way, with them gaining a lot of ground and serving as strong rivals for Zhao. All that's left now is for the results to be announced, the future of Hunan rests on this result, and we await the winner with bated breath..."
 hnn.election.17.a: "The winner of the 1936 election is..."

#Tang Xiangming Events

 hnn.zhili.1.t: "The March on Changsha"
 hnn.zhili.1.d.qing: "With our recent victory in the election, the Zhili forces occupying Yueyang, led by Tang Xiangming, have descended by rail and arrived in Changsha within hours. While we could likely take his forces, currently north of Changsha, on their own, we managed to secure a report that said Beijing was sending reinforcements. Cheng Qian and Tang Shengzhi decided to dig in and try and hold Changsha. Unfortunately Tang Xiangming's reinforcements have moved in, reinforcing the north and creating a second front on the east, pincering the city and our forces, our prospect look dire indeed..."
 hnn.zhili.1.d.zhao: "With our failures to contain the lingering Kuomintang remnants across Hunan, Yueyang Garrison leader Tang Xiangming has declared our Government to be incapable of \"Protecting the steadfast and loyal citizens of the Hunan Province\" and has vowed he would March on Changsha to \"Install a Government truly dedicated to the safety and security of all of Hunan\". He quickly made good on this promise, using the rail line to bring his army down from Yueyang in a matter of hours, with our forces still tied down across Hunan, trying to crush the insurgents in our province, we were unable to rally a formidable counter assault, Tang Xiangming's victory appears to be certain..."
 hnn.zhili.1.d: "With our recent victory in the election, the Zhili forces occupying Yueyang, led by Tang Xiangming, have descended by rail and arrived in Changsha within hours. Luckily for us, he seems to only have his garrison, with no extra reinforcements to speak of. Seeing an opportunity, Tang Shengzhi quickly moved out with his Eighth Army, and met the force outside Changsha. Cheng Qian only learned of this after the fact, quickly bringing his Sixth Army out to reinforce Tang... oddly enough however, Hunan's Provincial Army seems to still be in Changsha, not moving to reinforce their Governor."
 hnn.zhili.1.a: "Tang Xiangming seizes Changsha!"
 hnn.zhili.1.b: "The Kuomintang stand triumphant!"

 hnn.zhili.2.t: "A New Man in Changsha"
 hnn.zhili.2.d: "Tang Xiangming walked down the streets of Changsha, his forces still stationed on nearly every street corner. It had been a long time since he could call himself Governor of Hunan, he had last occupied that position in 1916, two decades ago now. His control over the province was not absolute yet, the previous Governor's forces retreating quickly to the countryside, insurgents loyal to the Kuomintang raiding and striking at any of his own troops. He walked into the Governor's office, and officially signed the order for his troops to move out. Governor Tang Xiangming would ensure absolute control of Hunan by any means necessary."
 hnn.zhili.2.a: "Now to take the rest."

 hnn.zhili.3.t: "Governor [ROOT.GetLeader] Victorious"
 hnn.zhili.3.d: "Despite catching the Kuomintang United Front by surprise, Tang Xiangming's forces were immediately met by the best and brightest of the National Revolutionary Army's 8th and 6th armies. Having directed his forces directly down the rail line towards Changsha, the admiral was met by the rapidly deployed forces of Song Xilian, who engaged him in gruelling combat.\n\nWith the spearhead blunted, the rest of the 6th and 8th armies were able to rapidly join in the fighting. Following clever manoeuvres by He Jian, his division managed to flank the Zhili forces and attack Tang's weaker columns in conjunction with actions by He Long and Peng Dehuai, who managed to completely encircle the Zhili troops. Ultimately ending in the surrender of the warlord forces, the engagement bolstered the morale of the Kuomintang's forces and propelled the concept that the United Front may be one to last.\n\nAll throughout the nation, the news of the Zhili rout in Hunan has received acclamation from many, including those of the radical revolutionaries in the Central Committee, the Rightist KMT remnant in Guizhou, and most curiously, from the likes of [YUN.GetLeader] and [FNG.GetLeader]. Nonetheless, the fleeing \"Butcher of Hunan\" managed to flee capture, having broken out of the encirclement with a company of his elite troops, and has reportedly crossed into friendly territory."
 hnn.zhili.3.a: "Hopefully the last we see of him."

 hnn.zhili.4.t: "Restoring Order in Hunan"
 hnn.zhili.4.d: "While nominally the new Governor of Hunan, our control over the province was limited to the northeast. That was until recently, our troops swept south and west, crushing any Kuomintang or Federalist loyalists they found. One by one the cities of Hengyang, Chenzhou, and Shaoyang fell under our grip. Governor Tang Xiangming himself moved out west, meeting with Chen Quzhen of the Xiangxi Diarchy, and ensuring that they wouldn't cause problems for our Governor. With the Diarchy submitting to our rule, the Province of Hunan is firmly in our grasp."
 hnn.zhili.4.a: "All under the Governor."

 hnn.zhili.5.t: "Securing Eastern Guizhou"
 hnn.zhili.5.d: "With Hunan secured, Tang moved his sights to Eastern Guizhou, under the Zhili aligned Yuan Zuming. Keeping his army in western Hunan just in case, the two Governor's met for talks. Negotiations were brief, all things considered, as Tang Xiangming promised to uphold the relationship Yuan enjoyed with the past administration, and Yuan stated any Kuomintang remnants left in his own province would be treated like the traitors they were. Certain topics, such as Guizhou's division and the Yunnan clique, did not come up, but were scheduled to be discussed at a future date."
 hnn.zhili.5.a: "It's good that he can see reason."

 hnn.zhili.6.t: "The Defence Commission"
 hnn.zhili.6.d: "Given the threats Hunan faces, the insurgents of the Kuomintang still lurking in our midsts, the nearby powers eyeing our lands hungrily, it has become necessarily for Governor Tang to establish the \"Commission for the Defence of the Hunan Province\". An extra-judicial body that grants the Governor sweeping Executive powers in matters related to the defence of the Province. What this means in practice is that Governor Tang has greater ability to defend Hunan from the threats all around it. It may seem like an undue lurch towards Authoritarianism, but it is necessary for the safety and security of every loyal Hunanese citizen."
 hnn.zhili.6.a: "For a safe and secure society."

 hnn.zhili.7.t: "Eliminating the KMT"
 hnn.zhili.7.d: "Under Zhao Hengti the Kuomintang has been allowed to exist uninhibited, grow and spread across Hunan like a sickness. In the name of democracy Zhao refused to move against them during his election, allowing the wound they've created in Hunan to fester and grow infected. Luckily for Hunan, [HNN_tang_xiangming_title] Tang is more than willing to root out the cause of this pain, and to finally eradicate this infection from our province.\n\nHis action was swift and decisive, Kuomintang insurgents still willing to attack were crushed by our armies, thrown in prison or given swift justice. Quickly growing a culture of fear against the self proclaimed \"Revolutionaries\", many threw down their weapons and went into hiding, either within our Province, or by fleeing from it.\n\nOne unexpected side effect of the [HNN_tang_xiangming_title]'s efforts is the circle of figures, primarily those in the Gentry who fear what the Kuomintang would do to them if they took power, have begun to form a political circle around [HNN_tang_xiangming_title] Tang. Many of these men are currently in the Assembly, or have many in the Assembly on their payroll. During a large meeting with them in Changsha, and after relatively quick discussion with many of the most esteemed members of the elite, these men agreed to form the \"Harmony Association\", taking the same name as the organisation in Beijing, with Tang Xiangming at it's head. With this development [HNN_tang_xiangming_title] Tang's control over the Assembly has grown even deeper than before, and he's beginning to find that more civilian figures are willing to support his regime."
 hnn.zhili.7.a: "Let's hope they stay down this time."

 hnn.zhili.8.t: "A Gamble for the Coast"
 hnn.zhili.8.d: "Governor Tang Xiangming is, and always has been, a man of the sea. Originally an Admiral far before he was a General, it is more than apparent to him the irony of him being Governor of a landlocked province. To rectify this fact, he has put together are plan to strike south, at Guangxi and Guangdong, and seize the port city of Guangzhou. While he feels confident in his own plan, he will need to justify it to Zhili leadership and get them on board with the plan. To this end he has created a petition that he will send to [HNN_zhili_home_base], and with hope they will see reason and allow him to make his march south, and secure Liangguang for the Zhili clique... and for himself."
 hnn.zhili.8.a: "Send the Petition."

 hnn.zhili.9.t: "A Petition from Changsha"
 hnn.zhili.9.d: "[HNN_a_petition_from_changsha_loc_desc]"
 HNN_a_petition_from_changsha_loc_desc_qie_gxc: "A petition has come to us from Changsha today. The new Governor there, Tang Xiangming, has suggested that he moves against the regime in Liangguang. A swift strike south when they're still recovering from war could serve to give us the traditionally turbulent twin provinces, which would certainly be a welcomed change from their usually hostile attitude towards our Government. In fact one of our own Admirals, Sa Zhenbing, has spoken out in favour of his former subordinate, stating that he trusts their judgement, and that this is a great opportunity to secure the Southern Coast. The risk, however, is that bringing our army south in assistance with Tang Xiangming may leave us open to other threats in China, chief of all being the Fengtian Clique in the Northeast..\n\nWhat shall we do? Do we accept Governor Tang's petition and let him make his gambit? Or do we deny it, keep our cards close to our chest, and focus on retaining what we have?"

A swift strike south when they're still recovering from war could serve to give us the traditionally turbulent twin provinces, which would certainly be a welcomed change from their usually hostile attitude towards our Government. Given our position on the backfoot, securing more of the South, especially wealthy Guangdong, would be a helpful boon for us. The risk, of course, is the threat of the Manchu right on our door, and that if we bring our army down south it may leave us open for attack from the North.\n\nWhat shall we do? Do we accept Governor Tang's petition and let him make his gambit? Or do we deny it, keep our cards close to our chest, and focus on retaining what we have?"
 HNN_a_petition_from_changsha_loc_desc_qie_szc: "With Inspector-General Tang Xiangming's successful capture of Guangzhou, and his formation of the Southwest China Political Council, another petition has arrived from him today. With the Sichuan clique, on our border, being aligned against us, he has suggested that we march together on the clique, and he will incorporate it into his Southwest Political Council. The benefit of this is obvious, securing our Southwestern flank would be invaluable for us. The question is if we want to keep empowering Inspector-General Tang, while he has proven steadfast and loyal in the past, empowering an autonomous political council may serve as a headache in our future.\n\nSo the question remains, shall we accept the Inspector-General's petition, and let him march on Sichuan? Or do we deny it, and try to keep his ambitions in check?"
 HNN_a_petition_from_changsha_loc_desc_qie_yun: "With Inspector-General Tang Xiangming's successful capture of Guangzhou, and his formation of the Southwest China Political Council, another petition has arrived from him today. Historically troublesome, the Yunnan clique is yet again unwilling to recognise Beijing as the legitimate Government of China. Inspector-General Tang's petition asks for us to handle this thorn in both our sides immediately, reclaiming the rest of Guizhou for Yuan Zuming and incorporating Yunnan into his political council. While certainly a meddlesome province in the past, do we wish to grant Tang even greater power than he already has? Either way we need to respond to the petition sooner rather than later."
 HNN_a_petition_from_changsha_loc_desc_szc_yun: "With Inspector-General Tang Xiangming's successful capture of Guangzhou, and his formation of the Southwest China Political Council, another petition has arrived from him today. Now trapped between ourselves and Tang's territory, Yunnan is encircled and unable to expand without attacking us. Inspector-General Tang believes this is a threat, and that they will stab us in the back the moment we march North or East. His petition is to preempt a Yunnanese attack by striking first, to reclaim Guizhou for Yuan Zuming and incorporating Yunnan into his political council. He is certainly right that Yunnan could stab us in the back, but do we really want to spend our manpower and guns on empowering Tang, when there are still clear threats abound? There is merits to it, but we must think carefully before we make our choice..."

Upon getting permission Governor Tang Xiangming quickly readied his army and brought it to the southern border of Hunan.

Governor Tang, for his part, can already envision the ocean view from Guangzhou, he's spent the better part of ten years looking out at Dongting Lake from his residence in Yueyang, but soon he would be able to see out to the real ocean, the salt in the air and wind on the sea. With that vision in mind, he gave the order."

Correctly recognising Inspector-General Tang's arguments, and the second front Sichuan, clearly positioning itself against Beijing, could easily open against them, they have agreed to the Inspector-General's petition to march on Chongqing.

 hnn.zhili.13.d: "With the poison of the Kuomintang removed from Hunan, [HNN_tang_xiangming_title] Tang set his sights on a far more insidious foe, the Federalists. Former Governor Zhao claimed to be loyal to the Zhili clique, but he has been more than happy to harbour those who'd see the Zhili deposed, and was even willing to let the Kuomintang run in his election. Having no patience for those who defy him, [HNN_tang_xiangming_title] Tang has had his men hunt out these Federalists, these traitors, and has personally overseen their arrests. Unfortunately many of them managed to escape, fleeing to other parts of China, where exactly we know not.\n\nSome of the few among Zhao's old allies who can be trusted are the Xiangxi Diarchy, Tian Yingzhao and Chen Quzhen. With our recent alliance with the Diarchy, and the federalists fleeing from the province, the [HNN_tang_xiangming_title] began another series of talks with Tian in Changsha.

We cannot let these ideas grow and fester in our province, no matter the cost.\n\n[HNN_tang_xiangming_title] Tang has spared no expense in rooting out the socialists, with the banning of unions in Hunan, many began to go on strike, but those strikes were quickly broken by our army, forcing workers back into their workplaces.

Ever the magnanimous ruler, [HNN_tang_xiangming_title] Tang has listened to these calls, and declared the state of Martial Law to finally be at an end.\n\n[HNN_new_elections_middle_text] With the step away from Authoritarianism, [HNN_tang_xiangming_title] Tang Xiangming has convinced his brother, Tang Hualong, to fully integrate the Chinese Constitutionalist Party into the Harmony Association's coalition. With their combined political might they swept the recently held election, Tang Xiangming's \"Harmony Association\" earning a supermajority in the Provincial Assembly, and swiftly electing Tang Xiangming as the new Civilian Governor of Hunan.\n\nWhile some outside of our province claim the elections to be unfair, there has been little to no reportings of such a thing coming from within the province itself, and as such the claims have been mostly written off by Governor Tang as hearsay. With his \"Democratic\" mandate in hand, Tang Xiangming looks forward to his new term as Hunan's Governor."

[HNN_tang_xiangming_title] Tang Xiangming however, recognises that this is but a false sense of security. Seeing the threats all around him and around Hunan, he has rejected the attempts to convince him towards taking a lighter hand, and stated that the state of martial law will continue until \"absolute safety from foreign threats can be ensured\".\n\nThis hardline stance on the matter has led to the intellectuals and democrats still willing to work with him to distance themselves from his regime, including his own brother, Tang Hualong. While Tang hasn't resigned from his post, he has made it clear to his younger brother that he and his party see this as a blatant power grab from [HNN_tang_xiangming_title] Tang Xiangming.\n\n[HNN_tang_xiangming_title] Tang, for his part, spoke with his brother behind closed doors, pleading his case and ensuring that he can still rely on him for support in the upcoming time.\n\nWith his brothers support secured, the Admiral stated that he would ensure all traitors to Hunan are given swift justice, that his Government would refuse to accept disobedience or disloyalty, and that the safety of every single loyal Hunanese citizen would remain absolute."

With approval of [HNN_zhili_home_base], he has been elevated from Governor of Hunan to Inspector-General of Xiang-Yue-Gui (Hunan, Guangdong, Guangxi), giving him complete and direct control over the military affairs of, and by extension de facto control over, Hunan, Guangdong, and Guangxi.\n\nWithin Hunan itself, this has led to little changing, however in Guangdong and Guangxi, it means an end to the New Army occupying major cities, and some semblance of normality returning to the two Guang's.\n\nIn Guangxi, the Inspector-General has decided to cooperate with local Guangxi clans, former members of the Old Guangxi clique, and local warlords, men such as Liu Zhenhuan. All to ensure proper order would be brought to the turbulent and militant Province.\n\nIn Guangdong however, a softer approach was needed, under Chen Jiongming Guangdong has suffered similar issues as Hunan did under Zhao Hengti, however Tang recognizes he cannot take the same approach. He sent Tang Hualong south, to negotiate with the Guangdong Assembly.. Luckily for both men, Tang Hualong could successfully find a compromise with the Province, preying on fears from the Merchant Corps, the Gentry, and other Conservatives. While also using his connections to the CERA to court over moderates and even some on the left. He has successfully negotiated a working coalition in the Assembly, and has returned to Changsha with good news for his younger brother.\n\nWith the two Guang's under control, Tang Xiangming has secured a powerful southern bloc, and autonomy from [HNN_zhili_home_base].

It also, however, comes with its own problems. Not wishing to enter the quagmire that is Sichuan's political thunderdome himself, he needed to find a proper Governor for the Province.\n\nAs he gathered more information about the Province and its situation on the ground, he could feel a headache coming in, trying to find a worthwhile candidate that fit his criteria. Eventually however, he found one.\n\nTian Songyao, a minor warlord in Sichuan, a kingmaker in the Province, and an ally of the Zhili clique. lf. He's a committed anti-socialist who has served China faithfully. Forming early ties with the Zhili clique, Tian has been a player on Sichuan's stage since the days of Yuan Shikai, and as such he knows the Province's politics better than any outside his Province could know them. He is a natural fit as Governor of Sichuan, and an excellent choice by the Inspector-General.\n\nSending a telegram to the man, and to Beijing, Inspector-General Tang allowed him to move into the lands the New Army was occupying, giving him a strong power base to keep the other Sichuan warlords, the ones that survived, in check."

The National Protection Alliance, the Constitutional Protection Movement, Yunnan has prided itself on its stubborn and resilient nature. Pride comes before the fall however, and Yunnan has fallen to our forces.\n\nLuckily for Tang, Yunnan's political scene was quick to grasp, and he quickly found that General Hu Ruoyu, a man who respects the central authority of China, was a perfect candidate for Governor of Yunnan. Second only to Long Yun, and a native of Yunnan, he knows his home well, and will certainly be able to use his forces to quell the unrest within it.\n\nSending a Telegram to the man, and to [HNN_zhili_home_base] of course, Tang Xiangming has informed him of his promotion to Governor, and gotten assurances that he will restore order to the Province as soon as possible."

He is, quite naturally, joined by Governor Yuan Zuming, finally returning to the city after far too long.

#Kuomintang events
 hnn.kmt.1.t: "A Resounding Electoral Success"
 hnn.kmt.1.d: "In a surprise to everyone, the Kuomintang's united ticket has been declared victorious over Zhao Hengti's People's Renewal Society, and the other minor liberal parties. Considered the underdogs entering into the race, the duo managed to sway the hearts and minds of Hunan's populace, with Tang undeniably winning the votes of the workers, whilst Cheng managed to sway the more moderate voters, sceptical of Tang's radical worker action.\n\nWhilst the election did see an increase in political violence on behalf of the Kuomintang, the duo has entered the provincial assembly as champions. With [HNN_kmt_leader] having been sworn in as Provincial Governor, and [HNN_kmt_sic] as his Speaker of the Assembly, they have rapidly filled their cabinet with their Kuomintang comrades. Notably, Huang Gonglue from the Eighth, and Qin Zhen, aligned with Cheng Qian, albeit not from within the Sixth Army.\n\nHowever, not everyone within the region agrees with the election development. Tang Xiangming, commander of the garrison in Yueyang and the Zhili attaché to Hunan, has proven himself mysteriously unreceptive towards telegrams from the Central Government. Likewise, in the east and west, Zhao's despotic warlord partners Yuan Zuming, and the diarchy of Tian Yingzhao and Chen Quzhen, have similarly refused to respond to any telegrams from the Provincial Government. Leading military figures, mainly He Jian and Song Xilian, have advised their respective commanders that the Beiyang warlords may be plotting an overthrow of the revolutionary government and that the Kuomintang should act first."

 hnn.kmt.2.t: "An Admiral's Last Hurrah"
 hnn.kmt.2.d: "With the resounding rout of Tang \"The Butcher\" Xiangming, and the complete abrogation of any ties that the previous Hunan administrations had to the Zhili clique, the Kuomintang's United Front has seen off the storm of chaos, and can now finally focus on bringing the National Revolution to the Hunanese people. Ultimately, as the hesitation of Hunan's Provincial Army units shows, it is necessary for the Kuomintang and Kuomintang alone to lead Hunan to a bright future, for without the valiant efforts of the Sixth and Eighth armies, Hunan very well would've been plunged into another era of darkness under the tyranny of Tang Xiangming.\n\nHowever, the work is never over for the Kuomintang United Front, as in the West and Eastern portion of Guizhou, lies the next two threats to the Kuomintang's rule. With the Diarchy of Tian Yingzhao and Chen Quzhen  held up in Xiangxi — having long cooperated with Zhao — and the Old Guizhou clique entrenched within Eastern Guizhou — also a cooperative ally of Zhao — it is clear that the United Front's combined strength will be necessary to uproot both threats.\n\nYet they are not alone, for whilst their rule may be secured, they cannot win the hearts of the Provincial Assembly. That is however, where Tan Yankai comes into play. The ex-commander of the Kuomintang's 2nd Army and a previous governor of Hunan, Tan led his forces valiantly into Hunan during the Northern Expedition, but ultimately surrendered to Zhao in exchange for amnesty. Having ran in the recent election, Tan has opted to revive his military formation, recruiting the likes of the Lu brothers, amongst others, to his cause in being a rallying point for the remaining moderate republicans within Hunan.\n\nWith personal abhorrence for both Cheng and Tang due to previous actions against his Governorship in the past, Tan nonetheless has offered a hand in assistance, if not for the Kuomintang, then for the Republican movement as a whole."
 hnn.kmt.2.a: "Time to pick up the pieces."

 hnn.kmt.3.t: "An Abrupt End"
 hnn.kmt.3.d: "With the men largely functioning autonomously from each other, Cheng Qian has been hard at work focusing on eradicating Hunan's endemic warlords, and local bandits, intent on providing safety and security for the Hunanese people under the Kuomintang's auspices. In the meantime, Tang Shengzhi and Tan Yankai have been handling the general administration of the provincial government, with Tan utilising his assemblyman status, and Tang his connections with the citizenry, to ensure a return to normalcy even after a chaotic election cycle, and calamitous coup attempt by Tang Xiangming.\n\nHowever, utilising his new powers installed in him by the provincial constitution, Tang recently called for an emergency Provincial Assembly meeting, with enforced participation. When the various assemblymen of all stripes and colours filled into their seats, the crowds of elites, republicans and federalists ultimately noted the lacking presence of Tan Yankai's clique, or that of Huang Yanpei, or even Zhou Shizhao and Qian Yongming. Nonetheless, Tang Shengzhi opened the meeting with the immediate announcement that the Provincial Assembly was hereby abolished, the Constitution declared null and void, and that the Kuomintang wil promulgate the installation of a new revolutionary party state intent on following the stages of the National Revolution to its most basic principles. When the ruckus and turmoil of the assembly had calmed, Tang followed by indicting all present assemblymen on charges of \"revolutionary treason\", ordering his men to begin arrests immediately.\n\nUpon hearing the fallout of the assembly's abolition from his aide-de-camp, Cheng Qian immediately telegrammed the capital for a response, but heard no answer, instead receiving one in reply from now ex-assemblyman Tan Yankai, dissuading the general from any attempts to talk sense into Tang, and for his impotent foolishness to not see that this was coming. Having taken matters into his own hands, Tan managed to evacuate a series of key republicans from the assembly, so that they will not be imprisoned by members of the Eighth Army."

 hnn.kmt.4.t: "Traitor's Due"
 hnn.kmt.4.d: "Following the announcement of their campaign to eradicate the warlords remaining within Hunan, generals Cheng Qian and Tang Shengzhi agreed on a simultaneous, two-pronged strike against Yuan Zuming holed up in Guizhou, and the Diarchy within western Hunan. With Cheng tackling the Diarchy, the old general opted for a series of devastating artillery bombardments, expertly aimed to precisely shatter the morale of the warlord forces, before allowing Song Xilian's division to engage in a thorough encirclement of Xiangxi. Despite putting up a valiant defence of their own, the warlord forces led directly by Tian Yingzhao began to crumble first, owed to the warlord's perpetual stupor, and with his best efforts notwithstanding, Chen Quzhen's forces were unable to reverse the situation. With their final efforts to engage in a breakout operation to escape into Sichuan territory ending in dramatic failure, the Diarchy surrendered to the advancing Sixth Army.\n\nIn the Eastern Guizhou front, Tang Shengzhi's 8th Army instituted a campaign of heavy reconnaissance, aided by irregular guerrilla units situated within Guizhou, before advancing upon Yuan Zuming's entrenched Old Guizhou clique. Nominally expecting any confrontation to come from within Yunnan, Yuan Zuming's defences on his Eastern flank were comparatively light, which allowed the 8th Army to engage in steady advances despite rigorous fighting from the devoutly loyal Old Guizhou clique. However, through the clever assistance of ex-Guizhou clique member Wang Tianpei, who provided invaluable connections and knowledge on Yuan Zuming's critical weakpoints, enabling the Eighth Army to win a resounding victory with minimal losses.\n\nWith the ultimate capture of Yuan by He Jian's 2nd Division, the warlord was turned over to Tang, and Kuomintang loyalist Lu Dao was installed as Guizhou Chairman. With the intention to be transported to Changsha for a similar punishment as the Diarchy, reports have emerged in Changsha that Yuan has reportedly died in custody. Such news immediately aroused suspicion within Tan Yankai, who was overseeing the provincial government whilst the generals were away, accusing Tang of having executed Yuan in private for his betrayal in the Northern Expedition. Similarly, Cheng Qian has also reprimanded Tang for acting so ruthlessly, and without consideration of the other's within the government."

 hnn.kmt.4.b: "Revenge is a fool's bargain."

 hnn.kmt.5.t: "Ruptures in the \"United\" Front"
 hnn.kmt.5.d: "In the culmination of all efforts, lies the enduring fear of failure. This feeling is all too persistent in the mind of Cheng Qian as of recent. Originally seeing the alliance with Tang Shengzhi and his Left Kuomintang Eighth Army as a way of witnessing the first step towards party reconciliation, such dreams have been torn down by the brutal claws of reality. Despite his efforts, Tan Yankai of the revived 2nd Army intended to keep the disparaging individuals together — despite despising both Cheng and Tang equally — trying his best to mediate between the Sixth and Eighth armies, to no avail. Both prove nigh irreconcilable, and liable to tear the movement apart.\n\nYet amongst Tang's critical Eighth Army commanders lies a black sheep. Not espousing the peasant focused socialism of the likes of He Long or Peng Dehuai. Herein lies He Jian, and his loyal deputy Liu Jianxu. Conflicted in his loyalties to Tang, having served him since the 1920s, the recent radical actions by his superior has lead to a great personal introspection for the general. Crucial in so many successes, yet liable in the rising masses of radicalism within his province. Similarly, He has long resented having to constantly dwell within the shadow of Tang Shengzhi, Peng Dehuai and He Long.\n\nHaving held his private disposition for too long however, he has sent a petition to Cheng Qian for his 8th Army's 2nd Division to be folded into the 6th Army, transferring all men and material to the 6th, in return, He desires a promotion not just for himself, but for Liu Jianxu too. Long weighing the benefits of such a risky move, inevitably prone to inflaming further tensions with the Eight, Cheng has ultimately relented to He's petition, and going even a step further.\n\nWith the convening of the emergency congress, Cheng Qian announced a series of promotions, namely for He, Liu and Li Minghao, alongside the establishment of the new Rural Pacification and Peace Preservation offices, in order to better promote coordination between local forces and regular armies, as well as tackling the endemic militia problem.\n\nA surprise to many, but especially to Tang Shengzhi, the general then announced a series of his own promotions of his own devoutly loyal men towards positions within the Provincial Army, namely those of Liu Xing, Gong Hao and Tao Guang, in an attempt to equalise the playing field. Despite their best efforts, it would appear the United Front has fallen, and only one survivor can emerge..."
 hnn.kmt.5.a: "A Fourth player emerges."

 hnn.kmt.6.t: "Tackling the Local Militias"
 hnn.kmt.6.d: "Nominally a local organisation, the militia in Hunan were intended to serve as local guardians for their communities in times of great national crisis, and yet it did not turn out that way. Generally seen as being controlled by the local elites and serving their interests exclusively, many local militia commanders are not only extensively corrupt, but use and abuse the military power granted to them by the provincial government to interfere in local governance and the administration of local, honest, justice. Furthermore, the quality of local militia vary wildly from county to county, and the extensive autonomy of militia commanders hinders any combined operations.\n\nIn what is being claimed as his hallmark reform proposition, He Jian has drafted a concerted reform effort aimed at distinguishing between two types of militia: standing forces of armed regulars and mass militia composed of ordinary citizens. The first reform would seek to establish stronger official control by organising all local militia, now designated Household Conscription Militia, under a unified bureau headed by the county magistrate and assisted by vice-heads selected from among the local elite. All full time militia units were to be reorganised into standardised standing companies, meanwhile, one in every three adult males under the age of forty would be required to participate in unpaid mass militia units, termed \"watch patrols\". By selecting men from watch patrols to serve three-year terms in standing companies, the hope is that a close connection between the two types of militia will be formed.\n\nWhat remains up to question however, is the intent and purpose behind the standing companies. Whilst they do not serve the inherent role of local defence akin to the watch patrols, they nonetheless can be utilised against enemies of the state apparatus. Eighth Army commander Tang Shengzhi advocates for the pointing of militia efforts to those he dubiously dubs \"enemies of the people\", whilst Sixth Army commander Cheng Qian insists that the militia be directed at local bandits and the remaining petty warlords that survived the Kuomintang's early operations."
 hnn.kmt.6.a: "Direct our efforts against the enemies of the people!"
 hnn.kmt.6.b: "Focus on the bandits, and petty warlords, that remain."

 hnn.kmt.7.t: "Formation of the Peace Preservation Corps"
 hnn.kmt.7.d: "In light of our recent grand reform efforts aimed at tackling the local militia problem, it would appear that the previous system instituted by General He Jian and his Peace Preservation office has led to results not in line with the expectations desired by either the government or He himself. For example, most magistrates are too busy to actually tend to the management of the local militia corps, and therefore it would fall onto the vice-heads to run them. As many vice-heads were in-fact ex-local militia commanders, the same behaviours of abuse tended to crop up. Similarly, localities were slow to implement the watch patrol system, and lacking such critical foundation, led to the legalisation of what were effectively mercenary companies.\n\nIn response, He Jian has proposed another major reform focused on transforming the very nature of the standing companies. Firstly, all standing companies shall be reformed and consolidated into a singular county \"Peace Preservation\" regiment, and these forces will receive training similar to the regular army. The country magistrate supervisory role will be eliminated, and instead Peace Preservation units will be placed under officers who are selected on the basis of prior experience in the military, appointed by the Rural Pacification Commander, He Jian.\n\nHowever Tang Shengzhi, He Long and Peng Dehuai have all raised concerns with He Jian's overt anti-socialist outlook. Knowing the general for decades, Tang has raised He's private beliefs of devout anti-socialism towards the congress, accusing He of proliferating his own private army of legal thugs to dispense his so-called \"pacification\" on the poor citizenry who only desire a better world for themselves. Such accusations have been deflected by He, who insists that his goal is to militarise the Hunanese people, so that they may stand ready for if, or when, an invader sets foot on the province's territory."
 hnn.kmt.7.a: "This is an affront to the Party itself!"
 hnn.kmt.7.b: "Restrain some of the worst parts."

 hnn.kmt.8.t: "Financing the Education Efforts"
 hnn.kmt.8.d: "Of special interest to both He Jian and Cheng Qian is that of the education department. With Cheng Qian having educated many future Kuomintang rising stars such as Song Xilian, whilst He Jian descends from a family with a background in education, it is natural both men bond over their fondness for enlightening the youth. As such, the duo have proposed an ambitious plan that would expand primary schools in Hunan from 18,000 to 23,800. At the same time, they desire the expansion of middle school enrolments across junior Hunanese, and the establishment of normal schools in each county, the creation of a system of exams for elementary and secondary school teachers to improve the quality of instruction, the establishment of a selection process and the provision of public funding for students wishing to study abroad. Finally, the duo desire the founding of short-term elementary schools and scholarship programmes for the children of poor families, and the organisation of a province wide literacy campaign.\n\nReceiving resounding agreement from all members of government, and crucially Tan Yankai alongside Tang Shengzhi, the true issue up for debate was where the provincial government should procure the necessary funds for such an ambitious project. With He Jian insisting that at least one-quarter of the provincial budget be dedicated to the purpose of the programmes, Tang Shengzhi has fought back. Raising the issue that even already, expense payments for government offices are often delayed, and troop payments are frequently in arrears, Tang proposes that its necessary for the government to perform budget cuts in order to institute such a landmark programme.\n\nWith such an idea again in mutual agreement, Tang has advocated for the allocation of funds away from General He Jian's Rural Pacification and Peace Preservation Offices, insisting that the bodies should be subservient to the military, not have the funding to be able to perform independently from it. In opposition, He Jian suggests that government move funding away from its union support programmes, insisting that workers already receive ample aid from the government directly, and that funding the unions is sure to lead to the expanding influence of the Chinese Syndicalist Party."
 hnn.kmt.8.a: "Move to allocate funds away from the Pacification Office."
 hnn.kmt.8.b: "Regretfully, deprive funds from the Unions."

 hnn.kmt.9.t: "Out with the Old, In with the New"
 hnn.kmt.9.d: "The next reform being hotly debated within the provincial government is that of the local governmental administration reforms proposed by general He Jian. In said reforms, the General advocates for the expansion and restructuring of local administrations, promoting the development of examination and evaluation systems for country magistrates, alongside the expansion and elaboration of county government. Similarly, He desires for the government to undertake the reorganisation and regularisation of sub-county government — perhaps reinforced by the generals recurring efforts, with varying degrees of success, for the institution of a baojia mutual security system — and for the implementation of a system of periodic inspections, in order to evaluate the responsiveness of local officials, and their effectiveness in implementing government policies.\n\nIn particular however, that last section of the reform has provoked ire from Tang Shengzhi, who instead proposes that local officials be evaluating not on effectiveness, albeit important, but instead on their loyalty to the party. Tang draws special attention to the significance of previous Hunan administrations, wherein local elites and gentry began to control the magistrates of their country districts through bribes or other nefarious means. By insisting on party loyalty, Hunan's new administration can rectify the issues of the past, whilst walking towards the future."
 hnn.kmt.9.a: "Party loyalty to the utmost!"
 hnn.kmt.9.b: "Appoint magistrates based on merit, not ideology."

 hnn.kmt.10.t: "The Extent of Provisional Action"
 hnn.kmt.10.d: "In another one of General He Jian's hallmark reform efforts, he has advised that the provincial government begin the creation of a series of advisory committees, the establishment of a series of regulations, and the formation of future plans for the fulfilment of Hunan's National Revolution. Insisting that the province is woefully unprepared to embark on Tutelage, let alone military rule or National Reconstruction, He insists that the regulations in Hunan will serve as guides to future actions, as opposed to being written in the place of action.\n\nUltimately, the Sixth Army is in agreement with General He, with Cheng Qian himself recognising the benefit provided by creating an increasingly institutionalised regulatory regime linked to the broader state-building effort of the Kuomintang as a whole. Similarly, He has continued his campaign, insisting that laws and regulations are an essential foundation for any action, and presents not only the writing of said regulations but also their dissemination as an important function of government.\n\nIn complete opposition to such action stands Tang Shengzhi and his Eighth Army, insisting that the continued bureaucratisation of the party's organs and functions will only lead to an unnecessary quagmire of nightmares, that would have to be traversed for any considerable action to be implemented. Instead, the General advocates for a policy of brief planning, but immediate corresponding action. Necessitating that revolutionary governance is an ugly affair, and that any further writings will lead to an ineffectual government akin to those in Beiyang."
 hnn.kmt.10.a: "Plans mean nothing without corresponding action!"
 hnn.kmt.10.b: "Governance is not in the amount of words, but in implementation."

 hnn.kmt.11.t: "Building the Foundations"
 hnn.kmt.11.d: "As advised by General He Jian, the government has embarked on a grand expansion of Hunan's transportation and communication systems. Focusing on motor transport, the ultimate aim for the government's project is to expand Hunan's highways from 1000 miles of road to the upper limits of 4000. As noted by He, such an expansion of critical infrastructure would mean any intrepid individual could drive motorised vehicles from within Hunan, to all of its neighbouring provinces. Likewise, in railroad construction, the government aims for the enhancement of the pre-existing Guangzhou-Beijing line to enable further trainlines to travel alongside it.\n\nIn terms of telecommunications, Hunan's Construction Department hopes to expand the measly number of 90 miles of telecom cables to 2800 miles, totalling 15 lines across 33 of Hunan's 75 counties. Naturally, whilst the civilians are expected to receive some benefit from the projects, the true enhancements arise in the cases of military transportation and coordination.\n\nHowever, Tang Shengzhi has criticised the government for wasting provincial resources on projects that contribute in no large number to needs and wants of the Chinese citizenry. Pointing out that the construction of roads provides little benefits to farmers, who lack access to such vehicles, and instead is a sign of the Provincial Government and Sixth Army engorging themselves on their own profits."
 hnn.kmt.11.a: "Yet these efforts fail to reach those who need them the most."
 hnn.kmt.11.b: "A fantastic initiative, He Jian!"

 hnn.kmt.12.t: "Hunan's Revolutionary Savant"
 hnn.kmt.12.d: "When Tang Shengzhi first betrayed Zhao on the eve of the Northern Expedition, he knew little of how his reverberating power play would begin to shape and shift his life from there onwards. Perhaps if he had stayed under Zhao's command, he would've accompanied the likes of Ye Kaixin, or He Yaozu as Zhao's trusted lieutenants, and perhaps he would've won the Governorship by challenging the incumbent in a fair match. Yet ultimately, would he have been satisfied? Would he have sat by as Zhao clamped down on the labour movement, cooperated with despots, and oppressed the workers? All in the name of defending Hunan's democracy?\n\nReflecting on his actions, and his connection to the world, it has become increasingly clear to the general as to why the Xinhai Revolution failed in 1911. Critical to its misfortunes, was not its lack of arms, or skilled personnel, but of its lack of participation of the workers and peasants. The success of the revolution, be it the Kuomintang's National Revolution or otherwise, hinged on the support and mass uprising of both the workers and peasants. The nascent May 30th movement has proved this fact, and similarly, the 1932 Uprisings throughout the country reinforced it.\n\nHaving outflanked his political rival, Cheng Qian, the intrepid general called for a second congress within the Hunan Provincial Government, wherein he announced the removal of all Sixth Army members from their government offices post-haste, the abolition of the Rural Pacification and Peace Preservation offices, and the appointment of He Long to the previous offices held by Cheng, along with instating other Eighth Army commanders into the suddenly vacant positions.\n\nYet, Tang could not bring himself to strip anyone from the 6th Army of their party membership, perhaps out of respect for their shared sacrifices for the nation, or otherwise. In a striking display of compassion, at least to outsiders, Tang has extended a hand of thanks to his rivals, hoping that together they may very well work to protect the Hunanese people no matter the cost."
 hnn.kmt.12.a: "Finally, on top."

 hnn.kmt.13.t: "Ruminations of the Old Guard"
 hnn.kmt.13.d: "Weathered and beaten, yet stubborn and resistant. No finer words could exemplify Cheng Qian's continued revolutionary struggle for the Chinese people. Considered a relic of a bygone age by the young radicals across the aisle, Cheng nonetheless provides a steady hand at the wheel of Hunan's future. Whilst he very well may have lit the flame of infighting that has seen so much chaos and bloodshed in the short lifetime of Hunan's Provincial Government, he remains resolute that it was the correct choice.\n\nWith the careful politicking of the old general outmanoeuvring Tang Shengzhi's radical onslaught, the Chairman called for a second congress within the Hunanese Provincial Government, wherein he announced the removal of Tang Shengzhi and the Eighth Army from all governmental offices, and the thorough deradicalisation of government. With a resolute mind, the Chairman appointed ringleader of Hunan's recent reforms, and head of the Peace Preservation office, He Jian, to fulfil the obligations and duties of Tang Shengzhi's previous role within government.\n\nDespite all of the injustices committed, and what could be considered treason by many within the party, the old general opted not to implement any form of capital punishment upon Tang, nor strip him of party membership. Extending a hand of compromise, like always, the General hopes that Tang will redeem himself through service to the nation and its National Revolution.\n\nNonetheless, behind closed doors, the old general has still ordered the Public Safety Bureau to maintain tabs on all actions committed by Tang and his two deputies, Peng Dehuai and He Long. For whilst he hopes for their earnest redemption, he has learnt the consequences of foolishness. Now all that remains is to look forward, to a brighter future for the Chinese nation."

 hnn.kmt.14.t: "Our Allies in Hunan"
 hnn.kmt.14.d1: "[ROOT.GetLeader] has received a recent telegram of supposed support from Provincial Chairman [HNN.GetLeader], reaffirming his ties with our Federal Government. Considering the fact that [HNN.GetLeader] has quite recently ousted our genuine Federalist and close ally Zhao Hengti for the second time, it is natural that many within the government view [HNN.GetLeader] with a strong sense of estrangement. Even worse, [HNN.GetLeader]'s original ousting of Zhao led to the cataclysmic Northern Expedition.\n\nYet Revolutionary actions make for strange bedfellows, and [ROOT.GetLeader] is no stranger to compromises with unscrupulous opportunists to see the general achievement of a Federal China. With [HNN.GetLeader]'s original backers in the Kuomintang experiencing defeat across the board, he had turned towards [ROOT.GetLeader], who graciously accepted his alliance, despite Zhao's protests.\n\nUltimately however, no matter how idealistic, [HNN.GetLeader] without a doubt has to contend with the might of his greatest ally, and rival, in the forces of [HNN.GetSecondInCommand], who is absolutely against the ideology of our government. Relentlessly fighting [HNN.GetLeader] at every step of the way. Fortunately, [HNN.GetLeader] reassures [ROOT.GetLeader] that his position in Hunan's provincial government is absolutely secure." #Fed
 hnn.kmt.14.d2: "Despite the stringent party line advocated for by the Reorganised Comrades Association, the Hunanese Kuomintang laugh in the face of such ideals and orthodoxy. Ruled by a diarchy of Tang Shengzhi's 8th Army and Cheng Qian's 6th Army, the duo outwardly project a cross-wing United Kuomintang Front. Yet our eyes and ears in the underground assure us that the unity presented is but merely a facade. Underneath the shine and gleam is a provincial government rife with infighting and intrigue.\n\nPerhaps, in an odd way, it is emblematic of our own internal power struggles. Nonetheless, both of the Hunanese leaders are firm advocates against the Reorganised Comrades Association, with Tang Shengzhi being one of the key generals of the Provisional Action Committee during MinGan, whilst Cheng Qian is a staunch believer in the moderate stance preached by Sun Fo's Reconstruction Faction.\n\nYet one would be a fool to not acknowledge the great strides and successes being made within the Provincial Government. For Hunan has displayed a remarkable capability of participating in, if imperfect, democracy. Whilst ultimately it will have to wait until the conclusion of the National Revolution, the province is serving as a key model province for the rest of the nation." #LKMT
 hnn.kmt.14.d3: "In an excellent display of his strategic mind, Cheng Qian has managed to successfully facilitate the removal of one of the Kuomintang's rivals, Zhao Hengti. Yet curiously, the commander of the 6th Army achieved this through a unified effort with Left Kuomintang radical, and commander of the 8th Army, Tang Shengzhi. Both generals entered Hunan province upon the announcement of Hunan's provincial election, and elected to cooperate together on a joint Kuomintang ticket.\n\nWhilst idealists would dream of this being a sign of reunification of the wings of the party, it has clearly exemplified the opposite. Even now, both Cheng and Tang squabble, fight, and commit espionage against each other to try and oust the other individual from their position of power within the province.\n\nConsidering the circumstances, it is absolutely necessary that Cheng Qian comes out the victor, however we cannot spare the resources to openly support his efforts. Yet [ROOT.GetLeader] can clearly see that despite the infighting, Hunan is making great strides towards setting the example as a Kuomintang model province, well on its way towards the proliferation of the National Revolution." #RKMT
 hnn.kmt.14.d4: "An odd duck amongst the fellows of the National Protection Alliance, Provincial \"Chairman\" [HNN.GetLeader] has sent an elaborate series of telegrams to [ROOT.GetLeader], assuring the leader of his, and Hunan's, continued and perpetual support for the National Protection Alliance. A revolutionary in spirit and action, the Chairman has found himself amongst those who would usually disagree with his governance, yet nonetheless he fights by their side.\n\nDespite the venerable Chairman's allies however, Hunan itself remains a hotbed of revolutionary fervour, with a strong workers movement, and even stronger peasant foundation. Perhaps, in light of the situation in the nation, the Kuomintang will last even upon reunification by the NPA.\n\nUltimately however, no matter how idealistic, [HNN.GetLeader] without a doubt has to contend with his more orthodox Kuomintang allies that he shares power with. As while [HNN.GetLeader] reaffirms his commitment, his deputy and greatest rival [HNN.GetSecondInCommand] is absolutely no friend of ours, and will relentlessly fight to oppose us at every direction. Unfortunately, all [ROOT.GetLeader] can do is hope that [HNN.GetLeader] can wrangle his radicals, and maintain control." #NPA

With his ambitions drawing him from the slow advancement of a scholar's career, to the skyrocketing rapid promotions capable within China's new modern style armies. He Jian is a veteran of many conflicts, all requiring his capable mind and quick thinking skills to ensure survival. Having rode the coattails of Tang Shengzhi's own career, following him in promotion all the way to brigade commander, He Jian began to emerge himself following the Northern Expedition and his time in MinGan. Having perhaps reached the zenith of his career following his promotion to division commander and head of the Rural Pacification Office, He might not be the most loyal or ideologically stringent, but his achievements alone speak for themselves."
 hnn.kmt.15.d.song: "Emblematic of the Whampoa generation of cadres, Song Xilian is a fresh, young face within the National Revolutionary Army. Inclined to revolutionary behaviour from a young age, at the age of 13, he and his classmates co-founded a revolutionary paper, most infamously known for criticising Zhao Hengti upon his execution of labour activists during his tenure. Having graduated from the first class of Whampoa, Song became the youngest graduate in the history of the academy, and thundered onto the battlefield with valiant performance in the Eastern and Northern expeditions. Ultimately however, his true career is yet to begin, and whilst lauded as one of the Kuomintang's greatest officers, he has focused on taking a mostly apolitical moderate stance within inter-party politics, albeit private allegiances seem to lie with his old superior, Cheng Qian."
 hnn.kmt.15.d.cheng: "Having been fighting the revolutionary struggle for decades, Cheng Qian's career has witnessed many ups and downs, yet he has never truly been defeated. Seeing service in Xinhai, the Northern Expedition, and everything in-between, he is symbolic of the old diehard Tongmenghui revolutionaries, a generation long past. Considered a moderate by many of his contemporaries within both the Right and Left wings of the Kuomintang, Cheng echoes the footsteps of Song Jiaoren, or Huang Xing, more than those of Dr. Sun Yat-sen. Nonetheless, the old tiger has fought alongside the likes of the late Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, and General Li Jishen, always with the hope of seeing the National Revolution. With his recent successes on the battlefield, Cheng has managed to win the hearts of the people for his prized Sixth Army."
 hnn.kmt.15.d.peng: "Born into a family with a long running tradition of farming, his family was within a rapid decline, forcing Peng to make numerous sacrifices to aid their survival. Ultimately participating in a peasant uprising, Peng was forced to flee his family, and later enlisted into Tang Xiangming's army in 1916. This would begin a storied revolutionary career that would see Peng eternally fight for the rights of his fellow peasants. Taking a particular liking towards military command, Peng's skill on the battlefield has continued to rise ever since, leading to his eventual promotion to division commander during his time in MinGan. Regarded as the second pillar of the Eighth Army, alongside the likes of He Long, the duo continue to push an agrarian socialist doctrine under the auspices of their superior Tang Shengzhi, despite his rather more moderate outlook."
 hnn.kmt.15.d.helong: "With his father having been a member of the Gelaohui, and a Qing military officer, perhaps it was fate that He Long too would take the path of the military and revolutionary politics. Following a multipolar career that saw He flirt with socialism, an assassination attempt against Tan Yankai, and an eventual routing by Zhao Hengti, He would join the National Revolutionary Army, and serve with distinction. Following their defeat in the Northern Expedition, He would follow the Eighth Army into the insurgency zone, where he would begin to be courted by many individuals within the Provisional Action Committee. Cementing his agrarian socialist views during his time there, He's military successes serve as a venue for which he can promote the ideals and support for his radical faction within the 8th Army. How much he can influence the policies of his superior Tang Shengzhi however, remains to be seen."
 hnn.kmt.15.d.tang: "Considered by many to be a traitor, an opportunist, a sign of how far the Kuomintang has fallen, none however, can deny Tang Shengzhi's revolutionary credentials. Having joined the Tongmenghui in 1909, Tang would fight in a student corps during the Xinhai Revolution, under the auspices of Zhao Hengti in 1923, and later, against Zhao himself in 1926. Joining the National Revolutionary Army and being given command of the 8th Army that same year, Tang would light the match that would ultimately develop into the inferno of the Northern Expedition, seeing a series of early successes in the first period of the conflict. Witnessing a myriad of men fighting for power and profit within Hunan, Tang would undergo a period of depression, until meeting Buddhist practitioner Gu Boxu, wherein he would convert following his teachings. Whilst his political opponents implore to paint him as a religious fanatic, Tang has taken proudly to their moniker of the \"Buddhist General\"."

The Eighth Army are not anarchists of course, and even they can see the value in maintaining at least cordial ties with their opposition. Through their accruing of power all across the organs of government, they have managed to shuffle the Sixth Army into nigh irrelevancy.\n\nThis totality of control has swept itself up into a massed torrent, resulting in all opposition to Tang being drowned out by the 8th's propaganda department, yet this has put forward the concern that such dominance will lead to eventual weakness. With the 8th Army radicals growing increasingly pompous, they have begun to even push the moderates of the Army around.\n\nThe Sixth Army may be down, but they are not out of the game just yet. Perhaps through our connections and mutual brotherhood, Tang can open avenues for the Sixth to fight back, at least in part, against the radicals within his camp. It would be a wise choice, for the very state of Hunan is at stake."

 hnn.kmt.17.d: "Whilst the Sixth Army promotes itself as a shield of moderatism against the perceived tyranny of the Eighth, our actions of \"defence\" can equally protect the people as it can snuff out their cries. Ultimately, the Sixth's successes on the political battlefield have led to a nigh total dominance of their ranks within the government, with all loyalists of Tang Shengzhi, or the Chinese Syndicalist Party, having their influence isolated.\n\nConsidered a price that we have to pay for salvation, the Sixth Army's appointments and officers have grown increasingly complacent in their solid foundations, losing the vigilance that earned them their might. In a related course of events, the Rural Pacification and Peace Preservation offices have grown increasingly ambitious and bold, no longer deigning it worth the effort to hide their blatant anti-socialist abuses.\n\nConcerned for the stability and prosperity of Hunan as a whole, Cheng could reach out to Tang in a form of affair accompli, to even the scales and allow the Eighth to fight back. It presents itself as an enticing opportunity, lest Hunan break into full civil war."

 hnn.kmt.18.t: "Pomp and Circumstance"
 hnn.kmt.18.d: "The Kuomintang is no stranger to grand displays of military frivolity, be it through parades, or the embellishment of divisions or soldiers with medals and accomplishments. Similarly, the Sixth and Eighth National Revolutionary Armies were inspected by both Chairman [HNN.GetLeader] and [HNN.GetSecondInCommand]. Nominally as a projection of the Kuomintang's military force for all to observe, officials within the government believe that the grand display is an attempt to promote the superiority of either Kuomintang leader's respective army.\n\n A crowd of 15,000 gathered to witness the finest soldiers of the 6th and 8th on their respective marches. The first up for presentation was Cheng Qian's 6th, lead by their shining star, Song Xilian. Emblematic of the force of the Right Kuomintang, the soldiers were clearly weathered and adorned their standard Kuomintang uniform with pride. Marching in unison with each other and the bellowing music, resolute purpose beamed from the soldier's faces.\n\nIn contrast, Tang Shengzhi's 8th Army represented a mixture of Irregular Units, Regular Units, and Tang's own elite veterans. However, perhaps due to their commander's special fixation on the presentation of his army, their uniforms were untarnished by conflict, clearly having been produced with the sole purpose of being used for parade.\n\nMost curiously however, is the adornment upon Tang's elite soldiers. All of them sported the \"Medal of Great Benevolence and Humanity's Redemption\", a clear sign of Tang's Buddhist influences within his soldiers. In fact, Tang's elite soldiers are from a time wherein all forces under the commander had to follow Buddhism, willing or not, in order to serve underneath him. With the parade concluding, little knew what to think of the image Tang crafted: an eclectic mix of devout Buddhist warriors, combined with the standard soldiery of the NRA."

 hnn.kmt.19.t: "Reflections"
 hnn.kmt.19.d: "Through the constant fighting, one finds little time for peace and quiet, even worse if one has not been exiled from their own home province for nearly a decade. The Kuomintang is an organisation of revolutionaries, young, radical and demanding change. Yet in its roots lay a quieter time, still devoutly revolutionary, true, but a time of poets, intellectuals and politicians. Not of militarists, opportunists and warlords. Within the nation, there remains those who manage to straddle the line between both worlds. A thinker, whilst also a tactician. A writer, and a warrior. Counted amongst these is that of Cheng Qian, as although he has been a military man all throughout his life, he associates himself with innumerous intellectual thinkers, and has compiled quite an amassment of poetry and prose.\n\nAfter visiting the Yueyang Tower, the General took time to reflect. On the battle he fought here, notably against Wu Peifu, in 1917. On the similar resemblance of the scenery, after returning home from both war and exile. With a melancholic flair, the General begun drafting a new piece:\n\n\"What is the thing that the country treasures the most? There is no trace of the old forts from back in those days.\nStrive to overlook yet the scene is depressing, there is a long way ahead and the snowstorm is raging.\nA small island in the sea is cherished by the birds, but the boats and ships still want to clash with the waves.\nThroughout the ages melancholy is congested, countless graces and grudges confronted with each other.\nThe Jiuyi Mountains and Mount Heng seem within reach, yet still the Hells remain an obstacle.\"\n\nConsidering the continued struggle against warlords, against his own party, against those who distil the revolution, it would appear that the history of this nation is smothered with bloodshed and suffering. Yet even then, the fight must continue, despite the odds. Under siege on all fronts, he shall not let Hunan's revolution falter, ever preserving it."

Fearing that they'd be sidelined if the Kuomintang won, they threw their votes behind Zhao, and ensured the Governorship for him. In his acceptance speech, Zhao has spoken about keeping Hunan safe in the turbulent times ahead, and that he would do all he can to strengthen and reinforce their young democracy, alongside thanking everybody who helped him during this election season, and promised to ensure a free and fair Hunan for all of it's citizens, regardless of their background."
 hnn.fed.1.d_2: "Zhao Hengti's coalition has won the election by a notable margin. This result hardly comes as a surprise, given he was the favourite going in.

 hnn.fed.2.d: "Governor Zhao may have won the election, but that does not mean Hunan's democracy is secured. In fact, between the surprise success of the Kuomintang and the Assembly members elected under warlord influences (Tang Xiangming, Chen Quzhen, and Tian Yingzhao) it seems like this election has served to give more authoritarian figures a stronger hand.\n\nThese forces, while not allies in any capacity, all collectively serve as a threat to our young democracy, if the Kuomintang grows too strong we could easily see Tang Xiangming march south on us, and decapitate our democracy at the head. Furthermore, the Xiangxi Diarchy has grown more and more distant from us, aligning itself with Tang Xiangming more as time goes on. They may be biding their time right now, but that will not last forever, and we must act before they do.\n\nLuckily, we aren't alone in our fight. Governor Zhao quickly recognised the threat and has acted accordingly, forming a \"Grand Coalition\" with the other democratic parties (and independents) in order to form a broad democratic front. With the Grand Coalition formed, we have access to several tools to undercut the authoritarians in our province, and hamstring their efforts to kill the democracy so dear to our Governor."

Chen had been tricked to attend the funeral of Ma Ji's predecessor and adopted father in Nanning, Guangxi, where he was gunned down in an ambush.\n\nWith the government of Liangguang and Guangdong in shambles along with the Federalist movement, our alliance with them has become null and void as they descend into civil war between bickering provincial leaders."

Chen Jiongming's fate is currently unknown, but the rumour mill in the city appears convinced that he is still alive and has fled to Hong Kong.\n\nWhile this appears to be preventing a war between Liangguang's two provinces as Guangxi was recently seized by Li Zongren, another KMT-aligned warlord, our alliance with Liangguang has been rendered null and void with our ally's illegal removal from power."

Only a few hours after the order was given He Yaozu was outside the city, when Tang Xiangming's garrison came out and skirmished against He's forces. Ultimately Tang was outmatched, and retreated across the border. While this sadly means Zhao was unable to arrest Tang, it does mean that he can no longer pose a threat to our democracy."

 hnn.fed.5.t: "Our Administration and our Intelligentsia"
 hnn.fed.5.d: "One of the pillars of our support is Hunan's intelligentsia. Ever since the repression of intellectuals by the League many of China's intellectuals have fled to Hunan for safety, and Governor Zhao has been happy to host them. Our Government and our intelligentsia form a symbiotic relationship, and they were a vital piece to our reelection, and as such Zhao has bolstered his support even further than before. These efforts have turned Changsha into a intellectual hub, a place for the brightest minds of China to meet and speak on matters plaguing the nation.\n\nThis, quite naturally, reflects well on our own administration and shows that intellectual debate, that democracy, is certainly possible, even with the troubles of warlords and banditry. An impressive feat for a Province that, only a few years ago, was trapped inside the same League that repressed these bright minds, and stifled learning in the country as a whole."
 hnn.fed.5.a: "To a renewed partnership!"

 hnn.fed.6.t: "Troubles with Monroe"
 hnn.fed.6.d: "One of the more peculiar parts of Hunan's Constitution is that of Article 89, otherwise known as the \"Monroe Doctrine\", which states that no other Provinces troops may enter Hunan, and Hunanese troops may not leave the Province. While this has been intended to keep Hunan safe from Armies during the tumultuous time of the warlord era, it has become a detriment to Hunan's safety. The warlords and provincial leaders outside of Hunan hardly care about what our Constitution states, and as such it fails to offer a real defence against them, only serving to bind our ability to act in favour of Hunan.\n\nWith these thoughts in mind, Zhao has pushed for the Monroe Doctrine to be amended, to allow Hunan's armies to march out of the province, and for the central government to move through Hunan when necessary. Defending his amendments in the Provincial Assembly he has pointed towards the Northern Expedition, the League Collapse, the two times the Kuomintang forcefully marched their troops into Hunan. Stating that the Monroe Doctrine did nothing to stop them, and that they didn't hesitate for a second because of it.\n\nTo his surprise, the Assembly was shockingly receptive to this argument, it seems the two Kuomintang armies marching into Hunan had served as a wake up call to many in the Assembly, realising that the only way for Hunan to truly be safe from warlords and enemy armies, is for China to be united under one banner."
 hnn.fed.6.a: "For a new Hunan in a new China!"

 hnn.fed.7.t: "An Olive Branch for Labour"
 hnn.fed.7.d: "Our relationship with organised labour has been... fraught, to say the least. With the unfortunate deaths of labour activists during Zhao's administration in the past being emblematic of those difficult relationships. But Governor Zhao is determined to change this. Organised labour is a pillar of the Kuomintang's support and if he is to undercut the self proclaimed \"Party-State\" and secure Hunanese Democracy, he must forge a peace with labour.\n\nMeeting with major labour leaders in Changde, the tension in the air was palpable. After introductions were made Zhao explained that, despite actions in the past, he wished to offer an olive branch to labour. Seizing the opportunity, the labour leaders immediately made a series of demands, functionally asking for a new law that would bolster labour unions and improve their ability to barter on the behalf of workers.\n\nGovernor Zhao recognised their initial demands wouldn't pass through the Assembly, and after a series of tense negotiations he managed to talk them down to a compromise bill, one that he was certain he could force through the Assembly. With this agreement made, pending the bill being made into law of course, it seemed like he could finally call a truce with organised labour, and cut support for the Kuomintang in Hunan's major cities."
 hnn.fed.7.a: "The first step to harmony with labour."

 hnn.fed.8.t: "Our Own Bill of Rights"
 hnn.fed.8.d: "Hunan's Provincial Constitution already confers a number of rights to it's citizens. Including Habeas Corpus (Article 6), the right to own private property (Article 7), the freedom of religion (Article 10), freedom of association (Article 12), the right to bear arms (Article 13), and compulsory universal education (Article 21). These are major advancements to our cause, but we must work to reinforce these rights and add more, including a right to free speech, right to criticise the Government, and freedom of the press. While all three are de facto rights under Zhao's administration, we cannot ensure others will follow the Governor's precedent.\n\nAs such, Governor Zhao met with many of the brightest minds in Hunan, gathering a collection of intellectuals, and hosted a conference to give Hunan it's own Bill of Rights, further codifying the current protections in the Constitution, and reinforcing them with the new rights stated above.\n\nAfter a long debate among the different intellectuals, the conference has proved a resounding success, and Zhao has used his own personal clout and political acumen to push it through the Assembly, allowing to pass the vote in its pure form, and ensuring more rights for every citizen of our province!"
 hnn.fed.8.a: "An important step for freedom."

 hnn.fed.9.t: "Old Allies, New Problems"
 hnn.fed.9.d: "The Xiangxi Diarchy in the west has generally been aligned with Governor Zhao's clique. Despite this, they serve as an obstacle to the burgeoning Hunanese democracy. Working within his powers as Governor, Zhao has made several reforms in the west, curtailing Tian Yingzhao's official positions in terms of power, and using his forces to ensure the western villages local representatives are those who will properly represent their villages, rather than serving the interests of the Diarchy\n\nThese reforms aren't without their opponents, the Diarchy controls a notable amount of seats in the Assembly, who made their best attempts to block the reforms on the Assembly floor.\n\nSupport against them came from, much to our own surprise, many of the Assemblymen voted on the Kuomintang ticket, seemingly finding the Western Diarchy, a pair of warlords, as more intolerable than Governor Zhao is. Chief among these members was former Governor Tan Yankai, who gave an impassioned speech in favour of the reforms. We know not what his intentions were behind this, nor what benefit it will provide to him, but we are certainly grateful for his assistance in removing warlord influence in Hunan."
 hnn.fed.9.a: "An allied warlord is still a warlord."

 hnn.fed.10.t: "The Federalist Model Province"
 hnn.fed.10.d: "After fighting fierce resistance and enemies on all sides, Governor Zhao has successfully defended and reinforced Hunan's democracy from those who would rather see it destroyed. Between Tang Xiangming and the Kuomintang, balancing on the razor thin wire was a difficult endeavour, but being the expert political operator he is, Zhao managed to thread the needle. Curbing the influence of the Kuomintang through appeals to the peasant and worker, ensuring they couldn't use populist unrest as the sword against Hunan's young democracy. On the other side, Tang Xiangming and his Yueyang garrison has been expelled from Hunan, and the Sword of Damocles that hung over Hunan's democracy has been shattered. While there is still room for further work, Governor Zhao's efforts have led to a wonderful expansion of the people's rights, of democratic traditions, and of local democracy in China. A model for all Federalists to follow, Hunan has solidified itself as a Democratic Stronghold in the heart of China."

 HNN.economy.1.d: "Having been one of the composite provinces of the League of Eight Provinces, naturally the Hunanese economy was reasonably integrated into the broader German current. However, being majority agrarian. and surrounded by the industrial cities on the hill of Wuhan, Guangzhou, and Nanjing, the Hunanese economic sectors have had a troubled experience during the Warlord Era. For who in their right mind would seek to invest in Hunan, when the grass is greener not too far away.\n\nNot is all lost though, for maintaining our autonomy from Sun Chuanfang has been to our benefit in more ways than one. As despite the rather paltry economic conditions following what has been dubbed \"Black Monday\", Hunan has fared slightly better than its neighbours in the League, or the Central Government.\n\nYet with our main economic partners undergoing worse turmoil, our agricultural sector is witnessing calamitous effects as a result, and our investors are rapidly fleeing.

Exacerbating these issues further is the crucial nature of Hunan's farming market, for it amounts to a considerable portion of provincial revenues due to its largely export based economy. And so behold the unfurled nature of Hunan's agriculture: the peasantry's labour breeds resentment, directed at the gentry, whilst the latter reaps the benefits of their important status.\n\nA military man at heart, agricultural reform is not within [HNN.GetLeader]'s array of qualifications, and yet he is saddled with quite a detrimental situation. Various members of the Provincial Assembly, most important of which being his own brother, Tang Hualong, have urged the Governor to see the reasoning in pursuing a policy focused on treating the Peasant's collective trauma. But the stubborn admiral has refused to listen in totality, for he is not going to strengthen those who want him deposed so dearly. The Hunanese need a guiding light for their protection, and only the ruling caste can provide such a shield in his eyes.\n\nWith any previous attempts to dislodge the delicate balance of Hunan's agricultural sector ending in gentry, or Provincial Assembly, backlash, the ambitions of the new project are utterly unbowed.

The New Armies, as they were otherwise known, fragmented into cliques, split upon provincial alignments.

Fully understanding this concept, the watchful guidance of Governor [HNN.GetLeader] has led to thorough and extensive military reforms, stylised upon the victorious German Eagle.\n\nOwing his loyalties to the Zhili Clique, and before that, Yuan Shikai, the Governor has taken up the mantle of crafting the true representation of the New Armies.

In the same vein however, some believe it is time for Zhao to finally retire, for he has clearly become a spent force politically, and perhaps militarily."

 hnn.117.d: "Following the abrupt departure of Tang Shengzhi and his 8th Army subordinates from the Insurgency Zone, many expected his attempt to secure the Provincial Governorship to end in failure, and for him to return to our lines a cowed dog. Yet, in a climactic surprise, the crafty General secured an alliance with Right Kuomintang leader and commander of the 6th Army Cheng Qian, who had also entered the province at roughly the same time.\n\nFollowing a joint Kuomintang unity campaign against Zhao and other lesser parties, the duo managed to secure a staunch victory, yet it was not destined to be that way. The Yueyang Garrison, the Zhili's vice-grip on Hunan's neck, was inclined to act in a desperate bid to secure Hunan for the Zhili once more, and whilst a brave attempt, the spent forces of the 8th and 6th armies stood no chance against the Zhili onslaught. With their defeat, Yueyang Commander Tang Xiangming declared martial law, the constitution as null, and himself as Governor, to restore order.\n\nFleeing terrible persecution, the party has entered into a fierce debate as to whether they should accept the joint forces of Tang and Cheng, however through the personal intervention of Li Jishen, the two men have been granted their commission unequivocally as a sign of goodwill, much to the anger of [CHI.GetLeader]."

 hnn.118.t: "Tang Xiangming Seizes Hunan!"
 hnn.118.d: "Despite the Kuomintang's attempt to supersede Zhao Hengti's influence within Hunan, the Governor managed to secure a principle victory in the face of their radical revolutionary inflows. Yet, all was not well for Hunan, as despite Zhao's tenure for over a decade, he still had to contend with the Zhili influences within his province. To the east in Guizhou, the likes of Yuan Zuming, with his connections to the Young China Party. To the west, the Hunan Diarchy, under the rule of despots Chen Quzhen and Tian Yingzhao, who have long entrenched their position. Most critically, to the north, was Tang Xiangming, ruling Yueyang as his own personal fiefdom.\n\nUnfortunately for us, it would appear that Zhao could not manage to maintain the control of stability within his province, and as a result Tang Xiangming was spurned to march towards the capital of Changsha, and oust the incumbent Governor in the name of squashing the chaos and incompetence that was plaguing Hunan's administration. With such an act, Tang has opted to cut all previous diplomatic ties with Zhao's allies, including [FROM.GetLeader], and has opted to reorient the province towards his Zhili overlords."

 HNN_end_coalition_tt: "§RWith the power struggle having been made forfeit, the coalitions will shift...§!"
 HNN_champion_effect_tt: "§LAs certain commanders (denoted with the War Hero trait) level up, they will strengthen the influence of their championed faction.§!"

 HNN_utilise_tongmenghui_ties_decision: "Utilise Tongmenghui Ties"
 HNN_utilise_tongmenghui_ties_decision_desc: "Having maintained many contacts with his old tongmenghui allies, Cheng Qian has the ability to call on these contacts to help stem the radical revolutionary tide brought on by the Eighth Army's onslaught. Freedom has only just come to Hunan, and neither he or his allies shall allow Tang Shengzhi to pervert it."

 HNN_rally_moderates_decision: "Rally Moderates"
 HNN_rally_moderates_decision_desc: "Having developed cordial ties with the many disparaged moderates within the defunct assembly, Cheng Qian has begun to bridge the gap between the Kuomintang and its \"Dangwai\", or party outsiders. Not stepping as far as to legally allow their parties to run in tandem with the Kuomintang, Cheng will call on these moderates, and Tan Yankai, to fight against the radical socialists within Tang Shengzhi's camp."

 HNN_reshuffle_magistrates: "Reshuffle Magistrates"
 HNN_reshuffle_magistrates_desc: "With the grand reforms of local administration, the Sixth Army has been granted the opportunity to conduct a series of regular reshuffling of district magistrates. Ostensibly to ensure that they do not land into the hands of the elites, it also serves the purpose of annihilating any socialist tendencies they may develop due to Eighth Army agitprop."

 HNN_deploy_militia_against_socialists: "Deploy Militia Against Socialists"
 HNN_deploy_militia_against_socialists_desc: "He Jian is a fierce anti-socialist, and as such, has no qualms with abusing the capacity that his Peace Preservation office grants him to the detriment of his old socialist allies. By framing various socialist aligned peasants and workers, the militia will see to their arrest and imprisonment. Perhaps unjust, it is necessary to prevent anarchy."

 HNN_ensure_bureaucrat_loyalty: "Ensure Bureaucrat Loyalty"
 HNN_ensure_bureaucrat_loyalty_desc: "The bureaucrats of the old government aren't beholden to the Kuomintang's ideals like those of the Eighth or even the Sixth. By dispensing our cadres to their doors and offices, we shall see to it that they adhere to the Three Principles, or are otherwise, evicted from their positions and replaced with those more... loyal to the Eighth Army."

 HNN_fight_against_reactionaries: "Fight Against Reactionaries"
 HNN_fight_against_reactionaries_desc: "All around us, in the shadows, and out in the open, lies a treacherous web of reactionaries. The previous administration was rife with corruption, leading to a false imitation of democracy. Even now however, the Sixth Army itself seems keen to cooperation with those same reactionaries. It is imperative that we deploy the Eighth army to eradicate all sources of corrupt reaction."

 HNN_hold_peasant_rallies_decision: "Hold Peasant Rallies"
 HNN_hold_peasant_rallies_decision_desc: "Although the Kuomintang stands for all Chinese people, at the end of the day it was through the determination and courage of the peasant that the revolution survived the 1920s. Now the insolent military officials in the Sixth Army arrive to tear apart their livelihoods. They accuse us of radicalism and perverting Dr. Sun's national revolution, however the peasantry remember us as champions of their rights. Harnessing this spirit and belief, let us openly protest the insidious Sixth Army and its benign militarists."

 HNN_mobilise_striking_workers: "Mobilise Striking Workers"
 HNN_mobilise_striking_workers_desc: "Our cooperation with the Chinese Syndicalist Party has enabled us to have extensive connections within the local labour movements. By mobilising the unions within Changsha and Changde, we can strike against the Sixth Army and their moderate allies, for their lack of action to aid the workers within the province. Tackling our mutual enemies with one decisive motion."

 HNN_engage_in_skirmishes_decision: "Engage in Skirmishes"
 HNN_engage_in_skirmishes_decision_desc: "It would appear that our rivals have grown uppity in their desire to get ahead of us. Having backed us into a corner, we must strike back with equal ferocity. Whilst considered extreme by many, light military engagements may be in order. Careful to not overstep, we shall engage in a series of light skirmishes. It pains us greatly, but some sacrifices have to be made to create a revolution. May history and the party forgive us for our sins in the end."
