 RUS_KR_gathering_storm_desc: "Two decades ago, the Russian Empire was shattered, and the old world with it. The White Army marched through blood and ice, and from this victory came the Russian Republic.\nWhat began as a beautiful vision of a free Russia descended into chaos, until in 1934 the legendary terrorist Boris Savinkov rose to power. But as the military grows ever restless and the opposition mounts their final defence against the creeping dictatorship, the Vozhd's position is as uncertain as can be.\nRussia, resurgent and confident, is seeking to carve out her rightful place in the new world that is emerging."

### Parties ###
 RUS_totalist_party: "RKP(b)"
 RUS_totalist_party_long: "Rossiyskaya Kommunisticheskaya Partiya (bolshevikov) (Russian Communist Party (of Bolsheviks))\n§gInitially propelled into great national prominence under Vladimir Lenin's fiery leadership, the Bolsheviks drew support from the most desperate and desolate. But their fall from grace has been grand: they turned against their socialist allies in the Soviets, became synonymous with the Red Terror, and lost many, including Lenin himself, in the revolutionary struggle.\n\nThe battered remains of the Bolsheviks who managed to flee White vengeance established themselves in Paris under the leadership of Yakov Sverdlov, and have since taken part in many revolutions around the world. Under Sverdlov, the party has adhered strictly to the writings of Lenin, and remains critical in its support of the Western revolutions. Despite splits and factionalism, the party core remains dedicated, if diminished and vilified within Russia itself.§!\n"
 RUS_syndicalist_party: "VTsSPS"
 RUS_syndicalist_party_long: "Vserossiysky Tsentralny Sovet Professionalnykh Soyuzov (All-Russian Central Assembly of Trade Unions)\n§gAfter the communists were all but wiped out of Russian political life, those Mensheviks who did not wish to join the RDP or Bolsheviks who had fallen out of contact with the central committee ended up operating through radical labour unions. Constantly at odds with the law, a kernel of the Russian Revolution was kept alive by the grassroots labour movement. As the republic's instability grew, the socialists in the unions grew bolder, eventually being able to gain a majority in the central organisation of Russian labour unions.§!\n"
 RUS_radical_socialist_party: "PSR-Left"
 RUS_radical_socialist_party_long: "Partiya Sotsialistov-Revolyutsionerov (Party of Socialist-Revolutionaries)\n§gFounded in 1902, the Esers are the quintessential Russian party: born out of Narodism and silent Russian villages, too radical, visionary and elusive to ever define properly. Most of all however, the PSR is the party of the rural, distant corners of Russia, with its Left faction including various tendencies of left-Narodism ranging from peasant-based communism to even anarcho-syndicalism.\n\nThe Left-Esers were tolerated by the victors for their rebellion against the Bolsheviks, and a portion of them have even reunified with the right wing of the party to take part in republican politics. However, this was controversial even among the Left-Esers, and as Russian democracy has grown increasingly troubled, they have started to return to their underground roots, taking a leading role in the resistance against Savinkov.§!\n"
 RUS_social_democrat_party: "RDP"
 RUS_social_democrat_party_long: "Radikalno-Demokraticheskaya Partiya (Radical-Democratic Party)\n§gThe Radical-Democratic Party emerged from the Popular Socialist Party under the leadership of Nikolay Chaykovsky in 1923 in a merger with remnants of the Russian social democrats, left partyless after the ban of the RSDRP. The RDP's programme became reformist and Neo-Narodist, denouncing all revolutionary action. But the two halves of the party - the moderate People's Socialists around Aleksandr Titov and the bitter Mensheviks and other remnants of the RSDRP around Vladimir Levitsky - were divided from the start in this marriage of convenience.\n\nAs Russian politics grew more polarised in the 1930s, so did the RDP as the radical faction, with their democratic socialist programme, triumphed over the moderate line. No other party has drawn as much ire from the SZRS Combat Squads as the sole defender of the Reds in Russian politics.§!\n"
 RUS_social_liberal_party: "PSR-Right"
 RUS_social_liberal_party_long: "Partiya Sotsialistov-Revolyutsionerov (Party of Socialist-Revolutionaries)\n§gFounded in 1902, the Esers are the quintessential Russian party: born out of Narodism and silent Russian villages, too radical, visionary and elusive to ever define properly. Most of all however, the PSR is the party of the rural, distant corners of Russia, with its Rightist faction an essentially Narodist one, believing in the cause of the common folk of Russia.\n\nAs a long-term ruling party, the Right-Esers have been dragged through the mud. Many of their supporters were lost to the SZRS' fiery rhetoric as the Esers were forced to make compromises for the sake of national stability. Still, they seek to maintain their principles of liberty, equality and the Russian people - the 'Narod'.§!\n"
 RUS_market_liberal_party: "Kadets"
 RUS_market_liberal_party_long: "Konstitutsionno-Demokratichesky Soyuz (Constitutional-Democratic Union)\n§gThe Constitutional Democrats or Kadets are the archetypical Russian liberals. The KDS unified with a number of smaller centrist and progressive parties in 1921 to consolidate the political centre, and became synonymous with the status quo of the Russian Republic.\n\nThe Kadets are devoid of fire: they seek rational, moderate governance in all matters, and have become the party of the middle class and the wealthier peasantry. The party is broadly divided between social progressive Left-Kadets and national liberal Right-Kadets.§!\n"
 RUS_market_liberal_party_long_tt: "Konstitutsionno-Demokratichesky Soyuz (Constitutional-Democratic Union)"
 RUS_social_conservative_party: "VPP"
 RUS_social_conservative_party_long: "$RUS_social_conservative_party_long_tt$\n§gThe Russian right never really had to contest elections in the imperial times, and ironically, suffered from having the least experience in party politics and mass organisation. The All-Russian Patriotic Party was born in 1926 as conservatives of various parties built a common front, largely around the former Octoberists. The VPP is the party of patriotism, traditionalism and monarchism, with its voter base the strongest in conservative rural regions.§!\n"
 RUS_social_conservative_party_long_tt: "Vserossiyskaya Patrioticheskaya Partiya (All-Russian Patriotic Party)"
 RUS_authoritarian_democrat_party: "SOR"
 RUS_authoritarian_democrat_party_long: "Sobraniye Obyedineniya Rossii (Assembly for Russian Unification)\n§gThe Assembly for Russian Unification is often called by its opponents 'Black Hundreds in a suit', and there is a kernel of truth in this claim. The SOR was formed in 1927 by those monarchists disappointed in the VPP's moderate first programme. Initially a fringe party, the SOR enjoyed a great boost of popularity, and even some high-profile defections, during the tumultuous 1930s. Their anti-democratic traditionalism often resonates with those who dislike the republic, but also can't bring themselves to support Savinkov's brand of Russian ultranationalism.§!\n"
 RUS_paternal_autocrat_party: "Russian Army"
 RUS_paternal_autocrat_party_long: "Rossiyskaya Armiya (Russian Army)\n§gIt was the Russian Army, under dictatorship by Aleksandr Kolchak, that ultimately created the Republic. Kolchak and Kornilov may have given the reins to the civilian politicians, but make no mistake - the military holds considerable political power in Russia, with deep connections to the major parties, and the unspoken threat that the Generals can terminate the republic just like they allowed it to come to be in the first place.§!\n"
 RUS_national_populist_party: "SZRS"
 RUS_national_populist_party_long: "Soyuz Zashchity Rodiny i Svobody (Union for the Defence of the Motherland and Freedom)\n§g'Exceptional people are needed. People who are imbued with love of Russia and who understand the practical needs of the national revolution. Such people will not be swayed by those who oppose their truth and their faith. A time has arrived when we must impose our will and our truth upon others by force'.\n\nThe SZRS is not a mere political party, but a movement: wild and dynamic, riding the tide of history, behind its founder and its self-proclaimed revolutionary prophet, the Vozhd of the Russians, Boris Savinkov. Originally a splinter of the Socialist-Revolutionary Party that broke off in 1923, the movement sees itself as the continuation of all the blood and toil spilled in 1914-1922 - and they are willing to spill more, until the Great Third Russia is fair and free.\n\nFollowing the programme of National Narodism, the SZRS is a party of peasants and veterans, seeing the true Russia in its endless plains. In practice, policies vary, but in principle, the SZRS - or the 'Svobodniks', as they are called by their enemies - never waver. 'Russia will save itself!'§!\n"

Standing broadly for a Leninist platform and for total Soviet supremacy, the party is led by its chief ideologue Yakov Sverdlov, although Mikhail Frunze has also given the party great popularity among the army. Due to the Bolsheviks' history of participation in many revolutions worldwide over the last few decades, the party also demands a total commitment to the World Revolution. Though less popular than the PSR and VST and thus unlikely to form a government on their own, the VKRP has thus far participated vigorously in the Workers' Coalition, with their partners keeping their more authoritarian tendencies in check.\n"

### Focuses ###
 Russia_Focus: "Russian Focus Tree"

 RUS_control_supreme_court: "Control the Supreme Court"
 RUS_control_supreme_court_desc: "With the Opposition Bloc crumbling, the Supreme Court under Vladimir Nabokov stands as one of the few institutional pillars still opposing Savinkov. Fortunately, the reforms of 1935, which aimed to expand the power of the Duma, also allow it to issue a vote of no confidence for the Supreme Court. With an SZRS-SOR majority in the Duma, the judges will have no choice but to surrender to the people's will."

 RUS_savinkov_constitution: "The Savinkov Constitution"
 RUS_savinkov_constitution_desc: "The current Russian Constitution dates back to 1922 and is, in many respects, a cobbled-together relic of Russia's political turmoil. Russia's new Supreme Court, with the blessing of the Duma and State Council, must streamline the Constitution not only into a sounder legal document but also one that recognises National Populism as the embodied will of Russia's many peoples."

 RUS_necessary_revenge: "The Necessary Revenge"
 RUS_necessary_revenge_desc: "It is not a matter of politics, but rather a duty to the Russian people to punish those who misled them and conspired against them. The entire socialist-liberal political elite of the Russian Republic is rotten to the core, only interested in foreign ideologies or personal gain. These men will have to go."
 RUS_remove_SOR_tt: "\n§R§gSOR§! figures will be removed:§!"
 RUS_necessary_revenge_tt: "This focus will fire a series of §Yevents§! that will lower the popularity of non-§nNational Populist§! ideologies."

 RUS_undercut_monarchists: "Crowns from the Eagles"
 RUS_undercut_monarchists_desc: "There is no need to humour Shulgin's SOR any longer now that the new Constitution guarantees both the pre-eminence of the SZRS and Russia's republicanism. Besides, the rumoured connection between elements of the SOR leadership and German business interests is proof that their dedication to Russia's renewal is lacking. Those among the SOR with patriotism and good sense will join Savinkov - the others can enjoy irrelevance."

 RUS_army_commissars: "Army Commissars"
 RUS_army_commissars_desc: "The most visible sign of the SZRS' growing influence in the Army has been the election of the so-called 'Instructor-Volunteers'. Ostensibly chosen for élan and competence, it is an open secret that these Instructors function as Svobodnik evangelists. Savinkov's close ally, Karol Vendzyagolsky, has lobbied incessantly to see this position formalised to strengthen party influence in the ranks, but the Army is decidedly less eager."

 RUS_svobodniks: "Rise of the Svobodniks"
 RUS_svobodniks_desc: "Complicated and ill-defined, the 'Svobodniks' as an organisation trace their origin to the first SZRS, founded to oppose the Bolsheviks in 1918. Since then, they have been everything from terrorists, to street thugs, to labour detachments, to now an increasingly influential paramilitary. With SZRS power entrenched, the time has come to establish a role for the Svobodniks worthy of their unique 'talents'."

 RUS_establish_the_VES: "Establish the VES"
 RUS_establish_the_VES_desc: "With Black Monday wreaking havoc on Russia's economy, the government has called an emergency session to establish an institution capable of meeting the crisis. The proposed 'Supreme Economic Council' will be tasked with drafting plans to combat inflation and unemployment in the short term, alongside long-term plans for economic recovery that will see Russia emerge stronger than ever."

 RUS_begin_land_reform: "Begin Land Reforms"
 RUS_begin_land_reform_desc: "The SR-Kadet land reform programmes were unmitigated disasters that finally collapsed with the Tambov Tragedy. It is not enough to simply recognise or not recognise lands seized in the past - the reforms must rationalise land distribution, and pair this with a robust legal framework and agricultural modernisation programme that can meet peasants' complaints at their source."
 RUS_begin_land_reform_tt: "Depending on our choices in events as the land reform is ongoing, the mission will potentially §Ggrant§! £stability_texticon  §YStability§!, £pol_power  §YPolitical Power§! and §YParty Popularity§!."

 RUS_artelizatsiya: "Artelisation"
 RUS_artelizatsiya_desc: "Trade unions, like syndicalism itself, are foreign imports that seek to destroy the spirit of Russia. The artel is an ancient institution, grounded on sharing tools, workspaces, and profits among volunteer members, who elect their own leaders. The SZRS have been vocal and generous backers for Russia's artels, and their support is invaluable in drawing workers away from the left."

 RUS_voskhod: "The Voskhod Programme"
 RUS_voskhod_desc: "The Voskhod, or 'Sunrise', is less a development plan and more an outright war on Russia's backwardness. With vast swathes of Russians unemployed, the Voskhod aims to mobilise the nation into a vast 'Labour Army'. In return for necessities and eventually, land of their own, the Labour-Soldiers will be dispatched to rapidly industrialise or settle regions across Russia."
 RUS_BM_recovery_tt: "Decisions will §Gimprove§! our §CEconomic Recovery.§!"
 RUS_voskhod_anger: "This focus and the decisions unlocked by it may increase §CPopular Anger§! or §PMilitary Anger§!."

 RUS_fate_of_federalism: "Fate of Federalism"
 RUS_fate_of_federalism_desc: "Russia is a federal state, and shall remain so. However, the SZRS has long tried to extend the president's powers at the regional level. While most of the gubernial Dumas are stuffed with patriots, there needs to be safeguards against local political sabotage."

 RUS_declare_russian_state: "Declare the Russian State"
 RUS_declare_russian_state_desc: "As other political parties have fractured in the face of petty infighting and defections, it has become increasingly clear that the SZRS is the only force capable of uniting and restoring Russia. To weld the people into one single, unconquerable and all-destructive force - this is our aim, our conspiracy, and our task."

 RUS_cult_of_vozhd: "State Cult of the Vozhd"
 RUS_cult_of_vozhd_desc: "The past decades have proven that Russia's democracy is a sham marching to a coward's drum. The SRs and Kadets have soaked their hands in the blood of Tambov's peasants. The RDP are nothing but whitewashed Bolsheviks. The military coddles itself with delusions of standing apart from politics. Only Savinkov, who endured the biting cold of the Northern Ice March to free his Motherland, has the strength to see Russia restored."
 RUS_cult_of_vozhd_tt: "§nThe event will give a choice on how Savinkov portrays himself to the populace and its bonuses.§!"

 RUS_centralise_party: "Enforce Doctrinal Purity"
 RUS_centralise_party_desc: "The SZRS' transformation into a mass party has come with various negatives. In particular, newer ideological strains within it have formed, threatening the unity of the party as a whole. Those who joined the party out of opportunism lack true faith in Russia, and these men will have to go for the party to be Russia's organ."

 RUS_catechism: "Catechism of a National Revolutionary"
 RUS_catechism_desc: "The revolutionary is a doomed man. He has no private interests, sentiments, property, nor even a name of his own. His entire being is devoured by one purpose, one thought, one passion - the revolution. Heart and soul, not merely by word but by deed, he has severed every link with the social order and with the entire civilised world; with the laws and morality of that world. He is its merciless enemy and continues to inhabit it with only one purpose - to destroy it."
 RUS_catechism_tt: "§gDoubles the effect of New Russian Culture.§!"

 RUS_revolution_in_spirit: "Revolution in Spirit"
 RUS_revolution_in_spirit_desc: "The Third Russia is neither Orthodox-Tsarist nor Materialist-Bolshevik. The outdated ideas of organised, hierarchical spirituality must be sidelined in favour of a more dynamic and Symbolist understanding of the eternal Russian spirit and faith. Our task is nothing less than a great eschatological uprising against the modern world."

 RUS_dealing_with_faith: "Ally with the Faith"
 RUS_dealing_with_faith_desc: "Despite the Orthodox Church's support for monarchism, they are undoubtedly an integral part of Russian civilisation. While the SZRS seeks to draw members from all faiths, an alliance of convenience with the Orthodox Church would give us a powerful ally close to the hearts of common Russians."

 RUS_yevraziystvo: "The Eurasian Manifesto"
 RUS_yevraziystvo_desc: "Eurasians are not afraid of contradictions. They know that life is made of them. Eurasians live in oppositions. Russia does not simply belong to the Asiatic East or European West; it has combined elements of both to create its own culture, distinct from the rest of the world. Rather than being alien to the Eurasian spirit as many of Russia's leaders have been, we will embrace our eastern roots, which undeniably form a strong part of Russian culture."

 RUS_national_solidarism: "National Solidarism"
 RUS_national_solidarism_desc: "Societies do not prosper on submission to an all-powerful tyrant, but on the organisation of people through justice, solidarity, freedom and law. At heart, the Russian people have always fought for this society: one based on these principles, of Christian love for one another, not on the basis of class or party."

 RUS_new_russian_culture: "New Russian Culture"
 RUS_new_russian_culture_desc: "The typical Russian man looks into the past, towards Orthodoxy and the traditions that have always shaped the nation; but the new Russian man is different. He looks towards the future, he is a harbinger of modernity, and he is a heroic warrior who leads his people through difficult times. He leaves no room for mediocrity - only absolute dedication to Russia and its people."
 RUS_new_russian_culture_tt: "§nThe outcome is dependent on the events fired during the focus.§!"

 RUS_young_pathfinders: "The Young Pathfinders"
 RUS_young_pathfinders_desc: "The SZRS and its National Populism are grounded on ideals of patriotism, national revolution, and self-sacrifice. This, perhaps unsurprisingly, has skewed its appeal towards the youth from its inception. Karl Gopper, a leading figure in Russian Scouting, has led efforts to unite all youth and cadet groups in Russia under one umbrella organisation, to be deemed the 'Young Pathfinders' and directly subordinated to party leadership."

 RUS_vanguard_of_knights_of_terror: "Vanguard of the Knights of Terror"
 RUS_vanguard_of_knights_of_terror_desc: "Fate has blessed the Russian people with indomitable men to lead them through the storms of history. Ivan the Terrible, Peter the Great, Catherine the Great - and now Savinkov and other heroes of the Civil War. Loyalty to these leaders must be absolute, as is their drive to strengthen Russia. On every level of society, the principle of unquestionable loyalty must be implemented."

 RUS_russian_cause: "The Russian Cause"
 RUS_russian_cause_desc: "The SZRS has traditionally relied on sympathetic junior officers to counteract the scepticism of the military's upper echelons. However, with Savinkov's regime appearing more stable, and with notable successes on the economic front, many fence-sitting officers have warmed up to National Narodism. The Russian path will go through the night and darkness, through blood and death, but it will be the path to a new dawn."

 RUS_gosstrazha: "Gosstrazha"
 RUS_gosstrazha_desc: "The State Guard (Gosstrazha) was abolished in 1927 after having done admirable work in pacifying the country of Bolshevik terrorists. With the Vozhd's order, a new organisation focused on internal stability will be formed, separate from the Ministry of Interior, staffed by true believers in the SZRS' cause, and controlled by the party, not by the military."

 RUS_labour_conscription: "Labour Conscription"
 RUS_labour_conscription_desc: "A bourgeois asks: what can I gain from this? But a true Russian worker asks: what can my Motherland gain from this? Work should benefit the state, as the state benefits the worker."

 RUS_teleological_planning: "Teleological Industrial Planning"
 RUS_teleological_planning_desc: "How could the voter understand the complexity of the national economy? He has neither the means nor the will for it. Therefore, this burden in its entirety will be taken up by the experts of the VES, who will expand their planning prerogatives to various other sectors of public life."
 RUS_central_planning_tt: "Reduces the cost of all Industrial Decisions by £pol_power §G15§!."

 RUS_solidarist_representation: "Corporatist Representation"
 RUS_solidarist_representation_desc: "Will the Russian economy go from the hands of unelected businessmen to the hands of unelected technocrats? This has been a worry of the common Russian, and to soothe it, the Ministry of Finance has decided to found the Committee for Trade, Industry and Artels, where the worker and the engineer both can have their voices heard in matters of their own specialty."

 RUS_economic_organisation_of_eurasia: "Council for Eurasian Assistance"
 RUS_economic_organisation_of_eurasia_desc: "Russia's sphere of influence now stretches far and wide like never before, but we have yet to take full advantage of it. We will harness all of Eurasia's resources to become the most powerful bloc in the world."

 RUS_third_russia: "The Third Russian Revolution"
 RUS_third_russia_desc: "The Third Russia is Savinkov's Übermensch: a new organism, ascended and capable of creating its own values to replace those of the Materialist West. It would live not in honour of the glories of the past but for the necessities of the present, with its gaze fixed upon the great, messianic future. It is the duty of Russia to lead the world into a new age of spiritual enlightenment."

 RUS_savior_of_world: "The Saviour of the World"
 RUS_savior_of_world_desc: "Russia's sacred mission was not just to save itself from the world, but to save the world itself. The hated communist tyranny plots the destruction of all that is holy, making its eradication a simple moral duty. Preparation shall begin for the next and final war, founding a new world through the death of the hero and the beauty of the new dawn after the darkness."
 RUS_codification_of_regime: "Codification of the Regime"
 RUS_codification_of_regime_desc: "The mindless terror must come to an end. The Vozhd has restored Russian power, but the regime cannot solidify itself or compete with the West while continuing such erratic decision-making. Supreme power should be established by the basic laws of the state, not the whims of high-ranking party functionaries."
 RUS_solidarist_minigame_warning_tt: "§cYou may want to have Solidarist-aligned advisors or excess £pol_power §YPolitical Power§! before attempting to oppose the hardliners.§!"
 RUS_ideocratic_principle: "The Ideocratic Principle"
 RUS_ideocratic_principle_desc: "From top to bottom, Russian development must be guided by the one strong guided idea, emulated and set forth by a spiritual class of heroic leaders. In no way should we concern ourselves with the 'practical' or 'material' - only total and unwavering dedication to the idea, and to those who assign it."

 RUS_project_sumerki: "Sumerki"
 RUS_project_sumerki_desc: "For every person who dreams up the electric light bulb, there's the one who dreams up the atom bomb. The Vozhd is one step closer to realising that dream, achieving the ultimate solution to the terror question. Voskhod was the dawn of Russian industrial potential; Sumerki shall bring it to its logical end, creating the weapon to surpass anything the world has yet seen."
 RUS_cleanse_the_party: "Cleanse the Party"
 RUS_cleanse_the_party_desc: "There is no need to humour the infiltrators and opportunists anymore now that the Third Russia has been created anew. The SZRS only needs those who have love for Russia in their hearts and dedication to the Vozhd; and those who do not adhere to these principles must go."
 RUS_national_populist_military: "The Warriors of the Vozhd"
 RUS_national_populist_military_desc: "Many senior officers do not truly heed the Vozhd's word - they continue to view war not in ideological terms, but simply their line of duty. Only those who are truly imbued with our sacred mission and struggle should be those who lead our men into battle. The rest - no matter how many there may be - cannot be trusted to serve Russia."
 RUS_last_rome: "The Last Rome"
 RUS_last_rome_desc: "At the centre of the new world's greatest power is Moscow. We will showcase the grand capital's brilliance with grand modernist construction projects to celebrate the heart of the world, advanced in both spirit and technology."
 RUS_national_labour_system: "A Cure for Modernity"
 RUS_national_labour_system_desc: "The modern world is a world without values - look no further than the spiritual decay of the West. Traditionally, the Orthodox Faith has held Russia's many people together, giving meaning to their lives and work and ensuring that society is based on laws and principles."
 RUS_shepherd_of_nations: "The Shepherd of Nations"
 RUS_shepherd_of_nations_desc: "Like Russia looks after its people, so too does it look after the nations of the world threatened by godlessness and decay. We shall lead the flock, extending protection to all places where atheistic communism is right at their doorstep. Russia is in a special position to lead the civilised world against the darkness, united by faith and reason."
 RUS_shepherd_nations_tt: "Any enemy country: is not an actual major"
 RUS_planification_of_society: "Planification of the Society"
 RUS_planification_of_society_desc: "The Russian organism can only work as well as its organs; decentralised and disconnected, the organism collapses into chaos. Only through further centralisation of the system can the state thrive, and to this end, the VES must come to dominate all aspects of economic life."
 RUS_heiress_of_genghis: "The Heiress of Genghis"
 RUS_heiress_of_genghis_desc: "The Russians are not of the European spirit; they are not weak and pacifist, but they are heirs of the great Khans. The Russian is a conqueror, heir to the heroic and tyrannical spirit of his Mongolian ancestors, whose destiny is to dominate the world, as is his nature."
 RUS_annex_puppet_tt: "We will annex claimed states from our puppet states."
 RUS_third_angel: "Then the Third Angel"
 RUS_third_angel_desc: "The third angel poured out his cup into the rivers and springs of water, and it became blood. And I heard the angel of the waters say:\nRighteous are You, O Holy One, for You have brought these judgments.\nFor they have spilled the blood of saints and prophets,\nand You have given them blood to drink,\nas they deserve."
 RUS_third_angel_tt: "§RDeclares war on all socialist countries of the world.§!"
 RUS_paradise_regained: "Paradise Regained"
 RUS_paradise_regained_desc: "Our movement set out to save Russia; and it has now, after tremendous effort of blood and willpower, been saved. For the first time in all of its history since ancient times, the Slavs are living in harmony - with each other, with their very souls. Finally, they can melt down their swords into ploughs, and build the new Zion on Earth."

### Democracy Tree
 RUS_democracy_restored: "Restoration of Democracy"
 RUS_democracy_restored_desc: "With the 'Vozhd of the Peasants' dead, the National Populist experiment in Russia comes to an end in the most disgraceful fashion. It is time to restore a government subject not to the whims of a self-made dictator, but to the true sovereign - the Russian people."
 RUS_never_another_savinkov: "Never Another Savinkov"
 RUS_never_another_savinkov_desc: "If there is a lesson to be learned from Savinkov's oppression, it is that the separation of powers must always be protected to prevent a slide into tyranny. We will carefully rebalance the division of responsibilities between the President, Duma, and the Supreme Court to make it impossible for any would-be dictator to turn one branch of the government against the other and overpower the entire democratic system."
 RUS_maintain_strong_executive: "Maintain a Strong Executive"
 RUS_maintain_strong_executive_desc: "While many allies in our government want to see a powerless executive to make a transition to dictatorship virtually impossible, it is not something that we can afford. With tensions in the world rapidly heating up, Russia's leader needs some leeway in his usage of power to make sure that petty bickering in the Duma does not harm the interests and security of our country."
 RUS_controlling_the_military: "Loyalties of the Military"
 RUS_controlling_the_military_desc: "In an ideal world, our military would be entirely apolitical and we wouldn't have any reason to doubt their loyalty to the government and the state. Unfortunately, the situation we find ourselves in is far from ideal. The military is ridden with factional conflicts which could potentially threaten the stability of our government. We have to decide if the situation is serious enough for us to take direct action, or if we can avoid the matter entirely."
 RUS_ally_army: "Agreement with the Army"
 RUS_ally_army_desc: "While this view is hated by the left, who see the restoration of democracy as their chance to get back at those who violently opposed the socialist movement during and before the dictatorship, risking a conflict with the military is the last thing an insecure government needs. Instead, we will reach an agreement with them - our generals will receive a large increase in funding, but in return will promise to refrain from political activity."
 RUS_ally_army_tt: "Has national spirit §H$RUS_republic_under_watch$§!"
 RUS_republicanisation_of_army: "Republicanisation of the Army"
 RUS_republicanisation_of_army_desc: "As dangerous as a direct conflict with the military is, their ties with the fallen regime present us with a unique opportunity to conduct a controlled purge and ensure the army is truly committed to the defence of republican and democratic ideals. The more thorough we will be, the better, but we must remain careful - if the generals are pushed too far, they will not hesitate to remove us from power."
 RUS_army_rep_tt: "After the army has been republicanised:"

 RUS_address_the_people: "Address the People"
 RUS_address_the_people_desc: "The restoration of the monarchy has left a great many people disillusioned and angry, as they were hopeful for Russia to stay a republic. They fear that the return of the Tsar signals a rollback of democracy and a return to the pre-1917 oppression. To assuage those fears, the Emperor will address the people on the radio, emphasising the monarchy as a symbol of unity for the Russian people and explaining its role in the country's governance."
 RUS_distribute_honours: "Distribute Civic Honours"
 RUS_distribute_honours_desc: "The restoration of the monarchy would have been impossible without certain people having the will and courage to stand against the self-proclaimed Vozhd. Those people deserve to be recognised in a new Russia - they shall be the recipients the restored 'Order of Saint Andrew the Apostle the First-Called', distinguishing the people loyal to the Crown from the legions of spineless sycophants, and turning them into a new elite in the Empire."
 RUS_distribute_honours_key: "Order of St. Andrew"
 RUS_distribute_honours_tt: "Decorated for bravery and long service by the Emperor."

 RUS_privatisation: "[RUS_privatisation_name]"
 RUS_privatisation_lib: "Privatisation of the State Businesses"
 RUS_privatisation_soc: "Partial Privatisation"
 RUS_privatisation_desc: "In the course of plan 'Voskhod', Savinkov's government created multiple state-owned companies and corporations, which were supposed to be the bedrock of the Russian economy. To manage those monstrous conglomerates, the regime greatly expanded its bureaucratic machine and gave control of the economy to those with dubious political loyalties. This state of affairs will no longer be tolerated, but we've yet to decide how far privatisation will go."

 RUS_crimes_of_the_past: "Crimes of the Past"
 RUS_crimes_of_the_past_desc: "The previous administration didn't concern itself with the legality of many of its actions and decisions, believing that the will of their Vozhd was all the justification they needed. Now that Savinkov is dead, many crimes committed by Svobodnik-aligned bureaucrats, politicians, and paramilitaries are floating up to the surface. Obviously, they can't be left entirely unpunished, but in taking the final decision we have to decide if delivering justice is more important than national stability."
 RUS_press_controls: "Council for Publication Standards"
 RUS_press_controls_desc: "As hard as it is to admit, Savinkov gathered a large and devoted following that did not dissipate with his death. Powerful financiers and industrialists who benefited greatly from the SZRS' economic reforms, peasants who supported their agrarian reform - they will not be happy once we start dismantling the remnants of his fallen regime. To ensure that those people cannot rouse the masses to topple our nascent democracy, certain far-right journals must be permanently shut down."
 RUS_had_first_election: "Russia had its first elections after the Fall of Savinkov."
 RUS_elections: "Election of the State Duma"
 RUS_elections_desc: "The first free elections in Russia liberated from Savinkov's tyranny are extraordinarily important, as the winner will get an opportunity to reshape the restored democracy in accordance with their ideology."
 RUS_socdems: "The Radical-Democratic Party"
 RUS_socdems_desc: "The only active political party brave enough to be uncompromisingly socialist in the country after the Civil War, the Radical-Democrats were swept into power by the dreams of the often-neglected peasants and workers of Russia. They will now get a chance to fulfil their mandate and prove themselves worthy of popular trust - after the political direction of the party is taken. Will they cooperate with the centre, or will they try to build a socialist coalition in power?"
 RUS_soclibs: "The Socialist Revolutionary Party"
 RUS_soclibs_desc: "The Russian people have chosen to return the reins of government to one of the parties that held them before the dictatorship - the Socialist-Revolutionaries. Yet the party no longer shares all of the same goals as they did a few years back. Having shed the extremists from both left and right, the renewed SRs have added a commitment to moderate nationalism and stringent opposition to radicalism to their traditional platform of supporting the workers and peasantry."

 RUS_marlibs_desc: "Of all the parties competing in the recent elections, the Kadets of the Constitutional Democratic Union are the most flexible in their ideology. While committed to centrism and market economics, the Kadets are hardly a unified party, with the different wings pushing for cooperation with other parts of the Russian political spectrum. If any stable governance is to be expected, the KDS will have to decide which ideas of theirs are worth implementing."

 RUS_soccons_vps: "The All-Russian Patriotic Union"
 RUS_soccons_desc: "The victory of the patriots has proven that the people are tired of instability and division that became almost synonymous with liberal governance. The conservatives have their sights on restoring a strong Russian Empire, adapting to modernity but not compromising on its Russian and Orthodox ideals, which are eternal."
 RUS_working_peasant_program: "Working Peasant Programme"
 RUS_working_peasant_program_desc: "Having won our mandate, we must show the Russian people that we are indeed going to fight for the rights of the disadvantaged and oppressed. A working peasant programme would be the best way to do it - we will nationalise more land and lease it to the peasants who have no plots of their own. The flaws of the old land reform will be fixed, and the exploitation of the landless peasants in the countryside will be dealt a significant blow."
 RUS_win_back_peasants_idea: "To the Villages!"
 RUS_win_back_peasants_idea_desc: "As Herzen exclaimed: to the people! To live among Russia's rural people and to fight for their interests, eternally a tenet of the Socialist-Revolutionaries. For too long have the Esers lost their lustre, but to truly win back the peasantry we need to go back to the old motto of the party."
 RUS_progressive_literature_clubs: "Sponsor Progressive Literature"
 RUS_progressive_literature_clubs_desc: "One of the main reasons why democracy in Russia failed to prevent the far-right's rise to power is the political ignorance of its population. People couldn't recognise plain populism for what it was, and would rather trust the Vozhd instead of seemingly out of touch political elites. We will fund the opening of progressive literature clubs across the country in order to allow more people to engage in politics, simultaneously rejuvenating our political class."
 RUS_democratic_education: "Democratic Curriculum"
 RUS_democratic_education_desc: "We can only be confident in a safe and stable future of Russia when democratic values are adopted by the people from school benches. The curriculum of our schools will be changed, and a new subject will be introduced - civic education will ensure that all children understand their place in Russian society, as well as their fundamental rights and responsibilities."
 RUS_radical_democratic_judiciary: "Radical-Democratic Judiciary"
 RUS_radical_democratic_judiciary_desc: "As we learned from Savinkov's attempts to wrest power, the moral character of the nation's highest legal authorities can be all that stands between liberty and slavery. With our revolutionary majority in the Duma, we can appoint judges proven to be friendly to the working class, such as Yevgeny Pashukanis and Viktor Krokhmal."
 RUS_against_radicalism: "Self-Defence of Democracy"
 RUS_against_radicalism_desc: "While all our efforts to promote popular participation in politics are beginning to bear fruit, many years have to pass before the political class is completely replaced. Until that time, our system needs additional safeguards against extremists - by making it more difficult for syndicalists and svobodniks alike to register their parties and acquire funding, we will create a more stable future for Russia."

 RUS_legal_reform: "Judicial Reform"
 RUS_legal_reform_desc: "With our political power mostly secure, we can now turn our attention to the judicial system. Savinkov's dictatorship did not have much respect for it - they abused the old legal framework to their advantage and introduced many new laws that trample over civil liberties. That will have to be fixed - and while we are at it, we will move past the Tsarist legacy and do away with the death penalty, all while ensuring that the new laws are significantly more merciful."
 RUS_second_amnesty: "The Second Amnesty"
 RUS_second_amnesty_desc: "We have to face the truth: socialism can never be built in Russia if we continue to work within the confines of an anti-socialist system imposed on us by the paranoid military. Our campaign for the rejuvenation of the political class can now be used as a pretext to pardon many Bolsheviks and socialists who have been forced to go underground or abroad after the Civil War. We must tread carefully, though - stiff resistance from the military is expected."
 RUS_empower_autonomies: "Empower Regional Autonomies"
 RUS_empower_autonomies_desc: "Since the widespread adoption of Russification policies in the late Empire, Russia has had a very troublesome relationship with its minorities. It contributed significantly to the collapse of Russia during the Civil War, with many choosing to support the Bolsheviks or local independence movements. In order to avoid repeating that fate and create a more stable Russia, we will allow our minorities a generous autonomy in political and cultural matters."
 RUS_elected_officials: "Elected Officials"
 RUS_elected_officials_desc: "Having enshrined the rights of autonomy to the Russian minorities, there is one more step we must take to turn Russia into a more equitable federation. We will introduce free direct universal suffrage on the local level, allowing people to choose their regional heads without oversight from Moscow. Hopefully, such a reform will result in regional heads more interested in solving local problems, rather than ingratiating themselves to their benefactors in the capital."
 RUS_civil_militia: "Civil Militia"
 RUS_civil_militia_desc: "Since imperial times, the Russian army has been a reactionary institution, which the government has often used to enforce their dictatorial rule and to suppress any popular dissent. While we cannot change this state of affairs as of now, we can create a Civil Militia as an auxiliary force to the army - by arming and organising the citizens we will create a counter-balance that in times of political strife will stand with the people against their oppressors."
 RUS_democratisation_of_artels: "Democratisation of the Artels"
 RUS_democratisation_of_artels_desc: "Savinkov's widespread introduction of the artels was meant to deal the final blow to the workers' movement, destroying trade unions and subjugating the workers to an inhumane exploitative management of the state bureaucracy. However, at their core, the artels have remained a useful form of worker-led enterprise. Instead of completely upending the existing system, we can relax the demands levied upon the workers and allow them a real say in workplace management."

 RUS_win_back_peasants: "Win Back Peasants"
 RUS_win_back_peasants_desc: "The key reason behind our failure and Savinkov's rise in 1934 is the loss of confidence of the peasantry. While the SR party enjoyed broad support in the rural regions throughout the 1920s, the loyalty of our most important voting bloc was repeatedly tested by governments failing to resolve land reform, and that loyalty shattered after the suppression of the Tambov uprising. The peasants' worries must be at the top of our priority list - they will give us no second chance."
 RUS_new_russian_capitalism: "New Russian Capitalism"
 RUS_new_russian_capitalism_desc: "With the electoral mandate in our hands, we have to immediately turn our attention to the economy. After overturning many of the SZRS' reforms, it falls to us to establish a new Russian capitalism. The state will remain involved in the economy by creating joint-stock companies and will be responsible for foreign trade, but internally we will rely on small manufacturers, rather than the large conglomerates of the corporatist era."

Savinkov established his own scouting organisation, focused on teaching Russian children nationalism, self-sacrifice, and obedience. We will establish a youth organisation of our own; 'Narodovolets' will teach the children of our nation the core principles of Socialist-Revolutionaries, ensuring that in the future our state will be protected by a powerful republican vanguard."
 RUS_ecumenic_council: "Ecumenic Council"
 RUS_ecumenic_council_desc: "A state does not need to be secular to be democratic - religion is a useful tool in ensuring the stability of our regime against the threat of radical revolution, and there are few reasons for us not to use it. We will take the opinion of religious leaders into account in local governance, all the while preparing to embrace the Patriarch himself in the ruling ministerial class - who can better claim to represent the will of the majority of the Russian people?"
 RUS_labour_democracy: "Labour Democracy"
 RUS_labour_democracy_desc: "We are not as popular as we could be with the Russian workers. The necessity to compromise with the Right-SRs in our party has made many of them disillusioned and led them straight into the arms of the radical socialists. To ameliorate the situation, we will introduce new labour democracy laws - while it won't really introduce democracy to the workplace, workers will be able to elect their representatives to fight for their rights in a constitutional framework."
 RUS_promote_grassroots_business: "Promote Grassroots Business"
 RUS_promote_grassroots_business_desc: "The central place in the new Russian economy we are creating is going to be delegated to the peasantry and small businesses, as they can ensure that economic development will not be constricted to the main industrial hubs, but will be felt in the rural regions as well. To mould our economy to their advantage, we will have to remove export duties for our rural entrepreneurs and guarantee that small businesses have easy access to good credit."
 RUS_all-russian_equality: "All-Russian Equality"
 RUS_all-russian_equality_desc: "One of the major boons resulting from our promotion of equal rights for all Russia's people is a never-before-seen level of national unity and cohesion.

 RUS_banking_act: "The Responsible Banking Act"
 RUS_banking_act_desc: "One of the primary causes behind 'Black Monday' lies with the irresponsible banking system, which has allowed the creation of an economic bubble of speculative investments and easy credit.

 RUS_tripartite_labour_negotiation_desc: "In the years since the Civil War, successive governments failed to address the legitimate issues of the working class, forcing the labour unions to adopt an antagonistic position towards the state. To fix that situation, we will provide the unions with a legally sanctioned platform for labour negotiations under ministerial supervision. It will take some effort to convince them of our good intentions, but the resulting social stability is worth it."
 RUS_future_direction_of_liberalism: "The Future Direction of Russian Liberalism"
 RUS_future_direction_of_liberalism_desc: "The Kadets have always been a divided party, with differences between the different wings always threatening our centrist platform. Recently, the right wing has increased its criticism of the party's leadership, feeling dissatisfied with the continuation of an alliance with the SRs and with the perceived lack of attention given to our patriotic base. We can no longer afford to stay silent - the course of Russian liberalism has to be redefined."
 RUS_republican_constitutional_clubs: "Republican Constitutional Clubs"
 RUS_republican_constitutional_clubs_desc: "The key threat to the cause of liberalism in Russia has always been popular indifference to it. To change that and strengthen our party in the process, we will create Republican Constitutional Clubs - while not officially affiliated with our party, they will loudly advocate for liberal-democratic values, simultaneously serving as recruitment hubs for the Kadets, bringing in people interested in the defence of democratic values and political pluralism."
 RUS_imperial_advisory_council: "Imperial Advisory Council"
 RUS_imperial_advisory_council_desc: "The imperial system is viewed with suspicion by a large part of the Russian democratic movement, as they fear that its reintroduction is just the first step in abolition of all the achievements of the 1917 revolution. To mollify them, we will create the Imperial Advisory Council - a political body including representatives from academia, business, and civil society. It will draw upon the expertise of its members to help chart the political direction of the Empire."
 RUS_balance_of_powers: "Law on Russian Freedoms"

However, the long-pursued policy of economic reliance on Germany had evidently been flawed - it pulled our country into a major economic crisis and allowed the Germans many levers of influence on our politics.

We can achieve that by negotiating an increase in funding for the military in exchange for them tolerating greater political control and indoctrination of the rank and file in Kadet-friendly ideology. Given time, this policy will both strengthen our armed forces and cause their shift away from the far right."
 RUS_unite_kadets: "Unite the Right"
 RUS_unite_kadets_desc: "While the Kadets are a formidable political force on their own, it is almost impossible to freely pursue our own agenda due to the necessity to form coalitions with other parties in the Duma and thereby water down our policies. However, now we may be in a position to change that. There is a powerful faction in the VPP that is in general accord with our ideological stance, and it is open to a possible merger of our parties. If successful, it will immensely strengthen our position."

 RUS_invite_SOR_desc: "The SOR has long represented some of the staunchest pro-monarchy advocates in Russia. Unfortunately, that reputation was irreparably marred by Savinkov's dictatorship - many influential members of the party defected to Svobodniks, leaving it a shell of its former self. However, even their remnants united by Vasily Shulgin can be of some use.

They had rejected the position of the monarch, awarding great power and influence first to the Duma, and when it predictably failed, to a ruthless dictator. Having restored the monarchy, we will provide the impartial Emperor with the necessary tools to steer the ship of state."
 RUS_symphony_of_authorities_republic: "One of the most obvious weaknesses in our political system is the disproportionate influence that was given to the State Duma - its susceptibility to populism has already led the country to fall to a dictatorship once, and we aren't about to let it happen again.

At the same time, it is clear that the extension of governmental support and control to all the religions of the state might be more successful than simple secularism in forging a unified national identity, tying the people to the Russian State no matter their creed. Long-term stability of the country is worth the small pushback we will receive from the right."

 RUS_emperors_life_guard_desc: "The Life Guard was an elite part of the Russian Imperial Army, as their duty was to guard the Emperor and his family. Unfortunately, extreme losses in the Great War, coupled with class restrictions on recruitment of new members, led to a rapid decay of the Life Guards, who became practically nonexistent by 1917. We will recreate those units and open their officer corps to all classes, making personal qualities and loyalty to the Emperor the sole criteria of recruitment."

 RUS_authdems_desc: "The Assembly for Russian Unification is a relatively new party, as it was only formed as the paramount monarchist organisation in 1927. In spite of that, its political history has been quite tumultuous - an alliance with the Svobodniks and their subsequent fall from grace tore the party apart, their monarchist ideals compromised. However, after yet another failure of democratic governance in our state, the SOR might finally get their chance to form a renewed autocracy in Russia."
 RUS_maintain_state_of_exception: "Maintain the State of Exception"
 RUS_maintain_state_of_exception_desc: "The state of exception was introduced to the country shortly after the coup, temporarily suspending many of the civil rights and freedoms in the interests of national security. It also enabled the executive to use the military and martial law for supporting public order in the most troubled regions of the country. Considering the dangerous position we find our country in, this state of exception will have to persist until the stabilisation of prolonged peace."
 RUS_act_of_imperial_prerogative: "Act of Imperial Prerogative"
 RUS_act_of_imperial_prerogative_desc: "The state of exception has proven to be an extremely useful measure, allowing us to swiftly mobilise the nation for war and protect our territories against any ambitious rival. Unfortunately, there are still many enemies surrounding Russia, and we cannot let our guard down. For this reason, through an act of imperial prerogative, His Majesty will be empowered to pass any measures related to foreign policy, defence and appointment of officials without parliamentary approval."
 RUS_organic_democracy: "Organic Democracy"
 RUS_organic_democracy_desc: "In the modern day and age, Russia has to be a democracy to continue its stable development. However, we cannot simply follow the lead of the major Western democracies and copy their political systems, as they have proved to be highly susceptible to syndicalist revolutions. Our organic democracy will take into account national traditions and the historically central role of the monarchy, establishing a system far more resistant to any shocks than anything the leftists propose."
 RUS_national_capitalism: "National Capitalism"
 RUS_national_capitalism_desc: "Just like our political system, the economy ultimately has to serve the interests of the security of the state. However, it is best achieved in cooperation with the leading industrialists of the country, rather than in opposition. We will closely cooperate with them, allocating generous government credit and investment to the projects of national importance. At the same time, we will improve our heavy industry and allow our businessmen to grow richer."
 RUS_reasonable_autocracy: "Reasonable Autocracy"
 RUS_reasonable_autocracy_desc: "Our state may have common features with authoritarian regimes, but make no mistake: we are not some barbarous terrorist regime, but a responsible and sensible one. Autocracy is merely a tool to preserve life, peace and order, not an end in itself."

 RUS_NMD: "Rally the People's Monarchists"
 RUS_NMD_desc: "There is no shortage of ideas on how the restored Empire should be reorganised. Some would like to return to the times before 1917, while others would be content with a ceremonial monarchist smokescreen covering traditional republican institutions. However, Ivan Solonevich has his own vision of the best system of governance for Russia. He needs capital and votes to implement it, and he can gather them by organising a front of the Russian right."
 RUS_NMD_tt: "The People's Monarchist Movement will encompass the §cSocial Conservative§!, §gAuthoritarian Democrat§!, and §PPaternal Autocrat§! ideology slots."
 RUS_plague_of_democraticism: "The Plague of Democraticism"
 RUS_plague_of_democraticism_desc: "Russian intelligentsia has been worshipping the West and their political systems since the 19th century, idealising 'democracies' in France and the United Kingdom. This habit played an important role in delegitimising the old Empire and causing the revolutions in 1917, as well as the catastrophic defeat in the Great War. Transplanting an English political system to Russia would never work; we will begin rolling it back by strengthening the imperial power."

 RUS_evolved_but_untamed: "Evolved, but Untamed"
 RUS_evolved_but_untamed_desc: "The defeat in the Great War, coupled with the collapse of Svobodnik ideology, has caused a massive disillusionment with patriotism and nationalism. This problem has to be solved posthaste, as a new world conflict is upon us. Using school curricula, state propaganda, and new historical movies, we will focus all attention on the glorious victories that were achieved under the banner of the Tsar. Russians are the best warriors in history - they should never forget that."
 RUS_denounce_elites: "The Plague of Elitism"
 RUS_denounce_elites_desc: "Many on the right secretly despise the vast majority of our working people. They are considered to be ignorant brutes, who cannot be trusted to govern themselves, believing instead that all the power should belong to the westernised, wealthy elite. To Solonevich, this is intolerable - he dreams for every person in this nation to control their OWN destiny. Our return to the democracy of old Muscovite times will begin with a reorganisation of the Duma on a corporatist basis."
 RUS_healthy_body_healthy_mind: "Healthy Body and Healthy Mind"
 RUS_healthy_body_healthy_mind_desc: "The best political system in the history of Russia was achieved during the times of the traditional Muscovite samoderzhaviye - a monarchist system that afforded a great deal of self-government to the simple people, while letting the Tsar protect his people from enslavement to the country's elites or to any foreign threats. To gain the ability to rebuild it we will have to spend significant investments on uplifting the peasantry - aiming to have a healthy society in the long term."
 RUS_duma_of_best_minds: "Dictatorship of Conscience"
 RUS_duma_of_best_minds_desc: "The current state of our Duma is a disgrace. Great power is still given to professional politicians - crooked charlatans, who spend all their time on petty intrigue and fighting for votes in a never-ending quest for personal power.

We cannot reverse two centuries of aping the worst excesses of vestigial Western feudalism in just a few years, but we have laid a solid foundation for a political system that can lead to the greatest period of peace and prosperity in centuries.

 RUS_escaping_the_cycle: "Escaping the Cycle"
 RUS_escaping_the_cycle_desc: "Russia has for centuries been known as a forerunner of autocracy. This is finally beginning to change - the Russian nation will be known not as a backwater or failed regime, but as the power that defeated German imperialism and became the protector of free Europe. That will be the legacy of modern Russia - may it shine forevermore."

 RUS_first_party_of_russia_desc: "The past few years have shown that Russian democracy is strong, but even democracies need a modicum of stability. The [RUS.GetRulingParty] has shown that it is capable of making Russia into perhaps Europe's strongest power, of accomplishing feats that Russia never has before. It is only right that future generations know this fact, and its political influence entrenched at every level."
 RUS_european_policeman: "European Policeman"
 RUS_european_policeman_desc: "Russia is not just a friend to many of Europe's nations, but an elder brother, one who watches over the little brother for their sake.

 RUS_demobilisation: "Demobilisation"
 RUS_demobilisation_desc: "The Great Patriotic War has left Russia with a vast army standing victorious over the remains of Germany's hegemony over Europe, a vast army full of many soldiers who simply wish to return to their homes. Conscription will be decreased as wartime industries shift back towards their peacetime production."
 RUS_catch_up_with_west: "Catch up With the West"
 RUS_catch_up_with_west_desc: "For long, Russia's industry lagged behind the states of the West despite great strides made in the push for industrialisation.

 RUS_reward_veterans: "Reward the Veterans"
 RUS_reward_veterans_desc: "While the Great War may have ended with catastrophic consequences despite the valiant efforts of the army, the Great Patriotic War has left the Russian army finally victorious.

 RUS_economic_harmonisation: "Build a Better Europe"
 RUS_economic_harmonisation_desc: "The exploitation brought by German dominance after Brest-Litovsk and the destruction brought by the Great Patriotic War have left much of Europe and the reclaimed territories in ruins.

Even petty intellectuals and writers, who have never struck the heart of reaction once in their life, now occupy top positions! It is no wonder that the party has become infected with bourgeois filth. We will denounce these notions everywhere they go, lest we capitulate to reformism and decadence."

 RUS_great_labour_republic: "The Great Labour Republic"
 RUS_great_labour_republic_desc: "The goal of socialism is to empower the working man in his duty to provide for the people. It naturally follows that those who are able-bodied and do not work will not benefit from socialism, and that is how it should be: our Russian republic is a republic of labour, not of parasitism."
 RUS_dictatorship_of_the_peasantry: "Dictatorship of the Toilers"
 RUS_dictatorship_of_the_peasantry_desc: "Russia is not a greatly industrial country like Germany or Britain. But it is not necessarily a primitive agrarian one either, and Russian capitalism was not as destructive as those in the industrial countries. In recognition of this fact, though we exalt the peasant spirit, state power is truly exercised by all labouring people, not just the peasants or industrial workers."
 RUS_triumph_of_the_idea: "Triumph of the Idea"
 RUS_triumph_of_the_idea_desc: "Many are already predicting the doomsday of the socialist revolution, where the SRs will come crashing down and usurped by counter-revolutionary forces. But we will rise as many times as we have to, and the future does not frighten us. What we fight for is worth everything to us, and it shall continue until we are victorious!"
 RUS_if_triumph_of_idea_tt: "If we are at war with the §YGerman Empire§! when this focus completes:"

 RUS_future_for_the_rural_regions: "Future for the Rural Regions"
 RUS_future_for_the_rural_regions_desc: "Land reform has been carried out by previous Russian regimes, but outside of that, the countryside still lags behind the industrial centres greatly. In some cases, it seems as if some of our peasants are living in the past century! Of course, this will not stand."
 RUS_socialist_education_in_the_countryside: "Socialist Education in the Countryside"
 RUS_socialist_education_in_the_countryside_desc: "Usurpers and reactionaries - like Savinkov, for example - love it when the people are too stupid to know what they are voting for. But with proper education, the peasants too shall know their rights and how to organise themselves in a comradely and socialist manner. Decades of reactionary and conservative propaganda will not be whisked away in one day, but it is a step forward to create a more revolutionary peasantry."
 RUS_russian_socialism: "True Russian Socialism"
 RUS_russian_socialism_desc: "You cannot import a foreign system and expect to have rule by the people. This fact goes for Russia too, and it is why you cannot simply import Western-style syndicalism from the French and expect it to work. Ultimately, that is why the SRs are here to stay: we are with the people and shall follow them wherever they go."
 RUS_psr_conference_tt: "The 1939 party conference of the PSR has taken place."

 RUS_second_stage_of_revolution: "The Second Stage of Revolution"
 RUS_second_stage_of_revolution_desc: "Blood, sweat, and tears have been shed for this very future, that of the second stage of revolution. Now that capitalism in Europe has fallen, and the world is sure to follow, what better time than now to chase the socialism that the people have always dreamt of?"
 RUS_steady_as_she_goes: "Steady as She Goes"
 RUS_steady_as_she_goes_desc: "We are not like the Maximalists, whose violent and authoritarian methods would ruin the transition to the second stage of revolution. Only through a moderate course can Russia reach that stage, even if the enemies of Russia are now few and far between."
 RUS_democracy_of_one_dream: "The Democracy of One Dream"
 RUS_democracy_of_one_dream_desc: "The past few years have undoubtedly confirmed that the Workers' Coalition was the reason for the success of the socialist revolution. With recent splits in their party, the VST can only become more amicable to us, and we can work together towards a greater future."
 RUS_mercy_for_the_damned: "Mercy for the Damned"
 RUS_mercy_for_the_damned_desc: "There is no reason to continue the oppression of the years past. At the time it was necessary; socialism in Europe was on a knife's edge, and could have been destroyed by foreign reactionary powers. But these worries are all but gone now, and only by building a Russia free of the oppression that came before it can all of its people appreciate what socialism has brought to Russia."
 RUS_uncompromised_idealism: "Uncompromised Idealism"
 RUS_uncompromised_idealism_desc: "Full steam ahead! The Russia of the twentieth century knows no better word than 'revolution'. Today we bring forth the second stage of revolution, revered by all those who dream of liberty."
 RUS_dismantle_crystals_of_power: "Dismantle the Crystals of Power"
 RUS_dismantle_crystals_of_power_desc: "Little by little, the power of the state is withering away, and Russian society is being anarchised. The Spiridonovist vision has always been that of a truly decentralised Russia - workers organising themselves through soviets and unions, not through the central government. All of the party's actions shall be devoted to the realisation of this ideal."
 RUS_an_end_to_enmity: "An End to Enmity"
 RUS_an_end_to_enmity_desc: "The Workers' Coalition was certainly useful for progressing towards socialist democracy, but we understand well that one day it will no longer be necessary. The dominance of the PSR will ensure that the transition to a Russia without the need for parliamentarism or partisanship will be a smooth undertaking."
 RUS_a_revolutionist_by_love: "A Revolutionist by Love"
 RUS_a_revolutionist_by_love_desc: "'Their hatred and contempt for human oppression ran so deep, had so suffused their entire being, that their dream was the overturn of the throne not only for themselves, but for all. When, in that rare moment, their liberation dawned, they rose with faces lit by an inner glow so as to destroy all thrones - for all and forever. The rebellious slaves sought no new masters, but man'."
 RUS_a_revolutionist_by_compassion: "A Revolutionist by Compassion"
 RUS_a_revolutionist_by_compassion_desc: "'The great majority dove into the stormy waves of revolution not for their own sakes, but for the sake of others, for their suffering fellow men, for mankind as a whole. A man of 'insulted honour' and 'wounded conscience' could not ignore the coercion and the wanton cruelty perpetrated in his sight. His sense of human dignity was tormented by the knowledge that an entire people lay submissive in the dust'."

 RUS_ascendance_of_the_cult_of_action: "Ascendance of the Cult of Action"
 RUS_ascendance_of_the_cult_of_action_desc: "The Maximalists rose to the top for one reason only: because we took action and gained the trust of the people. The wartime measures may now be coming to an end, but that does not mean we plan to give up power - quite the contrary. Today we make our mark on history, for Russia and for socialism."
 RUS_mantle_of_the_srs: "Mantle of the Esers"
 RUS_mantle_of_the_srs_desc: "Once considered just another faction of the big-tent PSR, now the Maximalist programme defines and sets forth the programme for all of the Esers. Still, despite the ruinous mistakes of those who belonged to our party, we will wash away their crimes from the history books. The history of the Narodnik movement, the Socialist-Revolutionary party, shall be that of the Maximalists and their great victories."
 RUS_last_narodniks_trait_tt: "Every remaining §RSR§! or §oSR (Maximalist)§! advisor will gain the trait §YLast of the Narodniks§!, which grants:\nDaily Totalist Support: §G+0.03§!\nWeekly Stability: §G+0.10%§!"
 RUS_the_maximalist_constitution: "The Maximalist Constitution"
 RUS_the_maximalist_constitution_desc: "The previous constitution was a compromise between the SR party, which no longer exists in its current form, and the VST. As of today, that shall no longer be the case. The constitution shall serve all of the working people of Russia, not the foolishness of the parties who sought their own selfish gains."
 RUS_turn_puppets_totalist_tt: "All of our puppet states that aren't already §oTotalist§! will have their government changed."
 RUS_maximalist_flag_tt: "§CThe flag will change, so as to fit the mantra of revolutionary Russia.§!"
 RUS_cast_out_western_agents: "Cast Out Western Agents"
 RUS_cast_out_western_agents_desc: "Reports have come out that our former allies are now directly plotting against us, ready at will to act on the orders of Paris and Berlin. We knew this day would happen, the day the trade unionists and Bolsheviks would backstab Russian socialism as it was meant to be. They will find that we were more prepared for them than they thought."
 RUS_a_steady_end_to_partisanship: "A Steady End to Partisanship"
 RUS_a_steady_end_to_partisanship_desc: "Have the past years not shown how harmful political parties are to Soviet democracy? For years we could not act upon this fact, but the Party of Socialist-Revolutionaries is now solely the party of Maximalists. And with that, we will deliver on our word: this party is no more. In its place will be something new, which will serve the people as the Maximalists have always promised."

 RUS_invite_zeller: "Invite Zeller"
 RUS_invite_zeller_desc: "The Socialist-Democratic Union is seen as a holdout of the reactionary RDP by many, but it does command the loyalties of many better-off workers and small business owners, especially in Southern Russia. Its new leader, the charismatic Gergard Zeller, is a socialist of the most lukewarm shade, but certainly understands the value of cooperation - it is time to formally invite him to the council of ministers and his party to the Workers' Coalition."
 RUS_small_business_primacy: "Cooperative Businesses"
 RUS_small_business_primacy_desc: "Instead of full nationalisation or trade union management, we should encourage the growth of cooperatives. The organisers of cooperatives are the most advanced cultural elements of the proletariat we have, and in an undeveloped country such as ours they can take in the peasantry and absorb the remnants of small business. Let cooperatives prove the superiority of a socialised economy and stimulate its voluntary acceptance!"
 RUS_social-narodism: "Social-Narodism"
 RUS_social-narodism_desc: "While the narodnik movement was never a Marxist one, its lessons of democratic socialism and progressive nationalism should not be overlooked. Today, our chief allies are the PSR and the SDS, both influenced by narodism. Cultural development incentives and welfare programmes will ingratiate us with the narod that they so cherish."

 RUS_self_determination: "Self-Determination of Peoples"
 RUS_self_determination_desc: "The reactionary nationalist White movement sought to oppress Russia's brotherly nations, denying them the ability to pursue national self-determination and seek their own path. However, the international workers' struggle does not care for such chauvinistic tendencies. We will walk a different path, one that emphasises self-determination for all."
 RUS_eastern_vanguard: "The Eastern Vanguard"
 RUS_eastern_vanguard_desc: "Revolutionary Russia immediately became one of the major powers of the Third Workingmen's International. As natural leaders of the socialist cause in Eastern Europe, we shall represent the interests of peoples there, and will not cease our struggle until they are free!"
 RUS_spreading_the_revolution_threat: "Spreading the Revolution"
 RUS_defencism: "Defencism"
 RUS_defencism_desc: "The war effort in the now faraway 1917 was by no means doomed - it was defeatism that brought the Russian socialist effort to ruin. Still, today, we have the moral duty to defend our Belarusian and Ukrainian comrades still languishing in their slavemaster's prisons. We have not given up on them since then just as we did not give up on our fellow Russians."
 RUS_comrades_abroad: "Our Comrades Abroad"
 RUS_comrades_abroad_desc: "Not long ago, Russia stood as a bastion of imperialism, its name almost synonymous with exploitation and misery. This centuries-old pain has finally ended, extinguished by the flame of the Revolution. However, beyond the frontier, millions of our comrades still lie in bondage. Instead of abandoning our past victims like in 1918, we shall redeem ourselves by aiding their struggle for liberation, as it is our responsibility and our struggle too. Freedom knows no borders."
 RUS_our_comrades_abroad_tt: "Having either §YVladimir Karelin§! or §YYevgeny Sattel§! hired as an advisor will increase our max volunteer limit to these countries by §G+2§!."

 RUS_each_according_ability: "From Each According to His Ability"

 RUS_pool_armour_innovation: "Pool Armour Development"

On the side, our generals and engineers will exchange ideas to improve our armour technologies."
 RUS_american_revolution: "Red Stars Shining"
 RUS_american_revolution_desc: "Our comrades in America are struggling for their liberty and freedom, like we were in 1918. We owe them much for their support in the darkest years of Tsarist oppression, and now it is time to repay that."
 RUS_liberate_central_asia: "Liberate Turkestan"
 RUS_liberate_central_asia_desc: "Formerly part of Russia, the plains and deserts of Turkestan have since fallen to despotic Khans and their militant hordes. To bring socialist leadership to these lands wouldn't just be an act of self-defence on our part, but also an act of liberation for the downtrodden that live under the yoke of these warlords."
 RUS_prepare_march_of_liberation: "Prepare the March of Liberation"
 RUS_prepare_march_of_liberation_desc: "There is much to be done until Russia is ready for the great war of our time, one to slay the Kaiser's hydra once and for all. Fortifications, military industry, all of it is needed in our upcoming attempt to save Eastern Europe from despotic Teutonic rule. "

 RUS_anti_capitalist_warfare: "The War to End All Wars"
 RUS_anti_capitalist_warfare_desc: "By inciting the Revolution in 1917, the imperialists were digging a grave. What they did not know is that they would be the ones to lie in it. Today, having shaken off all its shackles, Russia stands righteously, stronger than ever. The time has come for us to finally eradicate the regime in Berlin, this time not for the Tsar and not for the double-headed eagle, but for the freedom of the common working man, Russian and German alike. We shall break the chains forevermore."

 RUS_turn_south: "Southern Frontier of the Revolution"
 RUS_turn_south_desc: "To Russia's south, there is much work to be done to accomplish the world revolution. The old reactionary regimes have stuck to their superstitious ways, and it is time they are liberated from their slavemasters once and for all."
 RUS_rival_west: "Rivals to the West"
 RUS_rival_west_desc: "While we have served well as part of the Western socialist alliance, the counter-revolutionary threat has been subdued, and it is time we choose our own path. For too long has Russia played second fiddle to the west, our comrades disregarding our unique way to socialism. We will prove them wrong: Russia's role is not to be subservient to the West, but to rise above it."

Yet for all its destruction, in the latter something truly beautiful blossomed: capitalism has fallen, Europe has been liberated. Today we will take our comrades in the West hand-in-hand and build the future of thousands of fallen dreamers."

 RUS_heir_of_world_revolution: "The First and the Last Revolution"
 RUS_heir_of_world_revolution_desc: "It was in Russia where the flames of the proletarian revolution first arose. The chance for World Revolution was almost upon us, but it was lost. Now the time has come again, with Russia standing as the leader and protector of the Third Workingmen's International. It was only thanks to the strength of the Russian proletariat's spirit and inner flame that an abyss was avoided, and the torch was returned to where it originates from."

 RUS_socrus_spies: "The Red Spider-Web"
 RUS_socrus_spies_desc: "The international socialist movement reached its peak when Moscow joined the arms of revolution. Now dissidents from all over imperial Europe are beginning to prepare for their eventual liberation. We will reach out to them accordingly."
 RUS_vision_for_union: "A Vision for Our Union"
 RUS_vision_for_union_desc: "From [202.GetName] to [206.GetName] and beyond, Russia has liberated huge swathes of territory. The labour republic system has served us well so far in respecting national autonomy while pursuing economic integration, but with the German threat gone, it may well be possible that it will go under some changes. Towards a self-sufficient economic bloc centred around Russia or even becoming a supranational union - let the future take us where it will."
 RUS_develop_poorer_republics: "The Advancement of Poorer Republics"
 RUS_develop_poorer_republics_desc: "Turkestan has never been a priority for the Russian state, despite for a long period of owning much of it either directly or by proxy. Partially as a result, the lands there have continued to be underdeveloped compared to much of the land west of it. To develop them will be a tall task, but one we will begin in no time."
 RUS_rebuilding_liberated_lands: "Rebuild the Liberated Lands"
 RUS_rebuilding_liberated_lands_desc: "The Great Patriotic War destroyed homes, factories, and the farmer's land all the same - in no small part because the nationalists and imperialists would rather destroy their whole country than see socialism prosper. Nonetheless, the whole of Eastern Europe bore the brunt of this destruction, and extensive reconstruction efforts must be underway."
 RUS_union_of_peoples: "A Union of Peoples"
 RUS_union_of_peoples_desc: "The founding congress of the Union of Socialist Labour Republics laid the groundwork for national self-determination and further economic cooperation between the peoples of Europe. At the time, it had little power, but with the war over, we can pursue a common relationship with the free socialist republics. Down the line, this harmonious cooperation will lead to peace, equality, and the abolition of the state."
 RUS_expansion_of_union: "Expansion of the Union"
 RUS_expansion_of_union_desc: "Member states of the Union of Socialist Labour Republics have mainly been limited to those who once belonged to the Russian Empire. As the system was in its infancy, this was a temporary measure to experiment with the efficiency of the Union. Now, we have the opportunity to abandon these limitations and create new sister republics for the common good."
 RUS_increased_devolution: "Devolution of Authority"
 RUS_increased_devolution_desc: "To truly gain the trust of our compatriots and establish a long-term relationship, allowing them to direct economic matters in a dispersed manner will greatly benefit future prospects. Together with our assistance, no village or town will be left to economically linger behind."
 RUS_peoples_union: "A People's Union"
 RUS_peoples_union_desc: "One of the main stated goals of the Union of Socialist Labour Republics was to abandon nationalist tendencies and the abolition of states altogether. While the dream of a world socialist federation is likely still far away, we have the opportunity to lay the groundwork for it. Russia, once and always a diverse country, is one of the best-suited places to begin this process."
 RUS_centralise_authority: "Centralise Federal Power"
 RUS_centralise_authority_desc: "There are many programmes of progress and prosperity planned for the immediate future, both in the centre, periphery and beyond. However, if it is to be delivered effectively and in a timely manner, all speed bumps and barriers must be broken through with the full force of the state to ensure its success."
 RUS_coordinate_development: "The Coordination"
 RUS_coordinate_development_desc: "The Second Great War left the economies of Eastern Europe ruined, and the current system doesn't allow for the proper integration necessary to rebuild it. For this reason, as well as to push for the eventual uniting of the world through a single socialist family, the labour republics shall unite into a single state, to coordinate development, defence, and in the future, a post-scarcity economy."

 RUS_syndicalists: "All-Russian Union of Labour"
 RUS_syndicalists_desc: "The VST's ascension vindicated the martyrs of 1905, 1917, and the Civil War, but now the time has come for the formation of a council of ministers of the new Socialist Republic. Despite the mood of triumph in the air, the party is deeply divided, and forming a government acceptable to all wings of the party will test Chairman Levitsky's political acumen - or perhaps even see him removed from power altogether."

 RUS_science_of_marxism: "The Science of Marxism"
 RUS_science_of_marxism_desc: "Marxism is based on the understanding that history and its accompanying social consciousness are really the history of empirical social relations of production, relations that have hitherto constantly evolved based on changing forms of production and co-operation. Ascending from earth to heaven, we understand the true material premises of all morality, religion and philosophy. Let us educate Russia in this, and dispel superstition."
 RUS_encourage_innovation: "Socialism Through Innovation"
 RUS_encourage_innovation_desc: "To truly unleash the intellectual power of the masses, we must reorganise the education system to truly encourage innovation and cooperation. The universities will thus be reorganised along the lines of Soviets of Students and Teachers, allowing full freedom of thought and experimentation."
 RUS_healthcare_reform: "Eradication of Disease"
 RUS_healthcare_reform_desc: "Modern advances in science combined with workers' power are by themselves more than enough to ameliorate the suffering of the masses. Our healthcare system, developed thanks to comrades such as Nikolay Semashko, will be state-run, centralised, and equally distributed throughout the country, ensuring an acceptable quality of life for all citizens."

 RUS_eser_deal_maximalist: "Negotiate with the Maximalists"
 RUS_eser_deal_kamkov: "Ally with the Kamkovites"
 RUS_eser_deal_desc: "The Party of Socialist-Revolutionaries has an inherently questionable understanding of socialism - most of their rank disparage Marxism with their exaltation of the peasantry and their beliefs in agrarian socialism, but regardless we are stuck with them. We will reach out to ideologically compatible Esers in the hope of forming a more durable arrangement."

 RUS_municipalisation_of_farms: "Municipalisation of Farms"
 RUS_municipalisation_of_farms_desc: "During the 1906 'unity congress', municipalisation was taken as the policy of the RSDRP, largely thanks to Menshevik support. We should revive this proposal for modern times; ownership of the land will be transferred to organs of local self-government who will grant land to the use of the peasant in perpetuity. This will greatly mend our relations with the peasantry after so much animosity, and also with their leadership in the PSR."
 RUS_agrarian_industrialisation: "Agrarian Industrialisation"
 RUS_agrarian_industrialisation_desc: "A war on hoes has been declared. Our agriculture continues underperforming because of archaic methods and tools. Grain is a valuable commodity for export, and the increase in labour productivity drives the peasant from the farmland and into our true social base, the proletariat. Let us introduce mechanisation into all fertile regions by any means available. The PSR will protest, but they protest against an inevitability."
 RUS_worker_and_peasant: "Union of Worker and Peasant"
 RUS_worker_and_peasant_desc: "While we are far from accepting the narodnik heresy of a peasant route to socialism, it is undeniable that the Russian revolution has been shared by the peasant and proletarian. It was this alliance alone that toppled the Tsar, Savinkov, and, in the coming years, the Kaiser. While we accept that as long as commodity production remains, smallholding cannot end the poverty of the masses, for now we must accept concessions to the peasantry to maintain our alliance - our Smychka."

 RUS_mensheviks: "The Danists"
 RUS_mensheviks_desc: "Named for their leader, veteran Menshevik Fyodor Dan, the right wing of the VST broadly stands for the broadening of revolutionary politics and a cautious economic transition to socialism. Radicalised by the brutality of the 20s and the Savinkov dictatorship, many former Mensheviks, as well as a few more compromise-minded former Bolsheviks, have found themselves among their numbers."
 RUS_socialism_through_democracy: "Socialism Through Democracy"
 RUS_socialism_through_democracy_desc: "We should not abandon the ideals of Social-Democracy. What this means is that socialism as the economic order and democracy as the political order should be our double goal, the two parts organically merged. We should strengthen the elements of formal democracy within the VST, ensuring that we can lean on a broad proletarian and peasant mass through universal, equal, direct and secret suffrage."

 RUS_minorities_associations: "Cultural-National Associations"
 RUS_minorities_associations_desc: "The oppression undergone by the whole mass of the working class in Russia was like none other - and yet still, Jewish workers suffered not only from a lack of economic and political freedom, but indeed the most basic of civil rights. No longer shall this be endured; the time has come for the liberation of all workers, regardless of nation or religion.

 RUS_reject_state_terror: "Rejection of State Terror"
 RUS_reject_state_terror_desc: "The use of terror can only ever hasten the destruction of democracy and lead to lawlessness and famine. The VST must entirely renounce terror and guarantee all essential political freedoms, including the total restoration of freedom of speech, assembly, association, and the press. We will also begin immediately to phase out the VGPU and return to the principles of democratic legality. Unlike others, we can tolerate opposition."
 RUS_empower_local_soviets: "Empower Regional Soviets"
 RUS_empower_local_soviets_desc: "Regional autonomy, particularly for ethnic and religious minorities, is one of the cornerstones of our Socialist Republic. Where once archaic parliamentary structures or imperial diktats stood in the way of representation for Russia's minorities, now, thanks to Soviet and Union Democracy and a high degree of autonomy, they are truly free to rule themselves."
 RUS_white_parties: "United Front of the Democratic Parties"
 RUS_white_parties_desc: "We remain committed to the proletariat, which can only strengthen its position when it consolidates its political forces, not in class organisations separated from other strata, but rather in national bodies. To save Russia on a revolutionary-democratic basis and avoid the unequalled tyranny of 1918, we should radically expand the Workers' Coalition, forming a government of national unity with the progressive strata of the bourgeoisie and middle-class intellectuals."
 RUS_4_year_plan: "First 4-Year Plan"
 RUS_4_year_plan_desc: "Instead of relying on the mechanisms of the market, socialism requires new ways of expanding the means of production. We shall set up a council that will work with all elements of the economy to set production goals. These goals will be determined across a four year period and be reviewed annually to check the productivity of all firms and ensure all are receiving their necessary inputs, being revised where necessary."

 RUS_new_russian_socialism: "New Russian Socialism"
 RUS_new_russian_socialism_desc: "While we are all for the eventual establishment of social property, this cannot be done in all branches of industry at the same time. A very advanced state of capitalism is required to entirely substitute socialist production for capitalist production. Until then we must continue to increase the productivity of labour and expand capital through market mechanisms and cooperatives, and even tolerate reasonable and conscientious employers."
 RUS_social_solidarity: "Social Solidarity"
 RUS_social_solidarity_desc: "Here in Russia we are creating a true free association of producers on the only basis it can be created - a voluntary one, without the folly of minority dictatorships imposing their maximalist utopias. We should not stop here.

 RUS_internationalists: "The Internationalists"
 RUS_internationalists_desc: "Named for their adherence to the Third Internationale's Syndicalist Synthesis, the Internationalists are the centre of the VST. Calling for shared power between Soviets and Unions, the Internationalists champion the Workers' Coalition and are mainly focused around the personalities of Levitsky and Sulimov."
 RUS_workers_coalition_dialogue: "Inner-Party Dialogue"
 RUS_workers_coalition_dialogue_desc: "Chairman Levitsky's formation of the VST and the Workers' Coalition was a monumental achievement, but much like the revolution itself, vigilance is needed to ensure the Party's survival. Carefully balancing the interests of the different factions of the party itself is essential - connections with both the Left and Right must be made if we are to maintain revolutionary unity."
 RUS_chamber_of_unions: "Establish the Congress of Unions"
 RUS_chamber_of_unions_desc: "Contrary to the example of 1917, the British and French have shown the power of Trade Unions as a form of economic organisation. Rather than stifling our economic reconstruction with the whims of bureaucrats, we shall allow the proletarian class, with all of its creative energies, to guide the construction of socialism. To that end, we shall establish an independent Congress of Trade Unions, which shall take primary charge of the implementation of a socialist economy."
 RUS_decentralised_planning: "Decentralised Planning"
 RUS_decentralised_planning_desc: "Only when given the freedom to experiment and create can the working class truly succeed in the creation of new forms of production necessary for socialism. It is not the Party's role to interfere in this task with centralised diktats, but instead it lies in our ability to coordinate production nationwide."
 RUS_decentralised_planning_tt: "§CNational Spirit will be improved based on unity of the VST.§!"
 RUS_planning_directory: "Central Directory of Economy"
 RUS_planning_directory_desc: "While we still seek to follow the examples set by the Western Revolutions, the present circumstances still necessitate the ability to quickly achieve production goals - meaning we cannot afford the luxury of more experimental productive forms. As such, our economic policies will continue to be coordinated from the top-down, guiding the Trade Unions to achieve planned goals."
 RUS_victory_of_socialism: "The Theory of Victory of Socialism"
 RUS_victory_of_socialism_desc: "Levitsky's pluralistic vision is the best hope for a socialist, internationalist Russia. Only by combining the powers of all of Russia's revolutionary forces can we hope to stand up against the stronghold of Capital in the West. Recent discussion, however, has sought to broaden our ideological alliance even beyond this task - the Chairman's opinion will be crucial in determining the party's line."
 RUS_countryside_concession: "The Comrades of the Villages"
 RUS_countryside_concession_desc: "The RSDRP never had much faith in the peasantry, seeing it as a declining, pre-capitalist class; but the peasant does not exploit the labour of others, and they are themselves exploited by rent and taxation. Peasants are not merely relics of the past in Chairman Levitsky's eyes, but indeed offer their own path to socialism only when working alongside the proletariat. Together, let us finally bridge the Urban-Rural divide."
 RUS_devolution_party: "Devolution of the Party"
 RUS_devolution_party_desc: "Though the party's guidance will still be needed, several members of the VST, such as veteran syndicalist Grigory Maksimov, have drafted a series of proposals for the furthering of the syndicalist revolution in Russia by transferring most political power directly to the VTsSPS. Although partisan politics will still exist to guide the remnants of the state apparatus, the time has come for the Unions to take their proper spot at the head of the revolution."

 RUS_mend_marxist_rift: "Mend the Marxist Rift"
 RUS_mend_marxist_rift_desc: "The divide between the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks has, for decades now, prevented the formation of a truly united workers' party. However, the time has finally come to bridge this gap; though it will take much political will and effort to truly unite the party, we could truly consolidate the Russian left and fulfil the dreams of those brave souls who first founded the RSDRP."
 RUS_eternal_flame: "The Ever-Burning Flame"
 RUS_eternal_flame_desc: "From a spark, a flame will flare up - this was the declaration in every front page of our 'Iskra' for four decades now. And finally, the spark of socialism is not only a spark, but a raging fire, consuming the old world so that a new, better one can rise from its ashes."

 RUS_protect_revolution: "Protect the Permanent Revolution"
 RUS_protect_revolution_desc: "While Russia has come far, our Permanent Revolution cannot survive in the comparatively backward east of Europe. We must push through and ensure we can link up to our developed western comrades. Failure to defeat Germany will surely mean the victory of the bourgeoisie from beneath us, while a German occupation could take us back even further. Defend our revolution, proletarians!"
 RUS_united_behind_purpose: "United Behind Purpose"
 RUS_united_behind_purpose_desc: "Instead of any specific ideological doctrine, the new VST should be unified before its cause, its immediate, noble goal of world revolution. To this end, theory is irrelevant; praxis is everything. Accordingly, we will begin a massive propaganda campaign in support of the burgeoning war effort, unifying the Soviets and Unions behind one slogan: the Destruction of the German Empire."
 RUS_formalise_emergency_powers: "Formalise the Emergency Powers"
 RUS_formalise_emergency_powers_desc: "Chairman Sulimov's rise to power played fast and loose with the principles of soviet democracy, but it was for a good reason. As we prepare for the oncoming revolutionary war, we need to formalise this state of affairs into the special Committee for Defence, an extraordinarily appointed council with wide-reaching powers. For the duration of the crisis, the Committee will be entrusted with preserving the Revolution at all costs."
 RUS_prepare_war_machine: "Prepare the War Machine"
 RUS_prepare_war_machine_desc: "While we are not driven to the same extremes of a siege economy, the war with Germany will prove to be a hard effort requiring all of our energy. To this end, we will begin the transition to full wartime production. The building up of the arms industry must take full priority, and all must expect to make the necessary sacrifices in this endeavour."
 RUS_counter_reactionary_intelligence: "Terminate the Counter-Revolution"
 RUS_counter_reactionary_intelligence_desc: "Savinkovists and Tsarists abound in this darkest hour of the revolution. Let us not wait for them to strike, but weed them out and pacify them. These elements are class enemies, and whenever they try to free themselves from the passivity imposed upon them, material force will subdue them. This is the meaning of the dictatorship of the proletariat."
 RUS_younger_generation: "The Generation of the New Revolution"
 RUS_younger_generation_desc: "With Germany fell the greatest exponent of Capital - as we, this young heroic generation of revolutionaries, pulled down the Colossus of Empire, so too shall we build something new. Communism, a world without class, nation, or prejudice, is on the horizon - all we must do is seize it!"
 RUS_younger_generation_tt: "§RWill Comrade Sulimov step down, as he has promised, or continue leading the people to brighter future?§!"

 RUS_communists: "The Communists"
 RUS_communists_desc: "Preferring the label of Communist above all else, the VST's left-wing seeks to quickly transition to a planned socialist economy, pushing for unceasing commitment to the social revolution without any quarter to reactionaries. Generally, they are led by Lev Kamenev, although Grigory Zinovyev's influence could lead them in a more personalist direction."
 RUS_state_surveillance: "Expansion of VGPU"
 RUS_state_surveillance_desc: "While we were fortunate enough to be spared a second Civil War, we still face staggering amounts of reactionary opposition throughout the country, enough that the VGPU is struggling to cope with its current resources and mechanisms. To more effectively combat these issues, the VGPU will be granted far more authority as well as resources, rivalling those of the Cheka during the Civil War."
 RUS_dictatorship_proletariat: "The Collective State"
 RUS_dictatorship_proletariat_desc: "Democratic Centralism, the principle that the party must allow absolute freedom of debate, provided there is absolute unity of action, is the organisational tool that allowed both for the revolution to succeed and for the ultimate ascension of the VST's left-wing. This principle must be extended down to the Soviet level, creating a vibrant proletarian democracy able to rapidly act according to any situation."
 RUS_labour_and_defence: "Supreme Council for National Economy"
 RUS_labour_and_defence_desc: "We understand socialism to involve centralised production organised in large trusts, with society ultimately organised under a definite plan as a single factory and office. To this end, we shall establish a new committee aiming to draw up an economic plan for the whole country. This council's task will be to prepare for the coming war through centralised economic decrees, with the rest of the Workers' Coalition helping ensure smooth cooperation with other economic organs."

 RUS_red_intelligentsia: "Patron of the Red Intelligentsia"
 RUS_red_intelligentsia_desc: "While we do not wish to pose these issues in an abstract and idealistic fashion, the new socialist consciousness will not arise purely from changing economic circumstances. Education must play a role. We will appeal to a new intelligentsia for a propaganda offensive against the religious fog, in support of socialist art, and to showcase the achievements of our communist comrades across the world, whether the French PCOP or Labour's Federationists."
 RUS_democratic_dictatorship: "Democratic Dictatorship"
 RUS_democratic_dictatorship_desc: "With the coming struggle against German imperialism, we cannot afford to make a fetish of democratic forms. The life of the Soviets and trade unions - all these depend on circumstances. The defence of true proletarian democracy against traitors and social enemies depends on the establishment of a committee which can safeguard all our class institutions authoritatively, serving the role of supreme organ over all others."
 RUS_taking_over_vtssps: "Tackling the Union Opposition"
 RUS_taking_over_vtssps_desc: "An opposition within the trade unions has flared up, condemning our centralising measures. While internal debate can be of the utmost importance, the VST is fast running out of the material and moral resources to cope with such a luxury as frivolous disputes and discussions. We must find the means to heal this disease of factionalism and return to practical action."
 RUS_taking_over_vtssps_tt: "Taking this §Yfocus§! will start an §Yevent chain§! concerned with how to handle §rThe Union Opposition§!. Be wary, as this focus will decide the future of the §oCommunist Faction§!."
 RUS_law_on_unions: "Law on Centralisation of Labour Unions"
 RUS_law_on_unions_desc: "In a bold realisation of proletarian class unity, all unions have been merged into the VTsSPS. Not only does this ensure unity in programme and action of the class, no longer divided by trade and factional interests, but it is also a step forward for the centrally planned direction of our socialist economy."
 RUS_law_on_unions_tt: "We will gain a national spirit based on our choices in the event chain."
 RUS_encourage_collectivisation: "Encouraged Collectivisation"
 RUS_encourage_collectivisation_desc: "While the wealthy kulak will always remain the enemy of socialism, the poorer peasants can be won over to our cause, as shown by our alliance with the PSR. A steep progressive tax on farmers will be introduced, and the funds gained from this used to provide credit and tax breaks to poorer peasants willing to organise into large-scale collective farms, while the wealthiest exploiters shall be subject to strict supervision and control by the organs of worker power in the countryside."
 RUS_charter_of_russian_totalism: "The Charter of Russian Totalism"
 RUS_charter_of_russian_totalism_desc: "Despite our differences with the parliamentarians, romanticists, and other social-imperialists that have signed the so-called 'Totalist Charter', their dedication to the Revolution is worth emulating. With the aid of our old Maximalist allies in the PSR, let us draft a truly Russian Totalist charter, one formalising our ideological alliance."

 RUS_bolshevik_gamble: "The Bolshevik Gamble"
 RUS_bolshevik_gamble_desc: "That the party was not wholly reunified is one of the greatest missed opportunities of the revolution thus far. Whether it stems from legitimate grievance or petty factionalism, these so-called 'Bolsheviks' mock the name with their incessant opportunism. The time has come, with the aid of some creative tactics from Comrade Zinovyev, to reassert our political line and put an end to the splitters, reunifying the Communist movement under our banner."
 RUS_bolshevik_gamble_trigger_tt: "For every point of §RRadicalism§!, we would need to spend £pol_power §Y10§! political power. Due to current radicalism, we need to spend £pol_power §Y[?current_vst_left_radicalism|0]§! political power."

 RUS_technocratic_syndicalism: "Accounting and Control"
 RUS_technocratic_syndicalism_desc: "The abolition of bureaucracy, total and final, will not be made possible for some time. However, under our unitary and planned organisation, all workers have become employees of a single countrywide state syndicate, and the VTsSPS has become a school of communism and administration. The workers are learning the skills of accounting and control, paving the way for the general administration of things under the future mode of production."

 RUS_preserve_revolution_within_desc: "Dictatorship of the VST! We stand upon it and cannot depart from this ground, since this is the organisation that in the course of struggle has won for itself the position of vanguard of the whole proletariat. In such a time of struggle where enemies assail us from within and from without, we need a single, strong, powerful class-party which is leader of everything, of the whole working class."
 RUS_preserve_revolution_within_totalist_tt: "This effect scales with our §oTotalist§! popularity:"
 RUS_preserve_revolution_within_tt: "In the interests of defending Proletarian Hegemony against the §PTeutonic threat§!, §oGrigory Zinovyev§! will subordinate the Soviets and Unions to the VST, setting our ideology to §oTotalist§!."

 RUS_invite_sverdlov: "Invite Sverdlov"
 RUS_invite_sverdlov_desc: "Although the remaining independent Bolsheviks declined to join the VST, they are still valued members of the Workers' Coalition. Their civilian leader and ideologue, Yakov Sverdlov, is a skilled administrator and popular among the émigré community and the army, not to mention a veteran revolutionary. In the spirit of unity, we will reach out to our old comrade and formally invite him to the council of ministers."
 RUS_cheka_state: "Expansion of the Political Administration"
 RUS_cheka_state_desc: "While the reforms to the VGPU and its organs have served us well, it is time to reorganise them and strengthen the principles of revolutionary legality. New political sections will be established in all provinces and regions of our socialist state, and new legal provisions opened for the continued detainment of noteworthy suspects. Otherwise, all suspects must be turned over to the revolutionary courts to face swift justice."
 RUS_war_on_landowners: "War on Peasants"
 RUS_war_on_landowners_desc: "The peasantry may have had a revolutionary role to play in the struggle against Tsarism and Savinkovism, but in the struggle for socialism, Lenin observed it as playing a vacillating, treacherous role. After all, it was the peasantry, driven rabid with nationalist fervour, who drove Savinkov into power, to say nothing of the Left-SR uprisings during the Civil War. We must uproot this landowning class in favour of large-scale collectivisation of agriculture before history can repeat."
 RUS_proletarian_consciousness: "Awaken Proletarian Consciousness"
 RUS_proletarian_consciousness_desc: "Only through the decisive action of the Bolshevik party was the military-revolutionary committee of the Petrograd Soviet able to wage the October Revolution. Now that we have re-established our rapport with their splinter party, we can again mobilise the working class for the coming revolutionary war in Europe, and as its leading vanguard instil in it something more than mere trade-union consciousness."

 ### VST postwar
 RUS_right_victory: "Redeem Marxist Social-Democracy"
 RUS_right_victory_desc: "In the tragic days of October 1917, an anarchic tendency took over the labour movement, culminating in a bureaucratic dictatorship based on the complete suppression of self-government and the independent activity of the masses. With the reoriented will of the masses, we have reversed this course and restored true Marxist Social-Democracy. Let the working class reap the benefits of democracy and non-utopian socialism!"
 RUS_centre_victory: "The Emancipation of Labour"
 RUS_centre_victory_desc: "As the forces of Empire and Capital fall to dust, so too rises the era of Workers' Power. In their homes, factories, towns, and cities, the proletariat exercises supreme power for the first time in history. Gone is the era of national hatred, wage slavery, and exploitation. Here in Russia, as once before in 1905 and in 1917, true democracy has been born, and, just as in 1905 and 1917, the world has been changed forever. Let the Internationale unite the human race!"
 RUS_left_victory: "The Conquest of Democracy"
 RUS_left_victory_desc: "In 1917, the Bolsheviks took power with many rosy illusions, but this naivity soon gave way to the iron hand of dictatorship. We have avoided this course and remained true to the spirit of Lenin; under the auspices of the proletariat, democracy continues to operate in the Soviets without chauvinistic domination. We suppress not equality or democracy, but only the most bloody, most tyrannical, most pitiless, cynical, and hypocritical of all forms of power - bourgeois dictatorship!"
 RUS_totalist_victory: "Immortal in the Revolution"
 RUS_totalist_victory_desc: "There is much in our Revolution which is eternal and immortal beyond dispute - it has swept away all fetishism of the bourgeois state and erected on its ruins a new power created by and for the proletariat, a Soviet power administered by the entire working class. Now that we have linked with our Communard brothers, let us embrace what is immortal in both our Revolutions - that they are the beginning of the World Revolution!"
 RUS_demilitarise_industry: "Demilitarisation of the Economy"
 RUS_demilitarise_industry_desc: "The embittered struggle for victory has imposed on our economy measures of centralisation and discipline that served the needs for mobilisation but would be unfitting for a bourgeois peacetime economy, let alone our burgeoning socialist society. We cannot rely on military and political force to ensure the smooth working of the economic base and should thus reverse the militarisation of the trade unions, as well as scale down our production of military equipment."
 RUS_market_incentives: "Market Incentives"
 RUS_market_incentives_desc: "There are fantastic thinkers who imagine we can do away with money and financial means of accounting. Perhaps under a distant communism, this will be true. We saw, however, the disorder of War Communism, which in part sought to force through a moneyless economy. While the exchange of commodities exists, money will exist with it and will be an instrument of our socialist economy we should embrace, alongside profit as the measure of the efficiency of an enterprise."
 RUS_devolve_power: "Dismantle the Cult of Violence"
 RUS_devolve_power_desc: "With the end of the immediate threat to the Revolution in Germany, the time has finally come to follow through on the furthering of the social revolution - the transformation of the capitalist past into the communist future. The death penalty, torture, the prisons themselves - all of these things will be left behind in history's dustbin."
 RUS_mass_urbanisation: "Russia of Modernity"
 RUS_mass_urbanisation_desc: "The wonders of a world without exploitation are indeed limitless - even now, amidst this revolutionary period, we are able to embark on mass urbanisation projects of a kind thought fanciful only decades ago. The new Russia is one of glittering cities, not of backward villages!"
 RUS_towards_cybernetics: "Beyond the Monetary System"
 RUS_towards_cybernetics_desc: "Marx began his magnum opus with a critique of the value of commodities in the market and its necessary expression in money. Here in embryo is contained all the horrors of capital. Experiments in radical planning can illuminate the way past this and create a route into communism. New units of accounting, emerging technology, the use of labour-vouchers, and the direct transfer of products between firms should all be explored."
 RUS_transformation_of_nature: "Transformation of Nature"
 RUS_transformation_of_nature_desc: "Our agricultural reforms have taken one step towards banishing hunger from our lands - now we must vanquish it forever. Never again shall the fecund land of the Volga experience the famines of 1891 or 1921. Extensive irrigation systems will be planned, rivers will be transformed into machines to generate electricity, forest shelterbelts will be planted to protect farmland, and natural resources will be tapped. Let the working class mobilise for this great heroic project!"
 RUS_workers_state: "Workers' State"
 RUS_workers_state_desc: "Our Russian version of the Syndicalist Synthesis has resulted in a unique arrangement: multiple revolutionary parties, each sharing power in the Unions and Soviets. While once this awkward state of affairs was thought to be a momentary stage of the Revolution, our experience has shown that such a system can work. Let us work to strengthen the coalition even further; together with our allies, we will build the future."
 RUS_party_state: "The Party Regime"
 RUS_party_state_desc: "We need not be afraid of the dictatorship of one party. After all, in 1917, Lenin condemned those Soviets dominated by the PSR and Mensheviks as counter-revolutionary, and it was only the Bolshevik vanguard that made the Red October possible. The Soviets and Trade Unions are the foundation, but the party makes the dictatorship of the proletariat a reality. The VST already dominates them - let us embrace this fact and empower it further."
 RUS_indoctrination: "Enshrine the Great Revolutionary War"
 RUS_indoctrination_desc: "The past war was among the deadliest in history, a veritable living hell - yet incredibly, socialism has not only survived: it has thrived! Thanks to the sacrifices of the countless martyrs draped in the crimson flag, Revolution triumphed over Reaction, and the world has entered a new epoch. Still, we must never forget the sacrifices it took to reach this point; let the memory of the fallen live forevermore!"
 RUS_zinovyev_constitution: "The Communist Constitution"
 RUS_zinovyev_constitution_desc: "The constitution we have inherited from the early days of the revolution is now defunct. The Soviets have penetrated the flesh and blood of the workers, and all who labour participate in them. The trade unions have lost their naïve executive role, united within the VTsSPS to serve an economic function under the guidance of VSNKh. All this under the auspices of the VST, the advance guard of the proletariat. A revised constitution should be drafted reflecting this new reality."

 ### Industry tree
 RUS_military_production: "War of Motors"
 RUS_military_production_desc: "Nothing in the world unites Russians quite like their antipathy for the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. The spirit of revanchism burns bright, but righteous indignation is just one step on a long journey. Russia must prepare herself for the mortal struggle to come - a war of minds and motors."
 RUS_moscow_economic_council: "Moscow Economic Council"
 RUS_moscow_economic_council_desc: "The Germans and socialists both have their own economic union, which they utilise to foster great cooperation among like-minded states - and in the German case especially, to further their own material interests. Now that Russia has started to gain its own foothold in Europe, perhaps it is about time we follow suit: the Moscow Economic Council will serve as a counterweight to Mitteleuropa and further Russian economic interests abroad."
 RUS_economic_council_tt: "§CAn economic organisation is formed for the Moscow Accord to counteract the influence of Mitteleuropa.§!"

 RUS_relief_work: "Organise Relief Work"
 RUS_relief_work_desc: "Black Monday has sent the Russian economy spiralling, and in times like these, drastic measures are needed. The creation of a public works programme will ensure that unemployment does not reach the bottom of the pit, allowing everyday Russians to get back on their feet and for a modicum of economic stability."
 RUS_modernise_transsiberian: "Modernise the Trans-Siberian Railway"
 RUS_modernise_transsiberian_desc: "From Moscow to Vladivostok, the Trans-Siberian Railway is a lifeblood of the Russian economy. Its importance cannot be understated, as the victory of the Whites in the Civil War could not have been accomplished without it. Updating its rail lines will help keep our economy afloat."
 RUS_urban_housing_projects: "Urban Housing Programme"
 RUS_urban_housing_projects_desc: "The economic crisis has left many Russians homeless, and we cannot afford to have so many on the streets. A government-subsidised programme will attempt to address this and hopefully get the average Russian back on their feet."
 RUS_industrialise_siberia: "Siberian Development Programme"
 RUS_industrialise_siberia_desc: "Beneath the Siberian soil, there's an immense untapped wealth of resources. Metals, minerals and fuels that surpass the output of entire empires are within our reach. By investing capital and expertise into the neglected regions of our east, we can turn Siberia into an economic powerhouse as the crown jewel of our resource industry."
 RUS_electronics_focus: "The Electronic Calculating Machine"
 RUS_electronics_focus_desc: "The latest advancements have seen electronics become more relevant than ever before in espionage and military planning - and the All-Russian Electrotechnical Institute took first steps in development of modern computing machines. A group of scientists under Sergey Lebedev, Vladimir Lukyanov and Bashir Rameyev issued a letter to the government asking for additional funding into the field."

 RUS_new_refineries: "Synthetic Chemistry"
 RUS_new_refineries_desc: "The latest years have seen the creation of the world's first synthetic rubbers, and various Russian rubber companies are beginning to capitalise on this. This should hopefully help us reduce our reliance on imported rubber."

 RUS_industrialise_eastern_europe: "Develop the Heartlands"
 RUS_industrialise_eastern_europe_desc: "Russia's western and central regions have been the backbone of its economy, but many of our urban centres still lag behind our European adversaries. We can still afford further developments in these areas, especially in agricultural machinery and manufacturing."
 RUS_industrialise_urals: "The Ural Programme"
 RUS_industrialise_urals_desc: "When the industrial revolution came to Russia, its riches rarely stretched beyond the major cities. Beyond the Ural Mountains, many localities rely on the same trades that they have since Ivan IV's eastward expansion. Instead of further industrialising the already wealthy cities, it's high time that we brought the riches of the industrial revolution to the Urals and beyond."
 RUS_academy_of_sciences: "Develop the Academy of Sciences"
 RUS_academy_of_sciences_desc: "Russia can claim a legacy of engineering excellence, but it has consistently lacked enough qualified technical specialists to meet the pace of industrialisation. Reviving and expanding upon the old zemstvo-run network of vocational schools and technical colleges will not only bring education to the masses but also train a new, far larger generation of industrial specialists."

 RUS_give_them_nothing: "Prikaz No. 267"
 RUS_give_them_nothing_desc: "Nothing can be left for an invader aside from scorched earth. Citizens and factories must be shipped eastward, with everything left behind put to the torch. Partisans will strike and melt back into the wilderness. All of Russia, every soul and square foot of earth, must rise up to expel the occupier."

 RUS_address_the_army: "Address the Army"
 RUS_address_the_army_desc: "[RUS_address_army_text]"
 RUS_address_the_army_desc_normal: "Denikin, whose theories have dictated Russia's reforms for the past decade, argued that quality is a quantity of its own. This quality and offensive-oriented spirit has served us well for now, but with tensions rising around the world and the arms race intensifying, we cannot afford to hesitate if we are to maintain our military at the modern level."
 RUS_address_the_army_desc_socialist: "We inherit an effective yet reactionary instrument of the war from the previous regime. The fighting capability of the army has been diminished due to the removal of counter-revolutionary officers, but it shall only be a momentary hurdle."

 RUS_improve_savinkov_line: "[RUS_fort_line]"
 RUS_improve_savinkov_line_desc: "While we anticipate an offensive war, there is the very real possibility that Russia will be pushed back to its borders and beyond, and the vast front will make defending everywhere difficult. A defensive fortification line stretching from the Baltics to the Black Sea will make such moves against us difficult."

 RUS_update_equipment: "GOST"
 RUS_update_equipment_desc: "Established in 1925, the GOST or 'Gosudarstvenny Standart' is a set of technical guidelines intended to standardise all aspects of Russia's economy. For the military, it ensures that everything from rations to rifles to railroads meets the strict standards needed to survive the rigours of war."

 RUS_nizhegorodsky_avtomobilny_focus: "Detroit-on-Volga"
 RUS_nizhegorodsky_avtomobilny_focus_desc: "Constructed in the early 30s with the help of the Ford Motor Company, '$naz$' boasts the largest and most productive automobile plant in Russia. Andrey Lipgart, the plant's stern but pioneering director, has proposed a new generation of vehicles adapted both to Russian roads and demands for mass production."

 RUS_roads_of_courage: "Roads of Courage"
 RUS_roads_of_courage_desc: "Wars are won not just by troops at the front, but also by the countless personnel who keep the machinery of war running smoothly. The Main Directorate of Rear proposed by the Stavka's quartermaster cadre would centralise the logistics services of all separate military branches."

 RUS_science_of_victory: "Science of Victory"
 RUS_science_of_victory_desc: "Nikolay Golovin's 'Neo-Suvorovian' theories have been controversial, with Kornilov in particular opposing them, seeing them as being too Prussian-inspired and against the spirit of the army that destroyed the Red Menace. Golovin's thesis is to formulate a 'Russian Auftragstaktik', taking the best lessons from German military thinking."
 RUS_permanent_stavka: "Permanent Unified Command"
 RUS_permanent_stavka_desc: "In the Great War, the complete independence of the army and naval command staffs from each other created severe difficulties in joint operations and strategic planning. The importance of combined-arms warfare between the army, navy, and especially the air force in the next war cannot be overstated, so the branches must be unified under the command of a permanent Stavka in times of both peace and war."
 RUS_russian_auftragstaktik: "Russian Auftragstaktik"
 RUS_russian_auftragstaktik_desc: "The Russian army has been traditionally plagued by opaque and slow command hierarchies. The Germans have solved this through decentralising decision-making into lower levels, fostering a culture where lower officers are encouraged to make tactical decisions based on the situation on the ground, instead of passively waiting for orders from their superiors."
 RUS_reform_yunker_schools: "Three-tier Military Education"
 RUS_reform_yunker_schools_desc: "Lack of officers compared to the size of our army has always been holding the Russian army back in our tactical flexibility. We need thorough reform: remove privileges of 'Yunker' Schools, create modern European three-tiered system and not focus on producing the absolute best officers, but as many qualified and reliable ones as we need."
 RUS_unity_of_doctrine: "Unity of Doctrine"
 RUS_unity_of_doctrine_desc: "The Russian officer corps is experienced and brilliant, but has vastly different approaches to doctrine. The Denikin reforms were always more concerned with organisational questions, and the generals were allowed to conduct war as they wished. But a Cossack General wages war in a very different way from an Artillery General - which is not desirable when seeking to achieve consistent military success."
 RUS_hammer_of_suvorov: "The Hammer of Suvorov"
 RUS_hammer_of_suvorov_desc: "Artillery is the Russian Army's hammer, and no compromises are acceptable between quality or quantity. One-piece barrels, optimised muzzle brakes, lightweight carriages, and interchangeable parts will ensure Russia's artillery is both world-class and built for mass production, which will allow large artillery units to be concentrated on the front lines."
 RUS_battle_of_destruction: "Violins of Death"
 RUS_battle_of_destruction_desc: "From Suvorov to Brusilov, Russia has always won its most spectacular victories through firepower and bravery. Russia's army is not a wall or a scalpel blade, but a hammer - a relentless force that will crush the body and spirit of everything in its path. Whatever Russian artillery cannot level, Russian shock troops will seize at gunpoint."

 RUS_spirit_of_victory: "Will to Victory"
 RUS_spirit_of_victory_desc: "What brought the Volunteer Army to the victory? We were outgunned, outnumbered, starving and lost. But we never lost faith, we never wavered, and our spirit was held high by the righteousness of our cause. This is the quality that Denikin's and Markov's reforms have always sought to maintain - the unwavering, offensive spirit of the Russian soldier."
 RUS_expansion_of_guards: "Expansion of the Guards Formations"
 RUS_expansion_of_guards_desc: "Whether they call themselves 'Assault', 'Guards', 'Death', or 'Volunteer' units, these formations serve the same purpose - concentrating the best troops where they can do the most damage. These first-rate units are to form the heart of the Russian Army, clearing paths through even the most stubborn of enemy resistance, and motivating their comrades with unmatched bravery and self-sacrifice."
 RUS_new_cavalry: "The New Cavalry"
 RUS_new_cavalry_desc: "Horses are indispensable for the Russian Army, but the realities of modern war cannot be ignored. In his book 'The New Cavalry', Yevgeny Messner formulated a plan of 'cavalry-mechanised groups'. In his view, Russian cavalry traditions - ambitious manoeuvres across the steppe - are more relevant than ever, as long as the units are equipped in modern form."
 RUS_tech_semi_motorised_cav: "Cavalry-Mechanised Group"
 RUS_separate_mechanised_divisions: "Separate Mechanised Divisions"
 RUS_separate_mechanised_divisions_desc: "After a decade of development by the 'Black Epaulette' school of Russian officers, Separate Mechanised Divisions are finally capable of conducting independent operations. Inspired by the Panzer-Division, this column of steel and death will form the vanguard of the Russian armies in the wars to come."
 RUS_separate_mechanised_divisions_tt: "The number of 18-width Guards Armour divisions will be deployed based on your armour technology. Having the following focuses completed will increase the number of deployed divisions by one per focus:\n§Y-$RUS_NPP_tanks$§!\n§Y-$RUS_military_production$§!\n§Y-$RUS_academy_of_black_epaulettes$§!\n\nAdditionally, having §Y$RUS_sergey_markov$§! or §Y$RUS_yakov_slashchyov$§! in §YMilitary High Command§! will increase division count by one."
 RUS_kursk_exercise_tt: "§nThe exercises will raise§! §RWorld Tension§! §nand grant bonuses to technology.§!"

 RUS_propaganda_bureau_of_army: "Propaganda Agency of the Army"
 RUS_propaganda_bureau_of_army_desc: "In the Civil War, the OSVAG did exemplary work in maintaining the morale of our own soldiers. While many old-school generals would scoff at the importance of propaganda, in the modern age of mass communications and armies, it is exactly the tool that can break and bolster the spirits of entire nations. For the sake of the nation's life, it is necessary to restore the army's will to die."

 RUS_civic_militarism: "Civic Militarism"
 RUS_civic_militarism_desc: "Emperor Aleksandr III once said that Russia has only two allies - the Russian Army and the Russian Navy. Together they are the guarantors of the Russian nation, the knights that protect Russia against the darkness. Every Russian should have pride in the army, and military service should be prized and venerated as the highest civic duty a man can perform."
 RUS_encourage_heroism: "Education in Heroism"
 RUS_encourage_heroism_desc: "What defeated the Bolsheviks was not technology or theory, but the simple ability of the common Russian soldier and officer. It is this rising generation of heroes we must put our faith in. Commanders like Denikin and Kornilov started from almost nothing - yet they got far with only their spirit and will."
 RUS_steel_divisions: "Army of Steel"
 RUS_steel_divisions_desc: "'Manoeuvre is the key to victory' - words first said by General Slashchyov, but which are now the maxim of a transformed Russian Army. Gone is the bulk and senseless waste of the Great War's 'Russian Steamroller'. Fleets of tanks and mobile infantry, steel-clad bogatyrs for an industrial age, stand ready to pierce the heart of German Europe."

 RUS_maskirovka: "The Art of Deception"
 RUS_maskirovka_desc: "Maskirovka, or Russian military deception, has long traditions in Russian military thinking. While the advantages of confusing one's enemy are obvious, the vast, forested spaces of Eastern Europe create the ideal conditions to create armies and invasions of phantoms."

 RUS_academy_of_black_epaulettes: "The Academy of Black Epaulettes"
 RUS_academy_of_black_epaulettes_desc: "[RUS_academy_of_black_epaulettes_text]"
 RUS_black_epaulettes_desc_normal: "General Markov and his Black Epaulettes - the young, bold and aggressive school of armour-minded officers - need a spiritual home of their own. The Military School of Mechanisation and Motorisation will be where the new generation of Russian military men will be forged."
 RUS_black_epaulettes_desc_socialist: "The Military School of Mechanisation and Motorisation was founded by Generals Sergey Markov and Yakov Slashchyov, but it shall be taken over by Mikhail Tukhachevsky and his disciplines in armoured warfare, continuing the work where the reactionaries left off."
 RUS_motorisation: "Grand Mechanisation Programme"
 RUS_motorisation_desc: "Grand ambition requires grand investment. Automobile and tractor plants across Russia will be joined under a new 'Specialised Machinebuilding Trust' (Spetsmash) that will answer directly to the Stavka. Streamlined production and management will allow vast quantities of tanks and wheeled vehicles to be produced more efficiently than otherwise possible."
 RUS_NPP_tanks: "Direct-Support Armour"
 RUS_NPP_tanks_desc: "Short for 'Direct-Support of Infantry', NPP tanks cover function just as much as they do form. Extensive resources for research and training have been allocated by the Stavka and the government to ensure that Russia's new generation of tanks integrates smoothly into combined arms operations."
 RUS_expand_ird: "Expansion of IRD"
 RUS_expand_ird_desc: "The Group for Research of Reactive Movement and Gas-Dynamic Laboratory were home to Russia's most brilliant rocket scientists. Since its foundation in 1934, IRD has been developing concepts for rocket-powered weapons, both for aeroplane armament and rocket artillery. Their first actual prototypes have been successful but have lacked funding for actual production."

 RUS_desperate_measures: "Prikaz No. 267"
 RUS_desperate_measures_desc: "The enemy throws new forces to the front without regard to heavy losses and penetrates deep into Russia, seizing new regions, destroying our cities and villages, and violating, plundering, and killing the Russian population. Some talk that we can retreat further to the east, but such talk is a falsehood, helpful only to our enemies. Russia is not a desert, but people. To retreat further means to waste ourselves and our Motherland. It is time to finish retreating. Not one step back!"

 RUS_artillery_production: "Fund the GAU"
 RUS_artillery_production_desc: "The GAU, or 'Main Artillery Directorate', is a venerable institution. Directed by Russia's top artillery engineer and industrialist, Vasily Grabin, it is tasked with developing new artillery and coordinating production. It has done an admirable job in modernising our arsenal on a limited budget. Given proper funding, the GAU can guarantee a steady flow of advanced guns to our growing Army."

 RUS_mobilise_the_hosts: "Mobilise the Hosts"
 RUS_mobilise_the_hosts_desc: "The Cossacks are a warlike people, and their hosts exist for that very purpose. We shall integrate them into our standard army to fight alongside us."

 RUS_expand_okhrana: "Consolidate the Security Services"
 RUS_expand_okhrana_desc: "Though its current form dates only to 1930, the Department of State Security boasts a long legacy of domestic espionage. The agency has excelled under its director, Klavdy Foss, but its scope can be expanded beyond just tackling domestic extremism. Its powers overlap with primarily foreign intelligence-focused Special Purpose Department of the MVD (OOS MVD) and Fifth Departmnet of the War Ministry. Consolidation is necessary for this bloated system."

 RUS_codebreaking: "Establish the DRS"
 RUS_codebreaking_desc: "The DRS, short for 'Cryptographic Intelligence Service', is a proposed Okhrana department dedicated to codebreaking. This department would both centralise cryptography under Okhrana supervision and be paired with the creation of special forces units dedicated to gathering cryptographic material in the field from enemy officers and signals hubs."

 RUS_veil_of_secrecy: "The Veil of Secrecy"
 RUS_veil_of_secrecy_desc: "Counter-intelligence is not just a question of stronger ciphers, but also actively eliminating threats to our networks. The Okhrana has perfected 'persuasive' techniques for bringing double-agents to our side. These double-agents can, in turn, lure other enemy spies and saboteurs to their doom using false transmission 'radioplays'."

 RUS_smersh: "SMERSH"
 RUS_smersh_desc: "SMERSH - Death to Spies. A statement of intent as much as it is an organisation. With counter-espionage currently split between the War Ministry, Stavka, and Okhrana, the Main Directorate of Counter-Intelligence (SMERSH) will unify their efforts in hunting down enemy agents behind the lines, while also suppressing dangerous discontent at home."

 RUS_redemption: "Redemption of Guilt"
 RUS_redemption_desc: "Sometimes soldiers commit crimes, sometimes even officers commit crimes. We have the institute of penal units for them, but this institute is small and used only from time to time. The Okhrana has proposed reorganisation of the penal units for their better use."

 RUS_boldyrev_plan: "Legacy of the Boldyrevites"
 RUS_boldyrev_plan_desc: "Those who stood first at General Boldyrev's side truly had Russian democracy in their hearts. As the foremost soldiers of the reborn republic, they should be rewarded for their courage and dedication with positions in local governance and in the army. They shall set the stage for a forever free Russian Democratic Federative Republic!"
 RUS_integrate_free_army: "Integrate the Free Army"
 RUS_integrate_free_army_desc: "The Free Russian Army is small, but it makes up the majority of active soldiers now, and must become the backbone of the restored armed forces. Military restrictions will make this difficult for the time being, however. With time, the Russian army shall be built from the top down - and then the ground up."
 RUS_integrate_free_army_tt: "After the National Spirit has run its course:"
 RUS_chafe_at_the_restrictions: "Chafe at the Restrictions"
 RUS_chafe_at_the_restrictions_desc: "Any sane German politician understands that Russia alone is no threat to Berlin. With their western front secure, the Germans should be willing to renegotiate some of the terms of the Treaty of Moscow. After all, have we not shown that the new age is a time of peace in Europe, not of war and revenge?"
 RUS_will_that_conquers_mountains: "Victory Through Perseverance"
 RUS_will_that_conquers_mountains_desc: "Russia may have lost the war that never should have begun in the first place, but she remains a great power. The Russian army has now twice saved the republic from tyranny, and at the end of the storm, we retain something far greater than the size of our borders: democracy for our people."
 RUS_secret_weapons_development: "Secret Weapons Development"
 RUS_secret_weapons_development_desc: "The Treaty of Moscow forbids certain developments of weapons, but with enough secrecy, we will be able to bypass those restrictions and create the air force of the future that can protect the Russian skies."
 RUS_german_industrial_cooperation: "Prosperity with Mitteleuropa"
 RUS_german_industrial_cooperation_desc: "Unlike the previous regime, we recognise the economic collapse and anarchy that occurs when Russia is blocked off from its main trade partners. Though we remain separate from it, Mitteleuropa now encompasses much of the continent, and cooperation with the German economic bloc can only be mutually beneficial."
 RUS_restore_military_pride: "Restore Pride"
 RUS_restore_military_pride_desc: "Many have felt hatred for the Russian nation and its people for how the Vozhd mutilated it. This defeatism must end - Russia is a nation of more than a hundred million people, of many cultures and languages, the largest country on Earth. We can learn from our past mistakes while retaining our sovereignty and pride in our past achievements."
 RUS_boldyrevism: "Boldyrevism"
 RUS_boldyrevism_desc: "In many ways, General Boldyrev is someone to look to - a stern father of the new republic who recognised that drastic measures were needed to save it. But unlike the radicals before him, Boldyrev truly looks after the democratic republic, caring for the common man and ensuring that democracy is above all."
 RUS_social_security_system: "Building Social Security"
 RUS_social_security_system_desc: "The war has left too many Russians dead and many are unable to get back on their feet. A social safety net must be implemented so that life can begin to have a semblance of normalcy, and so they are able to support themselves and their families."
 RUS_republican_patriotism: "Republican Patriotism"
 RUS_republican_patriotism_desc: "The tyrants thought of patriotism as Russia being above all other nations, using it to justify their invasions and occupations. Instead, we see patriotism in a healthy and republican manner, being proud of our culture, history, and institutions."
 RUS_democracy_backed_by_tanks: "Democracy in Armour"
 RUS_democracy_backed_by_tanks_desc: "The dictatorship could have been averted if the army had enough of a spine to stop it, but they cared more for their own position than the defence of democracy. But under Boldyrev, the army is truly the first and last defence against tyranny. The coming generations will all know of the lengths Boldyrev went to to protect our free Russia."
 RUS_russia_in_german_world: "The Vozhd's Nightmare"
 RUS_russia_in_german_world_desc: "In a twist of fate, Russia now lives in a world where German domination has been solidified. Russia is not the world's greatest power, as many had dreamed of. We still aspire to be it one day, but for now, we must recognise the facts and do with what we can."
 RUS_donbass_economic_area: "Donbass Economic Zone"
 RUS_donbass_economic_area_desc: "Many Russian businesses now operate in the annexed Ukrainian regions, and it would be difficult to maintain the region's economy without some sort of agreement. A free trade agreement concerning the Volga and Donbass regions with Ukraine should aid in this."
 RUS_finding_allies: "Finding New Friends"
 RUS_finding_allies_desc: "We cannot stay in the German sphere of influence forever. It is time that the free and sovereign Russia looks outwards and begins to find new allies. After all, the Germans do not truly have our interests at heart."
 RUS_siberian_ultimatum: "Siberian Ultimatum"
 RUS_siberian_ultimatum_desc: "The Far Eastern Army is refusing to cooperate with us, having broken away from Moscow's rule at the beginning of the war. If they continue to not recognise our rule, we will have to send in the troops to quell the resistance."
 RUS_pacific_trade: "Pacific Trade"
 RUS_pacific_trade_desc: "To better bolster our relations with our new allies to the east, we will propose a comprehensive trade agreement with them. Hopefully, this will greatly bolster our economy and allow Russia to smoothly begin transforming into the power that it always has been, as well as further distancing ourselves from Berlin."

 RUS_legacy_of_workers_army: "The Legacy of Comrade Trotsky"
 RUS_legacy_of_workers_army_desc: "The Workers' and Peasants' Red Army was raised from the desolate, the poor, the hopeless. From this revolutionary mass of Russian workers and peasants, commanders like Lev Trotsky and Mikhail Tukhachevsky built a terrifying weapon, showing the workers that, yes, we can throw down our shackles if we simply choose to."
 RUS_heirs_of_stavka: "Heirs of the Stavka"
 RUS_heirs_of_stavka_desc: "The Workers' and Peasants' Red Army was raised in desperation and in chaos, and despite its good fight, its loss was inevitable. Even a proletarian army must be professional in nature, organised with the same principles as the army of our former bourgeois republic."
 RUS_death_to_white_army: "Withering of the White Army"
 RUS_death_to_white_army_desc: "The old Russian army was still, for all intents and purposes, the White Army. First, we threw out the reactionary warlords and aristocrats, and all those Cossacks and Svobodniks from the officer corps. Next, we must embark on the thorough destruction of the White ideas of individualism and conservatism, creating a new model of soldier to adore."
 RUS_commissars: "Ideological Commissars"
 RUS_commissars_desc: "The duty of a Revolutionary Commissar is both the education of the troops and the surveillance of their character and motivations. Chosen from the most ideologically reliable officers, they ensure that counter-revolutionary thought in the army is dealt with swiftly and decisively, both through a pistol and a book."
 RUS_military_independence: "Faith in the Army"
 RUS_military_independence_desc: "The army does not need constant micro-management. The commissars shall be elected by the men, to serve as instructors, not judges. We shall have faith in the exceptional quality of the Russian proletariat and the professionalism of the officer corps, and they shall be at their most effective."
 RUS_democratic_guard: "The Democratic Guards Formations"
 RUS_democratic_guard_desc: "The old Guards units were an example of bourgeois elitism and enforcement of the class system, even among common soldiers. Instead of pseudo-Imperial rabble, we have democratically represented Guards formations that form the pinnacle of the Red Army's combat capability, well-motivated and the best-equipped."
 RUS_basis_of_victory: "The Basis of Victory"
 RUS_basis_of_victory_desc: "The war is not won in the war games of high generals, but by the officers leading from the front. These men are aware of the situation and have infinitely better judgement than the General Staff at Moscow can ever have. As Tukhachevsky believes, the field commanders should be given a focus in education and in their ability to freely make decisions on the frontlines."
 RUS_sword_of_revolution: "The Sword of Revolution"
 RUS_sword_of_revolution_desc: "The socialist industrial proletariat, when unified behind a just cause, is able to produce more, better, and faster than any other pool of workers. With our mastery over production and the battlefield, our army will advance like rivers of steel and iron, in a never-ending industrial avalanche of armour."
 RUS_praporshchiks_generation: "The Praporshchiks Generation"
 RUS_praporshchiks_generation_desc: "In the old army, many were promoted due to their loyalty, or kept from promotions due to their political beliefs. In our new army, there is a risk of repeating the past by favouring political loyalty over skill. It is integral to avoid this, and keep our NCO corps - the praporshchiks - promoted on meritocratic principles."
 RUS_with_small_blood: "With the Least Blood"
 RUS_with_small_blood_desc: "Nothing is worse for morale than the feeling that the commanders are wasting away their men's lives. As a socialist republic, we are responsible to the people - and even the most common soldier deserves his life. The new doctrine greatly increases the role of support - entrenchment, reconnaissance, medicine - to better maintain troop morale and cohesion."
 RUS_glory_of_the_people_army: "The Russian Army Reborn"
 RUS_glory_of_the_people_army_desc: "The Russian Army draws its strength from the perseverance and willpower of the common Russian, accustomed to harsher conditions than any other civilised people. Our army does not seek to destroy this aspect, but rather seeks to be equal parts Revolutionary and Russian."
 RUS_deep_battle_focus: "Deep Battle Concept"
 RUS_deep_battle_focus_desc: "Much of Tukhachevsky's and Triandafillov's military-scientific work in emigration focused on the outlines of a new doctrine, based on Aleksandr Svechin's theoretical work. At its core, it is a method of battle that seeks to master the great geographic areas where the Russian battle is fought, with a single operation spanning from the breakthrough to the rapid exploitation."
 RUS_technological_supremacy: "Technological Supremacy"
 RUS_technological_supremacy_desc: "We socialists have infinite faith in progress and science. Better weapons are developed all the time, and they often mean that fewer of our own men have to die. In the hands of the proletariat, no machine is too terrible or destructive!"

 RUS_rehabilitate_red_army: "Rehabilitate the Red Army"
 RUS_rehabilitate_red_army_desc: "The Red Army is not a tragedy - it was a good attempt that did not go gently into the night. While some of the establishment officers dislike the Red émigrés, it is unquestionable that we need their conviction and expertise if we are to win the Final War."
 RUS_end_army_factionalism: "End Army Factionalism"
 RUS_end_army_factionalism_desc: "Even after the removal of the White generals, the army is hopelessly politicised - not the least because of the Bolshevik officers vying for power, but also the Eser officers opposing them, and Napoleons of their own life such as Tukhachevsky. Order is needed with a commander who can keep it."
 RUS_military_marxism: "Military Marxism"
 RUS_military_marxism_desc: "Our army cannot be like any other - it needs to be grounded in deep, fervent ideological belief and understanding. Marxism can be applied to understand societies and cause change in them; similarly, one can view warfare through war between classes. And in the end, it is the producing, fighting class that will triumph."
 RUS_punitive_brigades: "Separate Penal Brigades"
 RUS_punitive_brigades_desc: "We have no lack of prisoners, and often they have solid military training. These dissidents and Whites can be given a choice to avoid execution: service in the Red Army, washing away their crime."
 RUS_exhortation_organisation_reprisals: "Exhortation, Organisation, Reprisals"
 RUS_exhortation_organisation_reprisals_desc: "Opposition to our regime must be destroyed thoroughly - and if we must use the army against our internal enemies, we shall. With this reign of terror, domestic enemies will be rooted out by the military police, and separatist strongholds will be crushed with tanks."
 RUS_mother_russia_bleed_them_dry: "Mother Russia Bleeds Them Dry"
 RUS_mother_russia_bleed_them_dry_desc: "Russia does not need to win the war; we only need not to lose. Already in 1917, the Socialist-Revolutionaries and Left-Communists believed this - that the world revolution will come if we only keep fighting. Through widespread people's resistance, we will inflict on the invading army a thousand bleeding cuts."

 RUS_evaluate_VVFR: "Evaluate the VVFR"
 RUS_evaluate_VVFR_desc: "The Voeyenno-Vozdushny Flot Rossii (Military Air Fleet of Russia), an independent branch of the military since 1929, has evolved from a small bomber support group into a substantial force over the past few years. Nevertheless, many issues remain, including the replacement of obsolete or foreign aircraft and the reorganisation of air command."
 RUS_evalute_VVFR_tt: "This focus will fire an §Yevent§! which may increase §PMilitary Anger§!."
 RUS_new_airbases: "Air Defence Infrastructure"
 RUS_new_airbases_desc: "The growing Russian air fleet is constantly in need of new bases from which to operate. A recently proposed programme involves the construction of new air bases along our borders with the Reichspakt to swiftly respond to a potential invasion, while also providing nearby support to ground forces if necessary."
 RUS_state_aviation_bureau: "State Aviation Directorate"
 RUS_state_aviation_bureau_desc: "Thus far, military aviation projects have largely been developed according to individual orders from the state and public contract bidding, which has not only led to leaks of classified material, but also left aircraft design and production up to the whims of private firms. The State Aviation Directorate (Gosavia) is a new proposed office that will centralise the development and production of aircraft."
 RUS_aat_consortium_tt: "§COne military industrial organisation will be chosen to be upgraded. They must be employed on a research project or a production line to be available.§!"

 RUS_radar_system: "The RUS System"
 RUS_radar_system_desc: "Russia has experimented with electronic warfare since the Siege of Port Arthur, and great potential still remains untapped. The RUS (RadioUlavlivatel Samolyotov) Project is a reform to signals intelligence intended to concentrate electronic warfare resources in the most vital areas behind the lines. Greater stocks of radios, jamming transmitters, and cryptography machines will ensure that enemy communications are as disrupted as ours are secure."
 RUS_the_flying_tank: "The Flying Tank"
 RUS_the_flying_tank_desc: "A proposed assault aircraft, nicknamed the 'flying tank' by the Ilyushin design team for its armoured fuselage, has delivered promising results in recent competitions. Though it may not be as manoeuvrable as other CAS aircraft, the Russian design can operate effectively even under direct enemy fire. With an increase in funding, OSOAVIA is confident it can complete the project in the near future."
 RUS_polikarpov_fighters: "King Polikarpov"
 RUS_polikarpov_fighters_desc: "Nikolay Polikarpov, nicknamed 'the King of Fighters' by his colleagues at Duks, is one of the pioneers of modern Russian aviation. A consistent winner of military contract competitions since the early 1930s, his aircraft are the backbone of Russia's fighter force. With war clouds gathering, Polikarpov has promised to accelerate the rollout of a new generation of fighters to keep pace with developments in Germany and France."
 RUS_enter_hundred: "Enter the Sotnya"
 RUS_enter_hundred_desc: "With the growing need for bomber aircraft, it has become clear that resources must be redirected from other, less immediately useful investments like high-altitude fighter projects. Fortunately for us, Vladimir Petlyakov's 'Sotnya' (Hundred) is at the junction of several classes of aircraft and can be quickly converted into an excellent dive bomber."
 RUS_over_the_northern_skies: "Over the Northern Skies"
 RUS_over_the_northern_skies_desc: "The rather hostile situation on Russia's eastern border requires a new aircraft that can withstand both Japanese aviation and protect the Pacific Fleet from enemy carriers. Proposed by Aleksandr Seversky on the basis of his experience in the United States, the new long range planes can accompany our ships into hostile waters and harass an enemy far from home bases."
 RUS_army_of_air: "Armies of the Air"
 RUS_army_of_air_desc: "In General Aleksandr Lapchinsky's words, the air force is an expansion of the army in the third dimension. Instead of being a separate actor, it should be understood as another spatial dimension that both secures its field of operations - the sky - and utilises it to destroy enemies in all other dimensions."
 RUS_combined_arms_exercises: "Combined Arms Exercises"
 RUS_combined_arms_exercises_desc: "The concept of combined arms is simple enough, but its implementation requires rigorous drilling. Land forces must be taught to rely on air forces when necessary and to feed them with accurate information, and the pilots themselves must understand their role as soldiers in the sky, not as individualistic bogatyrs."
 RUS_personal_heroism: "Personal Heroism"
 RUS_personal_heroism_desc: "Russia's aviation academies have a wealth of experience, but their teaching is hindered by poorly-enforced curricula and ego-driven philosophical rivalries between schools. General Vyacheslav Baranov has proposed a harsh campaign to bring all academies up to a national standard, while also implementing a cooperative mentoring programme focusing on the personal ability and initiative of the trainees."
 RUS_fighter_bomber_synergy: "Fighter-Bomber Synergy"
 RUS_fighter_bomber_synergy_desc: "Fundamentally, the air force is divided based on the dimension of their targets. The destruction of aerial targets is useless on its own if it cannot be followed by the destruction of land-based targets. Coordination between these two roles is a core of efficient operational air warfare."
 RUS_bomber_clique: "[RUS_bomber_clique_name]"
 RUS_bomber_clique_normal: "The Strategic Dimension"
 RUS_bomber_clique_szrs: "The Terror Doctrine"
 RUS_bomber_clique_desc: "The air force is not a mere tool of the army, but a new kind of beast entirely. It allows us to target anything within a thousand miles: bridges, supply depots, headquarters, factories, and even civilian populations. Instead of being relegated to support roles, the VVFR should embrace its destiny as a harbinger of global destruction."
 RUS_long_range_bomber_command: "Directorate of Long-Range Action"
 RUS_long_range_bomber_command_desc: "The bombing force needs its own general staff, organised into what is essentially an air front. The Directorate of Long-Range Action (UDD) shall wield Russia's air power with the utmost precision and efficiency, handling both target acquisition and destruction."
 RUS_create_the_VDV: "Expand the ADV"
 RUS_create_the_VDV_desc: "Russia's airborne troops, having conducted their first parachute exercises in 1935, are the brainchild of General Vyacheslav Baranov, who has promoted the idea of paratroopers since the 1920s. ADV (Avia-Desantnye Voyska, or Air-Landing Forces) was formed as the experimental force, and now it is their time to prove themselves."
 RUS_operational_independence: "Operational Independence"
 RUS_operational_independence_desc: "The new VVFR can finally take pride in being its own branch entirely, with its own doctrine and command, standing proudly alongside the Army and the Navy. And it is merely a start - the future belongs to air power, as Seversky has always claimed."
 RUS_total_avitational_mobilisation: "Total Aviational Mobilisation"
 RUS_total_avitational_mobilisation_desc: "The rapid expansion of Russia's aircraft inventory and aviator cadres has made the VVFR one of the most powerful air forces in the world. Nevertheless, to prevent the current state of the VVFR from being simply a momentary advantage, the Stavka has prepared a plan for the consistent growth of the Russian air fleet, grounded on the streamlining of production lines paired with a new phase of expansion for aviation schools and youth clubs."
 RUS_rds_1: "RDS-1"
 RUS_rds_1_desc: "The 'Reactive Engine Special, model 1' is a nondescript name for the highly classified project assigned to a team under the leadership of renowned nuclear physicist Igor Kurchatov. Fragmentary reports from the Okhrana show a growing interest in secretive atomic research across the globe. The potential power released by the splitting of the atom is terrifying to contemplate, and Russia must ensure it is not left on the sidelines of history by such a weapon."
 RUS_project_m: "Project M"
 RUS_project_m_desc: "The 'Motor' Project, a revised successor of an earlier Project M rather unhelpfully labelled 'Minethrower', is an ongoing effort to fulfil the State Aviation Directorate's demand for a practical turbojet engine. This is no easy task, but early experiments have proved promising, and such an engine reaching mass production would give Russian aircraft a monumental advantage over the propeller-driven aircraft of their enemies."

 RUS_inspect_VMFR_desc: "The Voyenno-Morskoy Flot Rossii (Military Maritime Fleet of Russia) was severely damaged during the Russian Civil War and the ensuing economic crisis. Despite recent efforts, the current Russian Navy is still a far cry even from the old Imperial fleet. However, the Maritime Ministry has long prepared ambitious reform plans that could turn around the Navy's fortunes."
 RUS_promote_new_blood: "Promote New Blood"
 RUS_promote_new_blood_desc: "There are still many naval officers of the old era serving in the fleet, even though a lot of young talent has been favoured in promotions. But as the old generation is increasingly retiring, a new influx of gifted naval officers is needed. More resources need to be put into naval education to ensure a steady flow of gifted men for the navy."
 RUS_garden_of_explosives: "Garden of Explosives"
 RUS_garden_of_explosives_desc: "The art of mine-laying is perhaps what made Kolchak a legend of defensive naval operations. Under his direction, the Baltic Sea was made into a cold, wet hell for German shipping. So it shall be once more!"
 RUS_torpedo_bomber_project: "Ships of the Air"
 RUS_torpedo_bomber_project_desc: "The notable lack of modern aircraft in the VMFR has led to a somewhat belated project to bring such an aircraft into Russia's armoury. Major aircraft engineers such as Ilyushin and Tupolev have already received orders and additional funding to start developing not only new naval bombers, but also more powerful and reliable anti-ship ordnance."
 RUS_naval_infantry: "Naval Guards Infantry"
 RUS_naval_infantry_desc: "Experiences in the Great War and Civil War have proven the value of dedicated naval infantry units. Admiral Kolchak has patronised small brigades of 'Naval Riflemen' since first establishing them in 1919, but attempts to expand have been stonewalled by Army obstructionism. The Naval Riflemen's independence under Navy command must be recognised, and their numbers increased to finally make them a force to be reckoned with."
 RUS_attack_submarine_brigades: "Attack Submarine Squadrons"
 RUS_attack_submarine_brigades_desc: "The disparity of naval assets between the VMFR and the Kriegsmarine, in particular the large surface fleets, shows that an alternative approach to winning the naval war at sea may be pursued. To that end, the submarine forces are to be completely reorganised into squadrons, for no matter how big the shield may be, one cannot defend from all directions, and the vastness of the underwater seas offers no shortage of attack vectors."
 RUS_new_generation_hunters: "Hunters of the New Generation"
 RUS_new_generation_hunters_desc: "'Cruiser Submarine' theories, which advocate for greater independence and initiative for submarine forces, have gained increasing traction in the Maritime Ministry. This is an innovative tactic for the Russian Navy, which has traditionally relied on the interaction of surface and submarine ships, but it also requires the significant modernisation of the ageing submarine fleet."
 RUS_floating_battery_doctrine: "Floating Battery Doctrine"
 RUS_floating_battery_doctrine_desc: "With the launching of the 'Izmail Class' Battleship 'General Alekseyev' in 1930, came a glimpse of Kolchak's vision for the future of the Russian surface fleet. A fleet that would be concentrated around large vessels packed with enormous firepower, being able to engage in stand-off attacks against targets at long ranges."
 RUS_armored_destroyer: "The Armoured Destroyer"
 RUS_armored_destroyer_desc: "The concept of Armoured Destroyers was born out of the rather deplorable state of the Russian Navy in the late 20s. While our plans aim to restore the VMFR to its former glory, this cannot be done overnight, and ships are needed today. The concept itself advocates for the creation of larger 'Destroyer Leaders', which can take on the role of cruisers or even replace our conventional destroyers outright."
 RUS_naval_engineers: "Naval Engineers"
 RUS_naval_engineers_desc: "For the past century, the engineering and technical staff of the Russian Navy has served mainly in the Corps of Ship Engineers. The Corps, made up of civil servants only hired by the Navy on contract, is an outdated institution. The proposed replacement of the Corps of Ship Engineers by the Naval Engineering Service will increase the efficiency and integration of our technical staff."
 RUS_linkor_programme: "Linkor Programme"
 RUS_linkor_programme_desc: "'Linkor', a shortening from 'Lineyny Korabl' (Ship of the Line), is a Russian designation for battleships. Listed as a headliner element of the Grand Sea Shipbuilding Programme, the construction of new battleships will allow our fleet to emerge from its terrible state and, finally, compete with the fleets of other countries on equal footing."
 RUS_kronstadt_project: "Kronstadt Project"
 RUS_kronstadt_project_desc: "The Kronstadt Project, proposed by one of the brilliant admirals of the new generation, Nikolay Kuznetsov, became the subject of heated discussions at the Maritime Ministry. The final design of the aircraft carrier it proposed was adopted as part of the High Seas Fleet project, despite the rather ambiguous attitude towards it. However, even after being accepted, the project requires additional funding to complete."
 RUS_global_power_projection: "Renewal of the High Seas Navy"
 RUS_global_power_projection_desc: "The High Seas Fleet Project, the vision that our Maritime Ministry has been striving towards for over a decade, is now closer than ever. Our new role in the world calls for the ability to project power over vast distances, in the high seas of the world, and for this, we need a new, stronger fleet of capital ships."

Foolishly, they believe that the Russian navy is no match for them - but our latest naval reforms will show them otherwise. For the first time in hundreds of years, foreign boots will be marching on London."
 RUS_operation_rozhestvensky: "Operation Rozhestvensky"
 RUS_operation_rozhestvensky_desc: "Our nation is once again at war with the Empire of Japan. It has been decades since the Japanese Navy crushed our Second Pacific Squadron in the Russo-Japanese War, but it's finally time for a reckoning. The new Russian High Seas Fleet shall serve as the vanguard to a full naval invasion of the Japanese islands. We will finally avenge Tsushima!"
 RUS_third_naval_armament_program: "Third Naval Armament Programme"
 RUS_third_naval_armament_program_desc: "In 1923, Kolchak launched a naval programme for the repair and retrofitting of the ageing Russian Navy. In 1927, he started a second two-stage naval programme for the construction of the first post-Great War light ships that lasted until 1935. Despite this, the VMFR is still severely outdated, and many issues continue to plague our dockyards. We are going to need a new naval programme, one that will aim for the total rearmament of the VMFR."
 RUS_yekaterinas_legacy: "Yekaterina's Legacy"
 RUS_yekaterinas_legacy_desc: "Created during the reign of Catherine the Great, the Black Sea Fleet was one of the main powers in Russia's continuous wars with the Turks. Now, after the loss of Crimea, the Black Sea Fleet is based in Novorossiysk, the port capacities of which are nowhere near that of lost Sevastopol. If we want to compete with the Reichspakt and Ottomans in the Black Sea, then Novorossiysk must be transformed into a home fit for a world-class fleet."
 RUS_petrograd_dockyards: "Gateway to the Baltic"
 RUS_petrograd_dockyards_desc: "Petrograd, the largest port in Russia, has fallen into decay over the past 15 years. The Baltic and Admiralty shipyards have lost half of their capabilities, and the port facilities of Kronstadt are teetering on the brink of scandalous neglect. A broad programme of repair and remediation must be initiated at once if Russia is to stand a chance of catching up with her rivals on the high seas."
 RUS_eastern_shores: "Dalzavod"
 RUS_eastern_shores_desc: "The Pacific Fleet, created in 1932 from the Siberian and Amur flotillas, is in a deplorable state. The defeat in the Russo-Japanese War and the unrest of the Civil War have both left deep scars. The Dalzavod shipyards of Vladivostok used to be one of the largest in the empire, and if we are to restore our grip on the Pacific, it needs to be a great harbour again."

 RUS_kolchaks_dream_desc: "The active use of the Northern Sea Route began in 1919, and it continued after the Civil War thanks to Admiral Kolchak's significant personal investment and support. In connection with the high-profile exploration of the Arctic, and especially the Northern Sea Route in the past few years, the Northern Sea Route Committee has proposed an ambitious plan to transform Arkhangelsk into a communications and shipbuilding hub for the entire region."
 RUS_warm_water_port: "Our Warm Water Port"
 RUS_warm_water_port_desc: "Despite Russia's long coastline, we have historically been plagued by a persistent lack of a warm water port that doesn't freeze in the winter months for our military. With our influence entrenched in the land of Persia, we finally have one in the city of Fars on the Indian Ocean, far away from European, Japanese or American reach."

 ###Foreign Policy###

 RUS_third_europe: "Third Europe"
 RUS_third_europe_desc: "In the post-Great War world, two political blocs have emerged: the first directed from Berlin, subjugating much of Central and Eastern Europe, and the second directed from Paris, calling for socialist revolution all across the world. Moscow has never been part of either, and as we reaffirm our ambitions, this third bloc shall become a reality, liberating Europe from the Kaiser's slave armies and Bolshevism."
 RUS_moscow_accord_threat: "Formation of the Moscow Accord"
 RUS_end_vilnius_agreement: "End the Vilnius Agreement"
 RUS_end_vilnius_agreement_desc: "The Vilnius Accord in 1926 was the final humiliation. Gripped by the economic crisis, President Aleksandr Guchkov signed a deal with the Devil and gave Germany considerable access and benefits to the Russian economy. Yes, this led to economic growth - but also the entrenchment of German capital in Russia."

 RUS_petrograd_security: "Petrograd Security"
 RUS_petrograd_security_desc: "Petrograd is now the former capital for a reason; as it is situated close to the Baltic Countries and Finland, any great powers could use these countries as a base through which to decisively strike and occupy the city, delivering a significant blow to our morale and industry. If we are to protect it, security measures with our neighbours must be made regardless of their opposition."
 RUS_sponsor_belgrade: "Sponsor Belgrade"
 RUS_sponsor_belgrade_desc: "Serbia, Romania, Greece - a trifecta of Balkan states have begun to band together once again in opposition to German domination. Few in Europe are as amicable to us as they are, and through cooperation with them we can ensure that they, as well as us, can accomplish our dreams of a new European order."
 RUS_operation_yekaterina: "Finalise Operation Yekaterina"
 RUS_operation_yekaterina_desc: "If total war with Germany is to be Russia's fate, we must develop specific plans for said war. Operation Yekaterina, as it is codenamed, will lay out the details of an offensive strike into Eastern Europe unlike anything ever seen before, not in Europe nor the world. To develop the operation, we shall assemble the high-ranking generals from the Stavka and work out any differences in thought."
 RUS_fifth_column: "The Fifth Columnists"
 RUS_fifth_column_desc: "The entire basis of the Ostwall's security is that they are held up in part by the German armed forces and in part by forced anti-Russian sentiment. They seem to underestimate the fact that much of Eastern Europe despises Berlin just as much, a fact that we will utilise to our greatest potential. We will arm and organise dissidents all throughout the Oststaaten to spread as much chaos as possible and help secure our war aims."
 RUS_preemptive_war: "The Pre-Emptive War"
 RUS_preemptive_war_desc: "The time to avenge Russia's humiliation has finally arrived. The Teutonic slavemaster will be smashed from Eastern Europe, but we will not rest until our banners have been draped across the Reichstag. Arise, mighty motherland, arise for the final struggle!"

 #Postwar
 RUS_rebirth_of_russia: "Rebirth of Russia"
 RUS_rebirth_of_russia_desc: "Germany is defeated. The Kaiserreich has been shattered, destroyed beyond all recognition. Victory is ours, but there is no time to celebrate. Already our former allies move against us, seeking to fill the power vacuum that has been left in the wake of Germany's defeat. Much of our former territories now lie unprotected, free to fold back into Mother Russia's warm embrace."
 RUS_free_baltic_in_free_russia: "The Baltic Question"
 RUS_free_baltic_in_free_russia_desc: "The Baltics are crucial to our own security, the region lying close to many of our most important cities. It is a place that holds many a grudge against our nation. Additionally, unlike Ukraine and Belarus, they have never been part of the triune Russian nation. The Baltics cannot be left to their own devices, but perhaps we should consider a degree of autonomy for them."
 RUS_baltic_accord: "The Baltic Accord"
 RUS_baltic_accord_desc: "The Baltics are crucial to our own security, the region lying close to many of our most important cities. It is a place that holds many a grudge against our nation, and military intervention to secure the area would only create more issues for us in the long term. Their wish for independence will be respected, but an economic pact to tie us closer together would go a long way to assuage our fears."
 RUS_master_of_baltic: "Master of the North"
 RUS_master_of_baltic_desc: "Finland, and to a lesser extent the other Nordic nations, have always been a threat to us. Situated on our most northern border, they have prime targets in Petrograd and an open route to Moscow after that. We must look to secure either their loyalty or friendship to protect our great nation from any attacks from the region, and what is better to cultivate friendship than money?"
 RUS_union_with_ukraine: "Union with Ukraine"
 RUS_union_with_ukraine_desc: "We have had a troubled history with Ukraine, the region never quite acknowledging Moscow's authority through the centuries they have been under our control or protection. Ukrainians are our brothers, and an effort to treat them as such would certainly go a lot further than oppressing them. To that end, we shall grant them similar rights to our own citizens, provide them with good governance and protection. Treat them like family, and they shall soon embrace us."
 RUS_brotherhood_with_belarus: "Brotherhood with Belarus"
 RUS_brotherhood_with_belarus_desc: "Belorussia was the cradle of our movement to destroy the Reds, a loyal part of our empire that provided us with much support through times of great trouble. This support has never been appreciated enough, and this is something that we should remedy quickly. A modern Russia loves and supports its people, and so we will grant the Belorussians rights equal to our own. They will have a strong place in our new nation, protected and governed by the very best."
 RUS_destroy_partisans: "The Partisan War"
 RUS_destroy_partisans_desc: "Not everyone has welcomed Russian rule, and the partisan movement that we have faced is much more intense than we had expected. We must redouble our efforts and clear out these if we expect to have a degree of normalcy in the recovered territories."

 RUS_anti_internationale: "Anti-Internationale Pact"
 RUS_anti_internationale_desc: "Who poses a greater threat to European and world civilisation than the socialist schemers in Paris and London? For too long have the slogans of world revolution threatened to destroy all that is good. It is about time that Russia, now the anti-communist bulwark of the world, led the way and protected all endangered nations from the red menace."
 RUS_curtain_across_europe: "Curtain Across Europe"
 RUS_curtain_across_europe_desc: "The Great Patriotic War was hell for all those involved. Even if it was necessary to protect Russia and to reclaim her pride and national integrity, we would never have done it if we truly had a choice. Europe is now divided and it seems that neither side shall seek to break the balance - a twilight struggle of free nations and communist dictatorships is about to unfold."

 RUS_restoration_of_AMTORG: "Restoration of the AMTORG"
 RUS_restoration_of_AMTORG_desc: "The brutal civil war in America has finished, a victor finally emerging from the terrible slog of brother fighting brother. American trade is incredibly beneficial for us as a nation, and there is no doubt that they are in desperate need of rebounding trade relations as well. Ideology must be set aside for once, and the flow of commerce shall resume."
 RUS_approach_entente: "Approach the Entente"
 RUS_approach_entente_desc: "Our former allies are in a wretched state, left huddling in the remnants of their empires. Once proud nations driving the industrial revolution, they barely have enough industry to support an army capable of taking back their homelands. This provides opportunities for us, as equipment for them is always in short supply. Through RUSKAPA we could secretly funnel them weapons to equip these armies, in exchange for their unused dockyards. A win for both sides, to rekindle our relationship."
 RUS_franco_russian_treaty: "Franco-Russian Treaty"
 RUS_franco_russian_treaty_desc: "The reality is that the Internationale's participation in the war against Germany will be a necessary factor if we are to overturn the old order. For now, we must put our ideological squabbles aside and work together to defeat the German menace. As the first step, a trade agreement will be proposed for the benefit of both sides, which will allow for the provision of Russian raw materials to the west while we reap the rewards of their high-quality technology."
 RUS_kama_tank_centre: "The Kama Training Centre"

 RUS_eureka_conference: "The Eureka Conference"
 RUS_eureka_conference_desc: "The situation in Europe is tense; Moscow and Paris have become the leaders of two different power blocs, spanning east and west. While we certainly have a bone to pick with the communists, it is certainly not worth an even more destructive war than the last. We will invite the leaders of the socialist bloc to a conference of peace - codenamed 'Eureka', as it shall be a breakthrough in international relations."
 RUS_eureka_conference_tt: "We will settle the postwar situation with the §rInternationale§!, potentially imposing §Ymutual guarantees§! on neutral countries and §Yarmy limits§!.\n\nAdditionally, depending on our leverage, we may be able to force the §rInternationale§! to white peace with the §cEntente§!, if they exist."

 RUS_pacify_the_frontier_desc: "Conquering the region of Turkestan would be beneficial to us, that much is true. Yet we do not need the empty deserts to be ruled directly to keep our influence in the region. Cultivating them into a strong and subordinate ally would make the area much more secure.

Sometimes friends, sometimes enemies, we have not established a formal diplomatic policy for our diplomats in the country, much to their annoyance. A closer relationship could certainly be formed, in some way. However, the Iranian state is in a lot of turmoil, and whoever rises to the top might have a less than favourable view of us.

We should decide on a particular country to focus our efforts on, as that would give us the highest chance of success."

 RUS_caucasus: "Caucasian Limitrophes"
 RUS_caucasus_desc: "The civil war which encompassed our nation allowed the vultures to circle in, and whilst we were weak, the Germans carved out their piece. Not content with the treaty, they established puppet republics in the southern mountains with help from the Turks, completely at the whims and wills of German business. We must bring the people of the Caucasus back under our authority, severing the strings that pit them against us and better controlling our southern flank."
 RUS_old_enemy: "The Old Enemy"
 RUS_old_enemy_desc: "Twelve times the Russians and Ottomans have come to blows, but none have been decisive enough to lay either to rest. Had it not been for the stab in the back during the Great War from Bolshevik forces, we would have put the dying empire in its grave. Now, as the Russian people are united more than ever before, we can finally achieve that aim."
 RUS_new_brother: "The New Brother"
 RUS_new_brother_desc: "Our centuries-long animosity with the Turks is a fact of history, but in reality, we share a lot more in common with them than we do with the French or Germans.

Wars, insurgents, and trouble are rife; yet this provides us with an opportunity to influence the region in a more hands-on manner. At the suggestion of some of our generals, a military mission will be sent to assist one of the various factions attempting to unify the region.

 RUS_night_witches_idea_desc: "Their planes are so small that radar can't locate them. They never use radio, so systems can't pick them up either. They appear unexpectedly, like ghosts, at night."

 RUS_army_of_air_idea: "Army of the Air"
 RUS_army_of_air_idea_desc: "Each country must have its own aviation that matches it - and Russia requires the matching air army consisting of many aviation units, the main goal of which is to facilitate the advancement of offensive armies forward."
 RUS_strategic_dimension_idea: "[RUS_bomber_clique_name]"
 RUS_strategic_dimension_idea_desc: "The real value of aviation lies in its ability to change the global balance of power - and Russian aviation is ready to destroy factories in enemy territory, rather than destroy enemy tanks and planes one by one on the battlefield."

 RUS_attack_submarine_idea: "Attack Submarine Squadrons"
 RUS_attack_submarine_idea_desc: "Russian submariners receive extensive training, their ships are prepared for long voyages and the absence of surface support. The new tactics reward the brave."

 RUS_new_russian_culture_1: "Political-Technical Education"
 RUS_new_russian_culture_1_desc: "Scientific and technological progress is the main force driving society forward, as well as political literacy, which stops populist demagogues and cements society. Knowledge of mathematics, physics and political science should be prestigious in modern Russia, and even the last Siberian peasant should know Pythagoras' theorem and Herzen's ideas."
 RUS_new_russian_culture_2: "Spiritual-Cultural Education"
 RUS_new_russian_culture_2_desc: "Can an analyst write the Ruslan and Lyudmila? Can a statistician perform an act of will and rebel against oppression? The task of education is not only the development of intellectual abilities, but also emotional maturation and the formation of will - and until the last peasant child becomes a Knight of Terror, the task will not be accomplished."
 RUS_new_russian_culture_idea: "New Russian Culture"
 RUS_new_russian_culture_idea_desc: "The new Russian man will improve the life of all Russians with his selfless efforts and will use his creative flair for the good of the Motherland, where new morality will come to the fore.

 RUS_national_solidarism_idea: "System of Solidarity"
 RUS_national_solidarism_idea_desc: "Russia is guided by the principle of optimal support: society provides its citizens with active support in what they cannot do on their own, and, on the contrary, does not relieve them of efforts that they can manage with."
 RUS_solidarist_economy: "National-Labour System"
 RUS_solidarist_economy_desc: "The role of the Russian government is to guide private initiatives, not to control them - state intervention can only be justified by the abuse of freedom and activities that harm the state. Together with extensive social programs and a well-oiled administrative machine, every citizen of Russia can enjoy freedoms and public protection at the same time."
 RUS_eurasian_autarky: "Eurasianist Etatism"
 RUS_eurasian_autarky_desc: "Russia is its own autarkic world. The fate of this world in its nature and importance is separated from Europe and Asia. The fate of a separate culture is analogous to the fate of a separate personality - and who, if not a slave, relies on others for everything?"

 RUS_VRBO: "Resistance Cells"
 RUS_VRBO_desc: "Not all Russians are willing to give up their hard-won freedoms. Socialist-led resistance continues operating in Russia, striking against Savinkov's regime through means of terror and non-compliance, while more moderate opponents are simply fleeing the country.\n\n§gThis national spirit can be removed by taking the decision §YEradication of Anti-Russian Resistance§!, unlocked by the focus §YGosstrazha§!.§!"

 RUS_post-savinkov_economy: "Remnants of Voznesenshchina"
 RUS_post-savinkov_economy_desc: "The state-planned economic system under the VES, nicknamed the Voznesenshchina, thoroughly disrupted the Russian economy. Now that the planning council has been defunded and political support for the system withdrawn, what is left are massively bureaucratic state companies in total chaos. While many companies have been returned to their previous owners, there are still many other state companies that must be reorganised."
 RUS_post-soc_economy: "Remnants of Redistribution"
 RUS_post-soc_economy_desc: "Russian property ownership was once again put into chaos. Under socialist policies, most factories ended up in state ownership, or owned by 'workers' councils'. All supply chains are in chaos, and many refuse to accept the restoration of rule of law. While we are willing to tolerate some of this redistribution, thieves and robbers must not be rewarded either."
 RUS_republic_under_watch: "Republic Under Watch"
 RUS_republic_under_watch_desc: "The Russian army graciously restored our democracy, but make no mistake: they are the most powerful interest group in Russia. They watch every move of the government, and will make their displeasure clear - or worse - if their advice is not heeded."

 RUS_new_russian_capitalism_idea: "New Russian Capitalism"
 RUS_new_russian_capitalism_idea_desc: "In the new Russia, the rewards of hard work and toil do not go to the big businessmen of Moscow, or the shady bureaucrats of the SZRS - but they go to the people. In people's capitalism, small business - both urban and rural - forms the backbone of Russia, and leeches who seek to take more than their share of our common resources are justly taxed until they learn humility."
 RUS_state_economic_committee: "State Economic Committee"
 RUS_state_economic_committee_desc: "A market economy is like an orchestra, and the State Economic Committee (Goseko) is its conductor. Composed of financial and economic experts and representatives of major businesses, they maintain the balance between the state and private interest - and ideally, make both richer and more prosperous in the process through rational investment and deregulation."
 RUS_state_economic_committee_solonevich: "Duma of Industry and Labour"

 RUS_liberal_intelligentsia: "Liberal Intelligentsia"

 RUS_separation_of_powers: "Separation of Powers"
 RUS_separation_of_powers_desc: "Eager to ensure that the President is never again able to use a majority in the Duma to dismantle the democratic system, the new government has gone to great lengths to enforce that no branch of government can easily overpower the other. While the new system makes it significantly harder to amend the constitution or to speedily push through important laws, it will hopefully protect Russian democracy from the ambitions of yet another power-hungry populist."
 RUS_powerful_executive: "Powerful Executive"
 RUS_powerful_executive_desc: "In a restored democratic Russia, the executive will still be powerful enough to bypass the bickering Duma if the conditions necessitate it. While it will never be allowed as much power as it had under the Svobodnik regime, certain concessions to practicality have to be made to ensure our government can react quickly to the rapidly changing situation in the world."
 RUS_working_peasant_programme: "Working Peasant Programme"

 RUS_democratic_artels: "Democratic Artels"
 RUS_democratic_artels_desc: "The artel system created by Savinkov has been retained - and yet it is now almost unrecognisable. Instead of an oppressive state-managed network of enterprises where managers tried to squeeze every drop of blood and sweat from the workers, we have now established a system where the workplace is managed democratically by all its employees, who are now protected from unsupervised exploitation by agents of the state."

 RUS_protection_decree: "Imperial Decree on Protection of the People and the State"
 RUS_protection_decree_desc: "The decree is freezing the Duma's ability to initiate a vote of no confidence and greatly empowering the executive branch as a temporary measure to restore stability in the country.

 RUS_wrangel_dictatorship: "Empowered Imperial Cabinet"
 RUS_wrangel_dictatorship_desc: "The executive branch was granted rights to bypass the Duma by appealing to [RUS.GetLeader]. This reduced bureaucracy in the most important sectors of the government apparatus and sped up decision-making on critical issues."
 RUS_wrangel_dictatorship_2: "Organic Monarchy"
 RUS_wrangel_dictatorship_2_desc: "Although some would call the Russian monarchy an autocratic regime, in fact it is an organic unity of the sovereign with the population, where the monarch constantly concerns about the daily bread and safety of his people, rather than try to enrich himself or the elites at their expense."

Though revanchism once burnt bright, the bear has been relegated to a second, perhaps even third-rate power. Some predict that one day Russia will rise again, but for now, the country lies shattered."

 ### Socialist Ideas ###
 RUS_workers_control: "Workers' Control"
 RUS_workers_control_desc: "While the slogan of 'Workers' Control' is appealed to ubiquitously within the socialist coalition, it is often left unsaid as to what this entails. Those in the VST-Centre favour a model emulating that of France, a relatively decentralised plan conducted through the trade unions and the executive organs of syndicalist democracy. The VST-Left and SR-Maximalists defend the old model of the Bolsheviks - a single economic plan of production organised by a central council operating through the pyramid-structure of the Soviets. Finally, there are the various elements on the Right who speak of control through cooperatives and representative organs with veto power over managers under a transitional market economy.\n\nIn the chaos of the revolution, most factories have simply been taken over directly by factory committees or squatting employees. With the technicians and directors driven out, the administrative and technical skill is lacking, and discipline is lax. Many factories remain idle with workers absent, and there have even been cases of workers simply appropriating factory funds for their own benefit. However, for the most part, spirits are high, and the working class is ready to take direction from its representatives and build a new society."

Finally, there are the various elements on the Right who speak of control through cooperatives and representative organs with veto power over managers under a transitional market economy.\n\nThe Left Eser Aleksandr Elyashevich and the Danist Aleksandr Finn-Yenotayevsky have finally brought forth a new economic dynamic that many Russians have now witnessed. As the businessmen of old are no longer able to oppose the interests of the working class through the abolition of private property, unions, cooperatives and artels have stepped in to take their place, with the state only taking direct control of the most important national industries whilst acting as the final arbiter to regulate and provide for other economic matters."

Finally, there are the various elements on the Right who speak of control through cooperatives and representative organs with veto power over managers under a transitional market economy.\n\nTo take full advantage of the few resources we own and build a vision to rival and succeed all others requires a high degree of oversight. A system with vast control to effectively coordinate and execute the most complex of tasks for the road ahead and beyond. As such, the Maximalists have decided to rely on a cartel-type state-planned economy all too similar to that of the Bolsheviks."

Secondly, it was created to integrate Yakov Blyumkin's anti-Savinkov resistance, the All-Russian Combat Organisation, into the government. As such, Blyumkin serves at the head of an agency with direct experience in subversive actions against reactionaries - creating a ruthless and uncompromising force, but a fundamentally bipartisan one due to Blyumkin's credentials with both the SR's and Bolsheviks."

 RUS_legacy_of_narodism: "Peace and Bread"
 RUS_legacy_of_narodism_desc: "While Narodism evolved as a separate movement than Marxism, its historical role in the development of both Russian revolutionary thought and indeed on the Russian proletariat themselves cannot be understated. As part of the VST Right's broad approach to governance, Narodnik slogans have been reintroduced into government propaganda, and cultural programs have begun to ensure that all are aware that the Workers' Coalition is creating a Russia of the Whole Narod, not just the workers in the cities."

 RUS_unions_fury: "Fury of the Unions"
 RUS_unions_fury_desc: "The unions and [ROOT.GetLeader]'s approach to subsequent economic planning are at odds. As the system of labour unions begins to centralise, union leaders are wondering just how far the VST-Left are willing to go in their designs to Plan the economy -- even at the expense of Union autonomy."
 RUS_proletarian_transition: "Proletarian Transition"
 RUS_proletarian_transition_desc: "The party has begun initiatives to strengthen Soviet Democracy by allowing local Councils and Factory Committees more autonomy in their local affairs, developing both socialist democracy and strengthening the dictatorship of the proletariat."
 RUS_democratic_dictatorship_idea: "Proletarian Hegemony"
 RUS_democratic_dictatorship_idea_desc: "For Comrade Zinovyev, the distinction between authentic revolutionary Marxism and any other 'popular' movement lies in the question of the hegemony of the proletariat. Condemning the 'fetish' of democracy, Zinovyev has made it clear that the VST needs to understand that beyond any adherence to formal procedures for conducting elections, their utmost task is to maintain the hegemony of the proletariat over any territories the organisation rules. The VST is to consider itself the party of the proletariat and to perform whatever actions are necessary to maintain the rule of that class. The party is not to rule out depriving its opponents of the franchise or of suspending any body that takes up a hostile attitude to the proletariat and its party. The proletariat is nothing more than the advanced representative of all the oppressed, and it must take its place at the head of this struggle and drag the other classes with it, tolerating them as long as they subordinate themselves to its leadership and aims."
 RUS_totalism_idea: "Between Bolshevism and Maximalism"
 RUS_totalism_idea_desc: "While in the West, Totalism refers to an ad-hoc alliance of romanticists, national-syndicalists, and other social-imperialists, here in Russia, the slogan of Total Devotion to the Revolution has been carried by both the SR-Maximalists and the Bolshevik remnants. With this informal alliance growing stronger by the day, 'Russian Totalism' may soon get its chance to distinguish itself from the West."
 RUS_subdued_unions: "Subdued Unions"
 RUS_subdued_unions_desc: "According to Zinovyev's designs, all of the unions have been merged into the VTsSPS under the control of an appointed committee. While still formally independent, the legislative and executive functions of this new union body are non-existent, and the control of the VST over it is entirely undisputed. The VST-Left hails this as a victory for class unity and anti-bureaucratic reform, and designates to the new body a purely economic and administrative function. This bold measure is plainly a victory of Leninist forms of organisation over syndicalist forms."
 RUS_centralised_unions: "Centralised Unions"
 RUS_centralised_unions_desc: "Despite Zinovyev's best efforts, a coalition in favour of the radical centralisation of the unions has failed to develop and oppose the unionists and VST moderates. A compromise has instead been reached, and the VST-Left is heavily dependent on the goodwill of a number of actors within the VTsSPS and its associated unions. The VTsSPS is now at least nominally under the influence of the VST, but the body remains beholden to many of its subordinate unions and holds onto many of its executive and legislative functions. Like in France, syndicalism has been centralised, but maintained."
 RUS_technocratic_syndicalism_idea: "Workers' Accounting and Control"
 RUS_technocratic_syndicalism_idea_desc: "The centralising measures of the VST are transforming society into a single factory and single office, and placing in the hands of the proletariat everything they need for the smooth operation of production. All citizens have been transformed into employees of the state, with equality of work and pay, performing their tasks diligently. The accounting and control required of a modern economy and administration have been greatly simplified, and all are learning to administer social production. Soon, any cook shall govern, and the first bold step will be taken into communism. At last, Lenin's testament has been fulfilled."
 RUS_to_protect_democracy: "To Secure Hegemony"
 RUS_to_protect_democracy_desc: "The VST has forcibly asserted itself over the Soviets and unions, declaring the situation to be too dire to allow non-proletarian elements to potentially operate within the bodies of socialist power. A single central committee composed of the leaders of the VST now governs, issuing decrees that take precedence over any other executive or legislative organ. Above all else, the hegemony of the proletariat will be secured."

 RUS_fedplan: "Fedplan"
 RUS_workers_control_desc_base: "While the slogan of 'Worker's Control' is appealed to ubiquitously within the socialist coalition, it is often left unsaid as to what this entails. Those in the VST-Centre favour a model emulating that of France, a relatively decentralised plan conducted through the trade unions and the executive organs of syndicalist democracy. The VST-Left and SR-Maximalists defend the old model of the Bolsheviks - a single economic plan of production organised by a central council operating through the pyramid-structure of the Soviets. Finally, there are the various elements on the Right who speak of control through cooperatives and representative organs with veto power over managers under a transitional market economy."
 RUS_fedplan_desc: "$RUS_workers_control_desc_base$\n\nOn the basis of the original ideal of our Parisian comrades, the apparatus of planning has taken on a diffuse and decentralised form, with much autonomy granted to the proletarians through their representation in factory committees and their relevant trade unions. Through the mediation of the VTsSPS, all of these autonomous organs function together in a harmonious network, ensuring most of the administrative functions of industry can be carried out by the workers in their firms. Constantly striving against bureaucracy, our system allows for the maximum expression of the self-activity and creativity of the masses. What else can the association of free and equal producers mean than production, accounting, and regulation by the working class itself?"
 RUS_NEP: "New Russian Socialism"
 RUS_NEP_desc: "$RUS_workers_control_desc_base$\n\nThe programme of 'New Russian Socialism' grants a high degree of power to workers in the management of their workplaces, alongside the nationalisation of crucial industry, but, in an appeal to Kautsky's Orthodox Marxism, has maintained both market mechanisms in its 'planning' as well as broad allowance for both cooperatives and small enterprises. Only through the gradual transformation of the economy can the ideal of the association of free and equal producers be fulfilled!"
 RUS_NEP_SDS: "The Russian Path to Socialism"
 RUS_NEP_SDS_desc: "$RUS_workers_control_desc_base$\n\nThe programme of 'The Russian Road to Socialism' grants a high degree of power to workers in the management of their workplaces, alongside the nationalisation of crucial industry. However, the rest of the economy is organised in a system of democratically-run cooperatives, artels, and voluntary collectives. With this free and equal association of producers, we hope to one day achieve the Communist mode of production."
 RUS_economic_planning: "Centralised Planning"
 RUS_economic_planning_desc: "$RUS_workers_control_desc_base$\n\nThe organs of economic control have taken on a highly centralised form, with a central office and council compiling statistics and data to produce an all-encompassing countrywide plan of production and distribution. Individual factories and firms have lost much of their autonomy, now mostly beholden to the organs of national planning, and as such, factory committees and trade unions have been increasingly side-lined in favour of this new apparatus. While some criticise this as a violation of the autonomy of the working class, firebrands on the left extol it as a bold step into communism. The anarchy of production under capitalism is being replaced by a definite plan, rational and systematic, carried out according to the needs of the community. National centralisation of the means of production will become the national basis of a society composed of associations of free and equal producers!"
 RUS_congress_of_unions: "Congress of Unions"
 RUS_congress_of_unions_desc: "The All-Russian Central Assembly of Trade Unions (or VTsSPS) is the Russian Socialists' answer to the French CGT or the British TUC. A theoretically equal and bicameral branch of the government consisting of the freely elected representatives of the various trade unions of Russia, the VTsSPS is the main instrument by which the Russian workers are able to directly participate in the new political system and guide the construction of the socialist economy."
 RUS_towards_post_scarity: "Towards the Highest Phase"
 RUS_towards_post_scarcity_desc: "With the unification of the Left and Right of the VST around a common Marxist platform, the time has come to consolidate the Revolution and prepare for the transition to a Communist mode of production in earnest. Both the coalition and the workers themselves are in high spirits, and even now people predict the onset of the new world."
 RUS_towards_devolved_state: "Withering Away of the State"
 RUS_towards_devolved_state_desc: "The VTsSPS has gradually seized more and more power for itself over the economic spheres of society, even as the local soviets have been delegated more and more of the administrative functions of the state. While the full realisation of Communism is still for future generations to imagine, we have marked an important step in the construction of a free Workers' Confederation."

 RUS_urbanisation_drive: "Sprawl of the Cities"
 RUS_urbanisation_drive_desc: "By far the quickest way to catch up - and perhaps in the future surpass - our opponents is to focus most of our development in the urban city centres.

 RUS_dignity_of_labour: "Dignity of Labour"
 RUS_dignity_of_labour_desc: "Against the plutocrats and oligarchs we are animated by a single ideal - to return to the toiler all that they produce. As a step towards this vision we have implemented a universal labour service embracing all of society. The ubiquitous system of scaling wages based on station and skill is being slowly replaced by the restriction of all to the average wage and the introduction of incentives beyond monetary ones. To unleash the full socialist potential of the peasant and reverse the progress of wealth stratification among them they must be encouraged to return to the land commune and hired labour must be prohibited. The hated plutocrats will toil the fields and work the factories, becoming one with the people."
 RUS_peasant_worker_unity: "Peasant-Worker Unity"
 RUS_peasant_worker_unity_desc: "Many disciples of the old RSDRP have preached the message that the peasantry are petty-bourgeois, an idea we are trying to convey as absurd to the people of Russia. Properly understood the worker and peasant can be recognised as part of one labouring class, as proven by the fact that our peasantry are escaping their exploitation by rent and taxes to build socialism among the land commune. In an effort for the peasant and proletarian to recognise their existence as one class a dialogue is being opened up through shared institutions of governance and culture and proletarians without a familial connection to the land are being encouraged to visit the peasant commune."
 RUS_concordance_with_the_church: "Combatting Spiritual Reaction"
 RUS_concordance_with_the_church_desc: "While some dogmatic fools insist that socialism and religion are wholly incompatible, especially among the VST, we have no wish to crush the peasant's religious spirit. The Orthodox Church has always been the strongest opponent to socialism however, and to curb their influence a staunch policy of secularism is being applied. Church lands are being nationalised and redistributed and all opposition from the ecclesiastical authorities is being responded to harshly. An effort is being made to convey to the peasant that while their personal and local religion is beyond reproach, the national Church authorities are acting against the new socialist society, and attempting to assert their interests against the separation of church and state."
 RUS_concordance_with_the_church_alt_desc: "Following on the positions of the Eser founder Viktor Chernov, the religious spirit of the peasant is attempting to be won over with appeals to socialism as an elevated moral philosophy, a secular religion. The hope is that this new doctrine will replace Orthodoxy in the hearts of the peasant. The Eser intellectuals shall be seen as apostles or saints of a movement guided by the higher ideal of social justice. This ideological offensive is being propagated through all manner of state institutions, but it remains to be seen whether it can really win over the hearts of the devout."

 RUS_sacred_war: "Sacred War"
 RUS_sacred_war_desc: "Before and during the Brest-Litovsk negotiations revolutionaries from the Left-Esers and a fiery left-oppositional section of the Bolsheviks opposed any peace deal with Germany. They instead favoured the course of a sacred war against imperialism, a revolutionary war waged by armies of peasants and workers that would sweep Europe clean of reaction and capitalism and plant the red flag firmly on its soil. The cowardly politics of Lenin and Trotsky robbed us of this but we have been given another chance to see it through.

 RUS_socialist_education: "Socialist Education Programme"
 RUS_socialist_education_desc: "The State has begun new educational initiatives specifically designed to close the literacy gap between the rural and urban poor.

 RUS_chinese_military_mission_idea_desc: "Sino-Russian relations began in the 17th century when Russian settlers reached the Chinese at the Amur River, and formal treaties began after 1689. The old Russian Empire played an imperialist role in the great scramble for China, and sought to exact concessions from China as well as taking advantage of China's many extraterritorial agreements.\n\nThe collapse of the old empire following the Great War however has dramatically changed the future and scope of Russian-Chinese relations. Sure, there are still plenty of unresolved issues regarding the northern borders and China's claims to the frontiers of Xinjiang and Mongolia but nonetheless, Russia sees in China a potential ally in resisting the despicable stretch of the Kaiser in the Far East. As Chinese militaries are desperately outdated and undertrained, we should facilitate a military advisory expedition in order to train local Chinese warlord soldiers into a professional force modelled on our own army successes."

 RUS_improve_roads_in_northern_russia: "Roadworks in the Russian North"
 RUS_improve_roads_in_northern_russia_desc: "Northern Russia has historically been a place with more swamps than forests, and it so happens that the most common means of transportation in these parts is water transport.

 RUS_magnitogorsk_desc: "The deposits of the Magnetic Mountain have been known for over a century, but it was not until the 1920s that the Russian government began planning to build a factory that could centralise mining and processing in the region. The design was improved under the VES, but was not included in the Voskhod programme due to protests of the Ministry of Control. The improved design is an entire city built around a giant metallurgical combine, designed with the involvement of many specialists from all over the world over the past 10 years - from Germany to America - and finalised by the TAK.

Only in 1895, Grozny oil began to be actively exported to Europe, and factories grew one after another in the vicinity of the city. With the loss of Baku, Russia began to invest in the development of Grozny oil with redoubled force, but despite the improvement of oil production in the region over the past decades, we still have to electrify oil processing factories, introduce rotary drilling instead of impact drilling, pumping instead of bailing extraction, and install metal rigs instead of wooden ones."

To develop these deposits, it was proposed to establish the Gerkhozhan Mining and Processing Combine, which would be able to process the ore for industrial needs. To do this, we will have to build not only the combine itself, but also establish a work settlement and build a unique cargo ropeway - with a height difference of almost one and a half kilometres."
 RUS_romanshkino_oil: "Romashkino Oil Field"
 RUS_romanshkino_oil_desc: "Found in the early 1930s, the oil fields were originally called Shugurovo's - until a drilling crew discovered oil-bearing deposits near the village of Romashkino in 1934. The deposits yielded unique information, which proved that more productive oil reservoirs should be searched for in Romashkino region. Instantly attracted to the development, Vostokneft and German companies began installing oil rigs, but now only the government support can speed up the process of developing the deposits - which can be even bigger than we initially expected."
 RUS_modernisation_of_AMO: "Modernisation of $amo$"
 RUS_modernisation_of_AMO_desc: "The $amo$ is the first automobile factory in Russia, founded in 1916 under the state programme for the creation of the automobile industry, but due to the civil war, the construction of the factory was not completed until 1924. Despite further development and becoming one of the largest automobile enterprises in the country in the 1920s, the $amo$ needs to be reconstructed according to modern standards if we want to establish mass production of modern vehicles for the military."
 RUS_izhevsk_mechanical_plant: "Izhevsk Mechanical Factory"
 RUS_izhevsk_mechanical_plant_desc: "Founded in 1807, the Izhevsk Mechanical Factory is one of the major arms factories in Russia, producing not only armaments but also motorcycles and other military-related machinery. The factory was recently renamed due to its expansion in the 1920s, which happened because of the favoured treatment given to the factory for its support of the Whites during the Civil War. In later years, the factory has been requesting increased funding to expand and build new machine-building workshops, as well as upgrade metallurgical ones."
 RUS_tula_arms_factory: "Tula Arms Factory"
 RUS_tula_arms_factory_desc: "The oldest arms factory in Russia and the birthplace of the Mosin rifle, the Tula Arms Factory has a robust manufacturing base and excellent engineers who focus on developing new weapons, primarily automatic ones. The TOZ played a major role in the army's rearmament in the early 1930s, but that process showed that the Tula factory needs modernisation to maintain its glory."

 RUS_create_tankograd_desc: "The recently established Chelyabinsk factory produces not only tractors, but also tanks. The proposal to expand the factory's tank workshops and build new tank engine plants that will supply the ChTZ was met with approval from the War Ministry, but will require additional investment. If the project is finished, Chelyabinsk will become the biggest tank producer in the world - the City of Tanks."
 RUS_convert_civilian_aviation_industry: "Convert Civilian Aviation Industries"
 RUS_convert_civilian_avitation_industry_desc: "Majority of our main aviation factories are located in Moscow, and for the most part they are engaged in the production of civil aircraft for the needs of the market. But in these difficult times we cannot allow private interests to stand in the way of state ones, and due to this the War Ministry has developed a plan to transfer the production of these factories to a military mode."
 RUS_second_baku: "Ishimbay, the Second Baku"
 RUS_second_baku_desc: "The Second Baku was discovered in 1928 and is a place of renewed hopes for the oil industrialists from the Vostokneft, led by Stepan Lianozov and Pavel Gukasov - the heirs of the Russian General Oil Corporation. The oil deposits in this area require development and processing, for which the Vostokneft is asking for additional funding to build more processing plants and oil rigs. If our forecasts are right, then after the development of the Ishimbay oil fields the price of gasoline will fall fivefold."

 RUS_admiralty_dockyards_desc: "With the return of Sevastopol to Russian hands, it has become clear that the city's famous port is in dire need of repair and modernisation if Russia is to secure her dominance of the Black Sea. Many of the facilities and equipment date back to the imperial era, and are wholly inadequate, both for their obsolescence and their lack of compatibility with newer Russian standards. New dockyards must be built in parallel with a general expansion of port infrastructure."

 #Global Trade
 RUS_trade_decisions: "Global Trade Pacts"
 RUS_trade_decisions_desc: "No successful Russian industrialisation can happen without extensive trade deals with more economically developed countries. Unfortunately, the fall of France and Britain to syndicalism, as well as the Great Depression in America, has left us more dependent on Germany than ever before. This allowed the hegemon of Europe a disproportionate amount of influence on our internal affairs and severely hampered homegrown Russian industry. But no more: Russia is on her own!"

 RUS_ratk_trade: "Sino-Russian Trade"
 RUS_ratk_trade_desc: "While the Chinese suffered under the colonialists, Russia always tried to be more realistic in Chinese matters and only defended its borders. We have tried to establish trade in the Concessions for the last 15 years and consolidated all our enterprises there under the state-sponsored Russo-Asian Trading Company, but if we want to fight German and Japanese influence, we need to work directly with the Chinese government."
 RUS_avsentorg_trade: "Danubian Trade"
 RUS_avsentorg_trade_desc: "Although we have had frosty relations with the Austro-Hungarian Crown for the last 100 years, the problem was their desire to expand their empire towards our brother nations. Although this is still a problem, business knows no morals, and the Austro-Hungarian Trade Society has already united all our trade interests on their territory - now we only have to take the first step towards normalising our relations."
 RUS_rusmedtorg_trade: "Mediterranean Trade"
 RUS_rusmedtorg_trade_desc: "Our former allies lie in ruins across the Mediterranean and are struggling to heal from the wounds of revolutions in their lands. If we expand trade with them, it will help them heal faster, and at the same time help our own recovering economy - for this purpose we have already created the Russian Trade and Travel Society for Mediterranean, which will carry out the bulk of the shipping and trade, but we must try to negotiate preferential terms for the company."

It is said that when Boris Viktorovich first saw an aeroplane, he imagined it being used as a weapon, as righteous strike from the sky against the enemies of the people. With advances in nuclear physics, it seems like the final solution to the question of terror is finally in the grasp of humanity: the Star that the Angel casts into the Sea, turning a third of it into blood."
 RUS_nuclear_default_desc: "Project Fyodorov, named after Nikolay Fyodorov, the great Russian cosmicist, is Russia's attempt to finally solve the question of the atom.

 RUS_siberian_industrialisation_desc: "Siberia has always been a backwater of Russia, and the government has not had the resources or will to industrialise it in the past. 1920s saw some steps forward, particularly in terms of infrastructure and coal mining in the Kuznetsk Basin, but much remains to be done. If we are to strive for the modern standards of great nations, Siberia must be industrialised and its resources must be fully utilised - and where there were villages yesterday, there will be cities tomorrow."
 RUS_northern_route: "Build the Northern Route"
 RUS_northern_route_desc: "After the construction of the Trans-Siberian Railway, the Russian government found that the load on the railway was three times greater than expected. The modernisation project was stopped by the events of 1917 and the subsequent Civil War, so the government had no opportunity to solve the problem while dealing with more pressing matters - until now. The construction of the second, Northern, route will relieve the Trans-Siberian Railway and connect our northern cities with the country's main transport artery, which will significantly increase the connection between European and Siberian Russia."

But the railway on this section is one of the worst of the Trans-Siberian Railway - it is completely single-line.

At the same time, without government investment, the Far Eastern fishing industry has not been able to achieve much in the last decade - competition with the Americans and Japanese immediately after the civil war was doomed to failure. To increase profitability of the industry, we must invest in the development of crab, walrus, whaling and fish industries - with the purchase of the necessary equipment and ships abroad, the development of canning factories in the Far East and the organisation of courses to improve fishermens' skills."

 RUS_rudny_altay_desc: "The southwestern lowland of Altay near Semipalatinsk is known as 'Ore Altay' and is one of the most Russified regions of Central Asia. The region has recently developed due to the attraction of German capital, but after the severance of economic ties with the Kaiserreich, the government must fill its niche. The Russian population of the region allows us to continue developing local resources without lengthy training of locals or attracting workers from European Russia. The mines must be handed over to responsible people and specialists, the equipment modernised, and workers trained by modern standards."

It was proposed to create a combine for the extraction and processing of these ores, which would be able to develop not only the Tekeli deposits, but also several nearby ones - but neither the Russian nor the Alash government had the money to implement this project in the past years.

### Intro Screen ###
 RUS_country_intro_header: "Russian Democratic Federative Republic"
 RUS_country_intro_content: "Russia has suffered. The Great War saw an unstable autocracy give way to an unstable republic, before finally collapsing into the fratricidal horror of the Russian Civil War. The §PWhite Army§! would ultimately defeat the §oBolsheviks§! after seven long, blood-soaked years.\n\nThe new Republic was mutilated, having lost a third of its population and half of her industry in the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, with even more destruction caused by the Civil War. The wartime diarchy of General §PLavr Kornilov§! and Admiral §gAleksandr Kolchak§! gave way to a civilian government and the Constitution of 1922, which created the §lRussian Democratic Federative Republic§!. The §Pmilitary§! would maintain their pervasive influence, with §PKornilov§! remaining as the de facto most powerful man of the republic, but still - Russia was more free and hopeful than she had ever been.\n\nWhat followed was a decade of liberal rule by the §mConstitutional-Democrats (Kadets)§! and the §lSocialist§!-§tRevolutionaries (Esers)§!. Much was done to improve the livelihood of the common Russian, but idealism and good intentions could only carry one so far. Just as Russia was recovering, the economic shock of 1925 forced Russia to grant even more economic rights to Germany in the Vilnius Agreement, and while the economy was growing, it was unstable and unequal.\n\nThe Fengtian Conflict in 1928, a railway dispute turned into a small war in Manchuria, ended in disappointment and failure. The ultra-nationalist §nSZRS§! was making electoral gains, and the spectre of a complete collapse of order prompted the New Year's Putsch of 1929 by General §gVasily Boldyrev§!, which ended in failure, and despite good intentions, only became another blow against Russian democracy. The terrible years of the early 1930s saw economic turmoil and political violence, culminating in the rise of §nBoris Viktorovich Savinkov§! and his §nSvobodniks§! in the 1934 election.\n\nAnd for the last two years, Russian democracy has been fighting a desperate fight like the §PVolunteer Army§! in the Steppe of Kuban. Rallied around §lViktor Chernov§! and fortified in the State Council and the Supreme Court, the §SOpposition§! §cBloc§! has been fighting §nSavinkov's§! attempts at finalising his dictatorship. In the shadows, General §PKornilov§! eyes §nSavinkov§! with increasing distrust and fear. But the struggle is increasingly futile: day by day, the Hydra of §nNational Populism§! strangles Russia tighter."

 RUS_country_intro_header_1: "The Legacy of the White Army"
 RUS_country_intro_content_1: "'We are leaving for the steppe. We can only return if there is God's grace. But we need to light a torch, so that there is at least one bright point among the darkness that has engulfed Russia...'\n\nWith these words, General §gAlekseyev's§! few hundred volunteers left Novocherkassk. Led by §PLavr Kornilov§! and §gMikhail Alekseyev§!, generals who had once commanded millions, began their battle against the §oReds§! with a force scarcely able to hold a single town. Fate, or at least the 1st Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, intervened. With huge swathes of Russia's former empire carved away by the Central Powers, §oBolshevik§! power and legitimacy were weakened. The Czechoslovak Legion revolted, breathing life into Siberia's §PWhite resistance§!, which together would liberate much of Siberia.\n\nAs battlelines were drawn between Russia's §PWhite periphery§! and §oRed interior§!, both forces fought in the uneasy shadow of Germany. The §oReds§! had been driven back by the Kaiser's armies, but the §PWhites§! found new, if distasteful, opportunities. The §PWhites'§! loose leadership of §PLavr Kornilov§!, §gAleksandr Kolchak§!, and §nBoris Savinkov§! all declared their loyalty to the Entente, but this was a difficult fiction to uphold. France and Britain were collapsing, and the few troops they had on Russian soil were mutinous. No papers were signed or speeches given, but when the right promises were made, German supply trains began to roll into §PWhite stations§!.\n\nAs the §PWhites§! coalesced, the §oBolsheviks§! were instead struck by disaster. The assassination of §oVladimir Lenin§! at the hands of a §tLeft-SR§! in August 1918 cut the heart out of the §oBolshevik§! government. Meanwhile, §PWhite counter-offensives§! in 1919 succeeded in linking many of the disparate fronts, allowing political unification under §gAleksandr Kolchak§! as Supreme Ruler. Increasingly demoralised, starving, and beset by peasant revolts, the noose would tighten around the §oBolsheviks§! before finally closing at the dawn of 1921. As the last §oBolshevik§! ship steamed from Arkhangelsk, the victorious §PWhites§! were met with a final degradation - the signing of a 2nd Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. Even victorious, Russia was left mutilated and indebted. We won, and yet still we lost."

 RUS_country_intro_header_2: "On the Way to a Third Russia"
 RUS_country_intro_content_2: "Given the cruelty of Brest-Litovsk, opposition to it was fierce from the moment it was signed. Among the most vocal critics of the peace was §nBoris Savinkov§!, leader of the §n'Union for the Defence of the Motherland and Freedom'§!, or simply the §nSZRS§!. Founded as an anti-Bolshevik resistance group in 1918, the §nSZRS§! would rejoin the §lS§!§tRs§! at the Civil War's end, before breaking off as an ultra-nationalist political party in 1924. Ferociously anti-German, the §nSZRS§! or §n'Svobodniks'§! drew their support from peasants, students, and junior officers, but they remained a minor party.\n\n§nSavinkov's§! fortunes would soon change. The national catastrophes of the 1926 Vilnius Agreement and the war for the Chinese Eastern Railway in 1928 provided the perfect fuel for the §nSvobodniks§!. The §nSvobodnik Combat Squads§! took law into their own hands, attacking those with §ocommunist§! or §PGermanophile§! sympathies, driving Russia into an escalating orgy of political violence and even an attempted uprising by the peasants of Tambov. The §mgovernment§! crackdown led to even more unrest, until it culminated into a great electoral victory of the far right - the §nSZRS§! and arch-monarchist §gSOR§! - in the 1934 elections.\n\nThe §nSZRS§! flaunts their hatred for democracy. To them, what so many Russian heroes fought and died for has been squandered by traitorous §mliberals§! and §rsocialists§!, a sentiment that many veterans have come to share. The §nSvobodniks§! venerate militarism, nationalism, and violence. As the §nVozhd§! Savinkov wrote, exceptional people - knights of terror - are needed: people who are imbued by love of Russia and the indominatable will to shape Russia - and ultimately, world history. This near-messianic faith in Russia's great fate - the §nThird Russia§! - is what makes any means allowed; all morals irrelevant. The §lRussian Republic§! is already built on millions of graves; what are a few more drops of blood in the ocean?"

 RUS_country_intro_header_3: "Peace and Bread"
 RUS_country_intro_content_3: "Peace, no matter how humiliating its terms, still gave Russia much-needed opportunity to rebuild. The Constituent Assembly transitioned to an Interim Government, which in 1923 gave the newly-declared §lRussian Democratic Federal Republic§! its first president, §cAleksandr Guchkov§!. A coalition of §lS§!§tRs§! and §mKadets§! dominated the Duma and State Council, whose top priority was feeding the population through the controversial 'Razvyorstka', a highly unpopular policy of grain seizure. As the threat of famine declined, economic recovery turned instead to land reform and foreign investment. Under Minister §lIvan Mikhaylov§!, the 'New Economic Reform' achieved strong early results, but poor oversight of the land reform and the sudden collapse of the American economy in the 1925 Wall Street Crash left Russia reeling.\n\nFaced with ballooning deficits, bankruptcies, and unemployment, Russia had little choice but to turn to Mitteleuropa. The German-Russian Trade and Credit Agreement, known better as the Vilnius Agreement, was signed on April 11th, 1926n after months of negotiation. Germany granted a 500 million Mark loan to Russia, with options for further credit, in return for 'most favoured nation' trade status and vast concessions to German industry. Paired with the mass selling of national land and further grain seizures, the Vilnius Agreement allowed the §lS§!§tR§!-§mKadet§! government to save Russia's economy, but at a terrible price.\n\nFlush with German cash, Russia would stumble back to her feet. As both Minister §lMikhaylov§! and his successor §mPavel Buryshkin§! had resigned, Russia's economic policy would be taken over by §lNikolay Kondratyev§!. With the blessing of newly-elected §lS§!§tR§!

### Events ###

 russia.10010.t: "Towards Total War"
 russia.10010.d: "The initial plan has failed, and we need not waste time with half-measures. It is time we gear everything towards total war, total mobilisation, towards the total destruction of the German war machine. The war shall be long and bloody, but we shall be victorious."
 russia.10010.a: "V put!"

 russia.5.t: "Berlin Stock Market Crash"
 russia.5.d: "Since the Berlin Stock Exchange's first precipitous plunge weeks ago, businessmen and market analysts in Russia have observed the aftershocks of Black Monday in silent horror. The flood of bankruptcies, inflation, and general panic has surged across Mitteleuropa and struck Russia like a runaway train.\n\nIn an eerie repetition of events ten years ago, the value of the Ruble has plummeted in sympathy with the German Mark, wiping out fortunes overnight. Given Russia's close economic ties with Germany under the Vilnius Agreement, Russian industries and businesses are collapsing into insolvency almost in lockstep with their German counterparts. Across Russia, every new day brings with it another grim tally of lost jobs and livelihoods."
 russia.5.a: "Oh no!"

 russia.6.t: "Unemployment Spike"
 russia.6.d: "People at the highest risk of being laid off are those on the payroll of German-owned corporations, but the effect has obviously spread to more patriotic companies. It is not only a matter of employers closing down their businesses but also losing their contracts and customers. Many industrial sectors in Russia still rely on German trade, despite attempts towards self-sufficiency by the SZRS' economic reforms over the past year.\n\nAs orders dry up, the workers lose their jobs. As fewer people have money to spare, the demand for goods crumbles lower and lower."
 russia.6.a: "Depressing."

 russia.7.t: "Banking Bailouts"
 russia.7.d: "Multiple banks in Moscow and Petrograd have informed the Ministry of Finance they are rapidly running out of their cash reserves, and most of their investments, often secured by German bonds, have collapsed alongside the German financial markets. The news is gloomy - if the Russian State Bank doesn't bail out at least the largest of these banks, the domino effect could continue uncontrollably.\n\nHowever, it is impossible to shelter all the banks at risk. While many financial advisors argue that the investment ability of the banks should be our priority, such a bailout would be seen as prioritising money of investors over that of common men."
 russia.7.a: "Prioritise fiscal stability."
 russia.7.b: "Prioritise the savings of the people."

 russia.8.t: "Plight of the Farmers"
 russia.8.d: "The market fluctuations hit the countryside slower, but when they do, they hit hard. Farmers live from harvest to harvest, and right now, they will not make a profit from the next harvest. Russia, like much of Eastern Europe, has traditionally been an exporter of agricultural goods, and now local peasants and large landowners are looking at an uncertain future.\n\nStories are being told of Ukrainian peasants burning their wheat as they cannot afford coal, and such a future may soon be in store for Russians too. The situation is not helped by SZRS-supported land banks that granted easy loans for farmers, which have now backfired on the farmers who were relying on stable harvests."
 russia.8.a: "Everyone has it tough."
 russia.8.b: "Start a debt forgiveness programme."

 russia.12.t: "Addressing the Shortages"
 russia.12.d: "As Russia's economy continues to buckle and contract, the public demand for government relief has only grown louder. Hopes are high that President Savinkov, elected as he was on a populist platform, will be willing to intervene on the common people's behalf, no matter the budgetary troubles. Several plans have been prepared for an immediate injection of funds into social welfare programmes.\n\nThat said, the elephant in the room is that these funds can only come from one place on such short notice - the military budget. The Army is, unsurprisingly, mortified that their long-awaited re-armament programme is going to be reshuffled into soup kitchens. Their assertion that the Army is what is still keeping order in Russia isn't entirely incorrect either. The government can try to appease both, but party officials are warning that such a course will be ruinously expensive."
 russia.12.a: "Divert funds from the military to alleviate the shortages."
 russia.12.b: "Our military comes first, and it's our duty to support them."
 russia.12.c: "Do what we can to aid those most affected."
 russia.12.e: "Dig deep - the government needs to help out."

 russia.30.t: "The Supreme Commander-in-Chief Demands Funds!"
 russia.30.d: "General-Fieldmarshal [RUS_GetArmyChief], the Supreme Commander-in-Chief, has demanded the government increase the defence budget and initiate serious army reforms.\n\nA large number of generals signed a petition to the government that pointing out deficiencies in the current military equipment situation and highlighting the threat of the coming war as the reason why there should be no limits on military spending."
 russia.30.a: "The army is our pride!"
 russia.30.b: "We have bigger worries."
 RUS_mil_focus_tt: "§RIf we do not complete an army focus within the next year, the army will be displeased.§!"

 russia.31.t: "Generals Are Furious!"
 russia.31.d: "The promised funding for the army did not arrive, and planned military reforms still lie unfulfilled.\n\nThe government's approval among the army has suffered a major hit, and discontent is spreading among the highest echelons of command."
 russia.31.a: "Keep complaining."
 russia.31.b: "They have some points..."

 russia.32.t: "Admiral Kolchak Demands Funds!"
 russia.32.d: "The Supreme Admiral of the Navy, Aleksandr Kolchak, has been running the Russian navy as his own fiefdom for the past two decades and has often complained about a lack of funding for the navy, which he considers to be the pride of Russia.\n\nCiting heightened tensions on the Baltic Sea, he argues that additional funding is needed to expand the Russian navy."
 russia.32.a: "The navy is our pride!"
 russia.32.b: "Seriously?"
 RUS_navy_focus_tt: "§RIf we do not complete a navy focus within the next year, the army will be displeased.§!"

 russia.33.t: "Admiral Kolchak is Furious!"
 russia.33.d: "The Supreme Admiral of the Navy, Aleksandr Kolchak, has expressed his annoyance and disappointment as the government has refused to fund his naval expansion programmes.\n\nWhile Kolchak's complaints are nothing new, his word carries much respect and has fostered some anti-government sentiment in the navy high command, who see themselves as 'forgotten soldiers'."
 russia.33.a: "Keep complaining."

 russia.50.t: "The Great Patriotic War"
 russia.50.d.democratic_FRA: "The totalitarian French regime hates Russia and oppresses people for their love of God, honour, property, and civil liberties. Everybody knows that the outcome of this war decides the fate of our Motherland.\n\nCitizens in big cities attack everything of French origin or connected to communists. State officials have already launched massive propaganda directed towards youngsters to induce them to enlist in the army or join the factories.

 ### Starting Event Chain

 russia.100.t: "Two Years Ago"
 russia.100.d: "In June of 1934, President Boris Viktorovich Savinkov was elected to serve as the fifth president of the Russian Democratic Federative Republic. The election, which led to a Duma majority of the far-right coalition of the SZRS and SOR, was the consequence of two decades of disappointment and instability.\n\nThe last nail in the coffin of President Vasily Maklakov was opening negotiations with the Reichsbank over a loan, meant to fund another set of land reforms as the SZRS was promising. But it meant little, as the SZRS had an endless supply of insults to hurl towards the Kadet-SR coalition: German lackeys, softness on socialists, failing peasant living standards, and a humiliated Russia after military adventurism in the Far East.\n\nThe mood in 1934 was resigned and fearful. A month before elections, a member of the SZRS Combat Squads had shot syndicalist Vsevolod Volin for 'treason', and hundreds of left-wing activists and politicians were targeted as part of a campaign of fear while law enforcement seemed slow and inefficient at reacting. The SZRS' volunteers began guarding voting booths, especially in rural regions. Only the SOR's campaigning was left unhindered, and even supported through tactical electoral alliances.\n\nAnd in this environment of fear, many old progressives were pushed to quit out of pressure and fear over their lives. Many voters did not dare to go out, fearing violence. The voter turnout was low, and it saw the old two titans - the Kadets and SRs - almost halved in their seat counts, as SZRS became the undisputed largest party.\n\nA month later, the combined votes of the SZRS and SOR brought President Savinkov into office."
 russia.100.a: "And so it began."

 russia.101.t: "Standoff in the State Council"
 russia.101.d: "The short winter day is already ending in the Grand Kremlin Palace in Moscow, where debates in the upper house of the Duma, the State Council, have been ongoing all day. The thin majority behind the Chairman of the State Council, Viktor Chernov, had voted down the Law on Protection of the State initiated by the Dikgof government and already passed by the State Duma. Much of the legal text has already been muddled into vague rhetoric on empowering the police forces to better hunt enemies of the republic, but the Opposition Bloc held firm and refused to accept it with any amendments. Chernov had decried the law as something out of a police state and not one fit for a democratic republic.\n\nStubborn resistance by both the parliamentary opposition and the Supreme Court has again successfully opposed the SZRS. The free media, affiliated mainly with the SZRS, has begun to spew virulent hatred against Chernov and his allies. The loudest criticism came from the Chairman of the State Duma, Vasily Shulgin, whose widely circulated Duma speech denounced the Opposition Bloc as crypto-communists and sellouts to Jewish and German business interests."
 russia.101.a: "As usual."

 russia.102.t: "The Last Line"
 russia.102.d: "The two men had been discussing the situation for the best part of the evening at Chernov's home in Alekseyevsky, Moscow. Viktor Mikhaylovich, lighting the seventh cigarette of the stressful evening, seemed to be losing hope. The Okhrana raid on party offices in Petrograd had led to the arrest of Kamkov and many other northern SRs. The ranks of the opposition were dwindling day by day under immense pressure from the reactionary hydra strangling the republic. It only seemed like a matter of time until Savinkov would gain absolute power.\n\nWhile drinking with Viktor, Vladimir Rikhter, an old friend and trusted party secretary, had tried to come up with a way to impeach the president, but the opposition simply did not have the numbers. He had even suggested negotiating with the left for a general strike, even if it ended bloodily like the 1934 protests... and discreetly contacted exiled General Vasily Boldyrev, who was living in Berlin.\n\nEven in the confines of his own home, the gramophone was playing loudly to drown the discussion for any potential listeners. Chernov spoke briefly of an officer from Kornilov's staff, who had discreetly met with him and proposed a military coup - or rather, informed Chernov that if Kornilov goes through with it, he expects the full support of the opposition. The meeting had ended with no real agreement or trust on either side.\n\nVladimir Nikolayevich was thoroughly opposed to the idea, but admitted that it might be the only way the republic can be saved at this point. Even so, it wouldn't matter if all that would happen is simply exchanging one tyrant for another.\n\nNot that they had the luxury of choice."
 russia.102.a: "Perhaps there is still time."

 russia.103.t: "The Man in the Kremlin"
 russia.103.d: "The president was working late. His office was luxuriously decorated and classicist, with portraits of the earlier presidents replaced by the fathers of Narodniks. Boris Viktorovich reacted little as he was listening to Chairman-Minister Aleksandr Dikgof's explanation of the security situation. The Okhrana had uncovered a rumour of a possible conspiracy in the military, but despite Director of Security Klepikov's best efforts, nothing concrete was yet found.\n\nBoris Viktorovich lit another cigarette and briefly remembered how the two of them had set up their temporary headquarters of the SZRS in a half-collapsed farmhouse in Shenkursk during the Civil War. He thought for a moment and ordered increased surveillance of the Stavka and especially of 'that Mongolian bastard' - which Aleksandr Arkadyevich took to mean Kornilov himself.\n\nThe President understood the equation was dangerous. The longer Chernov and Nabokov slow down the consolidation of power, the more time disloyal elements in the military have to plot. And many in the army simply despise the Svobodniks as an 'unwashed mob' - expected from the aristocratic morons who do not know life outside of barracks and palaces.\n\nBut their time will come eventually. For now, the priority is to destroy and exterminate every threat on the way to absolute power."
 russia.103.a: "And fate is on our side."

 russia.104.t: "Three Shots in the Chest"
 russia.104.d: "At 16:30 yesterday, three shots from a Nagant revolver were heard that echoed across Russia. Viktor Chernov, the head of the Socialist Revolutionary Party and the Chairman of the State Council, was assassinated at the hands of a fellow party member. Nikolay Leonidov, a low-ranking SR functionary, shot Chernov in the chest three times at the stairs of the Grand Kremlin Palace, killing him instantly. The killer was wounded by the police before he could commit suicide and was quickly transported to a hospital under heavy guard.\n\nThe Opposition Bloc was thrown into disarray by the news. The next day, the Deputy Chairman, Kadet Nikolay Platonovich Vakar, took the reins, but his position was immediately under fire. He had been initially chosen as a compromise to the right wing of the Opposition Bloc, with no one expecting Vakar to actually become the Chairman. Now, he is lauded as unacceptably right-wing and conciliatory towards the SZRS by the Socialist-Revolutionaries and the Radical-Democrats, who have demanded their own man as Vakar's deputy.\n\nIt has become clear that Chernov was the lynchpin of the opposition in the State Council, and it had been his skill that had kept the opposition unflinching. Though he often faced accusations of being 'too left for his own good', Chernov was in the bedrock of the Socialist-Revolutionaries, as well as one of the leading architects of the Russian Republic as it exists today. With Chernov's corpse still not yet cold, some members of the opposition have already made public statements that indirectly accuse the SZRS, if not necessarily President Savinkov himself, of being behind the killing or at least allowing it through lax security."
 russia.104.a: "Mne naplevat!"
 RUS_chernov_threat: "Assassination of Viktor Chernov"

 russia.105.t: "Collapse of the Opposition Bloc"
 russia.105.d: "With Chernov's death, the Opposition Bloc has begun to disintegrate faster than journalists can write about it. In an extraordinary session of the SR Central Committee, the left wing was outvoted, and Vladimir Rikhter, former party secretary and Chernov's second-hand man, was elected as the new chairman of the party as a compromise candidate who managed to satisfy no one. Despite Rikhter's insistence on continuing Chernov's work, he has little trust in the left.\n\nAfter the vote, Maria Spiridonova of the Left-faction commented that the 'so-called Socialist Revolutionary Party has lost any connection with Socialism and furthermore with Revolution, having decayed to nothing but old reactionaries who lost their ideals fifteen years ago.' Afterwards, the divide between Left and Right - which Chernov had only been able to bridge with great skill - split wide open, and those loyal to Spiridonova denounced the 'parliamentary path', which had failed, and would instead move into active resistance with anyone who still has the spirit of the Socialist-Revolutionaries in their chests.\n\nSeeing the writing on the wall, more right-wing members of the Opposition Bloc are now eyeing a compromise with the SZRS. The first one to defect was Nikolay Trubetskoy from VPP, who declared the Opposition Bloc dead and called on the conservatives to instead make peace with the more moderate forces of the SZRS. In mere days, the bloc has dissolved into chaos, fear and repression. Now, little stands between Savinkov and his vision of the Third Russia."
 russia.105.a: "The dominoes fall."

 russia.106.t: "The Leonidov Investigation"
 russia.106.d: "Despite the doctor's best attempts at the Kremlin Hospital, Chernov's assailant died of catastrophic internal bleeding before he could be interrogated. Surprisingly, the investigation was quickly taken over by the Fifth Department of the General Chief of Staff of the War Ministry - that is, the military intelligence under General-Fieldmarshal Lavr Kornilov's command, citing the matter as one of 'national security'.\n\nUnfortunately, the Department's investigation thus far has uncovered little hard evidence. A Petrograd native, the 34-year-old Leonidov joined the SRs in the early 1920s, but has otherwise struggled to hold down a job and lives estranged from his wife. More ominously, investigators have uncovered that Leonidov met with a German consul only a few days prior to killing Chernov. Attempts to meet with this consul proved fruitless, as he evidently left on an unannounced visit to Riga the day after the Chairman's assassination. Though possibly giving credence to the idea of a foreign conspiracy, the investigation lacks any proof connecting Leonidov to Germany, or any possible motive for why Germany would want Chernov dead.\n\nIn any case, the opposition is becoming increasingly vocal in demanding progress for the investigation, while the general public is growing more convinced that the government had something to do with Chernov's murder."
 russia.106.a: "What is Kornilov meddling in?"

 russia.107.t: "A Socialist Conspiracy?"
 russia.107.d: "With additional investigation into Leonidov's background, the Fifth Department has come up with a more convincing theory. Nikolay Leonidov was a socialist radical, and the murder was politically motivated. To back his claims, Kornilov pointed to recently uncovered evidence of Leonidov's connection with a radical 'Maximalist' offshoot of the Socialist-Revolutionaries, who are alleged to have plotted Chernov's assassination due to the Chairman's 'treasonous' cooperation with bourgeois and reactionary parties.\n\nIn fact, if Leonidov committed his act under orders from the Left-Socialist-Revolutionaries, it would grant a justification for immediate action: mass arrests of the party leadership, banning of the party organs and eradicating the conspiracy before they can threaten the safety of the President himself. Kornilov has proposed 'preventative actions' against the conspiracy before it can strike again, and has requested the president to activate Article 17 of the Constitution, giving the War Ministry extraordinary powers to arrest any person who may be involved, with the power to crack down on any possible disorder that may follow."
 russia.107.a: "Let's not be hasty."

 russia.108.t: "... or a military conspiracy?"
 russia.108.d: "While Kornilov's theory of a socialist conspiracy does fit the typical Svobodnik narrative and would give the government another reason to crack down on their leftist opponents, the Okhrana director Flegont Klepikov has urged caution to the President. The Department of State Security Protection has been conducting their own shadow investigation, and are increasingly suspicious of Kornilov's intentions.\n\nRecent reports from the Okhrana regarding Leonidov's background have brought up several irregularities. No nameless drifter, it instead appears that Leonidov has several relatives in the headquarters of the Petrograd Military District. Moreover, the Okhrana has uncovered a series of staff and garrison re-shuffles in Petrograd and Moscow that the Army has largely neglected to mention. These could be simple coincidences or minor background work to facilitate the killing of Chernov, but some whisper that Kornilov may have greater ambitions than just helping Savinkov eliminate his rivals."
 russia.108.a: "Disturbing theory."

 russia.109.t: "Chernov's Funeral"
 russia.109.d: "As Chairman of the State Council, Viktor Chernov is entitled to a funeral with state honours, though the idea is, of course, not particularly liked by many of the SZRS. What was intended to be a rather quick and small state funeral is quickly threatening to become a great mass event, as more and more people wish to pay their respects to the fallen legend.\n\nThere is a distinct lack of government representation at the funeral. The only ministers present are Ivan Maysky and Ivan Ilyin, who proceeded to pay Chernov lukewarm respects for his long career as a statesman. But from the opposition, there are hundreds, some having come all the way from Petrograd or Samara just to pay their respects.\n\nAnd as the coffin was being carried, someone started to sing the first notes of Radin's 'Comrades, let's bravely march'. The crowd continued:\n\nComrades, let's bravely march\nOur resolve gets stronger in the struggle\nWe will fight our way\nTowards liberty\n\nAfter the funeral, the crowd of thousands gathered in the Summer Garden in front of the Petrograd Court Chambers. Maria Spiridonova held a fierce speech, demanding justice for Chernov. While the protestors were shouting 'down with Kornilov', it was obvious that their dissent also included the sitting president. The event has quickly turned into an anti-government rally led by the Socialist-Revolutionaries and a public show of force by the opposition."
 russia.109.a: "Break it up and arrest the agitators."
 russia.109.b: "It's just words."

 russia.110.t: "Knight to C-6"
 russia.110.d: "As an old gambler, Boris Viktorovich decided to play Kornilov's game. He made a public appearance and commented to the press that there may be a conspiracy afoot against the government, and that several army officers have already been arrested on suspicion of involvement in Chernov's death.\n\nSuch a public blaming of the army is nothing short of a declaration of war on Kornilov, an invitation to a duel of wills. It has, however, shocked and incensed many members of the army, both among the rank-and-file and those involved in the assassination plot. The memories of Boldyrev's 1929 Putsch are strong, and now the government has made it clear that it will oppose any threats to the Republic from the armed forces.\n\nThe past few days have seen communications between Savinkov and Kornilov break down entirely. The Supreme Commander of the Army has remained silent in the headquarters of the Moscow Military District, surrounded by forces loyal to him, and avoided any response to the accusations of the president. Not giving Kornilov any more time to plot, President Savinkov ordered him to arrive in person at a meeting of the War Ministry in the Kremlin."
 russia.110.a: "Your move, Lavr Georgiyevich."

 russia.111.t: "The Kornilov Putsch"
 russia.111.d: "Cornered, the dog was forced to act. To much surprise, Kornilov agreed to come to the Kremlin personally. After leaving the headquarters of the Military District, Kornilov slipped past his intended government escort and instead headed directly to the Kremlin. He was accompanied by a company of 'yunker' cadets from the Alekseyev and Dukhonin Military Academies as an obviously pre-planned move. Upon arriving, he ordered the Special Purpose Battalion tasked with guarding the Kremlin to 'secure' the Senate Palace and ensure the 'safety' of the President with the support of the cadets.\n\nHowever, Kornilov's hubris proved to be his downfall as much as it was Boldyrev's before him. When only a portion of the Security Battalion agreed to follow his orders, fierce fighting soon broke out within the Kremlin as Kornilov's forces tried to arrest the soldiers who refused to obey orders, claiming that they were loyal only to Savinkov.\nMuch of the Kremlin complex fell rapidly. Smashing through the gates of the Spasskaya Tower, Kornilov's troops reached the Senate Palace, where they were finally stopped by dogged loyalist resistance by the MVD troops long enough for reinforcements to arrive from the capital's garrison. It was said that Savinkov followed the fighting within the Kremlin with glee on his face, but it is more plausible that he had already left the complex by this point.\n\nKornilov himself was wounded by a grenade and taken prisoner in the Senate Palace, while the rest of the mutineers were shot on the spot. Simultaneously, the Okhrana moved to arrest the traitors within the Military District headquarters. Now the uncrowned military dictator of Russia is rotting in the Butyrskaya prison, and no official statement of the events of the night has been given. What will fall on him?"
 russia.111.a: "Only DEATH to traitors."
 russia.111.b: "Allow him a trial and a retirement."

 russia.112.t: "A Revolver with a Single Bullet"
 russia.112.d: "A newspaper was delivered to Lavr Kornilov's cell yesterday. The former Minister of War was greeted by a headline announcing not only his culpability in Chernov's killing but also his treasonous coup attempt. Along with the newspaper, a revolver with a single bullet was delivered to the cell. Despite his crimes, a hero of the Civil War still deserved a chance to keep his honour intact.\n\nAlas, two Okhrana officers who arrived at the cell a few hours later found Kornilov very much alive. According to one of the officers, Kornilov said something to the effect of 'If Savinkov wants me dead, let him do it himself'.\n\nA subsequent visit several hours ago found Kornilov dead in his cell without a visible cause, or at least none which appeared in the post-mortem reports. Per the prison doctor's statement, his death was likely a combination of 'age and stress'. The opposition and a sizeable portion of the public have taken the news of Kornilov's death in stride - justice has been served for high treason, even without a trial. The reaction among the military is decidedly more sombre. Many officers and soldiers are defiantly mourning their late commander with black armbands.\n\nMore ominously, Okhrana reports indicate that few in the military have taken the SZRS claims of Kornilov's guilt seriously, and rumours are flying that the government was complicit in framing him."
 russia.112.a: "So goes the son of Kalmykia."

 russia.113.t: "The Last Journey of Kornilov"
 russia.113.d: "Regardless of the murky details around Kornilov's coup, he was deemed to deserve a state funeral as one of the foundational giants to whom all of Russia owes a great debt. And even in death, the Fallen General can serve the propaganda purposes of the new Russia, turning the funeral into a solemn celebration of the White Cause.\n\nThe white birch coffin was escorted by soldiers of the former Kornilovites of the Volunteer Army in their black uniforms and bright red caps. They were followed by formations in their parade uniforms, many of Kornilov's brothers in arms - then the SZRS' own marching unit - and finally, thousands of veterans and admiring citizens following the procession.\n\nLavr Georgiyevich Kornilov - the Minister of War of the Russian Republic, Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Armed Forces, and General-Fieldmarshal of the Russian Army - was laid down into the bosom of the Motherland.\n\nGeneral-Fieldmarshal Anton Denikin held a speech in honour of the fallen soldier at the Novodevichy Cemetery.\n'Doom is unforgiving and merciless. It spared for many years the life of a man who looked hundreds of times into Death's own eyes. But in the end Death struck him and the soul of the army in the hours of greatest anguish. The mystical veil of eternity has dictated paths and accomplishments with an unknown will. Our beloved leader, who has led us to victory for twenty years, is dead. The name of this fighter for Russia's desecrated land is written in fiery letters in the annals. It cannot be wrested from our memories.'\n\nMany of the following eulogies from other members of high command recalled personal experiences of fighting with the stubborn old veteran. To the SZRS' embarrassment, the funeral was practically hero worship, with the military essentially ignoring the coup attempt. The opposition hardly cared for the funeral either, with many likely welcoming the death of the arch-reactionary with an open heart."
 russia.113.a: "Honour Kornilov."
 russia.113.b: "Give him a minimal amount of respect."

 russia.114.t: "Trial of the Misguided General"
 russia.114.d: "After several tense meetings between Kornilov and Savinkov, the former finally relented to admitting his guilt on condition that he, and more importantly his subordinates, be spared.\n\nPresented before the Moscow Court Chambers through a detailed series of reports and witness statements, the story that emerged is one of fundamental and catastrophic misunderstandings. Kornilov, through intelligence gathered by the army, was convinced of Chernov's role in a wide-ranging conspiracy against the government, which included members of the SZRS itself. Acting on his own initiative, Kornilov had Chernov assassinated. Fearing that Chernov's allies in the government remained at large, Kornilov believed the state was compromised and thus failed to coordinate effectively. The ensuing battle in the Kremlin was in fact a botched attempt to safeguard Savinkov against an attempt on his life.\n\nThough his actions can be perceived as high treason and even as a possible putsch, the Court found insufficient evidence to meet the high bar needed for a charge of treason. Nevertheless, Kornilov has been stripped of his post as Minister of War and pensioned off, symbolically retaining his rank solely out of respect for his past service. His accomplices have similarly been drummed out of the military, but have otherwise been unpunished due to their belief that they were serving Russia.\n\nKornilov, speaking with the press from the court steps, has expressed his remorse that he led faithful soldiers astray, but maintains his belief that Chernov was acting to imperil Russia.\n\nThe reactions to the verdict and Kornilov's statements have varied - the opposition is apoplectic that Kornilov has escaped justice despite admitting to Chernov's murder, and a large portion of the public is deeply uncomfortable that a simple miscommunication and vigilantism has led to so much bloodshed. The military, in turn, is very relieved to learn that their leader was simply wrong, but acted with noble intentions."
 russia.114.a: "And keep his dacha under watch."

 russia.115.t: "Shots Fired By Kerensky"
 russia.115.d: "Aleksandr Kerensky, former leader of the Russian Provisional Government until its overthrow began the Russian Civil War - and held by many as responsible for it - has levelled charges against the Savinkov government that it is dragging Russia on the road back to tyranny, destroying all the progress Russia has made since its victory over the Bolsheviks. The former president has levelled particular criticism on the government's decision to hand the investigation of Chernov's killing to General Kornilov, a move that Kerensky has caustically described as 'like putting a fox in charge of the hen coop'. As for Savinkov himself, Kerensky did not spare his former Minister of War either, stating that 'this serpent (Savinkov) will strangle Russia's freedom today in a manner he failed to do with Kornilov twenty years ago'.\n\nThis isn't the first time that Kerensky has commented on Russian affairs, but as the years have passed, so has the shock value of his pronouncements. Having alienated even his most fervent supporters in Russia during his brief stint at the country's helm, many in Kerensky's motherland simply see him as a washed-out relic, banking off his past achievements to earn speaking tours off credulous Westerners. Kerensky is currently living in exile in New York City, and while his most recent batch of inflammatory statements have made the rounds in American and European newspapers, they have been all but completely ignored within Russia itself."
 russia.115.a: "Nice try, old man."

 russia.120.t: "The Supreme Court"
 russia.120.d: "Though it may be true that Savinkov's confrontations with Vladimir Nabokov, the Supreme Court Chairman, have been less verbally explosive than those with the late Chernov, they proved no less frustrating for the SZRS' growing ambition. The Supreme Court of the Russian Republic is not only the highest court of appeal but also the arbiter of Russia's constitution, and its 18 judges have proven to be a constant thorn in the side of political radicalism. The Svobodniks' pride has arguably still not recovered from Nabokov's ruling on the question of the Combat Squads' legal status in 1935, which struck down Savinkov's attempt to pardon many of his footsoldiers currently languishing in prison on charges of terrorism. Chernov's passing, however, opened an avenue for finally ridding Russia of Nabokov's obstructionism. Savinkov and his cohort in the Duma have nurtured a vote of non-confidence against the Supreme Court for more than a year, but its execution was continually frustrated by a lack of support in the State Council.\n\nNow, with the State Council likewise in SZRS-SOR hands, the non-confidence vote and a paired legal reform bill passed both legislative houses without incident. The slate of the Supreme Court, Nabokov included, has been wiped clean in a wave of firings and forced retirements. The few old guards judged harmless enough to remain will be rendered powerless in a new Supreme Court that has not only grown to 24 seats, but has also been stacked with a reliable bench of SZRS-approved appointees, led by venerable Boris Vysheslavtsev, the top legal expert of the SZRS."
 russia.120.a: "And now everything is constitutional."

 russia.121.t: "Demonstrations in Petrograd"
 russia.121.d: "With the SZRS now having control over the Supreme Court, the last legal barriers to Savinkov's dictatorship are being removed - and the opposition is furious, seeing their hopes for Savinkov's fall slip away.\n\nYet another demonstration was held in Petrograd, with many of the republican left decrying Savinkov as a tyrant hell-bent on destroying Russian democracy."
 russia.121.a: "Let them demonstrate, if they must."
 russia.121.b: "Send in the military to disperse them."

 russia.122.t: "The Basic Law of the RDFR of 1922"
 russia.122.d: "Strictly speaking, only another Constituent Assembly has the privilege to alter the Russian constitution. This clause had noble intentions, and while it certainly lent the constitution an air of ageless gravitas, it also made even the most mundane of constitutional reforms extremely tedious. This would be less of an issue if Russia's constitution was well-constructed - it is not. While Russia's lawmakers made a valiant attempt in 1922, the constitution's legal base drew from twenty years of wildly different administrations, and it was assembled in a manner that would cause the least friction in the chaotic post-Civil War political arena. The final result is a vague, imprecise document, roundly mocked for only guaranteeing the right to endless debates. Past administrations have already made several efforts to 'skirt around' this issue by papering over the constitution's flaws with obfuscated legislation that covered constitutional matters without explicitly saying so.\n\nWith the Supreme Court and the parliament in the hands of the SZRS, there is no real need to pay any attention to the old constitution. In practice, the State of Security already bypasses many constitutional rights, and the rest of the relevant powers will be changed with the so-called 'Savinkov Constitution', officially '5th Amendment to the Basic Laws of the Russian Democratic Federative Republic' - ideally the last law to pass through the Duma, relegating the 1922 Constitution as dead paper."
 russia.122.a: "There's nothing they can do to stop it!"

 russia.123.t: "State of Security"
 russia.123.d: "Under the 1922 Constitution, Article 36 grants the President of the Republic power to declare a State of Security with the approval of the State Council. Savinkov's last attempt in 1934 to use the State of Security was curbed as it did not pass the State Council, and was followed by Kornilov's warning that if the constitution is ignored, the military has no other option but to act. Based on the current instability, a new State of Security has been declared, and unsurprisingly it passed in the State Council, where the opposition is broken.\n\nThe State of Security (okhrannoye polozheniye) was originally added to the constitution due to the demands of the army, who saw the need for dictatorial powers in case of a Communist uprising or similar public unrest. It was used to give post facto justification for Admiral Kolchak's wartime dictatorship, and has been used in 1929 and then again in 1932 to quell Tambov unrest, in practice having little to no restrictions. The State of Security allows executive decrees to bypass almost all constitutional guarantees concerning personal and political freedom, property, and judicial rights. The only provision for ending such a state is a vote by the State Council.\n\nImmediately after the decree, Chairman-Minister Dikgof announced the suspension of various civil rights, empowering the police and a great expansion of powers of the law enforcement to hunt 'those seeking to destabilise our Great Russia'."
 russia.123.a: "This is but a first step."

 russia.124.t: "Replacing Kornilov"
 russia.124.d: "Having commanded the Russian Army since the final days of the Great War, Lavr Kornilov's absence has left a vacancy that no small amount of effort can hope to fill. The Army's mood is fractious, and we must tread carefully with the choice of successor. The Army is largely divided between two men, Anton Denikin and Pyotr Wrangel, both of whom were among Kornilov's closest associates. Sergey Markov was briefly considered, but he quickly issued a statement declaring both a lack of interest in the position and a conflict of interest due to his close friendship with both other candidates. Unfortunately, such a friendship can't be said to exist between Denikin and Wrangel.\n\nDenikin, a son of peasants, earned his general's epaulettes through the unimpeachable courage and tenacity of an elite infantryman and artillery officer. Disdainful of politics, Denikin has nevertheless come to accept his place as the Army's highest-ranking republican, though he has reportedly still not become comfortable enough with 'politicians' to shake Savinkov's hand.\n\nWrangel, meanwhile, hails from an ancient family of Baltic-German nobility, and though his merits are beyond question, he is far more comfortable with intrigue and court politics than the gruff Denikin. Wrangel's past service was as a cavalry officer in the famously monarchistic Guards Corps, but as a general, he has instead dedicated himself to elevating the capabilities of Russia's humble conscripts, with much more academic approach towards military affairs."
 russia.124.a: "Pyotr Wrangel will serve the country well."
 russia.124.b: "Anton Denikin is the new chief."

 russia.125.t: "The Last Free Speech"
 russia.125.d: "Even the conservatives who hoped to moderate the plans of the SZRS have been woken up by the extent of the proposed legal changes, which would in practice turn Russia into a one-party state. In a Duma debate on proposed changes to the Code of Individual Rights, the situation boiled over after the Svobodniks failed to provide persuasive arguments for such wide-spanning restrictions on liberty, and the show was stolen by the new leader of the SR Party, Vladimir Rikhter.\n\nLargely publicised only in foreign press, Rikhter's speech would build up a legendary aura in the coming years.\n\n- In this fated hour, we Socialist-Revolutionaries solemnly pledge ourselves to the principles of humanity, liberty and justice. Here Boris Viktorovich dismantles our great achievement of the February Revolution - the one time in history where we, Russians, have been the ones showing the light, the ones guiding the world towards a better future. Millions of brave Russian souls were given to defend this freedom. Did the president himself not always speak for the honour of these sacrifices, of staying true to the reasons for which we shed so much blood? No! No law gives you power to destroy ideas that are eternal and indestructible. We remain true to the path that we embarked on in 1917, even if Boris Viktorovich - a faithless terrorist and the new Lenin - will not. Hail Tsar Boris, oppressor of the Russian people! Gentlemen, I wish you strength in the struggle that is to come. We did not despair in 1917; we should not give in to despair now, for tyrants never last. I call applause to Free Russia, eternal and indestructible!\n\nRight after, the opposition staged a walk-out from the Grand Kremlin Palace in protest, painfully aware that it was all they could do. Demonstrations have begun assembling outside the Duma, demanding the rights of the people to be respected, but it is only stubborn rage against the inevitable."
 russia.125.a: "Good riddance."

 russia.126.t: "The Savinkov Constitution"
 russia.126.d: "Despite its moniker, the Savinkov Constitution, officially the '5th Amendment to the Basic Laws of the RDFR', is a massive package of legislation intended to - in tandem with the State of Security - create a new quasi-constitutional state for Russia. Many of the written articles have been hollowed out, leaving the document sufficiently vague that actual ruling is left to the arbitrary interpretation of officials and judges. The executive branch has been greatly strengthened, especially in wartime - a move that surprisingly received the support of the military, still wary of the unrest of 1917 and 1928. Almost all the protections of federalism have been removed, and likewise property regulations have made it possible for the state to simply nationalise any property connected to 'anti-state activity'.\n\nHowever, most of the media attention has been given to amendments characterised by President Savinkov as the 'foundation stones for national renewal'. The doctrine of National Narodism has been enshrined as 'the guiding force' underpinning Russian governance, second only to God. The 'obshchina', Russia's traditional common-land village, has been declared the building block of Russian society, be it for peasants, workers, or parishes. The new Code of Individual Rights has replaced universal citizen rights with the concept of 'collective freedom of all Russian people', where freedom of the individual is inherently linked to the freedom of the nation as a whole, and freedom that contradicts with the freedom of the nation is thus punishable.\n\nThe news of the ratification was met with thunderous approval from the SZRS delegates in the Duma, and their celebrations were soon joined by public parades organised by party cadres across Russia. Reactions among the opposition are decidedly more grim, and even Savinkov's allies in the SOR can only look on and ponder how far the President's ambitions truly go."
 russia.126.a: "Russia fara da se!"

 russia.127.t: "Labour Union Operation"
 russia.127.d: "A mass operation against Russian labour union activists, led by MVD troops and assisted by volunteer Svobodnik and local police officers, has begun across multiple Russian cities. Under the Law on Protection of the State, the authorities have extraordinary powers to investigate, arrest, and punish communists and potential communist accomplices.\n\nThe largest-scale operation was against the All-Russian Central Assembly of Trade Unions present in Petrograd, many of whom have now fled into hiding. While the VTsSPS's central organs have already been banned, it has been well known by the law enforcement that it is merely led from the underground - something that will end today. To justify mass persecution, a virulent press campaign has been launched as 'The one last charge against Bolshevism'.\n\nThe worst clash happened at the Putilov Factory, which resulted in the hospitalisation of at least twenty people, after the workers there tried to resist the arrests. Dozens have been shot and hundreds hospitalised or arrested as the labour leaders have been hunted. There have been solidarity protests and strikes across Russia, but it is clear that under such persecution, legal labour unions are largely being exterminated.\n\nAt this point, many people are simply trying to get by, as long as the violence does not touch them. Given how many members of the VTsSPS are former Reds, their imprisonment now is being argued by the SZRS press as long-delayed justice for the crimes of the Civil War, which they had escaped through the leniency of the past Kadet-SR governments."
 russia.127.a: "Send Lenin my regards."

 russia.128.t: "Extermination of the Radical-Democratic Party"
 russia.128.d: "With a friendly Supreme Court, a presidential decree to ban the RDP has finally succeeded. Based on the Law on Protection of the State, arrest warrants have been issued for most of the RDP's leadership, suspected of 'communistic' activities.\n\nThe spark for the crackdown was a major protest organised by the RDP, who mobilised many against Savinkov's recent political arrests. Marching along Tverskaya Street, the demonstration ultimately reached the military cordon stationed near Red Square. After several attempts by the presiding junior officer to disperse the crowd, a group of protestors ignored his warnings and marched forward to try to break through the line of soldiers. A scuffle ensued, followed by a gunshot of uncertain origin. The inexperienced officer failed to control his troops, who soon began firing into the crowd under the impression they were under attack. The RDP's chief organiser, Daniil Sulimov, rushed forward to try to stop the shooting, but was lightly wounded and dragged away from the scene by his comrades. The soldiers' fire killed 32 people, with more than 200 injured.\n\nSoon thereafter, the organisers were arrested, and the RDP's party offices were raided all across the country. Seized membership lists were used to track down members and force them to confess to either communist anti-state activities or spying. Most of the leadership were given harsh sentences, and the rest have either gone underground or fled the country. One of the SZRS' goals, a total ban on Radical-Democratic Party as a mere Trojan horse for communism, has been finally realised."
 russia.128.a: "Finishing the Civil War, slash by slash."

 russia.129.t: "The End of the Compromise"
 russia.129.d: "Treason! Or so shouts the front page of every newspaper in Russia. A slew of high-ranking members of the Assembly for Russian Unification, better known simply as the 'SOR', have been implicated in a German-backed conspiracy to stymie Russia's independence. The allegations, provided by a variety of 'unnamed but trustworthy' sources, detail connections dating back, in some cases, to nearly a decade and include everything from preferential business contracts with German firms to outright informing on SZRS party members during earlier periods of persecution.\n\nVasily Shulgin, the SOR's leader, has vociferously denied the claims made against his compatriots, but his words have been a drop in the ocean compared to the flood of condemnation that has struck his party. The fact that many of the headlines have been accompanied by photographs of documents detailing the alleged conspiracy has confirmed the story's veracity for much of the Russian public. President Savinkov has largely refrained from commenting on the developing story, but he has urged members of the SOR to join the SZRS instead, as it has become clear that the SOR's leadership does not have Russia's best interests at heart. With mass defections of SOR delegates in the Duma, it seems the party's days are numbered."
 russia.129.a: "It was inevitable."

 russia.130.t: "Then They Came For..."
 russia.130.d: "After the Supreme Court was taken over by Boris Vysheslavtsev and other more legally competent judges appointed by President Savinkov, the way was paved for the beginning of mass trials against the enemies of the people.\n\nFormer president during the Tambov Uprising, Vadim Rudnev, to be shot for a grave abuse of authority; weak supervision of subordinates; grave slowness, negligence, and non-compliance with the established procedure for the performance in the public position.\n\nFormer president Vasily Maklakov, to be imprisoned for a grave abuse of authority.\n\nFormer chairman of the Constituent Assembly, Pavel Milyukov, to be shot for treason and multiple crimes against public law.\n\nVladimir Rikhter, chairman of the SRs, imprisoned for various crimes against the government.\n\nThe list went on and on.\n\nThe chairman of the RDP, Vladimir Levitsky, was imprisoned.\n\nAnother notable party member, Aleksey Rykov, was shot, like many other former Bolsheviks who had 'feigned loyalty' to the nation.\n\nMaria Spiridonova and many other former SR terrorists have been arrested, but there remains some doubt over their ultimate fate, as they have undoubtedly contributed much to the Russian Republic during our struggles with Tsarism."
 russia.130.a: "The enemies of the people shall rule no more."

 russia.131.t: "Fate of the Socialist-Revolutionary Party"
 russia.131.d: "How the tables have turned. The SZRS, originally a small splinter of those Socialist-Revolutionaries who put the Russian people first and foremost and washed their hands of politicking, is once again the sole inheritor of the Narodniks. The leadership of the old SRs has been imprisoned or cast to the winds. Much of the SR field organisations have been integrated into the SZRS' party machinery, and their rank and file have been encouraged to join the SZRS if they wish to continue their political careers.\n\nHowever, a question remains - what to do with the leadership? Savinkov and many of his inner circle are personally sympathetic to the old SRs, whom they consider as wayward comrades. It has been suggested that Maria Spiridonova and a number of other veterans of the SRs' struggles would be exiled from Russia instead of being imprisoned like common people's traitors. Perhaps milder treatment would also encourage more of the Left-SRs to join SZRS' ranks."
 russia.131.a: "Exile the leadership."
 russia.131.b: "A traitor is a traitor."

 russia.133.t: "Wrangel Pleased"
 russia.133.d: "Flashing camera bulbs have captured a historic moment in the Russian Army's history, as President Savinkov and General-Fieldmarshal Wrangel co-signed a comprehensive reform package aimed at revitalising Russia's capacity to wage war. Though the exact details have been withheld as a concession to secrecy, Savinkov and Wrangel have both discussed their intent to prepare the brave Russian everyman, the frontovik and factory worker alike, for tomorrow's war. While some within the Army question the wisdom of such a glacial approach to warmaking, the thought of stout defences and improved conditions has proven very popular with the Russian public.\n\nIn a closed meeting with the Stavka, General-Fieldmarshal Denikin is reported to have delivered a scathing critique of Savinkov's chosen military policy directly to the President's face. Denikin, channelling the same professionalism and renowned bluntness that he had once used with Kerensky, did not mince his words when it came time to decry the 'idiocy' and 'cowardice' that Savinkov was condemning the Army to by following Wrangel's 'archaic' lead."
 russia.133.a: "Excellent."

 russia.134.t: "Denikin Pleased"
 russia.134.d: "A series of military manoeuvres organised by General-Fieldmarshal Denikin in collaboration with President Savinkov have proven to be a smash hit among both the troops and general public. Several mock battles were held near Smolensk along Russia's western border, with Denikin's favoured 4th 'Iron Division' smashing aside the prepared defences of 'An Unstated Enemy with Regionalist Collaborators'. The President and a select press gallery were reportedly deeply impressed by the precision and impact of the Army's artillery, as well as the courage of the elite shock troops following so close behind the shellfire. In an unprecedented gesture, Denikin even consented to a photograph showing him firmly shaking Savinkov's hand.\n\nSources close to the Kremlin report that the Black Baron was spotted storming out of a meeting with Savinkov. Rumours have begun to swirl that Savinkov was seduced by the prospect of grand, decisive offensives, ignoring that such rashness could only lead to disaster given Russia's present state. It remains to be seen if Wrangel's pride will allow him to admit that he was outfoxed by the infamously straightforward Denikin. In any case, the Army has already been consumed by the sorts of gossip and rumour-mongering that have all the hallmarks of Pavel Shatilov, Wrangel's chief-of-staff and favoured spymaster."
 russia.134.a: "Excellent."

 russia.135.t: "Cracks in the SZRS Military"
 russia.135.d: "It is known that many in the general corps have disdain for the President, but even the SZRS-aligned military men are not of one mind. With the recent military reforms, SZRS Instructor-Volunteers and Assault Battalions have been receiving disproportionate funding and personnel, demanded by army ideologues like Viktor Larionov, Vladimir Manstein, and Yury Shirinsky-Shikhmatov. Their programme is meant to permeate the entire Russian army with a new fervour and a philosophy of heroism, and do away with the aristocratic remnants of Russian military culture.\n\nLarionov ended in a harsh conflict with General Karl Gopper, the Inspector of the Army. A number of infantry school staff sent Gopper - who is in charge of ensuring that regulations are followed - a note, demanding an end to attempts to 'ideologise' higher military education as 'a frivolous waste of time and resources, directly conflicting with the 1929 Field Service Regulations'. Gopper, despite his personal yet waning loyalty to Savinkov, brought the matter up with the President himself, giving careful support to the demands. Gopper even threatened to side with [RUS_GetArmyChief] and made it clear how much he despises 'playing politics' in the army.\n\nNaturally, the very next day, Larionov came to meet the Vozhd, praising the successes of the units which have been informed by ideological teachings. Keenly aware of Gopper's opposition, he even suggested making Manstein instead the Inspector of the Army, to ensure the 'patriotic' control of the army, a snub no doubt directed at Gopper's nationality."
 russia.135.a: "Gopper has served me well!"
 russia.135.b: "Gopper is an old man with outdated ideas."

 russia.136.t: "Gopper's Resignation"
 russia.136.d: "Karl Ivanovich Gopper, Hero of the Northern Volunteer Army, gave the President his resignation from the Russian Army. The old general offered no explanations at first, but Boris Viktorovich appealed to their shared past. Did they truly march through the bitter cold together without as much as an explanation? Initially, Gopper seemed simply as if he had given up after a long mental struggle, but with prying, Savinkov started to realise the full picture.\n\nYes, Gopper had been part of the original SZRS, but he had always been a military man first and foremost. After the Rybinsk Uprising and creation of the Northern Volunteer Army, history had seized Gopper into Savinkov's great story, as his military deputy and celebrated White general. But Gopper had always kept his distance from the SZRS. Yes, he was a member, but he rarely spoke of matters outside his field of the military or his scouting organisation, and after Chernov's assassination, he became ever more aloof. His role was somewhat of a moderating force, always offering cautious advice to the Vozhd, whom he still considered a friend.\n\nBut, Gopper explained, after the latest events, he simply cannot in good conscience continue serving. He is also old and tired, and deeply disappointed in what the regime has become. Thus, the only honourable choice is resignation. It seems that not every man has the indomitable will of a terrorist."
 russia.136.a: "I suppose he deserves that."
 RUS_gopper_retired: "Karl Gopper has retired."

 russia.203.t: "The Orthodox Church"
 russia.203.d: "The Russian Orthodox Church, like much of Russia, has endured the 20th century more than it has lived it. Caught in a seemingly endless web of debates regarding episcopal, monastic, and parish reforms, the Church has navigated the treacherous waters of war and revolution, but never smoothly. Even the triumphant revival of the Moscow Patriarchate in 1917 was not spared from controversy. Patriarch Tikhon earned a deserved reputation as an able leader in the tragedy of the Civil War, but his allegedly liberal attitudes prompted a reaction that bore fruit in the subsequent election of Patriarch Antony (Khrapovitsky) after Tikhon's passing in 1925. Patriarch Antony, a firebrand of the episcopal faction, wasted no time in riling up confrontation, first by attempting to make all parishes commemorate the Romanov dynasty in their prayers rather than the more neutral 'civil authorities', and later by adamantly refusing to cooperate with any land reform.\n\nThe souring of Church-State relations has seen opposition to Antony coalesce around Metropolitan Sergy of Nizhny Novgorod, a moderate with a history of social welfare activism, and who has likewise drawn moderate clerics and laity to his banner. Though this schism within the Church is rarely discussed openly, its intensity has grown stronger as Antony's declining health makes a new patriarchal election likely in the near future. With this in mind, many members of the Sergian faction have approached the SZRS for support, both out of practical concern for mending relations with the government, but in many cases out of genuine belief in the Svobodniks' mission. The bishops themselves are unlikely to change their dislike of Savinkov, but with additional help, the SZRS could expand its influence among parishes with little difficulty. This, in turn, would ensure that Sergian priests are nominated by the laity, and open an avenue through which to influence the broader Church. The Sergians seem set on supporting the SZRS one way or another, but how much Savinkov is willing to sacrifice to return the favour remains to be seen."

 russia.204.t: "Death of the Patriarch"
 russia.204.d.savinkov: "Thousands gathered to follow Patriarch Antony's funeral service in Moscow. He had been popular among the faithful, uncompromising in faith and wise beyond his years. Here was a man who had always prayed for the health of the Romanovs to this day. These stances had made him many enemies over the years, and it must be said his death was welcomed with relief in the Kremlin, as the late Patriarch had been a fervent opponent of Savinkov.\n\nThe Local Council of the Church has gathered in Moscow to elect followers to the patriarchal throne. While officially it is purely a matter for the faithful to choose the new Patriarch of All Rus', the SZRS has been lobbying to support the faction of Metropolitan Sergy (Stragorodsky) of Nizhny Novgorod. Sergy and his supporters have been amicable to Savinkov's policies and willing to drop the overt monarchism that was so dear to the late Patriarch.\n\nSergy is opposed by the Metropolitan of Petrograd, Iosif (Petrovykh), who remains suspicious of the state's attempts to control the Church. He is more moderate and conciliatory than Antony was, and many of his followers have even been censored or imprisoned for opposing Savinkov.\n\nPredictably, the council caved in to pressure from the authorities and elected Metropolitan Sergy as the new Patriarch of All Rus'. In his first sermon, Sergy declared the importance of cooperation between the Church and the Authorities, and that overt political monarchism is not fitting for a priest."

He had been popular among the faithful, uncompromising in faith and wise beyond his years. Here was a man who had always prayed for the health of the Romanovs to this day. These stances had made him many enemies over the years, both with Savinkov and the socialists, and it must be said his death was welcomed with relief in the Kremlin.\n\nThe Local Council of the Church has gathered in Moscow to elect followers to the patriarchal throne. While officially it is purely a matter for the faithful to choose the new Patriarch of All Rus', the government has been lobbying to support the faction of Metropolitan Yevlogy (Georgiyevsky) of Moscow. While hardly friendly to socialism, he has always been a friend to the poor and the downtrodden, and often spoke of social equality. Ironically, in many ways, he is similar to the former main contender Metropolitan Sergy (Stragorodsky) of Nizhny Novgorod, who was likewise moderate, supportive of the state, and interested in social issues - but he is essentially a non-choice because of his earlier cooperation with the Savinkovite regime.\n\nInstead, the main opposition comes from the Metropolitan of Petrograd, Iosif (Petrovykh), who remains suspicious of the state's attempts to control the Church. He is more moderate and conciliatory than Antony was, but still extremely hostile to socialist authorities.\n\nPredictably, the council caved in to pressure from the authorities and elected Metropolitan Yevlogy as the new Patriarch of All Rus'. In his first sermon, Yevlogy declared the importance of cooperation between the Church, the Authorities, and the common people."

These stances had made him many enemies over the years among the republicans.\n\nThe Local Council of the Church has gathered in Moscow to elect followers to the patriarchal throne. The main contenders for the throne of Patriarch of All Rus' are Metropolitan Yevlogy (Georgiyevsky) of Moscow and Metropolitan Iosif (Petrovykh) of Petrograd. The former main contender Metropolitan Sergy (Stragorodsky) of Nizhny Novgorod has all but retreated from the contest, as his support for Savinkov is deemed too incriminating in post-Svobodnik Russia.\n\nMetropolitan Yevlogy has always been a friend to the poor and the downtrodden, and spoke of social equality and the importance of cooperation with the temporal authorities. He is widely seen as the more liberal candidate compared to Metropolitan Iosif. Iosif commands great loyalty from his followers and remains suspicious of the state's attempts to control the Church. He has also disagreed with Yevlogy's demand for bishops to restrain themselves from open monarchism. Both candidates seem to be rather evenly tied."

 russia.229.t: "The Ustryalovite Faction"
 russia.229.d: "It has taken a long time for Eurasianist ideas to flow from universities to common political discourse, but perhaps no one has done more footwork as the 'footsoldier of Eurasia' than Nikolay Vasilyevich Ustryalov. He is the editor of the magazine 'New Epoch' and the branch secretary of Kaluga SZRS. Ustryalov's fiery style and bold declarations have attracted many more adherents than the academic work of the fathers of the movement, such as Savitsky, Trubetskoy, and Antipov.\n\nThe younger generation of Svobodniks have been especially interested in the ideas pushed by 'New Epoch', fascinated with the greater civilisational narrative behind Eurasianism as a greater framework for National Narodism. Completely and utterly cutting ties with the degenerate West, both German and Latin, fits the overall narrative of the Vozhd well, even if he has never expressed support for Eurasianism officially.\n\nBut Ustryalov has also developed some stranger arguments. In his recent article, 'On the Development of Totalistic Communism', he argues that the so-called 'Totalist Manifesto' has a good argument, just like the Chekist reign of terror by the Bolsheviks did. While Ustryalov disagrees with the materialistic nihilism of the socialists, he does argue that 'National Totalism' or totalitarian nationalism is the correct direction for the Third Russia.\n\nUstryalov's ideas are particularly widespread among the bright university-educated generation of SZRS, those who will become future bureaucrats and administrators. Naturally, they are also drawn to ideas of expanding state control over national matters, and will likely put many of these ideas into practice eventually."

 russia.229.b: "Limit this kind of talk."
 russia.229.c: "Socialism? Shoot this man."

 russia.230.t: "The Quantification Problem of the VES"
 russia.230.d: "After the initial years of success, the management ability of the Supreme Economic Council (VES) has declined. Most of the state-controlled industries have reported stalled growth, and some have failed their goals almost entirely. Boris Nikolayevich Moiseyenko, the Control Minister tasked with the supervision of government bodies - and a spineless bootlicker for the Vozhd - has brought up numerous complaints, claiming that the VES is wasting resources and consistently failing to produce results.\n\nIn their defence, Minister of Industry and Trade Aleksandr Voznesensky and the Chairman of the Information Committee of the VES, Leonid Kantorovich, have requested more personnel for the lower levels of state companies' bureaucracy. They point out constant underfunding of the VES as the reason why they have been unable to gather enough correct information. Sectors with an extensive pre-existing bureaucracy, such as the military industry, have seen high growth, but the only problematic sectors are those that have been nationalised only recently."
 russia.230.a: "Expand the bureaucracy to serve the needs of a growing bureaucracy."
 russia.230.b: "Isn't it the planner's job to have the right numbers?"

 russia.231.t: "The National Union of Solidarists"
 russia.231.d: "The National Union of Solidarists is not a political party, but a socio-ideological movement built around Georgy Konstantinovich Gins, Mikhail Aleksandrovich Georgiyevsky, and Viktor Mikhaylovich Baydalakov. Founded in the 1920s, they sought to lobby for solidarist third-way economic policies and came to support the SZRS for its land reform efforts and opposition to capitalism.\n\nThe NSS has always had the reputation of being 'bleeding heart idealists' to the battle-hardened Svobodniks. Still, the organisation has remained legal due to its close cooperation with the regime, and many of its members are also members of the SZRS. Jokingly, it has been called the social democrats of the SZRS, a title its members vehemently oppose due to its connection with socialism. Many Solidarists have been useful to the regime, especially in the field of labour relations, organising Artels and creating the pro-SZRS labour movement."
 russia.231.a: "Encourage their work among the toilers."
 russia.231.b: "Hinder their efforts."

 russia.232.t: "The Christian Labour Movement"
 russia.232.d: "The Svobodniks have never been particularly popular among industrial workers, and there their policies have been the most heavy-handed. With the abolition of unions, mandatory Labour Artels became a system of state control over labour, tying the workers' livelihoods to their political loyalty. With socialists away from the political scene, in some areas new 'labour unions' have been formed - but they are Christian, Solidarist labour unions, working under the banner of the NSS, the National Union of Solidarists.\n\nThis has been much to the annoyance of the bureaucrats of the VES and the industrial managers. While these unions do preach for class collaborationism, they have nonetheless pointed out corruption and abuse within the system and accuse the incompetent managers of sabotaging the Russian national economy. In the courts, these cases are confusing, and the workers, backed by NSS lawyers, have made gains. While they do seem to be a fitting tool to build loyalty among the workers, this 'pseudo-communist agitation' from the NSS has drawn much ire - and many have demanded these actions be stopped from sabotaging the economy."
 russia.232.a: "Central planning does not work if workers make demands."
 russia.232.b: "Did we not seek freedom from both capitalism and socialism?"

 russia.233.t: "The Army Commissars"
 russia.233.d: "The institution of military commissars has a controversial legacy in Russia. Commissars, alongside 'revolutionary' or 'assault' battalions, were one of the few attempts under the Provisional Government in 1917 to maintain discipline and a fighting spirit in the army. Indeed, a sizeable portion of the SZRS elite can boast credentials as former front commissars, including Maksimilian Filonenko, Karol Vendzyagolsky, and Boris Savinkov himself. Nevertheless, the post of army commissar disappeared in the White Armies, though its connotations with the Bolsheviks lingered. It is no surprise, then, that the rebirth of the commissars has been led by a euphemism.\n\nThe strong presence of the SZRS in the ranks of the lower officers and enlisted men is inextricably linked to the informal position of so-called 'Instructor-Volunteers'. Elected by their peers, the Instructor-Volunteers were initially suppressed by army command as unacceptable politicisation, but have since seen a resurgence with the rapprochement between the army and SZRS. Infamously conservative as it is, the Stavka has come to begrudgingly accept the new commissars under the condition that they largely restrict themselves to the lower ranks and their duties do not extend further than maintaining the spirit of the corps and organising enlistment drives.\n\nThese limitations, however, have not been taken well by many within the SZRS itself. Karol Vendzyagolsky, who has himself acted as the de facto party commissar for years, remains insistent that the position of Instructor-Volunteers be not only formalised, but superseded by an army-wide system of commissars. These 'Deputies for Ideological Matters' would undoubtedly face opposition from the Stavka, but Vendzyagolsky insists that the benefits to the military's fighting spirit and political indoctrination, to say nothing of party supervision, vastly outweigh the risks."
 russia.233.a: "Keep army command happy."
 russia.233.b: "The commissars will have a great deal of latitude."

 russia.234.t: "The Vozhd's Image"
 russia.234.d: "Boris Viktorovich Savinkov has never been an engaging public speaker. He can be intensely charismatic in a private conversation or in writing, but in front of an audience, he is boring, unclear, uninspiring, and speaks with a strong accent mixed with Polish, a remainder of his years of growing up in Warsaw. Because of this, Savinkov rarely speaks in public, and when he does, they are often very brief or purely radio speeches. To make up for it, the SZRS wields a roster of great orators, such as Karol Vendzyagolsky and Aleksandr Antonov.\n\nBut Savinkov is also intensely vain and both loves admiration and understands the importance of having a cult of personality. One of his first acts as president was to stack state media with the SZRS' media specialists and flood the public with slogans, books, pamphlets, and photos glorifying the Vozhd - his war-time trials, his great patriotism, and his promised great future for all Russian people.\n\nThe Vozhd is portrayed as a revolutionary genius; a man from humble beginnings who has, through willpower and brilliance, driven Russia into glory. Many less successful parts of his past are skimmed over. To the public, it is almost as if he was one of the main figures behind the February Revolution, and if only Kerensky had listened to him, perhaps Russia would have dodged the coming bloodshed. He was the only sane man of the Provisional Government, the rallying cry of the White movement - he is practically the Dostoyevskian tragic protagonist of 20th-century Russia.\n\nSavinkov is everything: a bohemian, a counter-culture genius to the intelligentsia, a patriotic visionary, a veteran to the army, and a wise father who cares for the common Russian people and the peasantry."
 russia.234.a: "The Vozhd is the stern father of the people."
 russia.234.b: "The Vozhd is a visionary genius of this epoch."
 russia.234.c: "The Vozhd is the modern conquering emperor!"

 russia.235.t: "The White Youth"
 russia.235.d: "The White Youth, Belaya Molodezh, began as a small patriotic education organisation in Petrograd in 1932 by former general and local SZRS politician Viktor Aleksandrovich Larionov. Initially, it was outcompeted by Ivan Solonevich's Stabs-Captains, but ever since Solonevich's movement was banned, Larionov's 'Belmoletses' have grown greatly, and branches have also been formed in Pskov, Novgorod, Moscow, and Kursk. Larionov, who has since been appointed as the Gradocommissar (city equivalent of Governor) of Petrograd by the Vozhd in 1935, has been lobbying for the expansion of his movement into an official national role within the SZRS.\n\nThe Belmoletses train a new generation of Russian knights of terror. As their pamphlets explain, the new Russian warrior does not only fight with sword and fire, but he fights with an idea - incorruptible and undying. This pure idea of Russia is what gives soldiers hardiness, discipline, and revolutionary will to go to no ends in defence of his motherland. Question and reason are enemies of the pure idea, and the Belmoletses are trained to be with no ambiguity, without vagueness. In practice, most of the education consists of shooting, boxing, sports, and military education, designed to train perfect soldiers."
 russia.235.a: "Belmoletses chapters shall be founded in all cities."
 russia.235.b: "They are fine as Larionov's own initiative."

 russia.236.t: "The Russian State"
 russia.236.d: "Russia stands on the cusp of a profound transformation. In the time since Chernov's 'unfortunate' passing and the collapse of the opposition, great strides have been made under President Savinkov's leadership. The constitution now reflects the people's will. Orthodoxy and Russia's many faiths have been enshrined in law. The military answers to a new leader. Russia's workers and peasants have been saved from the predatory ideal of syndicalist trade unions. With every new reform, the SZRS has implanted itself deeper as Russia's natural ruling party, while the opposition has slunk further into obscurity - capable only of delaying the nation's rebirth as a great power. The time has come to formalise this changing of the guard.\n\nFrom the air, Moscow seems to shimmer like a mirage; so great is the number of flying flags. Russian tricolours flutter beside green banners and the stark black of the sword-and-thorns. A national holiday has been declared, so the streets are filled with an appropriate number of revellers. On Red Square, the tumult of thousands dies down as Boris Savinkov emerges to take his place atop a monolithic podium. Savinkov, peaked cap in the crook of his arm, wastes no time in reiterating the SZRS' litany of victories. As Russia's new flag is unfurled behind him, Savinkov declares the end of the feeble Russian Republic and that the new Russian State will succeed where the old democracy had failed. The assembled ranks of Svobodniks roar their approval, followed a moment later by the crowd. One word echoes across Red Square, across Moscow, across all of Russia - Vozhd."
 russia.236.a: "Da zdravstvuyet Rodina!"

 russia.238.t: "Rise of the Svobodniks"
 russia.238.d: "Though the term has been used as a blanket (and originally derogatory) label for any supporter of the SZRS, the true 'Svobodnik' has always been a cut above the average party member. The term, loosely translated as 'Freemen', first came about during Savinkov's 1918 uprising against the Bolsheviks in Central Russia, with 'Svobodnik' referring to the partisans of the SZRS directly under Savinkov's command. With the Civil War's end and the original SZRS' dissolution, the Svobodniks would re-emerge in 1924 as the paramilitary wing of the SZRS political party. The Svobodniks would lead a tumultuous existence for the following decade, brawling with socialists and liberals in the streets, while their most fanatical members joined the outright illegal Combat Squad terror cells. Even amidst the bloodshed, however, the Svobodniks also ran soup kitchens for the poor and provided free labour for struggling peasants, which did much to engender goodwill for a band of men who would otherwise just be considered thugs.\n\nThe SZRS' rise to the halls of government has, however, left the Svobodniks searching for a new purpose. Boasting more members than ever, it would be silly to leave them guarding party meetings. Lesser paramilitaries, such as the SOR's Russian Legion of Archangel Michael, have already been merged with the Svobodniks, which has made the organisation essentially a sole private army for the party. Proposals within the party have thus coalesced around two plans. The first aims to unite several branches of the MVD's police forces under the Svobodniks, creating a federal national guard that would maintain domestic order and good governance. The other plan would instead incorporate the Svobodniks into the military under the direct command of commissars, creating an armed force capable of acting both as a military police and an ideological backstop. In either case, the Svobodniks will blossom into a pillar of party power."
 russia.238.a: "Let them focus on keeping the people 'happy'."
 russia.238.b: "We need them to monitor our soldiers."

 russia.240.t: "The Young Pathfinders"
 russia.240.d: "Scouting boasts a long and proud history in Russia, originating in 1908 with Tsar Nikolay II's personal blessing and support. Though the Empire has disappeared, Russian Scouting has only continued to bloom, with tens of thousands of scouts across Russia organised under several different organisations. Many Scouts and Scout Masters fought under the banner of the Whites during the Civil War, and though they earned much glory, they were not spared the Whites' own political divides. National populist, monarchist, republican, and even some socialist Scouting groups emerged in the 1920s, keeping Russia's youth fit and active but quite at odds with one another.\n\nWith Russia's consolidation under the SZRS, this confused situation has become unacceptable, to say nothing of allowing children to be exposed to dangerous ideologies. General Karl Gopper, a major figure in Russian Scouting and a close ally of Savinkov, has initiated his plan to unify all Scouts into the Organisation of Russian Young Pathfinders. Progress has been brisk, as the initiative has received vocal support from Oleg Pantyukhov, the founder of Russian Scouting, as well as Boris Martino, a young but highly influential member of SZRS-aligned Scouting. Hopes are high that the unification campaign, paired with a new recruiting drive, will guarantee that future generations of young Russians will be raised with the patriotism and ideological education needed to keep the Motherland strong."
 russia.240.a: "Bud Gotov!"

 russia.241.t: "The Svobodnik Curriculum"
 russia.241.d: "Up to this point, our education system has been more focused on removing earlier liberal-communistic influences from the textbooks, but it has lacked greater ideological coherence. In an intra-party debate, two distinct factions have emerged. The Minister of Industry and Trade, Professor Aleksandr Voznesensky, has been a prominent supporter of a political-technical focus, preferring to favour hard sciences. He argues that Russia is best modernised through engineers and natural scientists, whose skills are needed to realise Russia's great ambitions. While political education is important, it must play a secondary role.\n\nThe opposite perspective has been taken up by Pyotr Boranetsky and his Academy of Spiritual Culture, which he presents as the model of future Russian schooling. The focus in education would be on self-realisation and creativity of the students through Symbolist and Steiner-inspired curriculum. Even the less spiritual members of the SZRS, such as Anastasy Vonsyatsky, have also pointed out that National Populism does not believe in materialism, but in will - which is best fulfilled through spiritual-oriented education."
 russia.241.a: "Political-technical education."
 russia.241.b: "Spiritual-cultural education."

 russia.242.t: "The Nature of National Populist Art"
 russia.242.d: "As we are remaking the human spirit, art is one of the most important tools in our hands. Thus far, the artistic life of Russia has been largely free, and the Ministry of Culture has sponsored various kinds of artistic projects as long as they have glorified the Russian nation. As the Vozhd's personal project, he has courted many avant-garde artists to work in state propaganda and great architectural projects. This has led to new theories of aesthetics among the SZRS intellectuals.\n\nFirst, there is the so-called Neo-Symbolist Vanguard, a group of artists around the brilliant Vasily Kandinsky. Kandinsky's themes stem from mystical spiritual experiences, of apocalyptic themes and the chaos of symbols. While some of his wilder creations have been left with less attention from state media, he does enjoy the admiration of Savinkov and many of those who stress the more esoteric aspects of National Populism. However, the admiration is hardly mutual, and Kandinsky has refused invitations to party events.\n\nThe more Futurist tendency in the movement has been drawn towards Aleksandr Rodchenko and other 'Constructivists'. Their art draws from modernity, from the steel and speed of the Machine Age, laid bare open. We have already been utilising much of the Constructivist style in our state propaganda, so it would be a natural step to formulate National Constructivism as the party's official style."
 russia.242.a: "Neo-Symbolism."
 russia.242.b: "National Constructivism."
 russia.242.c: "Take no sides."

 russia.244.t: "New Evidence Surfaces"
 russia.244.d: "Unseen evidence regarding the assassination of Viktor Chernov has found its way into the hands of [RUS_GetArmyChief]. How he came by the information is unclear, and it's entirely possible the chief of the army commissioned the investigation himself, utilising only the military intelligence away from the prying eyes of the SZRS. After all, the fate of Lavr Kornilov left much of the army bitter, feeling that Savinkov had unjustly politicked to remove the venerated general.\n\nRegardless of how these documents came to be, they do seem to imply President Savinkov's more direct involvement in the assassination of Viktor Chernov, and that this was later used to incriminate Kornilov. This contradicts the official story, where the assassin was very likely acting on the direction of Lavr Kornilov. It is possible that this 'evidence' has been crafted to whitewash Kornilov's role in the assassination, and came under heavy criticism from party-affiliated intelligence services. If it came to light that Kornilov was framed and took the fall for Savinkov's own assassination, one can be sure the military's faith in Savinkov would plummet."
 russia.244.a: "It's just talk."
 russia.244.b: "Punish those who spread such slander."
 russia.244.c: "Replace the chief of army."

 russia.245.t: "The Kornilov Conspiracy"
 russia.245.d: "With the recent investigations, we can finally answer what was happening behind the curtains in the aftermath of Chernov's assassination, according to a testimony from a certain stabs-captain who was part of Kornilov's inner circle. He described a conspiracy dating back to the 1934 elections, and has provided a picture of what drove Kornilov to this act of madness.\n\nIt appears Kornilov had come to regret his role in crushing Boldyrev's uprising in 1929 after he realised that Savinkov was far more dangerous and less controllable than Kornilov had originally imagined. Fearing betrayal, Kornilov kept his conspiratorial circle as small as possible, trusting that his position as Minister of War would sway both the army and the nation to his side once the president had been 'dealt with'.\n\nIt appears the plot began to unravel when Kornilov risked approaching Chernov to ask for his help in calming Russia once Savinkov was out of the picture. The details are unclear, but it seems the meeting between Kornilov and Chernov went very poorly, with Chernov disparaging what he saw as a barefaced power grab by the army.\n\nDisappointed and fearing a conspiracy revealing, Kornilov hastily arranged the infamous Chernov assassination. Having found Leonidov through a relative active in the conspiracy, Kornilov carefully altered the security at the Senate Palace so Leonidov would not be stopped, and ensured that the assailant would not survive for long. When the government voiced its scepticism of his theory about socialist plots, Kornilov feared exposure was only a matter of time, and initiated the assault on the Kremlin that concluded with his own demise."
 russia.245.a: "Kornilov, how could you?"

 russia.246.t: "The Sheep and the Fools"
 russia.246.d: "The Union for the Defence of the Motherland and Freedom has always been a group of exceptional men. Narodnaya Volya, the Combat Organisation, the first SZRS, the Combat Squads of the second SZRS - these are all 'Fraternities of Knights of Terror', in the Vozhd's words. They have no room for half-measures; they do not need men who are not willing to give their all.\n\nThe SZRS has assimilated millions of members during these past years, becoming a great mass movement - but also bloated and factionalist. Many conservatives joined the movement opportunistically and were rewarded with high offices back when the SZRS did not yet have uncontested control. Even the party central committee has many turncoat conservatives. This has been a wise policy, yes - but the Vozhd has decreed that, in the long term, it is harmful to the Party's moral and psychological fibre. Just as society needs to purge impurities from itself to succeed, so does the SZRS."
 russia.246.a: "We must send a message - those without faith must be disgraced."

 russia.246.c: "I am sure we can find evidence of their treason."

 russia.247.t: "Choosing a New Chairman-Minister"
 russia.247.d: "After major disagreements between the Vozhd and the Chairman-Minister, it was clear who would be leaving.\n\nIt falls to Savinkov to appoint a new Chairman-Minister to run the everyday errands of the Russian government - but a loyalist this time, a good man like Derental or Vendzyagolsky, not someone with wildly differing ideological views.\n\nIt would also be possible to simply merge the positions of Chairman-Minister and President, though it likely would not solve anything - someone still needs to be delegated to handle these matters."
 russia.247.a: "Party Secretary Vendzyagolsky."

 RUS_disable_factionalism_tt: "§nDisables any further changes of the Chairman-Minister.§!"

 russia.249.t: "All-Russian Combat Organisation"
 russia.249.d: "Russia's Red underground has, against all odds, weathered two decades of repression. With an ever-tightening police state, what remains of the resistance has become increasingly desperate. The Chief of the Okhrana's Moscow district, Colonel Boris Pashkovsky, died today as a bomb went off near his car in Tula. This is believed to be a response to his arranged mass arrest and execution of former Tula Coalworkers' Union organisers as suspected communists.\n\nResponsibility for the attack was claimed by the self-declared 'All-Russian Combat Organisation' (VRBO), which has been broadcasting illegal radio messages through transmitters in Belarus and Ukraine. This organisation seems to be mostly led by people affiliated with the Left-Socialist-Revolutionaries or other communists, but there is proof that they have also been attracting more moderate allies, united simply by their shared hatred of the Vozhd. SR agent Yakov Blyumkin seems to be the brain of the organisation, and major manhunts have been launched to find him, even if it means authorising operations on foreign soil."
 russia.249.a: "A terrorist's regime fighting terrorism."

 russia.250.t: "Creation of the VES"
 russia.250.d: "As Russia bears the aftershocks of Black Monday, it has become starkly clear that the country is facing the worst economic crisis in a decade. The Verkhovny Ekonomichesky Soviet, or 'Supreme Economic Council', has been established in record time by presidential fiat, but it faces a daunting task. The VES Chairman and Minister of Industry and Trade, Aleksandr Voznesensky, nevertheless delivered a widely reported speech to the Duma within days of his appointment, laying out Russia's immediate strategy for economic recovery.\n\nWith even short-term credit from abroad almost impossible to find and politically unpalatable, the state has stepped in to recapitalise and nationalise a sizeable portion of Russia's insolvent banks, placing them under the jurisdiction of a reorganised 'State Bank'. Given the weak reputation of the government as a borrower, plans have been put in place to issue bills of exchange through domestic proxy banks. Termed 'work creation bills', it is hoped that private sector investors will keep money flowing internally, with the goal of having these investments reach maturity once the economy has stabilised. Paired with harsh but focused austerity measures, the VES plan intends to balance finances by limiting government spending and maintaining internal liquid capital flows in public works programmes.\n\nThough ambitious strategies are already being workshopped for a total industrial transformation of Russia, the short-term goal is to maintain employment levels as high as possible for simple subsistence. If all goes well, Russia's working class will be able to bear the brunt of this austerity with government support, and be ready for an economic counter-offensive to win back the ground lost."
 russia.250.a: "Let's hope we get through this quickly."

 russia.251.t: "The Need for Land Reform"
 russia.251.d: "Russia has struggled with the question of how to both modernise and organise its vast countryside. Until their interruption by the Great War, the Stolypin Reforms attempted to dismantle the 'mir', the traditional peasant village, in favour of modern smallholders. The chaos of 1917 instead brought far more radical change - the 'Black Repartition' - as peasants took advantage of the breakdown of order to seize land for themselves. The subsequent SR-Kadet land reforms of 1923 were as much an attempt to restore order as they were a redistribution campaign. The reforms granted villages significant autonomy, while also allowing peasants to rent nationalised land at very low prices. Unfortunately, the campaign's other results were mixed.\n\nThough the peasants gained a great deal of acreage, the reforms were tarnished not only by enormous corruption in the Land Committees, but also by unclear intent over who would be receiving the land. The government 'purchased' vast tracts from landowners at below-market prices, but much of it would find itself in the hands of industrialists and wealthy peasants rather than the needy. Attempts to fix the reforms' flaws crumbled under the bickering of the SRs and Kadets.\n\n[RUS_land_reform_1]"
 russia.251.a: "Let's see how this goes..."
 RUS_land_reform_1_natpop: "President Savinkov thus finds himself with the unenviable job of correcting two decades of the old coalition's shortcomings. No one is keen for a repeat of 1932's peasant revolt in Tambov, which saw peasants gunned down after riots erupted in the wake of the Kadets' refusal to renegotiate land sales. The SZRS Minister of Agriculture, Pavel Agyeyev, has outlined an ambitious programme to correct past errors. Councils of judges, civil servants, agronomists, and surveyors will be mobilised across Russia and granted the authority to rule on cases of land division. Most are expecting the Councils to simply parcel out fresh land. However, meeting the peasants' wishes must be balanced with consolidating uselessly small plots into liveable allotments, even if some peasants are then obligated to find work elsewhere. Land is only part of the equation - Russia's farms must be modernised and expanded if they are to feed not only the growing population, but also the state's coffers."
 RUS_land_reform_1_dem: "Since former president Savinkov has failed to address that problem entirely, it is the transitional government that finds itself with the unenviable job of correcting two decades of the old coalition's shortcomings. No one is keen for a repeat of 1932's peasant revolt in Tambov, which saw peasants gunned down after riots erupted in the wake of the Kadets' refusal to renegotiate land sales. While the SZRS drafted its own plans that were supposed to solve the land problem, they are far too ambitious and too tainted by populist pandering to the peasantry. Still, if we cut them down in scope, those plans can be used to fast-track our own land reform and to prove our competence to the vast majority of the Russian population."

 russia.252.t: "Land Reform Begins"
 russia.252.d: "To destroy the peasants' common land is to destroy the soul of Russia. However, it is no secret that traditional strip farming is not only inefficient, but also that Central Russia simply lacks the land needed to sustain all its peasants. If every Russian is to prosper, then there is little choice but to consolidate fields and direct the excess rural population to nearby cities, or across the Urals into Siberia and Turkestan. Hopes are high that these efforts will, when paired with farm mechanisation and new agronomical colleges, increase crop yields exponentially while respecting the mir's traditions.\n\nAs Councils of Land Division have appeared across Russia, the new reform programme has entered its first official stages. Vast tracts of land have been earmarked for nationalisation. Thousands of surveyors and judges are busy working through a decade of legal backlog. New 'artels' - trade cooperatives - have been established to house and provide work for the influx of peasants into towns and cities. Unfortunately, not everyone has been pleased to discover what the reforms actually entail.\n\nSZRS party offices have been flooded with letters addressed to President Savinkov, demanding he punish ministers for 'misinterpreting' his orders. The elders of many villages are furious that the state has given rural officials not only a veto on the election of village headmen, but also reserved the right to appoint one if the locals prove difficult. The consolidation of land strips has flared tempers, as while many peasants want land, few are keen on redrawing boundaries or leaving their home village outright. Even the agronomic college scheme has received vitriol, with some letters arguing that time spent in classrooms is less time spent in the fields.\n\nThough the party's spirits have somewhat deflated, many are adamant that the reforms must proceed as planned, and that these are simply growing pains. There will undoubtedly be more opposition in the future - time will tell if the party is willing to pay the cost of confronting it."
 russia.252.a: "Let's keep the impact minimal, if we can."
 russia.252.b: "This needs to get done, no matter the reaction."

 russia.253.t: "Land Reform in Turkestan"
 russia.253.d: "Turkestan (which in Russian refers to the entire Central Asia) has been a destination for Russia's excess peasants since the Stolypin Reforms, and while migration slowed somewhat over the past decades, it has increased drastically as the SZRS' own land reform has gotten underway. Since much of the arable land in Turkestan had already been settled by 1910, many of the current settlers are instead decamping around the Kyrgyz steppe. This has drawn the ire of the locals, particularly the Kyrgyz (Kazakh) nomads, who are accusing the settlers of disrupting their traditional migration routes. Even the Cossacks, typically the policing arm of the Russian state in the region, have voiced their complaints about settlers stealing 'unused' land that the Cossacks keep for their herds.\n\nNor has Turkestan escaped controversy. Though facing fewer settlers, Turkestani villages have been singled out by the government for a similar consolidation and modernisation campaign as their Russian counterparts. The transition from the region's quasi-feudal 'kishlak' to the more modern 'shirkat' has proven controversial for many of the same reasons as it has in Russia - the peasants dislike consolidating fields and resent the supervision of outsiders. However, the situation is far more volatile in Turkestan, where the locals are claiming with some justification that the Councils of Land Division are overwhelmingly Russian, and biased accordingly.\n\nCentral Asian officials and peasants alike have banded together to demand that local tribunals be established to represent the interests of the indigenous population. There is little doubt that these tribunals will hamper the reform campaign, and so several party officials are quietly suggesting that the army and Cossacks be mobilised to nip this problem in the bud."

 russia.253.b: "Agree to the tribunal."
 RUS_land_tribunal_tt: "§GAlash Party supports this.§!"

 russia.254.t: "Farmer Strikes"
 russia.254.d: "With the first hurdles overcome, the land reform campaign has built powerful momentum. Many Russian newspapers have taken to publishing daily columns totalling the acreage of land given to peasants thus far, alongside letters of thanks to President Savinkov and the SZRS. However, for every success story, it seems another village's problems have only gotten worse.\n\nTo no one's great surprise, the field consolidation and migration programmes remain the most controversial issues. Out of respect for their independence, the villages themselves were given oversight for much of the process, but many disgruntled peasants have simply stopped bothering to listen to them any longer. Worse yet, anger against the reforms has begun to coalesce into open strikes. Farmers and landless peasants alike have banded together to decry the government's alleged 'kulakisation' of the countryside, stating that efforts to make farms economically viable have trumped promises to give all peasants a fair share of land.\n\nThe situation is tense, though violence has fortunately not yet broken out. Nevertheless, much of Russia's central Black Earth region has been paralysed by the strikes, jeopardising much-needed shipments of grain. Loyal units of the MVD and Cossacks are trying their best to restore order without resorting to bloodshed - the party cannot afford another Tambov."
 russia.254.a: "This must end immediately!"

 russia.255.t: "A Hitch in Reforms"
 russia.255.d: "While past land reforms have seen redistribution of land from nearly every social estate in Russia, one has remained conspicuously untouched. The aftermath of the Civil War saw many military officers cash in their retirements on tracts of cheap land purchased from the national land fund. Many actively serving officers did likewise, further complicating the question of how, if at all, this land is to be redistributed. With many former landowners penniless and unable to repurchase their old lands, this class of officers quickly filled the gap as one of the most disproportionately land-rich groups in Russia.\n\nThe officers, naturally, assert that their proud service to the nation entitles them to land that they both earned and bought fairly. Beyond simply holding vast tracts of land, it has become increasingly clear the present situation is also caustic to army morale, as many enlisted peasants have been dealt the ignominy of being commanded by their landlords. President Savinkov has refrained from commenting directly so as not to offend the military's delicate honour, but his writings extolling the 'Cossack Model' of peasant farmer-soldiers have often been cited by proponents of the reform. Distributing the officers' land may win back flagging public opinion, but earning new enemies in the military is no cheap trade either."
 russia.255.a: "They must surrender their land, with everyone else."
 russia.255.b: "They deserve their exemptions."

 russia.256.t: "Results of Land Reform"
 russia.256.d.minimal: "As the land reform programme has drawn to a close, opinions in Russia have divided in a way that the land itself often wasn't. The peasantry has, by all accounts, come away pleased with the government's tact. The lack of state coercion to force compliance has meant that many boundaries in the countryside remain untouched. Left to their own devices, peasant assemblies simply couldn't force their members to consolidate plots or move away - leaving an awkward stalemate across much of the countryside. Nevertheless, the campaign's uneventfulness has led to sighs of relief among those who feared turmoil.\n\nThe mood in the Ministries of Agriculture and Finance is, on the other hand, morose. Jokes have begun to circulate that some staff overslept and missed the campaign entirely. Bitterness has begun to creep into the missives sent for the government's review; there's no denying that much of the proposed land reform plan was diminished or scrapped entirely. While [RUS_land_reform_2] can applaud itself on keeping the Russian people happy in the short term, the reforms have failed to generate the conditions needed for a true revolution in Russian agriculture."
 russia.256.d.low: "The conclusion of the land reform campaign has brought with it the first trickle of good news from the Ministries of Agriculture and Finance. Though enforcement of land consolidation was middling at best, the initial results have already vindicated the decision to not back off entirely. The quantity of grain reaching both the domestic and export markets has increased markedly. The countryside, while chafing under some of the state's new supervision, has remained largely peaceful.\n\nHowever, some of the more independent voices in [RUS_land_reform_2] have voiced their concerns that too little was achieved with this opportunity. Internal reports have noted, rather bitterly, that if even a half-hearted land reform programme returned such visible results, then proper implementation could have given miracles. Others within the party have countered that pushing the reforms any further would have escalated resistance to an unacceptable level. In any case, the Ministries are content that at least some of the injustices of the past have been corrected, and that some costs of future industrialisation can be offset through agricultural profits."
 russia.256.d.moderate: "Both [RUS_land_reform_2] and Russia's countryside have endured the worst of the land reform's growing pains, and emerged stronger for it. Despite some shortcomings and concessions made to appease the public, the reforms went ahead largely as planned. Land plots across Russia have been consolidated decisively, and those peasants who could not find concessions in their home villages are provisioned for settlement elsewhere. The new peasant commons has regained its centrality in the official discourse, even if many of the peasants themselves are still adapting to the rapid changes.\n\nThe Ministries of Agriculture and Finance have presented glowing reports to [RUS.GetLeader] detailing the campaign's successes. Confidence is high that the more efficient farms, paired with greater access to modern equipment and technical education, will be able to both feed Russia's people and provide a consistent source of revenue for rapid industrialisation. Though some radical voices suggest more could have been achieved with the strictest enforcement, the vast majority are grateful that the difficulties endured have given Russia a fairer and far more productive countryside."
 russia.256.d.high: "Boris Savinkov has often promised a 'third revolution' for Russia, and as the dust settles on the land reform campaign, the nation has gained an understanding of the truth behind his words. The formal end of the land reform campaign has been marked with a military parade on Red Square. Given the intensity of the reforms, the substituting of tractors for tanks and spades for rifles is perhaps more literal than some in the SZRS are comfortable with. The Councils of Land Division, armed with the full authority of presidential mandate, proved utterly uncompromising in their pursuit of a 'just distribution', public objections notwithstanding. Dissent, strikes, and wrecking were all swiftly dealt with by MVD security troops and Cossacks.\n\nThe forcefulness of the reforms is already paying dividends, to the delight of the Ministries of Agriculture and Finance. The peasants' common land has survived, but its medieval farming has been banished to the past. Across the Republic, peasants have been given the land, tools, and education needed not only to survive, but to enrich both themselves and Russia. For some, their future will simply have to be built beyond their old homes. It may be years before the anger cools and new villages put down roots, but it cannot be doubted that Russia will soon be ready to crown herself the world's breadbasket. The SZRS has remade the countryside in its own image - and whispers claim the 'third revolution' has set its sights on industry next."

Filonenko proposed changes to the cabinet that would better align with the growing popularity of National Solidarist thinking within the SZRS base.\n\nHe argued that the Solidarist programme is very close to true Narodism and that it can provide the SZRS regime with a 'solid foundation' to build a hundred-year empire on top of. He is suggesting himself as the Chairman-Minister, with members of the National Union of Solidarists in a number of key positions."

Nonetheless, he has made a good impression on the Vozhd, and the two are on good terms. Savitsky is best known for his esoteric Eurasianist theories, but in practice, he has made himself an invaluable organiser and propagandist, efficiently recruiting gifted young radicals from academia. He has boldly proposed a cabinet reshuffle to better represent the growing importance of his 'Ideocrat' faction in the Party.\n\nSavitsky believes that Russia must be further centralised and made into a well-functioning totalitarian machine, combining both the highest ideological principles with the latest scientific efficiency, guarded by an all-powerful security service."

 russia.259.d: "The position of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief was created after the Civil War to ensure the independence of the military from the civilian government and to satisfy Lavr Kornilov's massive ego. At the same time, Kolchak was given an equal title, that of Supreme Admiral of the Navy, as a consolation prize. These positions also include control of the relevant ministry. However, this has meant that President Savinkov, in fact, has not been the Supreme Commander-in-Chief, but General-Fieldmarshal [RUS_GetArmyChief] has been.\n\nDespite the weakening of the position with legislation, thus far we have not dared to move so directly against the army as to remove their independent command structure. But with our current victories and amicable relations with [RUS_GetArmyChief], it would be very hard for the military to oppose appointing a new Supreme Commander-in-Chief, someone more loyal to Savinkov and less quarrelsome.\n\nOf course, General-Fieldmarshal [RUS_GetArmyChief] would keep their army command if they so wish and could retire in comfort after some years. It is more than time for someone else to carry their heavy burden for the Great Russian Republic."

It is vaguely known that these retreats include drug-fuelled spiritual contemplation and sex mixed with Dostoyevsky and Silver Age Symbolist poetry. In the meantime, the government is left in the hands of the [GetSecondInCommand] and other SZRS leaders."

 russia.261.t: "The Svobodnik Scandal"
 russia.261.d: "It turns out that Anastasy Vonsyatsky, former chief of the paramilitary Svobodnik organisation and chief of the Moscow Civil Police, has been less than a model citizen. An investigation launched into him by the Tax Committee has uncovered evidence of bribery, tax evasion, and abusing state office to intimidate people for financial gain. He avoided the eye of the police for a long time, thanks to his visible position and popularity in certain circles, so it is unclear why he is being investigated now. It is possible that the order has come from higher up, such as from the Director of the Okhrana himself. Klepikov has never masked his disdain for opportunistic brutes such as Vonsyatsky.\n\nVonsyatsky has quite a reputation. He has often been accused of a lavish lifestyle supported by the wealth of his current wife Nadezhda's family, whose Russo-Asiatic Bank was surprisingly protected from further liquidation, probably because of Vonsyatsky's connections. Jokingly referred to as the 'Tsar of the Svobodniks', Vonsyatsky is the epitome of new money and has a taste for aristocratic opulence. Several times he has made headlines with his escapades, drug use, and multiple lovers.\n\nHe is a common speaker at SZRS rallies, a 'tough guy from the street', and even more infamous for inciting popular violence against those he considers enemies of the party. Still, his methods have worked well, but perhaps there is no more need for a paramilitary leader now that the state has a monopoly on violence?\n\nIt wouldn't be hard to shield him from the investigation, but the question is... do we want to?"

The remaining heavy industry is owned by domestic millionaires who have not been willing to do much business with us. Vtorov's vast business empire, Lebedev's Yaroslav works, Count Yusupov's Caspian oil fields, Nobel's industries, Putilov's remaining businesses... there are still many privately-owned 'businesses of national interest', as they are classified.\n\nInside the party, Boris Vyshastselav has been warning against too heavy-handed actions towards those who have 'earned their empire fairly'. These economic moderates argue that it is not a threat to state planning that some part of heavy industry remains in private hands, as these businessmen would also make political allies.\n\nHowever, the Minister of Industry and Trade, Aleksandr Voznesensky, is adamant - how can a national economy be planned if all its parts do not obey the brain? He and other experts from the VES wish to proceed with total nationalisation, either by compensating the businessmen or not."

 russia.263.d: "Streamlining the internal security agencies under the control of a single party organisation has been a long-time goal. Under former governments, law enforcement was lax, and communists were allowed to operate at ease. With the new presidential decree, the State Guard - Gosstrazha (Gosudarstvennaya Strazha) - will be expanded into a general security body, and everything from border guard service to law enforcement and the secret police will be incorporated under it. Likewise, the Gosstrazha's duties will involve the protection of the president and the party leadership, and they will be picked only from the most loyal Russians, swearing their oath of service to the Vozhd himself. Savinkov has appointed Flegont Klepikov as the Director of the Gosstrazha from his earlier position as the Director of Okhrana. Director Klepikov immediately began personnel transfers to ensure the efficiency and loyalty of the organisation.\n\nThe question of the actual extent of the Gosstrazha's powers has worried the military in particular. It has been suggested to transfer special military areas, such as the North Caucasus and future 'liberated' territories, under the Gosstrazha's authority. This way, the military could focus purely on external enemies, while the actual administration of areas behind the frontline would be done by Gosstrazha units under political leadership. However, it would essentially expand the organisation from an extensive security agency into a full 'shadow army' controlled by the Vozhd's men directly, which has made the army leadership worried over inefficient use of manpower and resources - and though it is not said openly, worried for their lives."

 russia.263.b: "Klepikov will also handle the occupied regions."

 russia.264.t: "Ministry of National Culture"
 russia.264.d: "A major reason for the SZRS' success has not been the content of their message, but that it is the loudest and best-articulated one. To continue our propaganda efforts, a new ministry has been organised which not only handles typical cultural matters but also has extensive powers to control the press and sizeable funding to fund cultural projects deemed useful for national unity. In addition, state radio infrastructure shall be under the supervision of the ministry.\n\nThe ministry will be seeking to collaborate with artists whose work can be given official approval. With these 'national artists', proper values will be instilled into the consciousness of the people. Art, music, poetry, cinema, sports, chess, ballet - if it is part of the collective Russian psyche, it must be directed to serve the state and the Vozhd and instil people with complete faith in the Third Russia.\n\nTwo chief candidates for the post are party secretary Karol Vendzyagolsky and doctor Pyotr Savitsky. Vendzyagolsky has already been the de facto state chief propagandist, directing the SZRS' public relations and magazines, and would continue with a powerful message: the Vozhd, the most extraordinary man who has ever lived, has a God-given vision, and every Russian who follows him will have a place in this great future. Savitsky is a somewhat more radical choice, as he seeks to focus propaganda on remaking the entire Russian identity. His mantra, 'We have more in common with the Turk than the German', is the tenet of his thinking; Russians should abandon ideas of Westernity and enlightenment, and fully embrace their martial past. Either way, the ideals of the SZRS will be inserted into all media."
 russia.264.a: "Vendzyagolsky is brilliant already!"
 russia.264.b: "Savitsky's vision is revolutionary."

 russia.265.t: "The Artelisation"
 russia.265.d: "Given the SZRS' veneration of the 'mir', the traditional peasant village, it is to be expected that the party fawns over the equally venerable institution of the 'artel'. Typically translated as a trade cooperative, the artel has organised artisans, peasants, and workers for centuries. In more recent decades, artels have become a cornerstone of urban-rural mingling in Russia, as peasants migrating to find seasonal work in cities almost invariably organised themselves into artels based on their village of origin. Artels played a curious role, both feeding new members into far more 'proletarianised' trade unions, but also maintaining traditional links with the countryside.\n\nHowever, the Civil War and rise of the SZRS have seen artels and unions cleaved further apart. With its origins as a peasant party, the SZRS found natural allies in the artels, who had grown disillusioned with the scorn they received from avowedly proletarian unions. Savinkov himself has played a role in this alliance as well, as both the artel's traditionalism and revolutionary potential have featured in his own writings. A long-admirer of the nihilist Sergey Nechayev, Savinkov has adapted elements of Nechayev's social order, once disparaged by Marx and Engels as 'Barracks Communism'.\n\nWith the SZRS in power and land reform bringing more peasants to the cities than ever before, the time is ripe for the artel to become a new pillar for Russia. Official patronage will make the artels a fixture in state-run industry, with workers housed, fed, and directed in an environment of discipline and equality. The trade unions have already voiced their total opposition to this 'attack on organised labour', but given that the extirpation of syndicalism is one of the objectives for the expansion of the artel system, this can only mean the plan is working."
 russia.265.a: "They will have to cope."

 russia.266.t: "Federal Structure of Russia"
 russia.266.d: "The federal republic of Russia has various self-governing areas, most importantly the Alash and the Caucasus regions, and its ten Cossack Hosts. In addition, gubernias have their own self-autonomy and regional Dumas, and ones classified as cultural minority gubernias even elect their own Commissar, instead of having a Moscow-appointed governor. The whole system is a series of compromises, though not entirely disagreeable to the SZRS programme - after all, we do stress freedom of the peasantry and of the common people, and have also drawn support from national minorities. Still, the system is bothersome, especially as the local democracy of large cities has kept them in the hands of our political enemies.\n\nThe options on the table are three-fold. Either we could keep the system as it is, but simply ensure that SZRS or their local supporter parties run every regional Duma in the country, through intimidation, suppression, and propaganda. This is already true in much of the countryside.\n\nAlternatively, we could add an additional layer of control over this autonomy in the form of absolute presidential oversight. All laws passed by regional Dumas could be repealed by the President at will, making sure that if politically questionable forces rise into power, they cannot do lasting damage. This is the solution the Vozhd himself seems to prefer.\n\nThe third option is to start eroding the entire system by gradually restricting the powers of these regional Dumas and autonomies until they serve as mere paper stamps and bureaucratic centres. This would be unpopular even among some of our base, but it would ultimately result in a most centralised system."

 russia.267.d: "The Russian Air Force, the VVFR, has generally focused on small bombers and the support of land operations, largely because of Kornilov's insistence. Young air force officer and theorist Vasily Khripin has been a particularly vocal supporter of a change of direction: the air force should become an instrument of terror rather than a mere replacement for artillery.\n\nThe topic has also drawn the interest of the Vozhd, who has often expressed the importance of Russian aviation and showcased it in the SZRS' propaganda. It is said that his terrorist cell was already planning to utilise an aeroplane to assassinate the Tsar in 1907. With modern technology, air power has become 'the radical solution to the question of terror'. Instead of bombing individuals, modern technology enables bombing entire nations into terror and submission.\n\nHowever, the army's leadership is more sceptical - in particular, [RUS_GetArmyChief] argues that the current doctrine of battlefield support is a more effective use of Russia's limited bomber fleets. However, 'The Terror Lobby', centred around Khripin, are pushing for their own military school - and possibly, in the future, their own terror bombing force."

Fight, he urged the liberals and the socialists. Never compromise - not with Lenin, not with the Kaiser. But he was not listened to! And for it, Russia bled.

For the spirit of defeat did not come from the common Russian, it permeated from the corrupt elites downwards, degenerating the character of the good Russian man and woman!'\n\n'So, the dreamed and accursed day has finally come. One announced so many times by poets, prophets and philosophers, a day of judgment and final reckoning. The war that will define ages. Why will we win this time? Because we are united behind our great Vozhd and behind our great Russian State! We will not be stabbed in the back this time; we will not be demoralised and poisoned this time. No, my brothers and sisters; we will triumph!'"
 russia.269.a: "Studio applause!"

 russia.270.t: "A Question of Funding"
 russia.270.d: "The consolidation of banks and issuing of the work creation bills has succeeded in bringing in some liquid capital from domestic investors, but it's a far cry from the total needed for all of the state's expenditures and debts. With the VES feverishly attempting to gather as much money as possible for the state's many planned reforms, the time has come to make the difficult choice of who to sacrifice for the nation's sake. The VES has outlined three possible approaches.\n\nThe first is to drastically cut military expenditures. This would entail ceasing procurement of new equipment and furloughing as many troops as safely possible. The Stavka is incredulous at the suggestion that Russia's defences be weakened to such an extent, to say nothing of their salaries.\n\nThe second option is to instead target the public. Austerity can save rubles from otherwise being spent on social services. More importantly, the government can force farmers to once again sell their grain for export rather than waiting for prices to rebound. The peasants will be furious, but the state is struggling without the crucial agricultural exports that underpin much of Russia's budget.\n\nFinally, the third approach is to draw foreign credit into Russia no matter how unfavourable the terms may be. Given President Savinkov's promise to break Russia's economic slavery to Germany, many will see such a decision as a surrender to the power that caused this economic catastrophe in the first place."
 russia.270.a: "Take it out of the military budget."
 russia.270.b: "The people will need to tighten their belts."
 russia.270.c: "Some concessions to foreign industry should get us results."

 russia.271.t: "Fate of the Fifth Department"
 russia.271.d: "Before the 1920s, Russian military intelligence was scattered between several departments and was severely understaffed. It was finally centralised and consolidated into the Fifth Department of the General Chief of Staff of the War Ministry in 1927, commonly called Pyatoe Otdelenie (5O). Since 1930 it has been headed by Pavel Shatilov, a known monarchist and a longtime friend and ally of Pyotr Wrangel. Under his leadership, the 5O saw further expansion and reorganisation, massively improving Russia's intelligence capabilities. Nevertheless, as we solidify control over the domestic and foreign intelligence apparatus within the Gosstrazha under Director Klepikov, Shatilov's political affiliations make him an unreliable element for the SZRS. While it is clear that Shatilov must go, Commander-in-Chief [RUS_GetArmyChief] and the military make it clear that they will not tolerate any structural changes to their departments. We have to make a choice.\n\nWe can acquiesce to the army's wishes and replace Shatilov with Pyotr Glazenap, one of the 5O's founders and its current deputy chief. A skilled intelligence officer, Glazenap possesses no loyalty to any military faction and has a history of being friendly towards the SZRS. However, it is also no secret that Glazenap is ambitious and his predisposition to our regime goes only as far as the stability of [RUS.GetNameDef].\n\nAnother option is Nikolay Sakharov, a SZRS veteran from the Civil War days, currently heading the Moscow Military District. While he is not quite as experienced as Glazenap, he compensates for it with political reliability and loyalty to Savinkov. Assigning him as the Chief of the Fifth Department would increase our influence within the General Staff without overtly angering [RUS_GetArmyChief].\n\nFinally, we have a third option. We can ignore the army's mandates, dissolve the 5O and transfer it from the General Staff, which reports to the Commander-in-Chief, to a new military intelligence department within the Gosstrazha, which reports directly to Klepikov and consequently - Savinkov himself. This will no doubt severely anger the military and [RUS_GetArmyChief], who will see this as a brazen infringement on the army's autonomy."
 russia.271.a: "Glazenap is Russia's best razvedka specialist."
 russia.271.b: "Our man Sakharov is the safest choice."
 russia.271.c: "Let the army whine. The Gosstrazha will handle intelligence."

 russia.272.t: "Formalisation of the Special Combat Detachments"
 russia.272.d: "The first attempts at special recon and sabatour units in Russia were the hunter (okhotnik) teams, small units of NCOs which existed 1886 to 1908. During the Great War, the Russian Army revived the concept in the shape of small units of irregular cavalry, formally known as Special Importance Detachments (Otryady osoboy vazhnosti), to conduct sabotage and intelligence operations behind enemy lines. While not particularly successful against the Germans, the experience gained was used to great effect by White cavalry and partisan detachments in raids and underground operations against the Bolshevik rear during the Civil War.\n\nGeneral-Major Nikolay Zuyev, lecturer at the General Staff Academy and veteran of the Punin Detachment, has approached [RUS_GetArmyChief] with a sweeping plan for recreating them under the name of Special Combat Detachments (Osobye boyevye otryady), as fully modern special forces with a standardised operational doctrine and somewhat expanded mission profile, including psychological warfare and the recruitment of sympathetic foreign nationals.\n\nThe proposal has received wide backing within the army, including General Staff luminaries such as General Kutepov, who was an okhotnik during the Russo-Japanese War, and Zuyev's colleague from the General Staff Academy, Nikolay Golovin. However, controversy has erupted over the extent of the programme; some only support a small, highly elite force directly under the General Staff, whereas others argue for its expansion to every front command.\n\nAs always, the ultimate decision lies with [RUS_GetArmyChief]."
 russia.272.a: "A small force is a reliable force. The General Staff will control special operations."
 russia.272.b: "Our theatres are numerous and diverse. Assign special forces to every front headquarters."

 russia.275.t: "The Road to Recovery"
 russia.275.d.szrs: "The German depression struck Russia like a tidal wave, and although the floodwaters have not entirely receded, it has become clear that the worst has passed. Bread lines that once snaked across whole city blocks have dwindled. Curfews intended to stop riots and looting have been lifted. Shuttered factories have been stoked back to life. Muscovites laugh that the new government must be run by an artel of sign-painters, who have made a fortune prettying-up the city's new storefronts.\n\nThe rapid and decisive intervention planned by the VES has helped offset the most crippling damage, albeit at a cost. Hardship still lies ahead. The only thing still plentiful after Black Monday was evidence that the economic ties between Russia and Germany are fundamentally flawed. Russia rebuilds for now, but a reckoning is coming."
 russia.275.d.dem: "The German Depression struck Russia like a tidal wave, and although the floodwaters have not entirely receded, it has become clear that the worst has passed. Bread lines that once snaked across whole city blocks have dwindled. Shuttered businesses have come back to life, and market squares are again full of life. And it did not require Savinkov's tyrannical methods, but was achieved through the toil and perseverance of the ordinary Russian, looking bravely towards a brighter future."
 russia.275.d.soc: "The German Depression struck Russia like a tidal wave, and although the floodwaters have not entirely receded, it has become clear that the worst has passed. Bread lines that once snaked across whole city blocks have dwindled. But the capitalism that has plagued the Russian people so much has finally been slain, and the true people's economy is beginning to show itself."
 russia.275.a: "Russia stands strong!"

 russia.280.t: "The Voskhod Programme"
 russia.280.d: "Since Russia was first hit by Black Monday, several efforts have been made to deal with the crisis. Few would doubt these have been effective. The economy dealt with the worst effects of the depression and is now speeding up along the road to full recovery, but despite the government's efforts, many problems remain, more than a few of which predate the crash. The landless and unemployed wander Russia in search of work, while in much of the countryside, the Republican government's failed land reform holds back the country's full potential.\n\nThe biggest of these problems lies with Russian industry, or rather, the lack thereof. Compared to the modern and industrialised states of Europe, Russia is pitifully backward. Put simply, there are too many men and too few factories. In 1935, the SZRS announced the Voskhod programme to industrialise Russia and solve our economic woes. The programme was put on hold because of Black Monday, but now that we've recovered from the crisis, the time is right to restart it. Landless farmers, unemployed workers, and vagrants will all be enlisted into a professional 'Army of Labour', ready to serve the state and wage an all-out war against the backwardness which has plagued Russia for so long. In addition to the rapid industrialisation promised as part of the Voskhod programme, plans are also in the works to handle issues of excess population through a programme of massive resettlement in Siberia and Turkestan. Pioneers will construct new communities through which they can earn land and produce food to feed our ever-growing population. All of this will be administered through the VES, which can finally shift its focus from dealing with the depression.\n\nOf course, the general reaction from the public has been overwhelmingly positive so far. There's no doubt the programme will continue to raise support for the SZRS and Savinkov's rule, after all, how could anyone be against such a patriotic plan?"
 russia.280.a: "We look forward to the fruits of their labour."

 russia.281.t: "First Project Completed"
 russia.281.d: "Under the Republic, Russia stagnated. Her industry was betrayed to foreigners and German bankers, getting fat off the hard labour of our people while feeble politicians stood shamefully back and watched. No more! Now, the country celebrates the beginning of a new era of self-reliance as the first Voskhod project is finally completed.\n\nThere were many hardships along the way, but as the project came to a close yesterday, it seemed to have all been worth it. Later that day, President Savinkov himself gave a speech, thanking the Voskhod labourers and stating that this was just the first of many triumphs."
 russia.281.a: "Hurrah!"

 russia.282.t: "[RUS_GetArmyChief] Expresses Concern"
 russia.282.d.nowar: "While the Voskhod programme has been a great help to us so far, it doesn't come without a cost. Russia's manpower is large but far from infinite. Each man working to drill oil or build factories is a man who isn't serving in the army. This issue has been the concern of [RUS_GetArmyChief], who, in a recent meeting with the President, advised him to halt recruitment for the programme.\n\nHe claimed that while Russia may not be at war yet, pushing forward with the programme would risk creating a lack of conscripts for when the time comes. It seems this feeling is shared among much of the military. Ignoring [RUS_GetArmyChief]'s advice would surely anger them."
 russia.282.d.war: "While the Voskhod programme has been a great help to us so far, it doesn't come without a cost. Russia's manpower is large but far from infinite. Each man working to drill oil or build factories is a man who isn't serving in the army. This issue has been the concern of [RUS_GetArmyChief], who, in a recent meeting with the President, advised him to halt recruitment for the programme.\n\nHe claimed that due to the current war, the government's top priority should be to ensure enough conscripts for the army and that pushing forward with Voskhod recruitment would be a terrible mistake. It seems this feeling is shared among much of the military. If Savinkov were to ignore [RUS_GetArmyChief]'s advice, it would surely anger them."
 russia.282.a: "We'll take it under advisement."

 russia.283.t: "Camp Conditions Cause Concern"
 russia.283.d: "When the Voskhod programme was first restarted, the government was greeted with a wave of popular enthusiasm as landless peasants and unemployed workers were enlisted to perform a great service to Russia, but as the programme continued, optimism among the workforce began to wane. According to official guidelines, workers in the programme are to receive a fair wage equal to the amount of work they put in, as well as healthcare and decent rations. Housing and clothing, all paid for at the state's expense, are another guarantee for the men. It's a sad reality though that the budget can only be stretched so far. Recently, the VES received a report detailing conditions on the ground. Men at a Voskhod camp in the Don region were described as more closely resembling vagrants than workers - poorly clothed, paid scraps, malnourished, and forced into backbreaking labour from sunrise to sunset. Local administrators had apparently been demanding obscene quotas to meet projected targets. Housing conditions fared little better, one observer repulsed at the state of the cramped, rat-infested barracks the men were forced to reside in.\n\nThese conditions may be hard, but all true citizens know that the nation must always come first. All must do their patriotic duty to build a strong country, able to fearlessly look her rivals in the eye. Of course, not everyone sees it that way. News is starting to leak from the camps, and should news continue to leak, the party may very well find itself in a major scandal and left with no choice but to shut down the programme. An early shutdown would cripple the country at a vital moment - protecting the public from news that would dampen morale is vital to ensuring the programme's continued success. Keeping an eye on dissent inside the camps is no less important. A few strikes would be enough to slow progress; a mutiny would be downright disastrous."
 russia.283.a: "They signed up, didn't they?"

 russia.284.t: "Work Scandal in Nizhny Tagil"
 russia.284.d: "As vital as extraordinary efforts are for enabling Russia to compete with Germany, there is a limit to how far these efforts can go, as the government unfortunately learned when what began as mere rumours surrounding Nizhny Tagil laid the foundations for a full-blown scandal. News has leaked describing the inhumane treatment of workers at the Nizhny Tagil camp, overseers reportedly tripling the work requirements and paying no more than scraps.\n\nIn addition, the men received virtually no time off, being forced to endure workdays as long as 14 hours, and tales of a few unfortunate accidents have also begun to pick up steam. Higher pay and fewer hours are common demands among workers. Accepting these conditions is not an option - Russia demands a disciplined workforce and the VES lacks the resources to accept regardless, though some kind of compromise is necessary. A small increase in pay combined with the promise of better conditions once funding appears should hopefully be enough to keep the men from condemning us once they've left.\n\nOf course, the consequences of the scandal on the government have proved troublesome. Increasingly greater portions of the public sympathise with the labourers, some even speaking out despite official and not-so-official discouragement. If the situation continues to escalate, workers will strike with a sympathetic public behind them, delaying progress and embarrassing the President."
 russia.284.a: "Hopefully it doesn't lead to that..."

 russia.285.t: "Voskhod Strikes"
 russia.285.d: "Conditions at the Voskhod labour sites, typically isolated from most centres of civilisation and worsened by the long hours, are expectedly rather poor, but usually, labourers are paid enough to survive while overseers stop any troublemakers from attempting to set us all back. When one these two checks is removed, however, the system cannot sustain itself, as we are discovering at one of our sites. Faced with a flash flood of men pouring in thanks to the Voskhod programme, local farmers found an abundant source of demand for their products and were reportedly charging obscene prices.\n\nMany workers who believed they would be able to earn a decent wage while employed by the state found themselves instead sinking into debt. There had also been great frustration over the particularly uncaring attitudes of certain overseers and large quotas the men were given, the treatment they received so poor, they claimed they were seen as little more than slaves.\n\nEventually, tensions grew too great and workers walked off the job in protest over the conditions they've been subjected to. The ringleaders of the strike will have to be dealt with and order restored, but once that has finished, fewer hours and family exemptions from conscription will be granted, else we will be seen as nothing more than slave drivers. While the strike will undoubtedly slow progress for a little while, many in the party also worry what effect this incident may have on public opinion.\n\nNews of the strike has been spreading quickly despite our best efforts to keep a handle on the situation, and the programme, along with Savinkov's regime, is beginning to lose its popularity. If continuing with our plans means losing the support of the public, it may be best to stop before the situation spirals out of control."
 russia.285.a: "This is a necessary price to pay."
 russia.285.b: "Perhaps it's time to consider ending the programme..."

 russia.287.t: "Voskhod Projects Complete"
 russia.287.d: "Today, Moscow is in celebration. Though there have been many attempts to bring Russia into the modern era, none could claim success until today. The VES has declared the Voskhod programme an undeniable success, citing the rapid advances made in industrial capacity, economic growth, and modernisation of the countryside.\n\nA fireworks show took place on Red Square to celebrate the triumph along with a short military parade, tanks produced in Voskhod-built factories featuring among them. At the end, the leader himself gave a speech over the radio, thanking the people for their efforts and stressing the need for economic self-sufficiency. In throwing off the 'German yoke' and bringing about a government which is the truest expression of popular will, the President declared, Russia has at long last been able to enter a new age of development.\n\nDespite the many criticisms endured because of the programme, it seems that its completion has also been a major propaganda coup for Savinkov's rule. The Republic and Empire failed; the strong, visionary leadership of the SZRS was ultimately required to rejuvenate the country, or so the party's supporters claim.\n\nOur efforts have not gone unnoticed by the German sphere either. Though the goal of the programme was economic competition with Mitteleuropa, with the world seemingly stumbling from one crisis to another, it may not be long before competition between the two giants of the East finally spreads to the battlefield..."
 russia.287.a: "A difficult process, but a necessary one."

 russia.288.t: "Voskhod Programme Ended"
 russia.288.d: "With seemingly no end in sight for the newspaper exposés and public demonstrations against the inadequacies of the Voskhod Programme, the government has been left with little choice but to shutter the project prematurely. Though some of the work camps, particularly those destined for permanent settlement, may one day grow into proper towns and villages, many others are already being dismantled or will simply be left open to the elements.\n\nTens of thousands of former labourers are now clogging train stations and roadways, few with more to show for their efforts than the clothes on their back. The mood in the Duma and State Council is no less caustic, with every meeting seeming to devolve into mutual recrimination over who or what led to this disaster. In any case, the Voskhod Programme has fallen short of expectations and introduced new problems to deal with - one can only hope that Russia will find other methods with which to modernise itself before it is too late."
 russia.288.a: "So be it!"

 russia.290.t: "The Izotovite Movement"
 russia.290.d: "A story from a minor newspaper has broken into national consciousness. Nikifor Alekseyevich Izotov, a humble peasant's son who found work through the Oryol Mining Artel, has broken the world record in the most coal extracted, hitting almost 600 tons in 6 hours. The mine has already been known for efficient work methods, and it has constantly fulfilled its planned goals by hundreds of percents.\n\nWhen interviewed by Svoboda, Izotov said that any miner could achieve the same. His 'secrets' were merely rational techniques and good, organised work. 'I try to organise my working day and not to waste time, which is precious both for me and for the state', he explained.\n\nHis achievements have quickly caught the eye of the propaganda machinery, making Izotov into a symbol for what all Russian workers should be. Cash rewards, benefits, and medals for setting new production records are being established, and schools to teach 'the Izotovite method' of work rationalisation are already being founded around the country, now as an official part of the Voskhod Programme."
 russia.290.a: "Give rewards for those who go above and beyond."
 russia.290.b: "They are merely doing their duty."

 russia.291.t: "Restorative Labour Service Decree"
 russia.291.d: "Like after the Civil War, Russia's prisons are full of traitors and other miscreants. Unpatriotic protesters and strikers, communist saboteurs and provocateurs, German agents - the list is long and severe. However, many of these crimes can be made right through service to the Motherland. While the hated Katorga penal labour system was abolished in 1917 as a tool of Tsarist oppression, a special law was utilised after the Civil War for the Reds.\n\nThe Restorative Labour Service Decree has once again been dug up by the government, which would temporarily add forced labour in Siberia as a punishment for certain types of criminals. In exchange for work, the sentences of these criminals would be reduced. However, this may hurt the image of Plan Voskhod - it is meant to be a celebration of the Russian worker, not seen as a punishment."
 russia.291.a: "Wash away the treason with work."
 russia.291.b: "Some crimes can never be forgiven."

 russia.292.t: "[GetMoscowTreatyName] Assistance Plan of [GetYear]"
 russia.292.d: "The Central Planning Board of [GetMoscowTreatyName] has started drafting a new technological development plan in cooperation with the VES. The intent of these plans is to propel sectors of research and development into great leaps into the future, outdoing our rivals in both quality and quantity.\n\nOur allies are also offered a place in these plans, as every economy in Moscow's orbit should utilise resources towards this one goal the best they can."

 russia.293.a: "Alright."
 russia.293.b: "It's not for us."

 russia.294.t: "The Loyalty Clause"
 russia.294.d: "Can you believe that until now, there were no checks on our civil servants' moral and ideological beliefs? It has been perfectly possible for an unpatriotic governor to appoint a well-known socialist as the chief of police, or a judge. And this has been happening often, especially in larger, socialist-dominated cities.\n\nSuch criminality ends now. With the Loyalty Clause of the new Civil Service Law, all civil officials and employees of public institutions such as schools must prove their loyalty to the Motherland by joining the SZRS and abiding by its rules. Any person who is not a member of the SZRS is ineligible for these positions. There are plans to extend the law to priests and military officers, but for now these groups are expected to self-moderate.\n\nAs expected, this has led to a massive surge of new SZRS members, and some amount of protest resignations. Obviously, unpatriotic officials such as those with ties to communist organisations are barred from SZRS membership, de facto meaning termination of their employment and generally starting a police investigation to see if they pose a danger to the public."
 russia.294.a: "Love for Russia is the most important qualification."
 russia.294.b: "Make some exceptions for the best."

 russia.295.t: "Flying Squads of the Security Department"
 russia.295.d: "Russia has been rotten to the core, and the communist taint has reached its very depths. Until now, the police have not had the resources to persecute the enemies of the state in the far-flung parts of the country, but this has changed now. With the new Flying Squads of the Okhrana, regional investigations can be conducted anywhere in Russia. These squads, composed of the most loyal Svobodniks, will tour rural Russia and establish temporary investigative boards in cooperation with the local authorities to root out any anti-Russian actors who have until now flown under the radar of the authorities.\n\nThese flying squads have been successful thus far. Without the need for tiresome trials and the lethargy of local police forces, and instead relying on tips from local patriots, the arrest and execution rates have gone up by double digits. The commission led by Captain Boris Petrovich Toedtli reached the record number of 37 shot communists based on a single investigation in Petrozavodsk."
 russia.295.a: "The enemies of Russia cannot rest, even in the remotest place."

 russia.296.t: "Decree on Universities"
 russia.296.d: "A large series of arrests began today as security raided all of Russia's universities simultaneously. They arrested over five thousand people and confiscated a large number of documents for the investigations. This operation to 'purify Russia's palaces of decadence' has been long-promised by Svobodnik propaganda, and the fear of it has already sent many - especially Jewish - members of the academia into exile.\n\nToo long have the universities poisoned Russian culture and the minds of its youth with Judeo-Bolshevik ideas. Many student organisations have been successfully fighting this plague already from the 1920s - fights where many of our younger members saw their political awakening - but finally a coup de grâce has been made. With one swift stroke, Russia's cabal of enemies has been put down. Once the courts have processed them for their various crimes against the nation, those saved from the bullet will be put to work, to learn to love Russia through their labour.\n\nNow vacant professorships and other positions in the university administration are being filled with the brightest minds of the SZRS. Additionally, new professorships have been founded, such as Political Economy, Steppe Studies and Russian Folk Culture."
 russia.296.a: "Another stronghold of socialism vanquished."
 russia.296.b: "Try to gather allies from conservative academia."

 russia.297.t: "The Institute for Hypnotic and Mystical Studies"
 russia.297.d: "A petition for founding a new scientific institute found its way to the president's desk today. Doctor Aleksandr Vasilyevich Barchenko is requesting funding from the Vozhd for a new institute focused on unlocking the potential of the human mind. Barchenko has studied the phenomena of 'emiryachenye', a kind of hallucinatory possession common in Northern Russia, and published many controversial studies on the human mind during the 1920s and 1930s.\n\nHe joined the SZRS in 1933 and brought his esoteric lodge, the 'United Brotherhood', into the influence of the party. It has since then become a sizeable esoteric group within the party, attracting members such as esotericist Pyotr Uspensky and astronomer Aleksandr Kondiayn. Even Savinkov himself has taken part in some meetings of the group, having expressed his interest in their work.\n\nBarchenko and his supporters argue that research into techniques of hypnosis and telepathy would, in addition to increasing our understanding of the natural world, expand the methods of the secret police to include brainwashing, thought-reading, and lie-detection through astral vibration. If properly funded, Russia has a chance to become the leading power in research into the hidden parts of the human mind."
 russia.297.a: "This man is a genius, fund him."
 russia.297.b: "What is this NONSENSE?"

 russia.298.t: "Decree on Internal and External Border Controls"
 russia.298.d: "Freedom of movement is regularly abused by the enemies of the state. Either it is rootless miscreants wandering the country, avoiding work and committing crimes, or more serious saboteurs or spies. Additionally, many people have been leaving Russia for Ukraine, Belarus, or any other border state, with the least principled ones simply going to Germany, often with their wealth.\n\nA new decree on border controls has changed all of this. All Russian residents require identification papers to pass through internal borders, and any person with no legitimate reason to reside where they are is liable to be conscripted for work. Additionally, anyone seeking to leave Russia will be subject to the freezing of their assets within the country and limited only to the items they may need for a vacation or a business trip. In practice, this means the nationalisation of assets from anyone trying to leave the country and not returning within a given amount of time.\n\nBoth of these duties have been merged under the MVD's internal security bureau. Due to a lack of resources, we should initially focus more on one aspect of the decree and increase security as more resources are given for it."
 russia.298.a: "Focus on internal borders."
 russia.298.b: "Focus on external borders."
 russia.298.c: "Just give them all the money they need."

 russia.299.t: "Grim Reports from the Countryside"
 russia.299.d: "Russia's peasantry is the rock-solid foundation of the SZRS and the Third Russia and has arguably escaped much of the most repressive actions by the regime. However, reports by the Ministry of Finance are worrisome. The planners of the VES have calculated that our land reforms have led to a decrease in overall agricultural productivity - something they already warned of earlier when the focus was mainly on giving peasants their own land plots and restoring villages, while often breaking apart high-efficiency industrial farms.\n\nEven with the peasant loans and mechanisation programmes, it seems like Russian agriculture has lost many of its most productive farms. Minister of Agriculture Agyeyev is optimistic and promises higher yields by 1941 once mechanisation programmes have advanced enough. He does admit that Minister Voznesensky's worry is real, and it is possible that the price of grain will increase temporarily in the coming years.\n\nVoznesensky suggests that we implement price caps and organise state corporations to buy and distribute food in a centralised manner, forcing peasants to organise sales through it. Agyeyev is worried about the backlash and is instead requesting more money for agrarian reforms, particularly in producing tractors and harvesters, which would increase output faster but at a cost."
 russia.299.a: "Voznesensky is right, as usual."
 russia.299.b: "Tractors for everyone, no matter the cost!"
 russia.299.c: "Stop worrying over nothing."

 ### Post-War Savinkov Events
 russia.300.t: "Veering Towards New War"
 russia.300.d: "Behind the closed gates of the Senate Palace, there was a rare moment of heated debate. Savinkov's cabinet, gathered in the Oval Hall, was starkly divided when the matter of continuation of the war against the socialist powers came up. The Vozhd had already instructed the military to start drawing plans for Operation Utrennyaya Zvezda, the Morning Star - an invasion of the Socialist Internationale, though the date for such an invasion was not yet set.\n\nAs Savinkov wished to know how soon such an operation could begin, Chairman-Minister Filonenko opposed the idea - carefully, but opposed it nonetheless. He argued that the Russian people are tired and much of Europe is in ruins, and that an invasion should be postponed into the foreseeable future. He was supported by Voznesensky and Baydalakov, who wished to focus on economic rebuilding.\n\nThis view was harshly opposed by Derental, who claimed such a mentality to be weakness. Klepikov was also among the pro-war faction, arguing that perhaps Filonenko and his allies were getting too soft, and someone else may be better suited for his position. Savinkov himself stopped the debate, admitting that some time is needed to rebuild, and that war plans can only move after the military considers itself ready."
 russia.300.a: "At least we won some time."

 russia.301.t: "Paranoia and Conspiracy"
 russia.301.d: "Some days after the cabinet debate, a discreet meeting by the 'moderates' of the party was held at Sergey Leykhtenbersky's dacha just outside of Moscow. The centre of the conspiracy was forming around Professor Mikhail Aleksandrovich Georgiyevsky, Baydalakov's colleague from the National-Solidarists, who was working at the Russian Academy of Sciences. Georgiyevsky had always been a strong-willed character, walking the tightrope between criticising Savinkov but agreeing with his goals. Present with him were Ministers Maksimilian Filonenko and Viktor Baydalakov, as well as SZRS Duma members Nikolay Vakar and Vladimir Samarin. It was clear that Klepikov and the secret police would know of this meeting, even if they had not bugged it.\n\nNonetheless, they held quite the conspiratorial event; they understood that Klepikov's and Savinkov's system of terror was not ceasing despite the war being over; quite the contrary, as it was expanding under the guise of fighting separatism. It seemed like it would only be a matter of time until these more moderate figures were targeted, especially after Klepikov's remarks in the last cabinet meeting.\n\nBut what could be done? Russia was a police state par excellence. Vakar suggested that they prepare to flee the country, but it was Baydalakov who suggested a bold plan: Klepikov must be eliminated or disgraced. He was the single most toxic voice whispering to the President's ear, and he was in control of Russia's vast machinery of violence and terror."
 russia.301.a: "We need to be careful."

 russia.303.t: "The Conspiracy Unravels"
 russia.303.d1: "It is over. Like with any conspiracy, time is its worst enemy. We do not know who talked - if it was a betrayal or merely chance - but today, red-capped agents of the Gosstrazha Security Battalion arrested the majority of those involved in the conspiracy against Klepikov. The less important members of the group simply disappeared after the arrests, but the members of higher standing, namely Filonenko, Baydalakov, and Georgiyevsky, were dragged out of prison after some weeks for a highly publicised trial.\n\nIn private, Savinkov was disappointed to see an Old Svobodnik like Filonenko scheming behind his back, but ordered his execution nonetheless. On trial, the conspirators were accused of defeatism, anti-state behaviour, and conspiracy against the Russian people. They were shot soon after, and it was made clear to everyone that scheming inside the party was not tolerated."
 russia.303.d2: "Flegont Firsovich Klepikov is a shadow - insanely paranoid and nigh-impossible to track. But even he has his weaknesses. Filonenko, thanks to his personal friendship with Savinkov, learned of the next time when the Vozhd's inner circle would be invited to his dacha in one of their informal gatherings. With this information, an ambush was arranged with the support of loyalists from the army.\n\nIn the rural country roads of Russia, the chief of Okhrana and Gosstrazha is far away from his organisations, only escorted by a handful of operatives. The first attempt failed due to an unexpected change of route, and the next time, Klepikov was nowhere to be found.\n\nThe next day, a series of surprise arrests were made - no doubt based on someone in the conspiracy either ratting on them, or breaking down under interrogation. Men from the Gosstrazha and Okhrana broke into the apartments of over a dozen conspirators. The less important members of the group simply disappeared after the arrests, but the members of higher standing, namely Filonenko, Baydalakov, and Georgiyevsky, were dragged out of prison after some weeks for a highly publicised trial.\n\nIn private, Savinkov was disappointed to see an Old Svobodnik like Filonenko scheming behind his back, but ordered his execution nonetheless. On trial, the conspirators were accused of defeatism, anti-state behaviour, and conspiracy against the Russian people. They were shot soon after, and it was made clear to everyone that scheming inside the party was not tolerated."
 russia.303.a: "Death is an old friend."

 russia.304.t: "Slaying the Shadow of Savinkov"
 russia.304.d: "Flegont Firsovich Klepikov is a shadow - insanely paranoid and nigh-impossible to track. But even he has his weaknesses. Filonenko, thanks to his personal friendship with Savinkov, learned of the next time when the Vozhd's inner circle would be invited to his dacha in one of their informal gatherings. With this information, an ambush was arranged with the support of loyalists from the army.\n\nIn the rural country roads of Russia, the chief of Okhrana and Gosstrazha is far away from his organisations, only escorted by a handful of operatives. The first attempt failed due to an unexpected change of route, but the next time, a land mine blew up the front tyres of Klepikov's armoured black Buick. Klepikov survived it, and his operatives opened fire from the windows of the car. A frantic shoot-out only ended as multiple anti-tank grenades were lobbed into the car, and hardly anything was left of Klepikov to bury.\n\nSavinkov was not a man of emotion, but it was clear that he was distraught when he heard of this terrorist attack on Klepikov. He spent the weekend drinking, while the government went through the motions of starting a 'hunt' for the terrorists under the Deputy Head of the Okhrana, Ivan Nikitich Kononov."
 russia.304.a: "Violent lives meet violent ends."

 russia.305.t: "The Palace Coup"
 russia.305.d: "It must be said that the departure of Klepikov was welcomed by many even in the Kremlin. Surprisingly, Karol Vendzyagolsky, another one of Savinkov's closest men, admitted being in favour of peace, at least for now, and promised to support Filonenko in his attempts to persuade Savinkov. The Vozhd himself had grown even more aloof and paranoid after the assassination of Klepikov, and only rarely appeared in public, preferring to kill himself slowly with alcohol. Now, in practice, power is concentrated in the hands of the cabinet.\n\nAfter some persuasion, Savinkov was talked into replacing a number of ministers and other key personnel. Most importantly, Viktor Baydalakov was made the Minister of Interior Affairs, and thus the police minister. A number of other moderates gained positions, such as Alisa Berkova, who was appointed as the Minister of Culture. All this was based on a power-sharing agreement between the Chairman-Minister Filonenko and Party Secretary Vendzyagolsky, both men pushing through their own favourites at the expense of the likes of Derental, Savistsky and Maysky."
 russia.305.a: "A new page in history of the regime."

 russia.306.t: "Relaxation of the Economy"
 russia.306.d: "The nationalisation policies of the Savinkov regime have always been controversial among the better-off backers of SZRS, and they have also come under fire by the Solidarists. It came as a major success to the 'Reformists' in the Party to persuade the Vozhd to accept an economic restructuring as proposed by Viktor Baydalakov. Debates do not happen in the dormant State Duma, but rather in the backrooms of the Kremlin where the main figures behind the government and Russia's economic life have been drawing plans and deals regarding Russia's future.\n\nThe main bulk of the ire has been directed at the VES and 'the corrupt bureaucrats'. While such a body was useful for centralised industrial development, it has been criticised for inefficient peacetime economic management and an overt focus on military industry. Obviously, the wolves circling around the VES are also looking at the vast sums of money and stock that VES controls, which would be distributed to private hands should it fall.\n\nHere lies a point of contention, though. The Party's financial backers, like Vtorov and Lebedev, obviously seek full privatisation, where 'patriotic capitalists' can buy state assets and continue running them under the direction of the Ministry of Industry and Trade. The Solidarist ideologues would prefer a system where a majority of state companies would become owned and managed by worker artels instead, essentially becoming cooperative businesses under the expert direction of the Ministry."
 russia.306.a: "Pursue genuine privatisation."
 russia.306.b: "Start building a cooperative economy."

 russia.307.t: "Fate of the Political Prisoners?"
 russia.307.d: "During the past years, a great network of prisoner camps was built under the watch of Klepikov's Gosstrazha. Many of the people imprisoned undoubtedly deserved their punishments - there were people who had courted with the enemies of Russia, those who still spread Bolshevik propaganda, those who scorned the traditions of the Church - but now that the Great Patriotic War is over, we can afford to be more gracious.\n\nThe more practical reason to selectively pardon prisoners and downscale the prison system is because it is rather expensive, and, quite frankly, one could call it pointless. Many prison camps are not economically viable at all. However, the relaxation of this would be destabilising in the short term, as it would make us look weaker. Still, proponents of the relaxation argue that it would help us to ensure long-term stability and economic viability."
 russia.307.a: "Let us do it."
 russia.307.b: "But these people were imprisoned for a REASON!"

 russia.308.t: "The Vozhd's Complaints"
 russia.308.d: "The relationship between Filonenko's government and the Vozhd has never been warm, as the Solidarist programme has made significant downscalings to some of the earlier programmes of the Savinkov regime. Savinkov himself still views that this is merely preparation for the Last War, but has generally not stopped us from implementing our agendas. It is joked that half of Filonenko's time is spent in assuring and lobbying the Vozhd rather than actually running the affairs of the state. But it is exactly these personal friendships that have enabled such a drastic change of direction for the regime, as ultimately the man who has Savinkov's trust can do as he pleases.\n\nBut Boris Viktorovich is also proud and rather petty, and has started to oppose Solidarist programmes more on the grounds that they weaken the Russian nation and make us look sheepish and less prepared for the great war with the Reds. He has fully ignored his cabinet on many occasions, and instead has started to appoint his own favourites in new governorships and other positions. While not obviously obstructionist, this arbitrary behaviour feels as if the Vozhd is reminding us: we only govern because he allows it."
 russia.308.a: "Let us hope it is left at that."

 russia.309.t: "The Vozhd's Change of Heart"
 russia.309.d: "As the Vozhd has been more isolated from his more radical advisors, he has focused more on his literary and spiritual pursuits. His new collection of poems, 'The Morning Star', has been a best-seller (as all of Savinkov's books) and it has reverted to themes more similar to his works from 1908-1914, with more Christian themes dealing with redemption and spiritual doubt.\n\nThe collection was co-written by Zinaida Gippius, widow of the late Dmitry Merezhkovsky, whose death Savinkov cited as a great moment of clarity to him, which got him to ponder his and all of Russia's destiny further. It seems like Savinkov has given up on the idea of a great last apocalyptic battle, at least for now, and instead has started to speak of Russia's great role as the spiritual guide of the world, as a protector and not a destroyer."
 russia.309.a: "Curious."

 russia.310.t: "Foundation of the Holy League"
 russia.310.d: "Officially the 'Treaty of Protection and Friendship', dubbed 'The Holy League' by Russian propaganda, has had its foundational conference in Moscow today. In the meeting, Foreign Minister Mikhail Georgiyevsky and Vozhd Boris Savinkov both spoke of the importance of the free peoples of the world to stand together against the red menace threatening all that is holy and good in the world.\n\nThey harkened back to Russia's imperial rhetoric, of Russia as the great guardsman of the world, tasked with the burden of defending the common man against the revolution and tyranny. All states threatened by international communism will be free to join this great alliance of peoples."
 russia.310.a: "The red tide will fall."

 russia.311.t: "A New, Old Enemy"
 russia.311.d: "As Russian tanks drove through the Brandenburg Gate, our great Germanic enemy ceased to be a threat, and immediately we looked at the West, to precious Paris still the hostage of godless communists. Swiftly, the propaganda changed. Propaganda against Germany all but disappeared - after all, have we not saved their souls? In the final battle between Faith and Emptiness, all spiritual peoples must oppose the People-Beast of Communism together.\n\nWith this change of propaganda, a new, even more intense hunt for socialists began, now encompassing all of Europe in our control. Many old grievances have been dug up, and those suspected of being agents of the Antichrist's Internationale are shown no mercy. Separatist groups in Recovered Territories, many Jewish organisations, so-called social democrats in occupied lands, even those in the ranks of the SZRS who have been too cosy with unorthodox beliefs - all will be crushed by the ever-present informants of the Okhrana and the red-caps of the Gosstrazha."
 russia.311.a: "There is no morality when the fate of the world is at stake."

 russia.312.t: "The Robbing of Europe"
 russia.312.d: "The Brest-Litovsk Treaty severed the Russian Empire out of a third of its population and agricultural land, half of its industry, and even six billion marks as reparations on top. Has there ever been a peace as draconic and tyrannical dictated between Great Powers in modern times? Only German imperialists could devise something more befitting of Attila the Hun than a cultured European society that Germany claims to be.\n\nThus, it is not harsh - in fact, it is purely fair - that we ravish Germany like the Romans of old treated their vanquished states. Every mark we paid to Germany will be taken back, with interest counted in blood spent in retaking it."
 russia.312.a: "Justice, at last."

 russia.313.t: "Call for the Last War"
 russia.313.d: "Russia has won its greatest victory in history, led to great destiny by its Vozhd - but to Savinkov, it was merely the first, mandatory step. His victory speech to the party cadres was almost nonsensical, long and rambling. In it, he explained how the Germanic civilisation, while mortal enemy of the Slavic kind, was not the final enemy.\n\nThe last battle, the true battle, is for the human soul. On the other side, there is the soul-destroying materialism of the communists, one that seeks to extinguish the human spirit and turn it into a great machine. And on the other side there is Faith, Freedom and Fate, three stars the Vozhd has been following all of his life. This victory against the Germans should not turn the Russian people complacent and peace-loving: no; now that they have drawn blood, they will draw blood until the final victory over materialism is achieved, the battle that Russians have been waging for decades now.\n\nThere was nervous applause. It must be said that only the most fervent Svobodniks truly welcomed this declaration, and most hoped it is merely rhetoric - surely the Vozhd does not plan to start another great war so quickly?"
 russia.313.a: "When will it end?"

 russia.314.t: "Liberation of the West"
 russia.314.d.rus: "'The great victory tastes like ashes in my mouth when it is shared with those who idolise the torturers of Russia, those Lenins and Trotskys. For their crime is greater than ours, who kill for a just cause. Their crime is against faith itself, an attempt to strangle the very human nature. Thus we, the Russians, will fight them to the end, as God laid down this duty to us in 1917 as the only people capable of saving the world, even if it needs to be through the means of the Apocalypse. Let it be known there will be no pacts with the red emperors of the west, no peace until only one prevails, Faith or Darkness.'\n\nThis widely broadcasted speech by the Vozhd was heard by millions, and it for sure destroyed any hopes of more moderate party members to maintain a watchful peace. Naturally, it has electrified the West, with socialist powers fully aware of this threat of war. Privately, it seems that Savinkov has started to behave more and more erratic, as if he is suffering from a crisis of purpose after the victorious war, and is compensating for it through falling deeper in his religious visions of grandeur and paranoia."
 russia.314.d.soc: "In a speech by the Vozhd of Russia, Boris Savinkov, he more or less declared his intent to start war with the socialist bloc in the future.\n\n'The great victory tastes like ashes in my mouth when it is shared with those who idolise the torturers of Russia, those Lenins and Trotskys. For their crime is greater than ours, who kill for a just cause. Their crime is against faith itself, an attempt to strangle the very human nature. Thus we, the Russians, will fight them to the end, as God laid down this duty to us in 1917 as the only people capable of saving the world, even if it needs to be through means of the Apocalypse. Let it be known there will be no pacts with the red emperors of the west, no peace until only one prevails, Faith or Darkness.'\n\nThis widely broadcasted speech by the Vozhd was heard by millions, and it for sure destroyed any hopes of more moderate SZRS party members to maintain a watchful peace."
 russia.314.a: "This is... inspirational."
 russia.314.b: "This is... insane."

 russia.315.t: "Heiress of the Great Khans"
 russia.315.d: "Chairman-Minister Pyotr Savitsky's speech at the Party conference outlined the new principles of Russian foreign and cultural policies. Now that the Germanic enemy has been demolished, there is some disagreement over the future direction, and Savitsky decisively argued that Russia, as she currently exists, cannot compete with the industrialist-maritime socialist world successfully without consolidating and exploiting its great Eurasian wealth and strategic location.\n\nIt is already well-known how much Savitsky and his Ideocrat faction adore 'Mongolism' and the constant centralisation of power. Under Savitsky's watch, the state bureaucracy has grown greatly in power, subsuming more and more of society under Savinkov's and Savitsky's absolute control. Dissent in the Party is almost unheard of, and disagreements between the Vozhd and his second-in-command have been kept in private.\n\nSavitsky's future promises include vast development programmes for Russia's vast steppes, a diplomatic outreach to unite the Eurasian countries against socialism, and the further strengthening of Russia against her enemies."
 russia.315.a: "Dawn of the Heroic Civilisation!"

 russia.316.t: "Economy of Dialectical Statism"
 russia.316.d: "The economic theory of the Ideocrats is described as 'public-private', harmonious cooperation between the private and state economy. Unlike communist mechanical statism, we strive for a healthy system where the state can use its resources to solve large-scale problems, while the private sector will be at its most efficient in the management of everyday affairs. However, to combat destructive competition and inefficiency, mandatory syndicalisation must be implemented across fields of the consumer economy, to form great business syndicates combining entire sectors into simple corporations.\n\nThis is largely the direction our regime already embarked upon through the reforms of Aleksandr Voznesensky, and the planning system has been expanding ever since. With a slew of new reforms further centralising the economy, many wealthy backers of the regime have started to worry even more, and even questioned if the government truly respects private property. It would be safer to keep them on our side and continue the earlier policy of favouring certain 'patriotic businessmen', even if it will make our economic reforms slightly less effective."
 russia.316.a: "They have served us well thus far."
 russia.316.b: "The state is above all."

 russia.317.t: "The Right Hand of the State"
 russia.317.d: "The Vozhd and the Orthodox Church have had their differences, but ultimately these are questions of practical matters, not of ideology. Despite his own strange form of Christianity, the vast majority of the Russian people are Orthodox faithful, and Pyotr Savitsky has been willing to actually start a more lenient policy towards the church. He has freed many Orthodox clergy imprisoned for protesting against the regime - though this comes at a price. Little by little, the Church has lost its lands, schools, hospitals and become a mere extension of the SZRS' bureaucracy, staffed by loyalist priests and praying for the health of the Vozhd.\n\nThe Eurasian movement is not hostile towards Islam, either, even though this is a more controversial matter. Savitsky himself has always argued that the Turkic peoples of Russia are integral to the nature of Eurasian martial and heroic culture, and that Muslims believe in the same creator as Christians - both united against godless materialism preached by the communists. Religious themes have become ever-more important in propaganda against the socialist West."
 russia.317.a: "May God give us strength in our struggle."

 russia.318.t: "Expansion of the Camp System"
 russia.318.d: "The system of Rasolkos, or Worker-Soldier Colonies, initially began during the Voskhod Programme, and many of these RASOLKO camps would become permanent. For a long time, they were haphazardly maintained by the Gosstrazha without a greater economic plan, working on what seemed most useful at the moment. But this force of labour could be far more effective at colonising and exploiting the great wilderness of Siberia.\n\nUnder the new Genera-Commissar of RASOLKO, General Vsevolod Nikanorovich Ivanov, the system is being greatly standardised, forming an archipelago of these worker colonies across the great steppe and the tundra. A handful of new arrests have been made as more and more potential traitorous plots are uncovered, providing the colonies with ample workforces of men desperate to prove their loyalty to Russia."
 russia.318.a: "They will earn their freedom eventually."

 russia.319.t: "Engulfed in the Machine"
 russia.319.d: "Savinkov never shared the Ideocrats' interest in building bureaucratic systems. Even though the Vozhd remains the centre of this vast network of instruments of control and violence, there is a growing feeling that the bureaucracy is running itself; that the machine has become self-aware, and is simply too vast for a single man to monitor or control. Savitsky has been working tirelessly in establishing new systems, standardising and rationalising, ensuring that what Savinkov built will last, but some feel as if the regime has also lost its heroic dynamism, as if the Knights of Terror intended to stand above the sheep have become sheep themselves.\n\nEven though the Vozhd has been feeling increasingly alienated and not necessary for the operation of the regime, perhaps it is not for the worse. Yes, he could command anything to happen, but then again: if Boris Viktorovich finally has the time to finish his books, to enjoy countless days of substance-fuelled hedonism, to finally look into the true meanings of things instead of being busy managing governance... perhaps it is what a great Russian hero like the Vozhd deserves."
 russia.319.a: "It is true."
 russia.319.b: "But someone else might get it wrong."

 russia.320.t: "Militarisation of the Party"
 russia.320.d: "Already during the Great Patriotic War, the SZRS acquired more and more militaristic flavours. It has already been a movement of soldiers, idolising the cult of the warrior, but as the war went on, soldiers gained ever more sway in Savinkov's war cabinet. Two chief advisors who emerged from the war are Viktor Larionov and Yury Shirinsky-Shikhmatov - both are deeply ideological followers of National Narodism, and military men. Shirinsky-Shikhmatov's clique's influence is best seen in sidelining many civilian advisors to the Vozhd, like Boris Moiseyenko and Ivan Maysky.\n\nThe Vozhd is largely convinced of the arguments presented by Larionov and Shikhmatov - that there is no chance for the regime to 'demilitarise' until the final victory - the defeat of World Communism - has been achieved. Until then, the Party and the State must be run like an army - an army of true believers, marching to the last dawn."
 russia.320.a: "Once more into the fray!"
 russia.320.b: "They have done nothing but service to the Motherland."

 russia.321.t: "Operation Arkhangel"
 russia.321.d: "For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the Archangel, and with the trumpet of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first. (1 Thessalonians 4:16)\n\nWith those words began the declaration of war - not to any state in particular, but to the very idea, the idea of soul-crushing materialism, strangling the spiritual existence of humanity. This Materialism is incarnated in the Socialist System - a form of government truly horrendous, one that claims that Man is a mere biological, material machine - one that works, eats and dies, with no greater spiritual significance, no higher purpose, no fate. It only leads to turning human beings into cogs in the machine - or into cattle, butchered by the Cheka officers.\n\nNo more! Armies of Russia and all the free peoples have declared a crusade; the last march, one that will bring upon the promised new age of enlightenment and peace. Only after total destruction of socialism may we sheathe our swords again."
 russia.321.a: "Like Archangel Mikhail we ride."

 russia.322.t: "The Morning Star"
 russia.322.d: "The great mushroom cloud rises above the soaring hot Kyrgyz Steppe. The research group and the military men observing the test stand breathless, trying to see the implications of their success. Director Igor Tamm, euphoric at the success, is surrounded by congratulators. But the man who feels the most enlightened is the Vozhd in a separate bunker, merely staring at the cloud as if stricken by some great realisation.\n\nIt is those moments where one clearly - criminally clearly - understands the terrifying meaning of modernity. In that moment, Boris Savinkov is a witness and a willing participant in the Apocalypse rising over the flat Eurasian horizon. How can one not return to the Book of Revelations on such a moment, of such great technological epiphany?\n\n'And there went out another horse that was red: and power was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth, and that they should kill one another: and there was given unto him a great sword.'"
 russia.322.a: "The path of blood and death."

 russia.323.t: "The Sword of Thorns"
 russia.323.d: "As part of our post-war reforms, Russia is slowly turning into a new creature - a constitutionally defined one-party regime, governing with courts and not with terror. As perhaps the most symbolic change, the nation is officially recognised as the Russian National Republic - asserting us as the healthy continuation of the republic founded in the February Revolution.\n\nWith it, there has been a proposal to change the national flag as well, relegating the Sword of Thorns into the Presidential Flag and the Coat of Arms, but not in the National Flag itself. It seems like the Vozhd himself is willing to accept this as recognition of Third Russia's universal nature as the final form of Russia, but it is obvious that many in the Party dislike the idea of reverting the flag."
 russia.323.a: "Men have fought and died under the Sword of Thorns."
 russia.323.b: "Restore the plain tricolour."

 russia.404.d: "The short period of the post-Russian Civil War recovery was cut short by the global economic depression of 1925, and the only place we could go for credit was the old enemy in Berlin. In 1926, a Faustian bargain was struck with Germany in the shape of the 'German-Russian Trade and Credit Agreement'. The price? Golden shackles by Rheinmetall. The Russian economy grew, yes, but it grew unfairly, unequally, and ultimately turned both the left and the right against the liberal idealism of the republic.\n\nOn the 11th of April 1936, the treaty would've needed to be renewed again for it to remain in power. It was not. While Germany has been offering to renew it, fearful of massive economic disruption, we remain steadfast. The Russian interest rate has soared overnight, but we have also been able to trigger tariffs and additional taxes against businesses from Mitteleuropa, and have gained the legal basis to start demolishing the German economic shackles around Russia."
 russia.404.d2: "The short period of the Russian recovery in the early 1920s was cut short by the global economic depression of 1925, and the only place Russia could go for credit was their old enemy -us. In 1926, a promising bargain was struck in the shape of the 'German-Russian Trade and Credit Agreement'. The Russian economy grew, yes, but it grew unfairly, unequally, and ultimately turned both the left and the right against the liberal idealism of the republic.\n\nOn the 11th of April 1936, the treaty would've needed to be renewed again for it to remain in power. It was not. While we have been offering to renew it, fearful of massive economic disruption, the Russians remain steadfast.

 russia.404.a: "They will pay for this!"
 russia.404.b: "The first step towards liberty!"

 russia.405.t: "Russia Free of German Influence"
 russia.405.d: "At long last, [Root.GetNameDef] is free of German influence. For all of modern Russian history, our industry and natural resources have been subjects to foreign interests, be they French, British, American or German - but with extensive restructuring of our economy, this is no longer the case. Factories and railroads built with foreign cash are now entirely in Russian hands, and they will remain so."
 russia.405.a: "Never again subjugated!"

 russia.407.t: "The Business Elite Flee"
 russia.407.d: "Russia has always had a minority of urban-dwelling German experts already from the days of Yekaterina the Great, and their number has only grown in the 1920s as many German or Austrian industrial conglomerates moved their engineers and other technical experts to oversee their factory-building in places like Moscow, Petrograd, or Yekaterinburg. This did bring Russia sorely needed expertise that was also utilised in projects such as the ELRO electrification program.\n\nAs expected, many of these people are now fleeing Russia as the factories operated by them are being nationalised or put into the hands of Russian companies. While some of the experts have offered to continue working under new management, the majority of them have fled Russia, fearing anti-German sentiment and violence."
 russia.407.a: "Good riddance!"
 russia.407.b: "Try to hire them with better wages."

 russia.408.t: "Influx of Expertise from Russia"
 russia.408.d: "Russia has always had a minority of urban-dwelling German experts already from the days of Yekaterina the Great, and their number has only grown in the 1920s as many German or Austrian industrial conglomerates moved their engineers and other technical experts to oversee their factory-building in places like Moscow, Petrograd, or Yekaterinburg.\n\nMany of these people are now fleeing Russia, as the factories they were managing are being nationalised or put into the hands of Russian companies. While some have stayed behind in service of the Russians, most have fled, fearing anti-German sentiment and violence."
 russia.408.a: "Well, they can help Russia now."

 russia.409.t: "The New Rich"
 russia.409.d: "Foreign companies owned plenty of industrial complexes, real estate, land, forests and so on in Russia. As they are being put into Russian hands, there is a spot for good entrepreneurial spirit!\n\nSome Russians, called 'Chernoman' after the Black Monday (Cherny Ponedelnik) have managed to gain a lot of these assets - often people from already wealthy backgrounds, but there are also some rags-to-riches stories - those who have become the nouveaux riches of Russia: new money, with cars and fancy houses, following the latest fashion fads of New York and Vienna."
 russia.409.a: "Admirable entrepreneurship!"
 russia.409.b: "Those profits belong to the people, not individuals."

 russia.410.t: "State Corporation Dividends"
 russia.410.d: "The nationalisation of foreign companies has had its benefits. Because the state has acquired so many of these, the national budget is doing well overall.\n\nThis is not only good for us, but it's proof that the Russian economy can hold its own without the influence of predatory German business."
 russia.410.a: "Business is booming."

 russia.411.t: "Supply Chain Issues"
 russia.411.d: "You cannot remove one part of an economic system without affecting all other parts. As an example, German textile dyeing plants of Moscow, operated by BASF, used Central Asian cotton and synthetic dyes imported from their factories in the Rhineland. Now, if severed from BASF's control, supply of dyes collapses, and production of dyed clothing in Moscow becomes far less profitable. The problem becomes even more pronounced if the lacking resources are, say, German steel or rare earth minerals.\n\nFixing these issues takes time and requires some retooling of the industry, but ultimately it merely slows us down. People of Moscow simply have to survive with less colourful clothing!"
 russia.411.a: "Can't do much."
 russia.411.b: "Try to import them at a loss."

 russia.412.t: "Offer from the German Businessmen"
 russia.412.d: "A number of German businesses have made an offer to the Russian government. They are saying that they can make a major contribution to the Russian economy as long as they are not hit with the same nationalisations that other companies have faced.\n\nOf course, they do not really have Russia's best interests at heart, but perhaps there is still something to be made out of this?"
 russia.412.a: "Mutually beneficial arrangement, you say?"
 russia.412.b: "Take your money and go..."
 russia.412.c: "... or the secret police will see you out."

 russia.413.t: "Foreign Expertise Flees"
 russia.413.d: "As fear over nationalisation looms ever stronger over foreign capitalists in Russia, they have been fleeing in droves. At the same time, the German government has been offering significant benefits for companies who relocate everything out of Russia, including many skilled workers like engineers.\n\nThis will hurt us in the short term, but in the long term, it is what we have been aiming for anyway."
 russia.413.a: "And don't come back!"

 russia.414.t: "The Southern Coal & Steel Association"
 russia.414.d: "The Southern Coal & Steel Association can be called many things - powerful, profitable, and deeply paranoid. Incredibly rich in the most potent grade of anthracite coal, the Donbas not only exports its 'black gold' across Europe, but also uses it to fuel the countless steelworks which have risen up between the slag heaps and mine tailings. This vast wealth, paired with the region's distance from Moscow and very diverse membership, has also given the Association a wide independence streak which has outlived its birth under the Russian Empire. Thanks to having much experience dealing with [202.GetName], its board quickly earned a spot in the Union of Industry, Trade, Finance and Agriculture (Protofis).\n\nNow, the Russian government has passed the Energy Autarky Law forcing the Association to either ensure Russian government-owned majority or face the possibility of its operation on the Russian side of the border being nationalised. What this means for the Donbas is major disruption and even lay-offs - after all, we cannot give the Russian government any control over our energy sector, the same argument that Moscow is using to justify the move."
 russia.414.a: "Seek compensation from Moscow and withdraw from the Association."
 russia.414.b: "Pass a similar law and ensure Ukrainian state ownership of this coal."

 russia.415.t: "German Capital Withdrawal"
 russia.415.d: "German companies have withdrawn many valuable assets from Russia while it's still possible. Many of these industries are now re-establishing themselves in German-aligned states, like Ukraine and Belarus.\n\nWhile their machinery was left behind the border, they do give us capital and expertise that will benefit our own economy."

 russia.416.d.grain: "Seeking to hurt our agriculture and enrage our peasants, Germany has enacted an embargo on Russian agricultural exports. In the short term, this will likely lead to loss of profits and increased unrest."
 russia.416.d.energy: "Being one of the most natural resource-rich countries in Europe, Russia naturally exports a significant amount of oil and coal to Mitteleuropa.\n\nToday, this has changed with a German embargo on the Russian energy sector - which will hurt us both, but will likely hurt us more."
 russia.416.d.tariff_wall: "In their impudence, Germany has enacted a tariff wall against Russian goods. This will certainly hurt our exports for some time."

 russia.417.d: "Since the German embargo on Russian forestry exports, our own paper industry has boomed as a result.\n\nLack of Russian lumber and paper has led to shortages and rising prices, and especially in Central Europe, companies are seeking to find new markets - bringing them to us."
 russia.417.a: "Excellent!"

 russia.418.t: "The Grain Exports Rise!"
 russia.418.d: "Since the German embargo on Russian agricultural exports, our own agricultural industry has boomed as a result.\n\nRussia has been a major grain exporter and our competitor, but recent hindrances to their exports have led to an increase in food prices across Central Europe - and higher profits for our agricultural producers."
 russia.418.a: "Excellent!"

 russia.419.t: "Oil Exports Bring Profits!"
 russia.419.d: "Since the German embargo on Russian oil, our own oil industry has boomed as a result. Even without Baku, Russia has had a significant amount of oil production in the Northern Caucasus and the Caspian region, which gave German owners great dividends in the 1920s.\n\nBut after Russia nationalised these deposits, they have been sanctioned by Mitteleuropa, leading to rising prices for crude oil."
 russia.419.a: "Excellent"

 russia.420.t: "Russo-German Trade War Disrupts Our Economy"
 russia.420.d: "With Russia and Germany enacting tariffs against each other and trying to strangle each other out of the market, our economy has suffered as a result.\n\nEven though we would prefer to remain neutral, this large-scale economic disruption is impossible to avoid as numerous companies are tied to German or Russian markets."
 russia.420.a: "Can't they just get along?"

 russia.421.t: "Germany Buys up Roubles"
 russia.421.d: "The Reichspakt has bought up roubles and is holding them up in the Reichsbank's vaults. This is an expensive trick for them, one they can afford through a strong Mark and funds freed after much German capital has fled Russia.\n\nIn response we may need to have the Russian State Bank print more for domestic circulation, but this would drive up inflation."

 russia.421.b: "Counteract this by printing more!"

 russia.422.t: "Germany Dumps Russian State Bonds"
 russia.422.d: "Germany has put Russian debt bonds on sale for basically nothing, plummeting trust in our ability to service our debts. This is a mere political trick, but it does not seem to give much confidence to foreign banks and investors.\n\nInterest rates have soared - maybe we should just ignore them and default on our German debt?"
 russia.422.a: "They will regret this."

 russia.423.t: "Germany Requests We Sanction Russia"
 russia.423.d: "Germany and Russia are in the middle of a trade war. The Germans have come to us asking to take their side and sanction Russia; they argue that since Germany is likely the best bet for the Entente powers to return home in the case of a war with the Internationale, then keeping Russia, another potential enemy of Germany, should be kept down as well."
 russia.423.a: "Sounds reasonable."
 russia.423.b: "Who are they to dictate our trade partners?"

 russia.425.c: "Understood."

 russia.426.t: "Nationaisation of the Sakhalin Oil"
 russia.426.d: "Japanese presence in North Sakhalin is based on two treaties - Treaty of Portsmouth of 1905, and Russo-Japanese Agreement of 1921. The latter, negotiated by Vasily Boldyrev, then attache to Japan, agreed on Japanese withdrawal from North Sakhalin and other occupied territories and them withdrawing support from Siberian Rebel Atamans Semyonov and Kalmykov. In exchange, Japanese zaibatsus operating in Russia would be allowed to conduct business freely. What had for a moment seemed like potential military clash between Japan and resurgent Russia in 1921 was succesfully de-escalated.\n\nKita Karafuto Sekiyu Kabushiki Gaisha (North Sakhalin Joint Stock Company) continued management of oil fields in Okha and Katangli, which brought both development to northern part of the island. It was also clear that the company prioritised Japanese strategic interests over Russian ones, and there was even discussion on nationalisation already in 1928, in aftermath of Fengtian Conflict. But now Russia has abandoned any sembalance of respecting their treaties, and have gone ahead with the nationalisation plans."

 russia.441.t: "Cossack Privileges and Their Hosts"
 russia.441.d.intro: "The Russian Cossacks roam the southern and eastern extremes of Russia, descending from military settlers of the steppe regions - unique in culture but undoubtedly Russian. Their Hosts were given official, autonomous status by the 1922 Constitution as a reward for their heroic efforts in the Civil War. Even though the Cossacks do not form ethnic majorities anywhere else outside their own stanitsa villages, they generally own most land in the Hosts, and through political power and education access, form a privileged class compared to the common Russian tenant farmers and city dwellers. In exchange, the Cossacks serve in the army under their Host Ataman, often being the first ones to be sent to quell regional unrest, be it in the North Caucasus, Turkestan, or general civil unrest."
 russia.441.d.szrs: "$russia.441.d.intro$\n\nIn practice, the Cossacks are our enemy. They are great landowners, enjoying unjustified privileges over the common Russian peasants living on Host land. Yes, we honour Cossacks for their martial ability - but is this not the duty of every patriotic Russian? A man should not be rewarded for merely doing what is expected of everyone - and thus, many in the Party wish to greatly reduce the Cossack's autonomies - and naturally redistribute their land to the loyal Russian peasantry, just as able and patriotic as the Cossacks."
 russia.441.d.wrangel: "$russia.441.d.intro$\n\nMany of the best and brightest Russian commanders have either Cossack roots or have commanded Cossack forces. It is beyond doubt that the Cossack tradition represents the still-surviving chivalry and courage of the Russian soldier. Of course, there are some social issues with the implementation of the Cossack Hosts, but ultimately the government should maintain this system."
 russia.441.d.dem: "$russia.441.d.intro$\n\nTo many, the Cossacks represent a remnant of the old aristocratic-militarist Imperial era, the Garrison State under Nikolay I. Others view Cossackdom as an integral part of Russia, a regional identity that must be supported. Despite any political or social questions, it must be admitted that Cossacks serve as a useful quick-to-deploy force against domestic unrest... which may be useful to any regime, regardless of our idealism."

 ### Western March events ###
 russia.442.t: "The First Goal"
 russia.442.desc1: "After nearly two decades of humiliation for Russia, we will soon be ready to end the German hegemony. War is inevitable, and it's a matter of time when it will start - the main question is who will get the upper hand by attacking the opposing side. The Stavka already started drawing plans for Operation Yekaterina in 1934 on the orders of President Savinkov, and have continued preparing them under [RUS_GetArmyChief]'s direction. A number of possible plans have been presented to [RUS.GetLeader] for final approval. But first, we must figure out the specifics, the most pressing of which is the initial target of the strike.\n\nGeneral Slashchyov, with the support of General-Fieldmarshal Markov and other 'Black Epaulettes', suggests striking deep into Ukraine, which has formidable armed forces, but one factor makes it an attractive target: its geography. Our armour and cavalry can outmanoeuvre the enemy in the plains of Eastern Ukraine in a great battle of encirclement, and if the plan succeeds we may be able to threaten [202.GetName] and link up with potential allies in the Balkans.\n\nGenerals close to Denikin, such as General Golovin, suggest a more direct approach: a heavy strike into [WHR.GetName]. The Dniepr-Daugava Line may be a difficult one to break, advocates of this plan acknowledge, but if we gain the upper hand the benefits will be incredible, and we can quickly press into Germany proper, while cutting German forces into two separate fronts. Once [206.GetName] falls, we will be able to threaten Ukraine and the Baltics from the west and east and secure our flanks more thoroughly.\n\nFinally, there is the Baltic option. General Kutepov and Admiral [RUS_GetNavyChief] argue that an incursion into the Baltics will give us greater control of the Baltic Sea, allow us to threaten the German heartland more quickly, and defend Petrograd from any German incursions, bypassing much of the German Ostwall altogether."

 russia.443.d: "The Russian Army is offensive in spirit and will, but the methodology of the offensive can vary. The Russian Army's 'mechanisation lobby' - Markov, Slashchyov, Rodzyanko, Messner, and others - see a surgical armoured thrust as the obvious core of the offensive. Our mobile and air forces must be concentrated into a single force of unstoppable shock, capable of piercing through the enemy front and destroying the German armies in great battles of encirclement.\n\nHowever, this is a method we have no practical experience in. More careful planners such as Denikin, Khanzin, and Golovin represent the opposite view, which seeks a 'Neo-Suvorovian' approach. Yes, armour is important, but only as one tool among many. The main focus is on firepower and the destruction of enemy forces as a steady engine of destruction, with trusted methods applied to modern arms."

While there remain gaps between our forces and Berlin, it's clear as day that it's only a matter of time when we will reach the German capital and end their German hegemony once and for all.\n\nOur forces are ready and in high spirits; they await orders and want to crush the Prussian war machine."
 russia.445.a: "To Berlin!"

 russia.446.t: "War Games at Voronezh"
 russia.446.d: "We inherited a powerful mobile corps from the White Army, and even if there have been a lot of personnel reshuffles, the equipment and basic training are of good quality. As the reorganisation of the Russian Army is being finished, proper military exercises are needed to trial our new, revolutionary war machine.\n\nUnder the orders of the Commander of the Armed Forces, large-scale exercises were organised near Buturlinovsky and the river Osered in the Voronezh Region. The overall nature of the exercise is a combined arms offensive, planned by Tukhachevsky's staff but based on many of Aleksandr Svechin's concepts. It is largely untested in practice, but drawing from a large corpus of military-theoretical work by Svechin, and also influenced by British reformers like John Fuller. Many of the former émigré commanders are already well acquainted with French and British armoured forces, though this only helps so much - Tukhachevsky has been an opponent of the Fullerite 'small elite' form of warfare, and instead leans towards similar tactics of speed and shock, but on a far greater scale, akin to the 'operational art' of Svechin.\n\nThe exercises left much to be desired. Katukov's 3rd Mechanised Division and the 7th Motorised Division operated particularly well, and most issues came from poor coordination between the air force, armoured corps, and infantry. Artillery was especially understaffed, with too few officers for effective coordination of fire. The British military observers were polite, but were obviously not terribly impressed."
 russia.446.a: "Artillery needs to be strengthened."

 russia.446.c: "Infantry must be able to follow the armour better."

 russia.447.t: "Sikorsky's Helicopter Experiment"
 russia.447.d: "Igor Ivanovich Sikorsky is one of the most successful Russian engineers of the interwar period. By the 1930s, he had become a rather wealthy businessman-engineer and was also involved in nationalist politics. His company, Aviation Machine-building Society of Sikorsky, is a major aviation designer and arguably the leader in global development of experimental 'vertolyots' ('spinning fliers'), the term introduced into Russian aeronautics by his right-hand man Nikolay Kamov. Sikorsky had already built the first experimental 'vertical takeoff apparatus' before the Great War, but it took a long time until any design was practical, and in practice, his company has focused on more typical planes for some time. Still, Sikorsky never gave up on the idea.\n\nNow, with subsidies from the Ministry of War, Sikorsky has completed the first test flight of the S-300, outdoing the earlier flight record of TsAGI's experimental 1932 attempt. Thanks to a number of new technical innovations, the S-300 seems to be useful for actual mass production and limited military use, making it the first actually functional military helicopter."

 ### Unrest in Caucasus ###
 russia.500.t: "Riots in Southern Russia"
 russia.500.d: "Chernov's assassination has whipped Moscow and Petrograd into a frenzy, but they are hardly the only cities in Russia facing unrest in the wake of the Chairman's untimely end. Rumours have spread like a firestorm across Southern Russia, whispering that Chernov's death is only the first step in a Svobodnik coup d'état. What began as factory strikes in cities like Rostov-on-Don, Yekaterinodar, and Stavropol, among others, have escalated dramatically in the past few days.\n\nStarted ostensibly as protests against the SZRS, the strikes have quickly drawn in other elements of the region's non-Cossack population. Referred to as 'inogorodniye' or 'outsiders', the non-Cossack Slavs now form upwards of half the population in the territories of the Don, Kuban, Terek, and Astrakhan Cossack Hosts. Despite this, inogorodniye are largely excluded from politics and owning land. They instead work in roles considered beneath the Cossacks' dignity as a military estate, such as factory workers, farmhands, or urban bourgeoisie. This discrimination has been justified on grounds that the Cossacks, like many Mountaineer peoples, are legally considered indigenous in the region, and their autonomy has been guaranteed under the federal constitution.\n\nNevertheless, this state of affairs has led to profound resentment among the inogorodniye, which rapidly led to the recent strikes devolving into bloody riots. The Cossack response has seen crowds harshly dispersed with cavalry charges and swinging whips. The inogorodniye have accused the Cossacks of police brutality, while the Cossacks have shot back that they only intervened when the mobs began targeting Cossack homes and families. Both groups have petitioned that the federal government recognise the legality of their actions."

 russia.501.d: "The Committee of Cossacks, Mountaineers, and Steppe Peoples has gathered in Yekaterinodar for its 7th Session since the group's founding in 1922. Ostensibly a meeting ground for the many different peoples who inhabit Southern Russia and the North Caucasus, the Committee has long held a reputation for elitism and patronage. This isn't terribly surprising, as many of its members are landowners and hereditary clan chiefs, who would have little to gain from dividing their estates. It thus came as a shock when the 7th Session ruled in favour of formally declaring its support for President Savinkov's land reform campaign.\n\nOnce the surprise had worn off, the caveat to that statement quickly came to light - this support was contingent on the reform keeping land within its respective ethnic group. While sure to disappoint the largely landless inogorodniye and groups like the Chechens and Ingush, the statement has nevertheless strengthened the hand of reformist factions among the Cossacks and Mountaineers. It is no secret that Savinkov admires the Cossacks and many of the Mountaineer peoples, but the relationship with the landowning elites of these groups has been decidedly more awkward from an ideological standpoint.\n\nNevertheless, the SZRS are not ones to look a gift horse in the mouth. The landowning elites' support remains necessary for maintaining order in the region, and the 7th Session has opened an avenue for drawing pro-SZRS factions closer to power. Small steps, but steps nonetheless."

 russia.502.t: "Assassination of Ibragim Chulikov"
 russia.502.d: "Grim news has arrived from the Caucasus. Ibragim Chulikov, a long-standing friend of Russia and a pillar of government support in Chechnya, has died after an attack by unknown assailants. Chulikov and a group of relatives stumbled into an ambush as they were returning from a hunting trip on the outskirts of the town of Starye Atagi. Struck by several rifle shots, Chulikov perished almost instantly. Though Chulikov's companions returned fire, none of the ambushers were captured, and any dead were carried off the field before they could be retrieved.\n\nThis is unwelcome news in Moscow, which has watched with concern as control over Chechnya and Ingushetia has weakened in past years. Chulikov was instrumental in liberating Chechnya from the unholy alliance of Bolsheviks and Uzun-Khadzhi's Caucasus Imamate during the Civil War. Since then, the Chulikov family have acted as vital intermediaries between the Russian government and local Chechens, crushing dissent but rewarding loyalty generously. With Ibragim's death, the Chulikovs have been fatally weakened. Other members of the broader Gendarganoy taip (clan) have already emerged to carve out pockets of influence, and many make no secret about their hostility to Russia. Policing the region will likely become substantially more difficult."
 russia.502.a: "That could lead to future problems."

 russia.503.t: "The Preaching of Ali Kayayev"
 russia.503.d: "Controversy has captured headlines in the Dagestani city of [GetVictoryPointName_3668]. Ali Kayayev, a noted Islamic jurist and sharia scholar, has broken his longstanding silence on political issues. In a sermon before his assembled students, Ali Kayayev decried the creeping autocracy of Savinkov's regime, demanding that Russians of all nations and creeds rise up to defend the 'freedoms of the February Revolution'. With the region already abuzz over the Manifesto of Resistance, an anti-Savinkovist pamphlet, Ali Kayayev's inflammatory words have further stoked tensions.\n\nA Lak from the ancient city of Gazikumukh, Ali Kayayev has spent most of his 58 years committed to the causes of democracy and education. Ali Kayayev cooperated with various ephemeral Caucasian governments during the Civil War, most controversially helping Bolshevik-aligned forces by condemning the pro-White Nazhmuddin Gotsinsky's claim to the title of Dagestani Imam. The end of the Civil War saw Ali Kayayev reconcile neither with the White-aligned Dagestanis under General Nukh-Bek Tarkovsky, nor with Gaydar Bammatov's exiled Medzhlis in Georgia. He instead returned to his original passions of education reform and ethnography, and the Russian government was largely content to leave him alone.\n\nAli Kayayev's change of heart has outraged local secular and religious authorities, who see Kayayev's latest sermon as a betrayal of the clemency they had granted him. Some demand his immediate arrest, while others urge caution. Students from many of Dagestan's Islamic schools - the madrasas - have walked out of classes with the blessing of their teachers to demonstrate in support of Ali Kayayev. A soft touch here may embolden similar disobedience, but a harsh response can just as easily cause tensions to boil over."

 russia.504.t: "Flames Spread to Dagestan"
 russia.504.d: "The shadow of the Caucasian War or 'Gazavat' looms over the North Caucasus. A conquest that lasted more than half a century, the Gazavat pitted the peoples of the Caucasus not only against Russia but against one another. Imam Shamil, the third to hold that title and the most ambitious, attempted to weld the entirety of the North Caucasus into a centralised, theocratic state. In doing so, Shamil aimed to replace the region's traditional landowning nobility with a new class of Muslim judges and clerics. Known to the Russians as 'Murids', Shamil's insurgency grew into a serious threat, but also earned no shortage of local enemies who resented Shamil's attempts to stamp out local customs under his interpretation of sharia law. The Russians found many allies among the anti-Shamil camp, planting seeds of division that remain bitterly relevant up to the present.\n\nChechnya and Ingushetia have been restive for decades, plagued by abrek banditry and the porous border with Georgia. Neighbouring Dagestan, however, remained relatively stable under the influence of Nazhmuddin Gotsinsky, the canny if controversial Imam of Dagestan. A powerful landowner whose family rose to prominence after abandoning Shamil for the Russians, Gotsinsky helped maintain order in the region after the end of the Civil War through a network of regional elites. Unfortunately, this network has frayed in the wake of the elderly Gotsinsky's death in 1932.\n\nNow, it seems the fragile peace in Dagestan is on the brink of collapse. Many estates and madrasas associated with pro-Russian landowners and clerics have come under attack after Ali Kayayev's infamous sermon. Socialist and liberal-aligned clerics are preaching a new holy war in alliance with the All-Russian Combat Organisation. Governor Nukh-Bek Tarkovsky has issued a call not only to rally loyal forces in Temir-Khan-Shura but also to declare a jihad of his own against 'communist rebels'. With unrest spreading from Avaria to Lezgistan, Russian control in highland Dagestan will need to be forcefully imposed."

 russia.505.t: "Expansion of the 'Wild Battalions'"
 russia.505.d.szrs: "The autonomy and, in many cases, outright lawlessness of the North Caucasus has made the region fertile ground for militias. The intensifying guerrilla conflict in the Caucasus Mountains has led to explosive growth among 'self-defence' groups loyal to the Svobodniks. Many of these forces are the personal retinues of local feudal lords or mullahs, particularly from privileged groups like the Kumyks, Kabardins, Cherkess, and Avars. These Muslim units have begun to cooperate closely with their Christian counterparts among the Ossetians and Cossacks, and all have gradually come to be known under the umbrella term of 'Wild Battalions'.\n\nThere is little doubt that this is a deliberate reference to the famous Caucasian 'Wild Division' of the German War. That said, many speculate the name is equally intended to appeal to Savinkov's ego. During his time as War Minister under the Provisional Government, Savinkov had been tasked with transforming the Wild Division into a full-fledged army, a project that was ultimately derailed by the Civil War. Now, many Wild Battalion commanders are pleading with the federal government to do what the 1917 project failed to achieve.\n\nOrganising and expanding the Wild Battalions has widespread support, especially as violence in the region has spilled out of the mountains and into the vulnerable lowlands and cities. However, many Army officers are loath to trust militias of dubious quality and argue that they would serve best as auxiliaries under the strict oversight of regular forces. On the other hand, Wild Battalion leaders have insisted on keeping their independence, arguing that excessive Army meddling would stifle the mobility and initiative that has made them so effective - and by using local forces, there would be less need to send Russian conscripts to the region."

 russia.506.d.regulars: "In the Caucasian highlands, much of the population resides in what are effectively fortified villages, referred to broadly as 'auls'. One particular aul in Ingushetia, Dzheyrakh, has earned a reputation as a stronghold of separatist forces. Consultation with locals has confirmed that the aul has served as a staging ground for repeated raids into the surrounding countryside. Fortunately, the generous benefits granted to the Wild Battalions have motivated many of these locals to enlist.\n\nIn spite of Dzheyrakh's commanding high ground and defensive towers, a spearhead force of Wild Battalion troops succeeded in infiltrating forward and surrounding the aul under the cover of night. A subsequent dawn barrage by Russian mountain guns and mortars prompted Dzheyrakh's defenders to sally out, only to be ambushed and routed by the hidden Wild Battalion fighters. With Boldyrev's insurgents panicking, the Battalioneers stormed the aul in support of the Russian regulars advancing up the valley from the town of Chimi. By noon, Dzheyrakh's defences had been wiped out and the aul captured, with many prisoners and their supplies taken as booty. The victory has been the cause for much celebration among loyalist forces. Likewise, the officers who had pushed for greater independence for the Wild Battalions are cheering their vindication."

Unfortunately, the Russian regulars they were guiding had much less experience moving quietly in harsh terrain. With the defenders of Dzheyrakh alerted by the racket, a chaotic melee soon broke out. After hours of anarchic gunfire into the darkness and barely aimed artillery barrages from a nearby Russian battery, Dzheyrakh was finally seized by government forces. Though the rebels suffered heavy losses, many managed to escape in the confusion, dispersing into the countryside to fight another day. The victory has been cause for celebration, but many on both sides can't help but feel that the lead-footed Russians bungled the successes of their auxiliaries."
 russia.506.a: "Yet more blood spilt in these accursed mountains."

 russia.508.t: "The Burning of Kuanib"
 russia.508.d: "Though the Wild Battalions have more than proven their worth in battling the insurgents, an increasing number of 'incidents' has left government forces concerned over just how much control they really have over their irregular comrades. These concerns have, unfortunately, been vindicated in the worst way possible in the Avaria region of Dagestan.\n\nFrom the little that has been gathered by Russian Army detachments stationed nearby, a Wild Battalion force dispatched on a routine patrol instead chose to attack the government-aligned aul of Kuanib. Lightly guarded by another force of Wild Battalioneers, Kuanib was soon overrun by the attackers and put to the torch. This senseless incident of 'friendly fire' was apparently brought about by a clan feud between members of the two Wild Battalion units. Needless to say, the sack of Kuanib has resulted in a deluge of criticism for Russia's conduct of the anti-insurgency operation in the Caucasus, and both the Army and government have been left deeply embarrassed. Reeling in the Wild Battalions' excesses will prove difficult, especially without affecting the Russian government's tenuous control over the region."
 russia.508.a: "Maybe we should be the ones giving orders, after all..."

 russia.509.t: "Svobodnik Madrasas"
 russia.509.d: "The North Caucasus is a land steeped in faith. Muslims are undoubtedly most prominent, with a crescent stretching from the Adyghe in the west to the Lezgins in the east all professing Sunni Islam. Many Christians likewise call the mountains home, notably the Ossetians, Cossacks, and more recent settlers from the rest of Russia. Both Muslim and Christian Mountaineers share deeply rooted pagan traditions, whose ancient customary laws often mingle with those of their outward faith. With modern party politics having little presence outside of the intelligentsia in a handful of cities, it is the bonds of family, clan, and religion which both bring together and divide the region's inhabitants.\n\nThough popular lore credits the Sufi orders for leading the resistance against Russia for centuries, the reality is more fluid. The Naqshbandi order, once led by Imam Shamil himself, has splintered several times already. Most recently, the split between the late Nazhmuddin Gotsinsky and his mentor Uzun-Khadzhi has seen the more pragmatic, landowning Naqshbandiyya remain loyal to Russia, while their poorer, more radical counterparts have risen in rebellion. The Qadiri order, led by the charismatic Ali Mitayev, have already been battling the government in Chechnya and Ingushetia for more than a decade.\n\nGiven the enormous influence that Muslim clergy wield in the region, the Russian government's faltering influence among their ranks is a serious danger. Islamic schools - the madrasas - number in their thousands, and many are run by openly anti-Russian clerics. Recently, a plan has been forwarded by the SZRS party cadre in Dagetsan suggesting a blitz to not only arrest the most blatantly seditious clergy, but also greatly increase funding and security for loyal madrasas. The Khalidiyah-Muhammadiyya order, highly influential among the Kumyks, has backed the proposal enthusiastically, and many Muslim SZRS members have likewise voiced their approval."

 russia.550.t: "A New Wave of Asian Settlement"
 russia.550.d: "With land reforms largely complete, a new wave of settlement to Central Asia has begun, with Russian settlers taking up arable lands in the Kyrgyz-populated (Kazakh in their own language) provinces of Semirechye and Semipalatinsk. There are already signs of conflict between the settlers and both the local Kazakhs and the Cossack landowners, reminiscent of the same troubles which began the uprising in 1916.\n\nThe land reform tribunal, manned by Kazakh intelligentsia of the Alash party and wealthier Cossacks, has been doing its best to resolve these disputes as they arise, but the settler numbers are increasing at such a pace that they say they will not be able to keep a lid on things for much longer."
 russia.550.a: "Let's keep an eye on this."

 russia.552.t: "The Land Tenure Issue"
 russia.552.d: "Cossacks in Turkestan have been protesting the violation of land tenure agreements which go back generations, and clashing with the land reform tribunal which has sided with settlers on many occasions.\n\nCossacks say they are due these lands due to long military service to Russia, but the local governors claim these lands are mismanaged, and that the only way to properly develop the area economically is to open it up to settlement."
 russia.552.a: "Side with the Cossacks - land tenure must be respected."
 russia.552.b: "Economic development requires sacrifice."

 russia.553.t: "Resistance of the Alash Party"
 russia.553.d: "After the ban on political parties outside the SZRS, the order was contested briefly by a court case raised by the prominent Kazakh lawyer and Alash politician, Validkhan Tanachev. Trying to argue that the Constitution of the Alash Autonomy protected the right of political association within the Autonomy, the executive order was nonetheless - and unsurprisingly, considering the court is mostly pro-SZRS - declared legal by the Supreme Court, and subsequently, the Alash Party was considered abolished.\n\nThe Alash Party had been the dominant party of the Kyrgyz Steppe for the past two decades. Ideologically they had been close to the Kadets and had been supporters of the liberal status quo. The Alash Parliament defied this order and continued operation as usual. The Commissar of the Autonomy, Alimkhan Yermekov, cannot be removed from power by the President of Russia as the position is elected, and Yermekov was defiant, mobilising Alash's meagre security forces and assuring that the Autonomy will maintain liberty even if the Federative Republic does not."
 russia.553.a: "Alash stands defiant."

 russia.555.t: "Alash Moves to Support Government"
 russia.555.d: "In the midst of the rising violence against Russian settlers, the Alash Party has expressed relief at the government's desire to focus on economic development rather than cater to the needs of Cossacks of Turkestan.\n\nAt a recent meeting in Verny, they took a vote to endorse the government's policy - one that Cossack leaders did not take kindly to. Threats of reprisals have been made against the Alash, which has opted to focus on calling for calm from Kazakh citizens."

 russia.560.t: "Kazakhs in Crisis"
 russia.560.d: "Already, tens of thousands of Kazakhs have been displaced from their traditional farmlands by the Cossacks and Russian settlers, and without having the means to feed themselves, have been reportedly resorting to banditry. Clashes with Cossacks and government forces throughout Semipalatinsk have been reported, with no end in sight. Local authorities have called on the Russian government to send assistance.\n\nThe Alash Party has called on the government to instead help the displaced Kazakhs, many of whom are facing violence and even starvation. The plight has begun to draw the attention of the Russian public, with opposition leaders criticising the government for continuing a policy of colonisation which has led only to increased suffering."

There is no definitive proof yet, but the [From.GetAdjective] government is suspected of not only aiding displaced Kazakhs crossing into their territory but also of actively aiding and arming Kazakh bandits.\n\nThe Russian Republic chose to ignore the southern Turkish states after the end of the civil war, a reward for their aid fighting the Reds, but perhaps it will soon be time to revisit that policy?"

The more southerly Turkish states were left to their independence, a thanks for the help they provided against the Bolsheviks, but the Russians were too invested in the valuable Kazakh territory to let it go. Continued colonisation of the region has led to massive instability, starvation, and tens upon thousands of Kazakh refugees fleeing into neighbouring states.\n\nNow a delegation of Kazakh representatives has approached the [Root.GetAdjective] government, pleading for assistance. They are certain that the matter will come to a revolt, one that has a hope of success only with international assistance and recognition."

 russia.575.t: "The Fate of the Alash Autonomy"
 russia.575.d: "With the end of the Kazakh rebellion, calls have been made to more thoroughly examine the Alash Autonomy. What exactly went wrong with it? The autonomy had its own parliament, government and security forces, everything dominated by the Alash party as dominant party democracy. The unwritten agreement between the Alash Party and Moscow was that they keep the Steppe in line, and they can do as they wish. But this system failed to counter separatist agitation and the rebellion. Defenders of the Alash argue that this is ultimately Moscow's fault - we are responsible for maintaining state security, and even if Alash had its own internal security force, it was ultimately the failure of the Kremlin that the rebellious mood boiled over in Semirechye.\n\nMost seem to agree that maintaining the Alash Autonomy, albeit reformed, is still a good idea, and that there is no realistic chance of a new uprising. Those arguing for total abolition tend to be either hardcore nationalists who oppose all federalism on principle, or reformists who believe that modernising the archaic social structures of Central Asia can only be done from the top down, by the paternal guidance of the Russians."

The Turkestan and Alash Autonomies were organised as federal parts of Russia, while the protectorates of Khiva and Bukhara were maintained as client states.\n\nThe Turkestan (Kokand) Autonomy existed between 1921 and 1929 until its de facto independence under President Madamin Bek following the New Year's Coup. It had a similar legal framework as the Alash Autonomy, with its own parliament, government and elections. In practice, Madamin Bek remained as a dominant warlord of the autonomy after the civil war, comparable in position to that of Lavr Kornilov in Russia itself. But now Madamin Bek's revolt lays in ruins, and the territory of the former 'Republic of Turkestan' is occupied by the Russian Army. The question remains: should a reformed autonomy be created?"

Many have identified this obscurantism as one reason why Turkestan has been stubbornly refusing to integrate into modern Russia and to the modern world at large.\n\nAs part of the overhaul of Central Asian security services and bureaucracy, we have also launched religious reforms in cooperation with the Orenburg Muslim Spiritual Assembly. Its Tatar and Bashkir priests are loyal to the government and have drafted plans for reforming the Turkestani religious institutions into a more modern form, closer to those of developed Muslim countries like [TUR.GetName]."

In one direction, there is national self-determination, where each people of Turkestan would gain their own titular republic, in harmonious union with Russia.\n\nBut to some, this is merely instilling nationalism where there was none previously. Instead, as Pan-Turkic intellectuals of Turkestan have suggested, there should be single, consolidated pan-national state of Turkestan, unifying the various Turkic and Iranic peoples under one flag."

 ### Far East and Semyonov Events
 russia.600.t: "The Manchurian Curse"
 russia.600.d: "Ten years ago in 1928, what began as an incident on the Chinese Eastern Railway became a full-scale military expedition under General Konstantin Sakharov. Sakharov, advancing boldly and far too quickly against poorly armed Chinese forces, eventually came to a halt before Mudanjiang. In the snow of the Manchurian winter, Sakharov suffered a crippling defeat against the combined forces of Zhang Zuolin's forces and the Japanese Chōsen Army while the main Russian forces were only being transported to the east. The war turned into a humiliating, destabilising defeat for the young Russian Republic.\n\nThe defeat reminded many of the catastrophe of 1905 and was followed by similar political turmoil, culminating in Vasily Boldyrev's coup attempt, the Christmas Purges enacted by General Kornilov, and a great loss of face to the SR President Nikolay Avksentyev. Many point to it as the beginning of escalating political instability, which was only halted by the election of Boris Savinkov in 1934.\n\nThe Far Eastern frontier has been quiet but in a state of constant underfunding. While Japan is regarded as a rival, the budget never seems to prioritise these far-flung parts of the nation, even though the shortfalls of the Far Eastern Military District were already seen in 1928."

Still, he is regarded as a folk hero by many Cossacks of the east, particularly by bitter former Transbaikal or Ussuri Cossacks who were resettled into the Amur Host after the civil war. Unlike Cossacks of the west, the ones in Amur are hardly elite, being nothing but middle-class military peasants of the unforgiving border region.\n\nThe SZRS has found some support among the Amur Cossacks, but there have been little practical efforts to improve the situation at the border, all while land reforms have been favouring non-Cossacks. In fact, a movement to 'reclaim the flags' of old Ussuri and Transbaikal hosts has sprung up in the distant Cossack villages. The long-time Ataman of the Amur Host, Ivan Mikhaylovich Gamov, has remained silent in the affairs of his own host."

 russia.602.t: "The Circle of St. George"
 russia.602.d: "Though the Old Christmas Purges of 1929 were directed chiefly at clandestine supporters of Savinkov and the radical left within the Russian Army, the most vocal among the reactionary right weren't spared either. General Mikhail Diterikhs earned a reputation during the Russian Civil War not only as an able general, but also as a diehard absolutist and a zealot against the 'godless revolution'. When the time came to rid the Russian Army of threats to the republic, it came as little surprise that Diterikhs was drummed out. He took his forced retirement poorly.\n\nThe years since have seen Diterikhs reinvent himself into a prolific author and a darling among Russia's dissatisfied monarchists. The former general's books have not only railed against Russia's 'atheistic democracy', but likewise condemned Savinkov as a 'vampiric puppet of Poles and Freemasons'. His cabal of supporters calls themselves the 'Circle of St. George' and have championed for the cause of the pretender Nikita Aleksandrovich Romanov, considered to be a proper Tsar rather than the line of Kirill, who had once marched in 1917 with a red cockade.\n\nWhat has become readily apparent is that Diterikhs was hardly just leading a book club. It seems the Circle has contacts with many dissatisfied soldiers, chief among them the Cossack Ataman Grigory Semyonov, who chose exile in Harbin in 1922 and is now essentially a mercenary warlord in cooperation with Zhang Zuolin."
 russia.602.a: "Have the security keep them in closer eye."
 russia.602.b: "Honestly, Diterikhs deserves a pardon."

 russia.603.t: "Cape Crillon Incident"
 russia.603.d: "Patrol Boat No. 32 of the Imperial Japanese Navy engaged and sank a small Russian ship off the coast of Sakhalin, claiming it was engaged in espionage. In truth, they had mistook the machinery of a weather ship for military-grade radio equipment, and the whole incident had been a consequence of the over-eagerness of the captain and an unfortunate storm that had pushed the Russian vessel off course.\n\nThe incident threatens to resurrect Russian grievances over Sakhalin in general, an occupation which the Kremlin has never accepted. Increased tensions in the Siberian region may hinder our hand in future operations in China and the Pacific, and some in the government are suggesting offering Moscow an apology and trying to reduce tensions, rather than posture."
 russia.603.a: "Offer explanations and apologies."
 russia.603.b: "It's their fault - end of story."

 russia.604.t: "Russian Ship Sunk off Sakhalin"
 russia.604.d.apology: "A Japanese patrol boat opened fire and sunk the Russian weather ship Zarnitsa off the coast of Sakhalin near Cape Crillon. The Japanese ambassador offered the deepest apologies from his government in Tokyo, and explained that the unfortunate incident had happened due to human error and misjudgement, leading the patrol boat's captain to believe Zarnitsa to be involved in spying on Japanese coastal defences.\n\nThe captain has been punished in accordance with Japanese naval regulations, and the Japanese government has promised to compensate for the loss."
 russia.604.d.noapology: "A Japanese patrol boat opened fire and sunk the Russian weather ship Zarnitsa off the coast of Sakhalin near Cape Crillon. The Japanese ambassador claimed that Zarnitsa had been illegally trespassing in Japanese territorial waters and conducting espionage on the coastal defences of Sakhalin.\n\nAs the Japanese lie, our only option has been to send further reinforcements to the Far East, expecting the Japanese posturing to turn into armed conflict eventually."
 russia.604.a: "One would think the Japanese more professional than this!"
 russia.604.b: "But we'll be ready."

 russia.605.t: "The Siberian Gambit"
 russia.605.d: "Russia has long been identified as the primary threat to our status as a great power. They've made no secret of their designs on our lifeline of Manchuria, and with tensions continuing to rise each day, another war between our nations seems like an inevitability. With our strategic focus primarily concerned with countering Germany and their influence in China, however, few can suggest a solid solution. A new development seems to offer us a golden opportunity to hamper Russian influence in the Far East, though.\n\nThe exiled Russian general Grigory Semyonov is not a man our officers find particularly trustworthy - his troops have been described as little more than bandits and he seems motivated mainly by promises of wealth and power. However, he has amassed a considerable number of Chinese mercenaries to fight for him, and on the condition we are willing to provide him with funding and weapons, he has promised to enter Russian territory and lead an insurrection. His connections to important men in the Far East would allow him to cross the Manchurian border relatively undetected, and if he manages to succeed in his rebellion, whatever government he establishes would likely be a far better neighbour than the current [RUS.GetNameDEF]. In the event his bandit little insurrection fails, however, it will only serve to provoke further tensions with Russia."
 russia.605.a: "Let's fund this Semyonov and see what he can do."

 russia.606.t: "The Honghuzi Ataman"
 russia.606.d: "Northern Fengtian has always been bandit country - home to the 'Honghuzi' who have long preyed on Russian interests in Manchuria with the support of Zhang Zuolin. These men have also proved a fertile recruiting ground for all kinds of warlords and bandit kings, including Grigory Semyonov's alarmingly growing mercenary army. It seems that Semyonov has secured backing from both [FNG.GetLeader] and the Kwantung Army, and is becoming a mercenary leader in his own right... but to what end, that we do not know yet.\n\nIt is possible that he seeks merely to profit from smuggling operations in Primorye and Amur, or possibly enter Japanese service in any wars in China... but it is also possible that his ambition knows no bounds, and he is preparing to someday cross the border into Russia."
 russia.606.a: "Let him try."

 russia.607.t: "The Assassination of Grigory Semyonov"
 russia.607.d: "Our intelligence operatives finally caught Grigory Mikhaylovich Semyonov at his dacha near Qiqihar. What was supposed to be a simple assassination turned into an epic shootout, as, by chance, the bomb was discovered before it could go off. Semyonov bailed out, but could not reach his car.\n\nAfter a brief exchange of bullets between the Ataman and our operatives, he killed four of our men (one of which he strangled in the fight) before trying to reach his horse, but was cornered in the stables Finally, a grenade obliterated his hiding place, and the Bandit Ataman of Siberia went out with a bang."
 russia.607.a: "Good riddance."

 russia.608.t: "Question of the Far Eastern Military District"
 russia.608.d: "The Far Eastern Military District has quickly become a hotbed of problems. The combined threats of Grigory Semyonov's bandit army in Manchuria, Japanese posturing, unrest among the Cossacks and the conspiratorial writings of Mikhail Diterikhs pose significant potential for blowing up catastrophically if we are not prepared.\n\nThe current commander of the district, General Innokenty Semyonovich Smolin, is quite the popular Yakutian war hero, who fought as a corps commander under Kolchak in the civil war. However, he does have connections to Grigory Semyonov and Mikhail Diterikhs, though there has been no sign of disloyalty. Still, our security services have recommended that the president sack many of Smolin's subordinates of questionable political loyalty and replace them with someone with fewer connections to Semyonov - even if he would be less liked by the locals."
 russia.608.a: "Yes, the whole district staff should be filled with loyalists."
 russia.608.b: "I am quite confident in Smolin's abilities."

 russia.609.t: "Far Eastern All-Military Union"
 russia.609.d: "After a flurry of resignations and retirements from the Russian Army, hundreds of former White officers fled the country, fearing for their lives. Now, a number of former personnel of the Far Eastern and Siberian Military Districts have come together in Manchuria and formed the Far Eastern All-Military Union in Harbin under the leadership of Viktorin Mikhaylovich Molchanov. They have been joined by Grigory Semyonov and Mikhail Diterikhs, creating one large White organisation in Harbin.\n\nThe Union has issued a programme of helping former Russian officers in China and producing propaganda against the communist authorities of Russia, but their true intentions no doubt are more violent. The Japanese Kwantung Army has quickly expressed their support for this organisation as a way to destabilise our authority in the east."
 russia.609.a: "No matter."

 russia.610.t: "Smugglers of the Amur and Ussuri"
 russia.610.d: "The Russian Far East has captured the imagination of the public as a romanticised wilderness, full of dashing Cossacks adventuring in the Orient, but in practice it is mostly distinguished by its lawlessness. These endless lands are hard to keep in order, and smuggling is endemic to the region. Chinese and Russian 'merchants' and bandits smuggle gold out of Russia, and vodka and opium in. In many regions, impoverished border guards merely take part of the profits instead of moving against the criminals.\n\nFor a long time, it's been a simply accepted fact that the Manchurian border is impossible to keep in order, but ultimately it is merely a matter of funding and priorities. To combat the smuggling, we could simply direct more resources to the border guards - or, as some more far-sighted ministers propose, start a proper social development programme in the Far East, seeking to improve the livelihoods of everyone in the region, which would also reduce the base for criminal activities."
 russia.610.a: "Just increase security at the border."
 russia.610.b: "Yes, but the region must be developed more, too."
 russia.610.c: "Who cares?"

 russia.611.t.szrs: "Trial of the Idiots"
 russia.611.t.soc: "The White Ghosts of Siberia"
 russia.611.d.szrs: "The 'Trial of the Idiots' came into being after the Vozhd allegedly told General Innokenty Smolin, former Commander of the Far Eastern Military District, that only a complete idiot can lose an entire military district. Smolin and what remains of his staff have been put on trial to investigate what exactly happened in Khabarovsk under their watch as the entire Far Eastern Military District essentially collapsed overnight.\n\nMen loyal to the infamous former general Mikhail Diterikhs, such as Fyodor Bredov, were integral in the takeover of the Khabarovsk Headquarters, ensuring chaos of command simultaneous to the revolt of the Amur-Ussuri Cossacks led by Yury Savitsky. Essentially, General Smolin's command had been paralysed by the conspiracy of Grigory Semyonov and Mikhail Diterikhs.\n\nStill, Smolin is obviously guilty of negligence and misconduct, as he failed to keep a check on his own subordinates and to maintain control in his own military district."
 russia.611.d.soc: "The news from Eastern Siberia is increasingly worrying. The commander of the Far Eastern Military District, General Grigory Ivanovich Kulik, has completely lost control of the region in the aftermath of a conspiracy in his own Khabarovsk headquarters. What then unfolded was a coordinated revolt of Amur-Ussuri Cossacks and the bandit army under Grigory Semyonov, which caught Kulik's command by surprise, barely escaping from Khabarovsk with his life. The rebels portray themselves as the White vanguard in Siberia, courting support from all anti-socialists in the east with varying success. The question remains of what should be done with Kulik, whose incompetence led to the eastern catastrophe."
 russia.611.a: "He is merely guilty of failure."
 russia.611.b: "He has committed treason."

 russia.615.t: "Semyonov's Return"
 russia.615.d: "The headquarters of the Far Eastern Military District lie in Khabarovsk - but they have gone dark on us. It seems that last night, a military takeover was arranged by General Mikhail Konstantinovich Diterikhs and his conspirators and loyalists in the district administration, bolstered by a rebellious Cossack unit from the Amur Host. Diterikhs' men rapidly took over the military headquarters and put the former commander of the military district under house arrest, alongside his staff.\n\nBut this was only the first shot. As Grigory Semyonov's army crossed the border to Primorye, the border forces initially assumed another war with the Japanese had begun, but were not able to receive orders from Khabarovsk. Semyonov's army of Cossacks and Chinese mercenaries penetrated the border in multiple locations, and it was clear that organised resistance was all but collapsing.\n\nThe coup de grâce came when the Amur Cossack leader, Yury Aleksandrovich Savitsky, declared allegiance to Semyonov and took over Blagoveschensk and a large part of the Amur Host's territory. Propaganda spread to the populace referring to Semyonov's movement as the 'Far Eastern Free Army', which vowed to put end to the tyranny of Moscow and the lackeys of the Kremlin. While they may not have much popular support per se, they have plenty of those disgruntled with our current regime."
 russia.615.a: "Semyonov is a traitor to Russia!"
 russia.615.b: "Semyonov is who we need!"

 russia.616.t: "The Trial of the Semyonovites"
 russia.616.d: "The self-styled Ataman and rebel Grigory Semyonov was already engaged in banditry and robbery during the Civil War, as his White forces were more focused on amassing personal wealth over fighting the Bolsheviks. Supreme Leader Kolchak sought to crush the Siberian Atamans already in the last episodes of the Civil War, but many of them - Semyonov, Kalmykov, Annenkov - fled to China. Most of these officers made a career as freelance advisors to various Chinese warlords - a fitting place for honourless bandits like they are.\n\nBut now Semyonov and his cronies are here again. The other ring-leader of the Far Eastern revolt, Mikhail Diterikhs, was not captured alive."
 russia.616.a: "No mercy for traitors! Execute them all!"
 russia.616.b: "Spare those who will repent - imprison Semyonov and the rest."

 russia.617.t: "The Far Eastern Uprising"
 russia.617.d: "In the Russian Far East, forces loyal to Grigory Semyonov and Mikhail Diterikhs have risen up against the regime of [RUS.GetLeader]. Semyonov has been operating from Manchuria and has served Zhang Zuolin as a military advisor and recruiter, especially in the Russian community at Harbin. Most of the arms for his forces come from the Kwantung Army, which has been covertly supporting Semyonov.\n\nA number of prominent Japanese industrialists are also involved in the uprising with hopes of securing control over Siberian natural resources. If Semyonov succeeds, we will gain a friendly puppet state. If not, nothing of value was lost."
 russia.617.a: "Okay."
 russia.617.b: "Semyonov is who we need. (Play as Far Eastern Army)"

 ### Military Anger Events
 russia.910.t: "Military In-Fighting"
 russia.910.d: "There has always been a struggle for the soul of the Russian Army going on in the shadows, and the more conservative officer corps is worried about the potential of losing it. The SZRS has always had its home in radical veterans' organisations and has a lot of fervent supporters in the lower ranks of the military, like NCOs and young officers who went through the hell of the civil war as privates.\n\nThe SZRS' political materials are being shared in the garrisons, which has often prompted resistance from superior officers, conservative or more liberal-minded, and is viewed as unprofessional. But this schism keeps growing between 'True Svobodniks' in the ranks and those soldiers who value professionalism above personal loyalty to the Vozhd."
 russia.910.a: "That's not good..."

 russia.911.t: "Secrets in the Army"
 russia.911.d: "Officially, the Army is loyal to the Vozhd, but our security services have been noting more and more suspicious meetings around old generals. The loudest Svobodniks are being kept outside of inner circles, and discreet discussions have been happening in cliques around men like Drozdovsky, Denikin, Markov, and Wrangel.\n\nKlepikov has suggested treason and proposed military purges - but such an option also carries tremendous risks, given how much of the army seems more loyal to their Civil War leaders than to the Vozhd. We will observe and prepare."
 russia.911.a: "They need to realise they SERVE the government!"

 russia.912.t: "On the Bayonet's End"
 russia.912.d: "The anger and suspicion in the Russian Army has reached a flashpoint. Our intelligence services are still trying to build the whole picture of the current events in Moscow, but it seems that a number of local units mutinied - or were ordered to mutiny by someone higher up. The soldiers were demanding that Savinkov's commissars and spies be taken away from the army, and that the unexplained purges will stop.\n\nThe local putschist leader, Colonel Boris Fortunatov, had been thought to be politically reliable, but instead attempted to seize the Kremlin and key points in Moscow in a redo of the Boldyrev and Kornilov attempts. The Special Purpose Battalion and forces loyal to the government are engaged in the fight, and it seems like the attempt would be left only as an attempt."
 russia.912.a: "Until it was revealed that this was only the first shot."
 russia.912.b: "[RUS_GetArmyChief] puts his subordinates in line."

 russia.913.t: "The Purges of [GetMonth] [GetYear]"
 russia.913.d: "The shoddy coup attempt by Colonel Fortunatov some time ago was the last straw. While there is still no clarity if [RUS_GetArmyChief] has any knowledge in advance or even part in the planning, he is obviously denying everything. Instead, he used this as a pretext for major personnel changes in the military, seeking to remove 'unprofessional' officers.\n\nOfficially, this is to root out loose cannons like Boldyrev had been, but in practice he is also removing prominent Svobodniks and other 'politicised' officers. The military commissars in particular have been complaining, and in some cases the Vozhd has interfered. The cohabitation between the Army and the Party seems to be reaching a boiling point, and one has to give up eventually."
 russia.913.a: "Can they not understand that we share the goal?"

 russia.914.t: "The Death of Savinkov"
 russia.914.t2: "Operation December"
 russia.914.d: "It was midnight, and the plan sprang into action. Units of the 2nd Guards Infantry Division had been transferred near Moscow for manoeuvres weeks earlier. Tight security had been maintained to avoid Klepikov's all-seeing spy network - all operated on personally given orders, between men who had fought and bled together decades prior.\n\nIn the dead of the night, the 13th Infantry Regiment would take over the Ministry of Interior and decapitate Savinkov's intelligence services. The 200th Infantry Regiment would hit the main bridges and radio stations, while the 6th Infantry Regiment would escort [RUS_GetArmyChief] to the Kremlin and arrest the president. Another division would be ordered to block the roads leading to Moscow.\n\nNo matter who won, there would be firing squads tonight.\n\nThe coup began catastrophically. Gosstrazha units guarding the ministry refused to lay down their weapons, and a shootout began. Much better armed and trained regulars rapidly won out, but the delay let Savinkov be warned, and he had left the Kremlin by the time [RUS_GetArmyChief] got there. Fortunately for the putschists, the president's convoy was intercepted on his way to Bykovo airport. Savinkov's armour-plated Buick became the centre of a shootout, and his guard - including his trusted spymaster Klepikov - were killed in the crossfire. Wounded, Savinkov himself was captured and shortly after executed after a drumhead court-martial held by [RUS_GetArmyChief]. Among the charges were mass murder, sabotage, and corruption.\n\nThe body was burned soon after, and mass arrests of the Savinkovites began."
 russia.914.d2: "Savinkov had grown more and more paranoid during the war, but he was not yet invincible. An assassination was far too risky; Savinkov had to be removed, but without his supporters rallying for him. Kornilov's attempt in 1936 had been a simple-minded, direct gamble - and Savinkov had always had Miss Fortune as a lover when it came to gambling. General-Fieldmarshal Wrangel elected to go about it in a more safe way.\n\nWith months of preparation, it was ensured that there was a meeting of the War Cabinet where multiple of Savinkov's most loyal soldiers were not present after their promotions, and replaced with less experienced Gosstrazha officers. Immediately, Savinkov demanded increased security, but the schemers acted before his command could be fulfilled. The three highest ranking officers present in the meeting - Pyotr Wrangel, [RUS_GetNavyChief], and Sergey Markov - informed Savinkov and his Chairman-Minister that they must step down due to their catastrophic conduct of the war. The guards present refused the Vozhd's order to shoot Wrangel, either out of fear, confusion, or respect.\n\nWell aware that Savinkov - even alive but arrested - would still carry tremendous authority, a quick decision was made to court-martial him. Both Pyotr Wrangel and [RUS_GetNavyChief] would have preferred for the man to stand for a fair trial, but ultimately admitted that in these conditions, it was not possible. Savinkov also refused to sign a document of resignation, declaring that the Russian people will tear the plotters apart for what they have done. These were among his last words, as he was shot by a firing squad in the backyard of the headquarters.\n\nWith the beast decapitated, the Russian government more or less fell apart. The initial, critical hours saw forces loyal to Wrangel close down the capital and arrest most high-ranking Svobodniks and Gosstrazha officers, and across the country resistance was only sporadic - not many were willing to stand against the authority of the White generals to defend the dead dictator."
 russia.914.a: "We did it, we saved Russia."

 russia.918.t: "The Death of Savinkov"
 russia.918.d: "The Vozhd's underground bunker is a sour place. Every day it becomes clearer that all is lost. Savinkov himself has become erratic - some days he binges on morphine and methamphetamine, others he dwells in dark poetry, immersed in apocalyptic visions. Other days he talks of his fear that the military will simply shoot him, and how he should have killed all those Tsarist lackeys when he had the chance. Those closest to him, the Dikgofs and Flegont Klepikov, have tried to talk him into leaving Russia, with no avail.\n\nHis final words, recorded by his mistress Lyubov Dikgof, were 'Fate gave me indomitable energy and the heart of a revolutionary. So I went on until I was convinced of my mistake'.\n\nHe was found in his bunker office, loaded but not shot revolver by his side, having died of heart failure following a morphine overdose. He left no will.\n\nThe military wasted no time. [RUS_GetArmyChief] issued a communiqué, informing the nation of the army appointing him to serve as the Supreme Leader. The coup was implemented quickly, suggesting that the military had been preparing to do it anyway. The army assured their first priority is to save Russia from impending military catastrophe, and punish everyone who was complicit in almost destroying Russia for their own personal gain."
 russia.918.a: "We did it, we saved Russia."

 ### Popular Anger Events
 russia.920.t: "Official Assassinated"
 russia.920.d: "'Man lives and breathes murder, walks in bloody darkness and dies in bloody darkness.'\n\nAt least some are following Savinkov's words, as last night, an unknown assailant shot and killed a high-ranking SZRS party official from Ufa, Mikhail Vedenyapin-Stegeman. A manhunt has been launched, and at least 17 people have been arrested for possible connections to Communist activities in Ufa. Stegeman was a prominent Old Svobodnik and Savinkov's trusted man in the area, and the whole assassination does make the security services look ineffective.\n\nA common joke is already being circulated about VRBO's assassins using Savinkov's own books as a guide on how to assassinate SZRS officials, though naturally it is not a joke that is proper to say, or one might get branded as an opponent of the Party."
 russia.920.a: "Mi bandito, ubivanto, ukradanto i plivanto na zakono!"

 russia.921.t: "The Vozhd Questioned"
 russia.921.d: "The SZRS is a patchwork party, one that has integrated various far-right groups and has always been more united behind ideas than concrete policies. It is worrisome that Savinkov's popularity has plummeted so much that there is dissent even in the party. Particularly noteworthy was Yury Klyuchnikov's - who leads the Kazan chapter of the SZRS - address to the Vozhd, signed by multiple southern chapters.\n\nThey express worry over Moscow's policies in Cossack and Muslim regions, and fear that these policies are merely increasing popular unrest and crystallising opposition against the party. Even this kind of careful criticism is not taken well in the Kremlin, but when a significant amount of party chapters express their worry, there needs to be at least some action."
 russia.921.a: "Those failures are [GetSecondInCommand]'s alone."
 russia.921.b: "Nonsense, it is everyone else who is wrong."

 russia.922.t: "Chaos in the Capital"
 russia.922.d: "Massive illegal protests and strikes have consumed the nation. Yes, we have done our best to destroy the socialist organisation and kill or imprison their leaders, but the Socialist-Revolutionary underground network remains remarkably strong - something Savinkov would know from experience. The Moscow protests are led by Nikolay Martyanov and Andrey Kolegayev, and despite police breaking them apart multiple times, they have continued for three days. The armed militants operating under cover of the protests have intensified their attacks on key SZRS personnel, and in some districts, the police have even been steadily losing confidence in the central government's orders.\n\nThe situation is even worse in Petrograd, and day by day protests are spreading in most cities. Almost a hundred people have died already, and the only reason keeping the Vozhd from ordering mass slaughter is the fear that the military may not be entirely on his own side - so he has to be careful on whom to trust, with Gosstrazha units and a few absolutely loyal divisions handling potential mass executions. It will be a tense night in Moscow."
 russia.922.a: "The revolutionaries overwhelm the capital."
 russia.922.b: "The chaos drowns in blood."

 russia.923.t: "The Death by Thousand Cuts"
 russia.923.d: "The mass protests were put down brutally, but it is only fighting against the effects - not the causes. The remarkably effective underground organisation of the VRBO has been conducting their campaign of terror, finding ever more willing recruits and helpers. This has inflamed the separatist organisations of the North Caucasus and Far East, and major cities are consumed by chaos and paranoia with almost weekly bombings.\n\nThe army is maintaining control, but there are estimates that a large number of common soldiers actually harbour sympathies for the revolutionaries. Similarly, the patience of the officer corps is running thin - they have supported Savinkov for his strength, but now he seems to be running the country into the ground. Savinkov has barely left the Senate Palace, consumed by paranoia."
 russia.923.a: "Here it is, here it is at last - the encounter with reality."

 russia.924.t: "Beginning of the [GetMonth] Revolution"
 russia.924.d: "The grip of Savinkov's security apparatus has been rapidly weakening. Petrograd has been the focal point of the protests, but people have taken to the streets across most cities, demanding an end to 'new serfdom' in the artels and putting an end to the arbitrary violence committed by SZRS. There have been thousands of arrests and executions, but the police and military seem to be increasingly passive, or even disloyal, either having been swayed by revolutionary propaganda or simply having little love for Savinkov's regime.\n\nBy the end of the week, a massive number of people have gathered in Red Square, demanding Savinkov address them directly. Against the wishes of his security staff, seemingly full of belief in his own persona, the president decided to speak to 'his people', hoping to appeal to the masses like in his heyday.\n\nSavinkov's presence calmed the square briefly, as loudspeakers blasted his calm words to the masses. But it did not last. A bundle of grenades was thrown from the crowd, and all hell broke loose. People from the crowd started shooting, and Savinkov's personal guard responded. Bodies littered the square as bystanders bit the lead. After minutes of chaos, over thirty lay dead, including Savinkov himself, who had caught shrapnel to his face and died of catastrophic bleeding.\n\nAfter the head of the snake was cut, the regime began to quickly collapse. Communications hubs and railway stations of Moscow were taken over by soldiers with red armbands, and they were soon broadcasting the news to all of Russia: Savinkov was dead, shot by Socialist-Revolutionaries, who had formed a provisional government to return power to the people from the tyrants."
 russia.924.a: "Long live free Russia!"

 russia.925.t: "Formation of the Provisional Government"
 russia.925.d: "After the immediate smoke had dispersed, the situation had become clearer. Forces loyal to the Socialist-Revolutionaries held the capital and had also managed to take power in Petrograd, Yekaterinburg, and a number of other major cities. A government headed by Boris Kamkov was convened, which included delegates elected by workers' unions and peasants' councils of the Moscow region, though in practice only 'anti-Savinkovists' were even allowed to run.\n\nThe new government quickly made a number of important appointments: General Yury Sablin was to serve as the War Minister, while Yakov Blyumkin's combat organisation was officially merged with the police, and he was appointed to lead it. Maria Spiridonova, a respected revolutionary, was elected as the first president. Proper national elections were promised to be arranged as soon as the remnants of Savinkovist loyalists had been destroyed, to 'ensure freedom of the people'."
 russia.925.a: "Prepare for the reactionary backlash."
 rus_925_tt_1: "§rOnly a small portion of the military will join the coup.§!"
 rus_925_tt_2: "§PThe military is not sufficiently radicalised to tolerate a socialist government.§!"
 rus_925_tt_3: "§PThe revolutionary momentum has waned too much for the socialists to come out victorious...§!"

 russia.926.t: "The Manstein Affair"
 russia.926.d: "Mere days had passed since the death of Savinkov. Many of the SZRS top names had been arrested, shot, or fled the country. In a daring attempt to turn the tides, Generals Vladimir Manstein and Anton Turkul, who still commanded sway in garrisons near Moscow, launched a counter-coup. With a column of armoured forces and cavalry, they managed to take over part of southern Moscow. They had hoped that large parts of the Moscow garrison would defect to these 'Whites', but this did not happen. It seems that very few people had an interest in dying for the late Vozhd's dream.\n\nAfter a brief battle in Zvenigorod, the majority of the putschists surrendered, and Manstein was court-martialled and shot on the field. Blyumkin's security forces immediately began investigating everyone connected to the aborted coup attempt, and recommended launching a large-scale 'reorganisation' of the army command, to demote the suspected Savinkovists from all positions and replace them with 'convinced democrats'. To avoid invoking greater backlash, many of the old White war heroes were given military pensions and 'persuaded' to retire in good order, and in all fairness, they do not seem very excited about serving under socialists either. With these changes, much of the security apparatus is cleansed from anti-socialist forces."

 russia.927.t.wrangel: "The Wrangel Affair"
 russia.927.d: "Mere days had passed since the death of Savinkov. Many of the SZRS top names had been arrested, shot, or fled the country. However, while the military command had been largely apathetic to Savinkov's last days, the possibility of a socialist takeover had widely alarmed the military. The Socialist-Revolutionaries had made power grabs in cities, even appointing a socialist as their own War Minister.\n\nA crisis meeting was held in Kaluga under the guard of the oldest veteran formations of the army. A small inner circle of officers discussed and recognised the perilous situation. Even if the Socialist-Revolutionaries stayed true to their promise and restored free elections, a civil war could be sparked through a multitude of ways - it only needed one commander to act without thinking. The only way to stop a second civil war would be removing the socialists from power with a swift and decisive move, but allowing them representation in a more-or-less socialist provisional government overseen by the military. Essentially, the coup had to gain democratic credentials.\n\nThe plan was put into action as soon as possible. Secret messages were relayed, and private meetings were held outside the ears of officers with SR loyalties. And then [RUS_GetArmyChief] struck: Guard units quickly overwhelmed the defenders in various parts of Moscow, took over the radio stations, and put the government under watch. A communiqué was read aloud to the people: this was not a coup, but merely the military stepping up to do their duty, which is to ensure order. A careful tone was kept in references to the socialists - that they were merely 'democrats' and had 'collaborated with the army'. In practice, the government had been threatened with arrest if they did not comply.\n\nAnd the moment Socialist-Revolutionaries lost the upper hand, their military advantage was gone. Moscow was under the control of [RUS_GetArmyChief]. The socialists were still part of the provisional government, but they were forced to allow a large number of non-socialists into this government."
 russia.927.a: "We have saved Russia from another civil war, gentlemen."

 russia.961.t: "Spilt Blood"
 russia.961.d: "The casualties of our war have reached over one million. As dead bodies are brought back home, people are beginning to question: is this war worth it? Has Russia's ambition gotten ahead of itself?\n\nAnd we answer: no. This is merely the pain of birthing the new world, the sacrifice that must be paid for Salvation. Each and every son of Russia is giving his blood for the Motherland, so that it can rise into untold heights, so that the future generations will build shrines and memorials from even the most ordinary soldier."
 russia.961.a: "We are not the ones who will measure our sacrifice."

 russia.962.t: "Stavka's Suspicions"
 russia.962.d: "Let's just admit that the war has not been going as stellar as SZRS propaganda would prefer. While many defeats can be hidden or explained away to the common people, it is the military brass who have the full situation.\n\nThey are perfectly aware of the gravity of the situation - and that is giving strength to the old army doubts over the Vozhd's ability to conduct a war of this seriousness."
 russia.962.a: "Time to turn the war around, then."

 russia.963.t: "Victory Parade in Moscow"
 russia.963.d: "Russian rule has been restored in Turkestan. The army has thrown a great military parade in Moscow to celebrate - and most importantly, to show the Russian people our strength. There are the black-uniformed Kornilovites of the 2nd Division; there are the crimson-capped Drozdovites of the 3rd Division. Columns of men and armoured vehicles roll past as the orchestra blasts the March of the Alekseyevsky Regiment. Four bombers fly over the city, as a show of Russia's aerial might.\n\n[ROOT.GetLeader] is welcoming the parade, saluting to them as they go past. Thousands of ecstatic Moscovites line the streets, singing and cheering the soldiers."
 russia.963.a: "For Russia, my beauty!"

 russia.964.t: "A Renaming Campaign"
 russia.964.d: "Under Karol Vendzyagolsky's direction, the Ministry of Culture has begun a renaming campaign for several regions and cities across the motherland.\n\nThe ministry released a statement saying that these changes give proper credit and recognition to those who were instrumental in creating the Third Russia."
 russia.964.a: "Glory to the heroes who made Russia free!"

 ###### Resistance & Integration

 ### Ukraine Events
 russia.1100.t: "Ukraine in Flames"
 russia.1100.d: "The war may be over, but the fight goes on. This is the slogan of the doomed soldiers, the remnants of the Ukrainian military still willing to put up a fight. From the beginning of our occupation of the south and east of the country, resistance was fierce. Though all of Ukraine was to eventually fall to our forces, the government never fully surrendered - and despite the end of the war and the fall of Germany, resistance only seems to grow.\n\nWhat has thus far been sporadic, unorganised resistance has now coalesced into a single central organisation, albeit still operating in separate cells in a decentralised manner. The Ukrainian Union of People's Resistance (USNS) vows to strike against the Russian occupier as long as they can draw breath.\n\nIt seems that the USNS is composed of a variety of groups, both nationalist, socialist, and merely anti-Russian. Many of them are based around the remnants of units of the Ukrainian Army, but some are built around pre-war terrorist organisations, such as the Ukrainian Revolutionary Liberation Army (URVA) and Armed Forces of the League of Ukrainian Nationalists (ZSLUN).\n\nFor now, these partisans have been waging a relentless bandit war from the forests of western Ukraine, where they seem to have broad support from the villages."
 russia.1100.a: "One more fight..."

 russia.1101.t: "Administrative Division of Ukraine"
 russia.1101.d: "As the war is ending, a more long-term solution needs to be found for the Liberated Territories. A number of proposals have been made for the civilian rule in Ukraine, ranging from Ukraine existing as an autonomous state within Russia, to its partitioning, to simply annexing all of Ukraine as gubernias, like any other part of Russia.\n\nWhile some fossils of politics still refuse to acknowledge Ukrainian nationhood, it is impossible to ignore. The Ukrainians have been separated from us for two decades, and during this time so-called 'Little Russia' has grown to see itself as increasingly separate. The direct Russification of the late Imperial era saw little progress - in fact, it galvanised the opposition. To ensure the stability and future of our union, we can do as Emperor Aleksandr I wisely did: pacify the frontier by tolerating some amount of self-rule, and focus on building long-term institutional bonds between Russia and Ukraine."
 russia.1101.d.unitary: "A number of proposals have been made for the civilian rule in Ukraine, ranging from Ukraine existing as an autonomous state within Russia, to its partitioning, to simply annexing all of Ukraine as gubernias, like any other part of Russia.\n\nWhile some fossils of politics still refuse to acknowledge Ukrainian nationhood, it is impossible to ignore. The Ukrainians have been separated from us for two decades, and during this time so-called 'Little Russia' has grown to see itself as increasingly separate. The direct Russification of the late Imperial era saw little progress - in fact, it galvanised the opposition. But we must not repeat the folly of Emperor Aleksandr I and his autonomies - Ukraine must be on a short leash, and concessions must be limited to cultural ones, not political ones."
 russia.1101.a: "Unified Ukrainian Autonomy."
 russia.1101.b: "Separate Ukrainian and Novorussian Autonomies."
 russia.1101.c: "Annex Novorussia; create a limited Ukrainian autonomy."
 russia.1101.e: "Annex everything."

 russia.1102.t: "Government of Ukraine"
 russia.1102.d: "Now that normalcy is returning to Ukraine, the simplest way to establish civilian government would be to use the pre-existing bureaucracy as much as possible. The Hetmanist administration in particular employed many Russophiles with the experience and connections necessary, and they would be a natural, apolitical group for our collaborationist regime to lean on."
 russia.1102.d.szrs: "Now that normalcy is returning to Ukraine, a civilian administration is being formed in the Ukrainian gubernias. Naturally, it will be run by the Ukrainian branch of the SZRS, which held its founding conference in Kharkov some weeks ago. Pyotr Stepanovich Boranetsky, already a prominent Svobodnik in Russia, failed his bid for leadership against Dmitry Mikhaylovich Odinets. Odinets had strong backing in the radicalised Russian Union in Ukraine, which serves as the backbone of the new SZRS branch. Additionally, the party has drawn some other Russophile nationalists, namely General Vasily Viktorovich Biskupsky's clique of officers and bureaucrats, who have a lukewarm attitude towards Russian rule.\n\nThis 'USZRS' will be expanded rapidly to incorporate all aspects of life in Ukraine, both as a recruitment base and, most importantly, as a nation-spanning propaganda office. After all, the Vozhd was born in Ukraine; few can doubt his love for it."
 russia.1102.d.solonevich: "Now that normalcy is returning to Ukraine, a civilian administration is being formed in the Ukrainian gubernias. The Ukrainian administration, however, will be led in a rather unique manner. Taking inspiration from Viacheslav Lypinski's ideas of classocracy, Ukrainian elections will not be held to a parliamentary body, but a corporatist one, the All-Ukrainian Class Assembly. In Solonevich's eyes, this so-called classocratic way of governance is inherent to the Ukrainian way of life, and as such its implementation would ensure the best form of national development for Ukraine. It also serves a political purpose: the expansion of the classocratic system to all of Ukraine, with other regions largely unaffected by the experiment, can show whether the classocratic system could be expanded to the rest of Russia."
 russia.1102.d.dem: "Now that normalcy is returning to Ukraine, so do civilian politics. We have been recruiting the pre-existing civilian administration to run everyday issues, but it is only intended as a temporary measure. Elections have been promised to be held in Ukraine, though the vast majority of pre-existing parties have been either abolished or are in exile for separatism. Despite the resistance in parts of Ukraine, political life is slowly waking up. Two major parties have been formed to compete in the coming elections: the UFDP and the UNB.\n\nThe Ukrainian Federative-Democratic Party has been formed by Ukrainian liberals and social democrats who have deemed it better to accept the status quo and seek to maintain Ukrainian freedoms within the Russian federal system. The UFDP's programme includes safeguarding the cultural, economic, and political rights of the Ukrainians, seeking to build a healthy federal relationship with Russia, and reinforcing democratic principles nationwide. They would likely be in the 'legal opposition' with the Kremlin and oppose any further centralisation.\n\nTo their right, the Ukrainian National Bloc has been formed to combine Russophile conservatives and a-national conservatives into a single party, which is strongly backed by the VSZV and Protofis. Their programme features 'constructive autonomy' within Russia, maintaining conservative values, supporting veterans, and a focus on 'sensible economic policies' to rebuild the damages of the war as smoothly as possible, instead of chasing vague ideological goals."
 russia.1102.a: "Appoint a local bureaucratic government."
 russia.1102.b: "Appoint SZRS loyalists."
 russia.1102.c: "Empower the classocrats."
 russia.1102.e: "There will be elections."

 russia.1103.t: "Commander of the Ukrainian Military District"
 russia.1103.d: "It is not an enviable job to be the first commander of the recently-formed Ukrainian Military District.\n\nWithin its jurisdiction falls a long list of tasks, like eviscerating the Ukrainian resistance movements, maintaining public order, defending Russia's western border, restoring Ukrainian military bases to working order, and conscripting Ukrainian military units. It is likely that this post will draw much ire from the populace should there be too many corpses."
 russia.1103.a: "A hard man for a hard job. Send Manstein."
 russia.1103.b: "Shteyfon is calm and well-connected."
 russia.1103.c: "An unorthodox touch is needed. General Shkuro!"
 russia.1103.e: "We need someone impartial, like Malinovsky."
 russia.1103.f: "A man of talent and humble beginnings, Grechko."

 russia.1104.t: "Tereschenko and Protofis"
 russia.1104.d: "Often the first ones to see advantage in the new order are those who see financial possibilities in it. Protofis, or the Union of Industry, Trade, Finance, and Agriculture, has been among one of the first Ukrainian organisations to offer their help to the new administration. Mikhail Ivanovich Tereshchenko - perhaps one of the richest men in Ukraine - represented the organisation in negotiations, backed by help from Russian conservatives like Aleksandr Golitsyn, who is likewise originally from the Ukrainian business world.\n\nTereshchenko's backroom deal seeks to protect the rights of Ukrainians, especially in regards to their property, and seeks a major role in the reconstruction effort, likely seeing profit in it. In exchange, the Protofis network will use their connections and resources in Ukraine to support Russian government activities in the country. After all, the swift economic recovery of Ukraine is to everyone's advantage."
 russia.1104.a: "At least someone has sense."
 russia.1104.b: "Selling out your country so fast, huh?"

 russia.1105.t: "Minister of Ukrainian Matters"
 russia.1105.d: "A new idea being floated around in the cabinet is the creation of a new ministry: the Ministry of Ukrainian Matters. Its proponents argue that, with the ongoing resistance movements in Ukraine, the establishment of a cabinet position whose sole concern would be the support and development of the Ukrainian lands would greatly improve our standing among the war-weary populace.\n\nNaturally, it is likely that the minister would be ethnically Ukrainian and would seek to defend Ukrainian cultural and political rights. In practice, this would give more power to the Ukrainian position in the executive branch. While all of this makes sense on the surface, there are opponents both on the left and the right. One of the main reasons this is being proposed in the first place is that Ukraine is undoubtedly the most important of the recovered territories, having a pre-war population of around 40 million and being an integral part of the Russian nation, not to mention economically important. But some still see this as favouritism and argue that if we are proposing a Minister of Ukrainian Matters, we might as well have a minister for every autonomy - so where does it end?\n\nSome also see this as excessive bureaucratisation. The autonomies exist for a reason, they say, so there's no reason to concede even more to our minorities. Should we give it time and effort, surely the protests will calm down on their own."
 russia.1105.a: "Makes sense."
 russia.1105.b: "We can't play favourites."

 russia.1106.t: "Kharkov, the City of Liberation"
 russia.1106.d: "In January 1879, Boris Viktorovich Savinkov was born in the city of Kharkov. The legend tells of the Vozhd hailing from a Russified Ukrainian Cossack family of Savyn, ancestry that almost prophetically symbolises the Vozhd as a man who reunited Russia and Ukraine in eternal union. This background of the wild steppe is the root of Savinkov's great will and energy.\n\nKharkov was among the first cities to be liberated from German control at the start of the Great Patriotic War. It symbolised the first step in the liberation of all of Holy Rus' from the Teutonic grip. To celebrate this, a great statue has been erected on the bank of the Kharkov river, named 'The Vozhd the Liberator', designed by a promising young sculptor, Aleksey Fyodorovich Popov. This bronze Savinkov in military uniform and long overcoat is looking to the west defiantly, boldly challenging Russia's enemies.\n\nThe unveiling of 'The Vozhd the Liberator' also saw a massive rally of the party in Kharkov and an armoured parade through the city, with Savinkov making his first visit to Ukraine at the same time. Residents of Kharkov will surely love their new statue."
 russia.1106.a: "He did always love his own face."

 russia.1107.t: "With Russia or with Communism"
 russia.1107.d: "A media campaign was launched in Ukraine and some other border regions, focusing on the evils of socialism in the West. A lot of space was given to interviews and writings of Western anti-socialist dissidents. There were horrifying stories of terrible conditions under socialist regimes. Some texts were even taken from socialists, like Eric Blair, who have been harsh critics of the syndicalist systems.\n\nThis campaign seeks to portray the West as morally decadent, chaotic, and arbitrary, drawing many similarities between the Bolsheviks and the ruling 'mobs' of Paris and London, laying siege to 'old Western cultures' and crushing cathedrals to the ground. They are contrasted with stories of Ukrainian and Belarusian soldiers who fought bravely against the Reds twenty years ago.\n\nAll in all, the campaign's purpose seems clear: if you have to choose between communism and Russia, at least in Russia you can own your own farm."
 russia.1107.a: "So true!"

 russia.1108.t: "Mass Protests in Ukraine"
 russia.1108.d: "Even if not all Ukrainians are part of resistance movements, the majority of them have little love for Moscow. This sporadically bursts out as protests and strikes, often provoked by the actions of the Russian police or the army.\n\nRight now, a new wave of protests has been sparked in Ukraine after arrests seen as unjust. The protestors are demanding an end to police violence and respect for their political rights."
 russia.1108.a: "Try to avoid escalations."
 russia.1108.b: "The more arrests, the better."

 russia.1109.t: "Fighting in the Ukrainian Territories"
 russia.1109.d: "Another series of shootouts happened in Ukraine, instigated by the USNS guerrilla fighters against a Russian military convoy. The separatist forces were largely former Ukrainian soldiers fighting under reasonably professional tactics.\n\nThey were able to block the path of the column of trucks and armoured cars and seize much of their armaments. Next time it will not happen."
 russia.1109.a: "Curses."

 russia.1110.t: "Ukrainian Military District Commander Assassinated"
 russia.1110.d: "The commander of the Ukrainian military district was ambushed in an attack by the Armed Forces of the League of Ukrainian Nationalists.\n\nFurther details are unclear, except that the attack took place in a local village near Rivne, but he was rushed to the hospital and died the next morning. A state funeral has been arranged, and an operation to avenge his murder has been carried out."
 russia.1110.a: "Oh no!"

 russia.1111.t: "Campaign of Passive Resistance Across Ukraine"
 russia.1111.d: "A number of Ukrainian dissidents marched into the streets carrying protest signs and blocking roads, advocating for looser laws, greater freedom for the Ukrainian Autonomy, and more, with some even advocating restored independence."
 russia.1111.a: "Accept some of the demands."
 russia.1111.b: "Use force."
 russia.1111.c: "Ignore it."

 russia.1112.t: "Socialist Agitation"
 russia.1112.d: "It's no wonder that, with the International being our main enemy, the Ukrainian resistance movement has been infested with socialist rhetoric.\n\nThe exiled government of the Ukrainian Socialist Republic, currently residing in Paris, has been calling on Ukrainians to resist the 'occupying force', and weapons have been smuggled in from socialist countries to assist the most powerful socialist groups, most notably the Borotbysts."
 russia.1112.a: "Accursed communists."

 russia.1113.t: "Elections in Ukraine"
 russia.1113.d.1: "The mood of the election was apathetic, with very low voter turnout. Still, electoral campaigns were reasonably orderly. There was both the election of the Gubernial Dumas and the Ukrainian Soym, which serves as the highest body of the autonomy. In turn, the Soym elects the Commissar of the autonomy and his government, which act as the executive branch in Ukrainian local matters.\n\nDe jure the Ukrainian Soym has the right to legislate within the boundaries of Russian Federal law and generally run the civilian affairs of the autonomy. However, there are doubts about how much the Kremlin will respect this autonomy.\n\nThe elections were tough. The Federative-Democrats and smaller social democratic groups were largely victorious in Western Ukraine and many cities, in addition to peasant lists. The strongest region for the National Bloc was the east and the south. The ultimate victor is..."
 russia.1113.d.2: "The mood of the election was apathetic, with very low voter turnout, worsened by the division of Ukraine. Still, electoral campaigns in both the Ukrainian and Novorussian Autonomies were reasonably orderly. There were both the election of the Gubernial Dumas and the parliaments of autonomies, which serve as the highest body of the autonomies. In turn, the parliaments elect the Commissars of the autonomies and their governments, which act as the executive branch in local matters.\n\nDe jure the autonomy has the right to legislate within the boundaries of Russian Federal law and generally run the civilian affairs of the autonomy. However, there are doubts about how much the Kremlin will respect this autonomy.\n\nPolitical differences between the two halves are clear. In the Ukrainian Autonomy, the Federative-Democrats won a great landslide, bolstered by peasant lists, social democratic groups, and SRs. The vote became a silent protest against the division of Ukraine, and a stand against the Kremlin.\n\nMeanwhile, in the east, Novorussian elections ended with a thin majority for the National Bloc, though the Federative-Democrats and SRs made strong gains in cities."
 russia.1113.d.3: "The mood of the election was apathetic, with very low voter turnout, worsened by the division of Ukraine. Still, electoral campaigns were reasonably orderly. There was both the election of the Gubernial Dumas and the Ukrainian Soym, which serves as the highest body of the autonomy. In turn, the Soym elects the Commissar of the autonomy and his government, which act as the executive branch in Ukrainian local matters.\n\nDe jure the Ukrainian Soym has the right to legislate within the boundaries of Russian Federal law and generally run the civilian affairs of the autonomy. However, there are doubts about how much the Kremlin will respect this autonomy. In the eastern side, outside the autonomy, Ukrainian gubernias merely have their own elected Gubernial Dumas, like any other Gubernia in Russia.\n\nIn the Ukrainian Autonomy, the Federative-Democrats won a great landslide, bolstered by peasant lists and SRs. The vote became a silent protest against the division of Ukraine, and a stand against the Kremlin.\n\nIn the east, turnout was far lower, but the Federative-Democrats won much of the local seats, with the National Bloc doing poorly outside a few regions. These Federative-Democrats dominated the Gubernial Dumas and promise to fight for eventual increased autonomy."
 russia.1113.a: "Federative-Democrats win a landslide."
 russia.1113.b: "National Bloc form the government."
 russia.1113.c: "Perhaps division keeps things calm."
 russia.1113.e: "This doesn't look good."

 russia.1115.t: "Protests Against the Frontier Wars"
 russia.1115.d: "Russian newspapers have generally avoided talking about the fighting going on in rural Ukraine and Belarus, often just referred to as the vague 'situation at the frontier'. However, at this point, it is impossible not to notice, as hundreds of thousands of men are involved in this 'peace-keeping' across Ukraine, Belarus, and other Liberated Territories. Despite the low intensity, there is a constant stream of wooden caskets coming back to the cemeteries in Russia.\n\nThere were major protests today, especially in regions where many men are still mobilised, arranged by both left-wing pacifists, Christian pacifists, and simply family members of the fallen soldiers. They demand more transparency from the military and a swift solution to the conflict, stopping the 'constant bleeding of Young Russia'."
 russia.1115.a: "Not like we can do much."
 russia.1115.b: "Increase censorship."

 russia.1116.t: "The Kharkov Trials"
 UKR_kharkiv_trials_intro: "Despite the number of officials from the now-defunct Ukrainian government who fled or are in hiding, we managed to capture and hold in custody several high-ranking Ukrainian statesmen during the war against Germany. Those still remaining shall be brought to justice eventually, but for now, specially arranged trials, meant to dampen the USNS's morale and bolster our support in the Ukrainian regions, are now taking place."
 russia.1116.d1: "$UKR_kharkiv_trials_intro$\n\nTaking place at the Opera Theatre in Kharkov, there are many accused: high-ranking politicians like Mykola Mikhnovskyi, Ivan Poltavets-Ostrianytsia, and others, most notably the Hetman himself, Pavlo Skoropadskyi, are being charged with various crimes. The prosecutor levied charges of anti-Russian activity, crimes against peace, treason, and violence against the Ukrainian people.\n\nIn his defence, Skoropadskyi claimed that none of what he had done was illegal and that he was simply following constitutional law. Few in Russia have sympathy for him, however, as he is seen as a mutinous traitor, and he is not said to be particularly popular in Ukraine either. Harshly punishing these agitators for their crimes against the Ukrainian people could be a way to win popular support, but some have advocated for a lesser sentence, believing that the death penalty would only martyr Skoropadskyi and his cronies."
 russia.1116.d2: "$UKR_kharkiv_trials_intro$\n\nTaking place at the Opera Theatre in Kharkov, there are many accused: high-ranking politicians such as Opanas Fedenko, Viacheslav Prokopovych, as well as military high command personnel such as Roman Dashkevych and Petro Diachenko. The prosecutor levied charges of anti-Russian activity and crimes against peace.\n\nUnfortunately, the trial hasn't seemed to live up to its purpose. The accused skillfully defended themselves from the accusations, and evidence against the Republican officials has failed to prove anything meaningful. In comparison to Skoropadskyi's regime, they seem to at least have genuine popular support in Ukraine, and coverage of the trial has been somewhat sympathetic to them. Without more specific details, the accusations that they 'plotted with foreign powers against the Ukrainian people' have mostly fallen flat.\n\nThe case now seems unsalvageable, and execution of the accused seems that it will only lead to martyrdom and further resistance. Trying to censor information about the trial may be our best bet - as long as the news doesn't break, of course."
 russia.1116.d3: "$UKR_kharkiv_trials_intro$\n\nTaking place at the Opera Theatre in Kharkov, there are many accused: high-ranking politicians such as Mykola Stsiborskyi, Yakiv Moralevych, as well as military high command personnel such as Andrii Melnyk and Mykola Kapustianskyi. The prosecutor levied charges of anti-Russian activity, crimes against peace, plotting with foreign powers, war crimes, and more.\n\nThe accused have been unable to gain much sympathy in Ukraine besides those with connections to the LUN. Many in Ukraine who lived under its regime remembered it unfavourably due to the widespread suppression of the Russian language and violence against any who disagreed with the LUN's actions. It does not help the LUN's case that its members came into power not long before the war in Europe began, and thus its regime is associated with the hardships that came with it. Furthermore, there is unmistakable evidence of atrocities against Russian-speaking Ukrainians, Poles, and Crimean Tatars, among others.\n\nIn the end, they are all guilty, and the rather apathetic attitude towards them outside of the trial has led to many recommending the death penalty for most."
 russia.1116.d4: "$UKR_kharkiv_trials_intro$\n\nTaking place at the Opera Theatre in Kharkov, there are many accused, but the most notable is Oleksandr Shumskyi himself. Though known as the leader of the Borotbysts, he is now known worldwide for being something greater: something of a second Gavrilo Princip, as it was under his regime and actions that led Europe to blows. The prosecutor has levied several charges towards Shumskyi and other Borotbysts, such as anti-Russian activity, crimes against peace, plotting with foreign powers to destroy Ukraine, and incitement of revolution.\n\nIt is difficult to say whether Shumskyi has many supporters in Ukraine. After all, decades of corrupt governments, both by the Hetman and the Republicans who came after, have left many uninterested in politics. Furthermore, decades of propaganda against the Third Internationale and socialism in general have created an unsympathetic attitude towards the Borotbysts.\n\nThe trial seems to have more significance outside of Ukraine than in it, and many have cautioned against a harsh sentence. It is not a question of whether they deserve it - if it were not for geopolitics, we would have them all shot - but it is what it is. Should we execute them, it may inspire the USNS to search for greater support from the Third Internationale, which already hosts a socialist Ukrainian government in exile."
 russia.1116.a: "Let's be lenient."
 russia.1116.b: "Make an example out of them!"

 russia.1117.t: "Position of the Ukrainian and Belarusian Language"
 russia.1117.d: "The Ukrainian and Belarusian languages have seen a considerable increase in usage ever since they became independent states. At this point, Russian has become the secondary language in these autonomies. Naturally, this will be reversed at least somewhat, with Russian once again becoming more relevant in the day-to-day lives of Ukrainians and Belarusians. However, in terms of actual governance, this question has become rather important.\n\nPerhaps we should consider making these languages co-official in their respective homelands - or, to encourage the day-to-day use of Russian, make Russian the sole official language."
 russia.1117.a: "Allow their usage in local government."
 russia.1117.b: "Russian will always be the primary language."

 russia.1120.t: "The Ukrainian Uprising"
 russia.1120.d: "The tension has boiled over, and Ukrainian resistance is at an all-time high. In Rivne - where the centre of Republican agitation first took arms against the Hetmanist regime - Yuri Tiutiunnyk, leader of the USNS, declared that Ukraine is not yet lost and vowed to fight alongside the Internationale to restore Ukrainian sovereignty.\n\nThe local garrison was quickly overwhelmed, with Tiutiunnyk's forces taking over large parts of the rural west."
 russia.1120.a: "Is there no end to strife?"

 ### Belarus Events

 russia.1124.t: "The Delatinisation"
 russia.1124.d: "Besides the Baltics, it can be argued that White Russia suffered the greatest from German occupation culturally. The Germans went to great lengths to try to separate it from the triune Russian nation - and in perhaps one of the worst crimes of this separation, the Minsk government even went as far as to Latinise the Belarusian language. Mass literacy programmes were also carried out with the limited funding that was available, leading to more widespread use of the language itself, and thus its Latin alphabet.\n\nThere can be no question of what is necessary. The local Belarusian government's Executive Committee has decreed a return to Cyrillic as the official script of the Belarusian language, which it was for centuries until the German occupation. While in the short term the reintroduction of Cyrillic may come with its difficulties, it is a worthy price to pay. We cannot afford a separate and anti-Russian Belarusian identity to form again - they are to be forever part of our union."
 russia.1124.a: "The mistakes of the past shall be corrected."

 russia.1125.t: "Recovered Northwestern Gubernias"
 russia.1125.d: "The land of White Russians, Belarus, is the heartland of Slavic tribes, populated by them from time immemorial. The Russian army has freed our kin there from under the Prussian boot, though not everyone seems grateful - it is Belarus where Germanic propaganda went the furthest, even to Latinise their language to sever them from their roots.\n\nNow that order has been restored, we must make a long-term decision on how the Belarusian lands will be governed. Collaborator groups, like Stanisław Bułak-Bałachowicz's Union of Liberation of Belarus - which has emerged as the chief pro-Russian organisation in the country during the war - are pushing for the establishment of a Belarusian Autonomy, though ultimately we can choose to simply assimilate the Belarusian gubernias into Russia like any other Russian gubernia."
 russia.1125.a: "Create a Belarusian Autonomy under General-Governor Bułak-Bałachowicz."
 russia.1125.b: "Create a Belarusian Autonomy under a democratically elected government."
 russia.1125.c: "Integrate the Belarusian gubernias directly."

 russia.1126.t: "Elections in Belarusian Autonomy"
 russia.1126.d: "Most of the old parties of Belarus have collapsed or are in open resistance, and one can see that much of Belarus is apathetic to its new overlords. As the elections of the autonomy were announced, political life was suddenly reawakened, starting with the formation of new political parties.\n\nOut of the ashes of the BSDP, which dominated much of the Belarusian political scene, has risen Mikola Abramčyk's Belarusian Party of Social-Federalists (BPSF). The party stands for the continuation of people's democracy in Belarus, pacifism and social programmes, and the defence of people's freedom together with Russian left-wing parties. On the right, Bułak-Bałachowicz's bid failed to become head of a united right-wing group. Instead, former general Hasan Kanapatski has risen into prominence as the main conservative voice calling Belarusians to accept the new realities; instead of pointlessly resisting, focus on rebuilding the country. Around him, the centre-right Belarusian Democratic Union (BDS) has been formed."
 russia.1126.a: "The Social-Federalists form the government."
 russia.1126.b: "The Democratic Union forms the government."

 russia.1127.t: "Belarusian Resistance"
 russia.1127.d: "Marshes and woods prove to be perfect for guerrilla warfare, as we already saw during the wartime occupation. Resistance in Belarus is largely directed by Vacłaŭ Łastoŭski's ultranationalist organisation 'Green Oak', which has grown beyond its pre-war political fringe. Our intelligence has also identified Internationale-backed partisans led by Kanstancin Jezavitaŭ, who may become a greater threat in the long term due to their foreign support. These groups have been trying to coordinate efforts with the Ukrainian resistance, as both operate especially strongly from the Pinsk marshes."
 russia.1127.a: "We will handle it."

 russia.1128.t: "Ataman of Belarus"
 russia.1128.d: "In a short time, Belarusian General-Governor Stanisław Bułak-Bałachowicz has become an infamous figure. He has always been a man of great energy and will, making his own way outside established parties or even nationalities. After the occupation of Belarus by Russian forces, he has made a full turn and given his organisation - the Union of Liberation of Belarus - for the use of the Russian military administration. This union is largely composed of Belarusian veterans who fought against Germany and the Bolsheviks, and many of them have Polish or Russian descent.\n\nNow as the general-governor, he and his government, led by Cimafiej Chviedčenia, are running Belarus as an increasingly personalistic regime. Propaganda portrays Bułak-Bałachowicz - the 'Ataman of Belarus' - as the only safeguard of Belarusian self-rule, the only man who has the ability and gravitas to negotiate with the Kremlin. Politically, the SVB runs an opportunistic programme of social conservatism, social reforms, and anti-socialism."

 ### Baltic Events

 russia.1130.t: "The Future of the Baltic Gubernias"
 russia.1130.d: "Out of all places, in the Baltic countries it can be said that we Russians are - if not welcomed - at least preferred over the Baltic German rule. We have built up some goodwill among the Estonians and the Latvians, thanks to our support for their guerrilla war against the Germans. Both of their governments in exile have also been operating out of Russia, and the Dvinsk Autonomy was largely formed to appeal to them: Free Latvia in Free Russia, as the SZRS' slogan declared.\n\nIn practice, this does mean that while it would seem hypocritical to deny the Balts their freedom (even though that term has some flexibility), they also are not in a position to oppose us. We must choose whether we are allowing them to keep their own nations, integrate them into [RUS.GetNameDef] as autonomies, or merely as commissarial gubernias."
 russia.1130.a: "Grant the Baltics autonomy."
 russia.1130.b: "Keep them as commissarial gubernias."

 russia.1131.t: "The Future of Russia's Baltic Allies"
 russia.1131.d: "Our relationship with our Baltic allies has always been a rocky one. The alliance between our two states was largely a pragmatic one, aimed at the Germans, and they have held a great deal of independence up until this point.\n\nWith the German threat eradicated, perhaps it is time that we make clear that this privileged relationship was temporary, and exert more control over our Baltic allies."
 russia.1131.a: "Of course. Send an ultimatum their way."
 russia.1131.b: "This is unnecessary."

 russia.1132.t: "Russian Ultimatum"
 russia.1132.d: "Today the Russian ambassador to our country has relayed an ultimatum, demanding that our government host a number of Russian advisors and allow a permanent military presence in our country. This would essentially make us a Russian client state.\n\nWe frankly have little choice in the matter - should we accept?"
 russia.1132.a: "There is nothing we can do."
 russia.1132.b: "Freedom or death!"

 russia.1133.t: "[FROM.GetNameDef] Accepts"
 russia.1133.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government has accepted our demands, making our ultimatum successful."
 russia.1133.a: "Good."

 russia.1134.d: "Foolishly, the [FROM.GetAdjective] government has refused our ultimatum. No matter, as we will overrun their country in no time."
 russia.1134.a: "This shouldn't take long."

 russia.1135.t: "The Forest Brothers Rise Again"
 russia.1135.d.latvia: "As it turns out, it is hard to pacify the partisan movement we first armed and trained ourselves. Not everyone in the Baltic provinces was happy with Russian annexation of the region.\n\nIn Latvia, the Russian administration has put itself on the back foot, finding broad support only in Dvinsk and Riga. In the countryside around them, General Jānis Kurelis' Forest Brothers have re-started hostilities. They have denounced the Kremlin for their 'lies to the Latvian people' and are demanding Latvian self-determination, the withdrawal of Russian administrators, and putting Latvians in charge of Latvia. In response, those Baltic Germans who have remained in the country are largely throwing their loyalties behind the Russians."
 russia.1135.d.estonia: "As it turns out, it is hard to pacify the partisan movement we first armed and trained ourselves. Not everyone in the Baltic provinces was happy with Russian annexation of the region.\n\nIn Estonia, General Paul-August Lilleleht's resistance movement has restarted its struggle against the Russians, focusing around Võru and other parts of forested southeastern Estonia. They have proclaimed they will continue the struggle against the 'illegal occupation' until the Kremlin recognises Estonian rights and allows them to elect their own government with sovereign power over Estonia."

 russia.1136.t: "Resistance Spreads to Lithuania"
 russia.1136.d: "Lithuania is in flames, like the rest of our frontier. Despite our earlier support for the Lithuanian Activist Front, the movement has now split, giving birth to the Combat Union of Lithuania. Led by General Kazys Škirpa, the new organisation draws support largely from Lithuanian nationalists.\n\nThe Poles and Belarusians of the region have been more supportive - or rather, more apathetic - towards the Russian administration. Still, the forests of Lithuania provide favourable terrain for a resistance movement."
 russia.1136.a: "Don't you see your efforts are futile?"

 ### Caucasus Events

 russia.1150.t: "Future of the North Caucasus"
 russia.1150.d: "The Special Caucasus Autonomous Area (OSKAB) has been finally abolished after two decades of failures. This system of regional autonomy was often dysfunctional and corrupt, where groups like Terek Cossacks and Ossetians utilised it as a means of control, while Chechens and the Ingush never really had the freedom they wished. But the question is - what will the new system be like?\n\nThe closest to the current system would be the North Caucasian Mountain Autonomy (SEKAVKAB). Terek will be detached from the polity, which will only include the Mountaineer peoples, who each have their own sub-autonomy under the SEKAVKAB's elected government.\n\nWe could also cut the middle level altogether, and create a number of smaller bodies: Chechen Autonomy, Ingush Autonomy, Ossetian Autonomy, Alan Autonomy, and so on. This does have the risk of increasingly unequal development of the region. Finally, we could simply make these regions commissarial gubernias just like many other minority regions of Russia - a normal gubernia where locals have a degree of local democracy to handle their own business."
 russia.1150.a: "Form a North Caucasian Autonomy."
 russia.1150.b: "Form separate national autonomies."
 russia.1150.c: "Merely turn them into commissarial gubernias."

 russia.1152.t: "Future of the South Caucasus"
 russia.1152.d.szrs: "Once again Russian rule spans both sides of the Caucasus Mountains, and the great city of Tbilisi has been restored to our grasp. Even in the centuries of the Caucasus Viceroyalty that Russia governed the region, it was never truly peaceful, and it would be naive to assume these mountains and valleys would easily submit.\n\nRegardless, a new order has arrived with the tracks of T-34s. General Issa Pliyev, a talented Ossetian and an ally of the SZRS, has been appointed as the Commander of the newly-formed South Caucasus Military District, tasked with pacification of the region. We are already recruiting locals sympathetic to the SZRS to staff administrative bodies, and they seem to have their hopes up for carving Caucasian autonomies led by collaborators."
 russia.1152.d.dem: "Once again Russian rule spans both sides of the Caucasus Mountains, and the great city of Tbilisi has been restored to our grasp. Even in the centuries of the Kavkaz Viceroyalty that Russia governed the region, it was never truly peaceful, and it would be naive to assume these mountains and valleys would easily submit.\n\nRegardless, a new order has arrived with the tracks of T-34s. General Markian Popov has been appointed as the Commander of the newly-formed South Caucasus Military District, tasked with pacification of the region. As military occupation is gradually lifted and civilian administration restored, the populace is awakening to a new reality. Most of the political establishment has been destroyed due to them being anti-Russian, and the administration is largely leveraging the apathetic mood in the region. A number of new 'federalist' parties have risen to organise political life, and lobby for greater autonomy."
 russia.1152.a: "South Caucasus will have its autonomies."
 russia.1152.b: "Turn them into gubernias."

 russia.1153.t: "The Mountain War"
 russia.1153.d: "Has there been any mountain range in history that has demanded more Russian blood than the great Caucasus? Our sons have bled on both sides of the mountains, be it against Ingushetians, Chechens, Georgians, Azeris... rugged mountain terrain gives resistance groups the perfect land to wage their hopeless but tenacious war from.\n\nThe Russian military can maintain an iron grip over the roads and cities, but the guerrillas, operating far from the mountains, will always disappear into the land before they can be destroyed. Only a slow, tiresome, and bloody fight remains."
 russia.1153.a: "Clear them out, slowly and methodically."
 russia.1153.b: "Focus more on sympathies of the people."
 russia.1153.c: "The North Caucasus is proof that this can work!"

 russia.1154.t: "Government of Georgia"
 russia.1154.d: "Now that Georgia has been stabilised, a civilian administration must be established. Our best bet would be to utilise some of the more apolitical bureaucrats who previously served under the Menshevik regime, as they have plenty of experience working in Georgia."
 russia.1154.d.szrs: "Now that Georgia has been stabilised, a civilian administration must be established. Thankfully, some of the local nationalists, with our blessing, have founded a local branch of the SZRS, led by Aleksandre Manvelishvili, a young and charismatic scholar. Until recently, Manvelishvili has been a fairly minor figure in Georgian politics, a former member of Tetri Giorgi dissatisfied with its monarchist leanings.\n\nCurrently, the local branch of the SZRS is facing numerous issues due to Russian rule being extremely unpopular in the region, an issue that'll hopefully soon be resolved."
 russia.1154.d.solonevich: "Now that Georgia has been stabilised, a civilian administration must be established. Thankfully, members of the local monarchist organisation known as the Union of Georgian Traditionalists have offered their assistance in establishing it. Namely, a prominent businessman, Giorgi Machabeli, backed by General Shalva Maghlakelidze, took on the duties of the local administrator.\n\nMachabeli, a famous monarchist who had previously tried to establish a monarchy in Georgia in 1917-18, also has the backing of some of the local right-wing elements and military figures, making him perfect for the role."
 russia.1154.d.dem: "Now that Georgia has been stabilised, a civilian administration must be established. The best way to do so would be through elections, and some of the smaller pre-existing parties have voiced their readiness to cooperate with the Russian government. This leaves two major parties that would compete in the upcoming elections: the Socialist-Federalist Party and the Georgian National Party.\n\nThe Socialist-Federalist Party is one of the oldest parties in Georgia, formed in 1904 for the purpose of federating the Russian Empire and creating a Georgian autonomy within a democratic socialist framework. They were a smaller, but still influential party in the Democratic Republic of Georgia, working closely with the Mensheviks. Now, with the Social-Democratic Party in shambles, the Federalists were the first to declare their loyalty towards us and have gained significant influence due to several members of the Social-Democratic and the Social-Revolutionary parties defecting to them. The party once again runs on a liberal socialist platform, federalism, as well as the protection of Georgia's local ethnic minorities.\n\nThe Georgian National Party was previously a splinter of the National-Democrats, briefly separating from them in 1918 due to personal animosities, only to rejoin them in 1921. With the annexation of Georgia, their leader Grigol Veshapeli has once again split from the rest of the National-Democrats and rallied the pro-Russian right around him. The party is mostly liberal conservative, influenced by the ideas of the late Ilia Chavchavadze, while also incorporating elements of agrarianism and civic nationalism."
 russia.1154.d.monarchy: "Now that Georgia has been stabilised, a civilian administration must be established. While there's no doubt that we must hold elections, there's the question of the Georgian crown. While previously it belonged to the Tsar of Russia, crowning a member of the royal house of Bagrationi would certainly be a more endearing option for the Georgians.\n\nCurrently, the Georgian throne is disputed between the Mukhraneli and Gruzinsky branches of the royal house. The Gruzinsky branch is directly descended from the last king of Georgia, but Irakli Bagration-Mukhraneli is a close friend of Tsar Vladimir and thus was chosen as the candidate under the regnal name Erekle III."

The Gruzinsky branch is directly descended from the last king of Georgia, and as such, young Petre Bagration-Gruzinsky was chosen as the candidate under the regnal name Petre I."
 russia.1154.d.monarchy.solonevich: "Now that Georgia has been stabilised, a civilian administration must be established. While there is significant resistance to our rule, the Union of Georgian Traditionalists, a local monarchist organisation, has moved to support us. The organisation, led by Prince Giorgi Machabeli, has previously envisioned a Georgian kingdom not too dissimilar to our own People's Monarchy, and as such, Machabeli was appointed as the local administrator.\n\nWhile happy with his role, Machabeli has expressed his concerns that the Georgian people would not take yet another annexation lying down. Citing the terms 1783 Treaty of Georgiyevsk, he proposed crowning a member of the royal house of Bagrationi, and establishing an autonomous Kingdom of Georgia within our Empire. The royal house itself is split between two cadet branches, the Gruzinsky and the Mukhraneli, both of which claim to be the rightful heirs to the throne. The Union of Traditionalists is backing the Mukhraneli, and Tsar Vladimir himself has friendly relations with members of said branch. Thus, if we go through with this proposal, Irakli Bagration-Mukhraneli shall be crowned as King of Georgia under the regnal name Erekle III.\n\nMany within Russian monarchist circles are unwilling to accept such a proposal. The crown of Georgia historically belonged to the Tsar after 1801, and members of the Mukhraneli branch have never been Kings of Georgia. On the other hand, crowning a Bagrationi would definitely legitimise our rule in the region."

As such, the local elections to the Georgian National Council and the Gubernial Duma have failed to gather a significant level of voter turnout.\n\nMany prominent figures within Georgia view parties participating in it as traitors, stoking the fires further. Still, the elections were held without any interruption, and the results are in. The majority of the seats were gained by..."

 ## Constituent Assembly event chain
 ruselections.1.t: "Formation of the Third All-Russian Constituent Assembly"
 ruselections.1.d: "'Citizens of Russia. The brave Russian Army, under the command of General-Fieldmarshal [RUS_GetArmyChief], is maintaining order while a smooth transition to stability and normal civic life is ensured after these dark years. Martial law will stay in place for your own safety.\n\nAs I, representing the entire Provisional Government, am making this statement from the Senate Palace, we are gathering the democratically elected representatives of the 1934 elections, not counting those deemed traitors to the Russian people. They, alongside legal experts from the Supreme Court, will begin amending the Constitution of the Russian Democratic Federative Republic to remove the perversions that the late president's regime inflicted upon it. The work of the Third All-Russian Constituent Assembly will be swift but wise. God helps us.\n\nIn a month or two, all of Russia will be taking part in free elections that will, hopefully, restore normalcy to our nation.'\n\n- Chairman of the Provisional Council of Ministers [GetSecondInCommand]"
 ruselections.1.a: "Let us get to work."
 ruselections.1.tt: "We shall promulgate a §Ynew Russian constitution§!. Click on the decision tab and choose at least §Y6§! articles to be enshrined in the constitution, all while ensuring that a majority of the factions, as well as the §PMilitary§!, approves of the new document. The decisions we take will have §Yfuture consequences§!."

 ruselections.2.t: "[RUS_GetArmyChief] Speaks"
 ruselections.2.d.denikin: "After opening the first session of the Constituent Assembly by Provisional Chairman-Minister Maklakov, the Peasant Marshal himself rose onto the podium to address the two hundred members of the Assembly. Denikin wasn't a great orator, but he had the undeniable gravitas of an angry grandfather.\n\nHe did not waste time on pleasantries and acknowledged that he is not a politician, and he does not care for the eternal debates of politicians. What he cared about, however, was that the new constitution would ensure long-term stability, would not touch the position of the army and - most importantly - 'any ideas that the more aristocratic gentlemen of this Assembly may have - such as turning the clock back to the time of tsarism and tyranny more fitting to Chinese vozhdism than the great Russian Republic - are not even considered to be options'.\n\nThe General-Fieldmarshal left the stage unceremoniously, receiving the greatest applause from the Kadets. It was clear to the politicians that while they could handle politics, the army would be the kingmaker."
 ruselections.2.d.wrangel: "After opening the first session of the Constituent Assembly by Provisional Chairman-Minister Golitsyn, the Black Baron himself rose onto the podium to address the two hundred members of the Assembly. Wrangel was a natural speaker, with quite a bit of politician in his blood. He thanked the Assembly for their important work for the nation but reminded them that ultimately the freedoms of the Russian people had only been saved by the watchful army.\n\nHowever, if there had been a monarch - even a relatively weak, constitutional one - holding the most prestigious position in the nation, bandits such as Savinkov could have never gained total power. While the General-Fieldmarshal avoided making any concrete demands of the Assembly, he made it clear that ultimately he is the kingmaker - or should we say, tsar-maker - and that he only wishes that the gentlemen of the Assembly can put their ideological fervour behind them and act as rational statesmen, judging the best for the whole nation in view of what has happened during the past twenty years.\n\nThe applause was largely lukewarm outside of the right wing. The sword of the Black Baron hangs over the Assembly, expecting a monarchist restoration, and there seemed to be few other options."
 ruselections.2.a: "At least he is on our side."
 ruselections.2.b: "A constitution at sabre-point..."

 ruselections.3.t: "Crisis in the Kadet Faction"
 ruselections.3.d: "Wrangel's proclamation that the army expects a restoration of the monarchy was like a fist in the face for Russian liberals. The Socialist-Revolutionaries and the left almost immediately had a nervous breakdown, with Rikhter almost calling for a popular peasant uprising against 'that tsarist baron'. Only a small part of the SR party had been willing to adapt, but they were quickly silenced.\n\nThe Kadet Faction of the Assembly is numerous and could gain a majority together with the conservatives. But many of them are staunch republicans at this point, most vocally Nekrasov and Dolgorukov. Even if they could be persuaded towards a constitutional monarchy, the fact that the monarchist clique of the army is essentially forcing the Assembly to legitimise a monarchical restoration at gunpoint is wrong in principle for most.\n\nIn private, Golitsyn visited the group and pleaded with the Kadets to listen to reason. They would probably remain the strongest party in the monarchy regardless - especially if they could restore monarchy on their own terms and defang the more reactionary monarchists in the army. The right-Kadets like Kartashyov and Konovalov had even started to admit that there were some benefits to the Romanov restoration, arguing that it could create political stability.\n\nOne by one, the Kadets were swayed. Either by cold hard pragmatism, spineless ambition, or a genuine refound belief in constitutional monarchy, on the fourth day of the Assembly, a still hesitant Maklakov had found himself at the helm of a largely constitutional monarchist party."
 ruselections.3.a: "Amazing."
 RUS_kadets_swayed_to_monarchism: "The §mKadet Faction§! supports a monarchist restoration."

 ruselections.4.t: "The Constitutional Draft is accepted"
 ruselections.4.d: "The Third All-Russian Constituent Assembly has accepted the new Russian constitution after a lengthy debate. Even though it has not been ratified by the Duma, it is highly likely that the consensus holds, save for possible minor alterations.\n\nThe politicians and legal experts of the Assembly have given the constitutional draft to the interim government and resigned in unison, dissolving the body. Hopefully, their document will prove stronger against authoritarianism than its predecessor did."
 ruselections.4.a: "Better start preparing for the elections."

 ruselections.5.t: "The Gunpoint Constitution"
 ruselections.5.d: "Tired of the gridlock and constant debating by the Constituent Assembly, [GetSecondInCommand] was pushed by the military to give one last proposal, largely drafted by just them and their closest advisors, according to the wishes of [RUS_GetArmyChief]. The situation is clear: the Assembly has failed to come up with their own version, so the military-proposed version will be accepted.\n\nIt is relatively uncontroversial, largely focusing on a strong executive branch with an electoral system favouring the status quo parties, and allowing for the harsh suppression of both communist and Svobodnik parties. It is a tolerable compromise, even if the Assembly made it clear that they are not happy with such military meddling."
 ruselections.5.a: "Better start to prepare for the elections."

 ruselections.6.t: "The Speech of Dmitry Pavlovich Romanov"
 ruselections.6.d: "Later accounts would popularise Dmitry Romanov's speech to the Constituent Assembly as a deciding factor for the restoration of monarchy in Russia.\n\n'Honoured representatives of the Constituent Assembly. Let us consider a hypothetical scenario: if Russia had been a monarchy of sufficient authority in 1934, the parliamentary coup of the upjumped terrorist would not have become fait accompli. Instead, the emperor may have appointed an emergency government to deal with the threat, in cooperation with those who so proudly fought until the last.\n\nBut instead, this 'democratically elected' tyrant crushed all opposition after ascending to the highest office of the realm, not held by the emperor but the one who shouts the loudest. Only the brave actions of Baron Wrangel saved countless more lives from death and torture.\n\nAm I condoning the military coup? Without it, many of you, ladies and gentlemen, would be in hiding, arrested, or even dead. The Russian Republic was built with its brave Army as the first and the last line of defence, and all of us must admit that it worked - even if we had to go through terrible years first.\n\nI appeal to your reason, honoured representatives: let us not start another gamble. Democracy is a precious principle, yes, but it can also be hijacked for nefarious goals, and the army is obviously not the ideal safeguard against this. Can you see any better safeguard than the existence of a constitution-abiding Emperor, one with enough power to check any demagogue trying to gain power? Are you willing to gamble the future of our children in the hope that another madman does not rise into power through the abuse of our democratic system? Can we really afford to repeat our mistakes?\n\nEven if your heart is against the monarchy, listen to your reason, for in politics it is often who gets the last say.'"
 ruselections.6.a: "Well spoken."

 ruselections.10.t: "[RUS_GetArmyChief] Announces Elections"
 ruselections.10.d: "The Kremlin and its temporary occupant, General-Fieldmarshal [RUS_GetArmyChief], have made a much-expected announcement: elections, the first ones in what seems like an eternity, will be held in three months. Regardless of the election outcome, the state of emergency upheld by the military will be ended afterwards, and power will be fully transferred into the hands of the civilian government - though it is clear that [RUS_GetArmyChief] will maintain a large amount of influence behind the scenes.\n\nRussia's major parties are feverishly preparing, trying to fill their ranks, collect funding, and rebuild both their party machinery and their ideas. Everyone understands how important the [GetYear] election is going to be: unlike in a normal electoral cycle, where not every position is elected simultaneously, now all seats in both chambers of the Duma are up for grabs, and similarly all Gubernial Dumas. [ruselections.10.president]\nPerhaps this is another beginning for a new, better Russia."
 ruselections.10.a: "Democracy is restored!"
 ruselections.10.republic: "The Presidential Election will be held immediately afterwards, elected by both chambers of the Duma together."

 ruselections.11.t: "What Went Wrong in 1934?"
 ruselections.11.d.republic: "Party Conference of the Constitutional Democratic Union, Petrograd.\n\nAs former President and the man who lost to Savinkov, Vasily Maklakov opens the meeting; his opening words will sum up the most important question the nation has to answer if it wishes to avoid repeating history. What went wrong in 1934 when the tyrant Savinkov rose to power through largely legal means?\n\nThere are many failures of both the Kadets and SRs to be identified. They had embarked on an unwise war in the Far East, they had ignored the anger of the Russian poor, they had become complacent. Some point to close relations with Germany as their main failure, as Maklakov himself admits. Some Kadets, especially from the right wing, agreed with Professor Anton Kartashyov's claim that the SRs themselves created this devil, and call for the Kadet party to cooperate with the 'patriotic right' instead.\n\nMaklakov, having worked together with the bright left-Kadet Nikolay Nekrasov, presented his own views on what the party programme should be in the future. He maintains that Russia's decade of democracy is nothing to be ashamed of, and a lot was achieved to demolish the Tsarist foundations. The Kadets began as a party with the highest ideals of progressivism and freedom, and they must maintain that path, rather than merely be the 'responsible governors of Russia' they had become in the 1920s.\n\nWhile Maklakov's programme is definitely more to the liking of the party's left, he is an unquestioned leader and commands gravitas to set the course for the entire party as their political giant."

What went wrong in 1934 when the tyrant Savinkov rose to power through largely legal means?\n\nThere are many failures of both the Kadets and SRs to be identified. They had embarked on an unwise war in the Far East, they had ignored the anger of the Russian poor, they had become complacent. Some point to close relations with Germany as their main failure, as Maklakov himself admits.\n\nHowever, the day was stolen by an hour-long analysis by Professor Anton Kartashyov, leader of the Kadet right-wing, who played a major role in swaying the Kadet party into supporting the imperial restoration. In his speech, he paints a picture of a godless, secular, and chaotic republic, largely dictated by Socialist-Revolutionary populism both left and right, which trampled on good Russian virtues. To him, the time without a Tsar has been that of misery and chaos - a story anyone well-versed in Russian history should know. These new troubles will only end with political stability given by a monarch and a responsible party, such as the Kadets, in charge.\n\nIt must be admitted that the volkgeist of Russia at the moment seems to favour Kartashyov, and many Kadets would later describe the moment as if 'waking up from a nightmare'. Some still defended republicanism, but they were drastically outvoted by the conference, and Kartashyov was elected as the new president of the party."

 ruselections.12.t: "The Future of the Socialist-Revolutionaries"
 ruselections.12.d.republic: "The New Central Committee of the Socialist-Revolutionary Party is due to be elected at the party conference in Samara, called by the current Chairman Vladimir Rikhter. After the party leadership paid homage to the great memorial of the People's Army of Komuch, a civil war era pride of the party, they settled to debate the future of the party and their electoral tactics.\n\nTruth be told, Rikhter was pressured to arrange a conference quickly before the elections due to internal pressure. Sure, he opposed Savinkov to the end, and suffered for it in Siberian winters. But he was a hero of the circumstances, a dramatic martyr and symbol. He has never been known as the most policy-focused man. He is Chernov-at-home, a perfectly archetypical Socialist-Revolutionary. Of course, he assures that he will continue leading the party to glory, but has little to back it up beyond mere idealism.\n\nRikhter and his allies in the newspaper 'Will of Russia' have drafted a campaign for the Socialist-Revolutionary Party for the elections. With the slogan 'Back to the Land', it conveys the image of return to the Narodnik roots of the party: a combination of unfettered idealism and tireless work to improve rural Russia. The party should not focus on electoral scheming - leave it to the Kadets. The Socialist-Revolutionaries need to return to their roots and the villages.\nSuch a message did resonate with the party leaders, and solidified Rikhter's position somewhat as the chairman, leaving the party with a united direction for the election."

After the party leadership paid homage to the great memorial of the People's Army of Komuch, a civil war era pride of the party, they settled to debate the future of the party and their electoral tactics.\n\nTruth be told, Rikhter was pressured to arrange a conference quickly before the elections due to internal pressure. Sure, he opposed Savinkov to the end, and suffered for it in Siberian winters. He spoke the last free words in the State Duma before the tyrant took over. But he was a hero of the circumstances, a dramatic martyr and symbol. He has never been known as the most policy-focused man. He is Chernov-at-home, a perfectly archetypical Socialist-Revolutionary. And now, he is essentially calling for war against the monarchists.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the stance on monarchy became the dominant topic of debate. While the chairman insisted on total government boycott to pressure the Tsar to eventually abdicate because of political unrest, plenty of SRs were ready to accept the monarchy as a fait accompli - the relevant question now was how to reduce monarch's powers as much as possible.\n\nThe leader of these 'monarchist-revolutionaries', as their enemies mocked them, was Ilya Fondaminsky, an old and venerated SR. In Fondaminsky's mind, the good fight has been fought, but now the SRs must mature and adapt. Rikhter's great revolutionary slogans work when overthrowing dictators, but such idealistic fervour does not govern states. Instead, Fondaminsky suggests leaning more to the political centre and moderation, looking for the little people's welfare through sensible and cooperative means. Such a programme could surely open a path for the SRs to even become the Tsar's government, as ironic as the idea may sound."

It is a constant struggle against the Tsars, princes, generals and politicians. It is a struggle against the rich, the privileged, the exploiter! And in Russia, there is no end to exploiters.\n\nWhat do you think came to all the nationalised workplaces after the fall of the tyrant? We can assure you: they did not fall into the hands of the workers, but in the hands of the already privileged.\n\nDo you think the Denikins and Wrangels have the interest of the common man at heart? Do you think the Kadets care? And Rikhter's Socialist-Revolutionaries, who taint the good name of socialism, are firing empty promises at landowners they imagine as the poor toilers of Russia.\n\nRussian socialism is not concerned with politicking or corruption. Russian socialism is found in the strong hands of the Yakutian woodcutter, from the skilled young dockworkers of Petrograd. Instead of stealing, we build. Instead of destroying, we dream of something better.\n\nOnly we can change the course of Russian history.

 ruselections.14.t: "The Resurgent All-Russian Patriots"
 ruselections.14.d: "The Russian political right has been historically plagued by sneering at mass politics and relying on the Orthodox Church, the military and the state apparatus to maintain power. This has created a paradox of a deeply conservative nation with an electorally inefficient political right - in fact, it is often joked that the most successful conservative party in Russia is the liberal Kadet party, which enjoys large support from the conservative middle class largely concerned with stability and reliable governance.\n\nAfter Savinkov, the All-Russian Patriotic Party has filled much of the void on the right, winning back those lost to SZRS and SOR as the right-most major party in Russian politics. The current party chairman, Aleksandr Dmitriyevich Golitsyn, is a moderate character, a proponent of 'reasonable patriotism' and monarchism, who has opposed political violence and illegality at every turn. Golitsyn's leadership has often been backed by the VSZ (All-Russian Union of Landowners), veterans' organisations such as the Union of Volunteers, and the Orthodox Church.\n\nHowever, much of the party's current strength comes from the electrified grassroots movement of the so-called 'People's Patriots', a political movement around the Solonevich brothers. They seek to build a new Russian conservatism: one that is less aristocratic and elitist, a snub no doubt directed at Golitsyn. Ivan Lukyanovich Solonevich has already gathered a cult following, especially in the northern branches of the party, and is on a steady course to become the most popular politician in the VPP."

They are being harassed from the right by the VPP, which has managed to energise many nationalist students and is at their strongest in middle-class areas. On the left, there is a complex struggle between the two Socialist-Revolutionary parties fighting in the rural regions, and the two alongside the RDP in cities. All three have energetic grassroots campaigners touring the country.\n\nWhich party has the best start?"

Despite serious persecution under Savinkov's regime, there are now a good number of these socialist organisations largely operating on a local scale that are now fully legalised and seeking to make tactical electoral alliances with the RDP.\n\nNow that these anti-communist laws have been repealed, the rank and file of the RDP has moved much to the left, and its former RSDRP members have gained rather visible roles in the election campaigns. The potential allies include organisations like the General Jewish Labour Bund in Russia, the Muslim Workers' Party of Kazan, the Yakut Union of Labour, and a large number of smaller organisations. In addition, the Party of Left-Socialist-Revolutionaries has many socialists on their lists and seeks to cooperate in rural regions where they are admittedly stronger than us."

Titov's election marked a victory for the right wing of the Radical Democrats, who had been in opposition during much of the 1930s; at the time, the left wing under Vladimir Levitsky was in charge. Titov does not inspire great fervour, but he is considered a capable and reliable epitome of a Russian social democrat. Levitsky, on the other hand, is an old man of the RSDRP, whose faction has been constantly drifting the party leftwards towards their revolutionary roots.\n\nIn the pre-election party conference, however, there was a revolt against the right. The radicals around Daniil Sulimov, Levitsky's protégé, triggered a vote against Titov, seeking to put Levitsky in charge of the party once more. Due to the recent influx of more far-left candidates into the party as a consequence of cooperating with the far-left more, Sulimov had the votes to dethrone Titov. Levitsky was chosen as the new chairman with a narrow margin of votes, and the new central committee received a radical majority of one. The moderates seem to have accepted their loss for now, but they will no doubt be trying to stop the more revolutionary moves the party might take."

 ruselections.19.d: "'Who elected [RUS_GetArmyChief]?', ask the signs carried by the protestors who have gathered in the Red Square of Moscow. One of the most visible leaders of the protests has been Valentin Fyodorovich Bulgakov, a Christian anarchist and Tolstoyan pacifist. The march against the military has drawn all manners of people around the anarchists, including more socialist anarchists from the Society of Kropotkin, and even some more average socialists.\n\nThe main demands of the protestors are to free the political prisoners that the army arrested during the state of emergency, ending the state of emergency, and an end to army interference in politics. On a broader scale, it is a protest against the constantly escalating world situation and jingoistic rhetoric that many in the Russian officer corps have adopted.

Regardless, the socialist field organisation has always been very vibrant, based around the red islands of industry dotted across Russia, and extending far into the rural regions in the forms of sawmills and mines. The labour organisations have started very active electoral support campaigns, spreading leaflets and holding rallies.\n\nBoth the Radical-Democrats and the Left-Socialist-Revolutionaries are cooperating against the bourgeois parties in many regions, and have become far more emboldened than in the past. Many of the organisers can proudly claim to have stood up to Savinkov, and are riding on the still-existing discontent towards the establishment parties.\n\nIn some cases, the situation has become heated. In Petrograd, young men from the People's Monarchists have been destroying socialist posters. A radical veterans' organisation in Voronezh broke up an SR rally. A union meeting house in Ivanovo was burned. The police are generally keeping order, but the mood remains tense."

With their wealth to be spent on political campaigns, it is no surprise that the Kadets could maintain a larger share of the Duma seats than they 'should have', at least according to their critics.\n\nHowever, very few outside the left truly protested, because all of them have their own financial backers. Putting a temporary limit on this spending might reduce tensions and make the whole election seem fairer, especially to the left."

This so-called 'Right-Kadet' faction has, with time, dragged the entire party to the right - but also enabled the Kadet dominance of the centre-right.\n\nHowever, there has been some debate on the Kadets' approach. Continuing the course will certainly help the party against the more rightist and monarchist forces, but it may also bleed some more progressive voters to the Esers. Alternatively, returning to the Kadets' more progressive roots would certainly improve the reputation of the Kadets as defenders of Russian liberalism, but it would come at the expense of right-wing voters."

Despite formal unity during the interwar years, it was largely out of respect for Viktor Chernov's efforts to keep party unity, rather than genuinely burying the hatchet. And the naysayers in the Left-SRs, who have always opposed the right's more parliamentary direction, felt validated after Savinkov's regime, and cheered as the SRs were forced to 'return to their roots'.\n\nHowever, there are talks of a temporary electoral pact between the halves of the SR party, especially in regions dominated by the Radical-Democrats. The Left-Esers are requiring some political concessions from the Right-Esers in exchange, but their help would improve our chances in general."

The conservatives now seem to be using the image of the Romanovs to good use, from major cultural events in former palaces to even the endorsements of some metropolitans.\n\nIt genuinely seems like a new page has been turned, as, in the past, the conservatives sought to avoid too close a relationship with the controversial Romanov family in hopes of appealing to the liberals. But after Savinkov, all of this has changed, and 'Romanovstalgia' has become more and more common."

 ruselections.25.d: "In a recent court case, the Anti-Svodobnik Laws were successfully utilised to block a local SOR-aligned newspaper from publishing articles 'inciting anti-democratic hatred'. The case was contested in the Court of Appeals, but it seems like the Assembly for Russian Unification could legally be banned based on their association with the SZRS.\n\nThere is broad support for the party's ban, and some small protests in Moscow have flared up calling for the suppression of these 'Svobodnik bootlickers'. However, the right wing and even some liberals are generally defensive, if only to avoid the precedent of banning established political parties for vague reasons."

Kamkov's demagogic thesis is that the liberals and conservatives were quick to bend the knee for Savinkov - ultimately more concerned with their wealth than their freedom.\n\nMeanwhile, it was the proletariat who stood for democracy - and ultimately took up arms to overthrow the tyrant. Unfortunately, they say, the army stole the fruits of the revolution, but the coming elections give another chance for the Russian proletariat to rise up."

Many of these regions have traditionally voted for the Socialist-Revolutionary Party, but the grasp of the PSR has weakened a lot during the past decade.\n\nMany regions were even lost to the SZRS, and are now being eyed by many different parties. A tactical voting pact by the RDP and Kadets could dethrone the Socialist-Revolutionaries from many of these electoral districts."

Now, many of these people are trying to return to politics and their careers. Obviously, those who committed actual crimes during the Savinkov years have been tried, but it varies how we should see these 'prodigal sons' who opportunistically joined the SZRS and are now seeking to rejoin their old parties. Many even claim that they merely joined out of fear.\n\nHowever, tolerating them would mean that left-wing parties could also tolerate more and more far-left candidates, while we would be hypocrites to do anything about it. Perhaps both should be allowed?"

 ruselections.29.d: "The grassroots campaign of the All-Russian Patriotic Party has been intense and stronger than ever before, but it is not thanks to the old guard of the party. Instead, much of the party rank and file are more loyal to Ivan Solonevich, who gained a record vote in the traditionally left-liberal Petrograd. His campaign was built around his own 'People's Monarchist Movement', and many remembered well his shirtless appearances at sports events, and keen speeches at Petrograd University with full auditoriums. The party's decision to accept former Svobodniks not tried for any crimes has only bolstered this, and they have been swayed by Solonevich's populist and authoritarian rhetoric.\n\nThis has led Golitsyn and other 'aristocrats' of the party to have their authority challenged by the Solonevichs, whose allies, like Sergey Voytsekhovsky and Boris Suvorin, have gained control of much of VPP's party newspapers. These 'Solonevichites' have been pushing for the VPP to adopt a more populistic, 'modern' programme based on Solonevich's ideas, and even began pressuring Golitsyn to step down and make Solonevich the party's presidential candidate instead, or threaten to secede from the party.\n\nIn an emergency meeting by the party brass, it was ultimately decided to strike a deal - as Solonevich's popularity gives the party a genuine shot at the presidency. Golitsyn was comfortable that as long as the government is composed of more reliable statesmen, the president will be kept in check."

Still, a few in the Socialist-Revolutionaries and even Kadets share plenty of his idealistic visions.\n\nThe choice on who to coalesce with largely depends on which parts of Russian society we wish to appeal to; a coalition with the Esers might help improve our standing among the peasantry, while a coalition with the Kadets will bolster our popularity among the middle class and intellectuals."

Vasily Maklakov, once disgraced by the time Savinkov had come to power, is now at the helm of the republic again. He believes in restoring the liberal course of the 1920s republic. While a unifying figure, he still faces a largely apathetic party, so to convince them of his programme will be a tall task.\n\nAs for potential coalition partners, realistically the Kadets are able to work across the aisle - more progressive options, like working with Rikhter or Titov, are certainly more in line with Maklakov's vision, but some more right-Kadets view a coalition with the VPP as the most rational for a centrist government."

As a concession to the rest of the VPP, he was forced to make Golitsyn the Chairman-Minister; there is no doubt the two men dislike each other, and that they may work to undermine each other.\n\nOnly time will tell if Solonevich has the savviness needed to overcome the intransigence of his own party and the protests of the left."

[RUS.GetLeader] initially considered a Kadet-VPP government, but such a weak minority government was widely viewed as a terrible precedent for his constitutional rule. After long and tiresome negotiations, Ilya Isidorovich Fondaminsky-Bunakov agreed to the Emperor's request of taking the thankless job of forming the government.\n\nFondaminsky is perhaps uniquely situated for the task. He is a senior member of the SR party and has always represented the odd 'Christian-Democratic tendency' of the Right-SRs, despite being Jewish himself. Fondaminsky has sought to build bridges between the moderate SRs, conservative monarchists, and leaders of the Orthodox Church, always stressing the importance of Russia's agrarian nature and that true liberalism walks hand in hand with the moral virtues of the common people.\n\nAll this has allowed Fondaminsky to pull together an SR-Kadet government with a radical enough programme to ensure enough votes from the left without alienating the right too much. He is very much walking on eggshells, and not even his party is wholly behind him, but for now, he seems to have the strenuous approval of both the Duma and the Emperor.\nIn his opening speech to the Duma, he ended in his typical poetic way: 'The past of the Russian people is dark; their present is terrible, but they have a right to the future'."

In many ways, he is the heir of Pavel Milyukov. His programme stresses liberty and seeks to convince the Russian people of the monarchy through staying true to the February Revolution's promises of freedom.\n\nGronsky is a personal friend of Baron Wrangel and closer to many right-wing figures. He is a national liberal with emphasis on the national. Gronsky sees cooperation with the right as the easiest way to stabilise the nation, and believes that ultimately most Russians will accept a Russia that is strong and stable, be it led by a President or an Emperor."

 ruselections.40.t: "The Return of Russian Conservatism"
 ruselections.40.d: "After decades in opposition, the old conservative forces of the Russian Empire are again in power - and electorally, to everyone's surprise. Yes, the restoration of monarchy is still lauded by the opposition as a 'Wrangelite coup', but if not for the Black Baron, they would still be in a prison camp halfway to Kolyma. The electoral result has made the VPP the second-largest single party, capturing a majority of the right wing votes. Additionally, there is the SOR, the right wing of the Kadets, and a number of independents, like the unofficial Muslim Faction of the Duma, which are likely to rally behind a conservative government.\n\nThere are a couple of potential Chairman-Ministers being discussed behind the scenes. Prince Aleksandr Golitsyn is obviously a strong pick as the chairman of the VPP and a political veteran, but Doctor Georgy Vernadsky - a Eurasianist and a moderate conservative - may be able to find more allies from the Kadets and progressives. Prince Dmitry Romanov has also been suggested as an experienced statesman, even if he would rather avoid the idea of the Romanovs monopolising the seats of government. The maverick choice would be Ivan Solonevich, the VPP's vote king and rising star, who commands the People's Monarchist movement and has become the greatest proponent of 'modernising the Russian monarchy'.\n\nThe first two would be close to each other - predictable, stable, patriotic, and most importantly, supported by Baron Wrangel. But Solonevich and his 'People's Monarchy'... it would ruffle many feathers and drag Russia in an entirely new direction."
 ruselections.40.a: "Prince Golitsyn is an able statesman."
 ruselections.40.b: "Vernadsky has potential."
 ruselections.40.c: "What is this People's Monarchy?"

 ruselections.50.t: "The President's Grand Agenda!"
 ruselections.50.d: "While the President is a representative of his own party, they also have their own agendas and promises that they made during the election.\n\nIt will be a tall task to fulfil them, but to do so will mean putting our name in the history books and showing that the man in the highest office of the republic is capable."
 ruselections.50.a: "It shall be done."

 ruselections.51.d2: "Elections of the Russian Democratic Federative Republic are once again taking place.

 ### Democratic Russia Events
 demrus.1.t: "Small White Terror"
 demrus.1.d: "In the short period of newfound liberty during the downfall of Savinkov, those on top were reminded of just how widespread left-wing sentiment is among common Russians. In many places, smaller revolutions overthrew local Svobodnik-aligned leaders. The Ivanovo Soviet, the Uprising of the Petrograd Soviet, the Socialist Republic of Ingushetia, the Chelyabinsk Soviet... most of these uprisings are simply doomed to become minor pages of future dictionaries. Most of them stood down after the Provisional Government came into power, but not all.\n\nThose who did not accept the military ultimatum to abolish their improvised Red Guards were crushed militarily. T-28s rolled in the streets of the short-lived Soviets, with military police arresting and, in some places, summarily executing those liable for treason."
 demrus.1.a: "Better dead than red."
 demrus.1.b: "Use the courts to restrict violence."

 demrus.2.t: "The Red Regiments Strike"
 demrus.2.d: "The troubles of the early 1930s left many scars on Russian political society, and many militant organisations from that time are the ancestors of current waves of violence. The Red Regiments are largely run by radical Maximalists and some Neo-Bolsheviks - to our understanding, under the direction of the old Red general, Mikhail Levandovsky.\n\nMaximalist terror groups first rose into significance in countering Svobodnik Combat Squads in the 1930s and later played a major part in the resistance against Savinkov. But they are not reasonable men: they still continue their war against the 'bourgeois republic'.\n\nDays ago, a bomb exploded at a garrison near Vladikavkaz in an attempt to kill General-Major Andrey Grechko, who led the suppression of the Ingushetian Soviet after the fall of Savinkov. The bombing was one in a series of many directed against the military, the police, and other state agencies. They vow to continue the terror until the final collapse of the reactionary-militarist republic."
 demrus.2.a: "They are still living in 1917."

 demrus.18.t: "Republican-Democratic Military Curriculum"
 demrus.18.d: "The curriculum of the Russian army has always been decided by the army itself, but that will change. From now on, the Ministry of Education is responsible for non-military topics taught to all officers. Previously, this meant mostly patriotic and anti-communist talking points, but nothing was said of democracy, for example. This must change!\n\nIn the new cadet textbooks, in addition to military matters, future officers will be taught republican and democratic values, and how they are integrally tied to Russian society. The revolutionary assault battalions of the February Revolution and peasant uprisings against the Bolsheviks and the Tsars are to be venerated. Every Russian officer should have love for Russian democracy in his heart!"
 demrus.18.a: "For the great Russian Republic!"

 demrus.19.t: "Crimes of the Past"
 demrus.19.d.socialist: "The socialist regime conducted a thorough purge of the upper echelons of the Russian officer corps. Those who are left claim to be apolitical and professional - but there is great ire towards them for supposedly supporting a treasonous, revolutionary takeover of the Russian Republic.\n\nAt the very least, these people should lose any public trust, and at worst, be prosecuted for treason."
 demrus.19.d.szrs: "Officially, the Russian Army was apolitical, but as the details of the Savinkov regime are being publicised, it is clear that hundreds of officers bear some responsibility or complicity in the atrocities ordered by Savinkov. It is no secret that the SZRS' militancy enjoyed genuine support, especially among younger officers, and the army for sure did not object to being used against domestic enemies branded as 'communists'.\n\nHigher-ranking officers have already been removed, naturally, but there remain hundreds of cases where state prosecution is expected by those who wish to see justice."
 demrus.19.a: "Arrange mass trials for those found complicit."
 demrus.19.b: "Be lenient - they've already lost."
 demrus.19.tt: "This event may §Gimprove§! Stability."

 demrus.20.t: "Trial Revelations"
 demrus.20.d: "The trials of former government ministers have revealed a large amount of seized property and valuables, much of it taken legally (according to the punitive laws of the time), but some of it taken simply because it could be. Tracking down who this wealth belongs to, and if they even still live, will be costly, but the rich elite are adamant the government make the attempt.\nSocialists, meanwhile, say that this wealth is far better off in the state's hands, and that trying to sort out claims between entitled oligarchs will only lead to chaos."
 demrus.20.a: "It belongs to the state now."
 demrus.20.b: "Return it to those who have proven loyal."
 demrus.20.c: "Return all of it, no questions asked."

 demrus.21.t: "The New Land Reforms"
 demrus.21.d: "With the SZRS land reforms removed, discussion has moved on to the system that should replace it. Unfortunately, this has bogged down into arguments between socialists and old-money conservatives who didn't see much wrong with the SZRS reforms in the first place.\n\nWe can encourage cooperation and work towards a compromise, though the results will likely be less than stellar, or we can favour one of the sides and not only risk the others' wrath but add to the overall government's division."
 demrus.21.a: "Peasants are the backbone of Russia."
 demrus.21.b: "The efficiency of agriculture must be considered."

 demrus.22.t: "General Boldyrev's Plea"
 demrus.22.d: "General Boldyrev's coup attempt against the republic when the SZRS was rising to power is still in recent memory. He, like many other officers, was purged, and he fled to Berlin to escape Savinkovist persecution.\n\nBut today it seems that Boldyrev had a point. After all, it was the army who restored democracy in the face of Savinkovist tyranny and the near-collapsing state after his death, and he was right to fear the dictatorship that the Vozhd planned. Today, he has come to us stating that he wishes to rejoin the armed forces. Many have sympathies for Boldyrev - he was surely ahead of his time - but he has seemingly been courteous with the Germans, and as much as his intent was to bring down Savinkov, such behaviour is rather suspect. What should we do?"
 demrus.22.a: "We owe him an apology."
 demrus.22.b: "He commits treason and expects to be reinstated?"

 demrus.23.t: "The Sword of Damocles"
 demrus.23.d: "There is no denying it, we owe our position to General-Fieldmarshal [RUS_GetArmyChief], the generalissimus of the free republic.\n\nWhile he is, of course, supportive towards our regime, he also expects to be left as the sole authority on military matters, and that the military continues being the republic's favoured institution. The relationship is unequal and harmful to our democracy, but we only have a limited amount of options."
 demrus.23.a: "Just give [RUS_GetArmyChief] a free hand."
 demrus.23.b: "Remind him of who leads the republic."

 demrus.24.t: "The Old Guard Generals"
 demrus.24.d: "Despite the government having avowed itself to stay aloof from military affairs, some high-ranking military officials have quietly alerted us to the presence of several old guard generals who are slowly becoming more and more influential, like Mikhail Drozdovsky, Vyacheslav Volkov, and Fyodor Bredov.\n\nThese are die-hard monarchists dating back to the civil war, and their rise is enough to cause concern."
 demrus.24.a: "Only remove those with connections to Savinkov."
 demrus.24.b: "Here's a nice office job in Siberia..."
 demrus.24.c: "Pressure them to retire."

 demrus.25.t: "The Use of Fear"
 demrus.25.d: "With things looking as grim as they are, the prospect of using fear to prod more moderate members of the opposition to side with us has been raised.\n\nLet's raise the spectre of another civil war, or of radicals taking control in new elections. We will need to use the newspapers to do it, stoking instability throughout Russia, but it should have the effect we seek."
 demrus.25.a: "We'll use any means to come out on top."
 demrus.25.b: "No, we're better than this."

 demrus.26.t: "Waning Faith in Democracy"
 demrus.26.d: "The initial excitement after the restoration of the Constitution has waned. Initial hopes were high, but the promises made were never delivered. To many, it was like a return to business as usual, to politicians only enriching themselves and not really caring for the people.\n\nAs the apathy sets deeper, radical movements gather strength, and popular support for the government wanes."
 demrus.26.a: "That's not good."

 demrus.27.t: "The Security Apparatus"
 demrus.27.d.szrs: "Savinkov's vast security apparatus was immediately downscaled after his removal, and a lot of the police lost their jobs as they were card-carrying Svobodniks and deemed to lose their civic honour. Initially, the military stepped in, and military police alongside Cossack units were responsible for maintaining order. This is terrible for the independence of our civilian government, and alternatives are needed quickly.\n\nSimply put, the problem is that employing former SZRS loyalists in law enforcement is very unpopular, but they also represent the best-trained and most experienced force. Barring them from employment would ensure a more morally clean basis for our law enforcement, but it would also lead to less experienced and effective police - which could also harm our democracy."
 demrus.27.d.soc: "The reborn republic has inherited what is practically another Cheka situation. The VGPU grew larger as the communists faced more resistance from within, and naturally, the security apparatus has been greatly downscaled. It could be argued that many were not die-hard socialists and that we can only rebuild the security forces if we pardon some of them.\n\nThat being said, far-left infiltration in the security apparatus could be catastrophic. After all, we cannot possibly risk a third Russian Revolution."
 demrus.27.a: "Pardon and recruit some of them."
 demrus.27.b: "Maintain the Svobodnik ban."

 demrus.28.t: "The Golden Handshake"
 demrus.28.d: "The Savinkov administration helped the state amass great fortunes, and despite the intent to redistribute them fairly, much of the state property fell into the hands of a few opportunistic businessmen. The Putilovs and Morozovs have bounced back and increased their fortunes, and many middle managers in Savinkov's state enterprises were able to gain a lot of important shares.\n\nMany of these figures have come together and organised, forming the VSTPF - The All-Russian Union of Commerce, Industry and Finances - under the presidency of Kadet Pavel Buryshkin, an avid businessman who managed to acquire majority ownership of some large industrial complexes built during Plan Voskhod. The VSTPF acts as a lobbying group to advise the government on economic policy, and Buryshkin has approached us with an offer.\n\nAs responsible citizens of Russia, Buryshkin and his colleagues want to take part in rebuilding Russia. They offer their considerable financial support to state industry programmes, as long as their own empires are not forgotten in government contracts and new legislation."
 demrus.28.a: "Of course we can make business with them."
 demrus.28.b: "People like you are the scum of Russia."
 RUS_business_deal: "Has made a deal with the business interests."
 RUS_ic_cost_reduction_tt: "Reduces cost of expensive Industrial Decisions by £pol_power §G10§! and cost of cheap Industrial Decisions by £pol_power §G5§!."

 demrus.29.t: "Secularisation of the Education System"
 demrus.29.d: "The first republic had already separated religion and state, but also provided great freedoms to all religious institutions, including the freedom to maintain their own schools. This new law would forbid non-state organisations from maintaining basic education, while higher-level private schools would be allowed as long as they adhere to the education standards set by the ministry. In practice, this would mean closing hundreds of private religious schools - mostly Orthodox, but also some Islamic, Jewish, and more unusual ones such as Steiner schools, which had boomed during the Savinkov administration.\n\nFrom its conception, the law has received vehement opposition from the right wing in the Duma, arguing it is restricting religious freedom and forcing many schools to be closed in areas where state schools are already overburdened. Professor Ivan Kairov from the RDP has become the main face defending the law in the Duma, supported by his own party and the SRs, while Kadets are demanding increases in state education funding if they are to support closing so many private schools."
 demrus.29.a: "Make sure the law goes through."
 demrus.29.b: "This is not a priority right now."

 demrus.30.t: "The Extent of Privatisation"
 demrus.30.d: "We are left with many massive state-owned and managed industrial conglomerates, which have turned out to be rotten: they only functioned because the government could regulate prices and wages arbitrarily, and thus hide any inefficiencies. After furious debates in the Duma about the fate of these state companies two main proposals have been drafted.\n\nThe most moderate proposal is that of Pavel Buryshkin, long-time businessman and politician, whose privatisation plan seeks to maintain the integrity of these state companies, but would simply put them in private hands and maintain their contracts with the state. This would ensure that critical industries are not disturbed.\n\nAn entirely opposite opinion comes from the top economist of the SRs, Nikolay Kondratiev, who has drafted a plan that would split the non-essential companies into small portions, which would be privatised with preference towards founding new, small companies instead of 'giving the rich even more'."
 demrus.30.a: "Better not to rock the boat."
 demrus.30.b: "We have a chance for a fairer capitalism."
 demrus.30.c: "Keep critical companies nationalised, privatise the rest."

 demrus.31.t: "Denikin's Resignation"
 demrus.31.d: "The military reforms have been eroding the power of the old Civil War commanders, and General-Fieldmarshal Denikin's role has become particularly isolated. While greatly respected, the Peasant Marshal is increasingly seeming like a relic - only in his position due to his political connections and glorious past, but outshined by younger, more competent men.\n\nInitially, Denikin reacted with anger towards any hints about his age or the possible need to make room for younger officers, but he eventually came to terms with it. A man of his stubbornness would never retire in the face of external pressure - but if it can be his own choice, he can keep his honour."
 demrus.31.a: "Happy retirement, Peasant Marshal."

 demrus.32.t: "Denikin's Retirement"
 demrus.32.d: "Anton Ivanovich Denikin's career is like the history of the Russian republic: starting from almost nothing and succeeding against all odds. A son of a serf, Denikin came to be known as 'the Peasant Marshal' - fiery, stubborn, and a brilliant field commander, both a liberal democrat and Russian chauvinist. But age is truly pressing on him already - it is a fine time to retire.\n\nDenikin has taken part in the great renewal of the Russian nation, and enjoys great respect from the army and many of the common people. With the Great Russian Cause fulfilled, the General-Fieldmarshal has informed [ROOT.GetLeader] of his intent to retire, and to withdraw to live a quiet, rural life."
 demrus.32.a: "Happy retirement, Peasant Marshal."

 demrus.33.t: "Curriculum Decried as 'Nationalist'"
 demrus.33.d: "The progressive press has launched an attack on our education reform, and challenged it in the Supreme Court as unconstitutional. The campaign is chiefly led by SRs Pitirim Sorokin and Gavriil Alyunov, who decry it as blatant Russification.\n\nThe new 'patriotic curriculum' focuses greatly on the achievements of 'our common Russian culture' and minimises regional variation. Previously, school curriculums included much more about regional languages, cultures, and history, but this 'all-Russian curriculum' seeks to unify this aspect. The largest protests are located in Southern Russia, where there have been full-on school strikes, organised especially by the Muslims."
 demrus.33.a: "We are all Russians here."
 demrus.33.b: "Grant some exceptions."

 demrus.34.t: "The Muslim Faithful Protest"
 demrus.34.d: "The proclamation of Christianity as the official state religion has not been met well by the non-Christians of Russia, as one can expect. In practice, this means the withdrawal of state support for Islamic, Buddhist, and other smaller religious associations. Previously, all religious schools, hospitals, and monasteries enjoyed certain tax benefits and additional rights, but now these are only applied to Christian associations.\n\nThis has sparked major protests in cities like Kazan, Elista, and [GetVictoryPointName_3668], both from the religious communities and the progressives objecting to state religion in general."
 demrus.34.a: "Keep complaining."
 demrus.34.b: "Grant them some special rights."

 demrus.35.t: "Woes of the Councils of Land Division"
 demrus.35.d: "The flagship promise of the SZRS - the Vozhd's great land redistribution - was never finished. However, the discontented countryside that propelled him into power had genuine concerns. Whatever one's opinion on the late Savinkov is, one must admit that his programme to break up large estates and drag the Russian countryside into fairer, more efficient times was not wrong. The Councils of Land Division, set up by Savinkov's Ministry of Agriculture, have continued functioning after him, trying their best to buy and redistribute farmland.\n\nHowever, with the political turmoil, they have lost much of their funding and are generally in disarray. Almost all parties agree on continuing their work - if on a smaller scale, with less drastic measures. It would serve as a promise to the forgotten rural Russia that Savinkov was not the only one who cared for them. The Socialist-Revolutionaries have been especially vocal on the matter, even demanding prioritisation of the land reforms in funding."
 demrus.35.a: "We have higher priorities."
 demrus.35.b: "We need to win the peasants' hearts and minds!"

 demrus.36.t: "The Republican-Democratic Pledge"
 demrus.36.d: "The new curriculum is trying to instil democratic-republican values in the students, and spends considerable time explaining the woes of authoritarian systems of government - be it Tsarist, Bolshevik, or Savinkovist. However, the Duma Committee of Education has proposed to go even further, and implement the so-called 'Republican-Democratic Pledge'.\n\nThe students would pledge loyalty to the democratic and republican values of the February Revolution and to the free, fair, and indivisible Russian Republic.\n\nProponents of the pledge argue that while it may seem like a Svobodnik propaganda method, it can be a powerful tool to instil the future Russian generations with love for the free Russian Republic. Ironically, the left and the right have found themselves united on the matter, as both call it state worship - even if for very different reasons."
 demrus.36.a: "This is insane."
 demrus.36.b: "Admirable idea!"

 demrus.37.t: "A New Page in the Russian Army"
 demrus.37.d: "The Russian Army - previously the vanguard of reactionary thinking and the foremost enemy of democracy - has been restructured into something that truly represents the Russian people. The old leading White generals are being moved into less prominent roles, and the men of our young Republic are given a chance to climb up the ranks.\n\nMuch of the political-historical part of the military education has been changed from repeating tired Tsarist myths to one that instils the republican civic values of liberty, equality, and brotherhood. Real societal change takes time, but the first, great steps have now been taken."
 demrus.37.a: "Out with the old."

 demrus.38.t: "The Chernov Monument"
 demrus.38.d: "The initiative to erect a monument for Viktor Mikhaylovich Chernov came from a grassroots proposal signed by over a million people, but the ultimate details on the matter remain for us to arrange. The proposal argues that Chernov is the founding father and a martyr of Russian democracy.\n\nA common saying in the Esers is that without Viktor Chernov, there would be no Socialist Revolutionary Party at all - but it is also justifiable to say that without him, there would not have been a Russian Republic at all. The day of Chernov's assassination has become like a saint's celebration, with yearly commemorations, particularly in Tambov and the black-earth belt of Southern Russia. To them, Chernov was someone who brought the plight of the forgotten rural masses into national politics - and ultimately turned it into a uniquely Russian ideology.\n\nMany are still bitter over Chernov being barred from running in the 1926 presidential election due to mistrust from 'certain circles' - maybe Chernov's Russia would have been more equal and fair. Instead of giving in to despair, Chernov accepted he would never wield power in Kornilov's republic, but gave his life to defending it nonetheless. As fellow revolutionary Ilya Fondaminsky said: Russian liberty is born out of the blood of countless righteous martyrs who died for a better world."
 demrus.38.a: "He deserves a statue in Moscow, where he was murdered."
 demrus.38.b: "Khvalynsk, his hometown, will become his shrine."
 demrus.38.c: "Petrograd, the home of the revolution, will remember him."
 demrus.38.e: "I don't think there should be a statue."

 demrus.39.t: "The Military-Industrial Complex"
 demrus.39.d: "Even in the worst of the economic depressions in the 1920s and 1930s, one thing remained true: Russia has a large and high-quality armaments industry. The budgets for the army and the navy remained high these past twenty years due to the insistence and political influence of the military, and many idealistic reform budgets failed when they tried to touch the defence budget. This has supported a significant military industry, not only selling to our own army but also widely in China, South Asia, the Middle East, and the Balkans. Military-industrial conglomerates like OPZ, Obukhov, or Duks have great lobbying power and, together with the metallurgy sector, form the backbone of our heavy industry.\n\nThis national importance has also led governments to often side with the shareholders instead of the workers, and the military industry has been the vilified capitalist villain for Russian socialists - not only enslaving workers but also encouraging war and destruction globally. The political influence of weapons manufacturers and close ties to many Kadet governments has also annoyed the opposition. With the economic turmoil that Savinkov left, and a relatively strong foundation for our coalition, we can finally take action to at least curtail the influence of these companies - should we even want to."
 demrus.39.a: "If we do not manufacture the bombs, someone else will!"
 demrus.39.b: "Capitalists have no business influencing budgets or policy."

 # SR Events
 demrus.40.t: "Boris Viktorovich Sends His Regards"
 demrus.40.d: "Vladimir Rikhter was always known for his disdain for security. To the great annoyance of the presidential bodyguards, he often insisted on meeting with crowds personally and believed that a true Socialist-Revolutionary should stay connected with the Russian masses. 'If the Russian people want me dead, they shall have me', he would respond, claiming that these had been Viktor Chernov's last words.\n\nThe President took part in a great SR rally in Tambov, and on his return journey, he stopped in Kozlov to meet with the local populace.\n\nAs excited locals arrived to see the president in the town square, catastrophe struck. An attacker opened fire with a TK pistol from the crowd at close range and hit Rikhter in the throat. One local later reported hearing the assassin shout, 'Boris Viktorovich sends his regards!' to Rikhter.\n\nThe security could not open return fire immediately because of the crowd but managed to catch the assassin before he left the city. He was Vladimir Vladimirovich Brand, a captain of the army and a former member of the SZRS. Further investigation revealed ties to the SZRS Combat Squads. From his pocket, his so-called 'manifesto' was found, which proclaimed Rikhter a traitor of the highest order as he had sold his soul to the Judeo-Bolshevik cabal of the political left.\n\nThe country is now in mourning. While alive, Vladimir Rikhter was controversial and not universally liked, but now he has become the all-Russian symbol for the republic and its democracy: the man who stood up to Savinkov and outlived him, only to be gunned down by a criminal later. As large a funeral crowd had not been seen in Russia since Chernov's death."
 demrus.40.a: "Go in peace, Vladimir Nikolayevich."

 demrus.41.t: "Control of the State Council"
 demrus.41.d: "The Russian Constitution defines the Chairman of the State Council - the upper house of the Duma - as the second most powerful man in the realm, who takes over presidential duties if he is, for one reason or another, unable to fulfil them. Additionally, the Chairman leads the discussion in the State Council. The position carries significant prestige and gives one ample ability to make their own views known.\n\nWhile the Chairman is elected by the State Council, by virtue of the Socialist-Revolutionary majority together with our allies, whoever the Party decides to nominate will all but surely win. The expected course of action would be nominating a high-profile Eser to the post to ensure the cooperation of the intra-party opposition.\n\nTwo clear options for the next Chairman of the State Council would be Ilya Fondaminsky and Pitirim Sorokin. Fondaminsky is on the conservative end of the party: old, well-connected and respected inside and outside the party. He is often the voice of reason within the party, and has often clashed with Rikhter over rhetoric.\n\nCloser to Rikhter's heart is Pitirim Sorokin. He is an acclaimed sociologist and Marxist, and has considerable experience in matters of education and social policy. However, he is anything but a fervent believer, preferring a dry, scientific approach to societal questions.\n\nEither way, nominating either of them would satisfy many politically: Fondaminsky would ensure a working relationship with the more conservative political spectrum, while Sorokin would be popular with the left."
 demrus.41.a: "Nominate Fondaminsky."
 demrus.41.b: "Nominate Sorokin."

 demrus.42.t: "The Republican Guard"
 demrus.42.d: "The military has never been the closest friend of Socialist-Revolutionaries, and many of the law enforcement officers are not true believers either. We need a force that is loyal to the ideals of the February Revolution first and foremost, and to that purpose, it has been proposed that a new Republican Guard (Resgvardiya) under Captain Dmitry Antonov should be founded. Antonov, brother of the famous Tambov uprising leader, remained outside the SZRS unlike many other Tambov veterans.\n\nThe Republican Guard would be a voluntary auxiliary law enforcement organisation, which could offer support to the police and the military when needed. It would be Socialist-Revolutionary in nature, and providing the ideological education of young men would be one of its tasks. The critics call it 'the armed wing of the party' - and perhaps they are right. Would they rather have Russia's bravest sons listen to monarchist nonsense by some tsarist military officer, rather than take part in a genuinely democratic paramilitary organisation?"
 demrus.42.a: "Well spoken."
 demrus.42.b: "Better not annoy the military."

 demrus.43.t: "Fate of the ex-Svobodniks"
 demrus.43.d: "Many good SRs were seduced by Savinkov during the past decade. Most of them claim to have supported him just because he was helping the peasantry, or because he was fighting German oppression. Some did it out of fear. No matter the reasons, many of these turncoats are now trying to rejoin the Socialist-Revolutionary Party. They have already been accepted by some regional organisations, while others have held a strict line against them.\n\nThe matter was brought up in the party central committee by Ilya Fondaminsky, who suggested that these people should be allowed to repent and reintegrate into the party, as long as they have not committed any crimes. Chairman Rikhter especially was extremely opposed, calling these people traitors who enabled Savinkov's rise to power in the first place."
 demrus.43.a: "No mercy for the damned."
 demrus.43.b: "Not everyone was as brave as Vladimir Nikolayevich."

 demrus.44.t: "[RUS.GetLeader]'s Government"
 demrus.44.d.fondaminsky: "As tragic as it is, the coalition united behind Rikhter's bold vision immediately started cracking, as Acting President Fondaminsky has little in common with the socialists in the cabinet, and has announced a more moderate line.\n\nAfter vocal opposition was raised by Minister Levitsky and other left-wing members of the cabinet, Fondaminsky dismissed the cabinet and started to look for a new government coalition more in line with the new direction of calmer and traditional reform."
 demrus.44.d.sorokin: "As tragic as it is, the coalition united behind Rikhter's bold vision immediately started cracking, as Acting President Sorokin hardly has the passion nor vision of Rikhter. While Sorokin does want to continue the path that Rikhter started, it is expected that his government will take a much more conciliatory approach.\n\nAfter vocal opposition was raised by Minister Levitsky and other left-wing members of the cabinet, Sorokin dismissed the cabinet and started to look for a new government coalition more in line with the new direction of calmer and scientific reform."

 demrus.44.c: "Revive the old liberal coalition."

 demrus.45.t: "Peasant Unions of Right-Revolutionaries"
 demrus.45.d: "Traditionally, Socialist-Revolutionary labour unions have been closer to the left wing of the party. Organisations such as Dockworkers' Unions and Sawmill Workers' Unions have typically been staunchly socialist. The working class behind the Right is largely rural. As part of a new government initiative, the PSR has started funding the formation of Peasants' Unions and other initiatives to organise the rural support base.\n\nRussia is the land of the peasants, and if we can tap into this heart and soul of Russia, the party will have great masses behind it. The [RUS_HeadOfExecutive] already enjoys popularity among some of the peasantry, and these Peasant Unions have seen a surge in membership. Ideally, they will draw the poorer rural-dwellers away from the Left-SRs and create a more united peasant front against the conservative landowners."
 demrus.45.a: "Herzen would be proud..."

 demrus.46.t: "The Moderate Revolution"
 demrus.46.d: "On one thing, Boris Savinkov was right: the Socialist-Revolutionaries had veered far from their Narodnik core. However, the solution is not to mutilate the Narodnik ideology into quasi-Tsarism, but rather to do what Herzen, Chernyshevsky, and Mikhaylovsky had set out to do: to awaken the political-revolutionary consciousness of the Russian peasantry, while decisively abandoning the foreign concept of industrial-materialist socialism. Instead of working with the Kadets and other elites, the PSR is the party of populism, of the common Russians.\n\nThe opposition to President Rikhter's reforms has been strong, but the Socialist-Revolutionaries have triumphed. The republic's core institutions have been reinforced with pure peasant thought, and the rural Russian has been empowered to dominate Russian politics. This new class of politically conscious, socially liberal, middle-class peasant is the backbone, the citizen-soldier of peasant Russia."
 demrus.46.a: "Land and liberty!"

 demrus.47.t: "Rikhter's People's Commissars!"
 demrus.47.d: "Communists in the Kremlin! The headlines of the right wing press quickly started to spread panic over the new cabinet, and it spread into the Duma soon after. The new Chairman-Minister, [GetSecondInCommand], already came under fire over his inexperience in political matters, but two of his ministers were even harder for the Duma to swallow: former Menshevik and current Left-Socialist-Revolutionary, Minister of Education Aleksandr Elyashevich - and even worse, another former Menshevik and trade unionist, Daniil Sulimov, as the Minister of Industry and Trade.\n\nThe ministerial posts had been required to gain support of the PLSR and RDP for Rikhter's government, the president had argued - and both men had proven to be ardent supporters of Russian democracy, something that could not be said of everyone from the right. The government survived its first vote of no confidence narrowly, as a number of more right-wing SRs abstained from the vote."
 demrus.47.a: "Monarchists, always complaining."

 demrus.48.t: "The Programme of Integralism"
 demrus.48.d: "'A society made up of idiots or untalented people will never be a prosperous society. Give a group of devils a splendid constitution, and yet you will not make a splendid society out of it. And conversely, a society consisting of talented and strong-willed individuals will inevitably create more advanced forms of community life.'\n\nThe social theory of President Sorokin has attracted much more attention now as it is adopted into the general framework of the PSR's programme. What Sorokin terms as 'Integralism' refers to a sociological approach where each individual section of society - political systems, economic relationships, public associations - are each an integral part of the whole. Society as a whole is constructed out of its members.\n\nSorokin's theory draws from a Marxist tradition, similar to previous liberal 'legal Marxists' like Pyotr Struve - but to him, Marxism is only a method of analysis, not a realistic goal. In practice, Sorokin's programme is focused on raising the educational and economic level of all Russians, funded by the taxation of the more well-off. To him, the 'state-capitalist system' of big business and legions of serf-workers is a system of ancient, tyrannical states. Instead, the cooperative economy shall be formed, with its basis on small producers - the farmer, the craftsman, the small enterprise. Only through a healthy economic and educational state can Russia prosper as a whole."
 demrus.48.a: "Then let's not be a society made up of idiots."

 demrus.49.t: "Towards True Narodism"
 demrus.49.d: "While [RUS_HeadOfExecutive] Fondaminsky's political programme seems like your usual Right-Eser politics - focusing on maintaining the democratic system, social reforms, federalism, and a special focus on peasant issues - his ideological undertones are certainly viewed as more... esoteric. During his years out of politics in the early 1930s, Fondaminsky wrote 'Ways of Russia', where he analysed the ideological traditions of Russia, and came to the widely criticised conclusion that Russia, by its nature, is entirely unique, a particularly spiritual and traditionalist nation.\n\nFor Fondaminsky, Russia should not seek to emulate the West - not its bourgeois, capitalist systems nor its materialist socialist machinery. Russia only needs the achievements of the West, not its mistakes. Narodism has always sought to save Russia from the West, protect the flame in the soul of peasant Russia, and the coming kingdom of brotherhood and love.\n\nFondaminsky's writings greatly stress the exceptionalism of the Russian nation - not unlike Chernov, but with an entirely different focus. He does maintain that, at its core, Russia is what it is because Russian peasants have been able to save the traditional communal lifestyle. Chernov referred to this as archaic peasant communism, but Fondaminsky identifies it as the basis for a society based on Christian love and brotherhood, alien to the materialist interests of the West. It is important to note that Fondaminsky is strongly against any sort of authoritarianism, and some even find Christian anarchist undertones in his visions of a 'society of love' - but Russia also has the great spiritual burden to save the rest of the world from this materialism that is consuming the human soul elsewhere, to show them a better way not founded upon money or scientific progress, but harmony and faith."
 demrus.49.a: "Holy Russia demands a holy cause."

 #RDP/Titov Events
 demrus.50.t: "Emboldened Labour Movement"
 demrus.50.d: "The most labour-friendly president in Russia since Lenin has started his work, and as one of his first moves has removed many of the restrictions on labour unions and freedom of association. President Titov has often spoken of the importance of unionisation of the working class as a method of balancing out society, and in general has been supportive towards all kinds of workers' organising from unions to mutual banks and cooperatives.\n\nHowever, this tactic may have backfired, as the resurgent union movement is increasingly seduced by the communists, like Mikhail Tomsky in the leadership of the VTsSPS. While there are more moderate unions, some especially important sectors are in communist hands, such as the All-Russian Metalworkers' Union led by Sergey Medvedev. While security does maintain surveillance on the radical trade union leaders, our hands are tied for now outside propaganda work."
 demrus.50.a: "A double-edged sword."

 demrus.51.t: "Revolt of the Left"
 demrus.51.d: "President Titov has often been ridiculed as a 'champagne socialist' and a 'capitalist in the clothes of the proletariat', but the prevailing opinion among the RDP's socialists still was that it better be him over another almost assuredly more reactionary leader. But Aleksandr Andreyevich failed to pass even this very low bar of addressing issues that matter to the working class, and instead proved that he was only ever interested in power and ministerial wages, not the common people.\n\nAfter fierce denunciation of Titov's government by Vladimir Levitsky, he took his followers - a good half of the RDP's active membership - and declared their intent to form a new Radical-Democratic Workers' Party as a direct competitor to Titov. While this does not hit our Duma majority terribly, it will ensure that there will be no second term for Titov."
 demrus.51.a: "Imbeciles!"
 RUS_RDP_split: "The RDP has split."
 RUS_RDP_split_NOT: "The RDP has §Rnot§! split."

 demrus.52.t: "Communists Within"
 demrus.52.d: "The ranks of the Radical-Democratic Party split badly in last week's Duma vote on the Law Against Anti-Democratic Agitation, which was nominally against the right but would also give the government tools to suppress various syndicalist and other revolutionary socialist publications as 'hostile to democracy'.\n\nChairman-Minister Sergey Melgunov faced a full-blown parliamentary revolt as half of the party, led by the trouble-maker Vladimir Levitsky, voted against the government. The law only passed with the votes from the opposition, which led the Levitskites to march out and denounce Titov and Melgunov as reactionary lapdogs.\n\nThe schism inside the RDP has rarely been this festering, and scheming started immediately. It seems that Levitsky has intensified recruitment efforts among industrial unions, drawing more radical voices to the party, no doubt in a bid to out-vote Titovists in the coming party conference and attempt to take control of the party.\n\nMeanwhile, we have come under fire from the right. Kadet Anton Kartashyov and about 50 other Duma members made a formal demand for the Ministry of Interior to investigate communists within the RDP and implied that failure to do so would show that Melgunov's government is double-faced and would rather protect its own than further public good."
 demrus.52.a: "It's so over for them."
 demrus.52.b: "Try to make peace instead."

 demrus.53.t: "Red Wave Sweeps the Nation"
 demrus.53.d: "The Congress of the All-Russian Central Assembly of Trade Unions has published their 13 demands and declared strike actions by all member unions until the government proves it is a true 'workers' government' and accepts the VTsSPS programme. The Minister of Labour, Boris Berlatsky, has been willing to negotiate, though actually accepting the demands as they stand would be a capitulation to the communists.\n\nThe 13 demands include a number of reasonable points on wages and working conditions but also call for pardons to still-imprisoned or exiled Bolsheviks and full legalisation of communist political activities. In support of their demands, the Metalworkers' Union, the Dockworkers' Union, and a number of other less important groups have gone on strike across Russia.\n\nTitov himself insisted that accepting the VTsSPS' demands would only mean more demands, and that they hardly represent 'all Russian workers', unlike the RDP's electoral mandate."
 demrus.53.a: "Introduce the reasonable parts as labour legislation."
 demrus.53.b: "We do not take orders from communists. The loyalists will remain working."

 demrus.54.t: "Strike Turns Bloody"
 demrus.54.d: "Blood on the streets! The Minister of Interior, Pitirim Sorokin of the Socialist-Revolutionaries, has sought to navigate a course between allowing strikes but keeping the peace - and it has ensured peace in many parts of Russia until now. This morning, what started as a clash between communist strikers and social democratic non-striking workers at the Admiralty Shipyard in Petrograd became a clash with the police as the communists tried to force the other workers out of the dockyards. A fight broke out, seriously wounding seven and killing two.\n\nLater, the Petrograd courts judged that the police's use of force in stopping violence was perfectly legal, and that the deaths were unfortunate incidents and not deliberate killings. However, 14 communists and 5 social democrats received sentences for assault, battery, and refusal to obey authorities.\n\nThis 'Murder at the Admiralty' has only served to increase the tensions. VTsSPS-affiliated newspapers have started trashing Titov's government, and especially Sorokin's handling of the police, denouncing this 'fake socialist' government as servants of capital and reaction."
 demrus.54.a: "Censorship and arrests will ensure calm."
 demrus.54.b: "We need to continue the middle road."

 demrus.55.t: "All-Russian Social Democratic Union"
 demrus.55.d: "The Red Square of Moscow is filled with red flags, but these are not the flags of the communists (even though the distinction hardly matters to the political right), but the flags of the newly founded Vsodes, the All-Russian Social Democratic Union. All unions not in communist leadership across the country were invited to take part in the 1st Assembly of Vsodes, where charismatic socialist and unionist Gergard Zeller was elected as the first Chairman of the Committee of Vsodes.\n\nIn the same assembly, the founding document of Vsodes was accepted. It declares loyalty to socialism and class struggle but denies any communist, syndicalist, and revolutionary means, instead declaring itself to be purely reformist, social democratic, and anti-violent grouping of unions in close cooperation with the Radical-Democratic Party.\n\nThe VTsSPS obviously attacked the new union federation, calling them capitalist-reactionary lapdogs, but it was a bitter disappointment to Tomsky and Medvedev just how many unions joined Vsodes. Major defectors included the Textile Workers' Union, but the majority of Vsodes' members were previously unaffiliated groups, like the Teachers' Unions and other 'white-collar unions'. Very few Socialist-Revolutionary Unions left their own central organisation, EserProf, but they did send a friendly delegation.\n\nThe crowning of the day came as President Titov himself held the closing speech of the conference, declaring defiance to 'Bolshevik rabble-rousing' and promising that united, peaceful front of the working people can make a fairer, more free Russia than the communists ever can."

 #Kadet Events
 demrus.58.t: "The Old Man of the Kadets"
 demrus.58.d: "The princely Dolgorukov family (that traces its origins from the Rurikid dynasty) has been at the core of the Constitutional-Democratic Party from the very start, with their great wealth and prestige supporting various liberal, democratic and even pacifist causes. Brothers Pavel and Pyotr are both old and respected Kadet figures. Pavel's health suffered greatly in imprisonment during Savinkov's regime, but Pyotr is still remarkably energetic for his age. With the party crisis after the resignation of Maklakov, a reliable figure was chosen to repair the party.\n\nThe SRs have often ridiculed the Kadets for being 'democracy for gentlemen', and Pyotr Dolgorukov - a wealthy prince - does not help clean up this notion. Still, even if the Kadet leadership is claimed to be detached from the common people, Pyotr Dmitryevich has a clear record. He has been in prison for his republican and democratic activities, which began as far back as during Nikolay II's reign, and at one point, he even lost his titles of nobility for calling for the peasants to boycott Tsarist officials and the army.\n\nA multiple-time minister and with almost twenty years' service in the State Council, Dolgorukov is a man deeply connected to the political elite, though it must be said he has more connections to the peasant organisations than many other Kadets. In his first speech as the president of the republic, he called the party to return to its roots - as the Party of People's Freedom. Despite his paternalistic approach, he has always been a genuine democrat - but a democrat of moderation and retrospection."
 demrus.58.a: "Russia shall be safe in his hands!"

 demrus.59.t: "The President of Holy Rus'"
 demrus.59.d: "Russia being a republic in no way diminishes the fact that after 1453, the spiritual heart of Rome was transferred to the last bastion of true Orthodox Christian Faith - the Holy Rus'. While more typically connected to the monarchists, this deeply religious understanding of Russian identity and culture can also be found from Anton Kartashyov and his followers in the right end of the Constitutional-Democratic Union. Kartashyov does claim that the most free society is also the most moral one, and conservatives of all eras commit the mistake of overreach and control, alienating the common man even if their goals are moral.\n\nBut in other matters, the Right-Kadets are clearly conservative liberals. Kartashyov wishes to maintain a strong Russian Orthodox Church as the bedrock of Russian civil society, doing its part in aiding the poor and the sick in tandem with secular institutions. Trying to force Christianity on everyone is a futile, self-defeating attempt - but Russia can still be built according to the best of Christianity, and it can strive to protect the faithful both in Russia and in the world. Even though the Kadets officially support the separation of the church and state, Kartashyov has often described the ideal relationship as more of a symphony - where the state and the church cooperate for the common good."
 demrus.59.a: "God bless Russia!"

 demrus.60.t: "Control of the State Council"
 demrus.60.d: "The Russian Constitution defines the Chairman of the State Council - the upper house of the Duma - as the second most powerful man in the realm, who takes over presidential duties if he is for one reason or another unable to fulfil them. Additionally, the Chairman leads the discussion in the State Council. The position carries significant prestige and gives one ample ability to make their own views known.\n\nWhile the Chairman is elected by the State Council, by virtue of the Constitutional-Democratic majority together with our allies, whoever the Party decides to nominate will all but surely win. The expected course of action would be nominating a high-profile Kadets into the post to ensure the cooperation of the intra-party opposition.\n\nTwo clear options for the next Chairman of the State Council would be either the spiritual leader of the right wing of the party, Professor Anton Kartashyov, or experienced liberal statesman Pyotr Dolgorukov.\n\nKartashyov is in many ways in opposition to President Maklakov as a more socially conservative Kadet, but giving him the position would ensure that the right wing stays more satisfied with Maklakov - after all, good politics are based on compromise, and Kartashyov may even ease the worries of the VPP over Maklakov's reforms. Prince Dolgorukov is more of Maklakov's mind, known as a moderate centrist in the party. He is a staunch democrat and an old-school liberal, respected widely but loved by few. In case of Maklakov's presidential term cutting short, one of these men would resume his duties - and reign for the remainder of his term."
 demrus.60.a: "Kartashyov will help in keeping the peace."
 demrus.60.b: "Dolgorukov is more true to the President's beliefs."

 demrus.61.t: "Maklakov Resigns"
 demrus.61.d: "In his resignation letter, read out to the State Council in public sessions, President Vasily Alekseyevich Maklakov elaborates on the reasons for his decision to quit mid-term.\n\n- While I understand the disappointment that You, my dear colleagues of the Party, may have, and I am truly thankful for all the support that I have received from You, I have come to the conclusion that it is time for the Russian people and the Party to move on without me. I have guided Russia and the Party for many years to the best of my ability - which, as a mortal man, has not been always enough.\n\n- I promised You change in direction, which I had misjudged. It is not my place to analyse what I may or may not have done differently; that role shall fall upon the historians of the future. I merely understand when it is my moment to leave this great Stage of History.\n\n- Rest assured, I cannot remain idle for long. Perhaps I will finally have the time that my literary and historical pursuits deserve. I will pass my torch to You now, my brothers and sisters."
 demrus.61.a: "It was a good run, Vasily Alekseyevich."

 demrus.62.t: "Critique from the Party"
 demrus.62.d: "Originally, the Constitutional-Democratic Union was born in 1922, as the responsible political forces of Russia needed a movement to rally around. Under the leadership of Kadets Pavel Milyukov and Pavel Dolgorukov, and former Octoberists from the Liberal-Republican Party, Mikhail Rodzyanko and Aleksandr Guchkov, a broader union was created, which continued the Kadet tradition - but greatly bolstered by various liberal and liberal-conservative groups, like Aleksandr Konovalov's Progressive Party. Under the promise of peace, stability, and bread, the new Constitutional-Democratic Union would gain significant influence in both the first republican Duma and its institutions.\n\nThis broad coalition proved unworkable, and in 1925 Aleksandr Golitsyn and a number of other nationalists from the 'Patriotic Group' of the party broke off, and would form the All-Russian Patriotic Party. This splintered the Russian moderate right, as some remained in the Kadets, and others went over to the Patriots. The right-Kadets, like Anton Kartashyov and Pavel Gronsky, have always held this as the damning moment: if the Kadets had only pursued more national-minded politics from the start, instead of making economic capitulations to Germany while seeking economic growth, perhaps the rise of SZRS would have never even happened.\n\nBut to the left wing of the Kadets, men around Nikolay Nekrasov and influential the Society of Free Economy, shedding this conservative wing was seen as potentially a good thing. Without them, the Kadet party could seek to be more genuinely a party of freedom and pursue a true social liberal programme, rather than eternal compromise with the conservatives. The Kadets' role as the party of stability and sane rule has given them a strong grip over the republic's civil servants, economic life, and judiciary - but in the eyes of the voters, they have been going downhill towards grey mediocrity for some time now."
 demrus.62.a: "Patriotism and liberalism are not mutually exclusive."
 demrus.62.b: "We won't compromise our pure ideals."

 demrus.63.t: "The Ural Strikes"
 demrus.63.d: "Russia is no stranger to strikes. With economic volatility, unions and employers often end up in conflict over wages. The Metalworkers' Union has gone on a major strike lately, with the centre of the unrest located in cities like Chelyabinsk, Yekaterinburg, and Orsk. The unions are demanding higher wages to match the increasing inflation rates caused by our latest economic policies. The 'iron boyars' of these cities have requested the government for aid, as the Metalworkers' Union has managed to mobilise more workers than in all of the 1930s.\n\nStrikes in the metallurgy industry are particularly serious, as they affect various other vitally important industries, most important the armaments sector. The strikes have received political support from the RDP, with Aleksandr Titov and his allies demanding the government to introduce clear legislation on minimum wages and increased workers' protections to ensure the stability and peace of the Russian metallurgical sector."

 demrus.64.t: "Law on Russian Freedoms"
 demrus.64.d.rep: "President Maklakov's 'Law on Russian Freedoms' is an ambitious package that, according to Chairman-Minister Nekrasov, would be the final step in demolishing the police state that Russia has built around its republican institutions during the past years. The law proposes wide reductions in power of the Okhrana and the police, strengthening the citizen's legal protections and decriminalising political and religious crimes. In general, it seeks to 'bring Russian legislation on the level of a modern nation'.\n\nWhile the law has been generally welcomed in the RDP and the PSR, surprisingly many in the president's own party have expressed their opposition towards it. Pavel Gronsky, a Duma member from Tver, held a particularly loud speech suggesting various changes to the law. He and the Right-Kadets have prepared an alternate version which would not 'completely surrender the country to criminals' and would continue maintaining strong law enforcement, while 'committing to a number of reasonable legal reforms'. In private, Nekrasov has warned the president that he might have a full-on Kadet revolt on his hands if something is not done.\n\nIt is possible that the law passes with only the votes of the left, the SRs, and the progressive Kadets - but it is hard to say how most Kadets will go.

The Kadet Party was united with much of the moderate right in 1921, but there was a split of the 'Patriotic Group' in 1925, and ever since the VPP has competed against the Right-Kadets.\n\nBut the long-term dream has come true, with the unification of the VPP and KDS into a single political union, uniting all Russian patriots who believe in the sanctity of freedom and democracy. With this union, the Kadet party moves greatly to the right - but it should also be able to weather any future storm and remain as the party of Russian national interest above everything else."

It is seen as a great achievement for Chairman-Minister [GetSecondInCommand] and a legal reform worthy of the idealistic Kadet foundations.\n\nWith the law, a new age should start with Russian policing and legal systems - one where the state cannot weaponise security services against dissidents, but instead will focus solely on maintaining the safety of every citizen of Russia."

 demrus.70.t.mon: "Autocracy, Orthodoxy, People!"
 demrus.70.t.dem: "People's Russia Rises!"
 demrus.70.d.mon: "Chairman-Minister Solonevich's first speech to the State Duma was made into a great spectacle. It was broadcast live on the radio across Russia, and many workplaces made sure that the workers could listen to the speech during the day, as was the Chairman-Minister's wish. As the hunk of a man walked up the stairs of the Grand Kremlin Palace in a somewhat ill-fitting suit and small glasses, millions awaited his direct address to the people, despite it being criticised as a popularity stunt by the opposition.\n\nSolonevich was a good speaker: clear, verbose, simple yet striking. He thanked the Russian people, the Tsar, and God for giving him the chance to lead Russia in this special time in the nation's history. Instead of a concrete political programme, he painted a vision of a future Russia, akin to that of pre-serfdom Muscovite Tsardom, one where peasants enjoy the fruits of their own labour and rulers are chosen from the most educated and wise, with no -isms or other foreign, un-Russian ideas.\n\nHe denounced Savinkov as a tyrant, but one who only rose because he recognised the Russian people's yearning for a more natural state - that with free men and a strong leader. And now the nation has been blessed with Tsar Vladimir - a well-educated, admirable leader, who thinks of the Russian people before himself.\n\nIn the end, Solonevich promised his listeners that a new era in Russian history is beginning, one of stability and happiness, one of national unity, one where men will not kill and die for foreign ideologies, but for their simple love for Russia and all things Russian."

 demrus.70.a: "A nation of action, not words. Ruled by strength, not committee!"

 demrus.71.t: "Ascension of the People's Monarchists"
 demrus.71.d.rep: "The struggle between the party old guard and the People's Monarchists has finally reached its conclusion, as the special All-Russian Patriotic Party Convention ended in a dramatic inter-party shift. The earlier balance between the two factions was all but broken by the appearance of President Solonevich himself. In a rambling speech, he virulently attacked the 'prince-bureaucrats' like Golitsyn for obstructing the once-in-a-generation chance of raising Russia into greatness. Citing the great popularity the President enjoys, it was hard for the parliamentary-minded opposition to argue against this public humiliation.\n\nThe ultimatum was clear: either all of the party members would follow Solonevich's line, or those who did not do so would be free to found their own party. Soon after, Aleksandr Golitsyn announced he would withdraw from party politics and focus on work in the Duma instead. With his retreat, the intra-party opposition all but scattered in the wind, and in the following vote, all major positions in the party leadership were given to the People's Monarchists. Boris Suvorin, Solonevich's long-time friend and nationalist press baron, was elected as the chairman of the party."
 demrus.71.d.mon: "The division between the VPP party elites and Solonevich's People's Monarchists has finally reached the boiling point. After the Emperor appointed Solonevich to lead the government instead of any of the more experienced elder statesmen of the party, Golitsyn's position as leader of the party came under heavy fire. Sergey Voytsekhovsky wrote in the party newspaper 'Sentinel': 'If the Emperor prefers Solonevich, shouldn't the rest of the party, too?'.\n\nIn a meandering speech at the VPP party conference, Solonevich conducted a full-on coup of the party. He painted the old guard as 'prince-bureaucrats' obstructing the true Russian monarchy, like Peter the Great in his time had allowed western elitism to blind his eyes from true Russian heritage. Rather than losing a vote, Golitsyn gave in and accepted Solonevich's leadership of the party, which was immediately staffed with a constantly growing number of 'Solonevichites'."
 demrus.71.a: "And the People's Monarchist Movement is born!"

 demrus.72.t: "Relationship with SOR"
 demrus.72.d: "Many of us have never forgiven the SOR's top names, such as the well-liked Vasily Shulgin, for betraying the monarchist cause in 1934 and joining up with Savinkov, with a lust for power in their eyes. It must be admitted that when the inevitable purges started, and the devil SOR had unleashed destroyed them, a certain amount of schadenfreude was felt by the democrats. Many SOR members proved to be spineless opportunists, such as Vonsyatsky, who immediately turned on his comrades when it became politically profitable for him. Many others followed, especially at the local level.\n\nAll this leaves SOR as a shadow of its former self, largely focused around Shulgin and a small circle of those who never accepted Savinkov and survived. The twice-purged party still remains, largely supported by the most ultra-conservative elements within the Church."
 demrus.72.a: "Perhaps they should join us."
 demrus.72.b: "We don't want Shulgin."

 demrus.73.t: "The Stabs-Captains Against Communism!"
 demrus.73.d: "Terror broke out in Petrograd once again, as students and Stabs-Captain activists from the People's Monarchists attacked the local union printing press. The men, armed with fire irons, broke into the building and destroyed the printing machines and ruined tomorrow's copies of a number of left-wing newspapers.\n\nThe next day, the leader of the local district organisation defended these actions, claiming that the printing press had been spreading communist propaganda and that the boys had only been doing their patriotic duty. This was echoed by the leader of the movement, Boris Solonevich. Instead of calming down the situation, this was taken as a tacit endorsement of such tactics, and soon more cases of People's Monarchist raids against left-wing printing presses and union houses were recorded, apparently entirely tolerated by the leadership."
 demrus.73.a: "Go get them, boys!"
 demrus.73.b: "Put an end to this, but gently."
 demrus.73.c: "Arrest these delinquents as a warning."
 demrus.73.e: "Ban the whole damn movement."

 demrus.74.t: "[RUS_HeadOfExecutive]'s Paramilitary?"
 demrus.74.d: "The State Council committee under Kadet leadership has launched an inquiry into the actions of the Stabs-Captains Movement and its leader, Boris Solonevich, brother of Ivan Solonevich. While the organisation is nominally focused on organising sports events and physical education with a patriotic shade, in practice some parts of the movement function as if it were Solonevich's own paramilitary. The People's Monarchists often clash with the socialists and, in some campuses, have organised boycotts and protests against un-patriotic teachers or events. The Petrograd branch of the movement is especially militant and has been involved in fights almost weekly.\n\nThe inquiry, put forward by Counsellor Nekrasov, argues that it is not suitable for Solonevich's own brother to lead this kind of movement, and that there are grounds to believe that the People's Monarchists were used for coercion in the electoral campaign. Ivan Solonevich naturally denies these accusations and claims that the movement is purely educational and recreational."
 demrus.74.a: "Obstruct the inquiry before it causes any harm."
 demrus.74.b: "Can't make an omelette if you don't break some eggs!"

 demrus.75.t: "People's Monarchist Inquiry Published!"
 demrus.75.d: "Despite attempts to slow down Nekrasov's committee, they have finally published their findings to the State Council - and thus, publicly to all of Russia. In this damning document, the opposition is claiming that the Ministry of Interior is purposefully ignoring the disregard for law that the Stabs-Captains Movement and its leader, Boris Solonevich, are showing. They list dozens of cases of crimes committed by the members of the movement and later endorsed by their superiors. Particularly embarrassing for the [RUS_HeadOfExecutive] is connecting the misgivings of the Stabs-Captains to electoral coercion and harassment towards left-wing candidates.\n\nNaturally, any action proposed by the inquiry cannot pass the upper house due to a government majority, even though the findings did make some of our allies in the Duma squirm and privately call for some kind of conclusion, if only to save [RUS_HeadOfExecutive]'s face."
 demrus.75.a: "Just bury it, no one cares."
 demrus.75.b: "Launch a counter-inquiry on the left."

 demrus.76.t: "The Funders are Furious"
 demrus.76.d: "[RUS_HeadOfExecutive] Solonevich's speech at the opening of the new Tsaritsyn Stadion ruffled some feathers. What seemed like a relatively normal Solonevich speech, filled with anecdotes and verbose metaphors, eventually escalated into a rant against 'certain money-elites' who apparently gained more than they should have when Savinkov's state corporations were privatised. While this sort of talking point is common, especially from the left, it is rather embarrassing, especially for Solonevich's own party. In his speech, Solonevich called these people 'leeches on Mother Russia' and argued that curtailing capitalism had been the only good thing that Boris Savinkov had been trying to do.\n\nQuite shortly after the speech, it became clear that major funders behind the [RUS_HeadOfExecutive] were furious. Pavel Buryshkin and Igor Sikorsky even implied the possibility of moving their funding to some other group instead, if their services are not valued by the [RUS_HeadOfExecutive]. Solonevich's financial advisors were quick to recommend fixing relations with them, even if [RUS_HeadOfExecutive] insists that he meant every word, and has little respect for these elites."
 demrus.76.a: "Drink and dine with our friends!"
 demrus.76.b: "I survived on potatoes, why can't they?"

 demrus.77.t: "Youth of the Nation"
 demrus.77.d: "Oddly enough, Solonevich has been able to mobilise the youth perhaps better than any other right-wing politician. While the leadership of the VPP and the Kadets is often joked as being mostly old men reminiscing about Tsarist times, Solonevich's rallies are full of youth and dynamism. The National Union of the New Generation - the youth organisation under the auspices of the People's Monarchists - is particularly popular among university students. Another major focus point for Solonevich is sports: he is a common visitor at major events across Russia, often even taking part in various sports with the common people.\n\nSolonevich has always had a side career in physical education, especially in boxing and martial arts, but he has always been a proponent of sports events accessible to even the poorer children. The National Union of the New Generation has organised new sports clubs in many towns, even quite small ones, and has done good political work by organising games free for anyone to take part in. There is even a state-sponsored fund to reward the most talented young athletes. After all, Russia's hope is in its youth - and the healthier and stronger its youth are, the more powerful the Russia of future generations shall be."
 demrus.77.a: "Our children shall inherit the Earth."

 demrus.78.t: "The Conservative Rural Programme"
 demrus.78.d.vpp: "The liberal experiment in Russia failed, and managed to only bring chaos and further division. Us conservatives are often blamed for a lack of vision and idolisation of the past, but this could not be further from the truth - in fact, prime minister Pyotr Stolypin already had the right recipe, yet one destiny stopped him from finishing.\n\nAnyone with a brain - or a heart - recognises that the land ownership conditions of the Russian rural people were the main blame for the social unrest of the late imperial period. But that matter has been fixed by the republican land reforms, which essentially made Stolypin's vision - a Russia of independent, small private farms - into reality. Still, many of these farmers continued to vote for the Socialist-Revolutionaries out of habit or gratefulness, without realising that in truth, their own interest would be in conservative politics.\n\nIt is true that many of the independent peasants started to vote for Kadets or for us, but in woefully small numbers compared to the SRs or later SZRS vote shares. Simply put, we have to convince the Russian small landowners that it is the Patriotic Party that furthers their interests of economic stability, the sanctity of private property, and support for land and business owners. If we can propagate this message widely enough, perhaps we can instil the right kind of conservative patriotism into Russian society. After all, Russia is inherently, naturally conservative - many voters just have not realised or admitted this yet."
 demrus.78.d.solonevich: "In one thing, both Viktor Chernov and Boris Savinkov were right: that the ideal Russia is the pre-Petrine, pre-serfdom Russia, a time when peasants lived in obschinas, the common-land villages, self-managing their affairs among local traditions. Obviously Chernov conflated this with the idiocy of communism, and Savinkov was only perversely idolising the peasantry while not really knowing anything about it. But Solonevich is from a small cottage in the poorest Belarus - he knows the plight of the rural people.\n\nThe rural programme of the Solonevich administration has been essentially copied from the SRs. It defines the core of Russian living as a free man - with his own property, his own farm or tools, having control over his own labour. In practice, this means financial support for small businesses and small to medium-size farms - a common SR policy in the 1920s. Any remaining cooperative farms are encouraged to transition into private farms, and loans for founding new farms are made easily available akin to Savinkov's own land reforms. These policies have come under fire, especially from major industrialists, who view this as merely 'vote-buying' and 'populism'. But they do not understand the core of the People's Monarchy - the Monarchy needs its People; it does not exist only through the elites. What do these Moscow elites know of true Russian living?"
 demrus.78.a: "Better than godless urbanism."

 # RDP/Sulimov Events
 demrus.80.t: "The Republican Cadres"
 demrus.80.d: "Most of the White Army is a stronghold of Neo-Kornilovite reaction, but thankfully the younger generation of officers tends to be more loyal to Russian republican ideals rather than Tsars and military strongmen. The young guard of generals like Aleksandr Vasilevsky, Rodion Malinovsky, Aleksey Antonov, Nikolay Vatutin, and Lev Dovator are all democratic-minded, apolitical, and show disdain towards the rule of old Tsarist generals in the army over young talent.\n\nWhile officially the military is relatively independent, the security services loyal to the government have made contacts with these republican cadres in the army, and started to compose lists of potentially reactionary, monarchist, and anti-democratic generals, while seeking allies from the young guard. Vasilevsky, the chief option for pro-democratic supreme commander, refused to plot against his superiors, but seems like a potential friend to the cause nonetheless, not to mention thousands of lower-rank officers."
 demrus.80.a: "Focus on finding supporters."
 demrus.80.b: "Focus on spying on our enemies."

 demrus.81.t: "The Trial of Anton Denikin"
 demrus.81.d: "Supreme Commander of the Russian Army and War Minister under the Savinkov regime, General-Fieldmarshal Anton Ivanovich Denikin is ultimately responsible for a great number of crimes against the common people. In an extraordinary trial, the state prosecutor Andrey Vyshinsky has charged Denikin for the army's complicity in various crimes committed in 1936.\n\nThe accusations include using military units to guard penal labour institutions, which led to at least seven cases of servicemen knowingly killing at least seventeen prisoners. In addition, Denikin had counter-signed Boris Savinkov's orders to use the military to forcefully move approximately 40,000 people from the border regions to the Russian interior after the creation of the Border Zone.\n\nThe prosecution went to great lengths to prove that Denikin was in a position to punish the perpetrators or refuse to cooperate with illegal orders, but consistently refused to do so. Instead, the military covered up many of these crimes under orders of Denikin. While some parts of the case are legally speaking muddy, there are still enough charges to tarnish Denikin's public image.\n\nThe old general, who pleaded not guilty, seemed bitter, stressed, and increasingly erratic. Even those more sympathetic towards him in the court have started to consider whether it is better to let the seventy-year-old general merely retire due to advanced age and to protect the military's public opinion."
 demrus.81.a: "He is found guilty and put in prison."
 demrus.81.b: "He is pardoned and allowed to retire."

 demrus.82.t: "The Conspiracy of the Volunteers"
 demrus.82.d: "The 'judicial murder' and disgrace of General Denikin was not received well by everyone. It is no surprise that the military is discontent, widely believing that Denikin is a martyr that the socialist government needed to remove. Additionally, there has been unhappiness over the promotion of Vasilevsky - a relatively young and inexperienced, if talented, officer - over his mentor Markov, or any other more senior general.\n\nThere are at least two conspiratorial groups within the army: Denikin's former inner circle, like Sergey Markov and Mikhail Levitov, on one side, and the monarchists around Pyotr Wrangel and Mikhail Drozdovsky on the other. The police are keeping an eye on them, but the situation is tense, and we cannot move too brazenly against them, lest we risk full-blown mutiny and rebellion."
 demrus.82.a: "This is getting out of hand."

 demrus.83.t: "The Law on Defence of the Republic"
 demrus.83.d: "In view of the recent resurgence of anti-democratic and anti-republican forces, the Duma has taken required actions to ensure the survival of the Russian radical republican form of government, carrying the legacy of the February Revolution. With the new Law on Defence of the Republic, the executive branch is granted temporary far-reaching powers to:\n\n- Restrict and censor anti-democratic publications at will, and limit freedom of association and travel for any person engaged in such activity.\n\n- Conduct search and seizure, wire-tapping, and other methods of surveillance towards any person suspected of links to anti-democratic organisations.\n\n- Arrest and keep any person suspected of anti-democratic activities imprisoned without a trial for a maximum of fourteen days.\n\n- An anti-democratic organisation, for the purposes of this law, includes any organisation that seeks to overthrow the constitutional order of the Russian Democratic Federative Republic through plotting to install a monarch, a military ruler, or anyone with ties to the banned SZRS or its successors. Similarly, the law applies to Bolshevik groups taking orders from any banned parties.\n\nThis law takes effect in [?global.date.GetDateStringNoHourLong] and will remain in effect for the duration of a single year and must be passed again by the State Duma to remain in power.\n\nThe law was signed into effect in [GetDateText] by the President of the Russian Democratic Federative Republic, Daniil Yegorovich Sulimov."
 demrus.83.a: "Long live the republic!"

 demrus.84.t: "Attempt on the Chairman-Minister's Life"
 demrus.84.d: "The motorcade was travelling from the airport of Khodynskoye Pole towards the Kremlin, just as disaster struck. Chairman-Minister Vladimir Levitsky was in the second Buick as a bomb was thrown on its hood, killing the driver immediately. A second later, three men emerged and opened fire from a nearby building, peppering the ministerial car with bullets. The men of state security were quick to react and returned fire.\n\nLevitsky himself was only grazed by the bullets, but sitting next to him, his adjutant Zhan Duppor was killed by two shots in the chest, and many others were wounded. Only one of the attackers was taken alive, while the others perished in the shoot-out. According to the police investigation, the shooter was Pavel Timofeyevich Gorgulov, ex-member of the SZRS Combat Squads. He explained he had no regrets and that he had only been defending the Motherland and Freedom from the communist dogs trying to usurp it. The man will likely face execution or life in prison."
 demrus.84.a: "That was close."

 demrus.85.t: "Putting the Cheka to Shame"
 demrus.85.d: "The attempt on the Chairman-Minister's life, conspiracy in the military, and the general unrest all have led President Sulimov to announce a state of emergency. While the state of emergency was downscaled from the nigh-dictatorial powers it used to have under the 1922 Constitution into a reduced form, the combination of infiltrated police and Okhrana, the Law on Defence of the Republic, and the state of emergency give the government the power to arrest anyone deemed to be an enemy of the republic. This has led to mass arrests, as the director of Okhrana, Yakov Blyumkin, has spearheaded arrests of key monarchists, businessmen, and officers suspected of anti-republican connections.\n\nWith the extraordinary powers of the state of emergency, thousands have been arrested and their offices have been suspended. A large number of 'Svobodnik' organisations have been disbanded, and many police have been laid off and replaced with socialists. There have been mass protests in cities and non-compliance in the countryside, but order has been kept by the police and their auxiliary volunteers supplied by local labour unions.\n\nBut the situation cannot last. We must move quickly, or the military will move against us."
 demrus.85.a: "Onwards!"

 demrus.86.t: "[GetYear] Snap Elections of the State Duma"
 demrus.86.d: "Due to great changes to the Russian parliamentary field, new elections will be called in a week by President Sulimov, who has dissolved the Duma for now. As multiple parliamentary parties such as the VPP and SOR are now banned as monarchist and anti-republican, the vacancies held by their delegates will need to be filled by proper pro-democratic delegates. Multiple former Duma members have been put under arrest for the duration of investigations, with charges ranging from crimes committed during the Savinkov regime to connections to conspiratorial monarchist or pro-German organisations.\n\nAs it stands, the major parties that are preparing their campaigns on short notice are the Radical-Democrats, the Socialist-Revolutionaries, and the Kadets. The nation is on the precipice of anarchy and worry, with many remembering the tumultuous chaos of 1917."
 demrus.86.a: "I assure you, it will not be a repeat of February."

 demrus.87.t: "Formation of the Workers' Coalition"
 demrus.87.d: "A congress was held between representatives of the Radical-Democratic Party and the two parties of Socialist-Revolutionaries with the intent to craft an electoral alliance. While Vladimir Rikhter, the chairman of the Right-SRs, is a believer in radical republicanism, he has started to waver and doubt, claiming that Sulimov is unfairly favouring the socialists. The same concerns are held by the rest of the party, and Rikhter started to make demands of the leftist parties to ensure the current form of the Russian republic. He only received vague promises of upholding democracy.\n\nAs it stands, a majority of Right-Socialist-Revolutionaries walked out of the congress, calling Levitsky's party a 'mere Menshevik phantom'. The minority faction of the Right-SRs around Pitirim Sorokin stood, and expressed their intent to join the Party of Left-Socialist-Revolutionaries.\n\nThe most important agreement was the declaration of the Workers' Coalition, an electoral alliance between the PLSR and RDP, a union of the peasant and the worker. With their extensive campaign networks and large number of mobilised supporters, they went to take control of Russia from the bourgeois parties."
 demrus.87.a: "RDP fares better."
 demrus.87.b: "SRs are in fire."

 demrus.88.t: "Workers' Coalition Secures Majority"
 demrus.88.d: "The elections were technically fair. However, in practice, the vast majority of the right wing were hindered from running, as their party organisations had been banned before the elections, and there were instances of voter intimidation. The conservatives criticised the elections as a Red re-run of the 1934 elections, which were technically legal but obviously skewed.\n\nBut it is useless to complain after the milk has been spilled. The Workers' Coalition, the electoral coalition between RDP and PLSR, managed to secure around 65% of the vote - less than they had hoped - as the right wing all coalesced around the Kadet party despite everything that the socialists were doing to stop them.\n\nWhat this means is that Vladimir Levitsky has formed his second government, this time without bourgeois ministers to satisfy the coalition's right-wing. Instead, the cabinet is composed of entirely of socialists from the Radical-Democratic Party and the Left-Socialist-Revolutionaries. Large protests have been organised against the election result, and it has been challenged in courts as unlawful, but it changes nothing in the short term."
 demrus.88.a: "Victory for the common folk!"

 demrus.89.t: "The Duma Votes to Extend State of Emergency"
 demrus.89.d: "In the first session of the new 'Workers' Duma', the State Duma accepted the extension of President Sulimov's state of emergency, in practice greenlighting further persecution of non-socialists in the name of radical republicanism for 'as long as it takes to stabilise the nation'. With it, the anti-republican resistance is being eroded, and even the threat of the military is dissipating as it seems that a majority of Russians do support Sulimov's actions.\n\nGeneral Aleksandr Vasilevsky has not been the friendliest towards the president, but he has nonetheless posted many conspiratorial generals into the Far East and sought to eradicate potential coups 'for the good of the Republic'. In private, he defended his actions to his general colleagues, arguing that he is obeying the orders of his superior, the president, and that even a socialist republic is better than a second civil war - a mentality that many would definitely agree on."
 demrus.89.a: "The Third Russian Revolution is there."

 demrus.90.t: "An Old Bolshevik Returns"
 demrus.90.d: "The Law of Forgiving forgave all 1917-1921 crimes that have not been prosecuted already, and pardoned the remaining communists still sitting their sentences, except for those in prison for murder, or who have committed crimes after 1921. In practice, this means that many of the Civil War era Bolsheviks are allowed to return back to Russia without fear of prosecution.\n\nThe most high-profile returnee for now has been Lev Kamenev - a terribly divisive figure among modern Russian left. His trial in 1922 divided the nation and ultimately ended up with Kamenev avoiding the death penalty despite his important role in the Bolshevik leadership, and instead sitting in 10 years in prison until President Maklakov pardoned him due to old age and health. Kamenev's pamphlet, 'Theses on the Past Proletarian Revolutions' was a monumental change of tone among the former Bolsheviks, as Kamenev argued for cooperation and reunification with Mensheviks, and abandoning vanguardism.\n\nKamenev fled the country in 1933 out of fear of Svobodnik death squads, and has only now returned, together with a group of other red émigrés.\n\nKamenev returned to a cheering crowd in Petrograd, where local labour organisations and RDP branch had organised celebrations. The local RDP radical, Sergey Kirov, welcomed Kamenev back home personally."
 demrus.90.a: "Welcome!"

 demrus.100.d: "The old conservatives and other self-declared patriots of the Duma have taken arms against our policies. We have been accused of ignoring national security and not giving the army the respect they deserve as the foremost guardians of the Constitution.\n\nIt is no secret that politicians with clear connections in the military are at the forefront of these claims, along with the right wing press that has been reveling in every case of our 'incompetence'. Militant rhetoric is rising, and this revanchism does seem to have supporters both in the Duma and in the public."
 demrus.100.a: "Let us take a more militant course, then."
 demrus.100.b: "Let's try to appease them the best we can."
 demrus.100.c: "And make the opposition look better? Nonsense!"

 demrus.101.t: "A Visit from the General-Fieldmarshal"
 demrus.101.d: "It is a dreaded, unfortunate political tradition of the Russian Republic for 'representatives of the General Staff' to appear suddenly and seek to discuss matters with the President. The army has the power to define governments if it so seeks - perhaps its most powerful shows of power have been torpedoing Chernov's almost-sure presidency in 1926, and pressuring the Avksentyev Administration into the catastrophic Fengtian War.\n\nNow, [RUS_GetArmyChief]'s representatives are demanding President [ROOT.GetLeader] to confirm what kind of role the military's trusted politicians will have in the future Duma and State Council committees. It seems that the military brass is growing less and less happy with our government, and are now demanding more of 'their men' at the important tables. It is no secret that almost every party has these 'patriots' who serve as political spokespersons for the army."
 demrus.101.a: "Naturally, we will always consult the army!"
 demrus.101.b: "They are welcome to talk, but we are under no obligation to obey."
 demrus.101.c: "Military influence should be banished from politics."

 demrus.102.t: "The Generals' Letter"
 demrus.102.d: "The letter has been signed by over 20 high-ranking generals, and 60 lower-ranking ones. In it, they express their 'most grave concern' over 'irresponsible security policy and entirely lacking focus on defence forces'. They claim that 'the current administration of [ROOT.GetLeader] is running Russian defence capabilities into the ground, and ignoring the ever-increasingly tense political situation'. Thus, 'we cannot in good conscience and within our soldier's duty remain silent, but must plead the President to reverse course and heed the advice of security professionals'.\n\nIn the end, there was a threat of mass resignation by the general staff. Even if, in private, some in our cabinet would be happy to see that, in practice it would be the end of our government - too many hearts are on the side of the men who saved Russia from both Communism and Savinkov. The only question is, to what degree do we have to cower?"
 demrus.102.a: "Make some token changes..."
 demrus.102.b: "Divert them some extra funds, as they want."

 demrus.103.t: "The Sword of Damocles Falls"
 demrus.103.d: "Russian democracy owes everything to the Russian Army. Without it, Russia would be enslaved to Bolshevik tyranny. And as such, the military has always held that it has the moral obligation to intervene if the civilian government is endangering the interests of Russia. And now, that day has come.\n\nIn the early hours of dawn, Guards units of the Moscow Military District entered the capital and swiftly secured bridges and the radio station before entering the Kremlin. General-Fieldmarshal [RUS_GetArmyChief] arrested the government and declared martial law in the city until proper transfer of power is organised. In a simple radio address by the military to the people, it was assured that a responsible government would soon take the reins, and the military would only see its role as guarantor of the nation. That the former government, accused of various crimes against the Russian nation, would be tried in civilian courts, and everything would return to normalcy soon enough."

General-Fieldmarshal [RUS_GetArmyChief] arrested the government and declared martial law in the city until proper transfer of power is organised. In a simple radio address by the military to the people, the former government was outed as unpatriotic sycophants who were caught trying to negotiate with Berlin in secret. When the treason was revealed, it left the military no other course of action but to act."
 demrus.103.a: "The Sword of Damocles has fallen upon us."

 demrus.104.t: "The State Serves the Army"
 demrus.104.d: "Apathetic elections were organised. With the level of irregularities in the voting, and visible military presence in urban centres, it seemed likely that there was no hope for a free and fair electoral process. Of course, General-Fieldmarshal [RUS_GetArmyChief] spoke of solidarity and the importance of stability, but the words rang hollow as it was clear that he and other generals were strong-arming Russian democracy to do their bidding. The elections felt to many like the Duma elections after the Stolypin coup of 1908: pointless.\n\nIn the end, the conservatives and the right wing Kadets held a majority of the seats - largely being the favourites of the military. As the former president was forced to resign after the coup, the new parliament will start by electing the eighth President of the Russian Democratic Federative Republic."
 demrus.104.a: "Safe and sound government."

 # Right-wing anger
 demrus.105.t: "Creation of the Young Guard"
 demrus.105.d: "After the ban of SZRS and a number of other 'Svobodnik' organisations, the Russian far-right was essentially beheaded. But like a Hydra, a new head will always grow, and now it has taken the form of the Young Guard. The Guard claims to be a 'non-partisan political movement' that 'mobilises patriots to defend Great Russia'. Initially, it was led by Savinkov's former acquaintance Yury Shirinsky-Shikhmatov, but he is currently imprisoned for his actions in 1936, and the leadership has passed to former Colonel Sergey Ivanov.\n\nThe movement is clearly modelled after the Iron Guard in Romania, and espouses ultra-reactionary beliefs - though clearly avoiding any statements that would connect them to Savinkov too closely. As the Guardsmen are organising new marches, many are most reminded of the Black Hundreds and their successor organisations. The Guard has tried to avoid violence and other clear illegalities, presumably out of fear that the movement will be banned immediately."
 demrus.105.a: "Ban them."
 demrus.105.b: "They are insignificant."

 demrus.106.t: "Protests from the Clergy"
 demrus.106.d: "The Russian Orthodox Church became independent from Imperial-era political control in 1917 as the Patriarchate was separated from the state. The relationship between the Church and the State has not been all that happy after that, but there have been many points of conflict, especially with land reforms targeting the Church's land ownership.\n\nBut now the situation has grown worse and worse, as the Patriarch has been taking a more clear side with conservative politicians. They have been supporting conservative candidates in local elections, and sometimes even plainly telling the peasants at church to vote for some specific candidate, to save Russia from the wayward rule of [ROOT.GetLeader]."
 demrus.106.a: "Introduce legislation to reduce their influence."
 demrus.106.b: "They have the right to say it."
 demrus.106.c: "The state must support and promote the church!"

 demrus.107.t: "Conservative Opposition Mounting"
 demrus.107.d: "As our actions stir more and more resistance from the right, we are starting to gain some very powerful enemies. Most recently, the VSZ - All-Russian Union of Landowners - announced they would do their best to oppose government policy, and instead fund the 'patriotic opposition'. In their view, the administration is controlled by liberal elites detached from the realities and experiences of the average Russian.\n\nWith many wealthy backers turning their back to us, pressure is starting to boil over in the Duma as more and more deputies in our coalition are calculating if it is worth it to stick with our government if it means a potential end to their political career."
 demrus.107.a: "That's not good."

 demrus.108.t: "The Patriots March"
 demrus.108.d: "A wave of protest marches was organised today in Moscow, Tsaritsyn and a number of other cities, especially in the southern regions. In it, dozens of veterans' and reservists' organisations, the Cossack organisations, and various other 'patriotic associations' mobilised people against the government.\n\nThe demonstrators carried flags in the Romanov colours, religious icons, and other right-wing symbols, and included some high-ranking retired generals. In some towns, there was fighting between the marchers and the left wing counter-protests, and it is feared that if these demonstrations continue, even more instability will follow. This 'Patriotic Movement' is demanding the resignation of certain 'pro-socialist' ministers from [GetSecondInCommand]'s government, and demanding more serious actions against the rising socialist threat."
 demrus.108.a: "Keep order, with a Nagant if we have to."
 demrus.108.b: "Dismiss left-wing ministers."
 demrus.108.c: "Pass stricter anti-socialist laws."

 demrus.109.t: "Revolt from the Right"
 demrus.109.d: "The right wing resistance turned into a full-blown political crisis today, as a significant part of our own party and coalition announced that they could not support our government in the vote of no confidence raised by the right. With full-blown rebellion in our own ranks, it seems almost sure that [GetSecondInCommand]'s government will collapse, and we will face a deadlocked Duma. Hasty negotiations between [ROOT.GetLeader] and the cabinet ministers have given only one real course of action - to make the necessary concessions and deals within our coalition to ensure our political survival.\n\nThis will not look good for us, but the other option seems even worse - leaving Russia without a functional majority in the Duma, and subsequently with a government that can only serve as a temporary housekeeper until new elections can be called."
 demrus.109.a: "I will not be blackmailed!"
 demrus.109.b: "Compromise hurts, but is necessary."
 RUS_deadlock_tt: "§RThis will lock you out of various national focuses until the national spirit is removed either through new elections or through exceptional circumstances.§!"

 #Left-wing anger
 demrus.110.t: "Socialists Demand Unbanning"
 demrus.110.d: "It was hoped that, with the new Constitution, the 1923 Anti-Communist Laws would have been repealed. The laws have never really worked in practice, and many argue that, against Savinkov, the socialists were the only ones who seriously resisted the would-be dictator. Even some liberals have called for repealing these laws, arguing that Russia should already move on - the Red traitors have been punished already.\n\nAn address with tens of thousands of names was organised across party lines. It is mainly supported by the socialists, but also has the approval of many influential names like Vladimir Nabokov, Sergey Chakhotin, and Pyotr Struve."
 demrus.110.a: "Yes, the Anti-Communist Laws are a stain on our democracy."
 demrus.110.b: "Turn your back on a Communist, and he will shoot you in the back."

 demrus.111.t: "Revolutionary Agitation Spreading"
 demrus.111.d: "The practice of 'revolutionary prophets' began with the Narodniks and SRs - zealously revolutionary men and women travelling the vastness of Russia, from village to village, spreading their revolutionary gospel to the common people. Even though far more people are literate now, this practice has not stopped - instead, it has expanded, with illegal socialist pamphlets often being printed by small private printing presses in the countryside.\n\nThe police have noticed a clear rise in both the amount and radicalism of these underground publications, marking a growing domestic threat. Where such agitation is found, revolutionary cells appear soon after."
 demrus.111.a: "Do your best to suppress them."

 demrus.112.t: "A Wave of Strikes"
 demrus.112.d: "Growing left-wing radicalism often channels into action in the form of strikes. There have been more and longer labour conflicts lately, and just now a group of labour unions, largely the metalworkers and the dockworkers, have called for the longest strikes in some time.\n\nTheir demands include increases in wages and better working conditions, but they also clearly harbour political goals - including the freeing of socialist political prisoners and the easing up of anti-labour organisation censorship. The strikes have grown especially powerful in Petrograd and Chelyabinsk, where they have escalated into violence, leaving the police somewhat underequipped to handle the situation."
 demrus.112.a: "The strikes will stop eventually."
 demrus.112.b: "Try to negotiate with the strikers."
 demrus.112.c: "Force is the only thing the communists understand."

 demrus.113.t: "A Political Assassination!"
 demrus.113.d: "Four shots at close range. The assassin shot immediately, and the target died later in the hospital. The good old classic story from Russia.\n\nSadly, this crime casts a shadow on our restored democracy and reminds many of the terrible era of political violence in the early 1930s. This assassination by an anarchist connected to the Maximalists was denounced widely, though there is the undeniable adoration of this kind of revolutionary terror on the political fringes."
 demrus.113.a: "Goddamn Nechayev and his stupid book."
 RUS_okhrana_expanded_tt: "§GThis effect would be worse if we had not expanded the Okhrana.§!"

 demrus.114.t: "Nationwide Railway-workers' Strike"
 demrus.114.d: "Vikzhel - the leading committee of the Union of Railwaymen - has called a great nationwide strike, supported by the VTsSPS's official statement penned by Mikhail Tomsky. This great strike has all but paralysed Russia, as the vast majority of logistics have come to a halt. The factories are running out of raw materials, and shops are not being stocked. This kind of mass protest reminds people of the strikes of 1917 that brought down the Russian Empire, and have put the government and the police on red alert.\n\nThe strikers demand an end to anti-labour policies and recognition of the labour unions as an equal negotiation partner to the employers' unions and the Ministry of Industry and Trade. The employers are resisting this idea vehemently, entirely disagreeing with the idea of giving organised labour any official role to 'sabotage the economy'."
 demrus.114.a: "Disperse the strikes as illegal."
 demrus.114.b: "Negotiate and give them some concessions."

 demrus.115.t: "At the Precipice of a Revolution"
 demrus.115.d: "The great wave of strikes choking Russia has only expanded, despite our attempts to curb it. Left-wing sympathies are growing ever more common across Russia, often connected to grave disappointment in our government's actions. As the national mood edges towards a revolution, the Duma is similarly in flames. [GetSecondInCommand]'s government is bombarded from the right and left, and our coalition is at the breaking point - with parts of it demanding immediate, decisive action against the civil unrest, and others demanding a new, left-wing government that could properly calm down the situation.\n\nSome advisors fear that General-Fieldmarshal [RUS_GetArmyChief] will not tolerate any concessions to the revolutionaries, and expect that the military might react in a hostile way should [ROOT.GetLeader] appoint a left-wing government."
 demrus.115.a: "Give in and appoint a more left-wing government."
 demrus.115.b: "Not on my watch."

 demrus.120.t: "Meeting in the Kremlin"
 demrus.120.d.denikin: "It seemed a bit alarming to the president when General-Fieldmarshal Denikin requested to meet him with the smallest possible circle of advisors. [ROOT.GetLeader] entered the conference room with the Minister-Chairman under heavy guard. Already present were War Minister Denikin and a number of his trusted men, like Markov and even Wrangel, despite his disagreements with Denikin. The president was sure that he would be either arrested to be shot, or revealed something of great importance.\n\nMaps were spread on the table and shown to the president. They showed force concentrations all across the Russo-Mitteleuropan border from Petrograd to Rostov. These were no ordinary defensive formations, however, but offensive ones, nicknamed 'Operation Yekaterina', after the last conquest of the Ukrainian steppe.\n\nDenikin then explained that, in 1935, President Savinkov already requested an invasion plan to be drafted by General-Fieldmarshal Kornilov, whose staff had started preparing the operation under Denikin, who served as the Chief of Staff back then. The military was supportive of the plan, and had continued preparing it even after Savinkov's downfall. They are not requesting that the president accept it; they are informing the president that the plan exists and that the military expects full support from the president in this endeavour.\n\nSome more documents were shown to the president, which list various preparations that the military has already implemented, and they expect to be able to start the operation in 1939 or 1940. General-Fieldmarshal Markov is recommending haste, as intelligence reports that the German army has finally woken up to the threat and is rapidly strengthening.\n\nThe plan seems well prepared. It would not be hard to sell the war of reconquest politically. And the military does not seem to be taking no for an answer in any case, so the choice has been made already by the military conspiracy at the heart of the republic."
 demrus.120.d.wrangel: "General-Fieldmarshal Wrangel has requested an absolutely confidential meeting of unknown purpose with the Tsar and his Minister-Chairman. Such a call by the military would seem threatening to anyone else but the Tsar, but [ROOT.GetLeader] could trust his officers, even when entering a prepared conference room under heavy guard of men loyal to Wrangel, led by his right-hand man, General Shatilov. Even Denikin and Markov are present, despite their differences with Wrangel. It was truly an extraordinary meeting.\n\nMaps were spread on the table and shown to the Tsar. They showed force concentrations all across the Russo-Mitteleuropan border from Petrograd to Rostov. These were no ordinary defensive formations, however, but offensive ones, nicknamed 'Operation Yekaterina', after the last conquest of the Ukrainian steppe.\n\nWrangel then explained that in 1935, President Savinkov had already requested an invasion plan to be drafted by General-Fieldmarshal Kornilov, whose staff had started preparing the operation under Denikin, who served as the Chief of Staff back then. The military was supportive of the plan, and had continued preparing it even after Savinkov's downfall. While formally, they are requesting the Tsar's approval for it, the tone of the meeting is clear: they are explaining an already decided plan, and merely expecting the Tsar to give it his blessing.\n\nSome more documents were shown to the Tsar, which list various preparations that the military has already implemented, and they expect to be able to start the operation in 1939 or 1940. General-Fieldmarshal Markov is recommending haste, as intelligence reports that the German army has finally woken up to the threat and is rapidly strengthening.\n\nThe plan seems well-prepared. It would not be hard to sell the war of reconquest politically. And even if the Tsar disagreed with the plan - which he did not - the military does not seem to be taking no for an answer in any case."
 demrus.120.a: "Give the Peasant Marshal the President's blessing."
 demrus.120.b: "Give the Black Baron the Tsar's blessing, then."

 demrus.121.t: "A Conspiracy to Destroy Germany"
 demrus.121.d.socrus: "A clandestine meeting took place in Moscow today in the secure underground part of the War Ministry. The military delegation was to meet the Russian political and military leadership personally, as the matter was too secretive to risk the possibility of interception. It was under the leadership of General Georges Catroux, with Charles Delestraint as his deputy and Edmund Ironside leading the representation of the British military. They were received by [RUS.GetLeader] and the Russian chief of the army, [RUS_GetArmyChief], with his closest associates.\n\nThe purpose of the meeting was bold: to draft a coordinated plan that would destroy the German Empire between the hammer of France and the anvil of Russia. While, in practice, two separate fronts would not be able to cooperate much, decisions were made on encrypted channels for intel cooperation and plans for maintaining the Arctic maritime connection during the war.\n\nSome points of contention arose when strategic priorities were discussed. For the western delegation, the highest eastern priority was placed on Baku and other German oil reserves, while the Russians argued that the Baltics and Ukraine were more important directions. The actual strategy was left somewhat open, but all militaries agreed on permanent military attachés in each high command to smoothen future cooperation."
 demrus.121.d.demrus: "Surprisingly, a clandestine military meeting took place in Petrograd today, which would have been more in place in 1915 than in [GetYear]. A joint Franco-British military delegation met with General-Fieldmarshal [RUS_GetArmyChief] today in surprisingly positive terms. The delegation was under the leadership of General Georges Catroux, with Charles Delestraint as his deputy and Edmund Ironside leading the representation of the British military.\n\nOne could almost forget about the ideological disagreements of their respective governments as they laid out a strategic plan for the destruction of Germany in a calm, professional manner. Both sides withheld information, no doubt thinking about the possible future conflict if they manage to destroy Germany, but were open enough to agree on sharing relevant military intel and some other matters that would make cooperation easier.\n\nAfter all, both of them shared a simple, greater goal: the destruction of the German Empire and avenging the peace of 1919. And for these military men, it was a greater cause than any ideology."
 demrus.121.a: "The Entente Cordiale is back!"

 demrus.122.t: "The Shatilov Report"
 demrus.122.d: "'On the Development of the German Military in 1936-1939 in Relation to Russian National Security Interests', composed by General Pavel Nikolayevich Shatilov, the Fifth Department of the General Chief of Staff of the War Ministry. Synopsis.\n\nThe German military is the main point of comparison we refer to when evaluating the ability of the Russian Army to project power in Europe. Based on a 1935 evaluation of the Russian and German armies, it seemed likely that the German army would suffer from multiple organisational and material challenges should the war have happened at that point.\n\nHowever, the German General Staff has woken up to this threat after the global upheaval of 1936. The German Army has increased its numbers greatly after 1936, especially in terms of armoured vehicles and bombing aircraft. Organisational reforms of the German army are specifically geared towards increasing the fighting ability of the Heer in a possible future conflict.\n\nBased on the calculations by the Fifth Department, the German military advantage compared to the Russian Army and to their other potential enemy, the French Army, is growing rapidly. Our intelligence has acquired reasonable evidence [see appendix 2] that the German military-political leadership is actively pursuing offensive military planning, chiefly 'Fall Scharnhorst', an invasion of France, as a means to secure Germany's western flank in a potential war against Russia. Thus, the War Ministry recommends the immediate preparation of a pre-emptive operation against any German attempt to drastically change the military-strategic status quo of Europe within the next year. If such operations are not undertaken, Germany's military supremacy on the European continent will become impossible to challenge by only the Russian Army."
 demrus.122.a: "Publish it!"
 demrus.122.b: "Keep it private."

 demrus.123.t: "Minister of War Calls Emergency Meeting"
 demrus.123.d: "General-Fieldmarshal [RUS_GetArmyChief] has requested an emergency meeting of the cabinet to discuss actions that the government will be taking following the Shatilov Report's recommendations. Chairman-Minister [GetSecondInCommand] was undeniably bitter about such a request, as it showcases how the Minister of War is, in practice, more powerful than the head of government, if push comes to shove.\n\nIt was no ordinary cabinet meeting, either. The Minister of War, [RUS_GetArmyChief], was essentially requesting the [RUS_leader]'s permission to start preparations for Operation Yekaterina, the pre-emptive invasion of German-controlled Eastern Europe. While the decision on war and peace rests on the State Duma and the [RUS_leader], the military only needs the permission of [GetSecondInCommand] to start implementing the necessary precautions in case of war.\n\nThe implicit threat was clear: the army merely expects political backing for already-decided operations, and if that is not given, the government may lose the trust of the whole army."
 demrus.123.a: "If the army is ready..."
 demrus.123.b: "I'm hurt he ever doubted my patriotism."
 demrus.123.c: "Or what? You're going to arrange a coup?"

 demrus.124.t: "Titov under Fire"
 demrus.124.d: "Recent events in Europe have brought tension to an all-time high, not seen since the Lake Lubahn Crisis in 1934. Kadet and VPP press have been rigorously calling for remilitarisation so that the republic may be defended against a German invasion that seems increasingly inevitable.\n\nAt worst, this was concerning for Titov, who has expressed reservations about extensive rearmament and war with Germany. But intra-party tensions have been brought to an all-time high when Daniil Sulimov, leader of the party's left-wing, wrote an article in the RDP newspaper, 'Iskra', criticising the president's indecisiveness.\n\nSulimov's article could best be summed up as: 'If Russia does not come for Germany, then Germany will come for Russia'. German leadership is nervous, ready to send its eastern forces in Moscow's direction at will. Russia must rearm - not for imperialist ambitions, but because Berlin cannot, in good faith, be trusted to be rational. Will Russia sit idly by as the Kaiser's cronies plot the subjugation of all Europe to their will? Not to mention that the Internationale, too, seems to be on a warpath with the Germans - and to be neutral in the battle between reaction and revolution will be aiding the reactionaries.\n\nPersonal scepticism of mass rearmament aside, Titov knew that this criticism could not simply be shaken off. Sulimov's criticism has ended up being quite the embarrassment for the moderate faction of the RDP, which has seen its leadership seriously challenged for the second time. With the Russian public and political circles seemingly all in favour of a coming war, perhaps, he reasoned, it was time he stepped in line."
 demrus.124.a: "Idealism dies when weapons are drawn."

 demrus.125.t: "Agronomic Crisis on Long Fuse"
 demrus.125.d: "Going through the numbers, it is seemingly clear that the Land Committee under the Savinkov regime was essentially engaging in speculation. The Land Committee gave the peasants ample loans to establish new farms with modern agricultural machinery on the Kyrgyz Steppe. These farmers generally had no ability to pay back debts of this size, though the intent seemed to be to create new Russian farms within the borders of the Alash Autonomy, where vast amounts of dirt cheap land could be given after it was confiscated from the locals.\n\nNow this has created a large group of small farmers with heavy debts to the State Bank, who were expected to multiply the size of their farms by moving to the Kyrgyz Steppe as settlers. Obviously, this is an illegal scheme and breaks the federal rights of the Alash Autonomy.\n\nWe could simply grit our teeth and forgive the debts, and accept that the money is lost to the state - though this would also be seen as the state shovelling money on failing farmers. We could also try to strong-arm the Alash Government into a deal, where they accept a certain quota of these farmers - likely in exchange for state investment projects in Alash. Or we could continue as Savinkov intended, by settling these people in the steppe, and just tell the Alash Government to accept it."
 demrus.125.a: "Forgive those debts."
 demrus.125.b: "Force a deal with the Alash government."
 demrus.125.c: "Continue with settling the Kyrgyz Steppe"

 demrus.160.t: "The Impossible Healing"
 demrus.160.d: "As the guns fell silent in 1921, vengeance was the all-consuming mood in the nation. Few voices of restraint and forgiveness, ones that had greater historical insight than the rest, were heeded, and the cycle of revenge and blood was continued. Even if many former Reds were eventually pardoned, no attempt was made to understand.\n\nAs Aleksandr Herzen once wrote: It is impossible to fight against dogmas, against beliefs, no matter how crazy they may be, with denial alone, no matter how clever it may be - to say 'don't believe!' is in essence as absurd as to say 'believe!'. Understanding one's enemies is at once forgiveness, justification, reconciliation.\n\nBut those seeking to understand the Communist movement and its attraction were viewed with constant suspicion and ultimately silenced. The Republic could not offer a new idea to believe in; it could only say: do not believe in socialism, do not believe in Savinkov, do not believe in this and that. Was it a surprise to anyone that it fell?\n\nNow the guns have fallen silent again, as our tricolour flies over the Brandenburg Gate. We failed one rebuilding, one recovery already, and now it is in our hands to build an entirely new Europe. Both at home and outside, we must thoroughly denounce the politics of vengeance and instead look at the hearts of our enemies to understand them - and prove that we can be better, that our values are more powerful, that they will be victorious in the grand narrative of History."
 demrus.160.a: "Progress is the desire to elevate man to human status."

 demrus.161.t: "A Ray of Hope"
 demrus.161.d.rikhter: "The Great Russian Revolution of 1917 set us great boundaries. It is impossible to begin the revival of Russia without a clear national self-consciousness. And it is impossible to clarify one's national consciousness without grasping its basic idea, without understanding the paths travelled. Russia is not a sheet of white paper. It would be madness to revive Russia, starting all over again. The task of the moment is to understand what has been passed, to discard what has been experienced, to preserve the living grain and to grow it on the ploughed soil in a new life.\n\nWas this not the foundational idea of the Narodnik movement, when they began to wake up the Russian people from the night of autocracy? Not to borrow the Western forms of capitalist parliamentarism, but to build on the solid foundation that we already have. The song of eternal Peasant Russia burns in our hearts, in the hearts of people all across our nation, and we only have to listen to it - and perhaps, we will find peace and happiness - not just for the Russians, Ukrainians, and Belarusians, but for all peoples.\n\nRadio Speech of President Vladimir Rikhter, [?global.date.GetDateStringNoHourLong]"
 demrus.161.d.fondaminsky: "Our historical calling, our deed, consists of this: that through our disappointment, our suffering, we reach humility and submission before the truth - and free the next generations from these sorrows. We have gone through the Brothers' War to purge ourselves of the Godless Man-Beasts that Bolshevism stirred to the surface. We toppled the reign of the Terrorist, purging the disease of chauvinism and national hatred. And now, we have toppled the Kaiser and the Germanic shackles restraining Europe's spiritual and social development.\n\nThrough all this suffering, Russia has emerged as a Christ-like figure - I do not mean it in the sense of the Savinkovite apocalyptic delusion, but in the true sense, that of love and compassion through suffering. It is our duty to future generations - those of Russians, Ukrainians, Belarusians, yes - but also future generations of Poles, Germans, and all other peoples of the world - to learn from these tragedies and use our historical circumstances to build something that will last, so that our children and their children will not have to go through the bloodshed of the 20th century.\n\nRadio Speech of [RUS_HeadOfExecutive] Ilya Fondaminsky, [?global.date.GetDateStringNoHourLong]"
 demrus.161.d.other: "The roots of Russia have always been vested in idealism. Our nation has gone through multiple almost mortal threats, and at each point, the fall into the abyss was so close it is difficult to believe that we did not falter. Many lost faith in the Russian idea during the past decades, going so far as to argue that we were in an unbreakable cycle, a peasant nation with authoritarian institutions, incapable of escaping the inevitable drift back towards Tsarist autocracy, albeit in many new forms, from Communism to Svobodism.\n\nBut Russia has no 'special path'. Russia has no divinely ordained Doom or Purpose; Russia is a nation of peoples like any other. We are not predisposed towards tyranny any more than the French, the nation that invented the concept of Absolute Monarchy. It is true that we have our own set of peculiar, unique conditions, but does not every nation have these?\n\nNow on this historical day, it is our task to define the future of much of Europe. We cannot fall into exceptionalism and dreaming at such a moment. Democracy is only built through hard work and strong faith in the future, and this task is never done. Let us be an example, a torch to all the world!\n\nRadio Speech of the [RUS_HeadOfExecutive], [?global.date.GetDateStringNoHourLong]"
 demrus.161.a: "There is only one undoubted happiness in life - to live for others."

 demrus.162.t: "The Natural State"
 demrus.162.start: "There is no period in Russian history when such a great nation has been allowed to wander freely. Everyone, from Russian liberals to socialists to monarchists, has understood that a nation as large and environmentally challenged as ours requires a guiding hand, and in times when this guiding hand has failed, a Time of Troubles has set us back for decades, if not centuries. The idealism of the Bakunins and Tolstoys might fit running a peasant commune, but in matters of the entire Russian nation, it would be dangerous and irresponsible for any government to not maintain a firm hand."
 demrus.162.d.socdem: "$demrus.162.start$\n\nWith President Titov's re-election after the victorious war, Russia finds itself in an odd place: governed by the Social Democrats, but still clearly the leader of the anti-socialist bloc of the West. Titov has often spoken against the 'revolutionary tyranny' of the West, instead always standing up for moderation. The Radical-Democratic Party has grown greatly and successfully convinced many workers of the cities from more radical political beliefs into its ranks. After all, most of these poor workers support socialism because of their own living conditions - a matter that has greatly improved with the RDP's social programmes. Similarly, the Vsodes has managed to entrench itself as the leader of the Russian labour unions, maintaining close connections with the government. All this has given the RDP a clear edge over other parties. Unburdened by accusations of socialism, Titov has emerged as a leader outside political divides: a Social Democrat who restored Russian pride."
 demrus.162.d.soclib: "$demrus.162.start$\n\nThe Party of Socialist-Revolutionaries has been the largest party in the State Duma for most of the interwar years, and that political status quo has been restored more than ever. And is that not simply natural for Russia? After all, we are a nation of peasants, despite all the advances. We are a nation of sleepy little villages and rural townlets. These depths of Russia are our base, for the rural folk know that the Socialist-Revolutionaries will always stand for them, against the capitalists and the bureaucrats of Moscow and other centres. The PSR has become the undisputed leading party of Russian political and societal life. We have helped great numbers of poor peasant families to acquire education, gifted men and women who are joining politics and civil service more and more often, further solidifying the role of Socialist-Revolutionaries as the party of all Russia."
 demrus.162.d.marlib: "$demrus.162.start$\n\nThe Constitutional-Democratic Union has often been insulted as a spineless political machine, the establishment party only concerned with governance. But given the tumultuous past, should we not be proud of a such a description - a party of responsible governance! For people know that Kadets are reliable, educated and trustworthy, not taken into ideological flights of fancy. Our party has always been the favourite of the civil service, judiciary, and business life, but with our greatly strengthened position, it is that more than ever. After all, it was under Constitutional-Democrats that Russian pride and freedoms were restored, and failures of the past forgotten."
 demrus.162.d.soccon: "$demrus.162.start$\n\nOur party stands for responsible governance, supported by the increasing conservative class of farmers, veterans of the war, and the civil service. Our brand of conservatism is firmly rooted in reason: an idea that there is a correct and wrong way of governance, and simply through the wisdom of the statesmen, we can make the correct choices. It has been proven time and again that the Russian people are simply too uneducated - well-meaning, surely, and often in good faith - to direct the state properly, and will always need those more educated to handle their duty of steering Great Russia, like a captain steers the ship and is responsible for the well-being of every man on board."

 demrus.163.t: "In the Footsteps of Saint George"
 demrus.163.d: "The German Dragon has been slain, but threats to our Russian way of life do not end there. As Emperor Aleksandr I began our role as the policeman of Europe, maintainer of all that is good and proper, so must we understand our role despite the ideological chaos of the 20th century. This is the role that has fallen on the shoulders of Russia time and again.\n\nDid we not defend the Christendom of Europe from the Asiatic hordes, as its stalwart eastern guard? Did we not continue the millennia-old tradition of the Roman Empire after the fall of Constantinople? Did we not defend all that was good and proper against the Robespierrean tyranny?\n\nSome claim that Russia is in some way inherently authoritarian, but we disagree. Instead, Russia's path is that of a holy warrior, God's Knight following a simple life. He has no time for flights of fancy, for his duty and faith are too great. To the faithless, this may seem like authoritarianism and meekness, but a man of faith recognises this as the path of Saint George.\n\n[RUS_leader] [ROOT.GetLeader] and his loyal commander-in-chief, [RUS_GetArmyChief] have established themselves as leaders in the struggle against [INT.GetNameDef] and their allies, the ugly daughters of the original revolution hell-bent to spread their mob justice and chaos.

 demrus.164.d.solonevich_republic: "'When I accepted this office, I had a single dream - that one day, this nation would control her own destiny. That it would become a nation of action, not words, ruled by will, not committee. Where power and justice are back where they belong: in the hands of the people! Where every man is free to think - to act - for himself! Without sycophantic bankers or ivory tower bureaucrats! That Russia - the diseased, rotten Russia - is gone, it has been burnt down by trial by war and fire. And from its ashes, a new Russia has been born! Our Great Russian Republic, one and undivided!'\n\nGreat applause follows President Solonevich's speech. For a moment, one might imagine that Vozhd is still in power, and this is merely one of many SZRS rallies, albeit with fewer party flags, but even more Russian tricolours. But unlike Savinkov, who was unable to even maintain control of the nation, President Solonevich holds the keys to the Russian future in his hands."
 demrus.164.d.peoples_monarchy: "The current age of the Russian Empire is approximately equal to that of the Roman Empire - about eleven centuries. The only difference is that the Roman Empire - with the exception of Carthage - had no rivals, and that in the last three hundred years of its existence it was falling apart economically, politically and psychologically. Modern Russia - even at its weakest - is crushing all its competitors and shows absolutely no signs of internal disintegration.\n\nUtopians of all stripes - socialists, communists, anarchists, solidarists - promise anything and everything to anyone: before us everything was bad - under us everything will be good.\n\nWe monarchists categorically refuse to depict both the old and the new Russian monarchy as a substitute for paradise on earth, as socialists depicted socialism. We affirm: in all centuries of human history and among all peoples of mankind there has always been a struggle between religions and estates, classes and professions, groups and interests. It will continue in the future Russia. Any other claim would be a deliberate lie. We recognise the inevitability of this struggle, and we strive to have One Man who would stand ABOVE this struggle, and not be a result of the struggle, as any dictator is, or a powerless accident in this struggle, as any president is.\n\nWe can establish this firm fact: the Russian people, who have lived and continue to live in immeasurably more difficult conditions than any other cultured people in the history of mankind, have created the most powerful state in this history. During the time of the Tatar hordes, Russia fought essentially against all of Asia - and defeated it. During the time of Napoleon, Russia fought essentially against all of Europe and defeated it. Now, in the Great Patriotic War, we once again triumphed. If not for our tragic setbacks in the past centuries, Russia would now have a population of more than three hundred million, would have an industry approximately equal to the American one, would have a culture and statehood immeasurably superior to the American ones.\n\nRussian nationality, statehood and culture reflect with an extraordinary degree of sharpness the individual characteristics of the Russian people, fundamentally different from the individual characteristics of both Europe and Asia. Russia is not Europe, but neither is it Asia or even Eurasia. It is simply Russia. A completely unique national state and cultural complex, equally clearly different from both Europe and Asia.\n\nChairman-Minister Ivan Solonevich, [?global.date.GetDateStringNoHourLong]"
 demrus.164.d.SOR: "People sometimes forget their duties to the Nation; but such peoples perish. They turn into land, into fertiliser, on which other, stronger nations grow and grow stronger.\n- Pyotr Stolypin\n\nThe German Empire and their allies lay in ruins, as a fertiliser for stronger empires. What can we learn from their fall? Naturally, the simple strength and ability of the Russian Army played a key role in the victory, as did heroic, inspirational leadership by Wrangel himself. But ultimately it is a question of German weakness. Like Nikolay, Wilhelm was forced to accept demands that tied his hands, and weakened Germany at the critical moment. Even if Germany avoided revolution, they entered a state of stagnation and weakening, one that even men like Schleicher could not turn around quickly enough. At the same time, Russia burned - but they were rejuvenating flames, ones that remade Russian society into pure, untempered steel.\n\nChairman-Minister Shulgin's ideological mentor, the late Pyotr Stolypin, would be proud of the Russia that we have built. A strong class of patriotic, religious peasantry, proud of their service in the Great Patriotic War, serves as the backbone of our restored monarchy. The Imperial Government wields the power to maintain Russian prosperity and stability while avoiding the worst pitfalls of the past empire. Under Wrangel's watchful eye, Russia has merged the best of both worlds - the unique spiritual-moral quality of the Russian soul, and the modern economy and political system of the idealised German Empire."

 demrus.165.t: "Taking up the Mantle"
 demrus.165.d: "The recent years have not been kind to democracy. At the same time the Savinkovist dictatorship was narrowly avoided in Russia, in other countries the Black Monday crisis seemed to create the perfect conditions for tyranny. Perhaps the United States was the hardest hit - a great power with a long and rich democratic tradition fell into civil war, proving the ills of republicanism to many.\n\nBut now, things are looking up again. A democratic Russia has triumphed against German power, but to the west, the Internationale still hopes for their world revolution. Russia, of course, stands in its way. Just because they helped crush the Teutonic hegemony does not make us friends - all forms of dictatorship, communist or Svobodnik, are the ancestral enemies of Russia. Much of the world is waking up to the same reality. Whereas the nations aligned with Russia democratically chose their path, all nations under the Internationale's thumb have had communism forced down their throats.\n\nIt is unthinkable to many: not long ago Russia's name was synonymous with despotism and Tsarist backwardness. Now it stands as the bulwark of all democratic nations, big or small, in Europe or elsewhere - and make no mistake, it will not take this role lightly.\n\nAs Vladimir Rikhter said when valiantly defending liberty against the so-called Vozhd, the Russians have been showing the light to the world, the ones guiding the world towards a better future. Through every action we take we must always remember: the great February Revolution must not be forgotten in the eyes of the world!"

 demrus.166.t: "The Dvinsk Referendum"
 demrus.166.d: "The autonomous territory of Dvinsk, a Latvian-majority area, has always been ambivalent about Moscow. Under the Savinkovist regime, it was a SZRS stronghold, led by the local dictator Frīdrihs Briedis. The slogan 'Free Latvia in Free Russia' was often used to rally against the German supremacist government in Riga; and even with the fall of Savinkov's state, the Latvians in the region still held out hope for unification with their brothers across the border.\n\nWe have made an extra step: it is now Free Latvia and Free Russia, as the Russian government, contrary to some's expectations, has allowed the Latvian people full independence. This has obviously put Dvinsk's people, who largely see themselves as Latvians, in a difficult spot. They have been itching for a referendum so that they may join their brothers in Riga. If we agree to a referendum, it is almost assured that they will join Latvia, but it will help our international image as liberators, not conquerors, and fulfil our promise of giving the Latvian people true freedom."

 demrus.166.b: "Dvinsk is Russian territory."

 demrus.167.t: "From Men of War to Men of Peace"
 demrus.167.d: "After the wars of 1914-1920, many soldiers were left with nothing. Even if they still had a home to return to, many lives were permanently scarred, as these young men knew nothing but war. Without any prospects of a normal civilian life and profession, many of them turned to revolutionary or ultranationalist movements. Wasn't the first SZRS rally in 1922 born out of this resentment, as Aleksandr Antonov, the folk hero of the Tambov Whites, rose to the podium and accused the ruling parties of ignoring the plight of the veterans, the men who had given their all yet received nothing in return?\n\nThere is a simple reason why this was so often the case - money. Some men are permanently unable to work, others lack education, or need long-term medical aid against ills like morphine addiction developed during the war from painkillers. Naturally, veterans' organisations are the first ones to lobby for this spending, and the nationalists see it as an easy way to score political points."

 demrus.168.d: "Comrades! The Revolution has triumphed in the west! Will you let the capitalist president Titov, rich from the back of the worker, order you to shoot your fellow German, French, English worker? No! Consider this: first, they were 'people's socialists', despite not being among the common people! Then, they became 'radical democrats' - but they are hardly radical, and shirk at the thought of true economic democracy.\n\nWho is this Aleksandr Andreyevich Titov, if not the chief capitalist himself? This man has his companies, he is on the board of many cooperative businesses, and despite appearing as a generous benefactor of the working man, this is mere hypocrisy. He wines and dines with the businessmen as his 'cooperative workers' pay for his mansion!"
 demrus.168.a: "All power to the Soviets!"

 demrus.169.t: "The Misery of the West"
 demrus.169.d: "The communists claim that all is well in the west, but this is not true! Many dissidents tell us of the terrible conditions there. The British are governed by uneducated Welsh coal-miners and eat only potatoes and fish, whenever the union bureaucracy's food coupons arrive on time, that is. The French can only dream of the wines they had before the revolution, when the vintners were free and profited from their 'bourgeois luxuries'. The militias rely on mob rule, hunting those who believe in God!\n\nObviously, many of these claims are entirely unsubstantiated and come from bitter émigrés and dissidents who may not even have visited their home countries after the 1920s. But they find ample listeners in Russia: nothing stokes our pride more than to see Russia as an advanced, prosperous society, compared to the materialist degeneracy of the West. Truly it will be the century of Russia, taking the mantle of the flame of civilisation from the old west."

 demrus.170.t: "Rebirth of Russian Socialism"
 demrus.170.d: "In the Znamenskaya Square in Petrograd, a mass rally was organised by the socialists - one that culminated in the founding of the All-Russian Socialist Labour Party (VSRP). The Central Committee included multiple RDP members, like Daniil Sulimov, Mikhail Yakubovich, and Viktor Khorodchinsky, who were subsequently expelled from the party.\n\nAleksandr Shlyapnikov was elected as the chairman of this party. This was taken by some in the RDP as a betrayal, as Shlyapnikov had been previously among the major labour union leaders who were supportive of us - though he is now accusing Titov's government of counter-revolutionary politics and calls for further cooperation with the Third Internationale, with an eventual transition into socialism.\n\nThe VSRP's programme includes the abolition of landlordism and private capitalism in favour of cooperative and communal enterprise, a permanent peace treaty with Paris, and devolving power to regional Dumas as much as possible. They have so far denounced violent action and intend to take part in elections - but also pressure the government through boycotts, strikes, and protests."

 demrus.171.d: "The end of the war hardly meant the end of the resistance. Quite the contrary - now that the German Empire lies in ruins and the Third Internationale has triumphed in the west, it seems like the world revolution has never been closer.\n\nOur intelligence has developed a reasonably good profile of the post-war resistance groups: they tend to be formed out of former soldiers with actual military training, often directed and funded by agents from France or Britain. These groups do not have a central organisation, but they operate in clandestine cells across Russia, often cooperating with regional separatists. They are generally laying low and simply gathering men and equipment - no doubt under directives from Paris to rise up in case of war or mass unrest.\n\nWe cannot be sure which labour organisations or parties have been infiltrated, so the intelligence officers have recommended being harsh rather than too lenient."

 demrus.172.t: "Strikes Against the War!"
 demrus.172.d: "This was irresponsible, a criminal waste! It is a crime against peace and humanity! The Internationale was always a purely peaceful association of free nations! So declare the leaders of the mass protests, calling for the Russian workers to refuse the draft and not comply with the demands of the authorities.\n\nThe Russian left has organised a series of mass strikes and protests, with some cities like Petrograd almost grinding to a halt. The most visible figures of the strikes are men like Shlyapnikov and Sulimov. The Left-SRs are also taking part in the protests, and it is feared that the mutinous mood will spread to the Petrograd garrison."
 demrus.172.a: "Outlaw strikes during the war and arrest the leaders, with bayonets if you have to."
 demrus.172.b: "Order the protests to disperse, and merely warn against further strikes."
 demrus.172.c: "Bribe the protestors with increased wages; arrest the leaders."

 demrus.173.t: "Demands from the Socialists"
 demrus.173.d: "Before the war, socialists in the State Duma supported [GetSecondInCommand]'s government not out of actual trust but at least to support the war effort of the Third Internationale. But the geopolitical reality in Europe has shifted greatly, as you are either for or against the Third Internationale. The new party of the left, Aleksandr Shlyapnikov's All-Russian Socialist Labour Party (VSRP), scored relatively well in the past elections, and ate away many of the RDP's seats as a legal, more socialist option. And now we find our current coalition relying on their support - and they, too, realise this.\n\nShlyapnikov demands social reforms, the devolution of power to regions (a stance that nets the VSRP large numbers of votes from Ukraine and Belarus), working against militarism and capitalism and pursuing peaceful, constructive relationships with the Internationale powers. Accepting their demands would look like a capitulation to the left - and a sign of weakness to both Paris and our own nationalists. But we do not have many other options, other than seeking allies from the right instead."

 demrus.174.t: "Reconnecting with the Russian Soul"
 demrus.174.d: "The semi-official newspaper 'Sentinel' was full of photographs from [RUS_HeadOfExecutive] Ivan Solonevich's travels through Turkestan. He spoke at a People's Monarchist rally in Tashkent, drawing great crowds of more curious than admiring people. Still, his down-to-earth style seemed to work with the locals. He spoke for peaceful relations between the faiths of Turkestan, meeting with leaders of the local Christian and Muslim communities.\n\nHis journey continued to the Aksu-Dzhabaglinsky Nature Reserve in the Talas Alatau mountains, where he mountain-climbed with local Kazakh-Kyrgyz guides, and was later photographed in traditional Kyrgyz garb. Later, Solonevich explained that the purpose of this visit was to find the part in his soul that was lost in the modernity of European life, something that could still be discovered from the faraway places in the world, where life remains authentic and close to nature. It remains to be seen if the [RUS_HeadOfExecutive] found this piece of his soul, but the whole stunt definitely contributed to his fame as not merely a politician, but something greater."

 demrus.175.t: "Maklakov Resigns"
 demrus.175.d: "In his resignation letter, read out to the State Council in public sessions, President Vasily Alekseyevich Maklakov elaborates on the reasons for his departure.\n\n-I am truly thankful for all the support that I have received from you, dear colleagues of the party. I have come to the conclusion that it is time for the Russian people and the party to move on without me. I have guided Russia and the party for many years to the best of my ability - however, I believe that, as a mortal man, it is finally time for my departure.\n\n-Despite the hardships along the way, I believe that together we have accomplished what many in Russia could not. It is up to the future generations of Russia to build upon those foundations we have made in these fateful years.\n\n-Rest assured, I cannot remain idle for long. Perhaps I will finally have the time that my literary and historical pursuits deserve. I will pass my torch to you now, my brothers and sisters."
 demrus.175.a: "Thank you, Vasily Alekseyevich."

 demrus.176.t: "Old Face in New Environment"
 demrus.176.d: "The new post-Great War order brought significant changes not only to Europe, but to our motherland as well. With old alliances and threats gone, a new political setup had to form. One example is the newly formed VSRP, containing all socialists who were deemed too radical for Titov's RDP. With martial law lifted, elections were called, which would shape the new political reality.\n\nTo many, the results were pretty shocking. Even if the VSRP remains a relatively small party, it still managed to get some known names into the Duma. One such name was Lev Borisovich Kamenev. His election caused an uproar across the political spectrum, with calls to remind people of his Bolshevik past. However, his tireless work with Levitsky against Savinkov, even from behind bars, calling for a united front, cannot be overshadowed. With his personality in mind, some senior RDP members jokingly spoke of him pointlessly leaving the party, and how he'd make a 'model socialist minister'. But no past, be it good or bad, can be forgotten.\n\nAmong those negative voices were some positive ones. Some deputies from the RDP and even the left-Kadets stated how Kamenev's election is living proof of Russia's healing from the Civil War. One such deputy stated how the old Red-White divide is long overdue, as the Civil War criminals are either imprisoned or dead already, and expressed a need for unity towards a new future."

 ### Monarchy Events
 monrus.1.t: "Election of the Imperial Regent"
 monrus.1.d: "As the official coronation has yet to take place, the Constitution defines that, without a reigning monarch, a regent will be appointed to govern the state.\n\nWith his prestige and role in both restoring democracy and the monarchy, Baron Wrangel was the natural choice to hold the title. His time as head of state will naturally be short."
 monrus.1.a: "Alright."

 monrus.2.t: "The Coronation"
 monrus.2.d.kirill: "Today marks the day Kirill Kirillovich Romanov, grandson of Emperor Aleksandr II the Liberator, ascends to the throne of the Russian Empire.\n\nIt is rather fitting for Kirill to be in this position; while he was in Petrograd in 1917, he worked with moderates to ensure the establishment of a constitutional monarchy. In the 1921 Constituent Assembly, his attempt to establish just that had just fallen short - he remained away from politics for some time, though donating to monarchist and conservative causes.\n\nFor a Romanov, he is rather liberal, lacking any autocratic tendencies, but remains a stern figure, one who seeks moderate solutions and will not tolerate the rise of either the far-right or far-left."
 monrus.2.d.vladimir: "Today marks the day Vladimir Kirillovich Romanov, great-grandson of Emperor Aleksandr II the Liberator, ascends to the throne of the Russian Empire.\n\nIf Kirill Aleksandrovich was a more stern, fatherly and regnal figure, more of your traditional Russian Emperor, Vladimir Kirillovich is quite different. Only in his early twenties, Vladimir is easily younger than any of his ministers or generals, yet towers over them in prestige. While one must admit that Vladimir is not particularly charismatic, he does have 'the charm of a farmer boy', and is modest and insightful. He is very much a child of the republic, having been born in that fateful year of 1917, and has lived through the ups and downs of the republic - culminating in seeing first-hand the terror unleashed by Savinkov's regime.\n\nVladimir has served in the army, is fluent in five languages, and has studied law, business, and agriculture. He was very much raised as the last hope for the Russian monarchy, raised to excel at the Emperor's duties - and a great many depend on him, as dark clouds are gathering over Russia's future."
 monrus.2.a: "Long may he reign!"

 monrus.5.t: "The Death of Kirill"
 monrus.5.d.mon: "Emperor Kirill's health deteriorated drastically this year due to his arteriosclerosis - a consequence of wounds he received in the battle of Port Arthur in 1904. Days ago, he suffered the worst heart attack of his life to date and was hurried into the Moscow Main Military Hospital. He did not recover and died today.\n\nA great many people gathered in churches to mourn Kirill, and a great state funeral is expected to be arranged. Despite the grief, many eyes are now turned towards the only 21-year-old Emperor Vladimir III, who is to be coronated soon.\n\nIf Kirill Aleksandrovich was a more stern, fatherly and regnal figure, more of your traditional Russian Emperor, Vladimir Kirillovich is quite different.

 monrus.6.t: "Union for the Revival of the Republic"
 monrus.6.d: "The founding congress of the Union for the Revival of the Republic (SVR) in Moscow drew thousands of people, both from the urban working class of Moscow but also a significant number of the peasantry from around the capital, rallied by the SR field organisation. In this nigh-revolutionary crowd, thousands of people became the starting members of the Union for the Revival of the Republic, united around a single goal: forcing the monarch to abdicate and restore the republic, willingly or unwillingly.\n\nThe narrative given by these radical republicans paints the monarchy as a Wrangelite military coup, where the army forced the Constituent Assembly to establish a monarchy at gunpoint. Thus, even if the monarchy seems constitutional and democratic, it will not stay that way: in fact, it is merely the first step towards a return to the old Imperial tyranny. Even rumours of giving the land back to the aristocrats have been circulating in the socialist press.\n\nMany of the most visible members of the SVR were left-wing politicians or members of the 'Rikhter Faction' of the Socialist-Revolutionary Party, composed of those Esers who had entirely refused to cooperate with the monarchy. Nikolay Zdobnov, a charismatic Left-SR, was elected as chairman of the union, defeating Vladimir Rikhter with the votes of the socialists. In the first congress of the SVR, a rather simple programme was adopted, which the Party of Left-Socialist-Revolutionaries, Radical-Democratic Party, sections of the Socialist-Revolutionary Party and a number of minor leftist parties co-signed, calling for a struggle against the monarchy."
 monrus.6.a: "Curses!"

 monrus.7.t: "The Unions Mobilise"
 monrus.7.d: "Major strikes have been called by the VTsSPS-aligned unions, and later joined by even more moderate and SR-aligned labour unions. Their spokesmen cite the 'monarchist coup' as the reason for this popular mobilisation, and they declare their full support for the SVR goal of having [RUS.GetLeader] abdicate and his government resign.\n\nThis blatantly political wave of strikes has grown in some cities, such as Petrograd and Rostov, to such a degree that local law enforcement has reported problems in maintaining order."
 monrus.7.a: "Mobilise more police."
 monrus.7.b: "Negotiate with the unions."
 monrus.7.c: "Whatever."

 monrus.8.t: "Peasant Marches"
 monrus.8.d: "Reminiscent of the SZRS mobilisation of rural people, many regional SR organisations have arranged 'peasant marches' against the SR government and the monarchy. These rallies often include the gathering of hundreds of farmers in local centres, barricading police stations and government offices and making demands similar to those the SVR has put forth.\n\nIn charge of all of them is Vladimir Rikhter and his faction of SRs, who have rapidly descended into a civil war with Fondaminsky's faction."
 monrus.8.a: "Send more police in and arrest the agitators."
 monrus.8.b: "Appeal to the peasants."
 monrus.8.c: "They can't do much."

 monrus.9.t: "Negotiations with the Labour Unions"
 monrus.9.d: "Chairman-Minister [GetSecondInCommand] has reached a preliminary agreement with the committee of striking unions, with Rafail Abramovich as their main negotiator. It does seem that the socialists are requiring concrete actions to reinforce Russian democracy, such as thorough judicial reform to reduce the police's powers to arrest strikers and protestors, and the strengthening of Gubernial Dumas at the expense of the Kremlin. In addition, they are demanding a new labour rights act penned by the RDP to be passed. In exchange, the left will use its political clout to support our government's efforts for now.\n\nWhile these demands are not terrible - many even desirable - accepting this kind of pressure would make us look weak, and the right will be especially quick to paint us as such."
 monrus.9.a: "We have the same goals!"
 monrus.9.b: "We will not be threatened."

 monrus.10.t: "Winning the Hearts and Souls"
 monrus.10.d: "It is no secret that the monarchy has plenty of opponents in Russia, particularly among the urban poor. While the so-called 'Second Empire' is obviously not the same as the first, we may need to implement some major programmes to win over the people.\n\nThe simplest way to win over the workers would be economic prosperity; after all, discontent comes from poverty and lack of work. An ambitious enough work-creation programme would no doubt give us plenty of credit among the workers, and in the best case, inoculate them against socialist agitation.\n\nHowever, pure economic growth may not be a long-term solution. We could also push through a package that includes improved working conditions, minimum wage, and other benefits for the working class. This would not be liked by our funders, nor would it be as beneficial economically, but it would be the best way to win them over."
 monrus.10.a: "Just focus on economic growth."
 monrus.10.b: "Start labour reform."
 monrus.10.c: "We can do both."

 monrus.11.t: "Resurgent Combat Organisation"
 monrus.11.d: "An assassination rocked the country, as the Head of Voronezh Police, Fyodor Dmitriyevich Nazarov, died while coming home from an opera. The murderer managed to flee the scene but left a message to the Voronezh police: 'Death to the Tsarist dogs'.\n\nActive State Councillor Nazarov had been the first Chief of Police appointed by [RUS.GetLeader] and was not a particularly liked man in the region. He was known as the epitome of a harsh Cossack leader, whose police career was marked by brutal efficiency. But none of these traits are unique to Russian law enforcement; it seems likely that he was specifically killed as a protest against the monarchy.\n\nA massive manhunt was quickly launched to destroy this new 'Combat Organisation', which gives many eerie flashbacks of the Svobodnik death squads of the early 1930s targeting socialists and liberals. It is likely that the murderers may be former Svobodniks, though some socialist group, like Socialist-Revolutionary-Maximalists, is another likely guess."
 monrus.11.a: "Focus efforts on ex-Svobodniks."
 monrus.11.b: "Focus efforts on socialist radicals."
 monrus.11.c: "Leave no stone unturned!"

 monrus.12.t: "Protests Reach Their Peak"
 monrus.12.d: "SVR-aligned strikes and peasant marches have continued, and in the largest cities, there has been an even larger escalation in the form of illegal mass gatherings. The police have been breaking these up when possible, and in Petrograd in particular, the protests have been so widespread that the police have begun to use force and even call for help from the military police.\n\nIn private, [RUS.GetLeader] has considered abdication but was advised to remain. General-Fieldmarshal Wrangel assured that the protests are largely the creation of a small group of agitators and are mostly based on empty fear and not any actual understanding of the modern Russian monarchy.\n\nNonetheless, something must be done. State Council member Vasily Shulgin has proposed that the government enact a temporary decree to empower the cabinet and give them the necessary tools to maintain order, but this kind of act would seem very dictatorial, if also effective. We could also answer some of the demands of the protestors, promising to strengthen their political rights and quality of life."
 monrus.12.a: "Give them some concessions."
 monrus.12.b: "No step back! Take control by any means necessary."

 monrus.13.t: "Operation Against SVR"
 monrus.13.d: "After much lobbying by the government, the Supreme Court has declared support for the view that the Union for the Revival of the Republic (SVR) can be classified as a 'communist-aligned' organisation and has been shut down by the court. They cite the presence of communists such as Sergey Medvedev and Aleksandr Shlyapnikov holding high positions in the SVR, and the SVR's inability or unwillingness to expel these people.\n\nA series of coordinated raids were conducted by the police, which led to the confiscation of the SVR membership records, printing presses, and funds. Much of the leadership was arrested, though no real charges could be made against many of them. An attempt to prosecute their leadership for 'conspiracy to overthrow the constitution' only passed through the courts in cases where actual communist connections were found, which meant that a majority of the SVR leaders could walk free.\n\nStill, the destruction of the SVR as an organisation and the arrest of its most left-wing members should give us breathing room, even if the republican opposition is likely even more bitter now."
 monrus.13.a: "Finally."

 monrus.14.t: "Imperial Decree on Protection of the People and the State"
 monrus.14.d: "Chairman-Minister [GetSecondInCommand]'s Imperial cabinet saw only one path of action to create a stable government with an uncooperative Duma. As advised by the Minister of War, Baron Wrangel, a decree has been devised that stretches the powers of the government to their widest extent, freezing the Duma's ability to initiate a vote of no confidence and greatly empowering the executive branch for the duration of a single year. Emperor [RUS.GetLeader]'s co-signature finally passed the decree into action.\n\nThe Protection Decree was lauded as a dictatorial measure by many, but with its powers, dissent could be censored. [GetSecondInCommand] explained in his speech to the State Council, broadcasted on radio to all of Russia, that the motherland was facing a period of great instability and turmoil, and much work was required to undo everything that Svobodniks had destroyed in their time in power. Thus, all Russian citizens are expected to obey authorities and be supportive towards the government's policies to build a new, better Russia."
 monrus.14.a: "A small price to pay."

 monrus.15.t: "Imperial Cabinet Falls"
 monrus.15.d: "The cabinet of Chairman-Minister [GetSecondInCommand] collapsed in a vote of no confidence today. As it was clear that he held no majority support in the State Duma, [GetSecondInCommand] gave the Emperor his resignation.\n\nNegotiations for the formation of the next government began immediately."
 monrus.15.a: "Imagine the chaos if we had no Emperor."
 monrus.15.b: "Curses..."
 monrus.15.c: "Unfortunate."

 monrus.16.t: "Socialist-Revolutionary Brothers' War"
 monrus.16.d.rikhter: "The yearly conference of the Socialist-Revolutionary Party was a time bomb. It was clear that a massive rift had grown inside the party between Vladimir Rikhter's radical republican faction and Ilya Fondaminsky's pragmatics. The city of Vladimir, where the conference was held, was a warzone between the two Eser factions trying to denounce each other.\n\nUltimately, the Rikhterites prevailed. They had more votes, and their virulent campaign against the 'Tsarist traitors' bore fruit. Latching onto every 'failure towards the people' that Fondaminsky's cabinet had been guilty of or not, the party majority turned against Fondaminsky. Nikolay Martyanov's speech summed it all up: even if you are willing to abandon the idea of the republic, you should at least understand that a lukewarm compromise programme will only alienate the loyal SR voters as a blind repeat of the early 1930s, which led to peasants rallying behind SZRS. The implication is clear - if the SRs don't stand for their ideals, who will?\n\nIn a dramatic revolt, the party majority voted to withdraw from the government and expel all SR members who did not abide by the decision. Martyanov was elected as the new chairman. The question remains: will Fondaminsky himself abide by this decision and offer the Emperor his resignation, or is there hope in leading a centre-right government?"
 monrus.16.d.fondaminsky: "The yearly conference of the Socialist-Revolutionary Party was a time bomb. It was clear that a massive rift had grown inside the party between Vladimir Rikhter's radical republican faction and Ilya Fondaminsky's pragmatics. The city of Vladimir, where the conference was held, was a warzone between the two Eser factions trying to denounce each other.\n\nUltimately, the Rikhterites did not prevail. They latched onto every 'failure towards the people' that Fondaminsky's cabinet had been guilty of or not, but ultimately it was without merit. Fondaminsky's defenders correctly pointed out how his cabinet had done as well as was possible after the monarchist coup, and that with his path, the monarchy would be restricted and Russian liberties ensured. Another argument that won ground was the possibility of other parties gaining power - if not an SR government, then what? Surely no one wants a right-wing government by the likes of Solonevich or Shulgin? Those who dream of 'another February Revolution' should wake up, Nikolay Zenzinov declared, because the situation is vastly different: a revolution would either be hijacked by the left or shot down by Wrangel's men.\n\nAt the end of the day, Fondaminsky prevailed. Rikhter announced his departure from party politics soon after, citing a desire to focus on his career in poetry and writing instead. Much of the party lined up behind Fondaminsky, ensuring a support base for his government in the foreseeable future."
 monrus.16.a: "Not our proudest day."

 monrus.17.t: "Expansion of Anti-Communist Laws"
 monrus.17.d: "Upon notice of the latent unrest and agitation by 'radical republicans', Anti-Radical laws have been expanded. In addition to communistic and Svobodnist agitation, they now include 'any agitation for the overthrow of the Constitution of the Russian Empire' - which essentially makes republicanism illegal.\n\nAs expected, these laws generated a great burst of protests, but armed with new legal backing, the state's monopoly on violence could strike back hard. Thousands of people were arrested using one new clause, and tried for 'conspiracy against the Constitution of the Russian Empire'. In subsequent repressions, many anti-monarchist publications were banned and organisations abolished as illegal."
 monrus.17.a: "They wanted war."

 monrus.18.t: "Restoration of Labour Camps?"
 monrus.18.d: "After the mass police campaign against the republicans, the Russian legal system is straining under its weight. It has quickly dawned on us that a mass suppression of this scale needs an expanded prison system... which does bring very depressing memories of Tsarist and Savinkovist oppression.\n\nIt is possible to reopen some of the Savinkov-era camps to house prisoners in them, but it would be best to rebrand them into something else, such as penal labour colonies."
 monrus.18.a: "Well, what else can we do?"
 monrus.18.b: "Absolutely not!"

 monrus.19.t: "The Patriotic Information Office"
 monrus.19.d: "As a private project, a number of right-wing businessmen have funded the so-called Patriotic Information Office, with Ivan Aleksandrovich Ilyin chosen as its head. Immediately, the office started to publish papers, leaflets, and even radio broadcasts featuring Russian conservative writers. Ilyin himself explained that the goal of the office is to counter the agitation and lies that are being spread about the Emperor and the intents of the Imperial government.\n\nIn a widely circulated leaflet, Ilyin debunks multiple claims commonly made about the monarchists, such as that they would be seeking the restoration of landed nobility and that they seek to abolish democracy. Quite the contrary, Ilyin persuasively argues in eloquent language; in his pamphlets, he has argued for various benefits of the monarchy, including the often-repeated claim that if Russia had been a monarchy in 1934, Savinkov could not have risen to power.\n\nIn later publications by Ilyin, the idea of the coming war has also been raised. There are stories of terrible oppression of the Ukrainians at the hands of German occupiers, and of the total destruction of humanity in the totalitarian abysses of France and Britain. While Savinkov wanted war for his own glory, [GetSecondInCommand]'s cabinet and Baron Pyotr Wrangel do not want war; they merely recognise it as an inevitable fact and see it as their duty to prepare, as all Russian people should."
 monrus.19.a: "Honestly, give this man his own ministry."
 monrus.19.b: "True words, Ivan Aleksandrovich!"
 monrus.19.c: "Perhaps tone it down a bit."

 monrus.20.t: "The Garde Equipage"
 monrus.20.d: "Grand Prince Kirill's most legendary deed was in 1917, when he took his Marine Guard - wearing red armbands of the revolution - to the Taurida Palace to swear allegiance to the Provisional Government of Prince Lvov, and authorised the raising of the red flags over his palace. This is the moment that has often been referenced in Imperial propaganda as proof that Kirill shares the legacy of the February Revolution, just as the SRs or the Kadets do.\n\nTo commemorate the event, the Imperial court has asked Admiral [RUS_GetNavyChief] to transfer an elite unit of his Marine Infantry to be used to restore Tsar Kirill's Marine Guard - a tradition stemming from his naval service at the time. The Tsar wishes for a full brigade-sized unit under his control, to serve both as a ceremonial and an actual guard force.\n\nThis has raised some eyebrows, as transferring the protection of the Imperial family from state security forces to those under Tsar-appointed officers would give the Tsar a private army, albeit a small one. However, it is still just a brigade - it is not like it can pose a threat. It also reminds many of Savinkov's use of special uniformed units as a tool of propaganda - though it may be good to give people new military symbols in place of those Savinkov utilised."
 monrus.20.a: "Yes, the Garde Equipage will be restored!"
 monrus.20.b: "Grant him a much smaller token guard."
 monrus.20.c: "What is this, the 19th century?"

 monrus.21.t: "General Denikin Causes a Scandal"
 monrus.21.d: "The old Peasant Marshal caused a slight political scandal as he was caught in the middle of a drunken rant at an Officers' Ball hosted to celebrate Emperor Vladimir's birthday. Anton Denikin loudly complained about ' eunuch aristocrats currying for the favour of a foppish tsarevich from fashion magazines' and 'that German baron is orchestrating it all from the shadows', claiming that proponents of monarchy should be put to till the land for a couple of years, so that they might learn how real life works.\n\nDenikin is known for these outbursts, but this one ended up causing so much outrage on the right that many are wondering if the old General-Fieldmarshal is 'mentally fit' for his tasks anymore. It is also well-known that Denikin has always supported the Kadet party, and these insults are implicitly directed at a party that ended up supporting monarchical restoration. As damage control, the media has been told that Denikin had simply had far too much vodka that night and that these should not be taken as his serious political views."
 monrus.21.a: "He may be a grumpy old man, but he once saved Russia, after all."
 monrus.21.b: "Use this as grounds to move him into an honoured retirement."

 monrus.22.t: "The Price of Bread"
 monrus.22.d: "The poor rural folk of Ivanovo have petitioned the Tsar to lower the prices of bread. Many people there, having lost jobs or customers, are now barely making ends meet, and have revived the age-old custom of direct appeal to the Tsar. The letter is polite and humble, beginning with prayers for the Imperial family's health, and would be more in place in the past century.\n\nSensing a chance for positive visibility, [RUS.GetLeader] brought the matter up with the Chairman-Minister and the Minister of Finance, demanding to know what actions the government is taking to ease the plight of the common folk. He also suggested the government specifically focus on making basic foodstuffs cheaper.\n\nJust before the Minister of Economy was about to start with 'But Your Imperial Majesty, we simply cannot-' he was cut short. Chairman-Minister [GetSecondInCommand] understood the implications here. Regardless of whether the Tsar was thinking of his own popularity or was genuinely sympathetic to the plight of the people, hungry people are what breed revolutions. Government price caps on grain would not be popular everywhere, but they would help the poorest people of Russia."
 monrus.22.a: "His Imperial Majesty will ensure cheap bread!"
 monrus.22.b: "His Imperial Government will ensure cheap bread!"
 monrus.22.c: "This kind of market meddling is self-defeating."

 monrus.23.t: "The Threat of Bolshevism!"
 monrus.23.d: "Tsar Vladimir caused a minor political crisis after openly commenting on politics in his New Year's speech. While talking about the memory of the civil war, he alluded that 'some in our country still wish to see Bolshevism return', a thinly-veiled reference to the RDP and other socialists who never really accepted the restoration of the monarchy. Constitutionally, the government is obviously not responsible to the Tsar but only to the Russian people, so a Tsar criticising his own government is understandably troublesome.\n\nThis has caused many Duma delegates to protest against the government for allowing the head of state to 'debase the democratic system' with such comments. After all, the RDP is a legal party, and it is not the Tsar's place to criticise that. Vladimir is not a man to listen to these debates for too long, and made the situation even worse by clarifying that he, indeed, did mean that some members of the Duma may have questionable loyalty to Russia."
 monrus.23.a: "Privately tell His Imperial Majesty to shut up."
 monrus.23.b: "He is right, though."

 monrus.24.t: "The Doctrine of the Tsar-Redeemer"
 monrus.24.d: "Since the 1920s, calls have been made to canonise Tsar Nikolay II and his murdered family as Holy Martyrs. It was the cardinal sin of the entire Russian people to turn on their Tsar and slay him, some have argued, and demanded amends be made by all of Russia. All this has given strength to the 'Movement of the Tsar-Redeemer' - or 'Heresy of the Imperial Redemption' as it is called by its critics, which seeks to put the late Tsar into a wholly sacred position, even capable of redeeming sins.\n\nA commonly cited proof for this is the writings of the 18th-century monk Abel, who has been claimed to have prophesied many important events in Russian history correctly.\n\nOf Nikolay II he prophesied: 'He will have the mind of Christ, long-suffering and pigeon purity... He will replace the royal crown with a crown of thorns... There will be war. A great war, a world war... Through the air, people, like birds, will fly, under water, like fish, they will swim, and they will begin to exterminate each other with fetid grey. On the eve of victory, the royal throne will collapse. Brother will rise against brother... the godless power will scour the Russian land...'\n\nThis idea of Nikolay II as an almost Messiah-like figure, a sacrifice for Russia's many sins, has risen again and seems ever more attractive to the faithful, seeking some meaning to the civil war.\n\nLess fervent proponents of the movement are merely calling for sainthood and the building of a new church in Yekaterinburg, where the Tsar and his family died, to become a site of pilgrimage for all Russian faithful."
 monrus.24.a: "Support the canonisation of the Imperial Family."
 monrus.24.b: "The Bolsheviks murdered so many; why would one man matter?"

 monrus.25.t: "Chairman of the High Imperial Council"
 monrus.25.d: "The High Imperial Council is an official government body under the supervision of the State Council and Duma, serving as chief advisors to the Emperor. While the intent is naturally to provide the Emperor with neutral expert knowledge, in practice having a position as the Emperor's advisor allows one to have great influence over policy. Even if the Emperor does not make any laws, he will still have great moral authority over Russian politics.\n\nThe chairman of this council serves as the chief advisor, who will have access to the Emperor and is expected to keep the Emperor informed of all matters of importance - making the position both prestigious and important for political schemes."
 monrus.25.a: "Dmitry Romanov"
 monrus.25.b: "Aleksandr Golitsyn"
 monrus.25.c: "Georgy Vernadsky"
 monrus.25.e: "Ivan Ilyin"
 monrus.25.f: "Ivan Solonevich"
 monrus.25.g: "Anton Kartashyov"

 monrus.26.t: "The Shadow Agency"
 monrus.26.d: "The past months have seen the drastic growth of the Fifth Department of the General Chief of Staff of the War Ministry, the army's intelligence agency, under the leadership of Pavel Shatilov, Wrangel's second-hand man. As the Okhrana was vastly downsized after the fall of Savinkov, it seems that Shatilov's agency recruited many of the former agents into their own service and inherited many of their networks. Officially, the Fifth Department is responsible to the War Ministry - but in practice, this only makes it the Black Baron's personal intelligence service.\n\nUnlike Kornilov or Denikin, who had the finesse of a bear, Wrangel is carved from a different wood. He has refrained from conflict with the government but has steadily made himself the most well-informed man in Russia through the Fifth Department and a confidential relationship with the Emperor. The Fifth Department is nominally only focused on military intelligence, but in practice, the organisation is becoming a 'Shadow Okhrana' - another secret police, but in control of the army."
 monrus.26.a: "The Okhrana must receive more funds!"
 monrus.26.b: "Excellent, we can trust the Black Baron's judgement."

 monrus.27.t: "Enshrining Family Values in the Law"
 monrus.27.d: "The laws of the Russian Democratic Federative Republic were socially progressive - or one could say, morally apathethic, better fit to the nighlife of Paris than to the Russian village. They failed to criminalise a number of morally dubious practices, like homosexuality, contraception, and easy divorces, and additionally weakened the family as a basic unit of society by instead focusing on individualism.\n\nThe new law that has come on the desk of [RUS.GetLeader] would rewrite these laws so they conform to more moral and Christian values, banning degenerate behaviour and putting the family in the place where it belongs, at the forefront of society. Additionally, they would include natalist practices, such as progressively greater tax benefits to families with a large number of children. The law has been strongly lobbied for by the Church especially, calling it a step back in the right direction."
 monrus.27.a: "Sign it."
 monrus.27.b: "Drop it."

 monrus.28.t: "The Day of Restoration"
 monrus.28.d.normal: "Today is another Day of Restoration, celebrating the birth of the Restored Empire and the coronation of the Tsar after twenty years of a vacant throne. The day has become increasingly propagandistic, with a great military parade cutting through Moscow in the bright colours of the Volunteer Army units. Emperor [RUS.GetLeader] is greeting them in the uniform of the Naval Infantry, young and dashing, and almost always one can see General-Fieldmarshal Wrangel on the Tsar's side in widely publicised events.\n\nChurch bells are ringing, and sermons are being dedicated to the Romanovs returning in Russia's darkest hour. The day is full of mysticism, and every aspect holy or mysterious of the Imperial dynasty is shown. Events are arranged in all parts of Russia, and the evening culminates with the Imperial Ball in Petrograd, where the most accomplished citizens of the empire are invited to personally meet the Emperor."
 monrus.28.d.solonevich: "[GetDateStringNoHourLong] is another Day of Restoration, celebrating the birth of the Second Empire and the coronation of the Tsar after twenty years of a vacant throne. The day has become increasingly propagandistic, with a great military parade cutting through Moscow in the bright colours of the Volunteer Army units. Emperor [RUS.GetLeader] is greeting them in the uniform of the Naval Infantry, young and dashing, and almost always one can see Chairman-Minister Ivan Solonevich on the Tsar's side in widely publicised events.\n\nChurch bells are ringing, and sermons are being dedicated to the Romanovs returning in Russia's darkest hour. The day is full of mysticism, and every aspect holy or mysterious of the Imperial dynasty is shown. Events are arranged in all parts of Russia, and the evening culminates with the Imperial Ball in Petrograd, where the most accomplished citizens of the empire are invited to personally meet the Emperor.\n\nTruly, if not for [RUS.GetLeader] and [GetSecondInCommand], Russia would be shackled and enslaved, left to the whims of a terrorist. But God has saved Mother Russia through the person of the Emperor, Tsar-Father of all the nation."
 monrus.28.a: "Long live [RUS.GetLeader]."

 monrus.29.t: "Orthodoxy, Constitution, People"
 monrus.29.d: "The first tenet of New Russian Monarchy is, as always, Orthodoxy - as the Tsar is the Defender of the Faith and the Anointed One, the God-appointed protector of all Russian people. Faith and the Tsar share one purpose, that of the protection of Russian values and peace.\n\nThe second tenet, instead of failed Autocracy, is the Constitution. The values of the February Revolution were already accepted by Grand Prince Kirill - democracy, parliamentarism, and constitutionalism. The Tsar is blessed by God but he governs with the consent of the Russian people, acting also as the protector of Russian democracy.\n\nThe third tenet is Nationality, or Narodism. Russia's strength flows from its peasants, and the ancient Russian culture is what keeps the nation's various ethnic groups together. The shared folk-culture of peasant Russia, briefly tainted by Savinkov, must also serve as the basis for the monarchy."
 monrus.29.a: "Long live the Emperor!"

 monrus.30.t: "Black Baron Meets White Russian"
 monrus.30.d: "It is no secret that Pyotr Wrangel has not been an admirer of Chairman-Minister Ivan Solonevich. Wrangel is a man of the old school, and arguably not even as hostile to democracy as Solonevich has turned out to be. But after all the recent events - mass rallies by Stabs-Captains, mass arrests against the opposition, centralisation of power around Solonevich - the situation has started to be eerily similar to 1935, but instead of Savinkov, you have Solonevich, and instead of Kornilov, you have Wrangel.\n\nTo avoid a final clash, Wrangel met with Solonevich in private and discussed the situation for hours. While Wrangel has called the minister an 'egoistic Belarusian potato farmer' in private, he always remains cordial in negotiations such as these. Pyotr Nikolayevich was direct: he took action when Savinkov had proved to be a liability to the Russian nation, and he would do it again if Solonevich repeated those mistakes. However, Wrangel admitted he was not hostile to Solonevich's designs - only extremely sceptical of them, and viewed them as a sideshow potentially weakening Russia when everything should be done to prepare for war.\n\nLikewise, Solonevich saw the war with Germany as a worthy fight, but insisted that only a socially remade Russia could withstand the storm. It was clear that he was not happy to hear threats from his Minister of War, but for now, nothing could be done. Ultimately, the choice in priority was Solonevich's, but clearly the army did not like delays."
 monrus.30.a: "Two great egos..."

 monrus.31.t: "Duma of Industry and Labour"
 monrus.31.d: "The State Economic Committee (Goseko) in its inception served as an expert body representing business interests of the state, regularly in contact with the VSTPF (All-Russian Union of Commerce, Industry and Finance), which provided the views of prominent industrialists. To Ivan Solonevich, these interest groups and constant economic negotiation are inherently harmful to the national economy.\n\nVia Imperial decree, Goseko has been abolished, and its duties are now held by the Council of Industry and Labour, an 80-seat body with emperor-appointed representatives from the industrialists, economic experts from the Academy of Sciences, and representatives of the workers' organisations. This 'organic' body is meant to serve as an advisory and regulatory body, identifying trends in the national economy and recommending solutions to the Imperial government. Additionally, labour contract negotiations will be conducted in this council. All state companies have been subjected to control of the Council of Industry and Labour, with the intent of expanding the scope of the command economy through it.\n\nAs expected, labour activists are furious, and admittedly the new council is not terribly satisfying to many industrialists either, who see it as a government attempt to control economic life. However, many see it as Solonevich staying true to his promises: curtailing capitalism by implementing a more organic and representative economic system."
 monrus.31.a: "One step closer towards People's Monarchy."

 monrus.32.t: "The Conservative Faction Rises"
 monrus.32.d: "Many conservatives believed that ultimately Ivan Solonevich's more erratic policies could be tolerated for the greater cause of empowering Imperial power and removing socialists from the public eye. This has happened, yes, but it seems like Solonevich does not plan to slow down. Rather, he seems determined to keep going, especially with his policies to control the private banking sector and regulate stock markets, demanding the state be able to forcefully buy shares of any large enough Russian company. These 'statist' policies have been accused of being 'Neo-Savinkovist', and a new opposition faction in the Duma of Industry and Labour has grown to oppose Solonevich.\n\nThe lead figure of this bloc is an old and respected economist and statesman, Aleksandr Konovalov. Konovalov and other 'conservatives' - as in, people who wish to preserve Russia's free markets - argue that Solonevich has a lacklustre understanding of economics and that the government is not actually listening to its financial backers or experts, even if the Duma of Industry was made specifically for this purpose. The group seems well-geared to actually threaten Solonevich's rule through their influence over conservative politics and media of Russia."
 monrus.32.a: "When Adam delved and Eve span, where was the banker?"
 monrus.32.b: "I am sure we can cut a mutually beneficial deal."

 monrus.33.t: "A New Russian Empire Rises"
 monrus.33.d: "Moscow is buzzing. Great masses of people are chanting for the Emperor on the Red Square, guided by men in uniforms of the Stabs-Captains. Great columns of Drozdovite soldiers in their parade uniforms are saluting the Emperor and his Chairman-Minister as they appear in front of the great crowd. Emperor Vladimir seems almost like a side character next to Ivan Solonevich's physical presence and charisma.\n\nThe purpose of the rally is clear: to intimidate those who oppose Solonevich, to legitimise his controversial political reforms that are just now being debated in the State Duma.\n\nIn Solonevich's words, his reforms would restore the Russian Empire to its former glory: where power and justice are back where they belong, in the hands of the people rather than lawyers and bankers. What did the republic ever deliver to the Russian people? Anarchy, chaos, and ultimately godless tyranny! Instead of endless Duma debates, it will be the Emperor and his cabinet who will act, without their hands tied. Instead of tolerating greedy and corrupt bureaucrats, they will be purged by the righteous. No Savinkov nor Lenin, but the Emperor of All Russias!\n\nSolonevich's opposition in the Duma naturally does not agree. Some even compare the situation to 1935, where a diminishing group of democrats are fighting a long defeat. Surely Solonevich's regime does not pose a similarly mortal threat - but it is obvious that he has no interest in maintaining parliamentary democracy."

 monrus.34.t: "Referendum on the Russian Future"
 monrus.34.d: "Chairman-Minister Solonevich has continued battering the Russian constitutional system with all his might. As the People's Monarchists and their loyalists have captured most positions of influence in society, voices of their opponents are increasingly being silenced. The two men who could stand up to him do nothing: Vladimir seems a perfectly willing accomplice to Solonevich's power-grab, while General-Fieldmarshal Wrangel has given his silent acceptance to Solonevich's designs, as long as the army is left alone.\n\nNow in the crescendo of the monarchist war against democracy, the final blow has come in the form of a direct referendum with a simple question to the Russian people: do you approve the Duma Reform of Emperor Vladimir III? And as the government media has been repeating over and over again, the Duma Reform is designed to fix all the issues of the earlier Russian democratic system that have existed since 1922, that enabled demagogues and corrupt elites to manipulate politics at the expense of the common people. In practice, the reform takes away much of the Duma's powers over the Imperial cabinet, relegating it to a largely advisory role merely legitimising laws proposed by the latter."

 monrus.35.t: "Rising Discontent"
 monrus.35.d: "Chairman-Minister [GetSecondInCommand]'s cabinet is increasingly coming under fire from the public. While the political opposition is there to always ridicule the government, now there have been some murmurs even among the ruling coalition's ranks, with varying doubts over the actions of [GetSecondInCommand]'s government. Just last week, two Duma members defected from our coalition party to the opposition, no doubt already eyeing the next elections.\n\nWe are treading in precarious waters. The Emperor advised the cabinet to be very careful in our next moves, or he will be forced to appoint new one which is able to both govern and has majority backing in the State Duma."
 monrus.35.a: "Nonsense, my cabinet is doing a fine job."

 monrus.36.t: "The Class Council Experiment"
 monrus.36.d: "There is a curious political concept in Ukraine called Classocracy, based on the writings of Viacheslav Lypynskyi and championed by the USKhD (Ukrainian Union of Agrarians-Statists). Lypynskyi's theory attempts to reconcile social problems without socialism in a framework of conservative thought. Ivan Solonevich has for long been fascinated by this Ukrainian project, and even proposed a class council experiment in the Duma in 1934, but Savinkov's government was not interested.\n\nWhat would such an experiment look like? In practice, local matters would be handled by a class council - a body elected from workers and landowners of the region in harmony. A more extensive version of the concept includes a corporatist Duma, but for now the experiment should only happen on the level of gubernias, with Ueyzd class councils and Gubernial class councils. For the purposes of the experiment, this system would be enacted in some specific region, for example the Voronezh Gubernia, and it would be observed before a potential nation-wide adaptation."
 monrus.36.a: "Let us try it!"
 monrus.36.b: "Interesting, but not a priority."

 monrus.37.t: "The Emperor in History"
 monrus.37.d.start: "The Emperor of All the Russias, Vladimir III, has a reputation as a humble and well-educated man, without much imperial opulence to show off. This is advised to maintain public opinion towards the Emperor, but truth be told, Vladimir himself is not used to the kind of luxuries that the First Empire is remembered for."
 monrus.37.d.lib: "$monrus.37.d.start$\n\nTo everyone's surprise, the young Emperor is relatively liked. Yes, some dislike his indecisiveness and reliance on his advisors and government - but then again, some would argue that is the mark of a modern monarchy who trusts in expertise and democracy, rather than a mark of weakness. Some say he is a liberal, but the Emperor has been tight-lipped about his personal political views. Still, he has supported various progressive causes, and most importantly, progressive cabinets. It is hard to hate him.\n\nThe monarchy did not turn out to be a repetition of the Romanov tyranny, as the nay-sayers claimed, but rather just a perfectly uninteresting constitutional monarchy, dignified in tradition but respectful of democracy. Perhaps the Kirillovite dynasty is truly a new page in Russian history."
 monrus.37.d.con: "$monrus.37.d.start$\n\nTo everyone's surprise, the young Emperor is relatively liked. Yes, some dislike his indecisiveness and reliance on his advisors and government - but then again, some would argue that is the mark of a modern monarchy who trusts in expertise and democracy, rather than a mark of weakness. He has drawn more criticism for his support of conservative politics, as his passivity in politics makes him a mere figurehead of a right-wing government. Sure, it is an elected government, but some had hoped that Vladimir, a man from a relatively liberal background, would have used his influence to curb the excesses of his government. Or perhaps he is doing exactly that, and republican conservative rule would be worse?\n\nThe monarchy did not turn out to be a repetition of the Romanov tyranny, as the nay-sayers claimed, but rather a new Germany: a constitutional monarchy with an undeniable conservative bent. In any case, Vladimir is idolised as the man who restored Russia to its glory, the national hero and a symbol of a new youthful, dignified Russia."
 monrus.37.d.nmd: "$monrus.37.d.start$\n\nIt is hard to say what the exact relationship is between Vladimir and the regime idolising him. The Emperor himself appears in public often, but never makes political statements. He often visits the villages, and his meetings with common Russians are widely publicised. Chairman-Minister Solonevich often idolises the young Emperor in his speeches, making Vladimir the very symbol of an energetic new Russian empire.\n\nIn official media, Vladimir is portrayed as educated and wise, but still in touch with the common people. He and his loyal servant Solonevich simply wish to improve every Russian's life, and refuse any old Tsarist opulence. He is the Tsar of the people, not someone surrounded by fancy guards and isolated in grand palaces."
 monrus.37.a: "And given his age, he might even live to see the 21st century."

 monrus.38.t: "People's Monarchism or New National Narodism?"
 monrus.38.d: "The Germany-based social democrat and dissident Sergey Chakhotin has received great publicity in his recent analysis of the 'political and economic policies of the Solonevich dictatorship'. The text, circulated illegally in Russia, claims that most of Solonevich's policies are merely recycled Svobodism - he has a very similar rural programme relying on small landowners, he similarly claims to oppose financial and political elites, he has similarly centralised power to the government. Chakhotin admits that the Solonevich regime is not as bloody or overtly oppressive, or as interested in social transformation, but at its core it is Svobodism, and seeks the same end goal of a nationalist dictatorship.\n\n[RUS_HeadOfExecutive] Solonevich has never been great at taking criticism. He went to great lengths by publishing a response in the form of a government-printed pamphlet 'Nature of People's Monarchism', which seeks to 'clarify commonly held misconceptions or lies regarding People's Monarchy'. Solonevich argues that only an amateur looks at the APPEARANCE of a system when its fundamental VALUES are what defines it. The People's Monarchy is not founded on individualistic worship of terror and strength, but rather it is founded on the NATURAL conditions of Russia. It stems from a millennia-long tradition that has always existed within Russian society, with its cooperative duality of a wise and powerful monarch and a free, independent common folk. Thus Chakhotin falls into the common socialist fallacy of ignoring the nature of a system when only focusing on its superficial elements."
 monrus.38.a: "Another socialist proven wrong!"

 monrus.70.t: "Wrangel Marches into the Kremlin"
 monrus.70.d: "The coup was swift and efficient. The 3rd Guards Infantry Division, under General-Fieldmarshal Drozdovsky's orders, secured control of the capital, while General-Fieldmarshal Wrangel assumed the role of the public face of the coup. The government was forced to resign under the pressure of the military, and the Emperor swiftly appointed a new Imperial Cabinet out of men approved by the military - most controversially, appointing Wrangel himself as the Chairman-Minister of this 'sabre cabinet'. Public protests were widespread but muffled quickly by the security forces.\n\nThe official narrative claimed that [GetSecondInCommand] and a number of other cabinet ministers had been guilty of embezzlement and various other abuses of their power, including suspicion of cooperation with the German intelligence. Now resigned, the true patriotic government shall guide Russia, until better times are upon us."
 monrus.70.a: "The military, guardian of the nation."

 monrus.71.t: "The Return to Normalcy"
 monrus.71.d: "The war is over. Wrangel's war cabinet served its purpose and led Russia into a great victory. The Black Baron has already announced standing down from civilian politics, like Kolchak before him - 'as his place is in the saddle'.\n\nBut the damage is done, and it is unlikely that our empire will see a healthy democracy in the future with such a precedent, and the various authoritarian changes that were made to state institutions during the war."
 monrus.71.a: "A healthy conservative government is needed."
 monrus.71.b: "We need to maintain a firm hand."

 #Tsar Wrangel path

 monrus.78.t: "Conspiracy of the Drozdovites?"
 monrus.78.d: "The cohabitation between the Vozhd and the commander of his army, the Black Baron, is growing increasingly troubled. The conservative circles of the army have always been lukewarm towards Savinkov's more radical and eccentric policies, but they have tolerated them as long as they have brought victories for Great Russia. But now, in a war that may decide if the next century shall be Russian or German, there is no room for mistakes - and Savinkov has made plenty in his handling of the war.\n\nAt first, it was off-hand comments behind closed doors. And bit by bit, a group of high-ranking generals increased who felt like Savinkov was putting the Russian victory in jeopardy. The core of the conspiracy rose from the ranks of the Drozdovites, who are still rumoured to have their secret monarchist clique. General-Fieldmarshal Mikhail Drozdovsky is a well-known monarchist, but mild-mannered and rarely involved in military politics - but now he, urged by his comrades from the Drozdovites like General Vladimir Vitkovsky, approached Pyotr Wrangel with probing questions.\n\nTerribly treasonous, yes. But perhaps necessary? It is not known what Drozdovsky and Wrangel discussed on their riding trip miles away from the headquarters - the only place without the eyes and ears of the SZRS - but one thing seems clear: a plan exists to save Russia, if the Vozhd proves incapable of doing so himself."
 monrus.78.a: "Worrisome."

 monrus.79.t: "The Imperial Government"
 monrus.79.d: "The Imperial Regent, Ruler of the State, General-Fieldmarshal Wrangel appeared in front of the newly-appointed State Council of Duma in its first session. The Regent appeared noble and haughty, playing the part of a monarch to a boot. In his brief speech, he explained the current situation. Because of the ongoing war, the heir apparent, Vladimir Kirillovich, has cited his inexperience and asked for his crowning to be delayed until after the war. He will be in an advisory role in the Regent's Council until then, but will trust the Ruler of the State to safekeep his throne in the meantime.\n\nThe news was surprising, but not entirely unexpected. It seemed probable that Vladimir did not wish to take the blame for a war that may yet go badly, or that Wrangel had persuaded him to do so. Regardless of what is happening in the shadows, the Regent's address was welcomed by many. Wrangel is considered to be a capable wartime leader, and to some his announcement even evokes the spirit of the civil war, where the Whites had triumphed not under the leadership of politicians, but officers.\n\nIn the same session, the Council of the State was formed to handle matters of government until the state of exception ends. Wrangel's nominated list, with men like Vladimir Romanov, Vasily Shulgin, and General Pavel Shatilov, was accepted by the Counsellors almost unanimously, and was granted full executive powers for the duration of the crisis."
 monrus.79.a: "Frangas, non flectes."

 monrus.80.t: "The Black Baron's Telegram"
 monrus.80.d: "President Savinkov died yesterday in Moscow for his crimes against the Russian people. A military government has been put in place to ensure stability and the victory of the Motherland. The day may be grim, but do not despair. A people united as a nation cannot perish. Our conscience is clear in the eyes of history. I long for the day the Motherland can be united, healed and at peace - and with faith in this, we will prevail. Faith works miracles, and he who believes, who genuinely and courageously follows the path indicated to him by his conscience, he will win. May God watch over Russia.\n\n-Wrangel's Historical Radio Address, [GetDateText]."
 monrus.80.a: "What a choice but a simple duty."

 monrus.81.t: "Wrangel's Imperial Life Guard"
 monrus.81.d: "Savinkov had filled the Moscow Military District - and particularly the Special Purpose Battalion of the Kremlin - with his fanatical supporters, all of whom were either purged or sent to Siberian garrisons after Wrangel's rise into power, just as Gosstrazha units were disbanded. To handle the protection of the capital, a new unit was founded with a touch of propaganda.\n\nThe new Imperial Leib Guard (Life Guard) is largely composed of hand-picked and reliable soldiers under the leadership of General-Lieutenant Mikhail Fostikov, with dramatic Cossack-inspired cavalry uniforms. Under the fancy outside, the new Imperial Guard is given the best equipment in the army, and special training to handle internal security and crowd control."
 monrus.81.a: "They shall serve the Regent well!"

 monrus.82.t: "Council of Industrialists"
 monrus.82.d: "Savinkov's command economy was a mere Ponzi scheme to reward his boot-lickers and sycophants. The VES has been abolished and, in practice, the vast nationalised state corporations have reverted to control of their 'managers' - in many cases, who already had business connections to these companies. The government owns the majority of the shares of these companies, so in practice they are still on our leash.\n\nA Council of Industrialists has been organised as a representative body of major businessmen and bankers of national relevance, meant to advise the government and fulfil the government's requests related to the direction of the economy. The old entrepreneur Vladimir Pavlovich Ryabushinsky has been chosen as the chairman of the body, and Kadet Mikhail Dmitriyevich Kalugin has been appointed as the Minister of Industry and Trade."
 monrus.82.a: "The priority is war and annihilation, and nothing else."
 monrus.82.b: "Gentlemen, start repairing the economy for the long term."

 monrus.83.t: "Wrangel and the Savinkov Constitution"
 monrus.83.d: "After his rise to power, Ruler of the State Pyotr Wrangel has become perhaps the most powerful single individual in all of Russian history. Savinkov's constitutional changes grant the head of state wide-ranging powers to rule as he wishes, and unlike Savinkov, Wrangel also enjoys the full loyalty of the Russian Army. In an ironic twist of fate, the constitutional monarchist finds himself in a position that Kornilov and many other would-be demagogues have only dreamed of.\n\nOf course, the situation is only tolerated because of necessity. The expectation is that these powers will be ceded after the war, and a new constitution for the empire will be written. But until then, Wrangel and his inner circle must decide how to wield their power."
 monrus.83.a: "Humbly; only utilise dictatorial measures where necessary."
 monrus.83.b: "All tools are necessary in the struggle for the Russian future."

 monrus.89.t: "Constitution of the Restored Monarchy"
 monrus.89.d: "As promised, a Constituent Assembly has been convened to rewrite the Russian constitution, using the 1922 document as the basis. The immediate goal is to remove all the Savinkov-era corruption and write the legal basis for a proper constitutional monarchy, but there is a clear division among the delegates on the level of executive power. The conservative faction at the assembly, with men like Ivan Ilyin and Yevgeny Ryshkov, are arguing for a strong, more centralised monarchy, where the Imperial Cabinet has significant powers. They advocate for strict electoral laws to ensure that something like the rise of the SZRS (or worse, a left-wing party) will not happen again. The conservative proposal is vehemently opposed by the liberals, largely composed of the Kadets and a number of Right-SRs. They want to maintain the democratic successes of the Republic, and only change what is necessary.\n\nRegent Wrangel's approval will obviously be needed, whichever proposal gathers the majority at the assembly. He is not favouring either choice, arguing that he is merely maintaining state power - much like Kolchak in 1920 - and it is not his place to dictate the political future of Russia. It is clear, however, that the Regent's concern with stability of the country makes the more radical liberal reforms impossible."
 monrus.89.a: "Conservative approach is chosen."
 monrus.89.b: "More liberal approach is chosen."

 monrus.90.t: "Fate of the Regency"
 monrus.90.d: "The cult of personality around General-Fieldmarshal Wrangel grew into great heights during the war, both as deliberate propaganda to unify the wounded nation, and naturally through Wrangel's charisma and achievements. In Wrangel's formal appearances as the Ruler of the State, many older Russians have noted how much he seems like an Emperor - how nobly he carries himself, how he is able to inspire and guide the Russians like the Tsars of old. This adoration is even greater among the army's young officers, and not only among monarchists. Wrangel seems someone not as tainted by the Civil War as Kornilov or Denikin were, someone humble yet regal, the epitome of both a military commander and a statesman. Naturally, this view is also reinforced by official state media - not to stoke the Regent's ego, but to 'give Russians a unifying figure'.\n\nPerhaps it was only a matter of time when the first article proposing crowning Wrangel was published, by no one else than Vasily Shulgin, in the pages of the 'Sentinel'. Shulgin spoke highly of Wrangel, arguing that all of Russia has seen that the Regent is already fulfilling the role of the monarch, and is perhaps the single most talented and respected figure who could ever carry the responsibility of the restored monarchy on his shoulders. There is an unwritten snub at the young heir presumptive, Vladimir Kirillovich, between the lines.\n\nThe reality is that, given Wrangel's position, he could perfectly well allow himself to be crowned the Emperor - there is no one to stop him, and even if there would be some legitimist opposition from loyal Romanovites, they would ultimately accept Wrangel's accession, especially if the Romanovs received other state honours and prestigious roles. But Wrangel remains undecided, with some of his advisors instead calling for him to step down and allow Vladimir to be crowned, while remaining a power behind the throne.\n\nWrangel is not a man to allow others to influence his decision-making too much, but in this case, he is having doubts - on one hand, he does enjoy massive popularity, especially among his soldiers, and perhaps he could ensure that the Second Empire will survive and not commit the mistakes of the first one. But then again, such a Napoleonic choice would carry great consequences, defining his legacy forever, for better or worse. Sidelining the Romanovs would not be taken well."
 monrus.90.a: "Russia needs a Romanov."
 monrus.90.b: "Without Wrangel there would be no New Russia!"

 monrus.91.t: "Referendum on Wrangel's Coronation"
 monrus.91.d: "The referendum asks a simple question: 'Do you believe that the Ruler of the State and Imperial Regent Pyotr Nikolayevich Wrangel would be fit to serve as an Emperor of All the Russias?'.\n\nThe referendum was largely fair, though turnout was not terribly high. Those who opposed the whole restoration of the monarchy often had no interest in taking part in this 'sham choice' between a general and a Romanov. Surprisingly, many veterans, even those of more republican views, supported Wrangel: perhaps he would mark a clean break from the Romanov past, and his empire would be something else, something better.\n\nThe situation no doubt caused tensions among the Romanovs, who had largely remained silent on the referendum. Vladimir Kirillovich made a short statement that he will abide by the popular will of the people, as his father had. This 'capitulation' to the 'Napoleonic pretender' was not taken well by all Romanovs or their supporters, but ultimately it was clear that the Romanovs could not do much, and it would be best to maintain dignity rather than turn the matter into an election. For many, the restoration of the monarchy was good enough."
 monrus.91.a: "Yes!"

 monrus.92.t: "Coronation of the Black Baron"
 monrus.92.d: "Today marks the day Pyotr Nikolayevich Wrangel ascends to the throne of the Russian Empire as Emperor Pyotr IV.\n\nAlready titled as the Russian Napoleon, Wrangel's coronation has been both popular and controversial. There is no doubt over Wrangel's achievements: he comes from an old and prestigious noble family with centuries-long service to the Russian Empire, he has served faithfully in both the Civil War, and led Russia into its greatest victory in the Great Patriotic War. Personally, Wrangel is charismatic and insightful, almost knightly, like the last flicker of the old, aristocratic world still lingering in the century of metal and machines.\n\nWrangel's regalia has been custom-made; it is more simplistic than that of Nikolay II's. The dynastic coat of arms of the Wrangel family now decorates the new Imperial Palace in Moscow, with the words of the Wrangel family: 'Frangas, non flectes' - You can break, but you cannot bend.\n\nThe day of the Coronation saw some protests against the 'military dictator' Wrangel, but they were largely kept at bay. Politically, Wrangel is known to be a reasonable man, who has never entertained the more extreme end of the political right, so claims that this will only lead to a new Russian State are not taken too seriously by the most. Foreign newspapers seem to be almost idolising Wrangel as the man who defeated Germany and built a new Russia almost single-handedly: a zeitgeist on horseback."
 monrus.92.a: "Long may he reign!"

 monrus.93.t: "Coronation of the Young Tsar"
 monrus.93.d: "Today marks the day Vladimir Kirillovich Romanov, great-grandson of Emperor Aleksandr II the Liberator, ascends to the throne of the Russian Empire.\n\nOnly in his twenties, Vladimir is easily younger than any of his ministers or generals, but maintains the aura of nobility around him, often characterised as a 'serious young man'. While one must admit that Vladimir is not particularly charismatic, he does have 'the charm of a farmer boy', and is modest and insightful. He is very much a son of the republic, having been born in that fateful year of 1917, and has lived through the ups and downs of the republic - culminating in seeing first-hand the terror unleashed by Savinkov's regime.\n\nVladimir has served in the army, is fluent in five languages, and has studied law, business, and agriculture. He was very much raised up as the last hope for the Russian monarchy, raised to excel at the Emperor's duties.\n\nHowever, it is clear that General-Fieldmarshal Pyotr Wrangel - who ceremoniously abdicated from his role as the Regent in the Coronation - holds all the power. Wrangel is personally popular and especially adored by the army. He is the new Kolchak, the epitome of Russian chivalry, of a man who takes the reins at the time of crisis, and once the time comes, retreats back into the role of a servant. Vladimir owes his throne to Wrangel, and everyone knows this. Still, Wrangel is a gracious man, and seems to have a good working relationship with the young Emperor."
 monrus.93.a: "Long may he reign!"

 monrus.94.t: "End of the State of Security"
 monrus.94.d: "The State of Security, which was for the first time passed by Savinkov in 1936 and which had essentially frozen the 1922 Constitution, has given the Ruler of the State immense powers to conduct war. Soon after Wrangel's address to the people declaring the war to be over, another decree finally ended the State of Security - and, de facto, restored Russia as a parliamentary state, albeit in a legal limbo.\n\nA Constituent Assembly has been called into session by the Ruler of State - likely to confirm Russia as a monarchy - and new elections have been promised to be arranged in four months. In these elections, the Anti-Communist laws will be upheld, and likewise, candidates with a background in the SZRS will be barred from running for office.\n\nA great military march was received by General-Fieldmarshal Wrangel in Moscow today, celebrating the victory and return to normality. Cheering crowds were genuinely happy - finally, the nightmare would end! Finally, we can be at peace, stronger than before! Those less optimistic might be wary of the ever-increasing military influence over politics and the cult of personality that the soldiers have been building around Wrangel. Be it either way, one can only hope Wrangel will respect the Constitution."
 monrus.94.a: "Towards a better future..."

 monrus.95.t: "The Democratic Bloc"
 monrus.95.d: "In a rundown to the future elections, the republican opposition has organised itself into the larger electoral alliance of the 'Democratic Bloc'. Composed largely of Socialist-Revolutionaries and other socialists, their progamme includes the demand for Wrangel to stand down and allow the restoration of the Republic via referendum. Additionally, they seek the funding of public healthcare, especially for war widows and orphans, and a list of typical social reforms that were abolished during the Savinkov presidency.\n\nVladimir Rikhter, who has profiled himself as a strong opponent of Savinkov and later of the Wrangel dictatorship, has taken the leading role in the bloc. The Kadets refused to participate, arguing that a constitutional monarchy may not be their ideal, but they will work within it, for the betterment of all Russia, rather than only for their own political goals."
 monrus.95.a: "Always against emperors!"

 monrus.96.t: "Socialist-Revolutionaries Split"
 monrus.96.d: "One would expect the Socialist-Revolutionaries to be sternly against the monarchy, but this does not seem to be the case. Millions of Russians have experienced the war, including many formerly Eser-voting peasants who are now, more or less, 'Marshal's Men', loyal to Wrangel. These Front-Esers still hold dear principles of Right-Esers - democracy, liberty, the common man - but are not entirely against constitutional monarchy.\n\nThis movement has developed into a splinter group opposing decisions of the SR Central Committee. Boris Fyodorovich Sokolov has emerged as the leading figure of these 'practical Esers' or, as their enemies call them, 'Wrangel's Esers'. The most important endorsement they have received came from SR veteran Ilya Fondaminsky - who will not be running for the next election. Fondaminsky called for moderation among SRs, to recognise the political facts and understand that the question of monarchy and republic is not the core issue for SRs, but rather how either system fulfils its promises to the Russian people and their freedoms."
 monrus.96.a: "Esers are divided at a critical moment."

 monrus.97.t: "Shulgin's Scheme"
 monrus.97.d: "Vasily Shulgin, who has served as the head of Wrangel's imperial cabinet and the dutiful executor of the general's will, had a clandestine meeting with a number of other conservative politicians today. As the polls seem to promise a relatively moderate State Duma - one that could not maintain the level of executive control that Shulgin considers desirable for the overall stability of the nation - he is seeking an alliance of the right wing parties that would most effectively take votes that would otherwise go to the left wing faction of the Kadets.\n\nThis union would be built around the VPP, but it would also include Right-Kadet organisations, Shulgin's personal political networks, small far-right groups and a number of veterans' parties that have been organised to support Wrangel's regime. Ideally, this behemoth of the right would be able to secure an absolute majority in the State Duma - and ensure the continuation of the vision of the Empire as a majestic, powerful force rather than a mere return to the parliamentary squabbling of the 1920s."
 monrus.97.a: "That would make us the new Savinkov."
 monrus.97.b: "Yes, our achievements won't be squandered."

 monrus.98.t: "Alliance of the Right"
 monrus.98.d: "The VPS (All-Russian Patriotic Union), with well-known conservative Ivan Ilyin elected as its chairman, has merged the All-Russian Patriotic Party and a dozen smaller political groupings, with each member withdrawing candidates in electoral districts where they could take votes from each other. When compared to the chaos and division of the left, there is a good chance that this large grouping of the right will be able to win by a safe margin, especially as the party has the support of both the military and much of the business elite, albeit informally.\n\nThe VPS's programme is largely that of the VPP, but focused more on ideological statements rather than precise policy. Thus, the VPS 'seeks to do its utmost to ensure the right of every Russian citizen to their personal freedom, personal property, personal safety and personal rights', and to 'enshrine natural Russian values into society'."
 monrus.98.a: "Stolypin would be proud."

 monrus.99.t: "The Elections of [GetYear]"
 monrus.99.d: "The first free elections since 1934 are over, and the votes have been counted. The electoral campaign of the Democratic Bloc was fierce, but ultimately not enough. The left's organisation has suffered greatly because of the Savinkov era and the later wartime restrictions on freedom of publication and freedom of association.\n\nTo many, it felt like an even grimmer version of the 1922 election, which was infamous for being simply organised at a time when the political left was in chaos and ruin, lacking funds and personnel. But between the Kadets and the Conservatives, it remains to be seen who will gain a majority..."
 monrus.99.a: "The All-Russian Patriots and Prince Golitsyn form the government."
 monrus.99.b: "The Kadets and Professor Kartashyov form the government."
 monrus.99.c: "The All-Russian Patriots and Chairman-Minister Shulgin form the government."

 monrus.100.t: "The Torch of Liberty"
 monrus.100.d: "It is a cruel twist of irony that Nikolay Nekrasov, an avowed republican and opponent of Tsarism in his youth, would come to head the Emperor's cabinet. The political left is having a field day ridiculing the Kadets, once more revealing themselves to be spineless and unprincipled, but in truth, the ascendancy of the left wing of the Kadet party to power was a sigh of relief for many. Professor Nekrasov, who was a minister in many 1920s cabinets, is well-liked by the Right-SR leadership and maintains good relations with some social democrats.\n\nHe, like the now-retired Maklakov, is a genuine social liberal and was instrumental in 1922 in persuading the Kadets to accept a federal structure for Russia and the land reform, even to the extent it happened. Nekrasov has been a defender of the cultural rights of minorities in Russia, and in many ways personified all the best aspects of the Constitutional-Democrats - a true dedication to a free society that goes beyond mere words.\n\nWith the Right-SRs led by Ilya Fondaminsky, the two have built a reasonable working relationship out of mutual understanding that, if they cannot govern, the empire is at risk of drifting to the right. The government's chief promises are solidifying a strictly constitutional monarchy, restoring civil freedoms and rule of law, ensuring economic prosperity for every Russian - and, because of the pressure from the Right-Kadets and the military, the continuation of a somewhat aggressive foreign policy, albeit framed more as opposing German tyranny and exploitation."
 monrus.100.a: "Russia will be free, or perish trying!"

 monrus.101.t: "The Turn to the Right"
 monrus.101.d: "For the majority of the 1920s, it was the left wing of the Kadet party - men like Milyukov, Maklakov, Nekrasov, and Dolgorukov - who held sway over the party, with their precious alliance with the Socialist-Revolutionaries. This led to economic turmoil, the humiliation of Russia and ultimately the death of democracy. The new direction of the Constitutional-Democratic Union cannot be as blind. The turn towards the monarchy was not liked by everyone, but at least it represents a chance for a new start - a Russia that is both free and strong, armed by steel, not mere ideas.\n\nPavel Gronsky's cabinet is composed of the right end of the Kadets, so-called 'National Liberals', and supported by various conservatives - and informally, by the military and industrial circles. The government has swept many progressive points under the rug from the Kadet programme, considering the level of workers' protections satisfactory. Military spending will be greatly increased, and the many inefficiencies of the social security system and federal bureaucracy will be fixed.\n\nGronsky has portrayed himself as a patriot, a man who can love both freedom and Russia. He has spoken of the need for Russia to serve as a citadel of stability and reason against both German tyranny and revolutionary chaos, and allies from like-minded nations such as the United States of America. Russia is surrounded by enemies but has a just cause - it would be a betrayal of our values not to pursue our own strength by any means necessary."
 monrus.101.a: "Russia will be strong, or perish trying!"

 monrus.102.t: "The Eurasian Empire"
 monrus.102.d: "Georgy Vernadsky was not an obvious choice to lead the conservative cabinet. But with the current makeup of the State Duma, the Chairman-Minister must be able to appeal to not only the old-school conservatives of the VPP but also the young guards of the People's Monarchists - while still maintaining a working relationship with the Kadets.\n\nVernadsky, a Eurasianist after Trubetskoy's views, has been critical towards the 'imported western liberalism' that was practised in the 1920s to disastrous consequences, and holds that Russia, as a unique civilisation between the East and the West, naturally needs strong executive power to ensure stability. His earlier publications have been used by the opposition to portray Vernadsky as a would-be dictator, but in truth, he is reasonably moderate as far as the All-Russian Patriotic Party goes, and he has the aura of a bland academician who approaches national issues from a very scientific point of view.\n\nVernadsky's cabinet has focused on rebuilding Russia's strength and international standing, portraying the German Empire as the ancestral enemy of Russians, who are an inherently steppe civilisation. In practice, power has largely been delegated to the bureaucrats, industrialists and landowners, and military experts are listened to closely."
 monrus.102.a: "Moscow owes its greatness to the Khans."

 monrus.103.t: "In the Sea of Ignorance and Barbarism"
 monrus.103.d: "Aleksandr Golitsyn is the exact kind of aristocratic gentleman who would have been an imperial minister 30 years ago. His cabinet has promised to restore peace, sanity and faith to Russia, but also vowed to make it a priority to liberate Ukraine and other Lost Territories from German occupation.\n\nGolitsyn is a former Octoberist and a long-time leader of the All-Russian Patriotic Party, and even if he is ridiculed by the People's Monarchists as this old-school remnant, it is largely his achievement that the Russian monarchist movement turned towards actual parliamentary methods instead of mere angry nostalgia literature. He is undoubtedly an elitist who has little faith in 'rule by mobs' - as he once infamously described the State Duma of the 1920s.\n\nHis government clearly cares greatly about the opinions of business interests, landowners, academia and the military - men of ability and knowledge, who are infinitely more capable of making educated decisions than a peasant from Tambov. Golitsyn declared in his speech to the State Council that under his watch, the Russian Empire will stand as the shining light of European, educated and Christian civilisation over the world, in the sea of ignorance and barbarism that is engulfing the Slavic lands from all directions. Russia has saved Europe from the Khans, from Napoleon, from the revolutions of 1848 - and it continues being Russia's sacred duty to protect European culture."
 monrus.103.a: "It is our heavy burden, but we do not complain."

 ### SocRus Events
 socrus.1.t: "Law on Workers' Representation"
 socrus.1.d: "A large RDP majority in the Duma, combined with swayed SR delegates, has given Chairman-Minister Levitsky enough political backing to push through the Law on Workers' and Peasants' Representation. In practice, this means giving union and peasant councils 150 additional seats in the lower house of the State Duma - in practice, all of them socialist or friendly to socialists.\n\nThe SR Chairman, Rikhter, hoped that peasant councils would strengthen the hand of the Right-SRs, but it seems that the vast majority of new delegates prefer the left wing. One of the very resonant arguments for the reform is to stop another Savinkov from 'stealing power' merely through hijacking parliamentarism.\n\nIn practice, this has given Levitsky's Workers' Coalition such a massive majority in the Duma that the country is socialist in all but name. There have been protests and a walk-out staged by the right wing delegates, but the overall feeling is calm. After all, Levitsky does enjoy support, and while this may feel like a parliamentary coup, it is an entirely legal one."
 socrus.1.a: "Socialism through reform? Is that possible?"

 socrus.2.t: "Mass Resignation of the White Generals"
 socrus.2.d: "In a long letter of protest, signed by over 180 officers of high rank, the top brass of the Russian army has explained how they cannot, in good conscience, continue serving under a government which amnesties communist criminals and twists Russian democracy and the legal system to further their own goals. Some hope that the threat of resignation would pressure Levitsky to back down from his most radical plans, but this does not seem probable.\n\nThey do admit that if it is the wish of the Russian people to transition into a socialist-esque system, they will not shed blood because of it - but they also cannot continue serving under such a regime. Their words do include a warning - if this new Russia loses the support of the people, and veers into Bolshevism, the Volunteer Movement will rise again, as many times as necessary.\n\nIn lukewarm cooperation with the government, generals have received pensions and will retain their ranks, retiring as honoured parts of the army. Some have even accepted remaining as military educators. There are not enough officers to fill out all freed vacancies immediately, but a large number of younger generals were immediately promoted to the highest echelons. The new minister of war, and thus the chief of army, is Yury Sablin, the SR candidate, who was preferred over various Bolsheviks."
 socrus.2.a: "Let us build a new and better Russian army."

 socrus.3.t: "Reunification of the Socialist-Revolutionaries"
 socrus.3.d: "The SR party has had a volatile past. It has gone through many splits, the most recent one after the death of Viktor Chernov. Savinkov all but decimated the right wing, turning many good men into traitors to the nation. The left was forced into hiding, returning back to their terrorist roots.\n\nBut now the SR party finds itself in a prime position to gather the majority of the peasantry under a single banner. With the overall leftward shift in Russian politics, the situation has been reversed. In the 1920s, the Left-SRs operated from inside the more politically acceptable right-wing leadership. Now, the Right-SRs are operating from inside the more politically acceptable left-wing leadership - and arguably, many have genuinely embraced a more socialist approach after the failures of the liberal government."
 socrus.3.a: "Peasants are strong together."

 socrus.4.t: "Rise of the Workers' Parties"
 socrus.4.d: "After a long period of being outlawed and persecuted, Russia's socialists are finally free to politically organise. While the majority of socialists have gone to Levitsky's VST, or have remained loyal to the Socialist-Revolutionary cause, there are numerous minor parties being founded.\n\nThe only 'old republic' party that still remains a power is Zeller's Socialist-Democratic Union (SDS), which was created out of the greatly diminished RDP after the radicals left. On the other hand, they have received some new members from the right, from those who believe they can push a more conservative or moderate agenda through the SDS.\n\nAnother new old party is the resurgent Communist Party - RKP(b), whose central committee has returned from exile under Sverdlov, greatly diminished from their glory days. They were further weakened as Tomsky and other Bolsheviks who had made their home in the Russian trade unionist movement refused to bend the knee, and instead joined the VST for greater influence. The Bolsheviks are not particularly well-liked, and among other parties, an unofficial agreement has been formed to keep them away from important positions of power.\n\nFinally, there are dozens of smaller parties formed around influential leftist figures or more marginal ideological strains, like anarchism or women's rights. These minor parties and independents also include a large number of not-so-committed socialists, who are mostly socialist for appearance's sake. Individually, these minor parties don't have much influence, but they do form a relatively large minor bloc in the Congress."
 socrus.4.a: "Socialist discourse at its best."

 socrus.5.t: "Formation of the All-Russian Union of Labour"
 socrus.5.d: "The founding conference of the VST - All-Russian Union of Labour - was held in Petrograd under the chairmanship of the venerable old socialist, Vladimir Levitsky. The core of the conference were radicals from the RDP and trade unionists from the VTsSPS, who have been the driving force in creating a new all-Russian socialist party to replace the social democratic veneer of the RDP.\n\nMany other factions were also invited, most only legalised very recently. Former Mensheviks and even Bolsheviks were there, some returning from foreign exile, while others had simply stayed quiet during the Savinkovist regime.\n\nThe long negotiations illustrated just how shaky of a compromise had been crafted. Though claiming to represent the whole of the Russian urban proletariat, the VST has already shown signs of factionalism. A particularly egregious disagreement was how quickly socialism in Russia can be built: radicals from the RDP have mostly argued for a slow transition out of capitalism, with the nationalisation of major industries while keeping smaller businesses intact. Others, like the Bolsheviks, have argued that Russian socialism cannot be built with half-measures, and that it is a necessity to do away with capitalism quickly and efficiently. This disagreement, not to mention others, has practically split the VST into a left and right faction - with Levitsky's leadership offering a compromise between the two. The construct is shaky, and much of it relied on Levitsky's negotiating skills, but for now, a united front is reality - and it is sorely needed."
 socrus.5.a: "Proletarians unite!"

 socrus.9.t: "The Reformed Bolsheviks"
 socrus.9.d: "Not all Bolsheviks care for Sverdlov's party. Many of the former Bolsheviks have joined the VST and form its left-wing, under the guidance of Lev Kamenev. Kamenev, who avoided the death penalty after the war and remained in prison for a decade, became perhaps the most influential former Bolshevik in post-revolutionary Russia, coming up with a theoretical framework for the future of Russian communism. The All-Russian Union of Labour arguably exists because of Levitsky's and Kamenev's attempts to re-forge the RSDRP of old and bridge the Bolshevik-Menshevik gap.\n\nThe other brand of Bolshevik in the VST are opportunists like Grigory Zinovyev. Zinovyev already broke with Sverdlov in 1931 over disagreement on revolutionary tactics, and his short-lived Russian Communist Workers' Party (RKTP) essentially fused into the VST's left-wing. Zinovyev and Kamenev may have made the same decision - to break with the legacy of Lenin - but even within the VST's left faction, they occupy different positions.\n\nAs for the Bolsheviks, they have had little success in restoring their former glory. Instead, Sverdlov's position has come under threat within a party that is increasingly becoming a place for radical officers. Mikhail Frunze, who is just that kind of person, is no doubt gunning for party leadership and will have an easier time challenging Sverdlov."
 socrus.9.a: "Keep an eye on that Zinovyev."

 socrus.11.t: "One Class, Two Parties"
 socrus.11.d: "It was always hard for more convinced communists to accept that, for the foreseeable future, we are governing together with the Socialist-Revolutionaries. The Esers are critical of Marxism, defenders of the peasantry, hold various suspicious and unorthodox views, and are hell-bent on defining 'unique Russian socialism'. Much of this is complete nonsense, at least to the VST's top theorists, who have their roots in proper Marxism.\n\nThe situation is unlikely to change any time soon, as the Socialist-Revolutionaries are admittedly more popular in many parts of Russian society, especially in the rural areas and in the lower officer corps. Many earlier bourgeois democrats have thrown their lot with the SRs as the 'lesser of two evils'. We believe that in time, the peasant class will disappear through rising material conditions and the awakening of class consciousness, but for now, we must make do with Spiridonova's party, or at least try to restrain the trouble-makers in our own ranks."
 socrus.11.a: "Prioritise unity of the Workers' Coalition."
 socrus.11.b: "Prioritise unity of the VST."

 socrus.12.t: "'Theses on the Past Proletarian Revolutions'"
 socrus.12.d: "After the civil war, it seemed as if all hope was lost for a moment. What followed was greater anti-communist repression than ever under Tsarism. A hundred thousand workers were shot or perished in the prison camps. Both the exiles in France and the remaining socialists in Russia were faced with a moment of terrible existential reflection: What is to be done now?\n\nMuch has been written on the Red Emigration, but two schools of thought emerged. First, there was that of Yakov Sverdlov, Mikhail Kalinin and so on: that it was not the fault of the Communists that the war was lost, but rather overwhelming opposition and betrayals from allies, like the Socialist-Revolutionaries. They are unapologetic about the Cheka and maintain Orthodox Leninism. Sverdlov famously argued that the French socialist state is in the process of degeneration into 'bureaucratic sectarianism', as different parties and unions vie for power with no revolutionary unity. The Orthodox Communists have actually supported some points made by the Totalist Manifesto, namely in opposition to the 'parliamentarism' of Western socialism.\n\nThe larger school of thought emerged in the 1920s largely among Menshevik-aligned thinkers. In Lev Kamenev's 1924 pamphlet written in prison, 'Theses on the Past Proletarian Revolutions', he argued that the mistake committed by Lenin was scorn for plurality and the united front of all socialist parties. Kamenev called for the abandonment of the vanguard party concept, and argued that the French Revolution of 1919 was the proof of concept of a multi-faceted Revolution, pursued by multiple levels of society through revolutionary political parties, labour unions and other proletariat organisations. This was also how the February Revolution had succeeded - but after Lenin started to alienate Soviet democracy and his allies in the Mensheviks and Esers, the Bolsheviks had to turn to even more repression, which in turn made them lose even more allies.\n\nThis analysis was widely accepted by the socialists in Russia, though the exile community largely called it revisionism. In the vein of this theory, Vladimir Levitsky's 'Communist Synthesis' was developed, arguing that any future Russian Communism must exist as a synthesis of socialist views to avoid descent into tyranny and to avoid giving any group the position to impose their will upon democratically elected Soviets. In practice, Levitsky has been trying to forge alliances across Russian socialists to build a popular front over the former Bolshevik-Menshevik divide - something that finally did materialise in the form of the All-Russian Union of Labour."
 socrus.12.a: "Perhaps the left will be united once more."
 socrus.12.b: "Will the Marxists ever stop fighting amongst themselves?"

 socrus.13.t: "Comrades Left Behind"
 socrus.13.d: "A memorial in Moscow was unveiled today, commemorating those Red Émigrés who were never able to return home. The location is only a block away from Trotsky Square, and the sculpture itself is made in modernist style, representing the Third Workingman's International and Russians who gave their blood for its cause. In its base, there are over twenty names. Mikhail Kalinin, the head of the Soviet government in exile, was killed by a French-Russian anarchist in 1924. Nikolay Podvoysky, early commander of the Red Army, was caught and killed as he was organising the smuggling of personnel and equipment to Russia.\n\nAfter 1931, Russian intelligence agencies under the leadership of Klavdy Foss started a proper campaign of assassination, sowing distrust within the émigré community by promising pardons and rewards for those socialists who would betray their comrades. The most tragic day was on the 12th of January 1932, when a Russian bombing of a train carriage near Orléans led to the deaths of Karl Radek and Mikhail Vladimirsky. The case was never proven to be manipulated by Russian intelligence, and officially the French intelligence claimed it was conducted by anti-socialist terrorists directed from Algiers. Chairman Yakov Sverdlov almost miraculously survived an attempt on his life later that year, and paranoia increased.\n\nThey are only a drop of blood in the ocean that was spilled in the aftermath of the civil war. As White Terror swept over the country in 1921, little was spared. Comrade Trotsky died heroically defending a besieged Moscow, and Pavel Dybenko's rear-guard shielded the Arkhangelsk evacuation with their lives. Lenin's body was never found, as he was thrown in one of the many mass graves that could be found in every town in 1921. An even greater memorial is being planned for all those who gave their lives for the first revolution, to remind everyone that death for the revolutionary cause is not a wasted one. Even if these men could not free Russia's shackles, they fought for it nonetheless, so that future generations could succeed."
 socrus.13.a: "We will remember them."

 socrus.14.t: "The Communist Synthesis"
 socrus.14.d: "Why did we, the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Movement, fail twenty years ago? Many, especially among us Mensheviks, argued that one cannot skip through the phases of history; that one cannot force the material conditions necessary for the creation of the revolutionary class consciousness of the masses. The Nechayevian 'end justifies all' mentality of Comrade Lenin only served to unify the forces of reaction against the revolution, and caused much of the proletariat to lose faith in it. Our calls for democratic development of socialism were not heeded.\n\nThe Western success of the mass organisations of the industrial workers serves as proof of the great revolutionary potency of the labour union movement organised through syndicalist principles. This would not have been possible in the Russia of 1917, with our unfortunately primitive material conditions. However, the past twenty years have seen tremendous rise in Russia's industrial potency - and through our hard work, a rise in the strength of its labour unions and in the class consciousness only strengthened by repression.\n\nIn 1917 we said, 'Russia is not ready'. But in [GetYear], I say to the working masses of Russia: we are more than in 1917; we are bolder in political will and stronger in organisation. We do not need terrorists or agitators anymore to build communism in Russia. We do not need a vanguard of self-appointed leaders of the workers. I believe that the Russian proletariat of our decade is capable of governing through grassroots democracy, following the bright light of the West and building Russia towards the inevitable communism of the future.\n\n- Vladimir Osipovich Levitsky in the Congress of the All-Russian Union of Labour of [GetYear]"
 socrus.14.a: "Truer words have never been spoken!"
 socrus.14.b: "All theory, no action."

 socrus.30.t: "Return of the Exiles"
 socrus.30.d: "One of the first acts of [ROOT.GetLeader]'s government was the annulment of all sentences related to political crimes given under the State Protection Act of 1923, which banned all 'communistic' action. Based on this law, thousands of socialists were persecuted and imprisoned, and many fled into the socialist West to join the Bolshevik exiles there. But now most of them are returning on 'Red Ships', bringing our comrades back home from Paris and London.\n\nThe comrades are welcomed warmly in Petrograd, but seeds of conflict were already there as wildly different experiences between the exiles and domestic socialists started to clash. The exiles, who seemed more like military-political clique at this point, believed they were Lenin's true successors - and were greatly disappointed in the state of Russian politics, where it seems they have lost most of their popular appeal in favour of revolutionaries who actually led the last revolution."
 socrus.30.a: "Welcome home!"
 RUS_exiles_have_returned: "The exiles have returned."

 socrus.31.t: "The Russian Communist Party"
 socrus.31.d: "The Old Bolsheviks have established themselves as a political party in Russia under the direction of Yakov Sverdlov and Mikhail Frunze. Their electoral prospects remain to be seen, but Frunze's rally in Petrograd was met with great interest. There, he hailed the Russian people 'in this sacred city of the Revolution' and showed absolutely no remorse nor regret about past events. He talked at length about what he and his comrades had learned of the nature of Communism in their travels: in phalanstères of the new France, in the fierce battles of Red Birmingham, in the steppes of Patagonia.\n\nAll this had inspired the new political programme of the Russian Communist Party of Bolsheviks, titled 'What is to be done?'. It paints a picture of a false revolution, one where liberals and capitalists still remained at large, wearing double-faces in so-called 'workers' delegations'. The champagne socialists in the Duma and in their literary clubs, who have spent the past twenty years hiding like rats inside a social-democratic party, are estranged from true socialism. And Spiridonova? Her party has fought, yes, but the Petrograders should not for a second think that she cares about them more than about her precious peasantry. Only Lenin cared for you then, and only his followers care for you still!"
 socrus.31.a: "Interesting..."

 socrus.32.t: "Bolsheviks in the Officer Corps"
 socrus.32.d: "Lacking political influence, the Bolsheviks have identified the military as one venue of gaining power. Frunze and Tukhachevsky met with Yury Sablin with a proposition. Given the recent mass retirements of officers from the Russian army, experienced commanders are in short supply.\n\nWhile the political leaders talk of downsizing the army and creating People's Militias, military men like Frunze and Sablin - polar opposites on almost every other subject - understand the value of experienced, disciplined officers. Many of the former exiles have been educated in French and British military academies and have plentiful military experience not only from Russia but also from Britain.\n\nIt is obvious that the Bolsheviks see this as a method of increasing their own influence, and to possibly propagate their message in the ranks of the military... but the need for officers is real, and the matter is largely up to Sablin. He would personally have nothing to do with these murderers of the Esers, but then again... it's not like all of the Bolsheviks are fanatics."
 socrus.32.a: "Keep them away from important posts."

 socrus.33.t: "The Krasnaya Gorka Case"
 socrus.33.d: "Defendant: Iosif Vissarionovich Stalin\nCharge: fifty-five cases of murder.\n\nTwo decades ago, the men of Forts Krasnaya Gorka and Seraya Loshad revolted against the tyranny of the Bolsheviks. They were under orders of Poruchik N. M. Neklyudov, a Socialist-Revolutionary like his men. The city was starving, and the Socialist-Revolutionaries were hunted by the commander of the city's defence, I. V. Stalin.\n\nSocialist-Revolutionaries revolted against the tyrant. They fought for four brave days until the Bolsheviks stormed the forts and massacred the defenders. Commissar N. M. Razin, under orders from Stalin, shot 55 men. More disappeared.\n\nThe prosecutor ran through the course of events, introducing witness after witness. Comrade Razin was the chief witness in proving that it had been Stalin who had given the order to execute the soldiers with no trial nor even accusations.\n\nComrade Stalin was oddly calm and did not deny having given the order. His defence was clear: it had been a war, and men under him had turned traitors. According to the laws passed by the Council of People's Ministers, his actions had been legal.\n\nThe prosecution focused on the recently passed Law of Justice Against White Terror, which they used to justify Stalin's executions of Socialist-Revolutionaries as White Terror, to some controversy from the observers. However, given Stalin's contributions to the cause of the workers, the prosecution was willing to reduce his punishment to 10 years of hard labour to wash away his crimes."

 socrus.34.t: "Suicide of Comrade Iosif Vissarionovich"
 socrus.34.d: "Stalin is dead.\nThis was the front-page story today. Comrade Iosif Vissarionovich Stalin, who had been sentenced to ten years of hard labour for his unlawful executions of Socialist-Revolutionary soldiers in 1919, committed suicide.\n\nHe had been held in prison in Petrograd, awaiting transfer to a penitentiary further north. In a shocking lapse of security, he was allowed into a fifth-floor, windowed room for a medical examination. According to the witnesses, Stalin fell from the window and died immediately after the fall. The guards assigned to him failed to stop him, and have been transferred to less critical duties."
 socrus.34.a: "Terrible accident."

 socrus.35.t: "The Great Bolshevik Trial"
 socrus.35.d: "The defendant: former members of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks)\nCharge: --------\n\nComrade Sverdlov was calm. Frunze had thrown a drunken fit of rage. Few had resisted arrests, and had escaped or died.\n\nThose left of the civil war-era Bolshevik leadership have been dragged before the People's Tribunal and were accused of various crimes, including the murders of hundreds of Left-Esers in suppression of the SR protests - many of these orders given by Sverdlov. Likewise, the Bolshevik leadership was accused of terror against the people, authorising the indiscriminate killing, torture and imprisonment of Russian working people and other socialists on shoddy grounds. The trial was absolute chaos, as there were too many accusations and too many defendants, but it proceeded anyhow, largely due to the insistence of the SRs and the right wing of the VST.\n\nThe majority pleaded innocent, and some were acquitted - but the leadership, especially Sverdlov, was vigorously hunted down by the people's prosecutors. In a month-long marathon trial, the prosecutors built up the case to prove that Lenin's inner circle had knowingly ordered the deaths of thousands, and while their goals may have been noble, their means were horrifying. There was no lack of witnesses, though it was obvious how muddy the waters were, considering how chaotic the times had been.\n\nIt was no surprise that the jury deemed the majority of the defendants guilty, and long labour sentences were passed. Most of the Bolshevik leadership would spend the next dozen years, at least, in work penitentiaries washing away their crimes in mining and wood-cutting. Some sympathy protests were organised outside the courthouse as the defendants were marched out of the building."
 socrus.35.a: "A closure."

 socrus.37.t: "The Green Partisans"
 socrus.37.d: "The reactionary opposition was unable to mount organised resistance against us, but the ugly remnants of Savinkovism and Kornilovism are still alive. In many rural and distant regions, peasants have organised to resist attempts by the people's government to reach them. In some regions, they have been blocking roads and refusing taxes. In others, there have been armed raids against the People's Militia. This is made more difficult by the workers' self-organisation, which has allowed these resisting peasant communities to elect their own officials, often candidates of the clergy.\n\nWhat are these men protesting against? Their common rallying cry is 'we have land, we don't need more!'. Ironically, the land reforms have now come to bite us in the back. Unlike in 1917, now the majority of Russian peasants are landowners, or own land through their village, and have no hated landlord class ruling over them. This was thought to inoculate rural Russia against socialism - and it seems to have worked. Because with such conditions, there's not much socialists can promise to these people - and their fears are great, as many remember the wartime grain requisition policies.\n\nAn alliance of the peasants and the clergy, bolstered regionally by the Cossacks, has become the source of the so-called Green Partisans, who declare they are fighting for faith and property of every man."

 socrus.38.t: "To the Villages!"
 socrus.38.d: "The new party initiative - To the Villages! - has generated much interest in urban socialist circles towards the idea of modernising the countryside both ideologically and materially. The duality of technological backwardness and poor education are seen as the main causes of rural discontent. There is already a programme to modernise methods of rural production, but the ideological side will be led by young, enthusiastic students who are sent to the villages to work and to teach the people the doctrine of socialism, and how it is actually the natural state of the Russian countryside, while capitalist private property is an anomaly introduced by serfdom.\n\nThese organisers have also taken up the task of building rural branches for socialist parties to better involve the peasants in local administration. The posters preach the union of the workers and are trying to paint the Church and the independent landowning peasants as leeches in the side of the peasant communes. There have also been initiatives to found new rural schools and higher agricultural schools, which would educate the new ideologically conscious rural working class.\n\nThe reaction to these projects varies greatly, from lukewarm acceptance to outright hostility."

 socrus.39.t: "Murder of Comrade Zhurenko"
 socrus.39.d: "The small Bashkirian village of Nizhny Avzyan became the focal point of all news this week. The People's Militia of Beloretsk was informed of the disappearance - and later it was found out the murder - of 19-year-old VST activist and engineering student, Ivan Sergeyevich Zhurenko, a native of Moscow who had enthusiastically volunteered as a People's Instructor to the rural Urals.\n\nWhat happened is still a matter of investigation, but it seems that Zhurenko's attempts to organise the workers of the region and found a Marxist reading circle were met with hostility. After a small group of armed peasants broke up the meeting of the reading circle, Zhurenko refused to leave, and some days later was found on the roadside, murdered with an axe. Three days later the murderer turned himself in - a 52-year-old farmer and veteran, Igor Igorevich Belov. During his arrest, he made a scene and repeatedly shouted that 'you communists should have been all shot'.\n\nThe actual tragedy has been overshadowed by the way major socialist newspapers have covered the case. They paint Comrade Belov as the archetypal peasant, ignorant and brutish, and protests showing Comrade Zhurenko's images have been demanding a harsh sentence for the 'child-killer'. A Duma faction has organised around the hardline Marxist Ivan Gronsky to call for harsher measures to pacify the countryside, and that in the future, in addition to instructors, loyal militiamen be sent to accompany them."

 socrus.40.t: "Revolt in the Congress"
 socrus.40.d: "After the government's decision to maintain a peaceful course towards the ongoing rural unrest, the opposition in the Left-VST and from the Bolsheviks only grew stronger. In today's session, Grigory Zinovyev, spokesman of the 'communist bloc' of the parliament, denounced [ROOT.GetLeader]'s 'soft measures' and forced a vote to bring down [GetSecondInCommand]'s government. They were not able to gain a majority, even though there was a much greater amount of defections from VST than expected.\n\nHowever, this was only the first round in the struggle for the soul of the Workers' Coalition. Mikhail Tomsky of the VTsSPS Central Committee announced his support for Zinovyev's demands, and the intent of the communist unions to pressure the government through mass strikes against the Socialist-Revolutionaries and their 'crypto-bourgeois cronies'. In Moscow and Petrograd, the communists are making it clear that peasants are hoarding food and its prices will remain high for the workers unless decisive action is taken to bring order to the countryside. This argument seems to resonate, even if it is based more on fears rather than actual shortages of food."
 socrus.40.a: "We have no choice but to agree."
 socrus.40.b: "Let him shout."

 socrus.41.t: "The General Strike"
 socrus.41.d: "Today, the Central Committee of the All-Russian Central Assembly of Trade Unions (VTsSPS) declared a general strike in all workplaces that are part of member unions. While some unions refused to cooperate, mostly out of loyalty to the Socialist-Revolutionaries, the strike has all but stopped Russia in its tracks. The demands have grown since the last debates: in the VTsSPS's case, they demand that all power be given to the unionised workers, and the last remnants of parliamentarism swept away. In practice, this would mean an electoral victory for Zinovyev's faction of the VST, and the implementation of harsher communist policies.\n\nThe longer the strike continues, the more it hampers people's lives as they run out of coal to heat their homes and shops are emptied. Neither side can continue forever. It is just a question of who flinches first."
 socrus.41.a: "Sigh, implement their anti-peasant policies..."
 socrus.41.b: "Just wait it out..."
 socrus.41.c: "They must listen to reason!"
 socrus.41.e: "Call an emergency meeting of the cabinet."

 socrus.42.t: "Negotiated Solution"
 socrus.42.d: "After lengthy closed-door negotiations between Zinovyev's faction and [ROOT.GetLeader], some kind of truce has been made. The government has accepted limited measures regarding the peasant question, but also promised to maintain a cheap enough price for grain no matter what.\n\nAdditionally, members of the Left-VST have been appointed to certain important posts in industrial planning agencies, and other minor concessions have been made. It is a deal that can be taken as a lukewarm victory by both sides."
 socrus.42.a: "The Workers' Coalition survives another day!"

 socrus.43.t: "Emergency Meeting"
 socrus.43.d: "The Socialist-Revolutionary Party has been put in an impossible position, started Comrade Kamkov: accepting Zinovyev's demands would mean turning back on the Russian peasants, who are the backbone of the Socialist-Revolutionary Party. Not doing so is causing misery to everyone and would greatly harm the SR's popularity in the cities. After all, they cannot claim to be socialists while abandoning the urban workers.\n\nSo, what is to be done?\n\nThe situation has strengthened the argument of the SR-Maximalists around Comrade Nestroyev against cooperation with other socialists. It is scarily reminiscent of 1917 to many - moments before the Socialist-Revolutionaries lost control of the revolution and a terrible tyrant rose to power. The SRs could order Zinovyev to be arrested for counter-revolutionary actions, but the grounds for that are rather shaky. It would be a step towards a police state with no return, warns Comrade Spiridonova.\n\nAssassination was also brought up by Comrade Blyumkin, though it was deemed very risky. However, if arrests or assassinations were chosen, it would also let the SRs get rid of some of the worst Bolshevik figures who remain at large.\n\nComrade Karelin proposed a more optimistic plan. He argues that the problem is not cooperation with other leftists, but Zinovyev's caesarist tendencies. If SRs could build a unanimous front from Levitsky and Abramovich to Zeller and denounce Zinovyev's actions, they might be able to delegitimise him as trade union leader and force a change of leadership through public pressure. State propaganda could be harnessed to portray him as the main cause of the strike. Of course, this would probably require political concessions to the right wing of VST."
 socrus.43.a: "Call Levitsky to the next meeting."
 socrus.43.b: "Prepare to remove Zinovyev by any means necessary."

 socrus.44.t: "Fighting in the Countryside"
 socrus.44.d: "Detachments of People's Militia, armed with armoured cars, have been sent to breach peasant strikes in many regions and to arrest Savinkovite agitators and other counter-revolutionaries who have riled up the peasants with lies. In some regions this has led to conflict, like in rural Cherepovets, where the commune's own militia, composed of peasants, refused to help the militiamen sent from Vologda, and fighting broke out as the local guard was demanded to disarm.\n\nNews of 'peasant-killers' was spread quickly by the counter-revolutionaries, further heightening rural tensions. Now in some cities, there is even recruitment of new People's Militias, often spearheaded by former Bolsheviks, to march to these resisting communes and arrest the agitators by force."
 socrus.44.a: "Let us hope it's over quickly."

 socrus.45.t: "Vozhd i Svoboda!"
 socrus.45.d: "The Leader and Freedom! That is the new call of this peasant resistance. How quickly have they started to see the brutal Savinkov regime with nostalgia-tinted glasses, genuinely wishing for a strong leader and the imagined freedom it brings?\n\nYet, this slogan is repeated by peasant mobs as the Militia's armoured tractors tear down their barricades and break up protests. More and more arrests are being made, with the suspicion that anyone with former ties to SZRS and SOR are behind the propaganda."
 socrus.45.a: "Have they already forgotten?"

 socrus.46.t: "Villagers Flock to Matushka"
 socrus.46.d: "As tensions in the rural regions have constantly grown, many peasants have started to make appeals to the Socialist-Revolutionaries to help them. Comrade Spiridonova, often respectfully called 'Matushka' in the letters, has always been a keen listener to the worries of the peasants, and remains possibly the most peasant-friendly figure in the socialist leadership.\n\nThe peasants tell of persecution, arrests and fears of greater collectivisation and poverty, and wish for the great Socialist-Revolutionary Party to stop the plans of the 'ignorant communists' of the VST."
 socrus.46.a: "SRs must stand by the peasants!"
 socrus.46.b: "Building socialism is a greater goal."

 socrus.47.t: "The Esers March Out"
 socrus.47.d: "In a grand protest, most of the Socialist-Revolutionaries marched out of the Congress as a protest, washing their hands of [RUS.GetLeader]'s anti-peasant policies. In Andrey Kolegayev's fiery speech, he condemned the whole government and Russian communists as agents of Western syndicalist powers who seek to destroy the Russian way of living. He had the unsolicited support of almost the entire SR faction, even those who have previously been supportive towards us. Unable to bring down the government, the SRs instead seek to rob the Congress and its various committees of quorum, and essentially freeze decision-making. The party has organised similar walk-outs in most regional Soviets not controlled by the SRs, and in the ones where they have a majority, they have sought ways to avoid putting Moscow's policies in place.\n\nThe address by the SRs, 'representing the rural peoples of Russia, who make up its majority', demands an end to the 'unfair harassment' towards the rural workers and respect for peasant Soviets."
 socrus.47.a: "Accept some demands."
 socrus.47.b: "No compromises."

 socrus.48.t: "Peasants Losing Faith"
 socrus.48.d: "The Socialist-Revolutionary Party leadership refused to change their course, despite the pleas from the rural branches of the party. Anti-clerical policies and the increased harassment of rural areas in search of 'White agents' has led to widespread resentment, and even the birth of some anti-SR independent parties, like the Party of People's Socialists (not related to the original NSP) and the Union of Siberian Peasants.\n\nThis has greatly reduced the power of the SRs in some regions, and will only contribute to the rural unrest."
 socrus.48.a: "Ungrateful swine-herders..."

 socrus.49.t: "Opposition from the Faithful"
 socrus.49.d: "It is no surprise that the Russian Orthodox Church remains a stronghold of reaction. While the Patriarch has maintained an official truce with temporal authorities, he has never condemned anti-socialist activities by his followers. Especially in rural regions, the clergy holds much sway over the hearts and minds of the people, and they have made every attempt to delegitimise our government.\n\nOur scientific socialism is called Satan's belief, whose prophets are Darwin and Lenin. It would be harmless talk if it didn't actually embolden non-compliance and resistance in the countryside."
 socrus.49.a: "Pressure the Patriarch to act."
 socrus.49.b: "Imprison non-conformist priests."

 socrus.50.t: "Society of the Godless"
 socrus.50.d: "Wake up, proletariat! Wake up from the chains of myths! Thus goes the call of the newly-founded Society of the Godless, spearheaded by well-known atheist journalist and historian Nikolay Rumyantsev. He and his atheistic society, already founded in the 1920s, have sought to disprove Christianity - and any religion, for that matter - through science, and Rumyantsev does claim that Christ is a provably fictional character, of similar historical basis as Zeus or Odin.\n\nAs an anti-religious mood has surged in the urban socialist movement, Rumyantsev has become the natural organiser for a broader anti-religious movement, which seeks to mobilise Russian intelligentsia to destroy God from Russian culture, and to mobilise workers to fight superstition and the tyranny of the Church by all means available. Some more vocal and political members of the movement have even organised 'Atheist Militants' to volunteer in rural People's Militias to harass the church and destroy icons from the peasantry. The question of faith has quickly become a raging wildfire as opponents of the regime are grasping onto the Church as if they're drowning, while supporters are embracing more hardline atheism as a counter."
 socrus.50.a: "This is only making things worse, restrict them."
 socrus.50.b: "An admirable initiative!"

 socrus.51.t: "Commissariat of Rehabilitative Labour"
 socrus.51.d: "It is a great tragedy to our socialist system that some of the prison complexes abolished after Savinkov have been tacitly re-opened to house an increasing number of dissidents. After the People's Militias started to make mass arrests against Savinkovite dissidents and other anti-social agitators, the prisons have been overflowing, and the massive reduction of prison capacity after the fall of the Vozhd has proved to be a mistake.\n\nObviously we do not wish to run a police state, but the other option is to let these people freely undermine the socialist system we are building. As the father of Russian socialism, Nikolay Chernyshevsky, believed: these people are not evil by nature, simply misguided, and will understand that socialism will improve everyone's life eventually. But until we are closer to communism, some amount of coercion may be needed.\n\nHowever, at this rate, we will be needing more prisoner capacity soon, and law enforcement has silently proposed to re-open some of the most modern prisoner camps. These would be organised under the Commissariat of Rehabilitative Labour (Koretrud) under the People's Ministry of Internal Affairs to ensure transparency."
 socrus.51.a: "Just the bare minimum..."
 socrus.51.b: "Yes, the ends justify the means."
 socrus.51.c: "No! Just arrest fewer people!"

 socrus.52.t: "The Sebezhsky Mass Grave"
 socrus.52.d: "Woodcutters from Opochetsky Commune came across a disturbing find in the Sebezhsky forest near the border of Belarus. It was a mass grave. The initial assumption by locals was that the buried men were victims of Klepikov's Okhrana, which had organised multiple mass killings by 1936. But closer inspection revealed it to be more recent - and that the men buried there were SZRS party members, instructor-volunteers and officers from the region. As the scale of the extrajudicial killing was revealed, it became clear that the only organisation capable of it had been the VGPU.\n\nIt seems that either local leadership or Director Blyumkin himself had not been satisfied with the punishments given to these Svobodniks, and had instead given them a bullet in the head and left them in a bog. In all honesty, most would agree that Savinkovites deserve death, but the incident is still disturbing, and has been covered up as something that had happened on the day of Savinkov's death, when the uprising against SZRS was at its greatest."
 socrus.52.a: "Blyumkin, what the hell?"
 socrus.52.b: "Well, it is their job to do our dirty work..."

 socrus.53.t: "Manifesto of Productivism"
 socrus.53.d: "The art of the bourgeois republic was catered to the interests of the elite. Savinkov's chained art was forced to sing of the glory of the Vozhd and death. Finally, art can be given back to the people! An inter-party group of artists, led by Boris Arvatov and Aleksey Gan, have started their own artistic association to remake Russian arts into something that common workers can understand and appreciate.\n\nInspired by both the proletarian art of France and Britain, but also the Cubo-Futurist tradition, Arvatov and Gan wish to abandon old elitist aesthetics and focus on a marriage between usage and beauty. A beautiful object is one that is rational and clear, and all should have access to them. Thus, the Productivists are putting a special focus on industrial design, cinema, architecture - aspects of the modern industrial world that are ever-present, not restricted to art galleries and libraries."
 socrus.53.a: "Give them official sponsoring!"

 socrus.54.t: "The Future of the Russian Army"
 socrus.54.d: "The Russian Army, as it exists, is still largely a creation of the White generals, and its values and training focus greatly on bourgeois propaganda such as individual heroism and nationalism. It is hardly the aristocratic behemoth that it was in 1917, but still, many socialists would prefer to see the army thoroughly transformed, to have it shed its pseudo-aristocratic skin and restore the best parts of the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army.\n\nFirst, there are those who broadly agree on the direction of the Russian Army, and wish to maintain that development. Mikhail Tukhachevsky argues that the mobility-oriented doctrine and focus on armour development by Slashchyov and Markov was the right choice, and should be continued. He is echoed by Boris Shaposhnikov, a theorist and disciplinarian who is also arguing in favour of maintaining as professional an army as possible. Naturally, many 'republican' generals agree with this sentiment, seeking to keep the military depoliticised.\n\nTheir opposition is drawn around Mikhail Frunze, Vasily Blyukher and Mikhail Levandovsky. Frunze has been organiser of the International Brigades and asserts that a revolutionary army should be a Marxist army. All of the proletariat should be armed and trained, while an elite of ideologically devoted volunteers would act as the sword of the revolution. This, they argue, has been proved by the successful guerilla campaigns of Blyukher and Levandovsky, and numerous successful revolutions abroad."
 socrus.54.a: "Favour the apolitical army model."
 socrus.54.b: "The Workers' and Peasants' army rises again!"

 socrus.55.t: "The Abolition of Cavalry?"
 socrus.55.d: "The Russian Army has a long and proud cavalry tradition, and has given the world many of the finest cavalry officers of the 20th century. But now the whole branch has come under fire from multiple directions. Despite his support for maintaining the Russian military as it currently is, Mikhail Tukhachevsky has expressed his distaste for cavalry in general. He argues that it is not only outdated and anti-industrial, it is also plagued by the aristocratic-bourgeois cult of individual heroics and modern-day bogatyrs.\n\nThis criticism has been supported by Mikhail Frunze, especially from the ideological viewpoint. Instead, the role of cavalry should be taken by motorised forces, even if we can afford fewer of them than the current cavalry corps that we possess."
 socrus.55.a: "We still need cavalry!"
 socrus.55.b: "Yes! The future belongs to the motor!"

 socrus.56.t: "The People's Navy"
 socrus.56.d: "Even if Admiral Aleksandr Kolchak and his aristocratic cronies are gone from command, everything in the Russian Navy has an aura of bourgeois elitism. Former Supreme Admiral Kolchak, the Butcher of the Revolution, wasted colossal amounts of Russia's wealth on battleship programmes and other such frivolities. His adherence to crypto-Mahanian doctrine was old-school imperialism and utterly irrelevant to Russia's true security.\n\nBut now, the winds of change are blowing, as young, gifted officers outside the Kolchak clique are being raised to positions of influence. Perhaps the loudest reformer is Vasily Gerasimovich Kuznetsov, only recently promoted admiral. He has proved to be an energetic and popular commander, who has taken it as his task to remove the Navy's aristocratic stain and make it a truly proletarian branch of service.\n\nDoctrinally, Kuznetsov believes that the focus on a heavy surface navy was a mistake, and instead proposes reliance on submarine forces, naval aviation, and a surface fleet specialised in maintaining connection with the British Navy and protecting Russia's coastal regions. Incidentally, there is broad political support for the plan too, as it is considerably cheaper than maintaining a heavy surface fleet, with political backing for his plan coming especially from the Minister of Naval Affairs, Vladimir Alafuzov. Ironically, the loudest opposition to the plan has come from the army, as Mikhail Tukhachevsky has criticised reducing the number of battleships in service, arguing that they play an important role in supporting ground operations."
 socrus.56.a: "Good work, Admiral Kuznetsov."

 socrus.57.t: "Drafting Operation Kutuzov"
 socrus.57.d.start: "The Planning Department of the General Staff has been busy with war preparations as they have been adapting 'Operation Yekaterina' to coordinate better with our Western allies. The drafting of Operation Yekaterina had originally begun in 1934 on Savinkov's order and it imagined a rapid Russian advance with shock and mass, overwhelming the defences before German forces could reinforce the East properly."
 socrus.57.d.tukha: "$socrus.57.d.start$\n\nOur army leadership has discussed the plans thoroughly with attachés of the French and British militaries, and has decided to maintain the basic concept of Yekaterina intact as Operation Suvorov. Tukhachevsky especially has defended the old plan, and considers it the best way to defeat Germany and their puppet armies: a war of rapid movement, focused on swift, operational strokes. Ideally, the Western Allies will tie down a sizeable portion of the German army in the west, while the Russian army marches rapidly through Ukraine and Belarus.\n\nIf the main stroke fell on the northern sector, the distance to Germany would be the shortest and possibly enable complete encirclement of the Baltic states, leading to the rapid capitulation of Lithuania and Belarus. However, the terrain for such an operation is less forgiving than in the south. If Ukraine is chosen as the main target, we can best utilise our armour advantage and swiftly defeat Germany's eastern bulwark, but time spent there means Germany will be able to reinforce the northern, more defensible sectors."
 socrus.57.d.frunze: "$socrus.57.d.start$\n\nOur army leadership has discussed the plans thoroughly with attachés of the French and British militaries, and has decided to radically change the plan. A rapid, bloody offensive is not necessary, as we can be assured that the Ukrainian and Belarusian proletariat will overthrow their capitalist regimes rather than fight their comrades.\n\nInstead, Russia should focus on total revolutionary mobilisation. The Russian Army is like a stone that starts an avalanche, like the French revolutionary armies of the 18th century, formed around the revolutionary will of the comrade-soldiers. We will bleed Germany dry and exhaust the capitalist regimes. The Western advisors seemed somewhat sceptical about some aspects of the plan but broadly agreed that Russia should leverage its main advantage, a massive manpower pool and the ability to outlast Germany together with the West."
 socrus.57.a: "Conduct the northern thrust."
 socrus.57.b: "Ride through the Dniepr steppe."
 socrus.57.c: "The Russian people will rise like a storm."
 RUS_upon_taking_war_focus_tt: "Upon taking the focus §YThe War to End All Wars§!:"

 socrus.58.t: "The People's Militia System"
 socrus.58.d: "The transformation of the law enforcement system has been drastic. Russian civil police have never made a secret of their anti-communism, and it is no surprise that police officers were often supportive of reactionary politics. Thus, on the decree of [GetSecondInCommand]'s government, the civil police have been abolished and its functions transferred to the Directorate of People's Militia (UNM) under the People's Ministry of Internal Affairs.\n\nPeople's Militias have been organised in every urban centre and volost as a voluntary law enforcement force. They are also given military training and serve as a reserve pool for the Army. Militia officers are appointed by the local Soviet from men of good standing and necessary level of education, further educated in civil policing in the Militia Schools (in many cases, former police academies). The rank and file of the Militias are only called to service when necessary. More serious or political crimes are relayed to the VGPU, which can utilise the Militias as its eyes, ears, and arms."
 socrus.58.a: "Place ideological requirements for membership."
 socrus.58.b: "Membership should be based only on ability."

 socrus.59.t: "Radicalisation of the Militia"
 socrus.59.d: "What was intended to be a non-partisan revolutionary law enforcement force has turned into another area of politics, especially in regions with more unrest. As the activities of underground Whites have intensified, especially in Southern Russia and in the Cossack Oblasts, more radical voices have won in the Soviets.\n\nFor example, the Rostov-on-Don Soviet has recently gained an SR-Maximalist majority, who have started to fill leadership positions in the Militia with other Maximalists, arguing that a firmer hand is necessary against White sabotage. In other regions, even if the Soviet is in moderate hands, the Militias themselves have turned more radical in their means, often in reaction to having to maintain public order against counter-revolutionary organisations.\n\nThis is a worrying prospect, as the Militias wield considerable local power, and there are even cases of them arresting other socialists for crimes only for the accusations to fall flat in people's courts. Yakov Serebryansky, the Director of the UNM, argued that Militias have been successful at combating counter-revolutionary terror, and has pointed to the large numbers of arrests especially in Rostov and Stavropol Oblasts. According to Comrade Serebryansky, the Congress should not let idealism blind them - Russia still has many counter-revolutionary cells, and eradicating them is a task that requires harsher methods."
 socrus.59.a: "The Militias must be professionalised further to avoid chaos."
 socrus.59.b: "Admirable! They have a true revolutionary spirit."

 socrus.60.t: "The Administrative Reform of [GetYear]"
 socrus.60.d: "In matters of local democracy, Russia has made decent strides in the 1922 Constitution, which introduced Gubernial and Uyezd level democracy and Dumas like any modern democracy should have. But this system was still inherently bourgeois in nature, with numerous appointed positions.\n\nThe new socialist system is directed from the grassroots up, with village and factory soviets (councils) as the foundational level. The soviets form a pyramid, as they send representatives to each higher body - Volost Soviet, Uyezd Soviet, Oblast Soviet (replacing the Gubernias), and finally, into the Congress of Soviets and Labour Unions. In practice, delegates from factory soviets belong to their respective labour union, which would have its own internal democracy and role in organising the regional economy. Soviet elections are held each year, and delegates are always recallable.\n\nWhat were previously known as Commissarial Gubernias - those regions with significant non-Russian populations - will be organised as Autonomous Oblasts or Labour Communes. Cossack Hosts will be abolished. Former Federal Autonomies such as the Alash Autonomy will be granted further self-rule and be organised into Autonomous Labour Republics, sisters and comrades of the Russian Democratic Federative Socialist Republic (RDFSR)."
 socrus.60.a: "A higher form of democracy."

 socrus.61.t: "The Russian Anarcho-Syndicalism"
 socrus.61.d: "Pyotr Kropotkin's homeland has always been a haven for anarchists of many kinds. Anarcho-syndicalists such as Vsevolod Volin and Grigory Maksimov are counted among the most influential post-revolutionary Russian syndicalists, and Volin's theory of 'synthesis anarchism' greatly influenced the All-Russian Union of Labour and Levitsky's theory of Communist Synthesis. Volin was unfortunately murdered by the Svobodnik death squad in 1933, but his memory lives on.\n\nThere are anarcho-syndicalists in both the VST and the PSR, largely differentiated by the nature of their work. More urban workers tend to support the VST, while more rural unions, such as forestry or railwaymen, are among the most loyal Esers. Russian anarcho-syndicalists have always been the greatest supporters of free labour unions and the free organisation of society through them, and this has only strengthened with the successful example of Western revolutions.\n\nThe role of labour unions in Russia is seen as being the economic organisers of Soviets, responsible for 'Trudoplans', regional plans agreed by relevant unions of the region to cooperate and direct economic life for the betterment of society. This is seen as a healthy check against government power, as much of economic life is regulated by these unions rather than the state. In fact, it was the syndicalists in Russia who opposed any idea of a 'labour chamber' in the Congress, as they did not wish to see the unions become mere replacements of state bureaucracy, but an independent and powerful societal force."
 socrus.61.a: "Truly, Russians can improve any ideology."

 socrus.62.t: "Towards Planned Economy"
 socrus.62.d: "Although making rapid industrial advances in the 1920s, Russia is still a second-rate great power in industrial terms, notwithstanding our tremendous potential. Despite opposition from the moderates in VST and PSR, we have taken the first steps towards introducing full state planning to our economy to ensure a rapid pace of development.\n\nWe have established the Fedplan, composed of delegates from labour unions and economists to oversee the creation and implementation of the first 4-Year Plan. The main theorists behind our economic policy are Stanislav Strumilin and Sergey Dubrovsky, both respected in their own field and proponents of rapid industrialisation through state intervention. In Strumilin's analysis of Savinkov's VES, he points out that it had a sound economic rationale, but in practice it failed to deliver due to compromises with capitalist interests and rampant corruption in the SZRS. The Fedplan is a half-democratic, half-technocratic body under the supervision of the Congress, and the current government has placed high hopes on it.\n\nThe first 4-Year Plan is focused on thorough socialisation of the economy, expansion of heavy and military industry in preparation for the coming war, and mechanisation of agriculture. From these, more advanced industries can be built in the future. While the lowest levels of economy are still relatively free, the Fedplan has quickly established a bureaucracy to oversee the unions, which act as the chief implementers of the Fedplan's directives. It remains to be seen how successful the plan will be."
 socrus.62.a: "The future cannot be stopped."

 socrus.63.t: "Economy of Free Association"
 socrus.63.d: "Initially, many feared a repeat of the catastrophes of the War Communism that the Bolsheviks implemented, but the economic system of the RDFSR has turned out to be more moderate than expected. The government's leading advisors in economic matters, such as Socialist-Revolutionary Aleksandr Elyashevich and Danist Aleksandr Finn-Yenotayevsky - both former Mensheviks - have led a slow transition of the economy with the aim of reforming rather than revolutionising the economic system.\n\nYes, private property has been abolished, but state control over the economy has been kept reasonably limited. Only matters of national importance, such as infrastructure, armament industries, power generation, and mining are under the bureaucrats of the Ministry of Industry and Trade, while most of the economy is composed of small enterprises (artels), cooperatives, unions, and so on. The state's role is to regulate and invest, while local associations of people are given as much economic freedom as possible.\n\nThis has been criticised as 'market socialism' by opponents of the policy, while others point out that 'small capitalism' is not conducive to rapid industrialisation. Despite criticism from the left, this mixed system has been relatively popular, especially in the rural regions, and has not led to great economic disruption. Still, it remains to be seen how these policies will work over a longer timespan."
 socrus.63.a: "One cannot force prosperity."

 socrus.64.t: "The New Russian Peasant"
 socrus.64.d: "The Russian land ownership situation has changed drastically since 1917. The civil war, 1920s-1930s land reforms, and recent distribution of the remaining large estates have created a Russia of middle peasants. If in 1917 typical rural families were impoverished tenant farmers or cottagers, the average Russian peasant of [GetYear] is far more like his contemporaries in Poland or Finland. Desolate small farmers still exist, but most of them are what would have been classified as serednyaks - middle peasants - or kulaks, high-income peasants. Bednyaks - low-income peasants - and batraks - landless rural folk - no longer form the overwhelming majority of the rural population.\n\nThis carries a number of consequences. The peasants are more independent, more organised, less radical - but also often view socialism positively, a courtesy of the long work of the Socialist-Revolutionaries as Russia's foremost peasant party. But this 'peasant socialism' is hostile to collectivisation or drastic changes to land ownership - quite the contrary, as to them, an ideal socialist peasant would be an independent peasant tilling his land, with no landlords or tenants.\n\nThe peasantry generally either support the SRs, or remain apathetic, apolitical, or secretly counter-revolutionary, especially in regions where the Church still holds great power in the minds of the simple folk. The SR programme of municipalisation of land is generally viewed positively, as it means that all land is managed by the community, which distributes it to families, often in practice permanently.\n\nHowever, some economists, such as Sergey Dubrovsky, have pointed out that this kind of rural policy is very inefficient at actually mechanising and industrialising rural production, and larger farm units and commune farms would be needed. He and other communists advocate for larger farm units to 'rationalise' farming methods and grow the production numbers significantly. Some even wish to expand this policy to all of Russia, but it is obvious it would face massive resistance."
 socrus.64.a: "Ah, the rustic heart of Russia."

 socrus.65.t: "Zeller Quits the Workers' Coalition"
 socrus.65.d: "In front of the Congress Building, Gergard Zeller, leader of the SDS, announced his withdrawal from the Workers' Coalition and the government of [GetSecondInCommand]. He based it on the government's empty promises to enact his reforms and accused [ROOT.GetLeader] of 'getting too friendly' with the Bolsheviks.\n\nZeller ended the speech with the pledge of being a proper opposition that can negotiate when necessary and can strike down laws when necessary. However, should the government continue the current course, the SDS might start gathering a majority to dismiss [ROOT.GetLeader] and his government."
 socrus.65.a: "Capitalists in Workers' Clothing have shown their true colours."

 socrus.66.d: "In spite of events that caused Gergard Zeller and the SDS to leave the Workers' Coalition, recent measures taken by [ROOT.GetLeader] and his government proved to please the moderates. As such, following many legislations passed together with the SDS, Zeller agreed to return to the coalition and the government.\n\nAlthough there was internal opposition within both the SDS and the VST, the return was executed smoothly and the moderates were given back their previous roles."

 socrus.67.d: "Recently, press associated with the RKP(b) released a fiery interview with Yakov Sverdlov, who announced his withdrawal from the Workers' Coalition. He accused [ROOT.GetLeader] of counter-revolutionary policies that might steer the revolution back to bourgeois parliamentarism. Even though [ROOT.GetLeader] and [GetSecondInCommand] took most of the blame, Sverdlov sees the presence of elements like the SDS or the Danists as the main culprit of these actions. Soon after, all RKP(b) Ministers resigned, and the Bolsheviks not only moved to the opposition, but also began to boycott any voting or legislation that might have been influenced by the 'reactionaries'. From that point on, any meeting of the Congress had to end with at least one RKP(b) deputy removed forcibly from the building."
 socrus.67.a: "Didn't 1921 or the exile really teach them anything?"
 socrus.67.b: "We cannot let anger get a hold of ourselves, we need unity."

 socrus.68.t: "Bolsheviks Declare Support"
 socrus.68.d: "After recent votes, supported by the RKP(b) and a partial toning down of Zeller's ideas, Yakov Sverdlov agreed to rejoin the Workers' Coalition. In a joint statement with [ROOT.GetLeader], Sverdlov expressed his gratitude for the change in policies and promised to end his party's boycott within the Congress. Soon, the RKP(b) regained all previous Ministries, and the sessions of Congress were more peaceful.\n\nDespite initial opposition from the SDS, Danists, or even parts of the SRs, the Bolsheviks were warmly accepted back to the coalition."
 socrus.68.a: "Without us, what support do they even have?"

 socrus.69.t: "Fate of the Workers' Coalition?"
 socrus.69.d: "With each passing day, the carefully brokered Workers' Coalition seems like it is finally crumbling into ruins. In a statement, Maria Spiridonova explained that her party does not feel like a truly valued member of the workers' Workers' Coalition and that the peasants have been completely disrespected by VST policies. If this continues, she says, then the Workers' Coalition will simply not continue.\n\nCiting that previous points of agreement have been broken, Spiridonova offered that the Workers' Coalition could remain as before, but that it would have to essentially come with massive concessions to the PSR and their peasant base, so as to level the playing field as things were meant to be."

 socrus.69.b: "We will reign alone!"

 socrus.70.t: "SR Peasant Resistance"
 socrus.70.d: "Peasants under the PSR have been unwilling to cooperate with VST peasant policies.\n\nOrganisations like the Socialist-Revolutionary Peasant Union have offered quite sharp critiques, and they have rallied around Spiridonova to pressure us to reverse course."
 socrus.70.a: "They will obey bayonets."
 socrus.70.b: "We really need to fix this."
 socrus.70.c: "Peasants are just complainers."

 socrus.71.t: "Triumph of Peasant Communism"
 socrus.71.d: "Even if the VST does not have much love for what they see as the reactionary peasant class, our policies have thus far yielded fruit.\n\nPeasant organisations under the PSR have largely been cooperative with our policies, and over time, more of our own party is seeing the peasantry as a potential ally of the revolution instead of a threat."
 socrus.71.a: "Towards a better future!"

 socrus.72.t: "The Kamkovites"
 socrus.72.d: "Our relationship with the great SR party is anything but easy - but we make do. Support for the Esers is necessary, for our revolutionary government is too fragile to face both the White resistance and that of the Socialist-Revolutionary peasants.\n\nBut tactical support from the Socialist-Revolutionaries can also be used in other ways, as, with their votes in the Congress, we are not as dependent on keeping our own ranks united. In some matters, SRs make easier allies than our dear comrades in the Left.\n\nIn backroom negotiations, we have established a good working relationship with Boris Kamkov, the iron-fisted party secretary of the PSR and the man who largely runs the party, while Chairwoman Maria Spiridonova is more of a symbolic and ideological leader. Kamkov and his allies, like Vladimir Karelin and Nikolay Zdobnov, are committed to maintaining the unity of the Workers' Coalition, and are ready to give us supporting fire, should we need it."
 socrus.72.a: "One less front to fight."
 socrus.72.b: "Perhaps we want to sabotage the SRs instead?"

 socrus.73.t: "The Socialist-Revolutionary-Maximalists"
 socrus.73.d: "Not all Socialist-Revolutionaries are happy with Boris Kamkov's leadership. The Maximalists, a radical offshoot of the party, go back to pre-revolutionary times, and they were an ally of the Bolsheviks in the revolutionary war. They survived as a small terrorist group, and now they have grown again, essentially as a new brand of Maximalists, Esers who have all but given up on attempts at 'parliamentarism' and 'party politics'. While they do respect Spiridonova's leadership, they are trying to influence the party.\n\nA few secret deals with them, possibly through the well-connected VST member Ivan Gronsky, could bolster the Maximalists and allow them to undermine the current leadership of the PSR - and in turn, weaken them as an opposition."

 socrus.73.a.tt: "Improves the focus §YThe Charter of Russian Totalism§!."

 socrus.74.t: "Congress of the Unions"
 socrus.74.d: "It is easy to view Syndicalism as chiefly a French socialist development, but the truth is, Russia has a long tradition of syndicalism deriving from anarchism, going way back to Bakunin. Reactionaries such as Sergey Zubatov managed to discredit Russian labour unions greatly, but they have found new vigour after the purification of Leninists from Russia.\n\nTwo chief syndicalist theorists, Vsevolod Volin and Grigory Maksimov, both developed economic theories based on absolute workers' self-management, not making compromises to 'enterprise socialists' of the right, nor 'statist socialists' of the left. Maksimov's idea of 'workers' confederation' has many supporters, such as Shlyapnikov, Kollontay and even Tomsky, all united in the belief that the economy should be managed by those who work - not by bureaucrats, not by business-owners. Free unions, organised by workers, are both the workers and the experts in their own field. Thus, it only makes sense for them to make important economic decisions.\n\nTo put this into practice, the Congress of Labour Unions has been created to advise the Ministry of Industry and Trade in matters of policy, and to coordinate 'Trudoplans' created by the unions to develop their own regions. This body is fiercely independent from political control, and assists only in the role of economic management, trying to keep factional politics out of it."

But every time the VGPU turns their eye, these people are scheming with the White saboteurs, they are undermining socialist democracy, speaking against it and spreading slander about our government. It seems like peasants truly are the reactionary class, wholly incompatible with the future of the human race.\n\nThe worst incident yet, the rebellion of entire villages in the Transbaikal region was put down by swift intervention, but the resistance is never-ending. It seems like the only way forward is with unrestricted force."

 socrus.75.b: "Try to at least limit the terror."

 socrus.76.t: "The Consequences of Ethical Policies"
 socrus.76.d: "While the policies promulgated by Fyodor Dan and Rafail Abramovich initially proved to be popular, soon the problems those policies created began to rear their ugly heads. Political repression and censorship may sound undemocratic, but they are useful tools nonetheless. The lack of them leads to similar problems bourgeois democracies face - an unpunished opposition, especially counter-revolutionary opposition. Many rightist circles that survived the revolution began utilising the 'Danite Thaw' and quickly organised their own newspapers, publishing houses or discussion clubs.\n\nMoreover, our police force faces problems with keeping up peace in the country. While the reactionaries seem to be problematic to our regime, laws the Danists created make those actions legal. The police no longer knows what is a crime. Lower funding for security did not make the situation easier, and as such, the further you are from the cities, the more anarchic the state is."
 socrus.76.a: "The price of upholding our morals!"

 socrus.77.t: "The Consequences of Democracy"
 socrus.77.d: "With the creation of a socialist democracy, a question arose over how it should look. After all, it cannot be the same as the bourgeois parliamentarism that fell in Russia. Many within the Zinovyev's circle argued for his concept of 'Proletarian Hegemony', in which no reactionary, 'social svobodnik' or 'weak menshevik' force would be allowed to poison the workers' democracy. Obviously, this felt like an affront to the Danists, who felt that democracy cannot be restricted.\n\nAs such, by a compromise, many independents were allowed to run for local soviets or trade unions. However, as a shock to the Right and no surprise to the Left, in many rural regions those independents dominated the soviets and unions. Soon after the elections, Zinovyev accused many of those deputies of being secret Savinkovites, arguing over their silent support for Savinkov over the years. It did not help that various independent members of the soviets have opposed anti-clerical and other socialist policies on the grounds of 'freedom of conscience'. This caused a wave of fear in the Congress. Some put SR rural support into question, while others accused the SDS of secretly funding those candidates. More importantly, however, this event was yet another split in the already tarnished VST, turning out to be an embarrassment to Dan and his supporters. While Zinovyev, with Kamenev's silent support, called for the immediate imprisonment of those deputies, the Right initially remained silent, only to hold their decision and defend those reactionaries for the sake of democracy. The centre remains split on the issue and everyone is looking up to [ROOT.GetLeader] to make a solid decision."
 socrus.77.a: "This is how democracy is, whether we like it or not."
 socrus.77.b: "Social Svobodniks? Not in my Congress."

 socrus.78.t: "Marx Against Muhammed"
 socrus.78.d: "Even if the main enemy in our struggle against Gods is the arch-reactionary Orthodox Church, they are hardly the only one. Islam reigns supreme in many southern regions of Russia, among Bashkirs, Tatars and the Caucasian peoples. Many of these regions are deeply conservative and have been relatively self-managing during the republic, often allying with the establishment parties.\n\nNo more! The mosques are being closed by the brave workers, and the women are being de-veiled by the fervent Zhenotdel disciples. Naturally, this has sparked counter-revolutionary outrage, as religious leaders and so-called teachers claim that we are demolishing the very basis of their identity, and replacing it with hollow materialism. These regions are increasingly giving their support to the underground White movement. Only a few are involved in armed struggle - for the time being - but large groups of people are already involved in passive resistance, in protests and strikes, encouraged by the local community leaders."
 socrus.78.a: "No mercy for tradition."
 socrus.78.b: "Avoid alienating them any further."

 socrus.79.t: "The Committee for Defence of the Revolution"
 socrus.79.d: "The Congress is composed of bickering factions after both the right and the left wing separated into their own parties. Sulimov and his allies, holding firmly to the remainder of the VST - and most importantly, the executive power - are in power only because most of the Congress agrees that it is better than having no government. In particular, it is the support of the SRs that keeps Sulimov's government afloat, and he is very much aware of this relationship.\n\nAs war looms on the horizon, the Congress barely passed a decree creating the Committee for Defence of the Revolution, composed of Sulimov himself, a number of military commanders, delegates of each faction behind Sulimov, and multiple members from the Socialist-Revolutionaries. This body has broad powers to organise the arms industry, crack down on counter-revolutionary sabotage, and generally prepare the country for the coming war. The law is set to last for one year and needs to be renewed periodically until it is no longer seen as necessary."
 socrus.79.a: "We will do our best for the Motherland."

 socrus.80.t: "The Abolition of the Emergency Powers"
 socrus.80.d: "The Congress extended Sulimov's powers only as long as was necessary. Immediately after the war, it was clear that the Law on Defence of the Revolution would not be renewed, and many feared that Sulimov would refuse to relinquish power and possibly establish a dictatorship with the support of the military. To everyone's relief, he conceded - albeit begrudgingly, but he conceded nonetheless.\n\nWith this action, he went from a revolutionary dictator to an ordinary member of the Congress - albeit a deeply respected and influential one. He commands the loyalty of a large faction of the Congress and has a good chance of being elected the next Chairman, should he choose to run."
 socrus.80.a: "At last."

 socrus.81.t: "Elections in the Congress of Soviets"
 socrus.81.d: "Almost a dozen different candidates were put forward in the discussions on the next premier by the Congress, but ultimately it was clear that it was Sulimov's faction that would dominate the election, as they held over a third of the Congress, approximately tied with the SRs. In private, Sulimov had received multiple requests to serve another term, and was particularly popular in the younger generation of veterans. However, some others, such as his ideological mentor Vladimir Levitsky, had advised him to withdraw from high positions, lest he grow to love the power for its own sake, and forget his high ideals.\n\nAs Sulimov's candidacy is in the air, two other candidates have risen from the VST who might be able to dethrone him. Aleksandr Shlyapnikov served as the People's Minister of War Industry during the past years, and he positions himself as the candidate most likely to uphold the principles of democracy and avoid centralising power ever again, like Sulimov had done. Mikhail Tomsky, another trade unionist figure, comes from a similar background, but finds his support from many former Bolsheviks. He is more critical towards Sulimov and criticised the former Premier for 'Caesarist ambitions' and ignoring Soviet democracy during the war.\n\nEither way, neither Shlyapnikov nor Tomsky would have a particularly strong majority, and would in any case negotiate with the SRs to maintain a majority. Some might consider this a good thing - a weaker, more divided Congress acts as a safeguard against centralising power, after all."
 socrus.81.a: "Comrade Sulimov, your task is not done yet!"
 socrus.81.b: "Comrade Shlyapnikov is a fine successor."
 socrus.81.c: "Comrade Tomsky triumphs in the vote."

 socrus.82.t: "Comrade Dan's Departure"
 socrus.82.d: "Fyodor Ilyich Gurvich, better known by his pseudonym Dan, has announced his departure from politics. Dan is one of the founding fathers of Menshevism and has been involved in the Russian socialist movement since 1894. He was also the brother-in-law to Yuly Martov and Vladimir Levitsky, and in the tumultuous post-civil war years he remained as the bedrock of the Menshevik movement.\n\nDan has been tormented by ailing health for some time now, and has now offered his resignation from both the government and the party to the Premier. With the war looming on the horizon, he expressed concerns over his health and ability to lead properly, and did not want to weigh down the younger generation of Russian socialists. The announcement came as a relief to some, who had already been worrying about Dan's health and ability, especially as a potential wartime leader."

 socrus.100.t: "The Last Chapter"
 socrus.100.d: "Savinkov is dead, and his security apparatus is in shambles. Improvised People's Guards have control of the majority of cities and railways, supported by defected military units. There has been harsh fighting in places where Svobodnik loyalist officers managed to keep order. In Pskov Gubernia and Dvinsk, many peasants rallied behind the Svobodnik battalions, but they could only resist for a week. In the Kuban region, Ataman Krasnov and a large segment of local garrisons tried to organise resistance, but were stopped near Rostov. The Lipetsk-Oryol region saw some heavy fighting, as did Vologda, where local Svobodniks organised guerrilla resistance with loyalist peasants.\n\nRussia is bleeding, but it has only minor scars. The majority of people have welcomed the change of regime with apathy - after all, it cannot be worse than the SZRS. Some are even hopeful, and in cities especially, there has been great celebration. Thousands of political prisoners have been returned to their families. One by one, governors and generals are declaring loyalty to the provisional government, or at least announcing non-resistance to it.\n\nThe Vozhd is gone, and now the people are vengeful. Hundreds of SZRS party members and loyalists have been lynched or summarily executed by the People's Militias. Especially hated are the Svobodnik police officers, and so-called police murders have been rocking the nation. Men from Moscow's Workers' Union stormed the headquarters of the Okhrana, and director Klepikov was hanged from a flagpole. Even more people have been imprisoned and rounded up in improvised prisons, often literally turning prison guards into prisoners in their own camp. While much of the violence is no doubt deserved, it is still worrying how widespread these acts have become. What stance should we adopt towards the Svobodniks?"

 socrus.100.b: "Work will wash away their sins."

 socrus.101.t: "Besieged Kronstadt"
 socrus.101.d: "A worrisome standstill has been playing out in Moscow for days now. The Supreme Admiral Kolchak has not yet appeared to the people of Petrograd, instead remaining on his flagship, the General Alekseyev, anchored outside the city. The Baltic Fleet and the Kronstadt garrisons have not responded to communications beyond acknowledging them. The city itself is in control of the people - most of the Petrograd garrison were among the first units to switch sides and start arresting Svobodniks, who had never been particularly liked in the city.\n\nThe Old Admiral is no doubt seething over the fact socialists have risen to power again, but this time he seems to be very alone. Still, he is surrounded by loyal sailors, battalions of Naval Infantry, and is in control of a massive amount of firepower aimed at the heart of Russia. A heated debate sprang up in Petrograd about what to do - is Kolchak planning something? Are the counter-revolutionaries planning their move? Or is he simply genuinely confused, left with nothing but his fleet?\n\nFinally, the government delegated Petrograd's City Commissar to board the General Alekseyev and negotiate with Kolchak to turn over his fleet in exchange for a peaceful retirement with honours. On the ship, the old Supreme Leader of all Russia seemed like a grey husk of himself. He merely remarked that perhaps Russia and he have grown apart, and that he no longer knows his country. The worst fears of coup plans were unfounded, and the admiral was proven to be simply disappointed and tired. After some persuasion, he agreed to inform the government of his resignation, and expressed his desire to keep his chairmanship in the Council of Arctic Studies."
 socrus.101.a: "A catastrophe averted."

 socrus.102.t: "Through Struggle You Will Rise"
 socrus.102.d: "In 1918, Maria Aleksandrovna Spiridonova had declared to Lenin: 'Our movement cannot be destroyed, by you or any other temporary reaction, for it lives in the hearts of our people; it is hidden in the deep recesses of their minds. The revolutionary rebirth will surely occur under the banner of this ideal: the ideal of the liberation of the human personality.'\n\nAnd it seems as if this moment has finally arrived. As the Socialist-Revolutionary entered the Senate Palace in the Kremlin Fortress with her comrades, the moment felt unreal. After forty years of struggle - just as the Socialist-Revolutionary motto promised - they were finally in the highest position of Russia, without Lenin or bourgeois presidents to keep them down. From this fortress, thousands of socialists have been put to death, tortured and imprisoned - every one of the old Esers present now has experienced that. Is this finally the end of it, and the dawn of a freer Russia?\n\nThe office is messy, and its valuables have been looted by some SZRS bureaucrat who is probably halfway to Minsk by now. Sporadic gunshots ring in the streets of Moscow, but they do not seem to bother Comrade Maria Aleksandrovna too much anymore. Ironically, the years spent hiding from the Vozhd's Okhrana had almost reinvigorated the Esers, and made them remember their roots, their struggle. They lost to Lenin once, and Savinkov almost finished them off. They cannot afford to fail for the third time; too much blood has been spilt by the Russian people to achieve their freedom to stop now."
 socrus.102.a: "A brighter future dawns!"

 socrus.103.t: "The Direction of the Revolutionary Struggle"
 socrus.103.d: "At long last, the decades-long struggle for the party of the peasants to gain power has arrived - and, unfortunately, the struggle to govern shall probably last some decades more. The SRs may have the highest number of seats in the Congress, but they will still govern alongside the VST, whose vision of socialist Russia is vastly different from theirs: that of Western syndicalism and modernity.\n\nFor many, like Chairman-Minister Boris Kamkov, this is a fine and healthy compromise. Different ideals aside, the Workers' Coalition is still working towards the same end goal: a free and equal Russia. The brief yet disastrous Bolshevik rule over Russia is proof that a one-party state will only lead to ruin and authoritarianism. Socialist democracy can only work through the cooperation of Russia's left, or it will lead to much of the same.\n\nBut for other SRs, like Comrades Ustinov, Kolegayev, and Levandovsky, this is foolish and naive. Belonging to the Maximalist wing of the party, they despair at what they see as the defeatism and loss of true revolutionary sentiment in the party, which, in their eyes, has capitulated to bourgeois elements. The SRs are the true party of the peasants, who are the majority of the people in Russia - the first congress has shown the will of that people, and you cannot claim to be working on their behalf with shameful compromises. As it was always meant to be, the SRs shall guide Russia into its socialist and revolutionary future, and if the communists were to be cowed into submission to make it happen, so be it.\n\nWhile there was much shock at these sentiments, the party ended up more divided than once thought. The SRs could not face another Lenin who would usurp socialist democracy, so it had to keep the coalition - and yet, it could not face another Lenin who would destroy the peasants' Russia, so the coalition must be destroyed.\n\nChairwoman Spiridonova took no part in the debate. In the end, the prevailing mood was..."

 socrus.104.t: "Question of the Ministry of Industry"
 socrus.104.d: "With the final makeup of the Congress determined, it is expected that the positions for the Council of People's Ministers are to follow suit. As the latter is directly elected by the former, it is a guarantee that many of the positions will be filled by SR candidates.\n\nOf course, the VST has demanded seats in the executive council, and some in the SRs by no means desire to push the communists out - plenty of them are at least amicable to SR interests, after all. In particular, several candidates have been drafted as the holder of the Ministry of Industry and Trade. The most notable of these, hailing from the VST, is Stanislav Strumilin. Strumilin maintains a close relationship with Levitsky, who will probably be a valuable non-SR ally. That being said, his economic policy is planist and industrialist, and there is no doubt that he may come into conflict with the SR's own economic programme.\n\nOn the opposite side of the spectrum is Menshevik Aleksandr Finn-Yenotayevsky, who has a much more similar economic outlook to ours than the VST. His appointment would only neglect the Workers' Coalition, though, correct as his ideas may be. Perhaps the best option would be a compromise instead: Sergey Kirov, another Menshevik but one who is more aligned to the centrists in the VST in terms of economic policy, could work as such a compromise if we desire it."

 socrus.105.t: "On Security Matters"
 socrus.105.d: "It has still not been long since the socialist revolution swept Russia like a tidal wave. That is precisely the reason why the Ministry of Internal Affairs is so important: German agents, Svobodniks and other nationalist saboteurs will seek to bring us down at every opportunity, and public security is of utmost importance. The Ministry of Internal Affairs is responsible for the VGPU and the People's Militias, so it is just as important who will be the one to wield control over it.\n\nA rising star in the party and publicist, Nikolay Zdobnov has become the favoured choice of many in the SRs and the man Boris Kamkov endorsed for the position. Zdobnov's major works are in Russian history, and he has even gone into great depth with local Russian history in the Urals, Siberia and the Far East. Despite the dominance of the right wing of the SRs before the recent socialist revolution, Zdobnov was an active participant in trying to make the SR go back to its more left-wing roots, and was imprisoned by the Savinkovist regime for organising strikes. For those reasons, he is seen as a great martyr of the democratic socialist cause, and as someone trustworthy enough to have the position.\n\nZdobnov's challenger is Andrey Kolegayev, an attorney in the Maximalist wing who has gained a reputation as a defender of peasants even among those in the SRs. Kolegayev has little patience or desire for cooperation with the other socialists in the workers' coalition, earning him great favour among many hardliner SRs. It is for the same reason that many have been apprehensive about Maximalist control over the Interior Ministry - fears that it will be used against other socialist forces and destroy the coalition are not completely unfounded."

As an ex-Maximalist who now belongs to the left wing of the VST, Comrade Gronsky's goals continue to remain similar to ours - in particular, our steadfast dedication to the revolution that was swept away by bourgeois forces.\n\nAs an alternative to the perceived mood in the Congress, Ustinov and Gronsky have together published the 'Declaration of Organic Socialism', which dictates that petty disagreements between socialists must be swept aside. Questions of peasant and worker representation or other 'minute' issues only divide the socialist movement in Russia, which must be totally dedicated and united in providing to all labouring peoples.\n\nThe declaration is the first publication of the Russian Totalist Association, a literary and cultural organisation that, within time, will spread sufficiently revolutionary ideas to the masses. Currently, membership is small, but naturally, that will not last."

Its left-wing is particularly difficult to work with, but we may be able to cut a deal with the right and potentially centre. The leader of the right wing of the VST, Rafail Abramovich, believes in a gradual transition to socialism, like us, and would staunchly oppose any authoritarianism.\n\nMeanwhile, Levitsky, the leader of the centre and the party as a whole, is amicable to the Workers' Coalition, but he may not want to seem like he is capitulating to the Left-SRs. Reaching out to him would be riskier, but we would be getting more of the VST on our side. What should we do?"

 socrus.110.t: "Red Star over the Church"
 socrus.110.d: "The Orthodox Church remains actively and strongly hostile to the Esers and their allies and the feelings are mutual among the socialists. The arch-reactionary Patriarch Antony dominated the church of the Russian Republic for the last decade, and his influence was not scrubbed clean by his fairly recent replacement. Actively tied to reactionary politics, the Church was often the only state institution in many rural areas, owning schools, hospitals and the land alike. These assets are already in the process of being nationalised, and it is accepted that the revolutionary state will have to deal forcefully with the inevitable resistance from the Church. This suits both the Church and the Esers who would never imagine any cooperation between them, but the question remains of how to deal with the inevitable outcry from the peasantry, the base of the Socialist-Revolutionary Party.\n\nBesides the most advanced revolutionary section the peasantry has always been deeply religious. The decade of reactionary rule has not helped this. There is no desire to rob the peasantry of their religious spirit, but two options are openly discussed within the party. The first is to simply enforce the separation of church and state. This would mean allowing the peasants their local religion and parishes, cooperating with the non-Orthodox sects such as the Baptists, and repressing the resistance of the central Church and trying to make clear to the peasantry that the highest ecclesiastical authorities are acting against their interest while no harm is meant to the village priest. The other idea discussed arises from the hardliners of the party, and involves resurrecting the vision of Eser founder Viktor Chernov of socialism as a secular religion. The spiritual consciousness of the peasant should be appealed to on the basis of socialism as an elevated moral philosophy. The Eser intellectuals should be seen as apostles or saints of a movement guided by the higher ideal of social justice.

 socrus.111.d: "Russia's anarchists are few and far between but influential. Politically, they align with the Spiridonovists on some things - the vision of a decentralised Russia unites us both. For them, however, anarchism is less of an ideal to follow and more of an actual political programme.\n\nSome in the party may appreciate us reaching out to them, but perhaps we should not rock the boat too much for now."

That is exactly why the Spiridonovists' preferred man is Yury Sablin, who perhaps may not be the best officer, but someone we can trust to safeguard socialist democracy.\n\nPerhaps, in exchange for guarantees that he and his clique can remain in their position, they will join our democratic bloc."

 socrus.125.d: "Not long after the creation of the Russian Totalist Association, a certain Bolshevik quickly reached out to the Deputy People's Minister of Education, Aleksey Ustinov: it was Mikhail Frunze. Both men met at a cafeteria near the association's publishing house to exchange ideas. Frunze has apparently taken great interest in Ustinov and Gronsky's 'noble' goals. While he has not discussed this idea with the rest of his Bolshevik comrades, he has proposed that an alliance could be made between the Maximalists and the Bolsheviks. Many of our most skilled officers have Bolshevik sympathies or are part of the party themselves, and with Ustinov's help, those officers could move up the hierarchy and lay the groundwork for a viable 'path to power'.\n\nFrunze's offer is tempting, as difficult as it is to accept. Other Esers will certainly not receive a developing Maximalist-Bolshevik alliance kindly, and not only that, but we have no guarantee that Frunze solely wants power for himself. If we do accept his offer, we will have to ensure we come out on top of the deal first."

The Maximalists at the meeting included Aleksey Ustinov, Mikhail Levandovsky, Andrey Kolegayev, and Irina Kakhovskaya; on the opposite side from them were Bolsheviks Yakov Sverdlov, Mikhail Frunze, Martemyan Ryutin, and Aleksey Gastev.\n\nThe meeting is peculiar, as the SRs and Bolsheviks have never had good relations, but it seems that the Maximalists in particular and the Bolsheviks are more willing to come together than initially expected. It is not dissimilar to the cooperation seen from the Totalist parties in France, despite their clear differences. It was agreed upon that the Maximalists would help support the Bolsheviks politically and protect them from the suspicion of the SRs, while the Bolsheviks in return would support the Maximalists' position in the military. The most tense point of negotiations was the position of General Mikhail Levandovsky - with enough insistence, it was agreed upon that he would be the de facto head of the army. Other details would be figured out later - but for now, the negotiations are complete, and the alliance has become official: the Group for Defence of the Revolution."

 RUS_maximalist_bolshevik_alliance: "A §oMaximalist-Bolshevik Alliance§! has been formed"

 socrus.127.t: "The Great Pardoning"
 socrus.127.d: "A new order has been made by the Minister of the Interior, Nikolay Zdobnov, which has aimed to solve the 'overzealousness' of the chaotic security system at the onset of the revolution. It pardons a great number of people who were accused of counter-revolutionary activity shortly after the socialist revolution happened. The list included some liberal republicans as well as religious authorities who spoke out against the new regime but did not seemingly advocate for its overthrow outright or threaten public security.\n\nFor much of the Esers, such an order was a long time coming - after all, the courts have been greatly burdened by these revolutionary excesses. Yet, for the Maximalists, the actions of the Interior Ministry have only further proven that much of the party couldn't be less dedicated to the cause of true revolution. A meeting was held in Moscow in the publishing house of the Russian Totalist Association - present were the Maximalist rank and file, as well as some in the VST's left-wing and Bolsheviks. The recent actions of the Eser-dominated Congress were worrying enough, sure, but this may have put the nail in the coffin. To many in the room, it seemed as though the counter-revolutionaries were being let go, free to wreak havoc and destroy socialist Russia as they pleased. In the name of compromise and liberation, the Esers may have just signed their death warrant.\n\nSomething had to be done. While a few suggested that the reaction was overblown, others, in particular the Bolsheviks, claimed that the only way to save Russian socialism was a military coup - Ustinov, however, disagreed, believing the time was not right. VST member Gronsky jokingly mentioned that it would be ironic if one of the pardoned 'counter-revolutionary criminals' shot Comrade Zdobnov. When others replied he had a point, things became a little more awkward."
 socrus.127.a: "What should we do?"

 socrus.128.t: "The Wrath of the Counter-Revolutionary Criminals"
 socrus.128.d: "The time of day was [GetDateText]. The sound of gunfire was heard. Comrade Zdobnov was struck with two bullets and had fallen to the ground. Though advised against it by Officer Lev Vasilevsky, who warned for his personal safety, today Zdobnov went to give a brief speech at Resurrection Square in Moscow, right next to the Moscow People's University, where he had graduated from many years ago. Always having been popular with the students, and continuing to rise through the ranks of the Esers, it seems Zdobnov was all too eager to use that popularity to bolster the perception of the socialist-revolutionary cause. The price he paid for it was death.\n\nIn the midst, Comrade Zdobnov's guard shot the assailant, one Viktor Petrovich Ovchinnikov, who was reported dead sometime after he had been sent to the hospital. Once a Chekist during the Civil War, and imprisoned for it, after his release he began working odd jobs around Moscow. Overall, Viktor's record tells little about his political orientation and beliefs.\n\nNews of Comrade Zdobnov's assassination quickly made its way to the top echelons of government. Perhaps one of the most beloved Esers was dead, and the reason why was unclear. Comrade Gronsky's crude joke had become a reality - soon enough, the Esers' grieving had to be overcome. A formal reaction had to be made."
 socrus.128.a: "...we didn't do that, did we?"

 socrus.129.t: "A Way Forwards"
 socrus.129.d: "Chairwoman Spiridonova, Head of the VGPU Blyumkin, and the cabinet all held an emergency meeting together to determine who would succeed the now-gone Zdobnov. A number of candidates were brought forth, including Blyumkin himself; however, Blyumkin refused to take up the position, citing his current responsibilities. Still, he suggested that whoever the candidate is, it should be someone willing to get their hands dirty when necessary.\n\nMinister of Education Ustinov was hesitant. To him, it was clear that many of his Maximalist allies would serve as a great replacement, but being too open about it could perhaps raise suspicion from the rest of the Esers about the Maximalists' aims. After all, the Minister of the Interior is no doubt a powerful position, especially in these times.\n\nAs a temporary measure, Zdobnov's position has been taken up by his deputy head, but few believe it will be permanent. Most in the Cabinet acknowledge that the appointment of a hardliner will be necessary for the government to save face, but still, who exactly it will be is largely divided along factionalist lines.\n\nPerhaps any candidate can help save the socialist revolution - but only a very select few can help create the Maximalist revolution. And for that to happen, the Congress and cabinet must be nudged in the right direction."
 socrus.129.a: "A gate to the true revolution has just been opened."

 socrus.130.t: "Appointment of the Interior Ministry"
 socrus.130.d: "Far too much time has passed since Zdobnov's death, and finally, someone who can replace him has come to the forefront. The Chairman-Minister and Chairwoman have both been pushed to appoint a Maximalist to the position, and there is little concern among the Congress.\n\nThis is obviously a good step forward. The final question remains: who among the Maximalists will be appointed?"
 socrus.130.a: "Andrey Kolegayev, the man of the peasants, is the man for the job."

 socrus.131.t: "The Blyukher Report"
 socrus.131.d.maximalist: "With every passing day, the People's Minister of Military Affairs becomes more of a difficult cabinet position to maintain. Yury Sablin, who currently holds the post, has come under fire from the VST and Bolsheviks in particular. Now, accusations of Sablin's mismanagement of the post and incompetence have seemingly blown over into significant pressure to remove him.\n\nThat pressure would come in the form of an exposition on the status of the Russian military, dubbed the 'Blyukher Report'. Authored mainly by Bolshevik Vasily Blyukher and his allies, and including Maximalist Mikhail Levandovsky, the report states that there are plenty of competent officers able to lead the Russian military into better fighting shape, but politically motivated appointments have hurt its organisation. The report concluded that, at its current pace, the military will not even have returned to its pre-revolution fighting shape in a few years.\n\nThe report's alarmist nature no doubt played a small part in influencing the direction of the Congress - despite the hesitancy of some in the Esers, it quickly became known that Sablin's tenure would soon end. Still, another problem arose: who would replace him?"

 socrus.131.d.VST: "Initially, the appointment of Yury Sablin as the People's Minister of Military Affairs - the chief of army, essentially - was a political concession that was hard for [ROOT.GetLeader] to swallow. But it is true that very few in the military are true socialists, and even those friendly towards us prefer the Esers, whom they see as less radical and 'Red'. Thus, appointing Sablin in the early days of our new republic was a necessity to ensure the stability of the army.\n\nBut Sablin is an SR to the bone, and not particularly liked in the military command, either. A certain high-ranking Red commander described him as a 'bourgeois dandy, politician in military uniform', an insult that led to a small-scale political scandal within the Workers' Coalition. But now Sablin has truly come under fire, as Bolshevik Vasily Blyukher and a group of largely Bolshevik officers have composed an exposition on the status of the Russian military, dubbed the 'Blyukher Report'. The report states that there are plenty of competent officers able to lead the Russian military into a better fighting shape, but politically motivated appointments have hurt its organisation. The report concluded that, at its current pace, the military will not even have returned to its pre-revolution fighting shape in a few years.\n\nSablin's position is extremely tenuous now, and we must decide what his fate is."

 socrus.132.t: "The Next Commander-in-Chief"
 socrus.132.d.maximalist: "The Blyukher Report made a number of recommendations fit to be the next Supreme Commander of the Army. Among the names mentioned are the three Mikhails: Levandovsky, Frunze, and Tukhachevsky.\n\nOut of the three, Levandovsky is certainly preferred for us, as the appointment of a Maximalist to such an important position will no doubt prove extremely beneficial in the long term. Additionally, we can expect that there will be considerable support among the rest of the Esers, as, though most now recognise Sablin cannot be kept, Levandovsky is still an SR, and one with a more proven military record.\n\nFrunze would be an odd pick - a choice that may please few, besides the Bolsheviks and the VST's left faction. It would no doubt bolster our standing with the two, though, and would ensure that the alliances made through the Russian Totalist Association will not go to waste. It will be difficult to convince the rest of the Esers to go along with his appointment, though.\n\nTukhachevsky would certainly be a good and fairly uncontroversial choice. Estranged from the political factionalism that has developed in the military, and no doubt a competent general, few doubt his competence. Still, one must wonder if putting forth his candidacy would benefit us in the same way as Frunze and especially Levandovsky would. Can we really trust him when he has little care for the cause of true revolution?"
 socrus.132.d.spiridonist: "The Blyukher Report made a number of recommendations fit to be the next Supreme Commander of the Army. Among the names mentioned are the three Mikhails: Levandovsky, Frunze, and Tukhachevsky.\n\nOut of the three, Levandovsky is probably one of the better picks, as, though he is a Maximalist, he is still an SR, one with a more proven military record than Sablin.\n\nTukhachevsky would certainly be a good and fairly uncontroversial choice. Estranged from the political factionalism that has developed in the military, and no doubt a competent general, few doubt his competence, but some question if he is dedicated to the revolution as we are.\n\nLeaving out Frunze as too unreliable of a choice, we could extensively lobby for Sablin to keep his position, and try to make concessions in other areas to satisfy the Blyukher Report's recommendations."
 socrus.132.d.VST: "After the Blyukher Report, massive political pressure forced Yury Sablin to offer his resignation to the Congress. Immediately, backroom deals regarding his successor began. The SRs approached [ROOT.GetLeader] and argued that we have maintained the unwritten gentleman's rule that minister positions remain within the same party, to ensure stability and equality in the Workers' Coalition. They are suggesting Mikhail Levandovsky for the position as a prominent Left-SR general with a solid track record from the revolutionary war and partisan actions after that. Their secondary suggestion would be Aleksandr Yegorov - a former Red Army commander and a known professional with little interest in politicking.\n\nOur own would wish to see the position more firmly in the hands of the VST, which in practice would mean a Bolshevik. Mikhail Tukhachevsky is a name that came out obviously, as he is currently serving as the Chief of the General Staff, and is widely regarded as the brightest military mind of the Red Army. However, he is rather strong-willed, and would be likely to pursue his own mind, rather than serve our political goals. As the last candidate, we could pick a communist hardliner, such as Mikhail Frunze, who served as the commander of the International Bolshevik Brigade in the British Civil War, and is well-connected within military circles. However, he is also politically ambitious and would be the most controversial choice out of these."

 socrus.133.t: "The Doctrine of Integral Socialism"
 socrus.133.d: "The talk of the town today is a short publication by Maximalist leader Aleksey Ustinov, titled 'A Critique of Modern Russian Socialism'. The book provides some deep insight into the Maximalist ideology, something not often understood by the rest of the Workers' Coalition.\n\nTaking a page out of Lenin's works, Ustinov argues that, because of the fact that peasants comprise a large plurality of the Russian population, it is not solely the proletariat who can raise revolutionary consciousness, but the poor peasants as well. Together, they constitute one working class, one which will be able to successfully lead Russia to socialism in the future.\n\nThough Lenin had the right idea, he writes, the Bolshevik movement collapsed because they betrayed the poor peasantry. As for the current Workers' Coalition, which Ustinov extensively covers, he has no shortage of criticism towards it either. The interests of the PSR and that of the VST are intrinsically opposed. In the future, as partisanship and infighting will certainly increase, the coalition will naturally pull itself apart, and the workers' and peasants' Russia will collapse under its weight. Thus, the unity of the workers and peasants will be destroyed by the very coalition that sought to protect it. While both parties would be responsible for such an outcome, the brunt of the responsibility would certainly be on the VST. Many in the VST, in particular the Mensheviks, talk of a paternalistic 'labour aristocracy', in which the intelligentsia would lead the working class to socialism. Such an idea, Ustinov writes, is a vision similar to what ultimately brought the Bolsheviks down.\n\nIn the conclusion, Ustinov proposes how this 'inevitable outcome' could be overcome: without the inherently corrupting influence of unions and parties, workers' self-organisation will, in time, provide for a communist future."

 socrus.134.t: "Resistance of the Kamkovites"
 socrus.134.d: "At a recent meeting of the cabinet, the new Minister of the Interior, Andrey Kolegayev, explained that he had been drafting the 'Law on Counter-Revolutionary Activity'. He clarified that a stronger hand was necessary to prevent such incidents, like that of Zdobnov's assassination, from happening again.\n\nChairman-Minister Kamkov immediately became Kolegayev's opponent. Every time counterrevolutionaries committed an act of violence, would that be justification to create harsher and harsher laws to deal with them, eventually creating a police state much like the Bolsheviks tried to create? The crimes of the Cheka consumed millions of souls - is that the path we are going down again?\n\nIt was already suspected that Kamkov has never appreciated the Maximalists, but as long as they remained a minor faction within the Esers, they were going to be a nuisance at best. Now, one of them held a greatly important position in the cabinet, and it was difficult to tell whether Kamkov would tolerate it.\n\nWithout Chairman-Minister Kamkov's approval, the Law on Counter-Revolutionary Activity will have no chance of being put to a vote in the Congress. But it is no doubt necessary for it to pass... perhaps there is a way around this?"

 socrus.135.d: "Some time has passed, and the Law on Counter-Revolutionary Activity continues not to be put up to the Congress. To make sure it will be passed regardless of Kamkov's intransigence, the Maximalists took a huge risk.\n\nPublicly citing that they did not have trust in Kamkov's government, the Maximalist parliamentary group withdrew its support, leaving the former without a majority in the Congress. A new government had to be formed one way or another.\n\nThe Right-SRs had attempted to negotiate a deal with the VST's centre and right, but by thin margins, it failed. The SRs had found themselves divided between the Kamkovites and the Maximalists, but this time, the latter had momentum. By similarly thin margins, the Maximalists' gambit worked as planned. A Maximalist-Left VST-Bolshevik coalition, together with a great number of SRs who had little confidence in Kamkov, was able to be inaugurated.\n\nThe head of the Maximalists, and formerly just the Minister of Education - Aleksey Ustinov - was now to be named as the Chairman-Minister. And in the first of many steps towards saving Russian socialism, the Law on Counter-Revolutionary Activity was soon passed by the Congress."

 socrus.136.t: "Growing Suspicions"
 socrus.136.d: "Recently, several members of the party who had previously considered cooperation with the Maximalist cause out of dissatisfaction with the rest of the party suddenly backed away. This comes after a series of other minor setbacks that, while not of any significant note themselves, together prove that more and more members of the party are becoming aware of the true potential of the movement and are not pleased with it.\n\nThe worst of this so far are effects still easily dealt with by reshuffling minor positions and focusing on influencing rival party members instead. A task of some effort, but not substantially so.\n\nA few people complaining about it is not enough to pose a threat for now, but failure to keep it limited to only a few within the party will ruin any chance of the Maximalists being able to fulfil their ambitions and suffer the consequences."
 socrus.136.a: "Let us hope the rest remain unaware for now."

 socrus.140.t: "Expulsion from the Party"
 socrus.140.d: "A day has not gone by in recent memory where the Maximalist cause has been treated without scorn and paranoia from the rest of the party. Every action closely watched, every conversation listened in on, and every movement followed. Rumours about expulsion from the party have grown louder as the view of the Maximalists has shifted from annoying but useful to potential subverters of the revolution.\n\nOnly now, the long-dreaded day has arrived, as the newest party conference of the Socialist-Revolutionaries has come, and with it the chance for all attention to be focused on the Maximalist cause. Ustinov's attempts to distract the party with the threat of the counterrevolutionaries failed to capture anything other than scorn.\n\nThe Spiridonovists and minor factions began by unveiling and denouncing uncovered ties with the Bolsheviks, followed by a list of accusations of various crimes committed by the VGPU under the influence of the Maximalists, in addition to the ideological differences with the rest of the party. Consensus was reached quickly that all Maximalists were once more expelled from the party, this time to never return."
 socrus.140.a: "Two stages of revolution and two steps out the door."

 socrus.141.t: "The Socialist-Revolutionary-Maximalists"
 socrus.141.d: "Who are those who call themselves Maximalists? To some, they are a deviation from what the Esers really stand for, a clan of bandits and robbers. Look no further than 1918, where they followed the Bolsheviks in the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, while the rest of the party fought to keep Russia in the war against German imperialism. Still, they refused to stick with the Bolsheviks as differences in tactics and ideas began to diverge.\n\nOnce expelled from the party three decades ago, when the Tsar still reigned over Russia, they occupy a position within it today. Why? The Maximalists have garnered a certain reputation: as they had against the Tsarist occupiers, they committed acts of revolutionary terrorism against Savinkov's regime, and their followers were in the streets when the Svobodnik regime came crashing down.\n\nAnd for that, despite their small size, they are respected and feared. Unlike Chernov, who advocated a 'two-stage revolution', the Maximalists advocated for nothing less than full socialisation of all of the means of production. Their hardiness and stalwartness are comparable to the Ukrainian Borotbysts; in any case, they are persistent.\n\nBut while the Maximalist cause has survived and now occupies a small place in the Workers' Coalition, few can predict its future. They envision a radically different future than the rest of the party, who have little sympathy for them. Perhaps it will be forever relegated to a minor position within the Esers, or finally die out entirely.\n\nOr, perhaps, they will subvert the party from within. Only time will tell."

The gain will be offset by taking focuses on the §Yright side§! of your political tree."

 socrus.142.t: "In the Unity of Action"
 socrus.142.d: "The last party conference of the Socialist-Revolutionaries took place in Petrograd last week. The purpose of the conference was not to set forth a new political direction, but to mark the formal abolition of the party entirely. It is well-known by this point that political parties are inherently damaging to Soviet democracy, whether they be the so-called mass parties that the original PSR was, or a vanguard one like the Bolshevik Party.\n\nAnd thus came the end of the forty-year-long existence of the PSR. In its place was the Union of Socialist Revolutionaries (SSR). The Union is not a political party, but an organisation dedicated to raising class consciousness and bridging the divide between worker and peasant. While some have dismissed the transformation as a mere symbolic gesture, the reality is a lot muddier.\n\nUnlike the PSR, obtaining membership in the SSR is far more difficult; those who wish to join it must profess their faith in the Socialist-Revolutionary cause by both thought and action. The PSR held party members and leaders ranging from wise, toiling peasants and workers seeking to help their fellow man; and yet, over time, it was infected by useless pen-pushers seeking nothing more than a political career. The much more restrictive SSR, led by the Maximalists, should weed out this vermin.\n\nBut unlike what our critics claim, the SSR is far from a vanguard party. Those belonging in the SSR do not utterly dominate the Congress or even the local Soviets, and privately it is encouraged that membership remain somewhat small. In theory, the SSR is a workers' organisation like any other, seeking to further the revolution both in theoretical means and in practice. Still, the new constitution practically guarantees the dominance of the SSR's declared ideology."
 socrus.142.a: "This is how it always should have been."

 socrus.143.t: "In the Halls of the Kremlin"
 socrus.143.d: "The war is over. It was under the Socialist-Revolutionary cause that Russia was led to victory, with the Maximalists clearly being the most faithful servants of their cause. With the abolition of the Committee for the Defence of the Revolution, Ustinov's government has promised a return to normalcy - but one would be foolish to think that the new normal will look anything like it did pre-war. None of the counter-revolutionary criminals, especially those who sought to deny the victory of socialism against German imperialism, were spared by the law, and that is exactly how it should be.\n\nAnd indeed, things are bound to change. Today Premier Spiridonova stated her intention to resign and retire from politics as a whole; the mother of the peasants has certainly grown old and frail in time. Her retirement has been long foreseen by the PSR as a whole; since the Maximalist takeover she has been increasingly sidelined from both the party and the government, and seldom makes political comments.\nAs a result, Ustinov became the new Premier, with his faithful ally Kolegayev now heading the People's Council of Ministers.\n\nBehind closed doors, everyone is talking behind each other's backs: at last the illusions of unity have been forcefully ripped apart by the end of the war. The VST and Bolsheviks have been attempting to consolidate a united front against the Maximalists, but efforts to coordinate one have largely fallen apart. The moderates who remain in the PSR, too, have been cowed by the Maximalists, or at least prefer the Maximalist regime to the western Syndicalist alternative.\n\nThe time is ripe. Until now, we have turned the rotten institutions of the socialist republic on their head to create them anew, but they can be turned around just as easily. It is time we ensure that does not happen."

 socrus.144.t: "The End of the VST"
 socrus.144.d: "Grave news reached us from the head of the VPGU, Yakov Serebryansky: a coup plot seeking to overthrow the Eser government has recently been discovered. According to the uncovered documents, the intelligence agencies of [FRA.GetNameDef] and [ENG.GetNameDef] have been collaborating with the top brass of the VST - Vladimir Levitsky, Daniil Sulimov, Grigory Zinovyev, Lev Kamenev, and others - to stage a takeover of the Russian government, put a syndicalist system like that of France and Britain in place, and even ban the Esers altogether. Not all of the Western collaborators have been caught. Levitsky, along with Sulimov, have allegedly fled to the west and are organising there.\n\nLuckily, the police have moved swiftly, and many of those listed in this plot have been put on trial. They, as well as the French and British foreign ministries, are claiming that the evidence is forged, with the latter pressing our government to 'end the persecution of the Russian syndicalists'. Their claims shall fall on deaf ears: treason is a crime punishable by death, and it is exactly what these Western puppets have sought to do this whole time.\n\nIt was not long after that the VST was banned altogether. The accusations that the party held a number of foreign agents was enough ground; but their widely-known anti-peasant policies are in no doubt in violation of the constitution. The Western, syndicalist snake has finally had its head cut off."
 socrus.144.a: "Well deserved."

 socrus.145.t: "The Necessary Measures"
 socrus.145.d: "Russian socialism is on the brink. Together with its allies in the West it faces a challenge that, to many, seems insurmountable. The workers' republics are fighting together to put capitalism in its deathbed, but few expect anything less than tens of millions of casualties.\n\nHalf measures are unacceptable here, and every means will justify the end of German imperialism. And so, to coordinate every measure of the revolution against this threat, a vote was put up to the Congress. Proposed chiefly by Aleksey Ustinov, other Maximalists, and his allies in the VST-Left and Bolsheviks, the idea is to create a new body which will suspend many civil liberties and even allow the government to override the constitution, if deemed necessary. In practice, it will help us root out the fifth columnists who have always been waiting to betray Russia with German aid. It will also ensure that wartime production will reach its absolute peak to better destroy the imperialist war machine.\n\nIn the Congress, the new law passed with little issue. The Committee for Defence of the Revolution, as it is named, will be led by the head of government Aleksey Ustinov, with the Deputy Chairman being Mikhail Levandovsky. De jure, Spiridonova remains the head of state, but in practice the Committee now wields absolute and totalitarian power to run wartime Russia as it wishes.\n\nFor some this is the death of Russian socialist democracy. For us it is the beginning of true Soviet democracy, the one we have always fought for."
 socrus.145.a: "One final, cruel yet heroic battle for the liberation of mankind."

 socrus.146.t: "The End of the Civil War"
 socrus.146.d: "The Maximalists and Bolsheviks have been allies for quite some time: Frunze helped the Maximalists establish a foothold in the military, and in return, when Kamkov's government had fallen, the Bolsheviks were given positions in Ustinov's cabinet. Here the short-lived alliance of 1918 was rekindled.\n\nCooperation was not meant to last, of course - it was an alliance for alliance's sake. As expected, the top Bolshevik brass was apparently also involved in the Western coup plot. This alone was reason to convict them, but one cannot forget the Bolshevik crimes of the past.\n\nThe anti-peasant crimes of the civil war, the advocacy of a paternalistic 'vanguard party', the violence directed at our Eser brethren - all of it is more than enough to convict them. And convict them we did: those at the top of the party, including Mikhail Frunze, Yakov Sverdlov, and others, were all given the death penalty for treason and sabotage against the Russian Labour Republic. Sverdlov took his sentence calmly, while Frunze, enraged, repeatedly branded the Maximalists as always attempting to backstab and betray them. It is, of course, deeply ironic, considering the history of their party.\n\nAnd so, for the second time in a century, the Bolshevik Party was ripped to shreds, banished to total irrelevancy and doomed to certain collapse as its remaining adherents rot in the West. This time, it is not by the reactionary tyranny, but by the shining justice of Soviet democracy."
 socrus.146.a: "They served their purpose, I guess."

 socrus.147.t: "Constitution of the Russian Labour Republic"
 socrus.147.d: "Now wielding nearly supreme power in the Congress, the time has come to do away with the old and bring in the new. The [GetYear] constitution has been put into law, and a number of changes have been made to further rationalise and democratise the Labour Republic.\n\nA particularly infamous clause is that on the formation of political parties. The constitution states that the Russian Labour Republic is a socialist state for all of Russia's people - the workers, peasants, and intelligentsia, who constitute one singular working class. The formation of political parties that deviate from this fundamental basis - and seek to divide the toiling masses - is forbidden.\n\nThe pervasive influence of unions has also been diminished. Instead of the chaotic system where trade union federations have been at each other's throats for petty issues, all persons carrying out labour duties shall be divided into professions, who will join state-led unions relevant to that profession. Additionally, the old Congress of Soviets and Labour Unions has become solely the Congress of Soviets.\n\nOfficially, the overall political system remains relatively decentralised. Some in the Maximalist camp proposed that the new constitution should have outlawed political parties altogether; a noble goal, but it would be a decision that, for now, would surely drive many to the claws of reaction. Still, many of the Maximalists' ideological goals have been achieved - once just in practice, and now on paper."
 socrus.147.a: "A constitution by the working people, for the working people!"

 socrus.149.t: "Eyes to the West"
 socrus.149.d: "The facade of workers' unity is finally starting to disappear - without a common enemy, the once-great alliance between France, Britain, and Russia is falling apart. In the West, criticisms of the 'Maximalist regime in the Kremlin' are being published not only by the traitorous syndicalist exiles, but by mainstream Franco-British politicians and theorists. They all seem to want to make one thing clear: the Russian way of socialism is backward, incorrect, and even nonsensical.\n\nThis split between former allies was always going to happen. It is an unfortunate fact that the West perceives themselves to be superior to Russia - that they cannot fathom a world where Russia, the largest country in the world and a premier power in Europe, is considered equal to Paris and London. For, as much as the West claims to be lifting up the downtrodden and freeing the world from colonialism, in reality, they deny the place of the exploited and marginalise them.\n\nBut even besides this, Russia has a special place in the world. Moscow is the beating heart of the true revolution, where the wise word of the Maximalists was heeded and carried out. It is here where the unity of the working classes was realised, without the pervasive influence of competing political parties and unions. Here we have created true Soviet democracy. And no matter how superior the West pretends they may be, the syndicalist system is certainly doomed to collapse. Certainly, we wish for peace - but there will have to come one day when the false, bureaucratic socialism must be cast away.\n\nIndeed, the end of the Great Patriotic War has not produced a lasting peace. The free workers of the world must choose: which side are they on?"
 socrus.149.a: "We stand for true freedom!"

 socrus.150.t: "The Question of Cossacks"
 socrus.150.d: "The Cossack autonomies have been abolished, and the Cossack landowners have lost both their excess lands and their military benefits. To put it shortly, they are now normal Russians, Ukrainians, Turkomans, and so on. Obviously, this has not been taken well, and a sizeable part of the Cossacks have joined peasant protests against local socialist authorities and in many cases refused to give up their arms, leading to skirmishes with the Militia.\n\nThe loudest voices in the Workers' Coalition are calling for total De-Cossackisation, seeing the Cossacks as nothing but glorified reactionary policemen. They wish to conduct thorough investigations and imprison any Cossack leader with even a hint of past cooperation with Savinkov, Krasnov, Denikin, or any other butcher of the workers. It is clear that this would lead to the imprisonment of almost the entire ruling elite of the Cossacks, and as their lands were distributed to local minorities or Russian peasants, the Cossacks would become an even smaller minority in their former autonomies.\n\nOthers, seeing the situation as prone to explode, wish to postpone such measures to the future, and for now seek to create social transformation in the Cossack class. They would sideline the current Cossack leadership and promote those from a background more rooted in the peasantry, and encourage them to serve in the People's Militias and continue to serve in the republic's military, after first being given proper ideological training."
 socrus.150.a: "We cannot trust the Cossack."
 socrus.150.b: "They can change, like all of Russia."

 socrus.151.t: "1st People's Cossack Cavalry Corps"
 socrus.151.d: "As part of the rehabilitation of the Cossacks, those willing to pledge loyalty to the workers' government have been reorganised into a single cavalry corps, abolishing the earlier regional divisions of the Cossack forces and their own local Atamans, who were obviously wealthy and corrupt. The Cossack Corps is drawn from the common peasant and shepherd of the Cossack stanitsas, proving that there are good workers among them despite their poor fame. Obviously, ideological instructors have been attached to the corps to ensure proper socialist military education."
 socrus.151.a: "Arise, riders of Russia!"

 socrus.152.t: "Don Cossacks Declare Independence"
 socrus.152.d: "What would be known as Ataman Pavlov's Rebellion began in Novocherkassk, the former capital of the Don Host. Cossacks had lost their lands under socialist land policies, falling down to the level of ordinary Russian peasants. In addition, the traditional autonomy of their stanitsas had been replaced by elected Soviets; they had largely lost their privileges for military service, and in many Cossack regions, their deep religiosity had caused constant protests against secularisation. This all culminated in the twenty-year anniversary celebration of the Battle of Novocherkassk, where the red onslaught was stopped by the heroics of the Cossacks.\n\nThis celebration soon turned into a mass protest, as thousands of people gathered to remember the White movement and shout anti-socialist cries. The local People's Militia tried to control the crowd, but its members were attacked and imprisoned by an improvised White guard led by Stanitsa-Ataman Sergey Vasilyevich Pavlov. The situation escalated greatly as protests spread to Rostov, and more towns formed Cossack guards to disarm the Reds.\n\nThe Don Cossack Republic was declared in Novocherkassk, though they could not agree on the future. Some wished to maintain their own republic, while a portion wanted to petition the Ukrainian government to join them. All in all, they elected the young and charismatic Pavlov as the leader of the reborn 'Don Army', meant to defend the freedoms of the Cossack peoples. Proper military forces have been sent from [217.GetName] to reinforce the local military district and to crush the uprising."

 socrus.153.d: "Emboldened by the resistance of the Don Cossacks, many White resistance groups in the Yekaterinodar and Novorossiysk region have started open resistance. Battles between improvised White forces, bombings, sabotage - army units loyal to us have been encircled in a sea of hostile countryside. The Kuban Liberation Army, led by retired general and reactionary Andrey Grigoryevich Shkuro, has shown respectable military skill, and in its ranks, there are many former military personnel who have both the skill and knowledge to wage war in the Kuban region.\n\nThe most pessimistic views in Moscow fear this as the beginning of a civil war, but such fear is likely overstated - aside from isolated incidents, the rest of Russia is largely apathetic to this 'Cossack Cause' or unwilling to take the risk. Readiness levels have been increased everywhere, and pre-emptive arrests of known dissidents have been made by the VGPU. But there is much to do to restore order in the heart of the uprising."

 socrus.154.d: "After a lengthy military campaign in the Don-Kuban region, the Cossack insurgents have been slowly whittled down into disconnected bands of rebels without military cohesion.\n\nSome of these 'doomed men' still continue fighting in distant woods, but after the execution of Ataman Pavlov in the field, the majority of the rebels have laid down their arms or fought to the death. 'Ataman Pavlov' has faced summary execution, but the question remains of what is to be done with his followers."
 socrus.154.a: "Start trials and mass deportations."

 socrus.155.t: "Pavlov's Rebellion Dies Down"
 socrus.155.d: "The Pavlovite Rebellion has been waning in power as Ataman Pavlov's support among the populace has been diminishing. Both due to military setbacks and our propaganda work among the Russian peasantry in the region, Pavlov's men have suffered from defections and poor morale.\n\nYesterday's skirmish in Chepiginskaya was their final battle. General-major Lev Dovator's was able to corner the rebels against Lake Lebyazhy and decimate most of their force. Ataman Pavlov himself was badly wounded and died soon after in captivity, and around a hundred rebel officers have been captured, destroying the main group of resistance."
 socrus.155.a: "Deal with the rebels mercilessly."
 socrus.155.b: "Deal with the rebels fairly."

 socrus.157.t: "The Caspian Hosts Restless"
 socrus.157.d: "As their western brothers are taking up arms, the Hosts deeper in the Caucasus, such as the Astrakhan and Terek Cossacks, have grown bolder too. A visible centre of resistance has risen in the mouth of the Volga, where Ataman Danzan Davidovich Tundutov has rallied the Kalmyk Cossacks into a fighting force. In the vast steppe north of the Caspian Sea, quick-moving cavalry forces have started to harass railway and telegraph connections and ambush militia forces.\n\nHowever, the region is not nearly as rebellious as the Don and Kuban, and Ataman Pavlov is not as broadly supported. These more distant Hosts have been more peaceful in general, as they are without the ability to rely on neighbouring Ukrainian and German forces to help them. Sending too much force against the Kalmyks would likely lead them to join the resistance more clearly, but not doing so will undermine our control in the region."
 socrus.157.a: "Local militias can handle it."
 socrus.157.b: "Send in military units."

 socrus.158.t: "Proposed Don-Kuban Expedition"
 socrus.158.d: "The insurgency in the Don-Kuban region has been something between war and peace for a time now: the Pavlovite rebels are not able to control territory in a traditional way, but their mobility, support of the populace, and remarkable military skill have made them an elusive shadow for our military to catch. As the villages and farms burn and increasingly draconian measures are being applied, a greater military intervention is needed.\n\nGeneral Vasily Blyukher has been appointed to handle the insurgency with the full strength of the Workers' Army. Blyukher - well-versed in guerrilla warfare - has drafted a plan that would flush out the rebels with a campaign of might and terror."
 socrus.158.a: "March in bold and crush them."

The Cossack insurgents have pledged loyalty to General Boldyrev's forces, and Ataman Pavlov has been made a general of the Free Russian Army.\n\nThis defection has led to a broader uprising against us in Southern Russia, which is only barely contained by the People's Militias."
 socrus.159.d.rsa: "The brave Cossack insurgents against socialist rule, led by the now-famous Ataman Sergey Pavlov, have contacted our forces and requested to join our cause.\n\nPavlov wishes to be made a general of the Free Russian Army, and wishes confirmation that the new, free Russia will maintain freedoms for Russia's Cossack class. In exchange, he pledges his forces into our service."
 socrus.159.a: "Curses."
 socrus.159.b: "Admirable!"

 socrus.161.t: "The Spiridonovist Manifesto"
 socrus.161.d: "Not long after the elections to the Congress, Premier Spiridonova made an emotional speech outlining the future of Russian socialism. She claimed that the political revolution had arrived in its fullest in Russia, but that the social revolution was yet to come.\n\nWhat was to be of this social revolution? The soviets must take power into their hands and implement laws, she said - without people's self-organisation, the government will not be able to save socialism now or in the future. The ultimate goal of the Workers' Coalition is to lay the groundwork for that self-organisation. However, she explained, these developments must be careful and controlled, so as to ensure Russian socialism never backslides into Bolshevik chekism again.\n\nThe Matushka's words have been echoed across the Esers, but only a select few are truly dedicated to it. Those calling themselves 'Spiridonovists' - including Boris Kamkov, Vladimir Karelin, Ilya Mayorov, and others - have fully committed themselves to her vision in the 'Spiridonovist Manifesto'.\n\nSome have already decried the Spiridonovist Manifesto as a political move designed to divide the Esers rather than unify them. Let us not falter: while they criticise us at every turn, we will work tirelessly towards the second stage of the revolution."

 socrus.162.t: "The Siberian Direction"
 socrus.162.d: "Siberia is many things. Historically, it has been a stronghold of the Esers, particularly the right wing of the party, yet for the socialists and Left Esers, the region has somewhat escaped them. The traditional base of the Left Esers has been the poorest peasants in European Russia, but in general, we have sought to be the party of all Russians - not just urbanites from Moscow.\n\nTo fulfil that goal in practice, some - including the Minister of Internal Affairs, Nikolay Zdobnov, who has specialised in historical studies of the region - say that we need to build a comprehensive programme to develop the region. The average Siberian peasant is well off, but they lack the means to seriously improve their futures, as opposed to the toiling peasants of rural European Russia. It would be a wise move politically to reinforce the fact that we are a people's party first and foremost, and reassure the Siberian populace of it."
 socrus.162.a: "Sounds good!"

 socrus.163.t: "Complaints of the VST"
 socrus.163.d: "The 'pivot towards Siberia' was criticised in a joint statement by numerous VST politicians, including Grigory Zinovyev, Lev Kamenev, Stanislav Strumilin, and others. The common complaint is that it is not only a massive waste of resources, which do not adequately contribute to Siberian industrial potential, but that it is a shameless ploy by the Esers, in particular Zdobnov, to win Siberian votes and play favourites.\n\nPerhaps it might be a good idea to limit the scale of the programme to silence some of their criticism, but at best, their shouting may be little more than a minor annoyance."
 socrus.163.a: "Make token concessions."
 socrus.163.b: "No point in listening to them."

 socrus.164.t: "The Rise of the Maximalists"
 socrus.164.d: "Today marks the beginning of the so-called 'Russian Totalist Association'. It is founded by one of our own - the Maximalist Aleksey Ustinov, and his partner from the VST's left faction, Ivan Gronsky. In their 'Declaration of Organic Socialism', they have criticised what they see as 'shameless compromises' which will, in time, degenerate the workers' state. While not explicitly calling for a totalitarian dictatorship, in practice this is exactly what they seem to want - at least until the revolution can be secured more thoroughly.\n\nFrom the looks of it, the Maximalists do not seem content with being on the sidelines anymore, and are further distancing themselves from the Esers. There may soon come a time when disagreements between comrades of the same party become disagreements between bitter enemies."
 socrus.164.a: "Keep an eye on Comrade Ustinov and his Maximalists..."

 socrus.165.t: "The Tambov Project"
 socrus.165.d: "To show that the Spiridonovist faction of the SRs is not simply a group of out-of-touch idealists who are unconcerned with the realities of practical governance, we need to be able to put at least some of our ideas into action.\n\nIlya Mayorov has been devising a detailed plan just for this, and has submitted it to the Congress for approval. It envisions the implementation of 'peasant communism' in the Tambov region, calling for a great devolution of authority in the region, mass agricultural mechanisation, and education programmes, that will serve to both modernise it and give a great amount of freedom to the Russian peasantry.\n\nWhile the endeavour will be costly and take some time, we can show what good the Esers do if we succeed."

 socrus.166.t: "The Romantic Esers"
 socrus.166.d: "While both the Spiridonovist and Maximalist factions of the SRs dominate the conversation, one cannot forget that they are small, despite their increasingly disproportionate influence over the rest of the party. Unified on a vision of the future, there remains great disagreement on how to get there.\n\nFew represent this clash better than Isaak Steinberg. On the surface, he would fit right in with the Spiridonovists, believing in a great devolution of authority akin to anarchism, with the eventual destruction of the state and direct democracy. At the same time, like the Maximalists, Steinberg lacks faith that the Workers' Coalition will be able to fulfil this goal, at least in its current iteration.\n\nAs one of the most influential Esers with a rather large following despite his radical ideas, his allegiance may set the course for the rest of the party for the future. Informally, Steinberg's followers constitute a faction of their own - the Romanticists - who will not accept half-measures and compromises to accomplish their vision, while still condemning the authoritarian rhetoric of the Maximalists. Only through an uncompromising resolve can we show we are capable of setting up the Socialist-Revolutionaries to be the party of future Russia, and not just another member of the coalition."
 socrus.166.a: "Potential allies..."

 socrus.167.t: "Party Conference of the PSR"
 socrus.167.d: "The annual conference of the Party of Socialist-Revolutionaries took place in Moscow today. As usual, a number of issues were discussed, though this occasion was special. As coordinated with the West, the Anti-Capitalist War is expected to begin within the next year, so militarisation was of the utmost importance. A French delegate was sent to the conference to observe and assist the SRs in their efforts.\n\nIn the end, they widely agreed on a vague declaration to 'further the defensive actions against German imperialism and the good of socialism', and placed this as the priority of the Russian nation for the near future. As such, domestic issues were to take somewhat of a backseat, and counterintelligence against the reactionary threat was emphasised in particular.\n\nHowever, for the latter part of the conference, the matter of the party's composition was taken up. In it, the rising star Nikolay Zdobnov was given the spotlight. While the Esers have not failed to win the minds of the people, he mentioned, a wave of optimism has washed over the party - somewhat to its detriment. Indeed, more optimistic timetables for ambitious reforms have not been met, and the SRs cannot claim to be a dominant force in the Congress.\n\nYes, the Esers must look to the second stage of the revolution eventually, where the Workers' Coalition may not be necessary and true worker's self-organisation is achieved. But for now, this is a distant future, and only through a careful and controlled approach will Russia reach it. For now, that approach will be through the Workers' Coalition, the cooperation that has served Russian socialism well so far.\n\nZdobnov's speeches were somewhat of a thinly veiled critique of Kamkov's idealistic reforms, but in the end, he was able to win over much of the party. Allied with Vladimir Karelin, who took leadership of the party, Zdobnov was in a prime position to assume a stronger position than before, and will undoubtedly leverage it in the future."

The initial years were looking as though the Esers may have to work tirelessly through the constraints of the Workers' Coalition - and while the work was tiresome, many of the optimistic timetables and goals have been met.\n\nKamkov's position as the head of government, and of the party in general, was mostly solidified. Perhaps the fated second stage of the revolution was to be soon - but soon, the greatest civilisational struggle, of workers and peasants against capitalism and imperialism, was to take place.

 socrus.169.t: "The Future of the Workers' Coalition"
 socrus.169.d: "The former chairman of the VST, Vladimir Levitsky, has recently been elected as the Chairman of the Congress of the Union of Socialist Labour Republics. While a noteworthy position to have, Levitsky has in practice taken a backseat in domestic Russian politics. It was not long after the war had ended that Levitsky proved unable to reconcile the left and right of the VST, and so he ultimately chose to resign as chairman of the party.\n\nRafail Abrahamovich, leader of the VST's right, took his place in an extremely tight vote. He, too, could not prevent a party split: Zinovyev and other communists decided to form their own party, the Russian Communist Workers' Party (RKRP).\n\nWith the VST weakened and dominated by moderates, the groundwork for closer cooperation has been laid. As was the case in the past, the PSR and VST still compete over rural and urban interests, but it seems that both parties have agreed on a steady transition to socialism through societal progress. Zinovyev and his allies have emerged as the antagonists of the system, but remain too small to influence it in a meaningful enough way.\n\nDespite Maximalist predictions that the coalition would naturally pull itself apart, instead the postwar situation has emerged as a healthy cooperation between the workers' parties. The PSR and VST, despite occasional clashes, have deepened their friendship, and the groundwork is already being laid for a future where neither need to exist for socialist democracy to continue."
 socrus.169.a: "Nothing is impossible as long as we can still work together."

 socrus.170.t: "The New Parties"
 socrus.170.d: "With the war over and European socialism secured, it no longer seems a necessary practice to persecute parties of the old order - of course, the most reactionary organisations will remain banned, but many new parties seem willing to cooperate with the way things are.\n\nOne of these parties is the All-Russian Social-Christian Union (VSKhS), led by Sergey Lukyanov. Though accepting of the socialist status quo, it advocates for more socially conservative positions and has lobbied the government for increased ties with the Orthodox Church.\n\nInheriting its legacy from the Kadets is another new party, the aptly named New Constitutional Democratic Union. While also accepting of the socialist status quo, it has staunchly opposed any shift leftwards, and has called for the PSR to further moderate its economic programme so as to give freedom to the Russian people.\n\nMany of these new parties are small and only have influence on the local level. Additionally, it stands to reason that with the government also enjoying the support of some Right-SRs, the status quo may remain for some time. However, it could be said that these smaller parties are thankful towards the PSR - they are only legal because of them, and there is no doubt that under a VST government they would still face greater persecution."

Her health had already been ailing during the war, and she had been slowly withdrawing from political life. Her last position, the Premier of the Congress, was essentially a symbolic head of state, largely ceremonial. But now even that has passed forward, as Spiridonova and her husband Ilya Mayorov expressed their plans to retire to the Tambov countryside.\n\nIn Spiridonova's last session of the Congress, Deputy Chairman Steinberg held a speech in her honour, citing her earliest words that 'have guided countless revolutionaries towards the moment we all live now'. Spiridonova, while expecting a death sentence in 1906, wrote: 'I understand belonging to the Social-Revolutionary Party not only as unconditional acceptance of our programme and tactics, but to a much fuller degree. In my opinion, it means to give your whole life, all the thoughts and feelings for the realisation of the party's ideas; it means to have nothing outside of the party's interests and its ideals; it means to live each minute of your life towards the cause'.\n\nAnd now, despite all odds, that cause has been finally reached. A small farewell event was held in Moscow the next day among friends of Spiridonova before she, Ilya, and her stepson Lev left for southern Russia. They already had a dacha some miles away from Tambov, where Mayorov would work as a teacher in a local agronomical school. It was hoped that the countryside air would improve Maria's health and that she could enjoy many long years in the new, people's Russia she had achieved through endless hardship."

 socrus.174.t: "A Devolved State"
 socrus.174.d: "Chairman-Minister Steinberg's ideas are by no means orthodox, but in the environment that socialist Russia finds itself in, they are slowly becoming mainstream among the Esers. With European capitalism destroyed and reactionary terror subdued, it seems no longer necessary to maintain a large standing army, and all the more funding can be directed towards the people.\n\nIn practice, it means that unprecedented prosperity is ahead for the everyday Russian, and that every measure to secure their freedom is warranted. Steinberg's ideas of a direct, decentralised democracy are seemingly being heeded greatly; increasingly economic matters have been delegated to artels and cooperatives, while the Ministry of Industry and Trade has diminished in importance.\n\nAdditionally, at the latest conference of the PSR, it was agreed by a slim majority that two goals of the party were the eventual abolition of partisanship and parliamentarianism, and the destruction of the state itself. No strict timetable was given for such occurrences, however, and informally it is said that the Esers will know when the time is right.\n\nStill, some question the further shift leftwards. The VST has levied criticism at the supposed inefficiency of the Chairman-Minister's proposals, while others have bemoaned the Esers' advocacy of what is basically an anarchist system. For the Spiridonovists, however, and especially Steinberg, the past years and current conditions have shown that the conditions are perfect for the second stage of revolution."

 socrus.175.t: "An Eser Ascendant"
 socrus.175.d: "Few can deny now that the Esers are the party of Russia. They have come in many forms: the Right, who cooperated with the Kadets and other bourgeois parties in the 1920s, and the Svobodnik, who tried to put Russian democracy in its coffin. In the end, it was the left socialist-revolutionary who stood at the top.\n\nAnd for the Eser, nothing is impossible anymore. The Workers' Coalition has stayed intact, but as time goes on, it seems to be more and more of a relic of the past, a time when things were harder. Popular support for the PSR and its proven track record have made it an unstoppable force, the undisputed leader of the coalition. At the same time, the VST is tearing itself apart: its left-wing has formed a new party altogether, the Russian Communist Workers Party (RKRP), while the right has taken up the mantle under the leadership of Rafail Abrahamovich. What remains of the VST has essentially become a satellite of the PSR, unable to contest its senior outside of certain urban localities.\n\nWith this transformation has come a number of difficulties. No longer is the PSR simply a party of the rural peasantry, of Russia's disaffected, but of Russian socialism in general, having become a people's party in every sense of the word. Whether that will only enable it to greater heights or enable it to be infiltrated by those alien to socialism remains an open-ended question."

 socrus.176.t: "Those Who Rose Up"
 socrus.176.d: "What is to be said about the revolution?\n\nFor the peasant, revolution spelt bread, peace, and freedom from the tyranny of the landowner. For the dreamer, revolution spelt spiritual freedom, human rights, and justice for all.\n\nBut the revolution was more than just freedom for the peasant, for the dreamer. It was a moral and spiritual awakening, a regeneration caused by the most important emotion of all: love. The revolutionist by love does not pity those who suffer, does not seek to become the master of he who suffered, but had in his heart deep love for his people and truth.\n\nAnd that is the tale of the Socialist-Revolutionary."
 socrus.176.a: "For the sake of love, they gave up their lives."

 socrus.177.t: "The Eternal Revolutionary"
 socrus.177.d: "Europe has been freed, but at a great cost. What motivated the Russians to liberate not only their Belarusian and Ukrainian brothers, but even those who hated the Russians, like the Poles and Germans? For them, it was compassion, compassion for their fellow man who languished under capitalism and imperialism.\n\nSome say that it was never worth it, that all of the blood shed to achieve European liberation shows that the ends could never justify the means. And besides, has Russia not become a slavemaster of Europe in its own right, with that compassion for their fellow man having turned into condescension, into pity that conceals a new tyranny over the oppressed European people?\n\nPerhaps one could see it that way. But we will never throw in the towel at such challenges. The revolution has been soaked in blood, but those who remember the feelings that inspired it will know that it was out of compassion. And one day, that compassion will not turn into pity, but love for their fellow man."
 socrus.177.a: "Through struggle, we will gain our freedom."

 socrus.178.t: "Eyes to the Far East"
 socrus.178.d: "Capitalism in the Old World is reaching its deathbed, but some reactionary powers remain. The Empire of Japan is the supreme imperialist of the Orient, and unlike our German enemies, we have yet to settle the score with them.\n\nIt is certainly enticing to begin military operations to destroy Japanese imperialism for good - after all, with the backing of Europe, Russian success is practically guaranteed. But with the possibility of such an operation being long and arduous, and the promise of a postwar peace still resonating among the Russian people, there remains some hesitancy.\n\nThe Foreign Ministry has taken the position that there is no need to force the issue, at least for now. The aftershocks of the Great Revolutionary War have yet to be fully realised; all across the world the reactionaries are waking up to a reality where they no longer control the worker's fate. What approach the capitalist states will have to the new order is not fully known, though in certain countries, including Japan, the red scare has reached unprecedented proportions.\n\nSuch actions will only doom their collapse, however, and certainly one day the workers and peasants of Japan and Korea will rise up, eager to overthrow the vestiges of the old order."
 socrus.178.a: "We await the day it happens."

 socrus.179.t: "A Ukrainian Legacy"
 socrus.179.d: "The Ukrainian republic has a controversial legacy, to say the least. When the Great Revolutionary War broke out and the first Ukrainian cities - Kharkiv, [227.Controller.GetVictoryPointName_6474], and Luhanske - were liberated, the already divided Ukrainian left had yet another contentious issue on their hands.\n\nFor their part, Ukrainian leftists were mostly united on one goal: the destruction of the German puppet regime in [202.GetName]. Some, however, were only lukewarmly appreciative towards the Russian liberators. Those still believing that Ukraine could become socialist through parliamentarism expressed doubt that a Moscow-directed regime could provide the adequate conditions for socialism.\n\nSince Ukraine's liberation, the Borotbysts and the Council-Revolutionary Bloc have operated in a dual-power conundrum, much like the Workers' Coalition of the PSR and VST here in Russia.\nBut it's no secret that, amidst the excitement and celebration at capitalism's demise in Europe, many Ukrainian socialists have been left disappointed. Contrary to the government's message that Ukrainian socialism is being built by the peasants of Volyn and workers of Kharkiv, the reality is bleaker, with some even saying that the new Ukrainian republic is no more free than it was under the German slavemaster.\n\nUkraine still lies in ruins, a painful reminder of the destruction of the Great Revolutionary War, and its people are wary. Will the Ukrainian people ever come to accept the socialism that, to them, came at gunpoint and trampled over their cities and farms? It is unlikely, at least in the near future."
 socrus.179.d2: "The Ukrainian republic has a controversial legacy, to say the least. When the Great Revolutionary War broke out and the first Ukrainian cities - Kharkiv, [227.Controller.GetVictoryPointName_6474], and Luhanske - were liberated, the already divided Ukrainian left had yet another contentious issue on their hands.\n\nIndeed, the National Zbory of the Ukrainian People's Republic hosted a fair share of socialists, concentrated in the Council-Revolutionary Bloc (R-RB) and the Ukrainian Party of Socialist-Revolutionaries (UPS-R). Both parties had made a general commitment to create socialism from within, and stuck to this goal despite their electoral defeat in 1937. Unsurprisingly, the Russian incursion into Ukrainian territory had extremely mixed reactions. Some, like the Borotbysts, had already made their distaste for the 'bourgeois people's republic' clear, and did not hesitate to collaborate with the Red Army as soon as it set foot on their soil.\n\nFor others, it was more complicated. The chairman of the UPS-R, Nykyfir Hryhoriiv, stalwartly refused any offers to participate in the new regime, stating that Ukrainian socialism must be built from the hands of the Ukrainian peasantry, not bureaucrats from Moscow. Like fellow party member Pavlo Khrystiuk, he has chosen to remain in his homeland despite his criticism. The same cannot be said for Mykola Kovalevskyi, informally the leader of the UPS-R's moderate faction, who emigrated to Paris and has been writing criticisms of the 'Moscow-directed government' ever since.\n\nThe R-RB has been more conciliatory towards the new order, with Chairman Vynnychenko having ultimately ended up in the position of premier. For some time now, the Borotbysts and the Council-Revolutionary Bloc have operated in a dual-power conundrum, much like the Workers' Coalition of the PSR and VST here in Russia. But whether the Ukrainian left will ever reconcile and accept the new free Ukraine remains an open-ended question."
 socrus.179.d3: "The Ukrainian republic has a controversial legacy, to say the least. When the Great Revolutionary War broke out and the first Ukrainian cities - Kharkiv, [227.Controller.GetVictoryPointName_6474], and Luhanske - were liberated, the already divided Ukrainian left had yet another contentious issue on their hands.\n\nThose seeing the Maximalist Russia as liberators quickly rose to prominence. At first, a coalition government of all Ukrainian socialists, one that would remain for the wartime, was put into place. But as Ukraine settled in, [202.GetName] seemed to follow the legacy of Moscow. Socialists in the R-RB or UPS-R were quickly sidelined as the Borotbysts began to consolidate power, a process largely on the Kremlin's orders. The Borotbysts and Maximalists share much in common - a narodnik heritage, commitment to terror as means of bringing down reactionaries, and an agrarian outlook. Despite the alliance between the two, however, it is well known that this relationship is rather troublesome. Many prominent Maximalists have shown disdain for the Borotbysts' affection for Western socialist ideas, showing that the possibility that the Borotbysts will be replaced is not out of the question."

 socrus.180.t: "Duties of the Revolutionary"
 socrus.180.d: "'The nature of the true revolutionary excludes all sentimentality, romanticism, infatuation, and exaltation. All private hatred and revenge must also be excluded. Revolutionary passion, practised at every moment of the day until it becomes a habit, is to be employed with cold calculation. At all times, and in all places, the revolutionary must obey not his personal impulses, but only those which serve the cause of the revolution.'\n\nSo wrote Sergey Nechayev, a terrorist of a bygone era, but still an inspirational figure to revolutionaries such as Ustinov.\n\nA statue of Aleksey Ustinov was recently erected in Moscow - the father of the Socialist-Revolutionaries, whose path was set forth by Spiridonova, the mother of the Socialist-Revolutionaries. Ustinov, of course, hates this statue. He cannot bring himself to appreciate this unhealthy romanticisation of his image, this worship of heroes. It was the same immorality that came with the tyrant Savinkov, and now history seems to repeat itself.\n\nWhat does a statue bring for the success of the revolution, what does it inspire in the minds of the people? As far as he is concerned, he has once again become the antagonist of the system, not unlike the days of old. It seems the Maximalist revolution is not enough, that those friendships he cultivated over the years are for naught if this is what it has produced. He sees now, as Nechayev wrote, that the revolutionary can have no friendship or attachment with those detrimental to the cause.\n\nPerhaps he shall dedicate his life again to that cause. And of course, a true Maximalist is a dedicated, merciless man."
 socrus.180.a: "Through struggle you will rise again."

 socrus.181.t: "Departure of Maria Aleksandrovna"
 socrus.181.d: "Maria Spiridonova, eternal leader of the Esers and mother of the peasants, passed away at her home in Tambov a few days ago. An enormous state funeral and military parade is to be held in Moscow to honour this revolutionary who gave her life to the cause.\n\nSpiridonova purportedly left behind a will; copies of 'Spiridonova's Testament to the Russian People' have surfaced, despite government claims that it is a forgery. In it, Spiridonova expresses regret that she enabled the creation of a cruel state no better than that which the Bolsheviks created, and that she hopes future generations will not associate her with the Maximalist crimes against the people.\n\nIf only she knew how her words would be twisted to justify such evils, she continues, then she would have preferred to have died many years ago. Still, she states that the 'Socialist-Revolutionary cause is impossible to exterminate; it lives in the masses, in the depths of their psychology. The revolutionary revival against its perversion is inevitable'.\n\nBut even amidst the hope for a better future, there is no hope left for Spiridonova. 'I truly was born under the most unlucky star', so ends her last will."
 socrus.181.a: "Fare thee well, dear Marusya."

 socrus.182.t: "A Meeting in Belgorod"
 socrus.182.d: "For some time the Ukrainian Borotbysts, who have sought to take down the German-aligned Ukrainian state for two decades now, have been covertly operating in Belgorod and other border cities. It was on this that an informal meeting took place in Belgorod between the Russian representative, Vladimir Karelin, and the leader of the Borotbysts, Oleksandr Shumskyi.\n\nShumskyi was quick to recognise Karelin; the latter had maintained contacts with Belarusian and Ukrainian socialists, once being the leader of the Left-SRs in Kharkiv and initially organising uprisings against the early Hetman's rule. The two agreed on a few of the most important matters: Moscow would officially sanction the Borotbysts, lending them arms and funding them. In exchange, the Borotbysts would be an inalienable part of the future Ukrainian government.\n\nBut when Karelin mentioned the possibility of a united Ukrainian leftist front, Shumskyi became sceptical. The idea of a united front is noble, said Shumskyi - but he added that he firmly believes many Ukrainian socialists emphasise the national question over the social revolution. Shumskyi was adamant that this former question had already been solved, a fact that many Ukrainian socialists were unwilling to admit. Thus, if one day Russia crosses the border, Karelin will not be able to count on much of the Ukrainian left.\n\nIn the latter part of the conversation, Shumskyi added that both the Borotbysts and the Socialist-Revolutionaries understand the motto 'Through struggle you will rise'. The acts of sabotage against the Savinkovist regime were necessary for the Russian revolution - so will it be against the Ukrainian bourgeois regime. Why waste time with a leftist front when the Borotbysts have shown great strides and followed Moscow's example? Karelin ultimately believed that a united Ukrainian front was possible, but agreed that in any case, the Borotbysts would be the ones to lead it."

 socrus.183.t: "The Kharkiv Incident"
 socrus.183.d: "It was only a matter of time before official Russian support for the Borotbysts would be consequential for Russo-Ukrainian relations. This past week, a strike by steelworkers at the Kharkiv Tractor Plant turned into chaos when the police were called in to quell the protests.\n\nThe revolutionaries quickly sprang into action, as the Borotbysts and Ukapists armed the steelworkers and braced for the incoming attack. Realising the gravity of the situation, the Ukrainian government decided to send in the military; but the chief organisers of the defence managed to escape across the border into Belgorod.\n\nA number of key events transpired. The Borotbyst movement was quickly declared illegal, on the justification that it was a terrorist group funded by foreign powers that sought to overthrow the government. [202.GetName] attempted to summon the Russian ambassador, demanding that the communist criminals be extradited and face trial for their actions.\n\nUltimately, they received no reply, as we have nothing to discuss with those who seek to oppress the working class. In response, they chose to sever all diplomatic relations with Russia. Such actions were to be expected from [202.GetName], but they no doubt highlight that tension in Europe is spiralling out of control, and that few are willing to save the continent from its inevitable destruction."

 socrus.184.t: "Questions of the Tambov Soviet"
 socrus.184.d: "Andrey Kolegayev, a Maximalist with a background in agrarian issues, spoke to the Congress today about issues concerning the Tambov Experiment. Elections to the Tambov Soviet, he noted, had produced unsatisfactory results; delegates to the Soviet were overall rather right-wing, with many being independent of any political party and having a questionable commitment to socialism at best. Kolegayev was attempting to point out that the idealistic tenets of the Tambov Programme were not playing out as expected; as an alternative, he proposed that members elected to the Soviet would have to be of a registered political party.\n\nThe VST was quick to back Kolegayev; in a supporting statement, party member Nikolay Sukhanov mentioned that peasants were quick to vote against their own interests, and that while Soviet democracy was necessary, this democracy should not include those alien to socialism, who are most assuredly trying to subvert the system from within.\n\nThe Spiridonovist faction of the Esers was suddenly under heavy criticism, and they felt outnumbered. However, a political heavyweight stepped in. Spiridonova had mostly stayed on the sidelines of such debates to act as a unifying figure for the revolution; but this time, she staunchly defended the elections to the Tambov Soviet. The adversity the Congress faces is not that the people of Tambov have elected right-wing socialists, but that parties like the PSR and VST have not earned their trust. The Soviets are not simply a political and economic organisation that represents the workers and peasants, but a platform that reflects the people's will, their mood, and needs.\n\nSpiridonova's intervention was instrumental in swaying the rest of the party to rally behind the Tambov Experiment. The whole ordeal put on full display how the Premier could influence the PSR to her liking, reflecting her almost cult-like status in the Narodnik movement."
 socrus.184.a: "The Matushka's words speak volumes."

 socrus.185.t: "Dreaming of the Future"
 socrus.185.d: "A few VST and SR higher-ups met at Vladimir Levitsky's private residence in the Dolgoprudny settlement, just 20 kilometres from Moscow. The attendees included the respective leaders of both parties, but more importantly included some of their most prominent anarchists, in particular Grigory Maksimov and Isaak Steinberg.\n\nOne point dominated the conversation. Where they may differ on methods, their vision is ultimately the same: that of a decentralised, borderline anarchist Russia, where the central government handles as little as possible. To that end, both the PSR and VST must be prepared to one day merge into an organisation; not one that dominates the political scene akin to a vanguard party, but one that ideologically guides the revolution towards these shared principles.\n\nThe agreement was shaky. While Maksimov and Steinberg were like-minded on the role of parties in this anarchist future, and had plenty of ideas in common, they were eager not to play second fiddle to each other. It seemed as if the agreement was going to break down when the two began fiercely debating theoretical matters on how to achieve this future. Ultimately, both Spiridonova and Levitsky intervened in the argument, advising their respective party members to focus on something constructive rather than wasting time on pointless bickering."
 socrus.185.a: "Towards the abolition of party and state!"

 socrus.186.t: "The Socialism of East and West"
 socrus.186.d: "A major consequence of the PSR's ascension to power is that it has shown a new way to socialism. It is not difficult to see that while Revolutionary Russia is a partner of equal strength to its sisters in Paris and London, it has forged its own path and rejected mainstream Western syndicalist thought.\n\nDifferences in socialist thought have become more difficult to reconcile than previously imagined. The last elections to the Peasant Section of the Third International saw SR candidate Boris Malkin become the new Chairman; since then, its executive committee has largely been advocating for agrarian parties to follow in Moscow's footsteps. Unsurprisingly, this came as a slap in the face to many Western socialist parties. Many French and British parties have now accused the Peasant Section of becoming a front for Russian state interests, and approving policies that have ultimately hindered the transition to socialism, enabling peasant 'small capitalism'.\n\nLike much of the VST, the Western socialists have often accused the Socialist-Revolutionaries of being a party utterly lacking in principle, one too vague and unscientific to bring about real change. A so-called 'party of action', they say, is too far removed from Marxist socialism; it is going to break apart on the basis of its own contradictions.\n\nMalkin has countered some of these claims, saying that while the Esers may have different views on how to achieve a socialist future, it is about the ends - not the means. Furthermore, it is not nationalist deviation to believe that different countries will achieve socialism through different means. The present material and spiritual conditions will provide for the revolution - not by the bayonet of a rifle or by the theorycraft of a politician, but by the people's will!"
 socrus.186.a: "Here in Russia, we have illuminated a path for peasant Europe."

 socrus.187.t: "The Future Direction of the Party"
 socrus.187.d: "The Russia of today is much different than that of 1917: the urban proletariat are only increasing as a proportion of Russia's working population, and this electorate is mostly in the VST's grasp. Thus, a worry of the party is that relying on the party's traditional base, the rural masses, will not be enough to keep it competitive with their rivals. To finally solve this dilemma, Chairman-Minister Kamkov summoned various SR ministers to his residence, including Vladimir Karelin, Nikolay Zdobnov, Isaak Steinberg, and Andrey Kolegayev, and encouraged them to discuss how the party should prepare for the future.\n\nZdobnov and Karelin formulated their viewpoint in an unexpected direction, declaring this a non-issue. In practice, rural and urban interests are always going to be somewhat conflicted; attempting to steal the VST's electorate by expanding our outreach to the urban proletariat is going to be harmful to the revolution, regardless of whether it would succeed or not. Instead, the PSR should maintain its current influence among the peasantry and work with like-minded figures in the VST's right faction. After all, the two share a rather similar vision of the future - and an SR party state is not conducive to that vision. Only the preservation of the workers' coalition can lead Russia to true socialism.\n\nBut Steinberg and Kolegayev disagreed. The VST is an unreliable ally, they claimed, as evidenced by its left faction's open hostility to the PSR's goals. Relying on its future goodwill is simply a gamble that cannot be taken, and as such, the PSR needs to become a party for all, with its goal of bridging the gap between the rural and the urban. He proposed a government-sponsored programme that will fund the creation of phalanstères - buildings that integrate both rural and urban work - as a way to accomplish this very goal. By integrating these two communities, the PSR can show that their vision is not of peasant favouritism, but the unity of workers and peasants.\n\nOnly one vision prevails in Kamkov's mind - but which will it be?"

 socrus.188.t: "A Maximalist and the Matushka"
 socrus.188.d: "It is no question that Spiridonova's status as the premier has inspired thousands of Russian women to cast off their chains and reject the old patriarchy, but she is not the only one. One of the most prominent Maximalists and a famous revolutionary, Irina Kakhovskaya, too has achieved somewhat of a legendary status.\n\nLike other Maximalists, Kakhovskaya believes in arguably more dubious methods of bringing about the SR's goals. She and other Socialist-Revolutionaries were sentenced to hard labour in the Nerchinsk Penal Colony. There she met Spiridonova, and they cultivated a strong friendship. Later, she would go on to assassinate the commander of occupation forces in Ukraine, Hermann von Eichhorn, and even planned to take out Hetman Skoropadskyi.\n\nArguably, Kakhovskaya was instrumental in the SR revolution against Savinkov, as she organised many assassinations of top SZRS officials, and she can certainly be credited with the revival of the Maximalists as a whole, along with other figures. Still, even as she and Spiridonova differ on methods of achieving socialism, their personal friendship has lasted for all this time. Other Maximalists like Ustinov and Kolegayev have always been somewhat estranged from the Premier, especially as of late. But Kakhovskaya's presence always reminds the Premier that the shared struggle, not ideology, binds people together."

 socrus.189.t: "The Future of the Revolution"
 socrus.189.d: "As the new head of the council of ministers, Aleksey Ustinov had just finished the first meeting of the cabinet, which had been inaugurated not long ago. Ustinov was quick to remind his allies in the VST's communist faction and the RKP(b) that they still share a number of disagreements. Commitment to the revolution was, of course, not one of them, but how they viewed that revolution certainly was.\n\nThe new cabinet made a vague commitment to the eventual unification of the workers' parties, though no timetable was given for this, and the details of it were even more vague. Either way, it was expected that it would be a peaceful merger, one between comrades and friends serving the revolution.\n\nThis was not what Ustinov had in mind. A peaceful merger was ideal, but he had little hope that it was possible. Just as he was one, the Bolsheviks were schemers. They had their own interests at the table, likely more concerned with wielding power than actual unity of the revolution. It suddenly hit Ustinov that he perhaps had made one too many allies - potentially backstabbing ones. If the Maximalists were to be at the top of the struggle and not on the sidelines, something needed to be done."

 socrus.190.d: "The Ministry of Culture has been quite active lately. In autonomous regions, the native language spelling of their oblasts and cities has been made official, rather than the old Russian spellings.\n\nSome large cities' names are being changed to no longer honour reactionary Emperors and White generals, but to honour the freedom fighters and revolutionaries of the past."
 socrus.190.a: "A change we can all agree on."

 socrus.191.t: "Mending the Rift"
 socrus.191.d: "The top brass of the Socialist-Revolutionaries had gathered at Aleksey Ustinov's residence. Comrade Kamkov was not present, stating his intention to withdraw from party activity for the foreseeable future - no doubt bitter about Ustinov dethroning him.\n\nUstinov intended to explain the meaning of his and the Maximalists' actions as of late, as he wanted to avoid further alienating the rest of the party. He mentioned that everything that the Maximalists had done thus far was, for the most part, pure belief in the Socialist-Revolutionary cause, and that some extraordinary measures were needed to ensure they remained at the top.\n\nThe main topic of discussion, however, was the alliance with the VST's left and the Bolsheviks. The Socialist-Revolutionaries generally have great disdain for these types of communists, who no doubt have despicable and paternalistic attitudes towards the peasantry - so it came as quite the shock when Ustinov's cabinet included many of their top figures. Ustinov was quick to explain that this was a means to an end, and that these alliances are temporary; he had also intended to keep the spirit of the Workers' Coalition by offering a hand to those who had greatly disagreed with him, while also preserving the integrity of the revolution. When the time was right, however, he promised that those who threaten the unity of the worker and peasant will have no place in the cabinet.\n\nThere was still a fair amount of scepticism - Isaak Steinberg, in particular, hesitated to voice his belief that Ustinov may have just been building the ground for a dictatorship, and that the workers' coalition mattered not to the Maximalists based on their past statements. Spiridonova, still disagreeing with some of Ustinov's ideas, conceded that perhaps he had a point - and that a greater amount of liberalisation can come after the war, when counterrevolutionaries are no longer the biggest threat to Russian socialism."

 socrus.192.t: "Completion of the Siberian Direction"
 socrus.192.d: "With various industrial projects complete and rural mechanisation initiatives underway, many Siberian cities and towns are seeing new heights, largely thanks to Zdobnov's encouragement to invest in the region. A compromise ultimately had to be worked out between the SRs and the VST: Siberia was to have urbanisation efforts and its resources extracted if the VST was to support the plan. They seem to be accepting of its results, at the very least.\n\nAs for the Esers, the Siberian initiative has done more than simply help the region's people make a living for themselves: they have solidified Russia's eastern half as an Eser stronghold. It is living proof of the Esers' dedication to the poor man - who now can paint the Esers as a group of romanticists who are separate from the ideals they champion?"
 socrus.192.a: "The fight is for all Russia's people."

 socrus.193.t: "End of the Tambov Experiment"
 socrus.193.d: "The expected timetables for the so-called 'Tambov Experiment' have run their course. Unfortunately, the results are nothing special - and some have argued that it was a waste of time to pursue, an utter failure of an investment. The problems were numerous - lack of capital for agricultural modernisation, the inability to convince Tambov's peasantry to invest in rural enterprises, and more.\n\nAll the while, much of the VST ruthlessly criticised the project as another romanticist endeavour detached from any socialist thought. In the end, their arguments seem to have been vindicated - as much as it hurts to face."
 socrus.193.d2: "The expected timetables for the so-called 'Tambov Experiment' have run their course. The project seems to have had mixed results - while some goals were completed, a lack of investment, among other problems, ultimately hindered it. It certainly produced some of the desired results, and the people of Tambov are even more of an Eser stronghold than ever before; at the same time, many of the more idealistic expectations were not met.\n\nHow many of the more idealistic Esers will still be able to convince others of their vision remains to be seen."
 socrus.193.d3: "The expected timetables for the so-called 'Tambov Experiment' have run their course. People's militia reform that ultimately created a stable and well-trained law enforcement, agricultural modernisation, the construction of sugar and alcohol factories, and more - all were accomplished in a relatively short timespan, not only greatly modernising the region but showing that many of the Esers' idealistic visions aren't as out of touch as they seem.\n\nSeveral leading anarchists, like the VST's Grigory Maksimov, personally pointed to the experiment as something that exemplifies what the future of Russia should look like."
 socrus.193.a: "That could've gone better."
 socrus.193.b: "I see."
 socrus.193.c: "Good work!"

 socrus.194.t: "The Head of the White Snake"
 socrus.194.d: "There is the air of a civil war in Russia. As the new socialist government is giving its first decrees from Moscow, most of the country is in confusion. But it is not the aimless chaos of 1917, when Russia was in anarchy and only swords ruled. Most of the civil service seems to view [GetSecondInCommand]'s government as legitimate enough not to actively resist it, and armed resistance has been only sporadic and regional. Assurances by Provisional President [RUS.GetLeader] have calmed some nerves, and many are even cautiously hopeful - in that the new government seems more like the Provisional one in 1917 rather than the Bolshevik one.\n\nThe largest military conspiracy around Mikhail Drozdovsky was unable to remain secret, and the general was soon arrested. Even though the officer corps in many garrisons preferred resistance, the overwhelming majority of the common soldiers and NCOs have not been willing to raise arms against the new revolutionary government, and instead, in many places, have placed their former superiors under arrest. General Aleksandr Vasilevsky and 27 other young generals recognised the new government in a widely circulated letter, calling for restraint from the military and demanding that free elections be organised.\n\nThe former Chief of Army and a number of other high-ranking officers were arrested in connection with crimes committed by the Savinkov regime. Some managed to flee, while a few are dead after resisting arrest. In some cases, small battles were fought. Our security services have managed to capture Denikin, Wrangel, Drozdovsky, and Kutepov, with Markov on the run. The strongest resistance has been organised not by the old generals, but by younger ones, particularly former Svobodnik-associated figures. But there has not been widespread defection or nationwide resistance, and the small White holdouts have been cleared relatively efficiently."
 socrus.194.a: "We will take no chances with the Whites."

 socrus.195.t: "Parfinenko's March"
 socrus.195.d: "'All power to the Soviets! Death to the White Saboteurs!' was the rallying cry heard throughout Southern Russia. As so-called Ataman Pavlov's rebellion raged on, taking over the local administration and committing travesties wherever his forces went, the People's Militia went to respond in kind.\n\nThe young Maximalist and People's Militia leader in the Yekaterinodar region, Fyodor Parfinenko, led his forces to the village of Mishkinskaya, not far from Novocherkassk. Mishkinskaya was sure to have an infestation of Cossack forces operating in the area, but with the army occupied in the major towns, Parfinenko decided to take matters into his own hands.\n\nWhat followed was nothing short of a massacre, as Parfinenko's forces engaged in near-indiscriminate killings against the Pavlovites and their collaborators. The village was quickly cleansed of Cossack partisans, with many wealthier peasants sharing their fate. Though Parfinenko's actions were unauthorised, he quickly earned local fame as a man of action - someone who did what was necessary to maintain stability and the socialist order.\n\nMore importantly, it was a massive propaganda victory for the Maximalists. Moderate PSR and VST members in local southern Soviets began to be recalled and replaced by more revolutionary representatives aligned with the Maximalists. Southern Russia has never had the most particularly radical SRs, but the situation has been flipped on its head, and the party as a whole seems to be aligning with the Maximalists as time goes on."
 socrus.195.a: "A spontaneous expression of the people's will."

 socrus.196.t: "The VST Brothers' War"
 socrus.196.d: "A relatively innocuous speech by Ivan Gronsky to the Congress suddenly became a declaration of war against his party's right-wing faction. At first, Gronsky commended Parfinenko's attack on Mishkinskaya, saying it is the exact type of revolutionary vigilance that Russia needs in this hour - but his words became bellicose.\n\nIt could not come at a worse time for Fyodor Dan and his allies. In many local Soviets, especially in the south, moderate socialist deputies were being shouted down by hardliners and the People's Militia. While the inauguration of Ustinov's cabinet had largely pushed the right's position out of the cabinet, they could, for some time, operate on a more local level and in the Congress.\n\nAnd now, with that no longer the case, many in the VST's left-wing and the Maximalists capitalised. The Danists, as they were called, were shouted down as reactionaries, blamed for the successes of Pavlov's rebellion. If only they had not let the villages and towns under their control become breeding grounds for White sabotage, then there would be no need for true revolutionaries to step in and clean up their mess for them.\n\nThe mood in the Congress was extremely tense, as it had virtually become a shouting match. But in the end, the Danists were cornered. In the following days, many decided to resign from politics, fearing for their safety, while others simply opted to stay silent. The incident practically destroyed any remaining influence of the right faction - leaving the left, particularly those aligned with the Maximalists, with an even greater grasp on the party."
 socrus.196.a: "They deserved that."

 socrus.198.t: "Demise of the Democratic Bloc"
 socrus.198.d: "Over the past year, there have been rumours of a secret pact formed in the shadows of the Workers' Coalition. Ustinov, hearing of these rumours, sent Kakhovskaya - who was always close to Spiridonova - to investigate them. She had reported back some time ago, confirming the existence of a so-called 'Democratic Bloc', composed of various Esers, VST-Rightists, junior officers, and the SDS, who were gathering together to oppose any attempts to break apart the Workers' Coalition.\n\nThe existence of a secret bloc that could be plotting against his government was alarming to Ustinov, to say the least. He had been wary of any further attempts to centralise power, believing that the support of the Congress might not have been enough if someone attempted to remove him from power. With every day, he only became more paranoid. Would both his allies on the right and left betray him?\n\nBut thankfully, all those concerns have been laid to rest. Boris Kamkov has retreated from politics ever since his deposition. Yury Sablin's position in the army has decayed to irrelevancy. And finally, Fyodor Dan's clique of reactionaries have scurried out of the Soviets and the Congress, never to be heard from again. All that remains of the so-called Democratic Bloc are the Kamkovites. They are not stupid, of course - who knows what they are plotting behind the scenes?\n\nYet Ustinov understands the equation: not every threat to Maximalist power needs to be exterminated yet. The rest of the Eser party knows that the only alternative is a dictatorship of the VST, which will seek to destroy the peasant Russia. Only the Maximalists can bring together both ends of the Workers' Coalition and ensure unity.\n\nWith war on the horizon and much of the opposition dealt with, Ustinov and Levandovsky met to prepare their most important piece of legislation. On the very first day of the Great Revolutionary War, power would be concentrated into one great revolutionary force, above the partisanship and factionalism of the last three years."
 socrus.198.a: "The time has come."

 socrus.199.t: "Downfall of the Red Napoleon"
 socrus.199.d: "Mikhail Tukhachevsky has become something of a legend in the post-war years. He is known to the Russian public as a military mastermind, who brilliantly utilised deep operations to destroy the capitalist powers. Naturally, when Russians are asked who in the current age they look up to, he consistently comes up in a list of names alongside Spiridonova, Ustinov, and the like.\n\nThe Maximalist top brass have become wary, even jealous, of his rise to stardom - and with good reason. Tukhachevsky has never been the most politically reliable; the release of the Blyukher Report propelled him to the head of the army, but he was a compromise ticket between the many factions of the Workers' Coalition, even if a competent one. Unlike many of the other choices, he has mostly stayed away from politics. This has helped bolster his image even more - as a man who stands above the petty politicking of the Congress and simply wishes to defend the revolution. Ironically, despite not being a Maximalist himself, that image is not much different from the one the Maximalists wish to portray themselves as.\n\nBut every dog has its day, and at some point, it was not going to be Tukhachevsky's. He had been criticised recently at a meeting of the Congress, accused of 'propagating militarist idolatry'. While the Maximalists have never really shied away from violent tactics and near-militarist ideology, in the post-war age they have been less keen on emphasising these aspects, as external threats to Maximalist power are nonexistent.\n\nUltimately, Tukhachevsky's fate was not too unpleasant, at least in comparison to many of the members of the now-outlawed VST, who are now six feet under. He was stripped of his position as the commander-in-chief and assigned to the faraway Siberian Military District. Levandovsky, who had no doubt eyed Tukhachevsky's position for some time, became the new commander-in-chief."
 socrus.199.a: "Another potential threat dealt with."

 socrus.200.t: "The Maximalist Manifesto"
 socrus.200.d: "The meeting that founded the 'Maximalist Manifesto' took place today in Moscow. Attendees consisted primarily of SSR representatives, as well as other delegates such as Kasimiersz Zakrzewski of Poland, Vasil Ikonomov of Bulgaria, and Oleksandr Shumskyi of Ukraine. The event was advertised as the successor to the meeting that created the Totalist Charter many years ago.\n\nThe preface to the manifesto claimed that the Totalist Charter was outdated because it had been hijacked by 'state capitalists' who had nothing in common with actual socialism, directing particular ire at the Maximists of Britain and the Neosocialists of France. The manifesto then lists a number of points: the rejection of political parties and unions as tools to build socialism, emphasis on the spontaneous self-organisation of the working class, and, like its predecessor, total dedication to the revolution.\n\nThe manifesto also harshly criticises the Third International, depicting it as less of an organisation dedicated to world revolution and more of an instrument of the Western powers. While masquerading as an all-socialist front, it is in reality dominated by French and British socialists, who are grossly overrepresented in the Third International's Executive Committee and other organs.\n\nIt ends with a call for the Third International to accept a multitude of different attitudes and practices towards socialism, or it will be at risk of alienating or even splitting the global working-class movement. This call was obviously not too well received by many in the West, with many predicting that the Maximalists may soon abandon the Third International to create a new, Moscow-directed organisation."
 socrus.200.a: "If that happens, it will be their fault, not ours."

 socrus.201.t: "The Real Final Battle"
 socrus.201.d: "War! It strikes the heart of Europe once again. This time it is not a struggle for or against imperialism, but a war of the proletarian states. For one reason or another, the rivalry with the West has exploded into a full-blown conflict, one that will define the future of international socialism.\n\nWe can only regret that it came to this, but what is done is done. Now is the time to show that the red banner of the Maximalists shall liberate the world from all who oppose the natural will of the working class!"
 socrus.201.a: "Onwards to [INT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]!"

 socrus.202.t: "Future Leadership of the Socialist-Revolutionaries"
 socrus.202.d: "While Ustinov is surely the most respected of the Maximalists and commands fanatical loyalty within the SSR, his time as Premier is running out. While ambitious, he has never wished to monopolise the crystals of power; it is sooner or later that he will choose to resign due to health issues or old age.\n\nAnd with the old generation of the Maximalists slowly dying, it may be time for the new to take its place soon. A number of potential successors have been floated around by the SSR's Central Committee - though such speculation is often frowned upon as hurting the unity of the Maximalist movement. Among them, Kolegayev is the obvious choice as the second most powerful man in the government and Ustinov's right-hand man. But while his selection may seem almost natural, there is worry that a Kolegayev-led Russia would be little to no different from Ustinov's, and for Maximalism to survive the new age, it needs to adapt and change.\n\nA potential alternative is Viktor Cherny. Initially the Minister of Industry and Trade in Ustinov's cabinet, he wielded the significant Directorate of Armaments during the Great Revolutionary War, ensuring that the trains ran on time and the proletariat could stand up to defeat the capitalist menace. He is arguably moderate for a Maximalist, keen on organisational matters rather than on propaganda.\n\nOn the opposite end is Iosif Zhukovsky-Zhuk, chief editor of the government-run newspaper 'Labour Republic'. Zhukovsky-Zhuk has often argued that the spirit of Maximalism has been lost in recent years, that the regime became yet another bureaucratic socialist state. Believing that a 'culturally proletarian revolution' must happen if Russia is to regain the workers' spirit, he commands intense popularity as the SSR's chief propagandist. Whether he can channel that energy to the top echelons of power remains unanswered."
 socrus.202.a: "A power struggle in the making."

 socrus.203.t: "Towards the Future"
 socrus.203.d: "The Kaiserreich has fallen, and Europe is unrecognisable from what it once was. Finally, the foretold demise of capitalism has come to fruition, and victory is under the banner of the Internationale.\n\nDomestically, the situation is nothing spectacular. Premier Spiridonova has announced her intention to retire, with Comrade Kamkov taking her place. Contrary to some expectations, Premier Kamkov stated that he would not attempt to chart a radical course with the war over, and would instead simply focus on peace and rebuilding. It is still well known how the Maximalists nearly thwarted socialist democracy - with that in mind, we cannot reasonably expect much of the socialist future until that democracy feels whole again."
 socrus.203.a: "So be it."
 ### VST Path ###

 socrus.300.t: "The Convocation of the Congress"
 socrus.300.d.radsoc: "The institutions of the decrepit Russian Republic lie in ruins, and much of the country is now run by improvised revolutionary councils of Soviets and Trade Unions, as well as village collectives. There is little reason to keep any part of Savinkov's dictatorial reforms, and Nabokov's parliamentarianism too is unfitting for a workers' Russia. Thus, a new constitution must be drafted, and by decree of the Provisional President, Maria Spiridonova, free elections will be held.\n\nHowever, precautions have been made to stop any backsliding into reaction. Any members of the SZRS, SOR, or organisations aligned with these are not allowed to vote until they have either served their sentences or proven innocent by people's courts. This also applies to those who claim to have joined the Svobodnik organisations under coercion or out of opportunism - which instantly sweeps away major parts of the Russian political right and centre. Additionally, voting shall be organised by workers' councils, essentially primarily limiting suffrage to workers and peasants.\n\nPredictably, over two-thirds of the seats in the Congress went to socialist parties, with the Socialist-Revolutionaries receiving around half of the total votes. The other major bloc is the All-Russian Union of Labour, and a number of other smaller parties. The Radical-Democrats and Kadets received some seats, but they were only ghosts of their former selves."
 socrus.300.d.syndie: "The Russian Republic is, de facto, in the control of President Levitsky's Workers' Coalition, but it is not enough. The bourgeois republic carries the poisonous past of the White movement, and it must be demolished to create a new and better workers' Russia. Thus, elections have been called to draft a new constitution that will dramatically reshape the country.\n\nSeats in the Congress are to be distributed based on the Law on Workers' Representation - so almost half of the seats will be elected by unions and workers' councils, while the remainder come from geographic electoral districts. The opposition is protesting, with some calling it an equivalent power grab to the one Savinkov did in 1936, but the opposition has not materialised into concrete action. On the contrary, security services have intensified their hunt for former supporters of the SZRS and SOR, who are banned from elections until they have served their sentences.\n\nPredictably, the Congress came out with a great socialist majority, with the Socialist-Revolutionary Party, VST, and various smaller socialist groups receiving almost two-thirds of the vote."
 socrus.300.a: "The people have spoken. Let us begin."

 socrus.301.t: "The Congress Convenes"
 socrus.301.d: "The fighting began immediately. The former Senate Palace, which was absolutely packed with people, was basically controlled chaos, directed only by Comrade [GetSecondInCommand], who had the difficult task of keeping order in the hall. Many articles of the future constitution were easy to agree on: the construction of Socialism, the declaration of the Russian Socialist Federative Republic, absolute freedom of religion and language, rule by locally elected workers' and peasants' soviets... but when it came to the details, the Congress descended into endless debate.\n\n'ALL POWER TO THE SOVIETS' was the rallying cry of the leftmost faction with the communists. Many SRs, especially the Maximalists, agreed but refused to support the Bolshevik proposal. The moderates demanded details: what would 'all power' even mean? In practice, some kind of national congress would exist, and it would be integral to define the nature of this congress, or a new dictatorship would be created out of the vagueness of the text. This was criticised as crypto-parliamentarism, or even worse, liberalism.\n\nWould there be a chamber for labour unions, like in France? Would there be a chamber for regional representation? Some even proposed a tricameral structure. How would the government interact with the Congress and the Soviets? Can it be voted out?\n\nAfter multiple pauses, there were three competing drafts. It was almost nighttime, but the mood was ecstatic, and the delegates wished to put it to a vote. The 'Soviet' proposal is light on institutions, and grants the Congress, elected by the Soviets, almost limitless powers to create and abolish institutions as they need to. The 'Federal' proposal introduces much more checks and balances, including guaranteed regional and labour union representation. A third mixed option was proposed, which tried to reconcile constitutional safeguards and unrestricted Soviet democracy."

 socrus.302.t: "Balance of Power"
 socrus.302.d: "Soon after, the Congress started a debate over the exact nature of power in our new republic. The prevailing opinion was that no one wished for a repeat of 1918, when the Bolsheviks had simply ignored the results of the Soviet elections and centralised all power to the Council of People's Commissars. It is also generally agreed upon that no single person should wield great power: the head of state would be collective, handled by the Premier of the Congress as a largely representative role, as before.\n\nBut the matter of government is much more divisive. The anti-centralist proposals hope for weak executive power that is fully responsible to the Congress. While this would make centralisation of power difficult, it might also lead to a system that simply cannot decide on anything. On the other hand, the government must be able to act also in times when no Congress can hold session, and many fear that without a powerful central executive the counterrevolutionaries will be able to mount a stronger resistance."

 socrus.303.d: "The early days of our Republic have been tumultuous, with many socialists not yet aligned to any faction, and some seats have changed multiple times already due to recall elections. But as the Constitution has been accepted, the electoral system is also stabilising. A large number of the delegates continued their terms to the Congress of Soviets and Labour Unions. Many older socialists remember the great days of 1917 with tears in their eyes, as masses of people are freely gathering to decide on matters that concern their lives. After so much pain and persecution, the working class is free once more.\n\nThe first vote of the new Congress is naturally on the election of the Premier, who would serve as the symbolic Head of State and preside over sessions of the Congress, acting as its chairman - or chairwoman - an important mention considering Spiridonova's strong chances. The Premier's true power is being in the middle of everything, able to influence politics through their advice and arguments. It is expected that one of the older, respected figures will be elected. Votes are not yet counted, but both Vladimir Levitsky and Maria Spiridonova seem to have a great amount of support."

After the initial cabinet proposal was shot down by the Congress, it became clear that finding a government that would satisfy everyone - Levitsky's own supporters, the Danists, the Communists, and the Esers - is much easier said than done. Each group is jealous of the other gaining too much power. The very functioning of our Republic relies on support from the SRs, but our own party naturally wishes for true Marxists to wield the most power. The right and the left are already at each other's throats, and Levitsky's own supporters wish for him not to compromise with others too much - we are here to fulfil Levitsky's vision, not someone else's."

 socrus.305.d.war: "Given the current great revolutionary war, the factionalism in the Central Committee is practically non-existent. Everyone here understands: a united front is needed behind Premier [ROOT.GetLeader] to triumph in this war.\n\nWe may have our policy differences, but this is not the time or the place to bring them up - not until the Red Army has triumphed over all its foes, and a new, free world is dawning."
 socrus.305.d.stable: "There was nothing dramatic in the Party Congress. Premier [ROOT.GetLeader] enjoys broad support from the VST's factions and other key members, and [GetSecondInCommand]'s policies received much praise. The Congress resembled more of a propaganda rally than a proper forum of internal debate; such was the unity of the All-Russian Union of Labour behind its leaders. Many new appointments were made, and numerous policy drafts were agreed upon to be added to the VST programme and rules.\n\nAll in all, these largely strengthen [ROOT.GetLeader]'s position within the Party."
 socrus.305.d.factionalism: "The Congress had hardly begun when it was already descending into factionalist debate. Premier [ROOT.GetLeader] came under fire from multiple directions, and [GetSecondInCommand]'s policies received their own share of ire.\n\nIt seems that the All-Russian Union of Labour is anything but unified - instead, its various powerful personalities are all vying for power and influence, unconvinced in [ROOT.GetLeader]'s ability to steer the party."
 socrus.305.d.streamlined: "Ever since Premier [ROOT.GetLeader] greatly streamlined the All-Russian Union of Labour, dissent has been rare. Factionalism is frowned upon, and troublemakers are easily expelled.\n\nComrade Lenin would be proud of the level of internal unity that the VST has found, as it has become clear that the only way to achieve political power is through following the party line - which is ultimately defined solely by [ROOT.GetLeader] and his closest allies."
 socrus.305.d.abramovich: "The Congress had hardly begun when it was already descending into factionalist debate. Premier [ROOT.GetLeader] came under fire from multiple directions - and instead of merely complaining, the opposition around Rafail Abramovich and Boris Nikolayevsky was able to rally a sufficiently large part of the VST membership behind them to overthrow Levitsky.\n\nThey portrayed Levitsky as an out-of-touch and weak leader, one who could not keep the radicalism of the left at bay nor craft a reasonable economic programme. Instead, they are proposing for Rafail Abramovich to take over - a proposal that is likely to pass, given the strength of the Right Faction in the Congress."

 socrus.307.d: "One of the first acts in power, pushed by Chairman of the Council of People's Ministers Grigory Zinovyev, has given the People's Ministries additional powers, particularly in wartime. In practice, the government can now bypass the protests of the Congress more easily, and more power has slipped into the hands of appointed committees from the elected delegates. But in rhetoric, Zinovyev has sold this as perfecting the revolutionary democracy and granting it the teeth it needs to survive the coming war and the world revolution.\n\nThese laws found a surprising amount of support, and Sulimov's Group for Defence of the Revolution came in full support for them, much to the dismay of the moderate opposition within VST. Vladimir Karelin denounced this as a communist power grab, still hoping that such measures are only needed for the stabilisation of the revolutionary state - but in the long term, they are unjustifiable."

 socrus.308.t: "The Path Towards the Communist Society"
 socrus.308.d: "Until now, Levitsky's government has been largely busy putting out fires all across Russia, but now the Revolution is starting to be secure, and dark clouds are looming. Murmur has already risen in the Workers' Coalition and the VST, and everyone understands that the broad revolutionary front only maintains unity as long as they have a united vision of the future. Levitsky's vision until now has been exactly this - the creation of socialist republic through a united front across the entire Russian left, and synthesising various strains of socialism in pluralistic communism, avoiding the pitfalls of Lenin.\n\nBut what comes next?\n\nSome, like Sulimov and Kamenev, argue that the war is the priority - the existential priority of the revolution. It is pointless to debate on future ideology when the entire proletarian revolution has to survive the onslaught of German steel and blood first. Others, especially in the Right-VST, wish for Levitsky to truly mend the rift between Russian socialists - heal the bad blood between Bolsheviks and Mensheviks, and perhaps eventually unify even with the Socialist-Revolutionaries into a single party of the Russian proletariat.\n\nBut the third, most idealistic proposal comes from the grassroots, especially from the Russian anarcho-syndicalists like Grigory Maksimov. They argue that steps must be taken to use our power to start dismantling the coercion of the state. The war will put us under great threat of falling into authoritarianism, and the only way the young revolution can safeguard itself is by devolving power and empowering local Soviets, Trade Unions, and Guards. They wish to take a radical new step away from party politics and believe that the people will follow - lest they become apathetic to renewed parliamentary scheming."

 socrus.310.d: "The fundamental problem of allowing free elections is that the wrong people can be elected. Lenin chose to suppress Soviet democracy in 1918 when it turned away from him; the Mensheviks will not allow themselves the same measures. They have been making allies in the 'grey area' of Russian revolutionary politics - those who are not socialists, but also not banned as counter-revolutionary.\n\nThis includes both left-leaning liberals and, for example, independent regionalist or peasant groups, who are mainly representing their region without major ideological ties. These people are not married to the revolutionary cause - but it seems that they are willing enough to work within it."
 socrus.310.a: "If people vote for them, we must respect that."
 socrus.310.b: "They are on the path to redemption, but not there yet."

 socrus.311.t: "The Internationalist Jewish Congress"
 socrus.311.d: "The Internationalist Jewish Congress in Russia of all places! Who would have thought! The Tauride Palace in Petrograd was chosen to host the First Internationalist Jewish Congress, with delegates from 18 countries. Premier [RUS.GetLeader] naturally opened the Congress, and many prominent Jewish socialists across Russia were present. The SR Isaak Steinberg was given the honorary position of leading the discussions, and among other prominent delegates were Poale Zion Left's Zinovy Kheyfets, Yitzhok Lishovsky and Yakov Vitkin from Ukraine, Nahum Rafalkes, from Poland and Esther Frumkina from Belarus. From the Russian Bund, the delegation was led by Mikhail Liber, an old Menshevik.\n\nBut truth be told, the Congress has proved to be very controversial among European Jews, and in practice only attracted socialists. Many Jews already faced doubts over being disloyal to their home countries, and associating with such a Congress would only increase those doubts by non-Jews - after all, it could be seen as supporting the Russian war-mongering cause. The lacklustre turnout was a bitter disappointment to Vladimir Levitsky, who had genuinely high hopes. Even if the Congress did end up drafting a 'Declaration against Imperialism and Anti-Semitism', it was - in practice - only a propaganda victory for Russia, as the Eastern European Jewish leaders were not prepared to go against their own governments."
 socrus.311.a: "At least we tried."
 socrus.311.b: "Interesting."

 socrus.312.t: "The Dream of a Workers' Confederation"
 socrus.312.d: "The 'Bureau of Russian Anarcho-Syndicalists' and its main theorist and revolutionary, Grigory Maksimov, have never held high posts, but much of their programme has been adopted by Levitsky as some of the official goals of the Russian Democratic Federative Socialist Republic. It is no less ambitious than the formation of a decentralised Workers' Confederation, a system built on the ideals of democratic socialism. Many of its points are already widely embraced by the Workers' Coalition - power to the Soviets, the freedom of labour unions, and the denunciation of land-owning peasantry.\n\nBut Maksimov's points go further: in time, the party should cease to be a power, just like the state. As the powers of regional Soviets are increased, so too should central power decrease, until Russia - and any other people who wish to be a part - is a confederation of autonomous workers' soviets, not held together by force, but by mutual benefit. The role of a political party would be akin to a Church - something to inspire and give ideological meaning to the world, but it should not reign.\n\nObviously, many of these more idealistic concepts are politely ignored in day-to-day politics. Sure, Levitsky has always been an idealist, like many other Russian revolutionaries, but practical reality has time and again bent them to its will. Still, the anarcho-syndicalist perspective is greatly supported by practical examples - chiefly that of the Federation of Communes of France, which Maksimov has studied in depth. He argues that the chief failures of the French system are the politicisation of labour unions into state institutions, and the statist tendencies that have led to increased bureaucratic oversight over workers' democracy.\nSurely these wouldn't be problems in syndicalist Russia!"
 socrus.312.a: "Give me twenty years, and you will not recognise Russia."

 socrus.313.t: "Healing the Great Schism"
 socrus.313.d: "The Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party, like the Church of old, is still divided. Its old combatants, Lenin and Martov, are long gone. As early as the 1920s, the idea of a possible reunification of the Russian left was being dreamed of, and much of the work for it must be credited to Alexei Rykov, Nikolay Bukharin and Lev Kamenev, who emerged (after their long prison sentences) as the leading Bolshevik figures in Russia. Kamenev, in particular, pushed for cooperation with the remnants of the Mensheviks, such as Vladimir Levitsky-Tsederbaum. The two reasoned that there would be no hope at all for the cause of Russian communism if they could not first forge an alliance. Leninism had not proved successful, and likely could not succeed without overwhelming resistance, so western revolutionary front tactics should be adopted.\n\nBut old divisions die hard, despite the creation of the intentionally vague All-Russian Labour Union. Yes, there are Bolsheviks and even Mensheviks in every faction of the VST, and that divide is not terribly meaningful for most today. But the divide in ideas can be seen in every discussion inside the party. A large part of the unity of the party is maintained only by interpersonal ties or by the fear of worse alternatives. The only way to truly unite the party ideologically would be to show a path that works, one that leaves no room for doubt. Thus, we cannot take risks or flights of fancy in matters of policy. The time for idealism comes later - now our priorities should be rocking the boat as little as possible, focusing on policies that all of the VST can agree on, or at least are not too opposed to, and working slowly towards unifying the entire movement."
 socrus.313.a: "If only this had happened twenty years ago."

 socrus.314.t: "Speculation with Prices"
 socrus.314.d: "After mass socialisation of the land and factories, prices have been anything but stable, and the distribution of resources even less so. A workers' self-managed economy seems to function well in some parts of the country, and much less so in others. The enmity between urban and rural people has quickly flared up as their fundamentally opposing interests have clashed.\n\nThe peasants, even though they now farm communally owned land that has simply been handed over for their use, are not terribly enthusiastic about selling grain at fixed prices. The situation is certainly better than in 1918; Russian agriculture has advanced greatly since then, with many farms enjoying far higher efficiency and even the usage of tractors and harvesters. But there is simply little reason for the peasantry to produce much surplus. Ironically, the lack of landlords and debt on their backs does mean that there is much less incentive to work yourself to death.\n\nThis is why vestiges of markets still exist in our system, and they have their abusers, the petty businessmen of pre-revolutionary Russia or the savvy party functionaries who abuse their positions. The only long-term solution is the eventual spread of socialist ideology to the countryside, but for now, these issues must be approached in a way that does not lead to massive unrest that our enemies could easily exploit."
 socrus.314.a: "We need to create new kinds of incentives and positive examples."
 socrus.314.b: "We will strangle them slowly through the instruments of power."
 socrus.314.c: "Some amount of market freedom is tolerable, if necessary."

 socrus.315.t: "The Oxymoron of Peasant Communism"
 socrus.315.d: "It is no secret that the VST has little faith in Russia's peasants. The right wing faction seeks to re-educate them through socialist education and mechanisation of production, essentially turning the peasantry into a rural proletariat. The left seeks the same, but with violence and a far faster timetable. Even Levitsky's own faction has little faith in ruralism and tends to fall into the 'peasants will disappear through education' train of thought.\n\nBut across the aisle, in the Party of Socialist-Revolutionaries, there exists a half-century old tradition of socialist ruralism, already stemming from the original Narodniks. While deeply heretical to any proper Marxist, concepts like Ilya Mayorov's 'Peasant Communism' can be useful - and Premier Levitsky does understand the importance of winning over the peasants behind his project.\n\nInstead of deep hostility towards the peasantry, propaganda should take a positive stance, and emphasise the power of the peasantry as allies of the revolution. They should be won over through systems that reward efficiency and surplus, through peasant communes themselves negotiating with industrial workers. It has always been clear to the Esers that hatred only alienates the peasantry and turns them against the revolution - and they ARE the majority of the Russian people, after all.\n\nNaturally, this change will receive harsh criticism from Levitsky's own, but in the long term, it is for the better - or so he believes. At least it has secured Spiridonova's trust - and that of her allies."
 socrus.315.a: "We will likely regret this, but it's worth a try."

 socrus.316.t: "Women's Section of the All-Russian Union of Labour"
 socrus.316.d: "Russian revolutionaries have always included many women in their ranks, from the legendary Vera Figner to the brave assassins of Narodnaya Volya. The Socialist-Revolutionary Party has had its sizeable women's organisation active for most of the 1920s, though only now, with the rise of the left, has it turned to real ideas of women's rights in a socialist context, led by famous Left-SRs like Aleksandra Izmaylovich and Irina Kakhovskaya. The Esers' work on gender equality has always focused on ignoring gender altogether, rather than actively promoting the social position of women. It must be said, however, that Maria Spiridonova's leadership of the party has inspired countless young women into politics, especially into the ranks of the SRs.\n\nBut a strong competitor has emerged, as the famous feminist Aleksandra Kollontay and Zinaida Volkova have organised the foundation of the women's section of the VST, the Zhenotdel. Kollontay is already known as a fierce advocate of reshaping social hierarchies, opposing the idea of the traditional family and doing much practical work to give women both more freedom and a deeper understanding of the class struggle.\n\nThe Zhenotdel, in addition to practical matters such as educating women and creating communal laundries and cafeterias, are interested in the broader liberation of women, creating a New Woman who is an independent member of the proletariat, an equal ally of her husband and brother. She should scorn traditions, such as the deeply patriarchal social hierarchies that exist in less enlightened parts of Russia - scorn the veil, scorn the faith, scorn any structure that seeks to control women. The activities of these revolutionary women have created some controversy, especially in the Tatar oblasts, where anti-veil campaigns have drawn the ire of more conservative folk."
 socrus.316.a: "You go, girls!"
 socrus.316.b: "They should be kept in the party's control."
 socrus.316.c: "Undermine them, and support the respective SR organisation."

 socrus.320.t: "Protests Against the Minister of Labour"
 socrus.320.d: "The first months of the [GetSecondInCommand] government have been anything but stable, as competing interests, factionalism and personal rivalries have been testing the Workers' Coalition at every turn. The newest crisis centres around the People's Minister of Labour, Nikolay Aleksandrovich Uglanov. Initially, he got the post as a concession to the Left-VST as he was recommended by Lev Kamenev - but as the union organisers have come to constant conflicts with the Minister of Labour, even the Left-VST has started to distance themselves from Uglanov's political blunders. His jealous enmity with a major union organiser, Aleksandr Shlyapnikov, has only worsened the situation.\n\nOne thing is known for certain, Uglanov's days in the government are limited, but for now, it is not known who will take his chair."
 socrus.320.a: "A unionist hated by the unions, now that's suprising."

 socrus.322.t: "Comrade Uglanov's Resignation"
 socrus.322.intro: "Having lost the faith of both his own party and Congress, Nikolay Uglanov resigned bitterly - and immediately, debate began on his successor. The VTsSPS could not unite behind a single candidate who would have the trust of all major unions, and Zinovyev was already loudly demanding that the replacement of Uglanov should come from the left wing of the party, as Uglanov had been from."
 socrus.322.d.noleft: "$socrus.322.intro$\n\nAs a modest man, Grigory Zinovyev naturally argued that he would be the perfect candidate for a new Minister of Labour, a man able to fix the tarnished government-unions relationship. While there is a kernel of truth in it - Zinovyev certainly has charisma among the masses.\n\nThe Left-VST group in Congress started to campaign for Zinovyev, with Kamenev speaking in his favour. But the opposition organised quickly. Spearheaded by SR Vladimir Karelin and the Right-VST's group, enough votes were gathered to ensure that Zinovyev could not pass, even if [ROOT.GetLeader] wanted to appoint him."
 socrus.322.d.left: "$socrus.322.intro$\n\nWith an unstable majority in Congress, [ROOT.GetLeader] had freedom with regards to the appointment. In internal discussions, two main choices came up: the old Bolshevik unionist Sergey Medvedev, and the more moderate yet controllable unionist Vasily Schmidt."
 socrus.322.a: "Grishka the Third, like others before him, failed as well."
 socrus.322.b: "Medvedev deserves the position."
 socrus.322.c: "Schmidt will not cause any issues."

 socrus.323.t: "A Breakthrough?"
 socrus.323.d: "Zinovyev did not surrender after the failed attempt at taking the Ministry of Labour for himself. Instead, he came forward with another candidate: Sergey Pavlovich Medvedev, one of the major figures within Kamenev's Left Faction and a member of the VTsSPS Central Committee. Medvedev is already a much more tolerable option and could plausibly gain enough votes in Congress, even from the SRs.\n\nThe rival candidate came from the right, as Aleksandr Yulyevich Finn-Yenotayevsky was nominated - a man not from a unionist background, but an economist and political moderate. In the exceedingly tight series of votes, only one man will be able to secure a majority."
 socrus.323.a: "Tell Zinovyev that he got the votes. Medvedev it is."
 socrus.323.b: "Hopefully, Finn-Yenotayevsky will calm down the situation."

 socrus.324.t: "Zinovyev's Triumph"
 socrus.324.d: "The Congress gave its confidence to Zinovyev's candidate, Sergey Medvedev. Medvedev, an old war dog of the Russian labour movement, represents a major victory for the Communists, who now very much have their own man in a reasonably important ministry. While Levitsky was not terribly overjoyed to include Medvedev in his cabinet, fearing that he would serve as essentially a spokesperson for Zinovyev's schemes, he had no real choice, considering the division of Congress and lack of a majority for any other candidate.\n\nPolitically, the appointment of Medvedev was a catastrophe for Levitsky's supporters on the right. Sergey Kirov accused the old premier of weakness in front of crypto-Bolshevik bullying, and many in Levitsky's own faction, especially around Aleksandr Shlyapnikov, see this as a humiliating defeat for the authority of the Chairman of the VST. Some more opportunistic voices are even eyeing the Left faction, seeing Kamenev as a possible new Chairman for the VST. If these political setbacks continue, the unity of the Centre will be truly tried."
 socrus.324.a: "The deck is stacked against us."
 socrus.324.b: "Try to save what can be saved."

 socrus.325.t: "A Compromise"
 socrus.325.d: "Levitsky's bid to appoint Aleksandr Finn-Yenotayevsky as his Minister of Labour surprisingly failed, as he did not manage to win enough votes - critically, it came from Levitsky's own faction, as Mikhail Tomsky and other unionists refused to support a 'white-collar socialist' like Finn-Yenotayevsky. Back to square one, it seemed like the Congress could not find an agreement even on this simple matter. An SR candidate was considered briefly as something outside VST's factions, but that plan seemed to only increase Zinovyev's support in Congress.\n\nFinally, a backroom deal was made between Daniil Sulimov and the leadership of the VTsSPS, and after many concessions to the unionists, it was agreed that they would back Aleksandr Shlyapnikov if Levitsky appointed him. In practice, this ensures essentially autonomous labour unions, as government control would be under a staunch union independentist, Comrade Shlyapnikov himself. While this does not directly go against Levitsky's goals, it would limit his room for political manoeuvre. With these concessions, Shlyapnikov could also draw votes from the Left - and the political Gordian knot would be solved."
 socrus.325.a: "Can't we be unified for a single minute?"

 socrus.326.t: "Shlyapnikov's Protests"
 socrus.326.d: "The debate around capitalism has always been at the core of Russian Marxism, and now it has reached a boiling point in Congress. A large faction has emerged behind Aleksandr Shlyapnikov, who are harsh critics of our programme of 'New Russian Socialism', allowing small-scale capitalism to work for the development of Russian industry.\n\nThe opposition argues that Russia already has the sufficient industrial base to transfer into an entirely socially managed production with economic planning, and while these kinds of half-measures might have been needed in the 1920s, they are not relevant to today's Russia. Instead, they are like an anchor that the new revolutionary republic is dragging on her back, slowing down her journey towards true communism."
 socrus.326.a: "You make valid points, Aleksandr."
 socrus.326.b: "This is for the good of all of Russia, whether you like it or not."

 socrus.328.t: "The Dvoika"
 socrus.328.d: "Despite Lev Kamenev's leadership of the All-Russian Union of Labour, no one considers him the sole ruler. In almost equal part, Grigory Zinovyev has been acting as the leader - not just as Kamenev's right hand, but like a co-emperor of old. In a way, this dynamic is necessary, as the two men appeal to quite different audiences. Kamenev can command the loyalties of the VST moderates, those who were previously behind Levitsky. He is the moderating and managing force that keeps the government stable. But he has little mass appeal - which Zinovyev has to a great degree. He is a brash populist, with his speeches drawing great crowds.\n\nZinovyev's rhetoric has always been harsh, and it is particularly electrifying to the radical grassroots of the communist movement: those who demand action, not bureaucracy. Together these two men can play both the party and the people, but it is already in the air that the radicals may not be happy with this state of affairs."
 socrus.328.a: "Well, surely the power of friendship must be stronger than this... right?"
 RUS_dvoika_minigame_begins: "Though the pair is united in friendship, they differ greatly in their views, being polar opposites of each other.\n\nWhile Lev Kamenev leads the §Rmoderate§! tendency within the §oCommunists§!, Grigory Zinovyev gathers more §ofierce§! and §oradical§! elements. As of now, the §Rmoderates§! have the upper hand, but that won't be the case forever.\n\nThe increasing §Rradicalism§! may be beneficial in the long term, but going too far will have §oconsequences§! for Kamenev."

 socrus.329.t: "The Rise of the People's Dictator"
 socrus.329.d: "Tension between the VST's more radical base and Kamenev's moderate measures has finally reached the breaking point. The old guiding vision behind the Union - that of cooperation between all Russian revolutionaries - is all but forgotten, and a new, more radical breed of communism has triumphed in Russian politics. It is greatly driven by the continuing counter-revolutionary opposition and the siege mentality that our republic is under, stoked by the likes of Zinovyev and Gronsky.\n\nAs the popular mood has changed, so has the composition of the Soviets, which has turned the Congress constantly more radical. The process has not been entirely democratic, as ever-increasing numbers of people have been barred from elected positions on the grounds of counter-revolutionary sympathies. In the current mood, it is quite clear that Kamenev's personal influence falls woefully short compared to Zinovyev's gravitas in this new situation. In a friendly backroom deal, an agreement was made for the sake of the stability of the republic. Kamenev would retire from party leadership and not contest Zinovyev's candidacy in the following inter-party election, but he would instead gain an important organisational position in the regime and more or less continue running the matters of state. Zinovyev, never a man interested in such matters, was more than happy to accept such a compromise."
 socrus.329.a: "Grishka finally found himself on top."

 socrus.330.t: "The People's Ministry of Industry and Trade"
 socrus.330.d: "After the Chairman-Minister and the Minister of Internal Affairs, the People's Minister of Industry and Trade is the third most prestigious and influential cabinet post and wields considerable sway over economic policy.\n\nA planning-focused economist like Stanislav Strumilin would be our own man, but would not be taken well by our coalition. Our allies to the right have suggested Aleksandr Finn-Yenotayevsky - a proponent of a mixed economy. The Esers have put forward Boris Kamkov, more as a token of goodwill in the Workers' Coalition rather than as a proponent of specific economic policy."

 socrus.331.d: "As internationalists at heart, it is of great importance how our interests are presented and furthered in the world at large. While almost everyone in the Workers' Coalition supports the World Revolution and international cooperation, there are obvious differences.\n\nGrigory Zinovyev's fierce rhetoric and past tenure in the International Congresses has already made him well-known for his elaborate visions of the International's future, and Russia's tireless work to foment revolutions in our neighbouring countries. Less jingoistic options would include blander, experienced diplomats like Matvey Skobelev or the Socialist-Revolutionary Vladimir Karelin. The fourth candidate being pushed is Rafail Abramovich of the Right Faction, whose view on world revolution is rather focused on world cooperation - instead of arms, we will guide our neighbours into socialism with help and development, not by blood."

 socrus.332.t: "The People's Ministry of Agriculture"
 socrus.332.d: "At the heart of the Workers' Coalition there are radically different views on how to approach the so-called 'Agrarian Question'. The Socialist-Revolutionaries already expect to gain the post, as the self-declared defenders of the rural folk - and in all fairness, there are few parties in Russia with more experience and knowledge about the Russian countryside than the SRs. Ilya Mayorov, Spiridonova's husband, is the obvious candidate - a matter-of-fact agrarian economist and avowed 'peasant communist', who would see Russian peasantry elevated into socialism not through coercion but through material development.\n\nSergey Dubrovsky is drastically different and represents the view of much of the VST - the Russian countryside must be dragged into modernity by force, through massive industrial projects and growth of the provincial cities. As a more balanced candidate, the famed Communist theorist Nikolay Bukharin, supported by the Right Faction as a moderate, would prefer more natural advancement of the countryside - and economy as a whole - rather than its forceful direction."

We have a number of contenders - extremely science-oriented men like Aleksey Gastev, or full-on atheist crusaders like Tsaritsyn's Sergey Minin.

Grigory Maksimov's syndicalists have also left the sinking ship, now acting as an independent group. The parliamentary chaos led to the only possible outcome: Premier Levitsky being voted out.

 ### VST Civil War ###
 socrus.350.t: "The Zinovyev Manifesto"
 socrus.350.d: "The honeymoon of the VST is over, and as daily political questions require constant compromises, some have grown increasingly disillusioned with Levitsky's leadership. What began as sectarian complaining has turned into a full-scale ultimatum, as Grigory Zinovyev and 17 other communists from the Left-VST gave Levitsky's government a warning: they have little trust in the current political direction, and if their demands - backed by the proletariat of Russia - are not met, they will withdraw their support from Levitsky and the VST. This threat could, at worst, lead to the collapse of the Workers' Coalition and the VST.\n\nThe demands focus on ending the 'permanent state of compromise with bourgeois forces'. They demand a transition into a fully planned economy and the ban of remaining private enterprise, state atheism, the removal of reactionary parties such as the Socialist-Democratic Union from Soviets and the Congress, increased powers for the People's Militias and further investigations into the military to remove old republic-era generals who may harbour anti-socialist sentiments. The manifesto is also supported by Sverdlov's party. It is obvious that accepting the demands would be full capitulation to the left wing of the VST, and would almost certainly lead to a split of the right wing. But many of the demands have support among the socialists, even in Levitsky's own faction of the party. The manifesto is being distributed in the streets of major cities as we speak, as field organisations supportive of Zinovyevite arguments are mobilising."

 socrus.351.t: "Sulimov's Strike"
 socrus.351.d: "The operation would be popularly called 'Sulimov's Strike', after Sulimov ordered the Minister of Internal Affairs Andrey Vyshinsky to organise the mass arrest of members of the RKP(b). The plans had been drafted for weeks, with VGPU agents shadowing the Bolshevik party members and learning their routines. Last night Blyumkin gave the orders, and a series of arrests were made. Before the sun rose above the tips of the Kremlin, the VGPU had arrested Sverdlov, Stalin, Gastev, Ryutin, and a number of other key RKP(b) figures, with only occasional resistance and a single casualty. The Communist Party leadership has been accused of conspiracy to undermine Soviet democracy and the Constitution, and for plotting together with elements of the military to overthrow the legal government. It must be said that the charges stretched the government's credibility thin, as many understood that this was obviously a political purge - though those who believed in the conspiracy were enough to at least allow the purge to happen.\n\nThe sentencing was reasonably merciful. Most were sent to internal exile in Siberian provinces, essentially removed from national politics. Few received prison sentences, and none would be shot. Despite vehement protests in the Congress, Levitsky's government had successfully eliminated the RKP(b) as a political force, at least for now, and in doing so deprived the Zinovyevites of their main ally."
 socrus.351.a: "Dzerzhinsky would be proud."

 socrus.352.t: "Rebellion of the Left"
 socrus.352.d.rebellion: "The ultimatum was not followed. In a grand public event in Moscow, Zinovyev addressed his supporters organising protests against the government. He declared that it was revealed to everyone that Premier Vladimir Osipovich was not interested in hearing the calls of the common worker, but rather cooperated with champagne socialists and bourgeois turned red. Quickly the meeting became the foundational Congress of the All-Russian Communist Workers' Party (VKTP) as Zinovyev called for the true communists to boycott the VST and instead join his movement. Most of the Left-VST followed suit, while others such as Kamenev retired from their posts rather than being forced to choose between the Workers' Coalition and Zinovyev's new party.\n\nThis leaves Levitsky in charge of a rump VST, and with the left it also lost a sizeable number of field organisations and labour unions. Seizing the opportunity, the Socialist-Revolutionaries demanded to renegotiate the current government programme, in practice extorting us to include more of their demands in exchange for their continued support. At least the Danists chose to maintain loyalty to Levitsky's leadership, though as they now comprise almost half of VST's group in the Congress, they naturally demand more say in policymaking. With this pressure, it would be easier for Levitsky to simply resign and hand the power to Fyodor Dan and the right - though others in his advising circle strongly advise him to continue regardless."
 socrus.352.d.expulsion: "The ultimatum was not followed. Instead, Levitsky demanded Zinovyev and others fall back in line and bring these matters up in the party conference, to be negotiated and voted on properly, not through mob justice and brinkmanship. As Zinovyevites refused to budge, they were expelled from the party en masse, and they were soon organising a new party for themselves. Thus was born the All-Russian Communist Workers' Party (VKTP), as Zinovyev called for the true communists to boycott the VST and instead join his movement. Most of the Left-VST followed suit, while others such as Kamenev retired from their posts rather than be forced to choose between the Workers' Coalition and Zinovyev's new party.\n\nThis leaves Levitsky in charge of a rump VST, and with the left it also lost a sizeable number of field organisations and labour unions.

With this pressure, it would be easier for Levitsky to simply resign and hand the power to Fyodor Dan and the right - though others in his advising circle strongly advise him to continue regardless."
 socrus.352.d.coalition: "Our relations with the Left Faction have only been worsening, and now they have reached a critical impasse. Grigory Zinovyev and his allies have denounced [ROOT.GetLeader]'s policies and declared their intent to found their own party for all true socialists. Thus was born the All-Russian Communist Workers' Party (VKTP).\n\nThis leaves us in charge of a rump VST, and with the left it also lost a sizeable number of field organisations and labour unions. At least internal party politics should be much easier now that the opposition is gone."
 socrus.352.a: "We are still flying two-thirds of a ship."

 socrus.353.t: "Rebellion of the Right"
 socrus.353.d.rebellion: "After internal discussions among the Danists, they have come to a tragic conclusion: they informed Levitsky that they cannot support the Premier's 'total capitulation to Bolshevik demands', and they argue that with the path that Levitsky has chosen, he will merely repeat the Bolshevik mistakes and betray the working people. The oft-repeated Menshevik mantra of 'socialism through democracy' was once again quoted. Zinovyev's method of forcing socialism will only turn workers against it, and require the creation of a bureaucratic police state that governs not through workers' democracy but through intimidation. Dan, Abramovich, and a number of other Mensheviks have declared their intent to re-create the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party as a way to restore Russian socialism to its idealistic foundations, and serve as a constructive opposition rather than supporters of Levitsky.\n\nThis leaves Levitsky in charge of a rump VST, and with the right it also lost support of many moderates among the party bureaucracy and trade unions. This has left us even more at the mercy of the Left faction, as they now comprise almost half of the VST's Congress representatives. They seem satisfied for now, but it is likely that the left will continue dictating the direction of the Levitsky government. It might be a more honourable option for Levitsky to simply retire, and perhaps allow the VST to rebuild its ranks with Kamenev's leadership - though the war is anything but lost."
 socrus.353.d.coalition: "Our relations with the Right Faction have only been worsening, and now they have reached a critical impasse. The Danists have resigned en masse from their positions in the party, declaring their intent to re-create the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party as a way to restore Russian socialism to its idealistic foundations.\n\nThis leaves us in charge of a rump VST, and with the right it also lost support of many moderates among the party bureaucracy and trade unions. At least internal party politics should be much easier now that the opposition is gone."
 socrus.353.a: "We are still flying two-thirds of a ship."

 socrus.354.t: "An Agreement to Save the Workers' Coalition"
 socrus.354.d: "A backroom deal was made between the main factions of the party. Kamenev acted as an intermediary between the right and left factions, while Zinovyev stuck true to his claims that Levitsky had been tolerating bourgeois socialists in the party. In the end, Kamenev and Levitsky made some token concessions: counter-revolutionary laws would be tightened, and subsidies were to be given to the urban workers.\n\nWhile in practice this meant little, for Zinovyev it meant a victorious negotiation - and for the right faction, who were more privy to Levitsky and Kamenev's attitude towards the matter, felt that things had worked out for them too."
 socrus.354.a: "Diversity in opinion, unity in action."

 socrus.355.t: "Experiment in Blanquism"
 socrus.355.d: "As the days of the VST - and the whole of the Workers' Coalition - seem to be numbered, secret discussions have already begun by high-ranking government members. Premier Levitsky himself seems resigned to his fate - if the Party votes him out, he will respect that outcome and likely retire from politics. But not everyone in the VST is willing to give up the fight. This Group for Defence of the Revolution is gathered around Daniil Sulimov, and it includes multiple ministers, key personnel from the VST, the military, and even some from the PSR.\n\nThe scenario, as Sulimov put it, is the collapse of the revolutionary government. Once Levitsky is ousted, he argues, the VST will fail as its different factions either vie for power or split to form their own parties. At best, this puts the power in the hands of Socialist-Revolutionaries. At worst, this creates paralysis and enables the counter-revolutionaries across the country to seize the initiative, and perhaps even organise rebellions.\n\nThus, he argues, it is imperative to centralise power temporarily. Mikhail Tukhachevsky, present at the meeting, fully agreed with Sulimov's analysis of the situation. In his eyes, Russia should now put all effort into preparing for the final, revolutionary war, and only restore elections after that. With backing of the military, Sulimov would have open hands to act."
 socrus.355.a: "Is he walking in Lenin's footsteps?"

 socrus.356.t: "Demands from the Danists"
 socrus.356.d: "Abramovich and Dan have sought to keep their faction outside the worst political conflicts, but as rhetoric has grown harsher on both sides, they have been forced to join the fray. Together with a number of Esers, the Danists released a group statement expressing worry over the state of our democratic republic and the willingness of certain circles to maintain that in the future.\n\nConsequently, people have been demanding Levitsky's government to put a stop to electoral intimidation and the continuing infiltration of the People's Militias by those who seem to be more loyal to Lenin and Zinovyev than the current republic and its elected leadership."
 socrus.356.a: "For God's sake!"

 socrus.357.t: "Break-up with the SDS"
 socrus.357.d: "The Socialist-Democratic Union (SDS) was always the least revolutionary part of the Workers' Coalition, and we received much criticism for treating these reformists as equal partners in building socialism. We tried, but ultimately, our differences were too great.\n\nGergard Zeller, the Chairman of the party, blamed [GetSecondInCommand]'s ideological fanaticism in a speech to his supporters."
 socrus.357.a: "Sad."

 socrus.358.t: "War over the Central Committee"
 socrus.358.d: "The demands continue for a reshuffling of the Central Committee of the VST, normally elected every year by the membership. The Zinovyevites have been putting immense pressure on a few individuals to resign from the Committee so that their seats would be put to a vote - a vote the Left faction is organising to win.\n\nAnd it is working: the Central Committee has turned into a haven of scheming, as cabinet deals are made, betting on the future of the party and with whom to side. If this is allowed to continue, the Zinovyevists will likely manage to gain new allies or pressure some of the old guard Mensheviks to resign. While we should not meddle with these decisions, sometimes one must put their foot down and calm the party."
 socrus.358.a: "Stay above the scheming."
 socrus.358.b: "Do not accept resignations nor new appointments."

 socrus.359.t: "Levitsky Meets Kamenev"
 socrus.359.d: "In many ways, the VST is a creation of two men, Levitsky and Kamenev. It was Levitsky who guided the Mensheviks back to a more revolutionary philosophy, and it was Kamenev who was able to persuade at least part of the Bolsheviks back into the popular front. But now it is all under threat.\n\nLevitsky's hope is that Kamenev, who is very close to Zinovyev, could act as mediator between them and attempt to defuse the situation somehow. Kamenev was sceptical, warning of Zinovyev's ambition and stubbornness, and that he can try, but that is all. He refused to publicly take a side - he is still respected as the leader of the left wing of the party, and the fear is that if he supported Levitsky, it would only lead to Zinovyev's voice growing louder as the spokesman for the radicals in VST.\n\nInstead, Kamenev promised to mediate in case Levitsky fulfils at least some of the demands - not to entertain Zinovyev's ambition, but to show that the party leadership is responsive to the demands from the ground. After all, is it not merely a Zinovyevite claim that the current leadership exists in an ivory tower, acting as the intelligentsia and detached from the reality of the working man?"
 socrus.359.a: "We must give them something, then."
 socrus.359.b: "... or seize apparatus of the state."

 socrus.360.t: "To Protect the Revolution"
 socrus.360.d: "The informal 'young guard' of Levitsky's supporters, the Group for Defence of the Revolution, centred around Daniil Sulimov, has seized power. After Premier Levitsky's resignation, Sulimov's government carried out a bureaucratic coup. The 'Sulimovites' took over major positions within the VST by utilising their control over the executive branch, declared a state of emergency, and dismissed the Congress temporarily.\n\nThere were vehement protests from all the factions of the Workers' Coalition, both from the VST and the Socialist-Revolutionaries. But none of it seriously threatened Sulimov's power grab, as he very quickly started to normalise the situation, and kept many members of the other factions in their positions.\n\nIn fact, in the first radio speech by Sulimov, he called for unity and explained that his government saw it as their responsibility to maintain the stability of the Republic in the face of political turmoil, but by no means do they wish to take power for themselves. Quite the contrary, he declared that the All-Russian Union of Labour would be organised around its goal - defending the revolution and its acheivements - rather than any ideology or dogma. Anyone, regardless of their political affiliation, who shares this goal is an ally."
 socrus.360.a: "Our mission is the revolution; nothing more, nothing less."

 #VST Other
 socrus.361.t: "Socialism through Innovation"
 socrus.361.d: "Plenty in the VST see education purely as a tool to benefit the lives of the workers. To that end, they see many soft sciences as pointless, and believe the focus should solely be on more hard sciences, such as engineering - after all, how can philosophy and other social sciences seriously contribute to the worker's livelihood?\n\nThe view is generally contested by many in the right faction. While they agree with the premise, they believe that such ideologisation of the universities is a restriction of academic freedom, and would prefer to keep things as they are. Naturally, the hard sciences should be encouraged either way, but the question is if this remains a matter of policy or mere suggestion."
 socrus.361.a: "Let's tone things down a bit."
 socrus.361.b: "Education must be ideologised."

 socrus.362.t: "Defection of the Former Centre"
 socrus.362.d.left: "The moderate wing of our party - the syndicalists around Sulimov and Shlyapnikov - has revealed itself to be as traitorous as we expected. After constant bickering between [ROOT.GetLeader] and the right, a rift too wide has finally opened, and organisations and unions controlled by them are withdrawing their support for our policies.\n\nInstead, they have organised as 'The Union Opposition Group', representing labour unions free from control of the 'Zinovyevite demagogues'."
 socrus.362.d.right: "The left wing of our party - the syndicalists around Sulimov and Shlyapnikov, former disciples of Levitsky - have not been taking our policies well. After constant bickering with [ROOT.GetLeader]'s government, they have finally broken ties with us, claiming that we are moderating the gains of the revolution away.\n\nThey have formed 'the Revolutionary Opposition Group', seeking to maintain Russia's course towards inevitable communism."
 socrus.362.a: "Good riddance."
 socrus.362.b: "We can't lose them!"

 #Kamenev Union Law Eventchain
 socrus.363.t: "The Unionist Demands"
 socrus.363.d: "As the protests ensued, the government could not sit idle and do nothing. Obviously, the Unions opposed any interference; however, they did not see that it was actually needed. Unnecessary divisions within unions only caused bureaucracy to soar and be overly complicated. Originally a body that was supposed to represent and protect the workers, it instead turned into a malfunctioning organisation that was only able to promise but not to do much. At least, that was Lev Kamenev's take on the issue. His reforms had a reason, and it was to fix the existing problems bit by bit. However, the unions, currently united under the Union Opposition, led by the chairman of the VTsSPS, Mikhail Tomsky, did not share that view.\n\nAs such, Kamenev decided to take the initiative and invited Tomsky to sit at the table and negotiate in Petrograd. Tomsky presented an endless list of demands, starting from the promise of union independence and ending with increased funding for them. Kamenev knew he would not be able to fulfil all their wishes, especially with Zinovyev on his back. Just as Lev Borisovich was supposed to reply, a message came from Moscow, saying that the leader was urgently needed at a government meeting. Unfortunately for Tomsky, the Chairman had to leave the negotiations he arranged.\n\nAfter a quick train to Moscow, Lev Kamenev arrived at the government meeting, which soon turned into a heated debate on how to tackle the protests and, more importantly, if they should revert the recently enacted laws. With the debate not nearing its end, Grigory Zinovyev took Kamenev aside to his office. 'How could you do this, Lev, how could you go behind my back like that?' he started. Before Kamenev was able to utter a single word, Zinovyev continued: 'It no longer matters. The party leadership announced a crisis meeting. All because you refused to work with me. Let's just hope old Volodya will not cause any problems. As for you, I will try my best to fix your incompetence.' As Grigory Yevseyevich was leaving the room, Lev Borisovich spoke to him:"
 socrus.363.a: "Grisha, you didn't even allow me to try."

 socrus.364.t: "The Elders Debacle"
 socrus.364.d: "With the protests still ongoing, Vladimir Levitsky, seeing no action from the central government, decided to take matters into his own hands and organised the VST leadership emergency meeting in the Moscow party headquarters. With the rioters just outside the windows, soon the most important leaders of each faction arrived: Fyodor Dan of the Danists, Daniil Sulimov of the Internationalists, and finally Lev Kamenev and Grigory Zinovyev of the Communists. Even though Levitsky no longer holds any position, he still has some respect within the party. As such, all those figures, even those within the government itself, decided to attend.\n\nThe meeting was opened by Vladimir Osipovich, who stated that the unions are a backbone of the new Russian society and that their voice must be heard. After praising Lev for his attempts at negotiation, he turned to stating the need for some of the laws to be revoked. Dan agreed with Levitsky, stating that some unions need to be guided; however, they must remain independent. Zinovyev soon spoke on how the unions became corrupt and some were even unnecessary. To him, centralisation was just inevitable. Kamenev tried to expand on this thought, stating that it might be better for the country and the budget as a whole; however, he was soon interrupted by Dan. The old Menshevik began to talk about how centralisation was against the founding principles of the Republic. He even pointed out that Maria Spiridonova would never allow this. Soon Zinovyev replied by suggesting to just remove Mikhail Tomsky from his post. As the two opposing leaders constantly exchanged heated words, Levitsky and the tired Kamenev found themselves caught in that fire.\n\nSuddenly, Vladimir Levitsky raised his voice, ordered the two to stop, and pointed out to Lev Borisovich to make a decision. Should they give in and revoke the laws? Or should they just ignore Tomsky and wait for the situation to calm down?"
 socrus.364.a: "Do we even have a choice here?"
 socrus.364.b: "Once Tomsky's tantrum ends, everything will return to normal."
 RUS_zinovyev_warning_tt: "§YThis option might end up badly for Kamenev's reputation.§!"

 socrus.365.t: "Rumours from Under the Table"
 socrus.365.d: "After Kamenev made his decision to revoke the controversial legislation, the situation seemed to have calmed down somewhat. However, Lev Kamenev did not seem to have totally backed down from his ideas. With the help of Levitsky, he attempted to preserve his policies in some form, albeit a significantly weakened one. However, with Fyodor Dan and his faction being adamant in their position, Lev Borisovich had no other choice but to surrender his laws.\n\nAs the scrapping of the laws was discussed by the higher-ups, those further down the hierarchy began to speculate about what will happen now. One such theory is that Grigory Zinovyev, Kamenev's face, ally, and most importantly, friend, did not take kindly to Lev's decision and is now plotting to have him removed. During a meeting, Sergey Medvedev notified the leader about those rumors; however, Lev Kamenev did not seem to care or worry about them.\n\nSoon, another rumour started circulating, more serious and dangerous than the other. While initially, Mikhail Tomsky seemed pleased by Kamenev's decision to kill his legislation, he's not so happy about Lev's cooperation with the Danists. However, Zinovyev came with a solution to deal with it - a deal he had struck with Frunze. The army will support the government no matter what, and should any protests erupt, they are ready to react. While Lev Borisovich thanked Grigory for the deal, he did not think it was necessary. After all, why would you shoot down a peaceful protest?"
 socrus.365.a: "Let us hope it won't end like in 1905."

 socrus.366.t: "Voices All Around"
 socrus.366.d: "The situation the VST is facing now was far from peaceful. Theories about Zinovyev, the army ready to attack, a displeased Tomsky, and the Internationalists slowly withdrawing their support. This all surely caused Kamenev to doubt his current course. But it was not like he could turn back now.\n\nSoon, however, it was all about to go down, as Mikhail Tomsky and Aleksandr Shlyapnikov released a joint statement. In it, they were condemning the cooperation of the government with the Danists, arguing that the Unions will all be victims of it. 'We have union democracy for now, but allowing Dan's reforms to pass will be a step back towards capitalist tsarism'.\n\nThe next blow came from the Zinovyevite unionists. Sergey Medvedev expressed his disappointment in the government, how oblivious it is to trust Dan and to go with his proposals. In private discussions between Kamenev and a dissatisfied Zinovyev, the latter echoed the sentiment: how many comrades would need to express their criticisms before he would listen? The army also seemed to back out from their deal. After a short moment of silence, the comrades renewed their regular work, despite it being obvious that nothing had been solved."
 socrus.366.a: "Sometimes trying to please everyone can end up badly."

 socrus.367.t: "Assassins"
 socrus.367.d: "A few days have passed since the Unionist announcements, but the situation did not get any clearer. In order to meet with the unions, they demanded that Kamenev end any cooperation he had with the Danists. While he wanted to, he feared that backing out now would lead to neither the amendments nor repeals passing in the assembly. The situation was truly a stalemate. But one man would soon break it - Grigory Zinovyev.\n\nZinovyev, during one of his regular meetings with Kamenev, decided to bring up the issue of the unrest once again. He proposed a solution to this problem, but Lev Borisovich immediately refused it. A full centralisation, like he proposed during the party meeting, is another extreme that in Lev's eyes would get them in even bigger trouble. What Kamenev needed now was a solution to just please everyone, but at this moment, it was impossible.\n\nUpon hearing that, Grigory Yevseyevich quickly stood from his chair. In a very irritated tone, he began ranting about how Lev's choices put them in this situation in the first place. He then began to question Kamenev's cooperation with Dan, arguing that it was reckless and reminding him that the unions hate Dan for his policies. Kamenev quickly responded that without his support, he would not even have the numbers to do anything, but Grigory quickly interrupted him. He stated that he has all the numbers: the army, the Bolsheviks, even some Esers, but most importantly the majority of the Communist faction. While Lev was making deals with the wrong people, Grigory made deals with the right ones. Kamenev could not utter a single word. Soon, Grigory gave Lev Borisovich a choice: do it his way or face downfall in the assembly. He has the numbers to do that too. After a brief moment of silence, Kamenev agreed. Soon, any cooperation and laws drafted by the Danists were scrapped, and any resistance would not mean anything."
 socrus.367.a: "Is plotting against your friend the right thing to do?"

 socrus.368.t: "The Finishing Blow"
 socrus.368.d: "While the dust settled, Comrade Kamenev issued the creation of a special commission in the Congress, tasked with drafting legislation just as Zinovyev wanted it to be. In a fiery speech, Fyodor Dan expressed that he and his faction will have nothing to do with this. The Internationalists joined the Commission but were quickly sidelined.\n\nAfter some time, the policy was ready to be voted on. It envisioned the merger of all unions into one great union, formally independent from the central government. Union leadership, however, will have to go through an investigation by the 'Anti-Savinkovite Lustration Office', which will determine whether or not they collaborated with the Pale Horse's regime. That way, this new Union will be truly loyal to Grigory Yevseyevich himself.\n\nWhen this legislation was finally introduced to the Congress, it was met with fierce resistance from Danists and the SRs. At this point, however, it did not matter, and after weak protests, the VST-Right and SR deputies left the hall. Finally, the commission passed with a slight majority of votes. All in favour were: The Communists of the VST, The Maximalists of the SRs, the RKP(b), and parts of The Internationalists of the VST. SDS deputies immediately reacted by attempting to issue a vote of no confidence, but it was too late. In a brief press statement, Mikhail Tomsky admitted defeat and asked the unions for forgiveness. Lev Kamenev, silent and withdrawn, briefly congratulated his friend before locking himself in his office."
 socrus.368.a: "Grishka finally succeeded, but at what cost?"

 socrus.369.t: "Sulimov's Offer"
 socrus.369.d: "The protests did not seem to end, as Mikhail Tomsky was relentless in his opposition. Soon, he threatened a general strike if that was deemed necessary to pressure Kamenev. After hearing what happened at the party headquarters, Daniil Sulimov decided to ask Lev Kamenev for a meeting. He proposed to meet with Tomsky while he would act as a mediator. Kamenev hesitated for a while, but soon replied that Grigory Zinovyev must also be present, as a representative of his government. Comrade Sulimov replied by arguing that Zinovyev's temper and reputation might hinder the negotiations; but after Kamenev's insistence, Sulimov relented.\n\nSoon they were joined by the Chairman-Minister himself. When he heard about the proposition, he agreed, but only on one condition: that he will be the one handling the negotiations. This was a red line for Sulimov, and an argument broke out with Zinovyev. With no end to this, Kamenev had to make yet another decision."
 socrus.369.a: "The negotiations must be overseen by Zinovyev."
 socrus.369.b: "Comrade Sulimov is right; only compromise might get us out of this mess."

 socrus.370.t: "Zinovyev's Proposal"
 socrus.370.d: "Kamenev's decision left Daniil Sulimov agitated and disappointed. Tomsky was notified of the proposed negotiations, but learning about Zinovyev being the one handling them caused him to refuse any attempts. With the situation getting out of hand, Zinovyev decided that the time for negotiation was over; it was time to strike. His plan was to create one united trade union, loyal to the state and the government. Its leadership would be handpicked by Zinovyev so that it wouldn't cause any problems in the future. Kamenev was left speechless - he countered by reminding him how such legislation would have no chance of passing the Congress.\n\nHowever, Chairman-Minister Zinovyev tried to reassure Lev Borisovich that he might have a card hidden up his sleeve. Kamenev tried to argue that maybe there might be something that would please Tomsky, but to little success."
 socrus.370.a: "There must be a way to speak to Tomsky."
 socrus.370.b: "Okay Grishka, show your deck."

 socrus.371.t: "Swords and Quills"
 socrus.371.d: "Zinovyev's plan had two aspects: diversion and fear. First, he would order the army to organise exercises near the hotspots of the protests, such as Petrograd. Next, he would organise counter-protests with the help of the RKP(b). Lastly, Sergey Medvedev would try to use his influence to discourage some unions from protesting. Lev Kamenev thought about it for a while, but he did not see any other option.\n\nAs such, the plan was put into action. Grigory Zinovyev quickly wrote to Frunze about the planned exercises. Then, members of the RKP(b), supported by some of the Communists, would give out flyers criticising the unions and organise rallies, while Medvedev contacted his colleagues. Soon, some protests around Moscow started to fade, but the conflict was not over."
 socrus.371.a: "Sometimes even words are stronger than guns."

 socrus.372.t: "A Parry"
 socrus.372.d: "Frunze's reply was not the one that Kamenev and Zinovyev had hoped for: Frunze refused to take any part in the plan. As it turned out, the counter-measures failed as well; people stopped attending Bolshevik rallies, and the situation in Moscow was tense once again. Medvedev also failed to convince any of his colleagues. With that in mind, Kamenev tried to persuade Zinovyev to start negotiating with Tomsky, but he continued to stubbornly refuse. Zinovyev assured Kamenev that he still had a Plan C. By using his influence in Petrograd, he would weaken Tomsky's position and create an opening for them to pass his legislation. Kamenev made no objections.\n\nZinovyev eagerly made countless meetings in Petrograd with his contacts, and a number of unionists faded away from the public outcry. Tomsky did not want to back down, but his circle started pressuring him to give in - or even resign altogether. After their return, both Grigory and Lev worked relentlessly to gather support within their faction, the radical Esers, and some of the Internationalists."
 socrus.372.a: "Not the most righteous move, but an efficient one."

 socrus.373.t: "Counter-Offer"
 socrus.373.d: "Kamenev was relentless in his views concerning Zinovyev's proposal. He came up with an idea to centralise all trade unions into the VTsSPS, as a concession not to the unions, but to Tomsky himself. During one of their regular meetings, Lev Borisovich laid out his idea before Grigory and, to his surprise, Zinovyev agreed. The Premier, however, had his own agenda in it.\n\nTomsky finally agreed to negotiate, and soon the three of them met in the Kremlin's Senate Palace. Comrade Kamenev began by stating that his policies would remain in place, which obviously upset the VTsSPS Chairman. When Kamenev framed his proposal in a way that was beneficial for Tomsky, however, the latter was finally on board. On top of that, he promised to call off the protests and urge his colleagues from other unions to do the same."
 socrus.373.a: "Tomsky got a carrot, and the Unions got a stick."

 socrus.374.t: "Inner Coup"
 socrus.374.d: "As promised, all the riots stopped in major cities. But soon after, shocking news came from the VTsSPS' central committee, as the current Chairman, Mikhail Tomsky, was just removed from office. Not long after, the news reached the Kremlin and put Lev Kamenev in a state of shock, as his newly struck deal seemed to be under question. Zinovyev, on the other hand, did not seem as surprised, which made Kamenev suspicious. Elections for Chairmanship were organised in the VTsSPS, with only two candidates coming out on top: Aleksandr Shlyapnikov and Sergey Medvedev.\n\nComrade Medvedev is known for his undying loyalty to Comrade Zinovyev, which may be his greatest asset for the Dvoika, but may also be his greatest obstacle to becoming Chairman. Comrade Shlyapnikov, on the other hand, is known for his independence and loyalty only to the unions; however, he might accept the same deal made to Tomsky. As the election progressed, Zinovyev approached Kamenev with an offer: to ensure the VTsSPS' loyalty once and for all, he would pull some strings and help Medvedev win. Kamenev was hesitant, but after a while, he replied:"
 socrus.374.a: "After all we've been through, we must ensure the VTsSPS' loyalty."
 socrus.374.b: "No Grisha, we are better than this."

 socrus.375.t: "Petrograd's Triumph"
 socrus.375.d: "Surprisingly, Sergey Medvedev won the election and became the Chairman of the VTsSPS. In his inaugural speech, he expressed the necessity for the Unions to work with the government, as they are an integral part of it, like one big organism. With his ally on top of the biggest union, Grigory Zinovyev decided to press Kamenev again for his vision on the Union Bill. Kamenev expressed initial opposition, but realised that he was in check, and with that, he gave his blessing for the legislation.\n\nA commission was created in the Congress and the Law was quickly drafted just how Grigory dictated it. In that time, Medvedev stated that this bill is what the Unions needed and what would allow the state to function properly. No other union decided to speak about this legislation. Soon the Law was passed, with a majority of: VST-Left, parts of VST-Centre, SR-Maximalists and RKP(b). Sergey Medvedev was kept as the Chairman of the VTsSPS and the law allowed him to effectively purge any resistance he had in the Union. The remaining opponents spoke of a coup by the 'Petrograd clique' led by 'King Grishka the Third', but soon all voices were silent. They were right, however, for Grigory Zinovyev could feel like a king, with the largest organisation in Russia under his thumb."
 socrus.375.a: "Will Grigory turn out to be a cruel ruler?"

 socrus.376.t: "The Metalworkers' Triumph"
 socrus.376.d: "As everyone expected, Aleksandr Shlyapnikov won and became the Chairman of the VTsSPS. In his inauguration speech, he applauded his predecessors' work for the Unions and expressed the need to continue pressuring the government, not as an opponent, but as an ally. He soon met with Kamenev and Zinovyev and declared his support for a deal they struck with Tomsky.\n\nAnd as such, the commission was created in the Congress. The new Law on Unions will envision the major centralisation of the unions into the VTsSPS under Shlyapnikov's leadership. With some necessary amendments, the legislation was easily passed with the votes of the VST-Left, VST-Centre and all of the SRs. After the vote, Zinovyev briefly congratulated Kamenev and commented on his right choices and intuition."
 socrus.376.a: "Did the Dvoika just turn into a Troika?"

 socrus.377.t: "In the Great Halls of Petrograd"
 socrus.377.d: "With the green light given to Sulimov, he quickly contacted Mikhail Tomsky. The VTsSPS Chairman agreed on negotiations and proposed one of Petrograd's Metalworks Factory Hall as a site for the meeting. Tomsky, alongside Aleksandr Shlyapnikov, represented the Unions' Opposition; Lev Kamenev and Grigory Zinovyev represented the government, and Daniil Sulimov acted as a mediator.\n\nThe first issue on the table was union independence. Tomsky and Shlyapnikov demanded that, as an act of goodwill, the government would reassure the independence of the unions in the new Law. With that, Kamenev threw a counter-demand: soft centralisation of the unions. He argued that this was purely a measure to reduce excessive bureaucracy. He then went on to lay out the plan for centralisation, which would see smaller trade unions integrated into the biggest of Russia, with the VTsSPS as the main beneficiary. Comrade Shlyapnikov was outraged by this idea; however, Comrade Tomsky showed interest in it. Aleksandr, full of anger, left the hall, while condemning this whole act of 'treason'. Tomsky, unmoved by his colleague, agreed to the whole proposal."
 socrus.377.a: "Did Tomsky just bow out of fear or out of greed?"

 socrus.378.t: "Mikhail the Bent"
 socrus.378.d: "The negotiations with Mikhail Tomsky continued and soon bore fruit in the project of the Law on the Unions. With that, the Chairman of the VTsSPS called off all strikes and jointly with Kamenev and Zinovyev presented the legislation before the Congress.\n\nAs the bill was being discussed, Vasily Zhilin, an SR deputy, raised concerns about Tomsky's credibility. He argued that the bill mostly benefits him and his union, the VTsSPS. He was soon echoed by Nikolay Oglanovsky of the SDS, who added that this policy might be the 'opening act' of Zinovyev's rise to power, with the Bolsheviks. Tomsky, in his speech, refuted all the claims by commenting on Kamenev's anti-bureaucracy argument. After his speech, Aleksandr Shlyapnikov stepped on the podium and announced that he would urge all members of the VTsSPS to remove Tomsky from Chairmanship after he sold himself to the Dvoika.\n\nHearing that, in a secluded space, Kamenev pleaded with Zinovyev to use his influence in Petrograd to save Tomsky, and with him, their bill. Zinovyev, to Lev's surprise, refused. The vote on the bill was postponed, as the Congress wished to wait for the new leadership of VTsSPS to be chosen."
 socrus.378.a: "Is there even any point in saving a lost cause?"

 socrus.379.t: "Mikhail the Broken"
 socrus.379.d: "The VTsSPS leadership quickly announced the vote for Chairmanship. The obvious choice was Aleksandr Shlyapnikov, a long-time advocate for the unions, who recently toppled Mikhail Tomsky from his position. After a couple of rounds of voting, everything seemed to point in Shlyapnikov's favour; however, in the last round, a dark horse emerged - Sergey Kirov, the so-called 'Prince of Petrograd'.\n\nAfter debates and violent exchanges of words between the two camps, Kirov emerged as the winner. In his speech, he congratulated Shlyapnikov on achieving a good score regardless of the result and expressed the need for the conflict on the Unions-Government line to end. While he stated that his sympathies lie with Shlyapnikov, he sees some good points in Kamenev's policy, which is why he decided to endorse the bill.\n\nWithin a few days, the bill was passed with the votes of the VST-Left, the VST-Centre, the SRs and even parts of the SDS and the RKB(b). In a speech, Comrade Kirov congratulated the Dvoika on passing this legislation and urged every Union to support it too. Grigory Zinovyev, in Kamenev's office, congratulated him as well and admitted that his choices were right."
 socrus.379.a: "In the end, intuition won over intrigue."

 socrus.380.t: "Friendly Exchange"
 socrus.380.d: "The Law on the Unions was passed, and new cadres were to be chosen. Grigory Zinovyev, the brain behind this legislation, was at the peak of his power, but his friend was left all alone and isolated. Their meetings were postponed, and the government, just like the protests, died down. Soon, Kamenev broke his silence and invited the Chairman-Minister to his office. As Grigory entered, Lev was quick to congratulate him. He continued, saying how choices he made affected him greatly, and how he has no supporters other than Comrade Zinovyev. With that being said, Kamenev made an offer to his friend: they would switch jobs, by both resigning and causing a new vote in the Congress. It took Zinovyev some thought, but he agreed.\n\nThe next day, both announced their resignations, but also expressed interest in running again, although for different positions. After some days, the Provisional Chairman of the Congress opened a meeting to elect a new Premier and Chairman-Minister. The Danists announced that their candidates would be Nikolay Bukharin for Chairman-Minister and Fyodor Dan for the Premier. The SRs also threw their hat into the ring and announced the candidacy of Maria Spiridonova. Last were the Communists, who reaffirmed their candidacy of Grigory Zinovyev for Premier and Lev Kamenev for Chairman-Minister. The Internationalists remained silent.\n\nNobody was elected in the first voting round, but the Danist candidacy dropped out. So far, the Dvoika only had the support of their own faction and the SR-Maximalists. What followed was another heated debate, aimed at convincing Levitsky's faction to support either his own party or his own ally. After long deliberations, the second vote happened and in it, Levitsky decided to bless Zinovyev and Kamenev."
 socrus.380.a: "Nothing could stop Zinovyev now."

 socrus.381.t: "Reversed October"
 socrus.381.d: "Zinovyev was keenly aware of his position. A top former Bolshevik had become the Premier, and one that the Bolshevik leadership generally had much appreciation for. With that alone he could convert the entire party to his side, but his charismatic speaking ability gave him an ace up his sleeve.\n\nApproaching Bolsheviks like Mikhail Frunze and Aleksey Gastev, he convinced them that a merger of their party into the VST was not only beneficial for the revolution, but for them as well. If the Bolsheviks remained as a party on the sidelines, they would be unable to seriously influence the workers' coalition, but also act as a splinter against the unity of the revolution. Was it not beneficial for all progressive revolutionary forces to act under one umbrella, as the Great Revolutionary War loomed?\n\nComrade Sverdlov has been an ally thus far, but faced with a party who suddenly wanted to defect to the VST, he quickly realised that he had been thoroughly outplayed. Sverdlov was unable to convince the rest of the party to stay on board, and he was replaced by Frunze in the last party conference of the Bolsheviks. Frunze's first move was to announce the merger of the RKP(b) into the VST, as a show of revolutionary unity - meanwhile, Sverdlov decided to retreat from party affairs entirely, feeling betrayed by his former comrades."

 socrus.384.t: "Bringing Modernity to Russia"
 socrus.384.d: "Russia is years behind our comrades in Western Europe. Pointing this out does not mean a lack of love for Russia, but stating a pure fact. The Socialist-Revolutionaries would be happy with their rural utopia, having more in common with an anarchist than a true communist. But we have greater goals. Russia MUST be industrialised, inside and out, to reach communism. And without aid from the already industrialised socialist nations, it will take all of our lifetimes to ever reach the next stage.\n\nTo this end, Comrade Zinovyev has put forward a plan (largely written by Lev Kamenev and Yevgeny Preobrazhensky) that lays the groundwork for the development of heavy industry with the help of Western machinery and experts, essentially bypassing the natural economic development supported by the less ambitious men in the VST. The plan reminds many of Savinkov's Voskhod Programme - laid in bombastic terms, focusing on heavy industry and especially in inner Russia and Urals.\n\nSavinkov's programme has always been hampered by his insistence on relying solely on Russia's own resources - but we are not mindless chauvinists, we understand the value of cooperation. We will offer British or French engineers good conditions for a stay of a few years, which they can use to direct construction and train our workers in technical and ideological matters. Importing additional machinery from Britain, in exchange for oil and agricultural goods, will be another boon to our industry. The manpower for these new facilities will be drawn from the countryside, increasingly left behind by modernity."
 socrus.384.a: "Adopt it as a proper economic plan."
 socrus.384.b: "Economic development should not be forced."

 socrus.385.t: "Leaving for Russia"
 socrus.385.d: "Ambitious plans by [RUS.GetLeader]'s government in Russia have inspired many young idealists here at home. Visions of grandeur, of building a new utopia of abundance in the virgin steppe and taiga, taming nature for the working man.\n\nThe Russian Ministry of Industry and Trade has called for young experts in the West to immigrate, at least for some time, and offer their experience from France and Britain to develop both Russian industries and Russian revolutionary consciousness."
 socrus.385.a: "Safe travels, Comrades."

 socrus.386.t: "Against the Anti-Social Intelligentsia"
 socrus.386.d: "The role of the intelligentsia is to act as the spark, the inspirator, the instigator of the masses. A Russian socialist, more than anyone, understands this. Thus he also understands the danger it poses if this most educated layer of society is allowed to spread harmful and socially destructive ideas.\n\nObviously, we support freedom of the press - as long as it does not preach counter-revolutionary talking points. But sadly, this is becoming increasingly common, even in self-declared socialist publications. This is a mere symptom of the counter-revolutionary thought spreading within the Russian intelligentsia, who seem to be turning against the Revolution after realising its true implications.\n\nThe solution is simple: deeper conviction will be required. The Academy of Sciences must be purified from counter-revolutionary ideas, and the same goes for the universities and the press. They will need to be affiliated with a legal political party in the future because 'neutrality' in the question between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie simply means accepting the oppression of the working class."
 socrus.386.a: "We will create the terror that will keep the rest in line."
 socrus.386.b: "Restrictions are needed, but not violence."
 socrus.386.c: "We would never!"

 socrus.387.t: "Maximalist Takeover of the Socialist-Revolutionaries"
 socrus.387.d: "The Congress of the Party of Socialist-Revolutionaries saw a dramatic takeover happen after the long period of factionalism finally erupted into flames. Aleksey Ustinov's Maximalists have been loud supporters of [ROOT.GetLeader]'s policies, save for some of them, and view them as infinitely preferable to the 'capitulations to capitalism' that men like Dan and Abramovich preach. The SRs in the congress are largely divided based on this line - those who oppose us behind Nikolay Zdobnov, and those who support us behind Aleksey Ustinov. Boris Kamkov and chairwoman Spiridonova made the last attempt to craft some kind of compromise, but a vote was forced - and the Maximalists managed to gain a single vote majority in the Central Committee of the Party.\n\nSoon after, Spiridonova announced her retirement from party politics, citing health reasons and disappointment in the current state of Russian socialism. Andrey Kolegayev, a relatively moderate Maximalist, was elected as her successor.\n\nThe result was welcomed in our ranks, as Kolegayev's programme greatly supported our firmer hand, more genuine attempts at forming the dictatorship of the proletariat, and fewer compromises to the Danists and other such groups. The SRs will remain great defenders of the peasants and will oppose any kind of forced collectivisation greatly - and maintain great popularity in both the Soviets and the Militias to back it up. But in other matters, we can count on the support of their leadership."
 socrus.387.a: "Interesting development."

 socrus.388.t: "The New Normal"
 socrus.388.d.kamenev: "Ever since the passing of the wartime legislation, the Congress of Soviets has been less and less relevant. Full meetings have not been organised during the war, and the Council of People's Ministers, under the direction of Lev Kamenev, has largely run all matters of state. Kamenev, as the Premier, the Chairman of the Council of Defence, and the Chairman of the VST, has stressed the importance of temporary centralisation to ensure the survival of the socialist state. Zinovyev, his Chairman of the Council of People's Ministers, has been pushing towards more radical measures. As Kamenev is largely focused on maintaining well-functioning governance, Zinovyev has been moulding Russia into something closer to what he calls a state of 'proletarian hegemony' - where anti-proletarian voices are silenced, lest they poison the unity of the working class.\n\nFirst, there were wartime laws restricting many basic freedoms, such as publication and organisation. The creeping bureaucratic influence over unions and all states of administration has meant that Soviet democracy is becoming less and less relevant - and without meetings of the Congress, neither can their representatives meaningfully influence the state of affairs. This is justified by the necessity for national unity in our revolutionary war - and as far as Premier Kamenev is concerned, this is likely intended to be a temporary measure. But it is hard to say how much of this technocratic governance will remain in place. Perhaps after the war, the Congress will find itself simply less relevant, while the state is working like clockwork around it."
 socrus.388.d.zinovyev: "Ever since the passing of the wartime legislation, the Congress of Soviets has been less and less relevant. Full meetings have not been organised during the war, and the Council of People's Ministers, under the direction of Grigory Zinovyev, has largely run all matters of state. Zinovyev, as the Premier, the Chairman of the Council of Defence, and the Chairman of the VST, has been centralising power around himself, even if technically he is no dictator except in behaviour. Kamenev, as his Chairman of the Council of People's Ministers, serves as a moderating tendency, though he is largely focused on implementation and organisation, not on future policy.\n\nFirst, there were wartime laws restricting many basic freedoms, such as publication and organisation. The creeping bureaucratic influence over unions and all states of administration has meant that Soviet democracy is becoming less and less relevant - and without meetings of the Congress, neither can their representatives meaningfully influence the state of affairs. On paper, this is justified by the necessity for national unity in our revolutionary war, but Zinovyev has made it no secret that he intends to run Russia like he ran Petrograd in 1918 - as a proud workers' dictator. There is already new legislation in the works, meant to increase his power even further - as required, of course, by a centralised, powerful workers' state, naturally."
 socrus.388.a: "Comrade Lenin would be proud."

 socrus.389.t: "Integral Socialism and the Accession of the Maximalists"
 socrus.389.d: "For some time now, negotiations have been ongoing between the secretary of the PSR, Aleksey Ustinov, and Zinovyev and his trusted men. Ustinov and several SR-Maximalists enjoy positions in the current cabinet and have become something of an insurance policy for the stability of the Workers' Coalition. Both under constant pressure from Zinovyev, and the Maximalists' wish to purge their party of the rest of the moderates, an agreement was made.\n\nThe VST would recognise Integral Socialism as their guiding principle. This old concept of Lenin's was abandoned by the Bolsheviks due to the undeveloped state of Russian peasantry, but now the time is right for it, the Maximalists argue. In its essence, Integral Socialism stipulates that in the context of Russia, both industrial workers and 'labour peasants' - those working the land on their own - comprise one, united proletariat, and thus bridge the city-village divide.\n\nThis concession will definitely ruffle some feathers in the VST, but Zinovyev believes it is a good decision - and most importantly, it will deliver a death blow to party pluralism. Because in exchange, the Maximalists will agree to a merging of the VST and the PSR, and extending the All-Russian Union of Labour to include all workers' parties of Russia. This deal, as it was announced, was called a betrayal of values in both parties, but ultimately the majority accepted it - after all, there is just one working class: how could there be two parties for them?"
 socrus.389.a: "Brilliant."

 socrus.390.t: "Enforcing Hegemony"
 socrus.390.d: "It is the term of the day. The Hegemony of the Proletariat, Chairman Zinovyev's favourite mantra. In his speeches, the theme is repeated ad infinitum - that revolutions are not won with debates or slavish appeals to democratic forms, but through the iron dictatorship of the only class that can lead the exploited to their emancipation and which rules out no means by which to achieve that goal - the proletariat. Those who preach the inviolability of certain principles, such as universal suffrage or the abolition of capital punishment, offer power to the bourgeoisie on a salver. It is through subjecting themselves to the domination of the proletariat and its advanced vanguard that all exploited classes can move towards communism and free themselves from class society. Until that day, there shall remain an open class dictatorship, a proletarian dictatorship at its purest.\n\nThose who believe are largely pulled from the industrial working class and are fanatical in their support, entirely enthralled by Zinovyev's impeccable charisma and energy. Those who do not accept his views are generally apathetic, sidelined, or in prison. The recent centralisation of power did create some amount of mass protests in Southern Russia, where Zinovyev is less liked, but they were soon broken apart by the bayonets of the workers loyal to his vision. Though some dispute this or consider it irrelevant, the official narrative is that the protests were members of the wealthier peasants and middle classes."
 socrus.390.a: "Our task is terrible, total, universal, and merciless."

 socrus.391.t: "The Extent of Centralisation"
 socrus.391.d: "The tendency for bureaucratisation was already noted by the French syndicalists in the 1930s, as more technocratic guidance is needed to keep socially managed industries sufficiently effective. Ignoring all the rhetoric of workers' paradise, it is a real issue in workers' states that the goals of the common people do not always line up with the government's. Naturally, each worker wishes to reduce the amount of hours worked, but the government has plenty of industries that are in need of constant, stable production, which are not consumed by the people. Building fighters and armoured vehicles is still necessary, as long as hostile states and forces exist, even if they do not directly benefit people's quality of life.\n\nAll this begs the question: just how much should Soviet democracy be allowed to dictate production? During the war, various bureaucratic bodies were set up to inspect and manage production and often bypass decisions of Factory Soviets in matters where they threatened the collective good. This was a very unpopular measure, but understood in the context of wartime. Now there are growing demands for increased freedoms - both for workers to manage themselves, and to reduce the power of party bureaucrats in decision-making in general."
 socrus.391.a: "There is no turning back; we need to continue what we started."
 socrus.391.b: "One day the world will no longer be hostile to us."

 RUS_centralisation_no_tt: "§SAfter the Revolution is no longer threatened, we will return to a gentler hand.§!"

 socrus.392.t: "The Bureaucratic Dictatorship"
 socrus.392.d: "At this point it must be said that the promise of democracy in the Russian Revolution was not delivered. Even the more idealistic Western socialist would point out that in Russia, the Workers' Soviet is not truly making any decisions. It is largely made up of workers loyal to the regime, and serves as a mere rubber stamp to the vast bureaucratic apparatus.\n\nThis, of course, is all done for the sake of efficiency and common good, for the development of all Russia and all of its peoples. But in practice, the VST has turned the republic into a politically suppressed, apathetic nation. Direct political persecution is not very visible or obvious, and on the outside, the appearance of workers' democracy still exists. It just... doesn't do much."
 socrus.392.a: "One does not love the bayonet for its own sake, only for what it defends."

 # VST Postwar #
 socrus.393.t: "Weapons of Peace"
 socrus.393.d: "At all times, war has been the enemy of the working class, and so it remains in a dictatorship of the proletariat. We have been forced to maintain a great military-industrial sector, producing tools of war, death, and destruction out of necessity. If the workers did not arm themselves, they would be enslaved by the Reaction.\n\nBut after the destruction of the Capitalist Powers in Europe, the mood has greatly changed - perhaps we should start the process of toning down militarism and armaments production. After all, what use are assault guns in times of peace? Western Europe is in the hands of our socialist comrades, and the East poses no serious threat to us. Surely instead of every armoured vehicle and bomber, we could have a tractor, or a house? If a post-scarcity economy is our goal, as Marx formulated, then we must focus on industrial wealth that actually benefits the people - something machine guns rarely do."
 socrus.393.a: "All Russians can have a car by 1960 if we choose to do so."
 socrus.393.b: "The world is a bayonet - you must pick which side of it you are on."

 socrus.394.t: "The Revolutionary Faction"
 socrus.394.d: "Initially, to be called part of the 'right-VST' was an insult, implying that some in the VST were closer to social democrats and the bourgeois than 'proper' socialists. With time, this implication has become less and less relevant, as the VST is now largely controlled by former Mensheviks and other moderate socialists. Comrade Abramovich is generally liked, though has committed to many impractical and highly idealistic policies that have had their fair share of criticism. Particularly controversial has been Abramovich's stance on the police and drastic cuts to the security apparatus, claiming that 'good will breeds goodwill'.\n\nA political opposition to Rafail Abramovich has formed around Boris Nikolayevsky and Nikolay Sukhanov, who represent the 'revolutionary group' within the VST. Drawing much of their support from the former Centre faction, they nonetheless accept the current course of mixed economic system and 'idealist socialism' - but with more down-to-earth policies, disagreeing with the idea that the counterrevolutionary influence would simply disappear on its own within a decade. They speak of the need to maintain a stricter government hand in modernising rural Russia and fighting against superstition, and that it will take at least one or two generations until true socialism can be found in every corner of Russia."
 socrus.394.a: "Abramovich prevails."
 socrus.394.b: "Nikolayevsky dethrones him."

 socrus.395.t: "The Rumyantsev Reform"
 socrus.395.d: "Our mixed system of 'New Russian Socialism', coined by Comrade Finn-Yenotaevksy, has produced varying results. There is a healthy class of small socialist enterprises, largely family businesses and cooperatives, which are beneficial especially to the consumer sector in cities. Similarly, the system has been well-liked by many peasants. But the problems were quick to arise during the war: inefficient military production, lacking growth of heavy industry, lack of centralisation of resources.\n\nCalls for further centralisation have not been heeded by [ROOT.GetLeader]'s government, however. Instead, the government began a number of political and economic reforms led by the young and illustrious Aleksey Matveyevich Rumyantsev. Rumyantsev made much of his career in the wartime economic department, and has led the rebuilding programme in Ukraine and Belarus with the hope of building a 'lasting socialism'.\n\nWhile he is hardly the only man behind the proposed reforms, he has become a sort of face for the political economy of modern Russia. Proposals include further relaxation of the economic system and increased support for small enterprise, utilising the profit motive instead of pure production numbers, and liberalisation of the political system with the belief that now that Socialism stands triumphant, the need for coercion is becoming increasingly irrelevant."
 socrus.395.a: "Comrade Rumyantsev has the right idea."

 socrus.396.t: "The Dream of Cybernetics"
 socrus.396.d: "The only problem with central planning is that with the scale of the entire Russian economy, plans are constantly hampered by the need for bureaucracy. Miles of archive files are produced in the planning process, as the experts must have accurate information on the productivity of each factory and oblast.\n\nA small group of mathematicians in Russian academia have risen up to the task. They enjoy the patronage of Admiral Aksel Ivanovich Berg, a Finnish Swedish-born fleet officer, hero of the Arkhangelsk evacuation, and an expert in radio engineering. These 'Cyberneticists' are working on projects like the Electronic Computing Machine and are hoping that more funds will be directed to the strange field of electronic computing from the military.\n\nTheir vision is fully automated communism, one where human error matters little, as electronic machines handle the calculation, planning, and distribution of resources in the most effective and neutral way possible. Of course, this cannot be reached anytime soon, even in the next few decades - but first steps must be taken nonetheless."
 socrus.396.a: "Computers are the future!"

 socrus.397.t: "Faster, Faster, Faster!"
 socrus.397.d: "The 20th century is a century of industry. Despite Russia's poor starting conditions, much work has been done to harness our great natural resources towards creating wealth for all workers. Look at Britain - a small rainy island, which has created unsurpassed material living standards purely with innovation and machines!\n\nWhat could Russia be without unnumbered natural resources? Rivers turned to produce electricity, great veins of ores tapped for wealth for all. Forests turned into houses and paper for countless educational books! The archaic countryside slowly fading away, as mechanical harvesters and tractors roam perfectly even fields. With our resources, it is only a matter of time until every material need for Russians will be satisfied."
 socrus.397.a: "The Russia of tomorrow is a wealthy one."

 socrus.398.t: "The Dual Party System"
 socrus.398.d: "The political system of Russia is often described as a 'two-party system', though naturally we don't like to call it that ourselves. But it is true that, in practice, the All-Russian Union of Labour and the Socialist-Revolutionary Party are relatively equal in political power. While the VST has, for some time now, controlled most city Soviets and most of the executive power, the Esers have great influence in rural Russia and the provinces.\n\nSome see this as a good development - for example, Nikolay Bukharin's publication, 'Analysis of the State of Soviet Democracy', pointed out that, in practice, two parties act as checks on each other's power while still representing the working class. This, according to him, ensures the political freedom of Soviets much better than a single-party system would, as the workers always have a chance to flock to the other party should one fail in their service of the people.\n\nThe system has its fair share of critics, too - both from the extreme left of the VST, and from anarchist-aligned thinkers such as Grigory Maksimov and Isaak Steinberg. The common criticism is that the glorious Russian revolution has been squandered and turned into a mere parliamentary system once more, where political parties compete for power in cabinet politics not unlike the bourgeois republic of the 1920s. Political parties and their supporters detract from class solidarity and instead create class oppositionalism, where the working class is constantly being divided by the political elite - creating a bureaucratic-managerial class of party functionaries and bureaucrats.\n\nRegardless of the criticism, the system seems to be here to stay. Many view it as a temporary state, one that will naturally disappear as the material conditions of Russia increase and equalise economic harmony across the country. But until then, we must work together."

 socrus.399.d: "Maksimov and Levitsky's political alliance has not been the most cooperative one. These are two deeply different men, as Levitsky is the epitome of the socialist intelligentsia, an idealistic thinker and speaker rather than a man of action. Maksimov, on the other hand, has never shirked from going down to the people to focus on grassroots revolutionary work. In private, Maksimov has often called Mensheviks white-collar pen-pushers who have never done a hard day's work - but it is also this mentality that has made him quite popular both with the more radical wing of the VST and the SRs. He appears as a non-partisan man who does not see Russia in terms of its two main parties, but as bureaucrats and workers.\n\nFinally, the tensions boiled over as Levitsky suggested toning down many aspects of Maksimov's programme of devolution. Maksimov's plan would drastically reduce the power of the central government and Congress, giving it instead to regional governments. The economic system would be further decentralised, and political parties would be abolished at the electoral level, with all candidates running essentially as independents. He claims this would ensure giving all the power to Workers' Soviets and would be a step towards creating a Workers' Confederation, with no overbearing state bureaucracy over workers' heads.\n\nDespite the controversy, it was clear that Maksimov was enjoying greater popularity in the Congress than Levitsky himself - especially after the Socialist-Revolutionaries announced their support for Maksimov's proposals. Some days later, Comrade Levitsky, the father of our new republic, announced his and his government's resignation. It is expected that Grigory Maksimov will be elected to succeed him."

 socrus.400.t: "Withering Soviet Democracy"
 socrus.400.d: "The worrying signals were already in the air during the war. Elected Soviets were relegated to advisory or irrelevant positions, as decisions were dictated by higher party functionaries or bureaucrats. People elected by rural Soviets would be pressured to retire and more politically reliable men would be elected in their place.\n\nA watershed moment was when a publication in Chelyabinsk, 'Peace and Labour', was censored for its harsh criticism towards the Chelyabinsk branch of the VST and its chairman, Nikolay Teplov. The publication released a statement from over two hundred workers, demanding Teplov to stand down after his 'dictatorial' management of local party appointments, ignoring the will of local Soviets. But Teplov is well-connected to the Kremlin and considered a reliable and good man by Chairman [ROOT.GetLeader] - which obviously makes the matter trickier for the government.\n\nCensoring the publication as 'harmful to workers' unity' sent a clear message - dissent should not be made public. There have been sporadic protests, and in private, many are worried about the state of Soviet democracy, but in public speeches, it is all idealistic and for the defence of the revolution."
 socrus.400.a: "Should we be alarmed?"

 socrus.401.t: "Russia's Place in the World"
 socrus.401.d: "A true Russian Marxist is not a petty nationalist like many Socialist-Revolutionaries; he does not believe in any kind of Russian exceptionalism, but in the single International human race. But in negotiating tables of the International and its Executive Committee and various other organisations, it is obvious that the Russian voice is not always taken seriously. Despite some Russian émigrés having successful careers in the International before the war, we do seem to be playing second fiddle to the French and British, and are seen as 'less developed' in the science of Marxism. How ludicrous of a claim is that? We are the nation of Lenin and Bakunin - Russia is perhaps the most revolutionary nation in the whole world!\n\nTo take our rightful place, Comrade Zinovyev has launched a campaign in the International for thorough reform, to 'make the organisation suit the needs of further stages of socialism'. He calls for permanent seats in the Executive Council for major socialist powers, including Russia, as the guides and patrons of world socialism. In an ideal world, the socialist world is led jointly by France, Britain, Russia, Germany, and America, the great motors of world industry.\n\nWhile this would gnaw at the democracy of the organisation, it would be the first step in turning the International from a divided forum of socialist debate into a true world government, capable of genuine action."
 socrus.401.a: "True!"

 socrus.402.t: "Passing the New Constitution"
 socrus.402.d: "Our former constitution was the result of compromise and debate, formed in haste by disunited revolutionaries. It has served its purpose - but for new times, a more defined system is needed. While Zinovyev himself has never been a legalist, or even greatly interested in constitutional matters, his 'proletarian hegemony' is often formed out of tape and string.\n\nThe constitutional committee was chaired by Lev Kamenev, Aleksey Gastev, and Ivan Gronsky, whose task was to create a framework for Zinovyev's ideal system: one that secures the future of Workers' Democracy in the form of a one-party state, that grants the executive powerful enough means to fight counter-revolutionary dissent, and organises the economy in a way that ensures the stable growth of Russia's material conditions.\n\nIn practice, much of it is bombastic declarations of freedom - but also drastic reductions in individual freedoms when 'suspected of counter-revolutionary activities'. Many checks and balances from the original constitution have been removed, and the authority of the Congress of Soviets has been greatly reduced.\n\nIn the speech to the Congress where the Constitution was announced, Zinovyev called it 'final victory for the proletariat', a system that would give the working class the tools to cut the rot from the nation, and create a bright communist future."
 socrus.402.a: "A much more sound legal framework."

 socrus.403.t: "Association for Research of Western Totalism"
 socrus.403.d: "With the revolution firmly establishing itself in Russia and bourgeois censorship lifted, Western ideas have begun to spread within the population. Among them is Totalism, defined by the likes of Mosley, Valois and Mussolini. Though openly denounced by all leaders of the VST, these ideas have had some influence among various intellectuals who have attempted to synthesise them. One such attempt was Ivan Gronsky's 'Association for Research of Western Totalism', a project joined by other intellectuals from among the Left VST and Maximalists of the SRs. During their meetings they developed an idea of 'Russian Totalism'. Echoing Gronsky's and Ustinov's earlier writings, they advocated an organic form of socialism, emanating from the proletariat and poor peasantry. Rejecting direct inspiration from the West, but taking in some influences, Russian Totalism would be an initiative coming purely from Russian people, in the form of dedicating their hearts to the revolution.\n\nThe group denounced the current political system completely, as compromise does not mean progress, in lines with what Comrade Lenin taught. While in their writings they praised Sorel's ideas, both Comrades spoke critically of Mosley and Mussolini, deeming their interpretations unfit for Russian people. After the series of joint writings, Gronsky and Ustinov released a joint statement lambasting an overemphasis on 'foreign ideals' and favouring a focus on Russian ideological projects. The organisation was swiftly renamed to the 'Russian Totalist Association'. These ideas have failed to find expression in the official political ideology of the VST, largely being considered to be social-patriotic and eclectic, but are tolerated by Zinovyev and Kamenev to the extent they rely on Gronsky and his network and have been widely reported in journals and discussed in cultural institutions."

 socrus.403.b: "This is a disease that requires urgent cure."

 socrus.404.t: "Totalism Against Totalism"
 socrus.404.d: "Comrade Grigory Zinovyev, passionate internationalist and former head of the ill-fated Comintern, was an obvious choice to represent Russia before all of the International. His connections within the global socialist movement allowed the VST to be accepted as the sole Russian representation. In its most recent session the topic of the signatories of the Totalist Charter became a hotly discussed issue, questioning their compatibility with international socialism. Zinovyev took to the stage for an address. Harkening back to the Second Congress of the Comintern he reminded the delegates of the Bolshevik call for a strict organisational, theoretical and programmatic unity so that the international could be more than a propaganda association, but rather a single communist party having branches in different countries. The new International had failed to safeguard itself against revisionist, social-patriotic and petty-bourgeois influences. While there was little doubt who this referred to, Zinovyev explicitly condemned 'left-republican' and 'Mosleyite' tendencies, causing an uproar from many of the delegates that took time to calm. He made clear where the blame for this was to be placed - a laxity in discipline, a hysterical respect for democratic forms even against the interests of the proletariat, and an attitude far too tolerant to parties whose practice and tactics are in flagrant opposition to those of the revolutionary proletariat.\n\nThe International's plenum was greatly stirred by Zinovyev's speech, and intense conversations broke out among the delegates as soon as it ended. Some among the syndicalist and communist left saw sense in his words. Many of the left and centrist factions were shocked and confused, feeling themselves implicated, while others rebuked the harsh anti-democratic tones, calling it "Totalism against Totalism." The Totalist Charter signatories responded harshly, denouncing Zinovyev as an ultra-left madman hell bent on curbing national autonomy. Most agitated, however, were the other VST delegates, who were furious that Zinovyev had made such a bold statement without consultation. Soon after, telegrams were sent to Moscow, condemning Zinovyev and waiting on [ROOT.GetLeader]'s response."
 socrus.404.a: "We should remind him of his place."
 socrus.404.b: "Praise Zinovyev for his fierce dedication."

 socrus.405.t: "To the Martyrs of Green Terror"
 socrus.405.d: "After Boris Savinkov was overthrown, all the horrors of his Robespierrean reign became public knowledge. Many were eternally silenced for posing even the slightest threat to his rule. There were some local attempts by the families of the fallen to raise awareness or gather funds for at least a worthy resting place, but to no avail. Now that the revolution is firmly rooted within Russia, a new wind blew for those families, as the government itself began to plan something to make citizens remember those fallen comrades. As such, a monument was sculpted by Romuald Iodko, with an engraving to commemorate the victims. Premier Abramovich gave a speech upon the monument's completion. In it, he expressed how close this sculpture is to him, as he is among those many families who lost someone dear to them.\n\nDuring the fall of 1934, Mark Rafailovich Rein, Abramovich's son and a known socialist journalist, suddenly went missing. As an RDP deputy at the time seeking re-election, Rafail Abramovich had been intimidated before, but he never suspected anyone would pose a threat to his son. Soon, his body was found by Rein's colleagues in the outskirts of Moscow, with a note left by the Svobodniks to intimidate other journalists like him. The murder was never reported, but left as a private warning to those who had known Mark Rein. That day left Rafail A. Abramovich a changed man; however, he did not surrender in his exile and finally, as a man leading the republic, he has a chance to honour his son's memory, among many others who suffered the same fate as him."

 socrus.406.t: "A Dream of a Union"
 socrus.406.d: "The Russian Empire has been thrown into the dustbin of history, but a twist of fate has placed us in a position where the great dream of 1917 - a democratic, socialist federation of the former Russian Empire - is within our grasp if we reach for it. We revolutionaries do not waste time on absurdities such as 'Ukrainians do not exist' and other Black Hundredist slogans, but rather our rationale is this: Russia, as the most industrialised nation of Eastern Europe and Asia, is best positioned to improve material conditions, fight tyranny, capitalism, and superstition, and ultimately guide the entire region into a fully realised socialist system.\n\nIn its current state, the Union of Socialist Labour Republics functions as a loose union. All of its republics elect delegates to the Union Congress, a de jure supreme body but with limited authority. Comrade republics are tied in defence and foreign policy, form a single economic area, and coordinate in various fields from infrastructural projects to economic specialisation. In addition, the Union Congress arbitrates issues between member republics. In practice, Moscow holds all the cards in the Union, but not to such an unequal degree that it could simply impose its will on every matter.\n\nA plan for the centralisation of the Union of Socialist Labour Republics has been put forward to [GetSecondInCommand]'s government to be pushed forward in the Union Congress. The 14-point programme aims to abolish national-states and national, religious, and economic chauvinism and turn the Union of Socialist Labour Republics into an international workers' federation.\n\nWhile the wordings are rosy, the plan also drew heavy criticism. Some in our party consider the practical implementation of this as centralism, statism, and 'red imperialism', and the criticism has been even heavier among our Ukrainian and Belarusian comrades. But those who do not know better have always opposed progress." #USLR only
 socrus.406.d2: "The Russian Empire has been thrown into the dustbin of history, but a twist of fate has placed us in a position where the great dream of 1917 - a democratic, socialist federation of the former Russian Empire - is within our grasp if we reach for it.

In addition, the Union Congress arbitrates issues between member republics. In practice, Moscow holds all the cards in the Union, but not to such an unequal degree that it could simply impose its will on every matter.\n\nUltimately, the designs for centralisation of the Union of Socialist Labour Republics have been struck down by our government. While the idea of an internationalist federation is obviously supported by many, there are numerous practical issues that would arise from it. An attempt to reduce the national self-determination of Ukraine, Belarus, and various other sister republics would be met with hostility and suspicion, and to many it would seem to confirm Russian imperialist ambitions - even if that is not our goal.\n\nThe goal of material and educational progress does not require the immediate abolition of national republics, which might instead inflame tensions between the working class of different cultures and erode our mutual solidarity. The state will wither away, but it will happen eventually, with the unstoppable tide of history, not through executive action." #Decentralisation
 socrus.406.d3: "The Russian Empire has been thrown into the dustbin of history, but a twist of fate has placed us in a position where the great dream of 1917 - a democratic, socialist federation of the former Russian Empire - is within our grasp if we reach for it.

A programme was drafted by a Congress committee to take steps toward the abolition of nation-states of the Union of Socialist Labour Republics, citing this as an inevitable and necessary step towards the destruction of national, religious, and economic chauvinism that still remains in both Russia and our sister republics.\n\nDespite its idealistic framing, the plan was widely criticised as a centralisation of power and anathema to the national self-determination of all working peoples. The opposition claims that the same goal will be reached much more genuinely through further decentralisation and tireless work towards material and spiritual progress." #Both

 socrus.407.t: "Empowering of the Executive Committee of the Union Congress"
 socrus.407.d: "In between quarter-yearly sessions of the Union Congress, the Executive Committee has maintained the everyday business of the Union of Socialist Labour Republics. In practice, however, the body largely supervises the member republics. With recent legislation passed by the Union Congress, the Executive Committee has been empowered to create Union Ministries, merging various separate government bodies across our comrade republics under singular All-Union Ministries.\n\nThe first two ministries - Military Affairs and Foreign Affairs - have taken over handling these matters from the Union Congress-appointed Committees, and it seems that the intent is to further 'coordinate' republics to be increasingly under centralised management. While on paper it is also the Russian government that is giving up power to this extra-national level of government, in practice the difference is small, as the Union Congress holds its meetings in Petrograd and Moscow, and its Executive Committee is largely composed of those loyal to [RUS.GetLeader]."
 socrus.407.a: "Excellent."

 socrus.408.t: "People's Ministry of Economic Coordination"
 socrus.408.d: "Initially, each member republic contributed only a small amount to the Union Budget, but its size has been ballooning over the past year as more and more Union-level agencies have been created. Until now, the domestic economy of each member republic has been relatively independent, outside common regulations and joint industrial projects.\n\nBut with the new People's Ministry of Economic Coordination, a new plan has been unveiled by Premier [RUS.GetLeader] and the heads of other Labour Republics. All the various economy ministries of member republics will be subjected to the Coordination Ministry, which will have the power to create common, binding rules and set goals.\n\nOfficially, the purpose is specialisation and development - to let each Labour Republic focus on its economic expertise, and for all to emerge as more prosperous. This will also enable everyone to benefit from resources like Central Asian cotton, in which production has been plagued by a lack of industrial expertise and funds in poorer Central Asian republics.\n\nWhile propaganda campaigns are hailing this as the beginning of a new era of prosperity, the more insightful political thinkers have understood it as what it is - the death of independent Ukraine, Belarus, and so on. With economic control sliding up to the Union government, the governments and parliaments of the Labour Republics are relegated more and more into the role of local autonomous governments, not nations in their own right."
 socrus.408.a: "Economic development requires sacrifices."

 socrus.409.t: "A Model for the World"
 socrus.409.d: "In a speech before the International Congress, Russian syndicalist delegate Vladimir Sergeyevich Shatov gave a 30-minute praising analysis of the state of the Union of Socialist Labour Republics. Mainly aimed towards the Western socialists, Shatov went in-depth on how it is, in fact, in the East where Internationalism is at its strongest, in the inherently multicultural Eurasian world. Consider Russia and Ukraine - comrades who have been at each other's throats because of the tyranny of Tsars, Hetmans, and Kaisers. But now both enjoy economic prosperity, solve their disputes in the Union Tribunal, and negotiate common rules in the Union Congress.\n\nWhile the former Russian Empire is the natural birthplace for such a project due to shared history, there is zero reason why the same model cannot be expanded upon all over the world. At its heart is the Workers' Soviet, elected and recalled freely, and higher bodies only exist where it is necessary. One does not need to decide whether to plant beets or potatoes in Moscow, when the same decision can be made with much better information by the local Soviet. Shatov confidently paints the model of the Union of Socialist Labour Republics as something potentially global, a system that would span the entire human race.\n\nDespite the applause, there remains suspicion, especially in the West, viewing the USLR as ingenuine, or perhaps merely Russian imperialism masquerading as a true union."
 socrus.409.a: "So true!"

 socrus.450.t: "The Language of the World Revolution!"
 socrus.450.d: "Esperanto was created by Polish linguist Lazar Zamenhof in 1887 with the dream of creating a language for all of humanity, and it was most popular in Eastern Europe. Russia of the 1920s saw vibrant Esperantist cultural life, and the Third International has supported it, though French delegates often oppose the weakening of the French position as the language of diplomacy.\n\nBut after the Revolution in Russia, Esperanto is living its new heyday. Famous Esperantists like Vladimir Varankin, Yevhen Mikhalsky, Nikolay Khokhlov, and Ernest Dresen have enjoyed government patronage, and Esperanto has been adopted as part of the curriculum in many parts of the USLR. There have even been proposals to adopt it as a working language in the Union Congress - and possibly in the Third Workers' International.\n\nOnce again, Russia is showing the way to the western socialists with its embrace of Esperanto as a true revolutionary language. In the ideal future, workers of all cultures can communicate together in Esperanto, without language getting in the way of comradeship, while maintaining their own distinct languages and cultures unique to the people of each land."
 socrus.450.a: "Internacia estos la tuta homa mond!"

 socrus.451.t: "Treaty of Organisation of Union of Labour Republics"
 socrus.451.d: "Today, the Union Congress of the USLR has ratified the Treaty of Organisation of Union of Socialist Labour Republics, already accepted by the legislatures of all Labour Republics. This agreement is essentially a new constitutional document, which transforms the union of nations into a singular sovereign entity composed of multiple member republics.\n\nThe Union Congress of Soviets is elevated as the supreme legislative body, which elects the All-Union Executive Committee and the Council of People's Ministers. Seats are allocated based on the population of each Labour Republic, and despite some concessions that the Ukrainian socialists managed to get, the new system is still clearly skewed towards the Russian Socialist Federative Labour Republic.\n\nDespite maintaining individual Labour Republics as autonomous polities, in practice the treaty welds them together into a single nation not unlike the Russian Democratic Federative Republic was - with a powerful central government in Moscow over the autonomous regions. In many aspects, the new state is progressive, tolerant, and democratic, but in practice much of this is undermined by a lack of controls and checks put on the Union Congress, which would generally have a Russian majority. Opponents of the Treaty believe that the new system can only lead to the dominance of Russia, and the recreation of the Russian Empire masquerading as a workers' state.\n\nUnsurprisingly, [ROOT.GetLeader] was elected Premier of the Union and head of the All-Union Executive Committee. After all, he is largely responsible for saving the spirit of the Russian revolution and leading it to new triumph. He will stand together with Comrade Lenin as the great founding father of our new revolutionary state."

 socrus.452.t: "A Union Divided"
 socrus.452.d: "The various minorities of the Union of Socialist Labour Republics have been lukewarm about the formation of the new superstate. While the explicitly right-wing nationalist opposition has obviously been banned, a new opponent to the centralisation treaty has sprung up.\n\nNykyfir Hryhoriiv, party chairman of the UPS-R, never spoke highly of the 'Moscow-directed' Ukrainian government, though it seemed that he was content to retire from political life for the time. That has changed now, as Hryhoriiv has, together with other socialists stretching from the Black Sea to the Baltics, organised the 'Committee for the Restoration of Sovereignty'. The stated goals of the Committee are the reversal of the centralisation treaty, believing it to be a thinly-veiled expression of Russian imperialist ambitions rather than internationalist solidarity.\n\nThe Committee has organised largely peaceful protests in major Ukrainian and Belarusian cities, though law enforcement seems to be increasingly wary of their rapidly inflating numbers. The news quickly got the attention of the Congress, with more hardline delegates advocating to ban the Committee for expressions of 'bourgeois nationalism' - the exact thing the treaty was meant to oppose. But there is dissent from within, with many in the Congress having sympathies for the movement, so the issue remains too contentious to seriously consider a crackdown.\n\nIt has also become widely known of the Committee's contacts with the Western socialist republics, which has obviously strained relations between it and Moscow. Still, it is hoped that, given enough time, the protests will calm down and the Union of Socialist Labour Republics will become more stable."

How is that any different from the Prussians gunning down our brothers in Ukraine?\n\nIn an almost unanimous vote, the Congress passed a declaration initiated by Socialist-Revolutionary Gavriil Alyunov, a famous independence fighter and people's revolutionary from Chuvashia. The declaration is a universal condemnation of imperialism and a call for all oppressed peoples of the world to rise up in a common proletarian front. It clearly portrays the German Empire, the Habsburg Empire, and the Ottoman Empire as the primary offenders to national self-determination - and thus their destruction is necessary for the sake of humanity.\n\nThe declaration also promises self-rule for the nationalities inside Russia, envisioning a kind of world union between proletarian countries of the world."

The treaty binds together the foreign policy and security of the Union Republics and has the power to give policy recommendations to the people's governments of the union. Additionally, the Union has no internal barriers for economic activities and encourages economic cooperation between the proletariat of the union. The Union Republics maintain their own people's armies, their own ways of political organisation, and their own legislatives, all under an agreed common socialist framework.\n\nThe current Russian autonomies are recognised as sovereign sister states in union with the Russian Socialist Federative Republic with representation in the Union Congress. Those regions of the RSFR with minority nations become autonomous sister republics within the RSFR and also gain delegates in the Union Congress. While the Union does not have much real power yet, we hope that in future it will become more perfect - and eventually the national states will wither away."

The Russian workers' army has marched from Petrograd to Berlin and liberated the peoples as they went, joined by our comrades in Ukraine, Belarus, and many other nations. Our Union of Socialist Labour Republics (SSTR) has served as the framework for integrating these regions liberated by the Russian army, and many nations, now under socialist government, have joined the Union with us as sovereign Labour Republics. In the first Congress of Union, for the first time, delegates from these liberated regions are also sitting alongside other peoples of Russia."
 socrus.420.d.psrdem: "$socrus.420.start$\n\nThe first post-war session of the Union Congress was a glorious mess. With its seats expanded to 680 to account for populations of new sister republics, Ukrainian socialists came to have almost a quarter of seats. The current chairman, Vladimir Karelin, presided over the session, which largely focused on clarifying issues between different member republics. The Ukrainian delegates were especially quick to leverage their numbers to ensure guarantees for all smaller member republics. It is likely that the body won't be able to centralise power, even if we wanted to do so. But then again, many are perfectly happy to maintain the Union of Socialist Labour Republics only as an alliance between socialist states, not as a potential state."
 socrus.420.d.vstcom: "$socrus.420.start$\n\nHowever, much of the liberty seems hollow as one looks at the state the communist regime has put Russia in during the war. As Premier [ROOT.GetLeader] continues to centralise power in the hands of the government, less and less does grassroots democracy matter. Sure, there are many elections, but they increasingly do not matter. The same is true for the Labour Congress - the body is being used merely as a tool to legitimise Russian conquest. Delegates from other republics are largely appointed by loyalist regimes, and the whole Congress seems more like a theatre, not a proper democracy."

In the Union Congress, delegates from Ukraine and Belarus are hardly elected by locals, but rather appointed by political allies of Maximalists in those countries. In Chairman Ustinov's speech, he was vague on the future direction of the Union and merely called for unity and solidarity between peoples of the East. In practice, the whole Congress is turning into a rubber-stamp body largely serving the interests of the Maximalists."

 socrus.421.t: "The Bolshevik Renewal"
 socrus.421.d: "With the ascension of the left of the VST, primarily made up of former Bolsheviks, an invitation has been offered to those Bolshevik remnants existing externally. The RKP(b), led by Yakov Sverdlov, has had terse relations with the VST-Left originating from the period of exile when Zinovyev and Sverdlov broke ties over a disagreement of strategy. Zinovyev, embracing the cautiousness of his stance before the October insurrection, defended the necessity of revisiting the original formulation of the programme for a 'Democratic-Dictatorship of the Proletariat and Peasantry', a longer two-stage route to revolution based on building a strong coalition with petty-bourgeois and republican elements. Sverdlov, on the other hand, had taken a turn to the left, influenced both by his commitment to the insurrection and the intransigent atmosphere among many of the French socialists. Generally hostile to the VST, the RKP(b) accuses it of being too broad and rightist, in many ways no better than the SPD. Now the hope is that this rift can be mended, and the unity of the Bolsheviks restored.\n\nThe meeting was held in a small room with an RKP(b) delegation consisting of Sverdlov and Mikhail Frunze, the stalwart Bolshevik effectively acting as the party's co-leader. A long discussion took place, which reportedly consisted of much reminiscing over the days in the RSDLP shared together among the Bolshevik faction many decades ago. Common agreement was found between Zinovyev and Kamenev on the conciliatory attitude Sverdlov had taken on the occasion before the October insurrection when the two of them had publicly rejected a seizure of power and been threatened with expulsion by Lenin. Eventually, the meeting was concluded, with the RKP(b) and VST agreeing to an alliance. Aligned candidates would not challenge each other in the Soviets or trade unions, and a number of appointments would be made from candidates among the RKP(b) to important positions of governance, including Sverdlov himself."
 socrus.421.a: "Welcome aboard, comrades."

 socrus.422.t: "Ideologising Culture"
 socrus.422.d: "While Savinkov's regime was authoritarian, societies of arts and culture survived up until the revolution and remain today. The intelligentsia has typically been viewed with deep mistrust by the revolutionary socialists of Russia, with the professoriate having deep Kadet leanings and favouring their own professional independence against political ideologies that maintain an adherence to an all-encompassing class struggle. Despite this, those intellectuals that were not driven abroad by either Savinkov or the socialist power remain in universities and cultural groups today, largely passive in the face of the proletarian dictatorship but not totally silent. In a bold turn, [RUS.GetLeader] has announced a new 'struggle on the ideological front'.\n\nA 'Committee for Political Enlightenment' has been established under the authority of Ivan Gronsky. The Committee has begun to direct financial and political support to existing cultural groups such as the Union of Writers, House of Arts, and House of Litterateurs, officially with the intention of 'supporting socialist art'. In practice, this has led to the sidelining of a lot of liberal-minded intellectuals in favour of figures such as Aleksandr Voronsky and Aleksandr Yakovlev, who, with party support, produce fiery socialist works. In an effort to 'curb the corporate spirit' of the professoriate, a number of reforms have been implemented. These include increasing university admissions and lowering standards, removing anti-socialist content from curriculums, introducing affirmative action for VST members, and destroying the power of the obstinate professors' councils within universities by replacing them with a new centralised network of partially-elected boards subordinate to the Committee.\n\nWhile many among the middle class balk at this violation of the independence of the academy, others in Russian society find themselves galvanised by the renewed socialist culture. With state support, public conferences and art festivals have become the order of the day, with artists and intellectuals travelling from the west to showcase socialist culture. Stephen Spender, Henry Sara, and T. A. Jackson from the Pankhurstite and Vanguardist wings of Labour were notable attendees, as were Paul Vaillant-Couturier and Boris Souvarine from among the communists of France."
 socrus.422.a: "Dragging the Academy into the future."

 socrus.423.t: "An Immortal Science"
 socrus.423.d: "Marx understood that religious consciousness is the consciousness of a world in which the social organisation of man confronts him as an alien social power, something imposed from without that dictates his activity. As religion evolves with human society, the basis of it shifts from the domination of man by nature to this domination of man by his own social powers - the gods take on a humanised form, becoming representatives of the forces of history. Finally, it finds its full expression in the one almighty god who contains all of the natural and social attributes of the numerous gods, and who is but a reflection of the social powers of man. Under capitalist society, in which the producers are dominated by the economic forces created by themselves and repeatedly subject and coerced by the whims of the market as though they were an alien force, this religious reflex finds itself fresh ground on which to be maintained and propagated. Still, man proposes and God disposes.\n\nThe VST understands itself to be creating a new world, however. Under socialised production, the market will be dispensed with and in its place will come rational, consciously planned production. The practical relations of the producers will be fully intelligible to them, and the religious reflex of the world will die its natural death. In order to facilitate this, a thorough programme of anti-religious education has been introduced in schools and workplaces. Students and workers must be taught to understand historical materialism and thus the real basis for all religion and ideology. Extracts from Marx, Engels, and Plekhanov are being distributed widely, and scientific education has been given a new impetus. While many hidebound members of society object to this, the programme finds unanimous support across the VST, with only disagreements on how it is to be implemented."
 socrus.423.a: "'The philosophers have merely interpreted the world, in various ways; the point is to change it.'"

 socrus.424.t: "The Russian Compromise"
 socrus.424.d: "Despite the monumental political changes that have occurred since the early days of the revolution, the system remains functionally a two-party system, something which has not gone unobserved. While the All-Russian Union of Labour remains dominant in urban Soviets and has even been making gains in rural Soviets as the traditional peasantry become less of a factor in society in the face of industrialisation and land reform, the Socialist-Revolutionary Party has managed to cling onto power in the rural provinces.\n\nSome see this as a positive development. Nikolay Bukharin, in his 'Analysis of the State of Soviet Democracy', has commended the system as offering checks on the power of any one party. This state of affairs has, however been met with extreme hostility from sections of the left, accusing it of functioning as a mere parliamentary republic. Grigory Zinovyev continues to advocate for a merger of all the extant parties under the formula of 'Proletarian Hegemony', while [RUS.GetLeader] has maintained a more ambiguous policy of an aspirational party dictatorship without criticising the existing circumstances too heavily. While being largely sidelined, anarchist-aligned thinkers such as Isaak Steinberg continue to lambast the political status quo for perceived bureaucratic deficiencies.\n\nWhat has seemed particularly curious to observers is the far-left bent of this strange multiparty democracy. Both the VST and Esers, alongside any notable minor parties that may exist, remain committed to a centrally planned economy and a Soviet system much like that advocated by the Bolsheviks of the 1917 revolution. Despite the intransigent nature of these parties and whatever disagreements may exist, neither Andrey Kolegayev nor [RUS.GetLeader] seem prepared to make any move to upset the delicate balance of power between them, and any suggestions in that direction are met with vague references to the necessity of proletarian democracy."
 socrus.424.a: "Hurrah for Workers' Democracy!"

 socrus.425.t: "Solidification of the Vanguard"
 socrus.425.d: "From the revolution to the end of the war, the VST has come to hold a stronger position within the Soviets. The proletariat has been drawn to it since the Bolshevik diaspora was absorbed into the party and the trade unions were centralised under the control of the political apparatus, helping to strengthen the power of the VST increasingly as this class has grown numerically following industrialisation and voluntary collectivisation. Despite this, the hold of the VST among the rural Soviets has always been weak. While the peasantry have become less a decisive element in the political life of the country, they have remained committed to the Socialist-Revolutionary Party. The Esers, however, have found themselves drawn closer to the VST since the Maximalist ascension within the party, favouring much of the economic policy of the Left VST and their lenient attitude towards the countryside. The war further reconciled the parties, with joint efforts to rally the peasants in defence of the 'socialist fatherland' and against the junker system of Germany, which threatened all that had been gained.\n\nWith relations between the two parties better than ever, a merger has been announced by both [RUS.GetLeader] and Kolegayev. In a symbolic joint address, they condemned the mistakes of the civil war and announced the mending of the rift between the Socialist-Revolutionary Party and the VST - a tacit acknowledgement of the continuity between the VST and the Bolsheviks. A single party will now represent and protect the interests of both the industrial working class and the poor peasants, and the process of merging the two parties has begun in most of the political apparatus, with Eser and VST candidates now operating under the same party in regional Soviets and Esers adopting important ministerial positions, particularly related to agriculture. While a few holdouts remain in a splinter party, for the most part, the Socialist-Revolutionary Party is no more, and the two-party system is gone with it."
 socrus.425.a: "Revolutionary Unity has been achieved!"

 socrus.426.t: "On Democratic Centralism"
 socrus.426.d: "Democratic Centralism is the organising principle that defined the Bolshevik wing of the RSDLP. While the Mensheviks preferred a looser form of organisation, Lenin had strictly advocated a form of organisation that could lead to a greater unity of action among revolutionary socialists. While allowing for full freedom of criticism and debate within party and public meetings as long as they took place in line with the principles of the party programme, members of the party would be expected to show an absolute unity of action when it came to carrying out the agreed-upon tactical measures. This did not extend to an absolute freedom of all debate and criticism at all times. It would be expected that a party member did not proffer any criticism that would violate the unity of action of the party when that action was being carried out. It was in fact on this basis that Kamenev and Zinovyev were almost expelled from the party on the wishes of Lenin after they publicly opposed the October insurrection.\n\nDespite this history, Kamenev has submitted a proposal to the central committee of the VST that calls for the establishment of the principle of Democratic Centralism throughout the organisation. With the VST-Left dominant this has easily been voted in, and the organs of the VST and of socialist governance are being equipped to adopt these centralising principles. Extracts from Plekhanov and Lenin are being disseminated widely, and the principles are being argued for in the party press. Many outside of the Left remain worried, however, and argue that the wide variation in the positions of the factions within the VST could lead to internal splits as the policy against criticism of action becomes untenable, while others argue that this could lead to the enforcement of Leninist policy onto the party."
 socrus.426.a: "Let this put an end to Parliamentarian nonsense."

 socrus.427.t: "The Reaction"
 socrus.427.d: "With the end of the 'extraordinary measures' against dissidents, the publications of the opposition have made their way onto the street in a matter of hours. Despite all of the measures that had been dealt against them in the preceding months, it was clear that they had been lying in wait and were ready to operate the presses at a moment's notice. The Russian People's Party, the party of dissident liberals, has borrowed the name and symbolism of the Kadet publication, with issues of 'Speech' making their way among the major cities where the middle classes still have a strong presence. Even more worryingly, the conservative All-Russian Patriotic Party has begun reprinting the old Octoberist newspaper 'Word', and has made a particular impact among members of the rural middle class, especially the dreaded kulaks who have already been such a worry for the socialist coalition.\n\nNaturally, this has led to an uproar among the VST, with many in the Centre and the Left calling for an abandonment of the policy of tolerance. They argue that the extension of the freedom of speech and discussion to opposition groups will only strengthen the resistance of reactionaries, and is a clear precondition for their organisation against socialist power. It is undoubtedly clear from the publications in circulation that these parties do consider themselves opposed to socialism and support the restoration of a liberal republic or worse. Despite this, the VST-Right remain firm in their commitment to free speech. In a speech representing the entire faction, Dan reminded the organisation that in the negotiations with the Bolsheviks in 1917 for forming a multiparty socialist government, the Mensheviks had insisted on the full freedom of speech, press and assembly, and they would not now prove to be hypocrites and go back on their principles. He concluded by saying, 'the only basis for the power of the VST is and will remain revolutionary-democratic support on the basis of universal suffrage'."
 socrus.427.a: "Democratic legality must be maintained."

 socrus.428.t: "Instilling the Spirit"
 socrus.428.d: "To commemorate the Great Revolutionary War a large procession had been arranged in Moscow under the auspices of the VST and its remaining affiliates. In the midst of Red Square large pits were hewn from the ground and from the streets thousands of people poured, all of them with the look of the poor and toiling. A military band led the procession playing the Internationale and like wind ripples the song spread through the crowd. Large red banners unrolled to the ground from the top of the Kremlin, emblazoned with great letters in gold and white reading, 'Martyrs of the World Socialist Revolution'.\n\nThe coffins were the next to follow. Daubed crimson like blood, they were carried by rough men with tearful eyes, followed by women and children who sobbed and screamed. Many of the coffins were covered with glittering cloth and others had a soldier's hat nailed on the top. The bearers marched them into the pits, restraining the grieving. Following them came the rows of soldiers and workers. Singing hoarsely, they waved red banners. Many of them marked their association with the Left faction of the VST, but others clearly bore slogans of the Esers. Their banners proclaimed, 'Vindicate Lenin and Trotsky, Long Live the Socialist Republic!' and 'Glory to the Workers' and Peasants' Revolution!' Lines of soldiers marched at salute, factory workers raised their tools, and squadrons of artillery heaved their howitzers, the barrels wound with red and black ribbon. The singing lasted for hours, and as the last coffins were buried, the tide of workers withdrew.\n\nModerate on-lookers within the International and outside it were horrified at this spectacle, considering it symptomatic of the fierce zeal that had gripped a country less open to dissent and which made a virtue of obstinate intransigence. The believers saw it differently, however. They knew that the devout Russian people no longer needed priests to pray them into heaven. On Earth they were building a kingdom more bright than any heaven had to offer, and for which it was a glory to die."
 socrus.428.a: "Let their memory be enshrined forever."

 socrus.429.t: "On Proletarian Hegemony"
 socrus.429.d: "For Zinovyev, the distinction between authentic revolutionary Marxism and any other 'popular' movement lies in the question of the hegemony of the proletariat. Condemning the 'fetish' of democracy, Zinovyev has made it clear that the VST needs to understand that beyond any adherence to formal procedures for conducting elections, their utmost task is to maintain the hegemony of the proletariat over any territories the organisation rules. The VST is to consider itself the party of the proletariat, and to perform whatever actions are necessary to maintain the rule of that class. The party is not to rule out depriving its opponents of the franchise or of suspending any body that takes up a hostile attitude to the proletariat and its party. The proletariat is nothing more than the advanced representative of all the oppressed, and it must take its place at the head of this struggle and drag the other classes with it, tolerating them as long as they subordinate themselves to its leadership and aims.\n\nIn practice, this has meant a greater subordination of the Soviets and trade unions to the control of the VST. The legislative and executive function of the trade unions has been greatly reduced, with power shifted over to the Soviets, candidates for which are subject to a vastly increased amount of vetting by the VST and its central bodies, and many longtime voters within the Soviets find themselves excluded on the basis of their class background. The line of the VST has also taken a more dogmatic turn, with functionaries being encouraged to understand Plekhanov and Lenin and their exposition of this revolutionary principle. While opponents of the Left still hold power within the bodies of the revolutionary apparatus they protest these new centralising and stifling measures and wonder how much further it will go. Leftist firebrands, on the other hand, celebrate these as bold new measures paving the way for the ultimate victory of the proletariat."

Chairman [RUS.GetLeader] is reportedly missing, and a number of other prominent government officials have disappeared from the public eye.\n\nIt seems everyone has accepted the inevitable - the socialist cause in Russia is doomed. A number of generals, led by Aleksandr Vasilevsky, have assumed de facto power until some sort of peace can be arranged."
 socrus.430.a: "We fought for a bright future, but we have failed. Again."

 socrus.431.t: "The Supreme Council of National Economy"
 socrus.431.d: "The Supreme Council of National Economy, or VSNKh, was the name of the early organ of Bolshevik economic planning, established shortly after the ill-fated October Revolution. Conceptualised as an organ for central planning of the whole country on the model of the Soviets, Lenin heralded it as the only organ to survive into communism, being the institution that would form the basis of the 'general administration' of that period. While it failed to live up to these expectations, with the Left of the VST dominant, these old views have re-emerged and the name of VSNKh has been repurposed.\n\nIn an imitation of the pyramid structure of the Congresses of Soviets, a system of Councils of National Economy is slowly being produced, regionally based and beholden to VSNKh as the organ of national planning at the top. These councils are tied to the Soviets and operate through their own Congress of Councils of National Economy. The defunct position of People's Commissar for the Organisation and Regulation of Production has been reintroduced, and the central planning advocate Sergey Syrtsov has been elected to the role. VSNKh has been granted wide-ranging powers and has begun issuing decrees to nationalise enterprises and bring them under its control, and is working to set up a central planning apparatus that will eventually embrace the whole country.\n\nThe move is controversial among sections of the VST embracing a syndicalist orthodoxy, as the trade unions and factory committees have been increasingly sidelined in favour of the Councils of National Economy and VSNKh as a doctrinally Leninist planning apparatus takes its place. Some commentators have noted with worry that this centralised structure may leave the planning apparatus at the mercy of more authoritarian forms, but for most, as long as democracy is maintained in the Soviets, they are happy to give it their blessing."
 socrus.431.a: "Only Planning can bring about the Communist Epoch!"

 socrus.432.t: "Asserting A Revolutionary Role"
 socrus.432.d: "Following the victory of the socialist forces, the International has opened itself to a wider array of political debate, the pressing matter of the Weltkrieg no longer relevant. The radically restructured state of Comrade Zinovyev has taken a particularly vocal role in these proceedings. Seen by many as embodying a doctrinal Leninism that few thought would reappear so aggressively following 1919, the 'Zinovyevites' as they have been dubbed, have dominated the debates in their internationalist zeal. Adopting the phrase 'Communard-Bolshevisation', they advocate a new binding programme for the International.\n\nThis has proved a controversial move, as up until now the International has lacked many centralised conditions for its member organisations besides a general commitment to revolution. In the enforcement of Communard-Bolshevisation, the Zinovyevites propose a new set of conditions for membership and a new programme to form the basis for the International's activity, framed as a step on the road to a 'world party' with a single nationally representative organisation for each country. While the Zinovyevites have made some rhetorical concessions to syndicalism, emphasising a shared base of support in the proletarian class beyond all others, republican-oriented factions have observed they are seemingly excluded from these plans, and many in the syndicalist camp are concerned by the influence the Zinovyevites would have on their autonomy.\n\nSome Leninist and councilist-oriented groups, namely Dutt's Vanguardists and a group among the Pankhurstites, have expressed support for at least some of the planks, but largely it has proven to be controversial, causing objections in every Congress at which the Zinovyevites speak. With accusations of 'Bakuninism' and 'Bonapartism' abounding, the ideological fractures that exist within the International are beginning to show."
 socrus.432.a: "They'd be wise to listen to our experience!"

 socrus.433.t: "An Internationalist War"
 socrus.433.d: "The constitution of the short-lived RSFSR was staunchly internationalist in nature, granting citizenship to all foreign workers in the country without 'cumbersome formalities'. It was on this basis that the Bolshevik government conducted political work among prisoners of war, much to the chagrin of the capitalist powers, and was quick to confer citizenship on them to legitimise its activities and grant them safety from reprisals at home. The VST has reintroduced this practice, allowing for a similarly simple legal route to citizenship for all foreign individuals of a working-class background. Unfettered by the limitations of the Brest-Litovsk peace and of the need to open itself up to a non-capitalist world, the population of foreign prisoners are split along class lines, and the proletariat and peasantry appealed to on the basis of class solidarity. Many have proven willing to accept a new political education and embrace a class-conscious outlook. Not only will this prove valuable for any future occupation of the Reichspakt, but additionally, many fervent individuals have taken up the internationalist cause wholeheartedly and have been put forward as acceptable candidates for auxiliary roles or even combat roles in the army."

 freerus.3.d.szrs: "General Vasily Boldyrev is a complicated figure - considered a principled defender of democracy by some, and a power-hungry traitor by others. Unusually for a high-ranking Russian officer, Boldyrev was and remains an open and defiant liberal. His outspokenness drew many like-minded soldiers to his orbit, coalescing into a 'clique' whose patience for Russia's growing radicalism finally broke on New Year's Day of 1929. The Boldyrev Putsch did force the government's hand in suppressing radicalism, but only after the revolt was crushed and its supporters forced into exile. Boldyrev himself has spent time in Ukraine and America.\n\nHe founded the Committee for a Free Russia in 1935 in Ukraine and has collaborated with anti-government resistance groups. But now our spies in the Russian dissident community in Berlin have told us about an early, discreet recruitment to the 'Army of Free Russia', likely a collaborationist group under German protection. The threat of this unified Russian rebel movement under Boldyrev's prestige and military skill, backed by German arms, cannot be ignored entirely. Klepikov has already assured that the best assassins are being picked, but it is unlikely that Boldyrev is caught - he has evaded all attempts on his life thus far. Still, we should be prepared to face his collaborators in the coming war."

 freerus.4.t: "Vasily Boldyrev Captured"
 freerus.4.d: "The last remnants of Boldyrev's 'Free Russian Army' have been defeated, and what's more, it's now reported that Vasily Boldyrev himself has been captured along with most of the Free Russian general staff. While the common Free Russian soldier is likely to face the impersonal grind of POW and filtration camps, the possible fates of Boldyrev and his closest comrades have captured public attention and speculation.\n\nAfter a hurried transfer to the capital under the strictest guard, the leaders of the now-defunct Free Russian Army have been arraigned and are awaiting a treason trial in the Moscow Court Chambers. Rather than involve the military for a court martial of so many former officers, the government has insisted on holding a civil trial, not only to provide the harshest punishment possible for such grave crimes against Russia, but also to deny the military an exclusive right to judge its own members when the loyalty of so many officers has proven weak. Nevertheless, the military will maintain a presence in the form of expert witnesses. The stage is set for the closing act of the Free Russian Army's existence."
 freerus.4.a: "An excellent day!"

 freerus.5.t: "Trial of the Free Russian Army"
 freerus.5.d: "While many expected the judgement of the Free Russian Army to be a bombastic show trial, a vivid reminder of Russia's strength and the destruction of her enemies, the reality has proven to be much more muted. No jeering crowds or flashbulbs greet the accused, who themselves have largely kept silent as they are marched in and out of the courtroom, day after interminable day. The mood has not been helped by a long spell of rain over Moscow, which has kept even the court steps clear of curious citizens. Inside, officers who once called each other comrades stare at one another, divided not just by benches but by years of bloodshed and mutual cruelty.\n\nThough hardly the only man to stand trial, Boldyrev has captured attention far more than most. With his hooded eyes and unshaven face, he gives off the impression of a hardened partisan, an old soldier who is stuck waging a hopeless war. Many call Boldyrev a traitor for good reason, but even his opponents have found it difficult not to sympathise with the man's uncompromising principles.\n\nAs the trial winds down to its conclusion, Boldyrev and his accomplices are told to stand. The presiding judge clears his throat, 'Accused - Boldyrev, Vasily Georgiyevich; year of birth - 1875; found guilty of rebellion against the ruling power; resistance to government orders and legal regulations; unauthorised appropriation of power, drafting forged orders and other governmental papers; high treason; and per article 108, article 249, article 263, and article 289 of the Criminal Code, he is to be...'"

 freerus.10.t: "The Free Russian Army Rises!"
 freerus.10.d: "Every war has its traitors, and the most accursed of these is Vasily Boldyrev, a former White general turned German lackey. In Berlin, Generalleutnant Boldyrev has been given a German-equipped army, recruited from prisoners of war and traitors, with the clear intent of acting as if they represent some kind of true Russia.\n\nThis laughably called 'Army of Free Russia' claims to fight for a free and democratic Russia, preaching harmony and peace with Germany. Idiotic at best, malicious at worst, treasonous in either case."

 freerus.11.t: "The Free Russian Army Rises!" #for GER/Oststaaten
 freerus.11.d: "A new army has risen to our ranks. The Free Russian Army, led by former White general Vasily Boldyrev, has been formed in Germany out of Russian prisoners of war and a number of émigrés. In the Kremlin, [RUS.GetLeader] has of course denounced him as a traitor, but to us, Boldyrev's claim of fighting for a free and democratic Russia rings promising.\n\nThe core of his declaration is this: it is better to stand against tyranny even at great cost, than to accept it and give up on a better future. Whether or not we take this as mere words, his movement does sabotage our greatest enemy, even if he accomplishes nothing else."

 freerus.20.t: "[RUS.GetLeader] Meets Vasily Boldyrev"
 freerus.20.d: "It pains the military leadership to negotiate with Vasily Boldyrev, a traitor, but to quote Kornilov's infamous words to Savinkov all the way back in 1917, sometimes the fact that you do not like each other must not stop you from doing what is for the good of the nation. Besides, it is not like Boldyrev is wholly hated - there is still understanding towards his choices, especially among those younger officers who never had much love for the SZRS to begin with. Ironically, Boldyrev's warning from 1929 rang true, and the history of Russia may have been different if his words had been heeded by Kornilov.\n\nBut both Savinkov and Kornilov are gone, and it is up to lesser figures to save the nation. The initial meeting was careful and probing, but it was agreed that ending the war was in both sides' advantage. [RUS_GetArmyChief] was very concerned about German influence over Boldyrev's so-called 'Free Russia', and was extremely bitter over the whole situation - but rational enough to recognise that there will not be a military miracle.\n\nBoldyrev's negotiators have proposed a deal. The [RUS.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] Government surrenders to the Free Russian Government, and [RUS_GetArmyChief] keeps command of the armed forces. Elections are to be arranged immediately, with those aligned with the earlier regime barred from running. Vasily Boldyrev and his allies are cleared of any treason charges, and their military ranks are reinstated."

 freerus.21.d: "A truce has been agreed to. Thankfully, [RUS.GetLeader] came to the harsh conclusion that even if the fight can go on in Samara, Kazan, Urals and other eastern strongholds, there is no hope of victory.\n\nThe Article of Surrender will surrender the Russian forces to the Free Russian Government, which will be recognised as the temporary administration until new elections can be organised as soon as possible. General Boldyrev and his allies will have their ranks reinstated in the Russian Army, and are cleared of any treason charges. In private negotiations away from German eyes, Boldyrev made it clear that he fully intends to keep Russia as sovereign and independent as possible and has no genuine pro-German views. To him, the Heer has been merely a hammer with which to restore the Russian Democratic Federative Republic, nothing else."
 freerus.21.a: "Peace, at last."

 ### Post-War Boldyrev Path
 freerus.40.t: "Restoration of the 1922 Constitution"
 freerus.40.d: "The Constituent Assembly of [GetYear] has been elected at a rapid pace, largely as a matter of formality. Large parts of the country are still in ruins and desolation, but nonetheless elections were able to be arranged - albeit with heavy restrictions on any movements with ties to the former leadership.\n\nThe Assembly was presided over by former president Vasily Maklakov, who had agreed to lend his gravitas to this last point of his political career. Maklakov's words sought to build trust and rapport in the broken society, and he argued that the 1922 Constitution was not irredeemable, but rather a good start. In the following months, the old Constitution was thoroughly rewritten, with many articles clarified and many issues the original had not solved. Presidential power was weakened greatly, especially with regard to emergency powers that Savinkov had so wilfully abused. The presidential term would be 5 years, and one additional term could be served. In addition, the judiciary was strengthened and power was distributed more fairly. A truly parliamentary system was not achieved, however, both because of Boldyrev's opposition and that of much of the political right."
 freerus.40.a: "It is still a good foundation to build on."

 freerus.41.t: "In Kolchak's Footsteps"
 freerus.41.d: "It is a historical irony that during the Russian Civil War, Boldyrev was a candidate for Supreme Leader, only to cede against Aleksandr Kolchak and be sent to the Far East. But now Boldyrev's role is much like that of Supreme Leader Kolchak, a benevolent warlord marching his forces through blood and sorrow for the Russian future. Obviously, Boldyrev has many more enemies and is often accused of Germanophilia, of being Berlin's puppet or a faux dictator with a democratic layer of paint, for opposing the will of the Russian people. But these do not change the fact that General Boldyrev is in undeniable control over the restored Russian Democratic Federative Republic.\n\nBoldyrev has already announced free elections will be held in two months, and the absorption of the Free Russian Army into the Russian Army proper. Likewise, the institutions of Free Russia are being either disbanded or merged with the restored Russian ones. Political parties are being hastily rebuilt from their ruins, with many old establishment parties rallying around their wartime leaders. Boldyrev himself seems to be favourable towards the progressives, but has been clear in his promise to respect the election outcome.\n\nThe land may be in ruins and many regions are controlled by Ukrainian, German or Belarusian forces, but finally it seems like Russia will have peace, for a time. For many, it feels like 1922 again."
 freerus.41.a: "Hopefully this second republic will survive longer than 14 years."

 freerus.42.t.nat: "'Boldyrevites' form the National Union"
 freerus.42.t.dem: "'Boldyrevites' form the Democratic Union"
 freerus.42.d.nat: "In his youth, Vasily Georgiyevich Boldyrev was rumoured to have been a member of the RSDRP, and consistently stayed in contact with Russia's liberal circles. But it must be said that what the Russian Republic has gone through does gnaw at one's idealism, no matter how strong it used to be. The old party system was unable to govern and was hijacked by both the extreme right and left. The revived Russian Republic deserves to have a stable government at least for the coming decade, to repair the untold damage caused by both Savinkov and the Reds.\n\nFor this purpose, Boldyrev persuaded Russia's political centre and moderate right to join forces in a coalition. This 'National Union' (NS) is formed around the battered remains of the Right-SRs, the Kadets, the VPP and various smaller right-wing groups. Many of them were persecuted by Savinkov's regime, and even more by the socialist secret police. To the National Union, Boldyrev's Volunteer Army has become a new foundational myth, the second time Russian patriots have saved their dear republic. The leadership includes men like Georgy Vernadsky, Nikolay Nekrasov, Mikhail Shatilov, and Georgy Okolovich. The monarchism of the right has been all but swept under the rug, and instead the NS programme is a mix of conservative republicanism, a promise of social reforms and support for the veterans and war widows."

This 'Democratic Union' (DS) is formed around the battered remains of the Kadets, the Socialist-Revolutionaries and the Social Democrats. Many of their leaders died during the Savinkovite terror, but a new generation has risen up to lead - brave men whose commitment to justice was shown through their actions in the anti-Savinkov resistance, not with mere words. The core of the DS are those who fought in the Free Russian forces and admire General Boldyrev. The leadership includes Nikolay Martyanov, Aleksandr Kulischer, Gergard Zeller, and Nikolay Nekrasov. With this grand electoral bloc behind the General, it should not be difficult to ensure smooth parliamentary support.\n\nThe DS has made Boldyrev their presidential candidate, and their programme includes a number of social reforms, further trials against the Svobodniks, and support for the workers and the veterans."

 freerus.43.t: "Socialism in the New Republic"
 freerus.43.d: "The Anti-Communist Laws of 1922 were never reinstated, as Vasily Boldyrev always had disdain for banning any political ideology. The VST has been forced to abolish itself, and the PSR is in a state of chaos. Many of the former socialist government and law enforcement members have been arrested, have left, or been forced out of politics. Many in the National Union are demanding further restrictions on socialism, though calmer voices, such as Pitirim Sorokin, have argued that the last time hardly worked, and instead the legal participation of socialists in the political system is the only way to ensure their moderation.\n\nThe left has been unable to form a coherent opposition bloc. The largest new group is the Social-Democratic People's Party (SDNP), owing its programme to Sergey Chakhotin and its organisation to trade unionist Gergard Zeller. In addition to them, the RDP's veterans around Aleksandr Titov have been discussing merging with the SDNP, and to the left of them there are multiple smaller groups, including what remains of the Left-Socialist-Revolutionaries.\nZeller's SDNP has adopted a reformist and conciliatory programme, focusing on parliamentarism and anti-militarism. They have promised to support Boldyrev's social reforms, but also to fight military influence and the 'toxic White division' of society with all their might."
 freerus.43.a: "Let us see if they can reform."
 freerus.43.b: "Keep them on close watch."

 freerus.44.t: "Crisis of the Russian Right"
 freerus.44.d: "The Russian right has perhaps never been this discredited. First, they were tainted by their support for the Tsarist autocracy. Now, the vast majority of them can be accused of ties to the SZRS regime, even if it was simply going with the flow or following orders. No party is untainted, but it is undoubtedly true that most of the right was ultimately willing to tolerate Savinkov, rather than take part in the resistance.\n\nAn attempt to restore the All-Russian Patriotic Party collapsed, as the party conference descended into accusations. Ivan Solonevich, who claimed to have always opposed Savinkov, attempted to sway the conference behind him unsuccessfully. His firebrand type of politics was quickly accused of just reheating Svobodism in a new format. Likewise, political monarchism is being questioned further, depriving old Russian conservatives of their one unifying factor.\n\nInstead, a new brand of conservatism is spearheaded by men who grew up in the republic, whose lives were defined more by anti-Svobodism than anti-Communism, men like Georgy Vernadsky, Georgy Okolovich, and Arkady Stolypin. They oppose Boldyrev's ambitions and what they see as eroding the parliamentary system, but ultimately they are in agreement on the Russian future: that of a republic of national healing. A new party programme, now under the name of 'All-Russian People's Party' (VNP), calls for parliamentarism, the rule of law, support for families and traditional values, and the 'demilitarisation' of Russian politics, no doubt a snub directed at the Boldyrevites."
 freerus.44.a: "I suppose we can work with them."
 freerus.44.b: "They can't be trusted."

 freerus.45.t: "First Elections of Free Russia"
 freerus.45.d: "The elections were largely centred around a single man - whether or not you agreed with Vasily Boldyrev's political platform.\n\nEver since his entrance into politics, Boldyrev has become an immensely divisive figure, and not only across ideological lines: from every ideological point of view, you can find Boldyrevites and anti-Boldyrevites.

Vasily Boldyrev's National Bloc - a largely centre-right movement - campaigns on traditional values and on a platform of stability. His opposition is composed chiefly of the Socialist-Revolutionaries and other progressive parties.\n\nEither way, they will not lead to problems for us, but the voice of the German Ambassador in Berlin does carry quite a bit of power in the cabinet politics of current Russia, still hoping to negotiate better terms for the war reparations."

 freerus.47.t: "Federal Solutions"
 freerus.47.d: "The history of North Caucasus is soaked in blood, but their most recent struggle was shared with us. The mountains served as a home for perhaps the boldest and the most resilient resistance movement against the tyrants that ruled over Russia mere years ago, and many of the Mountaineer peoples contributed greatly to the cause of the Russian Free Army. The Chechens, Ingushetians, Kabardians, Ossetians and many others waged their own war against the Russian army, supplied us with intel and fighters, and stood with us to the end.\n\nMuch like the Cossacks were rewarded after the Civil War, the Mountaineers must be given actual autonomy - not dysfunctional patchwork like OSKAB was, but true self-rule. General Sultan Klych-Girey, one of Boldyrev's allies during the war, has been a strong proponent of a federal solution together with German diplomatic overtures, as full independence seems - once again - to be out of reach."
 freerus.47.a: "Let us try again."

 freerus.49.t: "The Donbass Agreement"
 freerus.49.d: "Russian territory ceded to Ukraine was a considerable economic loss for them, and a major disruption to the local economy. Similarly, the Ukrainian administration has received devastated territory of questionable loyalty to Kyiv. On the Russian initiative, details of the Donbass Economic Zone have been hashed out with the Ukrainian government. The proposal would ensure that goods and services can flow freely in the Don region.\n\nThis will help Russian industries greatly, which used to rely on coal and iron from the region, and similarly it will keep this production in good shape on the Ukrainian side. Perhaps this free trade zone will be expanded in the future, but for now, the hope is that further integration of Russian and Ukrainian economies will serve to enrich them both."

 rusfor.1.t: "Korpus Polski"
 rusfor.1.d: "In the Great War, thousands of Poles served in the Polish Armed Force in the East. Within our modern borders, there live only around 200,000 Poles, but among them there is exceptional will to fight for liberating their country from German dominance and to take back those lands lost to Germany and Austria.\n\nA small corps has been formed under the leadership of General-Lieutenant Kazimierz Rumsza and in political cooperation with the Polish National Committee. While the corps has large numbers of Poles, much of the rank-and-file are not. This corps, flying both Russian and Polish flags, will hopefully be the one to march to Warsaw one day, to liberate our Slavic brethren from the Teutonic shackles!"

 rusfor.1.b: "They will serve in Russian units."

 rusfor.3.t: "Out with the Kaiser!"
 rusfor.3.d: "The propaganda campaign tracing its roots to the exiled National League has decried the war as the last chance for freedom. Borrowing many points from Russian material, it paints the current conflict as one for the world's very soul - whether it falls into the eternal shackles of Teutonic beast, stifling all of Slavdom in its iron grip, or the free world triumphs, and marches toward a better future as brothers. Those serving under German whips in the Polish army are decried for their misguided loyalty to the oppressor, and all kinds of civil resistance are called for - and armed resistance is all but said out loud. In the end, there is a promise that the Russian army will come - and in its ranks, General-Lieutenant Kazimierz Rumsza's Polish Corps marches to liberate Poland. Be brave, sons and daughters of Poland, for liberation shall soon be at hand!\n\nObviously, all of this was censored and those spreading such vile lies were arrested. This kind of insanity comes straight from the Russian propaganda department, but sadly it has found fertile ground in at least some Poles, likely because of the truly considerable amount of effort and funds that Moscow has put into this kind of mental sabotage."

 rusfor.4.d: "A first step towards Russian resurgence was made in the Baltics - the one place where we are genuinely greeted as liberators. After the formation of the Dvinsk Autonomy in 1935, the battle flags of Latvians and Estonians were raised once again, and guns started to stream over the border from Dvinsk. The Baltic 'Forest Brothers' - officially General Jānis Kurelis' Association of the Latvian National Guard, and its Estonian equivalent, the Armed Fighting Union, headed by Paul-August Lilleleht - are now waging a bloody guerrilla war against the Teuton.\n\nUnder the direction of General Frīdrihs Briedis, Commissioner of Dvinsk Autonomy, Kurelis' forces especially have received as much supplies as we have been able to deliver. And now it is time for the coup de grâce on the Baltic German slave state. A large number of Desants from the Paratrooper Corps, supported by a guerrilla brigade of Cossacks, were moved over Lake Peipus, where they made contact with the Forest Brothers. This operation, led by General Karlis Gopper and named after Aleksandr Nevsky's great victory against the Teutons on the ice of Lake Peipus, is meant to reinforce the ragtag army of the Forest Brothers with professional forces and the best Russian intel."

If one looks at Europe as a board of chess between the Germanic world and their enemies, then the defeat of the Spanish Revolution would only put Spain back in the arms of the Germans, something the French Government in Paris is keenly aware of. In a clandestine meeting between our Foreign Minister and the French Ambassador, a secret deal was proposed. Russia would remain neutral in the Spanish affair and block any attempts by Russian citizens to go fight in Spain, unless it is for the revolutionary cause. Spain would thus be considered part of the French sphere of influence. In return, the French promised to withdraw from funding socialist movements in Russia and Eastern Europe for the time being."
 rusfor.8.a: "Spain will be considered to be in the French sphere, for now."
 rusfor.8.b: "Do we not fight against communism in all its forms?"

 rusfor.9.t: "Russian Volunteer Corps in Spain"
 rusfor.9.d: "To the Russians, our struggle against socialism has been followed with great interest and sympathy - it's an almost religious adherence that the White Movement pays to the anti-socialist struggles around the world. Many veterans of the Russian Civil War view this fight as their moral responsibility and purpose, something only the crucible of their own civil war can prepare a man for.\n\nThe main force of the Russian Volunteer Corps arrived today in Coruña, under the leadership of general-major of the Volunteer Army, Nikolay Vsevolodovich Shinkarenko. Many of Shinkarenko's volunteers are veterans of their own civil war, who were granted permission by the army to join the Spanish ranks under uniform without a Russian flag. Shinkarenko's group is officially here as private individuals, but it is obvious, given their quality equipment and good funding, that they have powerful backers back home. Together we will surely win."
 rusfor.9.a: "We are brothers on this crusade."

 rusfor.10.t: "Aid from Russia?"
 rusfor.10.d: "The Russian Foreign Ministry has come to us with an offer of economic and military aid, citing the longstanding friendship between our countries and the need to stand united against German domination in Europe.\n\nWhat should we say in response?"
 rusfor.10.a: "Of course!"
 rusfor.10.b: "We don't need their help."

 rusfor.11.t: "The Kama Tank Centre"
 rusfor.11.d: "As part of our deepening cooperation with Russia, a tank school has been opened near the city of Kazan, where our tank commanders have learned valuable new skills and methods of tank warfare.\n\nThis deepening cooperation should allow us to overcome the Germans one day!"
 rusfor.11.a: "Splendid."

 rusfor.12.t: "Russia requests Military Access"
 rusfor.12.d: "We have recently received communications from [RUS.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], stressing the precarious post-war situation in our immediate periphery.\n\nThey request that they be granted authorisation to freely move their military and naval assets within our borders and docks, in exchange for diplomatic assurances to not interfere in our sovereignty and to protect us from external threats."
 rusfor.12.a: "A precarious situation indeed."
 rusfor.12.b: "The only threat is you."

 rusfor.13.t: "[FROM.GetNameDef] accepts our Proposal"
 rusfor.13.d: "[FROM.GetNameDef] has seen the dangerous place they are situated in and has granted us permission to freely move our troops and fleets in return for security and non-interference with their state."
 rusfor.13.a: "Wonderful."

 rusfor.14.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] rejects our Proposal"
 rusfor.14.d: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] has stood fast and passed up our deal, ultimately not seeing it as a worthwhile endeavour and concluding that it would pose a greater risk to them, as foreign observers would see it as closer alignment to [RUS.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]."
 rusfor.14.a: "Unfortunate."

 rusfor.15.t: "Meddling in Latvia"
 rusfor.15.d: "Liberty in Latvia! Backed by Russian arms, the brave sons of Latvia have taken power in their own country and are now in the middle of a Constituent Assembly. General Jānis Kurelis has emerged as the leader of the liberty struggle and has connections in political circles of Dvinsk and Russia.\n\nHis patriots are challenged by various liberals, progressives, and socialists. The actual liberals are minuscule in importance, and should Kurelis lose, it will only lead to Bolshevik Jēkabs Peterss rising to power. Our Foreign Office has already proposed a plan to funnel support to Kurelis and ensure that he can keep Latvia in order, under his iron fist."
 rusfor.15.a: "Yes, ensure his victory."
 rusfor.15.b: "Latvians can handle their own matters."

 ### Finland Border Clash
 rusfor.21.t: "Testing the Eagle"
 rusfor.21.d: "Germany is more distracted now than they have ever been. The most enthusiastic patriots are calling for a war, but anyone understands the folly of such proposals. However, a message could be sent.\n\nAs a military advisor to the Vozhd, Vladimir Manstein has proposed an 'aggressive recon operation' against Finland in the disputed region of Repola. An operation against the 'core allies' of Germany would be too risky, but a poke at the more distant German sphereling could show if Berlin is still willing to stand by their smaller client states. In the best-case scenario, the Russian army could secure control of Repola and the strategically important Rukajärvi Road, and most importantly, it could be sold as a propaganda victory: Russia's first step towards crushing the German yoke! If it fails... well, it can be written off as a minor recon mission.\n\nIs Manstein's plan greenlit?"
 rusfor.21.a: "Make the necessary preparations."
 rusfor.21.b: "Sounds pointless."

 rusfor.22.t: "Skirmish over Torosozero"
 rusfor.22.d: "In the dead of night, multiple brigades started crossing the ice of Lake Torosozero and took the border guards on the other side by surprise. Our forces almost captured the border town of Repola, which guards the road to the inland, but the surprisingly brave resistance of the Finns managed to delay our forces for hours until the town was ours.\n\nOur units were preparing to opportunistically continue south, but they soon encountered reinforcements a few dozen miles from Repola. The Finns struck from the forest but were too few to seriously threaten our forces. Casualties have begun to mount on both sides, and the snowy forest soon turned into a frozen graveyard."
 rusfor.22.a: "We can handle a bit of snow."
 rusfor.22.b: "Send in reinforcements."

 rusfor.23.t: "Skirmish over Torasjärvi"
 rusfor.23.d: "In the dead of night, Russian units crossed the frozen lakes of Torasjärvi and Liekajärvi in distant Karelia. The border forces resisted bravely for hours and managed to keep the enemies from the town of Repola long enough for reinforcements to be sent from Mikkeli. After taking the town, Russians continued south along the only paved road within sixty kilometres.\n\nThey soon encountered the first reinforcements before the village of Tuulivaara, and a quick Russian advance turned into a chaotic, bloody fight in the no-man's-forest.\n\nAs the news spread the next morning, many were anxious and feared if this was only the first act in a greater Russian invasion. A diplomatic note was sent to Moscow to demand immediate cessation of hostilities, and another telegram went straight to Berlin. There were truly dark clouds on the horizon."
 rusfor.23.a: "We can handle a bit of snow."

 rusfor.24.t: "Diplomatic Note from Helsinki"
 rusfor.24.d: "As soon as knowledge of the fighting reached Helsinki, a telegram was sent demanding immediate cessation of hostilities and a withdrawal from the town of Repola.\n\nThe tone was strict, yet carefully polite, as if trying not to annoy us too much. It contained no mention of Germany, though that tells us nothing yet."
 rusfor.24.a: "Ignore this demand."

 rusfor.25.t: "Defeat in Repola" #for RUS
 rusfor.25.d: "It seems that we underestimated the tenacity of the Finns. After their reinforcements arrived, they started to slowly whittle down our forces through relentless assaults in the forests. While casualties were not terribly high, morale quickly plummeted as a quick show of strength turned into a bloody, frozen nightmare. Forces were quickly withdrawn towards Repola, but holding onto the town was deemed pointless given the current state of our forces.\n\nHowever, the skirmish was not for nothing. The Germans seemed inactive and only issued diplomatic protests later on, while the Finns seemed shocked. We also acquired a small stockpile of their newest Suomi submachine guns, which were definitely the tool that won the battle for the Finns. Mass usage of submachine guns at close range is something we should investigate for our own shock formations."
 rusfor.25.a: "We'll have a rematch eventually."

 rusfor.26.t: "Victory in Repola" #for FIN
 rusfor.26.d: "The counter-attack was a success. The numerically superior Russian force was cut into pieces by small, ski-equipped units operating on their flanks, and soon their morale plummeted in their most critical units. The Russians started to withdraw towards the town of Repola, which they hoped to keep, but were too slow as Captain Aarne Juutilainen's team managed to capture the municipal house of Repola and set up machine guns there. The Russians were far too demotivated to attempt to storm their positions, so the general order was given to draw the entire force back behind the border lake.\n\nThe whole incident left an odd feeling. Was it intimidation? Would it have escalated into a proper war had the Russians advanced further? Or was it just a product of Savinkov's erratic and insane ideology? Whatever it was, the Germans did not seem too concerned - they only demanded the Russians investigate the affair, and they apparently sent some local commander, blamed for the entire thing, to Irkutsk. They will forget the encounter in a month, but the Finns will be anxious about it for years to come."
 rusfor.26.a: "Hopefully there won't be a rematch."

 rusfor.27.t: "Victory in Repola" #for RUS
 rusfor.27.d: "The Finnish counter-attack was tenacious and bloody. Only through a miracle did the morale of our forces not collapse after days of harassment through the forests - but ultimately the Russian spirit prevailed. Repola was left in our hands, with the Finns no doubt directing more forces to the area. Our forces were prepared to occupy the border region, but another note was delivered to the Kremlin - this time from the German ambassador.\n\nOn behalf of the Finnish government, Germany has demanded the Russian government immediately withdraw their forces and offer an explanation for their outrageous violation of Finnish sovereignty. It was obvious that the Germans were not really that interested beyond their precious prestige. They were satisfied after being assured that our 'local commander', whose rashness had started the whole incident, would be transferred to Irkutsk.\n\nIn addition to the propaganda victory, we also acquired a small stockpile of Finland's newest Suomi submachine guns, which were used against us with great effect. Mass usage of submachine guns at close range is something we should investigate for our own shock formations."
 rusfor.27.a: "We'll have a rematch eventually."

 rusfor.28.t: "Defeat in Repola" #for FIN
 rusfor.28.d: "Despite our tenacious counter-attacks with additional forces, the Russians didn't budge. Some of the forward units were destroyed or forced to withdraw, but the main body of the Russians defended around Repola well. As casualties grew on both sides, we had to cut down our losses and cease attacks for now.\n\nAs more units were sent to the border, we informed Berlin of our dire situation. Soon enough they demanded that Savinkov withdraw his forces, and apparently the man responsible for the attack - some local officer - was sent to Irkutsk. The Russians left Repola after plundering a small weapons depot there, and our forces manned the border again.\n\nThe whole incident left an odd feeling. Was it intimidation? Would it have escalated into a proper war, had the Russians advanced further? Or was it just a product of Savinkov's erratic and insane ideology? The Russians will forget the encounter in a month, but the Finns will be anxious about it for years to come."
 rusfor.28.a: "Hopefully there won't be a rematch."

# Finland Crisis Events
 rusfor.30.t: "Demands to Finland"
 rusfor.30.d: "Finland, while unremarkable and poor, poses a grave threat to our northern flank against Germany. The Karelian Isthmus offers the perfect springboard for a German invasion of Petrograd - one can shell the city without ever leaving Finland. For this reason, it is of utmost importance to neutralise the threat of Finland.\n\nThe first option would be the diplomatic one: demand anti-German neutrality from Finland and promise to respect their sovereignty - a relationship that could later become a proper alliance. The other option is to drop the pretext and demand territorial concessions in the Karelian Isthmus to ensure that the Finns cannot threaten Petrograd even if they wanted to.\n\nWe should start moving forces to the Finnish border to bolster our demands - and if the negotiations go sour, exchange the quill for a sword."
 rusfor.30.a: "Demand pro-Russian neutrality."
 rusfor.30.b: "Demand territorial concessions."

 rusfor.31.t.yya: "Moscow Demands a Treaty of Friendship"
 rusfor.31.t.karelia: "Moscow Demands Border Adjustment"
 rusfor.31.d.yya: "'As surely as winter follows autumn, the enemy comes from the east.'\n\nThe proximity of Petrograd to the Finnish border has always been a constant thorn in our relationship with Russia. Their great fear is that the Karelian Isthmus will be used as a springboard by the German army against Russia's Baltic jewel.\n\nA draft of the Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation has been forwarded to the desk of [FIN.GetLeader]. This proposed treaty would ensure a pact of non-aggression between our two nations and allow Russian forces and ships to utilise our bases for the defence of Petrograd. Additionally, we would grant Russia the same economic benefits as those we grant to the states of Mitteleuropa. We would also be forbidden from committing to a military alliance with any power hostile to Russia. While the text talks of neutrality, it is obviously a pro-Russian neutrality.\n\nWhile there has been some military build-up on the border to bolster the demands, it seems surprisingly reasonable of the Russians. It would still obviously limit our sovereignty - and possibly leave us diplomatically isolated, should the Russians decide to demand more. Alternatively, we could always attempt to appeal to the Germans for protection, though it would no doubt increase our dependence on Mitteleuropa."
 rusfor.31.d.karelia: "'As surely as winter follows autumn, the enemy comes from the east.'\n\nThe proximity of Petrograd to the Finnish border has always been a constant thorn in our relationship with Russia. Their great fear is that the Karelian Isthmus will be used as a springboard by the German army against Russia's Baltic jewel. These territorial demands are merely defensive in nature, the Russian delegation has assured, but we can see them for what they are: naked aggression against our sovereignty.\n\nThe Russians are demanding the Karelian Isthmus and a number of smaller concessions, such as the Outer Isles of the Finnish Gulf and the right to utilise Finnish territory and naval bases to defend Petrograd.\n\nRussian forces are already being mobilised on our borders, ready to bolster their demands with military threats. While we may be outmatched in numbers and industrial production, our military urges us not to surrender an inch of land without a fight, claiming that the loss of the Isthmus would cripple us should Russia decide once more to encroach on our sovereignty. Of course, recognising our weakness before Russia, we could always attempt to appeal to the Germans for protection, though it would no doubt increase our dependence on Mitteleuropa. And of course, there is the option to accept the Russian demands and avoid spilling any blood."
 rusfor.31.a: "Trust Russia? Never!"
 rusfor.31.b: "Appeal to Berlin for help."
 rusfor.31.c: "Peaceful relations with Russia are a priority."

 rusfor.32.t: "Russo-Finnish Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation"
 rusfor.32.d.finland: "The national mood was not entirely cheery as news of the Agreement of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance with Russia was signed. The language used in the treaty was rosy, and in it Russia assured their respect for Finnish sovereignty, and intent to defend Finland against any aggression by third-party powers. Finland was declared to be neutral and to maintain friendly relations with all of its neighbours. To achieve this, Russia was granted freedom to utilise Finnish military bases, and a number of smaller islands in the Finnish Gulf were leased to Russia to protect Petrograd. Additionally, the economic appendix included easing restrictions on trade.\n\nWhile the treaty has clarified the Finnish-Russian relationship for now, it does leave much up in the air. A common fear is that it is only the first of many Russian demands, which Finland will now be less able to resist. Still, a much more dangerous bullet - war with Russia - was dodged."
 rusfor.32.d.russia: "Signing the Agreement of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance with Finland was a clear propaganda victory for [RUS.GetLeader]'s government. While the language used in the treaty was purposefully rosy, with our assurances to respect Finnish sovereignty and neutrality, the real achievement was clear: Finland was barred from allying with Germany, and this was enforced by our right to utilise Finnish soil to defend Petrograd against any foreign threats. Additionally, a number of smaller islands in the Finnish Gulf were leased to us, and the economic appendix included easing restrictions on trade. Hopefully, we can persuade the Finns to accept an even closer alliance in the future."
 rusfor.32.a: "Could have been worse."
 rusfor.32.b: "Welcome back!"

 rusfor.33.t: "Finland Agrees to Demands"
 rusfor.33.d: "The Finns may be stubborn, but even they can recognise that a war with us would result in nothing but blood spilled for a hopeless cause. Faced with an overwhelming show of force, the Finnish government has agreed to our demands, and our units are already moving in to occupy the region.\n\nThis bloodless conquest is celebrated as a great victory for [RUS.GetLeader]'s government, the first step on the long road to tearing up Brest-Litovsk, his supporters claim. Regardless, all recognise the triumph as a sign that Russia has returned to the world stage."
 rusfor.33.a: "Wise of them."

 rusfor.34.t: "Finland Appeals for German Help"
 rusfor.34.d: "Russia has issued demands to Finland, wishing to force them to cut ties with us and give the Russians various concessions. While the Russians portray this as merely defensive action to protect Petrograd from potential aggression, it is obvious to us that it's merely a matter of Russian expansionism.\n\nRecognising their weakness before Russia, the Finnish government has requested us to intervene on their behalf. Preventing this power grab would send a decisive message to [RUS.GetLeader]'s government, as well as reaffirm Finland's place in our sphere of influence, but we cannot force Russia to back down without sacrifice. In order to entice them, it is probable that we need to make some backroom economic deals, potentially weakening our future negotiating position."
 rusfor.34.a: "Make the offer."
 rusfor.34.b: "No, they are on their own."

 rusfor.35.t: "Germans Refuse Assistance"
 rusfor.35.d: "The worst has come to pass. Citing their economic interests in Russia and claiming that the dispute does not concern them, the Germans have declined to intervene.\n\nOur government has been thrown into crisis by Germany's betrayal. Refusing the demands would lead us into a war where we would be badly outmatched, but accepting Russian demands, while it may preserve peace, would threaten our national security in the event of a future war between ourselves and Russia. Either way, we must come to a decision soon, or else..."
 rusfor.35.a: "Refuse the Russian demands anyway."
 rusfor.35.b: "Give in."

 rusfor.36.t: "Germans Intervene in Dispute"
 rusfor.36.d: "The Finns have realised that they're no match for us in strength, but rather than accepting our demands, it seems they've gone running to the Germans for protection. Unsurprisingly, the German Empire's foreign minister has claimed that Russia must respect her diplomatic obligations and honour the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, but using diplomatic backchannels, the Germans have also offered to sell back certain industries to us at a generous price, essentially offering a bribe.\n\nMany in our government are urging the [RUS_leader] to accept the offer. While Finland is of strategic interest, recovering our economic sovereignty is vital for moving Russia towards full independence from Germany's influence. However, this kind of shady dealing with Germany could be seen as a sign of weakness in the government by the people. If we decide to reject Germany's offer, public opinion and the economic crisis would prevent them from launching a full-scale intervention."
 rusfor.36.a: "We'll accept this compromise."
 rusfor.36.b: "Refuse and push the demand."

 rusfor.37.t.finland: "Germany Arranges Compromise"
 rusfor.37.t.germany: "Russia Accepts Compromise"
 rusfor.37.d.finland: "Our dear friends in Germany have come to our aid, stating that Russia must respect her diplomatic obligations and honour the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk - and if they do not, military force would be considered. The Russians, undoubtedly realising the wide gap in strength between themselves and the Reichspakt, have backed down, already demobilising units stationed close to the border.\n\nA series of Russian asset sales by German corporations at suspiciously generous prices, however, have brought some to believe that the German Empire has exchanged their economic influence in Moscow to protect their northern ally. Whatever the case, our people are grateful for the Germans."
 rusfor.37.d.germany: "In a move many have seen as inevitable, it seems the Russians have accepted our compromise. Russian forces near the Finnish border have begun to demobilise, and as promised, certain large corporations have been encouraged to sell their assets in Russia to state corporations.\n\nOur influence in the East may have been weakened, but Russia's territorial ambitions have been constrained, and Finland's ties to Mitteleuropa have only been increased. This development is widely seen as a victory for us."
 rusfor.37.a: "Hurray!"

 rusfor.38.t.finland: "Russia Refuses German Compromise"
 rusfor.38.t.germany: "Russia Refuses Compromise"
 rusfor.38.d.finland: "Our dear friends in Germany have come to our aid, or rather, they have attempted to. In a recent statement by the empire's foreign minister, the German government claimed that Russia must respect her diplomatic obligations, while rumours circulated that Germany was willing to surrender part of their economic influence over Moscow as compensation. However, Russia has refused to back down. [RUS.GetLeader] has given a statement in which he claimed that these demands are a matter of national security for Russia, and no amount of backroom politics will change that.\n\nDespite the hopes of many in the government, our ambassador to Germany has also quietly informed [FIN.GetLeader] that the mood in Germany is decidedly against a full-scale intervention, meaning that if we refuse the Russian terms again, we'll be on our own. Whether we choose to give in to Russian demands or stand firm, we must take a decisive stance, and quickly."
 rusfor.38.d.germany: "Despite our generous overtures, Russia has refused to back down. [RUS.GetLeader] has given a statement in which he claimed that these demands are a matter of national security for Russia, and no amount of backroom politics will change that.\n\nThe hawks in our government have urged us to prepare a full-scale intervention, resorting to war if necessary, but the disastrous economic and political situation at home, as well as a war-wary public, would make such an action so unpopular as to be unworkable. For now, we have advised the Finns to avoid a full military stand-off with Russia."
 rusfor.38.a: "Never surrender!"
 rusfor.38.b: "Give in."
 rusfor.38.c: "We expect no less from these warmongers."

 rusfor.39.t: "Finland Refuses Demands"
 rusfor.39.d: "Our demands have been much too great to accept. While the Finns have been playing for time by discussing the minutiae, they have been mobilising forces in preparation for the war - possibly hoping for German military help.\n\nIt seems that diplomats have failed, and it is time for the soldiers to stand up."
 rusfor.39.a: "Then war it is!"
 rusfor.39.b: "Back down."

 rusfor.40.t: "The Russians are Winning"
 rusfor.40.d: "Despite the brave efforts of our troops, our worst fears are beginning to be realised - the Russians have overwhelmed Vyborg, and with control of the city, now possess the capability to push further into our nation, possibly even threatening the capital.\n\nIf we continue to fight on, it is likely the entire nation will be overrun. The vast majority of our generals and politicians urge us to sue for peace before it's too late, though a few hardliner hawks believe the situation may still be turned around."
 rusfor.40.a: "We have no choice."
 rusfor.40.b: "We will fight to the last man!"

 rusfor.41.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Sues for Peace"
 rusfor.41.d: "Given the hopeless situation the Finns had led themselves into, it was only a matter of time before they faced the inevitable. Today, these beliefs have been proven correct as the Finnish government, its armies chased from Vyborg and reeling from our offensives, has offered a conditional surrender on our terms.\n\nFinland will cede the region of Vyborg to our nation in return for peace. These terms are what we originally demanded. Having achieved our primary objective, many in our government urge us to accept the deal, claiming that attempting to push further would run the risk of German intervention. Of course, the Finns are unlikely to give up completely on Vyborg. It may be wiser to ensure Petrograd's security in a more permanent manner..."
 rusfor.41.d2: "Given the hopeless situation the Finns had led themselves into, it was only a matter of time before they faced the inevitable. Today, these beliefs have been proven correct as the Finnish government, its armies chased from Vyborg and reeling from our offensives, has offered a conditional surrender on our terms.\n\nFinland will cede the region of Vyborg to our nation in return for peace.

 rusfor.41.a: "Accept their surrender."
 rusfor.41.b: "Refuse - march onwards!"

 rusfor.42.t: "Russia Agrees to Peace"
 rusfor.42.d: "After hours of last-minute negotiations between our foreign ministers, Russia has finally accepted our terms of surrender, ending the conflict.\n\nThe scars the war has left on our nation may not heal for quite some time - the region of Vyborg was home to over 400,000 souls now stripped from their homeland, as well as a substantial portion of our industry. We fought as best we could, yet in the end, this is a sad day for Finland."
 rusfor.42.a: "Alas..."

 rusfor.43.t: "Russia Refuses Peace"
 rusfor.43.d: "Despite our numerous attempts at reaching a peace settlement, the Russians have wholly rejected negotiations and now demand our complete submission! This outcome is nothing short of disastrous for our nation. Left with few other options, our only chance of preserving our independence and pressuring the Russians to withdraw would be to call upon the Germans for intervention.\n\nEven in spite of the economic crisis, the prospect of a Russian-dominated Finland would probably be too dangerous for them to ignore, though it would mean surrendering Vyborg to Russia as compensation. And of course, there still remains the option, however reckless, to reject German intervention and fight to the last man."
 rusfor.43.a: "We have no choice but to fight on."
 rusfor.43.b: "Call on the Germans for help!"

 rusfor.44.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] on the Brink"
 rusfor.44.d: "The Russo-Finnish war has reached a turning point. Russian forces have captured Vyborg, achieving their stated objective for the war, but now seem determined to subjugate all of Finland. Left with no other options, the Finnish government has submitted a plea to us through their ambassador, practically begging us to force the Russians to stand down.\n\nFor many in our government, there are few reasons not to intervene. Allowing the Russians to dominate that country would not only be a direct challenge to our sphere of influence, but it would also shake the confidence of our Eastern European allies, all of whom have much to fear from the new Russian regime's aggressive rhetoric. Intervention, however, would come at a cost. We could threaten to pull out of the country, sending them into severe economic troubles, but without offering Vyborg as compensation - in effect agreeing to Russia's original demands - there is no chance of forcing Moscow to back down. Further compensation would also have to be offered through the surrender of a part of our economic influence, weakening our hand should the Russians encroach upon Eastern Europe once more."
 rusfor.44.a: "Do it - Finland is a friend."
 rusfor.44.b: "We don't like them THAT much."

 rusfor.45.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Refuses"
 rusfor.45.d: "We have been betrayed. The Germans, unwilling to jeopardise their economic interests in Russia or simply too marked by the scars of the Great War to risk fighting another one, have refused all of our requests for intervention.\n\nUpon the breaking of the news, a trickle of high-ranking politicians have already begun to flee abroad, while morale among our armed forces sinks lower and lower. We are on our own."
 rusfor.45.a: "To the bitter end, then."

 rusfor.46.t: "Germans Intervene in Peace Talks"
 rusfor.46.d: "Even with the ongoing volatile international climate, it seems the Germans are still determined to salvage what they can out of their crumbling empire. The German Empire's foreign minister has made a public statement condemning our war with Finland and calling for an immediate resolution to the crisis. We've also heard rumours of German troops preparing to mobilise at a moment's notice, and, perhaps a much more real prospect, German corporations have threatened to pull out of our country if we 'continue to jeopardise stability in Europe', wreaking economic havoc over the nation.\n\nFew believe that the Germans would be willing to act so hastily over Finland, but the possibility has intimidated many in our government into seeking a solution. Communicating through diplomatic backchannels, the Germans have secretly offered to let us walk away with Vyborg, our stated goal in the war, along with offering the more immaterial compensation of a sale of Russian assets owned by German companies at a price far below their value, effectively lowering their economic influence over our country in return for peace. Unfortunately, the threat of war, offer of compensation, and still-great German economic influence holding a dagger over our industries mean that we have no choice but to accept."
 rusfor.46.a: "How dare they!"

 rusfor.47.t.finland: "Germans Agree to Intervene"
 rusfor.47.t.germany: "Russians Stand Down"
 rusfor.47.d.finland: "The Germans may be struggling to keep their empire together, but even they can't accept an ally such as ourselves falling to a hostile power. The German Empire's foreign minister has made a public statement condemning Russian aggression on our nation, calling for an immediate resolution to the crisis. Though the threat of direct German intervention was unlikely, the Russians have backed down. In a treaty signed earlier today, we officially ceded Vyborg to [RUS.GetNameDef], but they were forced to drop their claims on the rest of our territory.\n\nA series of Russian asset sales by German companies at prices far below their real value and coerced buy-outs have also brought many to suspect that the Germans have sacrificed a part of their economic influence in Moscow to the Russian government as compensation for the treaty. Whatever the case, our independence has been secured once more."
 rusfor.47.d.germany: "Seemingly unable to risk the smaller threat of war and far closer prospect of economic ruin should we choose to wield our economic influence, the Russians have signed a peace settlement with Finland, gaining Vyborg and promising not to seek any more territory from that country. We may have saved a vital ally, but unfortunately, the compensation offered to Moscow won't be easy to gain back.\n\nThe Russian government has bought back Russian assets from many of our companies, weakening our influence there. Even worse, we've received reports of coerced sales, no doubt as further backlash due to our attempts to halt the country's aggressive expansion. Few believe these costs outweigh the benefits of reaffirming Finland's place in our sphere, though."
 rusfor.47.a: "Thank God for Germany."
 rusfor.47.b: "The Finns had better be grateful."

 rusfor.48.t: "The Finns are Winning"
 rusfor.48.d: "Given the colossal difference in manpower, industry, and size between ourselves and Finland, many believed that the conflict over Vyborg would be a short affair, ending with Russian soldiers parading triumphantly through Helsinki. The reality has turned out to be quite different. Our commanders have proved incompetent, our soldiers undisciplined, and our foe far more tenacious than we expected.\n\nThe Finns have made advances into our territory, capturing key cities and humiliating our soldiers in battle after battle. While there are those among us who refuse to accept defeat, taking such a hardline stance would likely only embarrass us further and bring our regime crumbling down."
 rusfor.48.a: "We have no choice."

 rusfor.49.t: "Russians Sue for Peace"
 rusfor.49.d.winning: "In spite of the world's doubt, the Finnish David has triumphed over the Russian Goliath. [RUS.GetLeader] has led his nation into a war against an enemy which he has gravely underestimated. Our intelligence networks report that morale among Russian troops has sunk to a new low, while public opinion in that nation has turned decisively against the [RUS_leader].\n\nAs our soldiers have advanced into Russian territory, capturing key cities and proving their military is unable to so much as defend their homeland, the Russians have now offered us peace. Not only has [RUS.GetNameDef] offered to drop their claims on our lands, but we've also been offered control over our claims in Northern Russia. With nothing more to be gained from continuing the war, there is no reason not to accept."
 rusfor.49.d.timeout: "In spite of the world's doubt, the Finnish David has triumphed over the Russian Goliath. [RUS.GetLeader] has led his nation into a war against an enemy which he has clearly underestimated. Undoubtedly believing at first that their forces would easily smash through our defences, the Russian army has time and time again failed to advance into our territory, at most making minor gains before our stiff resistance forces them back.\n\nOur intelligence networks also report that morale among Russian troops has sunk to a new low, while public opinion has turned decisively against the [RUS_leader]. Now admitting defeat, the Russians have offered us peace. We will retain sovereignty over all of our nation, and [RUS.GetNameDef] will drop their claims on Vyborg. With little more to be gained from continuing the war, there is no reason not to accept."
 rusfor.49.a: "Unbelievable!"
 rusfor.49.b: "A great day for Finland."

 rusfor.50.t: "Stalemate in the Russo-Finnish War"
 rusfor.50.d: "Despite the confidence of our armed forces and support of our people, Finnish resistance has proven far greater than we expected. [RUS.GetLeader] promised a quick victory. The arrogant Finnish nation would be 'overwhelmed' by the might of the Russian army, or so he claimed. The reality, however, has been that we are unable to so much as capture Vyborg, a little over 100km north of Petrograd, much less 'overwhelm' anyone.\n\nOur poor performance in the war has already begun to dampen morale. Desertion and defiance among the ranks grow each day, while [RUS.GetLeader] himself has come under increasing scrutiny for leading the nation into a war for which it was not prepared. Should we continue to push on with the war, it will only bring our government closer to collapse - we have no choice but to cut our losses and make peace while we're still the ones in charge."
 rusfor.50.a: "A sad day for Russia."

 rusfor.51.t: "Agreement of Russo-Finnish Friendship"
 rusfor.51.d: "[From.GetNameDefCap] has sent us a surprising proposal. To ensure the safety of both Petrograd and [FIN.GetNameDef] against the ever-present German aggression, our two nations must put aside their disagreements and work together for a safer Baltic region. The Russians are giving up any claims they have on our territory if, in exchange, we ally with them and agree to defend the region together and not cede to German pressure.\nThere is a thinly veiled edge to their words, almost a kind of presumed acceptance, but their offer seems genuine."
 rusfor.51.a: "Quite a surprise, but a welcome one."
 rusfor.51.b: "This is another of their plots. No!"

 rusfor.52.t: "$rusfor.74.t$"
 rusfor.52.d: "[FIN.GetNameDefCap] has refused our generous offer to take them under our protection. Perhaps we underestimated their stubbornness."
 rusfor.52.a: "We will deal with them shortly..."

### Mongolia
 rusfor.54.t: "Stalemate in the Mongolian War"
 rusfor.54.d: "We have been unable to make progress against the Mongolians, despite our best efforts.\n\nWe are now forced to stand down before we embarrass ourselves further."
 rusfor.54.a: "A sad day for Russia."

### Other Foreign Policy Events ###

 rusfor.64.t: "Moscow Proposes an Entente"
 rusfor.64.d: "The Russians, victorious over Germany, have rapidly positioned themselves as the first and foremost enemy of the Third International. Previously, our differing views on cooperation with Germany hindered our closer cooperation, but now they are trying to rally all anti-socialist nations into a single bloc.\n\nThus, they have offered us an alliance that would formally bind our own Entente with that of the Russians, re-creating the Entente Powers of old - targeted against the revolutionary powers still holding Western Europe."
 rusfor.64.a: "Let the Reds tremble!"

 rusfor.65.t: "New Entente Cordiale"
 rusfor.65.d: "We were allies with the French and the British governments in the Great War, and even if our enemies have changed, the bonds between us have not. Bad blood is forgotten - after all, did the British not at least try to help us in our darkest hour, did they not stand the bitter cold of Arkhangelsk together with the Northern Volunteer Army? Just like us, they have suffered greatly in the hands of the revolutionaries.\n\nBut now, we have found common chord again, after the demise of Germany. An official pact has been signed between our governments, creating the Entente Cordiale between us once more."
 rusfor.65.a: "Let the Reds tremble!"
 RUS_entente: "New Entente"

 rusfor.70.t: "[FROM.GetName] Offers Us an Alliance"
 rusfor.70.d: "We've received a request today from [From.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. They wish to invite us into a mutually beneficial military alliance.\n\nWhile [From.GetNameDef] certainly needs all the help it can get in these uncertain times we should also contemplate the risk of being brought into unwanted entanglements with other nations. How should we respond?"
 rusfor.70.a: "We accept."
 rusfor.70.b: "We want the return of our claims in exchange."
 rusfor.70.c: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] should not be trusted."
 RUS_ENT_merge_tt: "§CAll members of the Entente will be invited alongside us.§!"

 rusfor.71.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Has Accepted!"
 rusfor.71.d: "[From.GetNameDefCap] has rightfully agreed to join our alliance and has pledged to help us in our wars in exchange for protection.\n\nThis should show the world that not all are unwilling to work with the Russian Bear!"
 rusfor.71.a: "Excellent!"

 rusfor.72.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Desires the Return of Their Lands"
 rusfor.72.d: "[From.GetNameDefCap] has requested the transfer of any of their core lands currently held by Russia in exchange for their entry into the Moscow Accord.\n\nWhile accepting their request could strengthen our international position, the steep cost of giving away Russian land has caused opposition within our government to want to reject [From.GetNameDefCap]'s request."
 rusfor.72.a: "It's a worthy price."
 rusfor.72.b: "These are rightful Russian lands!"

 rusfor.73.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Accepts"
 rusfor.73.d: "[Root.GetAdjective] diplomacy has proven successful today, as [From.GetNameDefCap] has agreed to return our core lands in exchange for our entry into the Moscow Accord.\n\n[From.GetNameDefCap] has shown that it is a true friend of [Root.GetName], and we look forward to further cooperation in the years to come."
 rusfor.73.a: "Magnificent!"

 rusfor.74.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Refuses"
 rusfor.74.d: "[From.GetNameDefCap] has shown its true colours as an enemy of [Root.GetName] and has refused to return our rightful land.\n\nThere is no doubt now that diplomacy is impossible with the Russian Bear, and only war will be able to solve our issues."
 rusfor.74.a: "As expected."

 rusfor.75.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Has Refused!"
 rusfor.75.d: "[From.GetNameDefCap] has outrageously refused our request to form an alliance. If they will not come to the discussion table, then war seems like the only solution to this problem.\n\nFor now, we will wait, but mark our words, Russia will return!"
 rusfor.75.a: "Their loss."

 rusfor.76.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Invites Us to Moscow Economic Council"
 rusfor.76.d: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] has invited us to their economic bloc, the Moscow Economic Council.\n\nIt would coordinate the economies of the pact together for the benefit of all its members. Should we sign on?"

 rusfor.76.b: "Meh."

 rusfor.77.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Joins Moscow Economic Council"
 rusfor.77.d: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] has joined our economic bloc.\n\nThis will be a boon to the prosperity of all Russia's allies."
 rusfor.77.a: "Welcome."

 rusfor.78.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Refuses!"
 rusfor.78.d: "For unknown reasons, [FROM.GetNameDefCap] has refused to join our economic bloc, citing their desire for independence from foreign interference."

 rusfor.79.t: "Leaving the [GetMoscowTreatyName]"
 rusfor.79.left_economic_council: "With us having departed from the Moscow Accord, this has been followed by a departure from the [GetMoscowTreatyName], an expected outcome."

 rusfor.79.a: "Oh well."

 rusfor.80.t: "Russia Demands Border Correction"
 rusfor.80.d: "The [ROOT.GetAdjective]-Russian relations have had a slight point of contention for the past years: the magnificent city of Ashgabat, right at the Russian border.\n\nThis largely Russian city in the middle of the Turkmen countryside is the endpoint of the Trans-Caspian railway and ended up under our control in 1929, as Khivan warlord Junaid Khan took over the Transcaspian oblast in the chaotic aftermath of the New Year's Coup in Moscow. De jure part of Russia, the city of Ashgabat (Ashkhabad) and its Russian citizens have been under Iranian protection ever since - and now the Russians are demanding it back, along with anything else we might be 'unjustly' possessing."
 rusfor.80.a: "We are powerless against Russian might..."
 rusfor.80.b: "Nah, I'd win."

 rusfor.81.t: "Persia Accepts"
 rusfor.81.d: "The [PER.GetAdjective]-Russian relations suffered during the past years as the magnificent city of Ashgabat remained a point of contention.\n\nThis largely Russian city in the middle of the Turkmen countryside is the endpoint of the Trans-Caspian railway, and ended up in [PER.GetAdjective] control in 1929 as Khivan warlord Junaid Khan took over the Transcaspian oblast in the chaotic aftermath of the New Year's Coup in Moscow. De jure part of Russia, the city of Ashgabat (Ashkhabad) and its Russian citizens were under Iranian protection ever since - but now we possess this region again."
 rusfor.81.a: "Glorious!"

 rusfor.82.t: "Persia Refuses"
 rusfor.82.d: "The mad [PER.GetAdjective]s are defying us and refusing to return territories that by right belong to us. Do they court war on purpose, or are they simply fools?"
 rusfor.82.a: "We shall crush them!"
 rusfor.82.b: "Back down... for now."

 rusfor.85.t: "Russia Demands Bessarabia"
 rusfor.85.d.ROM: "Yesterday, the Russian government demanded the return of the Bessarabia region. If we agree with Russian claims, we will lose a major part of our territory, but if we refuse, we shall face an immediate Russian invasion.\n\nHow should we react to these awful demands from the Russian leadership?"
 rusfor.85.d.ROM_overlord: "Yesterday, the Russian government demanded the return of the Bessarabia region. If we agree with Russian claims, Romania will lose one-third of its territory, but if we refuse, we shall both face an immediate Russian invasion.\n\nHow should we react to these awful demands from the Russian leadership?"
 rusfor.85.a: "Accept their terms."
 rusfor.85.b: "Never!"

 rusfor.86.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Refuses!"
 rusfor.86.d: "The [From.GetAdjective] government published a note where it insists that Bessarabia is rightfully Romanian territory, and Russia will never get it back.\n\nThe only solution to this problem for us is war with [From.GetNameDef]."
 rusfor.86.d.ally: "The [From.GetAdjective] government has politely refused our request, stating their hard-won conflict against the Romanians and their wish to preserve goodwill between themselves and their subservient government in Bucharest."

 rusfor.86.c: "Cheeky bastards."

 rusfor.87.t: "The Transfer of Bessarabia"

 rusfor.87.d.ally: "[From.GetNameDefCap] has agreed to transfer the larger part of Bessarabia as a sign of goodwill to their valiant allies!"
 rusfor.87.a: "Another victory for Russian diplomacy!"

 rusfor.88.t: "Russia Requests Bessarabia"
 rusfor.88.d: "Yesterday, the Russian government requested the return of the Bessarabia region. As it comes from the leader of our mutual alliance and the former controller of the state in question, the request was an amicable one.\n\nIf we agree with Russian claims, Romania will lose one-third of its territory, but our allies will be grateful for the support."
 rusfor.88.a: "This seems reasonable."
 rusfor.88.b: "It suits the Romanians better."

 rusfor.90.t: "Russia Demands Armenia"
 rusfor.90.d.TUR: "Under the pretence of 'protecting the Christian Armenian people', Russia has issued a series of outrageous demands that would essentially cede control of Armenia up to the city of Kars to Russia. In an attempt to seem diplomatic, they even offered that the Armenians would hold a referendum themselves, with Russians guaranteeing the freedom of such an election.\n\nIt is all just an imperialist charade, but they seem to be serious. The threat of military escalation is imminent."
 rusfor.90.d.TUR_overlord: "Our loyal regime in [TUR.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] has informed us that under the pretence of 'protecting the Christian Armenian people', Russia has issued a series of outrageous demands that would essentially cede control of Armenia up to the city of Kars to Russia. In an attempt to seem diplomatic, they even offered that the Armenians would hold a referendum themselves, with Russians guaranteeing the freedom of such an election.\n\nIt is all just an imperialist charade, but they seem to be serious. The threat of military escalation is imminent."
 rusfor.90.a: "Accept their terms."
 rusfor.90.b: "Never!"

 rusfor.91.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Refuses!"
 rusfor.91.d: "[From.GetName] has refused to accept any of our diplomatic overtures and has declared the entire incident as one of 'Moscow's power-hungry delusions'.\n\nIn a defiant act, they have moved more and more units to our border, clearly willing to fight over the matter."
 rusfor.91.a: "Then it is war."
 rusfor.91.b: "Back down."

 rusfor.92.t: "The Transfer of Armenia"
 rusfor.92.d: "In a desperate attempt to avoid total destruction, the occupiers of Armenia have retreated and have acknowledged our right to protect our Armenian brothers.\n\nA referendum was organised promptly after the arrival of the Russian army, which justified annexation of Armenia with great popular support."
 rusfor.92.a: "Another victory for Russian diplomacy!"

 rusfor.95.t: "Ultimatum for Galicia"
 rusfor.95.d: "The Russians sent us an ultimatum; they want us to cede Galicia to them, or they will declare war on us. How shall we react?"
 rusfor.95.a: "We must accept it."
 rusfor.95.b: "Refuse the offer; let them come!"
 rusfor.95.c: "A preemptive strike is necessary."

 rusfor.99.a: "We will crush them!"

 rusfor.101.t.victory: "Under the Gun"
 rusfor.101.d.victory: "The forces of the resurgent Russian state have begun moving against us in earnest, seeking to rip Bessarabia from us, but much to their surprise, we have not only blunted their advance but actually started to push them back!\n\nPerhaps now would be a good time to send a message asking them to come to the negotiating table. The embarrassment they just received should be enough to at least get them to hear us out."
 rusfor.101.t.defeat: "The Russians Are Beaten!"
 rusfor.101.d.defeat: "The forces of the resurgent Russian state have begun moving against us in earnest, seeking to reconquer Bessarabia; and as valiant as our efforts may be, ultimately it was in vain. Our forces put up a good fight but were pushed aside, and now the country is holding its breath in anticipation of the hardships of a Russian invasion.\n\nThere may be hope, however, if we sue for peace and cede Bessarabia, the Bear's wrath may be abated just enough to save our country."
 rusfor.101.a: "We have no choice; send word to Moscow."
 rusfor.101.b: "We can still win this!"
 rusfor.101.c: "We prevail!"
 rusfor.101.d: "No, they must be taught a lesson."

 rusfor.102.d.victory: "Our campaign to secure the Bessarabian Gubernia has been successful, and the Romanians, dreading further damage to their country, have asked us to begin negotiations in order to end this war.\n\nHow should we respond?"
 rusfor.102.t.defeat: "The Romanians Hold!"
 rusfor.102.d.defeat: "Disaster! Our attempt to march into Bessarabia and reclaim that which is ours has been met with far more resistance than we originally envisioned! Not only have the Romanians held off the brunt of the initial assault, but they have also managed to repel us for quite some time now!\n\nIf this embarrassment continues, our military machine will become the laughingstock of the world! Our foreign ministry recommends we accept their terms, although this may not be seen in the best light by our people..."
 rusfor.102.a: "Accept; no point in wasting any more Russian lives."

 rusfor.103.d.victory: "With their recent humiliation, the Russian government has reluctantly agreed to renounce their claim on Bessarabia in exchange for an immediate cessation of hostilities and Romanian troops' withdrawal to their side of the border. The storm has come, and we have successfully weathered it."
 rusfor.103.d.defeat: "While we have successfully managed to convince the Russians to agree to an immediate cessation of hostilities and withdrawal of troops, the Russians have not budged on the Bessarabia issue; it is to return to Russian control, as it was before 1918.\n\nFortunately, we have managed to preserve the rest of our country from any further humiliation, and one day we may have an opportunity to reunite with our brethren again..."

We must see to our defences..."

 rusfor.104.b: "If it's a fight they want..."

 rusfor.105.t: "Trade Deal with Russia?"
 rusfor.105.d: "The Russian foreign minister has reached out to our government, signalling interest in an economic agreement between our two countries, which would take into account the vital interests of both parties.\n\nIn exchange for our high technology equipment and capital goods, we would gain easier access to Russian oil and other raw materials desperately needed for the war effort. Should we accept?"
 rusfor.105.a: "Sign it!"

 rusfor.107.d: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] has rejected the terms of our proposed trade deal.\n\nTheir selfishness and unwillingness to cooperate will surely come back to bite them in the long run."
 rusfor.107.a: "Whatever."

 rusfor.110.t: "Anti-German Propaganda"
 rusfor.110.d: "Upon war with Russia, all sorts of sabotage and disorder have followed. The result is likely due to Russian propaganda, which has armed saboteurs and fifth columnists everywhere. This time, instead of their propaganda openly embracing the idea of unity between Ukrainians and Russians, it seeks to paint Germany as a vile oppressor for which no truly patriotic Ukrainian can fight.\n\nThe government in [202.GetName], according to this propaganda, is fighting for the aims of imperialist warmongers from Berlin, and not the Ukrainian people. Unfortunately, it has struck a chord with our people, who seem much more unwilling to fight."
 rusfor.110.a: "Drat."

 rusfor.111.t: "The Polish National Committee Prepares Uprising"
 rusfor.111.d: "With the fall of much of the Baltics, White Ruthenia, and Ukraine in a relatively short time period, rumours are abound that Russia has been preparing a decisive blow and coordinating with the national committee to prepare an uprising in the country.\n\nGiven the speed at which the Ostwall has been destroyed, it now seems inevitable that this will be the case."
 rusfor.111.a: "Oh God."
 rusfor.111.a.tt: "With the Ostwall crumbling, the Polish national uprising will now be guaranteed."

 rusfor.112.t: "Waves of Sabotage"
 rusfor.112.d: "Upon war with Russia, we have been hit with a massive wave of sabotage, which the Russian leadership seems to have prepared in advance.\n\nThere is little we can do now but take the hit."
 rusfor.112.a: "Damn!"

 rusfor.113.t: "[FROM.GetAdjective] Government Proposes Trade Agreement"
 rusfor.113.d: "After a brief period of autarky under Savinkov, Russia is now seeking to find new trade partners on a global scale.\n\nChairman-Minister [FROM.GetSecondInCommand]'s trading delegation met with our government representatives in [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] today and showed their proposal for a wide-ranging [ROOT.GetAdjective]-[FROM.GetAdjective] trade agreement, which would seek to remove the barriers of trade between our two countries."

 rusfor.114.a: "Let's drink to that!"

 rusfor.115.t: "[FROM.GetName] Refuses"
 rusfor.115.d: "[FROM.GetNameDef] has refused our generous offer of a trade agreement.\n\nToo bad for them, I suppose."

 rusfor.116.a: "Let's drink to that!"

 rusfor.117.t: "The Mission from Moscow"
 rusfor.117.d: "The Russians have approached us, expressing their wish to further our economic cooperation. They denounced the Vilnius Treaty in 1936 and are now engaged in essentially a trade war with Germany, nationalising German-owned properties. Russia is hardly an inviting investment market at the moment... but they have assured us that all this is only targeted towards Germany, not towards old friends.\n\nWhat the Russians are after is credit from Western banking institutions, and ease of trade without tariffs. Much of their wartime debt was essentially wiped clean as millions of documents were destroyed in the French Revolution, though some of the debt remains. The Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs explained to [ROOT.GetLeader] how Russia is in the midst of a great industrial boom, and its military industry is able to also supply those who seek to work against both German and socialist empires."
 rusfor.117.a: "Alright."
 rusfor.117.b: "This seems very risky."

 rusfor.118.t: "Russo-Canadian Trade and Credit Agreement"
 rusfor.118.d: "The treaty has been ratified that ensures unhindered trade between the Entente powers, and access to foreign credit through Anglo-French banks. Additionally, our representative is allowed to observe meetings of the Imperial Economic Development Council.\n\nIn exchange, we shall sell a predetermined amount of crude oil and minerals necessary for military technology to our allies, and agree to a number of military production contracts. With this agreement, both sides will surely benefit."
 rusfor.118.a: "Cheers."

 rusfor.119.t: "Canada Refuses!"
 rusfor.119.d: "The Entente has refused our generous deal."
 rusfor.119.a: "Shame."

 rusfor.121.t: "The Russian Military Expedition in [ROOT.GetNameDef]"
 rusfor.121.d: "The Russians have long played a role on the sidelines of Chinese power struggles, without throwing their lot behind any faction and chiefly working against any perceived threat, be it Japanese, German, or socialist domination of China.\n\nAfter preliminary negotiations, they have offered to send us a military mission - experienced officers that can whip poorly trained peasant armies into shape."
 rusfor.121.a: "We welcome their assistance."
 rusfor.121.b: "The imperialist dogs can stay away."

 rusfor.125.t: "The Chinese Approach"
 rusfor.125.d: "The relationship between China and Russia has always been one of mixed interests due to both powers asserting hegemony over contested regions in recent history. While one could argue that Sino-Russian relations may have begun with the invasion of the Golden Horde, true relations with the modern Russian nation began when the Qing Dynasty attempted to drive out the Russians from Manchuria, which concluded in the Treaty of Nerchinsk. The Russians, however, never quite forgot this, and when imperial power was reaching its height during the 19th century and with Chinese power on the decline, the Russians were able to consolidate control of the Russian Far East and start to settle Chinese Manchuria.\n\nNow, with Russia's power reasserted following total victory in the Great Patriotic War, the time has come to address the Chinese situation. China, long battered from years of warlordism and civil strife, can become a dangerous enemy should the Chinese modernise and align with our enemies. Our relationship with China is integral for the protection of the Trans-Siberian railway, the Siberian resources, and the port of Vladivostok - ideally through buffer states like Mongolia and East Turkestan. Perhaps a more long-term solution would be seeking a truly cooperative relationship with the Chinese regime, fostering trade and development in East Siberia."
 rusfor.125.a: "We shall seek to secure our interests in Eurasia."
 rusfor.125.b: "Russia and China will march together!"

 rusfor.126.t: "The Sino-Russian Trade Agreement"
 rusfor.126.d: "As the two dominant states of Asia, it is Russia and China which form the economic dynamo of the continent.\n\nThe Russian policy of pursuing friendly cooperation with us has taken the next step with the suggested trade and non-aggression pact."
 rusfor.126.a: "We welcome their assistance."
 rusfor.126.b: "The imperialist dogs can stay away."

 rusfor.127.t: "The Dust Settles in China"
 rusfor.127.d: "After years of bloody conflict, China seems to be finally, if not at peace, in a semblance of stability. [CHN.GetNameDefCap] has emerged victorious, and [CHN.GetLeader]'s government now holds the reins over most of China. For the first time after 1936, China is under a government that actually controls most of the country.\n\nAnd with this, our relationship has changed. Previously, we could opportunistically play the warring states against one another and extend power in Chinese frontier regions without too many consequences. But if China is to be unified, they will become a great player - perhaps not now, but in a decade or two. And it is integral to make a lasting agreement with them now - perhaps with a promise of help in their rebuilding, in exchange for keeping certain Russian interests in their mind."

 rusfor.128.t: "An Offer from Russia."
 rusfor.128.desc: "[RUS.GetNameDef] has approached us, citing the need to negotiate certain points of conflict between us now that China has a stable government again. In fact, the negotiation was seen as important enough for [RUS.GetLeader] and his Minister of Foreign Affairs to actually meet [ROOT.GetLeader] and our government in Vladivostok. In these Vladivostok negotiations, the Russian government promised to support us in rebuilding efforts with generous loans and technical expertise, and seeks a proper treaty to ensure our continuing cooperation.\n\nBut a more thorny issue is that of our border regions: Mongolia and Xinjiang. For Russia, Mongolia in particular is of strategic importance because of its proximity to the Trans-Siberian Railway, and it is likely they would seek at least the neutrality of Mongolia. For Xinjiang, there is less conflict, but it is possible that the Russians will try to leverage us for it."
 rusfor.128.a: "Agree, with the current borders."
 rusfor.128.b: "Agree, if they withdraw from Mongolia."

 rusfor.129.desc1: "Not feeling confident to make territorial demands, the Chinese government has more or less accepted our terms.\n\nThe matters of Mongolia and Xinjiang are not to be made into problems, and a Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation is to be signed between [RUS_leader] [RUS.GetLeader] and [FROM.GetLeader], ensuring lasting prosperity between our two nations."
 rusfor.129.desc2: "The Chinese made Mongolia into the most important question, threatening to refuse an otherwise desirable agreement if we do not withdraw from Mongolia.\n\nEverything else they consider satisfactory, from the trade agreement to non-aggression pact - just not the Russian presence in Mongolia."
 rusfor.129.desc3: "The Chinese made Xinjiang into the most important question, threatening to refuse an otherwise desirable agreement if we do not withdraw from Xinjiang.\n\nEverything else they consider satisfactory, from the trade agreement to non-aggression pact - just not the Russian presence in Xinjiang."
 rusfor.129.desc4: "The Chinese made Xinjiang and Mongolia into the most important question, threatening to refuse an otherwise desirable agreement if we do not withdraw from Xinjiang and Mongolia.\n\nEverything else they consider satisfactory, from the trade agreement to non-aggression pact - just not the Russian presence in Xinjiang and Mongolia."
 rusfor.129.desc5: "The negotiations collapsed rather soon. The Chinese delegation was not willing to budge on anything meaningful.\n\nThey claimed that any economic treaty with a European imperial power would be essentially a return to concessions, and that they cannot give the Russians any benefit of the doubt. Neither are borders and Chinese foreign influence in any way negotiable. Thus, no agreement was reached."
 rusfor.129.a: "Sublime."

It is clear that the Russians are in no position to recapture these vast swathes of Siberia any time soon, which means that we are in a superior negotiating position.\n\nWith our triumph, we can demand the Russians withdraw from the Far East, leaving China and the shores of the Pacific Ocean to us.

 rusfor.13100.t: "Time for a Truce?" #MON offers peace
 rusfor.13100.d: "Perhaps most fruitfully, or rather scornfully depending on one's temperament concerning the war situation in the Far East, it would appear that the Russians have been rightfully and resolutely routed from Siberia, and more importantly, the Trans-Siberian. With our forces having secured the return of not only Tuva, but other Mongol lands that lay under the yoke of Russian domination for centuries, such as that of Buryatia, many within the high command have begun to call on [ROOT.GetLeader] to seek a truce, and peaceful resolution in light of our superior negotiating position.\n\nConsidering that the Russians are clearly in no position to recapture the vast swathes of Siberia under our control, and with fear that Mongolia's luck may very well run out, when the Russian Bear reorients itself, the offer is a most beneficial and serious one to consider. However, there remains the opportunity to completely subjugate the Russians, for Mongolia shall never truly rest with its neighbour constantly looming large."

 rusfor.152.a: "Then it's war!"
 rusfor.152.b: "Perhaps we were a little hasty..."

 rusfor.153.t: "Russian Military Restrictions"
 rusfor.153.d: "Recently, the Russians carefully brought up the question of military restrictions defined in the Treaty of Moscow, chiefly limiting the size and equipment of their military.\n\n[RUS.GetLeader] asked if we could waive some of these restrictions as a token of goodwill - after all, Germany stands supreme without any real opposition. They explain that these restrictions in particular are despised in Russia, and carry no other meaning than a national humiliation."
 rusfor.153.a: "I suppose they pose no threat anymore..."
 rusfor.153.b: "Absolutely not!"

 rusfor.154.t: "Germany Lifts Restrictions"
 rusfor.154.d: "The German Foreign Office agreed to negotiate relaxations in some articles of the Treaty of Moscow. Namely, it waived many military restrictions that were not deemed to be relevant in post-war Europe.\n\nThis is a great victory for our attempts to restore Russian confidence on the world stage."
 rusfor.154.a: "Excellent!"

 rusfor.155.t: "Germany Refuses"
 rusfor.155.d: "Germany has refused to lift the army restrictions.\n\nThis is not terribly surprising, but disappointing nonetheless."
 rusfor.155.a: "So much for being 'allies'..."

 rusfor.202.t: "Joining the Anti-Internationale Pact?"
 rusfor.202.d: "Ever since the collapse of Germany's sphere of influence in Europe, Russia has been eager to exploit its position as the leading anti-communist power in Europe. Today, they announced measures to contain the socialists and prevent their expansion, inviting all 'threatened nations' to a common alliance. As one of the few remaining nations in Europe not part of any alliance, we have naturally been invited to join the pact.\n\nWhile protection against the Syndicalist nations sounds helpful, many are worried that this 'alliance' has more strings attached than it might seem. Furthermore, we have no clear sign that the Internationale has any plans to attack us. We must decide if this is worth signing up to."
 rusfor.202.a: "Perfect!"
 rusfor.202.b: "Let us join the [RUS.GetFactionName] as well!"
 rusfor.202.c: "We won't limit our sovereignty."

 rusfor.203.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] joins the Anti-Internationale Pact"

 rusfor.203.a: "Wonderful!"
 rusfor.203.b: "Not good."

 rusfor.204.t: "Attending the Conference at Tilsit?"
 rusfor.204.d: "Seeking a diplomatic resolution to the new tension brewing after the division of Europe, [RUS.GetNameDef] has invited our government to send representatives to resolve these issues. The conference, codenamed 'Eureka' is held in Tilsit, small town in East Prussia. The historical significance of this name does not escape us, as it was the place where Emperors Napoleon and Aleksandr I met over a century ago to discuss relations of their two great empires.\n\nThe negotiations will largely be with regard to the remaining neutral countries of Europe, and hopefully lay the groundwork for a lasting peace after the defeat of Germany. While the prospect of a permanent peace on the European continent is attractive, one must not forget that the Russians were simply an ally of convenience - and will become our natural enemy regardless. Whether we believe we can topple their sphere of influence and bring about the socialist revolution to all of Europe is a whole different question here, but one that must be considered."
 rusfor.204.a: "We will accept the invitation."
 rusfor.204.b: "There's no use in playing the imperialists' games."

 rusfor.205.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Dismisses the Conference!"
 rusfor.205.d: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] has dismissed our offer, citing that Moscow is not to be trusted and is simply the hegemon of a new imperialist bloc."
 rusfor.205.a: "We tried."

 rusfor.206.t: "[From.GetName] Welcomes the Tilsit Conference!"
 rusfor.206.d: "Stating their shared desire for peace, [FROM.GetNameDef] has sent diplomatic representatives to negotiate."
 rusfor.206.a: "Let us get started."

 rusfor.207.t: "Our Demands in Tilsit"
 rusfor.207.desc: "With Europe being divided between the victors of the Second Great War, measures should be taken to ensure that a third war will not break out.\n\nThere are plenty of things that we could demand from the other side, with varying degrees of how they may perceive it. Either we could keep it safe and pursue minimalist demands - or, alternatively, chart a path that will give an edge in the conference."
 rusfor.207.a: "Demand mutual guarantees to the remaining neutral countries in Europe."
 rusfor.207.b: "Demand a white peace with the Entente."
 rusfor.207.c: "Demand mutual army limits."

 rusfor.207.b.tt: "The §rInternationale's§! §Hresponse§! will depend on multiple factors: \n£white_dot The size of our army compared to theirs.\n£white_dot Whether America is not socialist, and / or is in the §CEntente§!.\n£white_dot If the leader of the §rInternationale§! borders a country in the §G[RUS.GetFactionName]§!.\n£white_dot If we have a §gGerman puppet state§! that owns at least part of the Rhineland."

 rusfor.208.t: "[From.GetName] Demands Guarantees to Neutral Countries"
 rusfor.208.d: "While much of Europe is officially in a military alliance, the [INT.GetFactionName] or the [RUS.GetFactionName], there still remain those untouched by the scars of the Second Great War. Naturally, the continent being so starkly divided has given them much anxiety, as well as the rival alliances.\n\nAny major military incursions into the neutral countries from either side would almost surely be the spark for a third war. Thus, [FROM.GetNameDefCap] has proposed that we mutually guarantee their independence, which would make both sides think twice about such actions."
 rusfor.208.a: "An acceptable compromise."
 rusfor.208.b: "No way!"

 rusfor.209.d1: "[FROM.GetNameDef] has agreed to our demand to guarantee neutral countries in Europe.\n\nHopefully, this will deter aggression from both sides."
 rusfor.209.d2: "Surprisingly, [FROM.GetNameDef] has agreed to our demand to cease hostilities against the Entente.\n\nThis should leverage the conference in our favour."
 rusfor.209.d3: "[FROM.GetNameDef] has agreed to our demand for mutual army limits.\n\nHopefully, this will deter aggression from both sides."

 rusfor.210.d: "[FROM.GetNameDef] has refused our latest demand, and subsequently withdrew their representatives from the conferences in protest of our actions.\n\nThe Tilsit Accords has ended in failure."
 rusfor.210.a: "Bye then!"

 rusfor.211.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Demands Peace with the Entente"
 rusfor.211.d: "In a rather bold demand, the Russian representative stated that, to preserve peace on the continent, we must cease all hostilities with the remaining Entente members still in the fight. To put it simply, this is a hard demand to swallow, and one many see as unacceptable.\n\nHow we are to take this demand solely depends on our current war against the Entente, and if the rest of their alliance actually poses any threat to us in the future. The Russians are surely leveraging their current influence over Europe to shift the balance of power in their favour, and it is clear that this is a demand backed by force. We must weigh our options carefully."
 rusfor.211.a: "This is acceptable."
 rusfor.211.b: "Completely outrageous!"

 rusfor.212.t: "[From.GetName] Demands Mutual Army Limits"
 rusfor.212.d: "The lead-up to the First and Second Great Wars saw an arms race between the great powers that eventually ended up, at least in part, being the cause for the two bloodiest wars in history.\n\n[FROM.GetNameDef] has thus proposed that both [FRA.GetFactionName] and [RUS.GetFactionName] adhere to limits on the sizes of their armies - the logic is that neither side will risk starting a war, unconfident that they will be able to overpower the other, and the gradual reduction of the number of weapons can lay the groundwork for a world without war in Europe."
 rusfor.212.a: "This is acceptable."
 rusfor.212.b: "That would limit our sovereignty."

 rusfor.213.t: "[From.GetName] Demands Embargo of the Entente"
 rusfor.213.d: "Representatives of [FROM.GetNameDefCap] have stated that, to preserve peace between Paris and Moscow, one crucial issue must be taken care of: Russian support for the Entente powers. According to the French delegates, ever since the end of the war, Russia has been covertly supporting the Entente's fight against the [INT.GetFactionName] with weapons and other means, despite official recognition of the Internationale regimes. Thus, they have demanded that any and all support to the Entente cease, and that the Russian bloc also forbid trade with the Entente.\n\nThis is difficult for us, as the Entente's war was one way we were able to undermine the socialist powers without directly declaring war on them. However, it is also possible that the [INT.GetFactionName] sees us as potential co-belligerents in their war, and that they could be planning to attack us if they feel too threatened. In the long term, however, the Entente alliance will likely disintegrate, so there may not be significant benefit to aiding them as we are now."
 rusfor.213.a: "This is acceptable."
 rusfor.213.b: "We shall do business with whomever we want!"

 rusfor.214.t: "Tilsit Accords Succeeds!"
 rusfor.214.d: "The Tilsit Accords has succeeded, and both sides are coming home to speak of the diplomatic victory.\n\nWhile a permanent peace in Europe is by no means guaranteed, this success should lay the groundwork for it - and perhaps even more - in the future."
 rusfor.214.a: "Great!"
 tilsit_peace_success: "Tilsit Peace Accord"

 rusfor.215.t: "The Vladivostok Conference"
 rusfor.215.d: "Despite previously cold relations, a number of diplomats and officers from both [RUS.GetNameDef] and [JAP.GetNameDef] have arrived in the far eastern city of Vladivostok to discuss the future of Russo-Japanese relations.\n\nThe purpose is simple — to heal old wounds and to negotiate a defensive alliance against the rapidly growing communist threat."
 rusfor.215.a: "Let us hope for an agreement!"

 rusfor.250.t: "[RUS.GetName] Invites us to Their Alliance"
 rusfor.250.d: "The Russian foreign ministry recently has communicated that they want us to join their military alliance. According to them, we are much more compatible ideologically with Russia than the current leader of the Internationale military alliance.\n\nThis offer is quite enticing, but [INT.GetNameDef] may respond harshly if we choose to sign up. What should we do?"
 rusfor.250.a: "Accept their offer."
 rusfor.250.b: "We will stick with [INT.GetNameDef]."

 rusfor.251.t: "[FROM.GetName] Joins Us"

 rusfor.252.a: "Their loss."

 rusfor.253.t: "[FROM.GetName] Leaves the Alliance!"
 rusfor.253.d: "Horrible news. Behind our backs, the Russians have negotiated a deal with [FROM.GetNameDef], stealing us out of our military alliance.\n\nIt is obvious that they are provoking us not out of good for socialism but due to their own selfishness."
 rusfor.253.a: "Issue a diplomatic protest and sanction this aggression."
 rusfor.253.b: "This means war!"

 rusfor.254.t: "Russia Defeats Mongolia"
 rusfor.254.d: "Unfortunately, our Mongolian ally could not withstand the might of the Russian army, and they are now in occupation of the country.\n\nWe should probably send a peace envoy to prevent any further bloodshed."

The final blow has finally been dealt as [48.GetName]'s government has announced their desire for peace.\n\nWith our armed forces withdrawing, happily celebrating their victory and the border regions slowly being redrawn, Serbia, Romania, and Greece have come forth with further requests for equipment to replenish their forces and economic relief to stabilise the situation."

The threat that the Syndicalists once made [RUS.GetLeader] quiver and shake over the future implications for the New World can finally be put to rest as [361.owner.GetNameDef] is consolidating their triumph.\n\nGreat thanks are being given for our heavy involvement, with several beneficial trade negotiations slowly being implemented favouring our side to get the American economy chugging along once more."
 rusfor.258.a: "Let it be known that Syndicalists will be purged from the New World!"

 rusfor.259.t: "[SPR.GetNameDefCap] Victory"
 rusfor.259.d: "As the last few remnants of Spanish resistance in the cities and countryside starts to subside and [SPR.GetNameDef] start to pick up the pieces, the conflict has finally drawn to an end.\n\nTruly, there could have been no better conclusion than to see Spain join our old allies in the Entente rather than join the hated Germans or the Reds just across their border."
 rusfor.259.a: "Send the Entente and [SPR.GetLeader] our congratulations."

 rusfor.260.t: "[ETS.GetNameDefCap] Victory"
 rusfor.260.d: "As [QIE.GetNameDef]'s power started to unravel in the wake of Black Monday, various warlord states started to experience both internal and external struggles. The province of Xinjiang was no different, and unlike the other warlord states, there came an opportunity to expand our holdings in Central Asia with the victory over the Turkestan rebellion.\n\nNow, vast sums of financial and military assets are being sent to the region to stabilise and prepare [ETS.GetNameDef] to join the Russian world."
 rusfor.260.a: "Another addition to our Central Asian pawn collection."

 rusfor.261.t: "Mongolian Victory"
 rusfor.261.d: "Chaos. It's the only word that company commanders of the dispatched volunteer force can use to describe the present situation in the southern part of [MON.GetNameDef] where conflict had recently concluded against [XSM.GetNameDef].\n\nWhile the initial aim of expanding Russian influence and control in Mongolia has met a conclusive and victorious outcome, the utter horror transmitted by our forces on the ground has complicated matters in relation to stabilising the post-war situation with events unfolding concurrently in places such as [348.GetName], [616.GetName] and [621.GetName]."
 rusfor.261.a: "Our power grows regardless!"

 rusfor.262.t: "[608.owner.GetNameDefCap] Success"
 rusfor.262.d: "A grand celebration took place today in the Middle Kingdom as [608.owner.GetNameDef] proclaimed the unification of China after not only vanquishing the Japanese but all other warlord contenders.\n\nWhile there is much yet to be resolved on the periphery, for now there is a moment of respite with special praise being paid for our military backing and modernisation efforts."
 rusfor.262.a: "A great achievement."

 rusfor.263.t: "Aid from Russia?"
 rusfor.263.d: "The [RUS.GetNameDefCap] has offered to grant us industrial and military aid, likely so that we may take down the Ottoman Empire."
 rusfor.263.a: "Of course!"
 rusfor.263.b: "We don't need it."

 rusfor.1300.t: "Offer Peace to Russia?"
 rusfor.1300.d: "As our soldiers continue to mount gains in the gruelling war against the Russian bear, calls for peace have only become louder. The Russian invaders are quickly losing ground and have already lost many of their major cities and industrial centres, making a counterattack unlikely. Reports of desertions and even mutinies on the side of our enemy have seemingly become more and more commonplace, and many predict that a full collapse of the Russian army - if it has not already happened - is inevitable.\n\nWhile the leadership in Moscow had previously vowed that they would not seek any conditional surrender with Germany, this now seems to be in doubt. It is now up to us: do we seek terms with Russia? Through a negotiated peace, we will be able to thoroughly dismantle Russian power by breaking off the territories our allies claim, subjecting them to humiliating economic treaties, and greatly limiting the size of their army. Many claim that it will not be enough, but an outright occupation of Russia is not desirable either. It seems that peace will be the best way to secure Germany's hegemony on the continent and completely neuter Russian aggression for decades to come.\n\nIf we choose to fight on until the total destruction of Russia, we can only expect them to fight like devils, fully united in defence of their Motherland."
 rusfor.1300.a: "Of course. Let's end this."
 rusfor.1300.b: "We will seek nothing but unconditional surrender."

 rusfor.1301.t: "Germany Offers Peace"
 rusfor.1301.d: "Through the careful mediation of neutral countries, German diplomats have offered us peace on their terms.\n\nThis would include humiliating terms such as giving away territory to their client states in the east, paying a huge amount of reparations, and greatly reducing the size of our army. What do we say?"
 rusfor.1301.a: "We can only accept. There is no choice."
 rusfor.1301.b: "We fight on!"

 rusfor.1302.t: "The Treaty of Moscow"
 rusfor.1302.d: "After a short period of deliberation, both sides met in German-occupied Moscow to negotiate an end to the war on the eastern front. For the Russian diplomats, the location of the negotiations has most definitely struck a nerve; some hundred years ago, Napoleon's capture of Moscow led him to believe that he had won. His subsequent failures have since enshrined a national myth for the Russians, one that has convinced them that no enemy will come to occupy the Russian heartland. Today, that myth has been thoroughly shattered.\n\nThe Russians have sent their Foreign Minister and a number of diplomats to negotiate the peace. Some on the German side have noted the sombreness of the situation: for the second time in history, Russia has been defeated by German arms and has had its great power status undoubtedly revoked, once a source of pride for the largest country on the continent. One could only wonder how it would have been were it the other way around. Allied representatives, in particular from Belarus and Ukraine, have been far less conciliatory, demanding that Russia be thoroughly punished for its aggressive war.\n\nIn the end, the Russian negotiators were forced to make a broad number of concessions, including the loss of territory to Germany's eastern allies, a huge indemnity to be paid to the victors, the demobilisation of its military, and more. As a small compromise with the Russian leadership, the question of Russian membership in Mitteleuropa was left open for the future.\n\nStill, even after the room was left empty and the soldiers began to lay down their arms, an uneasy question remained. We stopped short of occupying Russia and forming our own government, and though it is certain that the defeat in the war will lead to new men occupying the Kremlin, what is next? We can only hope that the future of Russo-German relations can be a bright one. Until that is shown to be the case, though, one can only remain sceptical."

 rusfor.1303.t: "Peace in the East?"
 rusfor.1303.d: "The German ambassador in our country has informed us that, with the tides fully turning against Russia's favour, they plan to force Russia's conditional surrender. Russia will cede any claims we have on their territory, should we have any, and they will be forced to demobilise and pay Germany enormous war reparations.\n\nThe idea of peace is alluring after such a long war, but perhaps we should be sceptical and advise them to further punish Russia."
 rusfor.1303.a: "Yes, let's end this."
 rusfor.1303.b: "No, we fight on!"

 rusfor.1304.t: "The War in Eastern Europe Continues"
 rusfor.1304.d.reichspakt: "Due to the veto of [FROM.GetName] on a conditional surrender from Russia's part, we will not be having peace with Russia - at least, not until they completely and unconditionally surrender, that is."
 rusfor.1304.d.russia: "While Germany showed an initial willingness to a negotiated peace, it seems that they have since backed down from the idea due to strenuous objections from their [FROM.GetAdjective] allies.\n\nWe will not have peace, it seems, until one of the sides is utterly destroyed."

 rusfor.1309.t: "The Russians Invite us to the Moscow Accord"
 rusfor.1309.d: "With the Russian victory in the Second World War and the changing nature of the world, we have been approached by Moscow to solidify relations between our two great nations, especially due to our shared ideological conviction that the future should be decided by the rising world of Eurasia rather than the West."

 rusfor.1312.t: "Northeast Anti-Japanese Allied Forces Teaching Brigade"
 rusfor.1312.d: "With the recent gains made by Russian forces, efforts from [RUS.GetNameDef] have begun to reorganise the broken remnants of anti-Japanese guerrilla movements that have existed in Manchuria since the ongoing conflicts in China. Under the direction of the pro-Russian Korean nationalist Lee Yong, volunteers numbering about 1,500 people, largely of Korean and Chinese descent, have pledged loyalty and service to the Russian forces and are thus reorganised fully into the Northeast Anti-Japanese Allied Forces Teaching Brigade.\n\nLed by Captain Kim Song-ju, a Korean socialist revolutionary who has been active in Manchuria and Northern Korea, the brigade is not just made up of Chinese and Koreans but also Central Asian volunteers. In addition to intelligence and sabotage training, the brigade has also undergone intensive ideological training to commit the volunteers to the greater ideological struggle against Japanese imperialism and capitalism. With the division formed and the Russian army poised to enter and liberate Korea, it will only be a matter of time before a sister socialist republic in Korea will be formed under the guidance of the Red Army."
 rusfor.1312.a: "Salute to our Korean Comrades!"

 rusfor.1313.t: "Korean National Populism"
 rusfor.1313.d: "Since its liberation, the region of the Korean peninsula - long subjugated under Japanese rule - has been placed under the Russian sphere of influence. During their long, turbulent fight for independence, Russia became a safe haven for many Korean nationalists, especially thanks to the already existing Korean communities in the Far East and Siberia.\n\nIt's no surprise to the Foreign Ministry that we have received word that the movement of Ilminism is growing in popularity throughout Korea. Ilminism traces its origins from Korean exiles in Russia who found themselves drawn to the National Populism espoused by the SZRS as well as elements of the Romanian Iron Guard. The Russian-educated Korean Minister of Education Ahn Ho-Sang has primarily developed the concept of Ilminism to cultivate the idea of a homogenous Korean culture. They have centred their belief on total support and obedience for the Korean leader Lee Beom-seok and base their ideology on a four-point programme that sees the elimination of class distinctions, economic equalisation, social and political equality of the sexes, and an end to democracy. Highly nationalistic, it is pleasing to the Vozhd and his leadership that the concepts and ideas of National Populism are indeed, universal even in the Far East."
 rusfor.1313.a: "We applaud their initiative!"

 rusfor.1400.t: "The Russians Come Knocking"
 rusfor.1400.d: "Our worst fears have come true. The Russians are mobilising on the Ukrainian border and the borders of Germany's eastern allies. It seems that a war will be inevitable, despite our best attempts to avert it. Now, our alliance with [202.GetName] may have just become a liability.\n\nPerhaps it would be best to leave this to the Germans, and not burden ourselves with getting involved in a war we may be ill-prepared for?"
 rusfor.1400.a: "Leave it to Berlin. We can't commit to a war for now."
 rusfor.1400.b: "We can't abandon our Ukrainian allies!"

 rusfor.1401.t: "Austria Ends the Military Alliance"
 rusfor.1401.d: "The Austrian ambassador to Ukraine has informed us that, with war potentially looming on the horizon and Ukraine under threat, Austria is ill-prepared to handle a war with Russia.\n\nThey have conducted negotiations with Berlin and stated that they will become responsible for our defence."
 rusfor.1401.a: "Some ally they are..."

 rusfor.1402.t: "Ukraine Rejoins the Reichspakt"
 rusfor.1402.d: "In backroom negotiations, Vienna has informed us that, with war with Russia on the horizon, they are ill-equipped to properly defend Ukraine. While our ambassador to Vienna has attempted to convince them to commit to the war, they were unsuccessful.\n\nWe have now once again become responsible for Ukraine's defence."
 rusfor.1402.a: "Cowardice - but we do not need help, after all."

 rusfor.1403.t: "Aid in the Central Asian War"
 rusfor.1403.d: "The decision of our government to send aid and volunteers to the fledgling Central Asian states is no doubt going to have consequences. It has unmistakably heightened tensions between us and [RUS.GetName], who are already depicting the intervention in Central Asia as a fight against the German sphere.\n\nSuch rhetoric may give the Russians an opportunity to drag out the war longer than they would otherwise."
 rusfor.1403.a: "No matter."

### Flavour ###
 rusfla.1.t: "Slashchyov Publishes His 'Unfought War'"
 rusfla.1.d: "With great fanfare, General Yakov Slashchyov has published the hotly-anticipated sequel to his earlier magnum opus 'Manoeuvre: The Key to Victory'. Titled 'The Unfought War', Slashchyov's new book builds on his earlier theories of armoured warfare, emphasising that the rapid changes in tank technology have already rendered most existing countermeasures to massed tanks obsolete.\n\nA prolific writer and professor at the Rifle Officer School in Petrograd, Slashchyov has made waves both for his writing and persona. Dashing, irreverent, and hopelessly addicted to cocaine, Slashchyov has become one of the most important, if controversial, members of what's come to be called the 'Markov School', an informal clique of reformist officers centred around the eponymous general. A firebrand proponent of mass mechanisation, Slashchyov grounds much of his prose on a lampooning of the tactics of his peers, a literary choice that has drawn no small amount of controversy. The book has, nevertheless, already become a best-seller, and it remains to be seen where Slashchyov's sights will be set next."
 rusfla.1.a: "Interesting."

 rusfla.2.t: "Reynard the Fox"
 rusfla.2.d: "After suffering through nearly six years of setbacks and delays due to audio issues, Vladislav Starevich's stop-motion take on the classic tales of Reynard the Fox has released to rave reviews and box-office records. The story follows the adventures of the eponymous fox, Reynard, as he uses his cunning to trick and make fools of a whole menagerie of other animals sent by the King to put a stop to his antics. Critics and audiences alike have praised the quality of its animation and dialogue, no doubt a relief for Starevich after the project spent more than half a decade in development.\n\nNevertheless, given Reynard's relevance to his native France, Starevich has come under fire from certain corners for alleged sympathies to the Communards. Starevich himself has shot back, mocking the assertion that fairytales from hundreds of years ago must have relevance to modern France, while emphasising his opposition to the Bolsheviks in Russia's own civil war. Regardless, Reynard the Fox has propelled Starevich's prominence even higher, no mean feat given the popularity of his earlier works stretching back decades, and which earned him commendations from the Tsar himself."
 rusfla.2.a: "Interesting."

 rusfla.3.t: "Aleksandr Nevsky"
 rusfla.3.d: "Russian audiences were treated to a historic milestone with the long-awaited release of director Vsevolod Pudovkin's epic Aleksandr Nevsky. Widely rumoured to be the most expensive film produced on Russian soil, Aleksandr Nevsky's scale could only be possible with the direct blessing (and generous funding) of the Russian government. The film follows the eponymous 13th century Prince of Novgorod (played by Nikolay Cherkasov) as he strives to repel an invasion by the Teutonic Order. With the city of Pskov having already fallen to the Teutonic Knights thanks to the betrayal of local collaborators, Prince Aleksandr rushes to rally the fractious 'Russian' people against their common foe. The peasantry, Orthodox Church, and even elements of the Golden Horde gather under Prince Aleksandr's banner, helping him first defeat the pro-Teutonic party of boyars and merchants in Novgorod, before then delivering a crushing defeat on the Knights themselves at the epic 'Battle on the Ice' of Lake Peipus.\n\nTo say that the film is unsubtle in its allegories is perhaps putting it too lightly. Nevertheless, the image of stahlhelmed Teutonic Knights being driven from Russian lands has electrified domestic audiences. This is not to say the film lacks artistic merits. Sergey Prokofiev's stirring score has received widespread acclaim, as has Pudovkin's own distinctive cinematographic style. Though the sweeping shots of the Battle on the Ice are most often plastered on posters, much of the film is an introspective character study of Aleksandr Nevsky himself, whose private hopes, doubts, and frequent soliloquies drive much of the plot."
 rusfla.3.a: "Nevsky was a hero."

 rusfla.4.t: "Filmisation of The Pale Horse"
 rusfla.4.d: "It is a well-known fact that the Vozhd was not merely a terrorist and a revolutionary in his youth, but also a writer, seeking to portray the moral conflict and strength of character needed to persist in the struggle. These memories from his youth have never faded away and forged the core of what Boris Savinkov envisioned the new Russian ideal to be like - therefore, to bestow the new generation with this knowledge, he has ordered one of his most famous novels, 'The Pale Horse', to be adapted to full motion picture.\n\nThe story is a literary retelling of the assassination of Grand Prince Sergey Aleksandrovich, which Savinkov helped orchestrate, and follows the members of a unit in the SR Combat Organisation. Some are amoral and cynical, long past the point of no return yet deadly efficient at their duty, such as the leader of the cell, George, and some are God-fearing and struggle with the morality of murder, such as the rather mystical Vanya. They fight, struggle, ponder about their cause and the morality of it, and ultimately step over the line of 'noble', from revolutionary murder to personal murder.\n\nDetractors claim that the movie, much like the book, is a chore and spends too much time immersed in philosophy - teaching the viewer about how the only true purpose one can strive for is furthering the cause, and how one must master their emotions to become a Nietzschean figure. However, as expected, thousands of Russians stormed movie theatres to witness the word of the Vozhd in film form."
 rusfla.4.a: "It is an inspiring story."

 rusfla.5.t: "The Church of the Third Testament"
 rusfla.5.d: "Perhaps the strangest new religious trend of Russia is that of the Church of the Holy Spirit. It was founded by the 'tribrotherhood' of the famous poet, novelist and thinker Dmitry Merezhkovsky, his wife Zinaida Gippius, and their friend Dmitry Filosofov. The trio travels around Russia, drawing great flocks of listeners who wish to hear Merezhkovsky's great oratory. They preach for the spiritual renewal of Christianity, one unshackled by the conservatism of the Orthodox Church. They stress the personal, mystical oneness with the Holy Spirit herself, who will bring upon the Third Testament that will give the final spiritual truth to the people.\n\nMerezhkovsky's church enjoys generous support from the SZRS, and 'The Prophet of New Russia' himself is one of the Vozhd's closest confidants and mentors. One can see Merezhkovsky's cultural footprint in many places - in Neo-Symbolic poetry and prose encouraged by the state, in apocalyptic propaganda about Russia's great fate, in the church's belief that Russian intelligentsia - personified in Savinkov - compose the 'living spirit of Russia' which will oppose the reign of the 'men-beasts' of socialism, seeking to destroy civilisation in the entire world.\n\nStill, he is a divisive figure even among supporters of Savinkov's regime. To his followers he is a modern apostle and the greatest Russian artist of the 20th century; to his enemies he is a heretic and a cult leader in the service of an oppressive regime. Many rumours are especially focused on claimed esoteric-erotic rituals happening in the masses of the inner circle of the movement.\n\nRegardless, the Church of the Holy Spirit is the fastest growing new religious movement in Russia, having established churches in all major cities of the country. While successes among the peasantry have been meagre, Merezhkovsky has attracted much of the intelligentsia and middle class into his movement, which is often praised as modernist, the Symbolist Christianity of the future, free from the monarchical and Medieval baggage of the Orthodox Church proper."

 rusfla.6.t: "The Conducător's Visit"
 rusfla.6.d: "Today, the President received the Prime Minister of Romania, Corneliu Codreanu, who has dedicated multiple days to travel across the Russian countryside and see the achievements of the Svobodniks. His own party rose into power shortly before Savinkov's ascension in 1934 but quickly recognised the new Russian government as a like-minded one. Despite the earlier anti-Russian rhetoric and suspicion towards Savinkov's character, relations have been warming.\n\nThe purpose of the visit has not been announced, but it seems clear that the two leaders are interested in deepening their ties in the 'shared struggle' against the 'dual evils of Germanic imperialism and International socialism'. Codreanu and Savinkov took part in a service in the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour near the Kremlin and later observed a parade by the 1st Guards Tank Division, bolstered by a contingent of the 12th Svobodnik Death Battalion.\n\nAfter spending the initial days in Moscow, Prime Minister Codreanu plans to tour the Ryazan countryside to see how SZRS has managed to transform the lives of Russian peasants for the better. As a visiting speaker invited by the local chapter of the SZRS, Codreanu drew great crowds of interested listeners. Much of the speech focused on the struggle against the Jews and on the spiritual renewal of Orthodox civilisation. Later on, local newspapers characterised the Conducător's speech as inspirational and magnetic, young and dynamic as opposed to Savinkov's calmer and sombre style. Later on, Codreanu was granted civilian honours to acknowledge his role as a Russian ally and a brother."

 rusfla.7.t: "The Russian Army"
 rusfla.7.d: "Since the humiliating defeat in the Chinese Eastern Railway conflict in 1928 and the subsequent chaos of the Boldyrev Putsch in 1929, winds of change blew through the Russian Army, previously calcified after the victory of the Whites in the Civil War. Commander-in-Chief Lavr Kornilov seized the initiative, launching an ambitious programme of professionalisation, modernisation, and rearmament influenced by the writings of reformist officers such as Nikolay Golovin and the young colonel Yevgeny Messner.\n\nIncompetent or politically involved officers were relieved, new equipment standards and development programmes for tanks and aircraft established, a uniform modern tactical doctrine written by General-Lieutenant Arseny Zaitsov implemented, and wide overhauls made to military education with an eye towards opening the officer corps to the lower classes, as well as former Reds.\n\nIn 1936, the Russian Army stands as a force superior to any it borders, and yet that is not enough. Triumph over Germany in the coming war will require far more, and the timetable is short. However, the path forward is contested.\n\nOn one end, somewhat disfavoured by Kornilov, lies Nikolay Golovin, a prominent reformist since even before the Great War, and his 'Neo-Suvorovian' clique, such as Vasily Pronin and Sergey Nilov, who continue to advocate for ambitious reforms to the Russian command structure, comprehensive military scientific education, and a shift to a German-inspired mission-based decentralised command, all with the goal of matching or even beating German tactical performance.\n\nOn the other end is a new faction of officers colloquially known as the Black Epaulettes, headed by Civil War legend Sergey Markov and the theorists Yakov Slashchyov and Yevgeny Messner, who argue for a continuation of the bold, shock-based offensive tactics of the Civil War with a new focus on mechanisation."
 rusfla.7.a: "Tak tochno!"

 rusfla.8.t: "The Russian Military Air Fleet"
 rusfla.8.d: "Unlike the other branches of the military, the Voeyenno-Vozdushny Flot Rossii (Military Air Fleet of Russia) has seen the most extensive changes since the Great War, though with only minimal success. Originally under the auspices and control of the army and navy with their separate air fleets, the VVFR would only be separated and conceived as its own military branch in 1929 after the efforts of both pilot aces Aleksandr Aleksandrovich Kazakov and Vyacheslav Matveyevich Tkachyov, with the former becoming the first Chief of the Air Force of Russia.\n\nWith the new branch of the military established, new sources of limited funding for more promising domestic designs from companies such as Sikorsky, Gamayun, and Duks emerged, along with the expansion of aviation schools and clubs. While individuals such as Aleksandr Lapchinsky and Vasily Khripin spearheaded the development of aviational doctrine in military academia, the aviational arms industry saw limited production runs for domestic designs due to finite funding, thereby largely continuing to rely on importing foreign aircraft, causing many national companies to turn towards the civilian sector to keep their operations running.\n\nWith the rise of the SZRS came a turning point for the VVFR between the visions of Lapchinsky, who sees the air force as an extension of the army, closely coordinating to achieve tactical success on the battlefield and in the skies, and Khripin, who envisions an airforce that can operate independently behind the frontlines to achieve strategic success with widespread destruction of enemy industry, infrastructure, and critical supply lines."
 rusfla.8.a: "Rad staratsya!"

 rusfla.9.t: "The Russian Military Maritime Fleet"
 rusfla.9.d: "Whilst previously seen as a potential rival to other European navies, the Voyenno-Morskoy Flot Rossii (Military Maritime Fleet of Russia) has had a hard time shaking off the reputation it gained during the 1904 Russo-Japanese War, culminating in the disastrous voyage of the Russian Baltic Fleet to the Pacific. Though it saw relatively successful campaigns in both the Baltic and Black Sea during the Great War, the resulting Russian Civil War has left the VMFR ultimately playing catch-up with its adversaries.\n\nHeaded by Supreme Admiral of the Fleet Aleksandr Vasilyevich Kolchak, the VMFR saw its first rearmament programme of retrofitting and modification to modern standards in 1923, although not to the Great Admiral's expectations as economic woes during the mid-20s forced many old and unfinished vessels to be scrapped to adjust to the new military budget. Although attempts to reignite naval spending during the Manchurian Conflict were short lived, the conflict led to the long-awaited Izmail Class Battleship finally departing drydock in 1930, followed by a second rearmament programme in 1932 with the Gnevny Class Destroyers and controversial Nakhimovets Class Submarines.\n\nWhile Kolchak's efforts have yielded a combat-ready and nationally respected naval force, the inevitable clash with the German bloc draws ever closer, and further grooming of the fleets is required to turn the VMFR into a true competitor to rival the dominant Kaiserliche Marine."

 rusfla.11.t: "Memoirs of a Terrorist - Part 1"
 rusfla.11.d: "Boris Viktorovich was born in Kharkov in 1879 in a middle-class family and spent much of his youth in Warsaw and then in Saint-Petersburg. His father, a judge, was dismissed for his liberal views. His brother Aleksandr, a social democrat, was sent to Siberia and committed suicide. The other brother, Viktor, would follow Boris' footsteps.\n\nHe was arrested for the first time when he was 18 for taking part in student riots and socialist organisations. After short stints in Germany and Switzerland, he was eventually sent to exile in Vologda. This brought the young man into the Socialist-Revolutionary Combat Organisation in 1903.\n\nHe later recalled his short years in the Combat Organisation as the formative period of his life. His cell took part in multiple high-profile assassinations, such as Minister von Plehve and Grand Prince Sergey Aleksandrovich. It was during this time that he met Aleksandr Dikgof, a fellow terrorist, who would become his long-time confidant. During this time, Savinkov immersed himself in the philosophy of terror, murder, and Nietzsche, formulating his idea of the 'Knights of Terror' as the source of societal change, drawing from the terrorist-Narodist traditions of Narodnaya Volya.\n\nBut there was a snake in paradise. In 1908, the leader of the Combat Organisation, Evno Azef, Boris' mentor, was revealed to be an agent provocateur in service of Okhrana. In his own words, this broke Savinkov's spirit: what little belief in socialism or Narodism he may have had was shattered, and cynicism won in the end. As he described himself, he became the Underground Man from Dostoyevsky's novel, an anti-hero in a permanent state of ideological crisis and mental anguish, a terrorist without a cause."
 rusfla.11.a: "Terrorist of a bygone era..."

 rusfla.12.t: "Memoirs of a Terrorist - Part 2"
 rusfla.12.d: "Boris Viktorovich had spent the decade beforethe February Revolution in exile in Paris, writing and seething. During this time, he met Dmitry Merezhkovsky and Zinaida Gippius, whose religious ideas would influence Savinkov further into apocalyptic terrorism. After Tsarism was toppled in Russia, he returned to Russia and, with his political connections, quickly rose in the war ministry and into General Kornilov's trust. This made him part of Kornilov's power grab, and subsequently, Savinkov was expelled from the PSR - not that he had believed in their cause for years.\n\nHe fled to the Don, where he was present at the foundation of the Volunteer Army. General Alekseyev sent him to Moscow to organise resistance. The 1st SZRS was founded there as a central organisation for anti-Bolshevik terrorist activities. Those from this period would become the old core of the SZRS, men like Dikgof, Klepikov, Gopper, and Vendzyagolsky. Uprisings were launched, but only one succeeded: the legendary Rybinsk Rebellion.\n\nThe Whites of Northern Russia rallied behind the SZRS' success, and the Northern Volunteer Army was formed with Karl Gopper as its military leader and Boris Savinkov as its political head, and overall commander of the Northern Oblast under Yevgeny Miller. To avoid being crushed by superior Bolshevik numbers, the army, consisting largely of SR militias and volunteers, fled north, eventually linking up with the Entente troops in Arkhangelsk. For a year, they would fight in the spruce forests and swamps of the Russian north.\n\nSavinkov represented his army at the Second Ufa Conference and managed to even talk many of the SRs into supporting Kolchak 'temporarily', but he returned to the north already in November 1919. The situation there had grown dire after the collapse and evacuation of the Entente forces, and under tremendous pressure from Tukhachevsky's Northern Front, the Northern Volunteer Army made the bitter decision to retreat, trekking through 500 kilometres of snowy forests, under constant fighting with the Reds. After four long, grueling months of icy march, and two bloody years since the Rybinsk Rebellion, they would unite with the rest of the Whites on the Volga, and be hailed as heroes."
 rusfla.12.a: "He marched through the ice and snow..."

 rusfla.13.t: "Memoirs of a Terrorist - Part 3"
 rusfla.13.d: "Black sheep of the Socialist-Revolutionaries, hero of the north, auteur-terrorist. Boris Viktorovich Savinkov had become a legend.\n\nAgain a member of the reunified SR party, he gathered the 'Right-SRs' around him - who would found the 2nd SZRS in 1924 (making the former Centre-SRs under Chernov the new Right-SRs). Savinkov never accepted the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, and gathered disgruntled veterans, radical intelligentsia, and discontent peasantry around his banner, speaking of a 'People's Russia' and of the great destiny awaiting Russia.\n\nThe message was simple - first, Russia has been stabbed in the back in the great war, and after so much blood, toil, and tears from Russian peasants merely fighting for their basic freedoms, even that victory was mutilated by politicians, who were readily selling the country to Germans, socialists, liberals, and Jews. Only knights of terror - men who acted - could save the republic, just like they had saved Russia as a whole. And from these ideas, the ideology of National Narodism was formulated, largely by Savinkov himself.\n\nThis message found fertile ground in Russia, beaten by economic hardships and political instability. The SZRS' electoral successes would be meagre until 1928, when much of the disappointment over the disastrous Fengtian War would be channelled towards the SZRS, who accused the weak liberal government of acting on economic interests, humiliating the Russian nation once again.\n\nWith increasing popular support, the SZRS' Svobodnik Combat Squads would greatly increase their activity, in particular focusing their efforts on the socialists who have 'escaped justice', and 'German collaborators'. The violence would escalate, even though it is officially not sanctioned by the SZRS party. Its conclusion was the Tambov Rebellion, as peasants of the region would rise up against landowners, directed by SZRS agitators - and as it would be crushed, another batch of martyr blood was spilled for the Third Russia. Finally, the 1934 elections saw the SZRS win a majority in the Duma, propelling Savinkov into the presidency."

 rusfla.14.t: "Memoirs of a Terrorist - Part 4"
 rusfla.14.d: "The Vozhd of All the Russias - a troubled lawyer's son from Kharkov - has seen his country go through Tsarist oppression, through bloody Communism, through spineless democracy and humiliation. But he did what few dared to dream twenty years ago - he restored the great Third Russia to its deserved place as the Übermensch of History, a nation fated to remake the world and bring light to it.\n\nAlready as a young man, Boris Viktorovich had felt that his life was not entirely his own. He was pushed on by outside forces he could not comprehensively explain, be it God, Fate, or Volkgeist. Fate had given him an indomitable will and a heart of steel, and pushed him through all the suffering to heights that few men reach. It was not his place, nor his ability, to resist it.\n\nOld SRs remember how they often took refuge in the idea that no matter how terrible and immoral the deed they do now, it is all for a higher purpose. What are a few deaths in the path to fulfilling the destiny of the Russian people? All the sins would be washed away by the judgment of history! And so many brothers and sisters had died, believing in eventual redemption, but only a few had lived to see it.\n\nAnd so he wrote to his long-term friend Zinaida Gippius; 'With depressing irony, I once again find myself as a revolutionary without a cause. I can finally rest, and watch the sunrise over grateful Russia, yet I do not feel redemption, nor satisfaction. I remain the anguished underground man.'"

 rusfla.15.t: "The Legacy of the Northern Volunteer Army"
 rusfla.15.d: "Memory of the heroes who volunteered to save Russia during the civil war has lived on in countless ways, from veterans' organisations to inherited uniforms and symbols. The red-and-black uniforms of the Kornilovites are just one example. The traditions of Markovites, Drozdovites and Alekseyevites are alive and well, shown with their unique uniforms in parades and with their own insignia on dress uniforms.\n\nBut under Savinkov's reign, one uniform has become like no other. The so-called Savinkovian or Gopperian uniform was designed only very late in the war, when various White armies started to design their own uniforms inspired by the original four. The Savinkovtsy uniform is based on the green-and-black uniform with red-and-gold skull epaulettes of the Siberian Shock Regiments, fitting to the green hell that the Northern Volunteer Army marched through. A similar uniform was adopted by the Svobodnik marching formations, with death's head epaulettes. The cap is a distinctive bright red with a black band, akin to the Kornilovites.\n\nThe Vozhd often uses a dashing Hussar version of the Savinkovtsy uniform in formal military contexts, showcasing his own military record as at least equal to that of his generals. In fact, the uniform of the Northern Volunteer Army has been connected so deeply with the Svobodnik and SZRS paramilitaries that it has become more a symbol associated more strongly with National Narodism than with the original army."
 rusfla.15.a: "People need symbols."

 rusfla.16.t: "Citizen Romanovs"
 rusfla.16.d: "The current claimant to the Russian throne, albeit only in the minds of the monarchists, is former Grand Prince, now common citizen Kirill Vladimirovich Romanov. After the death of the Tsar's grandson Nikolay, Kirill, who is the first cousin of the Tsar, became the de facto heir.\n\nAfter the sore disappointment of the monarchists in 1921 as the monarchy was indeed not restored, they have been reasonably conciliatory. Kirill himself has been known as the 'Republican Tsar' due to siding with the February Revolutionaries early on and his subsequent support for the republic 'if it is the will of the people'.\n\nKirill's son Vladimir is the darling of the press. Young and handsome, he represents the very epitome of the modern royal of the 1930s. Vladimir delights in Russia's vibrant cultural life, takes part in motor racing competitions and is a common host of charity events. Many of these also serve as a vehicle for politics, as the prince is a much bolder proponent of monarchism than his humble and moderate father is. It is Vladimir's strong personality that gives Russian monarchists hope.\n\nSavinkov's ascension has created problems for the Romanovs. Savinkov has nothing but distaste for them, but hasn't yet dared to move against them - or just doesn't even consider them a threat. It does not help that many grassroots Svobodniks do not share Savinkov's hate of the monarchy - quite the contrary, they hold even a rose-tinted view of the Romanovs as martyrs of the civil war.\n\nKirill has withdrawn from what few public appearances he did before, and the worsening political situation has given even Vladimir pause. Despite his initial statements claiming Savinkov 'is putting the republic in order', he has since rebuked any attempt by SZRS figures to gain official approval from him.\n\nWhispers are that the Romanovs have been drafting plans to leave the country on short notice, should it come to the worst."

 rusfla.17.t: "Solonevich and the Stabs-Captain Movement"
 rusfla.17.loc: "A bodybuilder, a martial arts master, a journalist, and a writer - Ivan Solonevich's career has been a curious one, and he can be justly said to be one of the most famous conservative thinkers of the new generation. In the 1920s, while working as head of physical education in Petrograd, he founded the People's Imperial Stabs-Captain Movement, explaining that a Stabs-Captain (or Staff-Captain) is someone who runs the unit while the commander is away - the commander obviously referring to the Tsar.\n\nThe Stabs-Captain Movement is primarily focused on physical training: they organise sports events, spread information about healthy lifestyles and the evils of alcohol, and run weightlifting and boxing competitions. But they also serve as an ideological movement, one whose members are encouraged to read Solonevich's writings and proclaim 'People's Monarchism'. Thanks to the tireless work of the four Solonevich brothers, the movement has spread from Petrograd to Moscow, Novgorod, Smolensk and many other cities."
 rusfla.17.d.szrs: "$rusfla.17.loc$\n\nSolonevich has refused to integrate his movement into the SZRS' All-Russian League of Sports, claiming that his movement is already sufficiently patriotic and does not need political oversight from the Svobodniks. He has refused closer cooperation with the Party multiple times, even if he has admitted that he supports many of Savinkov's policies, chiefly his land reforms and stricter line against socialism."
 rusfla.17.d.soc: "$rusfla.17.loc$\n\nSolonevich has quickly become a critic of the Workers' Coalition, making claims such as 'socialism is inherently alien to the Russian people' but encouraging the People's Monarchists to gain influence through workers' councils, not through illegal means, and seek evolution of the system into a true People's Monarchy."
 rusfla.17.d.mon: "$rusfla.17.loc$\n\nNow that the Tsar has returned, the Stabs-Captain Movement has surged greatly, and Solonevich's writings on People's Monarchy have been spreading faster than ever. The Captain is back, and the Stabs-Captains can focus on serving his will, content in knowing that they remained loyal despite all adversaries."
 rusfla.17.d.dem: "$rusfla.17.loc$\n\nAfter the fall of Savinkov, Solonevich has risen like a star to become one of the top names in the All-Russian Patriotic Party. He kept his distance from the SZRS and has been cleverly utilising some of the Vozhd's talking points while making it clear that they cannot work without crowning a new Tsar to ensure that the leaders will stay true to the people."
 rusfla.17.a: "Shut down this nonsense, then."
 rusfla.17.b: "Seems harmless enough."
 rusfla.17.c: "[ROOT.GetLeader]'s finest sons!"

 rusfla.18.t: "The Old Svobodniks"
 rusfla.18.d: "The core of Savinkov's regime has always been the men of the first SZRS: the times when it was a resistance organisation and not a political party. It's the men who fought from Yaroslavl and Rybinsk to Arkhangelsk, who braved the cold of northern Russian forests for two years before their great march east. The camaraderie of soldiers of the Northern Volunteer Army forms the core of the SZRS, and there remains a clear division between the 'soldier-Svobodniks' of the first SZRS and the 'politician-Svobodniks' of the second.\n\nWho are the Old Svobodniks? One only has to look at the Vozhd's right-hand men - Aleksandr Dikgof-Derental, Flegont Klepikov, Karl Gopper, Karol Vendzyagolsky, Maksimilian Filonenko, Ivan Savinov, Nikolay Mamyrin, Nikolay Sakharov and so on. The very men whose uniforms were decorated with the Order of the Northern Ice March by General Kornilov in 1921. United by blood, toil and cold, a more primal connection than anything that civilian life can offer.\n\nIt is very hard for new SZRS members to penetrate this circle, and the Vozhd has always considered the 'civilians' as the outer rim of the party - valuable, yes, but untested in fire and blood. This has created a lot of resentment, as somewhat mediocre men like Dikgof are elevated into the highest positions because of this deep trust the Vozhd has for them, which also makes them essentially untouchable inside the party."
 rusfla.18.a: "War binds men stronger than ideas."

 rusfla.19.t: "The Circle of Eurasianist-Ideocrats"
 rusfla.19.d: "Among Petrograd's intelligentsia, the SZRS is dominated by Professor Pyotr Savitsky's and Prince Dmitry Svyatopolk-Mirsky's Eurasian Circle, which has been publishing the theory of Eurasianism for a decade now. They joined the SZRS in the 1930s as they believed that Boris Savinkov's vision would best adhere to Savitsky's 'Ideocratic Eurasianism', and Savinkov, in turn, gave patronage to the intellectual movement he saw as a purifying element against the liberalism and socialism that was plaguing Russian society.\n\nThe group split with N. Alekseyev's conservative Eurasianists in 1927 and has since embraced Savitsky's Ideocratic concepts more thoroughly. They support the total insubordination of the 'Eurasian Nation' to its foundational idea, personified by the Vozhd and other Knights of Terror. The ideocrats seek a total state composed of East Slavic and Turanic elements, unified by cultural-historical ties. They admire the rule of Genghis Khan and see unshackled expansion as Russia's geographically defined purpose.\n\nThe core doctrine of Savitsky's Eurasianism is the concept of 'living space' ('mesto dlya razvitiya'), the geographical conditions which define the peoples living within them. People who live in the same biome or geographic area form a common civilisation and have a natural desire to unite. Russia, in their view, forms the core of a 'steppe civilisation' which encompasses all peoples in Eastern Europe and Central Asia - Eurasianists ascribe them a collective kinship and call for them to unite under Russian rule. Savitsky declares that the Grand Duchy of Moscow, and therefore Russia, is the successor to the Mongol Empire and that Genghis Khan was a hero of the Russian people.\n\nThis 'Russia-Eurasia' needs to embody the ideas and beliefs which Eurasianists believe are 'Eurasian' - selflessness, heroism, societal hierarchy and obedience. Eurasianists believe that democracy is a form of governance for 'sea peoples' and is completely unfitting for Russia; not only should Russia fight against democracy being imposed upon it, but also liberate other non-European nations from Western rule and defeat what they perceive as Western 'cultural imperialism'.\n\nProfessor Savitsky has nearly gathered a cult-following among SZRS intellectuals and has grown to be an influential voice and expert of geopolitics within the party."
 rusfla.19.a: "Ensure they get their ideas heard."
 rusfla.19.b: "They may be our lunatics, but they are lunatics nonetheless."

 rusfla.20.t: "The Russo-Eurasian Future, by N. Alekseyev and N. Trubetskoy"
 rusfla.20.d: "The Eurasian intelligentsia was badly tainted by their association with the SZRS and its propaganda machinery. However, not all Eurasianists bowed down to Savinkov. Nikolay Alekseyev in particular, one of the founders of the movement, had sought to re-invent Eurasianism and purify it from Svobodnik taint alongside his protégé, Nikolay Trubetskoy.\n\nIn their joint publication, 'The Russo-Eurasian Future', they define the new principles of the Russian Eurasianist movement. While they maintain the core - that Russia has more in common with Turkic peoples than Latin, and that its fate is defined by the Eurasian steppe - they have made a sharp turn from more authoritarian elements. Instead, Alekseyev argues that the Eurasian state should be governed federally, in a union between democracy and an 'aristocracy of the educated', and a union between private and public markets.\n\nThey have also proposed the creation of the University of Eurasianist Thought, which would focus on studies concerning Asia. Alekseyev argues that Russia needs a diplomatic corps educated in Chinese and Indian matters, and believes that the Asiatic nations will grow in importance compared to the old West."
 rusfla.20.a: "Support their initiative!"
 rusfla.20.b: "Seems odd."
 RUS_supported_eurasianism: "Supported the University of Eurasianist Thought"

 rusfla.21.t: "The Fellow-Travellers"
 rusfla.21.d: "For a long time, the radicalism of the SZRS kept conservatives at bay, but after the Fengtian Conflict and the Tambov Emergency, popular opinion started to favour Savinkov, who had also started to portray his party as more moderate, disavowing the Svobodnik terrorist wing officially. When it was clear that Russian moderate parties had failed, many jumped to the successful SZRS bandwagon, forming the so-called 'moderates' within Savinkov's ranks.\n\nThe word 'moderate' does not necessarily describe these people accurately - yes, they generally do not support political violence, an absolute dictatorship or any of the other 'excesses' of the SZRS. But when push comes to shove, they are willing to support the Vozhd - after all, is he not moving Russia in the right direction? If we cannot have a Tsar, we can at least have a strong, unifying leader. Liberal democracy failed! The National Narodnik movement may have its radicals, but ultimately they seek to create a greater, free Russia for all Russians, don't they? What are a few thousand political prisoners when the destiny of Russia is at stake?\n\nThe major names that have risen up as part of this moderate faction are justices like Boris Vysheslavtsev and Maksimilian Filonenko, cultural influencers such as Dmitry Merezhkovsky and Alisa Berkova, and turncoats from moderate parties, like ex-Kadet Nikolay Vakar. Nowadays, they form a compliant majority within the SZRS movement, seemingly with constantly growing acceptance for the current system."
 rusfla.21.a: "And many will join them!"

 rusfla.22.t: "Never Another Brest-Litovsk"
 rusfla.22.d: "Despite Savinkov's fall, some of his promises still resonate. During his presidency, the government showcased grand propaganda campaigns, depicting the oppression of Slavic peoples under pro-German governments and corporations, only interested in extracting maximum profits for Berlin, just like they had done in Russia. According to the polls, Savinkov's promise to avenge Brest-Litovsk and liberate the 'German-occupied Western Territories' still resonates.\n\nPro-war publications are citing the heightening tensions between the great powers, the temporary weakness of Germany due to the economic crisis, and the growing socialist armies in the west as hopeful signs. Surprisingly, it is something that has found support all across the political spectrum. Even those who are not particularly nationalist-minded agree that Germany is a threat to liberty, socialism, and national self-determination. Others speak of defending the rights of Little and White Russians, and the more right you go, the clearer the demands are for a simple revenge, the humiliation of Germany and the realisation of Russian world power."
 rusfla.22.a: "... and we can't wait to watch Berlin burn."

 rusfla.23.t: "The Kurchatov Petition"
 rusfla.23.d: "Particle physicists have achieved many breakthroughs in Russia in the 1930s. Spearheaded by scientists such as Igor Kurchatov, Igor Tamm, Georgy Gamov and others, our experimental research institutes have formed a sound theory on the potential held by nuclear fission. They were not the only ones, however. It is no secret that nuclear physicists in Germany and the Third Internationale have been delving into the potential of nuclear power as well, and all of them have come to the same conclusion - that it can be weaponised.\n\nIgor Kurchatov and several other Russian nuclear physicists have collectively signed a petition and presented it to [Root.GetLeader], where they have rung alarm bells. Kurchatov informs that foreign scientific journals have ceased any and all publications about nuclear research, even the most mundane reports, which can only mean that it has become confidential information and Russia's enemies must be actively developing nuclear armament. The only answer is to create a dedicated Russian nuclear weapons programme - a request which Kurchatov and his peers have been granted. Under [Root.GetLeader]'s personal orders, new facilities have been opened deep in Central Siberia for the RDS-1 project - Reactive Special Engine - which shall recruit Russia's brightest to develop a weapon with the power to manifest Apocalypse on Earth."
 rusfla.23.a: "Russia shall wield this superweapon."
 rusfla.23.b: "The ultimate solution to the question of terror."

 rusfla.25.t: "The Old Friend, the Old Enemy"
 rusfla.25.d: "The taxation of sales of vodka has remained one of the major sources of state income for Russia ever since the days of Tsar Ivan the First. The system has gone through a number of changes, from state monopoly to private alcohol licences. It is the latter system that was adopted in the 1920s as part of the liberalisation of the economy: any sale of hard alcohol requires an annually renewed licence, with its price based on the scope of sales. The intent of the law is to both regulate alcohol markets and raise state revenue from it.\n\nThe temperance movement has kept calling for reduced licences and, in general, limiting the sale of alcohol, while the producers generally prefer laxer regulations and easier licences. Opponents of the 'devil's drink' do make good points - alcohol is proven to increase crime and drive the poorest Russians into poverty, but its effect on the economy is also great. Many peasants gain extra revenue through vodka sales, and if the supply of vodka is reduced, it will only create a new black market. Besides... the more vodka is sold, the more the state gains revenue. Some have proposed to support beer breweries over vodka, as it is seen as a milder and less harmful drink."
 rusfla.25.a: "Increase the price of alcohol licences."
 rusfla.25.b: "Relax the market. A toast to Russia!"
 rusfla.25.c: "Enact preferential treatment for beer."
 rusfla.25.e: "Move towards prohibition."

 rusfla.26.t: "Churchill's Iron Curtain Speech"
 rusfla.26.d: "Germany's defeat at the hands of combined French and Russian arms six months ago has sent shockwaves across the world, and it has become apparent that this 'Second Weltkrieg' has changed the face of Europe for years to come. The continent has been divided between the Third Internationale and the Russian bloc, both of which wield enormous forces and have a bone to pick with the other side. And yet, neither of them has chosen to strike first, leaving the continent split in twain.\n\nPetrograd University in Russia has had the honour of hosting Sir Winston Churchill, a noted British statesman, writer, and former First Lord of the Admiralty of Britain. Speaking to the attending students, Churchill first made sure to note the great sacrifices which the Russian nation has made during the Second Weltkrieg, and assured that the British Empire and Russia shall always be natural allies in this new world order. The politician described Europe as a continent divided between two fundamentally different forces - one of liberty and one of Syndicalist terror, one of good and one of evil, and that an Iron Curtain divides them. He expressed his dismay that so much of Europe's heritage and famous cities now lie in the 'French sphere', and hoped that Russia and the Commonwealth can unite against this revolutionary threat.\n\nThough Churchill was not the first to express this idea, the striking imagery of his speech has set a new checkpoint in history. Europe, and with it, the world, has been divided in a frozen conflict, one of ideological strife rather than power balance. It may only be solved via subversion, arms race and diplomacy... or a conflict far more destructive than the Second Weltkrieg."
 rusfla.26.a: "A new age in world history..."

 rusfla.28.t: "History of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion"
 rusfla.28.d: "The now-infamous anti-semitic fabrication first surfaced in Russia in 1903 and soon became widely circulated as a justification for pogroms. The Protocols claim a global Jewish conspiracy - infiltration by Jews into Christian societies, their conspiring with the Freemasons, their plan to take control of the world economy. This conspiracy was quickly used to explain all the woes of the Russian Empire - the Russo-Japanese War and the revolutions of 1905, 1917, and 1918, chiefly spread by the Black Hundredist organisations.\n\nThe text raised controversy already in 1903, and critics of its authenticity have pointed to the vagueness and lack of sources given in the Protocols. Eventually, Pyotr Stolypin's government banned circulation of the text as a fabrication, citing that 'a good cause cannot be defended by false means'. This did little, and the Protocols were spread during the Civil War as part of the White Movement's propaganda against the Bolsheviks, and eventually spread to other parts of Europe, too.\n\nBy the 1930s, it has been generally accepted that the Protocols are a fabricated text - but they are still used by anti-semites, often arguing that while the historical facts of the Protocols may be unproven, it does not make the main argument false, and, in fact, that the October Coup even proved the conspiracy. It seems that lies are terribly difficult to eradicate."

 rusfla.29.t: "The Case of the Pokrovsk Saboteurs"
 rusfla.29.d: "In a widely publicised series of trials in the Volga-German capital of Pokrovsk, 29 people from the Saratov Gubernia were sentenced to death for spying and sabotage, and 73 were sentenced to hard labour in Siberia. Almost all of the defendants were of Volga-German descent, and they included many educated teachers, lawyers and engineers. They were guilty of maintaining contacts with the Abteilung-IIIb, the German foreign intelligence service, and preparing to carry sabotage strikes against critical military and industrial infrastructure in Saratov.\n\nThe defence argued that the evidence was flimsy, but ignoring it was not an option - it was the finest fabrication that Okhrana could make. Besides, what does it matter if the evidence was not real? It is obvious that the Volga-German intelligentsia, educated and with access to various important Russian military faculties, would eventually turn on us - we simply need to take precautionary measures before the Abteilung-IIIb could recruit them.\n\nAmong the defendants were multiple important officials from the Volga-German Uyezds. These positions can now be filled with loyal Russian civil servants, who will continue precautionary actions starting with the purge of unreliable elements from local police forces, eventually bringing them under full control of the party. With proper force, more thorough investigations can be launched to capture the remaining Abteilung-IIIb spies."
 rusfla.29.a: "Hard work will teach them loyalty."

 rusfla.30.t: "Establishment of the Border Zone"
 rusfla.30.d: "The Border Zone of [RUS.GetNameDef] (ZP) was established based on the 'Law on the State Border' passed by the [RUS_legislature] today. The new border region, usually 7.5 km deep, would be put under special surveillance. People who were not residents could not enter the border regions without explicit permission from the Ministry of Internal Affairs or the Ministry of War.\n\nThis zone will also include the majority of the Black Sea and Baltic Sea coastline. With these precautions, spying and sabotage by foreign nationals can be restricted greatly, and the border regions can be dedicated to defence purposes."

 rusfla.31.d: "As per the new Border Zone legislation, millions now live inside the restricted military zones of the Russian borders. Based on an additional executive order, people of 'questionable political loyalty' will be removed from the border regions and re-settled deeper into Russia, with priority given to the western border.\n\nIngrian Finns have been among the first targeted due to their proximity to Petrograd and thus of utmost national security importance. The Gosstrazha operations are also scheduled against Karelians, Chechens, Ingushians and the Kuban Ukrainians living in the border region. Thousands of people have been moved to safer parts of their respective Gubernias and employed in state service for an undetermined time."
 rusfla.31.a: "Better be careful than sorry."

 rusfla.32.t: "Attack on the Synagogue of Vladivostok"
 rusfla.32.d: "The worst attack on the Russian Jewish community has happened in Vladivostok today, as the local chapter of the Svobodniks lit the Vladivostok Synagogue on fire and at the same time coordinated assaults on multiple Jewish-owned businesses. The attack was led by Konstantin Rodzaevsky, a regional Svobodnik leader and SZRS fanatic, who had vowed to 'purify the Amur of Zionist terrorists' as 'an example to the rest of Russia'.\n\nThe single night saw the oldest synagogue in the Russian Far East burn down, and a sizeable part of Vladivostok's over a thousand Jewish people harassed and intimidated. The Governor of Amur, Spiridon Merkulov, promised to investigate any serious crimes, but it was clear that even if arrests are made, the Svobodniks will not be seriously punished.\n\nIt is likely that actions such as Rodzaevsky's will only increase attacks on Russian Jewish communities, be it in the form of violent attacks or witch-hunts through communist-hunting courts."
 rusfla.32.a: "Alright."

 rusfla.33.t: "Uprising of the Right-SRs"
 rusfla.33.d: "In the far northern Urals, the Vorkuta Katorga complex has been taken over by the prisoners. The camp, whose prisoners have been put to build railways and a coal mine in the frozen wasteland, was built hastily, and it seems that it was understaffed by the Interior Troops. A large number of relatively fresh prisoners - mainly former Socialist-Revolutionaries tried with various accounts of sabotage, spying, and pro-German collaboration - started a strike a week or so ago, which escalated into complete chaos as they were able to overpower the guards and even take over a machine gun, which they used to force the camp staff into the tundra.\n\nThe leader of the uprising, Grigory Kotovsky, is a bandit, an SR, and a former Red Army soldier. By chance, Vladimir Rikhter was also sent to the very same complex, and he quickly became a rabble-rouser and agitator, swaying many prisoners into active resistance. The prisoners demanded to be allowed to have lawyers and made various demands for better working conditions; in addition, Rikhter gained fame by demanding President Savinkov shoot himself to save the Russian people the trouble.\n\nReinforcements have been dispatched to Vorkuta under the command of General-Lieutenant Kalashnikov, and the revolt, dubbed by some as the 'Uprising of the Right-Esers' after the failed revolt in 1917, will be dealt with swiftly."
 rusfla.33.a: "Should've sent them to Kamchatka."

 rusfla.34.t: "The Fate of the Veterans' Organisations"
 rusfla.34.d.szrs: "After the civil war, many organisations appeared to protect the legacy of the brave soldiers who defeated the red menace. The Union of Volunteers 'Alekseyevites', the Association of the Siberian Riflemen, the Czechoslovak Veterans' Union, the Krasnov Organisation, the Green Union, and many others were largely organised around specific civil war-era armies.\n\nAlmost all of these are now supportive towards the SZRS, but the Green Union has been especially loyal to the cause. Its long-time leader is Aleksandr Stepanovich Antonov, the famous Vozhd of the Tambov peasants and a close ally of Savinkov in the region. What started as a veterans' organisation for various peasant partisans that rose up against the Bolshevik menace has eventually become the second largest veterans' union and a recruitment base for the Svobodniks.\n\nIn our programme to take full control of Russian life, we have two options. Either all of these organisations are disbanded and merged into a single, new organisation under the SZRS, or we utilise the Green Union as the foundational bloc and require all other organisations to join it. Either way, the outcome is a single veterans' organisation under the political control of the party, which can be used for recruitment, propaganda, and training."

Under Aleksandr Antonov, the famous Vozhd of the Tambov peasants, the organisation became essentially a recruitment pool and political front for the Svobodniks. Antonov was forced to resign, but it is no secret that many of these organisations still harbour anti-democratic ideas.\n\nMore radical voices have called for outright disbanding the Green Union and for an investigation to root out Svobodnik sympathisers from these groups. However, the veterans are a very powerful lobby group, and moving against them would not look good for our government."
 rusfla.34.d.soc: "After the civil war, many reactionary organisations appeared to protect the legacy of 'the Whites' - attack dogs of the aristocrats and the capitalists. The Union of Volunteers 'Alekseyevites', the Association of the Siberian Riflemen, the Czechoslovak Veterans' Union, the Krasnov Organisation, the Green Union, and many others were largely organised around specific civil war-era armies. Attempts at organising similar associations for the veterans of the Red Army were usually crushed through the courts, and in practice, the only body that gave support to the red veterans was the non-partisan Mutual Union of Veterans.\n\nAlmost all of these veterans' organisations were first in line in crushing workers' rights. They served as a manpower pool for the strike-breaking guards and offered 'volunteer support' to law enforcement. Despite attempts by the republic to craft peace, they crafted strife. And now they have risen again: veterans' unions are arranging protests all across Russia, with anti-communist and anti-democratic slogans. In more conservative regions, there have even been violent clashes between the veterans and workers' guards.\n\nGrigory Zinovyev has given the People's Minister of Interior Affairs a proposal signed by a hundred members of the Congress, demanding any organisation 'glorifying reactionary terror' be abolished. This proposal did raise some opposition, mainly from the SR party. Dmitry Popov pointed out that some of these organisations are maintained by SR-aligned peasants, like the organisations commemorating the People's Army of Komuch. Thus, only monarchist, Savinkovite, or openly reactionary organisations should be abolished, and these 'healthy' organisations should be allowed to operate in tandem with red veterans."

 rusfla.35.t: "The Volunteers' March"
 rusfla.35.d.soc: "As a show of force, major demonstrations by the veterans' organisations have been arranged across Russia's major cities, especially in Southern Russia. Nikolay Tretyakov, the new spokesman of the Union of Volunteers 'Alekseyevites', the largest single veterans' organisation, held a speech near the Alekseyev Memorial in Yekaterinodar, which also saw speeches by the retired Sergey Markov. The veterans are protesting the 'tyrannical' decision by the government to ban large numbers of veterans' organisations as reactionary. They are demanding non-socialists be allowed into the cabinet and are calling for [GetSecondInCommand]'s immediate resignation and the restoration of democracy.\n\nThe protests have inspired counter-protests by local socialist groups, and the Yekaterinodar People's Militia was put into great difficulty in keeping the two sides out of each other's throats. The city leader considered sending in the military, but he was worried about their conviction to actually fight against figures such as Markov and the old Volunteers. The situation remained dangerous until nightfall, when the marches were dispersed for the time being.\n\nThe protests have since continued for almost a week, and the VGPU has recommended for the ministry to crack down harshly on the protests. A special operation can be arranged to arrest the leadership of the rebellious veterans' organisations, and the whole matter would be settled in a few days. The alternative is to budge and make some concessions to the protesters, such as allowing more of these organisations to function as long as they withdraw from politics."

Nikolay Tretyakov, the spokesman of the Union of Volunteers 'Alekseyevites', the largest single veterans' organisation, held a speech near the Alekseyev Memorial in Yekaterinodar, where he condemned the government's attempts to curb freedom of speech. The attempt to rein in the veterans was painted as a neo-communist witch hunt hell-bent on desecrating the legacy of the Volunteers.\n\nWhile the situation has been peaceful so far outside a few minor incidents, this demonstration of thousands of veterans is very worrisome. Even many centrists in the Duma are now advocating for restraint, no doubt not willing to anger such a large portion of the electorate. In response, Vladimir Rikhter held a fiery and poorly thought speech condemning the veteran activists for collaborating with Savinkov in the first place, and cited that as a proof of the anti-republican mindset of many of these unions. As an alternative, he encouraged all democracy-loving Whites to join SR-led movements, or vote the 'reactionary' leaders out of the veterans' unions."

 rusfla.36.t: "Operation Against Union of Volunteers"
 rusfla.36.d: "The headquarters of the largest White veterans' organisations were raided by VGPU officers supported by the People's Militias, and some hundreds were arrested for their role in the veterans' protests. Membership lists of these organisations were also confiscated, alongside the funds that now-banned reactionary organisations had. Future arrests will follow.\n\nThe mass arrests prompted only sporadic resistance. In Yekaterinodar, a serious firefight broke out, as the local branch of the Union of Volunteers had stashed submachine guns and grenades to defend themselves. Similar weapons caches were uncovered in multiple places, alongside plans for an armed uprising - 'Operation Alekseyev'. Based on it, the White forces were planning to take over cities near their strongest support areas and topple the socialist government - and if it did not work, start a civil war with the support of foreign powers.\n\nThis 'Alekseyevites Conspiracy' turned what seemed like spreading reactionary propaganda into full-blown treason. This information is not public yet, but using it in courts would force the VGPU to publish the conspiracy documents. Director Blyumkin has requested permission to extend the arrests to nip the conspiracy in the bud."

 rusfla.37.t: "Trial of the Alekseyevites Conspirators"
 rusfla.37.d: "Due to the high profile of the accused, it was not possible to handle the Alekseyevites Conspiracy discreetly. On the bench of the accused are high military men: Vladimir Vitkovsky, Pavel Shatilov, Nikolay Tretyakov and many others caught from positions of leadership. The conspiracy, as the prosecutor Andrey Vyshinsky explains, took part in the high echelons of the military, which cooperated with private veterans' organisations to hide equipment and maintain cohesion to found a terrorist organisation when 'the time was right'. Many retired White generals are incriminated, but ultimately, the operation leadership was stated to be Vitkovsky and Shatilov.\n\nThe defence questioned the legitimacy of the whole conspiracy and accused the trials of being an overreach by the VGPU based on circumstantial evidence. The generals claimed to have no knowledge of the conspiracy or the theoretical organisation, and if one existed, their names had been put into the plans without their knowledge. The retired generals affirmed having sworn oaths not to sabotage the Russian Republic, and that while they have little love for the socialists in charge, they would not collaborate with the enemies of Russia.\n\nUltimately, the main generals were deemed innocent, but a large number of other activists from the Volunteers' Union were sentenced to hard labour for taking part in counter-revolutionary propaganda and violence. Tretyakov himself was sentenced to ten years of hard labour for the crimes of the organisation he had led. Despite the failure to catch the main leaders, hundreds of smaller fish were caught, and the conspiracy is no more."
 rusfla.37.a: "Hopefully that's the end of it."

 rusfla.38.t: "Doubts over the Alekseyevites Conspiracy"
 rusfla.38.d: "Outraged by allowing multiple ringleaders of the Alekseyev conspiracy to roam free, the hardliners in the Congress have pressured the Ministry of Justice to publish the VGPU's documents detailing the claimed conspiracy. While the ministry was amicable to this demand, the VGPU's deputy director, Yakov Serebryansky, recommended the ministry against it, citing the potentially harmful nature of the original documents in inspiring people towards resistance. Director Blyumkin stood by his deputy and refused, which put his organisation and the ministry at odds.\n\nSoon enough, the possibility was raised that the VGPU has fabricated or at least heavily modified the conspiracy documents to use them as a means to persecute the White generals. If this were the case, it would be highly embarrassing for the VGPU and the overall sense of lawfulness if the documents were made public. But again, if they are not, a large part of the Congress will blame [GetSecondInCommand]'s government for secretiveness and authoritarianism, and possibly call for the resignation of the People's Minister of Justice."
 rusfla.38.a: "We do not need to publish it."
 rusfla.38.b: "The Congress has the right to know."

 rusfla.39.t: "Wave of White Sabotage"
 rusfla.39.d: "As we feared, the reactionary network is merely sleeping but not gone. In a semi-coordinated manner, hundreds of people no doubt organised through some underground group have conducted operations of sabotage, spying, and counter-revolutionary propaganda. Factories have been hit, and draft dodging has been greatly encouraged.\n\nMany of these people have been arrested and some shot, but the problem is anything but gone. The security services have assured us they have the situation under control, and will continue fighting in the shadows to root out these Neo-Svobodniks."
 rusfla.39.a: "We will endure it."

 rusfla.40.t: "The Green International Divided"
 rusfla.40.d: "The dual woes of the economic crisis and heightening tensions in the Balkans have thrown the Green International into turmoil. The Green International was founded in 1922 as a Mitteleuropa-aligned peasant's movement based on a vision of peaceful peasant democracy. The most prominent backers of the organisations have been those of the Habsburg Monarchy's various peasant movements. However, the foundation of the Belgrade Pact and its increasingly war-like rhetoric has caused strife inside the movement.\n\nAleksandŭr Stamboliyski of the Bulgarian BZNS, alongside a number of Danubian delegates such as Józef Putek from the Galician PSL, requested that the Bureau expel the Serbian and Romanian parties for their support for war against Bulgaria. Putek read out the proposal by the PSL, calling for peace between all peasant countries and instead suggesting denouncing all radicalism from the peasant's movement, strongly supported by Danubian and many Eastern European delegates.\n\nIvan Kolesnikov's counter-proposal, penned by the Russian, Serbian, Romanian and Latvian delegates, instead called for peasants to actively resist 'Junker rule' and painted the current economic crisis as a chance for Europe to move into 'Third Way' economics of agrarianism and collaboration between peoples. Kolesnikov congratulated the Serbs for their solid stance against 'German encroachment' in the Balkans and offered to arrange negotiations with Stamboliyski to find a solution that would satisfy all Slavic peasant nations, and unify their ranks against the dual threats of Junkerism and Communism."
 rusfla.40.a: "And who will win?"

 rusfla.41.t: "Doctor's Sausages"
 rusfla.41.d: "Though the Svobodniks have been called 'butchers' before, party flags fluttering atop a meat processing plant is still a novelty. Much fanfare has surrounded the First Moscow Sausage Factory. Built with the experience and capital of both Russia and Germany, it is a testament to what can be done when two sausage-loving nations work together. Sadly, its finances and management left much to be desired. Profits were meagre since opening in 1933, as the 'Moscow Sausages' proved unable to compete in Europe and were too pricey for Russians. The factory's German owners, Halberstädter Würstchen, promptly sold it to Russia's government in the wake of Black Monday for a pittance.\n\nThe SZRS have since transformed the First Moscow Sausage Factory into a prototype for their economic vision. The factory has come under the management of an SZRS-led 'artel', a traditional form of trade cooperative given a National Populist makeover. With the government's blessing, 'brother-workers' now run the factory under the supervision of Party-approved 'elders'. Modern dormitories and a church have been constructed near the factory's grounds to better develop a sense of community. Additionally, the plants have been retooled to produce more affordable products.\n\nRumour has it that President Savinkov himself insisted that new, heartier sausages be developed - after all, Russia's people will be as hungry as her factories with the work that lies ahead. It remains to be seen how practical such a transformation can be across Russia, but this sausage stunt has captured public attention. The new and ostensibly healthy 'Doctor's Sausages' are already a hit."
 rusfla.41.a: "Sausages for everyone!"

 rusfla.42.t: "Growing Militarism"
 rusfla.42.d.dem: "Decades of defeat, leaving the fratricidal bloodletting of the Civil War aside, have had an indisputably corrosive effect on the morale of the Russian military. Despite high military budgets and veneration of the army, many remember atrocities committed by the Whites and still see the military as a tool of the oppressors. Especially after the military humiliation of 1928 and the ensuing Boldyrev Putsch, many rallied behind the SZRS with slogans of restoring the army to its former glory. It is no secret that in the 1934 elections SZRS made huge gains in every garrison town.\n\nAnd now Savinkov is five feet under, but the army finds itself greater and stronger than ever, in newfound strength. General-Fieldmarshal [RUS_GetArmyChief] styles himself as the Saviour of Russia and is easily second only to the [RUS_leader]. Aggressive, jingoistic rhetoric is now flowing from the ranks of the army, and the military's revived spirit has proven infectious. The Russian public has begun to express a confidence in its soldiers that would have been unthinkable even just a few short years ago."

It is no secret that in the 1934 elections SZRS made huge gains in every garrison town.\n\nThe mercilessly revanchist rhetoric of the Svobodniks has found fertile ground in the military, which had grown deeply disillusioned with the SRs and Kadets in the wake of their 'second surrender' to Germany under the Vilnius Agreement. Though many officers still hold reservations about the role of the SZRS' commissars, they have come to appreciate the passion with which the political officers have drummed up new recruits all the same. The military's revived spirit has proven infectious, and the Russian public has begun to express a confidence in its soldiers that would have been unthinkable even just a few short years ago."
 rusfla.42.a: "Hurrah!"

 rusfla.43.t: "Day of the Ice March"
 rusfla.43.d: "There are two commemorative days for the Civil War - the 31st of August celebrating Liberation of Moscow, and the 22nd of February remembering the start of the Kuban Ice March. The Day of Liberation is a happy celebration, with upbeat military marching songs and grand displays of strength through Moscow, but the Day of the Ice March is more melancholic, remembering sacrifice and hope.\n\nIn the frosty February cold, a commemorative march is organised from Rostov to Novocherkassk, including the legendary coloured regiments - the black-and-red Kornilovites, Drozdovites in their crimson caps, black-strapped Markovites and Alekseyevites in white and blue. Those who took part in the original march are the guests of honour. Both in Rostov and Novocherkassk, there are great crowds following the march, though it is not a jubilee, but a solemn occasion.\n\nThe official history of the Ice March, written by General Denikin, is often quoted on this day:\n\n— As long as there is life, as long as there is strength, not everything is lost. Russia will see a light flickering faintly; she will hear a voice calling for the fight - those who have not yet woken up...\n\nThis was the whole deep meaning of the First Kuban Campaign. There is no point in approaching it with the cold argumentation of politics and strategy, as it is a phenomenon in which everything is in the realm of the spiritual and the feat being accomplished. The Volunteer Army walked across the free steppes of the Don and Kuban - small in number, tattered, hunted, surrounded - as a symbol of the persecuted Russia and Russian statehood.\n\nIn the entire vast expanse of the country, there was only one place left where the tricolour national flag openly fluttered - and this was Kornilov's headquarters."
 rusfla.43.a: "We went from the dark night of spiritual slavery to unknown wandering - in search of hope."

 rusfla.44.t: "The Psychology of the Totalitarian Mind"
 rusfla.44.d: "The Heidelberg-based Russian sociologist Sergey Stepanovich Chakhotin's magnum opus 'The Psychology of the Totalitarian Mind' has been immediately lauded as a classic and a work that captures much of the zeitgeist of the 1930s, both in Russia and elsewhere. Chakhotin, who fled Russia in 1935 and has been an outspoken critic of totalitarianism in both Russia and Germany, has crafted a convincing narrative on the nature of these 'rabble-rousers of the modern age'.\n\nChakhotin identifies the key support base for all of these movements - both Bolsheviks and Svobodniks - as inherently the same group of people: those left behind by a rapidly modernising society, and the rural poor who work in odd jobs, drifting from one place to another, never with proper foundation or identity. These groups are created by social inequality and they breed bitterness, contempt and fuel for political unrest, should demagogues like Lenin, Savinkov, Schleicher or Long offer them simple, strong leaders to follow.\n\nFocusing on the Russian situation, Chakhotin argues that because none of the underlying social issues that led to the 1917 revolutions were fixed, and their consequences - communism - merely being banned, it only led to that same unrest and inequality channelling itself into a new breed of political movement, the SZRS. Furthermore, these movements are never genuinely interested, able or willing to actually solve the social issues that fuel them. This makes these totalitarian movements inherently irrational and destructive, as they must find new groups to persecute in a show to 'solve' societal issues. This only leads to mass repression - Chekism, Savinkov's purges, and so on - that has no logical end, as it is not founded on any logical premise.\n\nChakhotin's work has received much attention from anti-totalitarian politicians, and was widely thanked as a theoretical framework for a proper explanation of the rise of these 'totalist' groups."
 rusfla.44.a: "This is just pointless slander."
 rusfla.44.b: "Yes, people need to know."

 rusfla.45.t: "The Committee for International Workers' Struggle"
 rusfla.45.d: "Under normal circumstances, one would expect the social democrats to oppose war, but recently that opinion seems to be the exception. There are no protests - quite the contrary. Menshevik Mikhail Yakubovich has spearheaded the creation of the Committee for International Workers' Struggle, funded by Aleksandr Titov and the RDP's field organisation, as an organisation that is meant to support the government's war effort.\n\nIn Yakubovich's pamphlet, he explains that while the proletariat of the world should oppose imperialism as it only serves the interests of capital, the current war is actually one of workers' liberation. Even if Russia is not yet socialist, Russians are standing together with people fighting for freedom and equality - the Third Internationale. Thus, Russian socialists should support the war to their best ability, withdraw from strike action and carry out their military duty. Through this patriotic service, the Russian proletariat will also gain the military experience necessary for protecting the workers.\n\nImmediately, this caused outrage in the RDP. Vladimir Levitsky termed this as 'social chauvinism' and explained that while he agrees that the war waged in support of the Internationale should not be opposed, a socialist should never glorify war like Yakubovich is doing, and pointed out that Russia is still waging its own war for imperialistic reasons. No doubt in the very left there are hopes that the war would bring a repeat of 1917 and another revolution."
 rusfla.45.a: "Let the left fight."
 rusfla.45.b: "Patriotic socialist? Support his initiative."
 rusfla.45.c: "Supportive or not, this man is preaching revolution."

 rusfla.46.t: "Ataman Challenges Vozhd"
 rusfla.46.d: "General Pyotr Nikolayevich Krasnov has served as the Ataman of the Don Host for the past 20 years and is considered one of the living legends of the White cause. For a long time, he was an outspoken supporter of the SOR and reactionary politics, running the Don Host as an 'example' of a traditionalist and anti-communist land. But now this cooperation has hit an impasse, as Savinkov's move to restrict the autonomy of the Cossack hosts and distribute much of their land to ordinary Russian peasants has elicited strong resistance from the Cossacks. He demanded the president cease tarnishing the memories of the veterans who fought for Russian freedom, and respect the Cossacks as an integral part of the White cause.\n\nKrasnov holds much sway, especially in Southern Russia, and there is a chance that he will rally many disgruntled conservatives and generals against Savinkov. However, Savinkov has an ace up his sleeve: his Minister of Agriculture, Pavel Mikhaylovich Agyeyev, is a reformist Don Cossack and an outspoken opponent of Krasnov. Agyeyev has always appeared as a defender of the common Cossack against great landowners like Krasnov. It may be possible to force the Don Circle to elect Agyeyev as the new Ataman and sideline Krasnov in a 'respectable retirement'. A less alienating way to handle the situation would simply be to make concessions to Krasnov and refrain from land reform in Don Host lands."
 rusfla.46.a: "Let us fight then!"
 rusfla.46.b: "He has deserved our respect."
 rusfla.46.c: "Just replace the fool with Agyeyev."
 RUS_remove_krasnov_tt: "§nThe national spirit can be removed by hiring Pavel Agyeyev as a political advisor.§!"

 rusfla.47.t: "Reactionary Monarchy Inside the [RUS_government_loc]"
 rusfla.47.d: "The Cossacks won autonomy after their loyal support of the White armies and have ever since then been a thorn in the side of Russian democracy. Yes, Russia's federal constitution is meant to respect local traditions and cultures - but many liberals have nothing but scorn and criticism towards the Host system, which is seen as a military fief system that simply provides the government with easily mobilised forces who won't hesitate to shoot fellow Russians.\n\nThe worst Host to many is the Don Host. There, Ataman Pyotr Krasnov has reigned as the Host's dictator since 1918. He is an outspoken reactionary, a former member of the SOR, and a man who has nothing but scorn towards the democratic process. Though some would say he has kept the Don Host safe from 'agitation' and 'banditry', he has also done everything in his power to harass the operations of democratic and socialist groups in the area, suppressed trade unions, and fought against land reforms. However, he enjoys both the support of the Don Cossacks and the army, so replacing him is difficult without outright abolishing the Host system. To make matters more annoying, his main opposition came from Pavel Agyeyev's populist Cossacks - the same Agyeyev who was a minister under Savinkov, a SZRS member, and is currently in prison.\n\nUntil the Hosts can be abolished, our options are limited. If we wish to pick a fight with Krasnov, we could try to force him to implement more democratic reforms, and challenge him in the Supreme Court if he refuses. This kind of meddling in Cossack affairs would draw their ire, but it would show our base that we are serious."
 rusfla.47.a: "Better slow reform than an immediate fight."
 rusfla.47.b: "Krasnov must be brought down."

 rusfla.48.t: "A Dream of Monarchy"
 rusfla.48.d: "Solonevich has always held that Russia is inherently a monarchy, and its most true form was the Tsardom of Muscovy. Yet, Russia remains besieged by the western idea of republicanism. His party's programme has always held the restoration of the monarchy as a goal, but until now, it has been merely rhetoric.\n\nNow that the highest office of the state is in the hands of conservatives, it is finally possible to realise it."
 rusfla.48.a: "Consult the best legal experts."

 rusfla.49.t: "How to Crown the Emperor?"
 rusfla.49.d: "The Ministry of Justice produced a lengthy secret note for the President's eyes only. In it, legal experts Konstantin Kharitonov, Roman Raupach and Pavel Pereverzev go through the potential process of the restoration of monarchy in Russia. Unfortunately, the constitutional law is strict: Russia is a republic, period. Changing the Constitution would require a full Constituent Assembly - but while an elected State Duma exists, it requires a majority vote by the entire Assembly. If a monarchist majority can be found, technically it would not be difficult to write a new monarchist constitution.\n\nHowever, the same note is sceptical about the chances of this happening. First off, according to analysts in the ministry, it is highly unlikely that this monarchist majority will be found, and that the current State Duma will even accept convening a Constituent Assembly. Simply put, it is not for the President to decide. Meanwhile, the legal loopholes which Boris Savinkov abused to push his Constitutional changes through do not exist anymore - and even if something like that was tried again, it is highly likely that republican generals, chiefly General-Fieldmarshal Anton Denikin, would use Constitutional Clause 37 to intervene and depose the President acting against the Constitution of the Republic. The only way to avoid this would be ensuring the loyalties of the military beforehand."
 rusfla.49.a: "Fine! We will have an imperial republic, then."
 rusfla.49.b: "I was never the type to give up."

 rusfla.50.t: "Monarchy in our Heart"
 rusfla.50.d: "What would be known as 'The Imperial Republic Speech' was President Solonevich's address on Red Square, mainly to his own supporters. In his speech, he talked at length about Russia's monarchical nature and how the Muscovite Tsardom provides the modern-day Russian with many examples on how to organise society: around a strong, wise leader, advised by the best based on merit and character, not on wealth. That is how it was before serfdom, when every man was respected and each had economic independence; how labour was valued over counting coins.\n\nHowever, this time he did not advocate for the restoration of the monarchy. He explained that since the Constitution of the Republic defines Russia as a republic, the patriotic Russian shall not go against it. Instead, the patriotic Russian shall foster monarchy in his heart as his moral guiding star. Yes, the Constitution is republican, but the blood is imperial. Every man can be the Emperor! The republic can still maintain the values of the Russian Empire: Family, Orthodoxy, Nationality."
 rusfla.50.a: "The Empire lives on!"

 rusfla.51.t: "The Treasonous Meeting"
 rusfla.51.d.wrangel: "Blocked out of legal ways to amend the Constitution, President Solonevich was forced to scout out less legal means. This led him to meet - in secret - with some of the famous monarchist generals at his Peredelkino residence. The forested area near Moscow had grown around the estates of the Dolgorukov family, and the presidential dacha was built there in 1924. As President, Solonevich has often conducted negotiations at his dacha, famously meeting with the Finnish Prime Minister [FIN.GetSecondInCommand] earlier this year and having a sauna together.\n\nHowever, today's meeting is more serious, and military men are not known for wasting time. General-Fieldmarshal Pyotr Nikolayevich Wrangel arrived with a single adjutant, seemingly irritated at being requested under such an informal situation. He and the President shared a bottle as President Ivan Lukyanovich tried to gather information on the views of the monarchists within the army.\n\nWrangel quickly came to understand the nature of this discussion and was not surprised when the President asked it directly: if he were to attempt restoration of the monarchy, could he count on loyal army units to secure Moscow for the duration of the self-coup?\n\nWrangel could not promise anything. He explained how, even if he agreed with the restoration, he would not consider it wise to restore it in such a way: it would only taint the monarchy in the eyes of the people. While the President had the power to command the army, a soldier had the duty to protect the Constitution. In this light, it seems unlikely that the military would support such a measure."

General Mikhail Konstantinovich Diterikhs arrived with a single adjutant, seemingly irritated at being requested under such an informal situation. He and the President shared a bottle as President Ivan Lukyanovich went straight to the point. If he, hypothetically speaking, wanted to impose martial law, dissolve the State Duma, and restore the monarchy, would he have loyal army units to back him?\n\nMikhail Diterikhs could hardly believe what he was hearing. He recognised the immense risk of such a project, not only due to Denikin but also because he did not believe that Wrangel and Drozdovsky would join the coup, as they had always avoided making the most difficult choices. Diterikhs - keenly aware of the possibility of it being a trap to lure him and the Circle of Saint George in - did not give a clear promise, but agreed to start making arrangements. If the Romanovs needed him, he was still oath-bound to serve them."

 rusfla.52.t: "The President's Coup"
 rusfla.52.d: "A chaotic series of events started in the early light today, as Igor Baftalovsky's Special Purpose Battalion, tasked with the security of the Kremlin, closed off the complex to 'protect the President', who swiftly declared a state of security and dissolved the State Duma until further notice. In a presidential radio address, Ivan Solonevich explained that a radical communist plot had been uncovered, and that all the necessary measures would be taken to ensure the security of Russia. To avoid widespread unrest, Moscow and Petrograd are now under martial law, and the President acts with dictatorial powers until the threat has been dealt with. At the same time, General Mikhail Diterikhs' division has moved to secure bridges and entry points to Moscow, effectively putting the city under siege.\n\nThe national response was dumbfounded but largely in the government's control, as all media outlets were controlled by it. Immediately, protests broke out, though the overall mood was rather confused, with a lack of information about what was happening. Immediately, judicial and gubernatorial appointments followed, as the President started to fill these institutions with people loyal to him personally, or Diterikhs' own loyalists from the Circle. The preparation began for convening the Constituent Assembly - and ideally forcing them to accept the monarchical constitution."
 rusfla.52.a: "The first step!"

 rusfla.53.t: "Solonevich's Gamble"
 rusfla.53.d: "There were multiple days of confusion, and then protests started in earnest. Some are being reminded of the situation in 1936, when Savinkov had consolidated power with similar antics. Many demanded the resignation of Solonevich, or at the very least the lifting of martial law. Protests in Moscow were kept in tight check by Diterikhs' forces. But this did not last.\n\nThe President of the Supreme Court, Nikolay Nikolayevich Polyansky, declared Solonevich's actions unconstitutional and demanded the immediate reconvening of the State Duma and the lifting of the state of security. Around a hundred opposition politicians - and even some from Solonevich's own party - had signed a declaration denouncing the President's actions and demanding his resignation. This massively inflated the protests, and the first blood was drawn when seven people died in an armed fight between a Stabs-Captain Battalion (a paramilitary composed of Solonevich's supporters) and protestors. As more fighting broke out, the threat of civil war began to be felt.\n\nFinally, the ultimate protector of the Constitution, the Russian Army, acted. General-Fieldmarshal Anton Denikin gave the President an ultimatum: he must submit to the decisions of the Supreme Court within 24 hours or the military would act to ensure lawfulness. With this ultimatum, Solonevich's coup was all but lost. General Diterikhs had assured him that the silent majority of monarchist officers would ensure that the army would remain neutral, but now this was an empty hope. The situation started to look like the failed Boldyrev Putsch of 1929."
 rusfla.53.a: "Savinkov had been a much better gambling man."

 rusfla.54.t: "The Humiliating End"
 rusfla.54.d: "Soon after Denikin's declaration, the coup started to melt away. Only a few stood loyal to Solonevich and Diterikhs as Denikin's 4th 'Iron' Division moved to Moscow. There was a minimal amount of fighting, and the only serious battle happened as the Stabs-Captain Battalion refused to surrender until they were shelled multiple times. President Solonevich was arrested by the military, and in the first session of the reconvened State Duma, swiftly impeached for treason against the Russian Democratic Federative Republic. Solonevich did not go gently, but used his last appearance in the State Duma for a fiery defence speech, meandering on about how his cause was just, even if his means were not.\n\nThe State Council launched an investigation into the coup attempt and were surprised to realise just how flimsy the operation had been. It seemed that the majority of the actual planners had belonged to General Diterikhs' Circle of St. George, who were swiftly arrested and the entire organisation was banned for its connection to the coup attempt. In fact, a pro-Solonevich press baron, Boris Suvorin, immediately published an exposé in 'Evening Times', portraying these events as machinations by Diterikhs himself, and the president as a hapless victim of manipulation whose genuine belief in the Russian monarchy was only abused in a hopeless gamble. Russian historiography will likely debate these events for decades to come, with some holding Solonevich as being solely responsible, and others supporting Suvorin's thesis."

 rusfla.55.d.szrs: "After the civil war, Russia had to come to terms with the bloody events. What could ever explain the levels of atrocities we committed against each other? Unsurprisingly, the Bolsheviks became vilified, and suddenly even most of the socialists were competing over who had opposed the Bolsheviks first, in an attempt to prove they were on the right side of history. Those preaching for leniency and national healing, like Vasily Maklakov and Viktor Chernov, were left a minority in the early 1920s, and the vindictive purge of anything communist left a dark stain on the Russian Republic's claim of legality and liberty.\n\nAfter many high-level communists such as Aleksey Rykov had served their sentences going into the 1930s, they joined with the Radical-Democratic Party. Despite President Maklakov's attempts to de-escalate the situation, the gulf between the left and right kept widening. SZRS Combat Squads assassinated communists in broad daylight, while underground socialist radicals tried to fight back. It was against the backdrop of this violence that the ascension of the SZRS would happen, culminating in Savinkov coming to power in 1934.\n\nHistory textbooks were amended to reflect 'White history' - that the Bolshevik uprising was not just an ordinary uprising. It was an international conspiracy, one which sought to destroy holy Russia and make sure it never rises again, responsible for funding the Bolshevik Party and supplying their uprising across central Russia, and were it not stopped by force of arms, it would have left Russia broken, destroyed and shattered. These textbooks make sure to note the fact that Vladimir Lenin had been sent to Petrograd by the Germans, and that many of the leading members of the Bolshevik Party were not Russian - but Caucasians, Balts, Poles, and especially Jews."
 rusfla.55.d.soc: "The defeat of the Bolsheviks in the Civil War left the socialists of Russia branded as traitors under the successive governments. From the moment of their defeat the socialists all pointed fingers at each other, looking to assign the blame. Mensheviks maintained that the entire revolution was an anarchic mistake from the start and that in backwards Russia only the programme of socialist opposition within a republican revolution was permissible. Left-Esers, anarchists and some Bolsheviks argued that the revolution itself was an event to be celebrated but that it had been distorted by the excesses of the Bolsheviks in power, by their betrayal of the peasantry, by the bloody Red Terror, or by their capitulation to the Germans at Brest-Litovsk. The most intransigent and stalwart among the Bolsheviks defended the revolution to the end, but condemned the betrayal of the Left-Esers and classes hostile to the proletariat, threatening one day to return the favour.\n\nIn this context the socialist movement found itself in shambles. Persecuted by the Whites, disunited, hopeless. Some attempted to adopt strict reformist stances in the Radical-Democratic Party. Some continued their desperate fight, defending people from the mobs of Svobodniks. There were many attempts to negotiate a Russian socialism that could unite the competing currents, and two main narratives arose: the resurgency of the Left-Esers as 'authentic Russian socialism', and the circle of socialists from the old RSDRP gathered around Vladimir Levitsky, defining 'Synthesis Communism'. Despite disagreeing on almost everything, they are in agreement on what matters: to form a lasting Soviet democracy that will not devolve into police terror and arbitrary violence."

These conspiracies were quickly scrubbed after a more sane regime returned to power, but a massive gulf remains between our views on the civil war. We must teach our history impartially - but always include a warning against communism there, to remind the Russian people to never repeat the bloodshed and tragedy of the revolution."

 rusfla.65.t: "Upwards, Kolchak's Falcons!"
 rusfla.65.d: "In a bid to demonstrate the capabilities of Russian aviation, a long-haul flight crew of Valerian Chkalov, Georgy Baydukov, and Aleksandr Belyakov have completed their trans-Russian flight from Moscow to the mouth of the Amur River in the Far East. The pilots' faces now decorate every newspaper in Russia, but much praise has also been given to the project's mastermind, Admiral Aleksandr Kolchak, and the aviation companies of Sikorsky and Tupolev.\n\nDespite being a thoroughbred mariner, Kolchak has emerged as one of the most energetic and lavish funders of Russia's air industry, seeing in aircraft not only another tool for Russia's defence, but also for his profound interest in exploring the North Pole. Kolchak has already promised that this flight is only the beginning, and that a Russian air crew can be expected along American shores by summer's end."
 rusfla.65.a: "Russian engineering is the best in the world!"

 rusfla.66.t: "On American Shores"
 rusfla.66.d.sad: "Now piloting a new Sikorsky floatplane rather than the single-engined Tupolev from their last flight, Chkalov and his crew have braved the perilous skies of the Arctic Circle in a marathon 60-hour flight. However, the flight crew did not receive the heroes' welcome they've grown accustomed to upon landing in the sparkling waters outside of San Francisco. US Coast Guards and Navy vessels descended upon the beleaguered aircraft, even as both the Russian crew and radio operators on the shore insistently broadcast their status as a civilian sporting craft.\n\nNewspapers across the globe have now printed photos of the smiling Chkalov, Baydukov, and Belyakov being manhandled onto an American destroyer, apparently unperturbed by this turn of events on their record-setting flight. The American Pacific Fleet and Government have both hastily issued apologies, but not before shifting blame for the miscommunication onto one another."
 rusfla.66.d.good: "Now piloting a new Sikorsky floatplane rather than the single-engined Tupolev from their last flight, Chkalov and his crew have braved the perilous skies of the Arctic Circle in a marathon 60-hour flight. No sooner had their aircraft touched down in the glittering waters of San Francisco harbour, before the beleaguered floatplane was swamped by a flotilla of boats, each packed with journalists hoping to snap a shot of the crew emerging from their Sikorsky.\n\nNewspaper readers across the globe have been treated to a group shot of Chkalov, Baydukov, and Belyakov, all smiles as they're offered another bottle of champagne from a nearby dinghy. The visit has already proven to be a coup for historically strong Russo-American relations, and orders are already flooding in for the latest Sikorsky floatplanes."
 rusfla.66.a: "Success!"

 rusfla.67.t: "The Hunt for Zemlya Sannikova"
 rusfla.67.d: "Aleksandr Kolchak had been a 25-year-old, fresh lieutenant when he met Baron Toll, an eccentric polar explorer, planning his third expedition to find the missing Arctic island - Sannikov Land. Von Toll claimed to have seen the mythical islands as part of his expedition that charted the New Siberian Islands in 1886, rising from the icy white horizon hundreds of miles to the north. The same island had also been reported by Fritdtjof Nansen's expedition. Something in this Baron's drive intrigued the young Kolchak, who was likewise interested in polar exploration - the final frontier of discovery left to the mankind of the modern age.\n\nIn 1900, Toll's expedition set sail in Saint-Petersburg. With the icebreaker Zarya, they started a three-year-long journey to the New Siberian Islands and beyond. But they could not locate Sannikov Land, and in the end, most of the expedition, including Kolchak, had to turn back. Von Toll, stubborn as ever, pushed forward, and it was the last that was seen of him.\n\nLieutenant Kolchak led a heroic but futile rescue expedition. His crew dared the polar winter for 7 months, but could only locate Toll's final hut and notes on Bennett Island, with little clue as to his ultimate fate. The Arctic winter had claimed him.\n\nKolchak continued his successful naval career as an explorer. He was the first one to chart Severnaya Zemlya, perhaps the last undiscovered archipelago on Earth. Empty spots on the Arctic map were rapidly disappearing with modern ice-breakers and exploration planes. Later additional mapping expeditions were organised, very often by Kolchak himself, who now enjoyed the resources of the Russian navy at his disposal. Ushakov Island was discovered in 1935, and it seemed like almost everything to be found had been found.\n\nBut Sannikov Land had eluded him. Had Toll been right? He had died for his belief that the land exists. And as years had passed, it had been subject to more and more speculation. The last undiscovered island of the Arctic that had beaten Kolchak so many times."
 rusfla.67.a: "We must know!"

 rusfla.68.t: "Kolchak's Last Expedition"
 rusfla.68.d: "On a cold spring morning, three ships, led by the great icebreaker Svyataya Sibir under Kolchak's command, embarked on their journey from Petrograd. The icebreakers were well-equipped - they even had one Polikarpov floatplane for scouting and emergencies.\n\nThe bravest and most gifted men of the Russian Navy and Academy of Sciences set sail to find the Land of Sannikov - or prove once and for all that it is merely Toll's phantom. Kolchak himself, pushing over 60 years old, is still as energetic as ever, though worried that it may be his last chance to brave the icy hells of the north.\n\nThe plan was clear. The fleet would sail around Scandinavia, refill at Murmansk, and continue through the Kara and Laptev Seas until they reached the New Siberian Islands and turned north - and map the seas north of the De Long Islands. That far north, the sea was permanently, frozen and the last parts of the journey would be taken by sled or by plane. An additional goal is to continue pushing east and map potential North-Eastern routes to America, the main economic benefit of the adventure."
 rusfla.68.a: "Good luck, admiral."

 rusfla.69.t: "Passing Severnaya Zemlya"
 rusfla.69.d: "'I have seen the God-forsaken Chukotka Peninsula, the blizzard-ridden Wrangel Island, twice visited the fog-enshrouded Novaya Zemlya, and I have seen Franz Josef Land with its enamel sky and proud cliffs garbed in blue, its hardened glacial streams, but nowhere have I witnessed such grimness or such depressing, lifeless relief as Severnaya Zemlya's.'\nWith these words, geologist Georgy Ushakov described the 'Northern Land'. Together with Admiral Kolchak, they had mapped the archipelago in the 1920s.\n\nSvyataya Sibir's small flotilla passed the strait between February Revolution Island and Narodnik Islands. The glacier was endless on both sides. A bit further north was the Admiral Island, actually second island in the region to be named after Admiral Kolchak. The Kolchak Island proper was dicovered by the Toll Expedition in 1901. Within the archipelago there also lay Belovy (White) Island and Alekseyev Island. \n\nPoor weather conditions had forced the expedition to pass time in the Kara Sea, but it seemed like they could still get to the New Siberian Islands before it would be too late to explore the north. Up in the cold underworld of the Earth, it is always a contest against time."
 rusfla.69.a: "Truly the most depressing place in all of Siberia."

 rusfla.70.t: "Distress in the Laptev Sea"
 rusfla.70.d: "Sadko, the second ship of the flotilla, captured a distress call from a convoy to the south. It had been led by the older icebreaker Budimirovich, but they had been imprisoned by pack ice brought on by unfortunate currents and harsh Arctic weather. There seem to be at least four ships in distress. They lack food stockpiles to wait the months it would take for another rescue party to arrive. Our ships would be beefy enough to easily help them - after all, Svyataya Sibir represents the most modern of Russian shipbuilding. However, this would cost us precious time.\n\nMaybe it would be enough to send them Sadko, or Sadko and Sedov, and push on with Svyataya Sibir. Leaving them there is not an option - the naval law defines a responsibility to help ships in distress if it is possible. The Supreme Admiral of the Navy would not be caught committing such a dishonourable crime."
 rusfla.70.a: "Divert the expedition there, and let's get it done fast."
 rusfla.70.b: "Send them help, but push on with Sibir."

 rusfla.71.t: "Parting of the Expedition"
 rusfla.71.d: "With heavy hearts, the crews of Svyataya Sibir said their farewells to their comrades on board Sadko and Sedov, which turned south to save sailors with worse luck than Kolchak's own had. The moment reminded Kolchak of that fateful day when he had parted with Toll's expedition, while the Baron had continued alone towards Sannikov Land - the last time the two had seen each other.\n\nBut it had to be done - saving men from that icy hell was the duty of a proper sailor. The two others disappeared to the south as Kolchak pushed further east. The summer in the Arctic was here, and the northern ice would be at its weakest."
 rusfla.71.a: "Push onwards!"

 rusfla.72.t: "End of the Road"
 rusfla.72.d: "Weeks dragged along as nightless nights followed one another as the pride of Russian icebreakers smashed its way further east. Finally, they came to the Sannikov Strait, which separated the New Siberian Islands, with the intent to turn north-east. Once, as a young man, Kolchak had crossed the strait on a whaleboat - an icebreaker should make the quest trivial. Somewhere beyond the De Long Islands - the final resting place of Toll - lay Zemlya Sannikova, if it exists.\n\nThen problems started. As the voyage had taken longer than planned, the ice after Novaya Sibir was increasingly strong, and caused problems even for Svyataya Sibir's steel plates and diesel engines. It quickly dawned on the crew that sailing north would be impossible with only one icebreaker - especially as the pack ice slowly turned into permanent ice the further north they went, and they needed to travel at least 200 miles north from Kotelny Island to confirm the location of Sannikov Land - and if they did not do it fast, polar night would engulf them all and make exploration impossible.\n\nThe icebreaker was not enough. But there were two options. They could take the Polikarpov and fly north - a dangerous proposal in itself. However, the plane quite probably would not have fuel for the return journey, so they would have to land possibly on Bennett Island and wait for a rescue, or make their way over ice back to Kotelny. The other option would be to travel on ice. They had dogs and sleds with them, and even Kolchak's Yakut colleagues who had been with him on the Novaya Zemlya expedition. They could do like Amundsen and cross the ice from Kotelny to the north, all the way up to Zemlya Sannikova and back - but, of course, this was an even more physically demanding, if more reliable, method."
 rusfla.72.a: "Take the plane."
 rusfla.72.b: "Take the sled."

 rusfla.73.t: "To Sannikov With Siberian Huskies"
 rusfla.73.d: "Despite his age, Kolchak could not allow himself to be left behind. He left the ship under the command of Ushakov and would lead the sled expedition himself. Even with only a handful of men - they had no supplies for more - and plenty of dogs, they were running against time, as polar night would be there soon.\n\nThey would need to travel around two hundred kilometres north, taking measurements of their position as they went. They were so far north that the sea ice became part of the polar ice cap, and the experience would be more akin to travelling in Greenland or Antarctica than normal sea ice. The theory was that Sannikov Land was an island under this ice cap, and only its highest peaks were visible in good weather. Ornithologists knew that birds migrated there every year, which was further proof of the existence of the land.\n\nThe temperature was a moderate -37 degrees Celsius as Kolchak's dog sled embarked north, while the Svyataya Sibir would remain there, waiting for them. The Polikarpov could mount a rescue mission, if needed."
 rusfla.73.a: "To the north!"

 rusfla.74.t: "The Polar Mania"
 rusfla.74.d: "Polar mania, it was called - the almost mystical attraction that these lifeless wastelands had for young naval officers at the turn of the century. What burned in the old admiral had to be the last sparks of this mania from his youth, as he skied alongside his younger comrades with little issue. Days and days they went, making impromptu ice shelters and marking their path. Days grew shorter and winds colder.\n\nWith good weather, it was almost as if there was land up front, far away. Some claimed that Sannikov Land was only a polar mirage, mirroring Bennett Island against the northern horizon. But they were too close to believe such theories now.\n\nBut as kilometres passed, it became clearer and clearer. There was no land ahead. Only eternal ice, which had not melted since the ancient ages of the planet. They took measurements again and again, during the few hours of daylight the sky gave them, but it did not change the facts. If there was a Sannikov Land, they would see it by now."
 rusfla.74.a: "It must be there!"
 rusfla.74.b: "What a disappointment."
 RUS_polar_tt: "It may take some time until you hear from Kolchak again."

 rusfla.75.t: "The Fate of Admiral Kolchak"
 rusfla.75.d1: "After a lengthy search, an air force bomber was finally able to locate the last shelter of Admiral Kolchak, who disappeared on his Zemlya Sannikova Expedition last year. Based on their log books, the group had decided to push forwards, unwilling to accept the possibility of the island's non-existence.\n\nAs part of the flights to locate the admiral, measurements have been taken with such accuracy that it can be said with certainty that there does not lie new land behind the De Long Islands. Sannikov Land has either never existed, or it has disappeared under polar ice decades ago.\n\nRemains of the admiral and his heroic companions have been brought home from their icy grave, and Kolchak will receive a state funeral. It is a tragic day for the entire Russian nation, but perhaps there is poetry in it - after the death of the greatest Russian polar explorer, there is no more Russian Arctic left to explore."
 rusfla.75.d2: "After a lengthy search, an air force bomber was finally able to locate the last shelter of Admiral Kolchak, who disappeared on his Zemlya Sannikova Expedition last year. Based on the wreckage, Kolchak's plane went down in a polar storm after he had taken great risks in flying this late in the year with an insufficiently light aeroplane.\n\nAs part of the flights to locate the admiral, measurements have been taken with such accuracy that it can be said with certainty that there does not lie new land behind the De Long Islands. Sannikov Land has either never existed, or it has disappeared under polar ice decades ago.\n\nRemains of the admiral and his heroic companions have been brought home from their icy grave, and Kolchak will receive a state funeral. It is a tragic day for the entire Russian nation, but perhaps there is poetry in it - after the death of the greatest Russian polar explorer, there is no more Russian Arctic left to explore."
 rusfla.75.d3: "After a lengthy search, an air force bomber was finally able to locate the last shelter of Admiral Kolchak, who disappeared on his Zemlya Sannikova Expedition last year. Based on the remains, Kolchak had scouted Sannikov Land via plane, was forced to crash-land and then tried to get to Bennett Island on foot, but died of hypothermia before he could reach the island.\n\nAs part of the flights to locate the admiral, measurements have been taken with such accuracy that it can be said with certainty that there does not lie new land behind the De Long Islands. Sannikov Land has either never existed, or it has disappeared under polar ice decades ago.\n\nRemains of the admiral and his heroic companions have been brought home from their icy grave, and Kolchak will receive a state funeral. It is a tragic day for the entire Russian nation, but perhaps there is poetry in it - after the death of the greatest Russian polar explorer, there is no more Russian Arctic left to explore."
 rusfla.75.a: "Rest in peace."

 rusfla.76.t: "The Return From Nowhere"
 rusfla.76.d: "The return from the non-existent Sannikov Land was just in time. Kolchak's group got to Bennett Island before the worst part of the winter descended on them, making it impossible to travel. So there they were, besieged by the harshest winter on the planet, on an island where Baron Toll had spent his final months. There was poetry to it, how Kolchak was now in the same position as his mentor. However, he was dedicated to surviving.\n\nWith hunting and very careful use of coal and oil reserves, the men were able to weather the entire biting winter on the godforsaken rock in the middle of the De Long Islands. When they could, they mapped nearby islands and took geological samples - anything to make the journey scientifically valuable, to cope with the bitterness over Sannikov Land.\n\nBy the first months of spring, they set to travel once again. This time much slower, as they had had to eat many of their dogs during the winter - but then again, they also had remarkably fewer resources with them. They skied to Novaya Sibir before the ice there became treacherous, and met up with Ushakov and their trusty Svyataya Sibir, which had been wintering at the coast of Yakutia.\n\nAt home, the admiral received a hero's welcome. He may not have found Zemlya Sannikova, but he did fill out the last empty spot on the map of the Russian Arctic - even if he filled it with emptiness."
 rusfla.76.a: "Congratulations, Admiral!"

 rusfla.77.t: "The Sannikov Flyover"
 rusfla.77.d: "The Polikarpov seaplane took off from Kotelny's icy surface and headed north, with only the daredevil pilot Valerian Chkalov, Admiral Kolchak himself, and his science officer Vladimir Vize on board. They had already delayed the flight by a few days, as the weather was increasingly bad, but as winter was coming, they had to take their chance before it was too late.\n\nTwo hundred kilometres north of the De Long Islands were easy to achieve with a plane - a luxury that Toll did not have. It dawned on the explorers rather quickly that Sannikov Land did not seem to exist - no matter how far north they flew, they saw only an endless amount of polar ice. There was theorising that if the island had existed, it would now be under the polar ice - and would probably remain so unless some glacial movement revealed it again.\n\nAs they were turning back, catastrophe struck. Strong polar wind caught the Polikarpov, and they were forced to land on ice, or risk crashing entirely. Without sleds and dogs, losing the plane there would be equal to a death sentence. But the landing did not help them - the winter storms continued, and winds remained too strong. A distress call was sent and an ice shelter was built, but they knew rescue was impossible before spring - after all, if the weather was too bad for them to take off, it would be the same for any rescuer. But they did not have food for wintering - planes had been flying with minimum stockpiles to maximise their flight time. Neither did they have fuel to stay warm, except the plane's kerosene. The nearest land was some hundred kilometres south, Bennett Island."
 rusfla.77.a: "Get the plane in the air, it is the only chance."
 rusfla.77.b: "Dismantle the plane for equipment and push for Bennett."

 rusfla.78.t: "The Miraculous Survival From Sannikov Land"
 rusfla.78.d: "Against all odds, the sturdy plane of the polar explorers managed to take off on a somewhat calmer day. Despite the polar winds trying to crush it against the ice, pilot Chkalov was able to manoeuvre the plane to the south for a hundred kilometres before they ran out of kerosene and had to crash-land some 40 kilometres north of the Anzhu Islands. What followed was Admiral Kolchak's own three-man Ice March to the New Siberian Islands without dogs or sleds. They had little food and hoped that they could alert help if they reached Kotelny Island.\n\nBy chance, Svyataya Sibir still had not left to the south to winter, as Georgy Ushakov had wanted to delay its departure, with hopes that Kolchak might have survived. They spotted a shot from a flare gun from Kotelny's barren glacier one night, and all hopes on board were rekindled. Hastily, a rescue expedition was organised, which crossed the island against the horrible darkness of the polar night. They found Kolchak, Chkalov, and Vize in an icy shelter they had built, too weak to travel anymore. The trio had run out of food days ago, and had been without enough fuel to keep themselves warm. The admiral had almost given up when the rescuers arrived.\n\nHe had escaped Toll's fate and charted the last remaining corner of the Russian Arctic."
 rusfla.78.a: "Truly a legendary story."

 rusfla.79.t: "The Laptev Rescue"
 rusfla.79.d: "Dutiful as ever, the old admiral ordered a change of course. His icebreakers eventually found Budimirovich's convoy hounded by the pack ice. They had been delivering coal and other supplies to the Yakut towns of the coastline, but drifted off course and had become trapped. With the collective efforts of three modern ice-breakers, Kolchak's ships could free the sailors rather easily, and hundreds of men were saved.\n\nBut it had taken many precious weeks off their timetable. Svyataya Sibir, Sadko, and Sadov hurried to the east, hoping to arrive in the New Siberian Islands before winter, but it seemed rather hopeless. They could winter on the Siberian coast and wait for the next spring - it would be the safest option - but some argued that they could still complete their original mission. Chief among them was Georgy Ushakov, a young and bold explorer, who proposed that Kolchak shouldn't go to the New Siberian Islands, but set course to the northeast immediately, and approach Sannikov Land from the southwest. It was an unsure plan but could work - depending on the actual location of Zemlya Sannikova."
 rusfla.79.a: "Go with Ushakov's plan."
 rusfla.79.b: "Winter at Logashkino and try again next year."

 rusfla.80.t: "Successful Sannikov Expedition"
 rusfla.80.d: "The three ships stayed the winter at the small trading settlement of Logashkino. The ships had ample provisions and modern facilities, so it was actually the least rough wintering Kolchak had spent in the Arctic. The ships were able to respond to a number of other distress calls and conduct various smaller scientific projects around the Laptev Strait before the winter finally closed them to the coast.\n\nBut after a long and dark Siberian winter, they were in prime position to travel north, to solve the mystery of Sannikov Land once and for all. The ships turned northwest after Novaya Sibir, where pack ice started to turn into ice caps. With the strength of the three ice-breakers, they could still advance up to the De Long Islands and set up a temporary base on Bennett Island. There they could mount sled expeditions to the north during the brief Arctic summer.\n\nKolchak led the expedition personally - he was still an able skier. Seven men and a good number of dogs and sleds set for the north, towards Sannikov Land... though the preliminary scouting flights with their Polikarpov had already cast a doubt on the existence of the land. Perhaps it was true that the island was a mere polar mirage, a mirror image created by air and ice? Or that it had once existed, but polar ice had swallowed it decades ago?\n\nWhatever it was, Zemlya Sannikova did not exist. They had ample time to take the coordinates and measurements. There was nothing but glaciers as far as one could go.\n\nThey spent the remainder of the summer conducting various geological and marine surveys in the area, and gathered as much scientific information as possible, before they pushed east for Vladivostok, to map some final parts of the Northern Passage. Admiral Kolchak had conquered the Arctic."
 rusfla.80.a: "Congratulations, everyone!"

 rusfla.81.t: "The Great Ice Drift"
 rusfla.81.d: "Ushakov's plan had underestimated the extreme conditions this far north. Initially, progress was smooth, but eventually around Belkovsky Island, the ice became so thick only Svyataya Sibir could push through it. Soon, she started having problems. The worst-case scenario happened - three ships were stuck on pack ice, some hundred kilometres from the nearest island.\n\nKolchak's fleet started to prepare for wintering at sea. The ships were not in danger of being crushed; they were bulky enough to withstand that. Soon Svyataya Sibir, Sadko, and Sadov were turned into a floating city of metal, with over 200 people on board. The engines were shut down and small villages arose on the decks of the ships. A message was sent to the air force command, which started to evacuate people from the ships whenever the weather allowed it.\n\nThe silver lining was that they had come so close to the New Siberian Islands, and the pack ice was moving them northwards in such a way that they drifted close enough to the purported location of Zemlya Sannikova to prove its non-existence. During over 300 kilometres of northward drifting, the scientific crews mapped everything they could about the ice conditions and their coordinate locations. Around 180 of the total crews of 221 had been evacuated by air before the winter storms began, making further evacuations impossible. Kolchak insisted on staying on board of Svyataya Sibir, promising to bring her home along with their research data."
 rusfla.81.a: "Good luck, Admiral!"

 rusfla.82.t: "Kolchak's Return"
 rusfla.82.d: "The ice drift had continued the entire winter, and pushed three ships past Svalbard, towards the Atlantic Ocean. They had occasionally been supplied through air, though all ships were low on coal due to the crew wintering there. Sadko's rudder had been broken by the ice, and eventually it was decided to move all the coal and equipment aboard Svyataya Sibir, which would try to push through the ice. It seemed like a possible option, as they had drifted south enough for the ice to be more malleable.\n\nIn Russia, news of 'Kolchak's Great Ice Drift' was widely publicised long before the admiral could return. In April, Svyataya Sibir finally broke through and towed the other two ships to Svalbard, where it could resupply and head for Petrograd after having drifted in pack ice through the entire Arctic. But the ship had been sturdy enough to withstand it, and crewed by bold enough sailors and scientists - all of whom received a hero's welcome in Petrograd when they arrived. Sannikov Land might not exist, but Kolchak's last polar adventure was still able to surpass the ones before it."
 rusfla.82.a: "What a legendary story!"

 rusfla.83.t: "Joint Declaration for Democracy"
 rusfla.83.d: "It would be foolish for anyone now to deny the Russian successes in the war. Seemingly taking advantage of Russian victories on the battlefield, our brothers in Serbia have now taken up arms against the Reichspakt, and pledged to fight alongside us.\n\nThe Russo-Serbian alliance has been longstanding, one based on our shared Slavic heritage, Orthodox beliefs, and mutual dislike for Austro-German imperialism. But now, there is another factor at play that binds us together: our belief in liberty and democracy.\n\n[RUS_leader] [RUS.GetLeader] announced Serbia's declaration and the renewal of the wartime alliance over the radio, where he carefully lauded the historical bonds between the two countries. But in particular, he took the opportunity to highlight the great mission the two have:\n\n'Our goal now, as it always has been, is to secure the principles of liberty and justice in Europe as well as the world, against selfish and imperialist powers that seek to destroy these principles. In the face of their oppressors, the Russian and Serbian nations unchained their shackles so that democracy could be attained in the eyes of their people. We seek true peace - not the peace that those autocratic governments cannot be trusted to keep or maintain. That peace can only be maintained by a concert of democratic nations, and it is the noble cause which we, the peoples of Russia and Serbia, fight for together.'"
 rusfla.83.a: "Our cause is just!"

 rusfla.84.t: "Exercises of the Kursk Military District"
 rusfla.84.d: "The army high command has proposed arranging a massive military exercise in Kursk in the coming months. The purpose of the manoeuvres would be to test the Russian Army's capacity to wage a combined arms offensive utilising all the most modern weapon systems, on a scale larger than previous exercises have been able to do.\n\nWhile the military side is obviously left to the generals, we can propose changes to their plans. The current draft, largely written by General-Fieldmarshal Markov's staff, is relatively conservative in size, but if we wished to make a great impression on foreign powers, we could easily double the amount of armour and planes. Should we wish to avoid further escalation of tensions with Germany, we could tone the exercise down, and keep it further away from the Ukrainian border, though the military would not like cutting costs in this way."
 rusfla.84.a: "Trust the professionals here."
 rusfla.84.b: "Time to send a message of Russian strength!"
 rusfla.84.c: "Tone it down."

 rusfla.85.t: "The Question of Foreign Observers"
 rusfla.85.d: "Traditionally, foreign observers are invited to observe large military exercises. This is both a means to show off our military prowess and to involve our allies, allowing them to potentially learn military lessons. The military wishes to keep the manoeuvres without too much in the way of foreign observation and is mostly willing to allow our minor allies to take part.\n\nHowever, it has been suggested by the Foreign Ministry to invite a delegate from France or Britain - after all, we do share a common enemy. We could also instead invite their exile counterparts as less harmful observers, who could still relay the message of Russian greatness to the world at large."
 rusfla.85.a: "Keep it small."
 rusfla.85.b: "Extend the invitation to the socialists."
 rusfla.85.c: "Invite the exiles."

 rusfla.86.t: "Invitation to Russia"
 rusfla.86.d: "[RUS.GetNameDef] has offered us a chance to send our military observers to follow the coming large military exercise meant to showcase Russia's growing military-industrial power.\n\nWhile we will not learn any great secrets, it could give us insights into their military capabilities, and even offer some lessons we could learn from."
 rusfla.86.a: "Send observers."
 rusfla.86.b: "Meh."

 rusfla.87.t: "[FROM.GetName] Refuses"
 rusfla.87.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] Foreign Ministry responded to our gracious invitation to take part in the military exercises with a no."
 rusfla.87.a: "Alright then."

 rusfla.88.t1: "Underwhelming Kursk Exercises"
 rusfla.88.t2: "Russian War-Machine at Kursk Manoeuvres"
 rusfla.88.t3: "Massive Russian Military Exercise at Kursk"
 rusfla.88.d1: "The exercise of the Kursk Military District had been downscaled from the initial suggestion by the army. The core of the exercise remained good - elements of the 3rd Mechanised Division, the 7th Motorised Division and the 1st Don Cavalry Division under the command of General-Lieutenant Aleksandr Vasilevsky created a breakthrough in good interplay with the artillery and the air force against superior forces. However, the originally planned counter-attack and exploitation phase had been cut out, and in general the exercise could only represent a small regional penetration, rather than an operational breakthrough as was the original intent.\n\nForeign observers no doubt noted the downscaling, though some of them were still rather impressed by the quantity and quality of Russia's armoured forces. Perhaps, as was planned, the small scale ensured that no one could know how serious a military threat this new Russia could be."
 rusfla.88.d2: "The exercise of the Kursk Military District could be described as a well-oiled machine. It is clear that the planners under General-Fieldmarshal Markov had a good touch in combined arms warfare. The 3rd Mechanised Division, the 7th Motorised Division and the 1st Don Cavalry Division under General-Lieutenant Aleksandr Vasilevsky created a wide breakthrough in a much larger enemy force commanded by General Vladimir Vitkovsky, utilising large amounts of attack planes and bombardment. The attackers successfully repelled a counter-attack by the 32nd 'Steel' Infantry Division and expanded the breakthrough in depth.\n\nDespite a small amount of problems, the exercises impressed foreign observers. Some noted that the moves felt too 'trained' and not spontaneous enough, but had to admit that coordination between the air force, the armoured column and the infantry was still impressive, and that the amount and quality of Russian armour was respectable. In addition, proximity to the Ukrainian border made the exercise's political message clear. As the news circulated among the world's general staffs, the most common point of discussion in officer cafés became the new, modernised Russian Army."
 rusfla.88.d3: "The exercise of the Kursk Military District was first and foremost about sending a message. The scale was tremendous - over 65 thousand men, one thousand tanks, 500 planes, 300 heavy guns... the truly megalomaniac military exercises could simulate a relatively large section of the frontline near the Ukrainian border in a potential future war. The 2nd Mechanised Corps under General Boris Shteyfon showed great cooperation between the armour, infantry, artillery and air force as they smashed through General Pavel Shatilov's infantry front, repelled the counter-attack of General-Lieutenant Aleksandr Vasilevsky's armour and continued to exploit the breakthrough in depth.\n\nWhile the scale and skill of the central units was impressive to the observers, they also noticed how the vast scale and hasty preparation of some sections of the exercise led to chaos in some units. Despite this 'Russian messiness' in the edges of the operation, and the general inflexibility of some units, the message was clear: Russia was capable of fighting a modern industrial war, and excelling at it. In addition, proximity to the Ukrainian border made the exercise's political message clear. As the news circulated among the world's general staffs, the most common point of discussion in officer cafés became the new, modernised Russian Army."

 rusfla.99.d: "As our tanks roll west across the Ukrainian plains, the mood all across Russia can best be described in one word: lost. Years of anti-German propaganda have not shaken the regrettable fact that Russia and Ukraine, once brotherly peoples, are at war. Indeed, much of the older generation remembers that only some twenty years ago, Russians and Ukrainians fought with each other to defend the nation against German imperialism.\n\nIt is not helped by the fact that the Ukrainian republic is not unlike our own. Both were reborn out of aspirations for freedom and democracy, a fact that speaks to the similarities of the Russian and Ukrainian nations. It makes it all the more painful that tens of thousands of lives, on both sides, have already been lost in what feels more like a pointless civil war than a heroic battle against an oppressor.\n\nWhile Russian news outlets have claimed the defections of thousands of Ukrainians to our side, furthering the narrative that the Ukrainian leadership in Kiev is out of touch and answers only to Berlin, the reality on the ground is much different. Notwithstanding the German armed forces, the Ukrainian People's Army is already showing that it is a force to be reckoned with. The president's calls for an end to the war and for Ukrainians to resist German imperialism, noble as they may be, have largely fallen on deaf ears.\n\nLike the last war in Europe, this one is a tragedy. An unavoidable, necessary tragedy, but a tragedy nonetheless."
 rusfla.99.a: "Still, we will complete our mission no matter how painful."

 rusfla.100.t: "Nationalist Coup in Kiev"
 rusfla.100.d: "For two decades, Ukraine has been the domain of Hetman Pavlo Skoropadskyi and his Ukrainian State. The ex-Tsarist officer has spent much of this time fighting popular unrest, yet whenever it looked like the weight of rebellion would prove too much to bear, the Hetmanate would always find a way to lurch on. When anti-Hetman forces failed to dislodge him in 1936, many gave up hope that anything could - and others still wished that the German puppet may yet meet his match.\n\nThey should've been more careful with what they wished for.\n\nIndeed, the Hetman has finally fallen - but his defeat came from within, not from without. Though there were many conspirators taking part in the coup against the Hetman's government, the ringleaders shared uncompromising, radical, and totalitarian ideas - and more importantly, their hatred of anything Russian. Upon taking power, the LUN-dominated government immediately reached out to Berlin to confirm many of the treaties that had been signed under the old Hetman's regime, firmly securing Ukraine in the German sphere.\n\nIt was not long until the putschists began their so-called 'National Revolution'; along with further efforts to centralise the state around [202.GetName], restricting use of the Russian language and anything resembling Russian culture. Some even called for immediate mass mobilisation to put down the 'Russian menace' for good and to take what they see as 'rightfully Ukrainian' territories, stretching from Rostov to Astrakhan.\n\nIt is hard to grasp how great of a threat this new government is, but it only serves to reinforce a fact we have known for decades now: Berlin will never care for the plight of the Ukrainian people. To the Prussian butchers and militarists, Ukraine can only serve as a gun pointed at Russia - governments come and go, but the point remains all the same."
 rusfla.100.a: "The motherland cannot be kept away forever..."

 rusfla.101.t: "Exile of the Russian Union"
 rusfla.101.d: "Since the nationalist putsch in Kiev, minority organisations of all stripes have been dispersed by the state. Russian organisations in Ukraine were declared illegal, and the most prominent among them, the 'Russian Union in Ukraine', fled across the border to ensure the safety of its members. One of the longest-active non-governmental organisations operating since the founding of the Ukrainian state, the Russian Union had an elaborate relationship with state structures under the Hetmanate, where it defended the rights of Russian speakers and of the Russian language in education.\n\nBut with the Hetmanate's fall, this relationship evaporated as the new Ukrainian government seeks to completely wipe out education in the Russian language. The leader of the Russian Union, a certain Dmitri Odinyets, came to Moscow to testify about the wide-ranging abuses the Ukrainian government has carried out against the Russian-speaking population. A cooperative relationship between the Russian government and the Russian Union has since formed - the Russian government has often sought to appoint itself as the protector of Ukrainian Russophones for many years now, and increasingly tense relations between Moscow and the German bloc have ensured that the Russian Union's plight has found an audience among the Russian public and their government.\n\nThe Union's policy suggestions have been heeded, as pamphlets drop in southern and eastern Ukraine swearing that even from exile, the Russian Union will continue to fight for Russian speakers in Ukraine. One day, the whole nation shall be liberated from the oppressive tyranny of the ethnonationalists and their Prussian backers."
 rusfla.101.a: "Are they not our countrymen, as well?"

 rusfla.102.t: "The Assassination of Dmitri Odinyets"
 rusfla.102.d: "The leader of the Russian Union in Ukraine, Dmitri Odinyets, was assassinated today in his home in Petrograd. This terrorist act was reported by another member of the Russian Union, General Vasily Bikupski, who visited only a couple of hours after the incident. Normally, such an occurrence would not be news that would make significant headlines, but in the circumstances that Russia has found itself in as of late, the assassination has become a national story.\n\nIt is not truly a matter of who Dmitri Odinyets was - though his testimonies in Moscow about Ukrainian atrocities have gained him some fame, he would not necessarily be recognisable to the average Russian. The story's prominence, rather, is owed to the culprit. The lack of direct evidence is irrelevant, as there is only one group that could have had the motive to kill Odinyets. Whether operating under Kiev's orders or acting as lone wolves, the obvious culprit is an agent - or agents - of the League of Ukrainian Nationalists. Previously, the LUN's Ukrainian government had mostly targeted Russians within their own borders, and their violent promises of 'taking back territory that is rightfully Ukrainian' were mostly seen as a bluff intended to frighten Russians into submission.\n\nWith this brazen act against all Russians, there is no longer any doubt that whatever they promised to do to Russia before, they will act on it sooner or later. Not long after the news broke, [RUS.GetLeader] addressed the papers and condemned the assassination in the strongest terms, pledging that Odinyets' murderers will face justice no matter where they may hide. For his part, Ukrainian foreign minister Yurii Lypa denied the Ukrainian government's ties to the assailants, but stopped short of condemning the attack, instead blaming Odinyets' 'known criminal associations' for the murder."
 rusfla.102.a: "Criminals? Is THAT what we're calling them?!"

 rusfla.103.t: "The Ultimatum"
 rusfla.103.d: "Whether or not the assassination of Dimitri Odinyets was ordered by the Ukrainian government, the situation between Russia and Ukraine is clearly intolerable. With each day, Kiev continues to terrorise our brethren with anti-Russian propaganda, assassinations, and all other barbaric and destructive means. As long as they may do so unchallenged, Russians cannot be safe - and as long as they enjoy the patronage of the Germans, Kiev will only continue to threaten our people. We have long prepared for war against the Germanic hegemony, and a preemptive strike now seems to be the only option to ensure the security of Russia and its people.\n\nThe Russian ambassador in Berlin has relayed to Germany an ultimatum directly from the Russian government: friendly relations between Germany and Russia cannot be taken for granted. Should they continue to sponsor terrorism against Russia through their client state in the east, Russia will have no choice but to put down these terrorist acts by force.\n\nAn alternative was presented - Germany must withdraw its troops from the territories unjustly taken from Russia in the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, and allow the peoples of Eastern Europe to reunify with their historical homeland of Russia, should they wish to do so.\n\nNaturally, these demands were refused."
 rusfla.103.a: "As expected."

 rusfla.104.t: "Black, White, and Red"
 rusfla.104.d: "It did not take long for the news to reach us, but over in Berlin, the term of Reichskanzler Schleicher is over. In its stead, a range of German conservatives from across the spectrum now controls the Reichstag. The vitally important foreign office has been taken up by Ulrich von Hassell, a diplomat leading the far-right DVLP - one of the most important ministerial shake-ups, and likely the only thing out of this ordeal that matters to us.\n\nOne would expect that Hassell, like much of the German right, is a nutcase hell-bent only on further expanding their country's hegemony over Europe. But upon taking power, the once virulent Russophobia that dominated the German political scene ever since the election of Savinkov and the Lake Lubahn Crisis has been redirected towards the syndicalist bloc, who Hassell claims is actively leading a crusade against tradition and order in Europe. As for us, Hassell has spoken of Russia as an inalienable part of European civilisation, emphasising the syndicalists as the greatest threat to it.\n\nAnd yet, despite his preference for Moscow over the Internationale on the European stage, it remains just talk. Truthfully, despite the presence of a seemingly respectable and professional diplomatic leader in Berlin, can one really predict that much will change in the following years? Reasonable or not, Hassell is still a devotee of the German world order, and it is unlikely that the German Foreign Office will ever host anyone truly wanting to make friends with Russia.\n\nOne could perhaps imagine a world where the Germans, seeing reason, would withdraw from Eastern Europe and cooperate with us against the Internationale, for the good of the continent as a whole. The German operating procedure remains unwavering in its anti-Russian stance; within the bureaucratic confines of the country, that stance will remain unaltered. Thus, as expected, any significant shifts in Russo-German relations are unforeseeable. Such facts confirm the undeniable: there is no reasoning with the Germans. We will come to blows one day or another."
 rusfla.104.a: "We need not comment on this."

 rusfla.105.t: "Once Upon a January"
 rusfla.105.d: "1st of January, 1929. Leonid Kotelnikov's 105th Petrograd Regiment spearheads into Moscow under General Vasily Boldyrev's orders in an event that would be known as the New Year's Putsch. The goal of the putschists was nothing less than saving Russian democracy.\n\nIt had been a rough year for the republic. The indecisive president Avksentyev was elected into office amidst mass protests and rising political violence in the aftermath of the disastrous 1928 Fengtian Conflict. The SZRS' number of seats in parliament doubled, quickly becoming the third-largest party, and becoming increasingly popular among junior officers and servicemen in the army. Boldyrev, arguably the only genuine democrat among the White generals, had gathered a clique of like-minded young officers and felt pressure to act.\n\nHis assessment was that, as the SZRS' power grows, there would be a tipping point where General Kornilov and the rest of the army will rather side with them out of duty and the wish to maintain stability, rather than oppose them. The civilian government seemed unwilling to take risks, and there was little hope for them to turn the tide. Thus, the military must fulfil its duty to guarantee the constitution of the Russian Republic. The Boldyrevites would take control of Moscow, arrest Savinkov and ensure that the SZRS' mobs are kept in check, all as if these had been Kornilov's orders. The government would restore order, and Kornilov would reprimand the putschists, but ultimately legitimise these actions. Savinkov would be put on trial, with his organisation defanged. And so, democracy would be saved.\n\nBut an unfortunate chance caused the coup to be revealed early in the morning. Savinkov, paranoid as ever, got away by an inch of his life, and his supporters raised public uproar. The coup fell apart in chaos despite Boldyrev's last-ditch attempt to win public support. In an ironic twist of fate, he did achieve one of his goals, as the military began to purge Savinkov's followers from their ranks. Still, at the same time, an enraged Kornilov also sacked Boldyrev and other progressive-minded officers, as well as any other soldier who dared to 'meddle in politics'. Perhaps the coup bought Russian democracy a few years - perhaps not."

In order to increase the efficiency of production and reduce the costs, one option would be to provide more fodder for the animals. To achieve that, there needs to be a plant that produces significant amounts of biomass in a short amount of time, and one such plant was recently found.\n\nA group of Russian botanists, while carrying out an inventory of local Georgian flora, stumbled upon a recently described plant. Heracleum sosnovskyi, also known as Sosnovsky's hogweed, is a plant described in 1936 by Ida Mandenova in honour of her co-worker, Dmitrii Ivanovich Sosnovsky. The plant grew rapidly, achieving colossal sizes. The scientists also noted how local cattle fed on the plant. As their research drew to a close, they brought a couple of seeds with them to investigate them further. Soon after, the group caught the attention of the Agriculture Ministry, which quickly initiated the first plantations of Sosnovsky's hogweed, not only for fodder purposes, but also honey production.

 rusfla.107.d: "Funded by the Fifth Department of the General Chief of Staff of the War Ministry, and written by General Pyotr Glazenap, a new report has been released. Its aim: to educate the Duma on the long-term goals and plans of the Kurt von Schleicher chancellorship, and make recommendations based on those findings.\n\nEven for the hated Germans, the intelligence on the Schleicher regime paints a potentially grim and shocking future. One key aim is well known by both Germany and Russia - the creation of a 'Wehrstaat', or military state, that will adequately prepare the Heer for war. This is to be carried out at the latest by 1941, when it is expected that the Germans will be able to significantly outnumber and outproduce their enemies on the European continent.\n\nMore worrying are their eastern plans. One top-secret goal of theirs is the aim to subjugate their eastern client states further and expand the Wehrstaat. This will be done with no regard to the civilian population in those states. Furthermore, assuming any form of non-compliance from Ukraine, Belarus, and Poland in particular, the overthrow of their governments is to be assured, and a German commissarial regime will be heavily considered.\n\nIf there was any pacifist sentiment in the Russian political scene left, the publishing of these findings has thoroughly destroyed it. Russia's mission is now clear: to save Eastern Europe from German militarisation and colonisation, and to challenge the Heer's arrogance and disdain for peace."
 rusfla.107.a: "What better evidence is there that Prussian militarism is the scorn of the world?"

 rusfla.108.t: "Savinkov Lives!"
 rusfla.108.d: "Or so claims a book by former Svobodnik, Sergey Nikitich Ivanov. How? I am glad you asked. See, it is known that Savinkov's bodyguard, Flegont Klepikov, was eerily similar-looking to the late Vozhd himself, and they were known to 'switch' roles at times when the SZRS was working underground against the Bolsheviks, and every day could have ended with the Cheka shooting Savinkov. Apparently, Klepikov was able to impersonate Savinkov well, to the point that there is a scholarly debate if some photographs of Savinkov from 1918-1920 are of him, or if they are actually Klepikov.\n\n'The Truth of the Vozhd' claims that Boris Savinkov in fact escaped Moscow on that fatal day when he faced the coup. The military shot Klepikov instead - and to save face, they claimed they had killed the right man. Savinkov was buried in an unmarked grave, so we are unable to examine his remains - why? Perhaps it is all part of the conspiracy. And what of Klepikov's official fate? He is marked as killed in the coup alongside Savinkov, but again, buried in an unmarked grave, with only military reports to believe. Obviously, there cannot be any other reason for unmarked graves than a military conspiracy.\n\nWake up! Somewhere out there, Savinkov still lives! Perhaps he is plotting for his triumphant return, like Napoleon himself came back from Elba! Sons of Savinkov, be ready, for when he comes back, we must be ready to once more take power. Russia fara da se!"

 rusfla.109.t: "The First Family of Russia"
 rusfla.109.d: "Savinkov has never lived what one would call a 'Christian family ideal'. He and his wife, Yevgenia Ivanovna Savinkova, largely maintain the appearance of a happy marriage, but it is Russia's worst kept secret that the Vozhd has a new lover every couple of years. Currently, his favourite is the actress Lyudmila Leonidovna Fedoseeva, often titled as the most beautiful woman in Russia.\n\nSavinkov's oldest son, Viktor Borisovich, has a moderately successful military career and sometimes appears as part of his father's honour guard. The other son, Lev, is a national disaster and might as well not exist in Russian documents of the Vozhd's life. Lev Borisovich lived in Paris as an avant-garde poet and a socialist, having migrated there to escape the 'dreary lifelessness' of Russian cultural life. Savinkov's daughter, Tatyana Borisovna Borisova, is rarely seen in public.\n\nThe Vozhd's brother, Viktor Viktorovich, has been with him since the beginning. Viktor is a veteran organiser of the Volunteer Army, a writer, a theosophist, an occultist, an SZRS politician, and very much part of the Vozhd's inner circle of men he absolutely trusts, alongside Aleksandr Derental and Flegont Klepikov. Viktor's son, Nikolay Viktorovich Savinkov, is a young and brash radical, aiming for a political career worthy of his father and uncle.\n\nSavinkov's sister, Vera Viktorovna Myagkova, and her husband, Aleksandr Gennadyevich Myagkov, are relatively well known, as Aleksandr is active in the SZRS and is one of the Vozhd's trusted right-hand men, currently working in the party bureaucracy in Moscow. It is rumoured that the Vozhd's sister, Sofia Viktorovna Turinovich, has connections to the opposition as a more democratic-leaning Eser, but these are unsubstantiated. The Vozhd's sister, Nadezhda Viktorovna Maydela, is active in SZRS' women's organisations.\n\nThe oldest brother, Aleksandr Viktorovich, shot himself after battling severe depression in Yakutia in 1905 in a Tsarist labour camp. The place of his death, Olekminsk, is now a site of pilgrimage, and famous for ending the first act in the Vozhd's illustrious life, putting him firmly on the path to triumph. A social democratic Russia which Aleksandr fought for has never been further from happening."

A supposedly pacifist party began to justify the murder and bloodshed of innocents - the moral death of German social democracy.\n\nFor the first time in history, the SPD sits at the top of German politics. Some have mistakenly believed its ascension to be a positive development for Russo-German relations; after all, they reason, democracies have little reason to get in each other's way. Surely the cause for war among the Social Democrats in 1914 is no longer relevant to this day and age?\n\nSuch views were addressed in a Duma speech by VPP historian and Eurasian ideologue, Nikolay Trubetskoy. In his own words, sentiments of peace between democracies are misguided; they ignore the inherent differences between the Russian and German democracies and, in particular, their foreign policy. Yes, the SPD may have hopes of peace between Berlin and Moscow, but Berlin is guided by the military-industrial complex, not the aspirations of party politicians. This has been a fact of the German nation since its founding: its soul is bound to the whims of the armed forces, which believes it must subjugate Russia to defend what it calls civilised Europe.\n\nWhile Trubetskoy is not particularly well-liked, the prevailing mood was that he had articulated himself well. The point was one that many could agree with: the enemy of Russia is not democracy, but the Prussian militarists who co-opt it so they may light the spark of world war once again."

 rusfla.111.t: "Rubber Blown by the Wind"
 rusfla.111.d: "Ever since the Weltkrieg started, the worldwide demand for rubber skyrocketed, mainly caused by increased vehicle and plane production. Russia could not escape this trend and, in fact, was hit harder than others. With the global war catching up to the main rubber producers, unreliable imports from the east, and constant warfare on the Baltic and Black Seas in the west, any import of rubber was either hard or nearly impossible. Fortunately for us, one solution to this issue was beginning to develop in the Alash steppes.\n\nTaraxacum kok-saghyz, also known as Russian dandelion, is a plant discovered in the 1930s by a group of Russian scientists interested in new rubber opportunities. It was noted that sap produced by the roots of this plant contained up to 20% natural rubber. While before the Weltkrieg, any research on this topic was limited, the current situation changed the matter drastically, and soon, large-scale plantations were created deep in the Kyrgyz Steppe. While mainly Taraxacum kok-saghyz was cultivated, other sap species were quickly introduced as well, such as Taraxacum hybernum or Takhtajaniantha tau-saghyz.\n\nThe rubber yield from the plantations, however, was not enough to make up for the costs of cultivation. That is without even considering the fact that demand is constantly increasing, despite a shortage of supply. But with no other viable option until the sea clears, this initiative continues to be expanded."
 rusfla.111.a: "While kids blew on the dandelion clocks, adults used it to protect them."

 rusfla.112.t: "Society of Friends of the New Russia"
 rusfla.112.d: "It may sound paradoxical, knowing what we think and speak of Germany's hegemony over Europe, but not everyone in the German Empire sees our Third Russia with revulsion and fear. A handful see it as an example to follow. Dismayed with the sterile pseudo-democratic monarchy of their home, a handful of activists within the most extreme German far-right have established the 'Society of Friends of the New Russia', a study group which intends to research our new, third way system. They are planning lecture evenings, publication of the Party's foundational texts, and, if the situation allows, even trips to Russia to witness it first-hand.\n\nThe chairman of the society is Gregor Strasser, and a small working committee consists of Arthur Moeller van den Bruck, Edgar Jung, Hans Freyer, and Hanns Heinz Ewers - an idiosyncratic collection of right-wing ideologues, writers, and off-beat philosophers who found the Fatherland Party either too moderate or too archaic for their tastes. Many of the ordinary members, as well as Strasser himself, belong to the minuscule German Socialist Party (DSP) led by Julius Streicher.\n\nThis 'society' is politically irrelevant, but perhaps there is a point in leaving it be and even organising some controlled trips to our most advanced new industrial complexes? If the impossible happens one day and we are required to occupy a large part of Germany, we will have to find collaborators somewhere..."

 rusfla.113.d: "A totalitarian dictatorship hell-bent on waging war upon Europe has come to power in Russia - yet, we have been informed that its 'National Populist' ideas are beginning to seep into some of our intellectual circles. A handful of far-right activists too extreme and unstable to support the DVLP have established the 'Society of Friends of the New Russia', a study group which intends to research this new, third way system. They are planning lecture evenings, publication of the Party's foundational texts, and, if the situation allows, even trips to Russia to witness it first-hand.\n\nThe chairman of the society is Gregor Strasser, and a small working committee consists of Arthur Moeller van den Bruck, Edgar Jung, Hans Freyer, and Hanns Heinz Ewers - an idiosyncratic collection of right-wing ideologues, writers, and off-beat philosophers who found the Fatherland Party either too moderate or too archaic for their tastes. Many of the ordinary members, as well as Strasser himself, belong to the minuscule German Socialist Party (DSP) led by Julius Streicher.\n\nThankfully, this 'society' has no reach beyond its small membership and their sympathies towards our eternal enemy will certainly keep them irrelevant - what is more concerning, however, is the possibility that Russian secret services will use this organisation's presence for their purposes."

 rusfla.114.t: "Diplomacy at the Last Hour" #RUS
 rusfla.114.d: "As a last-ditch effort to avoid a war between the Slavic brothers, the Russian ambassador to Ukraine has delivered a note to [202.GetName] showing our desire for friendship with the Ukrainians. There is no need for bloodshed with [UKR.GetNameDef], which has a shared history, culture, and democratic value system with Russia.\n\nWe have graciously offered the Ukrainians a deal, one which would be unthinkable not to accept. In exchange for a treaty of friendship, one that would strengthen the economic ties between both nations, Ukraine would allow the Russian armed forces to use its territory as a staging ground against German aggression. We have also promised that, should Germany invade Ukraine in response, then the Russian military will take care of it, with the Ukrainian army only taking part in defensive operations if deemed absolutely necessary.\n\nYet the timetable for their response has expired, which can only mean one thing."

 rusfla.115.t: "Of Utmost Importance" #UKR
 rusfla.115.d: "The Russian ambassador in [202.GetName] has delivered a note 'of the utmost importance' from the Russian foreign ministry.\n\nAs the Ukrainian government is well aware, the note began, Russian troop formations are concentrated around the Ukrainian border and their allies. Apparently, Berlin is unwilling to negotiate and show any concern for Russian security, and defensive measures have been prepared against their entire military alliance.\n\nHowever, the note explains that Russia does not want war with Ukraine - the two nations share a common culture, history and, most importantly, a democratic system. As such, they have offered us a way to get out of the conflict. In exchange for a Treaty of Friendship with Russia, Ukraine will allow the Russian armed forces to use its territory as a staging ground against German attacks, with minimal involvement from the Ukrainian military. [202.GetName] will have its independence guaranteed, its democratic system intact, and will have to spill little blood.\n\nBut at the end of the day, there was no guarantee of sincerity. And so..."
 rusfla.115.a: "We won't bow to these Russian demands!"

 rusfla.116.t: "The Art of Diplomacy"
 rusfla.116.d: "Foreign Secretary of the German Empire, Ulrich von Hassell, has arrived in Moscow. For some time, he spoke of opening negotiations with Russia to discuss the future of Central and Eastern Europe between the two great powers. Now, we finally get to hear what he has to say.\n\nHassell seemingly tried to sweet-talk the President as soon as they met. A Europe without Russia is not Europe at all, he explained, and together, they can guarantee the revitalisation of Europe and the defence of its character against communist subversion. He noted that Germany has indeed antagonised Russia in the past, but that relations could start anew: together, Moscow and Berlin could stand as a much stronger bulwark against the red tide. Was this not something desirable? After all, Russia has seen some of its worst atrocities committed by communists; to prevent their expansion was a moral duty.\n\nBut Savinkov was quick to counter. If the point of Hassell's visit was the formation of an anti-communist bloc, then this conversation could have taken place years ago. It is good that for once a German government finally sees reason that Russia does not have to be an enemy, but this must be conditional, and shown with actions rather than words.\n\nThe most important thing, the President explained, was that Germany start making steps to 'demilitarise the border between Russia and her western neighbours', as well as remove, by force if necessary, anti-Russian state elements in Germany's eastern satellite states.\n\nFor Savinkov, this was the red line. But Hassell tried to find a way around it."
 rusfla.116.a: "We are trying to be reasonable."

 rusfla.117.t: "The Counteroffer"
 rusfla.117.d: "Hassell felt that, as much as he had seen the Russian demands as reasonable, he could not give in. Not only were the Oststaaten a vital part of German prestige, influence and power, but back home, things would look terrible if he accepted such a deal.\n\nHe claimed that the military alliances between Germany and the Eastern European states were of a defensive nature, and therefore of no harm to Russia. Furthermore, little to no German troops were stationed in these countries. However, as a sign of goodwill to the Russian government of Berlin's intentions, Hassell mentioned that the fate of certain Eastern European territories, like the Donbass, could be talked over.\n\nThe Vozhd would have none of it: for Russia, he responded, Ukraine and Belarus were more than just their western neighbours, more than a country to siphon off resources from. Together, they are parts of a whole triune Russian nation, whose history and culture are inseparable from it despite what Berlin claims. If Hassell was serious about negotiations, he said, then he should consider a different offer.\n\nTo form an alliance that will uphold European tradition and safety from communism, the Vozhd began, then Berlin must withdraw from Belarus and Ukraine, and allow them to ally or reunite with their historical homeland as they wish. In exchange, Russia will not interfere in the affairs of Poland, the Baltic countries, and the Caucasus will have its independence guaranteed by both parties.\n\nAnd so, no agreement was signed. Berlin and Moscow have their red lines, and it seems they can only be broken through the might of steel."
 rusfla.117.a: "An utter waste of time."

 rusfla.118.t: "Fallout of the Revolution"
 rusfla.118.d: "Russia's seemingly overnight shift to the far-left has had drastic geopolitical consequences. The most immediate effects could be felt through Germany and their satellite states; while Savinkov's regime never maintained a friendly facade with Berlin, the revolution quickly terminated any goodwill the Russians and Germans had for each other.\n\nAs such, many question whether the geopolitical situation can remain stable for much longer. Both sides feel more threatened than before, arguably even more so than the early 1910s. How long will it take for the 20th century to have its second Franz Ferdinand that strikes the match of war? Russian politicians have often spoken of German plotting to encircle, isolate and destroy Russia. At times this was seen as misguided, as some presumed Germany would be uninterested in occupying Russia for a second time, especially as both powers could bond over an anti-communist cause. Now, no sceptic can deny reality: Germany sees the destruction of Russian socialism as necessary for its survival.\n\nElsewhere, in the Far East, things are not much different. Japan's reaction to the revolution has been overwhelmingly negative. In fact, our spies have informed us of a potential Japanese-German rapprochement, despite their conflicting spheres of influence in the Pacific. With how prideful and arrogant the German imperialists are, it is unlikely that they will come to anything meaningful, but the fact that it was being considered sheds light on a new era in international relations.\n\nFurthermore, the German-Austrian relationship has also changed; a rekindled alliance against socialism may be imminent, despite squabbles over Eastern European and Balkan interests since the end of the Great War. In the latter region, formerly friendly Balkan states have largely abandoned positive relations with Russia out of the belief that a Europe dominated by Germany is better than one dominated by communism."
 rusfla.118.a: "The imperialists will never destroy what we have built together."

 rusfla.119.t: "Elections in Warsaw"
 rusfla.119.d: "The reborn Polish state, under Russian protection, has had its first free elections. While the overall turnout was low - a common theme across a Europe that simply wants to rebuild - the election remained competitive. This year, it ended in a victory for the [POL.GetRulingParty].\n\nThe new Polish political scene is largely a consequence of the shifting attitudes and decisions made during the Great Patriotic War. When the war kicked off, it was portrayed by the government as a defence of European civilisation against the Russo-Asiatic menace, threatening to conquer Poland and erase its identity once again. With some reservations, many moderates, both in the Endecja and Centrolew, backed the war effort.\n\nThis was not to last. Russian forces had turned the tide of battle, and once the war had reached Polish territory, things had suddenly become much more controversial. In fact, many increasingly saw Russia not as an invader, but a potential ally; would it not be better, after all, to align with a democratic Russia that will guarantee Polish territorial integrity instead of an authoritarian German monarch?\n\nAs the Kingdom crumbled to Russian forces, the provisional Republic of Poland was declared in the occupation zone. Only those who were more loyal to Berlin than Warsaw did not defect; Polish politicians largely recognised that their state's future was to lie with Russia."
 rusfla.119.a: "Tell me more..."

 rusfla.120.t: "Elections in Warsaw (cont.)"
 rusfla.120.d: "For some, however, this was an unexpected turn of events. The Polish National Committee, residing in Moscow, had already been planning to form a government in the Russian occupation zone. However, Russia never recognised the National Committee, even during the war against the German hegemon, and decided to keep its options open.\n\nIn the end, this seemed to bear fruit. The Polish far-right proved incapable of beginning a general uprising, and Moscow was quick to recognise the liberal republic, believing that it would not only have more legitimacy and popular support but be a more reliable partner to Moscow. As such, the ties built up between the Russians and Polish nationalists have completely broken down.\n\nOf course, this is a preferable state of affairs. While the Polish centre-right has largely accepted Russian partnership as a preferable alternative to socialism, the far-right has never obscured their distaste for the Russian civilisation, seeing it as a bastardisation of Slavic culture.\n\nPolish and Russian state media refer to the new Russo-Polish relationship as the turning of a new leaf. Yes, Russia was unmistakably the land of Tsarist autocracy before, one that tried to erase Poland entirely; but the Russia of today is a liberator, who has brought the values of the great February Revolution to the Poles. It may be hard to believe, but Russia and Poland may just become friends for a long time, united for democracy and against communism."
 rusfla.120.a: "Cheers to our Polish friends."

 rusfla.121.t: "An Unreliable Ally"
 rusfla.121.d: "The National Democrats in Poland owe a lot to Moscow for Polish liberation. Having seized power in the midst of the Great Patriotic War in cooperation with Russian forces, the Poland of today is essentially an Endecja one-party state, and thus far the relationship with Moscow has been cooperative.\n\nBut they make it no secret that, for all the help they have been given, they are not willing to give any respect in return. Adam Doboszyński, the current leader of the National Democrats, is known to view Russia as nothing more than the manifestation of the corruption of the Asian steppe and Byzantine influence on Slavic culture; A monster to be slain the moment it shows any weakness.\n\nAs unlikely as it is for Doboszyński to receive the opportunity to pose a serious threat, it is a risk that must be accounted for. Other members of the National Democrats may be more amenable to us or willing to work against Doboszyński should he get ahead of himself in the future and require replacing."
 rusfla.121.a: "Such dissent may prove intolerable."

 rusfla.122.t: "A New, Old Order in [202.GetName]"
 rusfla.122.d: "On January 25th, 1918, when the Central Rada of Ukraine declared a sovereign and independent people's republic, its history became intertwined with that of the Germans in the west. An offensive by the Central Powers only a month later would drive Russia out of much of Ukraine, and a German-backed coup that propelled General Pavel Skoropadsky to power would solidify the country in the German sphere for years to come. Those in the Hetman's government seeking unification with the motherland were dismissed, and the Hetman himself, a Russian man at heart, chose to serve Germany and his own ambitions instead of his home country.\n\nBut those ambitions lay waste today as a new, yet familiar order now resides in Kiev. The exiled people's republic, bolstered by the inefficiencies and authoritarianism of the Hetman's regime, has returned after a successful uprising. For many newspapers in the major Russian cities reporting on the events in Kiev, the result came as a slight shock but ultimately proves a major development in Eastern Europe, illustrating that German control in Eastern Europe is more tenuous than once thought.\n\nYet little seems to have changed, as shortly after the Republicans' victory, the Central Rada declared it would uphold most of the treaties the Hetman's regime had with Germany. The new government may spout democratic slogans and declare that it will act where the Hetman didn't - but the reality is that Ukraine will never be free so long as it remains a tool of Berlin's foreign policy."
 rusfla.122.a: "At the end of the day, little has changed."

 rusfla.123.t: "The American Kolchak"
 rusfla.123.d: "A major newspaper, 'People's Cause', published a lengthy interview with General Douglas MacArthur, titled 'The American Kolchak'. The interview goes in-depth into the American situation, followed closely by Russian audiences with a mix of pity and horror. Will the Americans have to go through the same trial of blood and fire that the Russians had? How many will be murdered by the American Chekists?\n\nMuch of the publicity is focused on the American 'Whites' - a term that obviously carries a very different meaning in American politics. The article popularised the idea of MacArthur as the saviour of America, a man with a pinch of Kolchak and Kornilov in his veins, a stern military man able to make the decisions that weak politicians were not able to make. Some Russian publications idolise Huey Long too, perhaps even comparing him favourably to Savinkov, but the overall consensus seems to be that MacArthur's government is the legitimate one, and deserves the support of the Russians, both from the citizens and the government."

 rusfla.124.t: "Treaty of Dresden"
 rusfla.124.d: "The Credit and Trade Agreement Between [RUS.GetNameDef] and [GRU.GetNameDef] lays the groundwork for the future economic relationship between Eastern Europe's two dominant economies. The treaty annulled all remaining Russian debts to German public or private banks, essentially legalising their defaulted state. Additionally, all property connected to the German government, Reichsbank or a number of the largest companies of Germany is sold to the Russian government at a token price - again, legalising the seizures that already happened. In addition, the same process is applied to properties in all the territories that have been annexed into [RUS.GetNameDef], and of [RUS.GetNameDef]'s allies.\n\nThe war reparations were already included in the peace treaty, but further economic concessions are included in the new treaty. It defines the framework of Free Europe (that meaning all territories in Europe not in control of socialist states, and which engage in free trade) as a bloc led by its strongest economy - Russia - and ensures Russia the Most Favoured Nation principle in trade and conduct of business. Until the war reparations have been paid, the Economic Inspection Committee will continue monitoring the German economic decision-making to ensure upholding the peace treaty."

 rusfla.125.t: "Vladimir Meets Maria"
 rusfla.125.d: "20-year-old Tsesarevich Vladimir is often called a serious young man, which is not surprising, since he is burdened by high expectations and past mistakes of the Romanovs. Highly interested in state affairs and governance, the young prince stands out among the many modern monarchs and heirs and rarely appears among women or at parties, preferring his studies to a bohemian lifestyle.\n\nBut recently everything has changed: there are rumours that, under pressure from his father regarding marriage and the birth of an heir, Tsesarevich Vladimir contacted Infanta Maria Cristina of Spain, whom he met several years ago when her father was on a visit to Russia. Although the young prince's choice may have been dictated by his attempt to strengthen his father's position on the Russian throne among the legalists, he and the Infanta had maintained a correspondence over the past few months. Both are fluent in French, German, and English, and, according to rumours, the young people quickly found mutually interesting topics. Recently, the Tsesarevich invited the Infanta (at least temporarily) to live in Russia until the political situation in Spain improves.\n\nThe Infanta, with her father's blessing, accepted the invitation, and now their frequent appearance at public events has become a widely discussed topic in high Moscow society. The contrast of their behaviour in public - with the cautious and measured demeanour of Vladimir Kirillovich and the energetic and cheerful character of Maria Cristina managed to touch the hearts of many citizens."

 rusfla.126.d: "After several years of courtship by Vladimir III, learning Russian culture and language, Infanta Maria Cristina of Spain a few weeks ago agreed to the emperor's marriage proposal. Although some hardliners initially accused Vladimir III of violating succession laws after his father, most were silenced after the Infanta announced her intention to convert to the Orthodox faith. Yesterday, Maria Cristina Bourbon y Battenberg converted to Orthodoxy and received the name Maria Fyodorovna in honour of the patron icon of the Romanovs - Our Lady of Saint Theodora.\n\nToday, a lavish wedding took place in the Kremlin Cathedral of the Dormition, at which most of the guests were Russian statesmen and relatives of the emperor, and only a few guests were from the bride's side. Vladimir and Maria exchanged rings three times, then knelt and exchanged formal wedding vows, holding their wedding crowns above their heads. After they were led around the lectern, they knelt and kissed the golden cross, and after the last prayer, Vladimir and Maria were declared husband and wife.\n\nThe Emperor tried to keep the event as modest as possible, refusing to organise national celebrations, and at the end of the day he made a speech on the radio, urging Russian citizens to spend time with their loved ones and never forget the importance of family."

 rusfla.127.d: "Yesterday morning's radio announcement was met with surprise by the public. The Empress, who has not appeared at public events for the past few months, has given birth to a daughter. The Emperor himself met with journalists today and admitted that he saw no point in announcing his wife's pregnancy because of the possibility that the child would develop haemophilia or other complications that could negate the joyful moment.\n\nAt the end of the interview he made the remark that 'Salic law never existed in Russia, the glorious reigns of the two Yekaterinas, Anna, and Yelizaveta clearly demonstrate that the need for a man as a ruler is an outdated concept that has no place in modern Russia'. The latter comment quickly caused an uproar in hardline monarchist circles, who immediately accused the Emperor of being 'out of his mind' and 'a tyrant going against the traditions of his people'.\n\nMeanwhile, magazines across Russia began to speculate about impending changes in laws that would allow women to take the throne and promote equality in rights that had not existed before. At the end of the interview, under pressure from several journalists, Vladimir III laughingly answered 'the most important question' and told his daughter's name, which he and his wife had chosen.

Due to the family's growing concerns about an heir, he finally decided to propose to Leonida Bagration-Mukhtarsky, a young woman from the sideline of the Georgian kings. They met several years ago at one of the state parties, and from that time on they discovered that they had a lot in common, and their relationship gradually grew into something more than just friendship.\n\nAlthough the Emperor initially feared that some hardliners would not approve of the union due to Leonida's previous divorce and the fact that she did not belong to a sovereign ruling family, he eventually decided to propose to her. The ensuing uproar from monarchists and legalists was quickly rejected by the Emperor, who simply declared the laws of succession obsolete and decided to ignore them. Public opinion is divided - citizens are not particularly concerned about such laws, but monarchists and even some politicians accuse the Emperor of 'childishness' and outright violation of laws.\n\nDespite this, today the wedding took place in the Kremlin Cathedral of the Dormition. Vladimir and Leonida exchanged rings three times, then knelt and exchanged wedding vows, holding wedding crowns above their heads. After they were led around the lectern, they knelt and kissed the golden cross, and after the last prayer, Vladimir and Leonida were declared husband and wife. After this, celebrations were announced throughout Russia by the Emperor, who hoped to strengthen public support for his move and overcome the monarchists' dissatisfaction with his choice."

 rusfla.129.t: "Formation of the Nomenclature"
 rusfla.129.t2: "Reform the Table of Ranks?"
 rusfla.129.t3: "The Volkonsky Proposal"
 rusfla.129.d: "The Table of Ranks, one of the most important social elevators in the Russian Empire, did not die with the empire. The mechanism that allowed commoners to become nobles for their service and merit, through advancement through the government or military career ladder, was one of the most progressive institutions in Russia at the time. This allowed people like Lenin, Kornilov, Guchkov, or Denikin to become nobles as a result of their or their ancestors' service. Restored in the new iteration after the February Revolution in the Russian Republic, the new Table of Governmental Ranks served not as an instrument for ennoblement, but for interdepartmental relations and fair payment and pensions for government officials.\n\nAt the last congress of the SZRS, the Vozhd himself took to the podium and put forward the principle of selecting government personnel according to their qualities, condemning nepotism in the actions of local bureaucrats who 'dragged along their friends and cronies, placing them in key positions in the republican state apparatus, creating a group of people personally devoted to them'. After stormy applause in the hall, Savinkov continued: 'It's not good to select people like that, this method of selection is anti-popular, I'd say anti-party'.\n\nAs a solution to the problem, a new reform was proposed - the abandonment of the Table of Governmental Ranks and its replacement with the 'Nomenclature Lists of State Officials'. The new project will require all local party offices to compile lists of people who can be trusted to serve in government agencies, and will oblige only such people to be appointed to important positions. Of course, an 'alternative route' of appointment will be allowed, which will require fair and democratic elections and, as such, ensure the popular support of the candidate. This reform will prevent the formation of anti-popular cliques in local administrations and will allow the party to move the country forward in accordance with the vision of a better Russia."
 rusfla.129.d2: "The Table of Ranks, one of the most important social elevators in the Russian Empire, did not die with the empire.

On this issue, two camps were quickly formed. The first camp, consisting chiefly of the Kadets and VPP, argues that the Table of Ranks is an outdated institution and does not fulfil its task of interdepartmental coordination (and never could do so), and therefore the Table of Ranks should be abandoned and replaced with individual ranks for each service. The second camp was formed from the SRs, who received the support of the RDP on their proposal, insisting on maintaining the Table of Ranks, but divided between federal and local institutions - with autonomies being allowed to use their own Tables of Ranks. Both variants should reduce the burden on the state budget and allow for a more nuanced approach to the personal pensions of government officials. Ultimately, due to the deadlock, both options were proposed to the President and left to his discretion."

According to his proposal, each rank in the system should give personal ennoblement to a government official with a form of address depending on the rank, personal ennoblement to the official's wife to maintain gender equality, and also give hereditary ennoblement to the highest ranks. The issue of pensions for nobles in the proposal was immediately rejected after the first hearing.\n\nThe Duma was quickly divided on this issue: the left wing declared that Volkonsky had finally fallen under the influence of his former superior Protopopov, and mockingly suggested that he 'guarantee the absence of mind-listening devices in the offices of those above 3-class ranks'.\n\nThe majority of the Duma, although rejecting the idea of hereditary nobility, supported the idea of personal ennoblement of government officials starting from 6-class ranks and the establishment of an appropriate form of addressing to governmental officials depending on the rank. After heated debates today, the Duma decided..."

This first contour, which grew into the overwhelming power of the snare drum beats, reflected the state of anxiety, the heavy foreboding that was then in the air. Shostakovich showed the work to his friends and students, but until recently did not consider it necessary to perform or publish it. 'I finished the first part of this work on September 3, the second on September 17, and the third on September 29. Now I'm finishing the last, fourth part. I'm composing at a hellish speed and I can't stop.' - the composer said a few months ago.\n\nThe finished 7th Symphony has already aroused great interest among Russian and foreign critics. Thanks to government propaganda, supported by Shostakovich himself, who was forced to leave Petrograd to complete the work, the symphony soon received the nickname 'The Symphony of Revenge'.\n\nThe premiere of Symphony No. 7 was symbolically performed by the evacuated orchestra of the North-West branch of the Society 'Radioperedacha' under the direction of Karl Eliasberg. Considering the death of some of the musicians due to the enemy's successes at the front, only 15 musicians were able to play — musicians from other orchestras and even military units were called in to replenish the orchestra. Having received high praise from the government and the press, the comment of one of the ministers 'Dmitry Shostakovich's Seventh Symphony is an expression of the growing and inevitable victory of the Russian people over the Kaiser's Germany, a symphony of all-conquering courage, a symphony of triumphant truth of the Russian people over all the tyrannical forces of the world.' quickly became one of the most cited phrases about the symphony.\n\nSoon after the premiere, the military organised a tour of several orchestras to the fronts, where 'The Symphony of Revenge' was met with applause from front-line soldiers and commanders, fully conveying their feelings about the war."

The performance of the symphony took place in front of a completely overcrowded hall, broadcast on the radio across the country. The comment of writer Aleksey Tolstoy 'The Seventh Symphony arose from the conscience of the Russian people, who without hesitation accepted mortal combat with the black forces. It has grown to the size of great world art, understandable at all latitudes and meridians, because it tells the truth about a man in an unprecedented time of his trials.' soon appeared in more than one magazine, joining the avalanche of praise from critics.\n\nSoon after the premiere, the military organised tours of several orchestras to the fronts, where the 'The Symphony of Liberation' was met with applause from frontline soldiers and commanders, who had gotten the chance to experience civilian life away from home."

However, there is a small number of people who consider the true Emperor and Autocrat of All Russia to be not the [RUS.GetLeader], but Prince Georgy Brasov, the only son of the murdered Mikhail, the brother and heir of Nikolay II.\n\nUsing a rather specific interpretation of the somewhat confusing Act of Succession to the Throne, primarily article 28, which states 'the succession to the throne belongs above all to the eldest son of the reigning emperor', this group of people claim that on the accession of Mikhail II to the throne within a single day in March 1918, his wife and son, even if morganatic, automatically became Empress and Tsesarevich respectively, making Georgy the legitimate head of the Romanov family and the rightful claimant to the throne. Prince Brasov himself does not support these views and prefers to stay out of politics, considering the [RUS.GetLeader] as the head of the dynasty, despite the rather strained relations of the other members of the imperial family with his adored mother, Natalia Brasova, and enjoys life and his hobby - sports car racing - as the Grand Prince Romanovsky-Brasov."

Vendzyagolsky finished off with a promise that they will finish what Dmowski has started and liberate Poland, their brotherly nation, from the fangs of the Teutonic eagle. 'Neither Russia nor Poland are lost yet', ended the eulogy-turned-propaganda event.\n\nDmowski was buried in the Novodevichy Cemetery, his coffin draped in the Polish flag.

Once, he got anxious about not getting any letters from his long-time rival, Józef Piłsudski, stating that the postal office must have made some mistake - why else wouldn't he have written to him?

Yes, the previous Ukrainian regime was certainly a puppet of Berlin, but Ukrainian nationhood was more than the machinations of the Heer and military-industrial complex. No matter how one puts it, the Ukrainian lands are, in a way, less independent than they were before. It is ironic - was the Great Patriotic War not said to be a war of national liberation, of freedom for Europe's oppressed peoples?\n\nDespite his personal thoughts on the matter, he was never quite able to convince his allies that Ukraine should have its own state. The massive revanchist sentiment and resentment towards Germany were simply not something the [RUS_leader] was going to overcome.\n\nIn due time, with the reawakening of the Ukrainian intelligentsia and as the years pass by, the question of Ukrainian statehood may come up again.

Many of the Ukrainian intelligentsia have been imprisoned, fled into exile, or been intimidated, but it is just one generation of them. In the future, regardless of how well pacified the Ukrainian lands are, there is widespread fear of yet another mass protest movement against Moscow.\n\nAnd it is almost paradoxical, in a way. The more force is used to suppress the Ukrainian nationalist movement, the more it will grow - yet the more autonomy given, the more the Ukrainians will use it to spread anti-Russian propaganda.

But now, with the Motherland's perhaps greatest trial by fire, he has petitioned the government to be allowed to return to service.\n\n'I have always been too stubborn to stay out of harm's way', he explained. Kornilov is not demanding his old position back, but merely 'a duty fitting of an old soldier, one who has dedicated his life to the service of the Motherland'. There are some doubts, especially among civilian politicians, as Kornilov was always infamous for leveraging his military position to influence government policy. But then again, Kornilov has been thoroughly humiliated - he is far from the old man of steel he once was.\n\nPerhaps he would be best used to support the war effort, to tour the country and frontline units to lift spirits.

From a lowly terrorist to the man sitting at the absolute top of the Kremlin, he has only been strengthened in this view - and events outside of Russia have taken no less of a role.\n\nAt first, it was the victory of materialist-communism in Western Europe, which arose in contrast to the materialist-capitalist Germany. Now, all evidence has pointed to the total and utter transformation of the German state under the Schleicher regime, which seeks to completely destroy the human spirit and replace it with machine. Was it not fate that Savinkov's rise to prominence had happened around the same time, that the Third Russia rose to challenge the decay of the modern world?\n\nRussia must save itself, yes, but its mission is greater: to save the world. The coming war will not be about imperialism or conquest, but the freeing of mankind's soul from enslavement. To that ultimate end, any means are acceptable.

At its heart, Novorussia was born out of a compromise - one that would, in theory, appease both Russian nationalists and Ukrainian autonomists. Particular attention has been given to Russophone Ukrainians, who make up the majority of the autonomy's government.\n\nWhile in theory the autonomy has the same rights of any other, in reality the government is largely controlled by business interests - particularly the metallurgical industries that seek to exploit the Donbass coal and iron mines. This state of affairs was mostly by design, however, given Moscow's desire to keep a tighter leash over eastern Ukraine.\n\nThe ongoing reconstruction means that political life in the region has not properly rejuvenated, so how the Novorussian idea will be regarded in the future is unknown.

Broken and bathed in nuclear hellfire, Europe is not any closer to this 'spiritual revolution' than it was twenty years ago. Even after the triumph over international socialism, things feel much the same - and in truth, few can gloat about that triumph when millions upon millions of bodies scatter Europe, their losses in absolute vain.\n\nWere the years as the Vozhd - the ascension to power, the rejuvenation of the Russian spirit, the victories over Berlin and Paris all for nothing? The past years had given him purpose, nigh convincing him that he was fulfilling a cosmic mission to save the world. All actions he took were towards the completion of that mission. Where is the result, the spiritual revolution of mankind that was foretold? He would rather have lost to the hated Germans if he knew this was the culmination of the Third Russia's struggle.\n\nAll those comrades lost... for this? All that blood spilled... for what, exactly? To simply continue as yet another great empire in a long series of empires? For decades, Savinkov has been running away from the terrifying meaninglessness of the human condition, but now there is nowhere to run.

They called it ridiculous, the idea that the Vozhd came to lead Russia's people in their fateful hour, restoring the pride and soul of the nation. Who is laughing now?\n\nFor Savinkov, however, the Great Patriotic War did not simply pave the way for Russia to be a great power again. The past years had been pointing to the fact that Savinkov was fulfilling fate itself - but one could have reasonably argued that Miss Fortune always had his back, that he was always getting lucky at the right place and time. But can a man be so lucky as this, to gather the Russian masses and destroy the so-called 'Pax Germanica' after years of dedication?\n\nNow it is confirmed that it is fate who guides the Vozhd of the Russian people. And with that in mind, he looks towards the enslaved west. If fate has brought him here, he understands that he must go against all common sense: war is inevitable, and it is a war Russia will win. However many Russians and Frenchmen have to die for the victory against materialism, it does not matter.

Ever since Russia became an official member of the International's military alliance, the Germans have made no pretence of their intent to exterminate the workers' states. That intent has been made manifest in this pact, in which they seek to strangle the socialist world into destruction; Nadolny spoke of the pact as a necessary measure for the 'civilised peoples' of Europe. Of course, there is nothing civilised about stating your shared intents to invade and overthrow the homegrown socialist democracies.\n\nThe Anti-International Pact is more than an agreement to cooperate militarily against us; it goes to the most extreme measures. Signatories of the pact have decreed that the 'Communist subversion is to be in a state of permanent blockade', thus ceasing all trade relations with us. While the main signatories of the pact were mostly members of Mitteleuropa, many representatives of the Entente - some of whom do not even have official relations with Germany - were invited to the Foreign Office as well.\n\nIt is, of course, highly hypocritical that they say the pact was necessary due to our efforts to 'undermine peace' when they have effectively ceased all diplomatic ties with us. Now it has become clearer than ever how terrified Germany is of the red liberation. With contacts almost completely breaking down, the war has become a matter of if, not when.

In particular, as many were part of Germany's war against the Internationale, they retain a number of anti-socialist laws. Combined with red scare propaganda, this has made the chance of a far-left electoral victory in our client states next to null.\n\nWith that in mind, many in the State Duma have advocated for our oversight to be as little as possible. After all, they say, the real enemy is the International - even the SPD can no longer be considered our adversaries, despite our poor history with them. Furthermore, if Russia is to live up to its new reputation as a democratic beacon of the world, then it needs to show it with actions and not words.\n\nA more fringe view is that giving them too much freedom comes with a cost, and that allowing our allied states to contest Moscow can only lead to the dissolution of the Accord at some point.

The [RUS.GetNameDef], as the foremost democratic power in Europe, shall oversee the legitimacy and validity of these elections, of course, making it possible to guide them in a way we see fit.\n\nIt is important to note that many of the liberated states maintain similar constitutions and laws as their predecessors. In particular, as many were part of Germany's war against the Internationale, they retain a number of anti-socialist laws. Combined with red scare propaganda, this has made the chance of a far-left electoral victory in our client states next to null.\n\nBut with the International defeated, many in the State Duma are advocating for our oversight to be as great as possible. To simply maintain a broad alliance of democratic forces may not be enough to tie us together, so we need a truly ideological pact. This view has been contested by those who believe that there is no reason for this kind of interference. After all, Russia's status as a great power is practically ensured at this point, with no real threats left. It would be best if we looked inwards, rather than continuing on potentially scandalous foreign policy adventures."

 rusfla.144.t: "An Uneasy Future"
 rusfla.144.d: "Now one of the greatest Russian heroes of the 1900s, Vladimir Nikolayevich has been moulded into many things in the minds of the Russian public. A man of action, a dreamer who bravely fought for democracy even when his life was on the line - and, of course, the man who destroyed German imperialism. He is living proof that even the most run-of-the-mill man can become a star of the century.\n\nWhile this public image he has cultivated is certainly the way he would like to be portrayed, the reality has always been more complex. Before the war he would have a number of quarrels with army command - and now, despite his overwhelming popularity, he has been regularly criticised for his alliance with the Left Esers, who at best have conflicting views on the Internationale. Rikhter has largely bowed to the pressure, dismissing a number of left-wing cabinet members - but this has had the added effect of concentrating political power within the PSR even more than before.\n\nThe democracy of postwar Russia does not look like what the idealistic Rikhter envisioned it to be. The VPP, persecuted for their monarchist tendencies, has failed to make a serious comeback despite their endorsement of republicanism. The RDP is akin to a controlled opposition to the PSR, only differing on a number of issues. In the current political climate, only the Kadets can make a great stand against the PSR's dominance - but the latter has a clear legacy to work from that the other does not. In this way, Rikhter's presidency has not necessarily restored faith in democracy - but in the PSR, the new titan of Russian politics.\n\nThere is, of course, plenty to be proud of. The Russian Democratic Federative Republic is more free and strong than ever, and one of the greatest countries in the world. But is its future as bright as Rikhter has dreamt of it?\n\nThe answer is simple, boring, and disheartening: probably not."
 rusfla.144.a: "Things could always be better."

 rusfla.145.t: "Empire of the Middle-Earth"
 rusfla.145.d: "Now that Russia has a clear buffer against the decadent West, it is time to do the same for the two main powers of the East: the Chinese and Japanese. Some late Imperial officials had interests in expanding the Russian sphere of influence to the southeast, towards Xinjiang, Mongolia, and Manchuria - the idea being that they could prevent the growing power of our two eastern enemies, thus protecting our flank there.\n\nSavitsky's cabinet has revived this idea. The subjugation of Xinjiang and Mongolia to Moscow's will is not only materially beneficial, as to protect the Trans-Siberian Railway, but simply natural, as part of the Russian destiny to be an empire of Eurasia. As for Manchuria, the area is simply too important not to be under Russian rule. Having a firm grip on the area will firmly secure our frontier against the Chinese, give us access to an important warm water port, dominate the Korean Peninsula, and more.\n\nNaturally, this shall set us on an inevitable collision course with the great powers of the East, but this is one that we will be victorious in. The Russia of today runs like clockwork, properly centralised and prepared to engage in battle for the righteous and spiritual cause. Our battle will not be like the one of 1905 - where we, disorganised and lacking purpose, lost to an inferior foe. This will be the total humiliation of the mercantilist and bureaucratic East, who have opposed the Russian destiny for too long."
 rusfla.145.a: "The Khans would already be proud of us."

 rusfla.146.t: "Formation of Sorevraz"
 rusfla.146.d: "The Scouting movement spread to Russia in 1908, and multiple Scout-like organisations have been founded since. After the October Revolution, many Scouts aligned themselves with the Bolsheviks and created socialist youth organisations, which were abolished after the White victory in the Civil War. Now, with the re-establishment of a socialist government in Russia, the Congress of Soviets and Labour Unions issued a decree on the creation of the Union of Revolutionary Scouts, or 'SoRevRaz' for short, as part of the Russian Union of Socialist Youth. While obviously taking inspiration from the worldwide Scouting movement, this new organisation aims to educate the children with socialist teachings.\n\nOne of the most important parts of the decree is the creation of Sorevraz camps, where children can spend summer vacations and winter holidays free of charge, sponsored by the Trade Unions. The first Sorevraz camp, designated 'Sovyonok' ('Owlet'), is to be built on the Black Sea coast, in the Yekaterinodar region. Currently, the estimated capacity of the camp is 80 children, although there's potential for its expansion. The plans for the camp also include multiple amenities, like playgrounds for various outdoor activities, sports stadiums, and a film studio."
 rusfla.146.a: "The children will remember this summer as an everlasting one."

 rusfla.147.t: "Cain and Abel"
 rusfla.147.d: "Ivan Solonevich has ruled the country with an iron fist during the war, but as the common goals have been met, he has come under increasing fire behind the scenes. His attitude of smashing his way through politics is undoubtedly the core of his appeal - but it has also made him many enemies, even among his own allies. The worst rift opened today when none other than Ivan's own brother, Boris, attacked Chairman-Minister Solonevich in the pages of 'Sentinel'.\n\nThis appeal implied that Ivan Lukyanovich did not really respect the monarchy and was already trying to turn the Emperor into his puppet. In addition, they strongly criticised Solonevich's appointments to some government posts during the war, arguing that he often ignored talented men with whom he disagreed, although he claimed to believe in meritocratic government. And anyone who knew Ivan Solonevich could attest to the truth here - he was a very strong-willed man, spiteful to his enemies and rewarding to his allies.\n\nPerhaps Brother Boris held a grudge for being sidelined from power, as the Stabs-Captains under him had been placed under the Ministry of Internal Affairs as an official state organisation, robbing Boris of any independence. Perhaps he was really pointing out the hypocrisy of Ivan's policies for the good of Russia. As the text ended, 'Russia needs no other Vozhd than what Emperor Vladimir should be'."
 rusfla.147.a: "This is idiotic!"

 rusfla.148.t: "The Emperor's Intervention"
 rusfla.148.d: "Boris Solonevich and his allies had openly criticised Ivan Solonevich as a power-hungry hypocrite. This could not stand. Against the advice of the cooler heads, Ivan wrote his own piece, openly ridiculing his opponents in the party leadership. He called his brother an 'ungrateful fool,' Voytsekhovsky a 'spineless opportunist', and Dyukin a 'monarcho-communist'. It soon became clear to everyone that the highest echelons of power were engaged in an increasingly factionalised struggle of wills.\n\nThe Stabs-Captains organisation is largely loyal to its leader, Boris, although there is a growing pro-Ivan faction internally. General Turkul spoke out strongly in favour of Ivan Solonevich, questioning the intentions of this vocal opposition. But the most important voice came from the Emperor himself.\n\nVladimir met with his Chairman-Minister in the Senate Palace, perhaps for the first time as equals. He was an idolised monarch who was restoring Russian greatness, and Solonevich was being hounded by his former friends in a pointless, prideful struggle. The relationship between the two had always been deeply official and respectful, and there was no need to mention that if the Emperor wanted to favour the opposition instead, he was perfectly capable of doing so. But he spoke in veiled terms of national stability and the efficiency of the good Imperial government. In practice, the Emperor demanded Solonevich end this childish struggle, give in on some issues, and perhaps loosen the reins, if only symbolically.\n\nThis was an extremely hard pill for Ivan Solonevich to swallow - but in the end, he did not want to go against His Imperial Majesty. It was even harder to accept that Vladimir had finally found it in himself to actually oppose Solonevich - and to make it clear that he was not as necessary as the Emperor in this system that Solonevich himself had built."
 rusfla.148.a: "The strongman is humbled."

 rusfla.149.t: "The Crimean Question"
 rusfla.149.d: "To this day, Crimea remains the only major territory of Ukraine that is not mostly ethnic Ukrainian. Owing to its Russian plurality, there have been calls for a referendum so that Crimea may be part of Russia once again.\n\nThe local population would likely accept such a referendum, but we should ask if it's worth jeopardising our relations with our Ukrainian ally. Should we proceed with the referendum?"
 rusfla.149.a: "And as such, Sevastopol is in Russian hands again."
 rusfla.149.b: "This would just be plain chauvinism."

 rusfla.150.t: "A New Narrative of the War"
 rusfla.150.d: "When Russian troops entered Eastern Europe, there was a clear narrative from our enemy. German propaganda was quick to depict Russia as an aggressor, one hell-bent on imperial conquest and rife with irredentism. In many ways, they tried to depict the Russian as part of a lower civilisation - a society more in tune with the Mongol barbarians than with enlightened Europe. Germany was depicted as the defender of the European order and, in particular, national self-determination for all Europeans.\n\nThis narrative could only be properly defied once the Prussian hegemon finally fell. In schools, it is now being taught that, yes, Russian troops were first to open fire - but when one learns history and takes into account the pre-war situation, one can clearly see that Russia was the defender, not the aggressor. Countless times had Russia sought to negotiate with Berlin, and countless times she had been rejected. As Reichskanzler Bernhard von Bülow had once described Germany's foreign policy aims - that we do not want to put anyone into the shade, but we demand a place for ourselves in the sun - was it not true for Russia as well? To reunite with our brothers in Belarus and Ukraine, to be treated as an equal; these are all demands of a reasonable and righteous people.\n\nBut Germany, in all its arrogance, never saw Russia as anything but a barbarous land. Even in the face of the communist west, Germany refused to come to an agreement with the nation who saw the new path forward. In a brighter world, the communist threat could have been destroyed long ago - but that is not so.\n\nState propaganda largely focuses on the International as our common enemy, and there is little mention of who was responsible for the Great Patriotic War. After all, regardless of whether Russia is perceived favourably by the Germans, they only have one option: to accept the new reality in Europe."
 rusfla.150.a: "History is determined by the victors."

 rusfla.151.t: "Planning for the Reunification"
 rusfla.151.d: "The Reichskanzler met the [RUS_HeadOfExecutive] in Moscow today, in the first major diplomatic meeting between Russia and Germany since the end of the Great Patriotic War. Present with him were the most important figures in the reborn German general staff, Generals Friedrich Paulus and Erwin von Witzleben. The main topic of discussion was the division of Germany - in the east, a pro-German and sensible government was restored, while in the west, foreign actors propped up a Bolshevik bastardisation of a state. At some point in the future, the Reichskanzler stressed, the reunification of Germany will have to come about through pen or sword. The latter, though, was presented as the only option; the only thing communists understand is force, after all.\n\nThe Reichskanzler set out proposals for the rearmament of the German state with significant Russian aid, and arms deals that could bring the Heer back into a proper fighting force. There were no objections from the [RUS_HeadOfExecutive], but Paulus and von Witzleben mentioned plans of a pre-emptive strike into the communist-occupied German lands. With enough Russian and allied participation, perhaps a decisive victory could be achieved and the rival government destroyed, with the [RUS.GetFactionName] maintaining defensive positions after and forcing the International to accept the new reality.\n\nThis caught the [RUS_HeadOfExecutive] by surprise - he had doubts that a limited war was possible, believing that the International would fight to the bitter end, at the very least to preserve the pre-war status quo. While he reassured the German delegates that such plans would be considered, he still advocated a peaceful unification, viewing it as preferable.\n\nThough, in any case, we cannot really trust their intentions. It is clear that the Germans want a reunification soon, but is a strong German ally that is able to defy us really in our best interest? Even if a limited war was achievable, they have not forgotten the historical enmities. It is only rational to keep them on as short of a leash as possible, and deny any aspirations of another anti-Russian state rising up again."
 rusfla.151.a: "The Hun shall have leverage over us no more."

 rusfla.152.t: "The Question of German Leadership"
 rusfla.152.d: "The first elections in the German provisional government have been held - and with the expected results. The National Committee for a Free Germany, or NFD, won a clear majority of seats. With other German parties either fractured or dissolved, and their publications and campaigning often suppressed, the election had a clear ending. Still, it gave the new German government in Berlin a mandate.\n\nPolitically, the NFD is a hodgepodge of different forces. Members include much of the German right, not only from the former DVLP and DkP, but from Zentrum and other democratically-minded conservatives. Beyond that, the party includes some on the right end of the SPD, various non-partisans, and is especially popular among soldiers of the former Imperial Army. And the party's goals are simple: prepare for the unification and promote unity among all German peoples. Actual policy is secondary to these concerns.\n\nCuriously, those closest to Savinkov's ideology have actually found themselves on the sidelines. The German Socialist Party, or DSP, is practically the only openly Russophilic party in the new Germany, advocating a rebirth of the German state modelled on Savinkov's national populism. While they have made some electoral gains as of late, they were completely unable to contest the new hegemon of German politics.\n\nThe chairman of the DSP, Julius Streicher, has criticised the NFD for being a spineless band of pen-pushers and bureaucrats. The DSP has often secretly lobbied Russian government officials to rig the elections in their favour - which clearly fell on flat ears. As long as von Witzleben's administration heeds our word, we will have no need for these unpopular copycats."
 rusfla.152.a: "They can remain on the sidelines as they always have."

 rusfla.153.t: "Empire of the 20th Century"
 rusfla.153.d: "In 1917, even the idea of severing nations off the Russian Empire was unthinkable. But Kerensky's government recognised Polish independence and restored Finnish autonomy, not even mentioning removing limitations on Ukrainian and various other languages and cultures. For a long time, the White Movement was adamant: these regions were part of Russia, One and Indivisible.\n\nBut that was over twenty years ago, and it must be said that realities of the world have moved onwards. Nationalism is a genie that cannot be put back in the bottle. This is especially true for the Poles, who have suffered under a century of Russification and Germanisation virtually unscathed, 25 million people stubbornly drawing strength from their national identity and the Catholic faith. Even our most ardent nationalists rarely champion the annexation of Poland as any kind of serious goal.\n\nIn fact, Russian expansionism has never been so small-minded as to bother with some specific borders or some specific historical claims from medieval maps. No, these are the squabbles of the visionless Germans. Russia has never allowed borders, peoples or geography to stop its expansion. If we only cared for truly Slavic lands, we would need to abandon half of Siberia! No, Russian imperialism of the 20th century should be dictated by our goal of the dominance of the Eurasian continent, not by petty border squabbles or limitations based on a single ethnicity. And in our time, this often means that a grateful client state will serve our goals better than a rebellious province."
 rusfla.153.a: "For a Great Power, there is no room for sentimentalism."

 rusfla.154.t: "A Longing for the Free Land"
 rusfla.154.d.intro: "Cossacks in Russia have always been a privileged caste. With a large degree of autonomy during the times of the Empire, they considered themselves the true masters of the vast amount of rich lands on which their Cossack hosts were located.\nDuring the Civil War, the vast majority of Cossacks sided with the Whites. The Kuban and Don Republics were created to maintain a certain degree of independence. Although they had occasionally difficult relations with other White leaders, none of the Cossacks seriously sought independence from Russia, and so these republics were abolished as soon as the situation in the country stabilised. The Cossack hosts became autonomies once again, now within the RFDR."
 rusfla.154.d1: "$rusfla.154.d.intro$\n\nHowever, the Civil War unwittingly planted the seeds of Cossack nationalism, and all that was needed was the rain to make them sprout. The abolition of the Cossack autonomies led to a number of riots, which the authorities were forced to suppress. Now, after a few years of debate, the Cossacks seem to have found a goal to strive for - the creation of Cossackia.\nA few months ago, a magazine of the same name was published in Novocherkassk, edited by Ignat Bilyi and Vasily Glazkov. Glorifying the leaders of the anti-Russian Cossack revolts of the past, such as Bulavin and Nekrasov, the magazine promotes Cossack culture and the full independence of the Southern Russian Cossacks as a completely separate federal country. Although immediately banned by the authorities, 'Cossackia' continued to be published underground and managed to attract several groups of nationalistically minded young Cossacks, although few would believe that the idea could gain any serious popularity among the mainstream Cossack population."

 rusfla.155.t: "The Flight of the Karelians"
 rusfla.155.d: "The population of the ceded Karelia consists of around one tenth of the total Finnish population - around 400,000 people, including residents of our second largest city, Viipuri. With the annexation of the region into Russia, the almost exclusively Finnish Lutheran former population was offered Russian citizenship. A very small portion accepted the offer, as many still remembered the periods of Russification from 1899 to 1917, and had zero faith in Russian guarantees of respecting the rights of the local population.\n\nThis has created a significant refugee crisis in the rest of Finland, as houses and work must be found for the Karelians. A system has been created to divide the burden as equally as possible between different regions, albeit the Swedish-speaking municipalities were able to gain the special right of buying their way out of the duty to settle the Karelians. Everywhere else, new land is being cleared to found small farms for the Karelians, and haphazard temporary living quarters have been arranged in all major cities."
 rusfla.155.a: "The state needs to support them as much as possible."
 rusfla.155.b: "It is tragic, but we cannot do much else to help."

 rusfla.156.t: "The Old Believers"
 rusfla.156.d: "The Old Believers or the Old Ritualists are a significant religious minority in Russia, and ironically the 20th century has treated them relatively well. The schism within the Russian Orthodox Church traces back to Patriarch Nikon's reforms in the 17th century. Those who did not accept the changes to the Rite became the Old Believers, a persecuted minority of Christians who consider themselves alone to uphold the old, true tradition of the Orthodox Church. They hold on to the oldest Christian traditions from the Byzantine Church, opposing every change to it.\n\nThe religious persecution and legal restrictions on these 'Schismatics' were ended with the 1906 law on religious tolerance, and ultimately in 1917 all restrictions on any religious creed were removed. In the republic, Russia's five million Old Believer communities were finally able to organise public religious processions and enjoy the same rights as other Christian communities in Russia. Due to the history of persecution, they have settled many faraway frontiers of Russia - the Transbaikal region, Karelia, and various rural communities dotted across the country. Despite their numbers, Old Believers tend to be insular and remain away from political life, preferring to isolate themselves in simple rural communities."
 rusfla.156.a: "At least they have dedication."

 rusfla.157.t: "Extremist Coup in Riga"
 rusfla.157.d: "The situation in the so-called 'United Baltic Duchy' is receiving significant press in Russia. Svoboda, the newspaper of the SZRS, has detailed the recent ultra-reactionary coup. The Baltic Territorial Army, aided by the pan-Germanic and fundamentalist Baltic Brotherhood, has deposed the government, vowing to annihilate the Forest Brothers' uprising.\n\nUnsurprisingly, their takeover was accompanied by horrible atrocities against the Latvian and Estonian people - and without any civilian oversight, the Baltic military is accountable to nobody. The news has been sensationalised by reports of Latvians escaping for their lives across the border, and popular outrage is high - so much so that even Savinkov himself has addressed the situation. He emphasised the Dvinsk Autonomous Region as proof that in Russia, it is not simply ethnic Russians who are free, but all peoples - and that the new Baltic regime, even more so than before, is the most clear indicator of the ethnic supremacism and slavery of the Germanic world."
 rusfla.157.a: "Rüdiger von der Goltz and his cronies will be hanged one day!"

 rusfla.158.t: "The Elusive Panthera"
 rusfla.158.d: "A small group of Ingush rebels has made their largest attack yet, ambushing Gosstrazha-directed military convoys on the bridge over the Sharo-Argun river. The attack was led by the famed Abrek couple, Laysat Baysarova and Akhmetkhan Baysarov. Obviously, the writing of the achievements of these mountain bandits is forbidden, but the word has been spreading nonetheless. The couple - one Ingush, one Chechen - have only risen in fame and became shining stars of the Mountain people's independence movement.\n\nAbreks are usually held as mere bandits by Russian authorities, but they have been leading the Ingush-Chechen struggle against the Russians for a century now. An Abrek is a lost man - one who has given up civilian life, normal human connections, and lives a pious life in the wild mountains of North Caucasus and has dedicated his life in the fight with the Russians. Abreks have been among the leading figures of all North Caucasus unrest, and the mountains have made it difficult to ever catch catch them. And consequently, they have become heroes to the locals.\n\nAlready hundreds of stories circulate about the deadly sniper Laysat and her fight against the Svobodniks together with her husband. It is clear that this path can only end tragically for them, but as long as it continues, our men will fear going into the mountains."
 rusfla.158.a: "But death will find them eventually."

 rusfla.159.t: "Remembering Nezhentsev"
 rusfla.159.d: "Much could have been lost if the Assault on Yekaterinodar had gone differently. The Volunteer Army had just arrived from its harrowing march across the Kuban; they then assaulted Yekaterinodar, the capital of the Kuban Soviet Republic in April 1918. The whites were greatly outnumbered and as shells fell sometimes within 100 metres of General Kornilov, they continued their siege against the Red forces commanded by Ivan Sorokin.\n\nThe battle was horrifyingly brutal around the city. In the night, General-Lieutenant Boris Kazanovich was able to find a gap in the enemy defences, and rallied his cavalry of the Partisan Regiment into the city. The closest unit, the Shock Regiment (later Kornilovites) was messaged, and its commander, Colonel Mitrofan Nezhentsev - already wounded multiple times in bloody fighting - rallied the core of Shock Regiment into one last attack. Nezhentsev, already mortally wounded, was able to keep command of the unit, and a combined attack by the Shock Regiment and the Partisan Regiment led to collapse of the Red defences in the southern outskirts of the city. Harkening back to the Osowiec's 'Attack of the Dead Men", the beaten and battered regiment under Nezhentsev succeeded in their last ditch assault. The colonel himself succumbed to his wounds only hours after his men managed to connect with Kazanovich's unit.\n\nThe fall of Yekaterinodar in April 1918 was, to many, the first ray of hope that the Bolsheviks could be defeated. General Kornilov and most of the Volunteer Army lived to see the next day, thanks to this small miracle in the battlefield. To remember Colonel Nezhentsev, a memorial statue of him will be raised in the main square of Yekaterinodar."
 rusfla.159.a: "How much blood has this black earth claimed?"

 rusfla.160.t: "History of the Second Civil War"
 rusfla.160.d: "How are we to look at the events that were called the 'Great Patriotic War' by President Savinkov and his propaganda machine? In Russian historiography, various views have emerged without a clear consensus.\n\nSome historians emphasise that a repeat of the Russo-German war was, in fact, hopeless, and even if successful, it would have led to the dominance of socialism all over Western Europe, a price too large for the world to pay. These historians argue that it was a great folly for Savinkov to ever cooperate with the socialist bloc, or hope for its victory. Consequently, the Russian Free Army is seen as the genuine 'Whites', who chose to oppose socialism and fight for faith and fatherland, even if in feldgrau. The legacy of the RSA will remain controversial, but no one can deny that they fought for basic human decency and freedom.\n\nThe other view is well capsulated in Eduard Burdzhalov's 'History of the Second Civil War', which focuses on the self-destructive tendency of the White Russia, and views this second war - the second national catastrophe - as a natural consequence of militarism and capitalism that the White movement supported. He is similarly critical towards the Free Russian Army, and seeks to construct the Russian 20th century history as essentially a cycle of tragedy that could have only been broken by repairing the inherent authoritarianism in the pre-Tsarist system. As Burdzhalov argues, this authoritarianism was merely suppressed by the republican governments, but in essence it was again resurfaced when Boris Savinkov took power. The alliance of Capitalism and Militarism has always resulted in wars and will always result in them, which includes the entirety of Russian history."
 rusfla.160.d2: "How are we to look at the events that were called 'Great World Revolution' by the socialist government and their propaganda machine? In Russian historiography, various views have emerged without a clear consensus.\n\nSome historians emphasise that a repeat of the Russo-German war was, in fact, hopeless, and even if successful, it would have led to the dominance of socialism all over Western Europe, a price too large for the world to pay. These historians argue that socialism was and always will be inherently self-destructive, proven by the failed war. Consequently, the Russian Free Army were the genuine 'Whites', who chose to oppose socialism and fight for faith and fatherland, even if in feldgrau. The legacy of the RSA will remain controversial - but they were on the right side of History.\n\nThe other view is especially pronounced in Eduard Burdzhalov's 'History of the Second Civil War', which portrays the late events as a very clear ideological repeat of 1917-1921. Like then, the Russian revolution, fighting for freedom of all peoples, was strangled to death by the capital-backed reactionary movement (Russian Free Army) enabled by the German military-industrial complex. In his Marxist view, history is a cycle of battle between those who own and those who do not, and the latest war where Third International was crushed to the ground was only the latest in a long series of atrocities committed in the name of Capital."

 rusfla.161.d: "With Russian men fighting for the fate of the Motherland, women remain in support duties, chiefly staffing hospitals and radio stations. There have been rising voices promoting the idea of a new women's military unit, in the legacy of Maria Bochkaryova's Women's Battalion of Death. Despite the failures of the unit, it continues to inspire some more radical politicians within our party.\n\n[RUS_GetArmyChief] reported that under pressure from politicians he has organised the Separate Women's Volunteer Infantry Brigade, but in the meantime he established strict physical standards and sent them to the rear for military training, which, in his words, 'God knows, they will need'. [RUS_GetArmyChief] at the last meeting with the [RUS_HeadOfExecutive] categorically refused to send women to the frontline, instead preferring to keep them in a support role.\n\nFor now, we have several options for how to resolve the issue: allow the Separate Women's Volunteer Infantry Brigade to complete their training and send it to the frontline (regardless of the warnings of the military experts that this is a terrible idea); reassign women to the support personnel, which will relieve men from these positions; or simply outright admit that women have no place near the frontlines, and should contribute to the war effort in the factories instead."

 rusfla.162.t: "By This Sign, Conquer"
 rusfla.162.d: "The Russian Army in many parts is the heir of the Imperial Army and bears many regalia and traditions of the latter - uniforms, battle standards and even battle priests who serve together with soldiers.\n\nRussian uniforms were reformed in the 1920s. The service dress uniform, which is also used as a parade dress, includes a military jacket with an attached embroidered collar, the shoulder straps (or epaulettes) as well as a fancy, coloured lapel fastened to the chest. Some units have permission to wear even fancier 'coloured' uniforms, originating from the Volunteer Army and worn with pride. At the same time, battle dress uniforms are the epitome of practicality - a khaki-coloured gymnastyorka with a stand-up collar, muted shoulder straps and khaki-coloured Galliffet trousers. Officers wear peaked caps at all times (except in winter), a soldier's uniform includes peaked caps only in the service dress uniform, and side caps in the battle dress one. In peacetime soldiers should use kirza boots, in wartime it's insisted to wear derby shoes with wraps.\n\nAnother tradition of the Imperial Army, the Holy Image of the Saviour Not-Made-by-Hands, remains the symbol of the army. Under this icon Aleksandr Nevsky marched to fight the Teutons, Dmitry Donskoy defeated the Golden Horde at Kulikovo Field, and the Moscow army stopped Khan Akhmat on the Ugra ensuring the independence of Russia. For all units, the Holy Image of the Saviour Not-Made-by-Hands is woven on the front side of the battle standard, and above the icon is the inscription 'GOD IS WITH US'. Alternative religious signs (such as the star and crescent) are permitted in some units, but as exceptions to the rules. The standards differ from a regiment to a regiment by colour - such as red for infantry, blue for cavalry and Cossacks, black for armored units and artillery and so on."

 rusfla.162.b: "Napoleonic nonsense!"

 rusfla.163.t: "Away with the Imperial Regalia"
 rusfla.163.d: "Commander [RUS_GetArmyChief] has initiated reforms to the military uniforms, abandoning most of the Imperial-era regalia in favour of simplification. Although ceremonial dress still retains some of the spirit of the Napoleonic era, epaulettes have been abandoned in favour of more common shoulder straps, and the service dress has been changed to be closer to modesty of the battle dress. There has been a further simplification of the uniform, such as the removal of chest pockets from the soldier's uniform and the replacement of the soldier's boots with derby shoes.\n\nThe battle standards were also simplified and instead of the Holy Image of the Saviour Not-Made-by-Hands or other religious signs, a Russian eagle on a red cloth was installed as a standard for all units. Although these changes were initially met with resistance from most of the military, the end result greatly simplified the production of uniforms and standards, allowing the freed-up industry to be directed to more important matters. At the same time, subsequent changes in the military code establish an address to higher ranks in the form of 'comrade commander' and significantly reduce the role of priests in the military units."
 rusfla.163.a: "Out with the Kornilovite clowns."

 rusfla.164.t: "War of Motors and Horses"
 rusfla.164.d: "Russia, unlike Europe, cannot boast of a dense network of paved roads. But cavalry does not need highways; it is capable of traversing even wooded areas, without the need for gasoline or spare parts. Despite the advancing motorisation and mechanisation, horses remain an important method of transportation across Russia, including the military. The State Factory Stables have developed a new cultural herd technology for horse breeding, which made it possible in a very short time to standardize a significant number of crossbred horses for specific military purposes. The military subsidies for the stud farms increased the horse production into scale unprecedented compared to other European countries.\n\nMost cavalry units are tasked with reconnaissance and raiding enemy territory, acting as dragoons or mounted infantry. But they are also trained to fight in close combat on horseback. Even 'lava' formation attacks - a mass attack of an entire unit on horseback at a gallop - are used if the commander believes that the situation is favourable for such an attack.\n\n The armament of a cavalryman depends on the unit he is in: a cavalry squadron includes a sabre, an anti-tank and a machine gun platoons. Those placed in sabre platoons receive a carbine and a sabre, often using pistols as their second weapon. The rest, in addition to small arms and sabres, learn to use their own weapons: anti-tank rifles, machine guns or mortars. As a new development, first cavalry-mechanised groups (KMGs) have been formed, consisting of armour, trucks and cavalry, intended to act as a rapid exploitation force in tandem with mechanised units."
 rusfla.164.a: "Ride, ride, ride!"
 rusfla.164.b: "What a remnant of medieval times."

 rusfla.165.t: "Mountain Rifles"
 rusfla.165.d: "The need for special mountaineer training of soldiers first arose in the 1840s, when the Imperial Army encountered the troops of Imam Shamil in Dagestan. Mobile and adapted to the fighting in the mountains, the locals waged an efficient hit-and-run resistance. Now, the mountain units of the Russian Army draw a good third of their soldiers from the inhabitants of the North Caucasus. Their main part has been serving as peace-keeping and garrison forces in the OSKAB.\n\nThe recent decision of the Stavka has changed the approach to the training of mountain riflemen in preparation for a likely larger war in Europe. From 1935 onwards, the mountain infantry and cavalry began to undergo training for combat operations in rugged and wooded terrain, and divisions received new mountain guns and mortars and gear specifically made for military mountaineering. The new training regime emphasises physical performance, which included mountaineering and snowshoeing.\n\nA notable advocate for the Mountain Rifles is the famous athlete-alpinist, poruchik Aleksandr Ignatyevich Sidorenko - a former Cossack who joined a mountain cavalry regiment. The New School of Military Mountaineering and Skiing (ShVAGLD) was founded based on poruchik Sidorenko's proposal to the Stavka, with Sidonerko himself as the climbing instructor for the forces."

 rusfla.166.t: "Shtrafniks Are Going Into Battle"
 rusfla.166.d: "Company-sized penal units were already formed in the beginning of the war, but only with the issuance of Order No. 323, penal units grew into the size of brigades (of varying combat strenght), usually being attached to regular divisions or corps. Shtrafbrigs (penal brigades) play a role in sectors of the front where extreme courage and recklessness are required. The life of a shtrafnik (penalised soldier) is often measured in one or two such attacks.\n\nThe officers of penal brigades are professional soldiers, clean before the law. The rank-and-file of the brigades consist of soldiers and officers convicted of crimes. The service in a penal brigade is only 3 months - but given how dangerous their tasks are, many do not make it through. Those who earn military awards are released, with their ranks and rights restored, and in the case of death, their families are given a pension on a general basis. This gives them an incentive to do their best, against the scorn of the rest of the army. Most of them will die in a muddy ditch or a minefield - but those few who do survive have everything to win."
 rusfla.166.a: "Many of you will die, but it is a sacrifice I am willing to make."

 rusfla.167.t: "Volunteer Battalions of Death"
 rusfla.167.d: "The day was is finally here. It is finally time for the struggle that our Instructor-Volunteers have preached for in the army, what the SZRS has been instilling in the minds of the soldiers. And nowhere is this spirit as strong as in the newly mobilised Volunteer Battalions in every division. They are composed of the best of the best, card-carrying SZRS members who fear neither to kill or to die. The Volunteer Battalions have been trained and equipped as shock infantry, equipped with steel cuirasses and submachine guns.\n\nParty propaganda has already made those serving in Volunteer Battalions into true Knights of Terror: carrying the Adam's Head on their caps and helmets and distinguished by black-and-red shoulder straps, these soldiers march under flags with the slogans 'We'll Die for the Motherland' and 'Win or Die'.\n\nWhile the Stavka has been annoyed at political meddling in the army, they have ultimately came to accept these 'Battalions of Death' as merely another tool in the commander's arsenal. They lack discipline away from combat, but in battle they can be relied on, if nothing else but to die fanatically."
 rusfla.167.a: "And they were given authority over the earth, to kill with sword and with famine."

 rusfla.168.t: "The Atrocities of the Volunteers"
 rusfla.168.d: "The morning in the Kremlin began chaotically. At 6 o'clock, a representative of the Stavka very rudely demanded that the president should organise a meeting with General-Fieldmarshal [RUS_GetArmyChief] as quickly as possible. Arriving at the Stavka a few hours later, Savinkov - expecting to hear news of some kind of military catastrophe - learned that it was not a matter of war, but of the actions of one of the Svobodnik Volunteer Battalions. A few weeks ago, after one of the battles, the army managed to surround a fairly large number of enemy forces. Because of the situation on the frontline, the military did not have time to escort prisoners to the rear and transferred this task to the 135th Volunteer Battalion under the command of the SZRS Commissar Vladimir Brand.\n\nBrand contacted the local Gosstrazha commander Aleksandr Andreyev to ask for directions and was told that the nearby prisoner camps were already full, and there were issues at organising train transport given the supply situation. The Gosstrazha commander told Brand to 'deal with the problem'. Brand contacted local SZRS leadership and asked for a confirmation for the order, and was told that, as the Gosstrazha is responsible for the management of the prison system, the party fully agrees with their decisions.\n\nHearing that, Brand and his men armed themselves with captured German weapons and went to the nearby forest with almost 5,000 prisoners, where they were gunned down into a small ravine. After the site of the massacre was discovered by military scouts, Brand was faced with the army commander and admitted that he received orders from his superiors and carried them out in the way that seemed most appropriate for the situation. As a result, 4,842 prisoners of war (mostly soldiers from Eastern Europe) were shot from German weapons in the frontline zone. [RUS_GetArmyChief] is furious and insists on punishing those responsible for such an atrocity, for the sake of military honour."
 rusfla.168.a: "Cover it up, and blame the Germans."

 rusfla.169.t: "The Shturmoviks"
 rusfla.169.d: "The shock units of Russian Army trace their origin to the bloody siege of Moscow in 1920, where whites formed Shturmoviks (stormtroopers) of their own, armed with grenades and wire-cutters, to storm through the defences of the capital. Our best infantrymen are allocated into regimental special assault groups, with the doctrine favouring either the cover of smoke or of darkness as the assault units storm enemy strongpoints with armour and artillery support.\n\nAs this has proven to be insufficient against fortified positions in Eastern Europe, the Stavka has assigned a number of officers to reform the assault units into something better fit to modern war. The first proposal would be transforming them into Assault Engineer-Sapper Battalions (ShISB). These units would focus on technological supremacy, and work essentially as specialised combat engineers and sappers, supported by their own armoured vehicles equipped with flamethrowers and bridging equipment.\n\nThe ShISB proposal comes largely from engineer officers. The competing proposal comes largely from infantry officers: to form Separate Assault Rifle Battalions (OShSB), essentially elite infantry battalions. Instead of expensive additional equipment, the focus is to be put on training and morale, picking the best of the best and giving them the tools - steel cuirasses, submachine guns and automatic rifles to finish the task, first into the breach and the last to retreat."

 rusfla.170.t: "The Heart of the Army"
 rusfla.170.d: "The Guards, created in 1930 as a part of Kornilov's military reforms, are the brainchild of General Denikin. Unlike the Imperial Guard, these units are meant not to be the 'ceremonial troops', but a true elite force. Particularly notable are the 'First Four' Guards divisions, formed on the basis of the four 'coloured' divisions of the Civil War - the 1st Officer (Markovite), the 2nd Assault (Kornilovite), the 3rd Romanian (Drozdovites) and the 5th (Alekseyevites) divisions. Still retaining the honour of wearing their own dress uniforms, they are the elite of the Russian army alongside with the 4th 'Iron' division. The fully volunteer-based Guards units receive the best equipment, follow the harsh training regime developed under General Kutepov, and receive the best payment for their service. Before the rank of a guardsmen stands the word 'Guard' - (such as 'Guard Private' or 'Guard Colonel'), and in their uniform they wear special regalia - the double-headed eagle.\n\nGuardsmen, in addition to advanced physical training, undergo advanced training courses in tactics and military-technical sciences. There is also a strong tradition of Guards officers organising informal classes on etiquette, literature, music and dance, holding that Guardsmen are not only soldiers, but gentlemen and examples to the rest of the army, espousing the finest chivalric virtues of the Imperial army. Of course, part of it is propaganda, part is vanity. but there is an element of truth to it, and the Guards do genuinely hold a respected position in society, stemming from two decades of worship of the Volunteer Army and its legacy. Their critics within the army expect these ideas of chivalry to soon fail, as the first assault against German machine gun fire starts."

 rusfla.171.t: "Repetition is the Mother of Skill"
 rusfla.171.d: "Throughout the existence of the Russian Army, there were two ways to become an officer: either start serving as a private and rise to the rank of officer (praporshchik), or graduate from a Cadet school (so-called Yunkers). Previously, NCOs could take courses in several Officer Schools, such as the famous Oranienbaum Officer School or Novocherkassk Cavalry School and after successful completion receive the rank of poruchik (lieutenant). The other group of officers came from families of officers, businessmen and civil servants who enrolled their children (usually under the age of ten) in Cadet schools, informally called 'Yunker' schools. Many of these schools date back to the Imperial era and are held in high regard.\n\nGraduates from Alekseyev's (former Aleksey's), Dukhonin's (former Aleksandr's), Kutuzov's (former Pavel's) and Suvorov's (former Nikolay's) Military Schools are considered the best and brightest officers, brought up always holding the interests of the country above their own fate. Along with them are graduates of the Nakhimov Naval School (formerly the Naval Cadet School), organised under the personal patronage of Admiral Kolchak. Other less prestigious Military Schools often specialise in a particular field, such as the Petrograd Military School with its specialisation in the air force, or the Kazan Military School, which specialises in mechanised and armored forces. Officers wishing to occupy staff or senior command positions were required to take command courses at the All-Russian General Staff Academy in Moscow (formed on the basis of the Nikolay's Military Academy).\n\nAs part of Golovin's reform, non-commissioned officers will now be able to enroll in the Military Schools alongside Cadets, essentially standardising this formerly two-class military education into single system, accessible to any talented soldier regardless of background. Additionally, Officer Schools will be created as a level between Military Schools and the General Staff Academy, which brings our military education system finally on par with the Germans in training of staff officers."
 rusfla.171.a: "The new generation will prove their merit."

 rusfla.172.t: "Germany Begs For Peace"
 rusfla.172.d: "Russia is on the cusp of victory, and now, even Berlin knows it. Not long ago, they have requested the appearance of the Russian ambassador in a neutral state, to begin peace talks.\n\nOur demands were simple: recognition of Russian sovereignty over the territories ceded in Brest-Litovsk and reparations. These points were generally agreed upon by both sides, but the German delegation seemed shocked when our ambassador proposed a military alliance that would allow Russian troops on German soil, as well as a reduction in the size of the Imperial army.\n\nThis proved to be the breaking point, and negotiations fell apart soon after. It seems the Hun had too much pride, even when the threat of a communist takeover of their country was the only other option."
 rusfla.172.d2: "Russia is on the cusp of victory, and now, even Berlin knows it. Not long ago, they have requested the appearance of the Russian ambassador in a neutral state, to begin peace talks.\n\nBut before any such move was made, President Savinkov dismissed the idea outright, saying that only a total, unconditional surrender of German forces would be accepted. The Russian triumph over the Germanic civilisation cannot be achieved through pen, but only by blood and sword.\n\nThere will be no peace. Not until Russia - and only Russia - can determine the outcome of it."

 rusfla.174.t: "War of the Basmachi Goes On"
 rusfla.174.d: "What was left of the Turkestani rebels have regrouped in Torkestan Range and the Hindu Kush mountains under command of Junaid Khan. There are various other groups, some finding refuge from the Chinese side of the border in the Tianshan Mountains. From these friendly mountain bases, the rebels have been launching raids deep into our territory, attacking our military units and centres of administration.\n\nTheir doomed fight continues to inspire men to join their cause, promising that one day Turkestan shall once more be free."
 rusfla.174.a: "And more blood shall flow."

 rusfla.175.t: "Nebuchadnezzar, Hadrian, Savinkov"
 rusfla.175.d: "The names of Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, Antiochus of the Greeks, and the dreaded Hadrian of Rome are whispered in fear and anger, for they have inflicted untold suffering upon the Jewish people. The 'wandering nation', scattered across gentile lands, never truly believed their days of tribulation were over. Yet, they could scarcely imagine that another name would join the infamous list of their oppressors: Boris Savinkov, the Vozhd of Russia.\n\nThe era of kings and emperors issuing cruel decrees was thought to be a relic of the past. Jewish emancipation had swept across Europe just a few generations ago, and the revolution had finally toppled the Tsars, promising a new era of peace for the oppressed.\n\nBut as the dust settles on the ruins of Europe, old Polania lies in ashes, and so do the great cities of Sevastopol, Minsk, Belostok, Vilnius, and Riga. A black cloud of death and plunder has reduced them to rubble. Reports of violence and barbarism, surpassing even the chaos of the Weltkrieg, are emerging from eastern Europe, now under Russian control once more.\n\nAll seems lost. Most politically active Jews of the former 'Oststaaten' have fled the Russian onslaught, and those who remain face a grim future. Yet, the word now being whispered is 'perseverance'. After all, the Jewish people have outlived single men and entire empires. Why not Svobodnik Russia?"
 rusfla.175.a: "Perhaps one day, he too will fade into history."

 rusfla.176.t: "The Casting of the Lots"
 rusfla.176.d: "The Vozhd has finally acted. The Moscow Civil Police headed by Anastasy Vonsyatsky, after 'extensive investigations', have released an extensive list of 'German collaborators', accused of plotting to overthrow Savinkov and establish a 'Bolshevik regime'. This list prominently features politically active Jews in Russia, accused of espionage for both the Germans and the Communards, aiding the German economic takeover, and facilitating the 'moral degeneration' of Russia.\n\nThe authorities quickly moved to freeze and confiscate the assets of Aleksandr Günzburg, a wealthy patron of the Association of Russian Hebrews, derogatorily called 'Alexander von Günzburg' by Svobodnik-aligned press. The government has also decreed the immediate dissolution of the Association, labeling it a hostile entity. Militias affiliated with the Svobodniks have reportedly 'aided' the police in uncovering traitors, often subjecting them to particularly brutal violence with the complicity and even aid of police officers, though the government denies involvement in such events.\n\nAnticipating the crackdown, Aleksandr Günzburg and his immediate family fled to the Netherlands the day before, much to the police's frustration. The Jewish community in Russia watches in horror as their worst fears come to life."
 rusfla.176.a: "The lot has been cast."

 rusfla.177.t: "The Old New Russian Republic"
 rusfla.177.d: "Maklakov's return to the presidency took many by surprise, while others felt a sense of relief. Perhaps the silent majority, repulsed by Savinkov's authoritarianism, turned back to the known quantity of President Maklakov. The recently re-opened Association of Russian Hebrews could not be more pleased, as its members are known supporters of the Kadets.\n\nOutside the bourgeois-dominated Association, younger activists feel disheartened, having hoped that the democratic restoration would usher in a more left-wing government. However, it seems inevitable that the democratic restoration would ultimately be conservative in nature, a reflexive return to the status quo. Nevertheless, the vast majority of Russian Jews simply wished for the end of SZRS rule and are content with the return of the Kadets. Maklakov, personally popular within the Jewish community since his defence of Menachem Beilis in 1905, is seen as an 'old friend' of the Jews of Russia as well.\n\nDespite this, there are whispers that even with Savinkov's departure, Russia is inexorably marching towards a confrontation with Germany. In such a scenario, many fear that Eastern Europe, home to millions of Jews, will once again become a battlefield, subject to the whims of the Russian Army, regardless of how tolerant and progressive the government at home may appear."
 rusfla.177.a: "Perhaps a return to the old was needed."

 rusfla.178.t: "The Jew of the Emperor's Court"
 rusfla.178.d: "When the Russian monarchy was restored, conservatives across the nation rejoiced. However, when it came to the moment of truth, they could not convert this momentum into electoral gains. The stalwarts of Russian politics, particularly the Right Socialist-Revolutionaries, retained their strength. What was even more surprising was the appointment of Ilya Fondaminsky, a Jew and an avowed 'Christian Democrat', as Chairman-Minister.\n\nFondaminsky was relatively unknown within the Jewish community. Upon his appointment, the Jewish press ran headlines detailing his life story and explaining how one could simultaneously be a Jew and close to the Church. Jokes quickly emerged, suggesting that Chairman-Minister Fondaminsky might be the world's most successful assimilationist since Flavius Josephus. Others noted the irony of Russia's first democratically elected Jewish head of government being elected under a restored monarchy, which the Jewish community had supported abolishing.\n\nDespite this, 'hopeful' would best describe the general sentiment within the Jewish community. Many are optimistic that this unusual new Chairman-Minister will not succumb to the political machinations of either the left or the right. Politically astute commentators and journalists were quick to warn of a 'militarist' miasma without pointing fingers at anyone. Furthermore, it is argued in activist groups that Fondaminsky's appointment might merely be a façade to distract the people from the looming drums of war."

 rusfla.179.t: "The Sevastopol Trials"
 rusfla.179.d: "All is not well in the recently liberated city of Sevastopol, known for its peculiar character and even more peculiar politics. Long before 1917, it was considered a bastion of Jewish intellectualism and political thought. Sevastopol, alongside Kiev, was the headquarters of many Jewish political movements, with the Ukrainian Jewish Democratic Party being one of the most prominent recent examples.\n\nHowever, under the re-established Russian authority, there are relentless efforts to extinguish that flame. With the initial wave of violence by Russian soldiers having subsided, what remains of the Jews of Ukraine now faces prolonged oppression—oppression by legislation, police, and litigators. The [RUS.GetRulingParty] government swiftly launched a vast campaign to 'root out lingering Bolshevism and Germanism in the liberated lands'. This campaign quickly targeted Jews, especially in Sevastopol, Kiev, and Minsk, but also in many other cities.\n\nThis 'legal anti-semitism' has resulted in the imprisonment and deportation of Jewish civil and cultural leaders and the forced disbandment of every Jewish political party still active. The older generation express frustration, seeing this new regime as no different from the Tsarist regime of old. Others believe that the targeting of Jews is a deliberate move to give ethnic Russians, Ukrainians, and Belarussians a common enemy, aiding in the 'reintegration' efforts of the [RUS.GetNameDef]. Most simply shrug or flee."
 rusfla.179.a: "The clock turns back."

 rusfla.180.t: "It's February Yet Again"
 rusfla.180.d: "February 1917—etched in history as the downfall of the 'eternal' Tsarist regime. Like a storm at sea, the revolution's ripples quickly reached the Jewish sphere, giving rise to myriad political forces eager to address the woes of Jews now under new rulers in the so-called 'Oststaaten'. Since then, Jewish engagement in civil life has dramatically increased, with political parties catering to the Jewish minority emerging as a significant force in eastern Europe.\n\nThose accustomed to the new status quo were unprepared for 'another February' to sweep across eastern Europe. Yet another dramatic shift in two and a half decades seemed inconceivable, but with the Russian victory over Germany, it is now a reality.\n\nDespite numerous reports of violence by the Russian Army against Jews during the conflict, the government swiftly reaffirmed its commitments to minority rights and religious freedom, and eventually, the storm passed. The return of peace brings another question: where to from here?\n\nAmong the first to act was the liberal Ukrainian Jewish Democratic Party, now known simply as the Jewish Democratic Party, which united with the Jewish Democratic Union from Minsk to reaffirm their commitment to the [RUS.GetNameDef]. Despite their support primarily coming from Jews in the liberated territories, the Jews in Petrograd and Moscow seem largely disinterested. In practice, these Jewish parties shape up to be tertiary players in Russian politics, often allied with the [RUS.GetRulingParty]."
 rusfla.180.a: "A multiethnic republic?"

 rusfla.181.t: "The Anti-Ukrainian Terror"
 rusfla.181.d: "There are few places in Svobodnik Russia as unsafe as the recaptured Ukrainian regions. With USNS attacks increasing and the International now clearly the Russian archenemy, the situation on the border is deteriorating by the day. The Ukrainian branch of the SZRS has issued orders to “crush the communist insurgency by any means necessary,” and the Ministry of Internal Affairs has been recruiting collaborators to serve as paramilitary forces and assist the Russian army.\n\nAnd their approach was nothing if not brutal. Without any serious oversight from Moscow, the paramilitary units allied with the USZRS have begun their vigorous hunt for suspected communist sympathisers. There have been anecdotal reports of crimes committed by these paramilitary units, with entire villages being emptied or burned to the ground in search of USNS fighters. The historically Jewish communities in Ukraine, in particular, are often being suspected of being “separatist hotbeds” by the authorities.\n\nThe central government in Moscow has added fuel to the fire by constantly emphasising the “dangerous” situation in the Ukrainian lands. Although it is not said explicitly, and the facade of Russian-Ukrainian brotherhood is maintained in propaganda, the central idea becomes clear and the stereotypes are created: to be Ukrainian is to be a communist, an ideological evil with which there can be no negotiation."
 rusfla.181.a: "When will it end?"

 rusfla.182.t: "Dos Naye Rusland"
 rusfla.182.d: "Following the triumphant seizure of power by the working class, the revolutionary storm has now swept across one of the most downtrodden peoples of the former Empire: the Jews. While dwarfed in size by their brethren in the Pale of Settlement who are still under German occupation, the Jews of Russia have struck off their chains, freeing themselves from the dual chains of Svobodnism and Capitalism. While some among the middle-class and the intelligentsia feared a bloody wave of Red Terror, or worse, a return to the White Army's Pogroms, the successful consolidation of the revolution has been met with a steady uproarious roar of approval from the working class; across the town squares and in the neighbourhoods, the dual anthems of the Workers' Marseillaise and The Internationale are sung in joyous Yiddish and Hebrew.\n\nThat being said, the revolutionaries of Russian Jewry are not necessarily united in their opinions on the revolution's direction and have divided themselves into numerous workers' parties that have loosely arranged themselves within the Workers' Coalition that now rules the country. Loosely aligned with the Esers ever since the February Revolution are the United Jewish Socialist Workers Party, or the 'Fareyniktes', whose primary motivation is to create an extra-territorial Jewish Parliament to communally represent the disconnected Jewish settlements and neighbourhoods within the country on cultural and educational matters, while also supporting Federalism for Jews and other minorities where they make up concentrated populations. Across the aisle, the General Jewish Labour Bund in Russia has largely folded into the VST's confederal party structure, with most former Bundists smoothly aligning themselves with their Menshevik allies in the VST-Right, supporting National Cultural Autonomy through the federal protection of the Yiddish language and the empowerment of local Jewish institutions. Something of a wildcard are the Marxist-Zionist parties of Poale Zion - Left and HaShomer HaTzair, who have remained independent, supporting both the VST-Left's programs for affirmative action, and, broadly, some form of future territorial autonomy for Jewish workers, not necessarily in Palestine.\n\nWhichever strain of thought becomes dominant will need to contend with the unescapable coming storm that the entire Socialist world knows is coming: the final battle against the Kaiser. For the Jews of Revolutionary Russia, for all of their ideologies and squabbling, this war will be of the utmost importance - the coming war will, once and for all, decide their fate. Will they be the new Moses, prophets leading their people into the promised future, or the new Bar Kohkbhas, zealots leading them to doom?"

 rusfla.183.d: "With the Red Flag flying across the former Pale of Settlement following the triumph of the Great Revolutionary War, a new dawn has begun for the Jews of Eastern Europe, free at last from the predations of Capital and bourgeois Nationalism. With the majority of the Jewish nation (although the usage of that word is, of course, under constant debate) under the socialist banner, the political discourse within the community has reached a fever pitch. With the seeming inevitability of the World Revolution, the emancipated Jewish workers have already begun striving to create the new society that generations of struggle have brought about.\n\nIn the long off days of 1917, in the heat of the October insurrection and in a move that is sure to amuse many a future historian, the Bundist leader Mark Liber accused Lenin of being nothing but an 'anarcho-syndicalist'. In one of the grand ironies of history, Liber himself led the Bund into the VST and towards a line of military cooperation with the western Syndicalists. Still, in many ways, Liber's vision of the revolution has won out over Lenin's: the VST-Right has shaped the party into a confederal model, one where the reconstituted Bund is recognised as the supreme representative of the Jewish working class.\n\nThe VST has thus implemented a Bundist system of national-personal autonomy and democracy: the local Jewish political councils, or Kehillot, have supreme power over educational, cultural, and municipal matters on the basis of voluntary identification as a member of their jurisdiction, with limited representation also being given to Hasidic groupings like Agudat Yisrael or progressive cultural organisations like the Folkspartey. Socialist Zionist parties such as Poale Zion's Left and HaShomer HaTzair have been allowed to continue their activites freely, as were the most progressive General Zionists like Vulf Latskiy and the moderate Poale Zion-Hitachdut (albeit after heated debate), although the overall victory of Bundism is beginning to spur interest in embracing their idea of 'hereness' over that of aliyah. Either way, the future of Russia's Jews looks bright and red."

After careful conversations with Lenin and Yaakov Sverdlov in 1918, the latter of whom, despite being Jewish himself, was stridently against any sort of 'Jewish section' within the party, Dimanshteyn was tasked with organizing the 'Yevsektsiya', or Jewish Section of the Communist Party. Although the subsequent defeat in the civil war meant that Dimanshteyn was never able to implement Lenin's policies, his current work in the USLR's Commissariat of Nationalities has seen the invitation of crucial cultural figures to the government, including famous names like the actor Solomon Mikhoels, the writer Ilya Ehrenburg, and even the current chief Rabbi of Moscow Shlomo Shleifer.\n\nWhile in practice affiliation in the Yevsektsiya is similar to forms of National Personal Autonomy championed by the other socialist parties, the VST-Left has also pushed for a comprehensive programme of Korenizatsiya (or 'nativisation'), pushing for the local usage of the Yiddish language and its protection as well as the implementation of strong affirmative action programs. The Socialist-Zionist parties, particularly HaShomer HaTzair and Poale Zion Left, have been allowed to operate relatively freely thanks to the Yevsektsiya's guidance, although the Central Committee's increasing scepticism towards Palestine as a destination of migration has led to the question of an alternate place for the voluntary territorial gathering of the Jewish workers. The first suggestion, in Siberia, was eventually dismissed over fears that the inhospitable terrain would require chauvinist coercion, with some among the party also suggesting Crimea as a suitable location, although this has opened up an entirely different can of worms with the peninsula's local groups - but with the development of a socialist Jewish culture under the guidance of the collective Prophet that is the Party, the workers are hopeful for a Red Zion."

 ### News Events ##

 rusnews.1.t: "Viktor Chernov Assassinated!"
 rusnews.1.d: "Viktor Chernov, leader of the Socialist Revolutionary Party and the primary figure leading the opposition parties which control Russia's Upper House of Parliament, was assassinated today by an unknown assailant outside government offices. Many assume the SZRS government to be behind the brazen attack, as Chernov's death would remove the last obstacle for President Boris Savinkov to finally enact his more radical reforms... reforms he has been blocked from passing since the SZRS election victory two years ago.\n\nWhether this proves to be true, Chernov's death is a signal to the rest of the world that democracy in Russia has come to an end, and that a dictatorship under Savinkov is surely just around the corner."
 rusnews.1.a: "How barbaric!"

 rusnews.2.t: "Rise of the Russian State"
 rusnews.2.d: "In the wake of his sweeping reforms in Russia, President Boris Savinkov has taken the perhaps unsurprising step to cement his rule permanently. The newly-proclaimed 'Vozhd', or 'Leader', inaugurated this new stage in Russia's transformation amid cheering throngs on Red Square.\n\nThe celebration has been decidedly more muted across the rest of Europe, however, with opinions in Germany especially tepid given Savinkov's ceaseless barrage of anti-German rhetoric. True to form, the Vozhd again decried German domination of Eastern Europe, reiterating his commitment to 'freeing' Russia's former territories once Russia itself has thrown off the shackles of its Teutonic imprisonment."
 rusnews.2.a: "The Russians? Again?!"
 rusnews.2.b: "Third Europe rises!"
 rusnews.2.c: "This might prove a problem, in time..."
 rusnews.2.e: "This is not good..."

 rusnews.3.t: "Savinkov Overthrown by Military"
 rusnews.3.d.wrangel: "Boris Savinkov is dead. As the President's actions increasingly angered both the populace and the military, a military coup was launched against him. Led by Pyotr Wrangel, the army secured the Kremlin and intercepted the Vozhd's escape attempt. He was court-martialled and shot.\n\nA provisional government has taken up the task of restoring Russian democracy - and monarchy - under the protection of Fieldmarshal Wrangel."
 rusnews.3.d.denikin: "Boris Savinkov is dead. As the President's actions increasingly angered both the populace and the military, a military coup was launched against him. Led by Anton Denikin, the army secured the Kremlin and intercepted the Vozhd's escape attempt. He was court-martialled and shot.\n\nA provisional government has taken up the task of restoring a democratic Russian republic under the protection of Fieldmarshal Denikin."
 rusnews.3.a: "What will this mean for us?"
 rusnews.3.b: "Chaos in Russia can only benefit us."
 rusnews.3.c: "This will upset the order of things, surely..."
 rusnews.3.e: "A surprising development."

 rusnews.4.t: "Death of Savinkov"
 rusnews.4.d: "SAVINKOV DEAD - those were the words plastered on newspapers all across Europe, as word of the Russian dictator's demise has spread about. Savinkov reportedly committed suicide in his bunker as advancing armies only seek to hasten Russia's inevitable default.\n\n[RUS.GetLeader] has been sworn in as the Supreme Commander, but observers expect that it will not be long until Russia lays down its arms and surrenders."

 rusnews.5.t: "Elections in Russia"
 rusnews.5.d: "The first democratic elections in Russia since Savinkov's death have been held. After months of campaigning, they ended up in a victory for the [RUS.GetRulingParty], and [RUS.GetLeader] has been inaugurated as President.\n\nQuestions still loom for the republic, as Russia's politicians seek to rectify the mistakes that led to Savinkov's election, and potentially deal with the pervasive influence of the military."
 rusnews.5.d2: "The first democratic elections in Russia since Savinkov's death have been held. After months of campaigning, they ended up in a victory for the [RUS.GetRulingParty], with [RUS.GetSecondInCommand] being nominated as Chairman-Minister.\n\nQuestions still loom for the restored Russian Empire, as Russia's politicians seek to rectify the mistakes that led to Savinkov's election as well as convince the Russian people of the monarchist restoration."
 rusnews.5.a: "Send our congratulations."
 rusnews.5.b: "What does this mean for us?"
 rusnews.5.c: "Democracy survives."

 rusnews.6.t: "Russian Imperial Restoration"
 rusnews.6.d: "Shocking news from Russia - the monarchy has returned. In the Third All-Russian Constituent Assembly, the Duma, with the insistence of army chief Pyotr Wrangel, have selected to restore the monarchy, citing that it would bring the stability and order that the republic badly needed.\n\nKirill I has been crowned as the Emperor of All the Russias, and he promises to abide by a democratic constitution unlike his predecessors. However, elections are to be held soon, which will no doubt determine the future direction of the reborn Empire."
 rusnews.6.a: "The empire returns!"
 rusnews.6.b: "It seems the Russians didn't learn from the first time."
 rusnews.6.c: "A return of the empire? In this economy?"

 rusnews.7.t: "Russian Imperial Restoration"
 rusnews.7.d: "Shocking news from Russia - the monarchy has returned, but in the most unexpected way. Pyotr Wrangel, who led the Imperial Regency, has now been coronated as Pyotr IV of the Russian Empire.\n\nWhile some believed that Wrangel would restore the Romanov dynasty, his sheer popular support and prestige have given way to a much different outcome. Only time will tell what the restored empire will look like under the Black Baron's rule."
 rusnews.7.a: "The empire returns!"
 rusnews.7.b: "It seems the Russians didn't learn from the first time."
 rusnews.7.c: "Wait, WHAT?!"

 rusnews.8.t: "Socialist Revolution in Russia"
 rusnews.8.d: "Boris Savinkov is dead. As the President's actions increasingly angered both the populace and the military, mass protests broke out on Red Square and Savinkov was shot dead by a Socialist-Revolutionary as gunfire sounded through the capital.\n\nAmidst the chaos, the once-banned Party of Socialist-Revolutionaries, with the support of the masses, took control of major cities across the country and declared a provisional government. Conspirators in the military aligned to the SZRS reportedly attempted a failed coup, which has only emboldened the new government to take action against its opponents. Russia has seemingly become a socialist nation almost overnight, a development that will have far-reaching consequences for Europe - and the world."
 rusnews.8.a: "What does this mean for us?"
 rusnews.8.b: "It seems our enemy is in disarray..."
 rusnews.8.c: "So socialism is not dead in Russia after all?"
 rusnews.8.e: "And Russia is once again thrown into chaos."

 rusnews.9.t: "Democratic Restoration in Russia"
 rusnews.9.d: "Boris Savinkov is dead. As the President's actions increasingly angered both the populace and the military, mass protests broke out on Red Square and Savinkov was shot dead by a Socialist-Revolutionary as gunfire sounded through the capital.\n\nAmidst the chaos, the once-banned Party of Socialist-Revolutionaries, with the support of the masses, took control of major cities across the country. However, the military, under the leadership of [RUS_GetArmyChief] took over soon after to restore a more moderate government. The new government has promised to restore order and create measures against tyrants from taking over again."

 rusnews.10.t: "Formation of the Moscow Accord"
 rusnews.10.d: "For two decades, Russia was seen as a secondary power on the global stage. Dismantled after the Weltkrieg, it could no longer pose a threat to German political hegemony in Eastern Europe, nor to Japanese ambitions in the Pacific. Since then, however, Russia has rebounded, and once again lays down its ambitions.\n\nRussian diplomats have officialised a military and economic alliance claiming to unite all nations in Eurasia not aligned with either Germany or the Internationale — although everyone is well aware that this 'Moscow Accord' is merely an extension of Russia's sphere of influence. Russia seems to not buy the illusion either, and their expansionist rhetoric reveals that they will seek to restore the borders of the former Empire with force."
 #German response:
 rusnews.10.a: "We have defeated them once,\nwe will do it again."
 #Internationale response:
 rusnews.10.b: "A new ally against Germany...\nbut also a new threat."
 #Entente response:
 rusnews.10.c: "Perhaps we can restore the old ties?"
 #Neutral response:
 rusnews.10.f: "Russia is once again on the world stage..."

 rusnews.13.t: "Germany Signs Peace with Russia"
 rusnews.13.d: "Today, the last hopes of the Russian war effort against Germany and its allies have been snuffed out. Initially posing one of the most credible threats to German hegemony across Europe, it seems that Russian efforts were for naught. Both sides met in German-occupied Moscow to negotiate a conditional surrender on Russia's part. In the ensuing treaty, Russia was forced to cede swathes of territory to Germany's allies, as well as pay huge amounts of reparations.\n\nIt is expected that Germany will turn west to face the remainder of the Internationale. Thus far, the Internationale has been able to avoid total defeat. Whether Germany will seek to destroy the socialist alliance entirely or simply seek continental supremacy remains an open question."
 rusnews.13.a: "Twice the pride, double the fall."
 rusnews.13.b: "I thought they were stronger than that?"
 rusnews.13.c: "It's so over..."

 rusnews.14.t: "Russia Restarts War Against Germany"
 rusnews.14.d: "Germany's victory against Russia in the Second Weltkrieg made many believe that Russia had been relegated to a second-rate power, unable to ever rebound from its defeat. Despite this, however, Germany now finds their war effort crumbling. With their defeat almost guaranteed, it was expected that Russia would take advantage despite its weakness.\n\nCiting the need for stability and order in Eastern Europe, [RUS.GetLeader] announced the renewal of military operations against Germany and their allies. It is expected that Russia's reentry will make the once proud hegemon of Europe fall even faster."
 rusnews.14.a: "Third time's the charm, after all."
 rusnews.14.b: "As long as they don't get in our way."

 rusnews.20.t: "The Green International Falls to Radicalism"
 rusnews.20.d: "The international peasants' organisation, the Green International, has passed a programme proposed primarily by the SZRS-aligned peasant parties. This programme is officially denouncing liberal capitalism as 'Junkerism' and communism as inherently against peasant nature. In addition, it calls for peasants to support the struggle against German hegemony and has deemed Serbia's actions in the Balkans as justified.\n\nThis 'takeover', as the Danubian and Nordic delegates are calling it, has made the Green International into a 'spokesman for Russo-Serbian irredentism'. Already purged by disagreements for years, now these 'pro-peace' peasant parties are planning to organise a new international body for the peasants, untainted by radical politics."
 rusnews.20.a: "An Austrian plot as usual."
 rusnews.20.b: "This is a shame."

 rusnews.21.t: "Creation of the Peasant International"
 rusnews.21.d: "The international peasants' organisation, the Green International, has passed a programme proposed primarily by the PSL and supported by Danubian and Nordic peasant parties. This programme is officially denouncing Serbian aggression as hostile to the peasant cause, and requires any member parties to explicitly refrain from warlike rhetoric. The Serbs, Romanians, Russians and Latvians left the organisation before they could be expelled.\n\nSoon after, the Peasant International was founded in Dvinsk by these same parties. The Peasant International's programme repeated the idea of a 'Third Way' economic system that would oppose both 'Junkerism' and Communism, and explicitly support 'peasant powers of Europe, led by Russia'."
 rusnews.21.a: "So falls the peasant cause."
 rusnews.21.b: "Russia shall guide the toiling masses!"
 rusnews.21.c: "And we shall follow!"

 rusnews.22.t: "Operation Arkhangel"
 rusnews.22.d: "This morning, Europe awoke to the sounds of tanks rolling and bombs flying as the Vozhd of the Russian State, [RUS.GetLeader], declared a total war not against any state in particular, but against 'godless communism-materialism' and for the 'liberation of the human soul'. Russia and its allies have begun a mechanised offensive against the Third International and promised to use any means necessary to destroy socialism worldwide.\n\nParis and London have already mobilised their forces, while the rest of the international community is scrambling to come up with an official response. Regardless of which side emerges victorious, Europe will be bathed in blood for the third time in a century."
 rusnews.22.a: "Let us save the world from the faithless!"
 rusnews.22.b: "Is he insane?!"
 rusnews.22.c: "Arise, proletarian, strike down the Svobodnik madman!"

 rusnews.23.t: "Formation of the Holy League"
 rusnews.23.d: "Today, Russian foreign minister Mikhail Georgiyevsky announced the formation of a new defensive pact, dubbed the 'Holy League' by Russian propaganda. Speaking of the 'necessity of the free world to stand together against the red threat', he and Boris Savinkov have stated that this alliance extends to all nations threatened by communism on their doorstep.\n\nOpponents of the International have lauded this as a step to contain the influence of Paris and London. The latter have remained steadfast, stating that its internal contradictions will rip apart the new band of reactionaries."
 rusnews.23.a: "A useless endeavour."
 rusnews.23.b: "This is a step in the right direction."

 rusnews.24.t: "The Eurasian Treaty Organisation"
 rusnews.24.d: "Today, the Russian Chairman-Minister, Pyotr Savitsky, announced a number of new foreign policy initiatives. In particular, he spoke of 'Russia's spiritual-historical mission to dominate the Eurasian continent', claiming a rightful Russian sphere of influence in Xinjiang, Mongolia, and Manchuria.\n\nForeign observers have commented that this new direction sets Russia on an inevitable collision course with East Asia's major powers, particularly China and Japan. The response from Paris and London has been rather muted, though there have been calls to defend the workers' revolution from a Russia that seems increasingly aggressive and militaristic."
 rusnews.24.a: "Is he mad?"
 rusnews.24.b: "Russia must claim her rightful place in the world."

 rusnews.25.t: "The Union of Socialist Labour Republics"
 rusnews.25.d: "Today in Moscow, the Treaty of Organisation of Union of Socialist Labour Republics was ratified. With this, all states part of the Labour Republic system, led and founded by Russia, have been absorbed into one sovereign entity.\n\nThe Kremlin has been quick to laud the treaty as a step forward for international workers' solidarity, predicting that the new state will be a precursor to a socialist world federation. Outside critics have been sceptical, however, with some even depicting the union as a red imperialist project spearheaded by Russian centralists."
 rusnews.25.a: "The International unites the human race!"
 rusnews.25.b: "It's sickening what the communists have done to Europe."

 rusnews.26.t: "The Tilsit Peace Conference"
 rusnews.26.d: "Delegates of Russia, France, Britain and their allied met in small East Prussian town of Tilsit, where Great Powers managed to agree on number of principles for post-war Europe.\n\nWhile there was little love between Russia and the International, calmer heads prevailed, and de-escalation was agreed on, alongside other clauses meant to keep the peace between Great Powers."
 rusnews.26.a: "Let us hope the peace lasts."

 RUS_yakov_sverdlov: "Yakov Sverdlov"
 RUS_yakov_sverdlov_leader_desc: "§YBorn:§! §LJune 3rd, 1885, in Nizhny Novgorod, Nizhny Novgorod Governorate, Russian Empire§!\n§YBackground:§! §LYakov Mikhaylovich Sverdlov was born to a Jewish family in Nizhny Novgorod, with his father storing arms for the revolutionary underground and supporting his children's revolutionary views. It is therefore not surprising that Sverdlov would join the RSDRP in 1902 and support Lenin's Bolsheviks during the party split.\n\nSverdlov took part in the 1905 Revolution and ended up imprisoned in Yekaterinburg. In fact, he would spend most of the next decade imprisoned or exiled, reading the works of Lenin, Marx, or Kautsky, among others. The February Revolution became his chance to return to Petrograd, where he emerged as part of the Bolshevik inner circle. Playing a key role in the October Revolution and subsequent civil war, he oversaw the Tsar's execution and the broader revolutionary terror, earning nickname 'Black Devil'.\n\nHe emerged as a leading figure in a troika of Bolshevik leaders after Lenin's assassination and ultimately emerged as the leader of the remnants of the Russian Communist Party (of Bolsheviks) in Paris. Sverdlov, an unapologetic Leninist, famously argued that the French socialist state is in the process of degeneration into 'bureaucratic sectarianism', as different parties and unions vie for power with no revolutionary unity. His party has hardly been united.\n\nBoth Mikhail Frunze and Grigory Zinovyev sought to contest his leadership, which culminated in a split in 1931 as Zinovyev led a splinter party. In restored socialist Russia, Sverdlov has positioned his party as the true revolutionaries, those who oppose Levitsky's 'diluted communism'. Personally, Sverdlov is an organiser rather than a demagogue and understands that the strengths of the Old Bolsheviks lie in their connections and military experience - and their purpose is, more than anything, to keep the flame of Lenin alive.§!"

 RUS_mikhail_tomsky: "Mikhail Tomsky"
 RUS_mikhail_tomsky_leader_desc: "§YBorn:§! §LOctober 31st, 1880, in Kolpino, Saint-Petersburg Governorate, Russian Empire§!\n§YBackground:§! §LMikhail Pavlovich Tomsky, born Yefremov, was a worker from St. Petersburg when he joined the RSDRP in 1904. Tomsky took part in organising workers' councils, trade unions and underground printing presses. He supported Vladimir Lenin in most questions, though was always more oriented towards questions of free labour unions over the dominance of the party. Tomsky first became leader of the All-Russian Congress of Trade Unions in 1918, and for his role in Bolshevik leadership, he received an 8-year sentence of penal labour.\n\nTomsky was freed in 1930, and while being barred from all public offices, he could take part in the VTsSPS and quickly regained support in Petrograd. The 1930s was an era of ever-radicalising politics, and Tomsky - while avoiding repeating mistakes that would discredit the movement - wholeheartedly supported Red Squads to counter the Svobodnik threat. He was elected into the Central Committee of the VTsSPS in 1932 and narrowly avoided arrest and death in 1934. Tomsky and his allies were forced underground by Savinkov's security organisation, with most of them finding refuge outside Russia.\n\nBack in Russia, Tomsky fully supports the promise of the All-Russian Union of Labour and the renewal of the communist state in Russia - but never at the expense of the autonomy of the labour union movement.§!"

 RUS_lev_kamenev: "Lev Kamenev"
 RUS_lev_kamenev_leader_desc: "§YBorn:§! §LJuly 18th, 1883, in Moscow, Moscow Governorate, Russian Empire§!\n§YBackground:§! §LLev Borisovich Kamenev (Rosenfeld) is a uniquely controversial figure in all of his blandness. To some, he is a mediocre bourgeois middle-manager who stumbled upon the revolution by accident; to others, he is a truly respectable revolutionary proving that one does not need to be a terrorist to be a communist. The Rosenfeld family comes from Moscow. Coming from a working-class family, he was able to study law - and get involved with the Social Democrat revolutionaries such as Lenin and Trotsky.\n\nKamenev was always a writer and an organiser, and he tended to oppose more dangerous plans as 'irresponsible gambling on Russia's future'. Thus, he supported working together with the Socialist-Revolutionaries and opposed the October Revolution - a decision that was greatly stressed in his 1922 trial as proof of his pure motives.\n\nDuring the civil war, Kamenev held high leadership positions in the national government and in Moscow. In the 1922 trial, he was accused of high treason along with other Bolshevik leaders. The 'Kamenev Trial' divided the nation. His defence argued that his opposition to the Cheka, support for people fleeing the Red Terror, and lack of direct involvement in terror acts should be extenuating circumstances. As a result, he avoided the death sentence and instead served 10 years in penal labour, becoming the highest-ranking Bolshevik to do so.\n\nIn prison, he wrote influential works defining the post-war Red narrative and advocated reunification with former Mensheviks. His views aligned closely with Vladimir Levitsky, who had earlier organised Menshevik support for Kamenev during his trial. After Kamenev was freed in 1932, he fled the country as SZRS Combat Squads declared a death sentence on him. His formative years in France and Britain helped shape his vision. Now back in Russia, Kamenev and Levitsky have helped create a unified Russian socialist party. Despite differing on praxis - Kamenev was more tolerant of temporary dictatorial measures - they share the same goal: a communist Russia founded on true Soviet democracy, not Chekist tyranny.§!"

 RUS_grigory_zinovyev: "Grigory Zinovyev"
 RUS_grigory_zinovyev_leader_desc: "§YBorn:§! §LSeptember 23rd, 1883, in Yelizavetgrad, Kherson Governorate, Russian Empire§!\n§YBackground:§! §LGrigory Yevseyevich Zinovyev burns with the passion of a man who has much to prove and rectify. A high-ranking Bolshevik with a profound knowledge of Marxism, Zinovyev was a close ally of Lenin since the split in the RSDRP. Ostensibly quiet and delicate, he quickly proved capable of surprising people as a competent agitator and orator. However, whether influenced by the cautious nature of Kamenev, or whether his subtle political instinct simply saw what lay ahead for an armed uprising, Zinovyev positioned himself against the organisation of the October Insurrection. His opposition was not a product of any principled respect for abstract democracy, though; Zinovyev was committed to the power of the proletariat by any means - he had simply believed that the revolution was fated to be crushed, and that the Bolsheviks would have done better to have bided their time, growing their strength and winning over the sympathy of potential allies. While he remained loyal to Lenin during the Civil War, the failure of the Bolshevik adventure seemed to vindicate him, and he was driven into exile with Sverdlov.\n\nArriving in Paris, they quickly entered into bitter disagreements over the question of tactics. A firebrand to the end, Sverdlov opposed Zinovyev's caution and defended the brash insurrection of 1917. Splitting in 1931, he left for England, where he became associated with Dutt's Vanguardists and the Pankhurstites. Emboldened, he soon returned to Russia. Forming a small communist party that fused with the VST, Zinovyev now finds himself at the head of the organisation. Embracing the lessons of Lenin and Plekhanov, his ambitions lie beyond the fetish for 'democracy'. He knows that everything depends on the circumstances, on the place and the hour. The interests of the revolution - this is the supreme law. Besides anything else, the hegemony of the proletariat must be assured.§!"

 RUS_rafail_abramovich: "Rafail Abramovich"
 RUS_rafail_abramovich_leader_desc: "§YBorn:§! §LJuly 7th, 1880, in Dinaburg, Vitebsk Governorate, Russian Empire§!\n§YBackground:§! §LRafail Abramovich Abramovich, born Rein, is a veteran Menshevik from Dinaburg in Latvia. He made his early political career in the General Jewish Labour Bund, successfully bringing it to the RSDRP, and remained a Bundist all his life. He was in and out of prison for revolutionary work but trended towards moderatism, always opposing violence as a solution to any societal issue.\n\nThis pacifism was always both Abramovich's greatest value and failure. He made attempts great and small to limit the bloodshed of the civil war where possible and was branded a traitor by both sides, like many Mensheviks.\n\nNaturally a proponent of forgiveness and mercy after the civil war, he nonetheless drifted left, as the example of the Western revolutions did seem to prove that a more democratic path to socialism was indeed possible, just not in Russia, where the mere mention of socialism would put you on the police's list. But Abramovich and his comrades soldiered through, organising left-wing publications in Russian, Yiddish, and Hebrew. He briefly served in the leadership of the Bund and was a member of the Radical-Democratic Party until narrowly escaping death in 1935. His son, Mark Rafailovich, was executed, though the rest of the family was able to flee to Belarus.\n\nAfter the revolution, Abramovich emerged as one of the leaders of the 'Danist' faction of the All-Russian Union of Labour, and remains on the very moderate end of the party.§!"

 RUS_boris_nikolayevsky: "Boris Nikolayevsky"
 RUS_boris_nikolayevsky_leader_desc: "§YBorn:§! §LOctober 8th, 1887, in Belebey, Ufa Governorate, Russian Empire§!\n§YBackground:§! §LBoris Ivanovich Nikolayevsky is the son of a priest from the Ufa region, and revolutionary already from 1901. Initially a Bolshevik, Nikolayevsky eventually turned to the Mensheviks, but remained in between the groups. He was generally opposed to the Bolshevik's extreme measures but also unsatisfied with the lack of direct action by the Mensheviks. Nikolayevsky worked as a publicist and a writer and was particularly close with the Georgian Mensheviks due to his time spent in Batumi.\n\nFinally, in the Civil War, he turned fully against the Bolsheviks. Nikolayevsky supported the KOMUCH and organised Siberian Mensheviks to back Aleksandr Kolchak - despite their distaste for the dictator. This put him in good graces with the Whites, and Nikolayevsky became a prominent member of the Radical-Democratic Party in 1923. He had trouble with the law multiple times due to his radical writings being censored as 'communistic'. From 1931, Nikolayevsky organised the League for the Struggle for People's Freedom, an anti-Svobodnik organisation that sought to counter Svobodnik influence in the media. The group was banned in 1935, and Nikolayevsky and his colleagues were forced underground.\n\nNow after the revolution, he remains a moderate, though not terribly happy with the Danists' policies in practice. He has become something of an internal opposition figure within the VST's right-wing faction, seeking stronger cooperation with the centre's syndicalists.§!"

 RUS_vladimir_levitsky: "Vladimir Levitsky"
 RUS_vladimir_levitsky_leader_desc: "§YBorn:§! §LFebruary 28th, 1883, in Saint-Petersburg, Saint-Petersburg Governorate, Russian Empire§!\n§YBackground:§! §LVladimir Osipovich Tsederbaum-Levitsky was part of a prominent Jewish family active in Russian socialist movements. The Tsederbaums, including Vladimir and his six siblings, were Menshevik revolutionaries. The eldest, Yuly Tsederbaum-Martov, led the Menshevik faction of the RSDRP in 1903, and his sister Lidia married Fyodor Dan, another notable Menshevik.\n\nVladimir Osipovich was a labour organiser and author of countless works of theory and agitation; a man of remarkable energy and interest in all aspects of revolutionary struggle. He was a Defencist and proponent of the Provisional Government and opposed the October Revolution on the basis of its opposition to democracy.\n\nAfter the death of his brother Yuly and the disarray of the Mensheviks, Levitsky focused on gaining leniency and mercy for those Reds who had not committed any other crimes, and always spoke for national healing. Later, his focus shifted to working against the anti-socialist laws from within the Radical-Democratic Party.\n\nDrifting to the left as time went by, he came to develop the theory of Synthesis Communism based on the lessons of the Western revolutions and the works of Vsevolod Volin. In 1931, his faction took over the RDP, and the party moved swiftly to the left - and was ultimately banned by Savinkov. The tumultuous 1930s radicalised many former Mensheviks, including Levitsky, who adopted tactics of revolution together with the broadest possible coalition of progressive forces. It remains to be seen if Levitsky is a man able to guide such a coalition.§!"

Spiridonova rose into legendary fame as the Russian Maid of Orleans during her trial and imprisonment in 1906, and the fame only grew in subsequent years as she was venerated almost as a Saint in many of the poorest rural regions of Russia.\n\nMaria Aleksandrovna Spiridonova was born in 1884 in Tambov to an impoverished noble family. She was left without higher education and became involved in political life at 19 years old, joining the Socialist Revolutionaries and being arrested for the first time in the wake of the 1905 revolution.\n\nThe following year, Spiridonova was assigned to assassinate Gavril Luzhenovsky, a despised landowner and Black Hundredist. After the murder, she was violently apprehended, beaten, and likely raped by her Cossack guard. Her mistreatment made her a martyr for the revolutionary cause, though she was sent to Siberia. Granted amnesty after the February Revolution, she returned to political life and quickly rose to leadership in the PSR.\n\nSpiridonova led the Left-SR movement, initially supporting the Bolshevik Revolution but later breaking with them over their harsh policies towards peasants and authoritarianism. The Bolsheviks sent her to a mental asylum, but White forces freed her when they captured Moscow. Despite being pardoned in a general amnesty, she was marginalised in politics and focused on grassroots initiatives for rural Russia. An early opponent of Savinkov, she returned to party politics in 1933 to unite her party's left-wing in cooperation with the right.\n\nSpiridonova believes that Russian peasant communes are the ideal basis of socialism - a vision closer to anarchism than Marxism. She has remained idealistic, even if used to disappointment by now, and is highly respected by the Left-SRs as a leader who never compromises on the ideals of the party.§!"

 RUS_viktor_chernov_sic_desc: "§YBorn:§! §LDecember 7th, 1873, in Khvalynsk, Saratov Governorate, Russian Empire§!\n§YBackground:§! §LDescribed by his fellow SR Nikolay Sukhanov as follows: 'Without Viktor Mikhaylovich Chernov, there would be no Socialist Revolutionary Party at all. Throughout his entire career, he was constantly faced with an extremely difficult, or rather, impossible, false, internally contradictory task: to saturate the Russian black-earth peasant soil with the latest, scientific, international socialism, or to win for our black-earth peasant a place of honour and equal rights in the Workers' International of Europe.'\n\nBorn to a middle-class family in Khvalynsk, a backward rural community near the Kyrgyz Steppe, Chernov was attracted to Narodism early on, and by 1894, Chernov was a hunted revolutionary, socialist theorist, and a founding member of the Socialist-Revolutionary Party in 1902. An intelligent and tireless man, he quickly became one of the party's stars and ideological leaders. Chernov's main thesis was that while Marx's goals are right, his diagnosis on Russia is not: it was possible for Russia to transition from feudalism to communism without capitalism. It was also during this time he met Boris Savinkov, whom Chernov considered a 'spiritual aristocrat' and mere terrorist, uninterested in the cause.\n\nIn 1917, now the de facto leader of the PSR, Chernov returned from exile to Petrograd alongside Boris Savinkov. Chernov tried to keep the party unified in the tumultuous days of the revolutions, but it was becoming impossible. He had to escape for his life towards White-held Ufa. At the Second Ufa Conference, Savinkov, now a rogue SR, had managed to persuade local SRs to support Kolchak, and Chernov begrudgingly cooperated.\n\nThe high point of Chernov's career was his election to be the first Chairman-Minister of the Republic in 1921. But the victory was not easy: Savinkov took his followers and formed SZRS in 1924, and in 1926 Chernov refused the presidential nomination under pressure from the generals. For a decade, Chernov focused on maintaining the unity of the party and Russian democracy - until it all collapsed in 1934 with the election of his old rival, Boris Savinkov. For two long years, Chernov has been keeping the Opposition Bloc united and thwarting Savinkov's authoritarian laws - but it is clear that time is running out for the Russian republic.§!"

There he focused on poetry, history and journalism.\n\nAfter the February Revolution, Rikhter returned to Russia and rose in the ranks of the party. He remained an important writer and theorist for the party, and paid special attention to the education of the youth movement. Rikhter was a vocal supporter of Chernov and a virulent opponent of Savinkov, maintaining that SZRS represented Socialist-Revolutionaries betraying their own support base, the peasants.\n\nRikhter famously gave the last free speech in the State Duma before the opposition was arrested, and surprisingly turned from a grey party theorist into an inspiring martyr to the cause and a symbol of resistance.§!"

His studies were interrupted by the revolutions, where he took part in the Northern Volunteer Army's actions in North Russia.\n\nIn the post-war years, Sorokin became one of the top sociologists of Russia and has served years in the Ministry of Education with a dream of lasting Russian equality and democracy.§!"

A spineless hedonist, gambler, and womaniser. A vain and hypocritical opportunist, deluded into thinking he is fulfilling some brand of cosmic mission. He is a man of extremes: what he loves, he loves to the end, and what he hates, he hates just as passionately.\n\nAll the myth surrounding his person is in no small part thanks to his own writings and the fanatic followers he has the ability to inspire. The Savinkov family was a well-off middle class, with young Boris growing up in Warsaw, where his fascination with the revolution began - a path he walked to its logical extreme: through years of terrorism, war, and, finally, all the way to the Kremlin. He successfully remade himself from a revolutionary terrorist into an ideologue and the leader of the Northern Volunteer Army, and by the end of the civil war, many followed him into the Union for the Defence of the Motherland and Freedom - an organisation dedicated solely to Russia's messianic fate, to restore it with blood, no matter the cost.\n\nTo his followers, he is a man to spark inspiration and adoration, promising a vision of the Third Russia that no other politician in Russia dared to promise.

Only through a miracle did the Grand Prince survive. He continued his career in the navy, with his own Naval Cadet Guard serving the Counter-Admiral loyally.\n\nKirill's private life was more complex.

From this marriage, Princess Maria, Princess Kira, and Prince Vladimir were born.\n\nDue to his position in the Admiralty, Kirill was present in Petrograd during the 1917 Revolution.

First enrolling as a cadet in Kiev, Denikin would see active service in the Russo-Japanese War.\n\nWith the outbreak of the Great War, Denikin was soon promoted to quartermaster of Brusilov's 8th Army. Ironically, Denikin found staff service underwhelming and soon petitioned for an appointment to the front. He was transferred to the 4th 'Iron' Infantry Division. Earning much praise both for himself and his 'Iron Riflemen', Denikin was promoted to command the entire 8th Army Corps. Following the February Revolution, Denikin became chief of staff to Russia's revolving door of Supreme Commanders before ending up arrested alongside Kornilov for supporting the latter's march on Petrograd.\n\nWith the start of the Russian Civil War, Denikin and his fellow generals were freed by their guards and fled to the Don. With the fall of Yekaterinodar, Denikin was appointed General-Governor and subsequently repelled the Red Taman Army, which had besieged the city. The death of General Alekseyev several months later led to the succession of Denikin to the position of the Volunteer Army's chief civil administrator. After the Second Ufa Conference, he was again appointed General-Governor, but now for the whole of Southern Russia, a post he held concurrently with commanding the Whites' Southern Front. Arguably the mastermind behind the famed March on Moscow, Denikin bears much of the credit for cutting the heart out of Bolshevik Russia.\n\nWith the return of peace, Denikin has turned his efforts to a long-running reorganisation of the Russian Army.

As a commander, Markov was noted not only for his boundless optimism and charisma, but also for being a harsh disciplinarian. Loyal to Denikin, he was arrested in the wake of the Kornilov Affair.\n\nAt the start of the Russian Civil War, Markov was appointed to command the elite Officer Regiment in the Volunteer Army.

Injured by an artillery shell at the outset of the Stavropol campaign, Markov soon recovered and returned to active service, seizing Astrakhan and linking fronts with the Siberian Whites at Uralsk. He later commanded the forces of the 5th Army, which took Voronezh as part of the March on Moscow.\n\nAfter the end of the Civil War, Markov earned a reputation as a tireless proponent of armoured warfare, and his promotion to General-Fieldmarshal in 1931 finally gave him the opportunity to raise the first armoured forces in the Russian Army.

The February Revolution caught now-Colonel Kutepov on leave in Petrograd, and he soon found himself leading loyalist troops.

After these events, Kutepov commanded the White thrust on Astrakhan and Uralsk, where the Southern Whites first joined with Kolchak's Siberians. Later serving as a corps commander in the 5th White Army, he participated in the Moscow March and eliminated remnants of the Red Army in Central Russia.\n\nPromoted to the rank of General of the Infantry after the end of the war, Kutepov has maintained a reputation as an efficient commander and strict disciplinarian, with a large role in training Russia's next generation of Guards troops.§!"

He went on to command a company and participated in the Stavropol campaign - the events of which drastically transformed the young captain.

During the Great War, he served in the 1st Siberian Riflemen Division when he suffered serious wounds in 1916. From then onward, he served in different staff offices, but was struck with typhus during an assignment in the 12th Army's headquarters. While convalescing in a hospital bed in Valka, the city was captured in 1918 by the advancing Germans and he was taken prisoner.\n\nReyter attempted to escape several times, after which he was conscripted into the German-backed Western Volunteer Army led by Bermondt-Avalov. Even then, unwilling to wear the stahlhelm and feldgrau of his former captors, Reyter tried to desert to the Reds before he was transferred to the more politically independent Northwestern Army and assigned command of a regiment. He fought with distinction at Petrograd, Tver, and finally Moscow. With the Bolsheviks' back broken, Reyter was tasked with the harsh duty of suppressing Red partisans in Central Russia.\n\nAfter the end of the Civil War, he would keep the role of anti-insurgent fighting, spending time first among indigenous volunteers in the Alash territories, before returning to Russia to crush the 1932 Tambov Uprising on behalf of the SR-Kadet government.

With the vocational school he was attending in 1920 shuttered due to the ongoing Civil War, Vatutin found himself conscripted into the White Army, as General Kornilov sought to fill his depleted ranks amidst fierce fighting in Central Russia. Vatutin would serve for the most part as a half-trained infantryman, battling against Red partisans as the White Armies of the Southern Front marched northwards.\n\nVatutin chose to remain in the Russian Army after the end of the Civil War, graduating from the Alekseyev Military School in 1923. Having attained a post as a praporshchik, Vatutin had already risen far above his past as a lowly garrison conscript, and he set about planting a foundation for life as a career soldier.\n\nAn energetic and ambitious young man, Vatutin went on to be posted in a wide variety of theatres - including Siberia, the Caucasus and Central Russia. Having missed the fighting against the Chinese and Japanese in 1928, Vatutin has had to content himself mostly with policing actions and a regimen of training programmes. Promoted to colonel after completing his studies at the All-Russian General Staff Academy in 1934, Vatutin's merits have been noted by General Vasilevsky, who has placed him on the shortlist for promotion to general-major if the need arises.

Furthermore, as a non-Cossack living on Cossack territories, Grechko was considered one of the outsiders, or 'Inogorodniye', and so was spared the expectation of military service at the cost of lower status.\n\nHowever, the northern Don straddled the Red-White frontline for much of the Russian Civil War, and Golodayevka was exposed not only to these two forces, but also to the anarchist Black Army from neighbouring Ukraine. At sixteen, Grechko was finally drafted by the Whites in December 1919. The Don Army had suffered terrible losses in its offensive towards Voronezh, and despite not being a Cossack himself, Grechko could still ride a horse well enough to serve. Grechko spent most of the war battling bandits and partisans rather than joining the push to Moscow. This experience proved useful, and the Civil War's end saw Grechko remain in the army and pursue further education.\n\nFrom 1920 to 1926, Grechko undertook cavalry command courses first in Novocherkassk, then Taganrog, before finally graduating from the prestigious North Caucasian National Cavalry School. Thereafter, he spent four years deployed in Chechnya and Dagestan, rooting out the bandits and insurgents who thrived in the region's borderlands. For further training, he transferred first to the Moscow Military District in 1930, then the Suvorov Military School in 1932.

Popov would fight in the push on Moscow as a common rifleman, though his talents were quickly recognised. The ferocious fighting for the strategic city of Voronezh was Popov's trial by fire, though his journey with the 5th Army would take him past the gates of the Kremlin.\n\nWith the Civil War's end, Popov was forwarded first to a field training course for infantry commanders in 1922, following that with a more formal education at the Officers School at Oranienbaum in 1925. Popov would see a variety of staff and battalion-command positions in the 1920s, before finding himself back at Oranienbaum as an instructor in 1929.

Too young to see service in either the Great War or the Russian Civil War, Pliyev was still acutely aware of the violence and political struggle which defined his youth. As an Ossetian peasant, Pliyev was naturally drawn to the 'Kermen' Party, which demanded the unconditional transfer of land to the peasantry away from both Ossetian and Georgian landlords. However, the Kermenists ultimately sided with the Bolsheviks and were crushed by White forces in their reconquest of the North Caucasus.\n\nDrafted in 1922, Pliyev served briefly in a cavalry detachment of the nascent forces of the Special Caucasus Autonomous Area before demobilising in 1923. However, Pliyev's talent was noticed, and he was redrafted that year into the Suvorov Military School in Petrograd. Graduating in 1926, Pliyev went on to serve as an instructor in Yekaterinodar's North Caucasian National Cavalry School.

Unwilling to allow his family name to dictate his life, Basan instead chose to enlist in the Russian Army in 1927. Gorodovikov excelled in his studies, earning a spot as a model student upon his graduation from Yekaterinodar's North Caucasian National Cavalry School in 1930.\n\nGorodovikov's first command would prove formative. Leading a cavalry squadron in the 76th Cavalry Regiment, itself a largely Kalmyk and Nogai formation, Gorodovikov joined the escalating 'anti-bandit' operation that had gripped upland Karachay. The young officer earned a reputation for adaptability and cool-headedness in the harsh mountain fighting. For its experience with anti-partisan operations, the 76th Regiment came to be relied upon by the authorities of the Special Caucasus Autonomous Area, and Gorodovikov spent much of the early 1930s maintaining order across the breadth of the North Caucasus. Emerging from the mountains in 1935 with the rank of major and many mentions in dispatches, Gorodovikov was finally given leave to continue his studies at the All-Russian General Staff Academy.

Yury joined the Socialist-Revolutionary Party in 1915 and served in the army on the Romanian and Galician fronts.\n\nFreshly elected military commissar of Moscow in 1917, Yury quickly gained fame as a charismatic, handsome, and popular military man, greatly influential among the Moscow SRs, rising to the Moscow Military Revolutionary Committee. Thanks to him, the Provisional Government's forces were ousted from Moscow in October of 1917. After a brief time fighting against the Volunteer Army, he got entangled with the Rebellion of the Left-SRs and became the Chief of Staff of the PLSR Central Committee. This failed uprising sent him into a Bolshevik prison, where he would remain for the next few years.\n\nSablin was pardoned as part of a mass amnesty for the Left-SRs by President Nikolay Avksentyev in 1926, and even his imperial-era military rank was restored. Like many of these 'red-tainted' officers, he was ignored in most promotions, but he did acquire proper military education in the 1920s and became an outspoken SR supporter in the army. Siding with the Boldyrev Putsch, Sablin was expelled from the army and spent a stint in Paris before secretly returning to Russia in 1935 to organise guerrilla operations against the Savinkov regime together with Mikhail Levandovsky.\n\nFar more of a politician and organiser than a frontline commander, Sablin is sometimes ridiculed for knowing dance, dressing pompously, and seeming more like an actor or a dandy than a military man, but it cannot be said that 'Yurka' isn't married to the revolutionary cause.§!"

The Levandovsky family moved to Grozny, and Mikhail's Terek Cossack stepfather helped him to enrol in the Vladimir Military School in 1910. The young stabs-captain Levandovsky saw fighting on all the fronts of the Great War.\n\nAfter he returned to Grozny, he was elected as local military commissar and became involved in the gruesome civil war in the North Caucasus between the Reds in his command, the White Cossacks, the Chechens, and ultimately Kornilov's Volunteer Army. Levandovsky proved to be a brilliant commander, whose forces could disappear into the mountains and outflank their enemies, slipping through any net the Whites cast. Finally, in 1919, the noose was too tight, and as the Red cause in the North Caucasus was all but dead, Levandovsky led a brutal march to Astrakhan and up the Volga to allow his ragged band to join with the main forces of the Reds.\n\nLevandovsky, now commanding the 11th Army, could not hold Astrakhan but scored a number of defensive victories against Kolchak's forces. Ultimately, however, his fate was the same as that of other Red commanders - exile and lost dreams.\n\nAfter the war, Levandovsky quickly organised the Combat Union of Socialist-Revolutionaries, operating from Georgia.

As impoverished nobles, a military career was practically the only possible way forward for the gifted Mikhail. He served on the Polish Front of the Great War and ended up a captive. It is from this time that Charles de Gaulle - Tukhachevsky's cell-mate - described Tukhachevsky's occult and pagan beliefs, though he later brushed these off as immaturities of his youth.\n\nIn the Red Army, Tukhachevsky's rise was meteoric. He became the commander of the 1st Army of the Eastern Front and, for the first time, demonstrated his natural grasp of military leadership, his analytical ability, and bold decision-making. Simbirsk, Samara, and Perm fell in offensives in late 1918 - one of the greatest Red counter-attacks of the war. In 1920, Tukhachevsky became the Commander-in-Chief of all Red forces and was able to prevent a total collapse, but at that point, the best the Reds could do was engage in desperate delaying actions as they retreated towards Arkhangelsk and, hopefully, France.\n\nIn emigration, Tukhachevsky became a French army officer and lecturer in the International Military School. As the most high-profile Red émigré, there have been multiple attempts by the Russian intelligence services on his life. He focused on military-scientific work and theories of industrial revolutionary war, associating with theorists such as Aleksandr Svechin and J.F.C.

Boldyrev served briefly as the Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the Siberian Whites, but was sidelined after he lost the vote to Kolchak over the question of supreme leadership. Boldyrev's most notable achievement during the war was negotiating the Japanese withdrawal from the Russian Far East.\n\nAfter the war, Boldyrev focused on the development of the Russian Air Fleet and military theory and remained leader of the so-called Liberal Clique within the military.

After being arrested by the Bolsheviks in late 1917, he was soon released, possibly due to his pre-war connections to the RSDRP.\n\nBoldyrev contacted General Kazanovich of the Volunteer Army and was sent to Ufa to organise anti-Bolshevik organisations, eventually being elected Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the Siberian forces. Losing the vote for overall Supreme Leader to Admiral Kolchak, he was asked to be moved to other duties, and served as the military attaché to Japan for the next two years, negotiating Japanese withdrawal from Amur and cessation of their support to Semyonov and Kalmykov.\n\nAfter the war, Boldyrev would focus on the foundation of the VVFR. A popular commander with outspoken democratic views, many liberal-minded officers flocked to him. This 'Boldyrev Clique' would form the nucleus of those attempting to 'save Russia from tyranny' in 1929, in the wake of the probable SZRS takeover. For Boldyrev, the military needed to take action, ban the SZRS and give power back to the SR-Kadet alliance.\n\nBut General-Fieldmarshal Kornilov considered the officers to be in defiance of his authority and suppressed the coup before enacting purges in the Russian army. Boldyrev fled to Germany and watched as Savinkov solidified his rule. In 1935, he founded the Committee for a Free Russia, which would help in the VRBO's struggle against Savinkov.

Even though he had close ties to the Imperial Court, already as a young man he was an outspoken critic of Tsarism.

He awaited the February Revolution enthusiastically and joined the Socialist-Revolutionary Party. Rising quickly under the Provisional Government, he was appointed the chief of the Moscow Military District and became Kerensky's staunch ally. Successfully opposing the Kornilov Putsch, he replaced Savinkov as Minister of War and was made part of Kerensky's Directory. In spite of this rapid rise to power, he found himself politically isolated. With his reforms failing and nearly all factions hating him, he resigned in shame just before the October Coup. He tried and failed to organise anti-Bolshevik resistance in Kiev and Petrograd and spent much of the Civil War in Bolshevik custody.\n\nHe was freed from captivity following the White victory but was also by now a hated enemy of Kornilov and Denikin. Deemed a two-faced political adventurer, Verkhovsky spent much of the 1920s as a simple professor in the All-Russian General Staff, trying to popularise the concept of small, but highly professional armies. When Verkhovsky was implicated in the Boldyrev Coup, Kornilov made sure to get rid of the General-Major for good in the Christmas Purges of 1929. For the next decade, he lived in shameful exile until he was invited by Boldyrev to resist the tyranny gripping Russia and join the Free Russian Army.§!"

Alongside his native Russian, he grew to be fluent in both Mongolian and Buryat. He entered military service in 1911 and soon found himself in Chinese Outer Mongolia, where he developed excellent relations with the local population. He even assisted the revolutionaries during the Mongolian National Revolution before serving at the Northwestern Front in the Great War.\n\nAt his personal request, he was sent to the Persian Front in 1917 before witnessing the February Revolution. He was made a government commissioner for all Mongol and Buryat volunteer units in the Transbaikal region in the summer. With these troops, Semyonov mutinied against the Bolsheviks following the October Coup and proclaimed himself March Ataman of the Transbaikal Cossack Host, with Japanese support and the multi-ethnic Special Manchurian Detachment under his command. While Kolchak formally appointed Semyonov as the commander of all troops in Transbaikal in 1919, in practice, Semyonov ruled as an independent warlord.\n\nHis reign ended in 1921 when the Bolsheviks were defeated in the west and the Japanese signed the Harbin Agreement. Semyonov's plundering and brutality were not forgotten by his fellow Russians, and without his Japanese backers, he had to flee to Manchuria. In exile, Semyonov became a mercenary, assisting the Fengtian Clique in its wars against the Zhili in the 1920s and then against Russia in the 1927-1928 Sino-Russian War. To return to Russia, he lobbied for support from Chinese mercenaries, Japanese officers, and even the disgruntled Russian monarchists of the Circle of St. George led by Mikhail Diterikhs, starting an uprising in the Russian Far East.§!"

In the Russo-Japanese War, he served in the headquarters of the 17th Army Corps and took part in nearly all of the major battles. By 1914, Diterikhs served in the General Staff's mobilisation department. At the start of the Great War, he served as the chief of staff of the 3rd Army. In 1916 he was sent to the Macedonian Front to serve as commander of Russian troops in the Allied Army of the Orient.\n\nHe joined the Stavka after the Kornilov Putsch and was appointed its chief of staff by the Supreme Commander Nikolay Dukhonin in the midst of the October Coup. After Dukhonin was murdered by the Reds, Diterikhs joined the Czechoslovak Corps as their chief of staff on their way to Vladivostok. They captured the city, and he joined the Siberian Army, becoming an early supporter of Kolchak. The latter appointed the avid monarchist as the head of the commission which investigated the murder of the Romanovs. In 1919, Diterikhs served as Kolchak's chief of staff and ordered the formation of Orthodox and Muslim volunteer units. Following the Ufa Conference, he commanded the 4th 'Siberian' Army.\n\nBy the 1920s, Diterikhs was a war hero; however, he was also an opponent of the new Liberal Republic, viewing an Orthodox Monarchy as the only form of government capable of governing Russia. His views and statements were not appreciated by Kornilov and the SR-Kadet coalition, and so he was asked to 'retire' from the army in 1929. Insulted, Diterikhs spent the early 1930s as an active military writer, all while making contact with other disgruntled monarchist officers, together forming the Circle of St. George to one day restore the monarchy in Russia.§!"

He entered service in the Great War as an adjutant in the 2nd Caucasian Army Corps.\n\nFollowing the February Revolution, he was promoted to colonel despite being part of a group of monarchists who sought to overthrow the Provisional Government. After the October Coup, he fled to the Ukrainian State and became involved in organising the Southern Army. When it was absorbed into VSYuR in 1919, he made his way to the Baltic to serve in the Western Corps under the command of Anatoly Lieven, subordinate to the Northwestern Army. But Bermondt had other plans, and with German aid, he formed an independent Western Volunteer Army, styling himself as a General and prince. His usurpation was reluctantly accepted by Kolchak, and Bermondt's forces assisted the Whites in taking Vitebsk and Smolensk from the Bolsheviks.\n\nAfter the Civil War, Bermondt's ego and arrogance made him a hated figure in both the army and the civilian government. The last straw came during the Christmas Purge of 1929, when evidence surfaced that he had embezzled army funds and received money from German intelligence. Dismissed from the Army, the government issued a warrant for his arrest.

The catastrophe at Tsushima did not hinder his career, and Rusin would hold high positions as both naval commander and in the naval staff.\n\nDuring the Great War, Rusin served as the Chief of the Naval General Staff. He is an avowed monarchist and later in his memoirs claimed that the abdication of Emperor Nikolay II was the greatest national catastrophe Russian people had ever suffered. Despite his prestigious naval career, Kolchak moved Rusin to a relatively irrelevant post as the Chief of Naval Staff of the Pacific Fleet, where he would be kept away from positions of influence. Rusin continued to associate with the monarchists and endorsed SOR in 1929.\n\nRusin was finally discharged in 1932 after Kolchak's attempts to get the old admiral to retire failed. He took it as a great personal insult and would become an avowed enemy of Kolchak and the whole Moscow establishment as corrupt politicians. He associated himself with the Circle of St. George and joined the Diterikhs' Putsch out of both personal vendetta and deep belief in the restoration of the old monarchy - a golden era for all the Russias.§!"

The Supreme Admiral of the Navy is the haughty epitome of a gentleman who still believes in the outdated notions of chivalry and noble moderation.\n\nBorn into a family of minor nobility of Ukrainian origin, Aleksandr joined Eduard Toll's polar expedition as a young officer - the first of Kolchak's many polar adventures, his passion. After having his first command in the Russo-Japanese War, Kolchak came to prominence with his naval reform programme. He commanded the Baltic Fleet's Mine-Laying Division with great success in the Great War and was already a famous officer by the time of the February Revolution.\n\nA monarchist, Kolchak nevertheless cooperated with the February Revolution out of a sense of duty and was chosen as Supreme Ruler of Russia after the coup d'état of November 1918, much to his surprise. Inexperienced in land warfare, he appointed Lavr Kornilov as Commander-in-Chief of all White forces after the Second Ufa Conference. Although he detested being involved in politics, Kolchak was able to maintain unity among the Whites until the end of the war, resigning his position as Supreme Ruler following the new Republic's interim elections.\n\nNow appointed Maritime Minister, Aleksandr Kolchak is the first (and probably the last) person in Russian history who holds the rank of Supreme Admiral of the Navy, making him one of the most influential individuals in Russia. This influence is rarely expressed in politics, as Kolchak instead devotes himself to keeping the Russian Navy in shipshape and sponsoring new polar expeditions from his personal savings.§!"

He was detached to the destroyer Boyevoy when the battleship Petropavlovsk struck the mine that sank her and killed Makarov. Subsequently appointed by Admiral Vitgeft as his flag captain, Kedrov was wounded aboard the battleship Tsesarevich during the Battle of the Yellow Sea. After recovering in hospital in Tsingtao, he joined up with the ill-fated Second Pacific Squadron.

Later that same year, Kedrov returned to Russia to command the battleship Gangut. In 1916, Kedrov commanded the Baltic Fleet's destroyer division, before leading the Black Sea Fleet's battleship squadron. Appointed deputy of the Maritime Minister after the February Revolution, he was effectively in charge of the Maritime Ministry due to Guchkov's inexperience in naval matters.\n\nWith the beginning of the Russian Civil War, Kedrov served with the White forces and organised naval logistics to supply the White armies.

Graduating in 1898, Stark's first command was as a mine officer aboard the cruiser Avrora.\n\nWhen the Russo-Japanese War began, Stark and the Avrora joined the 2nd Pacific Squadron on its long journey around Africa and the disastrous Battle of Tsushima. In 1912, Stark was successively given command of the destroyers Silny, Strashny, Donskoy Kazak, and the 5th and 12th Destroyer Divisions.

In the ensuing trial, Nemits successfully advocated for the abrogation of the death penalty and a mitigation of other sentences for no fewer than 200 sailors.\n\nWorking as a professor of various naval courses before the Great War, Nemits commanded several divisions of the Black Sea Fleet after the war began.

Nevertheless, he indirectly helped the Whites by formally transferring command of the Black Sea Fleet to Admiral Mikhail Sablin. Sentenced to death for deserting the fleet, Nemits' punishment was complicated by the rapid German occupation of Ukraine. He ultimately chose to travel to the Volga in mid-1919, where he joined the Whites and was appointed commander of the Caspian Flotilla.\n\nAfter the end of the Civil War, Nemits returned to teaching at the All-Russian Maritime Academy.

However, with the Red Army struggling to hold back the anti-Bolshevik forces by June of that same year, some ships of the Red Northern Dvina and Onega Flotillas elected to desert and join the Whites. Kuznetsov, now finding himself on the White side alongside his ship's crew, fought under the auspices of Savinkov's Northern Army before then retreating from a Red counter-offensive in the Northern Ice March.

His rapid ascent was noticed by Admiral Kolchak, who then began to personally support him.

However, the man doesn't seem to be a bootlicker like Derental, and can disagree vehemently with Boris Viktorovich - but the two men are united in blood and fire, and in the end, their trust is unbreakable.

He lived as a couple of three with his wife Zinaida Gippius, a poetess in her own right, and his friend Dmitry Filosofov. The trio would become leaders of the 'Brotherhood of Three', a religious-mystical group that sought to remake Christianity along modernist lines and would later become the Church of the Third Testament.\n\nIn 1892, Merezhkovsky's collection of poems, 'Symbols' became the manifesto of Russian Symbolism, interested in the 'mystical mystery of existence'. Symbolism would dominate Russian arts for decades to come, including a profound change in Boris Savinkov's worldview when they met in Paris in 1907 and took the terrorist under their wing.\n\nMerezhkovsky and Gippius would remain cultural titans of post-war Russia, and in their discussion circle in Petrograd, many new artists were given their first inspiration, and many esoteric sessions gave direction to men and women.

He hails from an old noble family, but his heritage did not stop him from adopting democratic socialist views shortly after starting his political career. By 1917, he had already established himself as a prominent historian and made his first attempts to unite the multiple socialist movements of Russia. Unable to reconcile with the Bolsheviks' 'dictatorship of the proletariat', Melgunov joined the White Movement, helping to ease political tensions and thereby earning himself a positive reputation among both the left and the right in postwar Russia.\n\nIn the 1920s, Sergey climbed to the top of the RDP party leadership, becoming a leader of the democratic socialist movement and an obvious target for the SZRS. However, their attempt to silence Melgunov on the grounds of publishing 'anti-patriotic propaganda' failed due to overwhelming pressure from the Russian intelligentsia and democratic opposition.

Many young Right-SRs like Martyanov ended up moving into SZRS, but he did not, always championing for SRs to remember direct action, their past struggles, and to not let daily politics make them lose their ideals.\n\nUnwilling to accept defeat to Savinkov, Martyanov was imprisoned but escaped from a penal colony in 1936.

After the Bolshevik takeover, Vladimir escaped to Samara and put his organisational skills into helping create the Komuch.\n\nIn post-war Russia, Zenzinov became one of the people crucial for the survival of the united SR party, working tirelessly to mend the ever-increasing divides between the left and right wings of the party. With the coalition with the Kadets being a necessity for his party to keep power in the 1920s, Vladimir became concerned that the rightist SRs were drifting further and further away from their socialist roots. His fears were validated when a large part of the SR party defected to Savinkov's SZRS, allowing them to seize power and snuff out democracy. With the removal of the Vozhd, the SRs were given a chance to redeem themselves after returning to power. Zenzinov is convinced that the party must focus on improving the living conditions of the population to remain ideologically coherent, as it may not survive a second crisis of party unity.§!"

Pavel was sceptical about the prospects of an alliance with the volatile SRs, believing them to be far too violent and unpredictable compared to other parties of the Russian right. His worries proved to be justified, as the ruling SR-Kadet coalition was marred with scandals, culminating in the former SR Boris Savinkov overthrowing Russian democracy.

Antony was a fervent supporter of the White cause and monarchism, and became the leading figure of the reactionary opposition within the clergy against Patriarch Tikhon.\n\nAntony was elected as the Patriarch in 1925, and under him, the Church turned far more reactionary. Tikhon's acceptance of the autocephaly of the Ukrainian and Georgian churches was condemned, and the Church became more accepting of clergy taking part in right-wing politics, going so far as holding sermons for the restoration of the monarchy.

He graduated from the Imperial Moscow University in 1906 with a Bachelor's Degree in Law. During his studies, he became interested in German Idealism and the works of Kant, Schelling, and Hegel, remaining a committed Right-Hegelian throughout his life. During the 1905 Revolution, Ilyin became involved in politics and associated himself with the right wing of the Kadet party.\n\nAt Prince Yevgeny Nikolayevich Trubetskoy's suggestion, Ilyin began preparing for an academic career, familiarising himself with the latest trends in European philosophy. Ilyin awaited the Great War in 1914 as a patriot, which led him to vehemently oppose the October Coup in 1917, calling it a 'national catastrophe'. In 1918, he defended his dissertation 'Hegel's Philosophy as a Doctrine of the Concreteness of God and Man' and received his Doctorate. By the end of the Civil War in 1921, Ilyin chaired the Moscow Psychological Society and was a full-time professor at Moscow State University.\n\nLike many Russian Conservatives, Ilyin grew increasingly dissatisfied with the new Republican government, viewing it as a failure of 'liberal-democratic hypnosis'. As a committed anti-Bolshevik, he participated in various Nationalist rallies and connected with Vasily Shulgin. Ilyin joined Shulgin's Assembly for Russian Unification (SOR) in 1927, becoming its ideological theoretician. Despite his admiration for the SZRS party's methods in combating Bolshevism, his belief in the monarchical system meant he only tepidly supported Savinkov's regime in 1934.§!"

He was always a man of praxis, a man of action, who accused prominent socialist theorists of debating endlessly with no action. Not agreeing to fit into any single ideological slot, Maksimov was closest to the anarcho-syndicalists, and was a foundational member in various Russian syndcialist groups. However, he also claimed that the only true Marxist reading of Marx would be anarchism, genuinely fighting for the destruction of the state. His short part in the Red Army ended quickly due to his anti-Bolshevik views and uncompromising resistance to any Bolshevik attempts to control the peasantry of his local region.\n\nMaksimov's vision is a decentralised, partyless, classless, and moneyless society. A political party can only be used as the first step, but if not relegated to a secondary role, it will twist the workers' confederation of the future into a dictatorship, just as any other state institution. Thus Maksimov and his 'Bureau of Russian Anarcho-Syndicalists' represent perhaps the closest equivalent that Russia has to Western syndicalism, even though Maksimov also disagrees with most choices that the Western syndicalists have adopted.§!"

Mayorov and Kolegayev were the chief figures behind the Basic Law on the Socialisation of Land, passed by Lenin's government in 1918. Mayorov joined Maria Spiridonova as a major socialist opposition figure to the Bolsheviks, defending the peasantry as part of the working class, and opposing the Red Terror and the Brest Peace that abandoned Ukrainian and Belarusian comrades to German occupation. He was imprisoned after the Left-SR uprising and avoided sentencing after the war.\n\nMayorov finished his studies after the civil war, specialising in agricultural economy. He married Maria Spiridonova, his long-time comrade in arms, in 1925. As a couple, Spiridonova is the idealist and powerful orator, while Mayorov is more of an organiser and a theorist.

The wealthy young Aleksey was swept into the Socialist-Revolutionaries in 1902, and from that point on, there was no return. Ustinov, when not in prison, organised his own Eser terrorist cell in Saratov Gubernia and was naturally stripped of his nobility, being forced to flee into exile. During the Great War, Ustinov organised a revolutionary network among the Russian prisoners of war, preparing them for a great uprising. The time for that eventually came in 1917, and Ustinov immediately positioned himself on the far left end of the Esers, opposing Kerensky's government and any compromises with the bourgeois parties.\n\nLike many other Left-SRs, Ustinov worked among the people and became a prominent leader of the Helsingfors revolutionary sailors. Differences between the Maximalists and the rest of the party grew, as Ustinov and his followers veered closer and closer to the Bolsheviks to ensure 'bringing the revolution to its final stage'. Ustinov and the Maximalists greatly opposed the Bolsheviks on many issues, except the most important one - total dedication to the revolution.\n\nHe was among those Left-SRs who opposed their uprising and stood with the Bolsheviks to the bitter end. After the civil war, the Maximalists continued activity in their small terrorist cells, though in practice, Ustinov spent much time in exile in Belarus, France and so on, and focused on the political leadership of the Maximalist émigrés, while maintaining connections to Levandovsky's combat organisation.

He was arrested in 'the Nightmare Kingdom of Kolchak' as the White forces rolled through his town, but was later released as he had never supported the Bolsheviks, much less took part in the Red Terror.\n\nIn the 1920s, Zdobnov largely focused on his historical works and teaching in Moscow People's University, and published a thorough history of the Ural region. Despite being an SR member, he was not very active until the 1930s, when he was elected into the State Duma as a vocal critic of Savinkov. He became a well-known opposition figure and ally of Viktor Chernov - a crime for which he was sent to forced labour in Kolyma.

Kollontay was the most prominent and influential woman among the Bolsheviks. She was always mostly focused on women's causes - sexual freedom, women's literacy, childcare, and eventually the abolition of the family as a patriarchal structure. She spent her 1920s in Paris and London, and was an enthusiastic supporter of the Bolshevik-Menshevik thaw.

A doctor's son from Moldova, young Boris got involved with Ukrainian Esers from a young age and spent time both in Siberian penal labour and in exile in France.\n\nKamkov's rise to fame happened in the Petrograd Soviet, where he became one of the brightest and most charismatic Socialist-Revolutionaries, but he and other 'Kamkovites' quickly went against Kerensky's government. Boris, together with Maria Spiridonova and Mark Natanson, led a split from the SR party, taking the true revolutionaries to form their own party. Initially, Kamkov was cooperative with the Bolsheviks, but eventually turned against them as it was clear the Bolsheviks would not uphold Soviet democracy. 'We, as men at times of enormous political significance, can the least of all engage in moral characterisation', he described his stance of revolution before all else.\n\nThe tragedy of Left-SRs is known to all - their break with the Bolsheviks and their failed attempt to spark people's revolution against Lenin. Kamkov went underground like many other Esers, and survived the civil war. Since then, he became a pragmatic supporter of Left-SR cooperation with Chernov's SRs, though he was never a true believer in this cooperation unlike his colleague Karelin.\n\nKamkov's pessimistic attitude towards the bourgeois republic was validated by the ascension of Savinkov and the terrible repression, under which Kamkov served as leader of the party in exile until the victorious return of the Esers to Russia.§!"

For some time in 1921, he continued underground resistance but eventually was forced to flee Russia. In France, he had a change of heart, being convinced that it is exactly the direct mass action of syndicalism - the type of work Kirov himself excels at - that is fundamentally a better option than strict vanguardism.

Yakov's brother was an anarchist and his sister a communist, while he joined the PSR himself. The family also organised a Jewish self-defence group against pogroms. Blyumkin's trial by fire was the bloody revolutionary events of 1918, serving as a militia leader, bank robber, and a Cheka operative. He was the chief assassin of the Socialist-Revolutionary Party, and it was his murder of Count Wilhelm von Mirbach that sparked the Left-SR Uprising.\n\nAfter 1918, he was part of the SR underground resistance in Kiev, and later tried to assassinate the Supreme Leader Aleksandr Kolchak. He served the Bolsheviks briefly but remained an independent actor, taking part in various revolutions in the Russian hinterlands, forging connections to the Kuomintang and various socialist groups in Asia. For some time, he travelled in the Himalayas in search of the mystical Shambhala. He spent a few years spent in Palestine, arming and organising Jewish self-defence groups. In the 1930s, his secret organisation in Russia organised assassinations of Svobodniks and retaliatory killings of socialists, culminating in the failed attempt on Boris Savinkov's life in 1933.\n\nBlyumkin is incredibly skilled at intrigue, at the art of murder and deception, and is both feared and adored by many Russian revolutionaries. His political ideology is a mystery - if it is relevant at all - and he remains fiercely independent even in government service. All that matters is that Blyumkin has lived and killed for the revolution, and will continue on this path until it kills him.§!"

After serving in the 12th Belgorod Uhlan Regiment for six years, young Cornet Kazakov was transferred to Gatchina Military Aviation School in January of 1914, where he trained for the next 11 months to become a military pilot.\n\nJoining the Great War right after graduation, he would become the most effective pilot of the Russian Imperial Air Fleet. He scored his first kill in March of 1915, when he performed an air ramming on a German plane, making him the second pilot in the world to use that tactic, with the first being another Russian, Pyotr Nesterov. After successfully hitting the upper part of the German 'Albatros' with the wheels of his 'Morane-Saulnier L', he started to lose speed, but managed to land his fighter and survive, making him the first person in the world to survive an aerial ramming. Using the French 'Nieuport' fighter series for the rest of the war, Kazakov became an ace on the 21st of December 1916, and would finish the war with 17 personal kills and 15 group kills, although it is hard to count them with utmost certainty, as the Russian aerial tradition prioritised the contribution to the overall war effort over the individual score of the pilot.\n\nAfter the October Coup, Subcolonel Kazakov fled to Murmansk and later became the leader of the Slavo-British Air Corps after the British landing in Arkhangelsk. From that point on, he would spend all of the Russian Civil War fighting as part of the Northern Army, competing for air superiority with the Red Air Fleet, and adding six more kills to his track record.\n\nHis accomplishments during both wars turned him into a living legend, and he used that status to inspire people to join the various aviation clubs and schools around the country, trying to create an air force worthy of Russia. His efforts yielded results when the independent branch of the Russian Air Force was founded in 1929. Appointed as the first Chief of the Air Force of Russia, his vision for the future of aerial warfare includes a focus on aerial superiority and fighter planes as a main element of the Russian Air Fleet.§!"

He entered the Great War in 1916 after graduating from Kiev Aerial Reconnaissance Military School and finished the war with the rank of poruchik and the position of commander of the 2nd Artillery-Aerial Squad.\n\nAfter the start of the Russian Civil War, he joined the Red Army and was put in charge of the 1st Voronezh Air Group. Under his command, the air group managed to down five enemy planes, placing Lapchinsky in the spotlight of the high command, which led to his transfer to the staffs of the 8th and 9th armies, where he oversaw the field aviation department. Lapchinsky was captured by the Whites during the siege of Bryansk when his planes were grounded by bad weather, and, seeing that Red defeat was inevitable, offered his service to his captors. His military accomplishments and the lack of suspicious political activity allowed him to avoid trial, and he returned to the skies in July of 1920, this time flying under the banners of the Whites.\n\nAfter the end of the Russian Civil War, he was offered the position of professor at the Russian Military Air School, which he gladly accepted.

Using his position, he gave Sergey Ilyushin an opportunity to enrol in the Institute of Aerial Engineering in Moscow, paving the way for a genius aircraft designer. In 1925, he published an article titled 'Questions of Strategy and Tactics of the Russian Air Fleet', in which he argued for a focus on the destruction of enemy air forces, strategic aviation to be used against enemy home-front targets, and paratrooper operations.

However, unable to observe the dissolution of the military by the Bolsheviks, he left the army. He travelled to join the Volunteer Army in 1918 and was tasked with organising armed units in the Kuban under General Shkuro. Due to his continuous habit of leading attacks at the forefront, he was wounded at least nine times, becoming addicted to morphine to dull the pain. Despite this, Slashchyov rose through the ranks and commanded the 4th Infantry Division during Wrangel's 1919 Volga campaign, enjoying the love and affection of his men, who nicknamed him 'General Yasha'.\n\nHis condition from years of battle forced Slashchyov to retire from field command duty and become a teacher at the All-Russian General Staff Academy. Contributing to General Markov's theories, he became an ardent supporter of the motorisation of the Russian army. In 1929, he was finally assigned to the General Staff, where he is considered to be Markov's right-hand man and an opponent of Wrangel, as the two officers disagree fiercely both militarily and politically.§!"

In the Great War, he initially served in various cavalry regiments before being assigned as a staff officer.\n\nDuring the last days of the war, he served on the Northern Front and was captured by the Germans. When the German-Soviet relations broke down, Russian POWs like Rodzyanko were freed, and the Northern Army was formed in the United Baltic Duchy. Enlisting with the rank of General-Major, he quickly found himself elected to a leadership role in 1919 as the senior commanders resigned following the Pskov disaster. He consolidated the army remnants into the Northern Corps and maintained strict neutrality in the UBD's affairs. Launching a new offensive in May, the Northern Corps rapidly recaptured Pskov but failed to reach Petrograd. After creating the North-Western Army, Rodzyanko successfully solidified his command against General Nikolay Yudenich and finally captured Petrograd in late 1919. In 1920, the NWA was transformed into the 8th Army, and he was its commander during the 'March to Moscow'.\n\nFollowing a brief stint as head of the Petrograd Military District after the Civil War, Rodzyanko began to write extensively about his campaign and the use of armour and air force during it.
