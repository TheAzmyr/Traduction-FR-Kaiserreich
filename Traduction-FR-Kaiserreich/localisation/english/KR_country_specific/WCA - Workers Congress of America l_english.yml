### Parties ###
 WCA_totalist_party: "TUEL"
 WCA_totalist_party_long: "Trade Union Educational League\n§LThe latest and longest lasting of several Syndicalist labour organisations founded by William Z. Foster, the Trade Union Educational League was founded in 1920 from the remnants of Foster’s Syndicalist League of North America and International Trade Union Educational League. Opposed to the Socialist Party’s policies of electoral participation and the IWW’s strategy of dual unionism, the TUEL instead maintains an anti-political ultra-syndicalist approach of \"boring from within\" the Congress of Industrial Organizations, a strategy which has seen some success, particularly in Chicago, where the Chicago Federation of Labor led by John Fitzpatrick has become closely aligned with Foster. Ideologically meanwhile, the TUEL has diverged somewhat from mainstream socialism in America, promoting a form of \"Patriotic Syndicalism\" that borrows from Sorelian ideas emerging across the Atlantic.§!\n"

 WCA_syndicalist_party: "Socialists (Ind. Unionists)"
 WCA_syndicalist_party_long: "Socialist Party of America - Industrial Unionist Faction\n§LFounded in 1901, the Socialist Party of America quickly gained traction as the premier socialist political force in the United States. First drawing support from workers, farmers, immigrants, and social reformers, among others, it was soon faced with crisis, as the revolutionary wave of the late 1910s sparked a large factional struggle within the party, between the moderate \"Regulars\" and the \"Radicals\", who supported revolutionary action.\n\nUltimately, it was the Radicals who emerged victorious to shape the future of the party. Membership in the Third International was followed by calls for a \"workers’ and farmers’ government\", albeit of ambiguous form. The SPA nonetheless eventually chose to work from within Farmer-Labor, a move which allowed it to see significant electoral gains in the 1930s.\n\nNow that the revolution has reached the United States, the SPA is faced with the task of stewarding it. Though the Radicals were victorious in the ‘20s, questions remain regarding the form of any post-revolution government. While the more radical elements of the party support an explicitly syndicalist government, moderates envision a republican commonwealth of labour.§!\n"

 WCA_social_democrat_party: "Farmer-Labor"
 WCA_social_democrat_party_long: "Farmer-Labor Party\n§LWith the collapse of the old Farmer-Labor Party and the abrupt exit of the SPA from legal politics, those Farmer-Labor politicians who had sided with the revolution yet had still not joined the SPA reconstituted their party in Red territory. Though they remain independent of the SPA, they too have been radicalised by the revolution, now acting more as a progressive farmers’ pressure group than as a political party seriously contesting the rule of the socialists.§!\n"

 WCA_social_liberal_party: "Democrats (Lib.)"
 WCA_social_liberal_party_long: "Democratic Party - Liberal Faction\n§LThe oldest continually active political party in the world, the Democratic Party was founded over 100 years ago in 1828 by Andrew Jackson and Martin van Buren. Originally an agrarian populist party upholding Jeffersonian principles, it transformed first into a (generally) pro-slavery party, then into agrarian and southern opposition to the Republicans, and then into a western, southern, and increasingly urban party with liberal inclinations.\n\nThe liberal wing of the Democrats, usually associated with the north, follows largely in the legacy of Woodrow Wilson. It is generally supported by urban \"ethnic\" catholic voters, as well as liberals opposed to Farmer-Labor, and supports modest government intervention to support the economy, as well as greater participation on the world stage.§!\n"

 WCA_market_liberal_party: "Republicans"
 WCA_market_liberal_party_long: "Republican Party\n§LFounded in 1854 as a broad tent party opposed to Slave Power, the Republican Party has generally been regarded as the United States’ \"natural governing party\" since the end of the First American Civil War. Representing the industrial interests which came to predominate in the country after the defeat of Slave Power, as well as northeastern old stock protestants and wealthier western farmers, the Republican coalition has until recently generally maintained a long-term stranglehold on US politics.\n\nDivided between progressive, liberal, and conservative wings, the ideological divides of the \"Grand Old Party\" are generally more mild than that of the Democrats or Progressives. Conservative Republicans generally support higher tariffs and laissez-faire economics, while liberal or progressive Republicans are inclined towards tariff reform and economic interventionism, though to a less centralised degree than other liberals. They also differ on foreign policy, where liberals favour more foreign involvement, in contrast to isolationist progressives and conservatives.§!\n"

 WCA_social_conservative_party: "Democrats (Con.)"
 WCA_social_conservative_party_long: "Democratic Party - Conservative Faction\n§LThe oldest continually active political party in the world, the Democratic Party was founded over 100 years ago in 1828 by Andrew Jackson and Martin van Buren. Originally an agrarian populist party upholding Jeffersonian principles, it transformed first into a (generally) pro-slavery party, then into agrarian and southern opposition to the Republicans, and then into a western, southern, and increasingly urban party with liberal inclinations.\n\nThe conservative wing of the Democrats, usually associated with the south, has been dominant in that region since the end of reconstruction. It is the natural ruling party in most of the south, with nomination tantamount to election. Divided between agrarian reactionaries and more reform-minded moderate conservatives, they are generally opposed to Civil Rights reform and cartelisation of the economy, supporting smaller businesses and landowners.§!\n"

 WCA_authoritarian_democrat_party: "Union (Reactionaries)"
 WCA_authoritarian_democrat_party_long: "Union Party - Reactionary Faction\n§LThe newest major party in US politics, the Union Party was recently formed primarily as a vehicle for Huey Long’s bid for the Presidency, when it became clear he would not be able to attain the Democratic nomination. A broad-tent alliance comprising Democrats, reactionaries, and anti-syndicalist Progressives, they are united by little more than their shared opposition to the Smith Administration, and at least a temporary unity behind Long as their leader.\n\nThough traditionally Long’s base of support has been in the midwestern farm states, reactionary and populist southern Democratic leaders such as Eugene Talmadge and Theodore Bilbo have rallied behind Long out of their opposition to Smith. These southern Democrats are united primarily by their belief in white supremacy and disdain for Smith’s particular brand of liberalism. Their unity behind Long however is clearly conditional, and unlikely to last if push comes to shove.§!\n"

Long has aligned himself with western senators such as Burton Wheeler, who have come out to support his \"Share Our Wealth\" platform. It is this western faction of Long’s new party which is most loyal to him personally, and likely to stick with him through thick and thin.§!\n"

 WCA_totalist_party_postwar: "TUUL"
 WCA_totalist_party_postwar_long_tt: "Trade Union Unity League"
 WCA_totalist_party_postwar_long: "$WCA_totalist_party_postwar_long_tt$\n§LInitially formed as the \"Trade Union Educational League\" by William Z. Foster, what is now the TUUL was formed in 1920 from the remnants of Foster’s Syndicalist League of North America and International Trade Union Educational League. Working first within the AFL and then within the CIO, the organisation sought to \"bore from within\" the established unions, as opposed to the dual unionist IWW. During the civil war, the League represented a growing tendency of radicals, however during the constitutional convention its attempts to manoeuvre itself into power within the CIO failed. With Foster choosing to retire in the aftermath due to his failing health, his protege Earl Browder, facing the imminent loss of the League's power base in the steel union, chose to formally split the organisation from the CIO.\n\nThe result is America's fourth (and smallest) trade union centre, which advocates for an eclectic mix of Foster's pseudo-Sorelian \"Patriotic Syndicalism\" and Browder's Maximist plannism, all draped in the colours of the previous American revolutionary tradition, with busts of Lincoln and Jefferson taking pride of place at their rallies. Isolated from the emergent major parties, the TUUL is unlikely to have more success as an independent union than as a faction within the CIO.§!\n"

 WCA_totalist_party_postwar_takeover: "CIO"
 WCA_totalist_party_postwar_takeover_long_tt: "Congress of Industrial Organizations"
 WCA_totalist_party_postwar_takeover_long: "$WCA_totalist_party_postwar_takeover_long_tt$\n§LFormed in 1929 from former AFL unions dissatisfied with conservative craft union leadership, the Congress of Industrial Organizations was initially conceived as a broad church containing Industrial Unionists too conservative for the IWW and unable to stomach the elitism and conservatism of the AFL. Aligning with the SPA in forming Farmer-Labor, the CIO was crucial in getting the Red government off the ground, and enthusiastically supported revolution in 1937. Revolution brought about transformation however, and the CIO soon radicalised. Earl Browder and William Z. Foster's Trade Union Educational League, a ultra-syndicalist grouping within the CIO, gained more and more prominence, and during the second constitutional convention was able to take over the CIO, completing Foster's dream of \"boring from within\" the established unions.\n\nNot long after, an ultra-syndialist slate was elected to the provisional executive, and the new TUEL-controlled CIO took command of the state. Far from being the moderate wing of unionism during the civil war, the new leadership combines a commitment to industrial government with a surprising embrace of the previous American revolutionary tradition, with busts of Lincoln and Jefferson taking pride of place at their rallies. Only time will tell if this \"Patriotic Syndicalism\" is what will bring America back into the ranks of the great powers.§!\n"

 WCA_syndicalist_party_postwar: "Socialists"

Though the Radicals were victorious in the ‘20s, questions remain regarding the form of any post-revolution government. With the victory of Red forces in the Civil War, the moderate element within the SPA has removed itself, splitting off to form the Commonwealth Party. What is left is an explicitly Industrial Unionist party bound by the hip to the IWW.§!\n"

 WCA_radical_socialist_party_postwar_long: "$WCA_radical_socialist_party_postwar_long_tt$\n§LWith the victory of Red forces in the Civil War, it became clear that the relative wartime unity of the SPA was not to last. John Reed’s retirement from active political life meant that the party would soon be bereft of its unifying figure, and soon the infighting which had defined the party in the bad years of the 1920s came roaring back.\n\nThough the constitutional questions were decided on the floor of the convention, the question of power over the party apparatus itself was waged separately. Ultimately, Reed's Industrial Unionist allies maintained their leadership of the SPA, and the moderate followers of Norman Thomas broke off to form the new American Commonwealth Party. The young ACP has defined itself in terms of a responsible revolution, fully supporting the revolutionary transformation of American society while placing emphasis on maintaining civil liberties (even for reactionaries), and opposing a resurgence in militarism. It has become closely aligned with the CIO, which has been sidelined by the new SPA-IWW establishment.§!\n"

 WCA_social_revolution_desc: "The land of the free and the home of the brave was anything but. We have our work cut out for us in ridding America of corruption, racism, and chauvinism. The first step is to tear up the very core of all these things - the capitalist system itself!"

 WCA_permanent_revolution: "Permanent Revolution"
 WCA_permanent_revolution_desc: "Old bourgeois legalism was a tool for the legitimisation of the bourgeois state. With the advent of the epoch of proletarian revolution, it has become obsolete.

The separation between executive and legislature shall not exist in the commune."
 WCA_enshrine_socialist_democracy: "Enshrine Socialist Democracy"
 WCA_enshrine_socialist_democracy_desc: "The constitution passed after the civil war was a threadbare document. Syndicalist resistance to formalised rules and procedures left an easily amended document that only outlined the very basics of our government's structure. This is, of course, ripe for abuse.

 WCA_central_planning: "Central Planning"
 WCA_central_planning_desc: "The experience of the Union of Britain has demonstrated one thing very clearly: planning is the future. The anarchy of production present in capitalism is incapable of returning a war-torn country to stability. Today, even many capitalist states recognise this. The bourgeois dictatorships however are incapable of bringing production under the control of a centralised apparatus. We, however, can and will."
 WCA_monopoly_on_foreign_trade: "Monopoly On Foreign Trade"
 WCA_monopoly_on_foreign_trade_desc: "Until the world revolution is concluded, trade with capitalist states is an unfortunate inevitability. If we are not careful, such trade may empower what remains of our domestic bourgeoisie. It is thus essential that we establish a state monopoly on foreign trade, both to maximise our bargaining power as well as to ensure the fruits of trade are directed to the benefit of the proletariat."
 WCA_workers_cooperatives: "Worker's Cooperatives"
 WCA_workers_cooperatives_desc: "Though our program of central planning is sound, it is obvious that we cannot micromanage every part of the economy.

 WCA_full_employment_desc: "Unemployment is a scourge. Not only has it thrown millions of Americans into poverty over the past two decades, it has also resulted in a massive underutilisation of American labour. Though capitalism requires a reserve army of labour to function, we are now freed from this restriction. Our planned economy will aspire towards full employment of every American."
 WCA_new_planning_districts: "New Planning Districts"
 WCA_new_planning_districts_desc: "America's industrial recovery will require a whole new way of thinking about economic planning. Renovations of existing industry and development of new industry must occur in harmony with one another, rather than in competition. If American industry is to thrive it must support itself as a whole, rather than competing through an anarchic market."
 WCA_american_syndicalism: "New American Socialism"
 WCA_american_syndicalism_desc: "America has finally left exploitative capitalism behind and is now marching eagerly towards a brighter future. Though the IWW complains of the marginalisation of the unions in our system of planning, they cannot deny that it has returned the country to a state of economic prosperity. Together, the American people look to a brighter tomorrow."
 WCA_unionist_economics: "Decentralised Planning"
 WCA_unionist_economics_desc: "With the end of the rule of the bourgeoisie, the time has come for the proletariat to govern in its own image. As previous socialist experiments have shown, this takes the form of a combination of workers' councils and industrial unions, which will form the basis for a locally planned and managed economy, working towards a commonwealth-wide goal."
 WCA_industrial_unionism: "Industrial Unionism"
 WCA_industrial_unionism_desc: "The victory of the revolution will not be complete until the principle of industrial unionism is established for all American workers. Accordingly, in sectors that have not already been unionised, we must establish robust industrial unions to represent the workers. Some even talk of such innovations as a housewives union, or elevating the IWW's unemployed organisation to the status of an industrial union."
 WCA_workers_self_managment: "Worker's Self-Management"
 WCA_workers_self_managment_desc: "The class struggle, as expressed in revolutionary socialism, is the struggle to place the management and control of industry in the hands of the workers through the overthrow of capitalism and its state. Through this, we will achieve what Engels called the administration of things: the state and \"democracy\" shall disappear, and make way for the communism of organised producers."
 WCA_industrial_democracy: "Industrial Democracy"
 WCA_industrial_democracy_desc: "The dictatorship of the workplace rendered bourgeois democracy a farce. With the revolution, the American proletariat stood up to demand control over their own lives and workplaces. To that end, we have formalised the system of shop stewards, factory committees, and other institutions of industrial government that popped up during the civil war. Now, their rights and status will be guaranteed by the commonwealth government."
 WCA_agricultural_unions: "Agricultural Unions"
 WCA_agricultural_unions_desc: "American agriculture has been treated differently to many other industries, in that we have comparatively little interest in expropriating or collectivising its small producers. The IWW however, now unburdened by state repression, has launched the biggest organising drive in its history in the agricultural sector. Though they may not be collectivised, the farm owners will have to face accountability to labour's law."
 WCA_syndicalist_economics: "Communal Devolution"
 WCA_syndicalist_economics_desc: "The revolution has brought forth an awakening of self-sustaining communes in the cities and even counties. These communes cooperate closely with their neighbours and maintain a well-functioning social order. Although this system is nowhere near utopian, it is the first step towards a true worker's paradise!"
 WCA_protect_the_revolution: "Protect the Revolution"
 WCA_protect_the_revolution_desc: "Maintaining and protecting the spirit of the revolution will be vital in the coming years. We face enormous outside pressure from the reactionary powers around the world, sabotage from dissidents within our own nation, and the strife of factionalism even amongst our leadership. Our will isn't yet broken though, the struggle continues!"
 WCA_general_defense_comitte: "General Defense Committee"
 WCA_general_defense_comitte_desc: "Entrusting military leadership and the safety our nation to a group of elites can only end poorly. We must ensure that our Commonwealth remains meritocratic and free from corruption, as such Congress has organised a committee of union advisors and military strategists."
 WCA_independent_media: "Protect Free Speech"
 WCA_independent_media_desc: "The free media and the right to free speech is an unalienable right to the American people. The Court system has reaffirmed the right to free speech in spite of calls for censorship. Let the reactionaries and traitors shout what they will, their treasonous drivel be drowned out by the cries of our comrades celebrating a new age of prosperity!"
 WCA_strategic_services: "Committee of Strategic Services"
 WCA_strategic_services_desc: "While the General Defense Committee has proven quite effective it has also been criticised as being too open and public. It is a shame to have to conspire in secret from our citizens, but we can at least ensure that this second Congressional Committee will uphold the spirit of the revolution and be closely supervised."

### Union of American States Focuses ###
 WCA_usas: "United Socialist States of America"
 WCA_usas_desc: "The authoritarian is ascendant, as the petty squabbles of the Constitutional Convention have ended in favour of a strong and centralised syndicalist government. The USSA will show the world that the civil war has done nothing to reduce nations strength and influence, it has merely been redirected to the new revolutionary cause of Syndicalism!"
 WCA_lead_the_revolution: "Lead The Revolution"
 WCA_lead_the_revolution_desc: "Syndicalist America is a centrist nation, not subject to IWW mob rule or Farmer-Labor backsliding. Thankfully, our loyal Industrial Unions and anti-Judiciary advocates understand this. Making sure that our new Union does not collapse into infighting, reaction will be the first agenda of our new government."
 WCA_peoples_commisars: "People's Commissars"
 WCA_peoples_commisars_desc: "Already during the civil war, we had many militias, communes and syndicates adopting a system of Political Commissars. These watchful and vigilant citizens kept a close eye on any potential counterrevolutionaries within our ranks. Congress has allowed these commissars under direct state control, and expanded the system nationwide."
 WCA_politics: "Democratic Centralism"
 WCA_politics_desc: "The concept of Democratic Centralism where once a decision is made by the Central Committee then it must be followed by those lower within the party and government. A Central Committee over Congress was voted in, and they shall have the final say on policy changes. Only reactionaries and traitors should fear us."
 WCA_communist_party: "Ban Wall-to-Wall Elections"
 WCA_communist_party_desc: "Despite our centralisation of power, there's still some squabbling amongst Congress. We cannot progress if the IWW, CIO, and all the other acronyms squabble. Don't they realise that unity behind us is the centrist position, and we are the only things keeping the revolution from tearing itself apart. Thus goes the anarchistic wall to wall elections of the IWW."
 WCA_proletarian_dictatorship: "Dictatorship of the Proletariat"
 WCA_proletarian_dictatorship_desc: "Everything we have achieved so far has been won with violence and force, the bourgeois thought still clinging to America cannot be voted away, it cannot be debated or discussed away, it must simply be destroyed. How else can anything take its place, if we tolerate the past? Their actions are treason, and the Committee the judge."
 WCA_fosters_economics: "Foster's Economic Policy"
 WCA_fosters_economics_desc: "William Foster has managed to successfully push through his radical policies, as outlined in his manifesto, \"Toward Syndicalist America.\" Foster has immediately called for mass nationalisation of all industries and natural resources, as well as a series of radical reforms to protect unions."
 WCA_resource_nationalization: "Resource Nationalisation"
 WCA_resource_nationalization_desc: "The establishment of a truly American Syndicalist government will require the confiscation of large landed estates in every state of the Union. Including the whole body of forests, mineral deposits, lakes, and so on. No longer will Americans be under the yoke of the bourgeoisie."
 WCA_union_managment: "Protect Industrial Unions"
 WCA_union_managment_desc: "The Trade Unions perform a very important function within our economy. But they do not of themselves actually lead the production, this being the responsibility of the government economic organs. Our loyal Industrial Unions gladly comply with close local and national supervision from the Party to protect their rights from mob rule."
 WCA_collective_farming: "Green Fields Program"
 WCA_collective_farming_desc: "The Committee has approved of the Green Fields Program to the millions of acres of seized land. This is seen by the public as preferable to collectivisation, as it brings back the competitive spirit in land acquisition. This programme places land that was either seized or set aside for state use to the lowest bidder who promises the highest yield."
 WCA_decentralized_planning: "Socialist Self-Management"
 WCA_decentralized_planning_desc: "The Central Committee will immediately proceed with the difficult task of creating an adequate supply of reliable technicians and managers for the industries. The scattered technical institutes, trade schools, correspondence schools, etc., will be organised, expanded and linked up directly with the industries."
 WCA_nat_syndicalist_econ: "Centralised Syndicalism"
 WCA_nat_syndicalist_econ_desc: "The Proletarian revolution initiates changes more rapid and far-reaching than any in the whole history of mankind. The hundreds of millions of workers and peasants, smashing their chains of slavery, will construct a society of liberty and intelligent prosperity. Syndicalism will inaugurate a new era for the human race, the building of a new world."
 WCA_browders_economics: "Browder's Economic Policy"
 WCA_browders_economics_desc: "Earl Russell Browder has managed to successfully introduce a series of policies meant to forge a stable, predictable economy. Built mainly on industrial plans and the direct control of several sectors of the economy by the state, through the use of commissariats and quotas. The Committee and the unions in Congress have received it well."
 WCA_price_controls: "Price Controls"
 WCA_price_controls_desc: "It is characteristic of capitalism that when its economic machinery enters a crisis, the explanation is immediately found not in lack of production, but in overproduction. We shall avoid the tragedy of burning crops we saw during the revolution through Committee-decided price limits and expropriation of unused surplus."
 WCA_control_unions: "Dismantle the IWW"
 WCA_control_unions_desc: "The IWW, though noble in concept, had the ultimate result of isolating the class-conscious workers from the our leadership of the revolution. Their continued influence threatens not only our rule, but the entire stability of new America. The true constituents of the USSA, the people, see that a non-partisan All-Industrial Congress represents their interests better."
 WCA_state_farms: "Collective Farms"
 WCA_state_farms_desc: "The State agriculture organisation is now grouped under the Committee's Commissariat of Agriculture, and is formed into trusts for individual crops and geographical divisions of the industry. Crops are sold either directly to the government, to the cooperatives, or, in a very rapidly lessening extent, upon the open local markets."
 WCA_state_quotas: "State Quotas"
 WCA_state_quotas_desc: "Introducing quotas makes maximum utilisation of all the productive forces, men and machinery, and constantly raises the level of performance by the systematic application of scientific principles. The Committee has refused the idea of awards for meeting quotes, stating that advancement in the economy should be a reward, not an expectation."
 WCA_planned_economy: "Browder's Anticapitalist Society"
 WCA_planned_economy_desc: "Browder's Committee has approved a national plan, which declares a total economic war against the forces of monarchism and reaction. Therefore, industrial decision-making shall be socialised. Exemplar facilities will be observed as schools for uplifting others, while failing facilities will be required to adjust or be liquidated."
 WCA_defend_the_revolution: "Defend the Revolution"
 WCA_defend_the_revolution_desc: "All the forces of capital and reaction are conspiring to destroy the new order. We face not just a war of ideals, but a war of bloody sabotage and shady subterfuge, one that must be won at all cost. Traitors in our own midst thankfully can be prosecuted."
 WCA_revolutionary_guards: "Revolutionary Guards"
 WCA_revolutionary_guards_desc: "Exercising our new authority in order to crush terrorists, conterrevolutionaries and traitors will require the creation of new, well-structured military and law enforcement agencies, not any wayward Red Guards or crazed vigilantes."
 WCA_state_media: "State Media Initiative"
 WCA_state_media_desc: "The Daily Worker, Hollywood, and now the radio have all been seized by the Artists' Congress by the CC's graces. Under the tutelage of such luminary socialist thinkers such as Hemingway, Welles, and Hughes, all the world will know of the American Socialist revolution."
 WCA_create_the_csb: "Create the CSB"
 WCA_create_the_csb_desc: "In order to defeat the class enemies of the revolution, we have laid the groundwork for a Central Security Bureau, managed directly by the ruling committee. A clandestine security organisation that will always have an iron fist or a dagger in the back ready for counter-revolutionaries."

### Army Focuses ###
 WCA_second_continental_army: "The Second Continental Army"
 WCA_second_continental_army_desc: "\"The revolution has begun!\" - zeal and enthusiasm are pouring forth as people line up to support our brave volunteers. Regular Chicagoans even say that \"we'll take Washington in a week and then the reactionaries will surely collapse!\". People are ready to get rid of the capitalistic government."
 WCA_a_gun_in_hand: "A Gun In Hand"
 WCA_a_gun_in_hand_desc: "'What more could a man need than a gun? Why a better gun of course!' Massed infantry dominates our army - and we should ensure they are as well-armed as possible."
 WCA_a_boot_under_foot: "Uniforms And Grenades"
 WCA_a_boot_under_foot_desc: "Our forces thus far lack even a standard uniform. By adapting a standard set of combat fatigues as well as producing a set pattern of mortars, grenades and machine guns, we can keep our boys ready for anything."
 WCA_appoint_butler: "CIC: Smedley Butler"
 WCA_appoint_butler_desc: "Former Marine Corps general Smedley Butler has stepped up to lead our armies as Commander in Chief. We wish him luck, and are eagerly looking to his experience and his ideas in the fields of doctrine and war materiel."
 WCA_creating_cohesion: "Political Officers"
 WCA_creating_cohesion_desc: "Our militiamen are enthusiastic, but they lack an education in the finer points of socialist theory. In order to keep morale up and ensure that more uncertain occupied areas see the benefits of the revolution we intend to create so-called political officers who will be responsible for helping us win hearts and minds."
 WCA_the_long_haul: "The Long War"
 WCA_the_long_haul_desc: "Our earlier optimism may have been misplaced - it seems as though the American Revolution will be lasting much longer than anticipated, and so we must broaden the depth and complexity of our military programme."
 WCA_disciplinary_standards: "Enforce Discipline"
 WCA_disciplinary_standards_desc: "One of the increasing problems we are suffering is a lack of organisation and frequent insubordination in our forces, to this end we have re-created the Military Police and intend to crack down on those who disobey orders."
 WCA_the_second_draft: "Women's Military Equality Act"
 WCA_the_second_draft_desc: "As the war continues on, young women join our forces or even mask themselves as men to serve in our military. By allowing them to serve on the front lines, we can show our commitment to equality and the progress of women in the new America."
 WCA_upgrade_the_m1: "Roll Out The AO-2"
 WCA_upgrade_the_m1_desc: "Production of a new battle rifle, based on a design by Auto-Ordnance rejected by the bourgeois military, should be sped along in order to ensure we have top-class weaponry. Our best workers have already started a discussion on improving the production lines for the new rifle."
 WCA_baptism_by_fire: "New European Military Schools"
 WCA_baptism_by_fire_desc: "The Army War College in Pennsylvania was closed at the start of the war for its potential to serve as a hotbed of pro-federal sentiment and reaction. Now however we see that there may be some value in making use of its facilities, to educate the officers of the New America."
 WCA_standardize_unit_sizes: "Reorganise Unit Size"
 WCA_standardize_unit_sizes_desc: "Our Red Guard militia forces have done well to take us this far, but their irregular numbers, often simply based on however many willing men can be found in a given town, hamper their ability in the field. By creating a table of standard unit sizes and uniting different units under command of Armies, we can enforce better interaction of our units in the field."
 WCA_field_canon: "The Red Dragon"
 WCA_field_canon_desc: "The 240mm Howitzer, nicknamed the \"Red Dragon\" by our troops, is the latest in heavy field guns for use by our army. Traditionally we have failed to make much use of artillery but now we should be able to deploy heavy support whenever our troops need to enter battle against fortified positions."
 WCA_motorisation: "A Motorised Force"
 WCA_motorisation_desc: "Motorisation is the key to modern armies, with mobile infantry the backbone of an effective force. By ensuring that our combat-ready motors are up to date we can keep our edge in this field."
 WCA_every_man_a_truck: "Redouble Production"
 WCA_every_man_a_truck_desc: "The order has come down from the highest authority: every effort is to be made to produce enough material for the revolutionary war and nothing is to be wasted."
 WCA_reactivate_the_officer_corps: "Create NCO Field Schools"
 WCA_reactivate_the_officer_corps_desc: "We shall create Non-Commissioned Officers' Field Schools to allow our unit leaders to be trained and educated by the older generation. Our best commanders who met enemies of syndicalism in battle shall become their teachers."
 WCA_the_dust_settles: "The Dust Settles"
 WCA_the_dust_settles_desc: "As the revolution comes to a close and victory seems to be in sight, we must now take stock and evaluate the state of the army comprehensively. Already proposals are flurrying about this project or that to enhance our military might."

 WCA_red_magic: "Red M.A.G.I.C"
 WCA_red_magic_desc: "M.A.G.I.C was the name of a US spying project to decipher Japanese military codes, and its principles can be applied to our own army too, in order to speed the development of electronic warfare."
 WCA_armoured_thrust: "The Armoured Thrust"
 WCA_armoured_thrust_desc: "Tanks have changed modern warfare. While ossified nations still rely on Weltkrieg tactics, we must look to the future and ensure that our forces have the number of modern vehicles and tanks that can lead us to victory."

 WCA_organise_pilots: "Organise Pilots"
 WCA_organise_pilots_desc: "For some time, our aviation forces have consisted of unorganised pilots who seized their planes or got them from manufacturers directly. This has led to a situation where pilots are freely moving between different sections of the front — usually leaving our forces without air support. This practice must be stopped, and pilots must be organised into squadrons and attached to battle areas."

 WCA_continental_airforce: "Create the Continental Air Force"
 WCA_continental_airforce_desc: "Even before the Second Revolution, it was obvious that the air forces worked better if they were not tied to the ground command. Although our adversaries still rely on old air tactics and organisation, we must move forward and begin organising independent air forces."

 WCA_second_continental_navy: "The Second Continental Navy"
 WCA_second_continental_navy_desc: "Created at the start of the Second American Revolution, our navy is mostly composed of seized ships, led by ideological comrades as Admirals. In the coming months and years we must make major decisions on the doctrine and philosophy of our new navy. As it is built up from both captured federal ships and brand new ships from our comrades on the dockyards, our navy will soon be a force to be reckoned with."

 WCA_red_angels: "Red Angels"
 WCA_red_angels_desc: "With the ever growing presence of our air force and ever growing needs of the battlefield, new experimental Air Doctrine has been charted. Innovations presented to us in response to the Hang-glider operations pioneered in Europe by capitalist countries. With many volunteers from the Civil War veterans, the army command has authorised the experiments."

 WCA_american_air_industry: "American Air Industry"
 WCA_american_air_industry_desc: "America is a country in which there have always been the best pilots and the largest aircraft industry in the world. Now, with the advent of the revolution, we have lost air superiority. But confident actions will restore one of America's pride - with the new government-approved plan, we will subsidise our aircraft industry and be ready for battle on American soil or abroad."

 WCA_caf_schools: "Air Force Schools"
 WCA_caf_schools_desc: "After the end of the civil war, we got a lot of experienced aces who can train the pilots and aces of the next generation and will create the theory of modern air war. The creation of special flight schools under the command of the Continental Air Force will organise this process."

 WCA_continental_air_command: "Continental Air Command"
 WCA_continental_air_command_desc: "Most of our military experts propose the creation of a Continental Air Command, which will unite our air forces in a single whole. This will separate them from the army command and give more freedom in action. Although this step has its advantages, it is definitely not supported by people who consider this a return to U.S. centralisation policies."

 WCA_state_air_force: "State Air Forces"
 WCA_state_air_force_desc: "While some members of the government suggest the Air Force be subordinate to the central command - the first intention was to decentralise the Air Force and create their branches at the states' level. Although this will limit our ability to train pilots for long-distance flights, they will be more effective in supporting the troops with which they will share training even in peacetime."

 WCA_wings_of_revolution: "Wings of the Revolution"
 WCA_wings_of_revolution_desc: "In time of the Second Revolution pilots, who put their lives on the line for those who have come after them, made a great sacrifice so that the people of America will be the first in the air. Now when we have returned our aviation industry to the pre-war level and trained our pilots to mastery that can never be reached by capitalist countries, we are ready to protect workers in all parts of the world."

 WCA_professionalize_continental_army: "Professionalise the Continental Army"
 WCA_professionalize_continental_army_desc: "Despite the opposition of some political circles to this step, our high command has a plan to professionalise our militias and turn them into a proper army. Although our lower-level commanders and some militias are concerned about this step and look at it as a return to pre-revolutionary times, this will definitely improve the effectiveness of our soldiers and command."

 WCA_states_red_guards: "States' Red Guards"
 WCA_states_red_guards_desc: "Most of our political apparatus insists on the creation of state militias who will submit to the central command only in wartime. Although the proposed plan is close to the pre-war organisation of the US Army, there is a big difference - since any militias will be subordinate only to the local state's army command - and which, in turn, will be subordinate to the central command."

 WCA_distribution_of_duties: "Distribution of Duties"
 WCA_distribution_of_duties_desc: "While our the State Army Commands will plan the battles, our central command should concentrate its efforts on planning entire campaigns, supply lines and interaction between the armies of different states. This will allow us to quickly and efficiently solve any problems that the army may encounter in the war and defend the Second Revolution from reactionaries."

 WCA_armies_of_states: "Armies of the States"
 WCA_armies_of_states_desc: "After the new army reform, we decided to organise separate State Armies that will be responsible for training our soldiers, for their equipment and commanding them on the battlefields. Although this has led to great zeal and the arrival of a huge number of recruits in our new armies, we need to set minimum standards for them."

 WCA_american_red_guard_corps: "American Red Guard Corps"
 WCA_american_red_guard_corps_desc: "The reforms were successful, but a decentralised army cannot quickly respond to some problems on the battlefields without the force that will be directly subordinated to our high command. The Department of the Commander-in-Chief has already proposed the creation of the American Red Guard Corps, which will be under the direct supervision of the headquarters of the Continental Army."

 WCA_revolutionary_naval_industry: "Revolutionary Naval Industry"
 WCA_revolutionary_naval_industry_desc: "The superiority of the old U.S fleet was not only in our commanders, but also in Fleet size. Although we still do not have as many shipyards and factories as the United States had before the war, we can focus on specific ships and simplify production."

 WCA_new_american_dockyards: "New American Dockyards"
 WCA_new_american_dockyards_desc: "Most shipyards were damaged or lost their workers during the Second Revolution. The restoration of the old and the reform of the present naval facilities will be the second step towards the restoration of the American Navy. Competitions of new ships have already begun and will help us not only recreate the American Navy, but also get rid of old designs that proved to be ineffective."

 WCA_martime_industry: "American Maritime Industry"
 WCA_martime_industry_desc: "Most shipyards were damaged or lost their workers during the Second Revolution. The restoration of the old and the reform of the present naval facilities will be the second step towards the restoration of the American Navy. Competitions of new ships have already begun and will help us not only recreate the American Navy, but also get rid of old designs that proved to be ineffective."

 WCA_new_naval_plan: "New Naval Plan"
 WCA_new_naval_plan_desc: "With the victory in the Civil War, the American fleet was harshly damaged - many officers and sailors joined the reactionary forces and fought against the will of the people. In the end, when they were defeated, they damaged and destroyed their ships. Our oldest naval commanders propose starting the restoration of the American fleet to its former status."

 WCA_american_peoples_navy_desc: "With the Civil War over, some politicians say that our current need is to protect the American people. The idea was proposed to reintroduce the old American naval doctrine - but an additional proposal was made by former members of the Naval Militia who joined our side - creation of a new American Navy based on states' command, which would unite under leadership of the central command only in wartime."

 WCA_refit_old_ships: "Refit Old Ships"
 WCA_refit_old_ships_desc: "Our fleet mainly consists of old ships that date from the beginning of the 20th century or even the end of the 19th century. During the Civil War, our captains and engineers already began installing custom modifications on ships. Some of them have developed plans and equipment to improve the conversion of our ships to modern standards."

 WCA_liberty_ships: "Liberty Ships"
 WCA_liberty_ships_desc: "Our dockyard has at last switched to a new model of production. We can easily produce a massive number of convoys to supply our allies around the world."

 WCA_revolution_on_high_seas: "Revolution on the High Seas"
 WCA_revolution_on_high_seas_desc: "The old federal fleet was limited to 'naval traditions' that did not allow them to see that aircraft carriers would rule the oceans in the future. Although our oldest admirals are still inclined to the idea of 'big guns and armour', they agreed that the aircraft was very effective against enemy ships. We need to ensure that the new American Navy receives air support when it is needed in any part of the world."

 WCA_recreate_continental_marines: "Recreate the Continental Marines"
 WCA_recreate_continental_marines_desc: "In the past, the Continental Marine Corps proudly fought against the British oppressors. Many of the soldiers of its successor, the U. S. Marine Corps, under the command of Smedley Butler, joined us when we met with the capitalists in the Second Revolutionary War. With recreation of the navy, we need to be sure that we organise and train forces that can meet with other enemies of the Revolution abroad."

 WCA_navy_of_new_age: "Navy of a New Age"
 WCA_navy_of_new_age_desc: "The second revolution almost destroyed the navy, and none of us expected that we could recreate the old American fleet. But it was restored - perhaps not in the same quantity and form, but now the old ships have been replaced by new ones. Without the old biased admirals, naval tactics have been modernised. And now the New American Navy is ready to defend freedom in America - or around the world."

 WCA_armour_development: "Armour Development"
 WCA_armour_development_desc: "The role of armour was neglected by the old America, and now we must make great strides in very little time to update our forces. With the experience that we gained in the Civil War and handed over to our engineers, we already have several proposals for creating a modern tank."

 WCA_armoured_vehicles_industry: "Armoured Vehicle Industry"
 WCA_armoured_vehicles_industry_desc: "The Civil War forced us to rely on motorised units and proved their effectiveness. But it also showed that motorised infantry needed more armoured vehicles which could protect them on the battlefield from enemy bullets and shells."

 WCA_anti_tank_production: "Anti-Tank Production"
 WCA_anti_tank_production_desc: "Enemy armour is worthless when faced with high ordnance and dedicated anti-tank units that can smash them to pieces. Unlike tanks, we can attach anti-tank guns to our units and produce them in greater numbers."

 WCA_continental_red_army: "Continental Red Army"
 WCA_continental_red_army_desc: "Our army needs only the best soldiers. For this purpose, the local Red Guards will be transformed into our reserve forces, which will be drafted into the army in case of war. Already trained by army standards, with the same equipment - they can replenish our army if necessary. But this also means that we must raise our standards for the Red Guard."

 WCA_increase_military_spending: "Increase Military Spending"
 WCA_increase_military_spending_desc: "The Civil War devastated the American Civilian industry, but has made the Military Industry quite a profitable enterprise. While the Civil war may be over, America still has enemies to fight and wars to win, and as such keeping the Civil War military spending and expanding upon it is on our best interests."

 WCA_defense_logistics_agency: "Defense Logistics Agency"
 WCA_defense_logistics_agency_desc: "America is an enormous country, full of varied terrain. We need to create a centralised logistics board able to coordinate warfare across the varied biomes of America."

 WCA_always_ready_always_there: "Always Ready, Always There"
 WCA_always_ready_always_there_desc: "Our New Army has come a long way from inexperienced militias to true fighting force with an American spirit in their hearts. With the final reforms, we need to adopt the motto of the old colonial forces. This motto will show that our army is always ready to fight for the workers, always ready to defend the Second Revolution."

 WCA_red_ball_express: "Red Ball Express"
 WCA_red_ball_express_desc: "Use of the term \"Red Ball\" to describe express cargo service dated at least to the end of the 19th century. Now this term will also mean the support of our comrades from the ocean who are fighting the reactionary threat."

### Foreign Policy ###
 WCA_back_in_business: "The Next Step"
 WCA_back_in_business_desc: "With victory having been achieved, America is now at the forefront of the syndicalist revolution. The question is: where do we go next?"
 WCA_good_soldier: "Good Syndicalist Soldier"
 WCA_good_soldier_desc: "Our place is next to our brothers in Europe - we must help them, and through their victory help syndicalism spread to the rest of the world."
 WCA_new_lend_lease: "American Aid"
 WCA_new_lend_lease_desc: "American expertise must be put to the disposal of our allies - or, at least, the enemies of our enemies. If they fight better, then together, we stand a chance at victory."
 WCA_on_the_beach: "On the Beach"
 WCA_on_the_beach_desc: "Our enemies must fear American soldiers landing on their shores, and to that end we must work to ensure that we have the skill and power to take advantage of our longer reach."
 WCA_from_the_sky: "From the Sky"

## Constitutional Convention ###

 america_workers_congress_events.1.t: "Bringing to Birth a New World"
 america_workers_congress_events.1.d: "The mood is cautiously exuberant in the temporary capital of Chicago; for the moment, the Revolution has succeeded. Today, the old order of things in America, the violence of the Slave-Owner and the Boss, has been abolished. Still, merely destroying the old society with all of its violence and domination does not create the new - that work, the work of the whole Proletariat, has only just begun.\n\nThe Workers' Congress, at Chairman Reed's urging, has passed a motion in preparation for the drafting of a new constitution to suit the new Socialist order, although already Revolutionary Unity has begun to fray as different delegates already begin to bicker about the exact form the new American society will take.\n\nWhile of course everyone, from Reed to his erstwhile second Norman Thomas to the 'ultrasyndicalists' - a pejorative given to Browder and Foster's supporters in the TUEL - stand against the predations of Capitalism and for the continuation of the World Socialist Revolution, deep divides have already begun to show themselves in how exactly they envision this brave new world will actually work. The Party Center, representing the alliance between Reed's most ideological members of the SPA, bolstered by the theoretical support of party stalwart Louis Fraina, and Elizabeth Gurley Flynn from the IWW, envision a loose document similar to France and the lost Russian Soviet Republic, declaring a socialist order, enshrining social and economic rights for the working class, but otherwise allowing a large degree of communal autonomy.\n\nIn contrast, Thomas' Progressive Caucus have argued for a system more along the lines of the Union of Britain; instead of communal autonomy and IWW economic dominance, the revolutionary state itself should take direct command of the economy via a system of Centralized Planning and a more formalized system of socialist democracy. For their part, the TUEL advocate of something of a mix - the economic decentralization of the Industrial Unionists but with the strong Federal system of the progressives. These differences aside, the delegates, representing locally elected Councils and Union leadership as well as a few small delegations from Farmer-Labor parties and observers from comrades in the International are in high spirits: Chairman Reed began proceedings with a spirited singing of The Internationale and Solidarity Forever."

 america_workers_congress_events.2.t: "Crafting a Revolutionary State"
 america_workers_congress_events.2.d: "The Workers' Congress has begun its task of drafting a new Revolutionary Order with gusto: with some debate, a preamble was agreed upon roughly paraphrasing the Socialist Party's Platform, offering a brief-but-honest accounting of American History before declaring the sovereignty of its Working Classes: the Workers, the Farmers, and the Soldiers.\n\nThe first true controversy of the day was a question of organization: the Commonwealth, the term that has become more-or-less the standard for the new state, is currently organized on an ad-hoc basis of self-declared Communes, each made up by a relatively autonomous ring of workers' councils, factory committees, and Trade Union organizations, each ultimately answering to different sponsors within the congress; the Councils tend to be staffed with SPA members, the committees an ad-hoc mix of unaffiliated but radical workers, anarchists, and intellectuals, and the Unions split between the CIO and the IWW. The efficiency of such a system has been questioned; while it clearly won us the war, many progressive delegates worry that such an organic system could be easily paralyzed or rendered unable to function should any real internal opposition to the Revolution show itself.\n\nReed cautiously pushed back against this impulse, pointing out that the self-organization of the working-class could not be stifled by a state that could all-too-easily find itself trapped by the logic of profit and the market. Still, the Chairman could not help but admit that times the system of organic class-rule had caused issues. Eventually, two proposals jockeyed for the Congress' approval: a draft keeping the system of organic proletarian democracy, creating a Unitary Federation of Councils, or one re-establishing state-level governments, mirroring the Congress itself, that would elect local executives to co-ordinate local democratic activity, establishing a Federal Socialist Republic."

 america_workers_congress_events.5.t: "Socialist Constitution - Suffrage"
 america_workers_congress_events.5.d: "Though the consititution thus far has not seen significant controversy, a recent proposal from the TUEL has thrown the floor of the convention into frenzied debate. William Z. Foster, the old man of the ultra-syndicalists, has proposed making trade union membership a prerequisite to vote. Though this would disenfranchise all who are not union members, Foster has argued that the right to vote should be restricted to those who work.\n\nThe IWW, SPA, and mainstream of the CIO have all responded harshly to Foster's proposal. The IWW has pointed out the fact that this would leave unorganised and unemployed workers completely disenfranchsed, while the SPA has indignantly denounced the \"socialist poll tax\" that such a system would bring about. The CIO, from whom the TUEL hail, has been most muted in its criticism, however it has still thrown in with the bloc of the revolutionary establishment on the question.\n\nNevertheless, despite the deck being stacked against them, the TUEL position has gained popularity among rank-and-file unionists. After all, what else was the revolution for other than primarily for the workers to assume political power through their unions? As such, many on the fringes of the IWW and other independent unionists have expressed sympathy for the TUEL position, opening the door to a stunning upset on the question."

Freedom of conscience and freedom of religion are guaranteed to residents. The Church and the State are not obligated to adhere to each others' authority.\n\nArticle 16. Women have equal rights with men in all fields of state, economic and social-political life.

The commonwealth reserves the right to pay an equivalent wage up to 20 hours of work a week to mothers before and after childbirth.\n\nArticle 17. Residents of America are guaranteed inviolability of the person. No one may be arrested except by a court decision or on the warrant of a procurator. Residents of America are guaranteed inviolability of the home. No one may, without lawful grounds, enter a home against the will of those residing in it.\n\nArticle 18. The commonwealth promises working people the right to associate and organise themselves to federated industrial units.

 america_workers_congress_events.6.a: "Approved."

 america_workers_congress_events.7.t: "Socialist Constitution - Status of the Executive"
 america_workers_congress_events.7.d: "A surge of unaligned delegates has attempted to leave for recess several times to no avail. It appears that the issue of Executive power has met an impasse, and a decision must be made before the delegates starve in indecision. On one side is the IWW, whose plan for a complete anarcho-syndicalist government requires there not to be an executive officer. Their belief is that a president is an inherently reactionary populist position, and they will ensure that a person like Huey Long can never rise to power in the new America. Thomas suggests a cabinet of equals elected by Congress, which will, in the same manner as France and Britain, elect a \"first among equals\" from their own ranks as its president, who will serve as a de-facto head of state. The industrial unionists and SPA-Progressives have both supported this for different reasons: the industrial unionists of teh SPA and IWW see it as a stepping stone to the abolition of the distinction between executive and legislative power, while the progressives wish to see the executive subordinated to the legislature.\n\nIn opposition to this, the CIO, influenced by the TUEL, has affirmed their support for a powerful and independently-elected Presidency similar to that of the old United States, arguing that Reed’s leadership during the revolution proves the merits of a powerful President. Norman Thomas has condemned the TUEL for what he sees as a 'boulangist coup' to revive the old federal government. Sidney Hillman of the CIO rises to object, saying 'subordination to the IWW programme is no different than a single party state'."

 america_workers_congress_events.7.b: "A President with Power We Shall Have"

 america_workers_congress_events.8.t: "Socialist Constitution - Centralisation or Decentralisation"
 america_workers_congress_events.8.d: "The Convention, after resuming, has found themselves more divided than ever. Though there is agreement that the new America should have a federal structure, the distribution of power within that structure is a matter of dispute. The leadership of the SPA and CIO have each strongly advocated for a more centralised and strong central government with extensive powers granted to municipal administrations and workers' organisations, pointing to the constant abuses wrought by conservative state governments prior to the revolution, particularly in the south. SPA moderates such as Norman Thomas, as well as CIO dissidents in the TUEL have disagreed with this however. Thomas advocates for a strong federal system, where state governments shall retain strong authority, rebuking the centralist attitude of his colleagues. He is supported by Browder, who again takes to the stage calling to protect federalism, as it prevents a 'tyranny of the 51% over the 49%'. The IWW, marginalised in this debate due to their radical position, now plays the role of kingmaker, having to decide which level of government to empower."
 america_workers_congress_events.8.a: "A strong central government shall stop abuses."
 america_workers_congress_events.8.b: "Federalism shall protect workers in small states."

 america_workers_congress_events.9.t: "Socialist Constitution - Capital"
 america_workers_congress_events.9.d: "One of the last things to be decided is the capital of America. While Many are advocating for Washington DC as the location of the new capital as it was the old capital, and it easily fits that purpose. Others are advocating for the loyal cities of Chicago, Philadelphia, and New York City. Which shall the convention choose?"

 america_workers_congress_events.10.t: "The End Of the Convention Period"
 america_workers_congress_events.10.d.commonwealth: "With most of the substantial work on the constitution itself completed, the past week has seen the domestic political situation realign around the new system. Several political parties and unions have reorganised or held conventions parallel to the main constitutional convention, and their outcomes are set to impact the new American political sphere for years to come.\n\nThe Socialist Party has held its first post-war convention in the immediate aftermath of the constitutional convention. The party voted to ask for formal affiliation from the IWW, cementing the alliance which has formed between the party and the union over the past decade. This measure, as well as the adoption of a new, radical program, proved too much for the moderate Progressive Caucus in the party. Denouncing the Industrial Unionists for having \"sold the party to the anarchists of the IWW\", the supporters of Norman Thomas walked out to form the rival American Commonwealth Party, inspired by the radical faction of the Canadian Cooperative Commonwealth Federation and intended to be the representative of moderate socialism in the years to come.\n\nMeanwhile, a battle was occuring in the halls of the CIO. the TUEL, under the leadership of William Foster and Earl Browder, attempted to push forward Foster's candidacy for the presidency of the union. Though the TUEL built momentum during the civil war, it was ultimately not enough to oust incumbent Sidney Hillman, who won re-election by a larger than expected margin. In the aftermath, the TUEL floundered; Foster announced he would retire from public life due to ill health, while Browder led what remained out of the CIO to found the rival Trade Union Unity League (TUUL), a dual union with many of the same views as the old TUEL.\n\nAs the dust settled, what remained was a de-facto two-party system. Once the IWW accepted affiliation with the SPA, and the CIO came to a similar arrangement with Commonwealth, the main unions in the country aligned with the new system. Only the TUUL remains isolated, though few consider the rump a threat to the newly established order."

After building substantial momentum during the civil war, they saw their moment to strike, and took it. In a shocking victory, Foster was elected, and the TUEL slate won elections for almost all elected offices. The TUEL victory represents the culmination of years of work, and in the crucial weeks that follow American Totalism seems likely to have the initiative.\n\nIn light of this, The Socialists and Commonwealth have, in spite of their differences, mutually agreed to attempt to block the ascent of the newly radicalised CIO. However, with the totalists on the offensive, and with many sympathisers in the parties, it remains to be seen whether they can be stopped."

 america_workers_congress_events.11.d.commonwealth: "On the first day of the newly elected interim Congress, John Reed has announced that he will step down as President of the Commonwealth Executive Council. Rumours of his deteriorating health have been kept away from the press, as part of a gentleman's agreement of sorts, however with the war over it has become difficult to hide. Reed proclaims he will spend his remaining time in retirement, and has emphasised that his role was to see the country through the revolution, but not necessarily into the peace that followed.\n\nIn a show of unity, both the Socialist and Commonwealth parties have agreed to form a joint executive, led by a president who will take into account the views of the opposing side. Though the main composition of this council has been decided, the choice of who will be the next president remains. The Socialist Party, in alliance with the IWW, has nominated IWW President Elizabeth Gurley Flynn for the role. A nomination made possible by the recent IWW-SPA affiliation agreement, Flynn promises a swift end to wartime repression and a steadfastly industrial unionist system. The Commonwealth Party meanwhile has put forward its leader, Norman Thomas. Thomas also promises a return to peace, and a stable and just post-war settlement. Though there will likely be elections long before the Congress' term formally expires, the choice of president is likely to indicate the country's direction for several years to come."

Buoyed by defectors from both parties (though mainly Commonwealth), the CIO soon assembled a majority on the floor, and elected an executive comprised of itself and its supporters. What remains is the question of the presidency. For a few years after his heart attack in 1932, William Foster was put out of commission, and sidelined by his protege, Earl Browder. With his election to the presidency of the CIO however, Foster has returned to the forefront of totalist politics. Having already eclipsed the master however, Browder will not give up his pride of place without a fight, and the two now jockey behind the scenes for support among their comrades.

From the surrealists in New York shocking viewers with graphic sex on screen, to the Dadaists who challenge the very concept of popular art. As part of this movement, many of the countries thousands of movie theatres have been expropriated to ensure that work of this calibre is not censored by prudish theatre owners. They are brightly painted and carrying on board a printing press, government complaint office, printed political leaflets and pamphlets, library books, and a mobile movie theatre.

However, a number of revolutionary architects within the SPA wish to break away from that style and seek a more Modernist approach inspired by the designs coming out of France, Italy, or Britain. Moderates have come out in force to counter that Art Deco is an American style that cannot be erased by political whims. They point to Diego Rivera's recent demolition of the Rockefeller Center artwork, after his modification of chiselling the faces of Marx and Lenin over Zeus and Thor were decried as being in poor taste.

Starting with the debate over whether union membership fees were inherently discriminatory towards black workers. Evidence on both sides appears inconclusive, and most of the unions that were rejected from the Constitutional Convention have protested in favour a maximum union membership fee. These protestors claim to be discriminated against based on their race by the openly anti-racist IWW. Then came the union Congressmen from the newly liberated states, who are protesting that forcing integration is a violation of their union rights to collectively bargain. Ultimately the IWW have persevered in Congress, and publicly shamed the new Congressmen and protestors as reactionaries."

A national poll has shown the number of women-only unions have quadrupled in the past year. When interviewed, these Women-Only Unions claim persistent systematic discrimination in the fields of science and civil service. In the aftermath of this release, the planned Women's Caucus was canceled, as the nation begins to debate the ethical application of women's liberation.

Reed's wartime rationing has given way to a peace-time legislation to prevent the robber baronies he had fought all his life. This is enacted in the form of his final wishes to Congress, the expropriation of all assets owned by a single person in excess of $$10 million USD.

 america_workers_congress_events.19.d: "From the mansions of the Rockefeller, the Morgans, the Carnegies, and the Vanderbilts, to the sharecroppers who run company stores. The land of the United States still belongs to the capitalist. The worst example being Murphy Ranch out in California, which was a hive of Silver Shirt activity during the war, and took months to starve out by our forces. It has been decided by Congress to exercise expropriation on these estates. Many of the southern and western estates have been given over to the local communes and established as public housing for the people. As expected, civilian armed resistance has cost us some lives, but few would have expected our own Red Guard to be ineffective at expropriation. One particular tough nut to crack was in Montana, where the initial militia sent in turned traitor, and held onto a large estate for its warlord owner for eight months before our Red Guard were forced to intervene. The programme seems to be working however, so there is no reason to reconsider."

In particular, he emphasises that schooling must include hands-on learning famously stating 'if knowledge comes from the impressions made upon us by natural objects, it is impossible to procure knowledge without the use of objects which impress the mind'.

The president has proposed the immediate complete dissolution and expropriation to the state of assets belonging to traitors in this grand conspiracy. Congress is taken aback, with most initially supporting this measure. The list of traitors, however, causes concern among certain members of the government.

The director, King Vidor, has been advised by colleagues to make himself scarce, as the reaction is not what he intended. Congress has demanded Vidor to release the names of those filmed, so their crimes could be properly prosecuted. A minority of Congressmen came to defend the film, claiming that this shows the systematic difficulty in enforcing such revolutionary acts throughout the nation.

 america_workers_congress_events.24.d: "With the social revolution in full swing, Congress has passed the Family Code of [GetYear]. The Family Code is a revolutionary code that is driven by an ideological desire to wither away the capitalist model of the family to be replaced by a socialist model of the familial free unions based on mutual love and respect.\n\nThus, to that end, the code included a number of revolutionary changes. It abolishes all impediments to marriage, the biggest one being the abolition of anti-miscegenation laws. Civil marriage is now the only legal type of marriage. The code establishes no-grounds divorce, with both spouses receiving equal division of the property at the time of divorce. Also abolished is the concept of illegitimacy. Now all children are entitled to parental support and equal rights under the law.\n\nFurthermore, in accordance with the revolutionary laws regarding the family, adoption of children that were made homeless by the revolution is subsidised. The European concept of Free Love is still under consideration, as well as decriminalising homosexual behaviour. A Committee of Sexology, led by Magnus Hirschfeld, Wilhelm Reich, and Alain Leroy Locke are still locked in debate over how to approach this."

Although the institution is still young and Syndicalist dominance at the constitutional convention has done much to leave the executive fairly weak, the election still carries much significance - it is a chance to measure the current prevailing attitudes towards the state of the revolution, and the President of the executive is still seen as the face of America abroad. Furthermore, garnering enough support to get their candidate installed in the presidency is strong proof of a faction's leading role in politics - and the split of the SPA has left two opposing parties very interested in doing as such.\n\nAt an appointed time, in [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], a stage was set in front of the assembled SPA and ACP delegates. As the joint candidate of the IWW and the Socialist Party, in Portland, Oregon, Elizabeth Gurley Flynn gave a speech appealing for nomination as President of the Executive Council. Flynn drew on her foundational role in the alliance between the IWW and the SPA, calling upon this alliance to elect her. Flynn promised members both in the IWW and SPA that she would further syndicalise the economy and political system, upholding the central role of the industrial unions in public life. The next speech was from California ACP delegate Upton Sinclair, founder of the 'End Poverty in America movement'. Sinclair promised to use his political experience in convincing non-socialists to recognise the legitimacy of the Commonwealth.\n\nSinclair and Flynn spent the next few days in a sporadic debate across union papers, Flynn accusing Upton Sinclair of being an insincere self promoter, using politics to enhance his reputation as an artist prior to the revolution. Sinclair retorted that Flynn and the IWW's collectivisation policy is unpopular with the great body of rural Americans, denouncing both her, and, rather bravely, John Reed, with whom Sinclair has been at odds for over 20 years. Flynn attempted to counter this assertion by arguing that Sinclair's status among this demographic is hardly any better, and that radical action is necessary to eliminate the material basis for opposition to the socialist system - but Sinclair remained adamant that French mindsets cannot be applied to America so soon, and that this line proves that the SPA is too radical and idealistic to remain at the helm.\n\nAt the end of this, the people voted, their newly elected delegates reconvened in [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], and Congress chose a new executive.

Gitlow promised to defend the legitimacy of the Commonwealth both internally and abroad, and has put forward his successful record in suppressing counterrevolutionary activity during the war, as well as his closeness to the hero of the revolution, John Reed. The next speech was from New York Commonwealth Party delegate Norman Thomas, former Presbyterian preacher turned socialist advocate.

Gitlow accused Thomas of being weak on foreign policy, citing his long record of antiwar activism prior to the civil war and challenging his dedication to the cause of internationalism. Thomas defended himself, saying that antiwar politics were the right path for America to stay out of imperialist wars. He returned that Gitlow was beholden to allies in the IWW, and would undertake radical policies that would alienate key sections of the public, to which Gitlow replied that he and the SPA were very active in moderating the policies of the IWW in their coalition agreement, and that he would pledge not to undertake any collectivisation measures if elected.\n\nAt the end of this, the people voted, their newly elected delegates reconvened in [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], and Congress chose a new executive.

President Flynn's term has seen her work to enact her main promises to the previous assembly - the recovery of industry following the destruction of the war, the rolling back of most wartime measures restraining free speech and free expression, the expansion of women's rights, and the cementing of the industrial unionist system. However, she is not without controversy: the speech issue in particular continues to haunt her, as while the IWW has been in favour of her agenda, certain elements within the SPA have been more sceptical. Secretary of Internal Affairs Benjamin Gitlow in particular has criticised Flynn's quickness in rolling back the state of emergency, and in his position he has effectively blocked many aspects of Flynn's policy.\n\nThe President's new challenger has appeared in the Commonwealth Party leader Maynard C.

Krueger's leadership marks a shift to the left compared to previous years, as the revolutionary \"Militants\" tone down their pacifism.\n\nKrueger has stepped up to the ACP stage to attack Elizabeth Gurley Flynn on several grounds - most importantly, that her administration has been too slow in rolling back the wartime censorship regime. This placed Flynn in a hard spot, as she could either split the IWW-SPA coalition by pushing the issue harder, or she could concede the issue to Krueger. Flynn retorted by claiming that, in fact, important progress on political freedoms had been made, with Farmer-Labor and many progressive independents being represented in Congress. Krueger claimed that, despite this, the security apparatus built during the revolution remains, and warned that it may yet be turned on some party or other.\n\nAt the end of this, the people voted, their newly elected delegates reconvened in [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], and Congress chose a new executive.

President Hass's term thus far has seen a more reinvigorated revolutionary spirit - the government has eagerly sought to enact new reforms along De Leonist lines, although the opposition has regularly criticised this direction as weakening the government.\n\nIn a challenge to this revolutionary spirit, the Commonwealth Party have opted for a more bread and butter message: their candidate is Daniel Hoan, the former Mayor of Milwaukee who has run the Commonwealth campaign on a message of good government, anti-corruption rhetoric, and opposition to the entrenchment of the SPA and IWW in public life, as well as to 'spurious' revolutionary projects. Hoan's moderation has a strong appeal among reconstructed reactionaries who wish for a return to 'sensible' government, however it has made him an easy target for attack from the SPA, who have run a scare campaign targeted at the unions claiming he will restore parliamentary representation, destroying union power. However, in nominating him, the Commonwealth Party hopes to prove their good government credentials, and establish that the Socialist Party doesn't have a monopoly on power.\n\nTheir position is that socialism can only be advanced by a strong government.

While the public at large was fooled by this display, the President is not so easily deceived. President [WCA.GetLeader] has spent the last several weeks building up a case to present to Congress purporting the inherent betrayal of Progressives to the socialist ideal. A gaunt and limping Henry Wallace appeared in a political rally today to denounce the Progressives as 'social chauvinists disguised to deceive the working class.'

With the ascension of William Foster comes a dedication to the dream of creating a more perfect union, as opposed to a greater union. Foster has drafted a plan with James W. Ford to ensure the perpetual safety and self determination of African-American minorities in the South. This plan is to create a Black Belt in the south of autonomous communities with their own representatives separate from Congress. While the ruling party as a whole supports this, several critics from other parties note that this policy would create an unequal standard for civil rights."

On the other hand several dissident black politicians in the North have faced issues with promoting a colourblind society. They debate whether to continue seeking civil rights that would remove all racial differences in laws, or to expand the Black Belt northwards."

 america_workers_congress_events.71.t: "The Great Sedition Trial of [GetYear]"
 america_workers_congress_events.71.d: "Demand for food to feed the armies and citizens of a starving, war-torn Europe led many commercially-minded Southern landowners to grow corn and wheat during the years of the Weltkrieg. For nearly a decade, sales to Europe during and after the war made landowners, bankers, and commercial insurers rich, but this prosperity would not last. In 1925, the British Revolution wracked the United Kingdom, precipitating a debt crisis as scores of Britons lost their lives' savings and as even the British government went into a de-facto default, plunging the United States into the Great Depression. To make matters worse for the South, the recovery of the German agricultural sector following demobilisation caused demand for food crops to plummet even further.\n\nThe tenant farmers who had worked the land for the landowners that had profited during the high times responded by unionising during the lows. With some encouragement from Norman Thomas, sharecropper and gas-station worker Harry Leland Mitchell and his friend Clay East formed the Southern Tenants Farmers' Union in 1934, eventually coming to affiliate with the CIO. However, during the turbulent years leading up to the Revolution, many members of the STFU were taken in by Huey Long's populist rhetoric, and openly supported the Kingfish. Since the end of the Second American Civil War, the STFU has only continued to attract Longists and other seditious elements seeking to use it as a cover to legitimise their presence in the new America.\n\nToday, however, the STFU met its fate before the unions as a bailiff presented Mitchell and East to a union court on charges of sedition, high treason, and harbouring reactionaries and crypto-Longists such as Francis Townsend, one of the chief architects of Long's \"Share Our Wealth\" programme and who was found by the CIA in Tyronza, Arkansas after East confessed to CIA agents that he had harboured Townsend and his wife at his home.\n\nPresident Browder, for his part, is said to be privately ecstatic at finally having the chance to destroy such a dangerous pocket of resistance as he turns the increasingly mighty state apparatus of [ROOT.GetNameDef] to the task of dismantling the Southern Tenant Farmers' Union and turning their lands directly to the purposes of the state."

You were either with the union or a scab, that mantra worked for John Reed, but not for Earl Browder. It has come to his attention a despicable group of infiltrators into the new America in the form of the International Peace Movement. This dangerous group, led by a little man who thinks he's god, has resisted conscription and collectivisation. Their communes in New York and Philadelphia may be racially integrated, but their adherence to gender segregation in the name of a religious code is utterly reactionary. We have seized IPM members for de-programming, and their communes are now safely in the hands of CIO members."

 america_workers_congress_events.73.d: "The CIO has finally succeeded in reforming the American Federation of Labor, by dissolving it. Foster and the Cabinet were sure that labour leaders within the AFL such as William Green were dismantling the dignity of labour by reviving craft unionist tactics. These tactics include the division of workers based on craft within the same industry, pitting them against one another. The tipping point was when a mail bomb was discovered near President Foster's home, which was traced back to the AFL. All other legal means to stop the AFL leaders from despoiling their craft did not work, so the state is forced to intervene directly. Green, among many other AFL traitors was arrested and will stand trial for their crimes against Labour."

Citing numerous examples of sub-textual betrayals within the newspaper, including ghost-written opinion pieces mouthing reactionary ideas. Browder has come to Congress with a list of candidates to ensure the intellectual sanctity of the Revolutionary Age. This list includes University professors and metropolitan sophisticates, all pioneers in the social ramifications of Planned Economy.

It was there that Edsel Ford was shot by an anarchist for his betrayal of the working class, a rash action by agitated workers. It comes as no surprise that it was here where workers struck out against the United Auto Workers in a Wildcat Strike. The UAW rightly asked the government for assistance, and boy did they deliver. After the workers were rendered inert, [WCA.GetLeader] broadcast a new policy to America banning Wildcat Strikes. No longer will mobs rule over the appointed American government."

### General Flavour Event

 america_workers_congress_events.76.t: "Premiere of God Save King Billy"
 america_workers_congress_events.76.d: "Today Charlie Chaplin has premiered another movie, titled God Save King Billy, which has quickly received glowing reviews within the press. God Save King Billy is a political satirical comedy-drama and Chaplin's first true sound film. The film follows two principal characters, an unnamed German barber struggling to make ends meet in Germany who bears a great deal of similarity with the Tramp that Chaplin played in his other movies. The other major character is King Billy, who is a cruel but ineffective buffoon of a leader; an obvious satire of Kaiser Wilhelm the 2nd. Throughout the film it shows the plight of the average German worker while viciously mocking the German government and the Kaiser in particular. The film ends with the barber being mistaken for King Billy and giving a rousing speech where he extols the virtues of Good will and Human Brotherhood and gives a strong endorsement for Chaplin's socialist views."
 america_workers_congress_events.76.a: "Chaplin has outdone himself."

 america_workers_congress_events.77.t: "The Catholic Workers Movement"
 america_workers_congress_events.77.d: "While a good number of religious Americans have protested the effects of the revolution, that is not true for all groups. Of these groups the one that has attracted the most attention and popularity recently is the Catholic Workers Movement. Led by Comrade Dorothy Day, the movement has attracted popularity for combining Catholicism with socialist values. They focus on the concept of Works of Mercy. They have also built a number of Hospitality Houses in many major cities. The Hospitality Houses are acting as support shelters for those trying to return to civilian life, now that the revolution has come to fruition."

 america_workers_congress_events.78.t: "Grapes of Wrath Premiere"
 america_workers_congress_events.78.d: "Today, the film Grapes of Wrath premiered in theatres. The film is based on the book of the same name by acclaimed patriotic author John Steinbeck. The story follows the Joads, a family from Oklahoma and their troubles during the Depression prior to the revolution. The story illustrates the weight that federally enforced capitalism puts onto their average lives and drags their traditional values through the mud of reality. The movie does deviate from the book with the ending on a much more optimistic tone, showing the family working for the revolution to overthrow their California work camp. The main protagonist Tom Joad chooses to stay with his family instead of fleeing into the night, declaring his intention to set up a Red Guard in California to reclaim his farm in Oklahoma. The film has been well regarded by both critics and the public, particularly because of the necessary edit."

 america_workers_congress_events.79.t: "The People's Conservation Committee"
 america_workers_congress_events.79.d: "Since the 1916 National Park Service Act, Americans have been able to preserve natural splendour safe from industrialisation. Since the revolution has now been achieved, a movement has cropped up to combine this conservationism with old Progressive ideals. A number of new National Parks have been created on top of the houses of capitalism, as well as a People's Conservation Committee to guide their preservation. A top priority of the PCC is to replant trees in the Midwest, the source of the dust storms that threaten our food supply. Though it took a lot of convincing to get Congress to fund this project, the PCC hopes that in a few years the dust storms that used to reach Washington D.C will only be a memory."

 america_workers_congress_events.80.d: "With the revolution now over, countless memorials have gone up throughout the country to honour the sacrifice of the men and women that made the revolution possible. While many honour those that fought for the revolution itself, there are also ones honouring the struggles like the Haymarket Square Riot. As these memorials are made by the community, nobody was there to check whether the statue was appropriate until the press got a hold of the story. Apparently, statues were erected honouring the 1916 Preparedness Day Bombing, and the 1920 Wall Street Bombing. The press claim erroneously that the government approved of these memorials, and are honouring the bombers. These statues were silently taken down, and an official apology was forced out of the city councils responsible for this mean-spirited action."

Parents are lining up in droves at health clinics across the country to get the vaccine for their children and themselves."
 america_workers_congress_events.81.a: "Thank you, Dr. Salk."

 america_workers_congress_events.82.t: "Fate of the Boy Scouts"
 america_workers_congress_events.82.d: "A question has come up in regards to the Boy Scouts of America. Some within Congress regard it as a reactionary organisation, notable for including a pledge that scouts are loyal to their employers in the days before the revolution among other issues. To that end, a number within Congress believe that a new Pioneer organisation should be created, similar to the ones in socialist countries in Europe, called the Pioneers of America. Unlike the Boy Scouts, this organisation will be for both boys and girls. These Pioneers are supported by the government to help make sure that the new socialist ideas are passed down to the next generation."

 america_workers_congress_events.83.d: "The American Artist Congress is an organisation that has been created to unite artistic people around the country and help promote the arts within America. From traditional artwork to film-making, all are supported within the artists' congress. It quickly has become a popular organisation to show the new Avant-Garde art of the revolution. Their Chairman, Ernest Hemingway, has already begun planning for a series of patriotic publications about life during the revolution. Ernest Hemmingway's appointment to Chairman has caused some backlash from artists like John Dos Passos and John Steinbeck, who claim Ernest's politics have turned authoritarian in recent years due to his work in producing propaganda for the 1936 US election."

 america_workers_congress_events.84.d: "Throughout the country a number of literature clubs called John Reed Clubs have emerged. The clubs, established in various cities, universities, and communities, are creating spaces for young individuals to engage in discussions centred around Marxist principles, socialism, and John Reed Thought. Advocates argue that by fostering a love for literature and critical thinking, the clubs empower participants to analyse societal structures, question norms, and contribute to informed political dialogue. Critics, however, express concerns about the potential for ideological indoctrination and argue that a singular focus on Marxist literature may limit intellectual diversity. Despite the debate surrounding their approach, the John Reed Clubs have undeniably struck a chord with a segment of the younger population."

 america_workers_congress_events.85.d: "After a long hiatus from acting, socialist activist Paul Robeson is ready for a world tour. With a powerful voice and a collection of traditional African-American labour music, Robeson has become the Marian Anderson of socialists in America. Just like Anderson before him, he has chosen to embark on a world tour to spread his music and support for black American rights to European theatres. The tour includes stops in London, Paris and even Florence. These European audiences, though in touch with American culture, still see black American culture as exotic."

 america_workers_congress_events.86.t: "Promoting Sewer Socialism"
 america_workers_congress_events.86.d: "In the old days of the Socialist Party, successes were measured by how clean your sewer system was. Especially in Wisconsin, where Morris Hillquit made it his campaign promise to clean up the city. In reforming and organising public maintenance services, Hillquit showed that socialism could reorganise society without having to redefine or destroy its foundations. The principles of Sewer Socialism must be taken to the whole of the nation now that the chains of oppression have been broken. Many cities such as Pittsburgh are filled with pollution that covers the skies. Now that the revolution is over, cities all across the country shall be cleaned up and modernised. Americans, and the international community, should appreciate a clean sewer as much as they do a skyscraper."

 america_workers_congress_events.88.d: "On the face of Stone Mountain, deep in the state of Georgia, lies a long stalled government supported project to carve bas-reliefs to honour the Confederate side of the last civil war. The site has been a hotbed of neo-Confederate activity, a history that has included hosting the site of the rebirth of the Ku Klux Klan. Many wish to remove such a blight from the land of the new America, especially as other monuments to the Confederacy are torn down. However, people are divided with regards to the specifics of the incomplete project, which had run out of funding and seen highly public infighting by its patrons in the 1920s. Some believe the limited work done should be destroyed and the mountain allowed to heal the best it can, especially since the face of Robert E. Lee was already blasted off in 1928. James Ford, in a cynical turn, wishes to continue the project but feature Jemmy, John Brown and George Padmore, feeling that these heroes of African-American emancipation are best-suited to inspire the new America. Diego Rivera, the artist behind the renovation of Rockefeller Plaza, suggests a cheap and honourable compromise. The relief will be chiselled down to replace the Confederates with leaders of Socialist thinking and revolution. Those being Karl Marx, Vladimir Lenin, and John Reed. A redesign wouldn't be completely out of order given the numerous development issues the monument has faced and indeed the project had already been scaled back and replanned even before the revolution. But our government's final decision will likely send a lasting message about what our new America stands for."

 america_workers_congress_events.89.d: "With the onset of a new society, a new set of ethics must take the place of the old ones. What is truly ethical behaviour? Waging revolution by all means. Before the revolution and during the war, life was hard for our fellow Americans. Many had to suffer the loss of a loved one, life-threatening financial insecurity during the crisis years or persecution. This lead to behaviour the old society may have deemed wrong or sinful, but our brave President Foster must look beyond traditions. For those whose souls suffered too deep an injury to carry on, we must allow them to phase out. Despite our censorship of the Daily Worker, massive protests by Christian Workers Unions, intelligentsia, and community support networks claim that Foster's 'suicide law' is merely a pretence to excuse mysterious deaths and disappearances. The more conspiratorial rightists even claim this is a plot by Foster to legalise murder so long as it looks like suicide. Foster's cabinet has called him in to reconsider, but the ultimate result was..."

 america_workers_congress_events.90.t: "The USA Trilogy by John Dos Passos"
 america_workers_congress_events.90.d: "Film montage, modernist writing, and the socialist spirit comes together in John Dos Passos's new book U.S.A. The story itself is an examination of twelve Americans that lived through the depression and revolution. Passos's writing combines snippets of newspapers, propaganda, and the conversations he recalls on the streets during the terrifying months before liberation. Such an unorthodox and creative writing is usually praised by the Americans Writers Congress, but they have remained silent. This is due to the book's depiction of illegal killings that took place throughout America during the Civil War by our soldiers. Dos Passos has defended this inclusion, saying that the truth in art, as he shows it, must still exist even if it is bleak. To the nominal leader of the Writers Congress, Ernest Hemingway, this book amounted to treason and sedition against the socialist government. However, his decision to censor the book and detain Dos Passos was overruled by the Congress."

 america_workers_congress_events.91.t: "Union Vacations"
 america_workers_congress_events.91.d: "One of the changes that has come with the Revolution is the transformation of vacationing. The workers of America rarely got to enjoy the luxuries that they created, stolen as they were by capitalists even though they rightly belonged to the people. How many of the struggling masses got to enjoy picnics or visits to the national parks when they had to work so many hours just to survive and feed their children? No longer will this be the case. The various local unions across the country, regardless of which federation they belong to, have begun to take over and manage various cultural centres as well as help sponsor vacations. This is supported by the government at both a local level and national level as a way to boost productivity and encourage comradeship."

As part of the programme to ensure that the American worker is relieved of responsibilities which President Foster has termed \"A millstone about the neck of the workers\" Today the first train from Chicago to the rural plains in the centre of our country has left with children from mothers and fathers who work in important positions in the industrial heartland. The kids will be safe on the countless fields and ranches in the pastures, making themselves useful in farm labour and running errands, living a healthy life. This frees their parents to wage revolution with all their hearts and energy. With the success of this first train, Foster has proposed to his cabinet to make this a mandatory arrangement throughout the USSA, even going so far as to propose that children be taken by force from more stubborn worker families for their own good."

 america_workers_congress_events.95.d: "From the very beginnings of the American socialist movement, there has scant been much consideration granted to the rights and demands of the indigenous peoples across the country. On the contrary, early writings from Engels derisively referred to Native societies and economies as primitive. Despite this, the Russian and French Revolutions that reverberated all the way into the New World have brought with them a radical reconsideration of the national question.\n\nArchie Phinney, a Nez Perce Indian travelled abroad to France in 1931 coming into contact with the émigré anti-colonial African communists residing there, as well as Lenin's work \"Theses on the National Question\". Returning to the US in 1935, Phinney lay forward a series of critiques at the broader \"polite American society\" for its anti-socialism, racism, and much of the Socialist Party for their white chauvinism. Of course, Phinney himself is far from a traditionalist, with his ultimate vision for indigenous emancipation occurring through a Socialist Revolution and Radical Cosmopolitanism. Ultimately wishing for a society where being \"Native\" is no longer limited to the narrowness of the reservations.\n\nNow, in [GetYear], Phinney has recently conducted a meeting with Vincent Spotted Eagle, a self-proclaimed American Indian, communist and member of the SPA, alongside the not-quite-so socialist Raymond Francis Gray, D'Arcy McNickle and Zitkala-Sa. Founding the Indian Anti-Capitalist Committee together as a support group for the SPA in the current struggle, their efforts have received notable attention and applaud from the Montana Socialist Party, largely in part due to the fact that they were the first of the regional SPA sections to run a Native American as a candidate for the senate, only a few years ago in 1934."

Thus, the various film and artistic unions have been searching for an alternative and they have presented to Congress a number of alternative locations for filming. The ambitious proposal more closely resembles the german Babelsberg than Hollywood. The proposed entertainment complex, is set to be a sprawling hub for film production, television, streaming services, and various other facets of the entertainment industry.

The newly-inaugurated President Reed gave a passionate speech for Revolutionary Unity in the upcoming conflict, harkening back to his experiences during the Russian, French, and British Revolutions. The congress proceeded to pass a resolution calling for the creation of a unified military council with representatives from all factions - including a single representative from Farmer-Labor, Henry Wallace, chaired by President Reed and entrusted with serving as an ad-hoc cabinet for the duration of the coming war."

 america_workers_congress_events.151.d: "To a full session of the Workers' Congress and broadcasted on all available radiowaves, in what had formerly been the International Amphitheatre in Chicago, John Reed delivered a fiery speech describing the history and wealth of America; since the time of the Pilgrims, exploitation had ruled the continent -- nothing less than the naked domination of man over man, the sacrifice of humanity on the altar of surplus-profit. Slavery and Wage-Slavery were not abberations, argued Reed, but the core of the United States - but the same Working Class that had built the bourgeois their great Beast now had the tools to tear it down.\n\nLike a great volcano, the great class struggle that had stewed for so long was now erupting into the open; declaring that direct action against capitalist society was now a vital necessity for all American Workers, regardless of race, religion, or nationality. Telegrams from the Third International poured in in support of the Socialist Party, the IWW, and the CIO, each meeting resounding cheers from the delegates. After a nearly unanimous vote, a symbolic shot across the bow was fired in a declaration of Revolutionary Unity with the Workers of the World, and the immediate nationalization and collectivization of all privately held property without compensation. The proceedings came to an end with a final speech from Reed, one ending with the refrain that had now become familiar across the nation:"

 america_workers_congress_events.152.d: "As the General Strike continues and the Proletarian Revolution begins in earnest, the IWW and CIO, with coordination thanks to the SPA, have begun to coordinate the ground-level seizure of state power. Across WCA controlled territory Red Guards have occupied Railroads, Telegraph Lines, Post Offices, Hospitals, and other vital infrastructure - meanwhile, all elected government besides local Workers' Councils and Union Congresses have been dissolved — for the first time in history, the American Workers are running their own lives. These congresses, having sent their delegates to the Workers' Congress in Chicago, will serve as the future basis for all political, economic, and perhaps even social life.\n\nIn this temporary state until a real economic plan can be agreed upon, production itself is operating in a state of flux: local communes have begun a crude system of resource allocation with the IWW and CIO providing infrastrucutral support, keeping prices relatively steady as our ad-hoc confiscations allow the sputtering engines of the old economic system to run until we so deem it proper. Like in 1917, 1919, and 1925, a feeling of change is in the air: a feeling that the 20th century has arrived at last.\n\n\"A republic, if you can keep it.\"\nSo said the Bourgeois Revolutionary Franklin so long ago.

From their constitutional convention, a new system has arisen, one centred around the principles of syndicalism and workers' democracy - biased as it may be, it's still democratic at is core, something which surprised many people expecting the revolution to inevitably collapse into tyranny. With the recent election of the Farmer-Labor Party, a furious debate has broken out regarding the possibility of a peaceful reunification. While our government is favourable to many of [WCA.GetNameDef]'s policies, they are also far more radical, and will be negotiating from a position of strength - meaning we will be forced to accept many hard compromises. On the other hand, [WCA.GetNameDef] has proven its resilience, with both the Federal Government and Huey Long's [APG.GetName] crushed under their armies. Perhaps we should accept the inevitable and avoid more bloodshed, before the victors turn their eyes towards California."

However it seems that the rebels out west have decided that they shall not reunite with us. In their senate, they have bitterly denounced the Revolutionary Congress as a hollow mockery of democracy, no better than the tyrants in Washington and Baton Rouge it had replaced.

 america_workers_congress_events.205.d: "After the start of the Civil War, some high ranking captains and commanders of the U.S. navy have chosen the side of people. Some of them even brought with them ships under their command into our revolutionary endeavour. In our time of need, we need to appoint a Chief to our Navy which will lead us to victory against Federal forces. One of the best choices is experienced William Rea Furlong, a supporter of old U.S. naval doctrine, but we are still not in position to fight in open battle against the Federalist navy. Opposite of him, Hyman Rickover suggests to concentrate our attention against convoys in deep oceans.

The shipyards that remain in our hands do not allow us to recreate the old US fleet, and we cannot fight against the enemy fleet in our present situation. But there is good for us - most of our shipyard workers have experience, and some of them have already proposed plans to simplify ship production and organisation of work. This will take resources and experienced workers from other places, but allow us to prepare for a naval war against the Federal Government. Our captains are divided into two groups - supporters of destroyers or submarines. The first group are insisting destroyers can fight against most enemy ships, and can also support our main ships in battle. The second group says that submarines are more efficient and can work alone at large distances without the support of the main forces of the fleet. Meanwhile, our leading engineers have proposed an option between them. Although this option is not as effective as specialising in one of the production lines, it will allow us to create a flexible fleet."

A leading engineer at one of the shipyards was recently caught receiving a bribe from one of the union members, in a private arrangement to prioritise their own work before others. To make matters worse, various shipyards spent money intended for building ships to \"improve working conditions\". Despite those claims, that money ended up lining the pockets of the navy officers who supervised the construction and assigned foremen, not the workers.\n\nThe growing corruption in shipyards has become a problem.

After finishing a rigorous conditioning and training programme started two weeks ago, a lottery was made to decide the jumping order of the experimental paradropping platoon made up of volunteers. When the Douglas C-33 took off from Alpena Airfield and finally was put into position to start the experiment, Lieutenant William T. Ryder became the first American Paratrooper after making his jump and landing near Fort Custer. The second man, however, refused to jump, and so the first enlisted man to become a paratrooper was William N. \"Red\" King, and then the remaining 8 platoon members in the aircraft. After their touchdown, they quickly reached the rendezvous point and completed their exercise goals, making the experiment a success."

While originally the high training standards and relatively high mortal risk initially caused few volunteers to show up, the high command authorised a triplication of the paratrooper wage as opposed to the foot soldier wage. Soon enough, the 501st Parachute Battalion was formed, quickly followed by other battalions and regiments. After a recruitment drive, the number of volunteers was enough to form 3 paratrooper divisions for us to utilise. While these divisions still lack combat experience, this breakthrough in Airborne tactics should not be underestimated, and the Continental Army Command is looking forward to seeing their investment in these divisions pay off."

One debate which has risen to the forefront in recent weeks has been that of the flag of our country. During the war, we flew many banners, however among the most popular and most \"official\" was a variation of the old U.S. flag with the stripes dipped in red dye. Combining the old stars with the red of the revolution, it was well received at the time, however some more radical elements in the IWW and SPA were uncomfortable with the continuity with existing symbolism.\n\nWith the constitutional convention almost complete, a number of redesigns have been considered by a special committee. The first option is simply to keep the flag as is. Though it was a haphazard design, some have made the emotive argument that many died for the revolution under it, and after years of instability many yearn for a flag that represents stability and continuity as well as the new regime.\n\nAlternatively, one proposed design places the new state emblem in white in the middle of a red banner. This striking design does away with traditional American iconography, while being politically acceptable to most factions. Though a striking departure from the old, many regard it as a logical continuation of the revolutionisation of American culture, and as of now it appears to be the most popular alternative to the current flag.\n\nMeanwhile, the IWW bloc has launched a campaign for a flag drawn straight from their iconography. A red and black flag with a white globe, lettering, and stars might scream wobbly, but it has clear advocates on the left of the convention.\n\nFinally, a popular petition has been launched for a design incorporating the stripes of the old U.S. flag. Though the petition has a large number of signatures, the radical committee has refused to consider the "counterrevolutionary" proposal. Earl Browder has criticised the provisional government for this slight, promising that a TUUL-led executive would instate a flag incorporating the stripes and the state emblem.\n\nIn any case, the time has come for the committee to choose the flag of the new commonwealth. The new symbol of America is to be decided."

His allegiance to socialism was unshakable, and through an early friendship with William Foster, he became a syndicalist. As the years passed, the two men began to drift apart. While Foster favoured an authoritarian form of syndicalism, Browder began to see more and more limits with the movement. The American revolution has according to him, proven that the same beliefs and strategies used in Europe cannot be applied to America. His new economic policy has been built with inspiration from Maximism, as well as plenty of original thought. Browder also intends to end the persistent trend of anarchism in Congress, and to pursue lecherous ultra-radical elements within the socialist state.

Born to a business family on the West Coast, he lived an unassuming upper-class life until studies in Harvard, where he, coming into contact with socialist clubs and literature, came to realise that there is a world beyond the dull halls of college, and that world suffered constant hardship. Despite being in poor health from birth, Reed chose a traveller's life, working as a common labourer to make a living and travel from nation to nation, and gaining fame as a war correspondent.\n\nWhat earned him more fame, however, was his involvement in the great revolutions of the period. The first he witnessed was the Mexican one as early as 1913, then the Russian one, in 1917, which he worked for devoutly and which consolidated his revolutionary socialist beliefs. It was during this time period that he wrote the 10 Days That Shook the World, his most famous work. In 1918, he returned to America, but was no longer welcome by America and its anti-sedition acts, so a year later, he fled again - this time to France, to a new, brewing revolution, and unlike the Russian one, actually successful. Fighting alongside the French Syndicalists dictated Reed a goal in life - to import this success to America, to have it be the next to come, and with America's unfathomable industrial might, bring forth a world revolution.\n\nA long time has passed since then, and Reed has achieved far - he has helped orchestrate the union of American socialists into one united front, served as a Senator, as a Presidential candidate, and has finally called the Steel Belt to revolution. However, his goal remains the same - to be the next great revolutionary, to be the same figure greater than life which the lowly war correspondent from twenty years ago would write about.§!"

In the leadup to the civil war, Flynn helped organise the longshoremen strike of the West Coast. Flynn's wartime speeches to the Central Committee to encourage conscription made her stand out to the numerous conscientious objectors in the Committee. Ultimately Flynn was elected to lead America as a shocking dark horse candidate.

Hoan enrolled in the University of Wisconsin and swiftly laid out the foundation for the university's Socialist Club, back when it had a mere four members. Hoan was admitted to the state bar in 1908 and moved to Milwaukee, where he began working with Victor Berger, editor of The Milwaukee Leader, in advocating for radical reforms to the city: public ownership of utilities, urban development programs, free legal, medical, and educational services, and other policies widely unheard of in most of the country. In 1916, Hoan was elected mayor, the second Socialist to hold that office. As mayor, Hoan codified what is sometimes called 'constructive socialism', emphasising practical reforms over haughty revolutionary ideals - some more itinerant socialists derisively called the Milwaukee branch members 'sewer socialists' for their constant touting of their city's sewer system.\n\nHoan's constructive socialism led him to side with Berger in the factional conflict of 1920. With Berger and the rest of the losing side of that dispute, Hoan entered the breakaway Social Democratic Party, which later reformed itself into the Social Democratic Federation. What followed was years of intermittent conflict between party loyalists and the SDF in Milwaukee, which led to Hoan intermittently losing the mayorship. Berger's death however gave Hoan control over the Milwaukee SDF, and through Farmer-Labor he reconciled with the Socialists to a limited degree.\n\nWhen the Civil War came, Hoan did not hesitate to align his city with the revolutionary government. Decidedly on the left end of the SDF, Hoan's ties to Norman Thomas' \"Progressive Caucus\" grew. When, after the war, the caucus broke away to form the Commonwealth Party, Hoan left the SDF and joined it, eventually being nominated by it to the presidency. Though Hoan's moderate past may seem out of sync with the revolution, Hoan, ever the opportunist, has adapted well to changing circumstances, and to many represents a new sense of practicality for a revolution looking to settle down.§!"

Reaching his adult years just at the onset of the Great Depression, he struggled to make a living, and worked whatever odd jobs he could find. While working as an advertising salesman in 1928, Hass came into contact with the Socialist Party, which he soon joined, as did many in his generation. Soon however, Hass found himself in a very particular circle of socialists: the Industial Labor Group, the rump of the old Socialist Labor Party of Daniel De Leon, which had merged into the SPA in 1918. Though the ILG was aligned with the reigning Industrial Unionist faction of the SPA, they were generally considered a group of has beens.\n\nHass however soon endevoured to revive the group's fortunes. An energetic organiser, he brought a spirit of youth and creativity to the ILG headquarters. When he was elected editor of the ILG newspaper, the Weekly People, he successfully returned it to a daily format by 1936. Under the patronage of former SLPer Louis C. Fraina, the ILG regained influence, and De Leonist views became more and more explicitly mainstream.\n\nNow, with Hass' election to the presidency, De Leonism has returned in force. No longer is it only influential by proxy and by its sympathetic apostates like Fraina. Now, it is a leading tendency in American socialism, and headed by the young turk Hass, it flourishes§!"

 WCA_eleanor_roosevelt_leader_desc: "§YBorn:§! §LOctober 11th, 1884, in New York City, New York, United States of America§!\n§YBackground:§! §LAt first glance, Anna Eleanor Roosevelt as the leader of a Syndicalist revolution seems to be a paradox. Born and raised as a socialite in the wealthy and influential Roosevelt family, she was not with the $WCA_ACW$ when the revolution began, remaining in New England and hoping until the last moment that a peace could be found. While supportive of the workers' struggle, her revolutionary credentials are lacking, and she hardly fits the image of the jumped-up union boss that many associate with our young nation's leadership. Her opponents insist that these appearances are not deceiving - diehard supporters of the revolution call her a Trojan horse for the bourgeoisie, while opponents of the new government decry her as a laughable attempt by the socialists to convince the American people that they aren't bloodthirsty tyrants.\n\nAnd yet, when one considers it, the logic becomes a bit more clear. The triumph of the $WCA_ACW$ created a problem for both the old American elite and the new revolutionary government: the former had been defeated and left ostracised in the new America, while the latter was faced with a population that was and is reluctant to trust them. In Roosevelt, the Socialist Party saw a solution to both - a reconciliatory figure that might unite the supporters of the revolution with feminists, African-Americans, and reformists and ease the reintegration of old elites into society. Whether this controversial plan will work remains to be seen, but what is certain is that with her ascent to the presidency, America will yet again never be the same.§!"

Perhaps because of this, Zeidler was drawn to socialism from a young age - growing up in the throes of the Great Depression, Zeidler read extensively from left-wing writers like Norman Thomas and Eugene V. Debs. When asked about his reasons for supporting socialism in 1933, Zeidler cited the tenets of international brotherhood, the struggle for peace, equal distribution of goods, cooperation, and democratic planning. He would become active in the Socialist Party of America's youth wing, the Young People's Socialist League, and shortly before the civil war became the head of the Milwaukee branch of the Red Falcons, another SPA organisation aimed at educating children. Frank was aided in his activist work by his brother, Carl Zeidler, who would go on to volunteer for the navy of the $WCA_ACW$, only to die in the effort.\n\nDespite his perpetual sickly health and the untimely death of his brother, Zeidler did what he could to support the socialist war effort on the home front, and attended the constitutional convention as an ally of the libertarian socialist \"Militant\" faction. Joining the Militants in the newly formed Commonwealth Party, Zeidler succeeded Hoan as Mayor of Milwaukee, continuing the city's tradition of good, constructive socialist government.

A series of raids and near arrests by the Department of Justice saw him go underground, but he remerged as a political figure when he helped lead the brief rebellion known as the Seattle Commune in 1923. During the Commune's existence he met John Reed, striking up a friendship with the famed journalist and following him to New York City.

Fraina's father was an Italian radical republican, and his death prevented Fraina from completing his secondary education, as the young man had to obtain a full-time job to support his family. Instead, Fraina pursued forms of self-education, engrossing himself in radical and freethinking literature. In 1909, he published his first essay. By 1910, he was a prolific writer for the Daily People, the newspaper of Daniel De Leon's Socialist Labor Party.\n\nThough Fraina had briefly been a member of the Socialist Party, the SLP was where he developed his ideas more fully. Embracing De Leon's views on revolutionary industrial unionism, Fraina became a more prolific writer for the Daily People than De Leon himself. He covered the Lawrence Textile Strike, a heroic moment in labour history which left its mark on Fraina. Though he left the SLP in 1914, he continued his carreer in radical journalism, writing for avant garde cultural publications, developing ideas of socialist cultural modernism.\n\nThe growth in the left-wing of the Socialist Party from 1917 brought Fraina back into that organisation. A co-author of the Left-Wing Manifesto of 1919, Fraina wrote that \"Industrial Unions or Councils, or a combination of both, may serve as the basis of a revolutionary system\", predicting future developments in world socialism.\n\nWhen the left took over the party, Fraina took a leading role, both as a member of its Executive Committee, and later, after John Reed became party chairman, in the position of international secretary. Though Fraina's administrative ability was limited, he was a key propagandist, ideologue, and theorist for the Industrial Unionist faction and the Socialist Party as a whole. He continued to publish works of economics, sociology, and culture, and was regarded as the country's foremost Marxist economist.\n\nA key architect of the post-war constitution, Fraina served in several cabinet positions in several administrations, helping to bring about his vision of a revolutionary industrial unionist commonwealth.

Although Sinclair had hoped to rally the country behind the worker's cause, he instead merely exposed the lack of hygiene in the meatpacking industry; in response to this reaction, he declared \"I aimed for the country's heart, but hit them in the stomach\". With the profits from his literary career, Sinclair pursued politics in California, launching the \"End Poverty In California\" campaign.

Academia was his calling, and while he was an instructor at the University of Pennsylvania he spent time at universities in Paris, Berlin, and Geneva. Paris in particular was important in bringing the leftist Krueger in contact with the worldwide socialist movement, and he made many lasting contacts there.\n\nHis acceptance of a position at the University of Chicago as an assistant professor also marked Krueger's increasing involvement in politics. A member of the Socialist Party, Krueger was part of the growing \"Militant\" tendency, a group of young turks who both believed in a revolutionary road to power while also opposing the authoritarian attitudes of John Reed's party leadership. As such, the Militants became close to Norman Thomas' \"Progressive\" faction, becoming arguably its left-wing.\n\nKrueger, a leader of the Militants, was a national director of research for the Socialist Party during the 1932 election. He was also involved with the Chicago Workers Committee on Unemployment, and was vice president of the American Federation of Teachers. When Civil War broke out in 1937, Krueger was a leading member of the Chicago Commune, serving as a leader of the moderate opposition to the Industrial Unionists in the city. After the war, he led the Militants into the Commonwealth Party, a party that was as much his own creation as it was Thomas'.\n\nWhen Thomas retired after Commonwealth's defeat in the post-war elections, Krueger was the obvious choice to succeed him.

Growing up in a family of radicals, he often heard stories of the exploits of Russian socialists, and he was familiar with socialist ideas from a young age. As he worked as a retail clerk while studying law, he helped organise the Retail Clerks Union, political activity for which he was discharged from his job and blacklisted by the Merchants' Association.\n\nAfter being blacklisted from the retail sales industry, he worked briefly as a garmant cutter before entering the world of radical journalism. A member of the Socialist Party of America from the moment he turned 18, in 1919 he immediately gravitated towards the party's emerging left-wing. With Louis C. Fraina and Charles Ruthenberg he co-authored the Left-Wing Manifesto of 1919, and soon struck up a lifelong friendship with John Reed. Eventually, he became the business manager of The Revolutionary Age, the publication of the left-wing and later the party as a whole.\n\nAfter the left-wing captured the party, Gitlow was elected to the New York State Assembly. Balancing his duties as a parliamentarian and prominent party administrator, Gitlow combined legal and illegal work. The Red Scare during the British Revolution was a moment of crisis for the party.

From the age of 19, Reuther organized and worked in Detroit, his impressive technical skill securing for himself a life-long profession as a tool and die maker. From 1932, as an official representative of the Socialist Party, Reuther spent time working in the factories of Britain and France, where he saw firsthand the power of syndicalist organization. His skilled leadership as head of United Auto Workers Local 174 saw him quickly propelled to the union's higher elected positions; in 1936 he became famous nationwide for the 'Battle of the Overpass', where Ford thugs crossed the picket line to beat him nearly to death.\n\nStill, Reuther has never relented. Elected chairman of the Detroit Commune during the outbreak of the Revolution, Reuther played an important role in organizing production across the entirety of the vital Steel Belt.

In spite of this, Minor's family struggled financially, and he was only able to go to school for four years before needing to get a job.\n\nAfter working a variety of jobs, Minor was hired as an assistant stereotypist and handyman at the San Antonio Gazette. There, he developed his artistic skills, and emerged as a respected political cartoonist. Moving to St. Louis to work for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Minor became regarded as one of the best political cartoonists in the country. By 1911, he was the highest paid cartoonist in the United States. Moving to France to study art, he found the experience unsatisfying, and returned in 1914 just before the outbreak of war in Europe.\n\nPolitically, Minor joined the Socialist Party in 1907 before moving towards anarchism in 1912. An advocate for revolutionary industrial unionism, he lost work because of his refusal to draw pro-war cartoons. In 1915, he moved to the Socialist Party's New York Call, and began drawing for Max Eastman's radical monthly The Masses. The Call sent Minor to Europe in 1918 as a war correspondant, where he visited Soviet Russia, Germany, and France, where he witnessed the 1919 Revolution. These experiences returned Minor to the realm of party socialism, and he became more involved in the radicalising SPA.\n\nThrough the 1920s and early 1930s, Minor got into the good graces of the Industrial Unionist faction which dominated the party. He served as a delegate to the Third International, and ran for several offices in New York. Now transformed into a loyal party cadre, Minor served in several administrative roles both during and after the Revolution, and was elected to the presidency as a largely inoffensive compromise candidate. Nevertheless, he is committed to industrial unionism and America's role in the international revolution, and will seek to fully commit the Commonwealth to the good fight.§!"

Philip Randolph was born to a minister father and a seamstress mother. As a child growing up in Jacksonville, Randolph learned the importance of character over skin colour from the former, and the importance of education and defending oneself from the latter - he would later vividly recall a night from his youth where his mother sat in the front room of his house with a loaded shotgun, while his father took a pistol and left to prevent a man from being lynched at the county jail. A gifted student, Randolph enrolled in the Cookman Institute - then the only high school in Florida for African-Americans - before being forced by employment segregation to move to New York City to study at City College. After a short attempt at theatre, Randolph became increasingly familiar with socialism, determining that people could only be free if not subjected to economic deprivation - with this in mind, Randolph began his civil rights career by establishing an employment office in Harlem aimed at providing work training to southern migrants. Randolph, along with his partner Chandler Owens and the aid of the Socialist Party of America, founded 'The Messenger', a radical magazine calling for African-Americans to organise and fight for an integrated society. Randolph also developed strong union credentials, most famously organising the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters to address the deplorable working conditions of the primarily African-American industry.\n\nAlthough Randolph was somewhat hesitant to embrace the cause of revolution by force, he, like many others, was left with little choice as civil war broke out regardless. During and after the war, Randolph continued to concern himself with the needs of African-Americans as he always had, shifting his focus to union discrimination - arguing that the destruction of the colour barrier is a necessary component of a socialist America. For his efforts, he was picked as the Socialist Party's nominee for president - and with his election, President Randolph has become the first African-American to lead America, providing hope to many that the days of racial inequality might, at long last, be drawing to a close.§!"

He did not see combat until the end of the war, when he was sent to deal with insurgents in the Philippines and was once again put in charge of soldiers of a different race. Parsons began to get gradually involved in military office politics, relying on his old superior Robert Lee Bullard from the Alabama 3rd to provide him with support for his unorthodox proposals. Parsons was an adamant champion of racial integration. His radical proposal for an immediate and total racial integration of the army was dismissed as ludicrous and he was advised to focus on less controversial affairs.\n\nHe took up work commanding various National Guards before being sent to Fort Meade, Maryland, where he established a tank school and began to promote new theories about armoured warfare that he had learned from studying the Weltkrieg and the military of the Union of Britain. His subsequent recommendation to the U.S Army was to establish dedicated tank divisions who could punch through enemy defences at lightning speed, going far and beyond any scale of armoured warfare that had been seen before. Tank units were normally only the size of a regiment, but Parsons called for the establishment of six entire divisions as the optimal fighting force. This was quietly ignored, much like his integration proposals. By the time of the American Civil War, Parsons knew well and truly which side he was on. Having been appointed in 1936 to lead the 6th Infantry Division in Illinois, which was then in reserve, Parsons presented his credentials to Provisional Government in Chicago, which immediately made great use of his vigorous political commitment and his revolutionary military doctrines.§!"

In 1932, he was chosen to attend the Army War College and graduated on June 1933. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel on 26 February 1934. With the country spiralling into Civil War, Devers found himself fighting more and more against his superiors inability to react to internal issues, starting a deep rivalry between him and Dwight Eisenhower, even putting him at odds with his old friend Lesley McNair. He also grew increasingly conscious of racial issues in America, writing letters of complaints about how poor the facilities were for black soldiers at the various locales he served in, as well as how there seemed to be a two tiered justice system that treated black soldiers much more harshly than white ones. Finding himself in Pennsylvania during the fateful few weeks before violence erupted, Devers asked his wife to flee to Canada before he presented himself to the government in Chicago and was put in charge of the Detroit XVI Corps.§!"

From an early age, Shoup leaned politically to the left - having been moulded by the progressive ideas of Indiana politicians fighting against Wall Street's big businesses. Excelling in academics and extracurriculars such as wrestling and football, he joined the United States Marine Corps for financial reasons. In the Marine Corps, Shoup was recognised for his athletics, marksmanship, and leadership skills - impressing his commanders and subordinates for his ability to keep morale with his sense of humour. From 1927 to 1934, Shoup served in China, protecting American interests in the war-torn country, a mission he was personally opposed to seeing his actions as simply an imperialist exploitation of the Chinese people. As the nation began to spiral into chaos, Shoup's anti-imperialist stance and personal beliefs made him a staunch supporter and ally of fellow Marine Corps General Smedly Butler. When the time came for revolution, Shoup committed himself to the syndicalist cause and Butler, bringing the experience and leadership the Second Continental Army desperately needed.§!"

Lying about his age, Allen joined Pershing's expedition to seek out Pancho Villa after which he graduated from the University of Wisconsin and took up reporting. It was in Wisconsin, one of the key hotbeds of American socialism that Allen became dedicated to Reed's cause. As racial tensions seeped into American society with the ongoing economic crisis, Allen used his investigative journaling skills to successfully infiltrate the Ku Klux Klan. A foreign correspondent with the Christian Science Monitor, Allen's dissatisfaction with the Hoover administration compelled him to write an anonymous expose \"Washington Merry Go-Round.\" Disillusioned with MacArthur's military clique in Washington and Hoover's incompetence brought Allen more and more committed to the vision of America held by the SPA.

He worked with his brother in a meatpacking plant until he came of age, after which he enlisted and was selected to officer training, graduating from the Officer Candidate School in 1917 as an infantry second lieutenant. He reached the rank of Captain in 1923, and would start the Infantry Company Officer Course, graduating in 1926. With the growing schism between the pro-mechanisation officers and the traditionalists, Rose joined the former, meeting higher ranking officers like Dwight Eisenhower and George Patton, who instilled some of their theoretical armoured warfare knowledge into him. He'd undergo the Cavalry Officer Course in 1928, graduating in 1931, and then joining the Command and General Staff College, where he was still undergoing the final stages of his training when the Civil War was about to break out.\n\nRose's career had unfortunately been plagued with discrimination because of his Jewish origin, both from his commanding officers and fellow colleagues, most notably from General George Van Horn Moseley and Pedro Augusto del Valle, who are even said to have held his promotions back because of his background.\n\nAs a reaction to his treatment, Rose began to be seduced by the promises of social equality by the Socialist Party of America and when the situation finally seemed unsalvageable, Rose decided to defect northwards, where he joined the Red Guard.

Forced to take odd jobs to continue his education after graduating from high school, he ended up joining the Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) branch at the University of Nevada, where he graduated in 1932, marrying his wife Marion, also a student, on their graduation day. After this, he enrolled at the University of California, Berkeley, to pursue a master's degree in economics. With the Depression's grip worsening in America and fascinated by French and British economic structures, he and Marion moved to Paris for a year to study at the Sorbonne. Returning to California in 1935, he finished his master's degree and was accepted to the University of Chicago's PhD programme in 1936, drawn to the growing revolutionary activity in the city.\n\nAs MacArthur's deadline loomed over Reed's conference, Merriman, with his background in the ROTC, began teaching students of all ages the rudimentary military training he had learned half a decade ago. Though he was not a devoted syndicalist, Merriman was outraged by the widespread political repression and authoritarian tenancies demonstrated by the American government in the summer of 1936, and with his warm personality and commanding figure he was elected to lead the University's branch of the Red Militia.\n\nUnlike many of the other young officers voted into command by their peers, Merriman's military training and educated background made him stand out to Smedley Butler, who hand-picked the young man for higher command, and began to nurture what he saw as his strong talent for leadership and command.§!\n\n§YNotes: It is unclear where exactly Merriman's political loyalties lie within the greater Congress.

He fought in the Philippine-American war in 1901, before returning home to help teach Military Science and Tactics at the traditionally black Wilberforce College in Ohio - a position he would assume multiple times in his career. He also had a stint in Liberia and Tuskegee Institute in Alabama. He was promoted to Colonel in the regular army in 1930, matching a feat his mentor Charles Young accomplished about a decade prior\n\nThe deteriorating political situation in America and harassment by Longists and Klansmen in Alabama saw Davis quietly ask to return north to Wilberforce to resume his position as a professor there for a third time. Although not known to be a socialist, Davis was sympathetic to the egalitarian message of the SPA and was one of the few high ranking American Army officers not openly hostile to John Reed. Disillusioned by the election of 1936 and the outbreak of civil war, when Ohio's governor declared its loyalty to the Chicago government Davis remained at his post as a national guard commander.
