### Sub-ideologies ###
 BAT_social_liberal_subtype_desc: "The Baltic German Democratic Party follows the ideological thought of Paul Schiemann, which can best be described as meritocratic liberalism. It worships the inherent human rights of the individual and equality of opportunity no matter one's religion, nationality or social standing. However, this does not equate to equality of outcome, nor equal political rights - the right to rule should be reserved to those who have the merit and ability to rule, and educated individuals should have inherently more political rights than the uneducated lower masses. Meritocratic liberalism seeks to establish a corporatist, meritocratic political system where the government is composed of delegates from all social groups and political professionals, and it believes in the enlightening mission of the government - its goal should be to create a free, educated, culturally enlightened society, and thus give anyone the ability to rise through the meritocratic ranks."
 BAT_national_populist_subtype_desc: "The Baltic Brotherhood follows its own firebrand ideology, an eclectic mutation of radical Christianity and Baltic German exceptionalism. It is a millenarian religious movement which proclaims a new reading of the Bible and calls for a restoration of Christian morality across all of Europe. In the Baltic German nation, it sees a history of religious warfare and stalwart faith, and so believes that their purpose is to champion this rebirth of Christianity in the face of Eastern and Syndicalist onslaught. Fanatically loyal to pan-Germanism, the Brotherhood believes that Germany's role should be to lead Europe in this crusade, and so its goal is to turn the Baltics into a model province for the 'National Revival', from where the flame can be brought to Germany. In practice, its regime is totalitarian, fanatically dedicated to Christian ideals, and heavily militaristic."

### Bookmark ###
 BAT_KR_gathering_storm_desc: "The Baltic German nobility got what it wanted from the Weltkrieg - a restoration of the rights and privileges which Russification policies trampled over and a state they could call their own, the United Baltic Duchy. Here, under the reign of Duke Adolf Friedrich, the Four Baltic Knighthoods rule a decentralised monarchy, the sentinel of aristocratic tradition. But pressure mounts to reform this byzantine system, and the Duke has pushed through a liberal, reformist government to see the changes through. When everything is against them, however, can the Baltic German dream survive?"

### Intro Screen ###
 BAT_country_intro_header: "The United Baltic Duchy"
 BAT_country_intro_content: "Standing on the eastern coast of the Baltic Sea, the United Baltic Duchy is the easternmost Germanic state in Europe, formed in 1918 with the initiative of the local Baltic German population. Though initially imagined as a new member state of the German Empire, these hopes were eventually dashed, as the geopolitical realities of post-Weltkrieg Europe and the overwhelming Latvian and Estonian majority population made such a project impossible - not that the Baltic Germans themselves hardly wanted to lose their identity to the Heimat. Having successfully suppressed the Estonian War of Independence and prevented a similar uprising in Latvia thanks to the fractures within the Latvian nationalist movement, the Duchy established itself and now counts almost twenty years of history.\n\nThe United Baltic Duchy is, first and foremost, rooted in tradition. It inherits Provincial Ostsee Law, the system of representation through Landtags, and the institutional role of the Baltic Knighthoods from the times of the Livonian Confederation, and these traditions make up a large part of Baltic German identity. Even the poorest Baltic noble is proud of living in a community which listens to the concerns of each and every landowner, and holds the knightly traditions of the nobility in utmost respect. In practice, however, this means that the Duchy is a barely functional state with a byzantine system of government, completely unprepared for the challenges facing ahead..."

 BAT_country_intro_header_1: "Convent of von Samson-Himmelstjerna"
 BAT_country_intro_content_1: "The current Chairman of the Land Colleges, and thus head of the Convent of the Land Administrators, the executive government of the Duchy, is Friedrich von Samson-Himmelstjerna, a former member of the Ducal Regency Council and member of the Baltic German Democratic Party.\n\nFollowing a succession of several conservative governments controlled by the Baltic Knighthoods, the pressure for reform within the United Baltic Duchy eventually became too hard to bear. A strengthening Baltic German middle class, traditionally reluctantly allied with the conservative nobility, started to sway to the other side, joining forces with reformist and Baltic nationalist groups if it meant that any reform to the byzantine, antiquated system was introduced. Though by no means a liberal reformist, eventually Duke Adolf Friedrich himself had to intervene. Using the powers of royal prerogative, he dismissed the previous Chairman of the Land Colleges and cooperated with the liberal reformist Democratic Party to help forge an alliance of liberal and moderate parties.\n\nThe true power behind the throne, however, is Paul Schiemann, the leader of the DbDP. A liberal reformist, he could not assume any position in the Landratskollegium because of his non-noble birth, but nevertheless served as the guide of the incumbent government from his lowly position. An idealistic visionary, Paul Schiemann envisions a liberal, pluralistic Baltic Federation with an established modern constitution, free, universal and democratic elections, equality between the Baltic Germans and the native Balts, and a system of social welfare. Believing his vision to be superior to the reaction of the Knighthoods, he is supported by the representatives of native Balts and the German middle class in the Landtag, and has the reluctant acquiescence of the moderate conservative DbRP. The Duke also sees his programme as a step in the right direction, even if he disagrees with some of the tenets."

 BAT_country_intro_header_2: "Government Structure of the Duchy"
 BAT_country_intro_content_2: "The United Baltic Duchy can best be described as a federal oligarchic semi-constitutional monarchy. It is devolved into six Cantons, each one with their own Landtags and Land Colleges, and the autonomous City of Riga. This division of powers is replicated in the federal government, which is composed of the Landtag of the United Baltic Duchy and the Convent of the Land Administrators. The Baltic Landtag is a parliamentary body, elected by the inhabitants of the Duchy with the Prussian three-house electoral system, and is headed by the Land Marshal. The Land Colleges and the Convent are appointed by the four Baltic Knighthoods — corporations of the Baltic German nobility. Above both stands the Duke, who has the power of judicial and executive appointment, and other powers of royal prerogative.\n\nWhile it is easy to assume that the Landtag is the legislature and the Convent is the executive, the truth is far more complicated than that. The Convent is not made up of ministries, but is rather a body of 18 Land Administrators who collectively manage the day to day matters of the state in cooperation with the Knighthoods and the Landtag. They have the features of an upper house — they attend Landtag sessions and cannot propose laws, but review them, and their stated purpose is \"vigilant, paternal care for the upholding of the rights, legality, institutions, and fixed customs of the nobility\". The Convent does not have permanent ministries, only temporary offices they can form to manage issues once they arise and which fall under their purview. Meanwhile, the Landtag can form its own executive offices and institutions with majority vote, something which the Convent is unable to prevent, nor can they propose laws, so their ability to rule the state is completely at the mercy of the Landtag and whatever it wishes. But the Landtag is at the mercy of the Convent, too, however, as the role of the Baltic Knighthoods to manage the state is institutional and cannot simply be removed.\n\nThis wasn't a problem in the 16th century, when the Knighthoods and Landtag were just a large group of nobles, but things have changed..."

 BAT_country_intro_header_3: "Political Concerns"
 BAT_country_intro_content_3: "The coalition orchestrated by the Baltic German Democratic Party may have a noble goal to reform the Duchy to the modern age, but their enemies are plentiful. The Baltic Knighthoods, noble corporations which unite the Baltic German nobility, hold no good will towards the liberal constitutionalist project espoused by Paul Schiemann, seeing it as a threat to the historical traditions of the lands they are supposed to protect. A major thorn in the side of the incumbent Convent is the fact that the Knighthoods have their own man in the government - Baron Rolf von Ungern-Sternberg, Land Marshal of the Ducal Landtag. While by no means a reactionary, von Ungern-Sternberg is a conservative landowner and definitely does not sympathise with the liberal Democratic Party - and should the situation decay, his complacency may break at last.\n\nTwo decades of political decay and infighting have left quite a few Baltic nobles, especially younger ambitious ones, disappointed with the entire system. Both the liberal Baltic Federation project and the reaction of the Baltic Knighthoods disappoint them, the former for surrendering to the inferior natives and the latter for failing to restore the greatness of the Baltic state. Their salvation is the Baltic Brotherhood, a clandestine religious and Pan-Germanic nationalist order, operating in brotherly circles in cities and towns and exerting their power through influence within Baltic German nobles. Its goal is the renewal of the Teutonic spirit of the Baltic Germans and a deep union with the German Empire, and their mission is to resurrect the medieval idea of Drang Nach Osten, a crusade to the East in the name of Germanic supremacy. Due to the Baltic Brotherhood's ambition to centralise the state, both the Duke and Landtag are adamantly incompatible and can never cooperate.\n\nThe Latvians and Estonians have never fully accepted their subordination in the Baltic Duchy. Their nationalist movements lost strength after the failed uprisings of 1918, but rebuilt it by the early 1930s. The government in exile of the Republic of Estonia in Stockholm and the Latvian National Council in Petrograd advocate for the independence of their respective nations, and groups of partisans within the forests and hills are forming in preparation for the final struggle for liberation..."

 KRBAT.5: "Black Monday Reaches the Duchy"
 KRBAT.5.t: "Black Monday Reaches the Duchy"
 KRBAT.5.d: "The economic boom of the late 1920s and early 1930s has come to an end, and the United Baltic Duchy's deep economic ties to the German Empire have dragged it with the rest of the Reichspakt to economic disarray. Exports have frozen, factories are relieving workers en masse, and all financial activity has come to a screeching halt. This crisis has caught the Ducal Landtag dissolved and the Convent of Land Administrators paralysed, unsure of how to act in response. There is only one thing left to do to counter the developing economic crisis..."
 KRBAT.5.a: "Gather an extraordinary session of the Landtag!"

 KRBAT.6: "Paul Schiemann's Closing Statement"
 KRBAT.6.t: "Paul Schiemann's Closing Statement"
 KRBAT.6.d: "Currently, the Landtag of the United Baltic Duchy is gathered to its winter session in Riga. As the budget for the fiscal year of 1936 has been approved and given the Convent's stamp of approval, the rest of the two-week session has been largely passive and devoid of conflict. The closing statement of the Landtag session has raised a bit of a ruckus, however. Whilst tradition requires the captains of the Four Baltic Knighthoods to make the closing statement and wish the gathered Baltic nobility a good year, Chairman of the Land Colleges Friedrich von Samson-Himmelstjerna instead invited Paul Schiemann, the head of the Democratic Party, to leave the departing Landtag members on a good note.\n\nAlbeit sickly and elderly, Schiemann has managed to fulfil the duties requested, and spoke for half an hour about the envisioned reforms of him, his party, and the government of the Duchy - on the other hand, however, he avoided getting into verbal conflict with the Knighthoods, mentioning them and affirming that 'good men such as these are necessary in times of change, and I sincerely hope that they will lend their support to the cause of reforms'. While this was not going to amend the rift between him and Adolf Constantin Pilar von Pilchau, the Knight-Captain of the Livonian Knighthood and by extension the most powerful of the four Knighthood leaders... the inclusive nature of his speech has dissuaded the fears of many conservatives."
 KRBAT.6.a: "Until the summer session, then!"
 KRBAT.6.b: "Who is Paul Schiemann?"

 KRBAT.7: "Ringing Alarm Bells"
 KRBAT.7.t: "Ringing Alarm Bells"
 KRBAT.7.d: "An extraordinary session of the Baltic Landtag has been called, but has only exacerbated tensions within the upper echelons of government. In the first week of debates, no solution has been found, as even the Liberal coalition itself disagrees on what response should be taken. Representatives of the mercantile classes and the moderate conservatives under the Reform Party and Progressive Party, allied with the Democratic Party out of circumstance, vehemently disagree with Paul Schiemann's proposal on a social market economy. He and Chairman von Samson-Himmelstjerna believe that the Duchy's economic downturn was caused by unbridled free market activity and a compassionate social service system must arise in its place. Moderates such as Edwin Magnus and Werner Hasselblatt have delivered scathing criticism of this proposal in the Landtag, however, despite being ostensibly in the same coalition.\n\nOn the other hand, the Democratic Bloc, a social democratic alliance of Latvian and Estonian representatives in the Landtag, declares that the proposal does not go far enough. Pauls Kalniņš, the leader of the Democratic Bloc faction in the legislature, has delivered a report on the exploitation of native Baltic workers by German business firms in Reval and Riga, descriptions of sharp poverty among the peasant population, and demanded the government to act. All plans for constitutional reforms have to be put to rest when the coalition is struggling to survive."
 KRBAT.7.a: "Damn it..."

 KRBAT.8: "Ungern-Sternberg's Gambit"
 KRBAT.8.t: "Ungern-Sternberg's Gambit"
 KRBAT.8.d: "Disagreements within the Democratic Party coalition have spurred Rolf von Ungern-Sternberg's, the Land Marshal of the Baltic Landtag, to act. In secret, he met with Adolf Constantin Pilar von Pilchau and Wilhelm Robert von Bulmerincq, Knight-Captain of the Livonian Knighthood and leader of the conservative People's Party respectively, and secured their support for a gambit.\n\nStanding before the extraordinary session of the Landtag, von Ungern-Sternberg announced that he exerts his prerogative as Land Marshal to dismiss the Convent of Land Administrators from the session and remove all of the legislative projects initiated by the Democratic Party from the session schedule, effectively nullifying all of their power over the Landtag. The Reform Party which von Ungern-Sternberg represents has crossed benches and formed a majority with the DbVP and representatives of the Knighthoods, denying the Liberal coalition legislative power as well.\n\nInstead of resigning and allowing the Four Knighthoods to appoint a new Convent, Chairman von Samson-Himmelstjerna has chosen to fight. The executive government has been paralysed and a political battle of attrition begins..."
 KRBAT.8.a: "You bastard!"
 KRBAT.8.b: "Who are von Ungern-Sternberg and von Pilchau?"

 KRBAT.14.t: "The End of the Dream"
 KRBAT.14.d: "The disintegrating situation in the Duchy's government has finally drawn the ire of Duke Adolf Friedrich I. Though initially supportive of Chairman Friedrich von Samson-Himmelstjerna and his liberal government, and content to let the Landtag duke out their differences while citing his political neutrality... he has finally lost all hope that Paul Schiemann and his fragile coalition will be able to lead the country to a new age. Cooperating with Adolf Constantin Pilar von Pilchau, the Duke has released a decree ordering the incumbent Convent to resign and allow the Four Knighthoods to form a new administration.\n\nFaced with the Duke's insistence, von Samson-Himmelstjerna has finally resigned, and the Baltic Knighthoods have pushed through an aristocratic, conservative government headed by Freiherr Axel von Freytagh-Loringhoven. Finding approval from the conservative People's Party and moderate Reform Party in the Landtag, von Freytagh-Loringhoven has filled out his Land Administrator seats with conservative nobles. In a speech in the Landtag, he has sworn to revert the destructive liberal reforms of the Democratic Party and strengthen the Duchy by maintaining the current course.\n\nPaul Schiemann spoke in the Landtag last, where he stated that he accepts the change in government despite being utterly dismayed at the Duke's betrayal - and asserts that the flame of liberalism will eventually rise again, under a new generation."
 KRBAT.14.a: "The dream of a free Baltic will never perish..."

 KRBAT.15.t: "The Liberal Dream Endures"
 KRBAT.15.d: "Land Marshal Rolf von Ungern-Sternberg's gambit has not paid off. In a political battle which has taken months, Chairman Friedrich von Samson-Himmelstjerna has formed an enduring coalition within the Landtag, formed out of allies and trusted confidants he has made through concessions and compromise, which has finally given him the necessary Political Capital to act. The Landtag assembled today to vote on no confidence in the incumbent Land Marshal, a vote which has narrowly passed, to the dismay of the conservatives and the reactionaries. However, lacking sufficient support in the parliament, and finding no help in the politically neutral Duke, they could only complain and mutter between themselves.\n\nIn his departing speech, Land Marshal von Ungern-Sternberg asserted that this political purge will not take off the restraints from Schiemann and his party - the Four Knighthoods, the Courts and the Duke will have to carry the torch of moderation and tradition from here on out. However, he did not try to fight the results, and he has been replaced with a loyal member of the DbDP, allowing normal government work to resume at last."
 KRBAT.15.a: "Three hurrahs for a free Baltic!"

 KRBAT.16.t: "Negotiations Stall This Week"
 KRBAT.16.d: "No progress has been made in political negotiations this week. Consensus between our government and the faction we've sought to align has not been reached, as neither side is willing to come to compromise - effectively, we have wasted a precious week of time seeking an agreement which is harder to reach than we've anticipated. Perhaps our peers in the Landtag have run out of things to offer, or perhaps they are holding an ace under their sleeves and are waiting for a more opportune moment..."
 KRBAT.16.a: "We'll just try again!"

 KRBAT.17.t: "Landowners Ask For Land Expropriation Help"
 KRBAT.17.d: "In an agricultural land such as the Baltic Duchy, those who own land are also often those with a lot of political power. The lobby of Baltic German land barons, agribusinesses, and foreign firms is important within the Duchy's politics thanks to their wealth and economic influence - and while they may not be enthusiastic with our liberal reforms, their loyalty or at least indifference is crucial if we want to see them pass.\n\nIn a smoke-filled room, representatives from the Landowner Lobby present a rather simple request to us. They need us to turn a blind eye to them buying out the lands of poor and destitute Latvian and Estonian farmers, increasing their wealth and pastures at the expense of the native population. This would seriously anger the non-German population, but buy us the support of landowner representatives in the Landtag."
 KRBAT.17.a: "Of course, a few displaced farmers is nothing wrong"
 KRBAT.17.b: "We will not betray our principles!"

 KRBAT.18.t: "Landowners Present Moderate Land Reform"
 KRBAT.18.d: "In an agricultural land such as the Baltic Duchy, those who own land are also often those with a lot of political power. The lobby of Baltic German land barons, agribusinesses, and foreign firms is important within the Duchy's politics thanks to their wealth and economic influence - and while they may not be enthusiastic with our liberal reforms, their loyalty or at least indifference is crucial if we want to see them pass.\n\nIn a smoke-filled room, representatives from the Landowner Lobby present a rather simple request to us. The programme of the Baltic German Democratic Party, among other things, asserts their belief in equitable land ownership. Seeing themselves as champions of pluralism and the lower class, they endorse moderate land reform to increase the share of land owned by personal farms, especially Latvian and Estonian ones. As this is a direct threat to their interests, the Lobby wishes us to quietly shove this promise under the rug, and promises considerable support in exchange."
 KRBAT.18.a: "Of course, that was just a promise..."
 KRBAT.18.b: "No, land reform stays"

 KRBAT.19.t: "Landowners Present Oil Drill Ban"
 KRBAT.19.d: "In an agricultural land such as the Baltic Duchy, those who own land are also often those with a lot of political power. The lobby of Baltic German land barons, agribusinesses, and foreign firms is influential within the Duchy's politics thanks to their wealth and economic influence - and while they may not be enthusiastic with our liberal reforms, their loyalty or at least indifference is crucial if we want to see them pass.\n\nIn a smoke-filled room, representatives from the Landowner Lobby present a rather simple request to us. Not long after the foundation of the Duchy, experimental exploitation of oil shale fields in Estonia began, and the shale mined turned out to be a potent substitute to natural gas. Supporters of autarkic, import-substitution development see oil shale as the future and the most profitable field of Baltic industry of tomorrow - however, the explored oil fields stand on the estates of Estonian land barons, who are unwilling to see their agricultural fields upturned for oil exploitation. Should we guarantee the rights of Estonian barons to their lands and prevent the expansion of oil shale mining there, the Landowner lobby promises us significant support."
 KRBAT.19.a: "Not a single oil pump will stand on your manor, Freiherr!"
 KRBAT.19.b: "No, it's too lucrative to pass up"

 KRBAT.20.t: "Businesses Ask To End Wage Law"
 KRBAT.20.d: "The businesses, large or small, owned by Baltic Germans in cities such as Riga and Reval hold considerable influence, both economic and political. The lobby of middle and upper class Baltic German city-dwellers, who have nothing to show for noble blood and instead carve out a path to power through wealth, are an ally of the Democratic Party thanks to our mutual opposition to the Four Knighthoods. Despite that, however, their interest first and foremost is safeguarding the interest of business, which we have to pay attention to.\n\nIn a smoke-filled room, representatives from the Business Lobby present a rather simple request to us. Our businesses and corporations employ a lot of lower class Latvian and Estonian city-dwellers, whom they keep in relaxed working conditions and pay them smaller wages than their German peers. This order, understandably, is hated by Baltic native interest parties, and the Democratic Party has sworn itself to put an end to these practices in their manifesto. However, should we turn a blind eye to the conditions in companies owned by the lobby, they promise us crucial financial support."
 KRBAT.20.a: "Nothing to see here, it's just business."
 KRBAT.20.b: "We will not betray our principles!"

 KRBAT.21.t: "Businesses Ask For Financial Aid"
 KRBAT.21.d: "The businesses, large or small, owned by Baltic Germans in cities such as Riga and Reval hold considerable influence, both economic and political. The lobby of middle and upper class Baltic German city-dwellers, who have nothing to show for noble blood and instead carve out a path to power through wealth, are an ally of the Democratic Party thanks to our mutual opposition to the Four Knighthoods. Despite that, however, their interest first and foremost is safeguarding the interest of business, which we have to pay attention to.\n\nIn a smoke-filled room, representatives from the Business Lobby present a rather simple request to us. The Black Monday economic crisis has severely hit their firms, especially since the situation continues to decay with no action in sight. Lacking approval from the Landtag, the Convent of Land Administrators cannot provide the relief these businesses need - however, it may be possible to do so through dummy organisations and funnel some money into the pockets of businessmen. The Lobby would appreciate this bailout and promises significant support to our cause, even if such a move would be very financially costly."
 KRBAT.21.a: "Of course, your loyalty will be rewarded."
 KRBAT.21.b: "That's not relief, that's a bribe!"

 KRBAT.22.t: "Businesses Ask To Bankrupt Latvian Company"
 KRBAT.22.d: "The businesses, large or small, owned by Baltic Germans in cities such as Riga and Reval hold considerable influence, both economic and political. The lobby of middle and upper class Baltic German city-dwellers, who have nothing to show for noble blood and instead carve out a path to power through wealth, are an ally of the Democratic Party thanks to our mutual opposition to the Four Knighthoods. Despite that, however, their interest first and foremost is safeguarding the interest of business, which we have to pay attention to.\n\nIn a smoke-filled room, representatives from the Business Lobby present a rather simple request to us. During the past two decades, the Latvian and Estonian classes in cities such as Riga and Reval have been taking up on their own economic activity. Small and middling businesses are started by the locals every year, presenting a challenge to Baltic German economic domination. One of these is Vairogs, founded by the Latvian businessman Pauls Barons, a car and truck producer in Riga for civilian and military needs. The Business Lobby requests the green light to choke this competitor out of the market and drive it to bankruptcy, and promises significant financial and political support in exchange."
 KRBAT.22.a: "Nothing wrong with that, throw them to the wolves."
 KRBAT.22.b: "Hold on, this company might be useful..."

 KRBAT.23.t: "Coalition Asks To Unseat Conservatives"
 KRBAT.23.d: "After the appointment of von Samson-Himmelstjerna as the new Chairman of the Convent of Land Administrators, Paul Schiemann dutifully forged a mighty liberal - social democratic coalition composed of the Democratic Party, Progressive Party and the Democratic Bloc. Black Monday and the political battles which followed it have shaken the stability of this coalition, however. The idealistic hopes of the Liberal Lobby need to be appeased as well, if we want to gather the necessary majority in the Landtag.\n\nIn a smoke-filled room, representatives from the Liberal Lobby present a rather simple request to us. While the Landtag in Riga may have a plurality of seats held by liberal representatives, this is not the case in provincial Landtags and Landratskollegiums, which are, more often than not, controlled by conservative nobility. Any plan to reform the Duchy will require the coalition to go through these conservatives - and the Liberal Lobby wants us to remove some of the most prolific conservative Land Administrators in the Duchy's Cantons, even if it will leave the conservatives distrusting of us."

 KRBAT.24.t: "Coalition Endorses Samson-Himmelstjerna"
 KRBAT.24.d: "After the appointment of von Samson-Himmelstjerna as the new Chairman of the Convent of Land Administrators, Paul Schiemann dutifully forged a mighty liberal - social democratic coalition composed of the Democratic Party, Progressive Party and the Democratic Bloc. Black Monday and the political battles which followed it have shaken the stability of this coalition, however. The idealistic hopes of the Liberal Lobby need to be appeased as well, if we want to gather the necessary majority in the Landtag.\n\nIn a smoke-filled room, representatives from the Liberal Lobby inform us that there is no need for appeasement. They are all in the same boat, after all, and even if some of them may disagree with the government's policy, they would much rather endorse von Samson-Himmelstjerna than von Ungern-Sternberg. Our representatives leave the meeting with good news and more political capital assured."
 KRBAT.24.a: "Your loyalty will be rewarded, friends."

 KRBAT.25.t: "Coalition Demands Chair Denounce Knights"

Black Monday and the political battles which followed it have shaken the stability of this coalition, however. The idealistic hopes of the Liberal Lobby need to be appeased as well, if we want to gather the necessary majority in the Landtag.\n\nIn a smoke-filled room, representatives from the Liberal Lobby present a rather simple request to us. Dualism and the political battles which have followed are a difficult period, there is no mistake about it - but to the liberals, the greatest fear is that the need for compromise will lead to their progressive ideals being diluted. What they request is assurances that the government will not sell themselves out to the reactionary Knighthoods, and continue to tread a progressive path."
 KRBAT.25.a: "We were never planning to do that anyway."
 KRBAT.25.b: "Hold that thought, we might find allies among the Knights."

 KRBAT.26.t: "Knighthood Seeks to Blackmail Democratic Bloc"
 KRBAT.26.d: "The Baltic Knighthoods are corporations of the Baltic nobility, divided between the four historical provinces of Baltic German lands. Counting seven hundred years of tradition and deeply concerned with maintaining these traditions, they are the most paramount force of conservatism in the Duchy, and only the Christian extremist and pan-Germanic Baltic Brotherhood may be considered more reactionary. Despite this, however, the Knights and Knight-Captains of the Four Knighthoods are pragmatic people, willing to consider a compromise even with the liberals they are deeply disgusted of.\n\nIn a smoke-filled room, representatives from the Baltic Knighthoods present a rather simple request to us. Throughout the last decade, the resurgent Democratic Bloc has slowly been making gains in provincial elections, controlling several parish assemblies and even sending more than a handful of representatives to the Cantonal Landtags. This rise of Latvian and Estonian nationalism is deeply concerning to the nobility, but they have a solution. Thanks to their extensive webs of contracts, they will be able to dig up dirt on Latvian and Estonian representatives, and all we need to do is 'dutifully' force them to resign. In exchange for this stab to the back of the Bloc, the Knighthoods promise support in the Landtag."

It is no secret that one of the goals of the Democratic Party is to promulgate a constitution for the Duchy in order to transform it into a modern pluralistic federation, and the Knighthoods have opposed this project since its inception, declaring it a violation of the traditions they are supposed to protect. However, they might consider turning their eyes to the other side, should we safeguard the existence of the Baltic Knighthoods in our constitutional project, instead of attempting to abolish them."

For centuries, the Baltic Knighthoods have operated their own education, in the form of Knight Academies, most notably the ones in Riga and Reval, which teach young cadets of the Knighthoods in preparation to be inducted in statesmanship. These academies are not regulated by the government and operate their own curriculums, and one of the promises of the Democratic Party is to integrate them into the Duchy's education system. The Knighthoods wish that we shove this promise under the rug and enshrine the right of the nobility to autonomous education hereforth."
 KRBAT.28.a: "Of course, it was just a promise..."

 KRBAT.29.t: "Livland in Flames"
 KRBAT.29.d1: "One of the most defining features of the United Baltic Duchy since its beginning was its relationship with the overwhelming Latvian and Estonian majority. In 1918, the Baltic Germans sought to present the Duchy as an all-Baltic entity and even coopted several Latvians and Estonians into Pilar von Pilchau's Regency Council, this illusion rapidly collapsed during the following Latvian and Estonian Wars of Independence. Though suppressed by the Baltische Landeswehr, the Latvians and Estonians did not give up hope of achieving independence - their organisations in exile in Sweden, Russia and the Internationale continued to push for freedom, even through violent struggle.\n\nThe paralysis of the central government has finally given the Balts impetus to act. Livland has suffered the brunt of the developing rebellion, the Land Administrators there report that they cannot control the countryside, as the law enforcement agencies have been overrun by ad hoc partisan organisations and underground resistance groups. They have been joined by defectors from the Landeswehr and armed exiles crossing the Russian border, who have bolstered the ranks of the partisans with weapons, ammunition and expertise. Supported by many local farmers, they are known as the Forest Brothers, carrying a Robin Hood-like aura around their actions.\n\nThe government must act immediately, before this rebellion becomes uncontrollable..."

 KRBAT.30.t: "Expansion of the Vidzeme Base Government"
 KRBAT.30.d: "The past one and a half months have been marked by constant guerrilla warfare across the Livland Region. The Baltische Landeswehr has been completely unable to maintain order in the east, however. The support of the people is not on their side, and with each Latvian or Estonian rebel caught and executed, five more leave their homesteads to join the fight in the forests. And now, many in the Curonian and Estonian regions have joined the fight as well.\n\nThroughout this time, the Latvian and Estonian partisans have been organising. The Latvian underground resistance movement and its network of secret cells organises under the command of General Jānis Kurelis and the Association of the Latvian National Guard, whereas the Estonian equivalent is the Armed Fighting Union, headed by Paul-August Lilleleht, but nominally loyal to the Estonian government-in-exile in Stockholm, led by Artur Sirk. These two Forest Brother governments, cooperating with each other, occupy several parishes in eastern Livland and run them with practically no opposition, gaining the informal name of 'Vidzeme Base Government'.\n\nA vast guerrilla conflict is upon us."
 KRBAT.30.a: "Mobilise everything we have!"

 KRBAT.31.t: "Decay of Order"
 KRBAT.31.d: "The situation in the Duchy has become completely untenable. Mass desertions of Latvian and Estonian soldiers from the Landeswehr have reduced our defence forces to a minimum, and no matter how trained and well equipped our troops are, they simply have not been able to stave off the guerrilla onslaught. Our forces have been routed, dispersed and their men have either fled or surrendered. The provincial Landtags have dissolved and their deputies from the Democratic Bloc, collaborating with the Forest Brothers have begun to organise Provincial Land Councils, much like they had done in 1917. These Land Councils have effectively wrested control from the Baltic German administration and claim sovereignty over their respective regions.\n\nThe Provincial Council of Vidzeme, gathered in Valmiera, has declared the independence of the Republic of Latvia and elected a provisional government to head the liberated provinces for the time being. Their equivalent in Reval, on the other hand, has announced the restoration of Estonia, claiming that its act of independence in 1918 never ceased to be valid, and invited the government-in-exile in Stockholm back home.\n\nThe last holdout of Baltic German birthright stands in Riga. Helmuth Stegman, the longtime chairman of the Riga City Council, established a relatively democratic and pluralistic government in his city with reforms throughout the 1930s, and his efforts have yielded fruit - Riga stands as an island of stability, largely free of Forest Brother uprisings. This stability has allowed the German Empire to send a battalion to the city and help establish order against likely Latvian incursions. Thousands of Baltic Germans flee to Riga, which now claims continuity to the corpse of the United Baltic Duchy..."

 KRBAT.32.t: "The Curonian Lobby"
 KRBAT.32.d: "While the four main lobbies in the Baltic Landtag may be the largest, they are not the only ones, and share space with numerous smaller others, which campaign for their own interests, sometimes vast, sometimes minute. One of such lobbies controls a small, yet noticeable fraction of the Curonian delegation to the Landtag.\n\nCuronia has historically been a special case among Baltic German territories, its history is unique and one of a somewhat independent duchy ruled by the House of Biron when the rest of the Baltics were ruled by foreign powers. Before the United Baltic Duchy was even founded, the Curonian Landtag declared the independence of Courland-Semigallia in personal union with Germany, and though this ephemeral state never established itself, the ducal title of Courland-Semigallia remains enshrined in the historical heritage of Courland.\n\nThis Curonian Lobby campaigns for increased Curonian autonomy and respect for Courland's historical tradition, and now, they turn to us. We can grant the House of Biron a state pension and promise respect for Courland's right to autonomy, in exchange for their support in the Landtag."

 KRBAT.33.t: "Mārtiņš Peniķis"
 KRBAT.33.d: "A lone representative in the Landtag from Courland, Mārtiņš Peniķis, is a lobby of his own - this elderly, retired former commander in the Imperial Russian Army is the most prominent of the so-called Curonian Kings. They are the descendants of the Curonian nobility which ruled this region before the arrival of the Baltic Germans, they bear their own coats of arms and consider themselves noble, despite living no better than peasants and being very few in number. Throughout history, the Curonian Knighthood recognised them as a class above the ordinary Latvian peasantry, and yet, their rights and powers were eventually eroded by time.\n\nPeniķis, representing the 600 or so remaining Curonian Kings, requests for the noble status of his people to be recognised, and in exchange, he pledges to support the Baltic-German Democratic Party in the Landtag."
 KRBAT.33.a: "... uh, sure."
 KRBAT.33.b: "Who are you?"

 KRBAT.34.t: "A Question of Inheritance"
 KRBAT.34.d: "The Duke of the United Baltic Duchy, Adolf Friedrich zu Mecklenburg, is nearing seventy years of age. Though he remains as sharp as ever and his physically fit condition means that he is likely to live for at least one more decade, the question of who shall succeed him is starting to ring across the halls. Adolf Friedrich only has one child - a daughter, Princess Woizlawa Feodora, who has recently married into the House of Reuss. A lack of male heirs means that the succession is murky, as no laws establishing female royal succession have been passed.\n\nThe Duke and many of his courtiers eye towards Duke Christian Ludwig zu Mecklenburg, Adolf Friedrich's nephew and the second son of Frederick Francis IV, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. A cadet in the Imperial German army, he carries enough charm with his persona to be seen as a fine Duke in the making - and he's expressed interest to take the throne of the Baltics should he be needed. Alternatively, Duke Adolf Friedrich can just ignore Salic law and request the promulgation of a law allowing female succession in the United Baltic Duchy."
 KRBAT.34.a: "Duke Christian Ludwig is the heir!"
 KRBAT.34.b: "Allow Woizlawa Feodora to inherit the throne"

 KRBAT.35.t: "Isolation"
 KRBAT.35.d: "The last months have been a rather eye opening experience to Adolf Friedrich and his daughter. To imagine that there was such a sprawling secret society underneath the rooftops and streets of Riga, tucked away from the public eye in homes and mansions, yet so complex, ritualistic, and so all-controlling, would have never crossed his mind. He had heard of the Baltic Brotherhood before, but could have never imagined it to be this much of a cancer upon the Duchy.\n\nAt least it was a cancer which could afford him a rather well off life as a prisoner. The Duke never starved nor died of thirst, and even received visitors from the Brotherhood sometimes. And yet...\n\n\"You're not going to get away with this.\"\n\nThe Führender Bruder, Otto von Kursell, was left unfazed by the Duke's venomous words, however. \"And yet, even though your presence here is an open secret at this point, nobody resists. I've already gotten away with a lot, and what says I can't continue?\"\n\n\"Graf Goltz will stop you, eventually. He is a loyal monarchist, not... whatever your people are. He will witness the horrors you pursue and put you down.\"\n\n\"Goltz is a senile buffoon. Stuck in a world which has already passed away, pursuing glory which modernity will never provide. He is a fine commander and an excellent figurehead, but a cunning leader he is not. He needs glorious parades, a patriotic vocabulary, and a few assurances, and he will watch the National Revival content.\"\n\nKursell arose from his seat, allowing the former Duke to retreat to his thoughts. \"You're not here because I, or the Inner Circle, hate you - but only because you are not like Graf Goltz.\"."
 KRBAT.35.a: "The National Revival has no compromise."

 KRBAT.36.t: "A Protocol of 1919"
 KRBAT.36.d1: "The newspaper Riga am Sonntag has republished a document from 1919, the so-called 'Protocol of 1919', to the uproar of many of its readers. The Protocol of 1919 is an anti-semitic text supposedly found in the pocket of a dead Bolshevik soldier during the Russian Civil War. It is a barely coherent fabricated 'report' which gloats over reducing the Russian people to slaves, declares that the revolutions in Russia and France were instigated by a so-called 'International Israelite League', and that it should be used to buy up gold and government bonds across the world in order to build power and influence. Published during the Estonian War of Independence, it has since been picked up by anti-semites and even added as an addendum to later releases of the 'Protocols of the Elders of Zion'.\n\nThe Baltic Brotherhood has released a statement endorsing this decision by the Riga am Sonntag, however, using this as a chance to denounce so-called 'international Jewish conspiracies' and approve the publication of more anti-Semitic material in the following months."

Paul Schiemann's Rigasche Rundschau responded to the publication as well, analysing the Protocol in detail and shedding light upon the nonsensical claims stated there."
 KRBAT.36.a: "I see..."

 KRBAT.37.t: "Passing of the Führer"
 KRBAT.37.d: "Graf Rüdiger von der Goltz, the Regent of the Baltic State for the last ten years, has passed away at the age of 80 today. The entire nation is in mourning - the elderly and noble general, having seized control of the nation with the help of the Baltische Landeswehr and the Baltic Brotherhood, saved it from the clutches of collapse and has helped lead it to a new era. For these achievements, he has even received the honorary title Führer, \"Leader\", in reference to his persona, much like many other right wing nationalist regimes which the Baltic State has emulated.\n\nThough he was a famed leader in trying times, von der Goltz did not consolidate power around a loyal clique nor did he manage to win the political battles taking place in the shadows of the government. During his reign, the power of the Baltic Brotherhood continued to rise without anything to halt them, and now that Goltz has passed, the only remaining roadblock to their absolute rule has vanished as well. The Landeswehr is ideologically charged and loyal, Baltic society transformed according to their ideals, and its politics orchestrated according to their whim. It is no surprise that Otto von Kursell and the Brotherhood have seized the apparatus of the state in the aftermath."
 KRBAT.37.a: "The National Revival is complete."

 KRBAT.38.t: "Flight of the Baltic Germans"
 KRBAT.38.d: "Under pressure from Latvian and Estonian insurgents, the United Baltic Duchy has capitulated and the Baltic region has fallen to chaos. While many of the Baltic Germans make their way to Riga, others have chosen to head straight to Germany. Many of them are fearing for their lives and have little belongings with them, and these refugees have flooded our ports in the Baltic Sea.\n\nAmong them are numerous soldiers and officers of the Baltische Landeswehr, including several generals, who now offer their services to the Imperial German Army. There is no doubting their loyalty to the German Empire nor their skill in military matters - the Landeswehr was known as one of the most elite forces in the Reichspakt for a good reason."
 KRBAT.38.a: "Welcome!"
 KRBAT.38.b: "We do not need their help."

 KRBAT.39.t: "Flight of the Baltic Germans"
 KRBAT.39.d: "Baltic Germans living across our soil are fleeing our regime en masse. Fearing for their lives or for their property, nobles, businessmen, intellectuals, and even the common German peoples are fleeing to the City of Riga and the German Empire, where they hope to escape our clutches and find a better life. Though they take their skills and education with them, we can only wave them on and let their cramped ships pass."
 KRBAT.39.a: "We don't need them here."

 KRBAT.40.t: "Societal Transformation Begins"
 KRBAT.40.d: "Now that the last of the regime's armed opponents hang in droves, the Baltic Brotherhood, controlling the new government from the shadows, is able to implement their transformative policies in their entirety. Their goals rest on several pillars, all leading towards the same purpose - the complete subjugation of the Baltic German nation to a greater, revelationary ideal, and the complete mobilisation of the economy in the name of a grand crusade towards the East. Throughout the following years, all vestiges of capitalism - which the Brotherhood does not hide their hate towards, calling it 'Anglo-Saxonic soul theft' - will have to be destroyed and a hierarchic, orderly, state-controlled system built in its place. The average citizens will have to be groomed and reshaped to become model Christians, they once again need to be imbued with the Teutonic spirit which courses through their veins.\n\nThe Baltische Landeswehr, which helped the Brotherhood come into power, has no issue with these transformative reforms - after all, their interests will be satiated, and quite a few of them actually sympathise with this extreme, nigh-esoteric nationalism... Many will die in this corpse-strewn way towards National Revival. Many others will suffer. But that is a sacrifice which Otto von Kursell was willing to make."
 KRBAT.40.a: "Let the music play!"

 KRBAT.41.t: "Victory!"
 KRBAT.41.d: "The Forest Brother threat in the Baltic region has been completely quenched. Having lost their last holdouts, their forces scattered and some of their main leaders killed in the crossfire, the partisans have either moved into low-scale underground resistance or stood down entirely - which, either way, makes the movement no longer threatening to our stability. Latvian and Estonian exiles who crossed the Russian border to join the resistance now desperately flee right back, claiming that they will continue clinging onto their foolish cause no matter what, but their voice no longer matters. The Duchy is safe."
 KRBAT.41.a: "And may it last a thousand years!"

 KRBAT.42.t: "Schiemann vs Pussull"
 KRBAT.42.d: "A debate has broken out in the halls of the Landtag - the elderly leader of the Democratic Party has been challenged by Woldemar Pussull, leading member of the right-wing Volkspartei. Pussull ascribes himself to the ideological thought of Baron Wilhelm von Fircks, a famous titan of Baltic German politics who was Schiemann's main adversary until his passing in 1933. The debate soon turned towards the fundamentals of Baltic German politics and the ideological goals of both parties.\n\nBoth Pussull and Schiemann agree that the Baltic Germans are a positive presence in the Baltic States and are more worthy of ruling it than the Latvians and Estonians. However, Pussull claims that this is proof of their special position in society, one which should be inherent and should remain in the future. Schiemann disagrees, however, stating that while the Baltic Germans inherit the liberal foundations of Germanic culture, there is nothing which prevents Latvians and Estonians from becoming similarly enlightened through education, merit, and the absorption of Baltic German culture. To him, Baltic Germans carry a burden of passing their civilisation on to the Latvian and Estonian peoples. Pussull calls Schiemann out as a hypocrite, however - if the way for Latvians and Estonians to become civilised is through becoming closer to Baltic Germans, then does that not make pure Baltic Germans special?\n\nIt falls to the Landtag members watching the debate to draw their conclusions - and the majority decide that..."
 KRBAT.42.a: "Schiemann's arguments are stronger."
 KRBAT.42.b: "Pussull makes a good point."

 KRBAT.43.t: "The Forest Brothers are losing steam"
 KRBAT.43.d: "A year has passed since the beginning of the Forest Brothers rebellion and the goals of the Latvian and Estonian rebels have not yet been achieved. Though fighting continues on, they have bled a lot of their strength and lost many of their strongest fighters. The attrition is starting to take a toll on their fighting capacity and partisan raids are becoming less frequent.\n\nIt seems that we have endured the first wave, and should we press on, we may be able to outlast these rebels."
 KRBAT.43.a: "Do not rest until the Duchy is secure!"

 KRBAT.44.t: "Otto von Kursell Consolidates the Brotherhood"
 KRBAT.44.d: "The Baltic Brotherhood had been shaken by inter-brother ideological struggles for the longest part of 1935, but with the onset of a new year, this conflict has seemingly come to an end. Information about the true inner workings of this secretive, Christian fundamentalist and pan-German nationalist order are few and far between, but throughout the year, the so-called 'outer ring' of the Brotherhood, which maintains some contact with the outside world, has seen many members relieved for \"having violated the principles of the Brotherhood\". Similar lay-offs have taken place in the even more secretive 'inner ring'.\n\nBrothers previously believed to be calling the shots in the direction of the Brotherhood, such as Harald von Rautenfeld and Eduard von Dellingshausen, have completely lost their influence in its ideology and actions. In their expense, Otto von Kursell has consolidated his absolute rule over the Brotherhood. Having held the position of Leading Brother (Führender Bruder) since 1928, von Kursell was initially seen as a compromise figurehead and a competent administrator who drafted the statute of the Brotherhood, but has shown to be increasingly controlling and ideological over the years.\n\nWithin the Brotherhood, he stands as the leading advocate of the Ostbewegung faction, a faction of pan-Germanic and Christian fundamentalist bent. It sees itself and all Baltic Germans as the messianic spiritual guide of the Germanic peoples who will lead a militant missionary mission to the Orient, as loyal subservients of a new Germany."
 KRBAT.44.a: "This does not bode well..."
 KRBAT.44.b: "What is the Baltic Brotherhood?"

 KRBAT.45.t: "The Baltic Brotherhood"
 KRBAT.45.d: "The harsh years of the post-Weltkrieg period left many youthful Baltic German nobles disillusioned. The United Baltic Duchy turned out to be a smouldering dumpster fire, its antiquated traditions completely unfit for the modern day and the particularism of their leaders turning pan-German unity into a distant dream. The world itself began to turn upside down - Bolshevism, Syndicalism and Latvian/Estonian nationalism all rose to shake their old way of life. Faced with all of this, many of them turned towards the Lutheran faith, their religious beliefs, joined by an unyielding anti-syndicalism and pan-Germanic nationalism, developed towards extremism. The Baltic Brotherhood was founded in 1928, by some of the most prominent members of the younger Baltic German generation, including Harald von Rautenfeld, Sylvester von Ropp, Georg and Hans von Manteuffel-Szoeges, and Otto von Kursell.\n\nThe Baltic Brotherhood was founded as a secret Christian fundamentalist and pan-German order, and remains such to this day. It is organised in Brotherly Rings, which operate in every major town of the Duchy and exist as a place for religious worship, common labour, and philosophical thought. The Brotherhood operates with a defined statute and a set of mandatory principles, including flawless trustworthiness, obedience to one's elder Brother, and chastity, among others. All members of the Brotherhood are divided into the Outer Ring, or Ring of Preparation and the Inner Ring. Advancing from the former to the latter is a considerable feat.\n\nThe Baltic Brotherhood is absolutely not a mass movement, but it maintains a great amount of influence within the government. Many of its members are high ranking members of the Knighthoods and representatives in the Landtag, of course, keeping their allegiance a secret. Among the Baltische Landeswehr, the Brotherhood's most ardent supporter is Hans von Manteuffel-Szoege, a member of its Inner Ring."
 KRBAT.45.a: "I see..."

 KRBAT.46.t: "Paul Schiemann"
 KRBAT.46.d: "Carl Christian Theodor Paul Schiemann was born in 1876 in Mitau in Courland, then part of the Russian Empire. While not a noble himself, he came from a wealthy middle class Baltic German family, and was thus able to obtain a fulfilling education in Germany as well as officer military service in the Imperial Russian Army. Even before the Weltkrieg, he gained the notoriety of a bleeding-heart liberal, engaged in constant polemics with conservative Baltic German society, even ending up briefly expelled from Riga by the Livonian Knighthood in 1917. Upon returning to his homeland a year later, he founded the DbDP alongside Friedrich von Samson-Himmelstjerna to push for his vision of a liberal Baltic Federation.\n\nSchiemann is a committed liberal democrat, opposed to conservative nationalism and Syndicalism - the former for standing against everything liberalism fights for, and the latter for being an abnormal deformity of liberty, which denies individual personality in favour of uncultured mediocrity of the masses. His definition of liberalism is different from the West, however. Schiemann believes in abolition of privileges and the strength of individual merit, but not in universal political equality - to him, it is ridiculous to imagine a cleaning maid with the same political rights as a university professor. His political vision is corporatist and more akin to meritocracy than democracy - although, as he concludes, liberal democracy is a good method of finding 'the best men'. To him, it is the cultural mission of the Baltic Germans to teach these liberal ideas to the Latvian and Estonian masses.\n\nSchiemann's other major contribution is the concept of an anational state. Borrowing heavily from Austromarxism, Schiemann interprets ethnicity as a 'spiritual community', much like religion, and posits that nationalism must be separated from the state in the same way religion is - instead, all ethnic groups within a country must exist as voluntary communities defending the interests of their members. This anational statehood forms the basis of his Baltic Federation project."

 KRBAT.47.t: "The Caucus of Reaction: Sternberg and Pilchau"
 KRBAT.47.d: "Two members of some of the most powerful families of the Baltic nobility, holding different positions and telling different backstories, stand united to defeat Schiemann and restore what they believe to be the righteous path of tradition.\n\nBorn in 1880, Baron Rolf Edvard Clemens von Ungern-Sternberg, a native of the city of Reval, hails from a branch of the famous noble house of von Ungern-Sternberg. Educated as a road construction engineer, he became a diplomat for the Imperial Russian diplomatic service, and spent twenty years of his life travelling across the planet as an envoy for two monarchies, first Russian and the Baltic - these travels saw him walk the streets of Constantinople, Paris, Lisbon and even Nagasaki, where he spent almost half a decade of his life. After visiting his distant cousin in Mongolia, a turn of events which the House of Ungern-Sternberg still finds hard to come to terms with, Rolf returned to his homeland, those two decades leaving him a changed man. The Baron has the stature and wit of an erudite, knows several languages and spends his free time writing poetry - but all of his experiences in the world only strengthened his belief that the traditions of the Baltic German peoples are exemplary and must be defended against liberal encroachment.\n\nBorn in 1885, Baron Adolf Constantin Theodor Pilar von Pilchau is the son of Adolf Pilar von Pilchau, the founding father of the Baltic Duchy, its first and longest lasting head of government. It is a fact which von Pilchau always mentions, it is the fact which propelled him to a political career in the Livonian Knighthood, and it is the fact which has built him into an arrogant, self-assured snob. Out of all the leaders of the Four Knighthoods, he is least afraid to use his power, assured that it cannot backfire against him and that the cause he fights for is right. Having supported his father's decision to banish Paul Schiemann in 1917, Pilchau sports a rivalry with him to this day."

 KRBAT.48.t: "An Armistice of National Unity?"
 KRBAT.48.d: "News of the Forest Brothers uprising in Livland caught the Landtag of the United Baltic Duchy completely unprepared, and its lack of action may be considered to be one of the reasons why this uprising broke out in the first place. The divided Landtag is being pressured by outside forces to act - the Landeswehr demands national unity in the face of crisis, and the Duke has stepped out ordering his government to seek a rapprochement with the right-wing opposition.\n\nThe leader of the Livonian Knighthood, Adolf Constantin Pilar von Pilchau, made his move first, reaching out to Chairman von Samson-Himmelstjerna directly and offering a deal he could not refuse. For the following two months, the Landtag will work together to pass laws necessary to restore order in the Duchy, and in exchange, both sides will forgo building up coalitions and alliances to take the other down for that time. Paul Schiemann demands his peers to seek no compromise, however - according to him, Pilchau and Sternberg will take advantage of the peace to scheme behind their backs and try to take down the government. And perhaps there is a reason to fear this, as Pilchau is definitely not the type of person to put country over party...\n\nOn the other hand, refusing the armistice and continuing the political brawl in the midst of a guerrilla war will not bode well for our nation's stability, nor will forces outside of the Landtag approve. Will von Samson-Himmelstjerna violate Schiemann's orders or will he put party above country?"
 KRBAT.48.a: "The Forest Brothers are the greater threat."
 KRBAT.48.b: "Pilchau and Sternberg are the greater threat."

 KRBAT.49.t: "Armistice of National Unity Concludes"
 KRBAT.49.d: "After two months, the armistice of national unity has concluded and the battle in the Landtag returns to normal. Our worst fears have turned out true - while we were focused on suppressing the Forest Brothers movement, Land Marshal von Ungern-Sternberg and Knight-Captain Pilar von Pilchau have been working hard to undo everything we've worked for! The alliances we once made have been rendered null and void, our support among the Landtag's lobbies dips to a new low point. We will need to find new support should we wish to rebuild."
 KRBAT.49.a: "Damn it!"

 KRBAT.50.t: "The Goltz Conspiracy"
 KRBAT.50.d: "The Baltische Landeswehr had been betting on an armistice of national unity ever since the beginning of the Forest Brothers conflict, but with the conflict escalating while the political battle in the Landtag continues, they have had to move onto alternate considerations. Unique between all countries in Europe, the Baltic Landeswehr is completely independent from the civilian government aside for a largely powerless Military Commission in the Land Administration - in fact, this arrangement was born out of a necessity, for the military could not afford to wait for orders from an incompetent, ancient government system. In this critical moment, this independence meant that the Landeswehr has turned into an enemy, not an ally, of the administration in Riga.\n\nThis anti-civilian authority fever has reached the supreme commander of the Landeswehr, Rüdiger von der Goltz, as well, and a salvation soon approached him in the form of the Baltic Brotherhood. Otto von Kursell's clandestine religious nationalist order spectated the events in the Landtag from the shadows and came to the same conclusion as the arch-conservative commander - that this decadent and self-destructive conflict needs to go. The Landtag, the Knighthoods, and the Duke who turns a blind eye to the chaos, all need to go - and to this end, von der Goltz and von Kursell have reached a secret agreement which will come into effect in the following days."
 KRBAT.50.a: "I see..."
 KRBAT.50.b: "Who is General von der Goltz?"

 KRBAT.51.t: "Manteuffel's Coup"
 KRBAT.51.d: "The nitty gritty organisation of the Landeswehr-Brotherhood coup d'etat fell onto the shoulders of Hans von Manteuffel-Szoege, a respected commander in the Landeswehr and a loyal member of the Brotherhood's inner circle. Rumours were spread of a Latvian militant uprising in Riga which the Landeswehr acted upon and sent designated units into the city - these units promptly disarmed the local garrison, seized control of all communications and surrounded the Landtag. One hundred and fifty members of the legislature and all members of the Convent of Land Administrators were left besieged, learning through secret channels that offices of the Four Baltic Knighthoods are being raided, martial law is being enacted across the country, and local civilian authorities are surrendering to military pressure. The whereabouts of Duke Adolf Friedrich are unknown.\n\nA few hours later, General von Manteuffel-Szoege presented his demands to the besieged Landtag - the dissolution of the legislature and the Convent of Land Administrators, to be replaced by a 'faithful and respected government', headed by Rüdiger von der Goltz as emergency Regent and Otto von Kursell as the new Chairman of the Convent. Fearing further repercussions, the majority of the Landtag voted to surrender, despite the resistance by members of the Riga Democratic Bloc, who have since been arrested for disturbing public order."
 KRBAT.51.a: "For God and Vaterland!"

 KRBAT.52.t: "The Redoubt Question"
 KRBAT.52.d: "Two approaches to the redoubt question have formed within the Baltische Landeswehr.\n\nOne faction believes that the approach to a potential breakthrough in the Ostwall should be simple - the Duna River and the urban landscape of the city of Riga offer a defence which can be made impenetrable with enough fortifications. This would also keep the Baltic holdout in touch with the rest of the front and thus leave them open to reinforcements from the south.\n\nAnother faction has a different view of a possible Russian-Reichspakt War. Because of our fortifications on the eastern border, it is likely that the Russians will avoid a direct assault against them and instead strike southwards, through White Ruthenia and Lithuania, which these officers see as the weakest link. In such a situation, the Duchy will be isolated from the rest of the Reichspakt, and thus should hole up in cities such as Riga and Reval, where they can receive German support through the sea and hold up the Russians while the Empire's forces do battle in the south.\n\nWhich approach has more merit?"
 KRBAT.52.a: "We must delay our enemies in the cities"
 KRBAT.52.b: "We must retreat behind the Duna"

 KRBAT.53.t: "Rüdiger von der Goltz"
 KRBAT.53.d: "The Graf von der Goltz is the most powerful a non-Baltic German has ever managed to become in the United Baltic Duchy, arguably even greater than Duke Adolf Friedrich himself. A descendant of a honoured Prussian noble family with a history of military officers, von der Goltz had a long and bountiful career in the Imperial German Army even before the Weltkrieg, during which he was a division commander respected on the Western and Eastern Fronts alike. In 1918, he became the General Staff's primary asset in relations with its Eastern regions - early that year, he was sent to Finland as a representative of the German forces and promptly took control of the state as a dictator. When that became untenable, he was reassigned to the Baltic duchy, where he laid down the foundations for the Baltische Landeswehr. The army of the Duchy owes everything to von der Goltz, and he knows that.\n\nAn aristocrat by blood and personality, the Graf has little patience for democracy and the squabbling liberals in the Landtag. While many of his fellow German veterans who helped found the Baltische Landeswehr ultimately returned to Germany, von der Goltz stayed, knowing that not only will the Duchy require his services yet again, but that he will be able to take advantage of the situation and finally rise beyond a mere chief of staff of the Landeswehr. And it appears his wishes have finally been fulfilled."
 KRBAT.53.a: "I see..."

 KRBAT.54.t: "The Constitutional Convention"
 KRBAT.54.d2: "One of the key promises raised by Paul Schiemann and the Baltic German Democratic Party is the draft and proliferation of a modern constitution for the United Baltic Duchy, one which shall sweep away the antiquated structure of the country for good. After years of hard labour and piecemeal reforms, it appears the rest of the nation has been convinced to follow suit.\n\nThree hundred delegates have gathered in the House of the Livonian Knighthood in Riga to form the Constitutional Convention of the United Baltic Duchy. Each Canton delegated twenty representatives, ten were delegated by the burghers of the city of Riga, one hundred have been elected by all male citizens of the Duchy by partisan lists, and seventy have been delegated by pressure groups such as the Four Baltic Knighthoods, land-owning nobility and ethnic minorities. Duke Adolf Friedrich and his family have chosen to personally attend the Convention, and Schiemann invited numerous legal experts from Germany to act as advisors to the delegates.\n\nA new chapter in Baltic history is about to unfold."
 KRBAT.54.d1: "One of the key promises raised by the Riga City Council and its republican government is the draft and proliferation of a modern constitution for the Baltic Federation, one which shall sweep away the antiquated structure of the country for good. After years of hard labour and piecemeal reforms, it appears the rest of the nation has been convinced to follow suit.\n\nThree hundred delegates have gathered in the former House of the Livonian Knighthood in Riga to form the Constitutional Convention of the Baltic Federation. All three hundred of the representatives have been elected by all male citizens of the Duchy by partisan lists, with no distinction between former nobles and commoners. The former Duke, Adolf Friedrich and his family have chosen to personally attend the Convention, and [Root.GetLeader] invited numerous legal experts from Germany to act as advisors to the delegates.\n\nA new chapter in Baltic history is about to unfold."
 KRBAT.54.a: "Let us begin!"

 KRBAT.55.t: "The Preamble"
 KRBAT.55.d: "Before any articles of a constitution are listed, the Preamble stands, and it is the most important part of any Constitution. It does not define any concrete laws or regulations, but instead sets the goals of the Constitution and for what purpose it has been drafted. In essence, it sets the tone for the rest of the document, one which no article can violate.\n\nThere are several prevailing notions on what the theme of the preamble, and thus the rest of the Constitution, should be, down to the specific wording of each sentence."
 KRBAT.55.a: "'The Duke of the Baltic Peoples bestows the following Constitution...'"
 KRBAT.55.b: "'The People of the Baltic Provinces proclaim the following Constitution...'"
 KRBAT.55.c: "'The People of the Baltic Federation proclaim the following document...'"

 KRBAT.56.t: "Distribution of Power"
 KRBAT.56.d: "The semi-constitutional procedure of the United Baltic Duchy up to this point established it as a federal system, divided into several Cantons, or Kreise, which have their own legislatures and enjoy considerable powers in economic, social and judicial policy. Though ensuring the stability of the country and allowing greater local self-management to the Duchy, it also slows down governance to a crawl.\n\nThe Constitutional Convention is a better time than any to define the nature of the government's relations with its constituent provinces. What should the distribution of power in the country be, should a balance be maintained or should one of the two sides receive the upper hand?"
 KRBAT.56.a: "The Cantons should return their powers to the central government."
 KRBAT.56.b: "There needs to be a balance between central and local power."
 KRBAT.56.c: "The central government should surrender powers to local management."

 KRBAT.57.t: "Ethno-Linguistic Policy"
 KRBAT.57.d: "The United Baltic Duchy is a country inhabited by Baltic Germans as well as Latvians and Estonians, and up until this point, the former held privileges and powers which the latter was unable to enjoy. Questions such as the linguistic policy of the state, the rights enshrined in the Constitution and how universal they should be are being raised in the halls of the Convention. Paul Schiemann was quick to bring up his concept of an 'anational state', which does not discriminate by ethnicity and treats nationality as something beyond the affairs of the state. What should the Constitution say about the country's ethnic and linguistic policy, if anything?"
 KRBAT.57.a: "The country is founded upon German culture, first and foremost."
 KRBAT.57.b: "All inhabitants share the same fundamental rights and duties."
 KRBAT.57.c: "Implement Schiemann's anational state."
 KRBAT.57.e: "Linguistic policy is solely a Cantonal matter."

 KRBAT.58.t: "The Landtag"
 KRBAT.58.d: "Much like before the adoption of the Constitution, the Landtag is enshrined as the legislature of the country, which is responsible solely to the people and upholds the legislative duties in the country. The question arises, however, on what form this legislature should take. Should the Landtag be unicameral or bicameral, and if so, which of its houses should be elected or appointed by which method? Paul Schiemann once again offers his advice, and his proposal is to avoid the pitfalls of Western democracies and instead form a fully meritocratic legislature, appointed from universities and the civic society based on education, experience and merit. What form should the Landtag take?"
 KRBAT.58.a: "A bicameral legislature, an elected lower house and aristocratic upper house."
 KRBAT.58.b: "A bicameral legislature, an elected lower house and upper house appointed by the Duke."
 KRBAT.58.c: "A bicameral legislature, both houses elected directly."
 KRBAT.58.e: "A unicameral legislature composed of provincial appointees."
 KRBAT.58.f: "A bicameral legislature, an elected lower house and meritocratic upper house."
 KRBAT.58.g: "A unicameral legislature appointed by merit and experience."
 KRBAT.58.h: "A unicameral, universally elected legislature."

 KRBAT.59.t: "Lines of Accountability"
 KRBAT.59.d1: "The Constitution of the Baltic Federation shall abolish the office of Convent of Land Administrators and replace this antiquated entity with the positions of Chancellor, who heads a cabinet of ministers, and the President, who is elected by the Landtag as a head of state, and both of them serve as the executive of the country. The question, however, arises on the lines of accountability - that is, what should the relationship between the Chancellor, the Landtag and the President be according to the Constitution? The question of chancellor appointment is the most pressing one, and while it may appear trivial to worry over the specifics of who appoints who and who gives assent, they may and will end up critical down the line. The wording may grant greater power to one institution over the next, after all."
 KRBAT.59.d2: "The Constitution of the United Baltic Duchy shall abolish the office of Convent of Land Administrators and replace this antiquated entity with the position of Chancellor, who heads a cabinet of ministers and serves as the executive of the country.

The question of chancellor appointment is the most pressing one, and while it may appear trivial to worry over the specifics of who appoints who and who gives assent, they may and will end up critical down the line. The wording may grant greater power to one institution over the next, after all."
 KRBAT.59.a: "The Duke appoints a Chancellor with the advice of the Landtag."
 KRBAT.59.a2: "The President appoints a Chancellor with the advice of the Landtag."
 KRBAT.59.b: "The Landtag presents a Chancellor candidate which the Duke approves."
 KRBAT.59.b2: "The Landtag presents a Chancellor candidate which the President approves."
 KRBAT.59.c: "The Landtag elects a Chancellor on their own accord."

 KRBAT.60.t: "The Nobility"
 KRBAT.60.d1: "The United Baltic Duchy was a state founded upon the backs of the Baltic German nobility, and they are understandably concerned about the role which they will hold in our new state. The Baltic German Democratic Party are vehement in their opposition to any and all noble privileges remaining, and the liberal consensus agrees that the Baltic Knighthoods should have no role in government. The Knighthoods remain powerful in our country and the nobles certainly wish to keep their positions..."

Paul Schiemann and the Baltic German Democratic Party are vehement in their opposition to any and all noble privileges remaining, and the liberal consensus agrees that the Baltic Knighthoods should have no role in government. The Knighthoods remain powerful in our country and the nobles certainly wish to keep their positions..."
 KRBAT.60.a: "Noble titles and the Knighthoods should be abolished."
 KRBAT.60.b: "Noble titles and the Knighthoods should be enshrined in the Constitution."

 KRBAT.61.t: "Emergency Powers"
 KRBAT.61.d: "There comes a time when the safety of a country is threatened and a democracy faces issues either from within or outside its borders. There can come times of war, internal strife, civil conflict, or natural disaster, which will make ordinary democratic procedure untenable in managing the state. In situations like these, the government can call a state of emergency and suspend some of the liberties in its constitution in order to protect its citizens. Should these emergency powers be wide reaching to ensure safety, however, or handicapped as much as possible in order to prevent a dictatorship?"
 KRBAT.61.a: "The government should have the right to suspend liberty in the name of safety."
 KRBAT.61.b: "To sacrifice liberty in the name of safety would make us worthy of neither."

 KRBAT.62.t: "Constitutional Entrenchment"
 KRBAT.62.d: "It should be expected of a Constitution to receive changes down the line, when the societal norms change, the people create a better alternative to the system, or simply want to iron out mistakes which the original legislators missed. To give future generations a free hand at changing the Constitution runs the risk of it being amended into something unrecognisable, or, worse, a dictatorship. Should some of the articles be made fundamental, and thus unchangeable by any amendment procedure? How free should the procedure of constitutional amendment be?"
 KRBAT.62.a: "Amendment procedure must be handicapped and fundamental articles unchangeable."
 KRBAT.62.b: "The Landtag should be able to change the constitution freely."

 KRBAT.63.t: "The Constitution is promulgated!"
 KRBAT.63.d: "After over two months of deliberation, edits, and voting, the Constitution of the Baltic Federation has henceforth been promulgated! The original document of the Constitution was signed by all of representatives president in the Constitutional Convention, and copies were published in order to be distributed to all Cantons, the University of Riga, and, of course, the German Empire.\n\nAppearing before the Landtag despite his sickly condition, Paul Schiemann chose to read the Preamble before the legislators, citing the cause and purpose of the Constitution and the universal rights it seeks to enshrine, and departed from the podium with thunderous applause. For now, democracy is victorious."
 KRBAT.63.a: "Three Hurrahs for the Baltic Federation!"

 KRBAT.64.t: "The Wavering Dream"
 KRBAT.64.d: "The influx of refugees from Latvia and Estonia has put a severe strain upon the municipal government of Riga - and it already wasn't doing well before, what with Black Monday and an unruly Latvian population to deal with. These refugees were Baltic Germans, at least those who could afford to flee - nobles, politicians, administrators, wealthy entrepreneurs, soldiers and officers...\n\nBut a chance to escape to Riga's relative calm did not do much to relieve them. What's the point? It was a sentence which echoed often through the streets and halls of the city. They have lost their only, God-granted chance for a Baltic German state, a country they could call their own - and they lost it because of their own foolishness, infighting and stubbornness. Why couldn't they prevent this loss? Why couldn't they simply work together when the situation called for it?\n\nAnd what happens now?\n\nPerhaps the answer is that they carried the errors of the past with them like weights, and failed to remove them when the time was due. When they should have extended a hand to the Latvians and Estonians, the Baltic Germans left them in the mud, and so suffered the consequences. The Baltic German Democratic Party has always been strong in Riga, and with Paul Schiemann's full retirement, the burden of maintaining his liberal dream falls to the shoulders of Wilhelm Munter.\n\nPerhaps the answer is that they were weak, divided, and failed to unite at a moment when the life of the Duchy was on the line. Concentrated in the Pan-German League, Baltic German nationalists, revanchist nobles, and their allies among the German intervention forces plot to make sure this mistake does not get repeated again. The diplomat Max Erwin von Scheubner-Richter has returned from Germany to serve as the movement's leader.\n\nOf course, the incumbent Mayor, Helmuth Stegman, has a vision to call his own - if he can successfully manoeuvre through the coming months. Whether Riga sees him stay in charge or a new leader assume the role, they will have a difficult task ahead of them - to find a reason for Riga to exist."
 KRBAT.64.a: "In treuen fest?.."

 KRBAT.65.t: "Disorder in the Reval Ritterschule"
 KRBAT.65.d: "A small scandal has broken out in the Reval Ritterschule, an education institution dedicated to tutoring the children of the Baltic nobility. The school managers chose to hire a substitute teacher to fill out vacancies in their increasingly ageing administration, but soon came to regret their mistake. Said teacher, Alfred Rosenberg, a Baltic German native of Reval, was hired to teach history in this prestigious institution, but as it turned out, his curriculum was an incomprehensible mess about Aryan racial theories, vehement anti-semitism, and rants about 'degenerate' modern art.\n\nThe most egregious offence, however, was the fact that Herr Rosenberg fabricated proof of his noble status, which is mandatory for all teachers in the school. This was cause for him to be expelled and fined 250 Baltic marks. For Herr Rosenberg, this was an amount of money difficult to pay - a teacher with several years of experience in various gymnasiums, he never really got into a position where he could earn that much money - but he eventually scrounged up the fine, and promptly decided to emigrate to Germany.\n\nThe story has earned a little bit of notoriety in Baltic press, mostly as an interesting example of relations between the Baltic Knighthoods and the Baltic German commoners."
 KRBAT.65.a: "I see."

 KRBAT.66.t: "German Intervention in the Baltic conflict"
 KRBAT.66.d: "Immediately after the beginning of Black Monday, the fragile byzantine government of the United Baltic Duchy descended into political infighting and its government froze because of its antiquated system. The situation in the state decayed to a point where a mass underground Latvian and Estonian rebellion broke out to overthrow it. This was not cause for concern at first, as the belief was that professional, veteran forces of the Baltische Landeswehr will be able to suppress resistance. Once this belief turned out to be foolishly optimistic, our forces have chosen to take matters to their own hands.\n\nA detachment of marines supported by the Baltic Sea Fleet and a Heer infantry brigade have landed in Riga, cleared the city of Latvian resistance fighters and secured a perimeter around the city. Expansion further from the Riga base turned out to be impossible without additional reinforcement, as local Baltic forces have essentially disintegrated, thus the German army command in Riga agreed to instead prop up the city municipal government, led by Helmuth Stegman, as a continuation state of the former Duchy.\n\nThis has salvaged our influence in the Baltic region, but also requires us to define our foreign policy regarding the new states of Latvia and Estonia."
 KRBAT.66.a: "I see."

 KRBAT.67.t: "Our Allies to the East"
 KRBAT.67.d: "After internal turmoil throughout 1936, our puppet state to the east, the United Baltic Duchy, fell under the control of a military junta controlled by the Baltic Brotherhood, an association of radical Christian and nationalist nobility who sought to transform their state from the ground up. It is openly Pan-Germanic, and whether we approve of their policies or not, they claim that everything they have done is geared towards loyalty to us and our supposed role as the saviour of Europe from 'eastern barbarism' - a totalitarian, nationalist, militaristic dictatorship now controls Riga and Reval.\n\nThe ideology of the Brotherhood claims that the true nature of Germany, its national body, cannot manifest itself in the Kaiserreich, shackled by hundreds of old and new divisions alike, therefore the Baltic must set the example for Germany's national rebirth and sacrifice itself, its name and identity, in the name of a new Germany. In practice, it means that the Baltics are trying to appeal to our radical and nationalist political groups by setting themselves as a success story of national populism in Germany - and this example has allowed them to grow."
 KRBAT.67.a: "I see."

 KRBAT.68.t: "Decaying Public Finances"
 KRBAT.68.d: "The freeze of governance at the very top has begun to affect public services at the very bottom. Issue is starting to arise with the orderly distribution of public finances - schools, hospitals, postal offices and other institutions see greater and greater delays in funding. The raging economic crisis is only making matters worse. The rank and file members of the Democratic Party are calling us to not forget the average person and dial down the hostile political battle in the Landtag somewhat to prevent this crisis from breaking the nation apart. While we cannot pass anything through the Landtag, perhaps we can alleviate the situation by spending some of our time convincing the Cantons to pick up the slack?"
 KRBAT.68.a: "The nation must pay the toll for freedom"
 KRBAT.68.b: "The local Landtags will help the people"

 KRBAT.70.a: "Until we meet again!"

 KRBAT.71.t: "The German Putsch"
 KRBAT.71.d: "Having grown overwhelmingly influential in Riga's chaotic political landscape, the German military garrison tasked to defend the Free City has finally chosen to take matters to their own hands. They have stormed the Riga City Council and overthrown the democratically elected government there, replacing it with their own puppet regime. Max Erwin von Scheubner-Richter, a Baltic German intellectual and diplomat with significant ties to the German Empire from the Weltkrieg, has been chosen as the head of the puppet regime. It proclaims the need to rapidly build up Riga and prepare it to finally reclaim Germany's birthright in the Baltic states - and they no longer trust the local Baltic Germans to be able to achieve it."
 KRBAT.71.a: "Vorwärts!"

 KRBAT.72.t: "Munter's Ascension"
 KRBAT.72.d: "Helmuth Stegman's government has turned out to be incapable of managing Riga in a moment of crisis, and the past few months have eroded the last remnants of its popularity. The Riga City Council has called and succeeded in a vote of no confidence towards the Mayor and he's chosen to resign - in his place, the lobby of the former Baltic German Democratic Party has placed Wilhelm Munter, an accomplished member of the former Duchy's diplomat corps. Though a member of the Democratic Party, Munter has a different view of society than Paul Schiemann, shaped by the support from the Latvian population which the DbDP relies on in Riga. In his radio address to the city, he's made sure to note that defending and reforming Riga's democratic institutions will be his first task, and finding a way to make amends with the Latvian state his second."
 KRBAT.72.a: "Vorwärts!"

 KRBAT.73.t: "Stegman Stays Strong"
 KRBAT.73.d: "Though challenged from the left and from the right, Helmuth Stegman and his Baltic German Land Party have managed to play both sides and remain firmly in control of the city. German military influence has been curtailed and the left-wing Democrats reluctantly support his responsible government. Following Riga's declaration of sovereignty, Stegman took to the radio waves and informed the Riga public that he will continue to lead the surrounded city in the following years, no matter where history may lead them - whether it is to reclaim the Baltic states or to chart a course of independence."
 KRBAT.73.a: "Vorwärts!"

 KRBAT.74.t: "Flood of Refugees"
 KRBAT.74.d: "After the Forest Brothers uprising, thousands of civilians living in the Baltic Duchy fled their homes. Many of them, obviously, are Baltic Germans, pushed out of their homes by the Forest Brothers, but many others are Latvian and Estonian. They lost their homes during the partisan conflict, or they fear the radicalism of the freedom fighters, or they simply want to live in a better place. Now, these thousands of refugees are on our doorstep, and our meagre infrastructure is already struggling to look after them all. Should some of them be turned back or sent away, or should we tighten our belts and accept everyone regardless?"
 KRBAT.74.a: "Baltic Germans have priority. Turn Latvians back."
 KRBAT.74.b: "Everyone is welcome!"
 KRBAT.74.c: "Send as many to Germany as we can."

 KRBAT.75.t: "Fate of the Duke"
 KRBAT.75.d: "One of the many refugees which made their way to Riga is the former royal family of the Duchy - Adolf Friedrich of Mecklenburg and his daughter Woizlawa Feodora. They have lost their palaces and their duchy, and have been forced to reside among the commoners. Though Riga prides itself as a democratic republican government and so does not consider any possibility of a royal restoration, many Baltic Germans still deeply respect their Duke. Should he be granted a state pension and a residence, or should any privileges he's ever had be erased and the former monarch forced to become a private citizen like everyone else?"
 KRBAT.75.a: "Grant him a state pension."
 KRBAT.75.b: "Riga does not see bloodlines."

 KRBAT.76.t: "Committee of Former Landtag Members"
 KRBAT.76.d: "After the collapse of the United Baltic Duchy, the power over all civilian administration in the Riga holdout fell to the Riga City Council and the Mayor - however, the Baltic Landtag did not vanish anywhere. The remaining members of the Landtag have assembled themselves to a Committee of Former Landtag Members, and though they recognise that they do not have any power, they've formally approached Mayor Helmuth Stegman with the offer to advise the City Council. Their presence would grant Riga additional legitimacy as a successor to the Duchy - although it would also mean that we tie ourselves to its former heritage instead of becoming our own entity. What should be our decision?"
 KRBAT.76.a: "They do not deserve any power."
 KRBAT.76.b: "Allow them to advise the City Council."

 KRBAT.77.t: "Fate of the Knighthoods"
 KRBAT.77.d: "The Livonian Knighthood collapsed alongside the rest of the United Baltic Duchy - but as its offices and documents were held in the House of the Livonian Knighthood in Riga, the remaining nobles have found no difficulty in re-establishing it. As they now reside in a democratic, republican Free City of Riga, however, they recognise that they will no longer have the institutional role they used to have. Still, Adolf Constantin Pilar von Pilchau has approached the Riga City Council, requesting support from the government in re-establishing the Knighthood. Should his request be entertained, or should we forcefully dissolve the Knighthood to display our determination to do away with the past?"
 KRBAT.77.a: "Allow them to be restored, just without power."
 KRBAT.77.b: "Riga. Does not. See bloodlines."

 KRBAT.78.t: "Departure of the Revolutionary Latvian Legion"
 KRBAT.78.d: "At the end of the Great War, the Latvians, following their Russian comrades, rose up in revolution, creating the Iskolat Republic. It was, unfortunately, short-lived, destroyed by German arms, and though many Latvians served in the Bolshevik government, their comrades in Petrograd were defeated as well. Their exiles escaped to the West, where socialist leaning Latvian communities had already been firmly established and accepted them with open arms. The United Kingdom was one of these places, and when Britain collapsed into revolution as well, these Latvians enthusiastically supported it. The Latvian Social Democracy, once a sister party of the Bolsheviks, was reestablished and participated in elections to the Trade Union Congress - now, they are led by Jēkabs Peterss.\n\nPeterss, possibly the man who was the legendary Peter the Painter, leader of the Latvian anarchists in the Battle of Sidney Street in 1911, was a natural fit to lead the Latvian exiles in Britain - he was deeply integrated into British society and had contacts with its socialist movement, even his comrades in Russia remarked that he spoke with an Englishman's accent. During the intervening years, he assembled the Revolutionary Latvian Legion, a small regiment of trained Latvian exiles, ready to return home to instigate a revolution. Now, when the United Baltic Duchy is collapsing, he has found his chance.\n\nWith a brief, yet heartfelt goodbye, Peterss has offered his goodbye to his English wife, his friends, and made a last speech before the Trade Union Congress, where he assured the Union and the rest of the Third Internationale that he shall return a leader of the Second Iskolat Republic."
 KRBAT.78.a: "Good luck, comrades!"

 KRBAT.79.t: "Die Baltenfahne"
 KRBAT.79.d: "The collapse of the United Baltic Duchy has had significant impact upon Baltic German culture. A feeling of revanchism, reclamation, yet also dread for the future lingers in newly composed poems and published paintings. Displaced nobles long for their former homes, the average Baltic German believes that their world has gone upside down and will never become the same again, and yet, as long as they believe in each other and their goal, they should be able to power through this adversity. Nowhere else is this more exemplified than in the poem 'Die Baltenfahne' ('The Baltic Banner').\n\nWritten by Baron Manteuffel-Katzdangen, a Baltic German nobleman who fled to Riga with his family and belongings, it tells the story of the Baltic German retreat to the city, symbolising it with the theme of the 'Baltic Banner' - a representation of the role of the Baltic Germans as the defenders of Germany in the East, as their outpost which has since been forced out of their birthright. And yet, the poem is optimistic - it calls for those who remain to pick up the banner and return to the Ostland, where it belongs.\n\nThe poem has since been turned into a song - 'Die Grenzwacht hielt im Osten' ('the Border Guard of the East'), adopted by Riga's Baltic German community as a rallying march for their future return."
 KRBAT.79.a: "The Ostland is not yet lost!"

 KRBAT.80.t: "The Revolutionary Latvian Legion"
 KRBAT.80.d: "At the end of the Great War, the Latvians, following their Russian comrades, rose up in revolution, creating the Iskolat Republic. It was, unfortunately, short-lived, destroyed by German arms, and though many Latvians served in the Bolshevik government, their comrades in Petrograd were defeated as well. Their exiles escaped to the West, where socialist leaning Latvian communities had already been firmly established and accepted them with open arms. Ever since then, under the leadership of Jēkabs Peterss, they assembled the Revolutionary Latvian Legion, a small regiment of trained Latvian exiles, ready to return home to instigate a revolution.\n\nAnd now, thanks to German secret services, we have been informed that they are filtering into the Duchy, joining the Forest Brothers uprising, and bringing critically important equipment to the resistance. They are trained in forest warfare and are well prepared, and so pose a serious threat even if there's few of them. What should we do?"
 KRBAT.80.a: "Search every incoming ship and train for these socialists!"
 KRBAT.80.b: "We cannot afford the resources for such a campaign..."

 KRBAT.81.t: "The First Presidential Election"
 KRBAT.81.d: "Constitutional republicanism is a fresh concept in Baltic German lands, but enthusiasm for the first real election in the country is high. All the limitations, traditional systems and manipulation have been dealt away with, and a real, democratic election is about to take place. And the people of the Baltic Federation have several choices to pick from..."
 KRBAT.81.a: "Wilhelm Munter will continue Schiemann's legacy!"
 KRBAT.81.b: "Helmuth Stegman will steer the nation forward!"
 KRBAT.81.c: "The war hero, Harry Lutz!"
 KRBAT.81.e: "Cancel the election, keep the Constitution suspended."

 KRBAT.82.t: "Riga-Reval Rally"
 KRBAT.82.d: "Automobile sports have fascinated the Baltic German nobility for a long time and races between the nobles in the Baltic provinces have been held even before the Weltkrieg - they could afford to purchase and build these vehicles, after all. The Duke, Adolf Friedrich, has been a patron of the sport for decades as well - back in 1898, he had been forbidden by Kaiser Wilhelm II from horseback racing because of his recklessness while riding a horse, thus he turned to driving cars instead. Now that the situation in the Baltics has stabilised, the Duke has provided patronage to a racing competition across the entire Duchy, dubbed the Riga-Reval Rally.\n\nThe Rally starts in Riga, the capital, and turns to the forested countryside of Livonia, then by the lakeside of Lake Peipus, and finally stops in Reval, the capital of the Estland Canton. Shockingly, the Duke managed to win the race he choose to give patronage to as well. Three decades of experience allowed him to overcome his competition, especially in the hills and forests of eastern Livonia, where he was able to repair his broken down car on the spot, while several of his competitors had to bow out."
 KRBAT.82.a: "Riga-Reval Rally? Would you call it... RRR?"

 KRBAT.83.t: "November 5th"
 KRBAT.83.d: "Today, on November 5th, 1918, the Vereinigte Landesrat (Joint Land Council) of Livland, Estland, Ösel and Riga, elected earlier that year, made the decision to proclaim the independence of the United Baltic Duchy from the collapsing Russian state and appoint a Regency Council, headed by the Land Marshal of the Livonian Knighthood, Adolf Pilar von Pilchau. Though the original document calls for the United Baltic Duchy to join with the German Empire in a personal union, a proposal which was ultimately never accomplished in full, this date is considered to be the day of independence of the United Baltic Duchy, and has been marked by celebrations across the entire country."
 KRBAT.83.a: "In treue fest!"

 KRBAT.84.t: "February 24th"
 KRBAT.84.d: "Today, on February 24th, 1918, the Maapaev, the legislative assembly of the Autonomous Governorate of Estonia, declared the independence of the Republic of Estonia. This declaration was made in the heat of the moment during Operation Faustschlag and thus made null by the advancing German armies - the Estonian provisional government chose to resist instead of surrender, however. During the German occupation, they assembled Omakaitse paramilitary forces in secret and staged a rebellion not long after November 5th, the declaration of independence of the United Baltic Duchy. This marked the beginning of the Estonian War of Independence.\n\nIt was a failed uprising, suppressed by the Baltische Landeswehr with the help of German arms - but it allowed the Estonian Provisional Government to escape to Sweden and continue their fight from exile. To this day, they claim to be the legitimate government of Estland and Northern Livland, and many Estonians see their claims as just. Every year, we seek to stamp out the celebrations of this Estonian 'day of independence', to little avail."
 KRBAT.84.a: "That day means nothing! Nothing!"

 KRBAT.85.t: "Der Großtyrann und das Gericht"
 KRBAT.85.d: "A new novel has been published today, by the accomplished author Werner Bergengruen, titled \"Der Großtyrann und das Gericht\" (\"The Great Tyrant and his Court\"). It is, on the surface, a crime novel set in a city state in late Medieval Italy. The plot of the novel revolves around the murder of the monk Fra Augustino in the garden of the aforementioned Great Tyrant, the absolute ruler of the city state who is a constant presence in the book, yet never mentioned by name. The rest of the novel is dedicated to a series of characters, all of whom try to solve the crime, fail, and attempt to please the Great Tyrant by accusing innocents of having committed the crime - all of these lies are seen through, however, and the roster of characters thins with each chapter. A court session is held at the end of the book, whereupon it is revealed that the Tyrant himself had ordered the monk murdered - he orders all the documents of the case to be burned and pleads for forgiveness.\n\nThe Baltic Brotherhood hails the novel as a great example of the sort of culture they wish to foster - noting the religious themes of the book and the larger-than-life standing of the Great Tyrant, including his turn to good and towards the Christian faith. Hushed whispers on the ground speak of the true themes of the book - the madness of autocracy and unquenched bloodthirst of a single absolute ruler, and how the allegories in the novel represent the totalitarian regime of the Baltic state."
 KRBAT.85.a: "What...?"

 KRBAT.86.t: "Abolition of the Old Testament"
 KRBAT.86.d: "Ever since the integration of Friedrich von der Ropp and his revelationary followers into the Baltic Brotherhood, the ideological tenets of the organisation have dismissed the sanctity of the Old Testament. Though they are not the first to try to distance Christianity from Judaism with anti-semitic and racialist intent, the Brotherhood has gone the farthest. New Evangelics, written by von der Ropp, have been distributed across the country, heavily rewritten to reject almost the entirety of the Old Testament and its emphasis on the passive, rather than active, aspects of Jesus Christ - miraculous birth, suffering, betrayal by the Pharisees and otherworldly redemption. Instead, it stresses Jesus's actions as a preacher and fighter who sought to destroy institutional Judaism and bring forth salvation.\n\nThough officially the entirety of the nation has converted to the Brotherhood's interpretation of Christianity, the absolute majority of the population do not follow the guidelines set forth, and reject them either openly or secretly. Still, this sets the foundation for the esoteric, totalitarian transformation of Baltic German culture. Through faith, one can control the entire people."
 KRBAT.86.a: "Christianity saves us from the Jewish God!"

 KRBAT.87.t: "Adolf Friedrich Goes On a Journey"
 KRBAT.87.d: "Our Duke, Adolf Friedrich, has prepared to embark on a new journey across the world - becoming the ruler of the United Baltic Duchy has not abated him from his passion to explore the planet. Germany's dominance in the world has made his passion only more easier to pursue, after all. Where he shall head next is a private matter which he has not shared with [BAT.GetSecondInCommand] nor the rest of the government - but there are few places in the world he has yet to visit. Mittelafrika is a likely prospect, but he's expressed interest to visit all the nations in South America, the chaotic political landscape that is China, or even the distant Pacific islands. If he was not sixty years old, perhaps he'd try to reach the South Pole as well...\n\nWhile her father is absent, the day to day duties of the Duke will be fulfilled by Princess Woizlawa Feodora. As the United Baltic Duchy is a constitutional monarchy and the monarch's duties are not critical, the government can continue running - but the inexperience of the Princess means that governance will be slower for the time being."
 KRBAT.87.a: "Gute Reise!"

 KRBAT.88.t: "Adolf Friedrich Returns"
 KRBAT.88.d: "Our Duke, Adolf Friedrich, has returned from his journey across the world with a diary full of insight into the culture and daily life of distant African and American peoples. During these three months, he has crossed hundreds of miles and even gotten into a couple of accidents on the edge of life or death - but, in the end, he states that feeling the thrill and quenching the thirst of curiosity was worth it.\n\nThe Duke has already begun plotting his next journey - and states that he will follow through with it as long as no war gets in the way."
 KRBAT.88.a: "Welcome home!"

 KRBAT.89.t: "The Freikorps"
 KRBAT.89.d: "The news of the Forest Brothers rebellion have reached Germany, and thousands of Germans have taken this as a chance to rise up. Nationalist minded Weltkrieg veterans have begun to organise into armed paramilitary volunteer groups and make their way to the United Baltic Duchy — these battalions call themselves the Freikorps. The leaders of these units are colourful in their backgrounds and so are their followers, but many of them are veterans who never managed to fully integrate back into society after the Weltkrieg, ended up swept up by nationalist associations, and romanticise their time in the front.\n\nGeneral Hans von Manteuffel-Szoege, one of the commanders responsible for the suppression of the Forest Brothers, has been approached by the leader of one of the smaller Freikorps — a former officer in the Bavarian Army and a not so successful agronomist, Heinrich Himmler. Speaking for the volunteers, Himmler offered their support in suppressing the Latvians and Estonians. Though Manteuffel could barely stand the officer's erratic way of speaking and the way how he appealed to some weird sense of \"Aryan brotherhood\" in almost every sentence, an offer of support is still an offer of support - and so his report arrived to the Landeswehr headquarters in Riga about new groups of volunteers wishing to help. What should be the response?"
 KRBAT.89.a: "We cannot pick and choose, all help is welcome."
 KRBAT.89.b: "We don't need ruffians getting in the way!"

 KRBAT.90.t: "Into the Fire"
 KRBAT.90.d: "Deployed to the Baltic countryside, the Freikorps volunteers have spent their time leisurely patrolling the countryside and extorting the local villages, often with unnecessary brutality, drawing the ire of the local population while achieving very little in actually suppressing the partisans. Heinrich Himmler's unit in particular spent more time listening to the Bavarian officer's stories than actually going after Latvian resistance.\n\nThe response of the Forest Brothers was swift. Attacking from bases in the dense Livland forests, they would always catch the German volunteers unprepared and descend back into shadows immediately after their strike. More often than not, the Baltische Landeswehr would only be made aware of the battles after their far more prepared battalions came across the remains, and thus try to deduce what happened from the dead. As the Landeswehr reported, a complete lack of discipline, prevalent intoxication, and a lack of any measures against traps were the most common causes of these losses.\n\nIn one of the numerous unmarked graves now dotting Livland, Baltic German soldiers identified the corpse of officer Himmler. Like most of his peers, he arrived to the Baltics expecting a cakewalk against \"subhumans\", and yet found only death."
 KRBAT.90.a: "They've done more harm than good..."

 KRBAT.91.t: "Death of Paul Schiemann"
 KRBAT.91.d1: "The founding father of the Baltic German Democratic Party and a titan of the region's politics for the past four decades, Paul Schiemann, has passed away, During the last decade of his life, he struggled with a severe case of tuberculosis, and yet remained active until the last months of his life, working with his party and publishing newspaper articles.\n\nHe received a modest funeral in Germany, attended only by his family and a small circle of friends. In the funeral, Ewald Ammende, Schiemann's protege and leading member of the DbDP, read out a speech to the rest of the attending suite, stating that Schiemann's ideals will live for centuries after his death."
 KRBAT.91.d2: "The founding father of the Baltic German Democratic Party and a titan of the region's politics for the past four decades, Paul Schiemann, has passed away, During the last decade of his life, he struggled with a severe case of tuberculosis, and yet remained active until the last months of his life, working with his party and publishing newspaper articles.\n\nHis funeral, held in Riga, has been attended by thousands of people, including the entire Democratic Party and numerous representatives of the Four Baltic Knighthoods. In the funeral, Ewald Ammende, Schiemann's protege and leading member of the DbDP, read out a speech to the rest of the attending suite, stating that Schiemann's ideals will live for centuries after his death."
 KRBAT.91.a: "Memento mori."

 KRBAT.92.t: "AI Cheat Event"
 KRBAT.92.d: "If you are seeing this - hi, I'm Augenis, I developed the reworked United Baltic Duchy from scratch. I created complex mechanics for anyone playing the UBD to deal with, I tried to make the AI follow them, I failed, so I created this cheat event for them to deal with it instead. You weren't supposed to see it. If you got this event legally (i.e. without using the console), make a bug report."
 KRBAT.92.a: "Okay"

 KRBAT.93.t: "Trapped in the Heart of Darkness"
 KRBAT.93.d: "When the news reached camp, the Duke of the United Baltic Duchy and his small party of explorers were established deep in the jungles of German Congo. Far from civilisation, distanced from the nearest port by hundreds of kilometres of jungle and savanna, Adolf Friedrich was informed by a panicking messenger that his return will be far, far more difficult than anticipated. The continent has collapsed to war and bloodshed - the incompetent colonial government in Dar-es-Salaam has run Mittelafrika down to a point where all vestiges of the Governor's authority have vanished. Warlords and cliques, each one supported by armed bands of Askari, now roam across the vast continent, carving it up into fiefdoms and going to war against one another. And they are now trapped in this maelstrom.\n\nThe Duke's party is composed of two fellow explorers, three devotedly loyal Landeswehr officers, and a handful of Askari - a paultry force which will now have to escort a high profile passenger across hundreds of miles of battleground. This got the Duke to ready his rifle with more vigour than usual - it is time for the biggest, and hopefully not the last, adventure of his life.\n\nMeanwhile, the news of the collapse of Mittelafrika has sent the government of the United Baltic Duchy to a panic. Already, [BAT.GetSecondInCommand] is being advised to appoint a permanent regency, and perhaps, if the Duke does not show up anytime soon, to declare him officially dead and enthrone his successor. Duke Adolf Friedrich's daughter, Princess Woizlawa Feodora, expects him to return, however. According to her, this is nothing her veteran father cannot handle."
 KRBAT.93.a: "Let us hope she is right..."

 KRBAT.94.t: "Escaping the Trap"
 KRBAT.94.d: "The day after the news arrived, Duke Adolf Friedrich and his camp gathered in the monarch explorer's tent to figure out their next course of action. Any planning they could do, however, was extremely limited - their knowledge about the post-collapse makeup of Mittelafrika was nonexistent, they had no clue who was in charge in the nearest village, much less in the towns and cities of the gigantic colony. All that could be done is educated guesses and hopes that the warlords carving up Mittelafrika are not as bloodthirsty as they could be.\n\nFollowing the Duke's advice, and with the support of the Askari who knew the land, the expedition decided to continue with their planned course. From their current location, they should head to Boyoma, formerly known as Stanleyville - the Congo River is the best natural highway for them to escape through, and before the expedition began, the Duke had contracted a Belgian shipping company in the city to lend them a boat with which they would be able to make their way to Kinshasa.\n\nThe other day after setting off from camp, the Duke learned from group of African patrols that Boyoma, as well as the entire eastern half of Congo, are under the control of [KIV.GetLeader], the local strongman who runs [KIV.GetNameDef]. Perhaps he is amiable enough to help."
 KRBAT.94.a: "Vorwärts!"
 BAT_will_reach_in_30_days: "The Duke will reach Boyoma in 30 days."

 KRBAT.95.t: "In Boyoma"
 KRBAT.95.d: "Having arrived to Boyoma, Duke Adolf Friedrich and his party find themselves beset by trouble.\n\nThroughout the past month, [KIV.GetNameDef] has gotten into a slew of warlord conflicts because of its strategic position in the country, and therefore the city is in disorder. Askari and conscripted locals are everywhere, taking young men pretty much from the streets in order to drag them into service, while the rest of the population are being levied tax after tax to fund these military ventures. At least, that is what a scout sent by the Duke informed about while the rest of the party took refuge in an abandoned farm at the outskirts of the city.\n\nEntering Boyoma like nothing's going on is not an option. While the Duke's Belgian contractor is still there, if a party of Askari and Baltic Germans are noticed in the streets, they will immediately be treated as hostiles - and if the warlord's men realise how important of a person their leader is, he will almost certainly be kidnapped for ransom. With this intelligence now in their grasp, the Duke and his men gather outside the hut that's been their shelter, discussing their possible plan ahead."
 KRBAT.95.a: "Infiltrate the town at night, take the ship, and run."
 KRBAT.95.b: "Contact our friend in Boyoma in secret, have him pick us up."
 KRBAT.95.c: "Leave the city be and travel by foot, find another ship."

 KRBAT.96.t: "Night Skirmish"
 KRBAT.96.d: "Activity in Boyoma does not die down at night completely, but the amount of soldiers on the streets is less to the point where making one's way through the town is actually viable. Hoping to not catch anyone's attention, the Duke and his party hid their weapons and made their way through the streets quickly, not speaking a single word to one another until they finally reached the Belgian shipping entrepreneur's house - a man whom Adolf Friedrich had the pleasure of working with in past expeditions already, and who kept his head low as soon as the Mittelafrikan system collapsed.\n\nAs soon as the Belgian led his friend and party to the town docks, however, shouting broke out, rifles were cocked and soldiers went into position. Turns out the men of [KIV.GetNameDef] were getting ready to requisition the ship already, and so the steamboat was now crawling with the warlord's soldiers. The orders of Lieutenant Bernd von Freytagh-Loringhoven, the commander of the Duke's Landeswehr-Askari guard, came immediately - storm the ship, draw your weapons, and take out the enemy with as little sound as possible.\n\nEven if they only numbered a handful, that was more than enough to sweep the ship - professional and disciplined career soldiers stand head and shoulders above barely trained conscripts. The final kill came from the Duke's handgun, hitting the last African soldier in the neck and throwing the body overboard. As soon as the ship was cleared, the engine was fired up and the vessel took off from port. By the time the morning arrives, the Kivu will be furious, but their target will have long since vanished."
 KRBAT.96.a: "That was close, let's hope that's the end of that."

 KRBAT.97.t: "A Close Call"
 KRBAT.97.d: "One of the Duke's Askari, dressed in a farmer's rags and keeping his distance from everyone in the city, made his way to the Boyoma docks, finding the man Adolf Friedrich instructed to find and explaining the situation. As it turns out, the two of them were old friends and cooperated in exploration missions before, so the old businessman, who had kept his head low as soon as the Mittelafrikan system collapsed, agreed to risk his career and help. The rest of the party made camp downstream from the city, and waited for a ship to pass by.\n\nNone seemed to come even as hours passed and the day was replaced by night. Meanwhile, the commander of the Duke's Landeswehr-Askari guard, Lieutenant Bernd von Freytagh-Loringhoven, informed that their position was already compromised - as it turns out, they have been noticed by a patrol of the clique's soldier not too long ago and forces in the city were already mobilising to engage them. The soldiers were ordered to take arms, pack all of their belongings and be ready for a skirmish while escaping the enemy forces - and then, the sound of a whistle reached them. A ship was approaching, the same one which the Duke had handpicked for his expedition months ago, and it was finally coming to he rescue.\n\nTurns out the businessman was held up by some soldiers trying to requisition the ship, but handily resolved the matter and was ready to lend it back to the Germans. The party quickly boarded the ship and departed - the Kivu will certainly be furious, but their target will have long since vanished."
 KRBAT.97.a: "That was close, let's hope that's the end of that."

 KRBAT.98.t: "In Boyoma Outskirts"
 KRBAT.98.d: "Getting around the city, the Duke and his party travelled downsream the Congo River, watching out for any vessels they might possibly be able to board. And, sure enough, they eventually found their target. In the depths of the Congo, the river is one of the few means of transportation available, and [KIV.GetNameDef] put it to use - a ferry bringing several dozen conscripts from the northern villages passed by, making its way towards the capital of the clique. The number of men they'd have to deal with was intimidating at first, but the commander of the Duke's Landeswehr-Askari guard, Lieutenant Bernd von Freytagh-Loringhoven, bet on his chances.\n\nThe Lieutenant made the first shot, firing from the bushes and sniping the captain away, which immediately sent the ship into chaos. The few soldiers commanding the ship were not trained enough to deal with attacks from land while they're on the ship, so they made the fatal mistake of steering it closer to the coast in order to fire upon the attackers - which meant that, using makeshift rafts, the soldiers were able to board the ship and fight through the crew. Pretty much all of the fresh conscripts either surrendered or dove to the river immediately, while those fighting were easily eliminated by the Baltic German professionals. The final kill came from the Duke's handgun, hitting the last African soldier in the neck and throwing the body overboard.\n\nBy the time the morning arrives, the Kivu will be furious, but their target will have long since vanished."
 KRBAT.98.a: "A bit too much noise, but good enough."
 BAT_will_reach_in_45_days: "The Duke will reach Mbandaka in 45 days."

 KRBAT.99.t: "A Fellow Traveller"
 KRBAT.99.d: "As you stop for camp one evening, you notice that an old man in poor clothing has made camp at the same place. From his appearance and looks, it's easy to tell that he is not a native of the region - clearly an Arab, who ended up in the Congo for reasons unknown. The man offers to tell you a hadith he has if you can spare him some bread."
 KRBAT.99.a: "Listen to the old man."
 KRBAT.99.b: "It is just an old man..."
 BAT_CK2_reference: "You listen to the old man's hadith."

 KRBAT.100.t: "A Fellow Traveller"
 KRBAT.100.d: "The old man quotes the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, from Sunan Abu Dawood, \"The most evil traits in a man are severe stinginess and uninhibited cowardice!\"\n\nThe Muslim faithful among the Askari immediately thank for this wisdom by chanting 'Alhamdulilah!' - the Baltic Germans, however, have a different motto to recant when bravery and loyalty are on the line."
 KRBAT.100.a: "In treuen fest!"

 KRBAT.101.t: "Approaching Mbandaka"
 KRBAT.101.d: "Formerly known as Coquilhatville, Mbandaka is a halfway point from Boyoma to the Atlantic Ocean — and it is the capital of [TKE.GetNameDef], led by [TKE.GetLeader], yet another Askari commander turned warlord. That is the information which Duke Adolf Friedrich and his party received as their vessel approached the city over the Congo River, which has once again forced them to start planning. In the living quarters of the ship, a map has been stretched, notebooks laid down where all the scraps of information about the Mittelafrika's collapse are marked, and their next move is being deliberated.\n\nMuch like in Boyoma, simply entering the city is out of question — the ship will be searched and taken hostage faster than they can say \"how much is the ransom?\". If they are careless, that is. Perhaps, if they hide everything unusual about the ship - the German passengers, the weapons and the uniforms - they can pass by as an inconspicuous local ship and get away with only a few questions. Alternatively, there is the option to not deal with the risk at all, bring the ship to land and try to carry it over several miles of jungle before plopping it down back in the Congo."
 KRBAT.101.a: "Bring the ship to the coast and carry it over land."
 KRBAT.101.b: "If we act inconspicuous, we can make it through..."

 KRBAT.102.t: "The Long March"
 KRBAT.102.d: "Lacking other options on how to keep a low profile, the Duke's party scuttled the ship and began dragging it over land, carrying it through jungle routes on the backs of the men - its largely wooden construction meant that it was light enough to carry by the party. Slowly, they made their way through the jungle, following maps of the region to avoid the city as well as any major roads, and so sneak under the nose of [TKE.GetNameDef]. At night and during rain, the ship would serve as their shelter, and whenever the road becomes clear again, they'd move out and continue.\n\nIt was not as simple as initially anticipated, however. During the long march, the party had to escape and fend off several bands of brigands who would spot them and immediately get ready to engage. Whether they were associated with the warlord and his forces, the Germans and Askari had no chance to figure out, as they simply could not afford to stop and ask questions. All of them would soon regret their choice, anyway - as soon as they'd approach the party to extort tribute, they would see the supposedly helpless travellers reveal their hidden weapons and turn their ship into cover - the Landeswehr has faced off against this routine enough times during the Forest Brothers rebellion. Usually, just showing their teeth would be enough to get the brigands to flee.\n\nAfter reaching a safe enough spot downstream from Mbandaka, the party once again pushed the boat into the river and boarded it, setting off to the next stop in their journey."
 KRBAT.102.a: "Onwards to Kinshasa!"

 KRBAT.103.t: "A Near Discovery"
 KRBAT.103.d: "In a few hours, the vessel was swiftly transformed into an inconspicuous civilian boat - a few Askari remained on the deck, all out of uniform and wearing casual rags, while the rest of the party, all of their belongings, and weapons were carried deep into the ship's compartments. Just as expected, as soon as the vessel crossed into the boundaries of the town, shouting from the coast ordered it to stop by the nearest pier. One of the Askari was instructed to explain their situation and craft a story about just being a group of farmers passing by on their boat, and a conversation in French ensued.\n\nThough the Askari insisted to just go without much questioning or searching, and managed to convince the clique's men that there is nothing of value to be found in his ship, a younger conscript among their ranks snuck in to the compartments under the deck on his own, without anyone's knowledge. As soon as he discovered the hiding European adventurers, Lieutenant von Freytagh-Loringhoven caught him and slit his throat before he could release a single yelp. Realising what was about to happen, the Askari immediately insisted to just pay the rest a bribe to let them go - which the soldiers were content with, and by the time they realised that one of their own was missing, the boat had already left the city.\n\nAs soon as the unfortunate victim's body got thrown overboard, the Duke and his men set off to the next stop in their journey."
 KRBAT.103.a: "Onwards to Kinshasa!"

 BAT_will_reach_in_20_days: "The Duke will reach Kinshasa in 20 days."

 KRBAT.104.t: "Troubles in the Kongo"
 KRBAT.104.d: "Approaching Kinshasa, once known as Leopoldville, Duke Adolf Friedrich and his party were already starting to plan for their next move — however, an optimistic mood had set upon the men. After all, not only were they so close to the Atlantic, and so their freedom, but they were also entering the lands of King Pedro VII, the ruler of the formerly autonomous Kingdom of Kongo — and so a step up from the usual Askari warlord. Little did they know that there was not much better to write about this supposed \"Kingdom\", which, like all other states in the former Mittelafrika, were led by a warlord clique.\n\nAnd they were aware that the Duke was coming.\n\nAn ambush suddenly began, hooks were thrown from the foliage of the jungle to slow down the ship and force it to stop, while boats took off from Kinshasa to meet the incoming vessel. The surroundings were crawling with Kongo clique soldiers, there was no chance of fighting back - therefore, the Duke ordered his men to stand down, lay down their guns and surrender.\n\nThe first ship which arrived to the scene took in the Duke immediately - as it turns out, they were aware from the beginning that an European royal was coming their way, and so prepared for this seizure in advance. Even in the depths of Africa, rumours spread very quickly."
 KRBAT.104.a: "What happens now?.."

 KRBAT.105.t: "Captive"
 KRBAT.105.d: "For the past week, Duke Adolf Friedrich has been held in a makeshift prison cell in Kinshasa, always watched over by a rotating guard of Askari soldiers loyal to the Kongo clique. The fact that the monarch was past sixty years old slipped by the minds of the African soldiers after they dumped him in the unsanitary cell, given scrap to eat once per day, while they were figuring out how to get the telephone line in Kinshasa working again so they can send a message to Europe and inform that they seek a ransom. Hey, at least that means if he survives for long enough, he might eventually get home...\n\nBut when day once again changed to night, the cell's Askari guard spoke over the door - and the language was Ewe, native to Togoland, which the Duke had taken his time to learn when he served as the colony's governor.\n\nThe Askari introduced himself as Martin Aku - a Togolese native born in the colony during the Duke's time as governor, who travelled to Germany after the war, studied medicine, and finally travelled to Mittelafrika before being forcefully recruited into the Kongolese clique's army as a field medic. Much like the Duke, he wants to return to Europe, and so he offered to break the monarch out of imprisonment and pick him up with them.\n\nThem. He's not alone, he has convinced several more Askari to defect and join his escape tonight."
 KRBAT.105.a: "\"Of course.\""

 KRBAT.106.t: "The Escape"
 KRBAT.106.d: "The plan went smoothly at first. When the clock struck midnight, Aku unlocked the cell and escorted Duke Adolf Friedrich into the streets, where he was joined with several of his conspirators — they have already drank the \"loyalist\" prison guards to sleep throughout the course of the evening, and while it's left them a little tipsy, they were ready to grab a boat and escape to the Atlantic. Kinshasa is a pretty big city, unfortunately, and the defectors were soon compromised by a dog barking next to a sleeping patrol - alerting them, causing panic, misunderstanding and finally a shootout.\n\nNot wishing to engage the warlord's soldiers and so lose the only chance they had to escape with their lives, Adolf Friedrich, Aku and the rest fled, not even bothering to fire back. At this point, however, the Kinshasa docks were already full of soldiers, all woken up and alerted by the ongoing fighting, and by the time the party stumbled into the series of customs houses, warehouses and docked ships which composed the port, there was no way out left.\n\nAt this critical moment, however, a door behind them cracked open, revealing a familiar, if battered face - with a partially ripped uniform and a rifle in his hand, Lieutenant von Freytagh-Loringhoven stood and waited for his Duke to follow.\n\n\"Come with me if you want to live.\""
 KRBAT.106.a: "A fair offer..."

 KRBAT.107.t: "The Escape"
 KRBAT.107.d: "The Lieutenant and his men, German and African alike, had been imprisoned as well, but kept under horrid conditions - the Africans were soon forcefully recruited into the clique's army, whereas the Germans, kept around for their possible ransoms, eventually attempted a desperate escape. Fighting through their detainers, only the Lieutenant managed to escape, while the rest had to be left behind and almost certainly died - hunted for the entire week, he survived off whatever he could scavenge in the city while searching for a way to escape. And now, with the Duke in tow, von Freytagh-Loringhoven could finally put his plan into action.\n\nSneaking through the docks, the party suddenly assaulted a docked patrol boat, taking out and throwing out the sailors manning it, and immediately revved the engines. The rest of the mobilised forces quickly caught what was going on, and under the Lieutenant's orders, the entire party fled from the deck, cramping into a small comparment below to avoid gunfire coming off the coast. Three boats took off after theirs, but could no longer catch the escaping party - and, in case any one of them got too close, von Freytagh-Loringhoven always had his rifle ready. He never needed it, however, and the survivors could take a breath of relief. The worst was over."
 KRBAT.107.a: "Thank God..."

 KRBAT.108.t: "An Unexpected Intruder"
 KRBAT.108.d: "Ever since the German colonies in Africa broke apart, Portuguese patrols in their territorial waters in Angola grew more frequent, catching smugglers and escapades almost every week - but today, they've caught an unexpected intruder. It flew not the German flag, or some other frequently seen one like French, English or Belgian, but rather the banner of the United Baltic Duchy - sewn from rags and pieces of ripped fabric in advance, but still unmistakably the Baltic banner from a distance.\n\nThe Portuguese patrol ship hailed the incoming boat and stopped it, upon which the servicemen were introduced to a baffling story - the ship carried the Duke of the United Baltic Duchy, Adolf Friedrich, alongside a Baltic German officer and a small number of African escapades, who had been stuck in the African jungle for several months. Immediately, the passengers boarded the patrol ship and were brought back to Angola, where they would finally be able to make a telephone call back home and take the first ship to Europe."
 KRBAT.108.a: "We're saved!"

 KRBAT.109.a: "What was he doing there in the first place?!"

 KRBAT.110.t: "The Return of the Duke"
 KRBAT.110.d: "The Duke returned to a large crowd in Riga, including all the ministers of government and [BAT.GetSecondInCommand] himself, who expressed the nation's collective worries during the past few months to the reckless Duke. By now, however, the Duchy was simply grateful that their monarch has returned and did so in one piece, despite all the hardship he's had to go through in the past few months. Lieutenant von Freytagh-Loringhoven immediately received a medal for his bravery during the expedition, as well as a scholarship for a full officer's education in Germany thanks to the personal recommendation of the Duke, who got to see the man's talent first hand.\n\nThe expedition has taken a toll on Duke Adolf Friedrich and so he's made the decision to stay in the Baltics from here on out - however, when asked by his daughter Princess Woizlawa Feodora on his thoughts about the entire experience, he replied with:\n\n\"Frankly, I had fun.\""
 KRBAT.110.a: "At least he's home now..."

 KRBAT.111.t: "The Red Graf"
 KRBAT.111.d: "Alexander von Stenbock-Fermor has been a thorn in the side of the United Baltic Duchy for much of its existence. A Graf of the Swedish-origin House of Stenbock-Fermor, registered in the Estonian Knighthood, he volunteered to the Baltische Landeswehr in 1918 like his peers, but the conflict and brutality left him appalled. He moved to Germany instead, where he worked as a coal miner in the Rhineland, got to learn about the plight of the lower classes his family used to dismiss, and became a Syndicalist. Since then, he's moved to the Künstlerkolonie Berlin, publishing avant-garde literature, translating the works of his grand-uncle Pyotr Kropotkin, and writing treatises about the situation back in his homeland.\n\nIn response to the political instability in the United Baltic Duchy, the \"Red Graf\" has published a short essay about his view on the Baltic German state and its future, under the pseudonym \"Peter Lorenz\". There, he writes that the Baltic-German Democratic Party and its reforms are but an attempt by the bourgeois classes of the Duchy to prevent a revolution of the proletariat with soulless appeasement. The social tensions, the byzantine government structure, and the oppression of the Latvians and Estonians create a perfect set of conditions for a revolutionary liberation of the Baltic states - and he will be eager to support it if that happens."
 KRBAT.111.a: "How is he still there?"

 KRBAT.112.t: "The Red Graf's Resistance"
 KRBAT.112.d: "News have arrived that a challenger to our hegemony in the Baltic state has thrown his glove to the ring. Alexander von Stenbock-Fermor, the so-called \"Red Graf\" in Berlin, has reacted to the rise of the Baltic Brotherhood by organising refugee efforts for opponents of the regime. Throughout the past few months, he and his fellow German socialists have organised an underground network to ship liberal politicians, Latvian and Estonian partisans, and Jews out of the Baltics and into Germany, where they can be safe from persecution. This has granted the Red Graf a folk hero status in the country and allows those who escaped to organise into resistance organisations outside of the reach of the Landeswehr."
 KRBAT.112.a: "Bastard!"

 KRBAT.113.t: "Famine!"
 KRBAT.113.d: "Our breakneck militarisation has had unfortunate side effects. The Forest Brothers rebellion has dealt a severe blow to agriculture in the Baltic provinces, and the forced movement of thousands of people into industrial areas, coupled with harsh taxation to pay for new machinery, has sparked hunger, malnutrition and even outright famine in the countryside. The situation is growing worse with every report and requires immediate attention.\n\nThough shipments from Germany should alleviate the hunger eventually, relying upon them does not sit right with von Kursell and his government - if the Baltics are to become a model province for the National Revival, they cannot rely upon anyone. The Inner Circle of the Brotherhood has been gathered to deliberate upon the situation - a solution was found immediately. To ensure that everyone in the society gets their fair share, the government must take full control of the food supply in the Baltic state, to take from the people their agricultural surplus by force and distribute it to those who need it.\n\nThe issue comes on the means how this ideal will be implemented. The youthful recruits in the Initiation Circle cry that fault falls upon unequal distribution of wealth - the fat capitalist cats in the cities and the decrepit old landowners in the countryside need to have their estates seized, their wealth taken by force, and distributed to those suffering. The Inner Circle takes a more pragmatic view to the issue, however. To von Kursell, Manteuffel-Szoege and others, the Baltic Germans must take priority, and Latvians and Estonians, being the subservient, need to pay the price for German revival. Their programme would call for the forceful seizure of agricultural surplus in the countryside to distribute it to the cities and provinces with Baltic German population.\n\nWhatever policy they may choose, the Landeswehr stands ready to implement it on the ground."
 KRBAT.113.a: "The rich will pay their due!"
 KRBAT.113.b: "The Germans take priority for a reason..."

 KRBAT.114.t: "Transformation of the Land"
 KRBAT.114.d: "Owing to their Baltic origin, and influence by the agrarian Blut und Boden movement in Germany, the Baltic Brotherhood places great importance upon the issue of agriculture — and with their takeover of the country, they are able to implement their designs upon the Baltic countryside. The brothers of the Inner Circle stand by a romanticised, aristocratic view of the land — a system of natural hierarchy, where the blue-blooded Baltic German class reigns and the lesser non-German classes serve. However, the aristocrat of the nationally revived Baltic State should have little in common with what the Brotherhood perceives to be \"decrepit, corrupt, sycophantic landowners\" of the decades before, who merely hoard the wealth of the land and waste it on luxury. As the propaganda machine claims, the Baltic German aristocrat earns his right to reign over his servants by being modest, prudent, devoutly Christian, and above all else, a noble \"Wehrbauer\" - an idealised image of a medieval German colonist in the East, able both to work the land and to defend it, not unlike the Ordensburgs of the Teutonic Order. A knight, defending his land and the peasantry which serves it, connected to the soil and the Nation he is a part of, for he has to protect it with his own arms - this is the ideal proclaimed by the Brotherhood.\n\nWith this goal in mind, the regime has embarked on a quest to dismantle and destroy the Landsgemeinde, replacing them with new estates drawn and land redistributed in favour of the Baltic Germans. These rural communes, democratic Latvian and Estonian peasant communities, would often resist the transformation by force, requiring Landeswehr intervention and often brutal measures to prevent the spread of unrest. Though Otto von Kursell and his government assumed that Baltic Germans would flock from the cities to help build this propagandised rural life, few were interest in the prospect - thus hundreds of them had to be moved into the countryside by force."
 KRBAT.114.a: "For the National Revival!"

 KRBAT.115.t: "The Dvinsk Autonomous Region"
 KRBAT.115.d.szrs: "The Dvinsk Autonomy was established in 1935 by President Savinkov's decree as proof that his Russia would not only be for ethnic Russians, but for all peoples. Previously an autonomous gubernia, this upgrade into full autonomy was in practice propaganda trick, meant to prove the Latvians and Estonians on the other side of the border that 'Free Latvia in Free Russia' was true.\n\nThe Latgale region had seen flourishing of Latvian and Latgalian culture in the 1920s, but it had nonetheless became stronghold for SZRS, thanks to the Latvian Nationalist Union being Savinkov's and Gopper's early ally. The local Duma, called 'Latviešu Centrālā Padome', was the first legislative body in Russia to cooperate with SZRS already in 1928. Savinkov's old collague, Frīdrihs Briedis was elected as the Commissar of Dvinsk early, and has since then became essentially a dictator of the autonomy. Small party-state within Russia, Briedis' regime shows the national zeal that will one day free all of Latvia!"
 KRBAT.115.a: "To Russo-Latvian friendship!"

 KRBAT.116.t: "The Fall of Germany"
 KRBAT.116.d: "Ominous news have arrived to Riga - the German titan has fallen. Overwhelmed by enemy onslaught, its armies have finally surrendered, the Kaiser and his government have escaped overseas, and its lands have been occupied. An era in world history comes to an end, and nowhere else is this impact felt more deeply than in the Baltic states, which had relied upon its brothers in the Reich for so long.\n\nNow, with the Reichswehr fallen, the Baltic Germans are alone in the world, besieged by all sides, and only a miracle can possibly save them from destruction. Will the Kaiser and the survivors return to save them, will an unexpected third force enter the war and swing the tide in their favour? Even the most optimistic in the government and in the Baltische Landeswehr cannot shake off the fear of the future. Soldiers march to their posts with grim determination and public officials respond to questions with an ever so slight tinge of dread.\n\nAnd yet, while many at least considered the possibility of defection or surrender, just as many remain stalwart in their posts. After all, there is no point in being afraid of the inevitable."
 KRBAT.116.a: "This is our darkest hour."
 KRBAT.116.b: "We will resist to the bitter end!"

 KRBAT.117.t: "Schiemann's Speech"
 KRBAT.117.d: "Throughout the past few years, the Baltic German Democratic Party has assumed a dominant role in the country. Because of this, the party has ballooned in numbers - and while these new recruits are welcome, they also dilute Paul Schiemann's message. Many of them believe in Western style liberal democracy, whose equalised representation of every person stands against his ideal of meritocratic statehood. Now that the Constitutional Convention has begun, he has risen to the podium of the Party headquarters to make a speech and set the party on the right track.\n\nThere, he has spoken about the need for the education of mankind and Baltics specifically, and the simple fact of life that it falls upon the educated and the professional to lead. In no other situation would the voice of a professor and a cleaning maid be the same weight - and so they should not be the same weight in politics. For the good of the Baltics, a corporatist meritocratic system needs to be put in place in the Constitutional Convention, no matter what it takes.\n\nThe elderly politician has said his word, and now it falls to the audience to decide whether they shall follow him or declare a soft coup in the Democratic Party."
 KRBAT.117.a: "The audience cheers in favour!"
 BAT_will_limit_our_options: "This will limit our options in the Convention to ensure adherence to Schiemann's vision."
 KRBAT.117.b: "The audience does not approve! No more Schiemann!"

 KRBAT.118.t: "Adiamünde Commune"
 KRBAT.118.d: "Following the Rural Commune acts after the abolition of serfdom in the Baltic provinces, Latvian and Estonian peasantry began to organise into rural communes, the Landgemeinde, which were granted autonomy, democratic self-government and certain powers as well as privileges. Here, a generation of peasants have grown up in largely autonomous and democratic conditions, able to foster their native culture and participate in the process of government.\n\nSometimes, however, these rights can go too far. In the Adiamünde Parish, also known to Latvians as Skulte, the local Landgemeinde has elected Pēteris Briedis as its new elder. Briedis, an inhabitant of the parish who moved to Riga to work in its naval dockyards and joined its trade union movement, is a self-proclaimed Syndicalist, and was elected by the commune with a platform of implementing Syndicalism for the people. While the idea that Syndicalism could be implemented in a small collection of villages would frustrate a left-wing ideologue, this does not affect the locals one bit, who have avowed to build a classless society without exploitation in the heart of the United Baltic Duchy.\n\nThis \"Adiamünde Commune\" has gained mass exposure in Baltic press, and while it is in the right of a Landgemeinde to elect the government which their inhabitants want, the Baltische Landeswehr calls for a military intervention to remove the Syndicalist local government. The \"Adiamünde Commune\" will not go down without a fight, however - much like other Landgemeinde, it keeps a small militia to defend its borders, and it seems ready to defend its Syndicalist goals."
 KRBAT.118.a: "This beating heart of Syndicalism will be destroyed!"
 KRBAT.118.b: "The rights of the Landgemeinde must not be infringed"

 KRBAT.119.t: "Composition of the new Landtag"
 KRBAT.119.d: "Following the promulgation of the Constitution, new elections are being held to the Baltic Landtag across the provinces. Having successfully transformed the nation according to their liberal vision and promulgated a constitution, the DbDP is likely to win a majority of the vote and form a government all by themselves - however, their traditional competitors in the form of Progressive, Reform and State Parties have not died down just yet, and may force the party to cooperate with one of them in a coalition."
 KRBAT.119.a: "The DbDP acquires a majority!"
 KRBAT.119.b: "The DbDP needs to work across the bench..."

 KRBAT.120.t: "Another Enemy!"
 KRBAT.120.d: "The area south of Dünaburg, the Ilūkste region is home to sizeable Polish minority that has been living there since times of the Commonwealth. Until Partitions of Poland, Dünaburg and its surroundings were an integral part of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth: the Catholic Church had a strong influence here, which contributed to a significant Polonisation of the region, especially its elites.\n\nThe Polish gentry has traditionally been supportive towards Latvian independence. They helped to arm Latvian militias during the 1905 revolution against the Tsar, whom both saw as an enemy. Due to their position on the edge of the duchy and bordering area of Russian controlled Dünaburg, there has been rising activity in arms smuggling and support is being organised in aid of the Forest Brothers uprising we are fighting against.\n\nSome accounts suggest Polish minority places hope that independent Latvia will allow them the right to develop Polish social, cultural, religious and political life and safeguard Polish nobility estates."

However, under the Duchy's political system, only the largely neutral Duke Adolf Friedrich can actually remove the government, leading to a protracted war of attrition between the two camps.\n\nAs of now, the conservative Knighthoods and Baltic German nobility have reasserted control over the Duchy.

Livland has suffered the brunt of the developing rebellion, and the Land Administrators there report that they cannot control the countryside, as the law enforcement agencies have been overrun by ad hoc partisan organisations and underground resistance groups.\n\nSupported by local farmers and defectors from the Duchy's army, these so-called 'Forest Brothers' are wreaking havoc and seeking to completely overthrow German rule in the Baltics. Riga has requested we send a detachment of temporary military police force to the Duchy to help them in their fight against the Baltic separatists.

Even before the Weltkrieg, thousands of Lithuanian, Russian and Polish workers would migrate to Riga and Reval for well paying jobs - this practice, while unpopular, needs to be restored."
 BAT_combat_immigrant_hate: "Combat Anti-Immigrant Sentiment"
 BAT_combat_immigrant_hate_desc: "Through propaganda campaigns, we need to ensure that the average Baltic German does not feel threatened by an influx of immigrants from the Reichspakt, and that any fears over losing their jobs are dissuaded."
 BAT_returnee_relief_grants: "Relief to Returnees"
 BAT_returnee_relief_grants_desc: "By establishing generous handouts to returning emigrants and providing them the support of the state for finding homes or starting businesses, we can ensure a steady stream of returnees from German cities."
 BAT_public_works: "Public Works"
 BAT_public_works_desc: "The Ducal lands carry a lot of potential, but much of it lay unimproved and uninviting to businesses. Through public works, we can renovate roads, restore decaying factories, and create room for new industries to grow."
 BAT_industrialization: "Industrialisation Priority"
 BAT_industrialization_desc: "The way forward in the modern day is a self-sufficient, vibrant industrial economy. Let us go forth and ensure that our children are the first generation beyond the plough."
 BAT_keggum: "Keggum Hydroelectric Plant"
 BAT_keggum_desc: "The Keggum Hydroelectric Plant, the first hydroelectric plant on the Dunau River, has long since been envisioned as the beating heart of an industrial Baltic society - and we are finally ready to make it operational."
 BAT_export_agriculture: "Export Agriculture"
 BAT_export_agriculture_desc: "Industrialisation needs to be funded somehow. Let us promote the production of cash crops in the countryside and provide support to farmers in order to boost agricultural production and give us an export advantage."
 BAT_hydroelectricity: "Construct Micro Hydro-Plants"
 BAT_hydroelectricity_desc: "Baltic territories hold many rivers fitting for micro-hydropower, enough to potentially make us self-sufficient with electricity. While we'd have to go a long way before accomplishing that, investment into hydropower will yield great dividends to the economy."
 BAT_estonian_shale_oil: "Estonian Shale Oil Prospects"
 BAT_estonian_shale_oil_desc: "The presence of shale oil, a low grade alternative to oil and gas, in Estonian soil has been known since the 19th century. Only now, however, have we begun to comprehend just how much potential lays in the Estonian plains. Let us go forth and turn Estonia into a second Romania!"
 BAT_sef_focus: "Walter Zapp's S.E.F."
 BAT_sef_focus_desc: "The S.E.F., or State Electronics Factory, is one of the largest industrial complexes in Riga, employing inventors such as Walter Zapp to produce complex electronic machinery, equipment and other hardware. Providing subsidies to this business and seeing it grow will only be beneficial to the state."
 BAT_railroad_commission: "National Infrastructure Commission"
 BAT_railroad_commission_desc: "The infrastructure of the Duchy remains in poor condition. Roads and railroads need to be renovated, new airfields and ports established, to connect our lands with the rest of Europe and provide the foundation for an industrial economy."
 BAT_vairogs_focus: "Paul Barons' Vairogs"
 BAT_vairogs_focus_desc: "Owned by Paul Barons, Vairogs is an automobile production company producing cars, trucks and heavy equipment under civilian and military licences alike. Subsidising this business will grant our army a critical production partner."
 BAT_modern_education: "Modern Education Programmes"
 BAT_modern_education_desc: "A state in the twentieth century must employ education programmes befitting of its century - old, antiquated education practices must be abolished and a new system built on incentivising merit and achievement, not aristocratic birth."
 BAT_efficient_management: "Efficient Industrial Management"
 BAT_efficient_management_desc: "We must encourage businesses across our country to implement the most state of the art time-saving and resource-efficient technologies and processes, increasing efficiency to unprecedented heights."
 BAT_abolish_ritterschule: "Abolish Ritter-Schulen"
 BAT_abolish_ritterschule_desc: "Ritter-Schulen, or Knightly Academies, are private schools operated by the Baltic Knighthoods for the scions of their nobility - they are a haven for reactionary thought and education there falls far below our standards. This antiquated, medieval practice must be put to an end and these schools nationalised."
 BAT_friedrich_zander: "Provide Funding to Friedrich Zander"
 BAT_friedrich_zander_desc: "Friedrich Zander is a Baltic inventor and rocket researcher who fled Moscow at the end of the Russian Civil War to settle back in his homeland and continue his work here. While his dream of 'Onwards, to Mars!' is beyond our reach, perhaps there is value to be found in his research into rockets and cruise missiles..."
 BAT_electoral_process_reform: "Establish Beisitzer-Aufsichtsrat"
 BAT_electoral_process_reform_desc: "Right now, all Cantons in the Duchy are led by a Church Office Chief with two assessors, a secular and a spiritual one, who form the collective head authority of the Canton. We need to abolish this antiquated system and establish a Beisitzer-Aufsichtsrat in each Canton - a supervisory board of professional assessors appointed by the Church Office Chief."
 BAT_meritocratic_appointment: "Enforce Meritocratic Appointment"
 BAT_meritocratic_appointment_desc: "No more should the highest bureaucratic offices be distributed by familial ties or noble status. Everyone, as long as they have the skills to do their job, should have a chance to rule the country."
 BAT_cantonal_democracy: "Impose Representative Legislatures"
 BAT_cantonal_democracy_desc: "The popular assemblies in Parishes and Cantons are direct democracies - all noble citizens are required to attend, and pay a fine if they fail to show up. This system no longer works in the 20th century - Parishes and Cantons shall have elections for representatives imposed on each and one of them."
 BAT_parliamentary_control: "Parliamentary Control"
 BAT_parliamentary_control_desc: "The Landtag should control the military and the executive government, not the other way around. Grant it the power to appoint and recall chiefs of staff and Chairmans of the Convent, as it should have received a long time ago."
 BAT_justice_appointment: "Judicial Appointment Commission"
 BAT_justice_appointment_desc: "The Duchy's byzantine judicial system needs to be reformed and new judicial appointments made not with the whim of the Landtag, but by an independent commission of justices and law experts who would pick out impartial and professional judges."
 BAT_constitutional_convention: "Call Constitutional Convention"
 BAT_constitutional_convention_desc: "It is about time that the Baltic Duchy finally acquired a permanent Constitution and joined the ranks of modern, constitutional monarchies. Call a Constitutional Convention to finally decide this matter, once and for all!"

 BAT_mobilize_landeswehr: "Mobilise the Landeswehr"
 BAT_mobilize_landeswehr_desc: "The Baltic state is in danger! Lettish and Estonian radicals, guided by the spectres of liberalism and socialism from abroad, have risen up against us! The Landeswehr must be mobilised to the last man to reestablish stability across the country."
 BAT_suspend_landtag: "Dissolve the Landtag"
 BAT_suspend_landtag_desc: "The Baltic Duchy prides itself in its complex, traditional, historically famous system of democratic self-rule and decentralised management. All of it is no longer needed. These burdens such as law and constitutional principle stand lesser to a disciplined society and absolute rule from the top."
 BAT_permanent_regency: "A Permanent Regency"
 BAT_permanent_regency_desc: "Our Duke, Adolf Friedrich I, vanished during the chaos of the Manteuffel Coup, and while we are distraught by his disappearance, we can only put this to good use. The Duke was too passive and liberal for our taste, Graf von der Goltz will rule as regent in his stead - and he will be far less soft."
 BAT_reinforce_government: "Wir Glauben, Wir Kämpfen, Wir Siegen"
 BAT_reinforce_government_desc: "We believe, we fight, we conquer. The new Baltic sacrificed for a new Germany. These are the mottos of the Baltic Brotherhood, and they shall serve as our guide in our transformation of the Baltic State."
 BAT_army_with_a_state: "An Army with a State"
 BAT_army_with_a_state_desc: "The goal of the renewed Baltic state is to subjugate itself, in its entirety, to an Eastern crusade. Its economy and society must rid itself of Mammonic capitalism and dedicate everything it can to the Landeswehr. Everything within the state. Nothing outside the state. Nothing against the state."
 BAT_national_population_registry: "National Population Registry"
 BAT_national_population_registry_desc: "Our country is facing an emigration problem, and the solution to it is simple - prevent anyone from leaving. Create a registry of all of our citizens, constantly keep it up to date and collect information on their personal lives, grant benefits to those who stay and find ways to return those who leave. Their labour is needed here, not elsewhere."
 BAT_baltische_arbeitsfront: "Baltische Arbeitsfront"
 BAT_baltische_arbeitsfront_desc: "Riga, Reval and Libau all have strong labour unions which fight for the interests of their workers and have no desire to cooperate with us. In our drive to transform the state, this particularism is too dangerous to be kept alive. Disband all independent unions and create a state-controlled Baltic Labour Front in its wake."
 BAT_mandatory_military_training: "Mandatory Military Training"
 BAT_mandatory_military_training_desc: "Every single Baltic German must have the ability to wield a gun and fight for his Heimat. We shall create mandatory paramilitary training programmes for all citizens of age and "recommend" most capable civilians to join the Baltische Landeswehr."
 BAT_state_industrialization: "State-Controlled Industrialisation"
 BAT_state_industrialization_desc: "Capitalist principles cannot bring us prosperity. The free market crushes souls and exploits citizens in the name of wealth, not national interest. Instead of that disgrace, the state must take charge in industrialisation itself, through the use of planning committees and public funding."
 BAT_full_employment: "Full Employment"
 BAT_full_employment_desc: "To be a fit person of working age and not work for your country is not only disgraceful, it should be criminal. The Baltische Arbeitsfront and the National Population Registry will allow us to tap into every single working person across the country, establish public works for them, and give them a place in the national organism."

 BAT_ersatzprogramm: "Ersatzprogramm"
 BAT_ersatzprogramm_desc: "The lifestyle of the Baltic German should not be luxurious and extravagant like in the centuries before - nor do we need to waste so many resources on natural products when cheaply made artificial substitutes are available. As little resources should go to waste and as many resources should be dedicated to the State."
 BAT_church_unity: "Unity of the Churches"
 BAT_church_unity_desc: "Today, the Christian church is divided and relishes in infighting. The Baltic Germans, whose crusader history bestows them a natural role of spiritual guidance for Europe, must champion a unity of the Catholic and Protestant churches on their soil, unite all forces of religious renewal and direct them to a joint enemy in the East."
 BAT_subsume_brotherhood: "Subsume the VdBR into the Brotherhood"
 BAT_subsume_brotherhood_desc: "The Baltic Knighthoods have long since resisted the ultimate goal of the Baltic Germans. While our traditions are what make us unique, we must not blindly cling to them. Infiltrate the Knighthoods and staff them with loyal Brothers in order to subjugate them to our side."
 BAT_alcohol_prohibition: "Prohibition of the Vices"
 BAT_alcohol_prohibition_desc: "Alcohol, cigarettes, gambling, impure thoughts all make men sin and thus cast them out of Heaven. To protect our people from such a fate, and transform them into morally upright citizens, we must take the fight to these vices and crack down on them, one by one."
 BAT_religious_education: "Religious Education"
 BAT_religious_education_desc: "The Brotherhood should have full control of the curriculum and use it as means of integrating the new generation into their order. They must learn the truth about their heroic, crusader-like history, and the tenets of moral life as well as religious belief. The primary goal of education should be to turn pupils into dutiful, disciplined, patriotic citizens."
 BAT_reform_bureaucracy: "Reform the Bureaucracy"
 BAT_reform_bureaucracy_desc: "The Baltic administrative apparatus is complex and decentralised, and lacks professional personnel. We should hire experts and administrators from Germany to not only improve administrative efficiency, but also bring us closer to the Fatherland."
 BAT_harmonize_laws: "Harmonise Laws with Germany"
 BAT_harmonize_laws_desc: "We must integrate ourselves into the greater Germanic political sphere by adopting German legal, administrative, and economic systems in the Baltic state. The experience of the Reich Germans can definitely be of use here."
 BAT_community_help: "Establish Community Help Associations"
 BAT_community_help_desc: "It is the nature of a good Christian to help others and provide relief for those less fortunate, and it is the duty of a member of the Baltic Brotherhood to do so. We must institutionalise this practice to allow the community to help each other persist."
 BAT_social_welfare: "Social Welfare"
 BAT_social_welfare_desc: "The Baltic state has a duty to provide for its citizens, to give them support in life and to show Christian compassion - towards those who are loyal, of course. This may divert needed resources from the military, but it will keep our country stable."
 BAT_agents_among_people: "Agents Among the People"
 BAT_agents_among_people_desc: "There is a secret reason behind our acts of welfare. Through community help associations and welfare institutions, members of the Brotherhood can easily investigate the thoughts of the populace from up close, and root out the seditious without mercy."
 BAT_degenerate_art: "Censor Modern Art"
 BAT_degenerate_art_desc: "Modern art is not only degenerate and un-Christian, but rooted in villainous, Syndicalist thought. There is no reason for our people to ever experience it - our censorship offices will ensure that only morally upright material reaches the press."
 BAT_end_to_soul_theft: "Proclaim an End to Soul Theft"
 BAT_end_to_soul_theft_desc: "Anglo-Saxonic soul theft, which calls itself Capitalism and Syndicalism and ruthlessly exploits the national body, is the greatest villain of our time - and with a thorough transformation of the state according to the principles of the Baltic Brotherhood, we have finally put an end to its practices."
 BAT_ideological_exchange: "Ideological Exchange with Germany"
 BAT_ideological_exchange_desc: "Everything we have done, it is in the name of a new Germany, its national rebirth, and it is time to witness the fruit of our labour. We must present ourselves as an example to German nationalists, a success story of our ideology placed upon a pedestal, which shall lead the way to a new age."
 BAT_conscription_squads: "Conscription Squads"
 BAT_conscription_squads_desc: "Not everyone in our country is willing to serve in the Landeswehr and fulfil their duty to the country. They defect, hide from the service, and find ways to excuse themselves. These stragglers must be found and forced to serve, if that's what is necessary."
 BAT_ideological_commissars: "Ideological Commissars"
 BAT_ideological_commissars_desc: "Our soldiers must know the true nature of their struggle. They must know that they fight not just for their lives or their families, but for the final battle for the fate of Europe and the great conquest of the East. Our political line must permeate the rank and file and the officer corps."
 BAT_drang_nach_osten: "Drang Nach Osten!"
 BAT_drang_nach_osten_desc: "The Baltic territories have been completely transformed according to the vision of the Baltic Brotherhood. Only the final stage remains - a militant missionary mission against Russia and the Syndicalists, the conquest of East and West, and Germany's rise to lead a new, reformed, Christian Europe. And the Baltics will be their loyal second-in-command."

 BAT_new_landratskollegium: "A New Landratskollegium"
 BAT_new_landratskollegium_desc: "At long last, the reins of government in the Duchy have been given to responsible servants of the noble Baltic German people. A new Landratskollegium composed by the Baltic Knighthoods will stabilise the situation in the state and pave the way for reforms."
 BAT_livland_credit_society: "Livländische GüterCredit-Sozietät"
 BAT_livland_credit_society_desc: "Operating in Riga, the Livland Goods Credit Society is the largest of all credit societies operated by the Baltic Knighthoods. We must restore it and grant it additional support to provide our ailing economy with loans."
 BAT_landschaft_kreditwesen: "Landschaftliche Kreditwesen"
 BAT_landschaft_kreditwesen_desc: "Originated in Prussia, the Landschaft credit system is a system of support for agrarian estates and Junker holdings, and they have maintained a presence in the Baltics since the 18th century. This system must be renewed and restored to fit the needs of the modern day."
 BAT_agricultural_tariffs: "Tariffs on Agricultural Imports"
 BAT_agricultural_tariffs_desc: "Agricultural production is the lifeblood of the Baltic economy and must be protected. We must institute tariffs on agricultural imports to protect local producers while raising additional revenue for the budget."
 BAT_social_charity: "Social Charity Propaganda"
 BAT_social_charity_desc: "The Baltic nobility, as generous as it is, must provide a portion of their wealth for the common man. We must pressure the nobles in Knighthood lists to donate to charities and other private welfare programmes for the good of the state."
 BAT_machine_stations: "Machine and Tractor Stations"
 BAT_machine_stations_desc: "To drastically improve the efficiency of agriculture, we must provide estates with mechanised equipment. Establish a system of tractor stations across the Baltics where tractors and other agricultural machines may be rented by the locals."

 BAT_sciences_patronage: "Patronage of Arts and Sciences"
 BAT_sciences_patronage_desc: "The lands of the Baltics have given many greats in sciences and will surely give many greats in the centuries to come. It falls to the nobility to carry the duty of promoting these bright men, however, give them funding and support to have their ideas see the light of day."
 BAT_landpolizeibehorden: "Reform the Landpolizeibehörden"
 BAT_landpolizeibehorden_desc: "The Landpolizeibehörden are the traditional law enforcement authorities of the Baltic region, subordinate to the legal system - aside from standard law enforcement duties, they oversee road construction, collection of statistical information, and other duties. This organisation must be reformed and worry itself solely with law enforcement instead."
 BAT_landtag_barrier: "Revise the Landtag Barrier of Entry"
 BAT_landtag_barrier_desc: "Everything was ruined when we started to allow all these commoners in the Landtag, our generosity to the lower classes has gotten us burned instead. No more! From here on out, the Landtag shall be a legislature for and by the blue-blooded classes!"
 BAT_ostsee_law_archive: "Ostsee Law Archive Committee"
 BAT_ostsee_law_archive_desc: "Provincial Ostsee Law serves as the backbone of our legal system and we must protect it. Establish an Archive Committee which shall explain the intricacies of the law to the public and to the courts, while also being allowed to make slight amendments in accordance with modern times."
 BAT_banish_schiemann: "Banish Schiemann, Again"
 BAT_banish_schiemann_desc: "In 1917, the Livonian Knighthood banished that troublemaker Schiemann to Germany for his constant conflict with the nobility. It is time to do so again and send him back to Germany a second time - without a leader, the liberals will soon dissolve."
 BAT_ban_secret_societies: "Force Secret Societies into the Open"
 BAT_ban_secret_societies_desc: "There are rumours of secret societies, such as one called the Baltic Brotherhood, operating among our own in secret and spreading seditious ideas. We must do everything in our power to force them in the open and confront them with the might of the law."
 BAT_landeswehr_noble_appointments: "Noble Landeswehr Appointments"
 BAT_landeswehr_noble_appointments_desc: "The Baltische Landeswehr turned quite unruly during the Forest Brothers uprising - clearly, some of them are harbouring less than acceptable ideas. We must filter their influence out by pushing through more loyal nobles to leading positions in the Landeswehr staff."
 BAT_devolution: "Announce Devolution"
 BAT_devolution_desc: "The government of the United Baltic Duchy has turned inefficient, decadent, byzantine. There is a solution to this conundrum, however. It is time to put an end to overreach from Riga and give the local governments in the Baltic provinces full power over local administration!"
 BAT_devolve_curonia: "Restore the House of Biron"
 BAT_devolve_curonia_desc: "The Curonian House of Biron once reigned over the duchy of Courland-Semigallia, and their dynasty is still alive, represented by the pretender Gustav Biron. It is time for us to finally fulfil the wishes of the Curonian nobles and restore their birthright!"
 BAT_devolve_livonia: "Bow to the Duke of Livonia"
 BAT_devolve_livonia_desc: "Adolf Friedrich of Mecklenburg, Duke of the United Baltic Duchy, is the only rightful claimant to the title of Duke of Livonia.

 BAT_devolve_estonia: "Reach out to the Danes"
 BAT_devolve_estonia_desc: "Estonia has historically been in the Scandinavian sphere of influence and many of their nobles are proud to bear Danish or Swedish blood. Denmark is a close ally of Germany, as well. Let us borrow a member of the Danish royal house, Prince Harald, to assume the throne of the Duchy of Estland!"
 BAT_devolved_education: "A Ritterschule for Every Knighthood"
 BAT_devolved_education_desc: "The Baltic Knighthoods have a tradition of local education programmes for their scion - but this system is not equal. Reval and Riga have Ritterschule, but the other Knighthoods do not, and many poorer nobles are unable to enrol. We should grant the provinces full jurisdiction in education policy to provide where the central government cannot."
 BAT_devolved_culture: "Devolved Cultural Liberties"
 BAT_devolved_culture_desc: "The Baltic lands are diverse, and the central government cannot possibly protect the rights of everyone. The local provinces must be given the right to decide cultural rights and liberties in their lands for themselves, thus more easily integrating the locals into the Baltic Duchy."
 BAT_devolved_economics: "Devolved Economic Policy"
 BAT_devolved_economics_desc: "Policies which help the Estonian economy have little effect in Livland or Courland, and vice versa. The central government cannot make the right decisions on economic affairs - the local governments must be given the right to decide it for themselves."
 BAT_united_baltic_duchies: "The United Baltic Duchies"
 BAT_united_baltic_duchies_desc: "The United Baltic Duchy is not one, but rather a union of many. Baltic Germans of all alignment, Letts and Estonians, can all be proud to live in a state where the governments are close to home and the central government enshrines long standing tradition."

 BAT_ostwallprogramm: "Ostwallprogramm"

 BAT_construction_material: "Purchase Material"
 BAT_construction_material_desc: "It pains to admit that we will not be able to construct everything we might wish to see in our project all by our own merit. This is where our allies come in. Through contacts in Germany, we need to purchase more material for the Ostwall and our armed forces."
 BAT_redoubt_question: "Redoubt Question"
 BAT_redoubt_question_desc: "There will come a time when, no matter how much we build up the Ostwall, that the Russians break through. If such a thing happens, we need a redoubt - and for that, we must decide what this redoubt should be."
 BAT_doctrine_think_tanks: "New Doctrine Think Tanks"

 BAT_mobility_doctrine_desc: "The advent of mass motorisation and modern tank designs have shifted military focus towards armoured spearheads and combined arms warfare. We must reform the Landeswehr from the roots to adapt to this new way of thinking."
 BAT_fireteam_organization: "Fireteam Organisation"
 BAT_fireteam_organization_desc: "We must organise our soldiers into small teams of four or five men, operating by task and implementing fire-and-movement tactics in the heat of battle, much like German Stoßtruppen. The motivation to protect or support one's friends in a small squad trumps any abstract concepts."
 BAT_abandon_horse: "Abandon the Horse-Drawn Carriage"
 BAT_abandon_horse_desc: "The logistics system of the army should be modernised and carriages replaced with trucks, for faster and more effective transportation of materiel."
 BAT_oil_supply_infrastructure: "Modern Fuel Supply Infrastructure"
 BAT_oil_supply_infrastructure_desc: "A modern, motorised army required a steady supply of fuel in order to support it. Research into synthetic fuel and construction of dedicated fuel storage bases will serve as a fine start."
 BAT_shared_doctrine_development: "Share Doctrine Development"
 BAT_shared_doctrine_development_desc: "We should not only develop a modern army doctrine, but share our achievements with our allies in the Reichspakt as well - studying their own achievements at the same time and implementing their breakthroughs."

 BAT_seek_native_talent_desc: "Latvians and Estonians rarely choose to serve in the Landeswehr, even though, as we're forced to admit, many of their graduates and junior officers have bright ideas on how to reform the military and make it more inclusive. We should hear them out."
 BAT_vilensky_graduates: "Recall Vilensky Graduates"
 BAT_vilensky_graduates_desc: "The Vilna Military Academy of the Russian era saw thousands of graduates, including many Baltic ones. Abolishing any limits on native Baltic officer advancement and recruiting these veterans to our service will lead us very far."

 BAT_expand_latvian_units: "Expand Lettish Regiments"
 BAT_expand_latvian_units_desc: "The Latvians, the largest ethnic group in the Duchy, must have adequate representation in the Landeswehr - new Latvian regiments in the army must be founded and old ones expanded to grant this representation."
 BAT_standard_artillery_templates: "Standardise Artillery Templates"
 BAT_standard_artillery_templates_desc: "The Weltkrieg has taught us that artillery will remain a staple of the modern battlefield. We must begin domestic artillery piece production and establish standardised artillery templates to ensure sufficient quality."
 BAT_hurricane_bombardment: "Hurricane Bombardment"
 BAT_hurricane_bombardment_desc: "We must gear artillery production and implementation to short, but powerful and overwhelming bombings, blowing through holes in enemy lines and allowing infantry to infiltrate and push through."
 BAT_german_language_courses: "German Language Courses"
 BAT_german_language_courses_desc: "Many bright ideas within our military are lost because of linguistics issues. We must establish universal and mandatory German language courses to enforce a single language upon the military and thus improve communication."
 BAT_riga_national_military_academy: "Riga National Military Academy"

 BAT_special_forces: "Special Forces Integration"
 BAT_special_forces_desc: "Trained for specific tasks, special forces are swiftly becoming an important asset in modern military forces. While the Baltic Duchy may be too small to field a significant force of specialised divisions, integrating them into the army structure is vital nonetheless."
 BAT_generals_school: "Militärische Planungskurse"
 BAT_generals_school_desc: "Let us start courses on operations planning in the Academy and drill one principle into the heads of our cadets - plans may be useless, but planning is indispensable."
 BAT_air_courses: "Air Pilot Courses"
 BAT_air_courses_desc: "No war in the modern day can be won without air superiority. We must establish permanent native air pilot courses to train a new generation of flying aces."

 BAT_western_air_doctrine: "Study Western Air Doctrine"
 BAT_western_air_doctrine_desc: "In the skies, your equipment and numbers are not the only thing that matters. How you apply both of these things tactically matters just as much, if not more. We must research the advancements Western nations have made in air doctrine."

 BAT_land_sea_cooperation: "Land-Sea Cooperation"
 BAT_land_sea_cooperation_desc: "The navy is only as useful as it allows troops on the ground to fight without hindrance - and as time passes, cooperation between land and sea forces turns more and more critical in warfare. We cannot dismiss this as merely a fad, modern militaries require marine detachments."
 BAT_eastern_vanguard: "Eastern Vanguard of the German Order"
 BAT_eastern_vanguard_desc: "Sporting the most modern military force in the Reichspakt, the Baltic state is truly the vanguard of the Germanic order, its stalwart defence against any enemies which may come from the East. And we must act upon this role."

 RIG_starting_focus: "The Pearl of the Baltic"
 RIG_starting_focus_desc: "The Free City of Riga stands as the last remnant of the Baltic German nation. Called 'Pearl of the Baltic', Riga has been the crown of the Baltic states for the last seven hundred years, and no matter what, we shall protect this crown from those clawing towards it."

 RIG_refugee_committees: "Committee of Former Landtag Members"
 RIG_refugee_committees_desc: "The former Landtag of the Baltic Duchy has found itself dissolved and powerless in the aftermath of the Duchy's collapse. Some of its members have gathered to an advisory committee next to the Riga City Council, but it falls to us to decide how much power they have."
 RIG_knighthoods_question: "The Livonian Knighthood"
 RIG_knighthoods_question_desc: "The former Livonian Knighthood, headquartered in Riga, has too been left powerless by the fall of the Baltic Duchy. This noble institution, which once strangled any hope for true democracy in the country, is now under our mercy."
 RIG_mass_housing: "Mass Social Housing"
 RIG_mass_housing_desc: "The flood of refugees from outside the city has shown the limits of our city planning and residential areas. We need to construct more affordable, mass social housing to provide shelter to our enlarged population."
 RIG_form_city_militias: "From Militias to an Army"
 RIG_form_city_militias_desc: "During the Forest Brothers rebellion, the Baltic German population in Riga spontaneously organised into citizen militias in order to defend themselves from the Latvian rebels. These militias are not enough, only a real army can protect Riga from destruction."

 RIG_declare_independence_desc: "Having finally restored some semblance of order in Riga, we can put the pessimism of our peoples to rest and make our way to a brighter tomorrow, no matter what it might hold. The last bastion of the Germanic nation in the East shall never fall!"

 RIG_formalize_rigaer_rat_desc: "Liquidated in 1889, the Rigaer Rat was restored after the Weltkrieg and has become the primary method of popular representation in Riga. Partially elected, it serves as the government's means of cooperation with the upper class. This institution needs to be given additional powers."
 RIG_central_banking: "Establish Central Banking"
 RIG_central_banking_desc: "To this day, the Baltic Germans do not have a central bank. A central banking system for Riga will allow its small business class to more easily fund new ventures and invest in more efficient production."

 RIG_herder_institut_desc: "Founded by the Herder Society, the Herder Institute in Riga is a prestigious academy which offers education to the Baltic German minority in the city. It needs to be opened to te general public and given additional funding to help form a strong local research and development sector."

 RIG_germanic_outpost: "Reichsvorposten Riga"
 RIG_germanic_outpost_desc: "Controlled by the German military garrison, Max Erwin von Scheubner-Richter sets the task of preparing the city for the reconquest of Latvia and Estonia above all else.

 RIG_revanchist_propaganda_desc: "Every citizen of Riga must know two things - that the Latvian threat is always present, but that they are a degenerate dictatorship which will be easy to defeat once we do come to blows. Reality matters little when we need to rouse patriotism among our peers."
 RIG_secret_police: "Secret Police"
 RIG_secret_police_desc: "Once we return to Courland and Livland, the natives, duped by the Latvian revolutionaries, are sure to oppose us. To ensure that they do not overthrow us again, we must prepare countermeasures in advance - and a secret police rooting out these separatists is exactly what we need."
 RIG_local_gun_workshops: "Local Gun Workshops"
 RIG_local_gun_workshops_desc: "In preparation for war, we must expand our meagre weapons production facilities and establish a network of small scale workshops, each one of which will be able to produce and repair rifles for army use and thus leave our production sector more resilient."
 RIG_scavenge_equipment: "Scavenge Equipment Stockpiles"
 RIG_scavenge_equipment_desc: "The chaotic collapse of the Duchy means that much of the Baltische Landeswehr's armament remains dispersed across the city and surrounding countryside, stashed away in cellars and warehouses.

 RIG_underground_tunnels: "Underground Defence Tunnels"
 RIG_underground_tunnels_desc: "While we still have time, we should put the Riga sewers and tunnel systems to use - if we can put them to use for supply transport and underground movement of troops, our Free City will be able to endure any attack."

 RIG_open_borders_desc: "Latvia has been overtaken by a dictatorship and Estonia is verging on one. Many of their citizens, even if they are patriots, would much rather live in a liberal democracy. We should open our borders and let these immigrants come."
 RIG_nationalize_trams: "Nationalise the Tram System"
 RIG_nationalize_trams_desc: "The tram system in Riga has served the city for decades, and yet its private organisation leads to several issues, because of them the potential of this public transport system remains unfulfilled.

 RIG_starting_military: "Riga City Defence Force"
 RIG_starting_military_desc: "We cannot rely solely on the German occupation force to provide protection. They can always end up recalled, or simply prove to be too small against a fully operational Latvian army. A city defence force is necessary to get us over the edge."
 RIG_form_officer_corps: "Gather Exiled Landeswehr Officers"
 RIG_form_officer_corps_desc: "The officer corps of the Baltische Landeswehr ended up scattered after the fall of the Duchy, many of them settled in Riga or in Germany. We must find them, gather them, and recruit them to serve as the backbone of the Riga City Defence Force."
 RIG_defense_planning: "Enemies on All Sides"

Gunboats on the river will grant us critical reconnaissance on the enemy and fire support against Latvian positions as well."
 RIG_artillery_posts: "Set Up Artillery Positions"
 RIG_artillery_posts_desc: "We need to be smart with the little resources we have. The Artillery pieces we have retrieved from the Landeswehr need to be placed in strategic positions across the city and plan which streets and roads each one of them will cover."
 RIG_field_hospitals: "Establish Field Hospitals"
 RIG_field_hospitals_desc: "Soldiers among our ranks are few and far between, therefore we must preserve as many of them as we can. Bandages, field surgeries, and painkillers can go far to keep them fighting for longer."
 RIG_counteroffensive_preparations: "Counter-Strike Preparations"
 RIG_counteroffensive_preparations_desc: "As much as we may plan for defending the city from foreign assault, we can never forget that our birthright extends to the entirety of the former Baltic Duchy.

 RIG_integrate_estonia_desc: "The Second Republic of Estonia has gone the way of the first - a brief period of independence, followed by a return to the Baltic German fold. Hopefully, they learn their lesson, but for now, we should restore civilian administration in Estonia."
 RIG_balts_rehabilitation: "Rehabilitate the Rank-and-File"
 RIG_balts_rehabilitation_desc: "While the leaders of the Latvian and Estonian states wished for our destruction and many of their underlings were similarly nationalist, many others simply fought for their homes and wanted a calm, simple life, no matter who are the rulers. They can be safely integrated, especially as we shall guarantee the Latvians and Estonians their rights."
 RIG_republican_landeswehr: "A Republican Landeswehr"
 RIG_republican_landeswehr_desc: "[BAT.republican_landeswehr_dynamic_desc]"
 RIG_republican_landeswehr_dynamic_normal: "The old Baltische Landeswehr was rife with Baltic German supremacism, unpopular with the general population, yet effective. Now that the Baltics are once again reunited under our guidance, we have restored the Landeswehr with all of the efficiency and none of the hatred."
 RIG_republican_landeswehr_dynamic_nationalist: "Despite the inability of the old Baltische Landeswehr to protect the German people of the baltics from the crisis which split the old duchy apart, the instituion still has a great many supporters and admirers, who note its effectiveness and the important place it had in ensuring the place of the German people in the baltics. Now that the Baltics are once again under our rightful control, we shall restore the Landeswehr to its old effectiveness and have it serve as a pillar of our rule."

 RIG_estonia_shale_oil: "Estonia Shale Oil Prospects"
 RIG_estonia_shale_oil_desc: "The presence of shale oil, a low grade alternative to oil and gas, in Estonian soil has been known since the 19th century. Only now, however, have we begun to comprehend just how much potential lays in the Estonian plains. Let us go forth and turn Estonia into a second Romania!"
 RIG_national_infrastructure_commission: "National Infrastructure Commission"

 RIG_sef_focus_desc: "The S.E.F., or State Electronics Factory, is one of the largest industrial complexes in Riga, employing inventors such as Walter Zapp to produce complex electronic machinery, equipment and other hardware.

 RIG_vairogs_focus: "Paul Barons' Vairogs"
 RIG_vairogs_focus_desc: "Owned by Paul Barons, Vairogs is an automobile production company producing cars, trucks and heavy equipment under civilian and military licences alike. Subsidising this business will grant our army a critical production partner."

 BAT_GER_found_faction_desc: "Now that we have consolidated our grip over Germany, it is time for us to export our revolution. It is said that Germany shall be the leader of a new, revived Europe, and wage crusades against Syndicalists and Russians alike - and we shall do so by force."

 BAT_GER_syndicalist_crusade_desc: "Like a disease, Syndicalism continues to crop up across Europe. This poison shall be cured and the souls languishing under Syndicalists saved - by military intervention. Wherever the left may rear its head, we will strike and decapitate it."
 BAT_GER_russia_crusade: "Die Ostbewegung"

 BAT_GER_find_allies_desc: "After the fall of the German Empire, its hegemony in Central Europe collapsed. States which used to be our allies parted ways and began charting their own, independent course. This is unacceptable. By blood and steel, we will carve out a hegemony in Central Europe once again."
 BAT_GER_new_reichswehr: "The New Reichsheer"
 BAT_GER_new_reichswehr_desc: "The Baltische Landeswehr shall serve as the core tutor of a new army for the German nation, a force which will be strong enough to protect its interests worldwide. Of all the Germanic nations, the Baltic Germans have historically been immersed in warfare most, so this role is natural."
 BAT_GER_baltic_model: "Implement the Baltic Model"
 BAT_GER_baltic_model_desc: "The so-called 'Baltic model' of fireteam organisation has proven to be effective in modern war. We need to implement it in the Reichsheer as well, and divide all soldiers into small, tightly-knit fireteams to bolster their efficiency."
 BAT_GER_post_wk2_tech: "Legacy of the Second Weltkrieg"
 BAT_GER_post_wk2_tech_desc: "The Second Weltkrieg has come and went, and with it, the future of warfare has come. Modern tanks, airplanes, and tactics are now common in the battlefield, all of which we must study and implement in the new Reichsheer."

 BAT_GER_blood_and_soil_desc: "German land is bound to German blood, and not only should Germans return to a simpler, rural way of life, we need to expand this 'living space' to the fertile lands of the East - there, enslaving the local Slavs, Germany will find utopia.

### Ideas ###

 BAT_byzantine_government: "Byzantine Political System"
 BAT_byzantine_government_desc: "The political system of the United Baltic Duchy is based upon centuries of tradition, stemming from the Livonian Confederation or, in some cases, even earlier. The system of semi-direct representation through Landtags, an enduring loyalty to Provincial Ostsee Civil Law, and the autonomous nature of the Baltic Knighthoods, are all undoubtedly a part of the Baltic German identity - and yet, it is a system in dire need of reform."

 BAT_parliamentary_control_idea: "Parliamentary Control"
 BAT_parliamentary_control_idea_desc: "Decision-making power in the Duchy has been centralised in the Landtag, allowing it to exert control over the Landeswehr and the Convent of Land Administrators, thus eroding the power of the Baltic Knighthoods."

 BAT_landeswehr: "The Baltische Landeswehr"
 BAT_landeswehr_desc: "The Baltic Territorial Army is the volunteer defence force of the United Baltic Duchy, formed in 1918 under the guidance of German commander Rüdiger von der Goltz. It is ethnically segregated between Baltic German, Latvian, Estonian and Russian units, and unpopular with the native majority population. This has pressed the Landeswehr to reform and modernise to make up for its manpower shortages. Largely independent of civilian oversight, and for good reason, it is efficient and innovative, considered to be the most elite force in the Reichspakt."

 RIG_landeswehr: "The New Baltische Landeswehr"
 RIG_landeswehr_desc: "The old Baltische Landeswehr was rife with Baltic German supremacism, unpopular with the general population, yet effective. Now that the Baltics are once again reunited under our guidance, we have restored the Landeswehr with all of the efficiency and none of the hatred."

 BAT_emigration: "Emigration"
 BAT_emigration_desc: "All citizens of the United Baltic Duchy are able to move to and work in the German Empire without inhibition, and vice versa. Two decades ago, it was believed that this would foster German colonisation of the Baltic states via immigrants from the Heimat. It has had the opposite result, however - young Baltic Germans move to Berlin, Saxony and the Ruhr in search of a living, abandoning their family homes."

 BAT_emigration_2: "Mass Emigration"
 BAT_emigration_2_desc: "All citizens of the United Baltic Duchy are able to move to and work in the German Empire without inhibition, and vice versa. Now that an economic crisis has set in our country, thousands are making their way to the Empire in search of a living, deepening our already crippling labour force problems."

 BAT_emigration_3: "Controlled Emigration"
 BAT_emigration_3_desc: "All citizens of the United Baltic Duchy are able to move to and work in the German Empire without inhibition, and vice versa. Because of this, young Baltic Germans move to Berlin, Saxony and the Ruhr in search of a living, abandoning their family homes - however, this process has been somewhat put under control."

 BAT_black_monday_2_desc: "The economic crisis sparked by the Black Monday stock market crash is severely affecting our country."

 BAT_dualism: "Dualism"
 BAT_dualism_desc: "The antiquated, nightmarish government system of the Duchy and the stubbornness of Chairman von Samson-Himmelstjerna combined have led to a period of §YDualism§! setting in our country. The Democratic Party lacks a majority in the Landtag and has no way of pushing through laws or projects, as they do not have legislative initiative or Landtag dissolution powers, but the conservative controlled Landtag has no way of removing the incumbent Convent from power, as that requires the assent of the Knighthoods and the Duke, not them. A power struggle has thus broken out within the upper echelons of government and needs to be resolved lest our country falls into anarchy.\n\n§YEnables Dualism Decisions.\nWhile the Dualism mechanic is active, we will only be able to choose Baltische Landeswehr focuses in our focus tree, but they will not cost any Political Power per turn.§!"

 BAT_national_unity_armistice: "National Unity Armistice"
 BAT_national_unity_armistice_desc: "A political armistice has been negotiated in the halls of the Landtag. No infighting between the liberal executive and conservative legislature can take place when the security of the Duchy is at hand."

 BAT_bailout: "Business Bailout"

### Decisions ###

 BAT_dualism_decision_category: "Dualism"
 BAT_dualism_decision_category_desc: "The antiquated, nightmarish government system of the Duchy and the stubbornness of Chairman von Samson-Himmelstjerna combined have led to a period of §YDualism§! setting in our country. The Democratic Party lacks a majority in the Landtag and has no way of pushing through laws or projects, as they do not have legislative initiative or Landtag dissolution powers, but the conservative controlled Landtag has no way of removing the incumbent Convent from power, as that requires the assent of the Knighthoods and the Duke, not them. A power struggle has thus broken out within the upper echelons of government and needs to be resolved lest our country falls into anarchy.\n\nWhile §YDualism§! is active, it is impossible to gain £pol_power §YPolitical Power§! normally - it may only be gained through £decision_icon_small §YDecisions§!, in which you can make various concessions to parliamentary groups in order to receive their support. You need to receive a specific number of £pol_power §YPolitical Power§! before Duke Adolf Friedrich loses all faith in the liberal dream... while keeping track of your £stability_texticon §YStability§! - should it dip below a certain point, this rotten structure may finally collapse."
 BAT_duke_timer: "The Palace Takes Note"

 BAT_forest_brothers_decision_category_desc: "A mass insurgency has broken out in the United Baltic Duchy. Hundreds of Latvians and Estonians leave their lives to join the Forest Brothers, an underground partisan resistance organisation with the goal of evicting Baltic German rule from the region once and for all. The continued existence of the Duchy now depends on whether the government and the Baltische Landeswehr will be able to contain the insurgency in time.\n\nThe strength and growth of the Forest Brothers movement is represented by £pol_violence §YResistance§! in Latvian and Estonian states. It may be combatted via normal resistance mechanics or spending £pol_power §YPolitical Power§! to enact anti-partisan measures. Resistance needs to dip below 25 percent for the Forest Brothers uprising to finally recede - should Resistance reach 70 percent, on the other hand, the situation will reach critical mass and lead to the collapse of the Duchy. Additionaly, Resistance will increase more rapidly if it climbs above 50.\n\nThe current average £pol_violence §YResistance§! is §R[?BAT_total_resistance|0]%§!, updated every week by §YThe Ticking Clock§! decision."

 BAT_max_von_scheubner_richter: "Max Erwin von Scheubner-Richter"
 BAT_max_von_scheubner_richter_leader_desc: "§YBorn:§! §LJanuary 21st, 1884, in Riga, Riga District, Livonia Governorate, Russian Empire§!\n§YBackground:§! §LLudwig Maximilian Erwin Richter was born to a German musician in Riga, adding the second last name \"Scheubner\" after marrying into a family of Baltic German nobility and getting adopted by one of his wife's relatives. Though he first lived in Russia, Scheubner-Richter ended up moving to Munich to complete his chemistry studies. Later, he volunteered for the army of his new homeland when the Weltkrieg began. However, he did not serve on the front lines for long. Once his superiors caught note of his Russian fluency, Scheubner-Richter was removed from the front and sent to the Ottoman Empire for a secret mission — infiltrate the Russian oil fields under the guise of a consulate in Erzurum. Though the infiltration never took off, Scheubner-Richter witnessed the Armenian Genocide, becoming one of the first to report about the atrocities, which he described as \"a policy of annihilation fuelled by racial hatred\".\n\nScheubner-Richter returned to the Baltics a lieutenant and became an officer in the Baltische Landeswehr. Retired from service in 1920 to settle in Riga, where he found work in the city press and maintained contact with his connections to both German and Baltic nationalists. To the dismay of his classmate Otto von Kursell, Scheubner-Richter did not end up involved in the Baltic Brotherhood, but the wartime years had turned him into just as much of a nationalist regardless. A conservative and a monarchist dismissive of democracy and vehemently against socialism, Scheubner-Richter calls in his \"Deutschen Manifest\" for the birth of a \"new nationalism\". One which is based upon the interest of the national community and one which will unite all Germans into one pan-Germanic state.§!"

 BAT_helmuth_stegman: "Helmuth Stegman"
 BAT_helmuth_stegman_desc_body: "Born to a former senior surveyor of the city of Riga, Helmuth Stegman acquired an education in law during the dying days of the Russian Empire. Working as a civil servant in his home town during the German occupation. The foundation of the United Baltic Duchy did little to affect his career. He acquired the lawyer's licence he wanted, worked both as a lawyer and a judge, and advanced to the Riga City Council. A political party gathered itself around him, the Baltic German State Party, a legalistic conservative movement limited to the city of Riga. Mobilising a large portion of the upper and middle class electorate propelled him to the position of Mayor, a position he's held for the past several years."
 BAT_helmuth_stegman_leader_desc: "§YBorn:§! §LOctober 19th, 1892, in Riga, Riga District, Livonia Governorate, Russian Empire§!\n§YBackground:§! §L$BAT_helmuth_stegman_desc_body$\n\nA legalistic mind, Stegman believed in thorough reform to the Baltic Duchy according to the rule of law. Throughout the years, he has submitted several projects for a constitution to the Duchy. Though none of them were approved, Riga would serve as his ground for experimentation. He reformed the horrific landscape of the Rigan legal system, ushered in a sense of stability and brought greater popular representation to the Rigaer Rat, granting him the respect of the people and allowing Riga to course through the collapse of the Duchy in one piece. A besieged, isolated Riga is something he could not predict, however. As the greatest challenge to the Baltic German nation arises, the Mayor is forced to put on a stern frown and guide its remnant, promising a bright tomorrow despite the fear in his heart.§!"

 BAT_wilhelm_munter_leader_desc: "§YBorn:§! §LJuly 25th, 1898, in Riga, Riga District, Livonia Governorate, Russian Empire§!\n§YBackground:§! §LGotthard Wilhelm Nikolai Munter was born to a mixed Estonian-Baltic German middle class family in Riga, growing up during the last days of the Russian Empire. Alongside the rest of the Riga Polytechnic, he was evacuated to Russia, and later recruited into the Imperial Russian Army. Inducted into the Cadet Corps, Munter was among the first to resist the October Revolution in Petrograd - sadly the sheer numbers of the revolutionaries proved too much to resist. The German soldier was imprisoned, but managed to escape through connections to the Baltics. Soon, he returned to German-occupied Riga. There, having finally found rest, Munter completed his studies in chemistry and applied to join the foreign office of the United Baltic Duchy. Throughout the post-Weltkrieg period, he became increasingly drawn to the Democratic Party and its reformist ideals. Though he never officially became a member, he became regarded as the leader of its liberal coalition in Riga.\n\nPersonality wise, Munter has been almost universally regarded as ambitious, unprincipled, and with an affinity towards intrigue. Lacking social tact and softness, he considers sentiment to be foreign to him. To Munter, emotional people are weak, insignificant dreamers and everyone he meets can only be classified into two categories - those who are useful and those who are useless. His opponents are numerous, but even those who know him well doubt he has any friends at all.§!"

 BAT_inner_circle: "The Inner Circle"
 BAT_inner_circle_leader_desc: "§YBackground:§! §LThe Inner Circle. Shadowy. Ominous. And as of late, all-powerful - at least within the borders of the Baltic State. While the Baltic Brotherhood has long consolidated its hold over the government, its senior leadership preferred to stay in the background and instead allowed for Count Rüdiger von der Goltz to serve as their eager figurehead. With the Count's recent passing however, the Brotherhood has lost its nominal leader. There were some brief fears of a power struggle, not unlike the ones in 1935. However, over a decade later, Otto von Kursell's grip on the organisation remains strong and the Führender Bruder (Leading Brother) and his Ostbewegung faction have ensured a quiet transition of power. The Regency for the long-sequestered Duke Adolf Friedrich of Mecklenburg has passed on to a small council.\n\nWhile specific details about the defacto leadership of the Circle remain sparse, and many have risen and fallen over the course of the decade, from an outsider's perspective the leading members are believed to include the aforementioned Chairman of the Convent von Kursell and General von Manteuffel-Szoege of the Landeswehr. This reactionary, German supremacist circle have worked tirelessly to militarise their nation and centralise the state. Given the circumstances, hope remains faint that there will be political liberalisation in the future, and life is expected to remain the same as it was under von der Goltz's reign.§!"

 BAT_adolf_friedrich: "Adolf Friedrich"
 BAT_adolf_friedrich_leader_desc: "§YBorn:§! §LOctober 10th, 1873, in Schwerin, Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, German Empire§!\n§YBackground:§! §LOne could hardly find a place in the world which Adolf Friedrich, the first and only Duke of the United Baltic Duchy, has not seen. An erudite veteran of the Prussian Cuirassiers, a passionate hunter and an avid car racer. Adolf undertook personal pilgrimages to the Middle East, East Asia and Africa, travelling thousands of kilometres on foot and horseback. Africa and its lush wildlife hold a special place in his heart, however - he's crossed Africa from east to west, left his name upon a volcano in East Africa. Ultimately, he landed a job as the Governor of Togoland before the Weltkrieg. While definitely not a soft administrator, Adolf Friedrich displayed great interest in the lives and culture of the Togolese natives, even taking the time to learn the Ewe language.\n\nAt the end of the Weltkrieg, his experience and prestige among the German upper class led to Adolf von Pilchau's Regency Council offering the throne of the United Baltic Duchy to him. Adolf Friedrich agreed and arrived in Riga in spring of 1919, where he announced that he shall safeguard the ancient rights and privileges of the Baltic nobility, as well as do everything in his power to be a good ruler. For the most part, Duke Adolf Friedrich is a passive monarch who dedicates his institution to patronage of the arts, sciences, and sports. He's recognised as the best race car driver in the entire Duchy, surpassing all of his fellow fans of the sport. Years of experience have given him plenty of political acumen, however. Recognising the weakness of his new realm, he's begun to speak out more often, expressing the need for reform.§!"

 BAT_rudiger_von_der_goltz: "Rüdiger von der Goltz"
 BAT_rudiger_von_der_goltz_leader_desc: "§YBorn:§! §LDecember 8th, 1865, in Züllichau, Province of Brandenburg, Kingdom of Prussia, German Confederation§!\n§YBackground:§! §LThe Graf von der Goltz is the most powerful a non-Baltic German has ever managed to become in the United Baltic Duchy, arguably even greater than Duke Adolf Friedrich himself. A descendant of a honoured Prussian noble family with a history of military officers, von der Goltz had a long and bountiful career in the Imperial German Army even before the Weltkrieg, during which he was a division commander respected on the Western and Eastern Fronts alike. In 1918, he became the General Staff's primary asset in relations with its Eastern regions - early that year, he was sent to Finland as a representative of the German forces and promptly took control of the state as a dictator. When that became untenable, he was reassigned to the Baltic Duchy, where he laid down the foundations for the Baltische Landeswehr. The army of the Duchy owes everything to von der Goltz, and he knows that.\n\nAn aristocrat by blood and personality, the Graf has little patience for democracy and the squabbling liberals in the Landtag. While many of his fellow German veterans who helped found the Baltische Landeswehr ultimately returned to Germany, von der Goltz stayed, knowing that not only will the Duchy require his services yet again, but that he will be able to take advantage of the situation and finally rise beyond a mere chief of staff of the Landeswehr.§!"

During the war, he gained a reputation for reckless, impromptu tactics on the field and a reliance on small unit tactics - one of his most well known feats is assaulting a fortified Estonian village with a heavy machine-gun alongside a small party of men, advancing despite facing a rain of bullets, seizing the village, the machine gun, and several captives without a single ally lost. He has remained in the army after the war, promoting a doctrine of autonomy, small unit tactics, and fireteam organisation to turn the Landeswehr into a force of elite soldiers.§!"

Immediately upon graduation, he joined the Baltische Landeswehr as a volunteer and was almost instantly promoted to a commanding officer, his regiment proceeded to wage war against the Latvians and Estonians. He continued to rapidly rise through the ranks of the military in the following years, becoming a trusted accomplice of Graf von der Goltz and a respected commander in his own right. Though his ascent is largely credited to his blood relations with Axel von Freytagh-Loringhoven, an influential member of the Baltic Knighthoods, he holds enough talent to justify his high ranking regardless.§!"

When the war concluded, he returned to his homeland and pledged his allegiance to the United Baltic Duchy - and brought his expertise in the art of mounted warfare with him.

At the age of 17, he volunteered for the Baltische Landeswehr, fought in Germany and chose to tie his future with the military. After completing officer courses, he continued his studies in Germany, where he became attracted to the prospect of manoeuvre warfare, based upon massed armour and the motorisation of infantry. Ever since he returned to Riga and gained his deserved commission, he has continued to promote this innovative doctrine.§!"

He decided to follow the path of his father, enrolled for the Page Corps of the Imperial Russian Army, and served in the 4th Life Guards Regiment. After fighting in the Weltkrieg, he returned to the family estate in Estonia in 1917, only to be swept up by the Estonian War of Independence. von Weiss volunteered for the Landeswehr and commanded forces against the Estonians during the last months of the war, then decided to stay in the army a little longer.

Upon the breakout of the Weltkrieg, he, a student in Heidelberg, Germany, chose to enrol for the Imperial German Army, despite his nation's allegiance to Russia at the time, and achieved the rank of Lieutenant in the Bavarian Uhlans. Thanks to this experience and clear loyalty to the German cause, he became one of the first members of the General Staff of the Baltische Landeswehr in November of 1918. An active, reckless leader, he commanded an elite unit of Weltkrieg veterans against the Estonian and Latvian rebellions, often leading his men from the front lines without an ounce of hesitation.\n\nBy the end of the war, Manteuffel's prestige among the Baltic Germans was untold and his status as a war hero cemented. Manteuffel himself took a lunge towards the far right, however. Invited by his brother Georg, a member of the organisation's inner circle, he was inducted into the Baltic Brotherhood, and turned into a devout follower of its nationalist, pan-German, and reactionary beliefs. To the Brotherhood, he is an example of the legacy of Teutonic knighthood remaining to this day, a real hero on the battlefield. It remains to be seen whether Manteuffel gets to propel his Brothers into the power they always desired...§!"

He was not the only one, but he was one of the few who took a liking to this brave new land and decided to stay.
