### World Tension ###
 italian_wars_threat: "Italian Civil War"

### Ideas ###
 italy_balance_idea: "The Precarious Balance"
 italy_balance_idea_desc: "As it stands, Italy is perched uncomfortably between the great powers of Europe. Each of the various governments have foreign sponsors who could potentially intervene in a renewed Italian civil war - but all of these sponsors understand that to do so would provoke their rivals, and risk drawing the entire continent into conflict. Their mutual unwillingness to take this gambit has helped ensure the peninsula's continued division.\n\nThis balance of power persists: all foreign aid to Italy thus far has been kept at arm's length, only to the level of material and expertise. As long as no state directly enters an Italian conflict, it will remain this way. However, if a foreign alliance does enter such a war, then all bets are off - and all other sponsors can be expected to join suit."
 ITA_republic_federation: "The Unstable Republic"
 ITA_republic_federation_desc: "When our nation was saved by Austria in 1920, the Habsburgs forced us to give much power to our constituent states, especially Veneto, as part of the Italian Federation. However, this has been adjourned for six years, effectively disbanded, creating a confusing bureaucratic situation. The opposition also causes no end of trouble, with some calling for the Federation's restoration and some calling for an end to democracy and Austrian influence altogether. The political situation is unlikely to stabilise any time soon."
 ITA_republic_unitary: "The New Unitary State"
 ITA_republic_unitary_desc: "The power of the states has been curtailed, and all authority now rests with the central government - a government which has eliminated elections and declared itself above responsibility to the people, for the good of the entire country. While the ANI enjoys a great deal of support, there is still considerable resistance to this new government - particularly from the republicans and regionalists in the country's former states."
 ITA_federation_transition: "The Federation Restored"
 ITA_federation_transition_desc: "Now that the power of the Federation Council has been restored, we face the long and difficult task of getting the people and civil service to accept as their government what they once thought of as a museum piece."
 ITA_federation_secure: "The Federation Rejuvenated"
 ITA_federation_secure_desc: "The authority of the Federation Council is mostly undisputed, both internationally and internally. The Council now looks to the restitution of its members' former lands."
 ITA_austrian_influence: "Austrian Influence"
 ITA_austrian_influence_desc: "Austria's influence is felt at every level of our nation, from its ownership over many of our companies to the loyalty owed by many of our most highly-placed politicians. Resentment against that influence is high, for even if they have protected us against the syndicalists they are still responsible for our loss in the Weltkrieg. Even so, cutting ties with Austria will prove a difficult and costly task."
 ITA_austrian_sanctions: "Effects of Nationalisation"
 ITA_austrian_sanctions_desc: "Our economy will need time to recover from our so-called 'divorce' from Austrian domination."
 ITA_decentralize_idea: "Economic Opportunities in Decentralisation"

### Decisions ###

 ITA_foreign_policy_desc: "It is crucial that we begin to shift our focus outward and forge alliances and/or establish ties with other nations so as to solidify our position on the world stage."
 ITA_remove_austrian_influence: "Remove Austrian Influence"
 ITA_remove_austrian_influence_desc: "The Austrians still hold a strong hold over the [Root.GetAdjective] economy - too strong, in fact. While it may cause some short-term pain, in the long term it would be worth our while to nationalise Austrian-owned corporations in [Root.GetNameDef] and declare our complete economic independence."
 ITA_attack_austria: "Attack the Austrians"
 ITA_attack_austria_desc: "Like a vampire of legend, [AUS.GetNameDef] has slowly drained the life from us. If we are to ever truly reassert ourselves internally and internationally, the Austrians must be vanquished."
 ITA_call_for_help: "Call on [From.GetNameDef] for Help"
 ITA_call_for_help_desc: "With [SRI.GetNameDef] at war with us, [From.GetNameDef] has to know they will be their next target should we lose. If they are wise, they will answer our call for help now before it is too late."
 ITA_war_with_venice1: "Venice in Revolt"
 ITA_war_with_venice1_desc: "The Venetians have risen up against the [Root.GetAdjective] government. We must prove that we are able to deal with them quickly, lest our neighbours grow confident that we are weak enough for them to step in and interfere."
 ITA_war_with_venice2: "Venice in Revolt"
 ITA_war_with_venice2_desc: "We have lost control of the situation in Venetia. Now we must deal with foreign intervention, on top of conquering the rebellion itself. If we fail to wrap this up within a few months, it is likely that the ANI government will collapse."
 ITA_call_the_austrians_sri: "Call the Austrians"
 ITA_call_the_austrians_sri_desc: "We are at war with the syndicalist republic. We should ask the Austrians to come in and assist us and make sure that the syndicalists are defeated."
 ITA_join_the_austrian_pact: "Ally with the Austrians"

 ITA_conference_of_venice: "Sign a Treaty with [From.GetNameDef]"
 ITA_conference_of_venice_desc: "Though we must reclaim Rome, there is no call for violence against the Holy Father. We should invite him to Venice for a Concordat on the future of the Pope's temporal rule."

 ITA_unite_italy_desc: "Italy is once again united! We must work on reintegrating our nation."
 ITA_attack_italy: "Attack [From.GetNameDef]"

 ITA_invite_into_federation_1: "Invite [From.GetNameDef] into [Root.GetNameDef]"
 ITA_invite_into_federation_2: "Propose Restoration of the Monarchy"
 ITA_invite_into_federation_desc: "With the threat of the socialist republic now eliminated, perhaps now is the time to heal the rifts caused by the civil war. Since we are in a clearly dominant position on the Italian peninsula, it falls to us to lead the way."
 ITA_rally_supporters: "Rally Support Within the SRI"
 ITA_rally_supporters_desc: "There exists a network of resistance to the syndicalists within [SRI.GetNameDef], those who would rise up if called. They've been working ever since the civil war, and while their forces might ultimately not tip the balance in our favour, we can use all the help that's available."
 ITA_claim_libya: "Claim Libya"
 ITA_claim_libya_desc: "Until Italy's loss in the Weltkrieg meant our Libyan colony was restored to Ottoman rule, it was our most important colony - an extension of Italy itself, rather than some far-flung estate. We had great plans for the region. Now that our nation is restored, the time has come to claim what is rightfully ours."
 ITA_war_for_libya: "Declare War on [From.GetNameDef]"
 ITA_war_for_libya_desc: "The time has come to reclaim Libya, and that means a war with [From.GetNameDef] in order to get it. Viva l'Italia!"

 ITA_join_moscow_accord_desc: "The cursed Italian syndicalists are no more, and with their fall, so too leaves any reason for us not to join forces with the Russians, and crush the German-Austrian bloc for good."
 ITA_resorgimento_decisions: "Risorgimento"
 ITA_resorgimento_decisions_desc: "Italy has been divided since the Italian Civil War of 1920. Monarchists, Socialists, Republicans, and exiles glare at each other from behind their fortifications. In the face of this division, few are certain of Italy's swift reunification. God willing, however, we shall soon reunite all Italians in a new Risorgimento, like that of Cavour and the Savoyards seventy years ago."

 ITA_erode_italian_legitimacy_desc: "The [From.GetAdjective] government has been defeated and is now hiding in exile. Considering their claim to legitimacy is far from absolute, we should be able to wear down the [From.GetAdjective] resistance, given enough time."

### Republic Path ###
 ITA_social_liberal_victory: "The Republic Survives"
 ITA_social_liberal_victory_desc: "Despite the lure of the ANI and foreign machinations the Republic has survived. While the ANI still exist, we can take comfort in knowing that the republic is safe and secure from domestic enemies."
 ITA_protect_democracy: "Protect Democracy"
 ITA_protect_democracy_desc: "At last, we may breathe a sigh of relief - the election is over, and with it, internal tension has at last begun to dissipate. Our Republic has endured."
 ITA_contain_extermism: "Contain Extremism"
 ITA_contain_extermism_desc: "While our republic has so far persisted despite challenges from radicals of all stripes, any moment of weakness could become an opportunity for tyrants. Liberty cannot be allowed to perish. We must suppress socialist and ultra-nationalist organisations."
 ITA_banking_reform: "Banking Reform"
 ITA_banking_reform_desc: "The inherent vulnerability of the current global banking and financial system can no longer be denied. We should pass emergency legislation to stabilise failing banks and pass the most noncontroversial reforms to the system."
 ITA_work_programs: "Work Programmes"
 ITA_work_programs_desc: "Unemployment threatens both our people's welfare and the stability of our country. To combat this, we should put the unemployed to task constructing new buildings and infrastructure."
 ITA_workers_rights: "Workers' Rights"
 ITA_workers_rights_desc: "Italian labourers should never again be tempted by the insidious siren song of socialism, nor crushed beneath an employer's boot. Let us stamp out abuses against workers."
 ITA_economic_recovery_act: "Economic Recovery Act"
 ITA_economic_recovery_act_desc: "Our initial recovery efforts have alleviated some of the hardship brought on by Black Monday. We should now implement a comprehensive plan along the same lines as our previous initiatives to ensure that this depression is put fully at an end."
 ITA_bussiness_relations: "Good Business Relations"
 ITA_bussiness_relations_desc: "Many wrongly fear that our government holds sentiments not unlike the socialists across the Po. To calm these misplaced worries, we should arrange for regular meetings with prominent business leaders to discuss matters of policy."
 ITA_union_ties: "Union Ties"
 ITA_union_ties_desc: "While many trade unions supported the socialist insurrection, the Partito Liberale Democratico worked closely with moderate unions to consolidate our republic's authority during its tumultuous early days. We should reaffirm our commitment to continued cooperation with the unions."
 ITA_christian_democracy: "Christian Democracy"
 ITA_christian_democracy_desc: "Christianity espouses compassion for humanity and establishes sound moral principles. These values are integral to our nation's democracy and should officially become our party's creed."
 ITA_ubranization: "Urbanisation"
 ITA_ubranization_desc: "Our cities have stagnated due to the Weltkrieg's unfavourable conclusion and the ravages of the Civil War, and with them, our industrial capacity has also plateaued.

 ITA_stable_democracy: "Stable Democracy"
 ITA_stable_democracy_desc: "The economic crisis is at an end and extremist political challenges have been defeated. Italian Democracy now functions like never before, and our nation has become noticeably more stable."

### ANI Path ###

 ITA_purge_red_meance: "Purge Red Menace"
 ITA_purge_red_meance_desc: "The old republic was a sham, and its institutions were incapable of withstanding socialist infiltration. All civil servants must be comprehensively evaluated, and if any association with a socialist organisation of any kind can be found, they must be immediately removed from their post."
 ITA_italian_militerism: "Italian Militarism"
 ITA_italian_militerism_desc: "Our nation could be attacked at any moment. All true sons of Italy must always be vigilant, ready to defend their nation at a moment's notice. We should do whatever we can to remind the people of their duty."
 ITA_four_economic_battles: "Four Economic Battles"
 ITA_four_economic_battles_desc: "Our nation lies in ruin, not for the failure of any nationalistically minded Italian, but for the actions of so many buffoons the world over. We must never again be vulnerable to foreign incompetence. Each of four of the most major issues facing our nation should be fought and defeated in turn."
 ITA_destroy_austrian_influence: "Eliminate Anti-Italian Institutions"
 ITA_destroy_austrian_influence_desc: "The Republic granted too much autonomy to its member states, relics of the vestiges of Austrian influence and the Federation. The time has come to abolish their rights and place all power within the central government's hands - even though this might very well mean a fight with those whose autonomy we strip away."
 ITA_corporate_alliance: "Corporate Alliance"
 ITA_corporate_alliance_desc: "The natural human urge to profit and succeed is by no means bad, but it must be harnessed to serve the interests of the people and the nation.

 ITA_corporate_militarism: "Corporate Militarism"
 ITA_corporate_militarism_desc: "Our corporate allies should be put to work building a series of new state armaments factories."
 ITA_purge_opposition: "Purge Opposition"
 ITA_purge_opposition_desc: "Whatever opposition to the nationalist project remains must be quickly dealt with. Socialists and anti-Italians will be left no quarter - we won't allow them to lose us another war."
 ITA_centralized_power: "Building of Empire"
 ITA_centralized_power_desc: "With the regionalists dealt with, no one can now oppose our Imperial project. Italy must be allowed to breathe, and her proles will have the land they need to prosper."
 ITA_military_loyalty: "Hail to the Heroes"
 ITA_military_loyalty_desc: "For far too long the men in green in our armed forces have been sidelined and blamed for the losses of 1919. Are they not the same heroes that so valiantly gave their lives for the country on the Isonzo? We shall recognise the primary role of the Army not just in Italian history, but in our society as a whole."
 ITA_italian_liberation: "Avenge Caporetto"
 ITA_italian_liberation_desc: "One name has, for two decades, weighed on Italy's soul: Caporetto. Today however, with the great cities of Trento and Trieste finally redeemed, we can finally move forward in making Italy one of the World's foremost powers, avenging the death of the heroes who fought for Italy's greatness."
 ITA_italy_is_reborn: "Italy is Reborn"
 ITA_italy_is_reborn_desc: "Like a phoenix rising anew, Italy has been reborn. Now, the very identity of our nation must be cemented. Italy will be reshaped and reformed into a new State that is National, Proletarian, Social and above all Italian."

 ITA_invest_in_countryside: "Invest in the Countryside"
 ITA_invest_in_countryside_desc: "Rural areas preserve tradition and morality, unlike any city. The devastated countryside must be restored if our government is to have popular support."
 ITA_decentralization: "Decentralising Ideals"
 ITA_decentralization_desc: "The Italian Federation promotes economic freedom among its member states, with the central government helping out when needed and staying out when not. This attitude should make our member states richer."
 ITA_state_intervention: "State Intervention"
 ITA_state_intervention_desc: "The free market has clearly failed, for if it had succeeded the liberals would have stayed in power. Only through state intervention can we end our markets' plunge."
 ITA_build_legitimacy: "Build Legitimacy"
 ITA_build_legitimacy_desc: "To many, the Italian Federation was no more in their lives than a foreign imposition. They view our government as an irrelevant anachronism that will soon collapse. We must assure them that this is not the case."

### Bookmark ###
 ITA_KR_gathering_storm_desc: "After Italy's defeat in the Weltkrieg, the country was left to the mercy of the Austrians - and it would have been reorganised into an Italian Federation had it not been for the outbreak of civil war. The socialists would have overrun the peninsula had the Austrians not swallowed a bitter pill and cooperated with the republicans... and, after the fighting stopped, were forced to maintain the relationship into the current day. Italy remains unstable, however, and its eventual reckoning with the socialists across the Po appears inevitable."

### Intro Screen ###
 ITA_country_intro_header: "The History of the Republic of Italy: Defeat and Civil War"
 ITA_country_intro_content: "With the French defeat and the collapse of the Italian war effort, the Austrians and the Kingdom of Italy signed an armistice in August 1919, in which the Austrians were allowed to garrison Lombardy and Venetia until a peace treaty was signed. Mere days after the humiliating announcement of peace, enraged nationalists proclaimed the new Republic of Italy in Milan, which maintained that all treaties signed by the House of Savoy were to be considered null and void.\n\nAll over Italy republicans and nationalists rose up against the kingdom, and even the abdication of King Victor Emanuel and his son wasn't enough to stop the collapse of royal authority. After pushing the royalists out of much of Central and Northern Italy it became apparent that the rivalries between differing factions in the republic were too great to reconcile, and what started with small acts of sabotage become a full-fledged conflict between Red and White forces, grinding the offensives against the monarchists to a halt."

 ITA_country_intro_header_1: "The Status of the Republic of Italy: The Federation Failure"
 ITA_country_intro_content_1: "As the civil war dragged on, the tides of war turned against the Whites, and when Austria offered the republicans help in exchange for joining in a common state with the royalists in the south, the republicans had no choice but to accept, or face destruction. After a victory at the Po against the Socialists, the White and Austrian forces found themselves forced to swallow the bitter pill of prolonged cooperation. The Republic was obliged to legally join the Italian Federation under Austrian protection. They also granted significant autonomy to Veneto and much influence in the government to the Austrians and the Council of the Italian Federation. In exchange, however, the Prime Minister of the Republic was granted the title Interim Head of the Italian Federation.\n\nThis carefully balanced arrangement fell apart in 1926, however, when the Union of Britain joined the Third Internationale. The Socialists were emboldened and there was talk of war, but the Austrians made it clear that their forces would make no move to attack the socialists if the south came under attack. This threw the peninsula into chaos, and gave the Sicilians and Savoyards, long dissatisfied with the pro-Milan balance in the Council of the Italian Federation, the chance to walk out. Though the socialists never attacked, the Council now clearly served no purpose, and its ten-year term was allowed to expire in 1930. While the halls of civilian power in Milan bustle with activity and ambition, the Council Chamber now stands empty."

 ITA_country_intro_header_2: "The Status of the Republic of Italy: Recovery and Risorgimento"
 ITA_country_intro_content_2: "Though at considerable cost to national pride, the Austrian connection slowly improved the economic standing of the Republic, which drew strength from the German Mitteleuropa and Austrian investment. As Italy recovered from the civil war's destruction, however, many in the Republic began to rue their government's deal with the Habsburgs, and popular support for the anti-Austrian Associazione Nazionalista Italiana (Italian Nationalist Association) grew in Lombardy and Friuli.\n\nIvanoe Bonomi's centre-left coalition has ruled the country since 1927, but their popularity is mainly due to the economic stability, and should that end other parties such as the staunchly republican Partito Liberale Italiano or conservative Partito Popolare Italiano might gain enough support to form a government. Should matters get completely out of hand and Federation-aligned forces restore order in the north by force, even the old Council of the Italian Federation might take power. One thing all parties have in common is a desire for a free, united Italy, however, and many are sure a second Risorgimento is coming."

### Events ###

 ita.2.t: "Black Monday Hits the Republic"
 ita.2.d: "The economic crisis that started in Germany has spiralled out of control and has spread to Italy. The Republic of Italy's prosperity has been shattered by Black Monday and the confidence in the government has been shaken."
 ita.2.a: "May God Protect us!"

 ita.3.t: "Ivanoe Bonomi calls for a General Election"
 ita.3.d: "With Black Monday hitting the Republic of Italy, Prime Minister Ivanoe Bonomi has decided to call for an early general election. Elections will be held in 1936 instead of 1937 as was scheduled. Hopefully, with this election, the Prime Minister will be able to shore up support for his policies to resolve the economic crisis."
 ita.3.a: "Hopefully..."

 ita.4.t: "Ciano's Speech"
 ita.4.d: "[ITA_GetNatPopLeader] of the Associazione Nazionalista Italiana delivered a speech in the city of Verona today. During the speech, the old admiral blamed the government of the republic for causing the economic crisis. Moreover, he went on to describe Austria's role in keeping Italy divided and weak, and that the syndicalists were only allowed to continue to exist as a foil to the Republic. Ciano promises that it is only the ANI that is able to restore Italy to glory and destroy all her enemies. In spite of his radical and anti-republican views, the Hero of Buccari commands large influence - which makes him particularly dangerous to our young Republic."
 ita.4.a: "We should keep an eye on him"

 ita.5.t: "The Church Comments on the Crisis"
 ita.5.d: "A number of influential figures within the church have been rallying support for political figures during their sermons. Of particular note are the Archbishops of Milan and Venice, who have urged parishioners to follow traditional Catholic values during this crisis, a none too subtle nod of support for the conservative Popolare Italiano party. However some bishops, though not as influential as those in Milan and Venice, have instead urged support for Catholic Social Teaching and the ruling Liberal Democratic party. In both cases, people are listening to the advice of the church."
 ita.5.a: "Let us hope the Church is right"

 ita.6.t: "Matteotti Supports Bonomi"
 ita.6.d: "Giacomo Matteotti, leader of the Lega Democratica Riformista, the Social Democratic party in coalition with Ivanoe Bonomi, has given a speech in Milan supporting the prime minister. This has given valuable support to the besieged ruling party."
 ita.6.a: "Thank you, Matteotti"

 ita.7.t: "Protests Against Farm Auctions"
 ita.7.d: "The current economic crisis has caused a lot of farmers to default on their loans and mortgages, and their livestock and property are normally auctioned away to the highest bidder by local authorities. The practice is deeply unpopular among Italian farmers, but its proponents claim that debts must be repaid and that the auctions are a necessary evil in a free market economy. Yesterday, the Italian People's Party proposed a bill that would ban the auctions. What is the government's position on the issue?"
 ita.7.a: "Allow the auctions to continue"
 ita.7.b: "Pass the bill and ban the auctions"

 ita.8.t: "Influence in the Italian Government"
 ita.8.d: "In 1919, we signed an armistice with the Kingdom of Italy, which allowed us to garrison Lombardy and Venetia until a treaty was signed. The Italians were little pleased with this defeat, and rose up in revolution against their Savoyard monarch. Soon, he and his son abdicated, and there was a power vacuum in Italy, as socialist rebels seemed primed to overrun the entire nation. We offered the desperate Italians the aid of our armies in stopping the socialist advance, in exchange for joining a new Italian Federation, a legitimate government we could deal with. The Savoyards, White republicans, and southern forces agreed to our terms, and our armies pushed the socialists out of Lombardy. We did concede to the republicans that a republican leader would be the interim head of the Federation, though the Federation Council would retain some power behind the scenes. However, when the socialists made moves to attack the southern states of the Federation in 1926, we were embroiled in the Illyrian crisis, and could not promise to attack the socialists in support. Outraged, Sardinia, the Bourbons in Naples, and even the Holy Father himself abandoned our Federation, leaving us with only Milan. Unfortunately, the Federation Council there was allowed to lapse in 1930, and has not been renewed since. Even worse, we recently withdrew our military from their nation due to the Black Monday crisis, leaving them far more independent than they were.\n\nNow the current liberal government under Ivanoe Bonomi has pushed forward the election in a bid for more support in the legislature. However, their victory is not a sure thing, and we have some leeway to influence the election. The three moderate parties that have a real chance at winning are the Liberal Democrats, currently in power, the People's Party, a conservative party who has enjoyed our support in the past, and the Italian Republicans, hostile to monarchy but also vehemently anti-ANI and anti-socialist. We can give our support and backing to one of the pro-Austrian political parties to ensure that the right one takes power in Milan. Some ministers, however, are concerned that overt involvement might result in further support for the far right and anti-Austrian Italian Nationalist Association."
 ita.8.a: "Support the Liberal Democrats"
 ita.8.b: "Support the People's Party"
 ita.8.e: "Overt influence would merely empower the ANI"

 ita.9.t: "Austria Supports the Liberal Democrats"
 ita.9.d: "The Austrians have given support to the ruling Liberal Democrats in an attempt to help them win the election. While this has indeed had the intended effect, and encouraged more support for the ruling Liberal Democrats, it has also drawn far more attention to the far right and Anti-Austrian ANI party."
 ita.9.a: "Hopefully this helps us stay in power"

 ita.10.t: "Austria Supports the Partito Popolare Italiano"
 ita.10.d: "The Austrians have given support to the Partito Popolare Italiano in an attempt to help them win the election. While this has indeed the intended effect, and encouraged more support for the Popolares, it has also drawn far more attention to the far right and Anti-Austrian ANI party."

 ita.12.t: "The General Election"
 ita.12.d: "Today, the Italian people choose a new parliament. The election is tightly fought and very likely will decide the course of Italy for the near future, with four predicted outcomes. Firstly, the liberal democratic coalition under Prime Minister Bonomi can continue, or a liberal coalition led by the anti-autocratic and centre-left Liberale Italiano party could ride to victory. Alternately, the conservative coalition led by the Popolare Italiano could be victorious, but few can afford to forget the surprisingly popular Associazione Nazionalista Italiana. Who do the Italian people choose?"
 ita.12.a: "Partito Liberale Democratico"
 ita.12.b: "Partito Liberale Italiano"

 ita.20.d: "Though our Federation government has gained a great deal of popular support, the ANI have continued to encourage illegal violence and political action against our government. Now, they have re-appeared in Udine, where [ITA_GetNatPopLeader] has called yet again for our removal from 'his great nation.' The local police were unwilling to arrest the man, and now some in our government are calling for military intervention."
 ita.20.a: "Send the military in"
 ita.20.b: "His support will fade in time"

 ita.21.t: "The Social Democrats Refuse to Participate"
 ita.21.d: "Speaking in Venice, Giacomo Matteotti and other leaders of the Lega Democratica Riformista party have denounced the cowardly liberal parties for agreeing to the deal that restored the Federation, and have declared that they will boycott the elections as a 'farce' and a 'blight against democracy'."
 ita.21.a: "Traitors!"

 ita.23.t: "Dealing with the Syndicalist Economy"
 ita.23.d: "Now that we have taken control of the territory of the Socialist Republic of Italy the question of what to do with the Syndicalist factories and farms has been brought forth to the Parliament. Those on the left believe in largely leaving the collective farms and factories alone, and letting new companies be private enterprises. This notion has already been denounced by right-wing members of parliament as 'siding with syndicalism', and suggest they should be de-collectivised and privatised. Those in the centre believe that the economy should be de-syndicalised, but slowly, as to not arouse the anger of the syndicalists."
 ita.23.a: "Leave them alone"
 ita.23.b: "Slowly de-syndicalise the economy"
 ita.23.c: "Immediately de-syndicalise the economy"

 ita.28.t: "The Royal Academy of Italy"
 ita.28.d: "Today the Reale Accademia d'Italia (Royal Academy of Italy) was founded by royal decree, inspired by the French Academy, and sixty Italians have been selected for their scientific, literary, and artistic achievements. Members of the academy are granted first-class travel on the national railroads, are to be addressed as 'Your Excellency', and receive 3,000 lire a month. While one of the stated goals was to support and promote the sciences, literature and the arts, another goal is to help the new monarchy be better accepted by the people of Italy. To both ends it is succeeding, if slowly."
 ita.28.a: "A noble initiative"

 ita.29.t: "The Accademia Nazionale di Arte Drammatica"
 ita.29.d: "Today the Accademia Nazionale di Arte Drammatica was founded in Rome to serve as the centre of the performing arts within the [Root.GetName] now that Rome is our capital once again. The Academy shall promote the education of people who seek to enter the arts"
 ita.29.a: "Let us support culture"

 ita.30.t: "Intervention in Italy?"
 ita.30.d: "It has become increasingly clear that the ANI cannot control the situation in Italy - though neither can the Venetian revolt get the upper hand. If we were to consider intervening, now would be the time to do it - though with an eye towards restoring the power of the Italian Federation under a Habsburg Head, and not towards restoring the failed Italian Republic. Of course, it would require Venetian agreement, but surely they would not refuse our help?"
 ita.30.a: "Offer help to the Venetians"
 ita.30.b: "They are on their own"

 ita.31.t: "Help from the Austrians?"
 ita.31.d: "[AUS.GetNameDefCap] has offered to help in our battle against [ITA.GetNameDef]. If they intervene, and succeed, it will mean submitting to Austrian influence once the war is over - they will want to dispense with the Italian Republic, and instead restore the power of the Italian Federation of old... no doubt under the domination of a Habsburg ruler, such the Grand Duke of Tuscany. However, we have been assured that our autonomy will be restored to what it was before the election"
 ita.31.a: "It doesn't matter - we need the help"
 ita.31.b: "No, we can handle this on our own"

 ita.32.t: "The Venetians Refuse"
 ita.32.d: "Apparently too wary of our future interference, the Venetians have refused our help and are determined to fight the civil war on their own. We are forced to watch the situation unfold from the sidelines."
 ita.32.a: "So be it!"

 ita.33.t: "The Time Has Come"
 ita.33.d.austriawar: "It is clear that [ITA.GetNameDef] has lost control of the situation in their country, unable to gain the upper hand against the Venetian rebels. This has brought [AUS.GetNameDef] into the war on the side of the Venetians, and it prompts a question for our government as well: should we make a move to attack? It will mean a race against the Austrians to be the first to capture Milan, and runs the risk of direct contact with Austrian units on the battlefield... a situation which could escalate, if we are not careful."
 ita.33.d.austriarefuse: "It is clear that [ITA.GetNameDef] has lost control of the situation in their country, unable to gain the upper hand against the Venetian rebels. Perhaps good news for us is that the Austrians have refused to intervene, something which possibly leaves an opening for us to attack. Should we make a move while our enemies are weak?"
 ita.33.d.noaustria: "It is clear that [ITA.GetNameDef] has lost control of the situation in their country, unable to gain the upper hand against the Venetian rebels. Even better news is that the Whites have no Austria to protect them this time. They are fighting amongst themselves and vulnerable. Is now the time to strike?"
 ita.33.a: "Now is our chance"
 ita.33.b: "We can't risk it"

 ita.34.t: "The Socialist Republic Attacks"
 ita.34.d.haswar: "[SRI.GetNameDefCap] has reacted to our intervention in the Italian war by launching an assault on [ITA.GetNameDef]. It will mean a race to see who is the first to capture Milan! Let us hope this does not spiral out of control."
 ita.34.d.nowar: "[SRI.GetNameDefCap] has reacted to our decision to not intervene on behalf of the Venetian rebels by launching an assault on [ITA.GetNameDef]. Perhaps we will grow to regret our decision, though the possibility of meeting the socialists on the battlefield is not something we would relish."
 ita.34.a: "We'll be keeping a close eye on this..."

 ita.37.d: "Our attempts to sue for peace with [From.GetNameDef] have been rebuffed. They intend to fight with us until the very end."

 ita.38.t: "The Occupation of [759.GetName]"
 ita.38.d: "With the annexation of [ITA.GetNameDef] by [SRI.GetNameDef], the state of [759.GetName] has been left cut off - and the locals have cried out to [Root.GetNameDef] to step in and save them from socialist control."
 ita.38.a: "A good idea"

 ita.39.t: "The Occupation of [759.GetName]"
 ita.39.d: "With the annexation of [ITA.GetNameDef] by [SRI.GetNameDef], the state of [759.GetName] has been left cut off from our forces - and the locals there have apparently appealed to [From.GetNameDef] to step in and save them from our control. There is literally nothing we can do, at present."
 ita.39.a: "We will deal with them in time"

 ita.40.t: "Italian Government Overthrown"
 ita.40.d: "Faced with a population that has become increasingly frustrated with the drawn out war against the Venetians, the government has been faced down by an assembled mob and forced to flee. The temporary government, headed by the military, has signed a peace accord with [VNC.GetNameDef] and submitted to their annexation. What happens next will ultimately be up to them."
 ita.40.a: "So much for that"

 ita.41.t: "Italian Government Overthrown"
 ita.41.d: "Unable to score a quick victory against the Venetian government, the ANI government in Legionnary Italy has been faced down by an assembled mob and forced to flee. The military government which has taken its place has signed a peace accord with [Root.GetNameDef] and submitted to our annexation. What happens next will be entirely up to us."
 ita.41.a: "Good!"

 ita.42.t: "Venetian Victory!"
 ita.42.d.noaustria: "We have control over the whole of Lombardia, and the ANI resistance has been all but crushed. Now we must decide what comes next for the country. Support is high for the restoration of the old Italian Federation in full - member states with broad powers of autonomy, with all but Venice itself returned to rule by the monarchy, all governed by the Federal Council. Who heads that council will have considerable power, and the main candidates are the Habsburg Grand Duke of Tuscany, Count Visconti of Milan, and Venice's own leader of the revolt, Giuseppe Volpi. Even so, there are others who say that Venice should remain independent, and has no reason to join a federation at all."
 ita.42.d.austria: "We have control over the whole of Lombardia, and the ANI resistance has been all but crushed. Now the time has come to live up to our agreement with the Austrians - a restoration of the old Italian Federation in full. Its member states will have broad powers of autonomy, with all but Venice itself returned to rule by the monarchy, all governed by the Federal Council. Some say we should remain independent, but truly we should thank the Austrians for once again stepping in and defending us. If not for them, likely we would not have achieved victory at all."
 ita.42.a: "Restore the Federation under the Grand Duke of Tuscany"

 ita.43.d.habsburg: "The old Italian Federation has been restored, casting aside the republic in favour of autonomous states ruled by the aristocracy and headed by the Federal Council... with the Habsburg Grand Duke Pietro of Tuscany sitting at its head. The Grand Duke has reached out to us, welcoming friendly relations between the Federation and [Root.GetNameDef]. It is truly the best outcome we could have hoped for."
 ita.43.d.visconti: "The old Italian Federation has been restored, casting aside the republic in favour of autonomous states ruled by the aristocracy and headed by the Federal Council... though they have elected to put Count Visconti of Milan at its head rather than the Habsburg Grand Duke. Even so, it is perhaps a good sign that the Count has reached out to [Root.GetNameDef] and suggested that our countries continue their good relations."
 ita.43.d.volpi: "The old Italian Federation has been restored, casting aside the republic in favour of autonomous states ruled by the aristocracy and headed by the Federal Council... though they have elected to put the president of Venice, Giuseppe Volpi, at its head rather than the Habsburg Grand Duke. Even so, it is perhaps a good sign that Volpi has reached out to [Root.GetNameDef] and suggested that our countries continue their good relations."
 ita.43.a: "We welcome them into our alliance"

 ita.43.c: "We look forward to future cooperation"

 ita.44.t: "Lombardia Has Fallen"
 ita.44.d.austria: "Despite Austria's intervention, it was not enough to prevent Lombardia from being overrun by [SRI.GetNameDef]. Now [Root.GetNameDef] is on its own, with even less ability to protect itself against the socialist hordes than before."
 ita.44.d.noaustria: "It appears our civil war provided [SRI.GetNameDef] exactly the weakness they were looking for. They have overtaken Lombardia, and now we are on our own with even less ability to protect ourselves against the socialist hordes than before."
 ita.44.a: "Turn to the Austrians for protection"
 ita.44.b: "We will figure it out on our own"

 ita.45.t: "Venice Asks For Protection"
 ita.45.d.austria: "Our intervention was not enough to prevent Lombardia from being overrun by [SRI.GetNameDef]. Now [Root.GetNameDef] is on its own, with even less ability to protect itself against the socialist hordes than before. They have asked for our protection... though offering it might bring us into war against the Third Internationale."
 ita.45.d.noaustria: "It appears the civil war in Italy provided [SRI.GetNameDef] exactly the weakness they were looking for. They have overtaken Lombardia, and now [VNC.GetNameDef] has been left defenceless. They have asked for our protection... though offering it might bring us into war against the Third Internationale."
 ita.45.a: "Of course we will protect them however we can"
 ita.45.b: "They are on their own"

 ita.46.t: "Austria Offers Protection"

 ita.46.a: "What a relief"

 ita.47.t: "Austria Refuses Protection"
 ita.47.d: "Austria has refused to offer us protection, at least for the time being. We are on our own."
 ita.47.a: "So be it."

 ita.50.t: "The Battle for the Lira"
 ita.50.d: "The first of Four Economic 'battles' designed to fix the economy, the battle for the Lira will stabilise the currency of the State. As all battles are, it may be a struggle, but by stabilising the currency of the Republic we will be able to fulfil our Italian destiny."
 ita.50.a: "Viva l'Italia!"

 ita.51.t: "The Battle for the Land"
 ita.51.d: "The Second Economic Battle, the Battle for the Land, will bring a transformation to the land itself. Swamps and marshes shall be drained, farmland will be irrigated, and the people will be encouraged to move to the countryside in order to help our agriculture thrive."
 ita.51.a: "Viva l'Italia!"

 ita.52.t: "The Battle for the Grain"
 ita.52.d: "Following the success of the Battle for the Land comes the Battle for the Grain. The new farmlands will be made to support the growing population of Italy and her armies. An army marches on its stomach after all and the Italian army will be marching to war."
 ita.52.a: "Viva l'Italia!"

 ita.53.t: "The Battle for the Births"
 ita.53.d: "The final of the economic battles is the Battle of the Births. This is a programme designed to help couples have more children. The policies include paid maternal and paternal leave for families and tax benefits and loans for having children, while at the same time the government will only hire men and women who are married. Through such a policy the future generations of Italy shall be created and secured."
 ita.53.a: "Viva l'Italia!"

 ita.54.t: "The Unitary State"
 ita.54.d: "The laws have been passed swiftly in the capital, rescinding the rights and autonomies enjoyed by Lombardy and Venetia - or, indeed, any state that is part of the republic. The ANI party line is that this is 'for the good of the country', an explanation which also applies to the suspension of future elections. Italy cannot afford to weaken itself to greed and outside loyalties, not now and perhaps not ever. This news has not gone over well in Venetia, however, where the state legislators have expressed fury as what they see as a power grab by the central government. Already people are taking to the streets, and we may expect more formal action to be taken in the days to come."
 ita.54.a: "Let's hope this amounts to nothing"

 ita.55.t: "Riots in Venice"
 ita.55.d: "Opposition to the unitary state has grown throughout Italy, with much of it concentrated in the city of Venice. There, Partito Repubblicano Veneto leader Giuseppe Volpi has given fiery speeches denouncing the ANI and calling on 'loyal Venetians' to rise up and fight against its tyranny. Riots have broken out throughout the city, with violence concentrated against central government offices and troops. Officials fear it is just a matter of days before the state legislature takes a vote on whether or not to withdraw from the republic."
 ita.55.a: "As if we would allow such a thing!"

 ita.56.t: "The Venetian Revolt"
 ita.56.d: "As predicted, the vote in Venice - with the controlling Partito Repubblicano Veneto voting unanimously in favour - has led to the declaration of their opposition to the unitary state. Until, and if, state rights are restored they will see the Republic of Venice separated from [ITA.GetNameDef]. Last-minute talks are being held, but at the moment all government troops are being ordered out of Venetia, and militia forces are quickly being assembled - most likely with aid and assistance by the Austrians."
 ita.56.a: "This cannot be allowed to stand"
 ita.56.b: "Fight for La Serenissima! (Play as Venice)"

 ita.57.t: "The Venetian Revolt"
 ita.57.d: "It appears the experiment of the Italian Republic is truly over. With the ANI having won the Italian elections, they have attempted to turn the nation into a unitary state, stripping the composite states of their rights - and now Venetia has rebelled against them. Venetia has called for our help, though we must wait at least a few months before we can directly intervene without it appearing like we are interested only in conquest. If we do intervene, many within the Austrian government are suggesting that our only interest would be in restoring the old Italian Federation, this time under a Habsburg ruler. Indeed, the Italians are so fed up with this failure of democracy, they might welcome such an option with open arms."
 ita.57.a: "We will need to watch this carefully"

 ita.58.t: "War with Venice"
 ita.58.d: "The Venetian rebellion grows even worse and armed militias are forcing out loyal and patriotic Italians. This can not stand. We must move quickly - if we do not demonstrate within a matter of months that we have the situation under control, we run the risk of interventions by the Austrians or, far worse, the Socialist Republic of Italy feeling bold enough to attack without drawing international ire."
 ita.58.a: "Time to put these Venetians in their place"

 ita.60.t: "The Verona Trials"
 ita.60.d: "Today in the city of Verona the trial for the leaders of the Socialist Republic of Italy is has begun. Unsurprisingly Mussolini and his lot are found guilty of betraying Italy and sentenced to death. This turns out to be the fate for the rest of the leadership of the false republic. Syndicalism is now dead."
 ita.60.a: "Death to Mussolini and his traitors!"

 ita.61.t: "Let Carina Massone Negrone Fly?"
 ita.61.d: "With the republic now at war, Carina Massone Negrone has asked to fly for the Republic's Air Force. It is highly unusual that a lady would make such a request, and a number of ministers believe that she should be refused. However, as a personal friend, the great statesman [ITA_GetNatPopLeader] believes that a compromise could be reached where she can lead a force of female aviators to fly non-combat missions. This would allow more men to actually fly."
 ita.61.a: "Let her fly!"
 ita.61.b: "She should stay at home."
 ita.61.c: "Let her set up a school."

 ita.62.t: "The Order of the Roman Eagle"
 ita.62.d: "The order of the Roman Eagle has been created to reward people who brought merit to Italy. It is considered the highest reward that any person can receive in service of the country. This new order will help inspire people to do their all for Italy."
 ita.62.a: "Let us honour these men."

 ita.63.t: "The Corporatist State"
 ita.63.d: "By decree of Il Duce himself, the National Council of Corporations has been created. The council is to be organised along corporatist lines with ten different sectors, with ministers representing the various sectors of the economy. In the official decree it was described as - 'the National Council of Corporations is to the Italian economy what the Staff is in the Armed Forces - the thinking brain which prepares and coordinates.'"
 ita.63.a: "Avanti Italia!"

 ita.64.t: "Opera Nazionale Balilla"
 ita.64.d: "The Opera Nazionale Balilla was recently created by order from Il Duce. Taking its name from the nickname of the Italian boy which started a revolt against Hapsburg forces during the war of Austrian succession. The organisation is similar to a scouting group for children. The organisation has two similar structures one for boys and the other for girls with both being divided into three groups for different age brackets. The organisation is to help prepare the future youth to the roles that they will have within society as well as make sure that they are loyal Italians."
 ita.64.a: "Book and rifle, perfect Italian."

 ita.65.t: "Opera Nazionale Dopolavoro"
 ita.65.d: "The Opera Nazionale Dopolavoro (National Recreational Club) has been created by decree from Il Duce. The OND supports a number of recreational activities for the people to help boost tourism, as well as help ensure the loyalty of citizens to the Italian State. Italian culture from Opera, plays, and music to book clubs and vacations through the countryside are sponsored by the OND. It has quickly proven to be highly popular throughout the Republic."
 ita.65.a: "Avanti Italia!"

 ita.66.t: "Creation of OVRA"
 ita.66.d: "In order to protect the Republic and all Italians from all threats, the Organizzazione per la Vigilanza e la Repressione dell'Antinazionalismo (Organisation for Vigilance and Repression of Anti-Nationalism) or, OVRA for short, has been created. The OVRA will function as the secret police for the republic and make sure that all those within the republic that dare betray the Italian State will be severely punished."
 ita.66.a: "Everything within the state, nothing outside the state, nothing against the state."

 ita.67.t: "The ANI and the House of Savoy"
 ita.67.d: "Since its origins, the ANI has been a monarchist movement, coming from the liberal institutions of the Kingdom. With its few republican members following d'Annunzio and later on betraying anti-Socialism in the name of anti-Austrianism, the ANI under the old admiral Ciano made its monarchism a point of pride.\n\nHowever, being now empowered in Milan, we are in an awkward position; the royalist government in Cagliari refuses to recognise us, and many civil servants who have sworn their loyalty to the Republic have some reservations with our hails to the King. We remain in a limbo, an effectively republican government with clear monarchist sympathies; the question now is whether we continue hailing a King who might not sit on our throne in the forseeable future."
 ita.67.a: "Tone down the monarchist slogans."
 ita.67.b: "We remain true to our convictions!"

 ita.68.t: "Blueshirt Brigades"
 ita.68.d: "The Blueshirts, founded during the Civil War, are formally the Sempre Pronti per la Patria e per il Re (Always Ready for King and Fatherland) or SP for short, but are most often called by their informal name due to their distinctive blue shirts. The Blueshirts are organised in a military fashion modelled on the Arditi soldiers, which also extends to the Uniforms. While they have been muscle for the ANI for some time, now that we are at war, they have stepped up to defend the nation from all enemies."
 ita.68.a: "Death to the enemies of Italy!"

 ita.69.t: "Admirals Join the Venetian Revolt!"
 ita.69.d: "Admirals Alberto Da Zara and Gino Pavesi have decided to join in the revolt against our authority as they decry our government as tyrannical. Unfortunately, they have managed to take the [ITA.GetAdjective] fleet with them."
 ita.69.a: "They shall pay for their treachery!"

 ita.81.t: "Empower the Federation in Italy?"
 ita.81.d.early_demands: "The Italian Republic is a threat, whether they admit it or not. Though they may claim to be part of the Federation, they could easily betray us after taking Torino, thinking themselves powerful enough. We must request that they reorganise their government to be more like the Federation they ostensibly are."
 ita.81.d.yes_i_can: "With the godless syndicalists in the Socialist Republic of Italy now destroyed, the question of what to do about the Republic of Italy has arisen. The threat of the Socialist Republic of Italy has always kept the alliance in check and the Republic acted as a bulwark against the tide of Syndicalism. Now that threat is gone, and the question is whether should we send an ultimatum to demand that the Republic reform into a Federation, something that will be more acceptable to Vienna. Alternately, we could always drop the matter."
 ita.81.a: "Send the Ultimatum"
 ita.81.b: "Drop the Matter"

 ita.82.t: "The Austrian Ultimatum"
 ita.82.d.early_demands: "The Austrians have renewed active foreign policy, and as part of this new drive has demanded that we reform our government to be more like the Italian Federation we claim to be. With [SRI.GetNameDef] watching us hungrily, we can hardly afford to squabble with our protector."
 ita.82.d.yes_i_can: "The Austrians have sent us an ultimatum. With [SRI.GetNameDef] no longer around, we are no longer a necessary bulwark against syndicalism, and so they seek to make us empower the long behind the scenes Federation Council. We can, of course, accept and crown Peter Ferdinand as Head of the Italian Federation, or we can say no and risk war."
 ita.82.a: "We accept"
 ita.82.b: "We refuse!"

 ita.83.t: "The Italians Accept"
 ita.83.d: "The Italians have accepted our ultimatum and Peter Ferdinand will soon be crowned Pietro Ferdinando of Tuscany and Head of the Italian Federation."
 ita.83.a: "God save Italia!"

 ita.84.t: "The Italians Refuse"
 ita.84.d: "The Italians have rejected our ultimatum. Should we show them what a foolish mistake they made, or drop the matter?"
 ita.84.a: "War it shall be!"
 ita.84.b: "Drop the matter"

 ita.85.t: "Death of Costanzo Ciano"
 ita.85.d.not_in_power: "News reach us that admiral Costanzo Ciano has died suddenly last night. The old Admiral had been hailed a hero due to his actions in Buccari during the Great War; a nationalist and a monarchist, he refused to follow Badoglio in Cagliari and instead remained \"on the frontline against Austria and Syndicalism\". The last two decades of his life were marked by his political activism inside the Italian Nationalist Association, of which he became leader; in this capacity his name was heavily tarnished by the events following the 1936 elections, after which he'd effectively been forced to retreat from politics. Still, the Navy mourns the death of a hero.\n\nIn the vestiges of the ANI, Luigi Federzoni has managed to make Admiral Ciano's son Gian Galeazzo accept the nomination as party leader, though the broken movement is unlikely to ever gain power on its own."
 ita.85.d.in_power: "Admiral Costanzo Ciano, the Hero of Buccari, the new Duce of the Italian Nation, died suddenly during an official state dinner. While already in advanced age, the Admiral had not shown signs of disease prior, and his unexpected death caused great outpourings of grief from the proletarian masses of the country. A monarchist and a nationalist who did not compromise the nation's safety for political convenience, Ciano had refused to follow the cowardly Badoglio in Cagliari and instead remained \"on the frontline against Austria and Syndicalism\"; eventually, he rose to power in Milan, leading a movement of Italy's best towards the country's redemption.\n\nInside the ANI, many men scrambled to fill the void; party secretary Luigi Federzoni seemed to be the natural choice, however this encountered the opposition of Alessandro Sardi and the Blueshirts. In the end Admiral Ciano's son Gian Galeazzo was selected as a compromise successor. A veteran diplomat, the younger Ciano is a known monarchist and anglophile, though his personal convictions don't really matter: he's unlikely to ever escape the tight control of the party factions."
 ita.85.a: "A fine patriot, ruined by his terrible politics."
 ita.85.b: "Let us mourn one of Italy's great heroes."

 ita.90.t: "Restore the Monarchy?"
 ita.90.d: "With Italy unified, only one thing remains to be done before we can claim to have fulfilled the will of the Nation and brought it back from the brink of destruction; that is, the restoration of the Monarchy.\n\nOf course, despite our monarchist allegiances things are not so simple. For several years the State has gone on without the King at the helm; and the King in Sardinia made no overtures to our regime. However, now that Sardinia is no more we can restore the rightful King to the throne - that is Prince Umberto, who was illegally deprived of his titles in 1919. Still, in our years of rule many have cozied up with the idea of informal republicanism, and some even question the need to put any kind of roadblocks to the absolute power of the Italian Nationalist Association - which the Monarchy would eventually end up being."
 ita.90.a: "We shall reinstate the rightful King."
 ita.90.b: "We have grown beyond them."

 ita.89.t: "The Anni di Piombo"
 ita.89.d: "A number of Blueshirts of the Associazione Nazionalista Italiana, led by their leader Alessandro Sardi, have denounced the government and proclaimed war against [ITA.GetNameDef] and her \"false foreign nobles\". This declaration was quickly met with a bloody gunfight in a number of small towns that were taken over by the ANI, though in larger towns like Verona and Padua the attack by the ANI was repelled by the army and police. This war is already being called by journalists within and without the Federation as the Anni di Piombo or 'Years of Lead'. Let us hope this does not last that long."
 ita.89.a: "They shall pay."

 ita.94.t: "Assassination Attempt Foiled"
 ita.94.d.habsburg: "Today an attempt on life of the head of the Federation, Grand Duke Pietro Ferdinando, was foiled by the brave men of the Carabinieri. The news has shaken the government and the people have already declared their wish for the ANI to be found. However, a spokesman for the ANI has declared that next time they will not fail at ridding the world of the 'Austrian lapdog'."
 ita.94.d.visconti: "Today an attempt on life of the head of the Federation, Count Marcello Visconti, was foiled by the brave men of the Carabinieri. The news has shaken the government and the people have already declared their wish for the ANI to be found. However, a spokesman for the ANI has declared that next time they will not fail at ridding the world of the 'false king'."
 ita.94.d.volpi: "Today an attempt on life of the head of the Federation, Giuseppe Volpi, was foiled by the brave men of the Carabinieri. The news has shaken the government and the people have already declared their wish for the ANI to be found. However, a spokesman for the ANI has declared that next time they will not fail at ridding the world of the 'Venetian poof'."
 ita.94.a: "Thank God!"

 ita.95.t: "Minister assassinated"
 ita.95.d: "Today a member of parliament, known for his outspoken royal views, was assassinated by one of the ANI as he was giving a speech in Padua. While the Assassin was caught, the leaders of the ANI still remain at large."
 ita.95.a: "Damn ANI."

 ita.96.t: "The ANI Strike"
 ita.96.d: "Today the Blueshirts of the ANI managed to capture the city of Brescia. The fall of Brescia to these terrorists represents the greatest victory for the ANI in their war against the regime so far. The people of Brescia have welcomed them as liberators, flying a flag of Italy with its centre coat of arms cut out. Blueshirts patrol the streets of the city and violence against anyone suspected of being a monarchist has already begun."
 ita.96.a: "We must reclaim Brescia!"

 ita.97.t: "Liberation of Brescia"
 ita.97.d: "We finally were able to liberate the city of Brescia from the ANI scum. The battle was bloody and fighting was block by bloody block but we were able to drive them out of the city. Though the ANI were welcomed at first as liberators, the terror the Blueshirts inflicted in their purge of monarchists soured their opinions. Today the Army is being welcomed as the real liberators of the city."
 ita.97.a: "They're on the run."

 ita.98.t: "Ringleaders caught"
 ita.98.d: "Earlier today, several of the ringleaders behind the ANI organisation were apprehended by Carabinieri investigators. This is a serious blow to the nationalistic terrorists, and brings the country one step closer to eliminating them for good."
 ita.98.a: "It's only a matter of time."

 ita.99.t: "The Anni di Piombo is over"
 ita.99.d: "Today, we have declared victory against the ANI terrorists. They are finally destroyed. No more will these far-right nationalists trouble our country."
 ita.99.a: "Finally they are destroyed."

 ita.102.t: "Creation of the Mille Miglia"
 ita.102.d: "With Italy once again reunited a number of automotive companies and auto-enthusiasts have come up with what they believe will be the premier racing competition in Italy - The Mille Miglia. The Mille Miglia or 'Thousand Miles' starts in Brescia and goes all the way down to Rome before returning via a different route to Brescia."
 ita.102.a: "See them go!"

 ita.103.t: "The Palazzo Mezzanotte"
 ita.103.d: "In Milan, the Palazzo Mezzanotte was unveiled today. The Palazzo Mezzanotte is to be the replacement for the old Stock Exchange of the Republic, designed with a tasteful mixture of neoclassical and modern architecture. With Black Monday now dissipating, the Palazzo Mezzanotte is already being considered the principal stock exchange in Italy."
 ita.103.a: "Money is good."

 ita.104.t: "Legnano"
 ita.104.d: "Today, the Historical Epic film 'Legnano' was released across the republic to widespread acclaim. The film tells the story of the Holy Roman Emperor Barbarossa and his attempt to control Italy, leading to the creation of the Lombard League and the Battle of Legnano. It was directed by Romolo Marcellini, and stars Fosco Giachetti, Luisa Ferida, and Osvaldo Valenti and funded by the ANI. Due to obvious parallels with the Austrian Empire, it has drawn criticism from the Austrians, despite that the Italian public seems to enjoy the film."
 ita.104.a: "Today we expel the Black Eagle from Lombardy!"

 ita.105.t: "1936 Cansiglio Earthquake"
 ita.105.d: "In the early hours before dawn, the regions of Northeastern Italy on the Cansiglio were shaken by a terrific earthquake. Tragically 19 people were killed and countless more injured. Many of the smaller towns in the region were destroyed or damaged."
 ita.105.a: "May God save them."

 ita.106.t: "Anniversary of the Golden Ambrosian Republic"
 ita.106.d: "500 years ago in Milan, the citizens of the city chased out the Visconti and set up a Republic in the city. Though the city would be betrayed and become a monarchy again, the ideas of the Republic still resonate with the people in and around Milan. Within Milan, there is a big celebration and a week-long festival celebrating the 500th anniversary of their attempt at a republic."
 ita.106.a: "Long live the Republic!"

 ita.107.t: "Milan Fashion Week"
 ita.107.d: "With the economy strong, a number of fashion designers in Milan have decided to set up a week-long event in the Spring so that Milan, and with her Italy, can become the fashion capital of the world. Already a number of the various fashion companies are working to make sure that Milan takes pride of place among the cultural and fashion capitals of the world."
 ita.107.a: "Milan shall be the fashion capital of the world!"

 ita.108.t: "Carina Massone Negrone Sets a New Record"
 ita.108.d: "The famed Italian aviator Carina Massone Negrone has set a new record for aviation by flying up to 12,043 metres (39,402 feet) in her biplane and breaking a new record. A personal friend of [ITA_GetNatPopLeader] himself, her new record has made her popular within the republic, especially in nationalist circles."
 ita.108.a: "A new record for Italy."

 ita.109.t: "Gabriella Angelini's Solo Flight"
 ita.109.d: "Gabriella 'Gaby' Angelini has just completed her solo trip from Delhi. Already famous for visiting eight different countries, the young Aviator has become one of the most popular figures within Italy. At 25 years old she has captivated the people within the republic and even from outside of the republic. The Corriere della Sera was quoted as writing, 'This young Italian girl showed how females can be daring and not lose any of their truly exquisite femininity'."
 ita.109.a: "Three cheers for Gaby Angelini!"

 ita.110.t: "The Enciclopedia Italiana"
 ita.110.d: "The Enciclopedia Italiana project has finally been completed. The Enciclopedia Italiana di Scienze, Lettere ed Arti or just 'Enciclopedia Italiana' for short is a 35 volume encyclopaedia of the sciences and arts. Meant to showcase the intellectual might of the ANI who sponsored it, it has proven rather popular throughout the intellectual community of the Republic. Even those that against the ANI find the work an achievement to be proud of."
 ita.110.a: "A valuable work, regardless of the intent."

 ita.120.t: "The War Against Italy"
 ita.120.d: "We are losing badly in the war against [ITA.GetNameDef]. While it's possible we might still be able to turn things around, we do have another option: offer them our lands in southern Tyrol and the Littoral, and hope they will take that offer and leave us be. If they do not... it is entirely possible they might reach all the way to Vienna, and then our empire is lost to us for good."
 ita.120.a: "Let's end this while we can."
 ita.120.b: "Surrender to the Italians? Never!"

 ita.121.t: "Austria Proposes Peace"
 ita.121.d.nogermany: "The Austrians are on the run, and have clearly realised they stand no chance against our forces. They have offered to turn over all our claimed territory, though there are some in the [ROOT.GetAdjective] leadership who are suggesting that now might be the time to defeat them utterly and force their subjugation. That option does not enjoy popular support, though it does hold some appeal."
 ita.121.d.germanycanlimited: "The Austrians are on the run, and have clearly realised they stand no chance against our forces. The question before us now is how far we push our demands. Push too far, or refuse to make peace at all, and [GER.GetNameDef] might decide to intervene on behalf of their old ally. Defy them, and we could end up at war with the entire Reichspakt. That is, of course, if the Germans agree to intervene at all."
 ita.121.d.germanycannotlimited: "The Austrians are on the run, and have clearly realised they stand no chance against our forces. Forced to attend peace talks, we are the ones who find ourselves in a conundrum. Austria is unwilling to give up anything they hold, and should we push our claims or refuse to make peace they have threatened to turn to [GER.GetNameDef] for support. Defy them, and we could end up at war with the entire Reichspakt. That is, of course, if the Germans agree to intervene at all."
 ITA_germany_may_intervene: "§Y[AUS.GetNameDef]§! will call on §Y[GER.GetNameDef]§! to intervene in the peace talks\n"
 ita.121.a: "We will keep our land claims limited"
 ita.121.b: "No, we will push for all our claims!"
 ita.121.c: "Let us end this now"
 ita.121.d: "We intend to wipe out the Austrians completely"

 ita.122.t: "Venetia is Lost"
 ita.122.d: "The war against [ITA.GetNameDef] has definitely not gone as planned. We were unable to prevent them from overtaking Venetia, and now we must make the decision whether to continue the war or pull out completely and leave Italy to its own fate. Any peace could be temporary, of course - it's not impossible that the Italians could turn around and attack us again, but perhaps the breather would be worth it?"
 ita.122.a: "We must pull out at once"
 ita.122.b: "Surrender to the Italians? Never!"

 ita.123.t: "Austria Withdraws from Venice"
 ita.123.d: "We have taken control over Venetia, despite the Austrian intervention, and now they are busy pulling their troops out as quickly as they can. So much for their lordship over Italy."
 ita.123.a: "We will come for them later."

 ita.126.t: "Venice Has Fallen"
 ita.126.d: "Venice has fallen to the forces of [SRI.GetNameDef], and now they threaten [Root.GetNameDef] itself. Should we call an end to this war, while we still can?"

 ita.127.t: "Austria in Trouble"
 ita.127.d: "[From.GetNameDefCap] has pushed far into Austria, and apparently intends to conquer the entire thing instead of sticking to its claims. It is clearly dangerous."
 ita.127.a: "We should help Austria!"
 ita.127.b: "There is nothing we can do"

 ita.128.t: "The German Intervention"
 ita.128.d: "It seems that [From.GetNameDef] has become alarmed by our aggressive invasion of [AUS.GetNameDef]. Fearing our intention is to conquer it outright, the Germans have come to the aid of their former Weltkrieg allies."
 ita.128.a: "Damn it!"

 ita.130.t: "The Italian Demands"
 ita.130.d: "The Italians have demanded every bit of land they have a claim on, owned either by us or our subject states. We do have the option of turning to our old allies in [GER.GetNameDef] and asking for their intervention... that would, at least, force the Italians to keep their demands more limited, even if it would make [Root.GetNameDef] look weak."
 ita.130.a: "We ARE weak - appeal to the Germans"
 ita.130.b: "Give the Italians whatever they want"

 ita.131.t: "No German Intervention"
 ita.131.d: "It seems the Austrian threat was as much hot air as their military capabilities. There will be no German intervention in the peace talks, and we will get all the land we claim."
 ita.131.a: "Excellent!"

 ita.132.t: "The Austrians are in Trouble"
 ita.132.d: "Amazingly, it appears as if [AUS.GetNameDef] is incapable of holding [ITA.GetNameDef] at bay. The Italians have forced them into peace talks. The Austrians have approached us, however, saying that the Italians have demanded too much territory, and are asking for our intervention. Doing so makes us look good, but it does mean we risk war should the Italians refuse."
 ita.132.a: "Of course we will help our old allies"
 ita.132.b: "The Austrians are on their own"

 ita.133.t: "The Germans Have Refused"
 ita.133.d: "It seems our ties with [GER.GetNameDef] do not run as deeply as we thought. They have refused our request, and we are left with no choice but to submit to the full Italian demands."
 ita.133.a: "Alas!"

 ita.134.t: "The Germans Have Agreed"
 ita.134.d: "The German government has agreed to our request for an intervention! Surely the Italians will back down on their unreasonable demands and make peace now?"
 ita.134.a: "How humiliating for us, even so"

 ita.135.t: "The Germans Have Intervened"
 ita.135.d: "While it is outrageous that they would stick their noses where they're not welcome, the Germans have agreed to aid their old Austrian allies. Their diplomats have informed us that either we restrict ourselves to modest gains only or they will turn the power of the entire Reichspakt upon us."
 ita.135.a: "Very well, we accept their terms"
 ita.135.b: "Never! Bring on all their armies!"

 ita.150.t: "Withdrawal from the Italian Republic"
 ita.150.d: "Black Monday has hit [AUS.GetNameDef] hard... hard enough that many of our companies have been forced to withdraw from [ITA.GetNameDef]. Not only has our economic hold over the Italians weakened, we also cannot afford to maintain our occupation forces there. For good or ill, [ITA.GetNameDef] is now effectively independent. We will have to maintain a working relationship with them, at least until we can restore our own strength."
 ita.150.a: "Our sphere of influence retracts."

 ita.151.t: "The Austrian Withdrawal"
 ita.151.d: "Black Monday has hit [AUS.GetNameDef] hard. Their markets have plunged so low that many Austrian stockholders of Austro-Italian companies have panicked and sold countless bonds to native Italians, weakening the Austrian stranglehold over our economy. Not only have we rid ourselves of foreign economic influence, the Austro-Hungarian Reichskriegsminister has recalled the divisions stationed in our territory, unable to afford the financial burden of keeping us safe from what many in Vienna foolishly believe to be an empty Socialist threat. For good or ill, [ITA.GetNameDef] is now effectively independent of Austrian domination, at least until they regain their full strength. Many Italians are worried about whether or not this will leave us exposed to attack by [SRI.GetNameDef]. A war right now would be a terrible prospect."
 ita.151.a: "Is this a step towards a free Italy?"

 ita.152.t: "ANI Protests Elections"
 ita.152.d: "Massive demonstrations were held today in Milan as well as other cities throughout [Root.GetNameDef], with ANI leader [ITA_GetNatPopLeader], undoubtedly incited by the radical leadership of the Blueshirts, accusing the government of rigging the elections with Austrian assistance. Austrian influence is felt everywhere throughout the country, Ciano said, and suggested that Italians would never have true independence until they overthrew their oppressors. While Ciano has yet to show any true evidence of rigging, his words still found many eager listeners... and there is a growing concern that his cadre of followers might cause trouble for the government."
 ita.152.a: "Outlaw the ANI and shut them down."
 ita.152.b: "Keep a close eye on him - this is still a democracy."

 ita.153.t: "Blueshirts Wreak Havoc"
 ita.153.d: "In response to the recent government crackdown, [ITA_GetNatPopLeader]'s most ardent supporters within the Associazione Nazionalista Italiana, dubbed 'Blueshirts' by the media, have been spreading chaos throughout the nation. Led by \"consul-general\" Alessandro Sardi, they already have been directly implicated in two riots and several bombings, with posters accusing the Italian government of conspiracy and selling out to foreign interests being plastered everywhere in the capital. Their wave of chaos is spreading, and many are accusing Prime Minister [Root.GetLeader] of incompetence for taking too strong a stance against the ANI and provoking the violence."
 ita.153.a: "How long will this go on?"

 ita.154.t: "Anti-Government Demonstrations"
 ita.154.d: "As the terror campaign by the Associazione Nazionalista Italiana continues, protests against the government's inept handling of the violence have erupted throughout the country. The largest of these drew well over a hundred thousand in Milan, bringing the nation to a standstill as protestors threatened to start a national strike if the government does not round up the ANI ringleaders soon. Despite the protests, it is clear that the police actions against Ciano's group are having limited effect - indeed, he appears to be gaining as many followers as he loses to the mass arrests."
 ita.154.a: "We are doing what we can!"

 ita.155.t: "The March on Milan Fails"
 ita.155.d: "With the government crackdown growing more severe in recent days, Consul-General Sardi called on the Blueshirts to march on the parliament building in Milan today - provoking a massive demonstration which turned into a full-on battle in the middle of the city as the police and military took prompt action. With hundreds of casualties, Sardi and his supporters were eventually dispersed. Sardi himself remains at large, however, and despite his failure to enact a coup there are now calls for the government to step down. Opposition parties claim the republic is in chaos and intend to force a vote of confidence in the Italian parliament as soon as possible. On the upside, the whole affair has left the formal leader of the ANI [ITA_GetNatPopLeader] completely politically isolated, as he struggles to retain control of his own party."
 ita.155.a: "At least Ciano is out of the picture."

 ita.156.t: "The Vote of Confidence"
 ita.156.d: "Today the vote of confidence will be held in the Italian parliament. At stake is the very survival of the republic - if the government falls, it will be a clear sign that the system is considered dysfunctional, and many are reluctant to turn to yet another chaotic election campaign. Indeed, members of the nobility have been gathering supporters around them and are already suggesting that an empowerment of the monarchical Federation Council might be preferable. The threat of this has pulled other officials to call for votes in support of the government, no matter what."
 ita.156.a: "The government narrowly survives the vote."
 ita.156.b: "The government falls."

 ita.157.t: "Return to the Federation?"
 ita.157.d: "With the government fallen and faith in the republic destroyed, there are two options for how the government can proceed. One is to restore the power of the Federation, where members of the nobility would take up administrative posts on the Federal Council, to be led either by the Habsburg Grand Duke of Tuscany, Pietro Ferdinando, or Count Marcello Visconti of Lombardy. Elections would be restricted throughout parts of the country and democracy as we know it would end. While many favour the stability that route would bring, there are others, among them Venetian nationalists, who suggest disbanding the Federation in its entirety - the states of Venetia and Lombardy would become independent entities, even though such a separation might only prove an opportunity for outside forces to pounce."
 ita.157.a: "Restore the Federation under the Grand Duke of Tuscany."
 ita.157.b: "Restore the Federation under Count Visconti."
 ita.157.c: "Disband the Republic completely. (Tag Switch to LOM)"
 ita.157.e: "Disband the Republic completely. (Tag Switch to VNC)"

 ita.158.t: "ANI Recruiting in the Military"
 ita.158.d: "The popularity of the Associazione Nazionalista Italiana continues to grow unchecked, and now it appears [ITA_GetNatPopLeader] has been campaigning hard amongst the generals of the Republican army. It is unknown whether any have agreed to join his cause, but rancor against the government has been increasing and many officials fear a coup could be in the offing. Taking a stand against the ANI now, however, could provoke the kind of violence which might drive the army towards supporting Ciano even if they weren't already considering it. What shall we do?"
 ita.158.a: "We must act now, no matter the consequences."
 ita.158.b: "Campaign for our own support and prepare for the worst."

 ita.159.t: "Massive ANI Demonstrations"
 ita.159.d: "As support for the ANI increases, and violent riots in [ITA.GetNameDef] become commonplace, protests against the government's inept handling of the situation have erupted throughout the country. The largest of these drew well over a hundred thousand in Milan, bringing the nation to a standstill as protestors threatened to start a national strike if the government does not deal with the ANI ringleaders soon. Protestors are suggesting that the government's inaction is tantamount to incompetence."
 ita.159.a: "We are doing the best we can!"

 ita.160.t: "The March on Milan"
 ita.160.d: "Alessandro Sardi, leader of the Blueshirts, today called for a massive march on the royal palace in Milan, suggesting that a show of force is the only way to force the government to resign and clear the country of Austrian influence and corruption. Though Ciano himself doesn't seem to be directly involved in the plot, suggesting a potential collapse of his authority in his own party, Sardi's calls for a \"government of veterans\" clearly indicate he's planning to put Ciano in power... if only as a puppet of the Blueshirts.\n\nThe crowds pouring into the central square are massive, and as the Italian police and military move in it is clear that the resulting bloodshed will be horrific. Already, even before it is determined whether Sardi's coup might be successful, there are members of the opposition calling for a vote of confidence concerning the government's handling of the situation. Such calls might be moot, however, if Sardi's sheer numbers win the day..."
 ita.160.a: "Sardi's coup is successful."
 ita.160.b: "Sardi and his supporters are dispersed."

 ita.161.t: "Blueshirt Ringleaders Finally Caught"
 ita.161.d: "After a long manhunt, it appears the leadership of the Blueshirts, including Consul-General Sardi, have been caught and arrested. Most are now awaiting trial, while the country breathes a sigh of relief. [ITA_GetNatPopLeader] has condemned the arrest of the leader of his party's militia; though its independent actions collapsed his authority in the ANI, Ciano has now regained control of a party that is a shadow of its former self. Some call for Ciano's arrest; but the collapse of the ANI as a political force put the government on the track to leniency, if only to avoid reopening this can of worms. Many consider this to be a sign that the worst of [ITA.GetNameDef]'s political struggles are over."
 ita.161.a: "It's about time!"

 ita.170.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Claims [claimed_state.GetName]"
 ita.170.d: "With a resurgence in irredentism since reuniting the country, [From.GetNameDef] has laid claim to the state of [claimed_state.GetName], currently held by [Root.GetNameDef]. [Root.GetAdjective] citizens in the region are understandably alarmed, although native Italians have already started protesting in the streets and demanding that they be reunited with the motherland."
 ita.170.a: "They dare!"

 ita.171.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Abandons the [Root.GetFactionName]"
 ita.171.d: "With a resurgence in irredentism since reuniting the country, [From.GetNameDef] has laid claim to the state of [claimed_state.GetName], currently held by [claimed_state.Owner.GetNameDef]. Since the state is already claimed by a member of the [Root.GetFactionName], the [From.GetAdjective] government has decided that its goals are incompatible with those of the alliance and has elected to withdraw. Whether this means a war with [From.GetNameDef] is in the offing remains to be seen."
 ita.171.a: "A foolish move"

 ita.172.t: "Anti-Syndicalist Partisans Rise Up"
 ita.172.d: "We've always had suspicions that there was an underground network preparing for the day when we and [ITA.GetNameDef] went to war. Their numbers are not overwhelming, but their appearance behind our lines is unexpected, and they have caused a fair amount of disruption throughout the country."
 ita.172.a: "It will change nothing"

 ita.175.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Claims Libya"
 ita.175.d: "Citing the fact that their Libyan colony was only unjustly wrested from Italy thanks to their loss in the Weltkrieg, the [From.GetAdjective] government today announced that it was now claiming the entirety of Tripolitania as their own. Whether that will mean a demand is forthcoming, or even war, remains to be seen."
 ita.175.a: "How dare they!"

 ita.176.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Demands Libya"
 ita.176.d.owns: "The [From.GetAdjective] government has issued an ultimatum to us: turn over all our territory in Tripolitania at once - which they claim, in its entirety - or they will be forced to invade. Already, [From.GetAdjective] ships are crossing the Mediterranean and making their intentions rather obvious."
 ita.176.d.subject: "The [From.GetAdjective] government has issued an ultimatum to us: turn over all our territory in Tripolitania at once. This includes cutting [LBA.GetNameDef] loose from our control. which [From.GetNameDef] would presumably then invade. Already, [From.GetAdjective] ships are crossing the Mediterranean and making their intentions rather obvious."
 ita.176.a: "Fine, give them what they want"
 ita.176.b: "If it's a war they want, they'll get it!"

 ita.177.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Abandons Us"
 ita.177.d: "[From.GetNameDefCap] has responded to a demand by the [From.From.GetAdjective] government, which claims Tripolitania as its own, by agreeing to cut us loose - already [From.GetAdjective] officials and [From.GetAdjective] forces are busy leaving [Root.GetNameDef]. One assumes that a declaration of war from [From.From.GetNameDef] will be forthcoming shortly."
 ita.177.a: "We shall see!"

 ita.178.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Has Relented"
 ita.178.d.give: "Apparently too terrified at the prospect of starting a war with us over the territory, [From.GetNameDef] has relented to our ultimatum and turned over all their owned land within Tripolitania. Diplomacy has won the day!"
 ita.178.d.abandon: "Apparently too terrified at the prospect of starting a war with us over the territory, [From.GetNameDef] has relented to our ultimatum and cut [LBA.GetNameDef] loose. They are no longer responsible for the [LBA.GetAdjective] government and will not protect them. We are free and clear to invade, if we should so wish."
 ita.178.a: "Excellent"

 ita.179.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Has Refused"
 ita.179.d: "The [From.GetAdjective] government has utterly refused our ultimatum. It seems we have little choice but to go to war."
 ita.179.a: "So be it!"

 ita.180.t: "The Italians are Winning"
 ita.180.d: "The war is going poorly. [libya_italy.GetNameDefCap] has succeeded in occupying Tripolitania, and we are so far unable to dislodge them from it. Nor have we been able to occupy any of their mainland territory. Many within the [Root.GetAdjective] government feel that now is the time to sue for peace and stop this war before it goes on any longer."
 ita.180.a: "End this now"
 ita.180.b: "We must keep fighting!"

 ita.181.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Sues for Peace"
 ita.181.d: "It seems the [From.GetAdjective] government has decided it would rather sue for peace than keep on defending Tripolitania. If we end the war now, they will hand it over - and that will be that."
 ita.181.a: "That's all we want"
 ita.181.b: "No, we shall pursue this to the end!"

 ita.182.t: "We Are Losing"
 ita.182.d: "Our attempt to regain Libya has led to disastrous results, and now we are in danger of losing the entire country. Perhaps if we offer to simply give up our claims on Libya entirely, and hand over any lands claimed by [peace_country.GetNameDef] or its allies, they might be willing to simply end things now?"
 ita.182.a: "We must try"
 ita.182.b: "No, we can still win!"

 ita.183.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Sues for Peace"
 ita.183.d: "It seems the [From.GetAdjective] government has decided its pursuit of Libya has come at too high a price. They have offered to give up their claims on Tripolitania entirely, and hand over any land that we or our allies claim (if any exist), if we will simply call off the war now."
 ita.183.a: "Yes, let's end this now"
 ita.183.b: "They started this, now we will see it through"

When the ANI sought to restore the Monarchy they turned not to the Duke of Aosta, tarnished by his reign in Sardinia, but to the former Prince of Piedmont, whom the old admiral Ciano always saw as the only true pretender to the throne.\n\nThis throne is however a gilded cage for the constitutionally-minded Umberto: with his every move watched by the Prime Minister and ANI leaders Federzoni and Sardi, he's forced to sit and wait for new political developments, while the Blueshirts build him an Empire.§!"

 ITA_pietro_ferdinando_leader_desc: "§YBorn:§! §LMay 12th, 1874, in Salzburg, Duchy of Salzburg, Austria-Hungary§!\n§YBackground:§! §LWhile many in Italy dream of great change, others look back to the past - back when things were different. For many of such nostalgics, they look to Garibaldi or Mazzini, for a time when Italy was strong and united. But, there is a minority that look back even further. It would appear that their dream has come true: Grand Duke Pietro Ferdinando d'Asburgo-Lorena has assumed the title of President of the restored Italian Federation, a collection of pre-Risorgimento Italian states. His ascension is no doubt in part as a reward for Austria's loyal patronage of Italian aristocrats and conservatives.\n\nPietro Ferdinando was born in Salzburg to the former Grand Duke Ferdinand IV of Tuscany, one of the larger states in Italy. His father had been deposed, and in exile abdicated his claim to the throne in favour of the Austrian Emperor. The third son of his family and given the political circumstances, Pietro Ferdinando did not expect to be restored to Tuscany and enrolled in the Austrian military.\n\nDuring the Weltkrieg, he served as an infantry commander and aided in the occupation of Northern Italy. As the armistice was first signed, Austrian planners began drafting up plans to restore the old status quo with a small twist: there would be a loose federation led by the Pope to govern Italy and quell Italian nationalistic sentiment. Since his brothers both married morganatically, General Pietro Ferdinand was chosen by Charles to become the new Grand Duke of Tuscany.\n\nThese designs proved to be too ambitious. The Austrian advance never made it to Tuscany, and socialist rebels have overrun the region. Moreover, by 1930 the Federation had collapsed: Sicily and Sardinia left while Austrian troops pulled out of the north. A republic was declared, and Pietro Ferdinand effectively stuck in a legal limbo. At least until now.\n\nTo keep himself entertained, the Hapsburg prince has been known to appreciate the arts. He is distantly related to the House of Bourbon-Parma through his mother's side.§!"

Imprinted with anti-syndicalism from an early age, he briefly worked as an insurance agent before becoming assistant secretary to Augusto de Marsanich in the \"political\" wing of the stateless Council of the Federation in 1936.\n\nHe became crucial in de Marsanich's attempts to build a pro-Austrian, pro-Federation nationalist catholic party outside of the PPI. Though those attempts ultimately went nowhere and the Council of the Federation remained a deeply aristocratic affair, Michelini nevertheless gained de Marsanich's trust and emerged as the only man who could bridge the gap between them and the parties of the liberal right, at least somewhat.\n\nWhen foreign troops sweeped through Italy, de Marsanich immediately offered to have the Council of the Federation form the basis of an \"Italian national committee\", which would have then been turned into a new, allied Italian government. While the federal project was dismissed as an anachronism, the occupation authorities remained interested in his nationalist-catholic movement; as he himself was compromised by his involvement in the Council of the Federation, de Marsanich instead recommended Michelini take leadership as Prime Minister.\n\nNow ruler of a conquered Italy, Michelini works to rebuild the country; together with de Marsanich he calls for collaboration with the occupation forces, and collaborates with the parties of the Centre (and especially the new secretary of the PPI Fernando Tambroni) in the name of anti-syndicalism.§!"

With his grandfather having led the modernisation of the famous Scala Theatre and his father having been a notorious industrialist, the Viscontis of Modrone were already well known when the Austrians handpicked them to lead the new Duchy of Lombardy in the Italian Federation.\n\nWith his father's death in 1923, Marcello became Duke of Lombardy for the next four years; when Bonomi eventually declared the birth of the Italian Republic the Duke was involved in the negotiations for Lombard and Venetian autonomy, as well as ensuring the survival of the Council of the Italian Federation together with the Austrian Peter Ferdinand. Through the years of the Republic, the Duke of Modrone remained socially active, chairing the Milan Exhibition and briefly serving as Mayor of Milan with the support of a conservative coalition.\n\nOnce again propelled to the position of Head of State, Marcello remains a \"Signore\" of old more than an actual politician, and is more involved in Milanese high society than government. Still, his term as Mayor of Milan demonstrates, if not his outright support, at least his acquiescence of conservative politics.§!"

 ITA_emilio_de_bono: "Emilio de Bono"
 ITA_emilio_de_bono_leader_desc: "§YBorn:§! §LMarch 19th, 1866, in Cassano d'Adda, Bergamo, Kingdom of Italy§!\n§YBackground:§! §LTimes have not been very kind to Italy, and it would appear that the life of democracy in the Italian Republic was fleeting. Defeated by foreign powers and with the legacy of Italy's civil war still fresh on the occupiers' minds, Emilio de Bono has been tasked with establishing a provisional military government for Italy. Given the circumstances, it would appear that General de Bono will remain in office for some time to come.\n\nEmilio de Bono was born in Lombardy, a distant descendant of Lombardy nobility. He followed in his father's footsteps and enrolled in military school, studying at Milan and then Modena. An officer in the Bersaglieri, de Bono fought in Eritrea and Libya during the high period of the new Italian kingdom, a time that sadly could not last.\n\nWhen Italy fatefully cast their lot with the Entente in 1915, the then Colonel de Bono was sent to fight against the Austrians. Promoted quickly to Major General and leader of the \"Trapani\" brigade, de Bono distinguished himself and became a decorated officer. During the defence of Mount Grappa at the waning days of the war, de Bono co-wrote the Canzone del Grappa which became a patriotic song despite Italy's ultimate defeat.\n\nIndeed, things began to change quickly after 1918. De Bono was captured when Italy's front lines began to collapse and watched in captivity as Italy rapidly divided into civil war. Austrian authorities, desperate to stabilise their deteriorating hold in northern Italy, had de Bono released with his men to serve in Italy's White Army against the red tide. The ensuing awkward arrangement between the Federation and the Republic did not affect de Bono's new career - he briefly became Director General of Public Security in Bonomi's government during the early days as the situation stabilised in Lombardy and Venetia. Despite a controversial term, which included the high profile murders of political dissidents, he nonetheless became a Marshal of Italy.\n\nNow, with a new government installed, de Bono is seen as an elderly figurehead for foreign rule. While many have criticised him for his heavy handed policies and he has been accused of being sympathetic to Ciano and his legionnaires, the new military government is nonetheless expected to keep lumbering on.§!"

 ITA_giovanni_gronchi: "Giovanni Gronchi"
 ITA_giovanni_gronchi_leader_desc: "§YBorn:§! §LSeptember 10th, 1877, in Pontedera, Pisa, Kingdom of Italy§!\n§YBackground:§! §LIn a country dominated by Roman Catholics, it was perhaps no surprise when Giovanni Gronchi and the Italian's People's Party (PPI) took charge of the young Italian Republic. This coalition, dominated by Christian Democrats, promises to guide the Italian nation using Christian social teachings - contrasting with anti-clerical factions on the left while still promoting welfare and labour issues opposed by the right.\n\nThe man at the helm of the PPI is Giovanni Gronchi, a Tuscan-born follower of Father Romolo Murri, one of the early founders of Christian democracy in Italy. Initially a highschool teacher with a degree in literature from the University of Pisa, when the Weltkrieg broke out Gronchi fought as an infantry officer\n\nWhen the war ended, Giovanni Gronchi returned as a decorated soldier to a deteriorating political situation at home. Fearful of anti-Catholic violence, he fled Tuscany and went to Milan. There, Father Luigi Sturzo began to organise the PPI for the first time with the blessing of Rome and Vienna. Unlike the other Christian Democratic parties emerging in post-civil war Italy, the PPI found themselves under a Republic and proved to be comfortable serving both under the Austrian imposed federation and Bonomi's republican system.\n\nGronchi's activities as a PPI activist and representative have been varied. In addition to being a reasonably successful businessman, industrialist and salesperson, he was also notable for helping organise Catholic trade unions in an effort to undercut syndicalist influence and win better concessions for the workers. One of the more left-leaning members of the PPI, his ascension into leadership was not a sure thing. When Luigi Sturzo resigned as leader of the PPI, Gronchi took power as part of a triumvirate with Giulio Rodinò and Giuseppe Spataro. Together they formed a front against the rising Legionairism in Italy, hoping to organise the remaining democratic parties against them.\n\nGronchi's election as President of Italy now confirms the influence of the PPI in Italian politics. While some have criticised him for actions seen as conciliatory to socialists and syndicalists, his commitment to parliamentary democracy and his willingness to engage in some economic reform makes him a stable candidate to guide Italy for the near future.§!"

 ITA_luigi_einaudi: "Luigi Einaudi"
 ITA_luigi_einaudi_leader_desc: "§YBorn:§! §LMarch 24th, 1874, in Carrù, Cuneo, Kingdom of Italy§!\n§YBackground:§! §LSometimes, despite all the chaos and all rapid changes engulfing a nation, it is easier to go back to the way things used to be. The triumph of the Italian Liberal Party is proof of that fact, and with the reemergence of the dominant party of the early 1900s, it would appear that the status quo of old has returned. But not everything is the same - Luigi Einaudi is a new man promising a new day in Italy. Under his careful eye, liberalism will flourish in Italy and will be more than just a capitalistic vehicle for political control. Rather, it will be an expansive ideology reflecting integrated approach to moral, economic and social reasoning.\n\nBorn in 1874 to a small town in Piedmont to a minor bureaucratic family, Einaudi was orphaned at age 14. He went to school in Turin, studying economics under Salvatore Cognetti de Martiis. A socialist in university and a collaborator with Critica Sociale, his time as a magazine contributor ended with a move towards liberal thought. He spent a significant portion of his life in academia, teaching finance at schools in Turin and Milan.\n\n1919 changed everything, not just for Italy but also for a young Einaudi. The middle aged professor found himself at Bocconi University in occupied Milan as socialist and nationalist revolutionaries began to overrun major cities and towns across the country. With many of his students dropping out to join a cause, Einaudi became inspired to find a movement of his own. He was introduced to national politics by Francesco Saverio Nitti during the chaotic early days of the Italian Federation, and soon became an outspoken member of the PLI\n\nAlthough Nitti remained with the Sicilian government after the Federation collapsed, Einaudi stayed with Federation leadership in Lombardy and joined the Republican government. He helped to reorganise the liberals, rallying them against the aristocratic influence of the Austrians and their Federationist allies as well as the nationalistic legionaires under Ciano. Instead, he has chosen to offer a vision of an Italy with the utmost respect for human liberty and encouraging the individual to pursue a form of self actualisation away from the dominance of the state. He also dreams of a European federalism, distinct from the false and exploitative \"federation\" imposed by the Hapsburgs, one where European peoples work together to keep the red tide at bay and to promote individual civil liberties across the continent.§!"

 ITA_marcello_soleri: "Marcello Soleri"
 ITA_marcello_soleri_leader_desc: "§YBorn:§! §LApril 28th, 1882, in Cuneo, Kingdom of Italy§!\n§YBackground:§! §LEven as times change and politicians come and go, it can be reassuring for many that a familiar face is at the helm. Marcello Soleri is one of those faces, a long time political figure in the Italian Liberal Party from even before the Weltkrieg. Before the chaos that engulfed Italy. His vision for Italy marks a return to the old, liberal dominated order - challenging the Catholics to the right and the socialists to the left.\n\nSoreli was born in Cuneo, a small town near Turin. His parents were active in local politics, and instilled a powerful sense of duty into their sons. After studying at the University of Turin and receiving a degree in law, funded in significant amounts by family friends such as Giovanni Giolitti, Soleri became a part time journalist and a lawyer.\n\nHis early career was marked by a leftist turn, admiring socialists and joining a Masonic Lodge. However, he remained connected to Giolitti - a Liberal party grandee - and helped him campaign to rally moderate Christian opposition to socialism. Soleri became a mayor of Cuneo at age 30 in 1912 as the leader of a liberal-democratic coalition. He began an aggressive job-creating infrastructure development scheme, but transitioned to national politics within a year or so.\n\nAs a member of the chamber of deputies, Soleri frequently broke with the Liberal party, especially when it came to intervention in the Weltkrieg. Initially a \"neutralist\", he joined the Alpini infantry corps as a second lieutenant. He was wounded towards the end of the war, which took him out of the fighting as the Italian front collapsed around him.\n\nAs Ivanoe Bonomi worked to establish a stable government in the civil war, Soleri was invited to become a finance minister. He worked to lower the heavy taxation imposed on the people during the Weltkrieg and civil war, which he saw as choking Italian business. Suspicious of Austrian influence, the Aristocratic Federationists, Socialists and the rising Legionnaires, Soleri worked to minimise these influences while avoiding any direct challenges that would destabilise the state.\n\nRecently, the ascent of the Liberals have propelled Soleri to leadership of the Italian Republic. Now a seasoned politician, it is up to him to ensure that the republic and its leading party remains on top of the challenges ahead.§!"

 ITA_ivanoe_bonomi: "Ivanoe Bonomi"
 ITA_ivanoe_bonomi_leader_desc: "§YBorn:§! §LOctober 18th, 1873, in Mantua, Kingdom of Italy§!\n§YBackground:§! §LTraitor. Sellout. Puppet. Failure. Ivanoe Bonomi has heard it all, but he still diligently fights every day for Italy and the Republic. Being a Prime Minister isn't an easy job for most countries, and certainly not in a divided Italy. When the Sicilians and Sardinians withdrew from the Italian Federation in 1930, then Prime Minister of the Federation Bonomi dissolved the Federation, a bold move that established a new republic and sidelined the foreign-raised monarchs nominally ruling Italy. Subsequently, he was elected Prime Minister of the new Italian Republic, and his willingness to work with the much-maligned Austria, while economically beneficial, continues to draw great internal scrutiny. Bonomi struggles to weather these increasingly virulent criticisms while cementing the republic's political institutions.\n\nIt would be unwise, however, to write off Bonomi as just another Austrian collaborator or political suit. The father of this new Italian Republic actually had his origins as a socialist deputy from Mantua. Born 1873, a generation after first Risorgimento, he grew up a scholar and a journalist as Italy transitioned from a wartime state to a new Kingdom. His moderate views and support for Giolitti's war in Libya saw him expelled from the PSI in 1912, and opted to co-found the Italian Socialist Reformist Party (PSRI).\n\nWhen the Weltkrieg began, he volunteered to go to the front. After a short stint however, he quickly assumed a series of high ranking cabinet positions, with portfolios including Public Works, War, and Treasury. With many other Italian politicians fleeing into exile or retiring from politics in 1919 after the humiliating armistice, Ivanoe Bonomi was one of the few who dared to remain in the government as the Austrians began drafting their peace terms. The deteriorating political situation saw Italy collapse into civil war and Austrian occupation of northern Italy\n\nRealising things have gone out of control and in a desperate bid to attract some liberal support, the Austrians allowed Bonomi to form a compromise provisional democratic government in Milan parallel to their Aristocratic federation project. Bonomi, for his part, dropped his openly socialist views in favour of joining the newly formed Liberal Democrats.\n\nHaving outflanked the Austrians for now, it is up to Bonomi to navigate the treacherous waters ahead if his Republic is to survive.§!"

After decades of leadership under Ivanoe Bonomi, the Liberal Democrats have emerged renewed under Ferruccio Parri. With the support of a wider coalition, Parri hopes for a new era of unity in a tumultuous Italy.\n\nInitially a school teacher in Milan and an editor at Corriere della Sera, the Weltkrieg changed Parri's life forever. Joining as an officer, he was decorated for bravery and was wounded on three separate occasions throughout the war. During the closing days of the war, he was an officer of the Italian General Staff, and was dismayed as the Italian military suffered defeat after defeat at the hands of the combined Austro-German offensive.\n\nParri was part of the Italian military remnant released by the Austrians to help stabilise the situation in the Italian homefront as Italian revolutionaries deposed the monarchy and sought to oust the Austrians from the peninsula. While suspicious of Austrian aims, he feared the rising tide of socialism and used his influence in Milan to organise partisan groups to counter red infiltration. He became moderately known locally for being a staunchly republican editor of the Corriere della Sera, promoting a liberal democratic alternative to syndicalism.\n\nInitially lukewarm towards the Italian Federation imposed by the Austrians, he became an avid supporter of Bonomi's Italian Republic when it was declared in 1930. By that point, he was a manager of Milan's largest electrical company and joined up with Bonomi's newly formed Liberal Democrats.\n\nNow, it is up to Parri to take up the torch of the party and safeguard the democratic, moderate ideals of the Republic.§!"
