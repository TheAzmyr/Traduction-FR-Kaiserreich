 OMA_dhofar_railway: "Dhofar Railway"
 OMA_dhofar_railway_desc: "Now that we have at least one major rail line though Muscat itself, we need to integrate the rest of Oman with this rail line. Goods and citizens from as far away as Dhofar will be able to get across the entire country in less than a day's travel. Of course this stands to benefit our military as well, as faster transportation means faster troops!"
 OMA_port_of_muscat: "Port of Muscat"
 OMA_port_of_muscat_desc: "We have always been a sea trading society, and while our rail makes moving products easier in the country, the real profit comes from when we export goods by sea.

 OMA_commerce_industrialisation_plan: "Commercial Industries Plan"
 OMA_commerce_industrialisation_plan_desc: "Providing incentives to small military manufacturing companies will allow them to expand their production base, speeding up the process of industrialising the process of manufacturing military vehicles and small arms. We need more military factories if we are to keep up with our increasingly aggressive neighbours!"
 OMA_intensify_administration_plan: "Intensify Industrial Initiatives"
 OMA_intensify_administration_plan_desc: "We are confident that with our current industrial plan we will be able to expand our military capacity in an adequate fashion.

 OMA_a_special_relationship_desc: "India has offered to help us run our government in a way that will benefit the Entente. We hesitate at such a bargain in return for our freedom, but the alternative, total annihilation, is not a real option. Let us bend the knee to India in return for our freedom! Others will not be as kind, and our old new overlords will let the Imam keep his place as the head of state."
 OMA_porte_assistance: "The Rauf Pasha Mission"
 OMA_porte_assistance_desc: "It is a harsh truth that we cannot face the strength of the Saudis by ourselves. If we don't want Muscat to fall to the invaders, we must accept the military expedition the Sublime Porte has offered us, as difficult as it might be to convince ourselves of the good intentions of the Ottomans."
 OMA_military_reform: "Implement Ottoman Military Reforms"
 OMA_military_reform_desc: "The mission led by admiral Rauf Pasha has shown us the inadequate state of our military, both in organisation and tactics. With the assistance of the Ottomans, we can kickstart a modernisation of our army."
 OMA_revise_budget: "Reorganise the Administration"
 OMA_revise_budget_desc: "Among the things we should adopt from our new benefactors is their drive to modernise their government. It is necessary for us to begin a grand reorganisation of our administration, to make it more functional and suitable for modern times."

### Intro Screen ###
 OMA_country_intro_header: "Introduction to Oman"
 OMA_country_intro_content: "Oman's splendid isolation did not end with the Weltkrieg and the Sultan hoped it wouldn't end any time soon. However, the wheel of fate stops for no one, and their protectors in Britain and India fell into utter and complete disarray. With Ottoman forces moving into the Trucial States, and an ever more aggressive Ibn Saud in Nejd, it seemed war was coming fast to Oman, and the tale of the Ibadi Sultanate was to finally end.\n\nHowever, the much feared war never came. The warriors mobilised by the state never saw battle against the Ikhwan and the Saudis... Perhaps Ibn Saud has other, more obscure plans in his mind? Regardless of reason, Oman stood alone, and has not received aid from British India in a decade. This may very well become an extremely worrisome state of affairs as instability rapidly spreads throughout the region.\n\nBut to properly fight external threats, internal ones must be properly dealt with. More specifically the Imamate of Oman, and the tribes that have their allegiance to the Hinterlands Imam higher than to Muscat; not to mention the degraded and archaic state of the Monarchy. But if these challenges can be overcome, Oman's tale is not to end so soon."

### Events ###
 oma.10.t: "Imam Loyalists Refuse to Pay Taxes"
 oma.10.d: "The Imamate has long been exempting its loyalists from paying their taxes to our administers which has led to outcry from the citizens who do pay their share. Something will have to be done about this system if we want to ensure a stable system and reduce the power of Imam and likewise factions."
 oma.10.a: "Loyalty should be rewarded!"

 oma.11.t: "Tribal Raids"
 oma.11.d: "Raids from hostile tribes have long plagued the hinterlands of Oman and with Saudi power increasing in the region and ours wavering, they only seem to become even fiercer than before. Our army is doing everything it can to crack down on these bandits but they keep escaping our hold."
 oma.11.a: "Catch these bandits!"

 oma.12.t: "Black Monday Strikes Oman"
 oma.12.d: "Disaster! The Berlin stock exchange has completely collapsed and sent ripples throughout the world, ruining economies and businesses around the globe. While our small agrarian nation has been mostly spared by the catastrophe, foreign investors and businesses are still suffering the consequences and dragging us down with them."
 oma.12.a: "Let us pray for a quick resolution to this crisis."

 oma.14.t: "Ibn Saud Marches on the al-Buraimi Oasis"
 oma.14.d: "Placed on the border between Muscat and the former Trucial States, ownership over the Oasis has been a contested affair for many generations between the Sultans of Muscat and the Emirs further North. With the conquest of the latter by Ibn Saud, he has also taken over these old claims and is using them for his own machinations.\n\nIt is no secret however that Ibn Saud is not planning to stop his advance after taking the Oasis and by claiming that we were once part of the great Wahhabist state, he will surely not stop until the city of Muscat is ablaze and the vile Ikhwan has slaughtered all that oppose him.\n\nThe threat posed by Ibn Saud however has ensured better relations between the Imam and the Sultan as despite their differences, they both strongly adhere to Omani particularism and will stop at nothing to defend their homeland from the invaders."
 oma.14.a: "Dark clouds are brewing over our small nation..."

 OMA_said_ibn_taimur_leader_desc: "§YBorn:§! §LAugust 13th, 1910, in Muscat, Sultanate of Muscat and Oman§!\n§YBackground:§! §LThe Al Said dynasty, which had reaped the benefits of British support in the 19th century, still lives. Following the Treaty of Versailles in 1919, the young Said ibn Taimur accelerated through his political education in Muscat. The former Sultan Taimur ibn Feisal had prepared a wise council for his son in 1935 when he abdicated the throne. Said ibn Taimur was left with a sense of superiority over the Shia in the Trucial coast and the Ibadi tribesman in Oman proper. More concerning was the new Sultan's attitude towards Dhofaris. Said ibn Taimur has taxed them mercilessly, and remained silent to the slave trade that oppresses Dhofar.§!"
