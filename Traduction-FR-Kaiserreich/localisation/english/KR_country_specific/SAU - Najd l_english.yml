### Decisions ###
 SAU_JBS_Power_Struggle: "Preparations for the War of Unification"
 SAU_JBS_Power_Struggle_desc: "For years we have waited for the opportunity to unite the Arabian peninsula under the House of Saud. Sadly the Ottoman watchdogs did not sleep with both eyes closed and when the British Empire fell in 1925, they more than rewarded their Rashidi lapdogs for their \"loyalty\" during the Weltkrieg. As we were left with nothing, devoid of allies and territorial gains, Abdulaziz grew ever more restless and vengeful.\n\nSaud ibn Abd Al-Aziz may be enjoying the support of his Ottoman allies but dark clouds are gathering on the horizon, and should his powerful benefactor find himself occupied in internal matters, his pathetic armies will have to face the Ikhwans rage all on their own...\n\n§gThe strength of our £in_combat §GAllies§! will determine the size of our army at the start of the war with [JBS.GetNameWithFlag]. Courting the Central Arabian tribes and securing assistance from the Ikhwan could help tip the scales in our favour.§!\n      [JBS.GetNameWithFlag] : [?JBS.num_divisions|H0] ([?JBS.tribes|H0])\n      [SAU.GetNameWithFlag] : [?SAU.num_divisions|H0] ([?SAU.tribes|H0])\n"

 SAU_War_of_Unification: "Arabian War of Unification"
 SAU_War_of_Unification_desc: "The Final Struggle for control over the Arab interior is rapidly approaching as the Ottoman behemoth is crackling under the weight of the worldwide economic depression, temporarily unable to maintain peace on the peninsula. All Emirs will have to pick a side for the future of the Arab world will be written in blood and the losers will find themselves disgraced, cast aside or slain on the field of battle."
 SAU_War_of_Unification_Peace: "Imminent Collapse"
 SAU_War_of_Unification_Peace_desc: "Whilst the deserts of Arabia are no strangers to war, its economy and agrarian base can not sustain long conflicts without intermittent armistices and decisive victories. Should either the House of Rashid or Saud find itself on the verge of victory, the other will have no choice but to admit that it does not have the capacity to sustain a lengthy siege or a war of attrition."

 SAU_Ikhwan_Rides_Out: "The Ikhwan Rides Out"
 SAU_Ikhwan_Rides_Out_desc: "The Ikhwan or 'The Brethren' is a tribal militia used by Ibn Saud as a key element within our army. Zealous religious warriors, they are not bound by loyalty to Ibn Saud but by allegiance to the strict morals of Islamic society. Renouncing all Western advances, the Ikwhan wish to purify the Islamic world of its decadence and unite all Muslims in a single unitary state.\n\nNonetheless they are an unruly and barbaric force, slitting the throats of all male prisoners they encounter and fighting with swords and lances. This makes them a worthy asset however to Ibn Saud, as their zealotry and bloodthirstiness is used in their infamous raids on the territories of our neighbours."

 SAU_Join_Cairo_Pact_desc: "Times have changed and the once undefeatable Ottoman war machine has lost steam. With Arab nations and groups flocking to the green banner of Egypt who clamours to fight for the liberation and glory of the Arab peoples, our Emir as well questions his relation to the Porte. We already had a whiff of freedom these last few years so after all... why not? Why shouldn't we keep it?"
 SAU_Leave_Cairo_Pact: "Leave the Cairo Pact"
 SAU_Leave_Cairo_Pact_desc: "Fighting side by side with the Egyptians, we were able to beat the Turks. With this task done, it is time to end this marriage of convenience. We shall strike out on our own, and lead the Arabs ourselves!"

 SAU_Conquer_the_Imamate: "Invade the Imamate of Oman"
 SAU_Conquer_the_Imamate_desc: "The duality of power in Muscat & Oman is greatly hampering their capacity to resist the Ikhwan and has left vast swathes of land defended solely by its local inhabitants. With the Ottoman Empire doubting the cost of sustained operations in the region and an Imamate refusing to cooperate with their troops, we have a window of opportunity to invade and destroy them before Oman & Muscat can form a united front."

 SAU_saudi_hegemony: "Saudi Hegemony"
 SAU_saudi_hegemony_desc: "Our allies have served their purpose. With the Rashids's and their allies gone, no tribe has the means to stand in our way. A new era begins for Arabia, and the Saudis call all the shots now."

 SAU_consolidating_fringe_arabia_desc: "As the flames of war lessen, we can finally set roots on the rich region of Yemen.

 SAU_tighten_control_arabia: "Tighten Control over Arabia"
 SAU_tighten_control_arabia_desc: "There have been many years since we held Ha'il and the surrounding areas, and many of our old allies have forgotten their allegiances. Paying visits and showing respect to these lords, and convincing them our just intentions, will, God willing, take not much time."
 SAU_purge_rashidi: "Purge the Rashidis"
 SAU_purge_rashidi_desc: "The last of the Rashidis are in hiding, both on lands we control and abroad. The only way to truly consolidate our rule and to end delusions of grandeur from lesser houses for good is to end their line, in a definitive fashion"
 SAU_purge_ikhwan: "Purge the Ikhwan"
 SAU_purge_ikhwan_desc: "The Ikhwan have fulfilled their mission of liberating Arabia from the yoke of undeserving lords, and yet dared to revolt against the hand that fed them.

 SAU_cleansing_of_heresy: "Cleansing of Heresy"
 SAU_cleansing_of_heresy_desc: "Too many Turkish double agents, Rashid and Hashmid loyalists and even atheist syndicalists roam the streets in the lands of Arabia. Their sinful lives revolve around spreading unrest and we will ensure they can't do that."

 SAU_law_of_faith_desc: "A new law is in place of Arabia; the Canon Law as established by the Prophet, blessed be his name. Arabia is no place for apostates!"

 SAU_funds_for_faith_desc: "Petroleum's military and economic importance has exploded since the turn of the century. Though the port of Abu Dhabi, already bloated with the spoils of trade in black-gold, God's servants shall have their reward. God willing of course."

 SAU_kuffar_weaponry: "Kuffar Weaponry"
 SAU_kuffar_weaponry_desc: "One thing we know: Our old weapons wont do. We need to learn and copy the Christian Empires in their technology for battle, for to not do so would be to endanger the Faith itself!"
 SAU_the_caliphate: "Saudi Caliphate"
 SAU_the_caliphate_desc: "For centuries, the title of Caliph has laid vacant, save for empty claims from small states, such as Sokoto and some Turkish empire. But now, with control over the holiest sites of Islam and the entirety of Arabia, we already *are* the leader of the faithful, tis' only a matter of making this point official."
 SAU_haia: "Establish Morals Police"
 SAU_haia_desc: "We will work to establish a Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice, which will actively seek to root out cultural and mental degeneracy in our lands. Such is a wise way to keep our Ulema content."

 SAU_trading_expertise: "Trading Expertise"

 SAU_armament_plans: "Armament Plans"
 SAU_armament_plans_desc: "We have many warriors which are capable and brave, but far fewer guns that are actually usable on a modern battlefield. If we are to take victory and ensure our freedom, we must ensure we have the best available to us."
 SAU_arsenal_of_arabia: "Arsenal of Arabia"
 SAU_arsenal_of_arabia_desc: "More than just having the minimum of guns, we need to have a surplus; ammo, ships, tyres, bandages, food, livestock; Arabia's arsenal has many needs which must be fulfilled lest we will fall to our enemies."

 SAU_food_imports: "Intensify Food Imports"
 SAU_food_imports_desc: "It's no simple task to feed a nation in times of war, especially considering our enemies are likely to have naval superiority. We are planning to make stocks and secure supply channels to make sure that they cannot hope to starve us into submission, and to diminish all kinds of famine in times of peace."
 SAU_national_logistics: "Improve National Logistics"
 SAU_national_logistics_desc: "Building a railway is more than placing the tracks, for much planning is involved before even the first bit is in place. While we are not ready to build a railway yet, the infrastructure of the country can be improved to let it happen in the near future."
 SAU_industrial_raw_materials: "Industrial Raw Materials"
 SAU_industrial_raw_materials_desc: "Our lands hold little in a way of metals usable for industry, and thus we have to search far and wide for viable deposits of minerals our industries are about to be starved for, beginning in the mountainous regions of our land."
 SAU_literacy_campaign: "Literacy Campaign"

 SAU_education_reform: "Education Reform"

 SAU_dig_deeper: "Dig for more Oil!"
 SAU_dig_deeper_desc: "Wealth flows throughout this land. And if our people have one failing, it is the love of wealth. It is sweeter than water, it is more powerful than the sword, for any sword can be turned aside with a blank check. Oil will buy us a thousand guns, and why, a thousand guns, they are the start of an Empire!"
 SAU_safety_net: "Combat Poverty"
 SAU_safety_net_desc: "More than our moral duty as Muslims, to aid the poor is the surest way to create prosperity and a healthy realm. Little can we do to make the people love us, if they can barely scrape by bread and crumbs! We must ensure that not only the most poor, but also widows of the men who gave their lives for Arabia, have some kind of safety net to fall on, sponsored by our wise state."
 SAU_industrialization_effort: "Integrate the Hejazi Economy"
 SAU_industrialization_effort_desc: "By some called the centre of Islam, the Holy City of Mecca is the pearl in the crown of any would-be Arabian warlord. Not only does it entail a degree of prestige otherwise impossible to acquire, it is also the end-point of the Hajj which even today is already our primary economic drive. Far more developed and with a modern bureaucracy, its incorporation into our realm will however not be a sinecure."
 SAU_arms_industry: "Arms Industry"
 SAU_arms_industry_desc: "Our industry now should focus on the defence of the realm, as we work to divert funds and resources towards defence expenses. We must now allow our armed forces to lack the vital equipment they so desperately need!"

 SAU_arabian_airports: "Airports for Arabia"
 SAU_arabian_airports_desc: "Connecting our cities not only by land, but by air, should be a priority for our new government. The added bonus of allowing greater military traffic certainly is a nice one..."
 SAU_building_better_future: "Building a Better Future"
 SAU_building_better_future_desc: "A better future is more than new buildings, or new books, or new goods; it's changing the way we see the world, and thus changing the world itself. God's light again shines over us, and we will make this earth a better place, even if the cost is high."
 SAU_techslot_machine: "Build Universities"
 SAU_techslot_machine_desc: "The final step our plans for education is naturally the higher learning, and revitalising the science and advancement than once were synonymous with the Arabic language. Naturally, more hawkish advisors see more 'practical' gains from such universities..."

### Intro Screen ###
 SAU_country_intro_header: "The Emirate of Najd"
 SAU_country_intro_content: "The Weltkrieg was one of many signs that we, the House of Saud, are destined to rule this land. In the hour of their greatest hubris, the Hashemites were abandoned by their infidel puppet masters and left for dead to the Turks. While our inactivity in the war proved most fortuitous when it came time to avoid Ottoman retaliation, the decadent Turks held no real sway over us. Now we bide our time, gathering warriors, money, and expertise to strike at the Rashidis, who think they can play both sides by accepting Hashemite warriors and pay lip service to the Porte, and finally unite Arabia under our flag!\n\n§CDecisions to prepare for the war with Jabal Shammar are available."

### Events
 saud.2.t: "Saudi Arabia"
 saud.2.d: "Today with our victory over the house of Rashidis and the conquest of the Hejaz, the Saudis stand dominant. With this victory we shall rule over all Arabs!"
 saud.2.a: "Long live the House of Saud."

### Reactions to the Caliph Event ###

 saud.3.d: "In a solemn and sacred ceremony, the Saudi Sultan of Arabia has declared that he is the new Caliph of Islam. A new and pious dynasty will lead and guide the faithful once more."
 saud.3.a: "Long live the Caliph!"

 saud.31.t.india: "Indian Muslims Celebrate the Renewed Caliphate!"
 saud.31.t.insulindia: "News of the Caliphate Reaches Insulindia"
 saud.31.t.other: "The Sultan of Arabia Declares Himself Caliph"
 saud.31.d.EGY: "The Sultan of Arabia has declared himself the Caliph of Islam. Many liberals in the cafés throughout Egypt were said to burst into laughter at the news, even King Farouk himself was said to find this ridiculous. Even among the conservative Ittihad party, Hassan al-Banna and Sayyid Qutb both came out and denounced it, calling the Sultan of Arabia immoral and not fit to hold the office."
 saud.31.d.PER: "News has reached [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] that the Sultan of Arabia has declared himself the Caliph of Islam. The Caliph of Sunni Islam specifically. The vast majority of people in [PER.GetNameDef] are Shia Muslim and consequently have little interest in what the Arab Sultan decided. We do not care about him."
 saud.31.d.india: "Throughout India, the Muslims have decided to celebrate the new Caliphate that has been declared by the Sultan of Arabia. While most of the elites have not taken part of this celebration, the masses of India have."
 saud.31.d.insulindia: "News of the Sultan of Arabia's decision to declare himself the Caliph of Islam has reached Insulindia. Most of the Muslims in Insulindia have not approved of this decision."
 saud.31.d.OTT: "We have received news from Arabia that the people there have seemed to decide that we are not the Caliph in their eyes. This is an outrageous turn of events that we shall not forget."
 saud.31.d.other: "The Sultan of Arabia has declared himself the Caliph of Islam. This is an obvious ploy at power. We shall reject this claim, for we do not need to recognise this ridiculous pretence."
 saud.31.a.PER: "Who cares what the Arab Sultan claims."
 saud.31.a.india: "Inshallah."
 saud.31.a.OTT: "Reject these ludicrous claims!"

 saud.32.d.insulindia: "We have received news from Insulindia that the people there have seemed to decide that we are not the Caliph in their eyes. This is an outrage that we shall not forget."
 saud.32.d.other: "We have received news from [FROM.GetNameDef] that the people there have seemed to decide that we are not the Caliph in their eyes. This is an outrage that we shall not forget."
 saud.32.a.india: "We shall remember this."
 saud.32.a.other: "We shall not forget this."

### Other Events
 saud.150.t: "The Ikhwan Rebel!"
 saud.150.d: "The Ikhwan has been a strong army presence in Arabia for decades. They were also one of the principle reasons we were able to succeed in defeating the other Arab states and assert Saudi dominance in the region. However, the Ikhwan have always been a traditional group, highly religious, and vehemently against change and reform. They do not seem to understand that modernisation is necessary when ruling a nation. Normally, we can control any anger felt by the Ikhwan with promises that we won't modernise any more. However, it seems we've pushed them too far this time. Ikhwan soldiers have united under the leadership of Faisal Al Duwaish, an Ikhwan commander, who has declared that the Saudis are unfit to rule Arabia. Many Ikhwan militia have risen up, and fighting has already begun..."
 saud.150.a: "We will crush these rebels, for Arabia!"

 saud.151.t: "Emirs Swear Loyalty to the Saudi State"
 saud.151.d: "The tent city of Riyadh saw the procession of sabres upon many soldiers heads under Ibn Saud's orders. In its wake is the procession of captured Emirs. Ibn Saud has decided to spare the families of the Emirs on the condition that they swear total allegiance to the Saudi Arabia. This new form of vassalage is different from the ruthless precedence Ibn Saud's forefathers operated on, and is protected from the Ikhwan in perpetuity. "
 saud.151.a: "Sufficient is Allah as our ally"

 saud.152.t: "An Offer From [FROM.GetNameDef]"
 saud.152.d: "We are involved in a war with [FROM.GetNameDef] due to our alliance with [OMA.GetNameDef]. However, with the capitulation of [OMA.GetNameDef], we have lost our only foothold in the Arabian peninsula. We are now faced with a choice - invade the peninsula by force, or seek peace and cut our losses."
 saud.152.a: "Oman was not of much use, anyway."
 saud.152.b: "We shall not betray our allies!"

 saud.153.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Seeks Peace"
 saud.153.d: "With the collapse of the [OMA.GetAdjective] defences, their allies in [FROM.GetNameDef] were left without a foothold in Arabia - and as such, without any means to threaten us. Unfortunately, we are also unable to threaten or invade them in any way. [FROM.GetNameDefCap] has approached us with an offer - in exchange for peace, they will cut any ties with the [OMA.GetAdjective] state."
 saud.153.a: "We are one step closer to uniting Arabia!"
 saud.153.b: "No peace with the invaders!"

 saud.154.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Declares Continuation of War"
 saud.154.d: "While the collapse of the [OMA.GetAdjective] defences brought hope that their allies in [FROM.GetNameDef] would attempt to cut their losses and seek peace, it appears that Muscat has found itself an ally willing to bleed itself dry."
 saud.154.a: "The war goes on, then."

 saud.155.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Refuses our Offer!"
 saud.155.d: "Despite our generous offer, the Arabs have refused any peace terms with the \"foreign invaders\"."
 saud.155.a: "What?"

This rivalry began when the young Ibn Saud was ejected from his tent in Riyadh by the Rashids. Never a pawn of Emirs, Ibn Saud's father rallied the destitute men of the coastal Emirates to the great goal of his dynasty, Wahhabism. The Rashids were then ejected at the cost of many men, including their only western ally. Ibn Saud himself started many feud the Saudis inherited, as he expressed hatred towards any Arab who turned their nose up towards Bedouins.
