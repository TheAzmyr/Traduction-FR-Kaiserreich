 gru.7.d: "The government of [RHI.GetNameDef] has reached out to us, proposing a free trade area and economic cooperation zone between the three likeminded nations south of the North Sea. This would expand upon our preexisting military obligations to one another as part of our alliance - and bring benefits to all three of our economies, if adopted."

 gru.8.t: "[RHI.GetName] Requests Renegotiation"
 gru.8.d: "The government of [RHI.GetNameDef] has reached out to us, requesting adjustments to the current harsh level of reparations applied to their state. They argue that such payments have stifled the development of the local economy and have left the country helpless in the face of foreign threats. The renegotiation would also allow it to expand their self-defense forces. Finally, they argue that it's unfair for them to pay such high reparations when it was Prussia who were at fault for the Weltkriegs..."
 gru.8.a: "This seems reasonable."
 gru.8.b: "We disagree."
