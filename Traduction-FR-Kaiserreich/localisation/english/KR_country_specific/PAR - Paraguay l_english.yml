 par.80.t: "Chile Protects Argentina"
 par.80.d: "We received disturbing news from the south - Chile has decided to support its ally, [FOP.GetNameDef], against a possible invasion from our side. They have publicly announced their military guarantee of [FOP.GetAdjective] independence. Our spies report that Chilean troops are already heading to [FOP.GetNameDef] to protect them.

Banners emblazoned with the colours of Paraguay fly high as the soldiers march in perfect unison, their faces beaming with pride and satisfaction. The recent military victories against Brazil and the subsequent defeat of the Brazilian army has brought a renewed sense of patriotism and unity to the people of Paraguay, and the parade is a celebration of their hard-fought victory.\n\nOur glorious leader, [ROOT.GetLeader], led us through many hardships, but at last, the sacrifices made have paid off by [GetYear]."

 PAR_women_in_the_workforce: "Women in the Workforce"
 PAR_women_in_the_workforce_desc: "Our country, despite being more than twice the size of Uruguay, has half its people.

While some conservative elements might protest this measure, we don't really have that many options to go with."

 PAR_logistical_expertise: "Logistical Expertise"
 PAR_logistical_expertise_desc: "One of the largest Bolivian shortcomings during the Chaco War was their supply system, as their communication and supply lines were inadequate. We should learn from their mistakes so we don't repeat them."

 PAR_new_army: "The New Army"

 PAR_army_railways: "Army Railways"

 PAR_well_planned_attack_focus: "Well Planned Attacks"

 PAR_static_anti_air_focus: "Static Anti Air"
 PAR_static_anti_air_focus_desc: "Despite our efforts in creating an air force, we simply lack the capabilities to build one. In order to protect our homeland we should invest into static anti air stationings capable of taking down even the biggest of the bombers out there."
 PAR_river_patrols: "River Patrols"
 PAR_river_patrols_desc: "Paraguay has many rivers patrolled by gunboats, each one carrying a huge amount of firepower compared to what a rifle can do. If we can coordinate them to the army, we will be able to make every one of our rivers uncrossable for the enemy."
 PAR_army_of_the_future: "The Army of the Future"
 PAR_army_of_the_future_desc: "Despite our efforts, our army can't be really said to be modern: we lack airplanes, tanks, trucks, and way more equipment to effectively turn into a modern army. While we can't produce that, we can at least research them for the future."
 PAR_bombers_research: "Bombers Research"
 PAR_bombers_research_desc: "Bombers can shatter enemy railways and enemy factories, but they are incredibly expensive to build. We can hope that in the future we will be able to produce them, but for now all we can do is research them."

 PAR_armoured_warfare_focus_desc: "There is a new king of land warfare. It's not the infantryman, it's not the artilleryman, and it's not the horse. That is the tank, a steel monster that can spout fire and cannot be stopped. If we wish that our soldiers will be able to face enemies in the future, investing in tanks is the right move."

 PAR_cooperation_with_URG: "Cooperation with Uruguay"
 PAR_cooperation_with_URG_desc: "After winning against Argentina, now we face yet another problem in the socialists from Patagonia now sitting in Buenos Aires. Cooperating with Uruguay, despite not being a choice everyone agrees with, is better than facing the reds down south alone."
 PAR_study_uruguays_forts: "Study Uruguay's Fortifications"
 PAR_study_uruguays_forts_desc: "Uruguay started a fortification programme when Manuel Carles couped the Argentine government during Christmas of 1935. It could prove to be valuable experience if we could apply it and fortify our own border with Argentina in case they were to attack us. After all, many battles in history demonstrated the effectiveness of force multipliers, so we better start working on those as soon as possible, and be ready for a possible invasion."
 PAR_help_uruguays_military: "Help Uruguay's Military"
 PAR_help_uruguays_military_desc: "Cooperation usually benefits both sides, and this one is no exception: after all, Uruguay has been at peace since the War of the Triple Alliance, and their military is nowhere near ready to face anything that comes from the left side of the Rio Uruguay. Plus, this will boost the relationship between our countries and militaries."
 PAR_joint_military_exercises: "Joint Military Exercises"
 PAR_joint_military_exercises_desc: "Since we might end up fighting a war side to side, joint military exercises will be useful if we were to execute coordinated manoeuvres together in an actual war. We don't want to end up in a fiasco like the Battle of Karánsebes, in which we would fight each other instead of our enemy and lose valuable lives and equipment. Plus, every generation to come would laugh at such an embarrassment, so there's yet another reason about why those exercises are important."
 PAR_irrazabals_plan: "Irrazabal's Plan"
 PAR_irrazabals_plan_desc: "General Luis Irrazabal, war hero and veteran of the Chaco War, came up with a plan we may use to push back the invaders: since their military is not accustomed in fighting in the Chaco, we might use our experience in that regard to punish any attempt at confronting us heavily. However, they will sooner or later figure out a way to counter our plan, so we better make good use of our advantage as best as we possibly can."

We shall reach out to the common Paraguayan and offer them the solutions the Liberals didn't give them."
 PAR_true_values: "True Values"
 PAR_true_values_desc: "The Colorados has always been a conservative party. During the liberal governments, the Paraguayan populace was forced through several progressive reforms which many didn't agree with.

 PAR_prosperity_and_progress: "Prosperity and Progress"

 PAR_policy_on_the_army: "Policy On The Army"
 PAR_policy_on_the_army_desc: "Something both Colorados and the Liberals can agree on is supporting the army, the only thing that maintains our nation free and strong. New policies regarding the military spending should help with that and improve the morale of the soldiers."
 PAR_increase_soldiers_stipends: "Increase The Soldiers Stipends"
 PAR_increase_soldiers_stipends_desc: "The salaries in the army are meagre, to say the least, and a soldier's stipend is not the best, far from it. By increasing them, we hope we can at least make the conditions in the army more bearable for our soldiers, and especially for the conscripts."
 PAR_increase_military_industry_funds: "Increase Military Industry Funds"

 PAR_faith_and_state: "Faith and State"
 PAR_faith_and_state_desc: "Our country has many strong social virtues, but one of the most cherished is faith. While we're by no means a monarchy ruled from Rome by the pope, we cannot deny the Catholic influence within our country, and we'd do well in taking advantage of our country's faith by allowing the Catholic church to play a larger role in our government as long as it doesn't hinder our power."

### Bookmark ###
 PAR_KR_gathering_storm_desc: "Despite emerging victorious from the Chaco war, Paraguay doesn't find itself in an enviable situation: extremely high military expenses, a very undeveloped economy and the country not having recovered yet from the 1870 war which killed more than half of its population means that Paraguay's economy is basically non-existent; also, an unstable situation on the southern border and Bolivia seeking revenge for the humiliating defeat 3 years ago mean that the Guarani republic might soon find itself fighting for its own existence once again."

### Intro Screen ###
 PAR_country_intro_header: "The Republic of Paraguay"
 PAR_country_intro_content: "After the devastating War of the Triple Alliance, Paraguay was shattered and broken almost beyond recognition; the vast majority of its male population dead or orphaned. The extreme demographic and economic damage was not all, however, as both Brazil and Argentina took slices of land off the Guarani Republic and effectively only kept its sovereignty as a buffer state between the two nations. Rebuilding and recovering from that disaster was no easy feat, and political instability still corroded the nation. In 1904, a Liberal revolution against the rule of Colorados broke out. The Liberal rule started a period of great political instability, which culminated in a Civil War in 1922 between rival political factions.\n\nThen, in late 1929, war again came to Paraguay by the hand of Bolivia. That nation, under economic pressure to secure the rumoured oil wells of the Chaco region, aggressively started to assert its claims in the disputed area. The Chaco War took four gruesome years, and by 1933 Paraguay had completely routed the Bolivian forces and was starting to occupy their lands. The total victory did not come without a cost, however, as mounting debt and military expenses continue to be a burden on the government. The Bolivian military was poorly equipped and poorly trained to fight in the region, and its low morale meant the Paraguayan casualties were far smaller.\n\nThe political situation did not improve, however, and the Liberal rule was faltering. Rafael Franco and other radical leaders launched a coup in 1934 based on left-authoritarian principles but were deposed after a short three-month rule by Chaco War hero José Félix Estigarribia. Now, the age of liberal chaos is over, and José Felix's rule is one of great peace; his actions against the \"Syndicalist\" Franco and Bolivian invaders greatly influenced politics, as he is now almost unanimously acclaimed as a national saviour and hero. With the rise of the Argentinian Patriotic League, Estigarribia and his cabinet are again on high alert, as Manuel Carlés did little to hide his expansionist goals in his speech upon ascending to leadership. War may soon be upon Paraguay once again."

Please note - regardless of the selected option, the playthrough requires planning, careful execution and micromanagement of your army - you will face stronger enemies with very limited resources. Good luck, the heroes of the Chaco War are watching you!"
 par.101.a: "Easy difficulty"

 PAR_hard_difficulty_tt: "§RHard difficulty introduces even stronger enemies. Proceed with caution.§!"

 par.2.t: "Anti LPA Rally"
 par.2.d: "Argentina's new President, Manuel Carlés, is relentless in his smear campaign against Paraguay and other countries he deems enemies of the Argentinian state. Today in Asunción, hundreds of people gathered to protest his insults and his rhetoric, demanding an official diplomatic break between our nations. While this is unlikely to happen, such a danger is politically good for the army, as the threat of war is a reminder of who saved Paraguay a few short years ago."
 par.2.a: "Argentina can't regain its greatness; it never had any!"

 par.3.t: "Black Monday Ravages Our Economy"
 par.3.d: "Paraguay, despite being a landlocked nation, is connected to the wider global economy via the port in Asunción and the Rio de la Plata basin. The stock market crash news first arrived to us as a curiosity, but the effects were soon felt. Foreigners can't buy our products, and we are having immense difficulties in importing vital goods for our nation. Worse still, the budgetary situation has entirely collapsed, and retired military personnel are already up in arms, ready to defend their rights should we encroach on them in any way. Truly, bad times are ahead, and Paraguay may very well have to live in commercial isolation..."
 par.3.a: "We have to prepare for difficult times."

 par.4.t: "Military Payment Issues"
 par.4.d: "Our budgetary issues predictably resulted in the reduction of the pay of several military officers, especially among lower ranks. This situation affects morale, leading to desertion, resignations and small protests in the army. Whatever we do, and even after we asked for their understanding considering the situation, the dissatisfaction continues to get worse."
 par.4.a: "Please understand us!"

 par.5.t: "Pensioners Protest!"
 par.5.d: "Veterans and other pensioners have protested in very large numbers after the announcement of delays to their payments. Usually, such protests would have been quickly over, but now the payment delays also extend to low ranking officers and soldiers who are normally in charge of dealing with such rabble and now refuse to intervene. With both local soldiers and veterans united in protest, there isn't much left to do about it than to wait it out."
 par.5.a: "Wait and the situation will improve."

 par.6.t: "Military Discontent"
 par.6.d: "The payment issues have not affected every single Paraguayan soldier, but discontent spreads like the plague in the barracks as no improvement of the situation is visible to the common soldier. A few quartelazos and other minor revolts have been suppressed, but we are unsure for how long we can sustain the situation."
 par.6.a: "Unfortunate."

 par.7.t: "Rafael Franco in Exile"
 par.7.d: "Ever since he was ousted from the government due to his radical syndicalist ideas, Rafael Franco further delved into Left-Wing rhetoric in exile in Chile. Now styling himself a 'Solanist Totalist', he clamours for Revolution in Paraguay from his exile. For years, few paid any heed to him, just one of the many deposed despots in this world, but now, with our position threatened, he directly calls for a coup that would allow his return. And the worst part is that he actually finds some who are willing to listen..."
 par.7.a: "Ramblings of a madman."

 par.8.t: "Disturbances in the Chaco"
 par.8.d: "Bolivia's foul plots are endless. As they again began a war of aggression to claim the Chaco from us and give it to their corporate masters, we are facing infiltrators and sabotage in the areas liberated in the previous war. Their disruptions, while small, are symbolic of how far Bolivian treachery can go."
 par.8.a: "They will see things our way in time."

 par.9.t: "Huey Long is Elected President of the United States"
 par.9.d: "Former US Senator Huey Long has been successful in his bid to be elected President of the United States of America in an incredibly contentious election. Running against Syndicalist and sell-out candidates alike, Long has managed to triumph in key states of that nation and prove that the people of the Americas had enough of the elites who seek to put us down and sell our wealth rather than share it! Many Paraguayan papers had begun to shower the man with praise before the ballots were even finished being counted. Time will tell if his foul foes will accept the loss gracefully."
 par.9.a: "Congratulations Amigo!"

 par.10.t: "Aid the American Union State?"
 par.10.d: "The United States are under Siege! Huey Long has been challenged by Syndicalist and Banker thieves and they seek to enslave the people of North America by force. Long is an extremely popular person in Paraguay, as he was the only foreign politician to see the truth and denounce the war of greed Bolivia led against us in the Chaco, propelling him to celebrity status. The popular outcry was thus strong when news reached Paraguay, with many vocal unemployed veterans of the Chaco War demanding an official intervention. Tired of waiting, now all they request is material aid and ships to send them to the US to fight for Peace and Justice in the name of our nation."
 par.10.a: "We must help our American friends to free their nation!"
 par.10.b: "We can help, but we should be careful not to spend too much."
 par.10.c: "We can't afford it, sadly."

 par.11.t: "The Chaco Brigade Arrives!"
 par.11.d: "From the small nation of Paraguay comes the brave Chaco Brigade. Named after a disputed area, which caused a war fuelled by greed and denounced by the Kingfish publicly here in the States, the folks in Paraguay regard him as the only foreigner to see the truth behind that war and to tell things the way they are. Long's popularity only kept rising in the past few years, and news of the coup against democracy have outraged the Paraguayan populace, and many thousands have decided to lend a hand to us in this final struggle for the very soul of America."
 par.11.a: "Our cause is just!"

 par.12.t: "Paraguayan Congratulations!"
 par.12.d: "With the end of the conflict, it seems as though we finally have some time to breathe. Letters from Paraguayan citizens, personally thanking the Kingfish for his fight for freedom and against Syndicalism, keep flocking from the small South American nation that regards Long as a true hero."
 par.12.a: "Peace is its own reward, but we thank them nonetheless."

 par.13.t: "Military Revolt!"
 par.13.d: "The recent cut of the military budget was the last straw. Temporary cuts in wages and delays in payments could be accepted, blamed on the situation. But attacking the military of the Paraguayan state, the sole hero of the Chaco War, could not have been done without consequences.\n\nHearing, the news of this plan, the rumours spread among the soldiers, in the barracks across the country, : \"Estigarribia has to go, he betrayed the nation!\". Several patriotic generals and officers took advantage of the situation and presented themselves as the alternative, touring barracks to expose their views and prepare an uprising.\n\nBack in Chile, Rafael Franco wasn't oblivious to the situation at home. Informed by frequent letters of his supporters, he orchestrated from Santiago a violent takeover, repeating his short-lived coup of 1934. In much the same way, his supporters in the army came and went into the barracks, preparing the minds with propaganda and securing the coup regiment by regiment. In this bubbling atmosphere, loyalties weren't gained only by morals, but also with bread. The seditious generals and Franco didn't hesitate to use their personal funds to win over useful regiments.\n\nFinally, several barracks rose up today across the country against our failed economic policies, and it seemed that democracy stood on its knees. The soldiers loyal to the Patriots or to Franco moved against places of power, and the takeover attempt degenerated into open fighting in the streets of Asunción. Some units still loyal to Estigarribia and the Colorado party have, however, sworn their loyalty to the regime, and fought to defend the democratic state. The fights took until dusk in the capital and claimed many lives, but finally the fighting stopped and when the dust settled on the presidential palace, there was a clear winner:"
 par.13.a: "Morinigo and the Patriotic Officers have saved the Nation!"
 par.13.b: "Franco's units have won, and the General was able to return!"
 par.13.c: "Units loyal to the Liberals and the Colorado were able to restore order!"

 par.14.t: "Huey Long Heading to Paraguay"
 par.14.d: "The War in North America took a turn for the worse, and Huey Long was forced to flee with the traitorous forces closing in on him. Nothing would please them more than his death, thus his request for asylum here in Paraguay was accepted immediately. The American hero is scheduled to reach Asunción shortly. A scheme involving ships with Paraguayan flags will ensure he evades capture by traitors, and once he gets here, he will receive a proper hero's welcome!"
 par.14.a: "We are waiting for him!"

 par.15.t: "1941 Elections"
 par.15.d: "It's election day in Paraguay, and the outcome of these elections is far from being clear, since in the previous ones no one got an absolute majority. The two main contenders are, as always, the Colorados led by Juan Manuel Frutos and the Liberals led by no others than José Félix Estigarribia. The results from the ballots are in, and the winner is..."
 par.15.a: "The Estigarribiato comes out on top."
 par.15.b: "Frutos and the Colorados secure a majority."

 par.16.t: "1946 Elections"
 par.16.d: "While the success in the previous elections for the Estigarribiato was a welcome surprise, now it is yet again time for elections. As per usual, the Colorados are the only other party besides the liberals that could achieve a majority, and with the ballots closed, the results are in."
 par.16.a: "Unsurprisingly, Estigarribia wins again."
 par.16.b: "Juan Manuel Frutos and the Colorados win."

 par.17.t: "1951 Elections"
 par.17.d: "The liberals were able to secure a majority with ease five years ago, but yet again, the Colorados run for the elections and could achieve a majority in the parliament. The results are in, and the party with a majority in the parliament is..."
 par.17.a: "The Liberals again!"
 par.17.b: "The Colorados are able to secure a win!"

 par.18.t: "1956 Elections"
 par.18.d: "Unsurprisingly the only two parties that can hope to achieve a victory in this election are yet again the liberals and the Colorados, with both conducting a very fierce electoral campaign, luckily without violence. Now the election is over, and the results are in."
 par.18.a: "The Liberals stay in power."
 par.18.b: "A surprising Colorado victory!"

 par.19.t: "1946 Elections"
 par.19.d: "Despite the success in the previous election, the Colorado rule is anything but secure as the campaign rhetoric ramps up to new hostile levels. While violence was avoided, many worry the elections results may not be recognised, but the Army has already declared it will ensure the elections will be orderly. As the dust settles, the Paraguay's president is..."
 par.19.a: "Juan Manuel Frutos, a Colorado."
 par.19.b: "Eusebio Ayala, and old school Liberal."

 par.21.t: "1951 Elections"
 par.21.d: "They say politics makes for strange bedfellows. As the Liberal's struggled to settle on a candidate, Luis Alberto Riart, once deposed from office, tries to run again for that party, running against consistently fierce Colorado opposition. As the ballot counting ends, the winner emerges as being..."
 par.21.a: "Raimundo Rolón, a Colorado."
 par.21.b: "Luis Alberto Riart, the Old Liberal."

 par.22.t: "1956 Elections"
 par.22.d: "Two military men meet in the unique battlefield of Paraguayan bipartisan elections. Raimundo Rolón has the backing of the Colorado party behind him, but his opponent has weight all by himself: José Felix Estigarribia wants to become president yet again, this time under a democratic framework. The winner of this battle of battlers is..."
 par.22.a: "Raimundo Rolón for the Colorados."
 par.22.b: "José Felix Estigarribia, the Old Marshall."

 par.20.t: "Paraguay in the Internationale?"
 par.20.d: "The tiny South American nation has recently experienced a socialist revolution and after initial stabilisation now looks at its role on the global front. While their contributions to the Internationale will be mostly negligible, an ally is an ally and we are in no position to deny further members to our alliance."
 par.20.a: "Welcome!"
 par.20.b: "Wasn't it called Uruguay? Doesn't matter, we don't need them."

 par.201.t: "France Denies Us Membership to the Internationale"
 par.201.d: "Calling our nation an irrelevant backwater with no value whatsoever to their alliance, France has denied us membership and sent our ambassadors packing."
 par.201.a: "They will regret this!"

 par.24.t: "The Status of Our Army after the Chaco War"
 par.24.d: "Our victory in the Chaco war came with a heavy price, we took on many casualties and left our country bleeding. Our troops were constantly underequipped and undersupplied, we were able to win only because of the fierce determination of our troops and because our generals excelled in leading them. However, many casualties could have been avoided. We need to reform if we want to avoid continuing in this path and suffering such catastrophe as the terrible war of the Triple Alliance again."
 par.24.a: "Reform is needed!"

 par.25.t: "The Hardship of Building a Modern Army"
 par.25.d: "Tanks and bombers. Incredible machinery capable of turning the sides of a war, but they come with a price. A price we can't pay. Our small nation can't afford to produce them since these equipments are incredibly difficult and expensive to make. Our few industrial units can't keep up with the cost and expertise needed to produce them. Obviously, this might change one day, but for now we should focus on our expert infantry army. This doesn't prevent us from investing in obtaining these technologies however, as it might be useful one day."
 par.25.a: "Let's hope we will see Paraguayan tanks!"

 par.26.t: "Snap Elections"
 par.26.d: "Adding to the economic crisis, a political crisis developed. The position of the Liberal Party which supports Estigarribia's regime was weakened, and the situation becomes more and more difficult to manage against the opposition. The conservative Colorado Party has been pushing for a while to hold an election to oust Estigarribia out of office. Today, the President announced that their wish has finally been granted, a snap election will indeed be organised. With the instability, Paraguayan citizens will be asked to choose between the security of Estigarribia's liberals and the fresh impetus from the conservative Colorados. Nothing is assured, and the ballots decree that the winner is..."
 par.26.a: "Estigarribia is able to hold but has to form a coalition with the moderate Liberals."
 par.26.b: "The Colorados are able to come out on top by a slim majority."

 par.27.t: "Mining Industries in the Chaco"
 par.27.d: "The Chaco War has been fought over the presence of oil in the region. While not present in the Chaco Boreal, this region has other resources to offer such as iron, bauxite and copper, very useful for our small domestic industry. Indeed we don't have the capacity to import a huge amount of resources, unlike other nations such as America, Germany or Russia, which have a huge mineral industry and a budget that allows them to trade and import resources without blinking an eye. Winning the Chaco war and acquiring oil helped us move towards that direction, but the deposits at our disposal are still very limited. Still, it's better than nothing, and we expect to be able to increase the amount of resources extracted year after year."
 par.27.a: "We shall work on expanding this booming industry then!"

 par.28.t: "Oil in the Chaco"
 par.28.d: "The Chaco war has been fought over the presence of oil in the region. While initial prospects made us expect to find oil in all of it, we were able to find it only in a small border region with Bolivia, very close to the border, but still in our hands. By controlling the most important resource in the world, albeit in a small number, we expect to be able to gain the upper hand in many negotiations, since almost all of our neighbours don't have oil fields nor have the capacity to import it. While we lack the numbers that Americans or Azeri oil fields can produce, this is still a relatively large amount, enough to be able to supply our small army, and with those refineries we expect to be able to produce even more oil both to export and to use for domestic use. This new industry should give a huge boost to our economy."
 par.28.a: "Since oil makes the world move, we might as well get involved in the business."

 par.29.t: "In the Hell of the Chaco"
 par.29.d: "This movie was shot in 1932 by Argentinian director Roque Funes. It describes the horrors of the Chaco war and how the proud Paraguayan army overcame difficulties until its victory. The movie was thought lost for years, but it has recently been discovered by the Estragó family. It has premiered in Asunción recently, was positively welcomed by the critics for its narrative and was praised by the army as very accurate and representative of the spirit of the Paraguayan army. This is a historical moment for the cinematographic scene of our nation, and we hope that this will inspire Paraguayan movie makers to be more enterprising."
 par.29.a: "Very nice movie, 7.8/10, not enough water."

 par.30.t: "Agustín Barrios Tours America"
 par.30.d: "Agustín Pío Barrios is a famous Paraguayan guitarist who was able to achieve one of his dreams, that being touring America, with the first performance being held in San Juan, on the island of Puerto Rico. During said tour he was even able to play the famous song "Every man a king" with senator Huey Long himself when he toured the beautiful state of Louisiana, in Baton Rouge. Like most Paraguayans, Barrios admires Long for his stand against Bolivian aggression in the Chaco War. In this occasion the Paraguayan ambassador, who was escorting mister Barrios during his tour, expressed his best wishes to governor Long in regards for his presidential campaign, hoping that he will come out on top as the 31st president of the United States of America."
 par.30.a: "He was able to play Every man a king on a guitar? Mister Barrios is truly amazing!"

 par.31.t: "Snatching the Chaco"
 par.31.d: "Now that Paraguay is busy fighting a war with Argentina, it's our moment to strike and seize the Chaco. While we can't realistically hope to take all of it since our army is still recovering from the defeat of the Chaco war, we can occupy the border region known as the Upper Chaco. Considering that the Paraguayan army is busy fighting the Argentinians, we are sure they won't wage war against us if we occupy it."
 par.31.a: "Occupy the region."
 par.31.b: "No, I don't think I will."

 par.32.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Demands Chaco!"
 par.32.d: "We received an ultimatum from [From.GetNameDef] - either we cede the entire Chaco region or they will declare war on us! It is a difficult decision; either we fight a two-front war or give away territories that were paid in blood by our nation several years ago. It may be wise to let it slide, since we can always come back later and focus on them once we have destroyed Argentina, but this move will be deeply unpopular. On the other hand, our national pride tells us to not surrender. We won against Bolivia once, we will do it again!"
 par.32.a: "We have to cede the Chaco."
 par.32.b: "We won't give up our territory! Come and get it!"

 par.322.t: "Calls for Peace"
 par.322.d: "Most in the military and government had hoped for a repeat of the first Chaco war, but it seems we had underestimated our ability to wage a two front war. It has been over six months of continuos occupation of the Chaco and with no signs of that changing, combine with the soaring prices, the public opinion of the war has had a dramatical shift. Some still have a faint hope that Bolivia will break and offer peace before us, but maybe is time swallow our pride and recognise our inability to win."
 par.322.a: "Send the deal, there is nothing more we can do."
 par.322.b: "Never surrender! We have won once, we will win again!"

 par.323.t: "Paraguay Offers a Peace Deal"
 par.323.d: "Shocking news awaited us today, as we received a message from Paraguay. They offered us all of the Chaco region in exchange for ending the war. While we have firm military control of the region, all attempts to reach their capital have been futile. It would be wise from us to accept this and at least came out of this war with the important Chaco region."
 par.323.a: "Accept the peace, with the Chaco in our hands, they don't have anything useful left for us."
 par.323.b: "Reject it, we will only be satisfied with [ROOT.GetAdjective] flags flying in Asunción!"

 par.324.t: "Our Peace is Accepted"
 par.324.d: "Our peace agreement has been accepted by [FROM.GetName]."
 par.324.a: "Let's get over this as fast as possible."

 par.325.t: "The Peace has been Signed"
 par.325.d: "The peace treaty has been ratified and the Chaco given to us."
 par.325.a: "Our national pride has been restored."

 par.33.t: "Socialist Coup in Paraguay!"
 par.33.d: "Worrying news from Asunción! We have received a report that Rafael Franco returned from his exile and has now couped the Paraguayan government. They have declared they have no interest in continuing being part of an anti-syndicalist defensive pact and the previous treaty is now null. From now on, we will have to rely on one less ally."
 par.33.a: "You are joking - not another one! Oh, for God's sake, I can't, this is the second time a socialist coup happens in Paraguay in less than a decade."

 par.34.t: "Victory Against Argentina!"
 par.34.d: "There is no man more heroic than he who stands against giants, and there is no nation more heroic than the small one which defies those that seek to dominate them - and the proud Paraguayan nation has been at the mercy of her powerful neighbours for her whole life. In 1864, she chose to fight to preserve the territory that rightfully belonged to her and assert her right as a sovereign state, a decision that we nearly paid for with our lives. The insistence of Francisco Solano López on fighting to the death has left his legacy fiercely disputed, and our nation deeply traumatised - the sheer death toll the War of the Triple Alliance took was beyond all comprehension.\n\nBut in 1932, Paraguay stood up - once more, we defied the infernal designs of our enemies, wading into a war against Bolivia that the world thought we could never win. In the Chaco War, we shocked the world by routing the Bolivians all the way back to La Paz despite being outnumbered, defending our right to our country and proving that we are a power to be respected. After 60 years, the sorrow of our near-destruction had given way to triumph and renewed pride.\n\nAt long last, our victory is now complete - once again, we have stood against Argentina, and today we have come out the better. The bravery and cunning of our soldiers have cast our enemies from Chaco and Misiones, and have finally returned these long-lost lands to our nation. In the streets of Asunción and across the countryside, the people shout 'Victory!' and celebrate the avenging of 1870 - no more will we be at the mercy of other nations, no more shall we be cast adrift in the world. Come what may, Paraguay shall fight, against all who would harm her - the Guaranì spirit shall never be destroyed! They will speak the names of the heroes of Paraguay on all corners of the world!"
 par.34.a: "Hurrah!"

 par.35.t: "Military Help From Paraguay?"
 par.35.d: "A military mission has been sent by Paraguay to help us prepare against the FOP. As Paraguay has participated in more wars than we have, having just emerged victorious against Argentina in fact, and are thus much more experienced. Our forces are wholly unprepared for a fight against the FOP, or any other conflict for that matter. Paraguay's mission can turn that around, but how should we respond?"
 par.35.a: "Their help will be vital."
 par.35.b: "Thanks, but we are doing fine by ourselves."

 par.36.t: "Uruguay Accepts Our Mission"
 par.36.d: "Uruguay has responded positively to our proposed military mission and accepted its help. Having not been at war for decades, our tested battlefield experience will help them adequately prepare for any future conflicts. This new cooperation will also help smooth over regional tensions between our two countries and boost mutual relations. The success of the mission may even convince those in our government who are unhappy that we have extended a hand to Uruguay that it is the necessary thing to do."
 par.36.a: "Great!"

 par.37.t: "Uruguay Refused Our Mission"
 par.37.d: "Uruguay has refused our offer of a military mission and it has since returned to Asunción. Their military desperately needed the help, but it seems the tension between our two countries was too much for them to overcome. Unfortunately, we can't do anything about it."
 par.37.a: "But, but, their military is rubbish!"

 par.38.t: "Paraguay Sends Advisors to Study Our Forts"
 par.38.d: "On the heels of our acceptance of their military mission, Paraguay has sent more advisors, this time to study our fortifications. We have been building up our defences along our border with Argentina since its Christmas Coup in 1935, and now Paraguay is planning to do the same. Our engineers will teach them the keys to entrenchment, and how force multipliers can turn the tide of a battle."
 par.38.a: "We expect to learn from their military as well."

 par.39.t: "Joint Exercises"
 par.39.d: "In yet another expample of increased cooperation between our two countries, Paraguay has proposed joint military exercises. In preparation, they have sent two infantry battalions so we can coordinate planning and manoeuvres to better defend against the FOP."
 par.39.a: "Si vis pacem, para bellum."
