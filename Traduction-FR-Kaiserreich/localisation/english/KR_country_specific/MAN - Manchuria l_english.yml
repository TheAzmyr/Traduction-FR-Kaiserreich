 MAN_guan_xiangying: "Guan Xiangying"
 MAN_guan_xiangying_leader_desc: "§YBorn:§! §LSeptember 10th, 1902, in Daguanjia Village, Jinzhou, Shengjing District, Qing Empire§!\n§YBackground:§! §LBorn to a Manchu family of the Guerjia clan, Guan Xiangying, from an early age, saw the horrors of imperialism firsthand as he toiled away in a Japanese-funded printing company. He saw Manchuria gradually fall under the influence of the Japanese and witnessed firsthand the rampant corruption of the Fengtian Clique, which holds dominion over the vast plains of Manchuria. At the age of 22, he joined a Socialist youth league, and when the Northern Expedition down south broke out in 1925, he joined the Chinese Syndicalist Party - joining many others in a fervour of anti-imperialist nationalism.\n\nUnfortunately, with the collapse of the Northern Expedition and the disintegration of the Kuomintang, the Chinese Syndicalist Party found itself even more disorganised. In those trying times, Guan was forced, like many others, to go into hiding and bid his time for the revolution. And yet the revolution has indeed come. With foreign socialist troops having freed Manchuria from the Japanese and Fengtian Clique, Guan has emerged out of hiding and guerrilla war to participate as the leader of a new revolutionary Manchuria - one that will champion and value the true labour of all the peoples in Manchuria!\n\nOr so he claims. In practice, the newly founded Socialist Party of Manchuria (modelled heavily after the Chinese Kuomintang) remains largely unpopular with the entrenched establishment they oppose and with the apathetic peasantry. Many resistance fighters feel betrayed by the foundation of an independent Manchurian state, and Chinese nationalism endures. Chairman Guan himself is said to be privately unhappy with recent developments, but has accepted this arrangement as a necessary evil to ensure the withdrawal of foreign occupiers.§!"

In April of 1924, under the introduction of Li Zhenying, he joined the Chinese Socialist Youth League and then went to Shanghai with Li to engage in secret activities with the Kuomintang. In December of 1924, he would go to study in France and returned to China following the May 30th Movement.\n\nAfter the fall of the Northern Expedition, Guan Xiangying operated in Shanghai and Tianjin as a secret labour organiser and worked with Chinese syndicalist cells of the LCS in the north of the country.§!\n\n§YNotes: A long-time guerilla commander, he has had some difficulty adjusting to formal field command, however he has proven to be a quick learner.§!"

 #趙欣伯
 MAN_zhao_xinbo: "Zhao Xinbo"
 MAN_zhao_xinbo_leader_desc: "§YBorn:§! §L1890, in Wanping County, Zhili Province, Qing Empire§!\n§YBackground:§! §LA Manchu bannerman with the Imperial Guard during the waning days of the Qing Empire, a young Zhao Xinbo enrolled in the Tianjin Beiyang University. Amid the growing turbulence of Xinhai, he joined the Beijing Wenming New Theatre Troupe as a female actor and also the revolutionary Tongmenghui.\n\nAfter the failure of Sun's second revolution 1913, the light of Chinese republicanism dimmed and Zhao fled to Dalian. He became a Chinese teacher for Japanese students before successfully enrolling in law classes at Meiji University. There he became the first Chinese student to receive a doctorate in law from the Tokyo Imperial University in 1925. Heavily connected to Japanese influence, he was a legal advisor to Zhang Zuolin after graduation. Under Zhang Xueliang's patronage, he founded the Northeast Law Research Association.\n\nAn otherwise minor, pro-Japanese figure in the Fengtian clique, he was nevertheless willing to make the jump when foreign authorities decided to create a new Manchurian state. Zhao proved to be an eager collaborator, helping establish the Liaoning Province Local Maintenance Committee, which issued a declaration of independence for Manchuria on behalf of his masters. He successively became mayor of Shenyang, President of the Supreme Court, and President of the Legislative Yuan, influencing the creation of nearly all of Manchuria's nascent institutions during foreign occupation.\n\nWith his power growing, the so-called \"Midwife of Manchuria\" was finally granted his wish: an independent Manchurian republic. Easily elected into the role of President with the backing of a hastily cobbled together \"Manchuria Democratic League\", the future of his republic remains extremely shaky. Worse, he has been known to shamelessly embezzle money from the treasury. Beneath a thin veneer of democracy, designed mainly to cater to his foreign patrons, lies a largely unpopular strong-man oligarchy - a sham he may not have the competency to maintain.§!"

 #富雙英
 MAN_fu_shuangying: "Fu Shuangying"
 MAN_fu_shuangying_bio: "An ethnic Manchu from Manchuria, Fu Shuangying attended Fengtian Army School before graduating from Baoding Military Academy in 1918. He soon found himself a member of the Fengtian army, serving as an instructor where he once attended primary school. An infantry commander by training, he served in such a regiment in the 2nd Zhifeng War.\n\nAt one point his achievements caught the eye of his commander Zhang Xueliang. Not particularly successful during the Fourth Zhili-Fengtian war, he was rotated to various back-end positions working in logistics. To this end he served as director of the Jingxing Mining Bureau and also as a staff officer in the Fengtian government."
 MAN_fu_shuangying_notes: "§YNotes: Although he has some pro-Japanese connections, Fu is not a member of the Shikan clique or Concordia association.§!"

 MAN_fu_shuangying_leader_desc: "§YBorn:§! §L1894, in Liaoyang City, Shengjing District, Qing Empire§!\n§YBackground:§! §LA minor commander of Manchu descent in the Fengtian clique, Fu Shuangying was nothing special in the old order: a graduate from the prestigious Baoding military academy with a checkered record on the battlefield and some ties with Japanese interests in Manchuria. His lack of entrenched ties with the Zhangs or Tokyo, military education and bureaucratic experience gained administering (among other projects) the Jingxing Mining Bureau ultimately worked in his favour however when foreign authorities began searching for a candidate to lead an independent Manchuria.\n\nLargely a figurehead for foreign rule and with a questionable legitimacy even among ethnic Manchus, Fu has nonetheless taken on the role with stride. Installed as Chief Executive of Manchuria, he has concentrated his rule through the General Affairs State Council with the help of the remnants of the so-called Shikan clique, working together to protect the region's autonomy.\n\nThis rebuilt Shikan clique inherits a devastated Manchuria, with many of the previous decades investments having been either withdrawn with the Japanese retreat, looted by foreign occupiers, or destroyed in the fighting. Although expected to make some inroads with the old landed and bureaucratic establishment, the decision to create a fully independent Manchurian republic has stung many with lingering Chinese nationalistic sentiments, even among some within the fiercely regionalist Shikan clique. The countryside remains embroiled in insurgency as reconstruction work begins.§!"

#Note Yang Yuting is in the Fengtian folder
 MAN_yang_yuting_leader_desc: "§YBorn:§! §LAugust 29th, 1885, in Faku, Shengjing District, Qing Empire§!\n§YBackground:§! §LYang Yuting served as the Fengtian's Clique Chief of Staff during its early days, and participated in early raids against Zhili with Xu Shuzheng of the Anhui Clique. Since then, he has served as the Chief of Staff for the Fengtian Army, Army Training Director, and manager of the Three Northeast Provinces Armament Factory.\n\nHe has long been a core member of Zhang Zuolin's inner circle, but he had an informal relationship with the Japanese Kwantung Army which proved fortuitous as relations soured between Shenyang and Tokyo. Sceptical of Zhang's ambitions to reunite China, and retaining a regionalist attitude, he saw the Japanese as an opportunity to gain fortune and power as well as protect Manchuria's autonomy.\n\nHe and other members of the Shikan clique sought to use Japanese investment to develop and modernise the northeast, building lasting ties with the Concordia Association and the Kwantung army. While the formation of an independent Manchuria was not necessarily their first intention, they have proven eager to accept the new realities of Japanese rule over Dongbei, even as their Japanese patrons continue to pull the strings in the background.\n\nTo them, this surrender is the only way to preserve any degree of freedom from further encroachment by Tokyo, even as they are denounced by the wider Chinese world. Whether with eyes closed or open, Yang Yuting and his followers stumble into an uncertain new era, daring history to judge them.§!"
