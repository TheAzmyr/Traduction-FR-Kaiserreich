### Events ###
 cea.1.t: "An Emirate of Chari?"
 cea.1.d: "Ben Aissa, former Askari commander of Bangui, has completely seized control of the city following the collapse of the chain of command. He and his Moroccan Askari have the support of German and Muslim elements in the city, and Binyamin becoming Emir of Ubanga Shari is little more than formalising a fait accompli."
 cea.1.a: "Nice."

 cea.2.t: "Build a Royal Palace"
 cea.2.d: "If we are to legitimise our rule as Emir of Chari, we surely need a palace worthy of a king."
 cea.2.a: "A palace? That sounds nice."

 cea.3.t: "The Aissa Dynasty"
 cea.3.d: "My lord, surely, as a newly crowned emir, many matters demand your attention. However, we must make sure that we do not have a dynastic crisis when you pass on; thus, the idea of establishing a formal harem of local women for you, sadiq. They would surely be honoured to meet you."
 cea.3.a: "It's good to be the Emir."

 cea.4.t: "Egypt's Helping Hand"
 cea.4.d: "Sadiq, we have to ensure that our efforts to cement your rule are not in vain. Thus, we must seek a treaty with the Kingdom of Egypt, our powerful neighbours who have greatly helped us so far."
 cea.4.a: "Make it so!"

 cea.5.t: "The Emir of Chari Proposes a Treaty"
 cea.5.d: "Shortly after German control broke down over Africa, a Moroccan Askari officer by the name of Binyamin Aissa has proclaimed himself Emir of Chari, with no small amount of support from locals and his men alike, who wished public order to be maintained first and foremost, and ours, in a... less than public fashion. Now that he has established a stable dominion of his lands, he proposes to join our alliance by the means of treaty. Such a deal with greatly strengthen our Sub-Saharan position, and allow us to further increase our influence in former German colonies."
 cea.5.a: "As planned."
 cea.5.b: "Why would we need a treaty with a jumped up mutineer?"
