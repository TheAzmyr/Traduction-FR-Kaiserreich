### Events ###
 gal.1.t: "Galicia and Lodomeria Becomes Independent"
 gal.1.d: "After centuries under Habsburg rule that began with the first partition of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1772, Galicia and Lodomeria sees herself independent. But we are a weak state surrounded by impressive neighbours - and maybe we would do good seeking protection from Poland, the nation our territory has been taken from all these years ago."
 gal.1.a: "Ask to formally join Poland. (Game Over)"
 gal.1.b: "Galicia shall remain independent."

 gal.2.t: "Galicia Seeks to Join Our Nation"
 gal.2.d: "After centuries under Habsburg rule that began with the first partition of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1772, Galicia and Lodomeria sees herself independent. But being a weak state surrounded by impressive neighbours, the newly independent nation feels her very existence threatened. A diplomatic envoy arrived today to discuss an incorporation of Galicia into Polish and Romanian territory."
 gal.2.a: "Welcome home, brothers."
 gal.2.b: "The Ukrainian Galicians join Ukraine."

 gal.3.t: "Galicia Desires Union with Poland"
 gal.3.d: "The former Austrian territory of Galicia-Lodomeria seems to have found itself in a state of limbo as of late. Acquired by the Habsburgs in 1772 during the partitions of Poland, the region is inhabited by a mix of Poles and Ukrainians who have not developed much of an attachment to a Galician identity - instead, they have preferred to identify more strongly with their respective countrymen elsewhere. As such, few have come to regard the satellite state that we have established in the region as anything more than a temporary measure that will be merged into another nation in time.\n\nNow that Poland is under the control of an allied government, the Poles of Galicia have decided that this time is now - we have received a request from [From.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] petitioning us to approve a union between Poland and Galicia-Lodomeria. While most among our government are sympathetic towards this request, there is a complication: this union would also bring a significant number of Ukrainians under the Polish flag, a prospect that not everyone is eager for. For their part, the government in Warsaw insists that the Ukrainians will be welcomed as fellow countrymen, but some diplomats believe that our needs are better met by keeping the states separate regardless. Should we allow the union to proceed?"
 gal.3.a: "Of course."
 gal.3.b: "No, we prefer them kept separate."

 gal.4.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Approves Union with Poland"
 gal.4.d: "Excellent news - our request to merge with our Polish countrymen has been approved! Preparations for the merger have already begun in earnest, as the border between us is set to become history."
 gal.4.a: "Send an envoy to Warsaw!"

 gal.5.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Denies Union with Poland"
 gal.5.d: "Tragically, [FROM.GetNameDef] denied our request for a union with Poland, citing strategic concerns. It seems that we are fated to remain apart for some time to come."
 gal.5.a: "Damn you!"

 gal.6.t: "Galician Poles Join Us"
 gal.6.d: "The Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria, established in 1772 as a crownland of the Habsburg Monarchy from the Partitions of Poland, has come to an end.\n\nWith its long history of ethnic and economic woes, the crownland was often neglected by Vienna, paving the way for significant autonomy and allowing the Polish and Ukrainian national movements to flourish- and compete. The Weltkrieg further led to the region becoming the "Piedmont" of Poland and Ukraine, with the Polish and Ukrainian legions fighting for their respective nation's liberation from Russian yoke.\nThe rightful unification of Galicians with their national homeland was thwarted by German-Austrian bickering, but this has proven to be merely temporary. With Galicia and Lodomeria to be dissolved, tensions between the Polish and Ukrainian states are expected to flare up. It remains to be seen how they handle the fate of the region and the addition of new ethnic minorities will be handled.\n\nNevertheless, today we welcome our brothers and sisters from the now-defunct crownland into our nation."
 gal.6.a: "Welcome home, brothers."

 gal.7.t: "Karl Albrecht Elected as King of Poland"
 gal.7.d: "The current Governor of Galicia and Lodomeria, Karl Albrecht von Habsburg, has just been elected as the new King of Poland after an intensely contested vote. Karl Albrecht is expected to leave the nation early tomorrow to take up his new position as leader of the Polish people, and has left Władysław Sikorski in charge of Galicia in his absence."
 gal.7.a: "Wish him luck."

 gal.8.t: "Galician Ukrainians Join Us"
 gal.8.d: "The Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria, established in 1772 as a crownland of the Habsburg Monarchy from the Partitions of Poland, has come to an end.\n\nWith its long history of ethnic and economic woes, the crownland was often neglected by Vienna, paving the way for significant autonomy and allowing the Polish and Ukrainian national movements to flourish- and compete.

 GAL_wladyslaw_sikorski: "Władysław Sikorski"

 GAL_wladyslaw_sikorski_army_chief_desc: "§YBorn:§! §LNovember 7th, 1881, in Tuszów Narodowy, Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria, Austria-Hungary§!\n§YBackground:§! §LWładysław Sikorski was the third son of a schoolteacher, and aimed for a career in engineering early on. After his graduation he volunteered for service in the Austro-Hungarian army and left it as a reserve second lieutenant. During this time he became involved in multiple organisations such as the socialist paramilitaries fighting for Poland's independence. He also met Piłsudski, Slawek, Sosnkowski and the other activists, and became the president of the Lwów chapter of the Riflemen's Association.\n\nWhen the Weltkrieg broke out, Sikorski was mobilised, and fought in the Polish units within the Austro-Hungarian military. Eventually he joined Piłsudski's Polish Legions and acted as a recruiter in Kraków. During this time he drifted away from Piłsudski, who spoke for a common cause with the Central Powers against Russia, while Sikorski believed that both Austrians and Germans had betrayed the Polish people too. Ironically Sikorski's doubts were confirmed when the Oath Crisis led to the disbanding of the Polish Legions. Sikorski himself returned to the Austro-Hungarian army, but soon joined Piłsudski in internment, after announcing lukewarm solidarity to his countryman.\n\nRefusing to serve under another German King, Władysław Sikorski decided to stay in Galicia after the war. He re-joined the army and became a prominent military theorist, calling for modernisation and motorisation of Galician forces. Sikorski has also been active in politics, campaigning for democracy and unification of the \"Two Polands\" on both sides of the border.§!"
