 KAZ_alikhan_bukeikhanov_leader_desc: "§YBorn:§! §LMarch 5th, 1866, in Tokyrauyn, Semipalatinsk Oblast, Russian Empire§!\n§YBackground:§! §LAlikhan Nurmukhameduly Bukeykhan was a part of the Kazakh upper class from birth - he was a direct descendant of the khans of the Bukei Horde, an autonomous Kazakh state which surrendered to the Russians in the 19th century. He acquired his higher education in Saint-Petersburg and grew up influenced by Kadet liberalism and moderate socialism - ultimately, this drew him to become a member of the Kadets and a diligent campaigner for Kazakh independence. After the Revolution of 1905, he split off to found the Alash Party - a moderate liberal political party advocating for an autonomous Kazakh entity in a greater Russia. This dream became real after the February Revolution of 1917, when, thanks to Aleksandr Kerensky's support, Bukeykhan was sent to Kazakhstan in order to organise a congress of Kazakhs in Semipalatinsk.\n\nDuring the Russian Civil War, the Alash Autonomy became a battleground between several factions, and was able to leverage its stalwart loyalty to assert the integrity of its territory. Having achieved the primary goal of his life, Bukeykhan retired from his position as President and allowed democracy to take charge, until the disastrous Tashkent Crisis nearly destroyed the Alash Party. Forced into power on the back of the emergency, continued partisan infighting has forced the father of the Autonomy to extend his rule, whether he likes it or not. At this point, the 70-year-old Bukeykhan is simply... tired. Especially tired of the Russians. And as long as he is given a chance, he will not hesitate to break the Autonomy away from this rotten structure.§!"

When, in response to the February Revolution, Kazakh nationalists formed the Alash Party, Amanzholov served as one of the founding members of the young Alash government, organising police and self-defence units in the Zhetysu, Almaty, and Shaushek regions throughout the turbulent times of 1917. As famine gripped the Kazakh regions, Amanzholov worked tirelessly to source and distribute food in spite of the red blockade of the region alongside fellow Alash leader Bazarbay Mametuly, and the two men forged a close friendship. As the Civil War heated up, Amanzholov was forced to lead his young militias, despite his complete lack of military training, receiving a trial by fire, along with some serious wounds, in battles against the Bolsheviks throughout 1918.\n\nHaving proven his mettle, Amanzholov would go on to lead the the Alash security forces, quasi-independent native military units under Russian oversight, as well as the nationalist faction of the Alash Party. Amanzholov has maintained a network of officers in Turkestan and Kazakhstan, and was the primary architect behind the 'Officer's Conspiracy', a group of anti-Russian Alash leaders who long plotted a revolt against Russian dominion. As the undisputed figurehead of the Kazakh uprising, Amanzholov has been named provisional president with sweeping emergency powers - powers he intends to use to free his people from centuries of oppression and humiliation.§!"

### Focus ###
 kazakhstan_focus: "[KAZ.GetName] Focus Tree"

 KAZ_independence_at_last: "Independence at Last!"
 KAZ_independence_at_last_desc: "For years we kowtowed to Moscow, suffering injustices and humiliations to retain our hard-fought autonomy, while whatever Russians who once respected our treaties and agreements dwindled away, suppressed and assassinated by chauvinists and jingoists. We will not allow our government to be written away by executive decree, and we will not allow our people to be extinguished by the tides of fate. No, we will fight for our freedom!"

 KAZ_surviving_the_onslaught: "Surviving the Onslaught"
 KAZ_surviving_the_onslaught_desc: "It is one thing to declare independence, it is another entirely to be independent. The Russians aim to crush us, to subjugate the steppes as their Muscovite forefathers did nearly a century ago. Whether our nation survives or returns to the dustbin of history, we will go forward into the night with our heads held high, and give no ground without spilling Russian blood."

 KAZ_unite_the_commands: "Unite the Commands"
 KAZ_unite_the_commands_desc: "With our military assembled in shadowy meetings and clandestine hierarchies, it is little surprise that our current forces are divided, disorganized, and far from a cohesive army. Each headsmen with ten able bodied has taken to calling himself a commander, and many units operate with next to no oversight or coordination. If we plan to face the might of the Russian army in battle, our units must answer to some sort of higher authority."

 KAZ_formalise_the_militias: "From a Militia to an Army"
 KAZ_formalise_the_militias_desc: "The Alash Army was formed under the Russian Republic, but was a backwater for unlucky Russian officers who commanded over Kazakhs as conquerors. With our drive to get rid of Moscovites, many units have overthrown their commanders and joined our cause - but these soldiers are far too often disorganised and incapable of standing against the Russian army for now."

 KAZ_elevate_supreme_commander: "Elevate the Supreme Commander"
 KAZ_elevate_supreme_commander_desc: "While others cowed to the enemy in the congress halls, one man conspired under the cover of darkness, laying the foundation for our glorious rebellion. Wise and experienced, there is no candidate better suited to lead the Free Kazakh Army than Sadyk Amanzholov."

 KAZ_build_redoubt: "Build a National Redoubt"
 KAZ_build_redoubt_desc: "When order was restored to the Semirechye Host in the years following the end of the Russian Civil War, the nationalists cast deep roots into the lands surrounding Almaty, forming a network of loyalist settlements which served as the bedrock of our revolt. Now, we must fortify this region, lest the ironclad heart of the rebellion fall to our enemies."

 KAZ_train_professional_army: "Train a Professional Army"
 KAZ_train_professional_army_desc: "Any shepherd with a matchlock is a militiaman, and our revolution has no shortage of militia. Creating a true army, however, requires a significant investment of resources and time, both of which are currently in short supply. We will need an army, however, if we hope to match up against the might of a modern opponent."

 KAZ_war_for_survival: "War for Survival"
 KAZ_war_for_survival_desc: "This is a war for the very survival of our nation and our people. If we lose against the Russian menace, Muscovite settlers will continue to pour into our ancestral homes, casting us further and further south. Our fight is not one of conquest or of ideological struggle! We shall not perish!"

 KAZ_strengthen_pact: "Strengthen the Pact"
 KAZ_strengthen_pact_desc: "While the Officers' Conspiracy has long worked in the shadows to organize resistance, it was not until Amanzholov and Shokay formed their anti-Russian pact that our insurgency transformed into a true revolution. While it is difficult bridging the gulf between the Pan-Turk ideologues and the conservative militia commands, it will be necessary for victory."

 KAZ_pan_turkists: "The Rise of the Pan-Turkists"
 KAZ_pan_turkists_desc: "Years of Russian rule and Alash corruption has left the majority of the populace politically indifferent, preventing them from contributing towards our bid for independence. There is one movement that has remained strong in the face of this political stagnation: the Pan-Turkists, bolstered by years of domination in the schools and among the recently graduated."

 KAZ_the_legionaries: "Integrate the Turkestani Units"
 KAZ_the_legionaries_desc: "The Turkestan National Army is a disorganised mess of paramilitary bands and hardened warriors. While some of his men are veterans of a decade long insurgency in the Turkestan Republic, the majority are restless young men, completely unprepared for combat. Some of these veterans can be brought back from the front to train this rabble so that it can be incorporated into our army."

 KAZ_istanbul: "Our Connections to Istanbul"
 KAZ_istanbul_desc: "The Pan-Turkist movement has connections both across Central Asia and among many of the leading Ottoman intellectuals and political leaders. By leveraging these connections, we would have the ability to enhance our legitimacy and strengthen our army with Ottoman support."

 KAZ_alash_patriots: "Absorb Alash Patriots"
 KAZ_alash_patriots_desc: "The Alash Party started with a glorious ideal but would go on to become poisoned by decades of political stagnation and electoral domination. This does not mean that the members of the various Alash factions were entirely corrupted by their greed and lethargy. There are still patriots among their ranks, whose support could prove vital in the battle to come."

 KAZ_kazakh_kemalism: "Kazakh Kemalism"
 KAZ_kazakh_kemalism_desc: "It would be an understatement to say that the founding fathers of our young republic worship Mustafa Kemal Gelibolu and his Ottoman experiment. The new Kazakh nation will have to be shielded from the greed and stagnation of the Alash remnants and their deeply entrenched stranglehold over Kazakh politics by a vanguard of committed and driven leaders, who operate above the fickle whims of the populace."

 KAZ_strengthen_executive: "Strengthen the Executive Council"
 KAZ_strengthen_executive_desc: "With the urgency of the present conflict, we have little room for discussion or compromise in the matters of national security. In response, we have centralized power around a supreme Executive Council which has managed to cut through the red tape. By strengthening and institutionalising this council, we will be able to avoid the stagnation and turmoil of parliamentary infighting."

 KAZ_national_security_council: "Form the National Security Committee"
 KAZ_national_security_council_desc: "We cannot simply succeed on the battlefield if we hope to survive, we must also secure our homeland from the danger of fifth-columnists and defeatists. A specialised force of anti-insurgency police must be empowered to arrest any and all dissidents who would threaten the security of our republic."

 KAZ_anti_corruption: "Anti-Corruption Policing"
 KAZ_anti_corruption_desc: "For years, elements of our nation have grown fat off of the hard work of our people through grift and guile, leeching away the life-blood of our nation for their own personal gain. The focus of our policing must be on culling this corrupt cabal, and if some of our opponents happen to be caught up in these investigations, who are we to complain?"

 KAZ_tulpar_rises: "The Tulpar Rises"
 KAZ_tulpar_rises_desc: "Created by mixing the features of the traditional hunting animals of the steppe (the hawk and the horse), the winged horse has long been the unofficial icon of our people. By incorporating its image into our state symbols and extolling the virtues it represents, we can forge a new identity for our young nation, one which could serve to unite all Kazakhs under one banner."

 KAZ_overcoming_our_deficits: "Overcoming our Deficits"
 KAZ_overcoming_our_deficits_desc: "The steppes have little in the way of industrial resources, and years of Russian neglect have had their toll on our modernising efforts. Now that we have cast off our shackles, we have the opportunity to bring our nation into the future by rapidly building up heavy industry through direct state intervention."

 KAZ_expand_caspian_sea_ports: "Build up Caspian Sea Ports"
 KAZ_expand_caspian_sea_ports_desc: "Since its construction nearly a century ago, Fort Aleksandrovsky has granted those who occupied it control over much of the Caspian, a fact which was only reinforced at the height of the Civil War when Red and White warships clashed outside its waters. By expanding its infrastructure, we will better be able to influence trade in the Caspian."

 KAZ_reassess_rails: "Reassess the Rails"
 KAZ_reassess_rails_desc: "Our rail network is closely tied to Russian rail, leaving us vulnerable in the face of future northern aggression. By creating new railways purpose built to connect our lands, we will further our economic efficiency and better be able to coordinate our armies."

 KAZ_radical_land_reform: "Seize the Traitor Settlements"
 KAZ_radical_land_reform_desc: "For years, the Russians have bled our nation dry, driving us from the north and sneering at our feeble attempts to negotiate. Now, for the first time in centuries, it is us Kazakhs who have the upper hand. We will not waste this opportunity! The Russian landowner will no longer deprive our brave brothers of their country!"

 KAZ_absorb_ultranationalists: "Absorb the Ultranationalists"
 KAZ_absorb_ultranationalists_desc: "While the base of support for our revolution has always been Kazkah traditionalists and nationalists, there are some on the fringe of this movement, monarchists and ultranationalists, who lent their support for our revolution, yet were barred from positions of prominence within our government. Such loyalty should not go unrewarded, especially when elements of our state apparatus would be very well suited for their zeal."

 KAZ_kazakhstan_for_kazakhs: "Kazakhs, not Alash"
 KAZ_kazakhstan_for_kazakhs_desc: "The Old Guard of the Alash Party, preoccupied with their flowery phrases and devious compromises, intended to surrender the security and liberty of our people in exchange for their continued dominion. Luckily for us, they no longer rule over these lands. The remnants of the “Alash Project” must be wiped away, and the efforts to break down the Kazakh identity in favor of Pan-Turkism must be reversed."

 KAZ_linguistic_unification: "Linguistic Unification"
 KAZ_linguistic_unification_desc: "Every time a citizen of our republic speaks the Russian tongue, the scars of colonial rule shine brightly. While the Alash Old Guard was happy to elevate Russian as an equal to our mother tongue, we will not stand for this injustice. The Kazakhification of our republic will begin in the schoolhouses and the government halls. If our citizens are truly to be freed, they must be united behind one common banner and one common language."

 KAZ_soar_above: "Soar Above the Steppe"
 KAZ_soar_above_desc: "Oyan! Qazaq! We have lived heads bowed for too long. No more! This vast steppe belongs to us, has belonged ever since the Göktürks. The Russian colonizer will be driven away, and their Alash lapdogs purified from our society!"

### Ideas ###
 KAZ_ethnic_tensions: "Ethnic Tensions"
 KAZ_ethnic_tensions_desc: "Almost every fifth citizen of the Alash Orda is a Russian settler, either descended from the first Russian colonists who came here centuries ago or they're part of the great wave of immigrants which were brought here in the early 1900s by Pyotr Stolypin. The discrepancy in influence between the minority Russians and majority Kazakhs has created heated ethnic conflicts, and even a form of segregation as most Kazakhs fled to the southern lands, away from Russian settlements in the north. As if that wasn't bad enough, the settlers themselves are also frequently in conflict with other ethnic groups such as Cossacks and Uyghurs."
 KAZ_alash_militias: "Alash Militias"
 KAZ_alash_militias_desc: "During the Russian Revolution, the fathers of our nation formed bands of local militias, who defended our lands against the Soviets and aided the White Armies in their violent struggle. These defence committees did not simply disband at the close of the conflict, but instead our government organised them into the Alash Army under the Russian command. Once again, our nation is threatened by total conquest, and many units overthrew their Russian commanders to join our cause."
 KAZ_centralised_command_0: "Centralised Command"
 KAZ_centralised_command_0_desc: "Our soldiers are led by a number of different tribal leaders, cossacks, warlords, and generals. Only by uniting these forces under one command, namely that of the experienced general and statesman Sadyk Amanzholov, can we hope to survive the onslaught."
 KAZ_centralised_command_1: "Military Rule"
 KAZ_centralised_command_1_desc: "The rule of poets, professors, and orators is fine when the goal of your government is negotiation and conciliation. Unfortunately, the time for talk has passed, and the time for action is now."
 KAZ_land_reform: "Land Reform Efforts"
 KAZ_land_reform_desc: "For decades, our traditional homelands have been unequally distributed among its peoples. By redistributing property away from wealthy landowners and predatory settlers, we will ensure stability, security, and prosperity."

 KAZ_KR_gathering_storm_desc: "The Alash Party, formed in the aftermath of the February Revolution, was able to achieve a breakthrough for the Kazakh peoples: autonomy under a federal Russia. Under its rule, the newly-formed Alash Autonomy was able to quickly recover from the civil war with support from Moscow. But after the coup in Tashkent, the autonomy's relations with the central government have only worsened, and its southern neighbour continues to harbour Kazakh dissidents. With Savinkov beginning his plans to redistribute Kazakh land to the Russians, there is only one path for Kazakhstan: freedom or death.\n§rNOTE: You will start the game as Turkestan.§!"

 ### Events ###
 kaz.2.t: "Our New Capital"
 kaz.2.d: "The northern borders of our nation are the most densely populated, but also the most vulnerable in any potential future conflict with Russia. Thus it is clear that capital cannot be put there, even though towns like Alash-Qala have a long tradition as centers of Kazakh culture. There are two obvious candidates for the capital city: Almaty or Karaganda.\n\nAlmaty, Verniy in Russian, is the most industrialised city in our country, and its southern and mountainous location does make it protected against any threat from the north - and it is where our great national revolution began. However, Almaty has a significant Russian population, and is right at the Turkestani border.\n\nKaraganda, on the other hand, lies in the center of our country, is deeply Kazakh and represents the very soul of our nation. But Karaganda is barely developed, and it will take time and money to build the necessary infrastructure there."
 kaz.2.a: "Settle in Almaty."
 kaz.2.b: "Karaganda it is."

 kaz.3.t: "The Kazakh Delegation"
 kaz.3.d: "The Provisional Prime Minister of the new Kazakh Republic, Mustafa Shokay, has made the first official state visit of the young republic, to no other place than [TUR.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. Shokay met with [TUR.GetLeader] and spoke in the parliament, addressing the Turks to lend support to the desperate cause of the brothers of Turkestan. Shokay was a delicate speaker, and vividly described the hardships of the Turkestan National Army and the good work that has been done with Madamin Bek and Sadyk Amanzholov to undermine the Russian cause in Turkish lands. Shokay himself is an admirer of Mustafa Kemal, and perhaps the most vocal champion of Pan-Turkism in Central Asia, wishing to go beyond mere Kazakh nationalism. Shokay's visit drew much attention in the capital, and raised public awareness on this faraway fight that our brothers in the north are fighting."
 kaz.3.a: "We are strong together."

 kaz.4.t: "Mission to Almaty"
 kaz.4.d: "The Kazakhs have petitioned for us to send a proper military mission there, to train and organise their young army. Most of their military leaders only served as junior officers in the Russian army, and they are greatly lacking in professional officers. In [TUR.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], General $TUR_huseyin_husnu_erkilet$ has emerged as a particularly staunch supporter of the Kazakh cause. In his meeting with the government, he argued that it is our moral duty to help those Turks less fortunate in their circumstances, and that the Pan-Turanist cause is more important than any political consideration. $TUR_huseyin_husnu_erkilet$ volunteered to lead such a mission himself, believing that the fight of the Turks of Central Asia is the beginning of a new golden era for Turkic peoples - but only if it succeeds."
 kaz.4.a: "Go, and teach them to win."
 kaz.4.b: "We will deploy a mission, but his duty is here."
 kaz.4.c: "Seems like a lost cause."

 kaz.5.t: "The Turkish Mission Arrives"
 kaz.5.d: "[TUR.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] has agreed to our request for military support. A significant Turkish military mission has arrived at our improvised army headquarters in Almaty and met with General Amanzholov. Quick arrangements have been made: the [TUR.GetAdjective] officers will be dispatched to different units as advisors, with the authority to carry out the reorganisation. Others have been directed to greatly improve our officer school, and to rapidly train new officers from talented Kazakh men."
 kaz.5.a: "We will succeed!"
