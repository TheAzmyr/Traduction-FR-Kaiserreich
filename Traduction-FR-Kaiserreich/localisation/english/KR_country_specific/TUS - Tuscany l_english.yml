 TUS_pietro_ferdinando_regnal: "Pietro Ferdinando I"
 TUS_pietro_ferdinando_leader_desc: "§YBorn:§! §LMay 12th, 1874, in Salzburg, Duchy of Salzburg, Austria-Hungary§!\n§YBackground:§! §LArchduke Joseph Ferdinand of Austria has waited a long time to sit in the throne he was promised in the Treaty of Rome. An accomplished commander and a hero of the Weltkrieg in Austria, he was still unable to coordinate a defence against the rising republican and later syndicalist threat in he uneven terrain of Tuscany, and later retreated to Lazio to avoid being encircled. He never really saw the title of Grand Duke as much more than a promise for many years, but his long army career will probably have an impact in his reign. A pompous and proud man, he is eager to learn about the lands he now considers his, even if his sometimes obvious questions regarding landmarks make him almost feel like a noble a tourist rather than a Duke. Thankfully for him, a government of local officers and politicians oversee most of the boring bureaucracy.§!"
