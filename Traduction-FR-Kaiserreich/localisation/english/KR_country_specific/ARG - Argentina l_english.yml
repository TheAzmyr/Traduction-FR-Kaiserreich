 ARG_national_populist_party_long: "Liga Patriótica Argentina\n§gA far-right paramilitary group similar to the Romanian Iron Guard, the Liga Patriótica Argentina has become the most influential political organisation within Argentina since the Chistmas Coup.\n\nLiga was found in 1919, when Carlés was appointed as a commander of the paramilitary volunteers that were sent in to end protests of the workers on English-owned plant. 'Liga Patriótica Argentina', as they called themselves, were responsible for the murder of hundreds of striking workers. In 1921 and 1922, during the rebellion in Patagonia, LPA forces caused gruesome acts of violence against strikers both in Patagonia and during a general strike in Buenos Aires.\n\nIn 1930 Liga participated in Uriburu's coup, who, with the support of the army and the LPA, ousted the government and installed a corporatist, ultranationalist military dictatorship. In 1932, the military regime collapsed after Uriburu's death. After a power struggle, UCR member Julio Roca became the new head of state. Roca began to seek a peace settlement with the Patagonians. Carlés took advantage of the popular outrage and launched a coup d'état on the 24th of December 1935 when Liga with the support of navy and parts of the military captured the capital.\n\nThe LPA sees the salvation of Argentina, the return to former greatness and the removal of all hostile elements as their primary goal; they act extremely populist on the outside, claiming to serve the Argentinian people for a greater good.\n\nFounded: §Y1919§!\nIdeology:\n- National populism\n- Corporatist capitalism\n- Nationalism§!\n"
 ARG_paternal_autocrat_party: "LdJ (GOU)"
 ARG_paternal_autocrat_party_long: "Libertadores de Junio (Grupo de Oficiales Unidos)\n§gIt is a secret club that reflects and comprises 'the heart and soul of the military leadership.' It is also known as the Group of United Officers (GOU). Created during Julio Argentino Pascual Roca presidency in 1933 due to military opposition to possible peace treaty with Patagonian socialists.\n\nAlthough they oppose ex-President Roca's conciliatory stance with the FOP's 'godless socialists,' they are disillusioned of Carlés policies, viewing him as a 'dangerous radical,' and would prefer a firmer hand, one that has the backing of the Argentine people behind it...\n\nThis group has strong nationalist and Catholic ideas, as well as a strict neutrality approach to foreign policy, believing that Argentina should avoid wars with both regional powers such as Brazil and global players, be it Reichspakt, Entente, or even Internationale. Patagonia and socialist Chile are exceptions; reunification of the nation is one of their key goals, and failure to achieve it by the government might have catastrophic implications.\n\nFounded: §Y1933§!\nIdeology:\n- Militarism\n- Corporatist capitalism\n- Catholic conservatism§!\n"
 ARG_authoritarian_democrat_party: "PJ"
 ARG_authoritarian_democrat_party_long: "Partido Justicialista\n§gAlthough not a party they are an important group, they comprise Juan Domingo Perón's political network who themselves are only a few radical Argentine officers and some trade union leaders. Perón espouses a concept of a party in service of a strong and just leader who would unify the population into bringing about social justice, these ideas however marginal, hold great appeal to a population tired of political squabbling and sterile dictatorships. It remains to be seen whenether Perón's group hold any sway in the new Argentinian political climate.\n\nFounded: §Y1930s§!\nIdeology:\n- Populism\n- Corporatist capitalism\n- Personality Cult\n- Reformism§!\n"
 ARG_social_conservative_party: "UCRA"
 ARG_social_conservative_party_long: "Unión Cívica Radical Antipersonalista\n§gThe UCRA was part of a broad movement calling itself 'anti-personalist', which questioned the figure of Hipólito Yrigoyen (president from 1916-1922 / 1928-1930), whom they accused of being 'personalist' and undemocratic. Created in 1924 from a rupture within the UCR, In the 1928 elections, it presented the candidacy of Leopoldo Melo, who lost to Hipólito Yrigoyen, candidate of the UCR. Starting in 1932, it joined the coalition called the Concordancia that won the 1932 elections with Julio Argentino Pascual Roca becoming a president.\n\nFounded: §Y1924§!\nIdeology:\n- Conservatism\n- Capitalism\n- Democracy§!\n"
 ARG_market_liberal_party: "PDN"
 ARG_market_liberal_party_long: "Partido Demócrata Nacional\n§gThe PDN (PNA until 1932) was one of Argentina's oldest political parties and closely connected to the Roca family, who provided two Argentinian Presidents in the last 50 years: Alejo Julio Argentino Roca Paz (1880-1886, 1898-1904) and Julio Argentino Pascual Roca (1932-1935).\n\nIt was created on March 15th, 1874, after the union of the Autonomist Party and the National Party. It was since its inception a highly important party, and the Roca family became very influential within the party, with Alejo Julio Argentino Roca Paz becoming a president in 1880-1886 and 1898-1904. It later became the bedrock of la edad de oro (1880 - 1916), boasting a booming economy and a flood of immigrants from Europe which strengthened Argentina's industry, becoming one of the most prosperous contries in the world before the Weltkrieg. Meanwhile, its main rival became the Radical Civic Union (UCR). It was criticised for its use of election fraud, which lead to PNA dissolving with its members joining Conservative Party and the Democratic Progressive Party.\n\nFollowing Uriburu's death in early 1932, the PNA was reborn as Partido Demócrata Nacional (PDN) for the upcoming 1932 elections with Julio Argentino Pascual Roca being its leader, and PDN, thanks to electoral fraud, won by a landslide. Roca was inaugurated president, and he promised to find a compromise with their syndicalist neighbours Patagonia and Chile. Although many hoped that Roca would bring back the good old times and strengthen Argentina's position globally, this did not happen.\n\nAlthough he took a less radical course than Uriburu and developed plans to recapture the lost territories at Patagonia, launching small skirmishes into FOP territory and successfully retaking Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego thanks to the navy, he scrapped plans to send the army into Patagonian core territory, deciding to focus more on improving the economy. Roca's takeover disgruntled the military and the LPA, and due to his political liberalisation, rumours started to spread in 1935 that there would be an imminent peace settlement with the Patagonians, causing outrage across the nation. This was enough for Carlés and the LPA to launch a coup on Christmas day, putting Roca and his ministers under temporary house arrest as Carlés proclaimed himself President.\n\nFounded: §Y1932§!\nIdeology:\n- Economic liberalism\n- Conservative liberalism§!\n"
 ARG_social_liberal_party: "UCR"
 ARG_social_liberal_party_long: "Unión Cívica Radical\n§gFounded on June 26th, 1891, the party quickly became influential over Argentine politics, causing the 1893 Radical Revolution and the 1905 Radical Revolution, which later led to reform in terms of election fraud. Two presidents of Argentina to be part of the Radical Civic Union were §YHipólito Yrigoyen§! and §YMarcelo Torcuato de Alvear§!.\n\nIn 1916 the Argentine General Election took place, being the first where the Roque Sáenz Peña Law was implemented, establishing universal, secret and compulsory male suffrage. Yrigoyen, candidate of the UCR, ended up winning the elections.\n\nHis tumultous presidency between 1916 - 1922, with the secession of Patagonia, had de Alvear replace him as the UCR candidate for the 1922 elections, which he won. Argentina saw slight economic improvement right until the British Revolution occurred, which led to the crash of April 1925. Despite this, de Alvear ordered the navy to capture the Falkland Islands and South Georgia. This increased morale and trust in the government, but led to the radicalisation of the military which had been previously humiliated by the Patagonian Rebellion, and now stood in the shadow of the popular navy.\n\nIn 1928, Yrigoyen was surprisingly appointed as the Radical Civic's Union candidate for the general elections instead of the current and relatively popular Marcelo Torcuato de Alvear. Despite this, Yrigoyen won by a large margin, which led many to speculate that it was due to election fraud.\n\nYrigoyen's most important opposition was the military, which started planning a coup against him. This eventually happened on September 6th, 1930, as Uriburu, with support from Carlés and the LPA, took over and proclaimed himself president of Argentina, banning political parties, arresting democratic politicians and suspending the 1853 Constitution. Yrigoyen's supporters, called Yrigoyenists, were tortured alongside other political opponents of his regime. Yrigoyen himself was held under arrest at the Martín García Island.\n\nUriburu eventually died in early 1932, and Argentina went back to democracy under conservative politician Julio Argentino Pascual Roca. Yrigoyen died in 1933, and now de Alvear is leading the party.\n\nFounded: §Y1891§!\nIdeology:\n- Liberalism\n- Radicalism\n- Democracy§!\n"

It became Argentina's third-most important party after the popular Radical Civic Union and the National Autonomist Party, battling the spot with the Socialist Party. After Uriburu's coup, the Democratic Progressive Party regained some popularity.\n\nFounded: §Y1914§!\nIdeology:\n- Social Democracy\n- Protectionism\n- Federalism§!\n"

 ARG_radical_socialist_party_long: "Partido Socialista\n§gA minuscule party compared to the ones present in Patagonia. Founded in 1896 by Nicolás Repetto, it became the first mass party in Argentina. It gained notoriety, gaining its first representative in 1903 and becoming the first socialist in America to obtain a representative charge, and then in 1904 Alfredo Palacios became the first socialist deputy in America. It gained more and more traction and then started participating in the general elections after the Roque Sáenz Peña Law was passed, being in 4th place in the 1916 and 1922 general elections and then 3rd in the 1928 general elections. But it soon found itself marginalised amid the growing Red Scare and finally banned.

 ARG_Church_Ties: "Church Ties"

While Ramírez is a fan of seeking closer ties to the Germans, especially considering the huge amount of German migrants Argentina has received over the years, others have voiced their concerns and could act if we would risk Argentinian neutrality by joining a faction that might draw our peaceful country into war."

We should put it to use to make our military more mobile and harder fitting on the battleground. We should adopt a doctrine focusing on speed and firepower."
 ARG_Infantry_Doctrine_Specialisation: "Focus on Infantry Doctrines"
 ARG_Infantry_Doctrine_Specialisation_desc: "Every military needs a coherent military doctrine to guideline how the army should fight. Many generals suggest sticking with proven methods which have already shown their effectiveness in wars all around the world."
 ARG_Tank_Designs: "Experimental Tank Designs"
 ARG_Tank_Designs_desc: "A new type of vehicle has seen its first combat in the Weltkrieg: The tank. We should build our experimental tank designs to incorporate this promising weapon into our military."
 ARG_Mechanised_Equipment_Production: "New Mechanised Equipment"
 ARG_Mechanised_Equipment_Production_desc: "Our new experimental mechanised designs have proven to be able to reach speeds unimaginable with foot infantry and even cavalry. If we put this speed to our advantage, we will be able to have the strategic upper hand on the battlefield."
 ARG_Modern_Doctrine_I: "American Civil War Doctrines"
 ARG_Modern_Doctrine_I_desc: "In the aftermath of the Second American Civil War, the bloodiest conflict in the New World, a lot of military lessons can be learnt in such spheres as urban warfare, armour tactics, widespread militias usage and land-air coordination."
 ARG_Modern_Doctrine_II: "Second Weltkrieg Warfare Studying"
 ARG_Modern_Doctrine_II_desc: "The Second Weltkrieg is over - and it completely changed the nature of warfare. Trench warfare evolved into something completely different. Mobile warfare, widespread aviation usage, massive naval invasions - all lessons of the war will be learnt for decades, but the first ones can be learnt already."
 ARG_Special_Forces_Mountaineers: "Mountaineers Equipment"
 ARG_Special_Forces_Mountaineers_desc: "South America has a lot of hills and mountains, and to succeed in local conflicts, our forces should be prepared for war in mountains."
 ARG_Special_Forces_Jungles: "Jungle Combat Training"
 ARG_Special_Forces_Jungles_desc: "With jungles covering a huge part of South America, our infantry should be trained to fight in jungle warfare to be ready in case they have to fight there."

 ARG_Land_Based_AA_desc: "If any enemy bomber wishes to enter Argentinian airspace, we shall greet them with large calibre land-based anti-air weapons."
 ARG_Republican_Airforce: "Republican Air Force"
 ARG_Republican_Airforce_desc: "Previously, only the birds flew above Argentina. With the Weltkrieg, the aircraft has proven to be a vital military piece of equipment. In order to control the skies above Argentina, we must fund the FAA, which stands for 'Fuerzas Aerea Argentina'. While it shall be subordinate to the army until it consolidates, we hope to make it as strong as our army and navy are at the moment."
 ARG_Rain_Down_Hellfire: "Rain down Hell"
 ARG_Rain_Down_Hellfire_desc: "Not only does the aircraft permit leisure flights over the Andes, but it also permits to penetrate deep into enemy territory. By constructing large bombers which can carry a large payload of bombs, we can damage and destroy vital enemy infrastructure from the air."
 ARG_Strategic_Destruction: "Carpet Bombing runs"
 ARG_Strategic_Destruction_desc: "A single bomber might damage a railway, but a concentrated wave of bombers will destroy the entire railway hub. By bombing a large surface with a formation of bombers, we will be able to deal decisive damage to the enemy."
 ARG_Figther_Focus: "Fighter Focus"
 ARG_Figther_Focus_desc: "Our bombers can bomb enemy infrastructure, but so can the enemy bomb ours. We must develop more advanced fighters to intercept and destroy enemy aerial formations."
 ARG_CAS_Focus: "Close Air Support"
 ARG_CAS_Focus_desc: "Bombers don't have to be large and heavy, they can also be as small as a normal fighter. These more agile planes will be perfect to support our ground forces on the battlefield with precision bombing strikes."
 ARG_Air_Doctrine: "Doctrinal Advances"
 ARG_Air_Doctrine_desc: "Ever since the creation of the 'Fuerza Aerea Argentina', it has greatly developed. In order to render it an equal military force to the army and navy, we must develop new aerial doctrines."
 ARG_War_Experience: "Combat Experience"
 ARG_War_Experience_desc: "In theory, our bombers can easily bomb enemy ground forces while our fighters stop any hostile aircraft. In practice, the situation in the air can become quite chaotic. With air combat experience gathered during the Second American Civil War, we can improve our aerial doctrine."
 ARG_Pilots_Training: "Pilots Training"
 ARG_Pilots_Training_desc: "Getting modern aircraft is not enough to succeed in air combat. With providing extensive training for our pilots, we increase their chances to achieve combat goals and return alive."
 ARG_Paratrooper_Corps: "Paratrooper Corps"
 ARG_Paratrooper_Corps_desc: "Our bombers can penetrate deep into enemy territory. What if we were to repurpose these bombers to transport army units to positions behind the enemy lines?"

 ARG_Argentine_Navy: "Armada Argentina"
 ARG_Argentine_Navy_desc: "The Armada Argentina (Argentine Navy) is currently the 8th most powerful navy in the world, preceded only by the European powers, the US and Japan. We also have the current largest navy in South America, and it'd be in our best interest to maintain this naval hegemony."
 ARG_Fleet_on_the_Open_Seas: "Fleet on the Open Seas"
 ARG_Fleet_on_the_Open_Seas_desc: "With most of our trade depending on sea lanes and many of our cities sitting on the Atlantic's shores, we need a fleet capable of maintaining control in the Open Seas, no matter the foe they might face"
 ARG_Escorting_Ships: "Escort Ships"
 ARG_Escorting_Ships_desc: "Argentina is considered to be the 'Granary of the World'. However, this reputation would be ill-founded if we allowed our transports to be sunk by rogue enemy ships. In order to protect these ships and their valuable cargo, we have decided it will be smart to invest in escort ships"
 ARG_Quick_but_Powerful: "Quick but Powerful"
 ARG_Quick_but_Powerful_desc: "Sea Warfare is changing. It's no longer enough to fit huge guns into large armoured mechanical sea monsters, it's also necessary for them to be able to catch up and flank enemy fleets effectively and to be able to dodge enemy fire that would otherwise be lethal."
 ARG_Submarine_Focus: "Submarine Focus"
 ARG_Submarine_Focus_desc: "Naval High command acquired three Sicilian submarines 4 years ago. Since then, the 'Tarantinos', as they've been called by their crews, have performed remarkably well, and naval commander Ramón A. Poch insists in the potential this invention has for the future of naval warfare and that we should continue to invest in them."
 ARG_Battlecruisers: "Battlecruisers"
 ARG_Battlecruisers_desc: "Our ten-year long investment in our navy is paying off with the presence of several battleships in our docks. However, we realised we lack a middle ground between our heavily armed but slow battleships and our lightly armed but fast cruisers. To fill this gap, we've decided it'll be best to invest in modern Battlecruisers."
 ARG_Coastal_Protection: "Coastal Protection"
 ARG_Coastal_Protection_desc: "Our people's prosperity depends on keeping an open route to the sea. With that in mind, we can't allow the enemy to mine our shores and ports, so we need to invest in minesweepers and better spotting mechanisms for our navy."
 ARG_Light_Cruisers: "Light Cruisers"
 ARG_Light_Cruisers_desc: "The 'Trento' class cruisers we bought a few years ago from the Sicilian Dockyards have become great additions to our fleet. Unfortunately, they are way too heavily armed for our current needs. However, our engineers have been hard at work to develop a better and lighter version that will give their bigger cousins a run for their money."
 ARG_Carriers: "Naval Aviation"
 ARG_Carriers_desc: "Aeroplanes have risen to prominence in the last decades and that is something we cannot deny. While we might be hard-pressed to match any of the top naval powers in the world, we could compensate our lack of strength with planes that might tip the odds of a naval battle in our favour."
 ARG_Tandanor_Shipyards: "Expand Talleres Navales de la Marina"
 ARG_Tandanor_Shipyards_desc: "Rising tensions with the other naval powers of South America and the necessity to stay competitive have forced us to consider an expansion of our dockyards and who better to do this than Talleres Navales de la Marina?"
 ARG_Cruiser_Program: "Cruiser Programme"
 ARG_Cruiser_Program_desc: "Our Battleships may be powerful, but they also need to be paired powerful escorts. To that end, we have decided it would be wise to invest in a Cruiser programme to improve our current ones."
 ARG_Fleet_Movements: "Fleet Movements"
 ARG_Fleet_Movements_desc: "It's not enough that we have a fast, sturdy and powerful navy if our officers don't know how to take advantage of their ships capabilities. We will take our officers into the sea with these ships and perform naval exercises."
 ARG_Expand_the_Docks: "Expand the Docks"
 ARG_Expand_the_Docks_desc: "Our Docks, while impressive for a South American Country, are no longer enough for our ambitions! If we want to surpass the other powers in the world, an expansion of our docks is in order."
 #ARG_Merchant_Marine: "Merchant Marine" already defined above as an idea
 ARG_Merchant_Marine_desc: "While Argentines love to take pride in their military navy, the most important branch is not the military naval marine, but the merchant one. Without them, we'd be isolated from the world that awaits our products with open arms and that has made this country great. An investment in the merchant marine is in order."
 ARG_Land_Fortifications: "Protecting the Coast"
 ARG_Land_Fortifications_desc: "Our three main port cities, Buenos Aires, Mar del Plata and Bahia Blanca are currently unprotected from a naval invasion if our foes managed to tie down or destroy our fleet. To guard us against this eventuality, we have decided to focus on making strong fortifications in the cities and some light forts all along the coastline."
 ARG_Comando_de_Infanteria_de_Marina: "Comando de Infanteria de Marina"
 ARG_Comando_de_Infanteria_de_Marina_desc: "While the Argentinian Marines haven't had many chances to prove their worth, the exploits of Captain Hipólito Bouchard back in the day have proven the value of a landing force. If we ever hope to match and surpass other modern marine forces, we need to expand our separate command for our Marines, the 'Comando de la Infanteria de Marina'"
 ARG_Oficina_Central_de_Hidrografia: "Oficina Central de Hidrografía"
 ARG_Oficina_Central_de_Hidrografia_desc: "In naval warfare, it's not just about having better ships and officers. We need to expand the Oficina Central de Hidrografía (Central Office of Hydrography) in order to better analyse weather, naval geology, oceanography and nautical cartography not just of our home waters but also those of our enemies. Our enemies will find we're at home wherever we may encounter them."
 ARG_ASTARSA_Expansion: "ASTARSA Expansion"
 ARG_ASTARSA_Expansion_desc: "The 'Astilleros Argentinos Rio de la Plata S.A.' (Argentinian Dockyards of the La Plata River S.A.) is one of the most important naval companies we have in our country. Expanding their facilities will help us produce a navy that will make the socialists tremble!"
 ARG_Naval_Academy: "Naval Academy"
 ARG_Naval_Academy_desc: "Expanded courses for naval officers should give our fleet advantage, especially when operating in home waters."

 ARG_Rule_Britannia_Britannia_Rules_the_Waves: "Irse a Pique Antes que Rendir el Pabellón!"
 ARG_Rule_Britannia_Britannia_Rules_the_Waves_desc: "'We'll go to the bottom before surrendering our ensign!' was the battle cry Admiral Guillermo Brown gave before going into the fray at the battle of Quilmes in 1826 against the Brazilian navy. Our navy shall reflect his patriotic spirit, and every crew will give everything they got before surrendering our country to the enemy!"

While initial reports indicate some success, there is a long way to go..."

### Intro Screen ###
 ARG_country_intro_header: "Status of Argentina"
 ARG_country_intro_content: "By the early 20th century, Argentina was enjoying a booming and fast-growing economic prowess based on its meat and cereal exports. Immigrants from all over Europe flooded towards the Republic and vigorous entrepreneurship and a nascent industry quickly propelled Argentina forwards as one of the most prosperous nations on the planet. Trade relations were secure and exports to the United Kingdom and Germany kept increasing.\n\nWhen the Weltkrieg however struck, Argentina was forced into neutrality unwilling to side with either its most important economic partner, the UK, or its second most important one, Germany. By steering between the two, sanctions were brought down by the British, enforcing an embargo on trade with Germany. While Argentina tried circumventing this by selling through third countries, the sales were not the same and the pre-WK miracle slowed down.\n\nAs the last years of the Weltkrieg approached, it became apparent to the UK that it was fighting a losing fight and ordered the Argentinian government and companies to ramp up production and exploit the nation to the fullest. Discontent with the increased demands and sick of British exploitation, the workers started to organise, protest and finally rise up in an armed revolt. Unable to fully contain the situation, the control of the Argentinian government on the uprisings went from bad to worse and by the mid-20s Argentina had lost control of Santa Cruz, Chubut and Rio Negro Provinces to the newly formed Frente Obrero Patagonico.\n\nThree subsequent democratically elected governments were tasked with solving the crisis but failed one after another. In response to their incapacity to rule, General Uriburu rose up in 1930 to attempt crushing the revolt. A reign of terror spread across the nation with socialist and syndicalist sympathisers massacred and pushed southwards. His dictatorship is however short lived as he dies from cancer two years later, forming a power vacuum and once more no large-scale intervention in the South."

 ARG_country_intro_header_1: "The Christmas Coup"
 ARG_country_intro_content_1: "Elections are written out and through electoral fraud, the PAN under Roca successfully takes power, prompting a slow recovery from Uriburu's dictatorship and a changing attitude towards the FOP (Patagonian Workers Front). Small skirmishes into FOP territory are launched and the navy successfully retakes the Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego. Intervention from Chile, however, stops the government from achieving victory and temporarily ends the conflict with the FOP.\n\nWhen in 1935, rumours started surfacing that Roca may be attempting to end the conflict and leave the FOP alone, outrage across the nation erupts, enabling the Liga Patriótica under Manuel Carlés to gain the support they need - culminating in the Christmas Coup. Supported by the Navy and various military elements, Carlés coups the government on Christmas 1935, takes control over the capital region, and starts solidifying his hold on the nation.\n\nOn the first of January 1936, Carlés is still in the midst of his attempted coup - with success far from certain. Aside from the Buenos Aires capital region and a few small inland provinces, his control is nihil. Support from the ARA or 'Argentinian Armada' is guaranteed, but many of the military commanders in the Army doubt Carlés' potential and are organising to put down his coup."

 argmil.13.d: "Increasing aversion between the military branches of our army came to blows last night in Buenos Aires when a group of drunk ARA sailors encountered a military patrol. Arguments surrounding the recent budget cuts for the navy led to a fistfight between the two parties and was quickly followed up by further soldiers joining in. Gendarmería eventually broke up the fights and placed the perpetrators in custody but all help came too late for one of the sailors who died of his injuries 3 hours later in the hospital."
 argmil.13.a: "Troubling."

 argmil.20.t: "Lack of funding in the Army"
 argmil.20.d: "Recent government adjustments to the military budget have brought our Army spending down to dangerous levels. While this has greatly empowered the ARA and the development of new warships, officers from the Army have warned us that further pulling down the budget could have dangerous consequences on the prowess of our land forces and could open us up to foreign invasions."
 argmil.20.a: "Troubling."

 argmil.21.t: "Rampant Desertion in the Army"
 argmil.21.d: "Worsening living standards in the Barracks and lowered wages of our soldiers have caused many to abandon the armed forces and return to their families to support them in the wake of the economic crisis. Military Police and Gendarmería are tasked with tracking down the offenders but have as of now not been able to make a noticeable difference."
 argmil.21.a: "Troubling."

 argmil.22.t: "Lack of Military Steel"
 argmil.22.d: "New orders by the ARA have swallowed up all of our steel reserves and are putting orders for the land forces on the backburner. Tanks, planes and even machine guns have all been forced to lower their production to accommodate the lowered reserves and are making it hard for our army to stay up to date and fully equipped."
 argmil.22.a: "Troubling."

 argmil.23.t: "Lack of Skilled Officers"
 argmil.23.d: "Lowered wages and better prospects in the ARA have made many of our young potential officers turn away from the land forces and instead follow a career in the Navy. This brain-drain of new talent is weighing hard on the ageing corps and could potentially impact our capacity to lead our troops against the enemies."
 argmil.23.a: "Troubling."

 argmil.24.t: "Perón Introduces Alberte to the GOU"
 argmil.24.d: "In a general staff meeting at El Palomar military base, General Juan Domingo Perón has presented a new member of the GOU for the staff. His name is Bernardino Alberte, a junior officer that graduated recently from the Military Academy with outstanding grades. However, his lack of experience has not given the best impression to the older members of the staff, as well as the fact that Peron is seemingly trying to put people he trusts in positions of power. Despite this, Peron has reassured the Old Guard about his protege's skills, and being one of the most influential and experienced officers of the GOU and the General Staff, there's no real reason to reject Peron's request. After all, the army could always use more talented officers."
 argmil.24.a: "Let's hope this doesn't become a common occurrence."

 southern.4.t: "Intervention in the Argentine-Chilean war?"

 southern.4.a: "Attack!"
 southern.4.b: "We would rather not anger Argentina."

 southern.5.t: "Paraguay Invades!"
 southern.5.d: "The filthy Paraguayan dogs have smelled their chance and decided to invade us in the back to retake the Chaco Austral!"
 southern.5.a: "Jackals!"

 southern.6.t: "Intervention in the Argentine-Paraguayan war?"
 southern.6.d: "Argentina has kicked off the Argentine-Chilean war by invading the FOP rebels in Patagonia which was promptly followed by a declaration of war by the Paraguayans. Since they are aware that we hold claims on various territories of Paraguay and Chile, they have requested us to support them in the fight and be rewarded with our claims should our alliance win."
 southern.6.a: "Attack Paraguay!"
 southern.6.b: "We shall attack Paraguay AND Chile!"
 southern.6.c: "We seek no conflict."

 southern.7.t: "Bolivia Joins on Our side!"

 southern.8.a: "Most unfortunate!"

 #for ARG:
 southern.10.t: "Peace with Paraguay?"
 southern.10.d: "Yesterday our troops finally took Asunción and forced the Paraguayan surrenders to retreat, demoralised and broken. While they swear to continue the fight to the bitter end should they have to, they would not say no to lenient peace treaty. As much as it pains us, we could make a truce with them for now with no border changes - evan if the arrangement only exists for us to deal with the Syndicalist menace in the south. Make no mistake, it only buys them some time, nothing else."
 southern.10.a: "Yes, offer them peace."
 southern.10.b: "Yes, offer them peace, but demand reasonable reparations."
 southern.10.c: "Yes, offer them peace, but demand huge reparations."
 southern.10.e: "Never!"

 southern.14.t: "Paraguay Refused Our Terms"
 southern.14.d: "Paraguay has rejected our peace terms - the diplomacy failed, and the only remaining choice is to continue the war until they surrender."

 #for PAR:
 southern.11.t: "Peace with Argentina?"
 southern.11.d: "After Asunción fell to Argentinian hands, it became clear that they had won the field. While some in our government call for guerrilla war and dying fighting like López himself did, but they are in minority. After all, the Argentinian terms are very reasonable, and include no changes in borders nor any reparations. It would be easy to make peace without losing our face, having made peace without ceding the enemy anything in the end."
 southern.11.a: "Yes, we have lost."
 southern.11.b: "Paraguay shall never surrender!"

 southern.12.d: "After Asunción fell to Argentinian hands, it became clear that they had won the field. While some in our government call for guerrilla war and dying fighting like López himself did, but they are in minority. After all, the Argentinian terms are very reasonable, and include no changes in borders but they demand reparations and some military equipment as contribution. It would be fairly easy to make peace without losing our face."

 southern.13.d: "After Asunción fell to Argentinian hands, it became clear that they had won the field. While some in our government call for guerrilla war and dying fighting like López himself did. The Argentinian terms include no changes in borders but they demand heavy reparations and demilitarisation of our economy. The peace decision may be hard, but at least we will remain independent."

 southern.20.t: "Paraguay Occupies Argentina!"
 southern.20.d: "Despite what many had hoped, it seems that the war has not finished with the defeat of the reactionaries in Buenos Aires - defying all logic and expectations, the Paraguayans have extended a zone of control beyond their formal claims, and now occupy a large swath of Argentina. [PAR.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] has brazenly declared that the line they have drawn is necessary to establish a security zone against the 'blatantly hostile' Patagonian government, much to our exasperation - the only explanation is that they do not believe that their claims on Misiones and Chaco will be respected... or that [PAR.GetLeader] has gone mad and is trying to build some insane Paraguayan Empire.\n\nPredictably, many are now calling for war to liberate the occupied territories. Although Paraguay's formal claims only encompass a small portion of Argentina, the areas that [PAR.GetNameDef] now controls account for hundreds of thousands of people - too many to simply ignore. Although Paraguay has a reputation for standing up to nations supposedly much stronger than it, it is difficult to conceive that they could hold out against our forces while attempting to defend such a large area, and so the hawks have argued that an attack should be carried out as soon as possible. All we need to do is give the word."
 southern.20.a: "They cannot get away with this!"
 southern.20.b: "They are too strong to confront..."

 southern.21.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Prepares for War"
 southern.21.d: "Surprising few, it seems that our decision to retain control over much of Argentina is now leading to war. Following our declaration of a security zone around our area of occupation, the [FROM.GetAdjective] government has responded with outrage - already, the forces that were used against the Buenos Aires government are being mobilised against us, accompanied with a declaration that 'the Paraguayan Empire will be destroyed'.\n\nThe army is on high alert - the first campaign against Argentina was no simple affair, and the second one is not expected to be any easier."
 southern.21.a: "Brace yourselves..."

 southern.40.t: "Skirmishes on Argentine-Patagonian border"
 southern.40.d: "Our spies have reported that there have been a series of skirmishes between the Buenos Aires regime and Patagonian rebels recently. The frozen conflict is starting to heat up again, as both sides are gathering forces and trying to reinforce their respective borders. It appears that the Argentine government is preparing to deal with the rebellion, which will most certainly involve Patagonian ally, Chile. War is coming."

To combat this threat, they have proposed a pact of mutual support between our two nations, to bolster up our defences against the syndicalist war-mongers. This pact is also the stepping stone for any future cooperation, as some are suggesting proper military alliance between our two countries in the future."

 argfor.4.t: "Argentina Requests Assistance"
 argfor.4.d: "Locked in an inevitable confrontation with the FOP in Patagonia, Argentina is dedicated to purging the red threat from the continent as quickly as possible. To achieve this, they have come knocking on our door to ask for assistance in the fight as Chile is set to intervene on the behalf of the FOP. This gives us the opportunity to take back the coastline we so desire and put the Chilean people in their place. Frictions with Argentina, however, aren't fully resolved yet and the Yacuiba region could be used an argument should we no longer be an asset to Argentinian Expansion."

All that now stands against the red tide is the brave Papal garrison and their Italian ally. Thousands of young Argentine men, however, have expressed their support for the Pope and are leaving our shores to fight the evil abroad. The Government has not yet made a clear statement regarding the situation but has seen its hand forced if it wants to keep the furious masses under control."

For years we have upheld a policy of open immigration and have actively attracted foreigners.

Vicious struggles in Buenos Aires, Cordoba and various other cities throughout the nation are still going on but it looks like our government has once again fallen.

## Black Monday ##
 argbla.1.t: "Black Monday Hits the Nation"
 argbla.1.d: "When the German market opened this morning and the stocks suddenly started plummeting, our nation was one of the first to be hit by the wave. In response to the Berlin stock exchange, the Bolsa de Comercio de Buenos Aires collapsed as well causing even more trouble for Carlés who is barely holding on to power."
 argbla.1.a: "Argentina is thrown into a spiral of bad luck!"

 argbla.2.t: "Closure of the Bolsa de Comercio?"
 argbla.2.d: "With stocks continuing to plummet and investors all around the nation panicking, we could close the stock exchange and demand the banks to refuse to pay out desperate citizens. This will buy us some more time to fix the disaster while we are focusing on political affairs. However, the population will surely not be appreciate this..."
 argbla.2.a: "Close it!"
 argbla.2.b: "The free market will fix this!"

 argbla.3.t: "Close the Currency Board?"
 argbla.3.d: "For most of our history, the currency board has tied the Peso to a gold standard where an organ called the Caja de Conversión was tasked with maintaining the value of our currency. With stocks plummeting and Germany taking decisive action to soften the blow, our exports have lost their competitive edge and are going to be struggling to compete with cheap Eastern European and domestic German products. Therefore, a proposal was offered to close the currency board and abandon the gold standard, letting the peso devalue and making our products therefore competitive again."
 argbla.3.a: "Close the board."
 argbla.3.b: "Keep the board open."

 argbla.31.t: "Exports Are Collapsing"
 argbla.31.d: "Due to increasing competition from Europe and other parts of the world, our products have completely lost their competitive edge on the German market causing thousands of our citizens to lose their jobs due to the bankruptcy of many of our major companies."
 argbla.31.a: "Try to soften the blow."

 argbla.4.t: "Peso Spirals Downwards"
 argbla.4.d: "With political insecurity in Argentina and massive economic troubles in the German Empire, the Peso keeps spiralling downwards forcing many of our old and powerful companies to close down and lay off thousands of workers. The government plans to intervene and save those without jobs by drafting them up, but in the meantime, the situation goes from bad to worse."
 argbla.4.a: "Strong intervention is a necessity!"

 argbla.5.t: "Unrest in Cordoba and Mendoza"
 argbla.5.d: "Caused by the economic recession and feeding off the political insecurity in our nation, thousands of jobless citizens in the industrial cities of Cordoba and Mendoza have flocked to the streets to demand the government to step in and fix the crisis. Since our control over these cities is still uncontested, local police forces loyal to the army are not intervening on our behalf in an attempt to fan the flames of resistance against the regime."
 argbla.5.a: "Send a strongly worded letter."

 argbla.6.t: "Revising Our Exports"
 argbla.6.d: "After the victory by the Central Powers in the Weltkrieg and the fading importance of the British Empire, Argentina slowly started adjusting itself to the new world order and increased its exports to Germany. This turned out to be the correct choice as 1925 brought with it the collapse of the British Empire and the trade network it had established. As Argentina's prime export partner and the supplier of much of our needed goods, the government was forced to start a large scale industrialisation programme leading to rising social tensions and a couple rough years.\n\nGerman investments and the increasing importance of our agricultural products turned the situation back around in the thirties, leading to an economic boom and the establishment of Argentina as an economic powerhouse on the continent. The crash of the German market however and the return of protectionism to the nation, have catastrophically impacted our economy and severely hampered our exports. A new trade agreement will have to be signed so we can get a guarantee from the German Empire that they'll keep importing our goods."
 argbla.6.a: "Send the proposal."

 argbla.7.t: "Argentinian Trade Delegation"
 argbla.7.d: "As one of our largest import partners, the struggling republic of Argentina has reached out to our trade ministry begging us to make an exception on the increased tariffs we imposed on non-Mitteleuropan nations. Since their economy is virtually entirely dependent on us, we could put the squeeze on them and try to force them into signing a less favourable agreement.\n\nShould they, however, take this opportunity to shift their interests to the Entente, it would cut us off from their vital agricultural exports which could give our rivals in the Entente an advantage in the Americas."
 argbla.7.a: "We need their loyalty!"
 argbla.7.b: "What's a few extra Marks between friends?"

 argbla.71.t: "Germany Agrees to Our Terms"
 argbla.71.d: "Whether it is out of benevolence or a desire to expand their influence on the South American continent, Germany has eagerly agreed to our terms and made an exception for Argentinian products in their Black Monday trade arrangements."
 argbla.71.a: "We are grateful."

 argbla.72.t: "Germany Imposes Harsher Terms"
 argbla.72.d: "Aware of our fragile situation and not willing to drag their own recovery down to assist us, the German trade ministry has demanded we lower the prices of our processed meat exports or face consequences by receiving higher prices on steel, tools and consumer goods.\n\nWe are, however, not obliged to follow these demands and could perhaps strike a deal with the Entente to reduce our dependence on Germany, although the Islas Malvinas issue has not fully been resolved yet and could prove to be a British bargaining chip."
 argbla.72.a: "We have no choice but to accept."
 argbla.72.b: "Maybe there is an alternative solution..."

 argbla.73.t: "Argentina Comes to Bargain"
 argbla.73.d: "Severely hit by Black Monday and forced by Germany to swallow a tough pill to save their economy, the Argentine government has come to us to strike a new trade agreement. Their vast agrarian exports have made them a key player on the global market and years of industrialisation after the fall of our empire have successfully turned them into a valuable asset for our trade network and possibly alliance.\n\nHowever, there's the question of the Falkland Islands, which Argentina is currently occupying with our consent, since the lost of Ascension following the events of 1925 made supplyng the Falklands impossible. With our position now more secure, some consider we should demand an end to their presence on the islands. Restoring our rule in what some see as a key part of the empire would undoubtly be a popular move, but could risk an end to possible trade relations with Argentina."
 argbla.73.a: "We can use all the help we can get."
 argbla.73.b: "Let's demand they return the islands!"

 argbla.74.t: "Canada Accepts Our Proposal"
 argbla.74.d: "Whether it is out of benevolence or a desire to expand their influence on the South American continent, Canada has eagerly agreed to our terms and made an exception for Argentinian products in their trade arrangements, giving us access to a worldwide market of opportunity."
 argbla.74.a: "We are grateful."

 argbla.75.t: "Canada Demands the Falkland Islands Back"
 argbla.75.d: "While Canada would be willing to revise their broken treaties with us after the 1925 debacle, they have one simple demand before agreeing to discuss possible trade arrangements: The Islas Malvinas have to be returned to British control at once or there will be no possible deal, now or in the future. Not only are the islands an important naval facility in our fight against the FOP, returning the islands would cause massive outrage on the home front which we don't need with the already fragile state of our regime.\n\nInhabitants of the Islands have not been asked whose side they are on but it goes without saying that they have full faith in our capacity to make the right decision."
 argbla.75.a: "On second thought, the Germans weren't so bad..."
 argbla.75.b: "Who cares about some sheep rocks anyway?"

 argbla.76.t: "Argentina Accepts Our Demands!"
 argbla.76.d: "Realising that they have no other choice but to bow to our demands, the Argentinian government has officially signed the new trade agreement granting us even more influence in their nation and improved relations with their trade board. Our steel, consumer goods and other modern appliances will be imported at high prices while we cheaply import their canned food."
 argbla.76.a: "A great deal."

 argbla.8.t: "Introduction of the Empréstito Patriótico"
 argbla.8.d: "As our recovery attempts have only proven mildly successful and the economy is still failing, the government has announced the 'empréstito patriótico' or patriotic loan to strengthen the coffers. The first of these new tariffs is to be imposed on gasoline with the profits being directed to the Dirección Nacional de Vialidad, or the National Office of Public Highways."
 argbla.8.a: "The proposal goes into effect!"
 argbla.8.b: "We can't force our people to cough up even more money!"

 argbla.9.t: "Creation of La Junta Nacional de Granos"
 argbla.9.d: "Operating as our National Grain Board, the JNG will buy wheat, flax and corn from our struggling farmers for prices established by our government. Through this panel, we can secure a fair price for our farmers while backing them up when we are again hit by a recession using the means of the Exchange Fund of the Banco de la Nación.\n\nSome in the government, however, would prefer expanding the panel drastically and also secure prices for Industrial and all Agrarian goods. Liberals, however, see this as a direct attack on the Free Market and are urging the government to stop with these policies before it is too late."
 argbla.9.a: "The Board will regulate all goods!"
 argbla.9.b: "Only Agrarian products will be dealt with."
 argbla.9.c: "Block the Proposal!"

 argbla.10.t: "Stabilisation in the Countryside"
 argbla.10.d: "Due to our decisive actions in the early days of the recession and primarily due to the successes of the JNG, a large portion of our farmers has been able to escape from bankruptcy. Now that trade is once again increasing, our farms are in excellent shape, and large shipments of food are already being sent to Canada and the German Empire."
 argbla.10.a: "Very well."
 argbla.10.b: "Very well."

 argbla.11.t: "La Viña Dam Construction Project"
 argbla.11.d: "To further boost Cordoba's industrialisation process, the local administration has proposed the construction of a large hydro-electric installation to not only power the region's evolving industry but also to provide irrigation for thousands of acres of agricultural land, the province's main economic engine. Construction is expected to take at least 5 years, but with appropriate government support, this might be greatly reduced, but at an additional expense."
 argbla.11.a: "Allocate finances - this should pay off in the long run."
 argbla.11.b: "We can't spare the resources."

 argbla.12.t: "Escuela de Aviación Militar de Argentina Opening"
 argbla.12.d: "Founded on August 10, 1912, under the administration of Roque Sáenz Peña, the Military Aviation School was created to accommodate the rising importance of aviation and to train and subsidise Argentina's first generation of pilots. Due to the ever-increasing importance of aviation and its introduction in military warfare during the Weltkrieg, expansions were agreed upon in 1934 to build a new headquarters for our aeronautical school. Located on the outskirts of Cordoba, the school is destined to educate the next generation of pilots and give us an edge over our neighbours."
 argbla.12.a: "[Root.GetLeader] has opened the academy!"

## 1936 Carles ##

 argcar.2.t: "Clashes at the Colegio Militar de la Nación"
 argcar.2.d: "As one of the last strongholds in the greater Buenos Aires region, the Colegio Militar de la Nación was occupied by loyalist members of the military who had barricaded themselves inside the compound awaiting reinforcements from the interior. In response to this last-ditch effort, soldiers of the ARA were sent in to try and push them out. While small clashes occurred throughout the compound, the Army surrendered a week later when their basic utilities and will to hold out had started to fade.\n\nAmongst the captured were a few notable Army commanders but it seems that the majority of the staff had fled the city during the first days of the Coup. This victory may be insignificant in the greater picture but we now firmly control the entirety of Buenos Aires."
 argcar.2.a: "Incarcerate the officers."
 argcar.2.b: "Execute the dissidents."

 argcar.3.t: "Fight for the Estación Retiro"
 argcar.3.d: "As the primary railway hub of our nation, the city of Buenos Aires plays a key role in connecting the vast swathes of land of our country. Most of the Northern railroads, however, pass through Rosario, which has not yet declared its allegiance to Carlés and may prove a thorn in our side during the Northern campaign. Our troops are currently finishing up the loyalist remnants in the Estación Retiro in Buenos Aires but we will have to decide whether we have the ARA secure the coastline and its populous cities or the Rosario hub first."
 argcar.3.a: "Push towards Rosario."
 argcar.3.b: "Send the ARA to Mar del Plata."

 argcar.4.t: "Gendarmería Nacional Argentina"
 argcar.4.d: "With questionable support from the army and the limited manpower of the ARA, a debate has arisen about the capabilities of our internal strike force. According to the Argentine Constitution, the armed forces can technically not intervene in internal civil conflicts, so the Gendarmerie would be created as an organ subordinate to the Defence Ministry and thus the Carlés cabinet. It would be defined as a civilian "security force of a military nature" and maintain a functional relationship with the Ministry of Defence, as part of both the National Defence System and the Interior Security System. It would, therefore, maintain capabilities arising from the demands required by joint military planning with the armed forces and would legally be able to intervene in the current crisis.\n\nOur funds are, however, limited at this time and the loyalty of the new recruits would be questionable at best which has made Carlés reconsider the proposal to avoid the possibility of a counter-coup from within his own ranks."
 argcar.4.a: "Found the GNA."
 argcar.4.b: "We can deal with the situation on our own."

 argcar.5.t: "Intervention in the Judiciary branch"
 argcar.5.d: "During the early years of the twentieth century, our nation started to slowly move away from the old authoritarian systems towards a more open and democratic system by changes to the constitution and the implementation of checks and balances. The subsequent separatism in Patagonia, the continued corruption in government and the shady dealings of the conservative ruling party, however, have stumped our progress and kept the old system alive and striving. Not only has this led to great disgruntlement amongst the people, it has also created a hotbed for Carlés supporters who claim the High Court is obstructing "popular will".\n\nWith Carlés and his supporters now in control of the High Court, it has given him the perfect opportunity to strike the defunct system by relieving all 5 members of the Court from their duties and to replace them by his "men of the people". We can, however, further push our narrative and start replacing the lower courts as well with our followers, although this might backfire greatly should the people turn sides."
 argcar.5.a: "The old system is outdated and corrupt!"
 argcar.5.b: "Only replace the High Court."

 argcar.50.t: "Question of Civil Rights"
 argcar.50.d: "Many of our supporters are convinced that we aren't rooting out the old guard efficiently enough and have pushed for a temporary restriction on the constitutional rights of our citizens. This proposal is of course not going to be well accepted by the majority of the population but could guarantee a safer homefront and avoid political or civilian opposition."
 argcar.50.a: "All Argentines must serve the state in these times."
 argcar.50.b: "The constitution grants rights that cannot be taken."

 argcar.51.t: "Protests in Buenos Aires"
 argcar.51.d: "As a reaction to our decision to temporarily lift the constitution to pursue the dissenters, thousands of our citizens have flocked to the Plaza de Mayo in Buenos Aires to protest against these changes and proclaim their support for the old government. While this doesn't come as a surprise, we hadn't expected the protests to rise up this quickly. This puts a serious dent in the plans to secure the Argentinian hinterland and could potentially buy the conservative forces the time they need to form an organised opposition."
 argcar.51.a: "Send in the Gendarmería."
 argcar.51.b: "Station the reserves in Buenos Aires."

 argcar.52.t: "Escalation in Buenos Aires"
 argcar.52.d: "The protests in the capital suddenly turned violent when the armed forces were sent in with stones being thrown at our riot forces. An unskilled rookie opened fire on the protestors in response causing the whole situation to explode in a bloody mess where dozens of civilians were shot in an effort to control the crowd. The hard crackdown inevitably led to the dispersion of the crowds and dozens of arrests but has shown the weakness of the Carlés regime in quelling these protests."
 argcar.52.a: "A dark day for Argentina."

 argcar.6.t: "Cordoba and Rosario Denounce the Carlés Regime"
 argcar.6.d: "Strongly influenced by the army and the remnants of socialists that haven't fled southwards, the cities of Cordoba and Rosario have declared the government in Buenos Aires incapable of ruling Argentina and have cut all ties with the capital region and urge the other states to follow suit. Conservative members of the Army have announced their support for the movement and are establishing defensive positions around Rosario to counter our forces."
 argcar.6.a: "Invoke Article 6."

 argcar.61.t: "Carlés Invokes Article 6"
 argcar.61.d: ""The Federal Government may intervene in the territory of the provinces in order to guarantee the republican form of government or to repel foreign invasions; and at the request of their constituted authorities, it may intervene to support or re-establish them, should they have been deposed by sedition or invasion from another province."\n\nBased on the rights granted to our government as outlined in Article 6 of the constitution, Carlés has declared the state of Cordoba incapable of ruling itself and traitors to the Argentine Republic. An intervention force shall be sent to the province to restore order and to arrest all contra revolutionaries that are refusing to accept rule from Buenos Aires."
 argcar.61.a: "Start the campaign."

 argcar.7.t: "Mendoza and Entre Rios Side with Cordoba"
 argcar.7.d: "Following the example of Cordoba, the states of Mendoza and Entre Rios have also denounced Carlés and taken the side of the military. While this is a devastating blow to our legitimacy and power in the outer provinces, the Army is still too disorganised to actively pursue us."
 argcar.7.a: "We must move quickly now."

 argcar.8.t: "Capture of Mar del Plata"
 argcar.8.d: "As the ARA approached the coastline of Mar del Plata and launched a warning salvo to deter any military presence in the city from fighting back, the city officially surrendered to admiral Videla at 12 am. The large city known for his beaches to the Argentine elite has experienced an economic boom these last few years and has now wisely decided to stay out of the conflict to prevent damage to its citizens or buildings."
 argcar.8.a: "Welcome in the new Argentina."

## Fall of Carles ##
 argcar.9.t: "Sabotage on the Rosario-Buenos Aires Railway"
 argcar.9.d: "Insurgents from the city of Rosario have sabotaged the railway connection to the capital in an effort to slow our forces down and buy them more time to organise against us. Especially the station of San Nicolas was hit hard and has caused much of our planned movements to become impossible to achieve. The fall of momentum in our movement and the rising threat of an organised military opposition to Carlés has forced us to reconsider other options. The Grupo de Oficiales Unidos holds vast control over the Army and has not yet chosen with whom to side with which could make them a valuable asset in our struggle. Convincing them will not be easy though as they are set to play an influential role in politics and might even directly interfere in our policies both abroad and on the home front."
 argcar.9.a: "The GOU sides with Carlés."
 argcar.9.b: "We can do this on our own!"

 argcar.93.t: "GOU Sides with the Old Guard"
 argcar.93.d: "Seeing the failures of our movement to swiftly establish control over the nation, the GOU has decided to support the conterrevolutionaries and oppose our regime. Reinforcements are already being deployed to Rosario and could put the advantage on the defenders side. This has however not stopped Carlés from continuing the campaign which is now fully under way to make Rosario an example to all that dare oppose him."
 argcar.93.a: "We need a decisive victory now!"

 argcar.94.t: "Confrontation in Rosario"
 argcar.94.d: "After a painful campaign through the countryside to reach the city, plagued by sabotage and insurgent opposition, the Carlés forces finally reached Rosario. Fully entrenched, well supplied and with strategic support from the GOU, the city was prepared against any offensive which was proven when the initial attempts to take the city were snuffed out quickly and efficiently. The Panzers that were brought in from Buenos Aires to support the assailants proved to be ineffective in the small streets of the city and skirmishes in the Villa Diego and Saladillo quickly became disasters for the attackers. By the end of the 10-day struggle for the city, supplies and morale of the Carlés forces ran out and the commanding officer formally surrendered to the GOU effectively ending the fight for Rosario and by extension the campaign to pacify the hinterlands."
 argcar.94.a: "The House of Cards is tumbling down."

 argcar.95.t: "Fall of Buenos Aires"
 argcar.95.d: "With the majority of the armed supporters of Carlés defeated and captured after the disastrous Rosario campaign, the Army and GOU forces shifted their focus to a quick knock-out of the capital to depose Carlés and re-secure Argentina. Thousands of troops loyal to the Army were sent to the capital where the limited forces of Carlés proved to be no match for their superior counterparts. Last spots of resistance throughout the city still roar but the great leader has already taken his life to avoid capture and punishment for his deeds."
 argcar.95.a: "Carlés is dead! Long live Argentina!"

 argcar.96.t: "The ARA Surrenders to Pedro Pablo Ramírez"
 argcar.96.d: "Unable to continue the fight on their own and with little control over the remainder of the land that was pacified in the early days of the Christmas Coup, Eleazar Videla formally surrendered to the Army at 12 am in the Escuela Superior de Mecánica de la Armada. With the signature of both parties, the internal conflict has effectively ended. Pedro Pablo Ramírez has taken up the task to rebuild the nation and has declared elections to be held in September to decide the future of Argentina."
 argcar.96.a: "En unión y libertad!"

## Carles victorious in Rosario ##
 argcar.10.t: "Victory in San Nicolas"
 argcar.10.d: "Quick and decisive strikes to capture the railroads around Buenos Aires have been greatly successful and we now control the road towards Rosario and other inland cities. Troops are being sent by train to Rosario to quell the revolt and are expected to arrive there before the Army has a chance to prepare its defences, giving us the opportunity to take the populous city."
 argcar.10.a: "Onwards we go!"

 argcar.11.t: "Fall of Rosario"
 argcar.11.d: "Surprised by the quick reaction of our troops and ill-prepared to take on our forces, the city fell after only small skirmishes in the centre of the city. While not much of the rebel leadership was captured in the attack, the moral implications of the victory are great, prompting Mar Del Plata and Concordia to immediately surrender to the central government. They also fear retaliation should they side with the rebels. Material damage to the city is fairly limited due to the excellent reaction of our troops but the important railway hub that we hoped to capture was bombed just before our arrival to prevent us from quickly taking the other cities."
 argcar.11.a: "A great victory for the nation."

 argcar.12.t: "The Carlés Cabinet"
 argcar.12.d: "To confirm his victory in securing the nation, Manuel Carlés has announced his cabinet picks this morning in Buenos Aires. As his minister of Foreign Affairs, he has chosen the infamous Estanislao Zeballos whose literary works have had a profound impact on our nation and whose loyalty to the LP goes without question. Diego Isidro Masón has been chosen to serve as minister of economic affairs due to his close ties with the rest of the armed forces and to personally oversee the rapid militarisation of the Argentinian war machine. As the minister of Interior Affairs, Carlés has chosen another military man in the form of Elbio Anaya who has played an important role in the first days of the Patagonia rebellion but was unable to complete his task due to the failures of his superior Colonel Héctor Benigno Varela."
 argcar.12.a: "Argentina marches onwards!"

 argcar.13.t: "Purge Loyalist Opposition"
 argcar.13.d: "As our grasp on the nation becomes stronger by the day, there are still those who see our regime as an offence to Argentinian democracy and Argentinian values, and who plot in the shadows to overthrow us. Punitive actions and propaganda against these traitors should bring the population back in line and quell any possible resistance."
 argcar.13.a: "Limit the purges - they are not important enough to waste resources on them"
 argcar.13.b: "No mercy."

 argcar.14.t: "Eradicate Socialist Remnants"
 argcar.14.d: "Even though almost all socialist sympathisers fled south after the FOP proclaimed its independence, some have remained amongst us, waiting for the time to backstab us and finish what the FOP started, giving us the perfect excuse to eradicate dissidents amongst the opposition with national security in mind."
 argcar.14.a: "Limit the purges - they are not important enough to waste resources on them."
 argcar.14.b: "No mercy."

## GOU sides with Carlés ##
 argcar.20.t: "Fall of Rosario"
 argcar.20.d: "With a deal struck between Carlés and the GOU, the latter has committed troops to our Rosario campaign and has even commanded the troops loyal to them to stand down in Rosario and turn on their comrades in the Army. Attacked both by the Panzers brought in from Buenos Aires and the traitors from within, the city could not stand up to the combined forces and surrendered formally to Pedro Pablo Ramírez, head of the GOU, this evening."
 argcar.20.a: "A great victory for the nation."

 argcar.21.t: "GOU Calls Carlés to Order"
 argcar.21.d: "Even though victory has been secured over Chile and the rebels in Patagonia have been crushed, Carlés is still not satisfied with the territorial expansion of our nation and further campaigns into Uruguay, Brazil and Bolivia are all being drawn up and sent to the army. Being allied to Carlés during the early days of his regime, the GOU has politely requested Carlés to tone down his recklessness before he drags Argentina down with him. Controlling vast parts of our armed forces, we cannot risk angering the GOU as they could lift us from power just as easily as they helped us seize it so we will either have to bow to their request and stop with the campaign or take the radical approach of removing the organisation from power with force."
 argcar.21.a: "We should temper our enthusiasm."
 argcar.21.b: "Secretly start preparing their demise."

 argcar.22.t: "Coup of [GetYear]"
 argcar.22.d: "Unforeseen by Carlés, this morning he was awoken by the marching boots of 8000 Argentine soldiers who had gathered on the Plaza de Mayo. Organised by members of the GOU, General Ramírez took up the lead of the coup, quickly organising their forces to seize key locations in the city before Carlés could react. With the majority of the loyalist soldiers on the borders planning the next offensive, little to no troops were left in the Buenos Aires region leading to a quick and decisive strike on government facilities. Upon arriving at the Navy Petty-Officers School of Mechanics in the neighbourhood of Núñez, the group was attacked by loyal forces who were entrenched there, resulting in the death of 30 and the wounding of 100 but ultimately the surrender of the ARA forces.\n\nHaving surrendered the Navy School of Mechanics, the remaining Argentine generals received the rebel leaders and declared Ramírez president of the Republic by noon. Carlés, while able to escape the rebel troops, boarded a small fishing trawler and set off to Peru in the hopes of finding an ally in their regime."
 argcar.22.a: "Long live President Ramírez!"

 argcar.23.t: "Carlés Arrives in Peru"
 argcar.23.d: "Successfully arriving in Peru after he was ousted only last week, Carlés has been able to secure temporary asylum in the nation whilst Peru decides on an official response. While his trial is being prepared in Buenos Aires, President Ramírez has officially requested his extradition from Peru. Accused of High Treason, corruption and other crimes against the Argentine State, it is fairly clear that his extradition would lead to an immediate incarceration and the end of his political career."
 argcar.23.a: "Request his extradition from the Peruvian embassy."

 argcar.24.t: "Argentina Demands the Extradition of Carlés"
 argcar.24.d: "During the successful Coup in Argentina last week, Carlés was forced to flee the nation and has requested asylum from us. While we have temporarily granted his request while we await the return of stability to Argentina, President Ramírez has now demanded his immediate extradition so he can be persecuted for his crimes. Carlés has always been a strong ally of our Peruvian government and it is as of now still unclear whether Ramírez will follow the same foreign policy although sending Carlés back could secure good relations with the new regime."
 argcar.24.a: "Send him back!"
 #diplomatic incident, diplomats being forced to leave etc:
 argcar.24.b: "Carlés is our ally!"

 argcar.25.t: "Peru Extradites Carlés"
 argcar.25.d: "Fearing possible diplomatic retaliation from Argentina, the Peruvian government has accepted our demand and put Carlés in custody and ready to be transferred back to Buenos Aires where his trial will commence shortly. While his persecution will not be the last of our troubles dealing with his supporters, it will send a clear message to those that still remain in both the army and government institutions."
 argcar.25.a: "The Trial starts in 2 months."

 argcar.26.t: "Peru Refuses Our Demand"
 argcar.26.d: "Unwilling to comply with our demands to extradite Carlés, the Peruvian government has decided to grant him full political asylum. Ramírez has answered with the forced expulsion of Peruvian diplomats from Buenos Aires and has threatened Peru with economic sanctions should they not comply with our demands. Many experts believe that Peru will cave into this response quickly based on the built-up Chilean war friendship and the reliance on Argentinian exports but others see this as a chance for Peru to prove that it can stand on its own against foreign aggression."
 #some decisions to do a little economic war:
 argcar.26.a: "Prepare further sanctions."

 argcar.48.t: "The Liborio Justo Trial"
 argcar.48.d: "As the trials against the treacherous revolutionaries are being carried out, a stand out case has been picked up by the press and is spreading through the nation like wildfire. Liborio Justo, son of the General and Chief of Staff Agustin P. Justo, had fled to the Frente Obrero Patagonico in 1930, taking with him many military manuals from El Palomar, and helping make the FOP's military stronger. Accused of treason, some judges had suggested the death penalty and that's where General Agustin P. Justo decided to intervene. Arguing against the execution, Justo is coming off to the public as a voice of reason, criticising the government for being overly harsh and potentially inspiring yet another uprising. While passing the guilty sentence is still on the table, many on the cabinet are well aware of Agustin P. Justo's deep connections into both the Army and the UCRA, and advise us to treat the matter with precaution."
 argcar.48.a: "We Won't Risk Dare the Old Marshall's Wrath"
 argcar.48.b: "He Doesn't Scare Us, Force a Guilty Sentence!"

## Ramirez rules Argentina ##
 argcar.30.t: "Further Security Measures on the Uruguay Border"
 argcar.30.d: "Following the ascension of Ramírez to the presidency and the increased persecution of union members and Liga Patriótica sympathisers, hundreds of our citizens have crossed the Uruguayan border in an attempt to flee justice. The government has decreed extra reinforcements to the border guard and has deployed further divisions of the Gendarmería to assist while patrol boats of the Prefectura are sailing in front of the Uruguayan coast to pick up any refugee ships."
 argcar.30.a: "No one shall escape Justice!"

 argcar.31.t: "Crackdown on the FOIC"
 argcar.31.d: "The Federación Obrera de la Industria de la Carne or Meat Industry Workers Federation has been banned by presidential decree this morning leading to the closure of the FOIC offices in Berrios and Avellaneda and the subsequent arrest of the leadership, most notably Secretary General José Peter.\n\nThe organisation has been closely linked to syndicalist cells in our nation but were mostly unharmed by the previous administration after previous strikes organised by them led to a dangerous economic crisis in the meat packing industry. An organised reaction against this move and strikes across the nation are to be expected but are necessary to avoid the red menace from taking control."
 argcar.31.a: "We can not let syndicalism overtake our nation!"

 argcar.32.t: "Dissolution of the CGT"
 argcar.32.d: "Following the persecution of the FOIC, the Confederación General del Trabajo de la República Argentina or General Confederation of Labour of the Argentine Republic has now also been dissolved by Ramírez in his pledge to eradicate all socialist elements in the nation and remove the basis of organised resistance. Centred mostly around the railroads and having experienced a split due to the conflict in the FOP, the CGT has slowly started to establish itself as the largest union of our nation.\n\nWith their dissolution, the socialists once again lose an important pillar of their power. The more than 100.000 members of the organisation though are sure to organise resistance and with the already rising tensions between the unions and the government due to the Black Monday disaster, this move could be very dangerous to the stability of our nation."
 argcar.32.a: "Push for further regularisation of the unions."

 argcar.33.t: "The Government Takes over the Littoral"
 argcar.33.d: "In line with the political agenda of Ramírez, the management of education has been handed over to the right-wing Hispanic-Catholic nationalists. By a decisive action by the government, the National University of the Littoral was seized and Jordán Bruno Genta instated as its supervisor. Genta, known for his far-right and anti-reformist ideas, maintains that the country needs to create "an intelligent aristocracy, nourished by Roman and Hispanic lineage" to lead the nation to greatness.\n\nThe University Federation of the Littoral responded vehemently against the appointment of Genta calling it a violation of the 1918 university act which guaranteed governing autonomy and academic freedom. Government forces immediately responded to these accusations by detaining its secretary general and expelling students and professors who protested in opposition."
 argcar.33.a: "All institutions must be controlled."

 argcar.34.t: "General Strike!"
 argcar.34.d: "Organised by FOIC cadres after mass meetings in Rosario, Avellaneda and Berrios, a strike petition was issued calling for the liberation of Peter and the demand for 30 hours of guaranteed work a week. The management of the meat industry refused these terms and in response, a general strike was called throughout the nation paralysing the vital sector. Gendarmería had been sent in to quell the strikers and force them back to work but clashes between government forces and protestors quickly escalated, leading to hard oppression by the police forces and the arrest of dozens of strikers.\n\nPersonal intervention however by Perón has made the Unions and management come to a fragile agreement followed by the release of Peter to calm the masses down. Part of these negotiations, however, led to the new Autonomous Butcher's Union of Berisso and Ensenada, in open opposition to the FOIC."
 argcar.34.a: "This Colonel seems to know what he's doing."

 argcar.35.t: "Second FOIC Crackdown"
 argcar.35.d: "Due to reinvigorated issues between the management and the union concerning meeting the new economic demands, negotiations once again broke down which has prompted us to immediately seize the offices of the FOIC again and the further arrest of key FOIC figures amongst whom Peter who was just released. With this action, the Union has been near completely destroyed. Lack of funds, the loss of their leadership and the planned deportation of their leader Peter have made the organisation dissolve giving room to new unions, preferably ours, to expand and take their territory."
 argcar.35.a: "Slowly but surely our grasp becomes more secure."

 argcar.36.t: "Ramírez Takes over the Railway Unions"
 argcar.36.d: "Even though the Unions have been legalised now by Ramírez, a clause was included which lets the government take over any union at will. The powerful railroad union, which formed the foundation of the CGT was the first to fall under this new policy and has been placed under direct government control. A so-called "inventor" has been placed in the organisation as the supervisor but is more a direct extension of the government than an independent agent.\n\nStrikes against this move almost immediately followed but were put down hard by the Gendarmería who have arrested dozens more influential socialist leaders. The Unions, however, have started to change direction sensing that the new government is heavily anti-union and therefore a group under Ángel Borlenghi has approached Colonel Domingo Mercante to sit down and come to a peaceful resolution."
 argcar.36.a: "Mercante accepts the offer."

 argcar.37.t: "Mercante and the Unions reach an accord"
 argcar.37.d: "Represented by Ángel Borlenghi, Francisco Pablo Capozzi and Juan Atilio Bramuglia, the Unions opted, albeit with reservations and distrust, to establish relations with a sector of the military government more inclined to accept union demands, with the aim of forming an alliance capable of influencing the course of events. To achieve initial contact with the military they chose Colonel Domingo Mercante, the son of an important railroad union leader and member of the GOU, to represent the government and hopefully persuade him to listen to the Unions. In turn, Mercante summoned his political partner and close friend, Juan Perón, a colonel and member of the GOU.\n\nWhile the negotiations were tough, the proposal of the Unions that the military created a Secretariat of Labour, strengthen a now loyal CGT and sanction a series of labour laws that would accept the historical claims of the Argentinian labour movement was positively received by the colonels. They, however, demanded the immediate release of Peter, who was imprisoned earlier this year when the army rolled up the FOIC."
 argcar.37.a: "Finally something we can work with."

 argcar.38.t: "Secretary of Labour Perón"
 argcar.38.d: "After his success to broker a deal between the unions and the military government, Perón was granted the office of Head of the Department of Labour. A completely empty position with no power, we hoped this would keep the ambitious colonel busy and blocked from any further rise in politics. He however successfully fulfilled the office and even gave it a new meaning by approving the labour laws that had been claimed historically by the Argentinian labour movement (extending the severance indemnity that existed since 1934 for commerce employees, pensions for commerce employees, a multi-clinic hospital for railway workers, technical schools for workers, the prohibition of employment agencies, the creation of the labour courts, Christmas bonuses), lending efficacy to the existing labour inspectors and impelling for the first time collective bargaining, which grew to become the basic way of regulating the relationship between capital and labour. Moreover, he forced us to drop the decree regarding unions associations sanctioned by president Ramírez in the first weeks of the revolution, which was criticised by the entire labour movement.\n\nIn addition, Perón, Mercante, and the initial group of unionists who formed the alliance began to organise a new union that would assume a nationalist-labour identity. The group assumed an anti-syndicalist position already existing in parts of the old CGT and, relying on the power of the Secretary of Labour, organised new unions in the industries which lacked them (chemicals, electricity, tobacco) and set up rival unions in industries with powerful old and hostile to the government, unions (meat, construction, textiles, metallurgy)."
 argcar.38.a: "What is this "Peronism." people are talking about?"

 argcar.39.t: "Ramírez Debates European Intervention"
 argcar.39.d: "Pressure from Germany is increasing by the day forcing us to take a stand in the Weltkrieg and join Germany in the fight against the syndicalists. While a portion of our military agrees with foreign intervention in favour of our de facto ally, the German Empire, others like Peron are in favour of staying neutral and focus on solving the internal issues before attempting any military adventures."
 argcar.39.a: "Germany needs our assistance."
 argcar.39.b: "We have to remain neutral."

 argcar.40.t: "GOU Pressures Ramírez to not Intervene"
 argcar.40.d: "Unwilling to join the war and risk a possible renewed friction with Entente relations, the GOU who had sworn to support the president at all times has dissolved... and the next day recreated without the oath to pressure Ramirez in remaining neutral or risk being forced to resign. Ramírez, unwilling to back down now and risk the anger of German diplomats has not yet taken a decision but must do so quickly if he wishes to remain in power. His own vice-president, Edelmiro Farrell has expressed his desire to stay neutral and could provide a thorn in our side, should we join the Germans in their war."
 argcar.40.a: "Give in to the new GOU."
 argcar.40.b: "Demand the resignation of Farrell."

 argcar.400.t: "Farrell Takes Over the Office"
 argcar.400.d: "Pressured by the members of the now dissolved GOU, Ramírez was forced to resign from office and has allowed Farrell to take office. Farrell has responded by immediately making Peron his vice-president and continuing the social and economic reforms pressed by him. Whether this crack in the military dictatorship will prove to be fatal in the end is yet to be seen but it has proven that stability is yet far from secure."
 argcar.400.a: "Long Live President Farrell!"

 argcar.41.t: "Farrell Refuses to Stand Down"
 argcar.41.d: "In response to Ramirez's demand for his resignation, Farrell has instead tasked the garrison chiefs of Buenos Aires with surrounding the presidential residence and demanding the resignation of Ramirez. Lieutenant-Colonel Tomas Adolfo Duco, convinced that the remaining generals intended to try and launch a coup in support of Ramirez, has called upon the Strategic Infantry Regiment 3 and directed them to the city of Lomas de Zamora, where they have taken key buildings and positions and entrenched themselves in order to pressure Ramirez."
 argcar.41.a: "General Eduardo Ávalos frees Ramírez."
 argcar.41.b: "Ramírez resigns."

 argcar.42.t: "Middle Class Protests against Farrell"
 argcar.42.d: "Disgusted by the reforms pushed through by Farrell and his new Vice President Peron, the largest protest march in the history of Argentina was held today. The March for Freedom and the Constitution, which marched from Congress to the Recoleta neighbourhood in Buenos Aires consisted of over 200.000 opponents of the Farrell/Peron duo, mostly members of the middle and upper class who were discontented with the rise of the new working class through the so-called Peronist reforms.\n\nFor the first time, however, multiple sides of the social and political spectrum united with a common purpose and marched for the reinstatement of democracy and the abolition of the military dictatorship. A heavy blow to the legitimacy of Farrell, many fear that the slumbering military cells opposed to the new direction of the government could wake up and attempt to overthrow the president."
 argcar.42.a: "Will the government fall yet again?"

 argcar.43.t: "General Eduardo Ávalos Arrests Peron"
 argcar.43.d: "Reinvigorated by the nationwide opposition to Farrell/Peron, the General has defeated the Peronist forces and imprisoned Peron. The Colonel and Vice-President have been relocated to Martín García Island, located in the Río de la Plata while the opposition organises itself. Talks to hold free elections are being held while some of the military members are convinced that the military dictatorship is here to stay and that democracy cannot work in Argentina."
 argcar.43.a: "The opposition stalls."
 argcar.43.b: "A governing accord is reached."
 #NEEDS AN ARGENTINA COUNCIL PORTRAIT

 argcar.44.t: "The Opposition Falls Apart"
 argcar.44.d: "Just one week later, the nation was shaken up by one of the strangest yet influential events in Argentinian history. An unfamiliar social class, which had remained completely absent from Argentinian history until then, burst into Buenos Aires and demanded Perón's freedom. The city was taken by tens of thousands of workers from the industrial areas that had been growing on the outskirts of the city. The crowd set itself up in the Plaza de Mayo and refused to leave until their demands were met. It was characterised by the large number of young people and especially women who were part of it, and by the predominance of people with hair and skin darker than those who attended the traditional political acts of the time. The anti-Peronist opposition stressed these differences, referring to them in derogatory terms such as "blacks", "fat people", " descamisados (shirtless)", "cabecitas negras". It was the Radical Unionist leader Sammartino who even went so far as to call the event a "zoo flood".\n\nThe protestors were accompanied by a whole new generation of young people and new union delegates belonging to the unions of the CGT, which had responded to a sugar workers' strike two days earlier. It was a completely peaceful demonstration, but the political and cultural upheaval was of such heft that, in a few hours, the triumph of the anti-Peronist movement had been cancelled out, as did the remaining power of the military government.\n\nAfter intense negotiations, the radical Armando Antille distinguished himself as Perón's delegate leading to his liberation. That same night Peron addressed his sympathisers from a balcony at the Casa Rosada and praised their dedication and patriotism."
 argcar.44.a: "Elections are scheduled to occur in two months!"

 argcar.45.t: "[GetYear] Elections in the Argentine Republic"
 argcar.45.d: "After the massive strikes, protests and the tumultuous incarceration of Peron, election day is finally here. Peron together with his allies in the Unions has organised himself in three new parties to oppose the democratic alliance. Arturo Frondizi, Roberto Ortiz, Ricardo Balbin and Alicia Moreau de Justo have all united against Peron but are still trying to claim the precious presidency for themselves. Small clashes between Peronists and anti-Peronists occurred outside of the voting booths but were quickly suppressed by the police who were tasked with keeping the elections a free process for all."
 argcar.45.a: "Peron becomes president."
 argcar.45.b: "Elpidio Gonzalez becomes president."
 argcar.45.c: "Jose Pascual Tamborini becomes president."

 argcar.45.f: "Alicia Moreau de Justo becomes president."

 argcar.46.t: "[GetYear] Elections in the Argentine Republic"
 argcar.46.d: "With the power of the Peronists mostly broken and Peron himself rotting away on his island prison, the elections went ahead without the representation of his movement. Multiple candidates have thrown their hats in the ring and it is set to be a close election."
 argcar.46.a: "Arturo Frondizi becomes president."
 argcar.46.b: "Jose P. Tamborini becomes president."
 argcar.46.c: "Robustiano P. Costas becomes president."
 argcar.46.e: "Alicia Moreau de Justo becomes president."

 argcar.47.t: "Death of Manuel Carlés!"
 argcar.47.d: "As our Grand Saviour grew older by the day, many inside our government were awaiting the day he finally passed away. Today is this day as the Saviour of Argentina and conqueror of South America has left out his final breath. With no clear successor to secede him and unclarity whether it should be handled within the party or whether elections should be written out, the Council of Buenos Aires has temporarily taken over power. Consisting of many of Carlés' closest associates and the LP inner-party, they will rule the nation with an iron fist until a decision has been made."
 argcar.47.a: "We weep for his loss."

## Road to Democracy ##
 argdem.1.t: "Violence in the Streets"
 argdem.1.d: "Even though Carlés has been ousted from office and the ARA officers who led the coup have been placed in custody, the people are still protesting fearing a possible return to military dictatorship and further conflicts in the region.\n\nRamírez has promised that no such thing will happen and has requested all citizens to stay indoors until the last LP remnants are caught and eradicated."
 argdem.1.a: "Stability is still nowhere to be found."

 argdem.2.t: "March on Buenos Aires"
 argdem.2.d: "Only a week after Ramírez took over the nation, it was shaken up by one of the strangest events in Argentinian history. An unfamiliar social class, which had remained completely absent from Argentinian history until then, burst into Buenos Aires and demanded the military to step down. The city was taken by tens of thousands of workers from the industrial areas that had been growing on the outskirts of the city. The crowd set itself up in the Plaza de Mayo and refused to leave until their demands were met. It was characterised by the large number of young people and especially women who were part of it, and by the predominance of people with hair and skin darker than those who attended the traditional political acts of the time. The shocked upper class stressed these differences, referring to them in derogatory terms such as "blacks", "fat people", " descamisados (shirtless)", "cabecitas negras". It was the Radical Unionist leader Sammartino who even went so far as to call the event a "zoo flood".\n\nMiddle-Class activists who have also been protesting to secure democracy in Argentina were taken by complete surprise but eventually sided with the descamisados to push out the military. Ramírez is yet to make a statement but his hold on the nation seems to be diminishing by the day."
 argdem.2.a: "Enact a curfew on the streets!"
 argdem.2.b: "Promise open elections."

 argdem.3.t: "Protestors Refuse to Follow the Curfew"
 argdem.3.d: "Emboldened by their numbers, the protestors have outright refused the curfew and set up tents and beds on the Plaza de Mayo to test the resolve of Ramírez. Insufficient police, uncertain soldier and a general lack of organisation led to complete chaos when protestors elsewhere in the city started climbing the fence of the Presidential Residence. Shots were fired at the crowd to calm them down but only further enraged them.\n\nUnwilling to risk the lives of their fellow countrymen, the Colonels forced their men to stand down and send an attachment to lift Ramírez from power. Even though the military is not too happy with the changing political landscape, they have no choice but to accept the demands for now and allow free elections."
 argdem.3.a: "Long live the Republic!"

 argdem.4.t: "Elections Are Approaching"
 argdem.4.d: "Forced to concede to the people, Ramírez has written out elections for the republic and has promised to make them fair. The Army, however, is not interested in such a thing and would rather influence the results of the elections so they can hold on to power. Ramírez as the liberator of the people from the Carlés tyranny would lead the ballot and achieve an overwhelming victory with the support of the armed forces."
 argdem.4.a: "The results should not be tampered with!"
 argdem.4.b: "Our citizens are disillusioned and need a strong guardian."

 argdem.5.t: "Ramírez Wins a Crushing Victory!"
 argdem.5.d: "A strong campaign by the general, his overwhelming charisma and his firm gaze on the future have won him a crushing victory today, outperforming all other candidates... or so tells the state television. In reality, only a small fraction of the population supported the general and a sweeping victory was supposed to go to the Democratic coalition. Complaints from the other parties have been filed but seem to have been lost in the mail or denied by the High Court."
 argdem.5.a: "Long live Ramírez."

 argdem.6.t: "Election Day in Argentina"
 argdem.6.d: "Tensions are running high in Buenos Aires with the first free elections since the military took over the nation.

 argdem.6.b: "Roberto Marcelino Ortiz."
 argdem.6.c: "Ramón Antonio Castillo."

 argdem.7.t: "Election Day in Argentina"
 argdem.7.d: "Strong pushes by the Peronists have made the elections a close competition between the democratic alliance and the possible presidency of Domingo Peron. Support of the Unions and the rising discontent by the working class has made his popularity skyrocket in recent years, opening up the presidency to his party. Many fear however that Peron's ties to the military would lead to a repeat of the military government and the Ramírez period."

 argdem.71.e: "Ricardo Balbin becomes president."
 argdem.71.f: "Alicia Moreau de Justo becomes president."

 argdem.8.t: "Negotiations with the FOP"
 argdem.8.d: "Eager to solve the FOP debacle without further bloodshed and with the mandate of the people, the Argentinian government has drawn up plans to peacefully reintegrate the rebelling provinces. Concessions to the rebels will have to be made but the Buenos Aires administration feels confident that their Southern counterpart is willing to put an end to the hostilities as well. Army commanders are keeping a close eye on the developments but aren't willing to intervene until absolutely necessary, still remembering their downfall during the Ramírez presidency."
 argdem.8.a: "Make them an offer they can't refuse!"

 argdem.9.t: "Buenos Aires Extends the Olive Branch"
 argdem.9.d: "Unwilling to shed further blood in the conflict between our fledgling state and the nation of Argentina, the democratically elected government has proposed a peaceful reunification of the two nations. Willing to make concessions and work on fixing the social inequality in the nation, Buenos Aires has offered an immediate end to hostilities should we accept."
 argdem.9.a: "Accept the offer."
 argdem.9.b: "Their concessions are not enough!"

 argdem.10.t: "The FOP Accepts Reunification!"
 argdem.10.d: "Separated for over a decade, Argentine citizens from both Patagonia and Buenos Aires have finally reunited again. Both flags were symbolically raised one last time in Buenos Aires after which the FOP government transferred all power back to the central government. The road ahead is not going to be easy with labour conflicts at every turn but in a world ravaged by terror and war, this is a triumph for peace and stability."
 argdem.10.a: "Long Live Argentina!"

 argdem.11.t: "FOP Opposes Reunification!"
 argdem.11.d: "In a surprise move, the FOP government has denied our proposal calling it a betrayal of the revolution and a bad attempt at trying to silence the opposition. They have once more pressed us to accept the reality that Patagonia will not surrender until the last revolutionary has fallen for the Fatherland!"
 argdem.11.a: "It seems the FOP is nothing but warmongers and traitors to the republic!"

 argdem.12.t: "Wave of Military Propaganda Throughout the Nation"
 argdem.12.d: "Most likely inspired by the failure of the so-called 'democratic' regime to solve the FOP debacle as they had promised, has led to an increased spread of military propaganda demanding the army to step up and put the rebels down by force. Whether or not the propaganda was distributed by Army officials is unclear as of now but General Ramírez has denied all responsibility for the situation although he did confirm that the government should act quickly on the crisis or somebody else will do it in their place."
 argdem.12.a: "Once again the government is shaking."

 argdem.13.t: "The Opposition Starts a Vote of No Confidence!"
 argdem.13.d: "With public opinion towards harsh military intervention in Patagonia increasing by the day, the opposition has put forward a vote of no confidence in the current government this morning. Demanding the President to step down and new elections to be held as soon as possible, it is not looking good for the current government. Their failure to reach an agreement with the FOP and their incapacity to crack down on militarism, have plummeted their popularity and with no clear solution in sight, it may be wise to step down before the situation escalates."
 argdem.13.a: "The government falls!"
 argdem.13.b: "The vote fails!"

 argdem.14.t: "Ramírez Intervenes!"
 argdem.14.d: "Continued struggles within the cabinet, the failing negotiations to keep the coalition alive and the ever-growing threat on the Southern border have finally prompted Ramírez to shoot back into action and depose the government. Calling his decision to return power back to the people the worst in years, he has firmly reassumed control over the nation promising immediate intervention against the FOP and a crackdown on troublemakers in Argentina itself."
 argdem.14.a: "Three hurrahs for President Ramírez!"

 argdem.15.t: "Elections are Approaching"
 argdem.15.d: "Since the young coalition was incapable of ruling the nation and a vote of no confidence successfully dethroned them, new elections were written out to decide on the next president. The Army, however, is not interested in another open election and would rather influence the results of the elections so they can rule the nation. Ramírez as the liberator of the people from the Carlés tyranny would lead the ballot and achieve an overwhelming victory with the support of the armed forces."

 ARG_manuel_carles_leader_desc: "§YBorn:§! §LMay 30th, 1875, in Rosario, Santa Fe Province, Argentine Republic§!\n§YBackground:§! §LManuel Carlés began his political career when he joined the Union Civica Radical in 1891. He then climbed through the ranks of the party. He was assigned in 1918 as 'Interventor' of the Salta province. His methods granted him enough experience to be allowed to become a teacher in the 'Colegio Militar de la Nacion' and the 'Escuela Superior de Guerra'.\n\nIn 1919 Carlés was appointed as a commander of the paramilitary volunteers that were sent in to end protests of the workers on English-owned plant. 'Liga Patriótica Argentina', as they called themselves, were responsible for the murder of hundreds of striking workers. In 1921 and 1922, during rebellion in Patagonia, LPA forces caused gruesome acts of violence against strikers both in Patagonia and during a general strike in Buenos Aires. It was at this time that the once idealistic, moderate Carlés turned into an ice cold & ultranationalist political hardliner with no regard for left-leaning elements within the state.\n\nIn 1926, Carlés was shot by an anarchist on open street in Palermo, Buenos Aires, but survived. In 1930 Carles actively participated in Uriburu coup who installed military dictatorship. In 1932, the military regime collapsed after Uriburu's death. After a power struggle, UCR member Julio Roca become the new head of state. Roca began to seek a peace settlement with the Patagonians. Carlés took advantage of the popular outrage and launched a coup d'état on 24 December 1935 when Liga with the support of navy and parts of the military captured the capital.\n\nUnlike Uriburu in 1930, Carlés doesn't have the full support of the Argentinian people, as many had been enjoying Roca's liberalisation attempts. This would make it much harder for the new junta to establish their control over the country in the direct aftermath of the regime change. Whether he'll be able to secure power and accomplish his promises of expansion and prosperity remains to be seen...§!"

Despite becoming a national fencing champion, which turned him into a celebrity for the oligarchy, he's hardly had any relevant political position in his life, but the FOP's secession from Argentina has caused him great concern. After a short trip to Europe, he has changed his point of view regarding politics, and has returned to Argentina motivated by a will to help the working men of the country and take the nation to new heights.

Argentina saw slight economical improvement right until the British Revolution occurred, which led to the crash of the New York Stock Exchange in April of 1925. Despite this, de Alvear managed to turn the situation around by ordering the navy to capture the Falkland Islands and South Georgia, which were disputed territories between both countries. This increased morale and trust in the government, though as well as radicalisation of the military which had been previously humiliated by the Patagonian Rebellion between 1920 - 1922 and now stood in the shadow of the popular navy. He tried to reduce the FOP's influence in Argentina at large by granting better rights for workers in the country, although he had kept a hardline stance towards the FOP, mostly due to militaristic influences in his staff. Like his predecessor, Yrigoyen, he tried to intervene provinces that had their elections rigged by wealthy local elites, but his methods polarised the UCR and the UCRA even more.

However, unlike his founder, Miguel de Andrea took a hardline stance against the rising anarchist movements growing in the city of Buenos Aires, and as such quickly found himself aligning with the Liga Patriótica, taking part in their rallies and putting them into contact with the most reactionary sectors of the Argentinian branch of the Catholic Church.\n\nHowever, his views never aligned with the league, and he found himself coinciding more with the Portuguese Integralists who catered to his anti-liberal, ultra-Catholic and Corporatist mindset. While originally sceptic of a Brazilian victory, he quickly abandoned the Liga Patriótica as the defeat seemed imminent, and began pushing his contacts in the Brazilian church in order to proclaim his loyalty to the Integralists.
