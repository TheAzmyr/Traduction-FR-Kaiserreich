 SRI_join_the_intl_desc: "Both Germany and Austria are leery of a formal alliance being created between the Third Internationale and [Root.GetNameDef], whereby French and British forces would be called in to help us reunite Italy under syndicalist rule.

### Ideas ###
 SRI_dannunzian_coalition: "Dannunzian Coalition"
 SRI_dannunzian_coalition_desc: "Since 1934 the Socialist Republic has been governed by President Giulietti and Prime Minister Mussolini, ruling together in a nationalist and still internationalist fashion and evoking images of the great patriotic revolutionary martyr Gabriele d'Annunzio. In spite of all the propaganda, it's clear that the myth of D'Annunzio isn't nearly enough to solidify the government of a revolutionary nation; in addition, there are fears that Mussolini is working behind the scenes to erode our revolutionary democracy."

 SRI_italian_chetniks_idea_desc: "Formed in 1919, the Clandestine Military Front (dubbed the \"Italian Chetniks\" by Togliatti) is the organ tasked with the organisation of the stranded Royalist units in mainland Italy into an effective stay-behind unit to help the return of the House of Savoy. Operating in the more conservative areas of the country, but also in southern Piedmont and (with significant Swiss support) in the Val d'Ossola, they remain a powerful agent of reaction embedded within what is ostensibly our territory."

### Political Tree ###
 SRI_build_a_new_government: "Building a New Government"
 SRI_build_a_new_government_desc: "Giulietti's social-nationalist experiment has clearly failed, causing parliamentary gridlock in the wake of the new elections. We must however not show weakness; a new governing solution must be found."
 SRI_making_the_new_italy: "Making the New Italy"
 SRI_making_the_new_italy_desc: "After years of struggle, Italy is finally united; however, it is also clear that the compromise which encapsulated Socialist politics in the last years cannot last any longer. New elections have been scheduled: let us see what the morning sun brings."
 SRI_deal_with_fmc: "Deal with the FMC"
 SRI_deal_with_fmc_desc: "The Clandestine Military Front has been a thorn on our side for too long. With a stable government finally in place we can now see to at least contain and reduce their operations."
 SRI_crush_monarchist_militias: "Crush the Chetniks"
 SRI_crush_monarchist_militias_desc: "With Caviglia finally in our hands, nothing can stop our delivering of justice to the terrorists that have rampaged through our nation for so many years."
 SRI_attract_socialist_intellectuals: "Attract Socialist Intellectuals"
 SRI_attract_socialist_intellectuals_desc: "Across the Peninsula many socialist intellectuals still work for other governments or await their liberation. No more: let us call upon all these brave sons of Italy to come here (of course, with the promise of rightful compensation) and help in bringing the Revolution to our nation."

 # RadSocs

 SRI_seven_points_manifesto: "The Seven Points Manifesto"
 SRI_seven_points_manifesto_desc: "We will begin the process of enacting the Seven Points Manifesto. This will be the start of many hard nights for us to work on, and there are many who oppose this at every fibre of their being and will do anything to prevent this. But the fight will be worth it, for the new Italy to be born into a modern and free country."
 SRI_revise_colonial_agreements: "Revise Colonial Agreements"
 SRI_revise_colonial_agreements_desc: "The land reform programme of the socialist republic has, thus far, left much to be desired. Limited in scope and paternalistic in its supervision of the rural peasantry by the urban proletariat, its long overdue for revision. The PdA has now advanced legislation to this effect, which would greatly empower the peasantry across all of Italy if passed."
 SRI_regionalist_turn: "The Regionalist Turn"
 SRI_regionalist_turn_desc: "It's important that the regional communities of Italy must have their rights respected and not be drawn down into the gutter because of Rome's ignorance of their plight. Promoted by Emilio Lussu and Gaetano Salvemini, we will push forward a new system that will grant regional union federations more freedom to plan their own accords."
 SRI_paneuropean_cooperation: "Paneuropean Cooperation"
 SRI_paneuropean_cooperation_desc: "Long ago, Rome once ruled a large amount of Europe, and today the nations of Europe can be considered her children. It makes sense for a new kind of Pan-european ideal to once again take root here, with the modern values of socialism and democracy to reunite us into an era of peace for the workers of Europe."
 SRI_enforced_secularism: "Enforced Secularism"
 SRI_enforced_secularism_desc: "One of the Seven Points is that of Secularism, which is necessary to prevent the stagnation caused by being biased by ones' religion. In order to complete our goals, the Catholic Church must be completely separated from the state, and education to be more inclusive to all faiths."
 SRI_liberalise_the_unions: "Liberalise the Unions"
 SRI_liberalise_the_unions_desc: "Workers now have the freedom to join the liberal unions rather than the urban-rural duopoly of CGdL and USI. This will also allow the liberal unions to have more political freedoms to function more independently in return."
 SRI_break_enemies_of_democracy: "Break the Enemies of Democracy"
 SRI_break_enemies_of_democracy_desc: "The fascist snakes lurk in the shadows to bite at the chance to end our freedom, so we in return will become the eagles that shall hunt them down. The FAR and Blackshirts will now be forced to disband, and any of them who are caught conspiring against democracy shall meet justice, namely that of the wannabe Caesar, Mussolini."
 SRI_constitutional_restoration: "The Constitutional Restoration"
 SRI_constitutional_restoration_desc: "Liberals also value freedom, and it would be rather tyrannical of us to exclude them from having a voice in politics on a radical system. The original constitution shall be restored, with a few revisions that are still geared towards workers' values."
 SRI_compromise_with_unions: "A Compromise with the Unions"
 SRI_compromise_with_unions_desc: "We mustn't forget our syndicalist brothers, as the Italian worker would not have been liberated without their help. Henceforth, Italy shall remain a pure and free workers' republic, and remnants of any reactionary forces that threaten this will now be cut permanently."

 # Shared between RadSocs and Syndies
 SRI_reconcile_with_likeminded_republicans: "Reconcile with Likeminded Republicans"
 SRI_reconcile_with_likeminded_republicans_desc: "With our control of Italy ensured, we can offer an olive branch to the white officers sympathetic to our cause. Their expertise will be useful to the Revolution - not to mention, the people they worked with will be more prone to accepting the new status quo."

 SRI_amnesty_for_service: "Amnesty for Service"
 SRI_amnesty_for_service_desc: "Even more officers and soldiers fought against us not because of their ideological opposition to our Republic, but simply because of a sense of duty to the government they lived under. They don't truly hold a grudge against syndicalism, and will fight for us if we offer them an amnesty for their crimes against socialism."

 # Syndies
 SRI_the_syndicalist_orthodoxy: "The Syndicalist Orthodoxy"
 SRI_the_syndicalist_orthodoxy_desc: "In spite of vicious attacks from the presidentialist FAR and Mussolini, the syndicalist orthodoxy established in 1919 lives on to see another day. Some things will need to change - interim president Giulietti is almost universally disliked and will rapidly be replaced - but we can rest assured that no one will threaten our democracy again."
 SRI_empower_cgl: "Empower Urban Unions"
 SRI_empower_cgl_desc: "The French-inspired compromise between urban and rural unions cannot hold. As the urban CGdL is by far the largest union in the country, it and her leader Giuseppe di Vittorio will lead Italy for the time being."
 SRI_empower_usi: "Empower Rural Unions"
 SRI_empower_usi_desc: "The French-inspired compromise between urban and rural unions cannot hold. With the rural anarchist USI being the most militant union in the country, it and her leader Alberto Meschi will continue our revolution."
 SRI_follow_french_light: "Follow the Torch-Bearers"
 SRI_follow_french_light_desc: "The urban-rural compromise will hold here as it did in France. Unity is, after all, our greatest strength; as such, the French-aligned Pietro Nenni will rise to the top, in a bid for socialist unification."
 SRI_exclude_catholic_unions: "Exclude Catholic Unions"
 SRI_exclude_catholic_unions_desc: "We cannot afford to come to a deal with the force that's working to destroy the Republic. Even if they may declare themselves loyal, the Catholic-aligned unions will have to be disbanded for the security of the Republic."
 SRI_compromise_with_the_church: "Compromise with the Church"
 SRI_compromise_with_the_church_desc: "Most of our population is Catholic and many trade unionists adhere to the Social Doctrine of the Church. Even if it pains us, we must come to an understanding with the Roman Catholic Church, for the stability of our nation."
 SRI_the_spirit_of_parma: "The Spirit of Parma"
 SRI_the_spirit_of_parma_desc: "In 1907, the USI led the biggest trade union demonstration in Italy prior to the 1919 revolution itself, and it was only due to the Socialist Party's inaction that we had to postpone the liberation of the proletariat for 12 years. The spirit of the Parma strikes lives on through us - and will be at the basis of the new Italy."
 SRI_movement_of_true_action: "The Movement of True Action"
 SRI_movement_of_true_action_desc: "While the bigger trade unions and the Socialist Party danced with reformism, our small USI always fought for the revolution and the liberation of all proletarians. Even if we lost some important voices on the way, we remain what we've always been - the only movement calling for true revolutionary action."
 SRI_crush_the_squadracce: "Crush the Squadracce"
 SRI_crush_the_squadracce_desc: "The fascist blackshirts continue to roam the country and attack our union organisations. The government must be clear - the mistakes that have been made since 1934 will be rectified, and the anti-democratic blackshirts destroyed in the process."
 SRI_empower_federated_unions: "Empower the Federated Unions"
 SRI_empower_federated_unions_desc: "We can't just empower the CGdL as a whole - the federated unions that form the confederation must be given the powers and liberties they need to protect and manage the Italian workers."
 SRI_appeal_to_socialist_unity: "Appeal to Socialist Unity"
 SRI_appeal_to_socialist_unity_desc: "The biggest strength of the Socialist Republic is our unity in the face of adversity. President Nenni knows this - which is why he's called for socialists of all denominations, and especially his moderate friend Giuseppe Saragat, to come back to the union of the Internationale."
 SRI_fight_for_internationalism: "Fight for Internationalism"
 SRI_fight_for_internationalism_desc: "We have seen it ourselves - the liberation of all workers can't coincide with nationalist bickering, and will always be fought by all anti-proletarian forces. We must be ready to fight for liberty - we will be ready!"
 SRI_the_federal_union: "The Federal Union"
 SRI_the_federal_union_desc: "We have signed an interesting pact with the Church. With their support, the Catholic unions will be merged with the CGdL in a new, all-Italian federal union to coordinate the efforts of all workers towards their emancipation. This is sure to win us some much needed support."
 SRI_emphasise_the_social_saints: "Emphasise the Social Saints"
 SRI_emphasise_the_social_saints_desc: "The Church is, in fact, the first ally of the poor. In promoting our relationship with the church, we shall... ignore the last century of militant reaction; instead, we shall place our attention on the many low level priests who did much to help the proletariat."
 SRI_protect_local_democracy: "Protect Local Democracy"
 SRI_protect_local_democracy_desc: "As part of our deal with the Church, Catholic-aligned reactionary politicians will be allowed to run for office on the smallest scales of Government. While the Socialist Republic controls the nation and the cities, the Church will keep their hold of the countryside - in cooperation with our rule."
 SRI_revolutionary_expropriations: "Revolutionary Expropriations"
 SRI_revolutionary_expropriations_desc: "With a souring relationship with the church, we can't allow them to control the local governance of the nation. Even excluding the churches themselves, they control a myriad of other utility buildings - which will have to be nationalised."
 SRI_empower_chambers_of_labour: "Empower the Chambers of Labour"
 SRI_empower_chambers_of_labour_desc: "The local chambers of labour were initially instituted in the last century to deal with the power of the centrally appointed mayors, but now they have a new objective: crushing the power of the Church at the local level. This cannot be achieved actively: so instead, we will gradually shift local government powers into the Chambers."
 SRI_building_a_new_mythos: "Building a New Mythos"

 SRI_modernise_the_armata_rossa_desc: "The Red Army was formed out of mutineering units back in the 1919 Revolution, and hasn't changed much since. As the backwardness of the armed forces was one of the leading reasons for our failure to seize the rest of the country in 1927, we shall make sure this won't be a problem in the future."

 SRI_telo_mimetico: "Telo Mimetico"
 SRI_telo_mimetico_desc: "The colourful jackets of yesteryear have nothing to do on the modern battlefield. While simple, one-coloured uniforms are already in use, the usage of a camouflage pattern originally meant for tents has been proposed."

 SRI_howitzer_standardisation: "Howitzer Standardisation"
 SRI_howitzer_standardisation_desc: "The number of different types of field guns in the armed forces is raising, straining supply lines. By creating a standard for howitzer barrels and ammunition, these parts will be easier to both supply and replace."

 SRI_cannone_da_novanta: "Cannone da 90"
 SRI_cannone_da_novanta_desc: "As both enemy land and air vehicles are more heavily armoured, a new, larger gun is necessary to punch through them. A new, 90 mm calibre one will do the job just fine."

 SRI_semoventi_dartiglieria_desc: "The king of the battlefield is just as slow and unmoving as its counterpart on the chess board. The construction of self-propelled guns will allow for a new dimension in artillery warfare. "

 SRI_carri_di_rottura: "Carri di Rottura"
 SRI_carri_di_rottura_desc: "To avoid the stalemates of the Weltkrieg, heavier and more powerfully armed tanks are necessary to rupture the static enemy defences, and pave way for the infantry attack."

 SRI_la_legione_proletaria_desc: "Every worker in Italy has his say in what the revolution is and how it will be achieved. Risorgimento will be an opportunity for the men and women of Italy to do our nation proud; we will enable this by sculpting an army where even the humblest of our men has a place."

 SRI_corpo_darmata_di_manovra: "Corpo d'Armata di Manovra"
 SRI_corpo_darmata_di_manovra_desc: "It is not enough to break the enemy's line, we need dedicated units that can move in and exploit openings through aggressive manoeuvring and attacks in depth. The Weltkrieg use of tanks as something to support infantry remains a dated concept, our new Manoeuvre Army Corps will use modern tanks and mounted infantry to strike exposed flanks or breaches in the enemy line. "

 SRI_ragruppamenti_esploranti: "Ragruppamenti Esploranti"
 SRI_ragruppamenti_esploranti_desc: "As an originally partisan force, the Socialist army is all too familiar with the value of reconnaissance and what can be done with it. Long range patrols will allow for deeper penetration, less risk, and generally more effective operations."

 SRI_establish_military_inspectorate: "Establish Military Inspectorate"
 SRI_establish_military_inspectorate_desc: "The myriad of popular militias needs to be turned into a combined force to serve the revolution. A military inspectorate will be created to discipline the army, and the previously so independent division commanders will be forced to standardise both equipment, organisation and training."

 SRI_one_army_one_command: "One Army, One Command"
 SRI_one_army_one_command_desc: "The Socialist movement in Italy has grown from a plucky resistance movement in 1919 to a genuine state prepared to govern the whole nation. Our army structure must reflect this: while autonomy might be paramount while communication and logistics are occasional blessings, commanding the large army of Italy today requires a central command capable of administrating the whole war effort, and field commanders must be able to follow to their meticulous plans."

 SRI_maintain_officer_autonomy: "Maintain Officer Autonomy"
 SRI_maintain_officer_autonomy_desc: "No armed revolt has ever succeeded through byzantine bureaucracy. Simplifying responsibilities and giving more power to lower officers give them the leeway they need to creatively solve the strategic challenges they will face on the battlefield."

 SRI_reform_modena_military_academy: "Reform the Modena Military Academy"
 SRI_reform_modena_military_academy_desc: "It is clear that some level of professionalisation of our officer corps is needed. Though with a feudal background, the Modena Military Academy is now more famed as a hotbed for military revolutionaries with a myriad of ideas on how to combine socialism with the army. By introducing a more strict curriculum in combination with higher academic standards, we might be able to organise the many ideas into policies and initiatives of use to the army.  "

 SRI_gruppi_di_difesa_della_donna: "Gruppi di Difesa della Donna"
 SRI_gruppi_di_difesa_della_donna_desc: "Long on the mind of many egalitarians in the armed forces, the introduction of women into the combat services of the army seems an obvious way to strengthen not only our manpower pool, but also encourage gifted and ambitious women to make a career in our armed forces. As a start we will create specific Defence Groups for women, from where we can integrate them into the army as a whole."

 SRI_vallo_alpino: "Vallo Alpino"
 SRI_vallo_alpino_desc: "The Alps are some of the best natural defences a nation could ask for, but the presense of mountain passes makes relying on nature to do all the work unwise. By building permanent defences inside of these passes and other weak points, the northern border can be made a truly impassable wall."

 SRI_arditi_del_popolo: "Arditi del Popolo"
 SRI_arditi_del_popolo_desc: "The Arditi were famed during the Weltkrieg as shock troops able to challenge the stalemate of trench warfare. Further developments in automatic weapons and close quarters fighting have only made the possible uses of such units more appealing. Combining Arditi tactics with revolutionary fervour, the new Arditi del Popolo will be the shock troops that will open the way for our victory against the reactionaries."

 SRI_corpo_speciale: "Corpo Speciale"
 SRI_corpo_speciale_desc: "The one consistency of the battleground in Italy is that it is inconsistent. Massive mountain ranges, distant islands, packed cities and formidable rivers divide the peninsula, and ignoring these differences would be highly foolish. Instead, we must have contingents ready to face every situation."

 SRI_brigate_marine: "Brigate Marine"
 SRI_brigate_marine_desc: "An advantage of fighting an offensive war on the peninsula is that if the front quietens, one is not out of options. Corpo Speciale units can land behind the enemy to surround and disrupt them, and to attack the difficult targets of Sardinia and Sicily."

 SRI_carabinieri_del_cielo: "Carabinieri del Cielo"
 SRI_carabinieri_del_cielo_desc: "While they are not as easily applicable as mountaineers or marines, paratroopers are still a valuable asset for any modern army. Inaccessible areas such as fortifications and ports can be captured through rapid shock and awe, clearing their proximities for the advance of regular troops."

 SRI_alpini_rossi: "Alpini Rossi"
 SRI_alpini_rossi_desc: "Of course, in a peninsula largely consisting of three mountain ranges the first kind of specialist force anyone will think necessary is the mountaineer battalion, and for good reason. Mountain warfare is inevitable and we must surpass our enemies' combat capability on such battlefields."

 SRI_la_guardia_rossa: "La Guardia Rossa"
 SRI_la_guardia_rossa_desc: "Socialism is the politics of science and reason. We will defeat our enemies, not by witless sacrifice of men, but with the best-trained professional army equipt with the best-produced arms built by the most efficient industry while the traditionalists in Naples and Cagliari tremor."

 SRI_formazione_di_difesa: "Formazione di Difesa"
 SRI_formazione_di_difesa_desc: "As offensively adept as the Guardia Rossa might be, they will need a defensive backbone to succeed. Rather than muddy the responsibilities and doctrine of the national army, we will use militias to fill gaps and defend positions while larger formations are free to break the enemy."

 SRI_scuole_centrale_militare: "Scuole Centrale Militare"
 SRI_scuole_centrale_militare_desc: "The formation of a federalised body of military schools around the country will facilitate standardisation, allowing us to develop more ambitious tactics around the technologically rich Guardia Rossa formations."

 SRI_autotrasportabilita: "Autotrasportabilità"
 SRI_autotrasportabilita_desc: "The majority of our land and population remains under the stranglehold of our enemies and the Guardia Rossa will need a practical solution to guarantee our superiority over them. Thankfully, our superiority in industry supplies this: by engineering better vehicles for mobile units and doctrine to support, we can outmaneuever our enemies on the peninsula and defeat them in detail before they are able to utilise their numerical advantages."

 SRI_guerra_brigantesca: "Guerra Brigantesca"
 SRI_guerra_brigantesca_desc: "The troops of the Guardia Rossa must be able to fight like bandits: mobile, hidden, and flexible. These qualities made socialist warfare possible in the first place, and will be integrated into our doctrine."

 SRI_guardia_alla_frontiera: "Guardia alla Frontiera"
 SRI_guardia_alla_frontiera_desc: "While guerilla tactics may have served us well inside of our borders, the Guardia Rossa must be prepared for wars with its neighbours too, and for such warfare we must be able to defend a wide front in preparation for offensives either from our territory or an expedition."

 SRI_corpo_del_genio_aeronautico: "Corpo del Genio Aeronautico"
 SRI_corpo_del_genio_aeronautico_desc: "While airfield construction and aircraft repairs have usually been delegated to army engineers and squadron support units respectively, it has become clear that a dedicated Air Force Engineer Corps needs to be established. With the construction of the Città del'Aria, it would be obvious to place the headquarters of the new corps in Umbria as well."

 SRI_citta_del_aria: "Città del'Aria"
 SRI_citta_del_aria_desc: "Italy has ever been at the forefront of air power, using aircraft for combat purposes even before the Weltkrieg. The chaos and instability of the civil war has interrupted our pole position however. We will set aside land and industry in Umbria for the creation of a 'City of the Air', where we will combine schools, manufactories and research to foster a spirit of progress and industriousness. "

 SRI_accademia_aeronautica: "Accademia Aeronautica"
 SRI_accademia_aeronautica_desc: "The anarchy of the Italian forces in the latter days of the Weltkrieg and the fervent nature of the civil war left little room for modernising military tactics. In today's world, modernity means warfare conducted in the sky. Pilot training is key to catching our armed capabilities up with our neighbours."

 SRI_trimotore_bombers: "Trimotore Bombers"
 SRI_trimotore_bombers_desc: "Our previous experience with trimotor medium aircraft has shown great promise. Improved engines and designs would allow us to not only increase the payload of such bombers, but also equip them with the defensive weaponry needed to survive in a contested airspace. "

 SRI_pursuit_aircraft: "Pursuit Aircraft"
 SRI_pursuit_aircraft_desc: "While multirole platforms have certainly made our production able to compete with our neighbours, it has meant some of our aircraft could underperform in combat. With production eased by our new facilities and institutions, we should focus on developing a dedicated air superiority platform. These new "pursuit aircraft" will only seek to target enemy planes, and with improved manoeuvring and heavy air-to-air armaments be able to come out on top in every dogfight."

 SRI_aviazione_marittima: "Aviazione Marittima"
 SRI_aviazione_marittima_desc: "With our air force becoming a more centralised and independent branch of our armed forces, we should make it able to take over all the roles previously taken by both the army and navy air services. Improved air designs would make our aircraft able to contest the Mediterranean and support the navy as it fights the reactionary regimes. "

 SRI_command_of_the_air: "Command of the Air"
 SRI_command_of_the_air_desc: "The terrain of Italy and the difficulties it imposes on our armed forces means we have to reconsider novel approaches to warfare. One suggestion is to follow the doctrine and thoughts laid out by Giulio Douhet, who during the Weltkrieg was arguing for massive bombing campaigns to break the stalemate of trench warfare. Our bomber fleets should target the enemy's cities as well as their forces on the battlefield, allowing us to gain a decisive advantage in firepower."

 SRI_arma_offensiva: "Arma Offensiva"
 SRI_arma_offensiva_desc: "One of the major worries with strategic bombing campaigns, has been the relative vulnerability connected with having our bombers spend increased amounts of time over enemy territory. Developments in new bomb types and tactics would allow us to fly higher and minimize the risk our aircraft face from anti-aircraft fire."

 SRI_aerei_da_battaglia: "Aerei da Battaglia"
 SRI_aerei_da_battaglia_desc: "The concept of 'flying artillery' is not new, but we have to admit that the more ponderous medium bombers are tactically inflexible for battlefield fire support. The creation of new 'battle aircraft' who will have a dedicated battlefield support role, will mean that our divisions will always have fire support available to them no matter how fast they advance, or how contested the airspace over the battlefield is."

 SRI_aviazone_dassalto: "Aviazone d'Assalto"
 SRI_aviazone_dassalto_desc: "Rather than focus on destroying the enemy through better bomber aircraft, an alternative approach could be to simply deny the airspace to the enemy. New training could emphasise the fighter as our premier aircraft type. We wouldn't need better bombers if the ones we have were at little risk of being intercepted."

 SRI_zone_aeree_territoriali: "Zone Aeree Territoriali"
 SRI_zone_aeree_territoriali_desc: "An organisational change is needed to ensure maximum efficiency amongst our squadrons. New territorial air commands will be in charge of local defence as well coordination with our industries to improve aircraft designs. By removing middlemen, not only will our squadrons be able to respond better to local intrusions into our airspace, but we will get pilot input into new aircraft, hopefully making them available quicker than through ordinary testing and production methods."

 SRI_difesa_contraerea_territoriale: "Difesa Contraerea Territoriale"
 SRI_difesa_contraerea_territoriale_desc: "A sometime undervalued part of the air power, is the impact that ground based anti-aircraft artillery can have on local air superiority. We should create specific anti-air units under command of the air force, so as to ensure that our air defence remains unified in mission and purpose."

 SRI_istituto_di_studi_militari_marittimi: "Istituto di Studi Militari Marittimi"
 SRI_istituto_di_studi_militari_marittimi_desc: "To lead a ship to victory, knowledge of tactics, engineering and logistics is necessary for higher level officers. Establishing a new institute researching and teaching these topics will ensure a key edge over the other navies on the peninsula."

 SRI_expand_the_livorno_academy: "Expand the Livorno Academy"
 SRI_expand_the_livorno_academy_desc: "The navy needs further expansion, which is not possible without men on the decks. To the luck of the [ROOT.GetAdjective] government, the original training academy of the Navy is still within the territory under its controlled, and can be easily expanded."

 SRI_corpo_del_genio_navale: "Corpo del Genio Navale"
 SRI_corpo_del_genio_navale_desc: "Just as a soldier would not got to war with a rusty rifle, a sailor can not sail a leaky ship. Caring for and maintaining ships has become specialised knowledge, that should have its own section within the Navy."

 SRI_flottiglie_mas: "Flottiglie MAS"
 SRI_flottiglie_mas_desc: "The torpedo has revolutionised naval warfare, allowing small boats to sink much larger targets. Taking this idea to below the surface yields a new type of submarine which small, nimble and lightly manned."

 SRI_revolution_under_the_sea: "Revolution Under the Sea"
 SRI_revolution_under_the_sea_desc: "If the Entente think the Mediterranean is an easy doorstep into the southern borders of revolutionary Europe, they are sorely mistaken.

Its rulers know full well that it would have overrun the republicans and the whites, had it not been for the infernal interference of Austria and the pressure applied by Germany.

The nation bides its time, building its strength, and is fully aware that - once the scale tips - it shall tip in the favour of revolution."

### Intro Screen ###
 SRI_country_intro_header: "The Socialist Republic of Italy"
 SRI_country_intro_content: "In 1919, the Italians signed an armistice with the Austrians, ending the war for the Kingdom of Italy. However, the brave socialists and nationalists in Italy rose up against the destructive Savoyards, determined to replace their system with something better. Even King Victor Emmanuel and his son's abdication was not enough to stop the will of the people, and civil war broke out across Italy. Even as we pushed the royalists out of northern Italy, however, there were traitors in our own ranks. The “Whites” in the republican uprising, unwilling to accept the inevitability of the revolution, broke with our movement and soon sold themselves out completely to the Austrians. With our enemies all united against us, our advances were halted on the Po and on the Abruzzo line, and the war was over.\n\nSince the ceasefire in 1920, the political situation has changed: following the moderate unionists' failure to capitalise on the fall of the Italian Federation in 1927 the Nationalists in the FAR, calling on the legacy of Gabriele d'Annunzio who died fighting the Austrians in 1919, started a march towards political dominance. By 1931, this effectively eroded the Trade Unions' stranglehold on Parliament, leaving them with a slight majority; when this majority collapsed in 1934, president Giulietti overcame his constitutional bounds to appoint a \"president's cabinet\" led by FAR leader Benito Mussolini. Mussolini himself has been acting way more autonomously than expected, while constantly growing his influence; many look with apprehension at the coming 1936 elections, unsure what the future may bring to the Socialist Republic."

 SRI_country_intro_header_1: "Uniting Italy"
 SRI_country_intro_content_1: "Italian nationalists have already begun the call for a Second Risorgimento, to unify Italy once more. Spreading the revolution will not be a simple matter, however. The peninsula exists in an uneasy balance: Germany and Austria are wary of any formal alliance between the SRI and the Third Internationale. They know an alliance is inevitable, but any attempt on our part to bring the French and British into a war to reunite Italy under syndicalist rule would draw intervention and start a new Weltkrieg. The Republic of Italy to the east is protected by Austria, but under a similar prohibition against starting a war against us. So long as the prospect of German and Austrian interference remains, we must be aware that any war to reunite Italy can only be done with limited Third Internationale support. We have not made a move yet, but we cannot sit idly for much longer - Italy must be reunited!"

 socitaly.2.t: "Mussolini and the Totalist Charter"
 socitaly.2.d: "When he left for Britain, we thought the Mussolini-Mosley Summit would simply be one of pleasantries and diplomacy. Instead, Mussolini went ahead and put his signature on Mosley's latest invention, the \"ideology\" of \"totalism\". Some naive functionaries believe nothing has changed; from the start Mussolini subscribed to fascist ideology and to the 1919 Fascist Manifesto, and the fact he now has international allies changes nothing on the internal front. However, this was yet another enormously publicised autonomous action without presidential endorsement, complicating President Giulietti's position as when he broke constitutional norm to appoint Mussolini he was supposedly appointing a \"president's cabinet\" acting on his orders.\n\nWith the 1936 elections drawing ever closer, it appears Giulietti's tenure as president may be nearing its end, as, having alienated most moderates through his breach of constitutional norm and having lost much ground to his supposed puppet Mussolini, he won't be able to gain the goodwill to appoint another President's Cabinet anytime soon."
 socitaly.2.a: "How will we form a government now?"

 socitaly.3.t: "The 1936 Elections"
 socitaly.3.d: "With the 1920 constitution creating an unicameral parliament formed of candidates elected from both unions and popular vote, the Parliament of the Socialist Republic was always something of a mess. However, it has never been as messy as it is from today.\n\nIt appears the unions have lost even more ground than expected; they have bled much support to both the heavily parliamentarist Actionists and the Fascists, and have outright lost their absolute majority for the first time in the history of the Socialist Republic. In the new climate, president Giulietti tried to return to his role as constitutional head of state, and then tried to have a parliamentary government formed; however, with the unions blaming him for their poor result and the actionists refusing to work under the President who broke constitutional norms to appoint a nationalist government, negotiations soon stalled. While there may yet be a path to a working government, there certainly is no path forwards for Giulietti."
 socitaly.3.a: "Negotiations must start rapidly, we don't want another election!"

 socitaly.4.t: "The New Compromise"
 socitaly.4.d: "In the end, in spite of his mandate lasting to 1938, Giulietti resigned from the Presidency. This did much to restart negotiations; Mussolini put himself forward as a man who was simply fulfilling his patriotic duty by leading the \"president's cabinet\" in 1934; while it built no sympathy from the parliamentarist Actionists, it did enough to make the Unions support his bid for the Presidency - especially when he promised to appoint the union-aligned Angelo Tasca as Prime Minister if elected. And elected he was: with his first act as President being, of course, the appointment of a new Tasca government.\n\nThis doesn't mean stability has returned; far from it. The unions' infatuation with Mussolini as man of the hour rapidly vanished when it became clear Mussolini was being even more aggressive in his reinforcement of the Presidency. There now appears to be something of a tug-of-war between Mussolini and union leadership, seeking to break each other's hold of power; in the middle are the Actionists, now hoping to slide between the two sides and restore parliamentary powers while the two giants of Italian politics mutilate each other.\n\nA facade of unity will be maintained while the Revolution is yet to be fulfilled; but once the Peninsula has been brought its Revolution, the smoke will clear and someone will emerge from the ashes to build a new Italy."
 socitaly.4.a: "The future of Italy is built from here."

 socitaly.5.t: "The New Parliamentarist Government"
 socitaly.5.d: "With the conflict between Unions and Presidency taking heavy tolls on both sides, it appears neither of the two is now strong enough to sustain a government. The only option for a workable executive ended up being the Actionists; and, in spite of the heavy mutual distrust between Rosselli and Mussolini, constant Fascist attacks and Union criticism, the President was eventually forced to appoint Rosselli as Prime Minister. How long such an executive, formed out of the lack of a united opposition rather than an actual majority, may last remains to be seen."
 socitaly.5.a: "Good luck, Rosselli"

 socitaly.6.t: "The New Syndicalist Government"
 socitaly.6.d: "As the political equilibrium changes, it appears the Unions have emerged as the only force capable of forming a government, in spite of constant fascist interference. With other forces failing to deliver, Mussolini was forced to appoint Tasca as Prime Minister, much to his chagrin. For now, a strong union government is in power; the Fascists will undoubtedly fight tooth and nail to gain control of the Government, so the fight isn't yet over."
 socitaly.6.a: "Good luck, Tasca"

 socitaly.7.t: "The New Presidentialist Government"
 socitaly.7.d: "With the other factions suffering heavily under Blackshirt fire, it appears Mussolini was at last able to appoint his close ally de Ambris to the position of Prime Minister. The conflict is far from over, as both Unions and Actionists organise to take down the executive; but for now, the Fascists are in control of both Presidency and Government."
 socitaly.7.a: "Good luck, de Ambris"

 socitaly.8.t: "The Postwar Election"
 socitaly.8.d: "With Italy finally united, the various politicians across the country are now vociferously asking for new elections, which are to include the newly liberated territories. On a theoretical level, everyone agrees that these lands should have the right to influence the government of the Socialist Republic - and effectively, the reconstruction regime in these territories means these new elections will see a certain victory of the sitting government which would lead us out of the constant instability that has plagued the country since 1936. Unions, Actionists and Fascists still have a month to play their power games, after which they're sure to blow each other to smithereens."
 socitaly.8.a: "We'll see who comes out on top"

 socitaly.9.t: "Il Sol dell'Avvenire"
 socitaly.9.d.r: "The first post-war elections have finally been held. Polling booths were opened all over the country, though in certain unreconstructed areas the vote was severely restricted - much to the chagrin of the sitting Actionist government, who had hoped to use these elections to prove the democratic nature of the Socialist Republic. Nevertheless, a recent push to expand suffrage in these areas proved to be a successful gamble for the Actionists, who ended up being the great winners of this election. Defying blackshirt interference and outnumbering the candidates elected through the trade unions (with a number of sympathetic elected coming from these ranks as well) the Actionists will now surely be the leaders of the first post-war government.\n\nImmediately, an accord was found with the Trade Unions to impeach Mussolini; the President sensed the failure of the Presidentialist project, resigned from power and quickly left the country. In his place Parliament has elected Rosselli; though he opposes the extraordinary powers of the Presidency, he has chosen to keep these powers until he is able to fully restore constitutional normalcy."
 socitaly.9.d.s: "The first post-war elections have finally been held. Polling booths were opened all over the country, though in certain unreconstructed areas the vote was severely restricted - something which the sitting Unionist government has deemed necessary. The Government was also able to keep the Blackshirts at bay during the elections; these two combined factors ended up stumping both Parliamentarians and Presidentialists, while the Union candidates retook the absolute majority they had lost in 1934. Indeed, the Unions are the great winners of these first elections, though their internal divisions almost made this for naught.\n\nOne thing they all agreed upon was an immediate move to impeach Mussolini; the President sensed the failure of the Presidentialist project, resigned from power and quickly left the country. Conflict soon erupted over his successor; some expressed their support of a full restoration of the institutional presidency, but a consensus emerged in favour of a semi-presidentialist model. In the end, Prime Minister Tasca broke the deadlock by proposing former president Giulietti temporarily reassume the post until a better candidate is found. This move may have killed Tasca's hope to remain in charge of government affairs once this candidate is elected - but it did safeguard Unionist supremacy over government."
 socitaly.9.d.t: "The first post-war elections have finally been held. Polling booths were opened all over the country, though in certain unreconstructed areas the vote was severely restricted - something which Mussolini supported fully. Indeed, with the Army being occupied with the pacification of the liberated areas the Blackshirts were free to roam the country, producing an electoral result heavily skewed in the Fascists' favour. While they didn't quite gain an absolute majority, the Fascists became the biggest parliamentary faction by far, and the internal divisions of Unions and Actionists mean no challenge to Mussolini's rule is likely to succeed.\n\nWith this resounding victory, Mussolini is free to move forward with his \"fascist revolution\" - though he may need to rein in his own Blackshirts before they become too much of a problem for his executive."
 socitaly.9.a: "A splendid day for democracy!"
 socitaly.9.b: "What a comeback!"
 socitaly.9.c: "What will this lead to?"

 socitaly.11.t: "A Pact of Pacification?"
 socitaly.11.d: "With the current government espousing a radical rhetoric and violence on the rise in the internal front, trade unionists and blackshirt leaders together have brokered an agreement for temporary peace between the two factions. They reason that everyone will need to do their utmost to bring our revolution to its conclusion; as such, petty squabbles must be postponed indefinitely.\n\nOf course, effectively this \"pact of pacification\" is likely to be irrelevant in actually bringing peace to the country, and indeed the government standing down is likely to give the Parliamentarist opposition the ammunition it needs to form a government of its own. Still, the idea of internal peace is very popular, and opposing the pact will be seen as a sign of increased militancy."
 socitaly.11.a: "Let us come to an agreement"
 socitaly.11.b: "We can't let our guard down!"

 socitaly.12.t: "Increased Blackshirt Militancy"
 socitaly.12.d: "Lately the Blackshirts have increased their range of operations, launching actions against supposed \"subversives and anti-revolutionaries\" - with the clear intent of containing the power of the trade unions. As they are supported by the Presidency from behind the scenes, Public Security is unlikely to intervene against them; however, it appears union leadership is organising \"proletarian defence\" groups, which we may sponsor: this would effectively neuter the Blackshirt offensive, but would also be a bloody affair."
 socitaly.12.a: "There is nothing we can do"
 socitaly.12.b: "We can fight fire with fire!"

 socitaly.13.t: "Strikes against Mussolini"
 socitaly.13.d: "In a direct attack on the government of the Socialist Republic, trade union leaders have proclaimed a number of strikes against the leadership of President Mussolini, his supposed violations of the constitution and blackshirt actions in general. While the position of the Presidency isn't threatened, it is clear the facade of unity must be restored... though Mussolini himself seems to be of a different opinion."
 socitaly.13.a: "We must find an agreement before this gets out of hand"
 socitaly.13.b: "Can't we simply ignore them...?"

 socitaly.14.t: "Conflict between President and Government"
 socitaly.14.d: "The differing policies of President Mussolini and the Government seem to have caused us to reached the breaking point. With Mussolini sponsoring the Blackshirts and several other anti-democratic movements, while directly undermining the stability of the executive, Parliament has threatened to pass a motion of no confidence in him, which would end his rule and doom the presidentialist project.\n\nSuch a motion passing is far-fetched, but it does show that the Presidency cannot expect to do as it pleases and ignore the will of the other branches of Government.\n\nWhile the tensions won't be truly solved until either the Government or Mussolini are forced out, the crisis may be at least relieved by a temporary truce between the FAR and the rest of the country. Of course, Mussolini seems intent on doubling down instead, and there are rumors a \"President's Government\" is ready to be appointed."
 socitaly.14.a: "Fetch me de Ambris, will you?"
 socitaly.14.b: "That would be insane!"

 socitaly.15.t: "Papers against the Presidency"
 socitaly.15.d: "As both Presidency and Government are in the hands of FAR politicians, the opposition has now elected to voice its opposition to the state of affairs on the press. Since the Revolution, most publications have been in the hands of the National Press Federation, with most other journals being censored according to a Presidential Decree signed in 1921. This is now giving the trade unions the freedom and means to harshly criticise the Presidency; over the last weeks, they have started to truly impact the government, as public opinion seems to be turning against Mussolini and especially de Ambris.\n\nThough the advisors to the Presidency oppose the move, there is a way to temporarily stop the press offensive: the same 1921 Presidential Decree that censors anti-socialist publications can be abused to shut down criticism against the government, even if only for a few weeks."
 socitaly.15.a: "We'll have to endure this"
 socitaly.15.b: "According to DPR 153/1921..."

 socitaly.16.t: "Massive Rallies"
 socitaly.16.d: "Thousands cheer as Mussolini speaks.\n\n\"The reactionary powers of the world are nearing their end, as proletarian Italy rises to snatch her freedom from them!\"\n\nThis is just the last of a series of massive gatherings in support of the President, which Mussolini stokes by launching bombastic speeches. As time goes on, Mussolini attracts ever larger crowds; and the larger these crowds are, the more Mussolini's words impact the public consciousness."
 socitaly.16.a: "Is this the start of a personality cult?"

 socitaly.17.t: "Support for the War Effort"
 socitaly.17.d: "With the war for the unification of Italy upon us, great outpourings of public support for the conflict are becoming commonplace; and with Mussolini being the single most outspoken supporter of the unification campaigns, the Presidency is reaping its benefits. The sense that the great Italian revolution is finally upon us is permeating all stratas of society; but many remember the unions' failure to capitalise on the collapse of the Italian Federation in 1927, and are as such moving to support Mussolini."
 socitaly.17.a: "Italy will defeat the forces of destiny!"

 socitaly.18.t: "Rise in Revolutionary Fervour"
 socitaly.18.d: "Through the last few weeks a sense of dedication to the Revolution seems to have descended upon Italian society. We are not sure how exactly this happened, but in spite of localised bouts of anti-bureaucratic sentiments this has clearly caused the general rise of support for the institutions of the Socialist Republic. As Italy wakes to a new morning, many in the country are more than willing to do their utmost to secure justice and freedom, and they know this can only be achieved through us. What remains unanswered, however, is how this public sentiment is going to go down in the political arena."
 socitaly.18.a: "The Presidency can benefit from this!"
 socitaly.18.b: "It was the unions that built this revolution!"

 socitaly.22.t: "Chetnik Activities Flare Up"
 socitaly.22.d: "While we may have completed the liberation of the rest of Italy, our own internal enemies have also apparently recently completed the unification of a wide anti-socialist front. Coming from all across the country, about a dozen independent anti-socialist militias have recently been subsumed inside the Clandestine Military Front, giving them better organisation and making them several times more effective against our government. This has coincided with a new Chetnik offensive on the home front; with significant resources committed in the reconstruction of the liberated territories, they are proving to be a dangerously effective ally of whatever external enemies we still have."

 socitaly.30.t: "The Arrest of Marshal Caviglia"
 socitaly.30.d: "When this morning the police raided a suspected FMC compound in the southern parts of Cuneo province, they didn't think they'd find much of note. Instead, among a small number of monarchist partisans they also found Marshal Caviglia, a high ranking officer who is considered to be the leader of the Chetniks.\n\nOn the run since 1919, Caviglia was one of Italy's best generals in the First World War; during the civil war he was caught off guard by Badoglio's decision to evacuate the royal government to Sardinia, and remained in Piedmont with his stranded royalist units. From there, he built the Clandestine Military Front from scratch, causing many problems to our government.\n\nWith Caviglia in our hands, the Chetniks have been dealt a lethal blow."

 socitaly.41.d: "Returning home after a scathing speech against Mussolini in Parliament, Rosselli was beaten and kidnapped by what we think are rogue Blackshirt units; he is suspected to already be dead, even though his body hasn't been found yet.\n\nThis isn't the first time a politician has been killed by Fascists, whether under Mussolini's orders or not; however, the assassination of a figure of such high profile, who has been a major political force in the Socialist Republic in the last decade, has sparked massive protests around the country. This time Mussolini has perhaps bitten more than he can chew."
 socitaly.41.a: "This isn't ideal!"

 socitaly.42.t: "Plot against Mussolini"
 socitaly.42.d: "In Rome, a secret meeting is being held today between Emilio Lussu, war veterans leader and now party secretary of the Action Party, and the military leadership of the Republic. With wide opposition to Mussolini's regime following Rosselli's assassination and a packet of increasingly authoritarian reforms seemingly about to hit Parliament, Lussu is now calling on the Army leadership to unite with the veterans in a bid to forcibly remove Mussolini from power and disarm the Blackshirts before it is too late."
 socitaly.42.a: "We are committed then"
 socitaly.42.b: "The army refuses to back the plan!"

 socitaly.43.t: "The Veterans' Coup"
 socitaly.43.d: "Unexpectedly for a movement supposedly formed out of an \"aristocracy of the trenches\", the veterans' associations today denounced the Fascist dictatorship; moving in unison with the Army, they then proceeded to order a general mobilisation of all \"able bodied men loyal to socialism and democracy\", who rapidly seized most cities in the country.\n\nBoth Mussolini and de Ambris appear to have been arrested; while the Army expected extended fighting, the complete central collapse of the FAR meant the Blackshirts moved erratically and were easily disarmed.\n\nEmilio Lussu rapidly took to the airwaves to report the fall of Fascism and his assumption of power, serving as President of a new, democratically minded regime to be built on the martyr Rosselli's legacy."
 socitaly.43.a: "For justice and liberty!"

 socitaly.44.t: "The Moral Responsibility"
 socitaly.44.d: "In a chilling speech in Parliament today, Mussolini spoke about the assassination of Carlo Rosselli. Talking about the accusations about his supposed involvement in the murder, he asked an astonished chamber whether anyone would dare invoke Article 47 of the Constitution against him and force a parliamentary inquiry; following the lack of responses, he then took \"on himself and himself only\" the \"political, moral and historical\" responsibility for the climate that led to Rosselli's assassination. He then promised that within 48 hours, the problem of \"sedition and eversives\" would be solved.\n\nEnraged, the opposition (now encompassing most of Parliament) chose to adopt the ways of ancient Rome, deserted Parliament and retreated on the Aventine Hill in protest at the Fascist regime, in order to block the Government until it would be forced to resign. They did not consider that Mussolini simply doesn't care about constitutional precedent: even with a rump Parliament, the special laws were passed, executive orders were sent out to effectively suppress press freedom within 48 hours, all opposition parties were dissolved, and all \"aventinian\" deputies were expelled from Parliament.\n\nFormer President Giulietti notably commented: \"When I was President Parliament gave me all sorts of headaches, and now they're letting him do as he pleases.\""
 socitaly.44.a: "So this is how liberty dies."

 socitaly.45.t: "The Death of the Fascist Revolution"
 socitaly.45.d: "With no moves from the Fascist government following Rosselli's death, popular indignation boiled over into a general strike against Mussolini. With the unions once again on the offensive, the President tried to utilise the full might of the Blackshirts against them.\n\nThis however exposed him to the danger of an army coup; after a meeting with Army leadership in which Mussolini may or may not have asked the Army to open fire on the unions they had previously fought for, which in turn resulted in thinly veiled putschist threats from the Army, both President and Government ended up resigning from power and leaving the country. The Army then called on former president Giulietti to be temporarily sworn in while a more permanent government solution is negotiated. Left without leadership, both FAR and Blackshirts have effectively disintegrated overnight."
 socitaly.45.a: "A fresh start"

 socitaly.46.t: "Mussolini appoints Fresh Government"
 socitaly.46.d: "While Mussolini certainly did not care about the blowback from the Rosselli Affair, he found it most useful for the flak it gave to his supposed closest ally, Alceste de Ambris.\n\nThe two have worked together for decades by now, but de Ambris was always seen as too independent for Mussolini's tastes. This was great before the Leggi Fascistissime, as it allowed for a continued nominal separation between Presidency and Government to placate the opposition. By now, he's another roadblock on Mussolini's way.\n\nAs such, de Ambris has been made to resign in relation to his failures while dealing with the Rosselli Affair, and has been replaced by an even closer ally in the person of Palmiro Togliatti, a personal friend of Mussolini since the early days of the Revolution. Though he is ideologically even more distant from the President (having led the Communist Party of Italy until it was effectively merged into the FAR in 1932), he is politically far weaker, which is the only thing that matters by now. Of course, the Blackshirts (who appreciated de Ambris' national syndicalism) don't appreciate the change."
 socitaly.46.a: "This could escalate"

 socitaly.47.t: "Mussolini Shot!"
 socitaly.47.d: "Disaster struck today, as a mad Irishwoman shot Mussolini! The President had just left a medical conference, when one Violet Gibson shot him. The woman was quickly neutralised by public security officers in the area, and Mussolini was rescued by an army of surgeons from the nearby conference; however, in the commotion of the moment it was unclear whether the President had been seriously injured, or had even been killed."
 socitaly.47.a: "Mussolini is dead!"
 socitaly.47.b: "Mussolini was merely grazed by the bullet!"

 socitaly.48.t: "The Blackshirt Putsch"
 socitaly.48.d: "Following Mussolini's assassination, Togliatti ascended to the presidency; this was completely unexpected and threw a wrench in the Fascist revolution. It appears Mussolini's legacy in the movement will be the disastrous effects of his personalist project, which appears to have seriously endangered Fascism as a whole; indeed, Togliatti has already begun building bridges with the old leninist movements and even what remains of the unions, and has appointed his friend, the known anti-fascist Luigi Longo as Prime Minister.\n\nThe FAR has immediately descended into chaos; with the old Communist Party of Italy following Togliatti, much of the movement has instead coalesced around former Prime Minister de Ambris. Right now, the Blackshirts are marching on Rome to restore the course of the Fascist Revolution; whether they will make it into the city depends on the loyalties of the Army."
 socitaly.48.a: "The Army sides with Togliatti!"
 socitaly.48.b: "Blackshirts loyal to the Revolution march on Rome!"

 socitaly.50.t: "Prisoner of the Vatican"
 socitaly.50.d: "His Holiness has locked himself within the Vatican, as previous popes did during the days of the Kingdom of Italy. He refuses to acknowledge that [SRI.GetNameDef] rules Italy. However, so long as he is locked within the Vatican, he can do little but make noise."
 socitaly.50.a: "The Pope! How many divisions has he got?"

 socitaly.51.t: "The Papal Conclave Begins"
 socitaly.51.d: "The Papal Conclave has begun! The Holy See shall come together and choose a new pope that shall support Socialism. It may take some time but they will eventually elect a new Pope who will do his part to liberate the faithful from their chains."
 socitaly.51.a: "They shall choose right!"

 socitaly.52.t: "A New Pope"
 socitaly.52.d: "After many days of debating, the Conclave has elected Achille Liènart as John XXIII."
 socitaly.52.a: "Yay!"

 socitaly.53.t: "Exiling the Pope"
 socitaly.53.d: "We have decided that the Pope has no place within our society, and that he shall be exiled. Where he goes, we don't care, but he shall not remain within Italy any longer!"
 socitaly.53.a: "Get out of here!"

 socitaly.54.t: "The Pope Arrives in [Root.GetNameDef]"
 socitaly.54.d: "The Pope has arrived in [Root.GetNameDef] today, seeking refuge from the syndicalists within Italy who have exiled him from the country. A large crowd has already come out to meet the Holy Father. He has requested more permanent residence in one of our cathedrals, until such a time as the Vatican is once more restored to freedom."
 socitaly.54.a: "Stay as long you want, Holy Father!"

 socitaly.65.t: "Birth of the Vatican City"
 socitaly.65.d: "We have recently concluded a productive meeting with the Pope. A new independent state will be created around Saint Peter's Basilica called the Vatican City that will be independent from the Republic. Meanwhile, he will accept the legitimacy of our Republic and urge Catholics worldwide to do so as well. This marks a great day for the faithful and for the Republic."
 socitaly.65.a: "Thank you, Holy Father!"

 socitaly.68.t: "Trial for Reactionary Leaders"
 socitaly.68.d: "With our victory over the reactionary forces, the leaders of the corrupt republic and the "noble" leaders of the despotic kingdoms are standing trial. Some want us to be lenient with them while others want us to be harsh and make an example of them. How shall the court rule?"
 socitaly.68.a: "Lenient. We already have our victory."
 socitaly.68.b: "Make an example of them."

 socitaly.69.t: "What to do with Royal Palaces?"
 socitaly.69.d: "With the conquest of the South, we have taken control of the territory of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, and as we bring the revolution southward, the question of what to do about the various noble and royal palaces has arisen. Some think that they should be turned into public museums, others think that the government should use them for the various ministry positions. Finally, some support the idea of giving them over to the Workers Youth League."
 socitaly.69.a: "Make them into museums."
 socitaly.69.b: "Make them government headquarters."
 socitaly.69.c: "Make them youth camps."

 socitaly.70.t: "Resistance to Secularism"
 socitaly.70.d: "As we bring the revolution to the rest of Italy, our... problematic relationship with the Church is causing problems with reintegrating the Italian people into a cohesive nation. The Catholic Church was far more powerful in the rest of Italy than in our republic. Consequently, many people are trying to resist and slowing the progress of bringing the revolution to the rest of Italy."
 socitaly.70.a: "They will learn in time."

 socitaly.71.t: "Compromise with the Church Help"
 socitaly.71.d: "As we bring the revolution to the rest of Italy, our compromise with the Church is proving helpful in bringing them to understand the principles of socialism. While there is still quite a bit of resistance among the more dedicated reactionaries, there is less than our strategists expected before the war."
 socitaly.71.a: "Thank God!"

 socitaly.72.t: "Land Reform in Southern Italy"
 socitaly.72.d: "Now that we have control of Southern Italy, it is time to bring land reform to the south and bring the revolution to the southern farmers. The package of land reforms prepared by Parliament will collectivise and give the land back to the farmers. Furthermore, local agriculture unions will be created to bring syndicalism south."
 socitaly.72.a: "Break the chains!"

 socitaly.73.t: "Industrialisation for the South"
 socitaly.73.d: "The south was never industrialised to its full potential. However, now that we have control of the south we can begin a programme to industrialise the region. This will help improve the lives of the people living there by bringing jobs and development and lowering inequality across Italy."
 socitaly.73.a: "Progress moves south!"

 socitaly.74.t: "Syndicalisation of the Economy"
 socitaly.74.d: "With Italy now united, the question has arisen as to how to bring the syndicalist economy to the rest of Italy. Some think the best way is to focus on building up the unions in the areas. Others think the best way to syndicalise the rest of the country is to focus on collective farming. A third option is worker cooperatives, especially those that serve the military, which could be the key to revolutionising the new regions."
 socitaly.74.a: "Focus on the unions."
 socitaly.74.b: "Focus on communal farming."
 socitaly.74.c: "Focus on worker cooperatives."

 socitaly.75.t: "Creation of the Provincial Juntas"
 socitaly.75.d: "In an effort to provide some form of devolved governance to the recently pacified parts of the country, Parliament has approved the formation of new provincial parliaments, or juntas, through the country. Though they lack legislative powers, the new provincial juntas will have some level of budgetary control and will act as a middle ground between the local administration and the national government."
 socitaly.75.a: "Democracy on every level of government!"

 socitaly.76.t: "Resistance to Social Changes"
 socitaly.76.d: "Since we have united Italy there has been resistance against the various social changes that we have implemented in the Republic since its founding, particularly in the case of women's rights. The changes that we have brought to Italian society will take time, but eventually, the rest of Italy shall accept them."
 socitaly.76.a: "Damn reactionaries!"

 socitaly.77.t: "The Ministry of Public Security help prevent trouble"
 socitaly.77.d: "The Ministry of Public Security have apprehended a number of reactionary traitors to the Republic operating in the south. The Ministers have made sure that no one in the rest of Italy will dare betray the revolution."
 socitaly.77.a: "The Secret Police to the Rescue!"

 socitaly.79.t: "Exhibition of the Revolution"
 socitaly.79.d: "In 1919 the Socialist Republic of Italy was proclaimed. However, the resulting civil war would leave Italy divided. Since then, we have erased these false borders, reunified Italy, and brought the revolution to all corners of our country! To demonstrate our glorious victory to the people, a grand exhibition of the revolution and our struggles and losses has been unveiled in Roma. Celebrating the struggle to bring syndicalism to all corners of Italy, it will no doubt help to educate the masses about the revolution and inform them of the glory of a reunited Italy."
 socitaly.79.a: "Long live the Republic!"

 socitaly.80.t: "Women Entering Politics"
 socitaly.80.d: "While women have been legally allowed to vote, work in politics, and sit in Parliament since the founding of our Republic, it is only now that we have unified Italy that women throughout the whole of the country enjoy these rights. Many women, especially those from the south and the northeast where the reactionaries ruled, are now taking steps to enter politics for the first time in their lives, from local unions and provincial juntas to Parliament itself."
 socitaly.80.a: "Great!"

 socitaly.86.t: "Expansion of the Christian Social Party"
 socitaly.86.d: "Formed in 1919 out of the Socialist-aligned scions of the PPI and led since its foundation by Riccardo Lombardi, the Christian Social Party has been the chief catholic political party in the Socialist Republic; even with the recent unification of the country, it appears this may not be bound to change. With many former PPI politicians joining its ranks, the PCS seems set on expanding its political influence - though whether these politicians had a genuine change of heart or are just adopting a tactic of reactionary entryism we can't say."
 socitaly.86.a: "Lombardi must keep his party on a tight leash"

 socitaly.87.t: "Futuristic Architecture"
 socitaly.87.d: "'This is the greatest absurdity of modern architecture. It is perpetuated by the greedy complicity of academies, internment camps for the intelligentsia, where the young are forced to recopy classical models onanistically instead of straining their imaginations to search for solutions to new and urgent problems: the Futurist house and city. A house and city spiritually and materially our own, in which our riotous activity can rage without seeming a grotesque anachronism.' So reads the Futurist Manifesto of architecture. Futurism as an architectural movement has recently been highly popular among the FAR. Mussolini, in particular, is a noted patron of architects building in that style."
 socitaly.87.a: "The Future is now!"

 socitaly.88.t: "Associazione Ricreativa e Culturale Italiana"
 socitaly.88.d: "The Associazione Ricreativa e Culturale Italiana, or Italian Recreational and Cultural Association, is the largest recreational society within the Republic. Founded in Florence in the 1920s, the organisation is purely secular, and its goal is to help support recreational activities for the people as well as to support solidarity amongst the citizens of the Republic. Culture that was once only the purview of the elites, such as opera, plays, and classical music, are now available for the people to enjoy. Furthermore, the Associazione supports book clubs, countryside vacations, and more through arrangements with local provincial juntas and unions."
 socitaly.88.a: "Culture belongs to the masses!"

 socitaly.89.t: "Unione Donne Italiane Congress"
 socitaly.89.d: "'We don't see why the revolution is in the hands of only half the population. We are anarchists, but we are also women and we want to make our revolution. Not have men make it for us. We don't want a struggle designed to fit the male because we'll be screwed, as always. We want to fight so that we can claim our part in the share-out. We want to make it clear that just now we're beside ourselves with joy and it would be a mistake to keep us at home knitting! We want to die! But we want to die like men, not live like servants!' So said Ada Prospero at the annual congress of the Unione Donne Italiane, the largest women's organisation in the republic. The Union's goal is dedicated to women's emancipation and liberation. Ada Prospero, in particular, supports the creation of female combat units to fight for the unification of Italy."
 socitaly.89.a: "We shall see."

 socitaly.90.t: "1937 Championship between Bologna and Torino"
 socitaly.90.d: "The 1936-1937 Series A Finale for the Italian football league championship has reached the last round. Torino playing against Bologna. The Bulls against the Greyhounds. Bologna is the clear favourite to win, as they are the current reigning champions; however, the Torino team this year is playing strong. Who shall win the championship for this year?"
 socitaly.90.a: "Who shall win, indeed!"

 socitaly.91.t: "Bologna Wins 1937 Championship game!"
 socitaly.91.d: "It was a close match, but Bologna won with a score of 2-1, remaining as the reigning champions of the Italian League. Naturally, the city of Bologna is celebrating this victory."
 socitaly.91.a: "The Greyhounds remain the champions!"

 socitaly.92.t: "Torino Wins 1937 Championship Game!"
 socitaly.92.d: "In a stunning upset, the Torino team defeated Bologna 1-0. For the first time in just under a decade, the reigning champions were defeated. The city of Torino will surely be celebrating all night after this stunning victory."
 socitaly.92.a: "The Bulls are the new champions!"

 socitaly.100.t: "The Founding of Cinecittà"
 socitaly.100.d: "Benito Mussolini unveiled the opening of Cinecittà today outside the city of Florence. Cinecittà was planned by numerous architects to be less of a film studio and more of a small cinema city. Mussolini himself was quoted as saying during the opening of the studio: 'Cinema is the most powerful weapon against Capitalism.'. Many aspiring filmmakers are already speaking with the unions of the area to see about producing films there, while some are already calling it Hollywood on the Arno."
 socitaly.100.a: "Cinema is the most powerful weapon against Capitalism!"

 socitaly.101.t: "Death of Filippo Turati"
 socitaly.101.d: "Today, the great statesman Filippo Turati has passed away at the age of 79 years old. Filippo Turati was one of the last surviving founders of the Italian Socialist Party. His strong and constant support of the rights of the workers of Italy from his earliest days has made him famous throughout the Republic. In addition to founding the Socialist Party of Italy, he was also one of the principal architects of the constitution of the Socialist Republic of Italy. The funeral in Torino was attended by visitors from nations around the world and officials from across the political spectrum, all paying their respects to the late great leader as various labour songs were sung, including Inno dei Lavoratori which he penned himself."
 socitaly.101.a: "The passing of a torch."

 socitaly.102.t: "Maggio Musicale Fiorentino"
 socitaly.102.d: "In the city of Florence, conductor Vittorio Gui has created a new festival called the Maggio Musicale Fiorentino, dedicated to performing operas and musicals free of charge for the people so that way the classics can be enjoyed by all citizens, not just the privileged elites. The opening opera for the festival was Giuseppe Verdi's Nabucco. While it is the first of its kind in Italy, Vittorio Gui has stated he hopes that the Maggio Musicale's success can be replicated in cities throughout the Republic."
 socitaly.102.a: "Opera for the People!"

 socitaly.103.t: "Enrico Fermi creates the Pisa Pile-1"
 socitaly.103.d: "Enrico Fermi has recently created the Pisa Pile-1; the world's first artificial nuclear reactor. Created with the help of students from the University of Pisa, the device may have only been capable of generating a half watt of power, but its success proves that a nuclear reactor can be built."
 socitaly.103.a: "Comrade Fermi brings progress for the Republic and for the world!"

 socitaly.104.t: "Enrico Fermi wins Nobel Prize"
 socitaly.104.d: "The physicist Enrico Fermi has recently won the Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on induced radioactivity. Fermi, who has been a professor at the University of Pisa since the civil war, has published numerous works on physics, especially relating to the new field of nuclear physics. With his Nobel Prize, the Socialist Republic of Italy can celebrate another hero of Italy and of Socialism."
 socitaly.104.a: "A hero of the Republic!"

 socitaly.105.t: "Elections in San Marino"
 socitaly.105.d: "The city-state of San Marino is one of the longest surviving republics on the Italian Peninsula. A relic from the city-state era, San Marino has survived for centuries, lasting from the Roman era all the way to the Risorgimento. In the midst of our own revolution of 1919, the Sammarinese socialists voted to desert the aristocratic Arengo of the Most Serene Republic and formed their own Chamber of Labour; this paved the way for their own independent revolution, after which they became our closest friend and ally. Today, new elections to the Chamber of Labour have been held in San Marino, with the Sammarinese Syndicalist Party once again victorious. The new Captain-Regents, Giordano Giacomini and Primo Marani, have declared that they will as always commit to our shared friendship."
 socitaly.105.a: "Greetings Comrades!"

 socitaly.106.t: "Roma Jazz Festival"
 socitaly.106.d: "With Rome once again the capital of Italy, a jazz festival has been put on by the various musical unions throughout Italy. Jazz has been within Italy since before the revolution, starting in 1904, though modern Italian Jazz draws inspiration from America. The famed American Jazz musician Louis Armstrong is the highlight of the festival."
 socitaly.106.a: "Let us enjoy the new music of a new Rome."

 socitaly.107.t: "Giro d'Italia Refounded"
 socitaly.107.d: "With Italy reunited, the Giro d'Italia can begin again. The Giro d'Italia is a cycling race that began in 1909, but the outbreak of the Weltkrieg and the ongoing political instability in Italy have altogether prevented the race from being held since 1914. The race course goes from Torino in the north all the way down to Napoli and Bari in the south up back to Milan."
 socitaly.107.a: "Let the race begin!"

 socitaly.108.t: "Fausto Coppi Wins the Giro D'Italia"
 socitaly.108.d: "Fausto Coppi has won the Giro D'Italia, setting a new record. At the age of twenty, he is the youngest cyclist to complete the race. His win has also popularised his training regime and his particular diet, which focuses on whole grains where other racers consume large amounts of red meat."
 socitaly.108.a: "Congratulations, Comrade Coppi!"

 socitaly.109.t: "Spartacus is Released"
 socitaly.109.d: "Cinecittà has released the epic movie Spartacus. Telling the story of the ancient Roman slave rebellion leader Spartacus, the movie is by all accounts an epic with a cast of thousands. Starting Gino Cervi as Spartacus and directed by Carmine Gallone, the movie has already proven a success and both with critics and the public at large."
 socitaly.109.a: "I am Spartacus!"

 socitaly.110.t: "Comrade Ines Donati"
 socitaly.110.d.ines_elected: "Ines Donati, a strong supporter of the policies of Mussolini and Bianchi, has just been elected for the rank of general in the Red Guards. She has proven to be rather popular among the soldiers, both men and women, and she will shine a beacon for all our female soldiers to follow."
 socitaly.110.d.ines_promoted: "Ines Donati, a strong supporter of the policies of Mussolini and Bianchi, has just been promoted within the Red Army. She has proven to be rather popular among the soldiers, both men and women, and she will shine a beacon for all our female soldiers to follow."
 socitaly.110.a: "Congratulations, Comrade Donati!"

 socitaly.126.t: "Syndicalist Partisans Rise Up"
 socitaly.126.d: "We've always had suspicions that there was an underground network of syndicalists preparing for the day when we and [SRI.GetNameDef] went to war. Their numbers are not overwhelming, but their appearance behind our lines is unexpected, and they have caused a fair amount of disruption throughout the country."
 socitaly.126.a: "It will change nothing"

 socitaly.127.t: "The Italian Balance Shatters"
 socitaly.127.d: "The balance on the Italian peninsula has been delicate since the end of the civil war, with [SRI.GetNameDef] maintaining a tense peace with its neighbours due to the knowledge that drawing in the French would surely bring intervention from the Germans and Austrians. Thus any conflict in Italy would need to be a self-contained one. Due to recent developments on the peninsula, however, the situation has now officially changed: the balance has been shattered."
 socitaly.127.a: "We can call for aid!"
 socitaly.127.b: "This means trouble..."
 socitaly.127.c: "I see."

 socitaly.128.t: "An Invitation"
 socitaly.128.d: "Now that all bets are off regarding the so-called 'balance' in Italy, [From.GetNameDef] has extended a formal invitation for [SRI.GetNameDef] to join the ranks of the Third Internationale."
 socitaly.128.a: "At last!"
 socitaly.128.b: "On second thought, no..."

 socitaly.129.t: "The [From.GetAdjective] Request"

 socitaly.129.b: "On second thought, no..."

 ### REVAMP FLAVOUR ###

 socitaly.130.t: "The New National Anthem"
 socitaly.130.d: "As part of our efforts in forging a new, revolutionary identity, there appeared a debate regarding a new anthem for the republic. Parliamentary officials, after a short debate period, decided on adopting 'Inno di Garibaldi' ('The Garibaldi Hymn') as the new national anthem. The decision has already been formalised with a constitutional amendment.\n\n'The Garibaldi Hymn' will further entrench the status of Giuseppe Garibaldi as Italy's national hero and cult figure. The Hero of Two Worlds commissioned the song in late 1858, as the official anthem of the Hunters of the Alps corps. The lyrics were written by poet Luigi Mercantini, to the music by Alessio Olivieri. The song became very popular during the First Risorgimento, though it became known as 'The Garibaldi Hymn' only after the Expedition of the Thousand."
 socitaly.130.a: "All'armi! All'armi!"

 socitaly.131.t: "Administrative Elections of [GetYear]"
 socitaly.131.d: "The [GetYear] elections to the local councils are different than all others in the Socialist Republic's history, as they mark the first time non-socialist parties were allowed to participate freely. This was permitted on the grounds that local parties and their candidates would support the national policies of the newly formed CGIL,regardless of their political outlook.\n\nThis accord has proven to be widely supported by the population, and the turnout at the ballots was high. The people that abstained from elections, on the most part did so because they felt their choice would contribute nothing to any potential change in Italian politics. However, voices like these were scarce.\n\nThe results have proven that the ideals of the revolution and socialism are supported by the population, with CGIL and CGIL-backed candidates winning the most seats in the most amount of councils. This is nothing new in urban provinces. However, in rural and agrarian areas there was greater diversity in the new composition of councils. Actionist and Christian-Social candidates have won the majority in several places, and the republican, liberal and even Christian conservative options enjoyed a fair amount of support. All of this just goes to show, that democracy is a value cherished and upheld among our citizens."
 socitaly.131.a: "We can, indeed, have mannerly political discourse."

 socitaly.132.t: "Union-Actionist Pact"
 socitaly.132.d: "In order to prevent further terror and savagery of the fascists, President [SRI.GetLeader] met with representatives of the Action Party, led by Emilio Lussu. The meeting's purpose was to clarify the conditions of further cooperation between the General Confederation and the Actionists, which, in the current political landscape is of utmost importance. As one of the Actionist delegates noted: \"Two sides fighting for the same ideals - freedom and democracy - must strive for unity, lest their struggle goes to nothing.\"\n\nAnti-fascist in nature, the talks have also covered other aspects, such as representation of the Action Party within the current government. The fruitful negotiations have ended with a formal cooperation agreement being signed by both parties involved."
 socitaly.132.a: "Liberty can't be compromised due to petty squabbles"

 socitaly.133.t: "Integration of Anarchist Militias"
 socitaly.133.d: "Many in [SRI.GetNameDef] celebrate today, as the final steps towards the integration of militias into the [SRI.GetAdjectiveCap] military were made today. A meeting with militia leaders and the high command was held today, during which both parties signed documents confirming that anarchist militias will now serve directly within the army of [SRI.GetNameDef], albeit with a guarantee of operational autonomy.\n\nPolitically, this decision confirms the commitments towards revolutionary action from the government. Many of the former militiamen, now soldiers, helped to establish the [SRI.GetNameDef] during the Italian Civil War, and subsequently defended the Republic's borders."
 socitaly.133.a: "How can we thank the fighters for true freedom?"

 socitaly.134.t: "Comrade Sandro Pertini Speaks"
 socitaly.134.d: "On the initiative of the General Confederation, a meeting was convened today between political activists and union leaders. Many people have taken this opportunity to speak about the importance of unity between socialist-minded individuals. Of particular interest was the speech of comrade Sandro Pertini, member of the General Confederation and personal friend of President Nenni.\n\nIn his speech, Pertini stressed the importance of 'unity among all the classes and sectors of our population, from the workers to the peasants, from the intellectuals to the soldiers; unity among all the parties and organizations of our republic.' Citing the Union of Britain and the Commune of France as examples, Pertini has pointed out that symbiosis of political and syndical activity can be possible and can net positive results in the creation of a socialist society.\n\nPertini ended his speech by saying:\n     'Freedom without social justice is a vain achievement. Can you consider truly free, someone who is hungry and in misery, who doesn't have a job? Who is humiliated because he doesn't know how to take care of his children and give them education? This is not a free man. Therefore, freedom must be paired with social justice.'\n The speech was met with praise and appreciation from all sides of the Italian socialist political landscape."
 socitaly.134.a: "Wise words from this young, rising politician."

 socitaly.135.t: "First Congress of CGIL"
 socitaly.135.d: "Today we have inaugurated the first congress of the new CGIL, the General Italian Confederation of Labour. Created as a federation of all unions, whether Catholic, Socialist or Liberal, and co-led by socialist Bruno Buozzi and catholic Achille Grandi, it will supposedly be the vehicle for the full integration of Catholics within the political life of the Republic. This couldn't have been done without the Church's acquiescence, which we'll need to repay later; but for now most are happy with the arrangement, even some former PPI politicians. Lombardi, secretary of the Christian Social Party and strong supporter of Christian socialism, publicly congratulated the government on the development."
 socitaly.135.a: "For the advancement of all workers!"

 socitaly.136.t: "Local Elections to the Chambers of Labour"
 socitaly.136.d: "In an attempt to break the local institutional power of the Church, we have chosen to expand the suffrage in local Chambers of Labour elections, and extend their powers over the locally conservative leaning rural municipalities. This effort has been relatively effective; while the Church has condemned the reform, this didn't mean much as they already refuse to recognise the Socialist Republic in general, while progressive Catholics were content with having some way to influence local governance in some minor way. Of course, the Actionists have also piled on to condemn the move as inherently anti-democratic, but they're in no position to do much about it."
 socitaly.136.a: "The advancement of Italy begins today!"

 socitaly.137.t: "The [GetYear] Elections"
 socitaly.137.d: "Elections have been held today, and results have been disappointing for all forces involved. It appears the parliamentary situation has remained virtually unchanged, with an Union relative majority but no solid parliamentary bloc able to impose itself and end the political instability. In spite of both Unions and Fascists decrying supposed rigging, it appears what should have been a pivotal moment in solving our political situation ended up being completely irrelevant. For better or for worse, the parliamentary impasse will likely only be solved after the Peninsula has been fully liberated."
 socitaly.137.a: "So the musical chairs will continue?"

 socitaly.138.t: "Rosselli Shot!"
 socitaly.138.d: "Horrible news! As he left a medical conference, President Rosselli was shot by what we believe to be a group of radical Blackshirts. The assailants were quickly neutralised by local public security, and an army of surgeons raced to rescue Rosselli - to no avail, as the multiple gunshots proved too much.\n\nThe reaction in the political world has been one of shock and horror, as we had believed political violence to have died with the Blackshirts after the first post-war elections - but it appears neither truly disappeared.\n\nPrime Minister Emilio Lussu, who was also Rosselli's second-in-command inside the Action Party, delivered an emotional speech in Parliament in memory of his friend, which ended with a prolonged applause. Shortly afterwards, Lussu was elected to succeed Rosselli as President; immediately, he sweared he would use his new powers to mold Italy in the way his predecessor would have wanted."
 socitaly.138.a: "Terrible!"

 socitaly.139.t: "The [GetYear] Elections"
 socitaly.139.d: "New elections have been held today. With the defeats of the 30s an ever fainter memory, the Unions and Union-aligned candidates have easily gained an absolute majority of seats, and reelected President [SRI.GetLeader]. This doesn't mean democratic discourse has died down, however: the Union representatives have varying ideological backgrounds and align themselves with different revolutionary factions, ensuring no government will ever be able to count on an authoritarian rock-solid majority."
 socitaly.139.a: "Through the unions, liberty!"

 socitaly.140.t: "The [GetYear] Elections"
 socitaly.140.d: "New elections have been held today. While the abolition of Union seats which Rosselli had proposed long ago hasn't been passed, the Action Party and friendly unions have given President [SRI.GetLeader] a relatively stable parliamentary majority, through which we'll be able to further democraticise the state and bring the Revolution to its natural conclusion."
 socitaly.140.a: "Our freedom, exercised!"

 socitaly.141.t: "The [GetYear] Elections"
 socitaly.141.d: "New elections have been held today. The democratically minded reforms have had their effects; with the abolition of Union seats the Trade Unions have ran as the \"Italian Section of the Workers' International\", gaining a respectable amount of the vote. The Action Party remains the strongest party; but various small opposition parties have also entered parliament.\n\nTo build a stable majority, President [SRI.GetLeader] has proposed the formation of a Popular Democratic Front of Action Party, Christian Social Party, Republican Party and sympathetic Union representatives. The natural leader of such a coalition would be Rosselli, though he himself has instead proposed general Pacciardi (who is also secretary of the Republican Party) to lead the Government instead in a show of democratic unity."
 socitaly.141.a: "The president appoints honourable Pacciardi!"
 socitaly.141.b: "The president appoints honourable Rosselli!"

 socitaly.142.t: "The New Agrarian Reform"
 socitaly.142.d: "Previous Italian reforms in the field of agriculture and land ownership, as advanced by the governments of Mussolini and his predecessors, could hardly be considered sufficient. Within the framework of so-called "colonial pacts", the supposedly enlightened trade unions oversaw the limited enfranchisement of the "backwards" peasantry. This method of land distribution is not only incredibly condescending, as it fails to recognize the inherent revolutionary potential of the Italian peasantry, but has also only been attempted in a few dozen communes.\n\nWith the rural south now under control of the socialist republic, it has become clear that a more extensive and empowering land reform programme is in order. "Colonial pacts" are to be revised or completely done away with (no matter how much the unions may object to this), and an entirely new class of small land owners shall arise. Already, the syndicalists warn that such a "petit-bourgeoisie" could easily turn against the revolution - a notion largely dismissed by the PdA."
 socitaly.142.a: "Freedom for the farmers of Italy!"

 socitaly.143.t: "The Restoration of the Presidency"
 socitaly.143.d: "Ever since the appointment of Giuseppe Giulietti's "presidential cabinet" in 1934, an extraordinary (and unconstitutional) amount of power has been vested in the presidency of the socialist republic. Now, as part of the PdA's controversial constitutional restoration, the position of the president has once more been reduced to that of a mere figurehead. Carlo Rosselli has stepped down from the post and made way for the independent Gaetano Salvemini, an agreeable compromise candidate to all parliamentary factions.\n\nSalvemini is respected by many, and for many different reasons. Be it his status as an early member of the former PSI, his nationalistic support for ventures such as Italy's entry into the Weltkrieg or his advocacy for parliamentary control over the trade union movement, there are only few who cannot find something or other which they respect about him. Additionally, many believe that his past studies in the field of Meridionalism (i.e. research into the social and economic issues of southern Italy) make him the perfect head of state for a freshly reunified Italy.\n\nOf course, this does not mean that Rosselli is entirely out of the picture. With most executive power passing back from the president to the prime minister, he has now assumed this position as the head of a provisional government, which is expected to last until the holding of new elections come next month. For Rosselli and the PdA, this restoration of the presidency to its original constitutional state represents a final political victory and the total fulfillment of their seven point manifesto, putting an end to the radical reforms of years past. Now, the republic and its reformers may finally settle down."
 socitaly.143.a: "Onwards to normalcy!"

 socitaly.144.t: "The Union-Parliamentarian Compromise"
 socitaly.144.d: "After years of low-scale conflict, the divisions between Actionists and Union leadership appear to be finally healing. The Action Party was never an anti-union movement; but its opposition to Union control of Parliament meant the two sides traded blows for some time. This appears to be coming to an end, as President [SRI.GetLeader] spoke in favour of a new electoral law which, while reducing Union seats and granting further rights to smaller more liberal groups, does indeed keep the Union seats concept - in an unexpected reversal of his party programme.\n\nSome, especially in the Action Party, aren't happy with the change; still, most welcome the newfound political peace."
 socitaly.144.a: "For socialism and freedom!"

 socitaly.200.t: "The Promotion of Leonilde Iotti"
 socitaly.200.d: "It appears our policies towards female equality are rapidly paying off, as new, young recruits are making their way into the highest ranks of the Red Army.\n\nThe newest promotion is that of the extremely young Leonilde, or Nilde, Iotti; formerly a teacher, daughter of a trade unionist, Nilde later joined the revolutionary struggle when barely 20 years old. Rapidly, she went from supporting roles to participating in active combat missions; and she rose through the ranks of the GDI.\n\nBy today, Iotti has effectively become the leader of the organisation, in spite of her still very young age, a testament to her revolutionary valour; as such, President [SRI.GetLeader] chose to formally recognise her position and granted her a commission, making her the fastest rising officer in the history of Italy."
 socitaly.200.a: "Three hurrahs for the women of Italy!"

Returning to Italy in 1904, he spent two years in military service and then became a teacher. In 1909 he left to become the secretary of the labour party in Trentino and was later arrested in 1911 for his militant opposition to the Libyan War.\n\nIn 1912 he became part of the national directorate of the PSI, though his support of Italian Intervention in the Weltkrieg got him ousted. He soon formed the Fascio Rivoluzionario d'Azione Internazionalista and joined the war effort as a soldier, being gravely wounded in 1917. The ICW saw him join d'Annunzio, De Ambris and others in forming the blackshirts - a radical paramilitary that sought to establish socialism and was militantly anti-Austrian.\n\nHe quickly rose through the ranks in the new socialist republic, advocating for a militant approach to the reunification of Italy. His rapport with Giulietti saw him become part of the government and his fascists' growth in the subsequent elections have confirmed that Italians want militant reunification.

While there, he became acquainted with the ideas of Nietzsche and Sorel, becoming deeply influenced by them.\n\nHis militant opposition to the Libyan War saw him being imprisoned, though it would soon propel him to the national directorate of the PSI. However, he would soon be ousted due to his equally militant support of Italian entry into the Weltkrieg.

Though he had the backing of the blackshirts, his uncompromising attitude led him to be isolated from government - until Giulietti agreed to a coalition. After using his newfound platform to promote his views, he became president and led Italy through the Second Risorgimento.\n\nNow having unrivaled control over the entirety of Italy, he seeks to centralise power in the figure of the president in order to root out revisionists and reactionaries alike. It appears that the age of relative socialist harmony that the SRI brought has come to an abrupt end, with blackshirt intimidation of political opponents being at an all-time high.§!"

His father's tragic death in 1911 forced him to move back to Turin, where he received a scholarship to study law, although he would have preferred philosophy.\n\nTogliatti joined the socialist party (PSI) in 1914, just before the Weltkrieg, where he favoured Italian entry on the side of the entente. He finally graduated in late 1915 and despite wanting to pursue a degree in philosophy, he joined the Red Cross due to his myopia, later fighting in the front lines. When the ICW began he joined the republican front and later the 'red' faction that emerged.\n\nUnlike many other syndicalists, he strongly promoted militarism to reunite Italy under a syndicalist flag as soon as possible. This, combined with his opposition to the chaotic syndicalist system and desire for a more centralised government, led him to sympathise with the growing fascist movement. These sympathies became a formal alliance after 1927, when the Italian Federation collapsed but the SRI failed to pounce. Pressured by Mussolini, he eventually adopted the fascist manifesto as the PCd'I's party programme and was rewarded with the position of Mussolini's second in command.\n\nWhen Mussolini was murdered, Togliatti saw the chance of creating a new direction for the movement and took it. Rebuilding bridges with the trade unions while forcing them to accept increased central control and simutaneously denouncing blackshirt excesses, his rule appears to be a radical shift from Mussolini's.

He opposed the Libyan war and got himself elected to parliament as part of the PSI in 1913. However, when the Weltkrieg began, he opposed them and called for interventionism on the entente side, alongside Mussolini.

Nenni would later describe this affair as \"generous, but humiliating\".\n\nActive in the trade union movement, he became a member of the Italian Republican Party in 1909 and got arrested in 1911 due to his opposition to the Libyan War. Sharing a prison cell with Mussolini, he struck an unlikely friendship with the young firebrand after intense arguments. When the Weltkrieg came, he volunteered to fight in the Isonzo front, being gravely wounded in 1916. During the ICW he fought for the republican cause, though was disheartened when the split between 'reds' and 'whites' happened - ultimately supporting the former due to Austrian recognition of the latter.\n\nHe became involved in the socialist newspaper 'Avanti' in the aftermath, as its special correspondant in Paris. Through this, he became heavily involved in the French political scene, becoming acquainted with figures like Marcel Cachin and Pierre Monatte. When Giulietti chose to let Mussolini into government, Nenni was hopeful due to his prior friendship with Mussolini though he quickly came to oppose the new direction.\n\nFollowing the Second Risorgimento and as part of a compromise plan brokered by French syndicalists, Nenni was supported by both the CGL and USI to become president.

In 1905 he emigrated to Argentina and became introduced to anarcho-syndicalist ideas, though his radicalism got him expelled in 1909. Back in Italy, he became involved in union organising in Carrara, Tuscany, a local syndicalist hotbed. From 1911 to 1914 his activism secured many rights for workers, such as a pension or an eight-hour workday.\n\nIn 1912 he founded the Unione Sindicale Italiana (USI), an explicitly revolutionary syndicalist organisation. When the Weltkrieg came, he saw it as an opportunity for the international proletariat to cast off the yoke of the bourgeoise but was conscripted to fight nonetheless and became a PoW in Hungary. His uncompromising demands were a large cause of the division of the republican movement in the ICW between \"whites\" and \"reds\", with him firmly in the latter camp.\n\nOnce the SRI was established, he positioned the USI as the main union in rural areas, owing to his uncompromising attitude towards the catholic church. He initially was ambivalent to an alliance with Mussolini to militarise the socialist republic, seeing it as a necessary evil. However, when it became clear that Mussolini was only interested in securing control of the state, he became the main proponent of a strategy of 'strategic cooperation', arguing that he should only be supported in actions that furthered the revolution.\n\nThe Second Risorgimento's aftermath saw him convince the more moderate CGL to support his vision of an uncompromising revolutionary attitude.

During Italy's civil war he supported the broad republican movement against the unpopular Victor Emmanuel. When the movement splintered into \"reds\" and \"whites\" he called for unity in the republican camp, seemingly unwilling to fully commit to either side. However, when the dust settled, he joined the dominant socialist republic.\n\nAfter graduating in political sciences and law in Florence and Turin respectively, he became heavily involved in the politics of the republic. There he came to dislike the immense power wielded by trade unions, which he saw as a fundamentally undemocratic way to organise a society. When the British Revolution happened, he volunteered to advise the nascent Union of Britain, helping to shape its constitution and proving that parliamentarism and socialism aren't mutually exclusive.\n\nOnce back in Italy he founded a new party, the Partito d'Azione, which was a namesake of Mazzini's  party from the prior century. It advocated for liberal social values and for parliament to take a bigger role in the running of the economy. His new party quickly became a force to be reckoned with, though he would still be viewed with distrust by other revolutionaries, especially after Mann dissolved the British Parliament.\n\nThough he didn't find much political success until the Second Risorgimento was complete, Rosselli now finds himself as the most powerful man in Italy.

Having a Redshirt father and a socialist mother, it is perhaps not surprising that he joined the socialist party in 1894. However, his time within the party was not devoid of issues - chief among them the Libyan War in which Salvemini thought the PSI's attitude towards the war was too lukewarm. However, he was convinced by Mussolini to return to the PSI in 1914, just in time for the next confrontation.\n\nSalvemini strongly supported Italian entry into the Weltkrieg on the entente side, unlike most of the PSI. When Italy finally joined, he enlisted as a volunteer but fell ill and was let go by December 1915. When Italy was defeated and the Italian Civil War began, he joined the republican front and then its socialist faction, though he took no part in any formal combat.\n\nHaving been notable in the PSI pre-war, it was easy for him to rise through the ranks of the new revolutionary society. He befriended Carlo Rosselli and was sympathetic to his arguments regarding parliamentary oversight of trade unions, but stopped short of formally joining the Partito d'Azione. Maintaining his political independence would be better in the long-term, or so he thought.\n\nAnd his gamble appears to have paid off. Now, after Rosselli's reforms to the political system, he was elected president as a compromise figure between the different factions.

Through his influence in the veteran movement, he advocated for the people (through their parliamentary representatives) to take power back from the trade unions.\n\nAfter Rosselli's tragic murder by radical squadristi, Lussu assumed the leadership of the Partito d'Azione.
