### Focuses ###
# Economic Tree #
 PRU_black_monday: "Black Monday Reaction"

 PRU_intervene_decisevely: "Intervene Decisively"

 PRU_import_substituition_effort: "Import Substitution Effort"
 PRU_import_substituition_effort_desc: "We shall work towards making sure that the goods we need are made in Peru, while using our commodities such as copper to pay for the transition. Such action, while risky, will pay off in the long run."

 PRU_consumer_goods_manufactories: "Consumer Goods Factories"
 PRU_consumer_goods_manufactories_desc: "During an economic crisis, the common people suffer the most. With their basic needs at risk, they become unproductive, angry and are more likely to rise in the name of disloyal internationalism. We must act quickly to prevent this."
 PRU_military_industrial_complex: "Military Industrial Complex"
 PRU_military_industrial_complex_desc: "The military industrial complex of our nation is in its very infancy, and mostly produces licences of outdated equipment. This situation has to change if we wish to defend our sovereignty."
 PRU_military_industrial_complex2: "Armament Industry Incentives"
 PRU_military_industrial_complex2_desc: "With a little nudge of government incentives, our industrialists can make sure our armies are as well equipped as any of our rivals'."
 PRU_infrastructure: "Infrastructure Investments"

 PRU_college_formal_edu: "Extensive College Funding"
 PRU_college_formal_edu_desc: "Our formal education system is good for South American standards, but lags behind that of Europe. We must ensure that out government can support the scientific growth of our nation in the long term."
 PRU_ports: "Port Renewal"
 PRU_ports_desc: "Renewing our ports will be a great boon to our struggling economy, and more importantly ensure that our navies and armies are well supplied."

 PRU_aluminium: "Expand Aluminium Mines"
 PRU_aluminium_desc: "Our mines of aluminium are simply too small to support our heavy industries, especially the ones we have planned ahead for the future. We must ensure that Peru is tapping its mineral potential to its fullest capacity."
 PRU_heavy_industry: "Full Economic Recovery"

 PRU_heavier_industry_desc: "Now we must spare no effort to expand and modernise our industry, for the end of this time of peace is fast approaching. We should remain on course and keep our economy in shape even in times of calm such as this."

# Expansion #
 PRU_summit: "Viva la Unión!"
 PRU_summit_desc: "The Peru-Bolivian confederation was short lived when it was first founded in 1837. Neighbouring nations saw us a threat and forced us to separate us from our Bolivian brothers. A long time has passed since those events, yet we've never forgotten the bond that once kept us together. Today, we have decided that the time is right to finally unite again with our brothers!"
 PRU_customs_union: "Onwards Together"
 PRU_customs_union_desc: "We have always been close to our Bolivian brothers. We were both colonies of Spain, we both were freed by the same heroes and we both have stood side by side many times in our history. Provided this, we can safely say that as long as we stand shoulder to shoulder in union, we will be able to face any foe, no matter how mighty, and solve any problem, no matter how daunting it might be."
 PRU_treaty_of_frienship: "A Union of True Equals"
 PRU_treaty_of_frienship_desc: "Other 'Confederations' in the world, like the Austro-Hungarian Empire, speak a lot of equality in theory yet very little of it is actually seen in practice. We don't want to be like them, and as such we will guarantee that every citizen within the Peru-Bolivian Confederation will have the same rights and responsibilities, independently of whether they were born in either of those now defunct countries."
 PRU_propose_union: "Consolidate our State"
 PRU_propose_union_desc: "Creating a confederation is no small task. The previous apparatus of state that Peru and Bolivia had have to be adjusted, coordinated and refounded in order to not only resemble the old institutions they once had, but to improve upon them and create an even better society."
 PRU_liberate_bolivia: "Liberate Bolivia"
 PRU_liberate_bolivia_desc: "Bolivia's government has very obviously lost their way, and a group of concerned citizens have formed a government-in-exile in Lima and are lobbying for a military intervention! Given how unstable the country is, the international community and our neighbours would not be alarmed by such act of aggression."
 PRU_enforce_union: "Enforce Union"
 PRU_enforce_union_desc: "Now that our negotiations are done, the Union of Peru and Bolivia will begin anew as soon as Peruvian arms liberate the country from the Syndicalist puppets that currently control it"
 PRU_pooled_officer_corps: "Pooled Officer Corps"
 PRU_pooled_officer_corps_desc: "Bolivia and Peru have many war veterans, with different experiences and views on warfare. If we were to pool our officer corps, we could achieve better results in battle drawing from their experience."
 PRU_federated_admin_focus: "Integrated Industrial Economy"
 PRU_federated_admin_focus_desc: "With the Andean Common Market in full swing, we can now start to work with a true Peru-Bolivian economy, and adapt state incentives and tariffs accordingly."
 PRU_united_army: "Army of the Union"
 PRU_united_army_desc: "The Union had until now two separate army branches; merging them is necessary to ensure our safety, and that of our Bolivian brothers. Such an act will not be poorly seen, since for the common soldier of Bolivia, their officers and structure were synonymous with incompetence."
 PRU_united_in_porpouse: "Scientific Exchange Programme"
 PRU_united_in_porpouse_desc: "The biggest universities of Peru and Bolivia have already started to work together, and perhaps the same principle could be applied to more... practical concerns of the Union."
 PRU_fedrated_admin2: "Federated Administration"
 PRU_fedrated_admin2_desc: "The administration of our Confederation is, essentially, non existent as of now. Let us establish a Confederation Cabinet in Lima, with representatives from both parts of our Union."
 PRU_fornalize_the_union_constituiton: "Formalise the Union Constitution"
 PRU_fornalize_the_union_constituiton_desc: "Our confederation has somewhat flimsy legal institutions at a national level, but that should be changed if we are to convert it into a modern nation state."
 PRU_claims_of_the_confederation: "Claims of the Confederation"
 PRU_claims_of_the_confederation_desc: "We must reinforce that we are a successor state to Bolivia, and thus we lay claim to all former Bolivian territory, even those parts we do not occupy."
 PRU_claims_on_the_amazon: "Claims on the Amazon"
 PRU_claims_on_the_amazon_desc: "According to the Treaty of Madrid, the Amazon belonged to the Viceroyalty of Peru. Brazilian land thieves and Colombian brigands have for too long stood in the way of our rightful lands!"
 PRU_get_that_horse_back: "Recover Acre"
 PRU_get_that_horse_back_desc: "Through admittedly clever diplomatic manoeuvring, Brazil stole Acre from Bolivia in the turn of the century. However, this will not stand, Acre and the rubber it contains are integral parts of the Confederation."
 PRU_antofogasta: "Reclaim Arica and Antofagasta"
 PRU_antofogasta_desc: "Chile stole so much from Peru when we were defeated in the War of the Pacific. We fought them together and lost, but now, the time has come to reclaim what is ours, peacefully... or otherwise"
 PRU_el_chaco: "Reclaim El Chaco"
 PRU_el_chaco_desc: "The Chaco, where this whole mess began. The Argentinian dogs, backed by their Paraguayan lackeys, stole so much land that is Bolivian since colonial times, it's a terrible outrage! But such mistakes can be fixed, and no enemy can stand the combined might of our Nations!"
 PRU_pastanza: "Demand Pastaza"
 PRU_pastanza_desc: "Pastaza is by all accounts part of the viceroyalty of Peru, and is under illegal Ecuadorian occupation. Since works will not each them, we must continue diplomacy by other means."
 PRU_press_border_claims: "Press our Border Claims"
 PRU_press_border_claims_desc: "Peru's natural borders must be restored, and we will use our newly modernised army to make sure that ambition becomes a reality."

## Military ##
 PRU_foreign_know_how: "Foreign Know-How"
 PRU_foreign_know_how_desc: "Our military is indeed more well trained than those of our neighbours. However, that doesn't mean there is no room for improvement, especially with so many war veterans offering their services to us in past few years."
 PRU_modern_military: "A Modern Military"
 PRU_modern_military_desc: "Peru's military is indeed capable of crushing that of all our neighbours; but that doesn't mean that it's modern in any way. A modernisation programme for our military structure may be risky, but the rewards would far outweigh said risks."

# Army #
 PRU_general_staff: "Reorganised General Staff"
 PRU_general_staff_desc: "Our General staff, victorious in border clashed with Colombia and in keeping our nation safe, is old and still clings to outdated ideas of war. They might be products of the past century, but we are about to prove that old dogs do learn new tricks."
 PRU_army_logistics: "Logistics and Army Communications"
 PRU_army_logistics_desc: "A modern army must be flexible and use new technologies and innovations. Chief among those for military use is the Radio, but also computers to cipher our communications, and Radars to watch the skies above and keep our boys on the ground safe."
 PRU_equipment_effort: "Re-Arm our Regiments"
 PRU_equipment_effort_desc: "Despite our élan and tactical skill, our boots on the ground still have fairly outdated equipment. In fact, for many, even their own clothes are either old or rentals! We must make sure our army is refitted to a higher standard of quality."
 PRU_support_effort: "Support Battalion Drills"
 PRU_support_effort_desc: "Gone by are the days where sheer numbers would win wars. Now, even the smallest specialist brigade can mean the difference between a resounding victory and an utter defeat."
 PRU_tank_effort: "Tank Experiments"
 PRU_tank_effort_desc: "Tanks are a still somewhat new invention, and some still doubt their true potential. We do have some officers who don't, and they request our support to make sure our armoured corps are a well oiled machine of conquest!"
 PRU_extensive_bellic_incentvies: "Militarist Lobbying"
 PRU_extensive_bellic_incentvies_desc: "Our industrialists are now actively lobbying the government for an increased defence budget. Perhaps, if we were to listen to their proposals, we could get better deals and ensure our forces are well supplied."
 PRU_production_effort: "Production Effort"
 PRU_production_effort_desc: "With their interests defended, our nation's military and industrialists now can fully realise the potential of their alliance and make sure our army never runs out of fresh supplies."
 PRU_hegemon_of_the_andes: "Hegemon of the Andes"
 PRU_hegemon_of_the_andes_desc: "Our army truly dwarfs that of our neighbours, and we know it. They know it. Everybody knows it."
 PRU_mountain_training: "Mountaineer Brigades"
 PRU_mountain_training_desc: "It's not difficult to train mountaineers in Peru, the mighty Andes Mountains are the defining feature of our geography! We must, however, ensure that their training is in par with those of the Great Powers, to ensure our safety."
 PRU_airland_training: "Parachute Training"
 PRU_airland_training_desc: "It's one thing to teach a man how to use a parachute. It's another entirely to do so to thousands of men, and make sure that they are always combat ready after landing!"
 PRU_coastal_operations: "Coastal Operations"
 PRU_coastal_operations_desc: "The nature of the Pacific coast of South America makes conventional invasions a difficult matter, especially in Chile. Perhaps a better option would be to use our control of the seas and enact amphibious invasions of strategic points along the coastline."
 PRU_an_army_of_movement: "An Army of Movement"
 PRU_an_army_of_movement_desc: "Some military experts say that Modern War is going to be about fast encircling actions and mechanised pincers, and full integration between land and air forces. The officers who support this notion have asked us to officially support their plans to revise our strategic and tactical directives."
 PRU_mechanization_mobility: "Mechanisation & Mobility"
 PRU_mechanization_mobility_desc: "A key aspect of the doctrine we will adopt will be the fast moving forces that will ensure our victory. And no, we can't use horses, so we'll need a fully mechanised, combat ready infantry force."
 PRU_fast_and_furious: "Fast Offensives"
 PRU_fast_and_furious_desc: "Our armies will strike in quick and decisive fashion; forced march drills and driving shift training are now among the standard army exercises. Only by outmanoeuvring our foes we can truly ensure victory."
 PRU_localized_pushes: "Localised Pushes"
 PRU_localized_pushes_desc: "A key aspect to modern war are encirclements. Such encirclements are done by surrounding an enemy force with small forces, or pincers, while the main army prevents them from retreating. We must be sure our capacity to actually capitalise on openings and to perform armoured spearheads is indeed as good it could possibly be."
 PRU_operational_integrity: "Operational Integrity"
 PRU_operational_integrity_desc: "Some military experts say that Modern War is going to be about grand encircling actions on a strategic level, and careful logistics planning. The officers who support this notion have asked us to officially support their plans to revise our strategic and tactical directives"
 PRU_battleline_planning: "Flexible Battleline Planning"
 PRU_battleline_planning_desc: "No battleplan survives contact with the enemy, and flexibility and adaptability will be key if our offensives are to succeed."
 PRU_general_offensive_planning: "Offensive Planning Focus"
 PRU_general_offensive_planning_desc: "A good plan is a plan that takes into accounts all factors, including the less obvious ones. Making sure our officers know battleplans are a complex matter that must be carefully studied will take effort, but will improve our army's combat efficiency."
 PRU_stop_enemy_pincers: "Stop Enemy Pincers"
 PRU_stop_enemy_pincers_desc: "Although tanks are not as common sight in South America, that fact only makes it more likely that enemy spearheads will be armoured, since they will spare no effort for their success. Thus, we must be prepared with state of the art Anti Tank equipment."
 PRU_apply_lessons: "Professional Army Doctrines"
 PRU_apply_lessons_desc: "Our officers now fully grasp the goals and methods we have laid out for our military. We are more than ready for war, if it comes."

# Navy #
 PRU_high_admiralty: "Peruvian High Admiralty"
 PRU_high_admiralty_desc: "Our navy has its issues, but it's a source of pride no doubt. If we are to keep our largest cities safe, we must control the seas, and our High Admirals request government intervention to improve the situation of the Peruvian navy."
 PRU_destroyers: "Submarine Hunters"
 PRU_destroyers_desc: "Small, fast ships will ensure that our civilian and capital ships are safe from cowardly U-Boat offensives."
 PRU_cruiser: "Cruiser Renewal"
 PRU_cruiser_desc: "Our cruisers are, well, pretty much museum pieces. Not much can be done to sugarcoat how vastly outdated these ships are. A renewal is sorely needed."
 PRU_fleet_renewal: "Dockyard Renewal"
 PRU_fleet_renewal_desc: "Our docks and ports are not fit for a true navy, and cannot even dream of working with modern efficiency. We must change this."
 PRU_fleet_expansion: "Shipyard Investments"

 PRU_bb: "Flagship Effort"

# Air #
 PRU_air: "Andean Skies"
 PRU_air_desc: "Flying between high mountains and strong wind currents is no mean feat, and our pilots are rightfully proud of their skills. But our planes are old, and our tactics, outdated"
 PRU_fighters: "New Fighter Models"
 PRU_fighters_desc: "Keeping control of the skies will be fundamental for war to be successfully waged in the future. Our command over the skies of the Andes is currently absolute, but for how long if we become complacent?"
 PRU_bomber: "New Bomber Models"
 PRU_bomber_desc: "Making sure we can take the fight to our enemy is the charge of our Bomber Squads, but they request newer models that can unleash larger payloads and move faster."
 PRU_CAS: "Dive Bomb Training"
 PRU_CAS_desc: "Close air support bombing is dangerous business, and without proper training it can take both the pilot and the aircraft from us"
 PRU_air_drills: "Aerial Drills"
 PRU_air_drills_desc: "Practice makes perfect, and our air force is nearing that point with constant drills and combat exercises. We will rule the skies!"

 PRU_country_intro_header: "Peru in 1936"
 PRU_country_intro_content: "Although factually independent since 1821, Spain recognised the autonomy of her former colony not until 1871 when a peace between the countries was struck after a conflict of the two countries over the Chinchain Islands. An alliance with Bolivia drew the country from 1879 to 1883 in a border conflict between Chile and Bolivia in the Atacama Desert (Saltpetre War). During the war Peru lost her provinces of Tarapacá, Arica, and Tacna. British and U.S. financial circles exploited the opportunity, stripping the weakened Peruvian state of their state railroad, nullifying Peru's debts in exchange.\n\nAfter the Weltkrieg, Peru's democracy was threatened by the coup of Augusto Leguía in 1919. While the APRA was forming in 1924 in Mexico, Leguía's government was put to the test by the Wall Street Crash of 1925. After 11 months of failed reforms to combat the crisis, riots started, made up by workers with Aprist support. Fearing a socialist revolution, the military stepped in and overthrew Leguía, led by lieutenant colonel Luis Miguel Sánchez Cerro. Leguía was judged and executed for various crimes against the Peruvian state 4 months later.\n\nSánchez Cerro was initially not well received, but events in 1929 and 1930 propelled his popularity: putting down an Aprist revolt and winning a war against Colombia. As his party, the Unión Revolucionaria, continues to cement its rule, the democratic parties constantly lobbying for elections, and the Aprists waiting for their chance, what will happen to Peru?"

 pru.30.d: "The war with Ecuador has been a spectacular failure. They still control most, if not all, of their territory, while also starting to occupy Peruvian land. Many of our generals have come to us, begging us to sue for peace with the Ecuadorian government. Some of our spies in their government have even warned us that this may be the only chance we have to gain peace, for as the Ecuadorian military achieves victory after victory, their government grows bold, and will be less willing to accept peace with our government at all. Perhaps it is time to end the death."

 pru.115.t: "Death of Óscar Benavides"
 pru.115.d.leader: "Our great Caudillo Óscar Raimundo Benavides Larrea has died of natural causes. The whole nation mourns him, while his successor, the more radical and very racist Manuel Odria, takes his place to lead us into the future."
 pru.115.d.socialist: "One of our previous oppressors, Óscar Raimundo Benavides Larrea, has died of natural causes. While he was an enemy of the revolution and committed many atrocities against Peruvian socialists, some still mourn the man that ruled this country during this difficult time. The man that took control of his scattered clique is Manuel Odria, a most despicable man whose racism cannot be understated."
 pru.115.d.default: "Óscar Raimundo Benavides Larrea has died due to natural causes. Even though he was not Peru's best leader, he was able to keep the nation stable while also restoring elections, which indirectly lead to our ascension to power. His direct successor, Manuel Odria, is ideologically radical and bears a grudge against the native people."
 pru.115.a: "An era has ended."

 pru.116.t: "Death of Luis Mauricio"
 pru.116.d: "Today during a skirmish in Barrios Altos between urristas and aprists, a young urrista by the name of Luis Mauricio was killed by a bullet. He was the son of an old family of oligarchs. To revenge him, his fellow urristas killed the aprist militants. This case shocked the Liman society, and the urristas in the congress proposed a public funeral for Mauricio. Our staff suggests to avoid the public funeral to not anger the common man, but that might alienate Riva Agüero..."
 pru.116.a: "Allow the public funeral."
 pru.116.b: "Let them hold an inner ceremony in their party."

 pru.117.t: "La Piedra Cansada"
 pru.117.d: "Today, our intelligence agency informed us about the publishing of a book by a Peruvian author exiled in Chile, Cesar Vallejo. The novel consists of a drama set during the colonial times about two indigenous miners and how they're exploited by the church and the colonial administration. The novel has strong criticism against aristocracy and religion. While the book is banned, it has managed to infiltrate the populace through illegal distribution."
 pru.117.a: "A small piece of propaganda won't affect us!"

 pru.118.t: "The New South American Hegemon"
 pru.118.d: "We have achieved what many thought to be impossible, a goal so ambitious that many world powers would never have believed could be done. Peru-Bolivia has restored itself to its former glory, reclaiming lost lands from its neighbours and cementing its place in the history books. While it may take decades for our recent conquests to accept our rule, our lifelong reign as the sole hegemon of South America is all but assured.\n\nNow, our task is to defend and develop what we have retaken in order to ensure that there is no foe capable of surpassing our greatness."
 pru.118.a: "Perhaps we should restore the title of 'Supreme Protector' as well..?"

 pru.1000.t: "Peru's Revolution"
 pru.1000.d: "Peru has fallen to revolution fallowing the Caudillo winning the election, and is now willing to join us in the liberation of the workers of the world. We really don't have many reasons to deny their entry as it could work as a start to revolution in South America, but denying their entry is always an option."
 pru.1000.a: "Of course, accept their entry."
 pru.1000.b: "Tell them they're denied."

 pru.1001.t: "Into the Internationale"
 pru.1001.d: "The Commune of France has accepted us into the Internationale, expecting us to uphold the revolution within South America. Together, we shall liberate the workers of the world."
 pru.1001.a: "For the revolution."

 pru.1002.t: "Outside the Internationale"
 pru.1002.d: "For reasons we do not know, the Commune of France has denied our entry into the Internationale. We'll have to hold out on our own within South America."
 pru.1002.a: "Disappointing..."

 pru.1003.t: "Assassination of Sánchez Cerro!"
 pru.1003.d: "Peruvian President Luis Miguel Sánchez Cerro was shot yesterday morning at the Hippodrome of Santa Beatriz while returning from a review of recruits going to fight in the war with Ecuador. The assassin, allegedly a supporter of the illegal socialist party APRA, managed to breach a police cordon and fired several shots into the President who was sitting in the back of an open car. Sánchez Cerro was immediately transported to a nearby Italian hospital, but he confirmed was dead 15 minutes later.\n\nIn the ensuing succession turmoil the Constitutional Congress elected general Óscar Benavides as interim president. In his address to the congressmen he made a promise:"
 pru.1003.desc_dictatorship: "$pru.1003.d$ elections will be held after the APRA threat is finally eliminated."
 pru.1003.desc_elections: "$pru.1003.d$ elections will be held as soon as possible to pacify the country."

He was exiled to Bolivia in 1917, but would return to Perú in 1925, joining up Mariategui in Moquegua as the first group of left-wing indigenist thinkers was formed. When Mariategui finally died in 1930 in Chile, Churata was appointed by his friend in his dying wishes as the leader of the 'Frente Tupacamarista'. In his new role as leader, he'd later gather in 1931 with Raul Haya de la Torre and Alfredo González Prada in order to form a United Front from which bring about the Peruvian revolution.

There he met Manuel Gonzalez Prada, whose anarchist thoughts influenced the young Raul. He joined several protests against the Leguía regime, which would decide to get rid of him by granting him a scholarship to France. However, this move would backfire on Leguía, as the revolutions in Europe would influence young Raul and his friend, Mariategui, towards Syndicalist ideals.\n\nHe would go to Mexico in 1924, and with other Peruvian syndicalist exiles formed the 'Alianza Popular Revolucionaria Americana' or 'APRA'. The APRA would focus on pan-Americanism (or as Raul liked to call it, 'Indo-Americanism') and fighting imperialism and the bourgeois oligarchy that had settled in the continent. He'd return to Perú in 1925, settling in the north of the country with his fellow Apristas. In 1929, Raul led the Trujillo takeover, when APRA forces took over the city and proclaimed a Trujillan commune that would be lead by Raul, and executing the local garrison. When the revolt was crushed, he managed to escape to Chile, where he'd join forces with Churata and González Prada in order to strengthen the APRA for a new revolution in 1931.\n\nNow that Raul Haya de la Torre leads Perú, he'll bring about his dream of a worker's utopia for Perú, whatever the cost may be.§!"

After losing his father early, the burden of his upbringing fell on his mother and uncle Belisario Ravines, a hero of the War of the Pacific and former prefect of Cajamarca during the reign of Nicolás de Piérola. In 1914 Belisario was a major figure in the Llaucán Massacre, where he ordered the killing of between 200 and 400 protesting hacienda workers against rent increases. This incident left a strong impression on the young Eudocio. In March 1917 he moved to Lima, where, thanks to a friend of his uncle, he found a comfortable job allowing him to devote his evenings to reading and self-education. In 1919 he began to earn enough to move his mother and sisters to the capital.\n\nHe entered into politics in 1923, when, after organising a strike, he was arrested and expelled from the country. In exile he met Víctor Raúl Haya de la Torre and became one of the founders of the APRA.

However, Benavides managed to organise a successful mutiny in the ship that transported them, escaping to Central America, where he'd support Sánchez Cerro's uprising and later taking an important role in Sánchez Cerro's government.\n\nWith Sánchez Cerro's death, Benavides took advantage of the anarchy that ensued and became Cerro's successor, suspending elections and becoming Perú's new Caudillo. Benavides has adopted the motto 'Order, Peace and Work', rewarding generously displays of loyalty and punishing severely any display of dissent...§!"

Even as a child, while at school, he claimed to his mates he would be president of the republic. But he first chose a military career as his career.\nIn 1906 he entered the Chorrillos Military School, and by 1914 he actively participated in the coup against President Billinghurst, being wounded while taking a machine gun with his bare hands, which left him without two fingers and with the nickname \"El Mocho\" (Mutilated). He subsequently spent several months abroad as a counsellor, where he studied languages intensively. Upon his return he was assigned to various regiments, where he consistently proved himself a capable officer, but not always politically reliable. In 1922, after the rise of Leguía to power, he rebelled against the government, but failed to make any successes and was imprisoned on the island of Taquile on Lake Titicaca, and then in the famous prison on the island of San Lorenzo. After his release, he spent some time trading coal, but soon reconciled himself to the regime and was given a position as assistant to the Minister of War and battalion chief, which he had to pacify first.\n\nIn 1926, however, Sánchez Cerro finally had the chance to fulfil his dream and led the army to overthrow Leguía. Forming his own party, Unión Revolucionaria, he easily won the election and became the legitimate president of Peru. His popularity further increased after his victory over Colombia. Unfortunately, his popularity is now steadily declining due to increased Aprists activity and general dissatisfaction with his despotic and sometimes authoritarian rule.§!"

His first political move was to write an article criticising Leguía's government in that same year, for which he was arrested, triggering the first ever student protest in the history of Perú, which demanded Agüero's release. Agüero was released, where he became a teacher in San Marcos, but when Leguía took over the government in 1919, Agüero wrote a manifesto defending the constitutional order and left in a self-imposed exile towards Europe.\n\nThat travel to Europe changed him, as he was forced to witness the European recovery from the Weltkrieg, as well as the Syndicalist uprisings. It's in these circumstances that he meets Costanzo Ciano and other ANI leaders, whose far-right philosophy began influencing the once liberal Agüero. He returns in 1927 to Peru, after Cerro deposed Leguía, and began working as a history professor at the 'Pontificia Universidad Catolica'. He at first saw in Cerro just another dictator, but a meeting he had with the Caudillo changed his mind, as his experience in Europe and relation with prominent thinkers like Ciano and Carlés quickly turned him into a friend and close advisor of Sánchez Cerro. Although the hispanist ideals Agüero had were too extreme for Cerro, he was named head of ministers. Now that Agüero is in power, he'll try to take Perú in a radical new direction and return the old glory of the Virreynato back to Perú.§!"

His father graduated as a lawyer in 1908 from the 'Universidad de Arequipa' and would go to Puno, Perú, where he began fighting for better rights for natives and created an alphabet in which natives could write Aymara, Quechua and Spanish, helping the native population to improve its literacy rates as these languages conflicted with the latin alphabet. Reynaldo became involved in French émigré circles and was influenced by the writings of Charles Maurras.

He accompanied Sánchez Cerro in his tour through Arequipa, Puno, Cusco and Ica, and would later become deputy for the UR. After the resign of Francisco Lanatta, Flores becomes the president of the council of ministers. During his time as president of the council, the crews of the Peruvian navy ships 'Almirante Grau' and 'Coronel Bolognesi' mutinied with apparent APRA influence. While Flores didn't believe the crews deserved the death penalty, the martial court determined they were traitors and had to die, so he came to the island of San Lorenzo with the prisoners, where he'd lead the execution personally. It is said that Flores himself forced each sailor to dig his own grave before being shot, earning him a reputation for cruelty in the UR.\n\nFlores became a close follower of Agüero, although he considered the latter to be too conservative in his approach against the APRA.
