 CHL_air2: "Aerial Production"
 CHL_air2_desc: "The sudden cut of funding for the air force is perhaps a key factor why it joined us in the Revolution; now we should take the utmost care to ensure that our airplanes are both modern and well cared for. Thankfully, we have comrades from the Union of Britain who can me most helpful in this endeavour."
 CHL_fighters: "Fighter Effort"
 CHL_fighter2: "Close Air Support Craft"
 CHL_fighter3: "Long Range Aircraft Experiments"
 CHL_fighters_desc: "Aerial supremacy is key in modern war, of that few can doubt; But the advent of new mechanisms of war means that our old biplanes are not suitable for defending the skies of Chile anymore."

 CHL_fighter3_desc: "Our country is, from an strategic standpoint, too long in a North-South axis to be properly protected by common fighter craft. We must ensure, with the help of our comrades in Europe, that our Air Force has planes capable of long autonomous flights."
 CHL_airdoc: "Aerial Strategy"
 CHL_airdoc2_desc: "The engagements themselves are also to be analysed, and our few planes cannot be foolishly thrown away. Careful studying and manoeuvres will be key in our coming victory."
 CHL_airdoc_desc: "Aerial engagements are quick and brutal affairs; and it pays to plan for them and strategic missions beforehand. What will be the focus of our air force in the war to come, our general staff must decide."

 CHL_highseas: "A High Seas Navy"
 CHL_highseas_desc: "The decisive battles of the wars to come will be fought on deep waters, away from coastal support. In order to make sure our navy is ready for this crucial engagement against a certain undisclosed enemy to the West, we will make drills, exercises and planning efforts."

 CHL_arms_of_the_revolution: "A Nation Under Siege"
 CHL_arms_of_the_revolution_desc: "The biggest danger to Chile is not internal, but that of the resurrecting counter-revolutionary Argentina.

We will not let happen!"
 CHL_mobility_potential: "Mobility Potential"
 CHL_mobility_potential_desc: "Many have heard ideas and plans about how modern warfare will be a fast-paced, mechanised affair; even if that may not turn out to be the case, we do not have the manpower to engage in traditional war with Argentina and the other imperialists. We will do our best to improve the mobility of our forces."
 CHL_communard_expertise: "Foreign Armour Expertise"
 CHL_communard_expertise_desc: "Mobility has always been of great import on the battlefield. With developments in motorisation and mechanisation, a new generation of officers the world over have begun to promote more aggressive styles of warfare utilising those new technologies. We should hire such men from abroad."

 CHL_army_rearmament: "Army Rearmament"
 CHL_army_rearmament_desc: "While the army is not underpaid or underfed as it used to be before the Revolution, it is still poorly equipped. Let us attend to the needs of our officers and ensure our Army can fight off any threats."

Passes, peaks and hillsides must not be garrisoned with fresh recruits, but with elite specially trained regiments who are ready for the harsh reality of mountain life."
 CHL_andean_strategy: "Andean Strategy"
 CHL_andean_strategy_desc: "The so-called Santiago Line will be the last stand of our nation, if Argentina overpowers us and crossed the Andes.

 CHL_drilled_military: "Renew Strict Drill Standards"
 CHL_drilled_military_desc: "Chile's military was once known as the 'South Prussia', and its performance and discipline were the envy of all. Now, with its role as the vanguard of the people fulfilled, it can turn its gaze upon those would hurt our countrymen, and the ideas we stand for."

 CHL_total_desc: "Labarca and the Mosleyists know that only a strong government can keep Chile safe against its many enemies. The people now are safe!"
 CHL_permanet: "Permanent Revolution Doctrine"
 CHL_permanet_desc: "Something that Labarcists defend, the idea that the Revolution can only be maintained by force, for reactionary elements cannot be reasoned or bargained with. The Proletarian Dictatorship will be permanent until it's no longer necessary."
 CHL_directrule: "Centralised Planning"
 CHL_directrule_desc: "All decisions about he economic and state well being must be consulted with Central Committees in Santiago. To do otherwise would be clumsy at best, treason at worst."
 CHL_chairmanmega: "Extend Chairman's Powers"
 CHL_chairmanmega_desc: "The Chairman still requires approval from the Syndicalist Congress for many actions, something that greatly cripples the capacity of our state to react. We must change this!"
 CHL_commisariats: "Revolutionary Commissars"
 CHL_commisariats_desc: "Now, we can have appointed officers in army units and factories, ensuring both loyalty and hard work at all times, for an idle mind is an invitation to counter-revolution."

 CHL_clean: "A Totalist Government"
 CHL_clean_desc: "Totalism implies total loyalty, and total devotion to the revolutionary ideals we hold on to so dearly, no matter the cost. 'Moderates' have no place anywhere near serious decision making."

 CHL_getcounterrev_desc: "Many officers are still traditionalist and archaic, who might as well be theocrats with their sad devotion to ancient religions. But their priests did not grant them clairvoyance to conjure up an escape from the Revolutionary Courts!"

 CHL_extended: "Extend CSC Powers"
 CHL_extended_desc: "The Congress of Syndicates is now a true house of democracy, unlike the parliament of the Old Republic. However, it is still quite powerless in many matters, a relic of our over-centralising presidentialist past. We must remedy this!"

### Intro Screen ###
 CHL_country_intro_header: "Chile in 1936"
 CHL_country_intro_content: "After the Saltpetre War 1879 - 1883 in which Chile received the Peruvian saltpetre provinces Tarapacá and Arica in addition to the Bolivian coastal region of Antofagasta the country had command over vast copper deposits and monopolised the world trade in saltpetre. A phase of economic prosperity was initiated, supported by the high demand for saltpetre at the beginning of Weltkrieg. However, the chemical processes devised during that war to artificially produce saltpetre rendered Chile's deposits worthless.\n\nWorsening economic circumstances, together with the growth of the population increased social crisis. Workers and unions gained political influence, especially under the disastrous rule of Carlos Ibañez Del Campo, during which Chile bankrupted, in 1931. Shortly afterwards. Ibañez was deposed, and the navy and most of the army mutinied, and with the support of the people, and the arrival of reinforcements from the long exiled Marmaduke Grove arriving from the Union of Britain, the Syndicalist Republic of Chile was proclaimed.\n\nAfter 5 years of rebuilding under the first council, led at least nominally by Arturo Puga, the republican economy recovered greatly, and a military build-up has begun. Now, with Argentina's rhetoric becoming increasingly aggressive, the well respected Marmaduke Grove, military man veteran of two revolutions oceans apart, is at the helm of rebuilding the republic. However, not all Chileans are as hopeful for the future as the syndicalist leaders are..."

 chl.1.d: "Our young republic now holds its second central elections; much fanfare and celebration is held, and 3 main candidates attempt to sway the votes of the workers. Blest Riffo, a long time fighter of worker's rights during the worst times of repression, is favoured both by Marmaduke and most of the mainline Syndicalists, and thus the majority of voters. Against him runs the young Salvador Allende, whose very opposition broad coalition us as diverse as it is rather un-cohesive, but they promise a better future for Chile. Also, with rather minute chances, the Totalists, influenced by the ideas of European Socialists like Mosley and Beira, are running with Labarca as their frontman. What will the people decide?"

Gabriela Mistral leads the Pacto de Calais, a broad coalition of intellectuals and politicians who defend the Republic's central government, but unlike Carlos Contrera Labarca's Totalists, do see regular elections and personal freedoms as of something of the utmost importance. The Orthodox Syndicalists are led by Pablo Neruda, yet another very accomplished writer and poet. But who will emerge as the dominant party in Chile?"
