 SOM_unitedinwill_desc: "So long as the Somali nation and its people are united—in spirit, in determination, and in outlook—we can ensure that no goal is too big for us to conquer. In order to attain that ideal, however, we must first focus on resolving the problems within the country..."

 SOM_forthegreatergood: "Establish the Hangash"

 SOM_put_down_the_lion_desc: "There are few things more pitiful than an old, sickly lion. Once a powerful empire, that had harboured the faithful in their hour of need, Abyssinia is now little more than an amalgamation of scheming dukes who play dress-up and impersonate German officers. It's high time we put this once grand empire to rest."

 SOM_civilianindustry: "Civilian Industry"
 SOM_civilianindustry_desc: "Our people are now able to afford new goods, imported from foreign nations. However, the cost of importing goods is far too expensive, especially for some luxury items.

 SOM_constructechnics: "Foreign Construction Methods"
 SOM_constructechnics_desc: "The reformation of any nation is never an easy job. While the task may be arduous, foreign expertise and skilled personnel will be required if Somalia is to be dragged into the age of advancement."

 SOM_consumergoods: "Foment Consumer Goods Market"
 SOM_consumergoods_desc: "Our consumer goods industry is severely limited due to low demand locally. By producing cheaper goods and exporting produce to nearby regions, we can ensure our industries will grow at an unprecedented rate."

 SOM_techslot2: "School of War"
 SOM_techslot2_desc: "War is, oftentimes, a sporadic event which means we must plan and prepare for every single scenario. While our generals receive constant tweaks and updates to their battle plans, so must our engineers and planners who can help us best ready ourselves for any oncoming war."

 SOM_higherlearning: "Expand Higher Learning Funding"
 SOM_higherlearning_desc: "Higher education within Somalia is still lacking, and if our nation is to be taken seriously among the global academia we must begin heavy investments, the opening of more universities outside of Mogadishu, the education and re-education of our militia officers, and the guarantee of every region within the nation possessing a higher learning institution."

 SOM_royalarmy: "The Royal Army"

 SOM_reformsreorgan: "Begin Army Reform"
 SOM_reformsreorgan_desc: "The reformation of any army is always easier said than done. The first obstacle we face is where to focus our efforts. In addition, the question of centralising the army or allowing it to retain a degree of autonomy is vital to its modernisation. Of course, such a decision would have political consequences, no matter what we choose, which is why further efforts must be preceded by sweeping political reforms."

 SOM_arm_militias: "Arm Local Militias"
 SOM_arm_militias_desc: "Every constituent state will now require its own militia which will fall under our centralised control. The clans will be granted weapons in exchange for providing us with manpower."

 SOM_militia_training: "Train the Army of the People"

 SOM_hobyoyards_desc: "Alongside his studies, the Sultan of Hobyo has also focused his attention on the sea and has made grand investments into the shipyards within the area.

More is planned, of course, but in order to advance further the Sultan requires federal assistance."

 SOM_logistics_effort: "Logistics Effort"

 SOM_magarteenartillery_desc: "The Sultan of Majarteen, with his infinite wisdom, knew that our safety was transitory and, thus, had invested much into the creation of an armoury which is able to produce the finest modern artillery. Based on Turkish designs, and funded through the Sultan's own pocket, we cannot let this opportunity go to waste. Let us all join forces to defend Somalia!"

 SOM_mobility: "Mobile Army Doctrine"

 SOM_onkod_warfare_desc: "Somalia's militia has long been our backbone and our pride.

We must secure Somalia's future through any means necessary."

 SOM_acquire_tanks: "Acquire Tanks"
 SOM_acquire_tanks_desc: "Tanks are costly, hard to produce, and infinitely harder to properly maintain. However, on the off chance that we can produce them, they will be an invaluable asset in any future wars and will give us a definite advantage over our enemies."

 SOM_factory2: "Military Industrial Capability"
 SOM_factory2_desc: "Our factories must operate at full industrial capacity, producing military goods to better supply and equip our army. After all, supply is an extremely crucial factor of any sort of warfare and can determine the outcome of any war or, on a smaller scale, any battle."

 SOM_equipment: "Refit Infantry Equipment"
 SOM_equipment_desc: "In order to convince our men that the army has truly undergone a reformation, we must provide them with new boots, new guns, and better rations in order to provide evidence of the effectiveness of our reforms."

 SOM_modern_guns: "Modern Guns"
 SOM_modern_guns_desc: "Artillery pieces and handguns within our possession are relics from the Weltkrieg era, some even dating back to an age far before the war itself. New equipment is required to modernise the armed forces."

 SOM_military_doctrine_effort_desc: "War is raging worldwide, with countries pit against one another in a desperate struggle for victory.

 SOM_support_companies: "Support Companies"
 SOM_support_companies_desc: "Support companies will most certainly be crucial to future war efforts and are a must-need for any modern fighting force.

 SOM_inthenavy: "Between the Seas"
 SOM_inthenavy_desc: "Somalia stands at a crucial point in its history and its strategic location cannot be brushed aside. If we manage to build up and organise a powerful navy and a proper air force, we may find ourselves in control of the world's busiest shipping lane."

 SOM_royalnavy: "The Royal Navy"
 SOM_royalnavy_desc: "Currently, our warships are little more than outdated Weltkrieg era ships, sold to us by the great powers.

 SOM_buildup: "Naval Buildup"
 SOM_buildup_desc: "We will begin a large-scale naval build-up programme to help aid us in creating more ships. While this will prove to be a costly endeavour, hopefully, it will grant us much reward in the near future."

 SOM_strategicpatrols: "Strategic Patrols"
 SOM_strategicpatrols_desc: "By using our ships to patrol and exert control over the shipping lanes near the Somali coastline, we can ensure that our influence is recognised by all who dare sail in the Horn. In addition, by doing so, we can more easily defend and control the flow of supplies."

 SOM_constrycnava: "Construct Shipyards"
 SOM_constrycnava_desc: "Pouring funds to upgrade our shipyards is vital in making our navy self-sufficient, improving the quality of our ships, and increasing our naval production capabilities."

 SOM_hunterpacks_desc: "We shall set up raiding parties to ensure that no enemy of Somalia will escape the Horn unscathed!"

 SOM_controlofnearbyseas: "Wrest Control of the Seas"
 SOM_controlofnearbyseas_desc: "Wresting control of the Horn and the Red Sea will be a gruesome effort but well worth the gamble if we are to do so successfully. First, however, plans must be made to secure the area..."

 SOM_flagshipexperiments: "A Flagship for Somalia?"
 SOM_flagshipexperiments_desc: "International observers may see Somalia as a small and unimportant nation that has no need for a massive flagship. However, if we are to defend our ports, acquiring one shall be crucial as, sooner or later, small raiders will no longer be sufficient in terms of coastal patrol and defence operations."

 SOM_airforce: "The Royal Air Force"
 SOM_airforce_desc: "The few planes that we currently possess were bought nearly a decade ago from the Caliph and the Royal Air Force itself is in dire need of effective reform and massive investment. We shall see to it."

 SOM_bombers2: "Foreign Bomber Expertise"

 SOM_airdoc_desc: "Perhaps the most essential facet of any airborne mission, planning is the key to success in the air. We must ensure our officers are well prepared and qualified to face the dangers of aerial warfare."

### Intro Screen ###
 SOM_country_intro_header: "United We Stand!"
 SOM_country_intro_content: "The multiple states of Somalia were preyed upon by colonists and, in the eyes of the international community, we were seen as weak. We had fallen, divided, with brother against brother. However, after Abdullah Hassan's astounding victories over the Italians during the Weltkrieg, Italy had completely withdrawn from Somalia and the Sultan of Warsangali had, in all but name, slipped from British control as they were preoccupied with fighting the Germans. The Treaty of Versailles, officially concluding the Weltkrieg, paradoxically made Somalia free while remaining a protectorate of Britain due to Ali Shire's treaties.\n\nThis status quo, which had benefited both parties, did not last for long, however, as the British Empire had collapsed. In a moment of what some may call opportunism, Warsangali's forces seized what was left of British Somaliland and the lords allied to him proclaimed him Boqor, or emperor, of Somalia. However, he sought to style himself as King of Somalia in the West as a way to court the monarchs of the Central Powers while recognising the ultimate authority of the Caliph.\n\nProsperity followed for Somalia, with our fields growing rich and our cities larger. In addition, we'd managed to secure control over Ogaden in spite of the opposition from Ethiopia. Our roads, books, and universities are all symptoms of this event which has been dubbed the Somali Renaissance, but great danger may lie ahead for the wise understand that good times cannot be maintained indefinitely. Halie Selassie eyes our great nation enviously and Mittelafrika's new Governor remains diplomatically unapproachable. Whatever the future may hold, we can sit content with the fact that we have seized every possible opportunity presented to us and, together as one, leading Somalia to a better and brighter future."

 som.2.t: "Black Monday has Reached Somalia!"
 som.2.d: "Even though Black Monday has done minimal damage to Somalia, especially when compared to the nations in Europe, we've still been hit by this economic crisis. Our valued trading partners are no longer willing to trade and our people are growing discontent and worried about what the future may hold. If we do not act quickly to remedy the situation, this new attitude that has developed may make an economic downturn all but certain!"
 som.2.a: "Uh oh..."

 som.3.t: "Elections have been Called!"
 som.3.d: "The elections for the Lower House will be helpful in terms of gauging the influence and power of the various factions within the House of Clans, followed by the House of Lords. The Prime Minister from the winning party shall be appointed by the Boqor, as set forth by the constitution. Two parties have a realistic shot at winning: The Somali Youth League and the Royal Party. The people have cast their votes, and the winner is..."
 som.3.a: "The Royal Party have won the elections."
 som.3.b: "The Somali Youth League have won the elections."

 som.4.t: "The Hangash have Captured Subversive Elements"
 som.4.d: "It would be unwise to share more details, my Lord, but suffice to say these terrorists were planning to ruin Somalia from within and sell its fortunes to foreign invaders. Don't worry, however, as the threat has been dealt with."
 som.4.a: "Excellent."

 som.5.t: "The Referendum"
 som.5.d: "The people are ready to approve of our reforms and confirm our status as the supreme rules of Somalia. The no campaign has, shockingly, run into many 'difficulties'; therefore, a win is all but inevitable. All that is left is to commence the celebrations!"
 som.5.a: "Everything is going as predicted."

 som.6.t: "Clan Argument!"
 som.6.d: "Two major clans have found themselves embroiled in a disagreement during a session in the House of Lords. Both have begun the boycott of the others' actions and a political crisis is beginning to brew."
 som.6.a: "This is not good!"

 som.7.t: "Hassan and the History Books"
 som.7.d: "Mohammed Abdullah Hassan or, as he is known abroad, the Mad Mullah was the one who'd successfully defeated the British and Italian imperialists during the Weltkrieg and had secured Somali sovereignty and freedom for generations to come. However, Hassan himself possessed an aversion to personal representation and was an iconoclast who believed that photos would steal and trap his soul. The fact of the matter is, we do not possess the information needed to properly portray him, bar second-hand accounts. How shall our history books portray him?"
 som.7.a: "Carefully; we wouldn't want to steal the soul of such a great man..."

 som.8.t: "Educational Success!"
 som.8.d: "Our new curriculum has gained a surprising amount of traction, with thousands of children learning the alphabet set forth by the government. The Osmanya script will surely impact Somalia for the better and help popularise our rule."
 som.8.a: "Every poet began with a single word."

 som.9.t: "Hasnah Doreh Brigade"
 som.9.d: "To the shock of conservatives, a group of young, educated women and their husbands have organised themselves into a brigade to fight for Somalia. They call themselves the Hasnah Doreh Brigade and are named after the wife of Abdullah Hassan who'd allegedly fought alongside him."
 som.9.a: "Everyone is doing their part!"

 som.11.t: "Barre Springs his Trap!"
 som.11.d: "Damnation! As the Boqor was heading towards his palace, he was captured by disgruntled officers who abolished the monarchy. The Provisional Revolutionary Council has forcibly taken power and seeks to usher in a 'better, Totalist future' for Somalia."
 som.11.a: "We should have been more careful..."

 som.12.t: "Haaji and the Nationalists Make their Move!"
 som.12.d: "Disgruntled nationalist officers within the army have successfully launched a coup d'état and abolished the monarchy! A new Somali state has risen which is led not by the clergy and learned men, but by the military. They see themselves as what could have been, had Hassan not perished due to disease."
 som.12.a: "We should have been more careful..."

 som.13.t: "Khat Tax?!"
 som.13.d: "Khat is a major plant within Somalia. Everywhere, men can be seen chewing its leaves in bazaars, mosques, and even schools. Some have argued that since we now have control over what can be planted, we should tax the plant in order to profit off of it and control its export abroad. However, this will almost certainly be an extremely unpopular measure, especially in our rural regions."
 som.13.a: "Tax and export it; it's not like the demand will lower!"
 som.13.b: "Taxing such an important plant can only hurt us."

 SOM_aden_abdulle_osman_daar: "Aden Abdulle Osman Daar"
 SOM_aden_abdulle_osman_daar_leader_desc: "§YBorn:§! §LDecember 9th, 1908, in Beledweyne, Hiraan, Italian Somaliland§!\n§YBackground:§! §LAden Abdulle remembers very well how it is to grow up under the thrall of Colonialism. His studies bring him closer and closer to Syndicalist ideologies, which he believes fit Somalia well; each clan is a trade union which works best autonomously, but must cooperate with its neighbours. He has been strongly influenced recently by French scholarship on matters of decentralised leadership, and hopes that he can ensure that Somalia's rough recent years can culminate in something good in the long run.§!"

 SOM_haji_bashir_ismail_yusuf: "Haji Bashir Ismail Yusuf"
 SOM_haji_bashir_ismail_yusuf_leader_desc: "§YBorn:§! §L1912, in Hobyo, Mudug, Italian Somaliland§!\n§YBackground:§! §LHailing from the Osman Mahmoud clan of the Majarteen, Yusuf defends a more democratic and equal Somalia, even if he lacks the fervour for change that many of his colleagues do. His hopes are of a Somali Democratic Federation where the small clans and the city folk alike have their voices heard by the powers that be, and vows to fight poverty in rural areas of the nation.§!"

 SOM_abdirashid_ali_shermarke_leader_desc: "§YBorn:§! §LJune 8th, 1919, in Harardhere, Mudug, Italian Somaliland§!\n§YBackground:§! §LA Majarteen from Mudog, Ali Shermarke is a competent young scholar, well versed in both Islamic, Federal and foreign laws. He wishes for a non-aligned and peaceful foreign policy, but his wishes may very well be overturned by the influences foreign powers exert now on Somalia.§!"

 SOM_jama_abdullahi_qalib_leader_desc: "§YBorn:§! §Lin Hargeisa, Somalia§!\n§YBackground:§! §LJama Abdullahi Qalib is a young liberal hailing from Hargeisa. His faith in liberalism as the way to Somalia's future is admirable, but his readiness to work with foreigners has raised concerns on the populace, and so have his liberal ideas on the complete secularisation of the state§!"

 SOM_maxamuud_cali_shiire: "Maxamuud Cali Shiire"
 SOM_maxamuud_cali_shiire_leader_desc: "§YBorn:§! §Lin Las Khorey, Sanag, British Somaliland§!\n§YBackground:§! §LHaving taken up the throne of the Warsangali Sultanate in 1897 after a protracted power struggle with his father Gerad Cali Shiire, he descends from a line of kings that has lasted almost 600 years in the Horn of Africa. While being nominally subservient to British interests, Maxamuud Cali Shiire's support of Abdullah Hassan, the Mad Mullah, was crucial in defeating Italy in Africa during the Weltkrieg. A savvy political navigator, Maxamuud has united the sultanates of Somalia under a federal monarchy under his nominal leadership; but can a man who declared war against his own father for power be trusted not to infringe on constitutional prerogatives?§!"

 SOM_haaji_mahammad_husseen: "Haaji Mahammad Husseen"
 SOM_haaji_mahammad_husseen_leader_desc: "§YBackground:§! §LHaaji Mohammed is chief among a group of officers and intellectuals who defend the concept of a Greater Somalia above all else, and the unification of the people under one purpose. Despite his deep admiration for Abdullah Hassan, his group seeks completely detach Islam from the state, and such a measure is bound to be unpopular at many levels of society.§!"
