By 1909, he held the rank of major and became the chief of staff of the 1st Cavalry Division. At the outbreak of the Weltkrieg, he commanded the 4th Hussar Regiment, as a colonel, in the bloody opening battles in Galicia. He was unfortunate enough to participate in the 1916 Battle of Lutsk, one of the opening battles of the Brusilov Offensive, but his remarkable bravery and leadership in the face of relentless Russian assaults later earned him the Order of Maria Theresia, one of Austria-Hungary's top military orders of bravery. In 1917, he was transferred to the Italian Front, then the Romanian Front the following year. In the final phases of the war, he was a well-decorated general on the Macedonian Front, contributing to the final battles in that sector. After the war, he was quickly recognised as one of the more able Hungarian officers in the Monarchy and quickly rose further to the top as a General of Cavalry. As such, he is one of the most prominent Hungarian officers in the Imperial and Royal Army along with his personal friend Miklós Horthy.§!"

As a result, not only is he known as a prolific writer in military circles, but also as a forward-thinking officer embracing new technologies (\"Mobility, speed, and surprise will take on a new meaning in the war of the future\") with great concern for the lives of the common soldiery. As such, since becoming a general in 1934, he is well-respected as a humanitarian, a rare sight in the Austro-Hungarian armed forces.\n\n\"When it comes to matters of national defence, I see no races or denominations, only good and bad soldiers.\"§!"
