 VNC_new_republic: "A New Future for Venice"
 VNC_new_republic_desc: "Although the Venetian Republic of old worked while it lasted, the liberal victory in the Great Council has shown that the people wish to move forward. We must begin work on creating a modern, liberal republic for the people of Venice."
 VNC_together_as_one: "Together As One"
 VNC_together_as_one_desc: "We must strive to create not only a belief in democracy and Venetian culture, but a belief that Venice must work together as a single unit and as a single mind. We must all dedicate ourselves to the purpose of advancement if we are to survive and thrive"

 VNC_meritocracy_desc: "The time of political positions being chosen by lottery or by having noble blood is long since over. Any man or woman who is successful and capable should have the right to enter the halls of power."
 VNC_womens_suffrage: "Pass the Universal Enfranchisement Act"
 VNC_womens_suffrage_desc: "Women were fully excluded from the political process in the Old Republic- a mistake we will not make again. Women are just as capable of selecting our ruler as men, and as such shall be granted full suffrage."
 VNC_concio: "Apertura del Mazor Consegio"
 VNC_concio_desc: "The Great Council in the days of yore was a hall of wealth, power and above all privilege. With the Serrata del Maggior Consiglio or closing of the Great Council, it locked it off to many Venetians. In our efforts to liberalise and democratise the Republic we should reopen the Great Council."
 VNC_venetian_welfare: "Create the Venetian Welfare State"
 VNC_venetian_welfare_desc: "Caring for the people has long been part of Venice's history, dating back to the 15th century when the Magistrato alla Sanità was established to help manage public health.

 VNC_old_republic: "The Old Order Restored"

The conservative victory in the Grand Council proves that the people want a return to this power and wealth, and who are we to say no to the people?"
 VNC_course_of_honors: "Reinstate the Course of Honours System"
 VNC_course_of_honors_desc: "The old republic relied on a course of honours system where politicians were required to spend time in different councils, helping to strengthen the statesmen and better hone their skills of statecraft. By bringing this sysem back we can ensure our politicians are well-rounded and qualified individuals."
 VNC_state_inquistors: "Create the State Inquisitor Tribunal"
 VNC_state_inquistors_desc: "In the days of yore we had the State Inquisitors to help make sure that the republic was safe from internal threats. Working hand in hand with the Council of Ten they made sure that the Republic of Venice was safe from spies and saboteurs. Now more than ever this system is needed, as we are surrounded on all sides by enemies and more powerful states."
 VNC_new_nobility: "Invite Exiled Nobles"
 VNC_new_nobility_desc: "Many of the noble families that once made up the ruling class of Venice had their titles stripped by the Republicans or fled Italy during the civil war.

 VNC_merchant_princes: "Encourage a Mercantile Elite"

 VNC_stato_da_mar_desc: "During the days of the Old Republic, the whole eastern Mediterranean was under our dominion.

 VNC_istria_policy: "Istria Policy"
 VNC_istria_policy_desc: "Istria was long ruled by the old Republic and many there still speak our noble tongue. Let us return this lost appendage!"
 VNC_dalmatia_policy: "Dalmatia Policy"
 VNC_dalmatia_policy_desc: "Control of Dalmatia allowed the old Republic to prosper. If we are to prosper, we must also have it. Luckily, many of our people still live there, providing the perfect basis on which to stake our claim."

 VNC_reenforce_po_line_desc: "The ragtag defences that stopped the Syndicalists back in 1920 will not stop them now. We must build up our border forts and trenches to prepare for another assault by the Socialists."

 VNC_military_exercises_desc: "As a display of power and to promote the morale of our army, we should organise a series of near-combat training exercises near the Po River. Let our nation's enemies tremble."

### Economic Focuses ###
 VNC_asseses_the_economy: "A Modern Consoli dei Mercanti"
 VNC_asseses_the_economy_desc: "The old republic employed a unique judiciary of seasoned merchants to solve trade disputes. While such a system would be antiquated today, a council of merchants could still provide valuable advice for trade and commerce."
 VNC_venetian_industry: "Kickstart Venetian Industry"
 VNC_venetian_industry_desc: "Although our Republic was known for its  merchants and traders, it still had a flourishing glass and textile industry. We must begin to develop a more modern industrial base if we wish to live up to our past."
 VNC_railways: "Establish Inland Railway Links"
 VNC_railways_desc: "Although the city of Venice is without a doubt the heart of our country, the towns and cities in the interior are important economically and militarily as well, and we should improve the railways leading to and from them."
 VNC_bounty_of_the_sea: "Bounty of the Sea"
 VNC_bounty_of_the_sea_desc: "The Adriatic is the very soul of the Venetian people, and our history reflects this. By expanding our shipbuilding industries and utilising the natural resources of the Adriatic, we can once again become the trading hub of the Mediterranean."
 VNC_expand_the_arsenal: "A Modern Venetian Arsenal"

 VNC_trade_center_desc: "The fine glass produced on the island of Murano is one of our largest exports, and represents a valuable opportunity for growth. By expanding production of the glass, we can start to recover the wealth and prosperity we once had."
 VNC_avaiation_industry: "Cultural Renewal"
 VNC_avaiation_industry_desc: "While overshadowed in popular memory by the greats of Florence and Milan, Venice was the birthplace of a good many men of note. Just as Tintoretto's brush illuminated the world, let us whet the people's nascent appetite for finer things."
 VNC_research_institutes: "Specialised Research Academies"
 VNC_research_institutes_desc: "While our education system is fairly modern, we shall never possess the same capacity for research as larger powers without investment. Specialised research academies, universities focused on specific subjects as directed by the state should be established to accomplish that."
 VNC_venetian_radio: "Venetian Radio"
 VNC_venetian_radio_desc: "Radio has become an important technology for both military and civilian use. We must ensure we have a strong grasp on this technology if we wish for our people to be entertained and our military to be informed."
 VNC_bussiness_schools: "Open Modern Business Schools"
 VNC_bussiness_schools_desc: "Our nation's commercial acumen will decline as the fervour of independence fades. To compensate, a new system of vocational schools focused on general business literacy should be opened."

 VNC_expand_research_institutes_desc: "Both the specialised research academies and system of business schools have seen success in educating our people and expanding our research capabilities. By merging the two systems we can develop the most innovative strategies in commerce and business and ensure we are present for all future developments. "
 VNC_synthetic_research: "Synthetics Research"

 VNC_economic_miracle_desc: "Prosperity is slowly returning to the land. The days of great merchant ships packing the harbour will soon return, and with them the return of Venice's rightful place as one of the great powers of Europe."

### Naval Policy ###
 VNC_modernize_the_navy: "Modernise the Navy"
 VNC_modernize_the_navy_desc: "For centuries the Venetian Navy was the pride of our armed forces. However, times have changed and we are now struggling to even defend our coasts. We must begin a programme of naval modernisation if we wish to change this"
 VNC_expand_dockyards: "Expand the Dockyards"
 VNC_expand_dockyards_desc: "The Venetian Arsenal worked hundreds of years ago, but is no longer the peak of military engineering it once was. We must build larger, modern dockyards if we want our navy to be a powerful force once more."
 VNC_defend_the_coast: "Build Coastal Fortifications"

 VNC_heavy_cruisers: "Incrociatori da Bataja"
 VNC_heavy_cruisers_desc: "In order to support our fleet, large battlecruisers are needed. Producing these will be expensive, but it will surely be worth it."
 VNC_battle_cruisers: "Corazzate"
 VNC_battle_cruisers_desc: "While we lack the ability to produce dreadnoughts in sufficient number, smaller battleships are more than sufficient to repel any foe, and can easily be produced en masse."
 VNC_carriers: "Portaerei"
 VNC_carriers_desc: "The superiority of aircraft carriers over other capital ships is undeniable. By developing carriers as the pride of our new navy, our fleets shall be future-proof."
 VNC_naval_aircraft: "Carrier-Based Aircraft"

 VNC_venetian_marines: "Fanti da Mar"

### Air Force Focuses ###

 VNC_venetian_air_companies_desc: "Our region produced a disproportionate number of aircraft for the old Italy. With sufficient funding, we can capitalise on that experience to augment production."
 VNC_offensive_priorty: "Offensive Priority"
 VNC_offensive_priorty_desc: "Our small nation must strike quickly and decisively in order to remain afloat. The air force must be able to operate effectively far from home and without communications."
 VNC_strat_bombers: "Construct Long-Ranged Bombers"
 VNC_strat_bombers_desc: "We must have modern strategic bombers capable of destroying an enemy's industrial base."
 VNC_defned_la_serenissim: "Defend La Serenissima"

 VNC_fighters: "Support the Troops"
 VNC_fighters_desc: "While some would like to forget the importance of close air support in pursuit of more independent air force command structures, we cannot afford to reject reality. Our aircraft must not work alone, but always in tandem with the men on the ground."
 VNC_jets: "Venetian Jets"
 VNC_jets_desc: "Advances in engine design have catalysed the transformation of the military role of aircraft across the globe. We cannot rely purely on piston craft amidst such developments."

 VNC_superior_fire_power: "Superior Firepower"
 VNC_superior_fire_power_desc: "While we will never have the manpower to fight a prolonged conflict, our nation's industry can become the lynchpin of our national defence. By producing large numbers of high-quality heavy armaments to be used effectively in the field, our soldiers can inflict casualties disproportionate to their numbers."
 VNC_modernize_the_guns: "Produce Modern Small Arms"
 VNC_modernize_the_guns_desc: "As part of our focus on a small but professional army, we must make sure our soldiers have the newest in small arm technology to always have the edge over their opponents."
 VNC_artilery_effort: "Canóni of the Modern Age"
 VNC_artilery_effort_desc: "Artillery was key to German victory in the Weltkrieg. We must emulate their tactics and improve our own artillery if we wish to have similar success."
 VNC_grand_battle_plan: "Grand Battleplan"
 VNC_grand_battle_plan_desc: "Although focusing on the highest-quality equipment available may be effective, it is far too costly and our fledgling economy cannot possibly support it. We must instead focus on training our officers and commanders to have the sharpest strategic minds possible, with innovative strategies ensuring a tactical advantage over any foe."
 VNC_flexiable_planning: "Experiment with Motorisation"
 VNC_flexiable_planning_desc: "Infantry must be both motorised and sufficiently protected. Our plans must not only be implemented quickly, but remain intact beyond contact with the enemy."
 VNC_support_brigades: "Expanded Support Brigades"
 VNC_support_brigades_desc: "Non-standard support equipment allows divisions to fight more effectively and stay in the fight for longer. We must begin research on support companies and equipment to reach this goal."
 VNC_infantry_tanks: "Combined Arms"
 VNC_infantry_tanks_desc: "With the greatest land, air, and sea technologies all working in tandem, the Lion of Saint Marc shall truly roar again."

### Venetian Revolt ###
 VNC_last_stand: "The Last Stand of Liberty"
 VNC_last_stand_desc: "The rescinding of state autonomies and the suspension of elections by the ANI was a flagrant violation of justice. It falls onto us to take arms against this tyranny and to stand for all that is good in the world. War with the Ultranationalists is coming and we must prepare by using all available stockpiles to arm anybody willing to fight."
 VNC_unite_rebel: "Unite the Rebel Forces"
 VNC_unite_rebel_desc: "The impromptu nature of our rebellion and the raising of militia forces has meant that our high command is facing difficulties with organising the armed forces. Confusion over orders within the military is common and must be remedied as soon as possible."
 VNC_raise_militias: "Raise Partisan Units"
 VNC_raise_militias_desc: "After the liberation of Friuli, many eager volunteers, who were unable to join the rebellion amongst the initial confusion in the rebellion, have petitioned to fight alongside our military against the tyrants in Milan. We must act upon this opportunity and recruit these men."
 VNC_rally_defectors: "Rally Sympathetic Defectors"
 VNC_rally_defectors_desc: "With the ANI facing increasing losses against Venetian forces, they are facing growing opposition both among the civilian population and the armed forces. What was promised to be a swift war has now turned into a quagmire while the prospect of foreign intervention is becoming more of a reality. We can capitalise on this opposition by appealing to disaffected soldiers to defect and help overthrow the tyrant Ciano."
 VNC_promote_coordination: "Promote Army Coordination"
 VNC_promote_coordination_desc: "Although our efforts to unify our rag-tag forces into a proper army have been bearing some success, the military is still facing issues of cohesion. Further effort must be undertaken if we are to defeat the ANI."

 VNC_propaganda_desc: "As this war pits brother against brother, calls for peace have grown louder. The failure of the ANI to produce a swift victory is causing major morale issues which we can exploit. With the assistance of Austria, we can smuggle propaganda calling for the overthrowal of Ciano. With many already questioning the ability of the ANI to win the war with thousands already dead and a common sentiment that Ciano has left Italy vulnerable to the socialists, this is sure to be effective."

 venice.1.t: "First Session of the Great Council"
 venice.1.d: "For the first time in over a hundred years, the Great Council of Venice convenes once more. Members from across the republic gather in Venice to discuss how the Venetian Republic should be structured. Already two camps have emerged between those that want Venice to be a modern republic with greatly expanded civil rights and liberties, and those that want to see the Republic of Venice restored to as it was during its golden era."
 venice.1.a: "Let us begin"

 venice.2.t: "Election and term of the Doge"
 venice.2.d: "The first question to come up is the election of the Doge. In the old republic, the Doge was elected for life by the Great Council. 30 members were chosen by random lot, who would then be reduced to 9 by random lot. Those 9 would name 40 members who had to be approved by 7 of the 9. The 40 were reduced by lot to 12, who named 25 members. Those 25 had to be approved by 9 of the 12. The 9 would name 45, and each member had to be approved by 7 of the 9. The 45 members were then reduced by lot to 11. These 11 named 45 who had to be approved by 9 of the 11. These 45 were finally reduced by lot to 25, and they would finally choose the Doge, who kept the position for life.\n\nNaturally, the old system is considered rather archaic. Those within the Great Council seeking to modernise the Republic instead propose that the Doge should be elected directly by the people and with a four-year term, subject to re-election."
 venice.2.a: "The old system is ridiculous. The Doge shall be elected by the people every four years!"
 venice.2.b: "Why change what worked for centuries? Keep the old system!"

 venice.5.t: "A New Republic has been Established!"
 venice.5.d: "After  days of voting and intense debate, the Great Council has decided to establish itself as a new, modernised and liberal republic. This marks a new chapter in Venice's history."
 venice.5.a: "Fon sù i fondaminti de un nóvo doman!"

 venice.6.t: "The Serene Republic has been Reestablished!"
 venice.6.d: "After many days of voting and intense debate, the Great Council has chosen to re-establish the mercantilist, oligarchic Serene Republic of old. This marks a new chapter in Venice's history."
 venice.6.a: "Viva San Marco! Viva Venezia!"

 venice.18.t: "We are Losing to Venice"
 venice.18.d: "Unbelievably, we are losing ground to the Venetians. Either we give them what they want now, and hope they stop there, or we may end up facing a rather humiliating defeat at their hands, one where we lose everything."
 venice.18.a: "End this war now"
 venice.18.b: "No, this is too early to call yet"

 venice.19.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Sues for Peace"
 venice.19.d: "Our war against [From.GetNameDef] has been going well, but at a cost to both nations. We have recieved an offer of peace promising Istria and our other claims if we lay down our arms. What should we do?"

 venice.32.d: "For centuries starting in 1000 CE there was the Festa de la Sensa and the Marriage of the Sea held on Ascension Day. However, when Napoleon destroyed the Republic in 1798 the festival stopped being celebrated. Now that the Republic is reformed, we can celebrate  the Venetian Republic's Marriage to the Sea once again."
 venice.32.a: "We wed thee, sea, as a sign of true and everlasting domination."

 venice.33.t: "[GetYear] Sposalizio del Mare"
 venice.33.d: "Today we once again celebrate the marriage of the sea. Decorated ships with both Venetian and foreign dignitaries have been coming and going from the harbor, and the mood in the city has been nothing short of ecstatic. After a lengthy speech, Doge [Root.GetLeader] tossed a ring into the lagoon signifying the marriage of Venice to the Sea. Later in the night, fireworks exploded celebrating our national day, both in the city and throughout the hinterlands of the country."
 venice.33.a: "We wed thee, sea, as a sign of true and everlasting domination."

 venice.34.t: "Reviving Venetian Carnival"
 venice.34.d: "During the days of the Venetian Republic, Carnival was a popular festival that celebrated the end of Lent and before Ash Wednesday began. Even after the end of the Republic in 1798, the festival was always popular and private festivals would remain celebrated. However, now that the Republic is restored we can begin to celebrate Carnival once again."
 venice.34.a: "Long live Venice!"

 venice.35.t: "Venetian Carnival"

 venice.36.t: "Ponte della Libertà"
 venice.36.d: "Today marks the opening of the Ponte della Libertà or the Bridge of Liberty, connecting the city of Venice to the Mainland.

Many of the teachers and faculty are active or retired members of the Venetian navy."
 venice.37.a: "To the next generation of Venetian sailors!"

 venice.50.t: "The [GetYear] [Root.GetAdjective] Elections"
 venice.50.d: "The months leading up to the elections for the new Doge and his party this year in [Root.GetNameDef] have been as divisive and charged as ever. With people flooding to the polls, the winner turns out to be..."
 venice.50.a: "... the Partito Liberałe Cristian!"
 venice.50.b: "... the Partito Repubblicano Veneto!"
 venice.50.c: "... the Lega Catòłega!"
 venice.50.e: "... the Partito Popolare Veneto!"

 venice.51.t: "Electing the Doge"
 venice.51.d.revolt: "The byzantine process to select the new Doge-for-life has taken weeks, but now it is down to two candidates: Giuseppe Volpi, hero of the revolt, and Giovanni Ponti. Volpi has widespread popular support thanks to his status as war hero, but there are many conservatives who believe his ideas of reform are too liberal. Ponti, on the other hand is favoured by the newly-reestablished nobility. The vote is sure to be a close one."
 venice.51.d.norevolt: "The byzantine process to select the new Doge-for-life has taken weeks, but now it is down to two candidates: the liberal, Giuseppe Volpi, and the conservative, Giovanni Ponti. Considering Volpi and his party were not even in favour of returning to the ways of the old republic, Ponti is the heavy favourite. Even so, Volpi has numerous connections from his many stints in provincial government, and there is still a chance he could win."
 venice.51.a: "Giuseppe Volpi is our new Doge!"
 venice.51.b: "Giovanni Ponti is our new Doge!"
