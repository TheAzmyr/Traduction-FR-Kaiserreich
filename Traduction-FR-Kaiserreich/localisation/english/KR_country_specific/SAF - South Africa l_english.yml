#Black Monday
 SAF_black_monday_crisis: "A Response to Black Monday"
 SAF_black_monday_crisis_desc: "The economic crisis threatens to tear the Union apart. We must reform our country's economy to solve mass unemployment, but the Volksraad stands divided on the path to take forwards. This choice will certainly have repercussions in the years to come, and may even exacerbate existing divides."

 SAF_repeal_industrial_conciliation_act: "Repeal the Industrial Conciliation Act"
 SAF_repeal_industrial_conciliation_act_desc: "The Industrial Conciliation Act was a direct reaction to the Rand Rebellion in 1922 and gave white trade unions privileges that are slowing economic recovery. The Act must be repealed, and the unions must be brought to heel if we are to get the nation's economy back on track. This will obviously be extremely unpopular with white workers."

 SAF_attract_canadian_investment: "Attract Canadian Investment"
 SAF_attract_canadian_investment_desc: "By encouraging Canadian investment, we will give our economy the influx of capital that it desperately needs while also hopefully providing thousands of jobs to our struggling workforce."

 SAF_weaken_the_colour_bar: "Opportunities for the Unemployed"
 SAF_weaken_the_colour_bar_desc: "Be it through the use of bailouts or investment, slowly but surely the amount of jobs in South Africa is climbing out of its lowest point. As more and more people have a job again, they can also spend a bit again, which goes to the benefit of other sectors in the economy."

 SAF_invest_in_witwatersrand_industry: "The Witwatersrand Roars Again!"
 SAF_invest_in_witwatersrand_industry_desc: "The mineral wealth in the Witwatersrand has been a commercial safety net during the economic crisis. While it has been hurt as much as any other part of the South African economy by this crisis, it is clearly starting to reach pre-crisis levels again, pushing our economy to recovery with it."

 SAF_establish_work_programs: "Establish Work Programmes"
 SAF_establish_work_programs_desc: "A series of work programmes for the unemployed is a safe bet for economic recovery and consequently has general support in the party with exception to the hardline unionists within the SAP."

 SAF_bail_out_farmers: "Farmer Bail Out"
 SAF_bail_out_farmers_desc: "The ongoing crisis is a time of suffering for all people of South Africa, but the heaviest burden is without a doubt being carried by our farmers. Rock-bottom prices are necessitating bail outs for both internal producers and exporters aimed at saving our agricultural sector from collapse."

 SAF_large_scale_roadworks: "Large-Scale Roadworks"
 SAF_large_scale_roadworks_desc: "The nation is in dire need of better roads even in its Southern territories. The high unemployment rates because of Black Monday now give us the manpower to link up Natal, Transvaal, and Cape provinces while also providing jobs to thousands."

 SAF_sa_arms_industry: "South African Arms Industry"
 SAF_sa_arms_industry_desc: "One way that we can put people to work is by expanding our military infrastructure. We have the natural resources to develop our military - now all we need is the will to do it."

 SAF_complete_recovery: "Complete the Recovery"
 SAF_complete_recovery_desc: "Finally, we are able to put Black Monday behind us once and for all. Let us move forward into an era of strength for the South African economy!"

#Protectorates
 SAF_deal_with_the_protectorates: "Deal with the Protectorates"
 SAF_deal_with_the_protectorates_desc: "Following the collapse of the British Empire in 1925, the duty to garrison the High Commissioner Territories passed to the Union Defence Force. Since then, the region has stagnated. Elements within the South African government propose we reassess our relationship with the territories."

 SAF_establish_nuweveld: "Establish the Nuweveld"
 SAF_establish_nuweveld_desc: "Turning the newly annexed territories over to white settlers will encourage the establishment of new settlements throughout the Nuweveld and the cultural integration of the new regions. The locals, however, would lose access to most agricultural lands, forcing them to migrate to the cities for work as transient labour."

 SAF_encourage_farmer_resettlement: "Encourage Farmer Settlement"
 SAF_encourage_farmer_resettlement_desc: "The financial plight of our farmers presents us with a unique opportunity to apply the Nuweveldt project. If we can encourage resettlement to the ranges of Bechuanaland, we can turn the economic crisis into an opportunity for thousands of destitute white farmers."

 SAF_long_term_investment_loans: "Long-Standing Investment Loans"
 SAF_long_term_investment_loans_desc: "By providing guaranteed loans we can provide a low-cost incentive for entrepreneurs across the nation to move to the newly allotted lands in Bechuanaland."

 SAF_build_the_kariba_dam: "Build the Kariba Dam"
 SAF_build_the_kariba_dam_desc: "Finishing the Kariba Dam will be long and arduous work, but it will provide plenty of energy for our growing industry in Rhodesia and the settlements springing out from the colonisation of the Nuweveld."

 SAF_annex_the_protectorates: "Annex the Protectorates"
 SAF_annex_the_protectorates_desc: "It is time to end the Protectorates. After the successful implementation of the Nuweveldt project, we can easily bring the territories under our direct control. The British treaties with the natives will be cast aside and the paramount chiefs will be dethroned. The time of a united South Africa is upon us!"

 SAF_stellaland_affairs_act: "Stellaland Affairs Act"
 SAF_stellaland_affairs_act_desc: "The integration of the former Protectorates will require formal, albeit mostly symbolic legislation. Basutoland and Swaziland will be integrated into the Cape Province and Transvaal respectively, but Bechuanaland will be admitted as the province of Stellaland in honour of the former Boer Republic."

 SAF_expand_nuweveld_infra: "Expand the Outer Rail Connection"
 SAF_expand_nuweveld_infra_desc: "Developing the infrastructure of Nuweveldt lands will not only encourage settlement but also ensure that the lands are finally being put to a productive use."

 SAF_new_towns_and_villages: "Towns and Villages Spring Up"
 SAF_new_towns_and_villages_desc: "The founding of new urban centres will encourage city workers to migrate into the Nuweveldt alongside our rural workers and increase our total population in these areas."

 SAF_diversified_territorial_economy: "Diversified Territorial Economy"
 SAF_diversified_territorial_economy_desc: "Striving for a diversified economy for the Nuweveldt territories can only help their economic growth which will in turn attract more settlers."

 SAF_empower_paramount_chiefs: "Empower the Paramount Chiefs"
 SAF_empower_paramount_chiefs_desc: "Granting autonomy to the local rulers of the High Commissioner Territories will ensure the Paramount Chiefs of their respective ethnic groups (the Tswana in Bechuanaland, the Basotho in Basutoland and the Swazi in Swaziland) shall be loyal to the central government."

 SAF_develop_basutoland_swaziland: "Develop Basutoland and Swaziland"
 SAF_develop_basutoland_swaziland_desc: "Despite their location between the original four provinces of South Africa, the living standard in Basutoland and Swaziland still immensely lags behind that of the rest of South Africa. A series of investments will aid in resolving this situation."

 SAF_develop_bechuanaland: "Develop Bechuanaland"
 SAF_develop_bechuanaland_desc: "The sparsely populated region of Bechuanaland is without hyperbolics the least developed region in all of Africa, with any kind of construction remaining limited to a few wooden huts in most places. A series of well-placed investments will soften the contrast with South Africa just over the border."

 SAF_root_out_slavery: "Root Out Slavery Practices"
 SAF_root_out_slavery_desc: "Slavery has long proven difficult to root out of the High Commissioner Territories, but the recent investment gives us leverage with the paramount chiefs to resolve the persisting issues, by making investments dependent on their action on slavery."

 SAF_question_of_native_autonomy: "Question of Native Autonomy"
 SAF_question_of_native_autonomy_desc: "We have decided to grant autonomy to the local rulers of the High Commission Territories, the new Paramount Chiefs of the respective ethnic groups (the Tswana in Bechuanaland, the Basotho in Basutoland and the Swazi in Swaziland). But we need to clarify the extent of the Chiefs power - is it limited to within the borders of the HCT or does it encompass all of their peoples throughout South Africa?"

 SAF_strengthen_advisory_councils: "Strengthen the Advisory Councils"
 SAF_strengthen_advisory_councils_desc: "By strengthening the influence of the advisory councils on policy, we can assure that the interests of the Paramount Chief are at least somewhat balanced with both the European and native interests. It will also lay the groundwork for eventual reform into a bona fide democratic framework in the future."

 SAF_chief_justice_of_the_high_commissioner_territories: "Form the Territorial Justice System"
 SAF_chief_justice_of_the_high_commissioner_territories_desc: "At current the status of the law in the High Commissioner Territories is rather vague, members of the tribes are usually tried according to their own tribal traditions while Europeans are tried as if they were in South African territory, with certain exceptions. It is time we formalise a system with trained justices specifically to ensure fair trials for everyone in the territories."

 SAF_reform_the_commissioner_system: "Reform the Commissioner System"
 SAF_reform_the_commissioner_system_desc: "We have made our fair investments in the High Commissioner Territories, but at current we still merely have a temporary mandate from the royal government. In parliament in Cape Town proposals are made to pursue the official and permanent inclusion of the territories within South Africa, but the British exile government would need to cooperate."

#Union
 SAF_general_elections: "The Union's Affairs"
 SAF_general_elections_desc: "The elections are over and a mandate is to be fulfilled. Let us put our affairs in order, and then move on to the order of the day."

 SAF_proclaim_the_republic: "Proclaim the Republic"
 SAF_proclaim_the_republic_desc: "For too long the Afrikaans people and South Africa at large have been subjected to the will of a monarchy that is not their own. It is time we move on from this chapter in history and establish a fully independent and sovereign Republic of South Africa, which has the interest of South Africa at heart, rather than that of the British."

 SAF_replace_the_pound: "Replace the Pound"
 SAF_replace_the_pound_desc: "Since we are now a fully sovereign and independent nation, it will not do any longer to make use of a currency intrinsically tied to a British past and tied to the Pound Sterling. Let us introduce our own South African Rand - tied to the Witwatersrand, where we find our gold - and thrive in our independent future."

 SAF_reorganise_the_national_party: "Reorganise the National Party"
 SAF_reorganise_the_national_party_desc: "Dr. Malan, the pathetic constitutionalist barrister, is allowing our Afrikaner destiny to be held back with this insistence to adhere to the South African constitution, binding us to worthless parliamentary procedures and endangering our nation's hold on power in South Africa in the process. If only a decisive and unrelenting figure could just do away with parliamentarianism and the liberals that thrive in it..."

 SAF_implement_apartheid: "Implement Apartheid"
 SAF_implement_apartheid_desc: "After a period of consolidation, we are now in a position to strengthen existing segregation laws to bring about full separation of the four South African nations both socially and politically. The Volksraad is behind us and set to carry our government's programme through."

 SAF_independent_perspective: "An Independent Perspective"
 SAF_independent_perspective_desc: "We are a free and independent country now, not beholden to the will of Britain to sacrifice Afrikaner men to reverse their own failures at home, or to bully our German brethren, who have never done us wrong. Yet, as an independent South Africa pursuing South African interests, we are not against allies."

 SAF_retreat_from_european_affairs: "Retreat from European Affairs"
 SAF_retreat_from_european_affairs_desc: "General Smuts dragged us into the Weltkrieg, sending Afrikaners to die in the cold mud of a land alien to their own to further the imperial interest of an island that was not their own either. Now that South Africa is a free and independent country, we will cease to involve ourselves in the petty squabbles of the European powers."

 SAF_native_representation_act: "The Native Representation Act"
 SAF_native_representation_act_desc: "A long-term Nationalist goal has been to remove native South Africans from the voting rolls and to allow them to vote for three separate white members of the Volksraad instead of pooling their property-qualified vote into South Africa's general electorate. The time to implement this plan is now!"

 SAF_gerrymander_districts: "Gerrymander the Districts"
 SAF_gerrymander_districts_desc: "Troublingly, we are having trouble in getting a majority of the electorate to support us, and we mainly owe our hold over the government to the fact that rural constituencies are overrepresented compared to urban constituencies. Perhaps if we slightly redraw the borders, we can ensure this situation remains locked down in our favour."

 SAF_flags_amendment_act: "Flags Amendment Act"
 SAF_flags_amendment_act_desc: "It is the result of compromise that South Africa, proud nation as it is, needs to fly the Union Jack, a symbol of oppression by Britain, next to its national flag in an official capacity. This act will ensure that our national flag will no longer see competition from the British national flag."

 SAF_expel_rensburg: "Expel Johannes van Rensburg"
 SAF_expel_rensburg_desc: "The power-hungry and paramilitary former administrator of the Orange Free State, Johannes van Rensburg, has been plotting to unconstitutionally seize the apparatus of state for himself for years now. It is time we distance ourselves from this shady figure by revoking his party membership."

 SAF_coloured_enfranchisement_act: "'Coloured' Enfranchisement Act"
 SAF_coloured_enfranchisement_act_desc: "Of all racial groups in South Africa, the mixed race 'Coloured' group is definitely the one seen as the closest to an equal by the South Africa's white European population. The first step towards gradually turning South Africa in a truly comprehensive democracy would be to abolish the property qualifications of this community in the Cape and Rhodesia, while extending franchise to them in the other provinces."

 SAF_native_trust_and_land_act: "Native Trust and Land Act"
 SAF_native_trust_and_land_act_desc: "The Native Trust and Land Act increases the designated 8% of South African land which has been reserved for South Africa's native population to approximately 13% of South Africa's territory. This measure will mean that land currently owned by whites will have to be bought by the government, a process that can take years, if not decades."

 SAF_asiatic_land_tenure_act: "Asiatic Land Tenure Act"
 SAF_asiatic_land_tenure_act_desc: "Conservatives within our party, especially those based in Natal, consider that Indian merchants are posing a threat to the white community by outcompeting their stores, both among whites and natives. They would like to ensure that white South Africans can secure their position by limiting the land which can be owned by Indians to certain designated areas."

 SAF_natives_consolidation_act: "Natives (Urban Areas) Consolidation Act"
 SAF_natives_consolidation_act_desc: "For a long time, we have been using pass laws to prevent native South Africans from encroaching on our urban areas, which are inhabited by white South Africans. The following act has been proposed by the conservatives to refine the pass laws and ensure that the privileged position of the urban whites can be maintained."

 SAF_vaalhart_irrigation_scheme: "Complete the Vaalhart Irrigation Scheme"
 SAF_vaalhart_irrigation_scheme_desc: "The Orange Free State, Northern Cape and Transvaal regions of South Africa are quite dry and therefore less suitable for agriculture. By building an extensive irrigation system out of the Vaal River we can ensure that our farms receive enough water for a good output of agricultural produce."

 SAF_expand_krugerpark: "Expand the Krugerpark"
 SAF_expand_krugerpark_desc: "The Krugerpark is a wildlife reserve with its roots in the Sabi Game Reserve of the South African Republic (commonly known as the (boer republic of) Transvaal). In recent years it has attracted a modest amount of tourism from both the British and German spheres of influence who seem enthusiastic about the wildlife rail tours through the national park."

 SAF_enact_smuts_doctrine: "Recover British Africa"
 SAF_enact_smuts_doctrine_desc: "In the darkest hour of the empire, the revolution of 1925, the vile Germans illegally occupied most of British Africa, only leaving alone South Africa, the High Commissioner Territories, Gambia and Sierra Leone. Generals Pierre van Ryneveld and Jan Smuts have put together a plan to bring back at least the relatively easily accessible colonies of Northern Rhodesia and East Africa in the imperial fold."

 SAF_fire_broeders: "Fire 'Broeder' Civil Servants"
 SAF_fire_broeders_desc: "The Afrikaner Broederbond, a secret society of Afrikaners, posing as a cultural organisation encompassing many prominent South African politicians, soldiers and civil servants, has sought to push Afrikaner issues and rule South Africa from behind the curtains since its foundation. It is time we curtail the influence of these secretive men by requiring all of our civil servants to distance from them."

 SAF_asiatic_enfranchisement_act: "Asiatic Enfranchisement Act"
 SAF_asiatic_enfranchisement_act_desc: "The Asiatic racial group of South Africa, comprised of Cape Malays who have been here since Dutch rule and Indian indentured workers introduced mainly in Natal, but also in the Transvaal and Cape province, form only a small fraction of the South African population, but most of them are currently denied the right to vote under similar conditions as the native majority. It is time to abolish these restrictions."

#Economy
 SAF_found_sabc: "Found the SABC"
 SAF_found_sabc_desc: "[SAF_found_sabc_focus_desc]"
 SAF_found_sabc_socialist_desc: "While radio broadcasters have been active in South Africa since 1923, the revolution has staggered their development somewhat. Even among the capitalists, there were proposals to establish a national radio network - and many in our government are hopeful that establishing a South African Broadcasting Cooperative will restart development in radio and foster an informed people."
 SAF_found_sabc_default_desc: "Radio broadcasters have been active in South Africa since 1923, but South Africa has so far lacked a national radio network. As such, voices have risen in Pretoria to officially establish a 'South African Broadcasting Corporation', or, in Afrikaans, 'Suid-Afrikaanse Uitsaaikorporasie', which will broadcast two radio services: one in English, and one in Afrikaans."

 SAF_expand_university_funding: "Expand University Funding"
 SAF_expand_university_funding_desc: "Education, as everyone knows, is essential for national development - In particular, higher education provides highly trained people that fuel economic and technological expansion. While South Africa has universities of her own, they have become aged in comparison to the world's finest and are increasingly struggling to catch up. An increase in government grants should hopefully alleviate this."

 SAF_form_mathematical_society: "Form the Mathematical Society"
 SAF_form_mathematical_society_desc: "The South African Mathematical Society is a group of South African intellectuals, who, contrary to the name of the society, deal not only in mathematics but also physics and other such endeavours."

 SAF_focus_on_agricultural_expansion: "Focus on Agricultural Expansion"
 SAF_focus_on_agricultural_expansion_desc: "[SAF_focus_on_agricultural_expansion_focus_desc]"
 SAF_focus_on_agricultural_expansion_socialist_desc: "South Africa is a bountiful land, with rich, fertile soil. We must expand upon this, and ensure that regardless of colour, that a man can work for his bread."
 SAF_focus_on_agricultural_expansion_default_desc: "Our history is rooted in the exploits of the farmers who came to South Africa. It would be foolish to throw our cash into the pockets of the already rich British capitalists, who are ever hungry for workers to exploit, those workers being the Africans when the Afrikaners become too expensive. Agriculture is the strength of our nation and the root of our culture."

 SAF_subsidized_farming: "[SAF_subsidized_farming_focus_name]"
 SAF_subsidized_farming_socialist: "Agrarian Socialism"
 SAF_subsidized_farming_default: "Subsidised Farming"

 SAF_subsidized_farming_desc: "[SAF_subsidized_farming_focus_desc]"
 SAF_subsidized_farming_socialist_desc: "With the previous system of farming in South Africa hailing from the old imperialistic system now no more, we will promote racial harmony with socialist ideals and will remove those who go against us."
 SAF_subsidized_farming_default_desc: "One way to support our hard-working farmers is to hand out subsidies, allowing them to perhaps expand their lands a bit, take better precautions against wildlife aiming to attack their livestock, and investing in new machinery."

 SAF_support_cape_wineries: "Support Cape Wineries"
 SAF_support_cape_wineries_desc: "The Mediterranean climate of the Cape is perfect for the cultivation of wine grapes, and as such, South African wine is world-renowned. We should make use of this export boom, and support our wineries in their endeavours."

 SAF_encourage_sharecropping: "[SAF_encourage_sharecropping_focus_name]"
 SAF_encourage_sharecropping_socialist: "Establish National Farming Cooperatives"
 SAF_encourage_sharecropping_default: "Encourage Sharecropping"

 SAF_encourage_sharecropping_desc: "[SAF_encourage_sharecropping_focus_desc]"
 SAF_encourage_sharecropping_socialist_desc: "With the removal of Imperialist and Nationalist organisations, the people of all colours are now able to work the land. Under our guidance, we shall form farming cooperatives of mixed race, to further ease racial tensions, and promote syndicalist ideals."
 SAF_encourage_sharecropping_default_desc: "Sharecropping holds that a landowner allows a tenant to farm on his land in return for a part of the produce. Many Afrikaner farmers are unable to work all of their stretched land of our outstretched nation. It would be economically responsible to encourage them to allow sharecroppers to work this excess land."

 SAF_agricultural_innovation: "Agricultural Innovation"
 SAF_agricultural_innovation_desc: "South Africa is a western nation, but also a nation of agriculture. It is only natural that we have been developing a significant edge on agricultural technology compared to other countries, and we can leverage this innovativeness into other fields of Research and Development."

 SAF_help_small_farming_communities: "Aid Small Farming Communities"
 SAF_help_small_farming_communities_desc: "Not all farming communities within South Africa are large, due to population settlement, and the crops being grown. With this, an initiative has been created to aid these communities, to promote growth of these communities and to ensure there is a level of diversity in our crops."

 SAF_industrial_farming_equipment: "Industrial Farming Equipment"
 SAF_industrial_farming_equipment_desc: "The Industrial revolution did not only revolutionise industrial efforts but also revolutionised agriculture. We have the means, so we could definitely increase our agricultural efficiency by investing in this kind of machinery."

 SAF_granary_of_africa: "The Granary of Africa"
 SAF_granary_of_africa_desc: "Our agricultural achievements have not gone without notice: South African bread is exported through the continent and beyond, feeding colonist and colonial alike. As such, South Africa is quickly becoming known as the Granary of Africa."

 SAF_south_african_gold: "South Africa's Gold"
 SAF_south_african_gold_desc: "South Africa has significant gold reserves. The presence of gold means we have the means to back up our currency and it's something other countries desire for a similar goal. It would be foolish not to exploit the money that lies below our soil."

 SAF_focus_on_manufacturing: "Focus on Industrial Expansion"
 SAF_focus_on_manufacturing_desc: "In the late 19th century, the industrial revolution has truly taken root in South Africa. The combination of natural resources and manpower to work the factories sets South Africa up perfectly to become an industrial powerhouse!"

 SAF_manufacturing_expansion_plan: "Manufacturing Expansion Plan"
 SAF_manufacturing_expansion_plan_desc: "Hendrik van der Bijl, the innovative engineer behind Eskom, our electricity company, and the Iron and Steel [SAF_getCorp_or_Coop] of South Africa (ISCOR), is perfectly suited to help expand our industrial base."

 SAF_form_idc_of_south_africa: "Form the IDCSA"
 SAF_form_idc_of_south_africa_desc: "The Industrial Development [SAF_getCorp_or_Coop] of South Africa will become a financial institution aiding South Africa's industrial development through the distribution of grants to build certain required industries and contribute to our economic growth, allowing our industry to grow."

 SAF_recruit_native_labour: "Recruit Native Labour"
 SAF_recruit_native_labour_desc: "[SAF_recruit_native_labour_focus_desc]"
 SAF_recruit_native_labour_socialist_desc: "For too long the Natives of this great land have been forced to into the role of a servitor. No more, they shall now be employed to work in our ever expanding industries."
 SAF_recruit_native_labour_default_desc: "While the Afrikaners and white labourers may resent the encroachment of natives on our industrial zones, the reality is that the white labour pool is simply too small to optimally use the industrial potential of South Africa. With the entire workforce available, we are well on our way to become one of the foremost industrial nations of the world."

 SAF_great_repairshop: "The Great Repair Shop"
 SAF_great_repairshop_desc: "Our industry has rapidly evolved over the last years to enable us to properly support a long-term war effort. This has been so successful that by now, South Africa is known as the 'Great Repair Shop', where our allies' equipment in North Africa, the Middle East and Southern Europe goes when it needs repairing."

 SAF_support_iscor_expansion: "[SAF_support_iscor_expansion_focus_name]"
 SAF_support_iscor_expansion_socialist: "Support the Metalworker's Union"
 SAF_support_iscor_expansion_default: "Support ISCOR Expansion"

 SAF_support_iscor_expansion_desc: "[SAF_support_iscor_expansion_focus_desc]"
 SAF_support_iscor_expansion_socialist_desc: "The Metalworker's Union was formed to ensuring the rights of the worker were protected by the Imperialist and their greedy needs. We should support this movement, and ensure it is promoting syndicalist ideals."
 SAF_support_iscor_expansion_default_desc: "The Iron and Steel Corporation of South Africa (ISCOR) has for years been a commercially successful steel corporation. By allowing them to expand their operations, we may expect our steel output to rise markedly."

 SAF_vanderbijlparks_steelworks: "[SAF_vanderbijlparks_steelworks_focus_name]"
 SAF_vanderbijlparks_steelworks_socialist: "Expand the Rand Steelworks"
 SAF_vanderbijlparks_steelworks_default: "Vanderbijlpark's Steelworks"

 SAF_vanderbijlparks_steelworks_desc: "[SAF_vanderbijlparks_steelworks_focus_desc]"
 SAF_vanderbijlparks_steelworks_socialist_desc: "With the Metalworker's Union now firmly influenced by the party, we can see to expanding the newly liberated steelwork industries within South Africa."
 SAF_vanderbijlparks_steelworks_default_desc: "Demand for steel is ever increasing. In light of this fact, Director-General Van der Bijl has overseen an ISCOR acquisition of some 100 square kilometres to build a large new steel plant and a model town surrounding it, living off the steel plant in their vicinity. Reportedly, Van der Bijl himself intends to live in the town he is founding."

 SAF_industrial_innovation: "Industrial Innovation"
 SAF_industrial_innovation_desc: "As we push further with industrial expansion, we must secure the means of innovation to ensure we are on the bleeding edge of industrial technology."

 SAF_post_war_boom: "[SAF_post_war_boom_focus_name]"
 SAF_post_war_boom_socialist: "Socialist Prosperity"
 SAF_post_war_boom_default: "The South African Exports Boom"

 SAF_post_war_boom_desc: "[SAF_post_war_boom_focus_desc]"
 SAF_post_war_boom_socialist_desc: "Through blood, sweat and tears, we have secured a level of prosperity in South Africa that would've never been reached if the Imperialist or the Nationalist agendas had not been removed. We have truly \"broken the chains\"."
 SAF_post_war_boom_default_desc: "While all across the world nations are suffering from the catastrophic effects of war, South Africa has been mostly spared from the devastation. It is only natural then, that the rest of the world is looking towards South Africa for its goods. Exports are booming, and because of this, so is South Africa."

#Socialist
 SAF_johannesburg_convention: "The Johannesburg Convention"
 SAF_johannesburg_convention_desc: "The foul capitalists have been vanquished and a worker's South Africa has been born. It is time we gather at the heart of the revolution: the city of Johannesburg, where the proletariat has long been toiling, to decide our future. A future that belongs to us!"

 SAF_segregation_question: "Abolish Formal Segregation"
 SAF_segregation_question_desc: "Long have the capitalists-imperialists been using simplistic racial rhetoric to convince the white proletarian that his black comrade would be his adversary, allowing them to entrench their own interests and falsifying a sense of need for collaboration by the white worker. It is time we abolish the legislation designed to keep us in their hands."

 SAF_herald_parallel_unionism: "Herald Parallel Unionism"
 SAF_herald_parallel_unionism_desc: "While the common catchphrase 'Workers of the world unite!' seems incompatible with the notion of treating certain workers differently from others, the basis of our state are the trade unions, and some of those trade unions want to reserve access to their membership. It is not our place to intervene in that."

 SAF_la_guma_administration: "The La Guma Administration"
 SAF_la_guma_administration_desc: "As had been assessed long ago, the white proletariat has shown its true colours: they have developed a bourgeois sense of superiority, and their 'revolution' unsurprisingly proved to be a farce. It has been long overdue that we cut the British and Dutch out of the government. South Africa for South AFRICANS!"

 SAF_land_restitution: "Broad Land Reform"
 SAF_land_restitution_desc: "The colonisers have driven the South Africans from their land, confining them to a wholly unfulfilling 8% of South African soil, forcing our people into famine and overpopulation in a nation that is more than large enough for our people. We shall take back what was stolen from us, and give it back to the people!"

 SAF_establish_national_health_service: "Establish a National Health Service"
 SAF_establish_national_health_service_desc: "Healthcare in South Africa has long been managed by the Ministry of the Interior, who saw little desire to fund or modernise the disparate hospitals and nursing schools scattered throughout the country. Under the leadership of Dr. Henry Gluckman, a cooperative member from the left of the South Africa Party and a strong proponent of a nationwide, free and racially equal health service, we shall establish a dedicated Department of Health modelled after the French and British systems."

 SAF_native_republic: "The Native Republic"
 SAF_native_republic_desc: "With the sweeping reforms enacted by La Guma's government, South Africa once again belongs to the South African people, rather than a minority of Europeans pretending a South African identity who lord us around. The Native Republic, belonging to all South Africans regardless of race, is finally a fact."

 SAF_outlaw_colour_bars: "Outlaw Colour Bars"
 SAF_outlaw_colour_bars_desc: "Colour Bars, meant to prevent cheaper black workers from replacing white workers, are an outdated concept now. Every South African is a brother to one another in our move towards socialism and the vile profit motive has been quashed. Such discriminatory measures are nothing but shameful and can't be left in place."

 SAF_restrict_internal_migration: "Restrict Internal Migration"
 SAF_restrict_internal_migration_desc: "As much as we reject the racially based pass laws of the minority regime, one cannot deny the reality that without any restrictions rural South Africans would swarm Cape Town, Johannesburg and Durban, overpopulating the townships and living in squalor. It is simply a necessity to control the migration flow, even if it need not be racially based."

 SAF_end_all_pass_laws: "An End to all Pass Laws"
 SAF_end_all_pass_laws_desc: "The pass laws of the minority regime have left scars that may never heal on the South African psyche, pushing the vast majority of South Africans away except if they were needed to do the existing inhabitants' dirty work. While it is likely that the abolition of these laws will attract many rural South Africans to the cities in hopes to find opportunity, this move is non-negotiable."

 SAF_urban_housing_program: "Urban Housing Expansion"
 SAF_urban_housing_program_desc: "Our loosening of migration restrictions on urban areas has, as could be expected, resulted in a giant inflow from South Africa's less developed rural areas of South Africans looking for new opportunities. Unfortunately our housing facilities can't keep up to the demand and the new migrants live in squalor as a result. The only option left is to build more housing facilities, and building them fast."

 SAF_diversify_higher_education: "Diversify Higher Education"
 SAF_diversify_higher_education_desc: "Traditionally our institutions of higher education have been quite hostile to non-white students, preferring to gate themselves off and leaving non-whites little choice but to go to less prestigious education facilities. Now that we are creating a new and more fair South Africa, it is time we motivate our institutions of higher education to make their student base more representative to all South Africa."

 SAF_revolution_in_practice: "The Revolution in Practice"
 SAF_revolution_in_practice_desc: "The capitalists have been vanquished, but South Africa has not yet been transformed. Today our work begins to change South Africa for once and for all. The dreadful capitalist system must be rooted out thoroughly and from the ground up we can pave the road to the socialist utopia together!"

 SAF_curtail_counterrevolutionary_activity: "Curtail Reactionary Activity"
 SAF_curtail_counterrevolutionary_activity_desc: "Our enemies are many still: Afrikaner Nationalists are trying to lure our Afrikaner worker base into treason by appealing to their skin complexion. Canada and the exiles from the previous government are plotting a monarchist restoration. Tribal chiefs want to preserve their way of life contrary to our values. We need to suppress them all."

 SAF_reform_south_african_police: "Reform the South African Police"
 SAF_reform_south_african_police_desc: "The South African Police has been a strong tool for the previous regime to keep their hold on our nation and to oppress the worker. It is imperative that we reform this rotten institution from the bottom up so that the police force shall defend the population, rather than keep them down."

 SAF_control_the_narrative: "Seize Control over the Narrative"
 SAF_control_the_narrative_desc: "The media is the key to the heart of the people. By assuming control over broadcasting institutions throughout South Africa and filtering the capitalist nonsense inserted by partisan journalists out we can ensure that our population will not be seduced by imperialist lies any longer."

 SAF_seize_industrial_capital: "Seize Our Industrial Capital"
 SAF_seize_industrial_capital_desc: "Since the discovery of natural resources in the rand and the western Cape, South Africa has steadily grown into possibly the lone industrial state in Africa. Unfortunately, South Africans never benefited from it. British men in high hats reaped the benefits of the labour of South Africans and gave us a hunger wage. Not anymore: South African industry will benefit South Africans."

 SAF_tolerate_small_farming_enterprises: "Tolerate Small Farming Enterprises"
 SAF_tolerate_small_farming_enterprises_desc: "While nothing but our wrath shall be directed to the corporations attempting to monopolise the most precious tenet of a civilisation: the food supply, it would not be fair to deprive small family businesses of their livelihood on this basis. While in a very banal way it does resemble capitalism if one works their land and sells the returns for a tidy profit, on a small scale it is acceptable."

 SAF_nationalize_all_farms: "Nationalise Our Agrarian Potential"
 SAF_nationalize_all_farms_desc: "Capitalists have taken our farmlands for themselves and sell food, the most fundamental need of the human being, for profit. It is time we collectivise the agrarian sector, reorganising it into farming cooperatives, in which each farmer works. This will ensure it will stay a fair profession."

 SAF_grab_the_mines: "Appropriate the Mines"
 SAF_grab_the_mines_desc: "South Africa's soil is rich: diamonds, gold, coal... It can all be found right there under our feet. But unfortunately, Rhodes and his successors have taken control over them, forcing miners to shed blood, sweat and tears exhuming diamonds for an extremely low wage while they sell them to jewelries in Ottawa for exorbitantly high prices where tea-sipping aristocrats happily wear them. No longer!"

 SAF_divide_the_spoils: "Divide the Spoils of Class War"
 SAF_divide_the_spoils_desc: "We have spent our time taking what rightfully belongs to the South African from the international capitalist. Of course, there is pain involved in this business. But now that the wealth has flowed into our hands, we can return it to the people, who shall thrive with it!"

 SAF_i_see_you: "I See You!"
 SAF_i_see_you_desc: "Industrial and Commercial Workers' Union, ICU for short - correctly assessed by a white judge to be pronounced as 'I see you'. The black South African did see the white South African, when he was denied access to sidewalks, beaches and jobs by him. And now, through the ICU's action, for perhaps the first time, the white South African sees him too..."

 SAF_organise_natives: "Organise Native Unions"
 SAF_organise_natives_desc: "The black population of South Africa is to a much lesser degree involved in trade unionism. Where the whites have been involved in it for a long time, black trade unions were suppressed and otherwise had trouble organising their work force. Now, with government support, we can change this."

 SAF_encourage_communal_engagement: "Inspire Communal Engagement"
 SAF_encourage_communal_engagement_desc: "Small, often traditionalist communities, are not very inclined to involve themselves into the affairs of the state. But now we are a pluralist nation and we value the engagement of our citizens, so we should work with them to engage them."

 SAF_native_education_program: "Native Education Programme"
 SAF_native_education_program_desc: "Any and all public education in South Africa had been reserved to whites during the previous regime, relegating black South Africans to the goodwill of missionaries and religious institutions. While the quality was passable, it was unsurprisingly riddled with religiosity, the tool to keep the proletariat in line, too. It is time we open up objective education for non-whites."

 SAF_incorporate_saic: "Incorporate the SAIC"
 SAF_incorporate_saic_desc: "To fully ensure the cooperation with the Indian community in South Africa, it is paramount that we incorporate their interest group, the South African Indian Congress, into the government like we did with the Industrial and Commercial Workers' Union."

 SAF_support_saic: "Support the SAIC"
 SAF_support_saic_desc: "While incorporation is perhaps a bit too extreme for such a small diaspora, the South African Indian Congress are the most significant interest group for the Indian South African community. It is important that we support their efforts."

 SAF_full_participation_doctrine: "Inclusive Participation Doctrine"
 SAF_full_participation_doctrine_desc: "If we are to succeed as a truly fair and equal nation, we need every racial group to participate. For this reason we have the Inclusive Participation Doctrine: by engaging with our communities and special programmes, we can ensure that we are not a government of compassionate whites and black intellectuals while the rest of South Africa is apathetic."

 SAF_durban_convention: "The Durban Convention"
 SAF_durban_convention_desc: "We have made tremendous strides in the last few years: the Larneys have been crushed, racial affairs have been made more equitable and South Africa for perhaps the first time since the concept exists, belongs to the South African. Still, there is more work to be done as we pave our road to socialism; and part of that is participation of the public."

 SAF_dethrone_the_paramount_chiefs: "Dethrone the Paramount Chiefs"
 SAF_dethrone_the_paramount_chiefs_desc: "The Paramount Chiefs represent the kowtowing of the native population to the Imperialist and the corruption it imparts. They must be "dethroned", with committees formed for greater representation."

 SAF_found_bechuanaland_election_comm: "Found the Bechuanaland Election Committee"
 SAF_found_bechuanaland_election_comm_desc: "With the Paramount Chiefs removed, we must now move to establish a true form of representation for the inhabitants of Bechuanaland. By setting up BEC's in the settlement dotted throughout the region, we can ensure the Tswana can properly voice their concerns in the South African government."

 SAF_annex_basutoland_and_swaziland: "Annex Basutoland and Swaziland"
 SAF_annex_basutoland_and_swaziland_desc: "Basutoland and Swaziland are quite small, and putting an end to the tribal structures is relatively easy as such. By integrating them in their neighbouring provinces of Eastern Cape and Natal we can assure their continued prosperity as South Africans."

 SAF_protectorate_political_development: "Political Development in the Protectorates"
 SAF_protectorate_political_development_desc: "20th century politics in the protectorates is far and few between. To some degree these provinces are still under the tribal authorities from which all mankind stems eventually. Unfortunately, this state of affairs is much less equitable than our socialist system. Through education, we can change this state of affairs."

 SAF_bechuanland_autonomous_commune: "Establish Bechuanaland Autonomous Commune"
 SAF_bechuanland_autonomous_commune_desc: "Even if it was beholden to the Paramount Chiefs, the Tswana people have had autonomy over their own affairs since times immemorial, even under British administration. It would not be equitable to deprive them of this, thus the Bechuanaland Autonomous Commune is being drafted, which has the right to pass its own laws devolved from our national government."

 SAF_extend_citizenship_to_swazi_sotho: "Extend Citizenship to the Swazi and Sotho"
 SAF_extend_citizenship_to_swazi_sotho_desc: "Now that we have integrated their homeland into our nation, it seems straightforward that the Sotho and Swazi that live there should be extended a South African passport. They'd be stateless on their own land otherwise."

 SAF_ethnic_representation_councils: "Ethnic Representation Councils"
 SAF_ethnic_representation_councils_desc: "Not only the former High Commissioner Territories, but South Africa as a whole is divided by several ethnicities, like the Xhosa, the Zulu and the Ndebele. To ensure the interests of these group are fairly represented, we should establish Ethnic Representation Councils elected by members of those ethnic groups."

 SAF_develop_borderlands: "Develop the Borderlands"
 SAF_develop_borderlands_desc: "The outer layer of South Africa, Bechuanaland and Southern Rhodesia, were much less settled by Europeans and as such not nearly as much developed by them. It is time we redirect some funds to ensure the borderlands adhere to the same standards as inner South Africa, although this will not be easy or cheap. They are South Africans too!"

 SAF_communal_defence_auxiliaries: "Communal Defence Auxiliaries"
 SAF_communal_defence_auxiliaries_desc: "By arming the inhabitants of the (former) protectorates, we can increase the fighting power of our military. Where the racists constantly tried to limit their arms to the Assegai, we shall deliver real guns for those willing to fight for South Africa."

 SAF_complete_the_integration: "Complete the Integration"
 SAF_complete_the_integration_desc: "It has been hard work, but the protectorates are now administrative equals to the rest of our nation, and can no longer be denied to be as much South Africa as Cape Town or Johannesburg."

#Federation
 SAF_the_new_south_africa_act: "The New South Africa Act"
 SAF_the_new_south_africa_act_desc: "The South Africa Act passed by parliament in 1909 has evidently been unsuccessful in keeping resolving the ethnic tensions in South Africa. It has handed the Afrikaner the keys to South Africa and resulted in two ethnic rebellions in the short time that South Africa is a concept. A new South Africa Act will be necessary."

 SAF_milners_kindergarten: "Milner's Kindergarten"
 SAF_milners_kindergarten_desc: "It is high time we root out boorish Boer culture and supplant it with the true beacon of civilisation: the queen's English. South Africa is a British dominion and until simplistic concepts such as Afrikaner culture are a thing of the past, there will be no end to ethnic strife."

 SAF_herald_english_as_sole_language: "Herald our English Language"
 SAF_herald_english_as_sole_language_desc: "English is superior to Afrikaans in every way. Many more South Africans, especially those who speak Afrikaans, can already speak it. It is not a crude patois and it does not sound like German. It is the language of business and the language you use when you interact with the Americans and the rest of the Empire. It should be heralded!"

 SAF_attract_exile_settlement: "Attract Exile Settlement"
 SAF_attract_exile_settlement_desc: "Fearful of losing the Afrikaner's dominant demographic position to the British-South African, Hertzog has tried to make South Africa as unattractive to exiles as possible, trying to get them to go Australasia or Canada instead. Not for any longer. The Federation welcomes those who pledge their loyalty to the Union Jack."

 SAF_support_british_companies: "Support British Companies"
 SAF_support_british_companies_desc: "The Afrikaners had been trying to get their own kind into entrepreneurialism, resulting in some competition from Afrikaners, but it's clear that the Englishman has a better sense of business and that for economic growth one should look at the Englishman. Inefficient subsidies shall now be directed towards those who actually can do business without them!"

 SAF_banish_afrikaans_from_bureaucracy: "Banish Afrikaans from the Bureaucracy"
 SAF_banish_afrikaans_from_bureaucracy_desc: "Translating everything to Dutch is horribly inefficient, and only serves to help the language survive. We should thoroughly anglicise our bureaucracy, forcing the Afrikaners to speak English when they want to interact with the government, and we will finally set in motion the assimilation we had been looking to achieve for a long time."

 SAF_close_afrikaner_institutions: "Close Afrikaner Institutions"
 SAF_close_afrikaner_institutions_desc: "All those Afrikaner Institutions founded following the formation of the Union of South Africa have only served to bring South Africa suffering. They influenced and lobbied the government which ultimately led to the illegal republic, and perpetuate ethnic tension by defending Afrikaner culture. Not anymore."

 SAF_teachers_from_the_empire: "Teachers from the Empire"
 SAF_teachers_from_the_empire_desc: "By bringing in teachers from all corners of the Empire, from Canada and the West Indies to Australia and New Zealand, we can finally entrench English as the dominant language of South Africa, and put an end to the misery and ethnic conflict the different languages of the nation have caused ever since Britain's ascendancy once and for all."

 SAF_tea_time_for_south_africa: "Tea Time for South Africa"
 SAF_tea_time_for_south_africa_desc: "Now that we have entrenched our position, it will be under our stewardship that we shall see to it that South Africa will never drift from the Empire again. South Africa is, through and through, a member of the Anglosphere now, and it shall remain that way!"

 SAF_reconciliation_take_two: "A New Attempt at Reconciliation"
 SAF_reconciliation_take_two_desc: "The hope that we had finally ended the sectarian violence that plagued South Africa since the British takeover of the Cape Colony in the early 19th century has been shattered. Once again, our country was split among language lines over the direction of our country, and once again the devastation has been great."

 SAF_federal_elections: "Federal Elections"
 SAF_federal_elections_desc: "The system in which we de-facto handed political power in South Africa to the Afrikaners on the basis that they were the majority of South Africans with white skin has terribly backfired, but this does not mean the concept of democracy has lost meaning. By implementing additional measures assuring the power of the states, and of the British diaspora, we can maintain our parliamentary system."

 SAF_amnesty_arrangement: "War Amnesty Arrangement"
 SAF_amnesty_arrangement_desc: "Some hawks want to prosecute as many Afrikaners as possible for following Malan to his illegitimate republic, but we have to be realistic: this will only breed resentment and at the end of the day they simply followed the orders of an elected government, even if that elected government tread outside the bounds of the law. It would be most wise to only go after those who were closest to Malan."

 SAF_symmetric_veteran_stipend: "Symmetric Veteran Stipends"
 SAF_symmetric_veteran_stipend_desc: "No matter on which side of the war you fought, you should receive compensation for what you did for South Africa. Some may find it distasteful that we would fund those who fought against the Empire but we ought to recognise that on the ground one often has no choice, and that the course they followed was that of the elected Prime Minister. They cannot help it, and we cannot leave them behind."

 SAF_establish_reconciliation_commission: "Restore Bilingualism"
 SAF_establish_reconciliation_commission_desc: "Because of the Pietermaritzburg administration there was a tendency to only ever use English, but we should restore the status of Dutch (including Afrikaans as decided in the 1920s). It is a pipe dream that we would ever convince the proud Afrikaner people to abandon their mother tongue, and attempting to do so will only breed a movement of resistance against our government. We need a united nation."

 SAF_curb_german_influence: "Curb German Influence"
 SAF_curb_german_influence_desc: "Following their victory in the Weltkrieg, Germany has been trying to expand its influence in South Africa, which it seems to have viewed as the least secure corner of the British Empire, which might be lured to their side. It is likely that Germany has been stoking republican sentiment which eventually resulted in so much suffering in our nation. It is time we curb the vile influence the Germans are exerting over us."

 SAF_rebuilding_from_the_war: "Reconstruction Efforts"
 SAF_rebuilding_from_the_war_desc: "Our nation has been scarred by its third war between the Boers and the British in a century. Now that the most pressing issues to ensure the same will not happen again have been dealt with, it is time that the government puts its full weight into the reconstruction. From the ashes will arise a new Federal South Africa, which will hopefully last longer than the Union."

 SAF_peace_and_prosperity: "Peace and Prosperity"
 SAF_peace_and_prosperity_desc: "The era of struggle between the British and Afrikaner races is finally put to an end. From the ashes has arisen a more united South Africa under a federal system, in which each province, now state, can handle its own affairs. Afrikaner and Englishman alike shall march in peace to a new nationhood."

#Military
 SAF_military_expansion: "Military Expansion"
 SAF_military_expansion_desc: "The South African armed forces leave a lot to be desired. While they performed admirably during the Great War, the government has struggled to keep them modernised since and the reluctance of many Boers to support a military that would aid the British has left little incentive for expanding them. However, the return of international tensions has lead to a revisiting of the topic - some expansion is necessary for national security."

 SAF_modernise_rifles: "Modernise the Rifles"
 SAF_modernise_rifles_desc: "One of the most pressing issues facing the army is their weapons - many units are still using Lee-Enfield rifles dating back to the Great War, even as technology marches on. With newer, more effective rifles becoming increasingly common, we owe it to ourselves to obtain modernised guns of our own."

 SAF_expand_cape_corps: "Expand the Cape Corps"
 SAF_expand_cape_corps_desc: "The Cape Corps is the first 'coloured' unit to be formed in South Africa, having its history stretch all the way back to 1781 with the 'Corps Bastaard Hottentoten' - Corps of Bastards Hottentot. More serving in a non combatant roles, Jan Smuts had wished to expand their roles to include front line infantry and to be included into other branches of the military - and we will make that a reality."

 SAF_south_african_military_college: "South African Military College"
 SAF_south_african_military_college_desc: "With the expansion of the South African military to now include an air force and a navy, it's only natural that these services are provided a place to train the next military minds of the South African armed forces. The college grounds is an expansion of the old Dutch East India Company 'Militere Kweekskool' located in Pretoria, where it helps develop local cadets."

 SAF_recruitment_drive: "Recruitment Drive"
 SAF_recruitment_drive_desc: "Manpower is a very real concern for any possible military operation - even putting aside the largely white army that South Africa has historically fielded, our immediate neighbours are empires with larger populations, as are most enemies we could be fighting abroad. Every effort must be put into ensuring that we can recruit enough men to maintain an effective army."

 SAF_expand_dockyards: "Expand the Dockyards"
 SAF_expand_dockyards_desc: "Several of our ports and docks have seen better days, with many not having been in service since the Great War. With renewed investment and expertise from abroad, we have begun to overhaul these docks to better assist our fledgling naval forces."

 SAF_new_destroyer_designs: "New Destroyer Designs"
 SAF_new_destroyer_designs_desc: "With the threat of submarines, comes the advancement of Destroyer Chassis to hunt for the new wolves of the sea. Armed with the latest designs, we can defeat these threats and assert our superiority over the Cape."

 SAF_new_cruiser_designs: "New Cruiser Designs"
 SAF_new_cruiser_designs_desc: "While fully-fledged battleships are likely beyond the capacities of our naval industries, there has been interest in the navy for a foray into cruiser designs - medium-sized craft capable for being fitted for either escort or capital duties. These could be produced in South African shipyards, and allow us to fill in a naval niche we presently lack."

 SAF_continue_britains_legacy: "Continue Britain's Legacy"
 SAF_continue_britains_legacy_desc: "Whether we like it or not, our military heritage is distinctly tied to Britain's, an exposure that has shaped our strategic thinking towards a naval direction. We sit on a stretch of greatly strategic water - trade and naval vessels that cannot pass through the Suez Canal must go around the Cape to get from Europe from the Indian Ocean, and vice versa. We should play to this strength."

 SAF_strengthen_the_navy: "Strengthen the Navy"
 SAF_strengthen_the_navy_desc: "Whether they are deployed at home or abroad, control of the oceans will be crucial to most military operations we might undertake, either to defend our country or to aid foreign ventures. As such, efforts must be made to ensure that the South African navy is up to any task needed of it."

 SAF_trade_route_protection: "Trade Route Protection"
 SAF_trade_route_protection_desc: "Both our military and civilian economies are dependent on foreign trade for proper functioning: we have metals that we must be able to export and strategic materials that we must be able to import. We must be able to ensure that these trade routes remain secure from raiding, as well as any troop transports abroad."

 SAF_retrofitting_scheme: "Retrofitting Scheme"
 SAF_retrofitting_scheme_desc: "In spite of our best efforts, our naval production capabilities will never be extensive. In the event that it becomes necessary to pad out our navy, it's been suggested to retrofit modern weapons onto older naval chassis. It's not ideal, but it is faster and cheaper than building a new boat from scratch and could make the difference when it counts."

 SAF_greater_reach: "Greater Reach"
 SAF_greater_reach_desc: "It's an increasingly likely possibility that our naval forces will need to engage enemies far away from South Africa. Although we have never needed to give much thought to long-distance operations owing to our geopolitical position, it's an aspect we can no longer afford to ignore."

 SAF_troop_specialistion: "Troop Specialisation"
 SAF_troop_specialistion_desc: "Amphibious operations are looking to a skill increasingly in demand among the armed forces of the world - on all corners of the planet, militaries are looking into ways to perform naval invasions in less time, with more troops, and to greater effect than ever before. It's looking more and more to be an arms race - and we would do well not to be left behind."

 SAF_artillery_integration: "Artillery Integration"
 SAF_artillery_integration_desc: "One of the greatest lessons learned from the Great War is that modern artillery is a very frightening thing to be shot with. Two decades removed, large guns do not seem to have gotten any less scary - indeed, it looks like fire support will be a crucial piece of armies for some time yet. It's time to start fleshing out our artillery tactics."

 SAF_casualty_minimisation: "Casualty Minimisation"
 SAF_casualty_minimisation_desc: "South Africa has a limited manpower pool to draw from compared to most nations we could expect to be fighting. However, the advancement of modern medicine and the treatment of battlefield trauma has allowed for the development of programmes and protocols to ensure that men are patched up and returned back to service in good time."

 SAF_special_boat_service: "Special Boat Service"
 SAF_special_boat_service_desc: "The specialisation of just a few troops is not enough - the amphibious operations of the next war are expected have troop counts in the tens of thousands, if not even more, encompassing several divisions' worth of men. To ensure that we are prepared for any eventuality, we have decided to expand our efforts and create a dedicated unit to amphibious invasions and maritime operations."

 SAF_radar_installations: "RADAR Installations"
 SAF_radar_installations_desc: "Lately, naval researchers have been claiming to us that they have developed a potentially groundbreaking technology — a means of detecting objects through the use of radio waves, something they have called "Radio Detection and Ranging". The acronym is, of course, being debated pretty heavily, but the technology itself seems sound, and could provide a large boon."

 SAF_new_fighter_designs: "New Fighter Designs"
 SAF_new_fighter_designs_desc: "Aviation technology has improved by leaps and bounds since the Great War - in particular, military aircraft have been getting faster, stronger, and more agile with each year. What was previously something of a secondary aspect of war is becoming increasingly more practical as planes become more capable of various tasks, making controlling airspace a necessity for our military."

 SAF_new_bomber_designs: "New Bomber Designs"
 SAF_new_bomber_designs_desc: "While the concept of aerial bombing is not a new one, it is one that has not been employed in Africa at length, nor even that common in Europe during the Great War. However, advances in aviation technology have made air-to-ground bombing of military production targets a much more practical strategy than it was before - something we should capitalise on."

 SAF_modern_cas: "Modern Air Support"
 SAF_modern_cas_desc: "Air power, long envisioned as the "third dimension of warfare", is increasingly living up to its name — as aircraft becomes more advanced and air-ground coordination becomes more prevalent in strategic thinking, it is increasingly feasible for small bombers to act as a sort of aerial artillery, moving where needed and bombing ground targets. This "close air support" may well become a potent force."

 SAF_develop_air_force: "Develop the Air Force"
 SAF_develop_air_force_desc: "The decision to shift our strategy into one that emphasises the role of air power has already led to the appearance of more air-oriented military theorists, it has been a very spontaneous development without much direction. Giving it that direction should lead to a more cohesive doctrine, one that will fit the kind of wars that we can expect to fight."

 SAF_local_aviation_industry: "A Local Aviation Industry"
 SAF_local_aviation_industry_desc: "You can't have an air force without planes, and anyone who tells you differently should probably not be allowed to speak on the matter. Unfortunately, we are a long way away from established aviation production hubs, making imports a difficult process. By fostering a local aviation industry, geared towards providing military aircraft, we can get around this."

 SAF_integrated_air_recon: "Integrated Air Recon"
 SAF_integrated_air_recon_desc: "With greater coordination between the Air and Army branches of the South Africa's armed forces, the use of Scout Planes has become the backbone of this coordination. With eyes in the sky, relaying information to provide commanders better planning and strategies against the enemy forces."

 SAF_doctrine_of_our_own: "A Doctrine of Our Own"
 SAF_doctrine_of_our_own_desc: "By no means are we obligated to follow the course of the British - while they historically influenced our doctrines, their naval inclination is arguably a distraction from more helpful courses. Indeed, some prefer putting the navy to this side in favour of technologies in land and air - mechanisation and air force initiatives already show great promise."

 SAF_heavy_armour_focus: "Heavy Armour"
 SAF_heavy_armour_focus_desc: "South Africa is one of relatively few places on earth with significant sources of chromium - and we have a lot of it. Fortuitously, chromium is a critical aspect in the production of heavy armour, where it strengthens the material, and allows it to remain strong under the extreme heat of enemy fire. With this knowledge, we can exploit our reserves to make tanks of great resilience."

 SAF_mechanised_warfare: "Mechanised Warfare"
 SAF_mechanised_warfare_desc: "While we may have the strategic resources necessary to make heavy armour, we lack the industrial base to make its production an easy affair. Some in the military suggest an alternate course of light mechanisation - using trucks and armoured troop carriers to create faster divisions that would be easier to produce and supply than hulking heavy tanks."

 SAF_increase_tank_production: "Increase Tank Production"
 SAF_increase_tank_production_desc: "With armour rolling off the production line and into the field, we have begun to learn more about the practical implementation of armoured warfare theory. Increasingly, our forces understand how to use these weapons of modern war to their greatest effect - using them to pierce lines, neutralise strongpoints, overwhelm enemy defences, and avoid dangerous attacks. Our knowledge grows with each battle and each exercise."

 SAF_local_arms: "Local Arms"
 SAF_local_arms_desc: "Inevitably, guns win wars - a soldier that is unarmed can't be expected to perform very well. While we might be able to rely on imports somewhat, it is far from reliable sourcing - to ensure that South African soldiers have the weapons to fight their enemies, we must ensure that they have access to South African arms, and this means building a native arms industry."

 SAF_sturdy_designs: "Sturdy Designs"
 SAF_sturdy_designs_desc: "The yields of our forays into native mechanised production are not simply tactical - our engineers have been learning a great deal about the nuances of production and the importance of foolproof design, even if it took some accidents to get there. But every accident is a lesson, and our designs have been carrying fewer and fewer aspects that can be used incorrectly."

 SAF_armoured_corps: "Armoured Corps"
 SAF_armoured_corps_desc: "To overcome the lack of manpower and to maximise the Army's effectiveness, theorists have been increasingly advocating for an expansion of armour production and the establish the creation of a proper armoured corps to better concentrate armoured forces and their command. The aim with this initiative is to allow armoured forces to mass more effectively and present a more coordinated and overwhelming presence."

 SAF_rapid_warfare: "Rapid Warfare"
 SAF_rapid_warfare_desc: "While much of war has always rested on manoeuvre, modern warfare is increasingly revealing itself to emphasise the importance of rapid tempo and even more rapid movement. By putting together our developments in aerial recon, mechanised warfare, and military command, we have forged a military capable swift planning and swifter execution. Our enemies have fallen one step behind, and the gap only grows."

 SAF_black_monday_desc: "Black Monday has struck our country harshly due to our dependence on German trade. Unrest is growing and our economy falters, we must find an ambitious solution to this problem, and quickly!"

 SAF_segregation: "Racial Segregation"
 SAF_segregation_desc: "South Africa is a divided nation. While the vast majority of the population belongs to the various native ethnic African groups, socio-economic power is held by the white European minority. This group is in turn is divided between the Afrikaners, the Dutch-speaking descendants of the original Dutch colonists, the majority of the white population in the Cape Province, Orange Free State and Transvaal, and the British who form the majority of the white population in Natal and Rhodesia.\n\nWhile segregation under white rule is not something that will be resolved overnight, likely taking decades for us to properly address, steps can still be taken to improve things... or make them worse."

 SAF_apartheid: "Apartheid"

 SAF_african_gold_idea: "South African Gold"
 SAF_african_gold_idea_desc: "South Africans come from a mix stock of native Africans, Europeans, and from other areas of the world. Though this hasn't watered down their Dutch ancestors greed for gold. The touch of it, the smell of it..."

 SAF_wavering_dominion: "The Wavering Dominion"
 SAF_wavering_dominion_desc: "While officially part of the British Empire, many Afrikaners feel little allegiance to the British Empire or the Entente, and would prefer establishing an unaligned republic instead. As such, South African participation in the homecoming is far from certain."
 SAF_wavering_dominion_homecoming_desc: "While officially part of the British Empire, many Afrikaners feel little allegiance to the British Empire or the Entente, and would prefer establishing an unaligned republic instead."

 SAF_neutral_dominion: "The Neutral Dominion"
 SAF_neutral_dominion_desc: "While officially part of the British Empire, many Afrikaners feel little allegiance to the British Empire or the Entente, and would prefer establishing an unaligned republic instead. As such, the South African government has decided to declare neutrality in the Third Weltkrieg."

 SAF_idea_slavery: "Slavery in the High Commissioner Territories"
 SAF_idea_slavery_desc: "Slavery has never been completely rooted out in the High Commissioner Territories of Basutoland, Swaziland and especially Bechuanaland on account of the tribal structures in these territories covertly defending the institution. The fact that these barbarous practices continue on despite attempts to curtail it forms a stain on South African honour."

 SAF_idea_cj_of_the_hct: "The Justice System of the High Commissioner Territories"
 SAF_idea_cj_of_the_hct_desc: "The justice system of the High Commissioner Territories is a reform in the HCT under South Africa's control. Under the terms of the arrangement, a chief justice will be appointed who will serve as the Chief Judicial Officer in the territories. The Chief Justice will then ensure that the law is also properly maintained in these autonomous territories."

 SAF_idea_sovereign_currency: "The South African Rand"
 SAF_idea_sovereign_currency_desc: "Named after the Witwatersrand where South Africa's goldmines are located, the Rand is South Africa's newfound sovereign currency following the declaration of the republic and the subsequent consideration that continued usage of the South African Pound was undesirable."

 SAF_idea_native_trust_and_land_act: "Native Trust and Land Act"
 SAF_idea_native_trust_and_land_act_desc: "The Native Trust and Land Act increases the amount of land allocated to the reserves of South Africa's native majority from around 8% to 13%. While this is still a relatively small amount given the native population makes up about 60% of South Africa's population, it at least ensures that a segment of South Africa's land is designated to them, albeit that it will likely mainly go to the elite."

 SAF_idea_asiatic_land_tenure_act: "Asiatic Land Tenure Act"
 SAF_idea_asiatic_land_tenure_act_desc: "The Asiatic Land Tenure Act confines the ownership of land by Asian South Africans to certain designated areas, especially in Transvaal and Natal, to protect the competitiveness of white shop-owners and to assuage concerns of Indian encroachment upon white neighbourhoods."

 SAF_idea_krugerpark: "The Kruger National Park"
 SAF_idea_krugerpark_desc: "Established in 1926 out of the Sabi Game Reserve which was established in 1895 by the Boer republic of Transvaal, the Kruger National Park is one of the largest game reserves in Africa. Recently expanded, fortunate tourists from around the world are trickling in to view the animals either from tourist cars, a new concept since 1927, or the more classical 'Round in Nine' tours by train on the track from Komatipoort to Tzaneen."

 SAF_idea_great_trek_reenactment: "Great Trek Centenary Celebrations"
 SAF_idea_great_trek_reenactment_desc: "This year it is exactly 100 years ago that the Dutch settlers of the Cape Colony embarked on their great migration into the South African hinterland to escape the influence of the British colonial administration. To celebrate this joyous occasion, a grand parade of ox-wagons follows 'Die Pad van Suid-Afrika' from Cape Town to Pretoria, organising Afrikaner-Nationalist festivities in the towns and cities they pass through."

 SAF_idea_kariba_dam: "Kariba Dam"
 SAF_idea_kariba_dam_desc: "The impressive Kariba Dam dams off the Zambezi River in the north of Southern Rhodesia, inducing large quantities of electricity when water is allowed to stream through the structure. This large amount of energy enables industrial activity in Southern Rhodesia and beyond."

 SAF_idea_sa_mathematical_society: "South African Mathematical Society"
 SAF_idea_sa_mathematical_society_desc: "The South African Mathematical Society is a society of highly educated South Africans, who, despite what the society's name would imply, extend their research into not only mathematics but also physics and chemistry."

 SAF_sabc_idea: "South African Broadcasting Corporation"
 SAF_sabc_idea_desc: "The South African Broadcasting Corporation has been established by South Africa's parliament and shortly thereafter acquired the African Broadcasting Company from businessman I.W. Schlesinger. It functions as South Africa's national radio network."

 SAF_idea_native_advisory_councils: "Native Advisory Councils"
 SAF_idea_native_advisory_councils_desc: "Hearing out the issues on the minds of our native population is key to keeping the peace. Rather than pretending they don't exist, we should give them the time of day and respond to their problems which can often be fixed rather easily. We will be rewarded with cooperation and stability."

 SAF_idea_syndicalist_government: "Syndicalist Constitution"
 SAF_idea_syndicalist_government_desc: "The new provisional syndicalist government of South Africa has chosen to draft a completely new and independent constitution for South Africa. This constitution shall form the basis of the new South African state, and likely influence strongly how it will take form."

 SAF_de_facto_segregation: "Unofficial Racial Segregation"
 SAF_de_facto_segregation_desc: "Despite the new syndicalist government's measures to dismantle the system of segregation that has been in place in South Africa since its formation, the situation on the ground is that segregation is still omnipresent, with the racial groups of South Africa, especially white South Africans, in many cases distancing themselves from their fellow South Africans with a different skin colour as much as possible."

 SAF_idea_native_republic: "Native Republic"
 SAF_idea_native_republic_desc: "The new Africanist government of South Africa has heralded the so-called 'Native Republic' principle. This principle holds that South Africa is principally a nation of the original black African population over the white population that ruled it for so long."

 SAF_idea_slum_formation: "Township Formation"
 SAF_idea_slum_formation_desc: "With old segregational measures being slowly relaxed, the black population of rural South Africa are on the move: new people arrive en masse in cities like Cape Town, Johannesburg and Durban and local authorities have little chance at catching up with building accommodations, leaving them to build their own shacks in areas rife with crime and violence."

 SAF_idea_reactionary_activities: "Reactionary Non-Cooperation"
 SAF_idea_reactionary_activities_desc: "Not all South Africans have come around to the idea of a socialist, inclusive future. Especially whites, both Afrikaners and English-speakers, and the old black elites, often still respected for their statuses as tribal chiefs, are distressed at the idea and are actively trying to undermine the socialist system in the hopes of returning to the old system of oppression. Unfortunately, the narrow education standards of the previous regime mean that their expertise is nowhere to be found among loyalists."

 SAF_idea_converting_to_socialism: "Conversion to a Syndicalist Economy"
 SAF_idea_converting_to_socialism_desc: "The South African Economy is still widely a capitalist one. It is now the goal of the government to properly convert the economy into socialist one similar to those of the European states. This will be a painful affair at first, but the rewards will be worth it."

 SAF_idea_syndicalist_economy: "Syndicalist Economy"
 SAF_idea_syndicalist_economy_desc: "Wage slavery under capitalist cruelty has been fully abolished under the guidance of South Africa's socialist government. The way to it has been painful, but the newly established trade union-centred economy is working well now."

 SAF_idea_low_participation: "Low Participation"
 SAF_idea_low_participation_desc: "While the new South Africa is inclusive towards all and values the input of every worker regardless of ethnicity, participation is low. Many South Africans just want to live their lives and have little affiliation with politics, of which they were excluded before regardless. As a result, the proletarian electorate is mostly made up of white workers and non-white intellectuals and activists, while most of the black labour force does not participate, despite being allowed to."

 SAF_idea_native_trade_unions: "Native Trade Unions"
 SAF_idea_native_trade_unions_desc: "In order to strengthen the participation of the native South African population the government has been supporting the establishment of local native trade unions, strengthening the state in the process."

 SAF_idea_native_education: "Native Education Programme"
 SAF_idea_native_education_desc: "Unlike the barbaric previous South African government, socialist South Africa cares for all its citizens. No longer will the native population need to be brainwashed by religious institutions to become learned, the government shall provide."

 SAF_idea_dismantling_tribal_structures: "Dismantling Tribal Structures"
 SAF_idea_dismantling_tribal_structures_desc: "The new socialist government of South Africa is not interested in maintaining the archaic monarchies in their lands. South Africans should look to the state that cares for them instead of a few chiefs born in the right family."

 SAF_idea_ethnic_rep_councils: "Ethnic Representation Councils"
 SAF_idea_ethnic_rep_councils_desc: "To replace the previous institution of paramount chiefs, the socialist government has instead established Ethnic Representation Councils, directly elected by the people they represent. They will instead advise the government on tribal matters."

 SAF_idea_white_flight: "White Flight"
 SAF_idea_white_flight_desc: "The syndicalist takeover has caused great distress to the white upper class of South Africa. Suddenly deprived of their protections by the government, many of them are emigrating to places they consider more friendly to their interests. Unfortunately for South Africa, they are taking their expertise with them."

 SAF_idea_new_farmers: "Inexperienced Farmers"
 SAF_idea_new_farmers_desc: "We have taken and redistributed the farmlands stolen from us by the European imperialists, but unfortunately many of those who have now received the right to work the land are relatively inexperienced farmers. It will take some time for the farming outputs to adjust to the new status-quo."

 SAF_idea_compromised_intelligence: "Compromised Intelligence"

 SAF_idea_harassed_army_personnel: "Harassed Troops"
 SAF_idea_harassed_army_personnel_desc: "Not everyone in South Africa is pleased with the war. Certain elements in our society have come to harass service members for their audacity to fight in the war."

 SAF_idea_less_nonviolent_resistance: "Lull in Non-Violent Resistance"
 SAF_idea_less_nonviolent_resistance_desc: "Non-violent resistance is the order of the day in South Africa as the popular majority of native Africans protests the equal rights they are denied. In the interest of the war however, the ICU has called off some of the actions."

 SAF_idea_bittereinder_resistance: "Bittereinder Resistance"
 SAF_idea_bittereinder_resistance_desc: "Many Afrikaners have still not accepted our victory in the Boer war and continue to resist our rightful triumph. Something will need to be done if we are to return to stable government."

 SAF_idea_anglicisation: "Anglicisation Efforts"
 SAF_idea_anglicisation_desc: "Three times South Africa has been drenched in blood because the Boers are too primitive to enable an understanding with us. Not any more. This time, their crude Dutch patois shall be eradicated, and South Africa shall identify with the Empire forever more."

 SAF_idea_reconciliation: "Reconciliation Efforts"
 SAF_idea_reconciliation_desc: "A third Boer War has been fought and, once again, the British have come out on top. Once more, the people of South Africa have to live with the result and the lost sons, and once again there is a desire to reconcile our differences. Perhaps this third time is the charm."

 SAF_nuweveld_decisions_desc: "The wild lands of Bechuanaland have been mostly untouched by civilisation, not in the last place because the Tswana people secured themselves the protection of the United Kingdom.

 SAF_third_boer_war_decisions: "The Third Boer War"
 SAF_third_boer_war_decisions_desc: "Once again the interests of the British colonists and the Afrikaner descendants of the Dutch colonists of South Africa have clashed, and South Africa is on fire once more. In a cruel reversal of fates, it is now the British who have seceded from the dominion of their own making, which under the influence of Afrikaner Nationalists attempts to abandon the imperial fold."
 SAF_ryneveld_doctrine_decisions: "Ryneveld Doctrine"
 SAF_ryneveld_doctrine_decisions_desc: "The Ryneveld Doctrine, formulated by generals Jan Smuts and Pierre van Ryneveld, sets out that the former colonies belonging to the United Kingdom, lost after their collapse at the end for the Weltkrieg, cannot be left in anarchy until a coherent native force that might threaten western civilisation in South Africa forms. In the name of our national security, it is vital that we get these colonies back and expand our dominion over southern and eastern Africa."

 SAF_black_monday_decisions_desc: "During the 1920s the South African government opted to intensify its economic ties to the Kaiserreich in the hopes of alleviating the ill effects of the Great Depression, with only limited effect. Now that Germany has been hit by its own national crisis, the effects have quickly expanded into South Africa's manufacturing sector.

 SAF_conquer_natal_mission_desc: "Conquering the rebellious province of Natal must have the utmost priority: as a coastal province, it has can serve as a transit point for Khaki forces flowing into South Africa if not swiftly pacified.

 SAF_intervene_south_west_desc: "Although South West Africa has never been de jure part of the British Empire, South Africa has administered the territory between the successful pacification of the territory and the ratification of the treaty of Copenhagen. South West Africa also hosts a relatively significant population of Afrikaner 'Dorsland Trekkers', rendering the territory interesting for Afrikaner Nationalists."
 SAF_intervene_northern_rhodesia: "Intervene in Northern Rhodesia"
 SAF_intervene_northern_rhodesia_desc: "The colony of Northern Rhodesia has been a contentious area for a while. Having been the connecting area between Portuguese Angola and Mozambique, and German South West and East Africa, the region has been desired by both these powers. Great Britain originally managed to secure it in their attempt to establish a continuous land corridor from the Cape to Cairo, but when the Empire fell apart like a house of cards in 1925 Germany took away with it. Now that the Germans are gone, we are here to reclaim it!"

However, south of the River Zambezi it is part of Jan Smuts' designs for a greater South African dominion which would be able to compete with Canada and Australasia. Besides, the Mozambican ports would be a great boon for our industry along the Witwatersrand and the region could serve as a buffer zone between South Africa proper and non-South African part of Africa."

 SAF_intervene_taganyika_desc: "[TZN.GetNameDefCap] has never been part of the British Empire, but it is in the way on the road to the other centre of gravity of British African colonialism: Kenya.

 SAF_intervene_zanzibar: "Enforce the Zanzibar Protectorate"
 SAF_intervene_zanzibar_desc: "The establishment of a protectorate over the Sultanate of Zanzibar is famous for having been the shortest war. The relationship became defunct after the collapse of the Empire, during which Germany showed its true colours and occupied the sultanate ignoring the Zanzibar-Heligoland Treaty between Britain and Germany entirely. It is our duty to restore the rightful order."
 SAF_intervene_kenya: "Enforce the East Africa Protectorate"
 SAF_intervene_kenya_desc: "The East Africa Protectorate in Kenya has historically served as the point of gravity in British-controlled East Africa, and the highlands of it host the third largest population of white settlers in what is supposed to be British Africa behind the Union of South Africa itself and Northern Rhodesia.

 SAF_KR_gathering_storm_desc: "Some would say South Africa is the place where the British Empire's decline became visible to the world: the trouble they had pacifying the insurgent Boers laying bare the rot which would later cost them the Great War. Britain eventually did prevail against them, and from the ashes arose the Union of South Africa in 1910, a British Dominion. Since then, the Empire collapsed, and now South Africa, in its new role as the last vanguard of British influence on the African continent, is at a crossroads: is its dominion status beneficial as prime minister Jan Smuts asserts? Or has the time come for South Africa to seize its destiny for itself?"

### Intro Screen ###
 SAF_country_intro_header: "The Union of South Africa"
 SAF_country_intro_content: "Formed in 1910 as a merger of the various British possessions in South Africa - the Cape Colony, Natal, Transvaal, and the Orange Free State - after the Second Boer War, the Union of South Africa remains as the last remnants of British presence in Africa.\n\nBut the dominion is wavering: the white Afrikaner population yearns back to the independence of the Boer republics of old, while on the other side of the political spectrum syndicalism, already influential in the region since before the Commune of France or the Union of Britain materialised, is creeping into the minds of the impoverished underclass, of every racial group, who are chafing under the effects of the economic downturn.\n\nThe Union's politics revolve around a two-party system: the South African Party of General Jan Smuts, and the National Party of general J.B.M. Hertzog. A smaller party, the Labour Party, currently divided into two opposing factions, also holds a presence in the South African Parliament. Between 1924 and 1929, they ruled with the National Party in a coalition government, but after their failure to tame the Great Depression, the South African Party secured a majority again, first with the help of breakaway Nationalists, and then, after 1933, after being credited for relieving the effects of the Great Depression, on its own."

 SAF_country_intro_header_1: "Race in South Africa"
 SAF_country_intro_content_1: "South Africa's population is perhaps the most diverse in all of Africa, but racism and segregation are institutionalised and omnipresent.\n\nThe white European population forms the top of South Africa's racial hierarchy; they hold socio-economic power in the nation and enforce a degree of segregation throughout South Africa. The group is divided between the Afrikaners, the descendants of Dutch colonists who arrived in the Cape during Dutch rule, who hold political power owing to being the majority of the almost exclusively white electorate, and the British South Africans, English-speaking descendants of colonists who arrived in the 19th century, who hold most economic power, although this is shifting somewhat to the Afrikaner advantage in recent years.\n\nOf the non-white population, the so-called 'Coloured' community enjoys the most respect. This group is made up of people of mixed heritage and most of them speak Afrikaans, the same language as white Afrikaners. They make up the majority of population in the western Cape Province, and make up the largest part of the non-white property-based voters in that same province as well as in Southern Rhodesia.\n\nThen there is the Asiatic group: South Africans of Asian descent. The majority in this group are former indentured workers from British India or their descendants, who live primarily in Natal and to a smaller extent in Transvaal. In the Cape one can also find the Cape Malays, who were brought here from Maritime Southeast Asia by the Dutch in the 17th and 18th centuries.\n\nThe least respected are the original (native) black Africans. Most of them belong to one of several Bantu peoples, the Xhosa, the Zulu, the Sotho or one of several smaller tribal groups. Despite making up the majority of the South African population by far, they have very little political power, even in the provinces where non-whites can theoretically vote, where very few of them fulfil the needed property requirements. With an entrenched white electorate, hopes for reform are dim."

 SAF_country_intro_header_2: "The South Africa Act"
 SAF_country_intro_content_2: "The South Africa Act of 1909 passed by Westminster serves as the Union's constitution: the Union of South Africa is a unitary state, rather than a federation, with each colony's parliaments abolished and replaced with provincial councils.\n\nThe national Parliament consists of two parts: the Volksraad and Senate. The Volksraad members are elected mostly by the country's white minority under first past the post, although the franchise varies depending upon the province. In the Cape and Southern Rhodesia, a qualified franchise based upon property and education requirements is in place, while the vote is white-only everywhere else. The Senate is appointed by an electoral college consisting of members of each of the five Provincial Councils and members of the Volksraad. The government follows the Westminster model, and is appointed by the Governor-General of South Africa, presently the Earl of Clarendon.\n\nSouth Africa has been administering Bechuanaland, Basutoland and Swaziland as protectorates in the place of Britain ever since the British revolution in the 1920s, while Southern Rhodesia has been admitted as a province of the union in 1922."

### Events ###
 saf.3.t: "Black Monday Hits South Africa"
 saf.3.d: "A week ago, the German stock market collapsed, plunging the world into depression. Since the advent of the great depression of 1925, the pact government in power at the time - a coalition of the National Party and the Labour Party, a smaller party of chiefly English-speaking white miners - elected to deepen the trade ties with the still prosperous Germany to limit the effects of the crisis, with limited success. The Smuts-Roos government that came into power in 1929 kept these arrangements in place, and as such, the woes of Black Monday did not skip South Africa.\n\nThe crisis has had a terrible effect upon the South African economy, unemployment has risen markedly as many companies that depended upon the German export market have gone out of business or laid off white workers in favour of cheaper native labour."
 saf.3.a: "This is a disaster!"

 saf.4.t: "The Industrialist Lobby"
 saf.4.d: "In the first decade of the dominion, South Africa's political system had been made up out of the Afrikaner-led South African Party and the smaller British-led Unionist Party, the party of the English-speaking mining magnates the likes of Cecil Rhodes and Leander Starr Jameson. When the National Party rose and republican sentiments along with it, in combination with a unionist decline, they eventually agreed to merge into the South African Party. This SAP wing has persisted during the last 15 years.\n\nStanding in their way of political and economic dominance however is the Industrial Conciliation Act, a piece of legislation that was passed by Hertzog's coalition government with the Labour Party in 1924 and which was later upheld by Smuts' SAP government. The Act was intended to promote peace throughout the Union, healing the scars of the Rand Revolt and serving as the foundation for a future South African welfare state. It legalised trade unions and granted them government recognition, on the condition that their activities would be moderated and a period of conciliation between employee and employer would be imposed in the event of labour struggles, with mediation from the Ministry of Labour, before strikes could legally be launched by a union. This bargaining process also excluded black workers from unions, with the hope of elevating the position of white labourers and sowing racial discord among the left. Though some informal arrangements exist where white workers have argued on behalf of their black colleagues, the Act ensures that blacks have hitherto never been recognised as actual "employees".\n\nThis turned out to be a double-edged sword, as while it suppressed the revolutionary left, it also granted white workers immense influence during the British Revolution and subsequent Great Depression, forcing corporations to raise wages and guarantee jobs for whites at a time when many in the Industrial Lobby were desperate to switch to cheaper, black labour, and keep wages low to avoid inflation. The Lobby has openly decried that the vast concessions granted by the Industrial Conciliation Act will make effective recovery from the current Black Monday crisis next to impossible, with many of its members begging us to repeal the Act in order to keep inflation down, maintain foreign investments and prevent an exodus of capital from Anglo-run industries."
 saf.4.a: "I assure you, the economy is our foremost concern!"

 saf.5.t: "Unionists Join the Opposition"
 saf.5.d: "The government's decision not to repeal the Industrial Conciliation Act in its strategy of resolving the effects of the Black Monday crisis has not gone down well with Unionists among our ranks. The minister of Commerce and Industry has resigned over our decision and eight MPs have left our parliamentary group, robbing us of our parliamentary majority.\n\nGiven our newfound lack of a working majority, tabling our package of measures against the crisis in the Volksraad would undoubtedly fail."
 saf.5.a: "We will need to open talks with the opposition!"

 saf.6.t: "Finding a Majority"
 saf.6.d: "With the Unionist withdrawal, the first outright SAP majority since 1921 has disappeared almost as quickly as it appeared in 1933. Prime Minister Smuts now needs to swiftly make a decision on how to proceed, because government action is necessary to alleviate the suffering caused by Black Monday.\n\nThe first option for the prime minister is to open coalition talks with the SAP's classical rivals, the National Party. There are profound differences between these two parties but if such talks would succeed the coalition would have an overwhelming majority in the Volksraad.\n\nSecondly, a deal could be reached with the National Council faction of the split Labour party led by Walter Madeley. They would likely be inclined to support the common-man oriented approach we had in mind and finding common ground with them would likely be much easier than with National.\n\nThen, we can decide to continue as a minority government as if nothing happened and seek out support on a per-motion basis. The unionists are likely deterred from bringing us down through a motion of no confidence as they have no party structure to defend their seats anymore. We could then likely negotiate with Labour on some bills and our lost Unionists on others, but this will leave the government without a stable majority at this crucial time.\n\nThen, finally, we can request that the governor-general dissolves the Volksraad and calls early elections, but of course this carries the risk of a victory by the National Party and would mean there would be no government able to counteract Black Monday for the coming weeks."
 saf.6.a: "Open talks with Hertzog"
 saf.6.b: "Schedule a meeting with Madeley Labour"
 saf.6.c: "We will continue as a minority government"
 saf.6.e: "Ask the governor-general to call new elections"

 saf.7.t: "Coalition Talks with National"
 saf.7.d: "Prime Minister Smuts has chosen to engage in coalition talks with general Hertzog and his National Party. Acutely aware of his own weakened position within his party due to his failure so far to regain the office of prime minister after losing it in 1929, general Hertzog, while exhibiting a willingness to engage, seems determined to reach a compromise which will be beneficial to his party.\n\nAfter two weeks of vigorous negotiation, the differences as well as the similarities of the two parties come to light. It appears that general Hertzog is willing to help out the SAP and even abstain from pursuing further nationalist goals until this Volksraad's term is up in 1938 'for the good of the country and Afrikanerdom' on two conditions: the first is that he, James Hertzog, will come to be prime minister of this coalition government. A somewhat arrogant stance to take as the leader of the smaller parliamentary party, but one that is when it comes to it most likely largely symbolic. His second demand is that we open up discussion about a controversial topic: to ease the suffering of Black Monday among the white Afrikaner farmers that form his support base he wants to set up the so-called 'Nuweveld Project' which would open up the Bechuanaland protectorate which South Africa garrisons on behalf of the British exile government for the settlement of white farmers. This would be in violation of the treaties signed by Britain with the Tswana chiefdoms and likely be regarded as a heavy breach of trust by Canada."
 saf.7.a: "Announce that we have come to an agreement!"
 saf.7.b: "This is unacceptable, let us talk with Madeley"
 saf.7.c: "If this is what it takes, we prefer a minority government"
 saf.7.e: "No deal! Parliament should be dissolved!"

 saf.8.t: "Talks with Labour"
 saf.8.d: "Prime Minister Smuts has chosen to engage in coalition talks with Walter Madeley and his National Council faction of the Labour Party. The small South African Labour Party with a support base of chiefly white English-speaking miners has been split ever since Madeley was removed from his cabinet position in the Pact Government by general Hertzog with the support of Labour leader Frederic Creswell for associating with the syndicalist and interracial Industrial and Commercial Workers' Union. Since then Madeley has been disputing the position of leader of the party with Creswell.\n\nAfter about a week of negotiation it appears they would join happily a coalition government with the SAP on the simple conditions that N.C. Labour receives two cabinet positions and affirmation that we will indeed be taking a common man-oriented approach to Black Monday. This agreement could've been highly troubling to the unionist wing of our party, but given they now left our ranks this should not pose a problem."
 saf.8.a: "An SAP-Labour cabinet will fulfil this term!"
 saf.8.b: "This is unacceptable, let us talk with Hertzog!"
 saf.8.c: "If this is what it takes, we prefer a minority government"
 saf.8.e: "No deal! Parliament should be dissolved!"

 saf.9.t: "The Governor-General Dissolves the Volksraad"
 saf.9.d: "The Unionist walk-out as a result of disagreements over the strategy with regards to Black Monday has resulted in a cabinet crisis. Robbed of a working majority in the Volksraad, prime minister Smuts has asked the Earl of Clarendon to dissolve the Volksraad and call new elections six weeks from now. Since the response to Black Monday was obviously not on the table in 1933 and makes for an entirely new situation, the governor-general swiftly followed the advice of the prime minister and dissolved the Volksraad.\n\nA rough campaigning season is expected in the coming six weeks as the effects of Black Monday will befall more and more South Africans. Jan Smuts will likely be campaigning on his credentials in alleviating the effects of the Great Depression, while James Hertzog will likely once again start a scaremonger among South African whites about the prospects of increasing native influence on politics and paint Smuts as a puppet of the mining magnates of the Rand who has allowed this to happen."
 saf.9.a: "The government needs a clear mandate to deliver relief!"

 saf.10.t: "The [GetYear] Elections"
 saf.10.d: "It has been six weeks since elections have been called and the (white) South Africans are going to the polls to cast their vote. In the Cape Province and Southern Rhodesia they are joined by non-whites who meet certain property and education qualifications. The outcome of this election will likely decide who will rule South Africa for the next five years: will general Smuts reclaim the majority he won in 1933, or will general Hertzog finally reclaim the office of Prime Minister for himself after seven long years in the opposition?"
 saf.10.a: "The SAP reclaims its working majority once again!"
 saf.10.b: "National claims a decisive majority!"

 saf.11.t: "The Extent of Native Autonomy"
 saf.11.d: "We have decided to formalise the autonomy of the local rulers of the former High Commissioner Territories, the Paramount Chiefs of the respective ethnic groups (the Tswana in Bechuanaland, the Basotho in Basutoland and the Swazi in Swaziland). But we need to clarify the extent of the Chiefs' power - is it limited to within the borders of the former HCT, or does it encompass all of their people throughout South Africa?"
 saf.11.a: "Their authority stops at the border."
 saf.11.b: "They will fully represent their people."

 saf.12.t: "The Third Smuts Cabinet Continues"
 saf.12.d: "The gamble of calling an election has been a resounding success: the South African electorate has clearly and decisively spoken out its approval of the government's plans to carry South Africa out of the suffering brought upon us by Black Monday. The SAP has secured itself a working majority in the Volksraad and the unionists, who have been reduced to two seats as independents are no longer needed to this end, allowing the cabinet to continue another five year term, with no need to compromise with the opposition."
 saf.12.a: "Hurrah!"

 saf.13.t: "The Second Hertzog Cabinet Inaugurated"
 saf.13.d: "Smuts' gamble of calling elections in the middle of the rising Black Monday crisis has clearly backfired spectacularly. For the first time since 1929, the National Party is once again the larger of the two Afrikaner parties, and Hertzog is set to once again occupy the office of prime minister with a full mandate to deliver the National party programme. National has achieved a working majority on its own, but the Creswell faction of the Labour party, who had been our allies during the 1924-1929 term, have expressed interest in joining the cabinet once again. They are not strictly necessary to govern, but it might be beneficial to secure their support if we were to lose our working majority in the future like Smuts has found out just now."
 saf.13.a: "South Africa needs a stable single-party cabinet!"
 saf.13.b: "Reconstitute the Pact Government"

 saf.14.t: "The Opposition Rallies against the Repeal!"
 saf.14.d: "We have just tabled our proposed repeal of the Industrial Conciliation Act of 1924. The Nationalist opposition has decried us as 'proving to be sock-puppets of Hoggenheimer once more', referring to the personification of the English-speaking capitalists in cartoons in the Afrikaner newspaper 'Die Burger' and the smaller Labour contingent, normally divided between their National Council and Creswell faction, has joined them unanimously in condemning our suggestion. But this matters little, since the SAP holds the majority in the Volksraad.\n\nMore ominous is the situation in the streets: the International Socialist League has condemned our motion and called for a general strike. Not everyone is inclined to follow their rabble-rousing, but several large mines in the Witwatersrand are completely on lock-down now. For the owners, this may be a setback that cannot be overcome in combination with the crisis if we do not act soon."
 saf.14.a: "Let them send in their strikebreakers!"
 saf.14.b: "Stand back, let us wait them out!"

 saf.15.t: "Riots in Benoni"
 saf.15.d: "The decision to send in strikebreakers seems to have inflamed the situation. The strikers assaulted the trucks loaded with their replacements, leading to police intervention, which in turn developed into a riot. In the Rand mining town of Benoni, which was also a hotspot in the 1922 revolt, armed rioters have forced the police to retreat from the town entirely, while elsewhere, in the town of Brakpan and several suburbs of Johannesburg, rioters are taking control block by block!\n\nTo make matters worse, news of the brutalities have reached outside the Rand, and strikes in solidarity with them are being called among dockworkers in Durban and Cape Town. The scope of the crisis is quickly growing to the meet the one of 1922."
 saf.15.a: "This is getting out of hand!"

 saf.16.t: "The Second Rand Revolt"
 saf.16.d: "The crisis is quickly growing and even starts to exceed the problems in 1922: unlike back then, revolting workers are also securing ever-increasing control over Durban and Cape Town, and in Johannesburg the majority of the city has fallen under worker control. In Pretoria, panic among functionaries is rising, and parallels are being drawn between the mining strike in Wales in 1925 and the one that caused this crisis. Prime Minister Smuts remains calm under the circumstances however, arguing that, unlike in Britain, these white strikers have very little ability to project power into the South African hinterland. The cabinet debates two options: sending in the military immediately, which should quickly pacify the crisis like in 1922 but would likely come at a large cost of lives on both sides, or to use the military purely in a defensive manner, which would undoubtedly end the strikers' advance, allowing us to isolate them. They can hardly maintain this position for long and will then hopefully surrender."
 saf.16.a: "An immediate military response is necessary!"
 saf.16.b: "Stop and isolate them, they will soon surrender!"

 saf.17.t: "The Battle of Mayfair"
 saf.17.d: "Early in the morning, some 20.000 troops of the UDF poured into Johannesburg on the orders of Jan Smuts. With the full use of bombing runs by the air force the strikers were quickly driven back, until they dug in in the Johannesburg suburb of Mayfair. A bloody fight was the result, and at the end of it more than 350 strikers lay dead, and at least 60 UDF troops. Following the battle significant amounts of strikers dispersed, and later within days order was restored in most of the Rand. Following the news of the brutal massacre in Mayfair, the strikers in Durban and Cape Town also dispersed without further violence.\n\nThe crisis is under control, but these events will likely go down as a dark page of South African history."
 saf.17.a: "At least it is over."

 saf.18.t: "The ICU Acts!"
 saf.18.d: "The military reinforcement of the police indeed succeeded at stopping the socialist advance, but unlike what the government had hoped, the strikers dug in and refused to surrender, despite the seemingly hopeless situation. For about ten days, this gridlock remained, when suddenly, a devious socialist plan was revealed... Too late...\n\nThe Industrial and Commercial Workers' Union, an interracial native-led trade union with a very strong influence on the rural parts of South Africa, officially declared their support for the strikers and native rioters rose everywhere, confiscating guns from the white farmers they worked for leveraging their large number and overrunning arms depots of the UDF. These impromptu rebels then hit the cordon sanitaire set up by the Union Defence Force around Johannesburg, the Rand and the rebel parts of Cape Town and Durban, leaving them trapped between the strikers and the rebels. In a disorganised frenzy, a large part of the government force was forced to surrender, or defected to the rebel forces as the odds of a socialist takeover being completed materialised further by the hour."
 saf.18.a: "This is bad!"

 saf.19.t: "The March on Pretoria"
 saf.19.d: "With the besieged cities relieved from the capitalist attempts at suppression, a joint socialist force marched on Pretoria, while socialist militias skirmished with UDF remnants elsewhere in South Africa. The city of Pretoria was occupied without any further violence, and it seemed the corrupt government functionaries of the old capitalist regime, both Nationalists and those following Smuts, had dispersed, fleeing north-west towards Südwestafrika, likely going to Walvis Bay, through Bechuanaland which the ICU and ISL did not yet control.\n\nIn Pretoria, a provisional socialist government was proclaimed. A bright new, socialist, era for South Africa would dawn while the capitalist pigs run for their lives."
 saf.19.a: "Workers of South Africa, unite!"

 saf.20.t: "The Strike Expands"
 saf.20.d: "Unsurprisingly, word about our less-than-worker-friendly response to Black Monday has quickly spread to socialist circles. Now less radical unions, aligned with the Labour Party and, in one case, National, have joined the syndicalists in their general strike, putting the country on lock-down. In Pretoria, some within the cabinet are suggesting pulling the bill to placate the strikers, and to instead counter Black Monday with a more Keynesian approach."
 saf.20.a: "We will not be bullied into neglecting what is needed!"
 saf.20.b: "Perhaps a different approach would be preferable."

 saf.21.t: "Mine Declares Bankruptcy"
 saf.21.d: "The lowered ability to sell its metals on the market, in combination with the complete stop on production as a result of the strike, has become too much for one of our largest metal mines in the Witwatersrand. Unable to pay off its creditors, the owners have been forced to declare bankruptcy and the company is already being liquidated as we speak to try and pay back as much as is being owed. Hundreds of jobs are lost in one go, increasing the pressure on the government to give in to the striker's demands."
 saf.21.a: "Their reserves must run out any minute now!"
 saf.21.b: "We must give in now to limit the damage!"

 saf.22.t: "Strikers Back Down!"
 saf.22.d: "After two months of strikes, it has been the strikers who blinked first. While they are certainly still dissatisfied with our choice to repeal the Industrial Conciliation Act, the simple reality is that the reserves of the trade unions have run out and thus the strikers can't sustain themselves with striking anymore. We have won... For now..."
 saf.22.a: "If you don't blink, strikers are powerless!"

 saf.23.t: "South Africa Seeks Investment"
 saf.23.d: "Of all Britain's dominions, the Union of South Africa has maintained the closest relations with Germany and following the dawn of the great depression in 1925, the Afrikaner Nationalist government of South Africa has closed several extensive trade deals with Germany in an attempt to stifle the recession. It is no surprise then, that now, while the Entente as a whole is slowly recovering from the Great Depression, South Africa now suffers from the effects of the recession that comes forth from the British Empire.\n\nThe current loyalist Smuts government has petitioned us for investments to help rekindle their economy. While antagonising South Africa too much is unwise as it risks us losing control over the strategically valuable Cape of Good Hope which is our link between east and west, some within our government are of the opinion that this whole situation can be completely and unreservedly be blamed on South Africa's own policies, and that we should not waste resources needed for the homecoming on helping South Africa develop."
 saf.23.a: "I suppose we have some spare change."
 saf.23.b: "South Africa has themselves to blame."

 saf.24.t: "Canada Invests"
 saf.24.d: "The Canadian and Exile governments have reacted positively towards our request for additional imperial investments to relieve the effects of Black Monday on South Africa."
 saf.24.a: "Thank you kindly!"

 saf.25.t: "Canada Rejects Investment"
 saf.25.d: "The Canadian and Exile governments have rejected our request for additional imperial investments to relieve the effects of Black Monday. According to them, we only have ourselves to blame for the economic hardship, by having taken the poisoned chalice of trading with the Germans, the fact that these treaties were signed by the pact government rather than our own notwithstanding, and that they need their full resources for the homecoming."
 saf.25.a: "How does Canada expect me to keep South Africa in the Entente if they treat us like this?!"

 saf.26.t: "The Chief Justice of the HCT"
 saf.26.d: "Up to this point, the law has been maintained in a decentralised fashion, divided between the High Commissioner, the Advisory Councils and the tribal governments. This has resulted in local differences and made it hard to crack down on the slavery issue, especially when tribal authorities were unwilling to cooperate.\n\nIn this light, a motion has been drafted in the Volksraad to establish the office of Chief Justice of the High Commissioner Territories. This South African-appointed chief justice will centralise the rule of law and aid the high commissioner in his duties."
 saf.26.a: "A wonderful idea!"

 saf.27.t: "South Africa Seeks to Reform the High Commissioner System"
 saf.27.d: "The South African government has revealed their hope to reform the High Commissioner System. In the light of the fact they have been garrisoning the territories since the British revolution they argue it would be more efficient if the High Commissioner for Southern Africa would be appointed by the South African Parliament henceforth, and that the High Commissioner Territories of Basutoland, Swaziland and Bechuanaland would be regarded as part of South Africa instead of as British colonies under temporary South African mandate from now on."
 saf.27.a: "This would indeed be more efficient."
 saf.27.b: "We excluded them from the South Africa Act for a reason!"

 saf.28.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Accepts Our Proposal for HCT Reform"
 saf.28.d: "The [From.GetAdjective] government has accepted our suggestion to officially make the High Commissioner Territories part of the South Africa and to have the High Commissioner be henceforth appointed by parliament in Cape Town."
 saf.28.a: "Excellent!"

 saf.29.t: "Implementing Apartheid"
 saf.29.d.split: "The time has come to formalise our system of racial segregation in South Africa, to finally split off the natives and 'coloured' into their own political and social system separate from our own. This will restore an amount of unity to our nation, as artificially enforced as that may be. There is an expectation of future unrest even so, and thus there are elements of the party which suggest a more moderate version of apartheid than that planned... though others suggest that, if we go ahead with the original plan, Daniel François Malan and his Purified National Party may elect to forgive our earlier efforts at moderation and rejoin the government."

This will restore an amount of unity to our nation, as artificially enforced as that may be.

 saf.29.a: "We will implement apartheid fully, as planned."
 saf.29.b: "Perhaps a more moderate version is better."

 saf.30.t: "Gesuiwerde Rejoins the National Party"
 saf.30.d: "Mollified by our full implementation of apartheid, Daniel François Malan and his fellow hard-liners have agreed to rejoin the government. Not everyone is thrilled by their return, though this does effectively make South Africa a one-party state, since the Afrikaner population is unlikely to support any other party in great numbers. Future elections will mostly be simply for show."
 saf.30.a: "Good news, I think."

 saf.31.t: "The National Party Splits"
 saf.31.d: "Unwilling to compromise their values, the more extreme wing of the National Party led by Daniel François Malan has broken away to form the 'Gesuiwerde' or Purified National Party. They reject the current government's moderate approach towards the implementation of apartheid, and they have already gained considerable support among the Afrikaner population. It's entirely possible they could pose a threat in future elections."
 saf.31.a: "We'll need to watch them closely."

 saf.32.t: "South Africa Wishes to Join the Reichspakt"
 saf.32.d: "The government of South Africa announced recently that they wish to join our alliance. It's not a sudden move because pro-German policy is popular in many circles, including the government and the army. Do we want the South Africans to join us against our shared enemies?"
 saf.32.a: "Of course!"
 saf.32.b: "But I've never met a nice South African!"

 saf.33.t: "We Join the Reichspakt!"
 saf.33.d: "The Kaiserreich is happy to see us joining the common cause - destroying the evil syndicalists. Now we are part of the German bloc."
 saf.33.a: "This time we will win!"

They make clear that our guardianship over the territories is a purely temporary affair and that sovereignty is to be restored to the United Kingdom once the homecoming has been completed."
 saf.35.a: "Very well..."

 saf.36.t: "The Commander-General Takes Over"
 saf.36.d: "It was a silent morning in Pretoria, before stamping boots put an end to the serenity: not only in Pretoria, but all over South Africa, Ossewabrandwag paramilitary forces are patrolling the streets. Then a radio message is broadcasted: Johannes van Rensburg, the former administrator of the Orange Free State, has an announcement to make: during the night, State President Malan and his entire cabinet have inexplicably vanished, and to ensure continuity of government, the Ossewabrandwag's leader has nobly assumed his post and swears revenge against what according to him has 'clearly' been a native plot to overthrow white rule over South Africa. To this end, temporarily, civil liberties and electoral processes must be suspended and the office of 'Commander-General of South Africa' will be established, at least until the culprits behind the disappearance have been found.\n\nAs the sun glares over Pretoria, today is shaping up to become a beautiful and warm day, yet something is becoming clear:"
 saf.36.a: "Democracy died in the dark of the night..."

 saf.37.t: "The Native Representation Act"
 saf.37.d.fusion: "The Qualified Franchise in the Cape Province and Southern Rhodesia which theoretically allows all provincial subjects vote on equal grounds provided they meet the property requirement has long been a thorn in the eye for Hertzog and his nationalists, and thus, now in power, it is hardly surprising that they have brought forward a motion to limit it. According to this act, the small black elite that can vote under Cape Qualified Franchise will be removed from the common voter roll and moved to a separate voter roll, voting for a Native Representation Council made up of white representatives. In addition, this act will halt the right of black people to run for office.\n\nJan Smuts and his United Party wing are sceptical about this proposed intervention in the Cape and Southern Rhodesia qualified franchise, but Smuts has accepted that this act will be made law on the condition that we will swiftly raise the amount of land designated to the natives from the current 8% to 13%, which he views as a fair trade, and more worthwhile to the natives than the right of a small elite voting in the general elections. His liberal lieutenant Hofmeyr, who has resigned his minister post in protest, as well as Natal conservatives such as colonel Stallard disagree with this, the former because it is an apparently unrightful restriction, and the latter because the prospect of increased native lands is too liberal for their taste."

 saf.38.t: "The Termination of Van Rensburg's Party Membership"
 saf.38.d: "In the last few years, an extremist wing of radical Nationalists has grown within the National Party. This wing rejects basic principles like parliamentarianism and is not afraid to use violence to achieve their goals, scaring away moderate Afrikaners from our party in the process. Therefore the party leadership has decided it is time to terminate the party membership of Johannes van Rensburg, the extremely authoritarian former administrator of the Orange Free State province and upstart leader of paramilitary operations, with a fascination for the quite new phenomenon of ultranationalist dictatorships in Europe.\n\nLeadership hopes that by distancing the party from this figure, the growth of the anti-parliamentarian wing of our party can be controlled."
 saf.38.a: "True Nationalists have Principles"

 saf.39.t: "The Native Trust and Land Act"
 saf.39.d: "The Volksraad has passed the Native Trust and Land Act. This act will increase the land allocated to the Native reserves from 7.13% as established in the Natives Land Act of 1913 to 13.6% of South Africa's total land mass.\n\nAt the same time, rights of African tenant farmers have been restricted, with black people now only being allowed to live on white-owned farms on which they work as employees."
 saf.39.a: "Royal Assent granted!"

 saf.40.t: "The Asiatic Land Tenure Act"
 saf.40.d: "We have passed the Asiatic Land Tenure Act. This act has been passed on the insistence of Natal Conservatives within the [getUnitedorSAPshory], who have long been worried about the growing encroachment of Indian migrant workers in Natal onto white neighbourhoods, and their merchants' seeming ability to outcompete white shop owners in both their own and native customer bases. The Asiatic Land Tenure act makes it impossible for 'Asiatics' - that is to say Natal and Transvaal Indians as well as Cape Malays - to own land outside specially designated areas.\n\nAs a gesture to liberals within the party, the act also grants Indians in Natal and Transvaal the right to elect whites to parliament on a separate roll and Natal Indians to represent themselves in the Natal Provincial Council. Likely a small consolation for the Indian South African population, who have been hit at the heart of their commercial activity with this act."
 saf.40.a: "A worthy compromise!"

 saf.41.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Institutes Racist Measures against Indians"
 saf.41.d: "The [From.GetAdjective] parliament has two weeks ago passed a law that severely discriminates against [From.GetNameDef]'s Indian migrant population, disturbing their livelihoods and commercial chances. The news has swiftly reached India and the public is outraged at the news that a country would do such a thing, and thus the government is being pressured to unequivocally denounce the actions of the [From.GetAdjective] government and to support [From.GetNameDef]'s Indian diaspora in their struggle against this unfair legislation."

In the light of demonstrations including the burning of [From.GetAdjective] flags in [RAJ.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] their government has officially and publicly denounced our 'racist practices' and 'shameless discriminatory policies'.\n\nUnfortunately, the local Indian resistance feels emboldened by this official support from the [From.GetAdjective] government and have announced additional demonstrations against the legislation."
 saf.42.a: "[RAJ.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] should mind its own business!"

 saf.43.t: "Defiance Campaigns, Petitions and Marches"
 saf.43.d: "The South African Indian Congress has reacted negatively to the institution of the Asiatic Land Tenure Act. In the spirit of their legendary founder Mahatma Gandhi they have set up an effective non-violent resistance against the bill: marches of over 5000 Indian protestors are reported in Durban, defiance campaigns are being executed, with Indians refusing to vacate their property outside of the designated area, forcing the police to forcibly evict and move them to Indian neighbourhoods, and finally petitions against the act, petitions presented to all layers of government with thousands of signatures."
 saf.43.a: "Such a waste of paper."

 saf.44.t: "The Asiatic Enfranchisement Act"
 saf.44.d: "The Asiatic Enfranchisement Act has been passed by the Volksraad after only opposition from a handful of conservatives and the vocal opposition of the small Afrikaner Nationalist opposition: this act will grant the right to vote on the common roll to all Indian migrant workers as well as the Cape Malays, allowing them to join their fellow white and 'coloured' South Africans at the polls.\n\nIt is expected that this reform will put an end to Natal conservatism as we know it, with the white conservative vote henceforth being 'diluted' by more progressive-inclined Indian voters and similarly, the Afrikaner Nationalist cause in Transvaal is also expected also be hurt further by their inclusion.\n\nGiven that 'coloured' people already hold the vote, the Cape Malay vote is not expected to significantly change the political structure of the Cape any further."

The document is to be referred to as the 'Natal Covenant' and states that they are loyal supporters of the British Empire, and that as such, if a republic is indeed declared, they pledge to resist its authority.\n\nThousands of Natalians have signed the document, including a supermajority of the Natal Provincial Council, and equally ominously, Godfrey Huggins, the administrator of Southern Rhodesia, openly declared his support to the document.

The State President appoints the cabinet - now to be called the president's council - and can be removed by parliament for misconduct or incapacity following investigation by a joint committee. If the office were to become vacant (for instance because of removal), the president of the senate would become acting state president. This year's parliament would remain the parliament of the new republic.

The white settler population was not consulted in this decision, despite having clearly rejected the prospect of union in the elections for the advisory council in 1919. Since the integration, the Southern Rhodesians had been continuously electing secessionist majorities in their provincial council, but unwilling to leave the British Empire as a whole, they were deterred from actually following through in their rhetoric of leaving the union.\n\nNow that South Africa has abandoned the empire, the provincial authorities in Salisbury have swiftly affirmed their allegiance to the king-emperor and declared their independence from the illegitimate republic."

Secondly, there are the dominionists, who voted in favour of the secession and claim they would henceforth only ever accept reintegration under circumstances of an authoritarian government ensuring British South African supremacy of the Afrikaners. What's left is the SAP councillors who voted against secession.\n\nThe Dominionist Party and the UFP swiftly formed the independence coalition and declared the secession of Natal from the Union with the majority, following in the footsteps of Southern Rhodesia.

And given the provinces will be rejoining the British Empire, it must be considered that they could form a security threat to South Africa if some day the homecoming is completed and Britain decides it wants to recover its empire.\n\nWith these concerns in mind, restoring order in the provinces of Natal and Southern Rhodesia seems inevitable."

Once these changes have been put into effect, we can start 'buying' up Bechuanaland land. Some pressure might need to be applied on this matter.

Interestingly, despite the arid conditions of much of Bechuanaland, it appears the crop and cattle yields are actually rather high on average compared to South Africa proper, as on account of Bechuanaland's lower population and subsequently less intensive agriculture, the land degradation present in South Africa proper is not nearly as intensive in Bechuanaland.\n\nWhile the Nuweveld, if truly successful, will doubtlessly intensify the agricultural activities with time to such a degree that it will fall back on par with South Africa proper, the current increased yields are attracting more hopeful settlers."

Even if we brush aside the fact that this is likely a blatant attempt to permanently bind Bechuanaland to their union, which would result in us finding the full integration of Bechuanaland as a fait accompli once the homecoming has been completed, this constitutes a gross violation of the treaties we signed with the Tswana people native to Bechuanaland."
 saf.66.a: "Revoke the South African mandate!"
 saf.66.b: "We cannot afford to provoke the South Africans at this time."

 saf.67.t: "The Exile Government revokes our mandate over the HCT"
 saf.67.d: "The British government in exile has, upon being made aware of the Nuweveld project and the violations of the treaties between the British government and the tribes it entails by the high commissioner, decided to revoke our mandate to garrison the High Commissioner Territories of Bechuanaland, Basutoland and Swaziland in their name. According to them the admission of white settlers and the forcible transfer of tribal lands is a breach of the agreement that was the basis of the transfer of the territories to our control in the first place."
 saf.67.a: "We must transfer the HCT back to [From.GetNameDef]..."

 saf.68.t: "South Africa Ignores our Revocation"
 saf.68.d: "Not completely unsurprisingly, the South African government has not reacted to our revocation of their mandate and simply continued their endeavours. Since South Africa is technically an ally and their strategic situation is key to our interests with the loss of the Suez canal, there is little more we can do, but at least we have made clear that we disapprove of these practices."
 saf.68.a: "That Dutch scum!"

 saf.69.t: "Mending the Afrikaner Schism?"
 saf.69.d: "When the Union of South Africa was formed in 1910 two strains of Afrikaner politics emerged: on the one side there were Transvaal Afrikaners who favoured reconciliation and cooperation with Britain in the acquired dominion form, led by generals Louis Botha and Jan Smuts who were formerly in service of the South African Republic during the second Boer war, and on the other side one there was the Free State Afrikaners led by (Free State) president Marthinus Steyn and general James Hertzog, who had been in service of the Orange Free State during the second Boer War, favouring a more confrontational policy with the empire. Both started out in one single Afrikaner South African Party, but the ideological differences between the two sides soon came to light and caused a split in the South African Party, with the former remaining in the original party and the latter forming their own 'National Party' in opposition to the former. Since then, Afrikanerdom seemed irreversibly split along ideological lines.\n\nThis remained so until the formation of the National-SAP coalition last year. This cooperation has been quite fruitful and both sides have to accept the prospect that their two-party dominance is increasingly challenged by other parties and independents dissatisfied with the status-quo, especially after the economic woes during the last two decades. Deputy prime minister Smuts has now engineered a plan to, for the first time since the very first general election of 1910 unite the South African and Nationalist Parties into a single list for the elections of 1938, the so-called United Party."
 saf.69.a: "A wonderful idea!"
 saf.69.b: "Our differences are too great."

 saf.70.t: "The Fusion Remnants"
 saf.70.d: "The news of the reunion between the South African Party and the United Party has shaken South African politics to its core. With the two largest parties merging into one, United dominance of South African politics seems unavoidable, at least for the next term. However, some question how long this fusion will actually hold, given the fact that the ideological differences in terms of race relations and South Africa's connection to the Empire between the former South African Party and the former National Party have been pushed to the background rather than disappeared.\n\nA certain segment of the National electorate wants nothing to do with it in any case: Nationalists in the Cape province, headed by the former editor of the 'Die Burger' newspaper, Dr. Daniel François Malan, have rejected fusion and announced their own continuation of the National Party, the so-called 'Gesuiwerde Nasionale Party' or 'Purified National Party'.\n\nOn the other side of the spectrum, English-speaking reactionaries within the South African Party lead by colonel C.F. Stallard also rejected fusion, citing their distrust of prime minister J.B.M. Hertzog and the Afrikaner Nationalist faction he carries into the newfound United Party."
 saf.70.a: "Why can't we all just come together?"

 saf.71.t: "[GetYear] General Elections"
 saf.71.d: "The Volksraad's term is up and South Africans go to the polls once more. That is to say, white South Africans go to the polls, although in the Cape Province and Southern Rhodesia, they are joined by members of the non-white elite, provided they adhere to certain property qualifications.\n\nAs usual, the race is between the National Party and the South African Party, but the removal of general J.B.M. Hertzog from the leadership of the National Party is a severe upset. Under the newfound leadership of the more radical dr. Daniel François Malan, National has pledged that if they are served with a majority, they will abolish the monarchy and declare a republic at the shortest possible notice, hoping that this unambiguous stance will help them defeat the South African Party. South Africa holds its breath."
 saf.71.a: "Jan Smuts and the SAP are victorious once more."
 saf.71.b: "D.F. Malan and National walk away with the victory."
 saf.71.c: "J.B.M. Hertzog and National walk away with the victory."

 saf.72.t: "The End of the Labour Split"
 saf.72.d.fusion: "In 1928, the Labour Party split among ideological lines when prime minister Hertzog fired Walter Madeley, Labour minister of Post and Telegraph Services, for receiving a delegation of the interracial and syndicalist ICU. Colonel Frederic Creswell refused to support his fellow party member and in protest Madeley and his supporters left the cabinet and went into the opposition. Ever since, Madeley has been disputing Labour leadership with Creswell.\n\nAs a by-result of the much larger merger between the SAP and the National Party, this split has been healed as well: after prolonged alignment with the National Party in the Volksraad, Labour MPs from the Creswell wing have elected to join the newfound United Party as well, thus relinquishing their claim to being the Labour Party.\n\nIn this capacity, the National Council wing of the Labour Party remains now as the sole faction in the Labour Party, and thus the leadership of the party remains no longer in doubt. It is now securely in the hands of Walter Madeley."

Ever since, Madeley has been disputing Labour leadership with Creswell.\n\nHowever, colonel Creswell decided to quit politics this year, declining a chance to stand as candidate for his constituency. As such, MPs of his faction have rejoined the ranks of Madeley's Labour.\n\nIn this capacity, the National Council wing of the Labour Party remains now as the sole faction in the Labour Party, and thus the leadership of the party remains no longer in doubt.

That is to say, white South Africans go to the polls, although in the Cape Province and Southern Rhodesia, they are joined by members of the non-white elite, provided they adhere to certain property qualifications.\n\nThese elections are very much unusual: generals Smuts and Hertzog, who had already been ruling in coalition with one another for a while, have decided to merge their party into a single parliamentary group, meaning National and SAP MP candidates will not contest one another. As such, despite limited resistance from a newly reunited Labour and the Purified National Party, the outcome of this election seems to be set in stone already."
 saf.73.a: "The United Party wins comfortably."

 saf.74.t: "Purified National's Showing"
 saf.74.d: "While the United Party secured a decisive and widely expected victory, there is one sour aftertaste to the whole affair: in the final tally, the United Party has lost some 25 seats compared to the joint size of the SAP and National in 1933, and almost all of those have gone to Dr. D.F. Malan's Purified National Party.\n\nWhile the United Party has secured their rule for the coming term of the next five years, at least assuming the fusion holds, it is clear that Malan's Purifieds are starting to build momentum. Because of this, next election might not be so easily fought."
 saf.74.a: "Very ominous."

 saf.76.t: "Preparations for the Great Trek Centenary"
 saf.76.d: "Next year the Great Trek will have commenced exactly a century ago: in 1838, Dutch-speaking settlers from the Cape Colony started 'trekking' - migrating - eastwards to escape the influence of the British colonial administration which at the time stretched roughly from Cape Town to Port Elizabeth, which eventually directly led first to the creation of the Boer Republic of Natalia in what is now the province of Natal and after its demise to that of the Orange Free State and the South African Republic (Transvaal).\n\nTo celebrate this occasion, the Great Trek Centenary Committee has been formed. They are planning to organise a re-enactment of the Great Trek with authentic ox-wagons who will move from town to town, starting in Cape Town in August next year, to eventually arrive in Pretoria at a designated location at Dingaan's Day, where the foundation of a grand Voortrekker monument is to be laid. Of course, the committee is expecting significant state support for this remembrance project of Afrikaner history."
 saf.76.a: "We shall make a sizeable contribution."
 saf.76.b: "Interesting, but we cannot spare the money."
 saf.76.c: "We cannot allow a National Trauma to be celebrated!"

 saf.77.t: "Afrikaner Organisations Gather Centenary Funds"
 saf.77.d: "Following the government's refusal to fund the planned Great Trek Centenary festivities, Afrikaner cultural organisations have chosen to collect funds for it on their own accord. While this fundraising was quite successful, the amount hardly compares to the state funding that was expected by the committee, but at least the festivities need not be cancelled.\n\nIt is clear however that many Afrikaners resent the fact that the government refused to properly fund this ode to their history."
 saf.77.a: "Perfectly handled, I suppose."

 saf.78.t: "The Ossewabrandwag"
 saf.78.d: "The Ossewabrandwag is a militant Afrikaner cultural organisation established in commemoration of the centennial anniversary of the Great Trek by former Johannes van Rensburg, the former administrator of the Orange Free State. The meaning of the name is 'Ox-Wagon Sentinel', referring to the ox-wagons of the Trek, and the movement has based itself on authoritarian nationalist movements in Europe like the League for National Recovery in the Netherlands and the DVLP in Germany.\n\nEspecially concerning is their paramilitary wing, the 'Stormjaers' (Stormtroopers) who are not afraid of confrontation or violence, especially against non-whites and Jews."
 saf.78.a: "Concerning!"

 saf.79.t: "The Start of the Great Trek"
 saf.79.d: "The centenary celebration of the Great Trek, when the ancestors of South Africa's Boers moved into the interior of South Africa to escape British influence, has been kicked off at the foot of the statue of Jan van Riebeeck - the Dutch explorer viewed by many Afrikaners as the founding father of their nation - in Cape Town. The first ox-wagons have already departed under the watchful eye of a large crowd, estimated to be made up of over one hundred thousand people - astounding given that Cape Town is considered to be a British city. The chairman of the Great Trek Centenary Committee, National politician H.J. Klopper, owns the first two wagons of the parade, and invited all of Afrikanerdom to partake in the festivities. The ox-wagon parade will follow the so-called 'Pad van Suid-Afrika' to Pretoria, while a smaller contingent will split off at Vegkop and instead journey to the location where the battle of Blood River took place in Natal. Over the next few months, the ox-wagons of the re-enactment will be passing through numerous small towns and larger cities where Afrikaners in classic Voortrekker clothing, while the 'dominee', the town priest, will be welcoming them with extensive festivities."
 saf.79.a: "There they go, good luck!"

 saf.80.t: "The Centenary Celebration Reaches Port Elizabeth"
 saf.80.d: "The ox-wagons of the Centenary celebration have arrived in Port Elizabeth, after having passed to medium-size towns like Stellenbosch, Paarl, Worcester and Swellendam and a myriad of small towns and villages. In all these settlements, the festivities have been a resounding success, bringing out a wave of intense Afrikaner patriotism. However, the city of Port Elizabeth is primarily inhabited by English-speakers who are quite hostile to this celebration of Afrikaner culture, and for this reason, as well as the unfriendly attitude towards Afrikaners espoused by its mayor, Klopper has decided against seeking the confrontation by holding a parade through the city, with the parade instead directly moving on towards the small town of Willowmore and after that to towards Graaff-Reinet and the site of the Slagter's Nek rebellion in 1816 which is regarded as one of the reasons behind the original Great Trek."
 saf.80.a: "An unfortunate dent in race relations."

 saf.81.t: "The Centenary Celebration Reaches Bulhoek"
 saf.81.d: "Now the re-enactment of the Centenary celebration has arrived in Bulhoek, near the border of the Orange Free State, after having visited Graaff-Reinet and having paid respect to the executed Afrikaner rebels at the site of Slagter's Nek as well as more smaller villages and towns. At Slagter's Nek the festivities were especially massive and in every town where the parade arrives the song 'Die Stem van Suid-Afrika' is sung by the crowd. Despite its limited size as a farm near Steynsburg, Bulhoek is significant because it is the birthplace of Paul Kruger, the famous president of the South African Republic (Transvaal) who eventually died in exile during the Second Boer War. Here too large amounts of people welcomed the parade, if not as many as in Slagter's Nek. Tomorrow the parade will pass into Steynsburg proper and within a few days the ox-wagons are expected to cross into the Orange Free State, leaving the Cape Province behind."
 saf.81.a: "Escaping British influence, metaphorically speaking!"

 saf.82.t: "The Centenary Celebration Reaches Bloemfontein"
 saf.82.d: "After successfully crossing the Orange River - leaving behind the Cape Province and entering the Orange Free State - the ox-wagon parade has arrived in the city of Bloemfontein, which, as the seat of the judiciary, is the second capital of South Africa they visit after starting in the legislative capital of Cape Town. Once the parade will arrive in Pretoria, our seat of government, the re-enactment will have visited them all.\n\nIn previous cities the parade visited, many street names were renamed in honour of Afrikaner heroes, but English-speaking town council of Bloemfontein has refused to follow suit. In response, Klopper has refused to use the new oxen provided by the city and made a statement by pulling the wagons through the city by hand. At the same time, torches were revealed by young participants of the Trek, which had apparently been kept alight since the parade left Cape Town.\n\nThe rest of the month will be dedicated to the trek to the site of the Battle of Vegkop, near the town of Heilbron."
 saf.82.a: "Ry maar an Ossewa, ry maar an."

 saf.83.t: "The Centenary Celebration Reaches Vegkop"
 saf.83.d: "The ox-wagons of the Centenary Celebration have now reached Vegkop, the site where a small group of Voortrekkers repelled a much larger Matabele force against overwhelming odds. At present, many of the participants, both of those driving or following ox-wagons, and those partaking in the local festivities, have allowed their beards to grow so as to look more like their ancestors 100 years ago.\n\nFrom here, a small contingent of the ox-wagon parade will be splitting off. They will travel south from here into the province of Natal, to be present at the site of the battle of Blood River, which will be exactly a century ago coming Dingane's Day, visiting cities like Ladysmith, Pietermaritzburg and Durban on the way. The remainder of the parade will continue to follow 'die Pad' into the province of Transvaal, to be present at the laying of the foundation of the Voortrekker Monument in Pretoria at Dingane's Day."
 saf.83.a: "Ons gaan hier, julle gaan daar!"

 saf.84.t: "The Centenary Celebration Reaches Johannesburg"
 saf.84.d: "Since Heilbron the remainder of the re-enactment parade has somewhat diverted from 'die Pad van Suid-Afrika' and instead visited first a large amount of smaller settlements, with the northernmost one being the province of Zeerust. From there, the parade adjusted back south, moving through mining towns like Benoni and Roodepoort to eventually arrive the industrial city of Johannesburg. Despite the fact that Johannesburg too, is a British city, the crowd is large, although it will likely be dwarfed by the receiving crowd in Pretoria three days from now.\n\nAs the parade leaves the city, it is reinforced with additional ox-wagons of local Afrikaners, some of whom are flying the 'Vierkleur': the flag of the defeated South African Republic."
 saf.84.a: "We are about to finish our Trek!"

 saf.85.t: "The Centenary Celebration Arrives in Pretoria"
 saf.85.d: "The re-enactment parade has travelled throughout South Africa, and has now finally arrived at Pretoria, and more specifically Monumentkoppie - Monument Rock - where the foundation of a grand Voortrekker Monument is to be laid. The scale of the crowd that was waiting for the Trekkers can be described as nothing less than astounding: estimations are ranging from one hundred thousand to two hundred and fifty thousand Afrikaners, which could amount to a third of all Afrikaners in the country including cabinet ministers and even general Jan Smuts, although he declined to give a speech. The festivities are still officially apolitical, but the crowd was singing 'Die Stem' and calling for a republic.\n\nWhen the Ossewa's finally arrive, a giant bonfire was lit with the torches that have been kept alight from Cape Town and three Afrikaner women, descendants of the Voortrekker leaders, placed the first cornerstone of the monument. Then, the wagons are - without their oxen - carried upon the hill. Once firmly put in place, heroic scenes of the original Great Trek were re-enacted; the descendant of a British settler who gave one of the first Voortrekkers a bible was shouted down for reciting the English greeting of his ancestor in this play. In the evening, the festivities were closed off with the traditional South African Braai.\n\nAt the same time, the smaller delegation that split off at Vegkop arrived at Blood River, where they were welcomed by Dr. D.F. Malan who delivered the main address, electrifying the crowd by comparing the old trek with the current process of urbanisation and calling for the establishment of an Afrikaner republic."

Prime Minister Malan welcomed them, and in what was clearly a carefully choreographed operation, prime minister Malan at Blood River and defence minister Oswald Pirow at Monumentkoppie addressed each crowd at the exact same time with a rousing speech comparing the difficulties of the Trek with the present-day situation, and, riding on the festivity-induced wave of nationalistic fervour, seized the moment, and declared that South Africa would today, on Dingane's Day 1938, embark on their Trek to an independent republic. Both pointed at the draft of the Republic of South Africa Constitution Act, which would pass parliament tomorrow under Malan's guidance. The ecstatic crowds roared: 'Vryheid!' - Freedom - as if they could hear one another despite being 200 miles apart."

This coalition, headed by D.F. Malan, swiftly passed [getHavengaOrHertzogShort]'s neutrality motion through the Volksraad, affirming that South Africa would remain neutral."
 saf.94.a: "Britain will not drag more South African boys through the mud!"

 saf.95.t: "South Africa Declares Neutrality"
 saf.95.d: "Disturbing news: despite extensive efforts of the pro-imperial forces in South African politics to avoid this situation, the Afrikaner nationalist government in South Africa has passed a resolution through their parliament declaring that South Africa, despite being a dominion, will in fact remain neutral in the homecoming unless a participant of the conflict would directly threaten their own interests."
 saf.95.a: "How dare they abandon us in our hour of need!"

 saf.96.t: "The Homecoming has Started"
 saf.96.d: "The day has come: the British government-in-exile, to whose empire we, at least theoretically, belong, has started its operation to retake the British home isles from the syndicalist menace.\n\nThe South African Party opposition, as may be expected, fully supports South Africa's participation under a perceived duty to help the crown in this struggle, and for the sake of freedom and democracy.\n\nThe National government does not identify with this sense of obligation, and if there had been reason to believe that an unchecked Third Internationale would stay in Europe it might well have declared neutrality. However, in light of the Internationale's support for majority rule in South Africa and their rhetoric of spreading syndicalism to every corner of the world, has convinced the cabinet that the syndicalists are a mortal threat to the Afrikaner and even wider White South African nation and that it should consequently support the British struggle in its own interest."
 saf.96.a: "They want to destroy us!"

 saf.97.t: "The Homecoming has Started"
 saf.97.d: "The day has come: the British government-in-exile, to whose empire we belong, has started its operation to retake the British home isles from the syndicalist menace.\n\nOf course, the Smuts-led government is eager to fulfil South Africa's moral obligations to help liberate Britain from syndicalism, despite the moaning that is coming from the nationalist opposition banks who want to abandon them in this hour of need."
 saf.97.a: "God save the king!"

 saf.98.t: "A New Governor-General?"
 saf.98.d: "Our current Governor-General, George Villiers, has taken office in 1931 and is an exile noble who was the government's chief whip in Britain's house of lords before the syndicalist revolution. While the earl has been doing a fine job fulfilling the king's duty in South Africa, voices have arisen who claim it is high time that a South African citizen would fulfil this prestigious post, instead of an exile civil servant. While the king-emperor will likely not risk appointing an Afrikaner, the English-speaker sir Patrick Duncan has been proposed as a replacement for the earl. Some in the exiled government have also suggested binding South Africa closer to the crown by appointing a member of the royal family, but this idea has been politely deflected by the South African government given how sensitive the monarchy issue is here."
 saf.98.a: "Lobby for Duncan to be appointed!"
 saf.98.b: "Why change what isn't broken?"

 saf.99.t: "Sir Patrick Duncan Passes Away"
 saf.99.d: "The king's representative in South Africa, Governor-General Sir Patrick Duncan, has passed away in his home this night. As the first South African citizen to hold the post, he has served South Africa well as a figure rising above petty party politics of the Volksraad. Now, the question that comes next: the British seem not to be too fussed about quickly appointing a replacement, and as such, according to the South Africa Act, the chief justice of the Supreme Court will fill the role for the time being.\n\nSome [getGesuiwerdeOrNat] members are questioning the neutrality of De Wet and are lobbying to instead pressure the British to appoint Ernest George Jansen in the shortest possible time frame as a permanent governor-general."
 saf.99.a: "Because Jansen, a high-profile nationalist, is neutral..."
 saf.99.b: "Pressure the British to appoint Jansen."

 saf.100.t: "The International Socialist League"
 saf.100.d: "Founded in 1915, the International Socialist League is the primary syndicalist group operating in South Africa and is established in the neighbouring territories of the German and Portuguese colonial empires. It has established branches across all of South Africa, and formed the first black African trade union in the country, the Industrial Workers of Africa, in September 1917. It also formed a number of other unions amongst people of colour. While the leaders of the organisation itself are mainly drawn from the radical wing of the white working class, the Industrial Workers of Africa founded with their help would merge into the Industrial and Commercial Workers' Union, which has a substantial black African, 'Coloured' and Indian membership. While the South African Labour Party has remained apart from the ISL due to its more progressive stance on race relations, more radical members push for a reconciliation. In the meanwhile, the ISL and its affiliates in the ICU campaign for political reform in South Africa and organise resistance to the worst excesses the German administration commits against the native population in Mittelafrika."
 saf.100.a: "More socialists?!"

 saf.101.t: "ISL and Apartheid"
 saf.101.d: "The International Socialist League has completely condemned our government's racial policies and has united with other native rights groups to oppose us. We have responded by producing the Suppression of syndicalism Act, banning any party subscribing to syndicalism. The act defines syndicalism and its aims so sweepingly that anyone who opposes government policy risks being labelled as a syndicalist. Since the law specifically states that syndicalism aims to disrupt racial harmony, it can be frequently used to gag opposition to apartheid. Disorderly gatherings are banned, as are certain organisations that were deemed threatening to the government, such as the ICU and the smaller ANC."
 saf.101.a: "About time."

 saf.102.t: "The Population Registration Act"
 saf.102.d: "The Nationalist government's ideology believes South Africa does not comprise a single nation, but is made up of four distinct racial groups: white, black, 'coloured' and Asian. These groups are further split into 13 nations or racial federations. White people encompassed the English and Afrikaans language groups; the black populace was divided into ten such groups. The Population Registration Act, requires that every South African be classified into one of these racial 'population groups'. This act provides the foundation upon which the whole edifice of apartheid shall be constructed."
 saf.102.a: "Let me see your papers..."

 saf.103.t: "Petty Apartheid"
 saf.103.d: "Following the Population Registration Act, a series of laws came into force, collectively referred to as \"petty\" Apartheid, as opposed to the 'greater' Apartheid planned by the Nationalist government. The first of these was the Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act, prohibiting marriage between whites and people of other races. The Immorality Amendment Act forbade 'unlawful racial intercourse' and 'any immoral or indecent act' between a white and a black, Indian or 'coloured' person. Transport and civil facilities were segregated. Education was strictly segregated, with universities established for the sole use of Xhosa, Zulu, Sotho, 'Coloured', Indians etc. The cumulative effect of this was to stratify society solidly along racial lines."
 saf.103.a: "So be it."

 saf.104.t: "The Group Areas Act"
 saf.104.d: "The second stage of grand apartheid was the Group Areas Act. Until then, despite existing segregation law, most settlements had people of different races living side by side. This Act put an end to diverse areas and determined where one lived according to race. Each race was allotted its own area, which could be used as a basis for force eviction, allowing the government to demolish black shanty town slums and forced white employers to pay for the construction of housing for those black workers who were permitted to reside in cities otherwise reserved for whites."
 saf.104.a: "Off the reservation."

 saf.105.t: "The Native Trust and Homeland Act"
 saf.105.d: "Territorial separation was hardly a new institution in South Africa. There were, for example, the 'reserves' created under the British government in the nineteenth century. Under apartheid, the percentage of land reserved was increased from 8 to 13 percent to be used for black homelands, still a relatively small amount compared with the total population, and generally in economically unproductive areas of the country. These homelands or 'Bantustans' divided South Africa into a number of separate states, each of which is supposed to develop into a separate nation-state for the different ethnic groups. The practical effect of this legislation was to remove the citizenship of natives living within South Africa and reduce their status to that of migrant labour. The Promotion of Bantu Self-government Act abolished the remaining parliamentary representation for black people under the Representation of Natives Act, now represented by their own 'national' authorities."
 saf.105.a: "Interesting."

 saf.107.t: "Chairman Jones Addresses the War in Europe"
 saf.107.d: "Chairman Jones has called an extraordinary meeting of government ministers and ISL leaders, in order to address the growing crisis in Europe. The final struggle against capitalist-imperialism appears to now be unfolding on the banks of the Rhine and across the waves of the North Sea, but it is only a matter of time before the 'Second Great War' reaches our own shores. The Treaty of Johannesburg with the Entente scoundrels was merely a lull in the conflict and very soon the old Rand Lords will return to besiege us once more, backed up by Canadian guns and colonial conscripts. Faced with this coming challenge, a staunch pacifist such as Chairman Jones has had a hard time finding a solution that will not repudiate his own ideals. The ISL itself is ostensibly a pacifist organisation, but with the aftermath of our own violent revolution and with the great anti-imperialist war waging in Europe, it seems these notions are beginning to be overturned. Already, men like Minister of Defence Moses Kotane and Deputy-Chairman John Stephen 'Johnny' Gomas have urged Jones to take a stand against hypocritical 'social-pacifism' among the South African left, which they claim is a relic of bourgeois sentiments.\n\nUltimately, feeling that he could not give his assent to these policies and fearing that his resentment of these pro-war proposals would bring political disunity, Chairman Jones has opted to retire on his own terms. Deputy-Chairman Gomas will oversee a transition of power to a new chairman, namely Moses Kotane, who has consolidated support among both the legislature and the broader ISL institutions by giving fiery speeches in favour of war and urging for the creation of a 'Non-European United Front', in order to coordinate South Africa's role in the Third Internationale due to our unique geographical and political situation, as well as to generate enthusiasm for war among the mostly disinterested Black population. South Africa will favour a supportive role in the conflict, but there are still indications we may become a co-belligerent in the war. It is not a question of 'if', but rather 'when', the forces of British and German colonial terror will march against us."
 saf.107.a: "We must face down both the enemy in Europe, as well as the monster devouring Africa!"

 saf.108.t: "The South African Trades and Labour Council"
 saf.108.d: "Established in 1930, the South African Trades and Labour Council (SATLC) is the largest unified trade union body in the whole country. It was originally a merger between two other historical trade union federations. The first was the 'South African Trades Union Council' which formed in the wake of the 1924 Industrial Conciliation Act and represented white workers, becoming known for its radical leadership under Labour party members William Henry 'Bill' Andrews and James 'Jimmy' Briggs, who are today part of the Madeley faction of the party. The second was the far older 'Cape Federation of Labour Unions', originally founded in 1913 to represent both the white and the coloured workers along the coast, it was led by trade union veteran Robert 'Bob' Stuart. The SATLC, formed from these two entities, is more or less dominated by the old Trades Union Council, with a heavy focus on the white workers and the moderate politics of the Labour Party. Ideologically, there is a strong reformist belief among the union rank and file, but the inner bureaucracy of the SATLC is known to be under the sway of the more radical, popular trade union leaders who manage the organising efforts. A few of these leaders in SATLC's affiliated trade unions are also well known to harbour racist views, whilst the average white South African worker and union member typically leans towards moderate or extreme social attitudes on race. Key figures in SATLC's leadership, such as Andrews, have expressed hope for mending South Africa's racial struggles through a new radical policy of 'parallel unionism', hoping to one day unify black and coloured workers under their own separate but equal system of trade unions. In no small part thanks to Andrews, an informal alliance exists between the SATLC and the more radical left wing groups in South Africa, most notably the ICU and the ISL. Despite the schisms within both the Labour Party and the broader left over the merits of recognising the syndicalist ICU, it currently seems that the SATLC remains on the side of a unified proletariat of all colours, even though the disgruntlement among the white workers is becoming more and more apparent as the years pass."
 saf.108.a: "Rabble rousers!"

 saf.117.t: "Africanisation of Toponyms"
 saf.117.d: "Now that the white imperialists have finally been removed from their unfair position, and now that South Africa is finally the South Africans', it is time that we rid the nation of traces of oppression. References to Afrikaners and British imperialists alike need to be wiped away. After almost three centuries, South Africa once again is an African nation, and this should be reflected in our toponymy."
 saf.117.a: "There, this shall do!"

 SAF_945_toponym_rename: "§YNorthern Cape§!:\n   §YMafeking§! is renamed to §YMafikeng§!"
 SAF_946_toponym_rename: "§YEastern Cape§!:\n   §YEast London§! is renamed to §YEmonti§!"

 saf.119.t: "White Flight"
 saf.119.d: "Much of the South African bourgeoisie does not take kindly to the new socialist government. These communities are now gripped with fear of being swamped, both by other racial groups and are leaving South Africa in large numbers to countries they consider to be more friendly to their kind, such as elsewhere in the British Empire or in Europe.\n\nWhile fortunately, many others also choose to stay here, the unfortunate truth is that these emigrants take with them much valuable knowledge and expertise that thanks to the discriminatory segregationist education system is not beholden to the wider population. It is believed time will be needed to recover from this setback."
 saf.119.a: "The proletariat will replace them!"

 saf.120.t: "The National Party Congress of [GetYear]"
 saf.120.d: "With an eye to the coming elections, the National Party has decided to organise a national congress in Pretoria to determine party policy of the next few years. Members from across the nation have travelled to our government's seat.\n\nDuring the course of the congress, the leader of the National Party in the Cape Province, Dr. D.F. Malan, has been chastising the party's nationwide leader, general James Hertzog, on many accounts, especially concerning the failure to abolish the monarchy during his term as prime minister from 1924 to 1929 and his subsequent failure to defeat Jan Smuts and his South African Party, for which the moderate and vague standpoints of Hertzog are to be blamed according to Malan. It comes as little surprise then that Malan subsequently challenged Hertzog for the party leadership of the party. The members were asked to speak out their preferences. Hertzog's failure in the last 8 years to seize the office of prime minister back from general Smuts had sealed his fate: dr. Malan would lead the National Party in the next general election, on an aggressive republican and Afrikaner Nationalist platform, decrying that once given the mandate he will declare South Africa's full independence as a republic now that the exiles are not in a position to act against such a measure."
 saf.120.a: "The time of compromise with the Nationalists seems to be over."

 saf.121.t: "Dingane's Day [GetYear]"
 saf.121.d: "Also known as Day of the Vow, the 16th of December was designated as the Union of South Africa's national holiday at its inception in 1910, although it was earlier already informally celebrated in the British colony of Natal and in the old Boer Republics and their British colonial successors.\n\nThe holiday commemorates the unlikely victory of the Voortrekkers at Blood River in Natal on the 16th of December 1838, against the forces of the Zulu king Dingane. As such, the day holds importance to Afrikaner nationalism as well, whose adherents view the victory that day as a sign from God that they were to shape a western country in South Africa's wilderness.\n\nThe day is generally celebrated with sports matches, especially cricket, theatre shows, church gatherings and other festivities. Unsurprisingly given the context, the nation's black African majority is less fond of the holiday, and usually pick this date to protest racial discrimination."
 saf.121.a: "Ons land Suid-Afrika."

 saf.122.t: "Dingane's Day [GetYear]"
 saf.122.d: "It is the 16th of December once again, the national holiday of South Africa. Throughout the nation, from Cape Town to Durban to Zoutpansberg, South Africans, although mainly Afrikaners, celebrate their nationhood and history, and the glory of God who brought them here.\n\nGames of cricket are being organised, theatre shows and some businesses are open for service. Later in the day church gatherings were organised, where the story of the Voortrekkers' vow to God was recounted. In some families, the day was closed with a traditional South African barbecue, the so-called 'braai'."

Some newspapers have already declared Afrikaner Nationalism a thing of the past, reduced to a large minor party which could at best secure a king-maker position.\n\nOn the other side of the spectrum, the Labour Party has been making gains. Seeing this, the experts predict that the dominance of the [SAF.GetRulingParty] may not last, and that the Labour Party may become a new competitor to it, to the left."

 saf.145.t: "The Passing of General Hertzog"
 saf.145.d: "The right honourable General James Barry Munnik Hertzog has passed away in his family home today. The death of the Boer general of German heritage from the Orange Free State, former prime minister and founder of the National Party marks a turning point in South African history, calling in a final end to the rivalry between the politicians from Transvaal and Orange Free State which defined the South African political scene since the formation of the union.\n\nThe National Party, which used to be lead by Hertzog, released a statement honouring the general. General Smuts also praised his former rival's contribution to the South Africa's political scene, despite the fact that they did not always see eye to eye."
 saf.145.a: "Rest in peace..."

 saf.146.t: "The Passing of General Hertzog"
 saf.146.d: "The right honourable General James Barry Munnik Hertzog has passed away in his family home today. The death of the Boer general of German heritage from the Orange Free State, sitting prime minister and founder of the National Party marks a turning point in South African history, calling in a final end to the rivalry between the politicians from Transvaal and Orange Free State which defined the South African political scene since the formation of the union.\n\nAs preparations for the funeral are underway, the National Party needs to decide who shall become their new party leader and thus the new prime minister. It is widely known that Hertzog favoured his protégé within the more moderate faction within the National Party, Nicolaas Havenga. However, Dr. D.F. Malan has also thrown his hat in the ring for party leadership and enjoys much greater name recognition among the party membership."
 saf.146.a: "Havenga wins the contest."
 saf.146.b: "The party membership favours Malan."

 saf.147.t: "The Passing of General Hertzog"
 saf.147.d: "The right honourable General James Barry Munnik Hertzog has passed away in his family home today. The death of the Boer general of German heritage from the Orange Free State, former prime minister and founder of the National Party marks a turning point in South African history, calling in a final end to the rivalry between the politicians from Transvaal and Orange Free State which defined the South African political scene since the formation of the union.\n\nAs preparations for the funeral are underway, the National Party needs to decide who shall become their new party leader.

 saf.147.a: "Malan's victory was unavoidable..."

 saf.148.t: "The Rise of the Regiment of the Stone"
 saf.148.d: "Disturbing news from the coal mining town of Ermelo in the Transvaal has arrived. A group of armed Zulu men has attacked the local bank and taken away into the Drakensberg Mountains with what were supposed to be the wages of the miners. According to reports from eye-witnesses, the robbers claimed the continuation of the Ninevites, a historically feared gang, which has lost much of its prominence - at least outside of the prisons and as a unified entity - following their leader Nongoloza's disavowal following encouragement of the authorities.\n\nIt is theorised that economic hardship as a result of Black Monday must have pushed these men who either were previously affiliated with the gang, or knew someone previously affiliated to it, to organise once again. Despite their best intentions, the police have been unable to track them down."
 saf.148.a: "Redirect extra resources to bring them to justice!"

 saf.149.t: "The Regiment of the Stone Hits Nelspruit"
 saf.149.d: "The new iteration of the Regiment of the Stone gang has emerged from their apparent Drakensberg hideout once again, this time in Nelspruit, where they hit the local train station, a key stopover on the line between Johannesburg and the port of Lourenço Marques in Mozambique, and made off with valuables held for safekeeping there. Once again, police stood powerless to prevent an evidently well-planned escape into the bush to the south of the town.\n\nDisturbingly, it appears the gang has already grown in number since their heist in Ermelo, and similarly worryingly, the town of Barberton, where Nongoloza is incarcerated on a rape charge, is only some 20 miles away from Nelspruit. Police theorises that it is the gang's intention to break him out. Others disagree and point out that this would be too obvious, and that the two successful heists, in combination with smaller robberies underway, have already netted the group a substantial amount of wealth. One more successful heist would likely procure the monetary means needed for the group to disappear forever, and in modern times and resources like auto-mobiles and aeroplanes, it seems implausible that a gang would remain at large for as long as the previous gangs have. Therefore they propose an attack on Barberton would be a large risk following their existing achievements, and they instead point at the town of Lydenburg as the next target. Some don't agree with this proposal either, and expect the gang will aim to leave South Africa by entering Portuguese East Africa as soon as possible, as the route of movement from Ermelo to Nelspruit suggests. If we can correctly estimate their next move, we might be able to entrap them."
 saf.149.a: "It may be obvious, but Nongoloza is like a religious figure to them!"
 saf.149.b: "A gold transport is planned to leave Lydenburg in two weeks' time..."
 saf.149.c: "They clearly intend to cross the border, we should wait for them there..."

 saf.150.t: "The Barberton Breakout"
 saf.150.d: "Excellent news! Our estimation that the Regiment of the Stone gang would attempt to free their former leader, Nongoloza, was correct. If the South African Police would not have been there to assist the prison wardens, they might well have succeeded, but instead they were entrapped. A shootout which could be clearly heard in Barberton itself ensued, until a large part of the gang was deceased and the remainder wisely decided to surrender. Law-abiding South African citizens need not fear these men anymore, nor was Nongoloza given the opportunity to escape, although there is little indication he conspired with the gang.\n\nThe gang members who surrendered have guided our officials to their hidden encampment some four miles from the prison, where we have recovered most of the stolen goods and money from the Ermelo and Nelspruit heists."
 saf.150.a: "Excellent work, men!"

 saf.151.t: "The Barberton Breakout"
 saf.151.d: "While a South African Police detachment attempting to entrap the Regiment of the Stone was obtusely waiting for a robbery that would never come, the gang simply struck at the most obvious target: the Barberton prison.\n\nThe poor prison wardens, facing an overwhelming amount of criminals, were left little choice but to hand the elderly Nongoloza, as well as some other gang members incarcerated at the prison, over to the gang, who was reportedly reluctant at first but eventually did join the gang in their escape. Now with Nongoloza within their ranks, the gang has disappeared into the wilderness again, but on a positive note, the Lydenburg gold transport safely arrived in the vault of the Standard Bank of South Africa in Johannesburg."
 saf.151.a: "Jislaaik!"

 saf.152.t: "The Barberton Breakout"
 saf.152.d: "The attempt to entrap the Regiment of the Stone at the border was perhaps doomed from the beginning, for the border region is simply too large: the stretch of the border over which the gang might have made its escape was well over a 100 miles. Properly reinforcing the entire region to prevent a crossing would have been impossible.\n\nBut this does not matter either way, because it appears the Ninevites never intended to cross the border. Instead they stayed in the vicinity of Nelspruit and struck Barberton Prison, where the wardens were, under the pressure of the overwhelming force of the gang, left with little choice but to hand Nongoloza over, and some other people incarcerated there with affiliations to either the old gang or new gang members."
 saf.152.a: "They chose the ou boef over escape..."

 saf.153.t: "The Piet Retief Heist"
 saf.153.d: "After a couple of months of very little activity of note, the Regiment of the Stone has again struck: this time they have emptied out a jewellery in the town of Piet Retief, leaving with thousands of pounds worth of jewellery. Despite the police's best attempts, and a subsequent large scale search through Swaziland, where we suspect the gang had been hiding between the events in Barberton and now, and where they probably retreated back to, we have been unable to either find them, nor did we find back any of the riches they have stolen, aside from some South African Pounds spent in Mbabane which can be traced back to the first bank heist in Ermelo."
 saf.153.a: "How can these bandits stay out of our hands for so long?!"

 saf.154.t: "The Regiment of the Stone Disappears"
 saf.154.d: "For months now, there has been no regiment activity anymore. Some believe a dispute has caused the gang to disperse, others believe they have simply crossed the border with Portuguese East Africa with their loot at some point and left South Africa forever. Whatever the case, it seems unlikely by now that the stolen goods will be recovered. Hopefully the victims were properly insured.\n\nThe failure to control the gang does not reflect well on the South African Police."
 saf.154.a: "At least peace has returned to Transvaal..."

 saf.155.t: "The Empire Exhibition of 1936"
 saf.155.d: "In most of the world, the British Empire, the undisputed power dominating the international scene in the 19th century and the opening years of the 20th is but a fading memory. Not so in the upper echelons of Johannesburg society, where men in red garments still speak about their exploits on five continents with one another under the enjoyment of a gin-tonic supplied by a Zulu servant.\n\nFollowing two years of preparation, the Empire exhibition, celebrating the city of Johannesburg's golden jubilee, has been opened with great festivities. The exhibitions both boast our achievements in the last half-century and include representatives from most of what remains of the empire: from Canada and the Caribbean to Australasia and its pacific extensions. While an atmosphere of nostalgia is unmistakable, the celebration takes away from the talks about liberation and politics holding grip on our country, and shows that the empire is still alive as ever!"
 saf.155.a: "God save the King!"

 saf.156.t: "Population Influx in the Urban Areas"
 saf.156.d: "The new South Africa does not endorse the old racist measures employed by the old racist capitalist regime, which has been frantically trying to keep black South Africans out of South Africa's urban regions like Johannesburg and Cape Town. Now that this regime has fallen, their barbaric policies are naturally being rescinded. Unfortunately, this brings some unintended side-effects with it: rural South Africa is not very rich in opportunity, and thus, with the possibility of moving to cities like Johannesburg, Cape Town and Durban suddenly no longer severely restricted, many thousands of South Africans are now leaving their ancestral lands to seek employment in the factories and mines. Unfortunately, the local governments do not actually have the resources to handle this unprecedented influx and most of these migrants are thus forced to settle in existing townships at a scale never seen before, overpopulating them and causing extremely squalid conditions and disease in these townships as a result."
 saf.156.a: "We need to expand our housing facilities!"

 saf.157.t: "Implementing the Land Restitution"
 saf.157.d: "Over the course of the 19th century, the Dutch and British invaders have stolen the bountiful farmlands of South Africa and divided it amongst themselves. It took until 1913 until they even considered giving some of it back, more because they didn't want us in the cities they had built on it than out of kindness, and even then their goal was limited to a laughable 8%, when we made up nearly 70% of the population according to our own census. Even when they subscribed to the tenets of socialism so short ago, they still rejected turning this historical abomination into a more equitable settlement.\n\nNo more: we shall take what was stolen from us and return it to the people. From today on South Africa will once more belong to its inhabitants and not a small group of capitalist European colonisers using its ‘property' as an excuse to exploit our people!"
 saf.157.a: "South Africa belongs to the South African!"

 saf.158.t: "The Passing of King George V"
 saf.158.d: "The King of Great Britain and Ireland and Emperor of India, George V, has passed away in exile in Canada. While in Canada preparations are made for the funeral and the ascension of his eldest son Edward to the thrones of the dominions, South Africa included, and the theoretical throne of Great Britain, life goes on in South Africa: with most of the Afrikaner population passively or actively pursuing a republic, and the Native, Coloured and Asiatic populations largely indifferent to a foreign monarchy seated thousands of miles away, mourning over the late king remains mostly confined to the English-speaking white population and the more or less obligatory procedures for a dominion government like declaring a state of mourning and hanging the national flag at half-mast on public property."
 saf.158.a: "The king is dead, long live the king!"

 saf.159.t: "South Africa Wishes to Join the Internationale"
 saf.159.d: "The newly established worker's government of South Africa announced recently that they wish to join our alliance. Do we want to include the South Africans to join us against the international forces of capitalism?"
 saf.159.a: "Welcome, comrades!"
 saf.159.b: "Eh... Not really, actually..."

 saf.160.t: "We Join the Internationale!"
 saf.160.d: "The Third Internationale is happy to admit the latest member to the quest of destroying international capitalism. Now we are truly part of the socialist struggle for the world!"
 saf.160.a: "Together we shall defeat the capitalists!"

 saf.161.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Refuses"
 saf.161.d: "For whatever reason, [From.GetNameDef] has decided to refuse our entry into the Internationale. We are on our own."
 saf.161.a: "They don't want our strategic control over the Cape?!"

 saf.162.t: "Unemployment Decreases"
 saf.162.d: "As the South African pound is reduced in value somewhat, it becomes cheaper to buy our gold, produce and industrial goods. This makes our exports more attractive for foreign markets, which in turn is having a positive effect on our domestic employment!"
 saf.162.a: "Hurrah!"

 saf.163.t: "Hyperinflation!"
 saf.163.d: "Our decision to keep devaluing the South African Pound after it started to have an effect on our economy may have been a mistake. The inflation now started snowballing and every calculation is revealing that the domestic price level will double twice this year. As everyone's monetary possessions are melting away before the sun, we have basically no choice but to abandon our current currency and start again with a new one. Unsurprisingly, the opposition is blasting the prime minister for this poor monetary policy"
 saf.163.a: "I call it: South African Pound Two"

 saf.165.t: "The Financial Department Reports!"
 saf.165.d: "Economy minister has had a report compiled for you on the state of the South African economy, prime minister. Your secretary has left it on your desk to be inspected."
 saf.165.a: "Ah, splendid! I will have a look!"

 saf.166.t: "Sovereign Debt Crisis"
 saf.166.d: "Terrible! It was known that the cabinet had been unorthodox with the usage of loans, but no one had expected that it would be this bad! The enormous debt South Africa has incurred in their attempts to counter Black Monday's effects can't be accounted for with the rest of the yearly budget and we are forced to declare that our debts can't be repaid, bankruptcy in effect! Domestic and foreign investors alike will lose their money and surely not be happy!"
 saf.166.a: "Oh no!"

 saf.167.t: "Sovereign Debt Crisis in South Africa"
 saf.167.d: "Irresponsible spending by the South African government has finally turned out to be unsustainable: this morning they have been forced to officially declare bankruptcy, apparently as a result of Black Monday: they are no longer capable of fulfilling their debts. Many [Root.GetAdjective] investors who invested in South African government bonds have now lost their money."
 saf.167.a: "Most unfortunate!"

 saf.168.t: "The Mobilisation and the Economy"
 saf.168.d: "With war tearing its way through South Africa once again, all of our resources are being mobilised by necessity. War bonds have already been put into use and unemployed South Africans are being mobilised to fight. For better or worse, the sudden mobilisation of the nation will ensure that Black Monday will thoroughly be behind us: once the war is over we will need every man to rebuild after all..."
 saf.168.a: "The economy is the least of our worries anyway!"

 saf.169.t: "Founding of the Orlando Boys Club"
 saf.169.d: "In the township of Orlando in Johannesburg a group of migrant workers has founded a club to periodically practise the sport of football...\n\nWhile the sport has been practised in South Africa since the late 19th century, even in an organised fashion, very few formal clubs have existed here so far. Furthermore, the reputation as a British lower class sport did not do its spread much good as it has been associated with the Union of Britain. As such, the new club in Orlando is one of the first of its kind, and may turn out to be a turning point in the popularity of the sport. One thing can be assured: the inhabitants of Orlando seem to enjoy the sport a lot..."
 saf.169.a: "Boys Club sounds so drab, what if you call yourself pirates?"

 saf.170.t: "Rise of Flytaal"
 saf.170.d: "The police reports a strange phenomenon in the Johannesburg township of Sophiatown: apparently an Afrikaans-based vernacular is developing, blending Afrikaans with heavy English, Tswana and Zulu influences. Apparently this Flytaal or endonymically Flaaitaal has been used for a longer stretch of time by the local underworld as a coded language, but it is now finding its way to common use on the street as it becomes a symbol for rebelliousness against the state.\n\nThis new slang language makes it quite troubling for the police to use informants as township outsiders are increasingly having trouble infiltrating local gangs or even the community as a whole now..."
 saf.170.a: "What are they saying?!"

 saf.171.t: "Foundation of the ANC Youth League"
 saf.171.d: "The African National Congress (earlier known as the South African Native National Congress) has been a force behind native emancipation since its foundation in 1912. The group, comprised of both black intellectuals and tribal chiefs, has stagnated however during the twenties, with the Industrial Commercial Workers' Union (ICU) taking over its prominence as the foremost native rights activists. Since then, the ANC had been working to create a united front with Indians and Coloureds, and sympathetic whites to achieve reform.\n\nUnder the leadership of Anton Lembede, several young ANC-aligned activists - Nelson Mandela, B. Masekela, Ashby Mda, Ida Mtwa, Lillian Ngoyi, James Njongweni, William Nkomo, Duma Nokwe, Walter Sisulu, Oliver Tambo and Dan Tloome - have gathered in opposition against this compromissory attitude, and formed the African National Congress Youth League in Johannesburg. The new youth league is known to make use of Africanist rhetoric, and released a ‘Programme of Action' against the white minority regime, involving the use of boycotts, strikes and defiance tactics. Some claim this new sub-organisation may prove to be the turning point for the ANC's fortunes, enabling it to address a new generation of activists."
 saf.171.a: "Insignificant rabble-rousers!"

 saf.172.t: "The Native Education Act"
 saf.172.d: "The Coloured Enfranchisement Act has, unsurprisingly, shifted South Africa's politics quite a bit to the progressive side.\n\nThis has enabled certain political goals of the progressive cause, which were earlier political impossibilities, to be put into action.\n\nOne of the first of these goals is the Native Education Act. Prior to [GetYear] non-whites have had to rely on religious institutions for their lower education, while whites have had access to state-funded and private schools of western standard. The Act significantly increases funding for non-white education to close this gap, and makes provisions to help non-whites to fulfil the requirements to enrol in university."
 saf.172.a: "The gap of knowledge needs closing!"

 saf.173.t: "The Native Participation Act"
 saf.173.d: "A regularly stated belief by Jan Hendrik Hofmeyr was that at one point the native population would have to be represented by one of their own. Unsurprisingly, this was the Nationalists' worst fear, and many white South Africans appeared not to have grown to the idea, seeing as the publication of this notion tended to swing by-elections in the Nationalist favour.\n\nHowever, times are changing, and now a large enough majority in the Volksraad has been gathered to pass the Native Participation Act. This act mandates that the cabinet is to appoint a member of the native community as the Minister of Native Affairs with a vote in the cabinet. The [getSAPorUnited] has accompanied the tabled bill with the intention to appoint a native to the role as soon as this bill has passed the Volksraad."
 saf.173.a: "Motion carries!"

 saf.174.t: "Treaty of Johannesburg"
 saf.174.d: "Pro-[ENT.GetAdjective] forces in South Africa have been soundly defeated, and our forces have proven unable to re-establish a foothold in the region. Given these facts, we are left with little choice besides accepting the syndicalist takeover of South Africa.\n\nOur representatives have met with their South African counterparts in Johannesburg, the birthplace of the South African revolution. According to the terms of the treaty, we are to recognise South Africa's provinces, as well as the High Commissioner Territories of Basutoland, Swaziland and Bechuanaland, as rightful South African territories, and our claims to South Africa are to be relinquished."
 saf.174.a: "Signed."

 saf.175.t: "Treaty of Johannesburg"
 saf.175.d: "Hoggenheimer has been beheaded: the South African worker has soundly taken their destiny from the cowardly [ENT.GetAdjective] imperialists and capitalists who have looted our country for such a long time!\n\nCrowds in Johannesburg are shouting down the [ENT.GetAdjective] diplomats that have arrived to sign their government's acceptance that South Africa will be a free and independent member of the international community."
 saf.175.a: "If only Taffy Long could see us now!"

 saf.176.t: "Revolution in South Africa"
 saf.176.d: "Disastrous news has arrived in South Africa: our stern ally, prime minister Jan Smuts, has been ousted by a mob of syndicalist rebels, roughly recreating the revolution in Britain in 1925. The proletarians have declared a worker's state in Pretoria, on the model of the Union of Britain. Given the strategic positioning of South Africa, there are those who seek an immediate intervention in South Africa to drag it back into the fold, but given South Africa's isolated location, it might be quite difficult to actually invade them, especially on such a short notice."
 saf.176.a: "We cannot afford to be cut off from our Asian and Oceanic possessions!"
 saf.176.b: "Disastrous, but we cannot act now!"

 saf.177.t: "Formalisation of the Christian National Republic"
 saf.177.d: "In obedience to God Almighty and His Holy Word, the Afrikaans people acknowledge their national destination, as embodied in their Voortrekker past, for the Christian development of South Africa, and for that reason accept the Republican Constitution which follows, to take the place of all the existing regulations in law which are in conflict with it, and especially with the total abolition of the British Kingship over the British subjects within the Republic. As will be seen, the constitution is only intended for the Afrikaners; the English are to play a subordinate role.\n\nThis is the first article of the new constitution which has been ratified by Commander-General Van Rensburg today in Pretoria. The new basis of South African law, drafted by professor Lodewicus du Plessis of the Potchefstroom University, does away completely with the old 1909 South Africa Act-based constitution of D.F. Malan's republic.\n\nThe new constitution heralds Afrikaans as the national language while demoting English to be merely ‘supplementary', vests all powers into the office of ‘Volksleier' - people's leader - who is only responsible to God, not beholden to any votes in the advisory parliament, and who can implement and ratify laws on his personal signature. Citizenship will be beholden only to those the 'of whom it can be expected that they will act as builders up of the nation' and those are called ‘burgers'. It also gives the state the express permission to censor those ‘burgers' and organisations that endanger public order or the good morale of the republic.\n\nWith this, the power of the newly ordained Volksleier Van Rensburg is legitimised and supreme."
 saf.177.a: "Lewe die Volksleier!"

 saf.178.t: "‘N Nuwe Rehoboth"
 saf.178.d: "The Rehoboth Basters are an Afrikaans-speaking Coloured community who moved into South West Africa from the cape in the 19th century. They led an independent existence with their own ‘Free Republic of Rehoboth' until the Germans took control over the region, from whom they managed to extract a degree of autonomy. During the Weltkrieg, they attempted, unsuccessfully, to remain neutral in the German-South African conflict, culminating in the battle of Sam Khubis where they successfully defended their community from German forces. When in 1919 South Africa was forced to turn South West Africa back over to the Germans, the Rehoboth community was split between those who would inevitably be seen as pro-South African collaborators and sympathisants (especially Sam Khubis veterans) who were forced into exile in South Africa, and those remaining in Rehoboth, with their historic autonomy revoked.\n\nNow that Bechuanaland has been opened to white settlement, their \"Kaptein\", or chief, Albert Mouton has petitioned the prime minister for the establishment of a \"Nuwe Rehoboth\" in Bechuanaland, relatively close to their old settlement across the border, which would be expected to attract the scattered exiles. And if we would grant them the right to apply their Vaderlike Wette (constitution) to the settlement as they ask, it will probably attract at least some of those who remained in Mittelafrika as well..."
 saf.178.a: "Their aid was invaluable, let us repay the favour!"
 saf.178.b: "We can allot them some land, but they will remain beholden to our law."
 saf.178.c: "We welcome only white farmers in the Nuweveld!"

 saf.179.t: "Chaos in Southwest Africa"
 saf.179.d: "The gigantic German colony in central Africa, stretching a continuous stretch of land from the Gold Coast to Zanzibar, has collapsed in on itself. What was once the pride of the German nation has transformed into possibly the largest anarchy and violence the world has ever seen. South West Africa, or Deutsch-Südwestafrika is no exception to this rule, with white German settlers, bolstered by Afrikaners who moved into the region over the course of the 19th century, desperately attempting to suppress a native revolt against their rule.\n\nFact is that South West Africa has for a long time been a strategic goal for South Africa, and between 1915 and 1919 it was us who had been administering the territory. Calls are rising throughout South Africa that this is the time to undo ahistorical injustice: having had to turn South West Africa back over to the Hun after we had won it with South African blood, because the war was lost in Europe. They call on the prime minister to send the Defence Force to South West Africa, put down the native revolt and integrate the colony into our nation. A telegraph message to Windhoek has been drafted, proposing that South Africa intervenes and suppresses the Ovambo in return for their acceptance that South West Africa will, this time permanently, fall under the stewardship of South Africa."
 saf.179.a: "Contact Windhoek, we shall assume their protection!"
 saf.179.b: "South West Africa isn't worth more South African blood..."

 saf.180.t: "A Message from Pretoria"
 saf.180.d: "South Africa has had deep down had a desire to conquer South West Africa and had temporarily also completed this goal between 1915 and 1919. As such, they have been watching our situation with a keen eye and today a telegraph message from Pretoria has arrived in Windhuk. They express a willingness to intervene in our little problem with Ovamboland, but then we are to accept that the South African forces will never leave. It's clear that they just want us to acquiesce in the fact that the German Mittelafrika dream has evaporated and that we will henceforth be South Africans. Some call this unacceptable, that we are German subjects and shall remain so. But others ask if it is truly worth risking the well-being of our people, the White Namibians, for this dream: support from the Vaterland might be months away and if we cannot hold back the Ovambo, we may be exiled or worse by that native authority. Besides, South Africa may well intervene even if we reject their interference, the only difference will be that they will also be shooting at us..."
 saf.180.a: "It is best for our people..."
 saf.180.b: "We are subjects of the Kaiser and shall remain so!"

 saf.181.t: "Südwestafrika Acquiesces"
 saf.181.d: "Good news, the authorities in Windhoek have recognised that a South African intervention is in their best interest and convey that they will welcome our army coming to their aid. The first units have already set foot in South West Africa for the first time since the humiliation in 1919. On the home front, prominent nationalists are expressing their support for the Springboks coming to the aid of the beleaguered Afrikaners and their German brothers in South West Africa against the heathen foe while those aligned with general Smuts are speculating about the next step towards realising greater South Africa. The only opposition comes from the far left: the ISL, ICU and the smaller ANC, who declaim the action as ‘flagrant disrespect for the self-determination of Ovambo people'."
 saf.181.a: "Springboks to the rescue!"

 saf.182.t: "Südwestafrika Stands Defiant"
 saf.182.d: "Unfortunately, the authorities in Windhoek cling to the objectively outdated idea of being imperial subjects of Germany, and vow to resist any attempts by South Africa to annex their home. While it is doubtful the rag-tag bunch of garrison leftovers would be able to resist us, intervening despite the lack of support from local whites would be seen as less legitimate by the world at large and may endanger our relations with the Germans. On the other hand, it is unlikely that this setback will change domestic public opinion on an intervention much, which is overwhelmingly in favour with both the right and the left."
 saf.182.a: "We shall pacify these misguided Huns as well!"
 saf.182.b: "Our relationship with Berlin is too important!"

 saf.183.t: "Safeguarding Portuguese East Africa?"
 saf.183.d: "Disaster has struck the Portuguese: mainland Portugal has been overrun and their overseas empire is crumbling as opportunistic actors attempt to poach their possessions in both Africa and Asia. One of those possessions is right next on our border: Portuguese Mozambique. Its ports fulfil a vital export role for our industrial base in the Rand and most of it is commonly included in the concept of Greater South Africa. Possibly, the Germans might be plotting to take colony which would increase its leverage over us.\n\nHawks are urging us to act first by ordering our army to cross the Mozambican border, so as to ensure that South Africa's interests are secured, and some of them are probably hoping we will annex the colony outright in the future. On the other hand, doves reject this course of action and point out that this would force South Africa to take international responsibility for the Mozambicans henceforth, and unnecessarily inflames tensions with the Germans and Portuguese."
 saf.183.a: "Order the army to move for Lourenço Marques!"
 saf.183.b: "More natives in South Africa? I think not!"
 saf.183.c: "We cannot take the risk!"

 saf.184.t: "South Africa Moves into Mozambique"
 saf.184.d: "The South African Defence Force has crossed the South African-Mozambican border into Mozambique. While it is ostensibly to protect the population and prevent a hostile takeover from a third power, it cannot be overlooked that South Africa has had ambitions to turn the Zambezi into its ‘natural border' and it is highly doubtful they will be inclined to return it at a later point."
 saf.184.a: "Never trust a Protestant!"

 saf.185.t: "South Africa Moves into Mozambique"
 saf.185.d: "The South African Defence Force has crossed the South African-Mozambican border into Mozambique. According to Pretoria it is with the goal to protect the local population and to prevent a so-called ‘third power', which is almost certainly to mean us, from occupying the colony. The part of Mozambique north of the River Zambezi is much closer to our domains than to South Africa however, and if we move at once we can secure them before the South Africans, who, given their past rhetoric about a greater South Africa including Mozambique south of the Zambezi, are unlikely to bring things to a head over that."

 saf.186.d: "Following our crossing of the border closely, the Germans have scrambled to secure the Northern part of Mozambique, which is the furthest away from our own country. Now the de-facto border splits Mozambique in half, following the Zambezi River. Their reaction has certainly legitimised our takeover.

 saf.187.t: "Stellenbosch Becomes Monolingually Afrikaans"
 saf.187.d: "The University of Stellenbosch, undeniably one of South Africa's most prestigious institutions of higher education, based in Stellenbosch, has closed a process which had been going on for years. From this next academic year on forward the last two English and High Dutch (meaning the variety of the Netherlands) subjects will no longer be taught any longer. This means that from coming academic year forth, Stellenbosch will teach only in Afrikaans, rendering them the only monolingually Afrikaans university in the country. This event is a major milestone for the Afrikaans language movement, which had been propagated by dr. D.F. Malan since the beginning of this century."
 saf.187.a: "Hier praat ons Afrikaans!"

 saf.190.t: "Safeguarding Portuguese East Africa?"
 saf.190.d: "Disaster has struck the Portuguese: mainland Portugal has been overrun and their overseas empire is crumbling as opportunistic actors attempt to poach their possessions in both Africa and Asia. One of those possessions is right next on our border: Portuguese Mozambique. Its ports fulfil a vital export role for our industrial base and most of it is commonly included in the concept of Greater Rhodesia. Possibly, the Germans might be plotting to take colony which would increase its leverage over us.\n\nHawks are urging us to act first by ordering our army to cross the Mozambican border, so as to ensure that Rhodesia's interests are secured, and some of them are probably hoping we will annex the colony outright in the future. On the other hand, doves reject this course of action and point out that this would force Rhodesia to take international responsibility for the Mozambicans henceforth, and unnecessarily inflames tensions with the Germans and Portuguese."
 saf.190.a: "Order the army to move for Lourenço Marques!"
 saf.190.b: "More natives in Rhodesia? I think not!"

 saf.191.t: "Rhodesia Moves into Mozambique"
 saf.191.d: "The ramble that's call the Rhodesian army has crossed the Rhodesian-Mozambican border into Mozambique. While it is ostensibly to protect the population and prevent a hostile takeover from a third power, it cannot be overlooked that Rhodesian has had ambitions to turn the Zambezi into its ‘natural border' and it is highly doubtful they will be inclined to return it at a later point."
 saf.191.a: "Rhodes that desgraçado strikes again!"

 saf.192.t: "Rhodesia Moves into Mozambique"
 saf.192.d: "It appears the newly independent Rhodesia has crossed the Rhodesian-Mozambican border into Mozambique. According to Salisbury it is with the goal to protect the local population and to prevent a so-called ‘third power', which is almost certainly to mean us, from occupying the colony. The part of Mozambique north of the Zambezi River is much closer to our domains than to Rhodesia however, and if we move at once we can secure them before the Rhodesians, who given that their nation exist is due to ambitious Cecil Rhodes, will no doubt want to expand into the whole of Mozambique."

Now the de-facto border splits Mozambique in half, following the Zambezi River. Their reaction has certainly legitimised our takeover. Had we not done this they would almost certainly have occupied all of Mozambique."
 saf.193.a: "The Zambezi will have to do for a border."

 saf.200.t: "The Homecoming has Started"
 saf.200.d: "The day has come: the British government-in-exile, to whose empire we, at least theoretically, belong, has started its operation to retake the British home isles from the syndicalist menace.\n\nThe Fusion government supports the participation wholeheartedly, albeit that the wings of the party belonging to Jan Smuts and James Hertzog do so for different reasons:\n\nFor Smuts and his supporters, supporting the Canadian monarchy to return to its home isles is a duty South Africa owes to it and necessary in defence of freedom and democracy.\n\nThe Hertzogites in the United Party as well as even the Gesuiwerdes of dr. D.F. Malan do not feel such an obligation, but they do see the syndicalists with their calls of world revolution and support for majority rule in South Africa as a mortal threat to the Afrikaner nation. The cabinet votes:"
 saf.200.a: "Eleven votes to zero for war!"

 saf.201.t: "The Passing of General Hertzog"
 saf.201.d: "The right honourable General James Barry Munnik Hertzog has passed away in his family home today. The death of the Boer general of German heritage from the Orange Free State, sitting prime minister and co-founder of the United Party as well as founder of the preceding National Party marks a turning point in South African history, calling in a final end to the mended rivalry between the politicians from Transvaal and Orange Free State which defined the South African political scene since the formation of the union.\n\nAs preparations for the funeral are underway, the United Party needs to decide who shall become their new party leader and thus the new prime minister. It is widely known that Hertzog favoured his protégé within the more moderate faction within the National Party, Nicolaas Havenga. However, he is being contested by the two wings that formerly made up the South African Party: on the one hand Hertzog's old rival general and former prime minister Jan Smuts is widely expected to be the frontrunner, having been instrumental in keeping the party together thus far from his position of pragmatic conservatism. His much younger and more liberal protégé Jan Hendrik Hofmeyr similarly vies for the position, promising a radical reversal of course of the United Party."
 saf.201.a: "Havenga wins the contest with Hertzog's support base."
 saf.201.b: "Smuts' prestige wins him the day."
 saf.201.c: "The party membership favours Hofmeyr."

 saf.202.t: "The Disunited Party"
 saf.202.d: "Liberals had been less than content with the path of the United Party since its inception, but given that the party was made up of the South African Party, both its liberal and its conservative members, and the Nationalists, few had expected that J.H. Hofmeyr's longshot run to turn the policy of the party around would have had any chance of success. Instead those who had previously been supporters of the South African Party rallied around Hofmeyr, leaving the pragmatic compromises supported by General Smuts with little support and outclassing Havenga and his nationalists.\n\nUnsurprisingly however, Havenga and his nationalists are not particularly pleased with this turn of events, with the party's direction sharply moving to the left. As a result Havenga and his supporters have decried this new direction of the party and crossed the aisle to join the opposition as the Afrikaner Party. A larger amount of Hertzog-aligned MPs even defected to dr. Malan's Purified Nationalists.\n\nThrough these events, the comfortable majority of the United Party of more than 100 MPs has been reduced to 80, although this is still sufficient for a majority. Even more worryingly, the prospects of the Afrikaner Nationalists in 1943 seem to have been augmented substantially."
 saf.202.a: "We shall defeat them once again at the ballot box!"

 saf.203.t: "The Disunited Party"
 saf.203.d: "Discontent among the Liberal wing of the United Party has existed for a long time since Jan Smuts decided to work with his Free State rival. However, with the election of Nicolaas Havenga as the new leader of the United Party they have finally had enough: nine members of parliament for the United Party led Jan Hendrik Hofmeyr, have joined the opposition.\n\nAccording to Hofmeyr, the UP is no longer an adequate vehicle for the voice of liberalism in South Africa now that Hertzog has been succeeded by Havenga, similarly an Afrikaner nationalist. The new party, called the 'Liberal Party of South Africa' in English and the 'Liberale Party van Suid-Afrika' in Afrikaans, has publicised an ambitious and uncompromissory programme. This includes the relaxation of the pass system, bringing education of non-whites to the white level, having the native community be represented by a minister of their own colour and most controversially, instituting nationwide qualified franchise based on the historical system that was in place on the Cape since the 19th century, which would enfranchise tens of thousands of 'Coloured', Indian and native voters, a group that would be expected to increase with time.\n\nThe nine MPs have expressed their intention to make liberalism triumph against both their former United Party as well as the Purified Nationalists in 1943.\n\nSince United won over 100 seats in 1938, the split does not endanger the stability of the United Party government, but the announcement has fueled speculation that this development may be the death-knell to United's chances in the upcoming elections."
 saf.203.a: "Such sour losers!"

 saf.204.t: "[GetYear] General Elections"
 saf.204.d: "The Volksraad's term is up and South Africans go to the polls once more. That is to say, white South Africans go to the polls, although in the Cape Province and Southern Rhodesia, they are joined by members of the non-white elite, provided they adhere to certain property qualifications.\n\nUnlike 1938, this election is hotly contested, curiously by three parties, which is not usually the case in a first past the post system. Nicolaas Havenga leads what is left of the fusionist United Party, containing both moderate Hertzogites and moderate Smuts-supporters. He is being contested from both the left and the right by J.H. Hofmeyr's Liberal Party of South Africa, which has recently split from the United Party, and D.F. Malan's Purified National Party, which has taken on the role of official opposition in the past five years.\n\nMuch will depend on the performance of Hofmeyr's Liberal Party of South Africa: if their performance turns out to be abysmal, it is likely that the moderation of the United Party will pull through, but if they eat significantly into the UP's support base, then that is likely to split the English and liberal Afrikaner vote to the benefit of the Purified National Party. Then, there is a small chance that the relative similarities between Malan and Havenga end up splitting the Afrikaner nationalist vote instead while the SAP base largely consolidates around the Liberals, which might lead to a hung parliament where the Liberals come out on top. This election may determine South Africa's future."
 saf.204.a: "The United Party wins a narrow majority."
 saf.204.b: "Liberal vote-splitting nets the PNP a decisive mandate."
 saf.204.c: "The Liberals devastate the UP without giving way to the PNP."

 saf.205.t: "[GetYear] General Elections"

That is to say, white South Africans go to the polls, although in the Cape Province and Southern Rhodesia, they are joined by members of the non-white elite, provided they adhere to certain property qualifications.\n\nAs in 1938, the former National and South African Parties are conjoined in the single United Party, which against all odds has managed to persist the whole term. Because of this, most people expect the United Party to once again carry through a victory, but it is clear that the popularity of the Purified National Party has grown substantially since 1938 as disaffected Afrikaners have defected to them."
 saf.205.a: "The United Party wins comfortably."
 saf.205.b: "The Purified National Party clinches a narrow majority"

 saf.206.t: "[GetYear] General Elections"

That is to say, white South Africans go to the polls, although in the Cape Province and Southern Rhodesia, they are joined by members of the non-white elite, provided they adhere to certain property qualifications.\n\nAs in 1938, the former National and South African Parties are conjoined in the single United Party, and although several members  split and formed the Afrikaner Party under the leadership of Nicolaas Havenga in opposition, it still managed to persist the whole term. Because of this, most people expect the United Party to once again carry through a victory, but it is clear that the popularity of the Purified National Party has grown substantially since 1938 as disaffected Afrikaners have defected to them."
 saf.206.a: "The United Party is once again victorious."
 saf.206.b: "The Purified National Party wins a narrow majority."

 saf.207.t: "Finding a Majority"
 saf.207.d: "One year ago, this had seemed inconceivable: with 68 MPs, the brand new Liberal Party of South Africa has in one go become the single largest party of South Africa.\n\nThe electorate has clearly appreciated the ambitious and forward-thinking party programme. Some Nationalist press already laments that the white South African electorate doomed itself by voting for us. Meanwhile dr. Malan has already stated that he will do anything within his power as official opposition to prevent us from liberalising the country.\n\nThis threat is not entirely unfounded: as the Liberal Party did not win an outright majority, we will need a coalition partner. What would be the most impactful of our proposed policies, the institution of a Qualified Enfranchisement for all races throughout the country, must therefore be postponed, because it cannot achieve a majority in parliament. In response, Hofmeyr has dug up the old draft of the Coloured Enfranchisement Act, dating from our United Party days, which was meant to convince more conservative MPs from the party to get along. We have hope that we can pass this act, but we will need a workable majority nonetheless.\n\nFrom the Purifieds we need not expect much, they strongly oppose all our plans. The same is true with the Dominionists. Therefore we have two options: one is the Labour Party of South Africa: they are open to extending franchise, but don't want qualified franchise, as they rely on lower class voters who would actually lose the right to vote under this plan. It would also entail taking a more progressive approach to economics. Alternatively, we could ally with the remains of the United Party. Their conservative wing (which is now their whole party) will not let us pass a Qualified Enfranchisement Act either, but the support they enjoy among the 'Coloured' community may be sufficient to get them on board with an act enfranchising them, if enough concessions are offered."
 saf.207.a: "We shall work with Labour!"
 saf.207.b: "The United Party are our natural partners!"

 saf.208.t: "The Showing of the LPSA"
 saf.208.d: "The election has been a massive disappointment for the new Liberal Party of South Africa: beforehand some had dreamed of besting both their former party comrades in the United Party and the Purified National Party. As it turns out, the party programme had been too ambitious for our time: moderates were turned off by it and committed liberals, sensing the situation, have proven to be unwilling to risk Purified National coming to power by voting Liberal.\n\nAs a result of this, of the nine parliamentarians that defected from the UP, eight have lost their seat to either the challengers nominated by United, to the Dominion Party, or, in one case, to Purified National. This includes Jan Hendrik Hofmeyr's own seat of Johannesburg North. Given the narrow margins in the remaining seat, Salt River where Henry Lawrence was elected and Helen Suzman's lone Liberal pickup of the constituency of Houghton, there is not even a risk-free avenue to bring Hofmeyr back into parliament.\n\nAlthough the results have disheartened the liberals, Hofmeyr has redefined his party's job for the upcoming five years to convincing the white electorate of the need for liberal reform from the opposition to hopefully make for a better result in 1948. However, with this result it is likely that the Liberal Party will prove at most a minor party with a small but dedicated following between the larger Purified National and United Parties who could at best win themselves a kingmaker position, and its ambitious agenda will not see implementation in the foreseeable future."
 saf.208.a: "In a future hung parliament, cooperation is still conceivable."

 saf.209.t: "The Showing of the LPSA"
 saf.209.d: "In raw numbers, this election is perhaps not that disappointing. The Liberal Party of South Africa picked up 13 seats, increasing their parliamentary delegation to a decent 22 seats. Unfortunately the cost has been great: many competitive seats suffered from vote splitting and consequently went to Purified National, growing their delegation into a healthy majority. As a result, despite the fact that anti-segregationism now has a solid voice in parliament, dr. Malan's hardliners are now expected to push through their Afrikaner Nationalist and Apartheid policies with only a third of popular vote and there is nothing the Liberal Party can do against it, even if they can cooperate with the United and Labour Parties. Already, voices within the Liberal Party are calling for merging back into the United Party so the anti-Malan voices stand a fighting chance in the next election."
 saf.209.a: "With our victory, they do not matter!"

 saf.210.t: "[GetYear] General Elections"
 saf.210.d: "The term of the current Volksraad has run out and those South Africans on the common rolls - primarily whites, although Coloureds are on it now as well - are going to the polls today to vote for the representative of their constituency, which will determine the makeup of the South African government for the coming five years, unless earlier elections are called of course.\n\nThe popularity of the Liberal-Labour coalition remains unshaken, thanks in no small part to the Coloured Enfranchisement Act, which was pushed through the Volksraad without a compromise under the leadership of the Liberal Party. Many are predicting a majority victory for the party led by Jan Hendrik Hofmeyr, but observers believe it is safe to say that Labour will not give up the electoral contest without a fight, though they are unlikely to win enough seats in the Volksraad.\n\nSeveral newspapers have pointed out that, looking back at the last election, these predictions sound quite extraordinary and perhaps nothing is more indicative of how much has changed in the political landscape in the last five years than the United Party remnants being pushed into the opposition, joining the PNP and other smaller parties."
 saf.210.a: "A landslide victory for the Liberal Party!"

 saf.211.t: "The Qualified Franchise Act"
 saf.211.d: "Today the Volksraad has finally passed the Qualified Franchise Act which allows people to vote in the elections regardless of race, if they meet certain income requirements and pay the sufficient taxes. In its form, the Act is essentially an extension of the Cape Qualified Franchise to the whole of the Union, which traces its roots back to 1853 when the Cape Colony elected its first parliament.\n\nNeedless to say, the [getGesuiwerdeOrNatShort] opposition heavily criticised the draft, decried it as a dangerous erosion of white political power and a concession to the interests of non-white groups. The example of a few white poor working class voters who have lost their right to vote because of the Act was pointed out vehemently, conveniently forgetting about a number of 'coloured' and asiatic voters who will also be ineligible to vote due to the financial criteria of the legislation. However, their numbers are only a low proportion of the voting age population, and now that the Qualified Franchise is enforced throughout the union, it finally gives everyone the right to vote on equal terms. Though as fair as it may sound, in [GetYear] the electorate is still dominated by the white voters as they are the wealthiest group with the most individuals who fulfil the wealth requirements.\n\nNevertheless, the liberalisation of South African politics that has begun in recent years has reached another important milestone which the Afrikaner Nationalist opposition, now reduced to irrelevancy, has been powerless to stop."
 saf.211.a: "Interesting."

 saf.212.t: "End of Fusion"
 saf.212.d: "Twice in a single decade, the catastrophe of a world war has fallen upon us, as the now restored British government, to whose empire we, at least theoretically, belong, has become embroiled in another continental war in Europe.\n\nThis turn of events has put a heavy burden on the coalition government, more specifically on the United Party, because its two prominent leading members, Havenga and Smuts disagree on South Africa's role in this conflict. Havenga believes that no South Africans should die in what is strictly a European conflict, and that unreservedly joining the side of the British would hurt Afrikaner-British relations here in South Africa. Instead he propagates armed neutrality, remaining out of the war unless our interests are directly threatened.\n\nSmuts on the other hand, wants South Africa to partake in the Weltkrieg directly, arguing that South Africa has this moral obligation towards the British Empire, as its dominion and to make up for the protection the country is afforded within its framework.\n\nWith no compromise can seemingly be found, Havenga and his supporters have left the United Party and formed their own 'Volksparty' - People's Party - with which they will join the opposition with the Purified National Party of dr. Malan, with whom they have already started talks about reuniting the old National Party.\n\nIt looks like the Third Weltkrieg was the last nail in the United's coffin and now fusion is officially over. With this development the government has lost its majority in the Volksraad and now the Liberal Party and prime minister Jan Hendryk Hofmeyr is in a very precarious situation."

Despite some fierce, but uneffective resistance from the more British-friendly voices in the parliament, especially general Smuts, thanks to the governments majority the motion was swiflty passed through the Volksraad, affirming that South Africa would remain neutral in the coming conflict."

 saf.216.t: "Liberal-Labour Government"
 saf.216.d: "In the course of several days of coalition talks stretching into the night, an agreement was reached with Labour, much to the relief of the Liberal Party. Walter Madeley's party have proved to be unusually ready to compromise in the negotiations, probably cause they also do not want to see Malan's Purified Nationalist Party in government, as that would certainly have dire consequences in the politics of the Union of South Africa and for the non-white population. In addition to Labour, the some of the more liberal-leaning representatives of the ailing United Party have also joined us, and with them we unquestionably gained our majority back in the Volksraad.\n\nObviously, this series of events is not at all to the liking of the Afrikaner Nationalist opposition who claim that liberalisation of the country and joining the Third Weltkrieg on the side of the Entente will most certainly bring South Africa to ruin."

That is to say, white South Africans go to the polls, although in the Cape Province and Southern Rhodesia, they are joined by members of the non-white elite, provided they adhere to certain property qualifications. One of the important issues of this election is South Africa's neutrality in the Third Weltkrieg: an Afrikaner nationalist coalition of the Volksparty and Purified National Party are vehemently campaigning on the basis that no South Africans should die in the fields of Europe anymore, while the Liberal Party preaches a moral obligation to help out our British and Entente allies in this coming conflict."

 saf.321.t: "Stellenbosch or Witwatersrand?"
 saf.321.d: "While, in other countries, a proposal to extend state grants to universities might be considered an uncontroversial act, South Africa has never been like other countries. The debate that has appeared in the Volksraad is not one as to whether grants should be extended at all - on that, both the government and the opposition benches are in broad agreement, the merits of a stronger university system being apparent to most. Instead, the controversy concerns which university these grants would go to, and in many ways reflect the main political divide of the day.\n\nNational has been universally insisting that the lion's share of the funding go towards the 'Universiteit Stellenbosch', or the Stellenbosch University. Alongside the University of Cape Town, Stellensbosch is the oldest university in sub-Saharan Africa, both institutions being granted full status on the same day in 1918.As such, it carries a level of prestige that is hard to match elsewhere in the country, and is certainly the highest profile one in South Africa. It also teaches almost exclusively in Afrikaans, and is something of an intellectual hub for the National Party. Many National members got their degrees from Stellenbosch, and the university is a symbol of pride for many more educated - and more nationalist-minded - Boers.\n\nMeanwhile, the SAP has been expressing a desire to favour the University of Witwatersrand instead. Although certainly not as classic as the Cape Town and Stellenbosch Universities, the University of Witwatersrand is certainly a unique institution. Founded by the SAP's liberal deputy J.H Hofmeyr, Witwatersrand has gone in a substantially more innovative and progressive direction - Hofmeyr's stance as an educator is that universities should be open to all, and under his influence Witwatersrand has become a mixed-race institution, and has been closely associated with Hofmeyr's SAP.\n\nWith National representatives arguing that the money should go to an established and distinctly South African institution in Stellenbosch, and most - though not all - SAP representatives being more partial to funding the less developed Witwatersrand, the government must decide which way to push."

 saf.400.t: "The Provisional Revolutionary Government"
 saf.400.d: "In order to undertake the monumental task of guiding South Africa out of the shadow of imperialism and capitalist exploitation, representatives from the ICU, the ISL, the SATLC, the Madeley faction of the Labour Party and the ANC, along with a handful of other ideologically permissible political and labour organisations have convened to form a provisional government. Though this new government of 'national unity between all workers of all creeds and colours' is dominated by the SATLC and the Madeley faction, it is the very first political representation that black, native Africans have ever had in our country, even if their representation in the new socialist republic is nowhere close to proportionate to their population. William Henry 'Bill' Andrews has been named as Chairman and the new head of state, in a position modelled after the Union of Britain's government structure. Walter Madeley has been appointed as Prime Minister, though the exact powers this position will hold in the immediate future is up for debate. Madeley's prior role as Minister of Employment and Labour in the Hertzog government of 1924 and his claim to be Chairman of the Labour Party of South Africa makes him a perfect man to act as a symbol of legitimacy and to preside over the abolishment of the old colonial government in favour of the new revolutionary one. It is likely that once the situation has stabilised in South Africa, it will fall on the deputy-Chairman, currently James 'Jimmy' Briggs, to take over as formal head of government. Chairman Andrews has sworn that he will call together all the factions of the South African left to a legislative conference, to address the challenges of the future. Chief among them is the declaration of hostilities with the Entente powers, who have rallied behind deposed prime minister Smuts and the exiled governor Villiers, in hope of once more chaining South Africa and its people to capitalist rule. There is also the chaotic domestic situation to address, such as the desperate need to form a new constitution for the socialist republic and to confront national problems like racial inequality, pass laws, lack of democratic representation and economic restructuring."
 saf.400.a: "We must not tarry."

 saf.401.t: "Preparing for the Johannesburg Convention"
 saf.401.d: "As we cement our control over the country and the Johannesburg Convention opens its doors, there is an immediate issue that must be resolved. What power should the Provisional Government be allowed to hold, for the remainder of the revolution's infancy? Many representatives to the Convention are in favour of empowering the Chairman and the government, to ensure the socialist revolution will not be smothered in its cradle, but others fear that consolidating power and building a political bureaucracy around the executive branch will point our new nation down the path of authoritarianism, citing the examples of the Mann Government in Britain and political disputes that permeate the Commune of France. There is another angle to this as well, which is the racial politics of South Africa. The current government is almost exclusively white, and derives its support from the white working class and the white unions of the SATLC. There is a blatant incentives for these privileged labourers and socialist leaders to work to maintain their current status on the racial hierarchy, instead of helping to usher in a new age of racial equality, or at least that is how many dissident black and coloured intellectuals have chosen to frame Chairman Andrews' rise to power. The ICU, with ambivalent support from the ISL, have thus suggested the creation of a 'Transitional Revolutionary Council' that will check the balance of power of the executive branch, until a formal legislature has been convened. This Council will consist of a set of representatives from every racial group and will be directly elected from the constituent members of the revolutionary coalition on the basis of equal representation for each racial group, rather than just being SATLC members slotted into the new state bureaucracy. Andrews is ambivalent on the matter however, fearing that the Council could end up doing more harm than good and preventing the socialist republic from making the right, if tough choices it needs to take in this critical moment."
 saf.401.a: "We will form the Transitional Council, to guarantee the multi-racial coalition's future."
 saf.401.b: "Reject the proposal, we cannot allow excessive bureaucracy to wreak doubt and delay."

 saf.402.t: "Chairman Andrews Proposes 'Parallel Unionism'"
 saf.402.d: "The concept of 'parallel unions' have emerged as a hegemonic buzzword in the post-revolutionary political climate. Initially proposed by white socialists, such as Chairman Andrews, who tried to find a way to reconcile the legal and cultural segregation between black and white labourers within Great Depression era South Africa with the necessity of labour organising, a parallel union is a labour union that is explicitly for blacks and coloureds, operating alongside an exclusively white union at the same workplace. Instead of furthering racial tension by forcefully desegregating workplaces, parallel unions would allow two separate workforces to organise independently of one another, but both be supported by government recognition and by the local supervisory trade union federation. Critics of the policy have noted that it perpetuates the racial separation that the capitalist-imperialists enforced upon us, and that black and coloured unions will be at a natural disadvantage compared to white unions, who are far better organised and have had more time to consolidate their role in the labour movement. There is also an issue that has naturally been raised of what would happen if white and black labourers came into conflict with one another over matters of unequal pay, working hours or treatment at a workplace. Similar problems could arise if there are disputes over pensions, strike funds and sick-pay, where one branch of the parallel unions may end up holding a disproportionate amount of influence over a shared set of coffers. Supporters of parallel unionism have framed it as merely the first step in 'guiding' the revolution and the rest of the labour movement down a more radical path, where we may one day usher in a fair, multiracial society, but emphasising that this is a crop that only future generations will harvest. They've also noted that criticism of the parallel unions is disproportionately made by black intellectuals and union organisers who would be relatively unaffected in their current, comfortable positions, whereas the actual black workers, particularly rural ones, would benefit from gaining formal experience with organising into unions. The SATLC has almost universally thrown their weight behind Andrews' proposal, while the ICU and the ISL have scrambled to organise an opposition, imploring Andrews to reconsider such a controversial suggestion. It remains to be seen if the proposal can pass the factional politics as well as the checks and balances of the convention."
 saf.402.a: "The Transitional Revolutionary Council vetoes the proposal!"
 saf.402.b: "The proposal is deemed too controversial, and subsequently retracted."
 saf.402.c: "The proposal will be brought to a vote!"

 saf.403.t: "The Opening of the Johannesburg Convention"
 saf.403.d: "The Johannesburg Convention has opened. South Africa's old government is no more and in its place, a true revolutionary government of the people stands ready to reshape the future of the nation. With the initial tensions in the lead-up to the convention calmed, various delegates from political and labour groups throughout South Africa, representing a wide array of ethnic groups, have had the chance to assemble in Milner Park, where local buildings have rapidly been reshaped into public assemblies, meeting chambers and lodgings for the arriving delegates. The sole missing piece is Clements Kadalie, the official head of the ICU, who is still en route from Paris but expected to arrive within the next few days. The incumbent provisional government under Chairman Andrews' has already promoted several drafts for a constitution, modelled primarily on the Union of Britain, but also with influence from the French model and other socialist nations.\n\nIt remains to be seen if the factionalism that threatened the convention's start will continue to loom over it like a Sword of Damocles, as the SATLC and the Labour Party have already begun to consolidate their influence, but a powerful political bloc is also emerging between the ISL, ICU who have opened up talks with the ANC and the Indian National Congress of South Africa. Chairman Andrews, who is both a member of the ISL and ostensibly the leader of the SATLC, has begun to favour the former of the two after being pressured to rescind his proposal for 'parallel unions'. The ISL and ICU are not wholly on the same page however about a number of policies, so the future of South Africa, along with the question what constitution and government will be established remains difficult to determine."
 saf.403.a: "Let the debates begin!"

 saf.404.t: "Clements Kadalie Returns from Exile!"
 saf.404.d: "Originally from Nyasaland, Clements Kadalie was South Africa's first black national trade union organiser and the founder of the Industrial and Commercial Worker's Union in 1919, which has grown to be the largest native rights organisation, active as far north as Zambesia. With its influence, the union also played a crucial role in the success of the South African revolution.\n\nIn 1924, the South African government had deported Kadalie, who left for London just in time to play a role in the revolution there. Ever since, Kadalie has acted as the representative of the South African syndicalist movement in London and Paris. Now that the bourgeois government of South Africa has been torn down, the influential politician has returned to South Africa to mark his presence in post-revolutionary politics. When his ship arrived in Cape Town he received a hero's welcome by a crowd waiting for him."
 saf.404.a: "Good to have you back, comrade!"

 saf.405.t: "The Legislative Branch"
 saf.405.d: "The first political clashes have emerged at the Constitution, with delegates debating the merits of two different approaches to our Legislature. As both the South African left and to a lesser extent the native and asiatic population has always been reliant on trade unions to make their voices heard, we naturally chose to follow the Syndicalist model of a trade union democracy, where the legislators are elected as delegates from different unions on a geographic basis. This will serve as the legislature's upper house and has been dubbed the 'South African Trade Union Congress'. Yet the vast majority of our people are not registered under a union and would thus struggle to gain democratic representation. As such, we have also agreed to form a lower house of the legislature dubbed the South African People's Parliament, combining both the Senate and the House of Assembly of the old Union Parliament. This has been explicitly framed as a provisional decision, mimicking the compromise that the Syndicalists in Britain made with their moderate compatriots, forming a Provincial Parliament that several years later was abolished by government decree once the Union of Britain was deemed to have been sufficiently socialised.\n\nThe ICU wants to promote this as an official part of the Constitution, although with the vague enough language that the existence of the People's Parliament can be drawn out for however long it is deemed necessary to exist. The ISL and ethnic political parties reject this idea, believing that we need to build a permanent democratic institution to represent those who are not part of unions and who may not be able to adapt to a Syndicalist political framework. The SATLC are split, as it and the Labour Party are deeply interwoven with the trade union movement and can easily make the transition to a Syndicalist democracy, but many members fear the ICU is moving too far and too fast to pursue an idealistic vision of an all-encompassing trade union movement."
 saf.405.a: "The Constitution shall enshrine the People's Parliament as a permanent institution."
 saf.405.b: "The Constitution shall recognise that the People's Parliament is a temporary measure."

 saf.406.t: "The Judicial Branch"
 saf.406.d: "Another clash has started over the judicial branch: the SATLC wants a single and colour-blind judicial system for all South Africans, regardless of the circumstances of the crime, but no right to object to who judges you based on the colour of their skin. In effect, because almost exclusively whites have been educated in the law, this means the old judicial system will likely be mostly preserved, and as the system creates no pressure to educate new non-white lawyers, justice will be carried out almost exclusively by whites for the foreseeable future.\n\nThis reality has been noticed by the African National Congress, who instead want it constitutionally entrenched that each racial group in the federation will have the right to be judged by their own ethnicity if they so desire in a case against the government, and a judge not held to the ethnicity of either side in a civil case."
 saf.406.a: "We don't have the manpower at present to accommodate for that right!"
 saf.406.b: "This right is the only way to definitively prevent racial prejudice in the justice system!"

 saf.407.t: "The Role of the Prime Minister"
 saf.407.d: "The battle over what parts of our nascent political system should be codified as rule of law, and which should be done away with and treated as ephemeral compromises continues to rage. Focus has shifted on the position of Prime Minister, currently held by Walter Madeley in the Provisional Revolutionary Government. We initially chose to maintain this old institution mostly to guarantee legitimacy in those first few days following the Second Rand Revolt, with the hope that Madeley's charisma could help win us more recognition from progressives in the South Africa party and maybe even some defections from pragmatic parts of the National Party. The ISL and Madeley himself, along with his faction of the Labour party, are quite fond of the position and believe the Prime Ministership should be retained as a representative of the government to the People's Parliament, introducing legislation and ensuring open dialogue between the executive and the lower house of the legislative branch. They also claim it prevents power from being concentrated in the hands of the Chairman and the deputy-Chairman, with these arguments all-but openly referencing the rise of Oswald Mosley in the Union of Britain as a dire example to be avoided.\n\nThe ICU are very sceptical of the proposal, however, believing it will weaken the revolution and retain too much of the old bourgeois political system at a time when we must move forward towards a new syndicalist society. They have noted that the new Legislature and Judiciary are plenty enough to provide checks and balances on the Executive, without tying us up in red tape and increased bureaucratisation. As such, the ICU has called on the convention to abolish the position of Prime Minister. In some way, this is also a referendum on comrade Madeley's own appeal, as he has made it clear he wishes to hold onto the role of Prime Minister and likely has the necessary votes to do so. If his position is abolished, he will likely be offered a new administrative position somewhere else, owing to the Labour Party's contributions to the revolution."
 saf.407.a: "The Prime Minister shall be retained as a representative to the legislature!"
 saf.407.b: "The Prime Ministership shall be abolished in favour of the Chairman and deputy-Chairman!"

 saf.408.t: "The ISL Consolidates Support"
 saf.408.d: "As the Johannesburg Convention draws to a close, it has become clear that the delegates favour the ISL's arguments and political proposals. Following tense, but amicable negotiations with the ICU, it has been agreed that in order to preserve the unity of the revolution the ISL will continue to serve as the face of the South African left, holding onto formal political power, whilst the ICU will work in coalition with them to organise the labour movement and support the government's initiatives. Quite surprisingly, Chairman Andrews as well as deputy-Chairman Briggs have declined to remain in their positions. While this has ostensibly been to emphasise the 'Provisional' part of the Provisional Revolutionary Government, it also seems quite obvious that Andrews has been politically humiliated by his failure to secure parallel unionism, and that old Briggs has no real political footing to stand on without his colleague, as the Labour party rallies around Madeley. Andrews privately opined though that he hoped black and coloured leaders may now have a chance to gain prevalence without being stifled by the dominant, white leadership of the South African left. Ultimately, no popular consensus could be formed over who should take over as Chairman, even with some votes being cast for the Black candidates such as the former ANC president J.T. Gumede, as well as the young revolutionary hero Moses Kotane.\n\nIn lieu of their attempts to garner support, a compromise candidate was eventually reached in the form of David Ivon Jones, the former secretary of the ISL and a notable Unitarian minister who has a long and storied history of uplifting South African natives in his political crusade. Jones has fought to have the Coloured trade unionist John Stephen 'Johnny' Gomas confirmed as deputy Chairman, along with nominating Moses Kotane as his Minister of Defence, owing to the young comrade's exemplary conduct during the Second Rand Revolt. As Jones has hinted he may not serve long as the Chairman, owing to his age and sickliness, it seems obvious that he may be setting up Kotane as his future successor. Despite this, Jones has also made it clear that he is not just taking over the role of the Chairman of the People's Union of South Africa, he will serve with the full distinction of the legal head of state, doing his utmost to protect the rights of the people and the workers!"
 saf.408.a: "Workers of the world, unite!"

 saf.409.t: "The ICU Consolidates Support"
 saf.409.d: "As the Johannesburg Convention draws to a close, it has become clear that the delegates favour the ICU's arguments and political proposals. Clement Kadalie and James La Guma's charm offensive has won both the hearts and minds of the candidates, promising to build a rainbow coalition that can make the voice of every South African heard, no matter his or her social position or ethnic background. It has even won over several leaders of the SATLC, in no small part due to the effort of white ICU trade unionists such as Solomon Sachs and William George Ballinger, as well as the fact that the SATLC is eager to expand its own influence in a syndicalist society. Though the SATLC will never subordinate itself to the ICU, it will participate as a coalition partner and some of its affiliated unions have also opened negotiations with ICU affiliates over closer cooperation in their respective professions. This has also come with the unfortunate consequence of several of the more racially motivated SATLC affiliates abandoning the trade union federation, as they fear their own influence will be marginalised if black, coloureds and Asiatics gain greater sway over South African politics. As these traitors begin to scamper back to Creswell, with their tail between their legs, the rest of the labour movement has celebrated the bright new future of our People's Union. The ISL and ANC have both given us their approval in forming a government, though it has become clear that party politics will be eschewed in favour of a true syndicalist system, in the spirit of the Union of Britain. Clements Kadalie, despite his many controversies and his absence from South Africa for over a decade, is easily the most qualified and popular man who could fill the role of Chairman. After a vote by the convention, Provisional Chairman Andrews oversaw a smooth transfer of power to the legendary black trade unionist.\n\nAs his deputy-Chairman, Kadalie chose Emil Solomon 'Solly' Sachs, a white, Jewish trade unionist that rose to prominence by almost single handedly organising the garment workers industry. The rest of the Kadalie administration appears to be built on a careful mixture of compromise and commitment, with raw revolutionary zeal serving as the glue to hold those compromises together. Political organisations like the ANC and ISL will still have a voice in government, but they must contend with the voices of the masses as well, making themselves heard through the new syndicalist political system."
 saf.409.a: "Workers of the world, unite!"

 saf.410.t: "SATLC Rushes the Vote on 'Parallel Unionism'"
 saf.410.d: "Almost as soon as the ink had dried on Chairman Andrews' proposal to implement 'parallel unions' as part of our revolutionary social and economic reconstruction of South Africa, leading members of the SATLC's affiliated constituents rushed to put it to a vote, despite objections from the ISL and the ICU that several of their own delegates, notably the political exile Clement Kadalie, had not even had a chance to assemble in Johannesburg yet. This eager clique of SATLC leaders blamed the matter on the ICU's disorganised nature and tried to highlight it as another argument for the benefits of parallel unionism, noting repeatedly that the revolution could not delay and dally while the imperialists stood at our door. Criticism was immediately launched by the Johannesburg chapter of the ISL, accusing the SATLC faction of trying to hijack the revolution, going on to make an appeal to Chairman Andrews to delay the vote. Despite the Chairman repeatedly claiming that the convention will not proceed until representatives from black political and labour groups have assembled, the disgruntled SATLC faction have apparently chosen to gather and make several 'informal' votes on the new policy, beginning to draft directives and amendments that while framed as just being 'intellectual exercises' and 'public debates', clearly portend an attempt to establish a system of dual power inside Johannesburg. Though initially invited to take part in these 'debates', the Johannesburg chapter of the ISL has now chosen to boycott them, with claims that the topics at the meetings were presented as being about the future of 'White South Africa'. A representative of the SATLC faction has denied these accusations, claiming that the ISL took a particular conversation subject out of its proper context."
 saf.410.a: "Now, just wait a damn minute..."

 saf.411.t: "The Constitutional Advisory Committee"
 saf.411.d: "Tensions continue to escalate in Johannesburg, as a rogue faction of the SATLC has begun to work towards excluding the more pan-racial and syndicalist aligned ICU and ISL members from joining the Constitutional Convention. One of the SATLC's public meetings has recently drafted a proposal for a 'Constitutional Advisory Committee' that should hold supervisory influence over the convention and over the future of our South Africa's constitutional framework, with the proposal favouring election to this Committee based on proportional representation from the currently legally recognised unions. As one might expect, this naturally favours the SATLC and very explicitly favours white workers as well as white union leaders, guaranteeing both the SATLC as an institution and this racial demographic in South Africa effective veto power over the future of the socialist republic. What's even worse is that this idea has begun to win over several moderates, despite Chairman Andrews' repeated urging for the provocative suggestions to be halted and for the SATLC to fall in line behind the current Provisional Revolutionary Government. Whether it be out of genuine racist malice, or simply grabs for power, a lot of erstwhile trade union veterans have affixed their name to the proposal for the Advisory Committee, urging the Chairman to consider establishing this group of 'skilled administrators' who can facilitate the transition towards a socialist society. A draft list of potential nominees to the Advisory Committee was delivered to Andrew's desk, and contained two somewhat startling but not unexpected facts. First, the membership nominated is exclusively white, with some hubbub being raised that it is also almost uniformly White Anglo Saxons, with little representation for the Eastern European and Jewish leaders within the labour movement, many of whom have thrown their lot in with the ICU and ISL. Secondly, neither Chairman Andrews or deputy-Chairman Briggs' names are on the list, a subtle threat that the rogue faction of the SATLC may not consider the Provisional Government a necessary part of their own ambitions for South Africa. Though Andrews has refused to sign the proposal and begun to take action towards stopping this inter-factional coup, the time is ticking in Johannesburg..."
 saf.411.a: "What?!"

 saf.412.t: "SATLC Protocols Leaked!"
 saf.412.d: "The curtains appear to have opened on the last act of the political circus in Johannesburg, as local ISL members have leaked what they claim to be a protocol from one of the SATLC's very controversial 'debates' about the future of the revolution. In it, notable SATLC speakers outlined arguments about how segregation in South Africa could be legally dismantled, but stopped short of overturning the much maligned Pass Laws that restrict the freedom of movement of blacks. The supposed merits for keeping this antiquated, reactionary policy is that if it was overturned, poorer blacks would move into Cape Town, Johannesburg and Durban, 'overpopulating the townships and living in squalor'. Though the speakers clarified that this restricted internal migration would not be based upon race, but rather subordinated to the economic needs of the state, ensuring that black peasants do not flock to the cities like 20th century serfs. Though the SATLC initially sought to reject the validity of this protocol, they eventually caved after witnesses to the debates affirmed these words were truly said. This scandal has proven to be the straw that broke the camel's back, as Chairman Andrews, outraged at the SATLC and the Provisional Government's inability to combat these racist elements of the South African left, which more and more Africanists and progressives claim were emboldened by his own proposal for parallel unions, has ultimately tethered his resignation. Rumours also circulate that Walter Madeley, the new socialist Prime Minister, will also resign in solidarity with Andrews, whilst deputy-Chairman Briggs has talked of forging some kind of compromise with the rogue elements of the SATLC and opening the Johannesburg Convention despite these delays and the disastrous political infighting. On the fringes of the city, black and coloured revolutionary militias, as well as groups of sympathetic whites who have also felt snubbed by the SATLC's power grab are rumoured to be organising some kind of protest, if not worse..."
 saf.412.a: "This cannot be good."

 saf.413.t: "The Convention That Wasn't"
 saf.413.d: "Before the Johannesburg Convention to decide the future Constitution of a socialist South Africa truly had a chance to begin, it seems to already have fallen apart. After Chairman Andrews' resignation due to the political scandals involving racist elements of the SATLC and continual power grabs by these unions of white workers, there was some hope that deputy-Chairman Briggs could attempt to restore peace to the city. Unfortunately, a few days afterwards several violent clashes erupted between white and black political militias, leading Briggs to request reinforcements from Pretoria in order to control the situation and prevent an all out civil war between the revolutionary factions. Black militias under the leadership of Edwin Thabo Mofutsanyana blocked the order however, limiting communications between the cities. At the same time, as soon as news of Andrews' resignation and the SATLC's conduct reached Cape Town and Durban, a wave of unrest swept the coastal cities. Militants loyal to the ICU, particularly a group calling itself the National Liberation League which is led by James La Guma, one of Clement Kadalie's close lieutenants, as well as a black militia under the command of Moses Kotane, seized control of government buildings in Cape Town and established their own rival government led by La Guma. Shortly thereafter, mutinies sprung up in Johannesburg itself, apparently under the tacit approval of former Chairman Andrews', perhaps desperate to put whatever genie he unleashed back into the bottle. As a result, troops loyal to this new radical La Guma administration occupied the convention centre and have taken the Provisional Revolutionary Government into their custody. Andrews and the SATLC's dream of parallel unionism appears to be dead once and for all, as the self-proclaimed Chairman James La Guma has announced his intent to link up with Mofutsanyana and the local dissidents here in Johannesburg."
 saf.413.a: "South Africa is in chaos."

 saf.414.t: "The Africanist Convention"
 saf.414.d: "Chairman James La Guma has arrived in Johannesburg amidst applause, as he and his National Liberation League's swift coup against 'reactionary and deviant' elements of the SATLC and the Labour party appears to have triumphed. With the recognition of the ICU and lukewarm support from the ISL, most noticeably former Chairman Andrews who appears to have considered La Guma the lesser of two evils compared to the SATLC white supremacists, La Guma announced his intention to create a 'Native Black Republic', seeking to return land to the indigenous population of South Africa and break the political hegemony of the white union organisers. The Johannesburg Convention was reopened, chaired mainly by black representatives and sympathetic whites who had helped fight back against the SATLC's own power grab. The Africanist stalwart Albert Nzula was hastily confirmed as deputy-Chairman, whilst the former ANC President J.T. Gumede was appointed Prime Minister as a concession to the black middle class. Moses Kotane and Edwin Mofutsanyana were both given minor positions in government, as reward for their loyalty, whilst La Guma's former, trusted mentor and now political rival, Clements Kadalie, has been awarded a pension on the condition that he withdraws from the ICU and politics as a whole. Uneasy compromises were eventually reached at the convention, with Chairman La Guma rejecting calls from the white delegates to create an 'independent workers' and peasants' republic with equal rights for all toilers irrespective of colour' or to make a 'federation of independent native republics'. Instead, the order of the day appears to be an 'independent, native South African Republic with full and equal rights for all races as a stage towards a workers' and peasants' republic', with the La Guma administration favouring a bottom-up, grassroots-led transformation of South African society and emphasising that this period of majority rule will be a transitionary period towards revolutionary equality, ironically quite similar to how Andrews and the SATLC framed their idea of parallel unions. Despite some cries of terror from white moderates that South Africa would go the way of the Haitian revolution, violence appears to have slowed and the Chairman has urged peace and reconciliation, declaring that his agenda is not one of black supremacy, but merely majority rule in South Africa. Even so, his language appears to be steeped in favouritism for the black proletariat."
 saf.414.a: "Let us hope it does not turn into a tyranny of the masses."

 saf.500.t: "The Hobbit, or There and Back Again" #formerly in 01 Entente Flavour events.txt
 saf.500.d: "The George Allwen and Unwin publishing house has put out a new book by British émigré J. R. R. Tolkien, who returned to South Africa following the revolution. It tells the story of Bilbo Baggins, a strange small creature called a Hobbit, who goes on an adventure featuring wizards, dwarves, giants, goblins and a fire-breathing dragon before returning home a wealthy man. The tale has already received widespread critical acclaim and Tolkien has been nominated for literary prizes. There have been hints that he is working on something longer and larger, but the author's notorious perfectionism might well delay its publishing."

 SAF_james_arnold_la_guma_leader_desc: "§YBorn:§! §LAugust 23rd, 1894, in Bloemfontein, Orange Free State§!\n§YBackground:§! §LJames \"Jimmy\" Arnold La Guma was born to a lower class family of French-Malagasy immigrants, who died shortly after and left James in the care of an uncle in Cape Town. As a coloured man James was not at the bottom of South Africa's racial hierarchy, but his impoverished upbringing nevertheless taught him the grim realities of oppression and inequality. In his boyhood, he participated in the 1906 Cape Town \"Hooligan Riots\", where a multiracial protest of workers and local leftist political leaders was repulsed by police and descended into looting and violence. James for his part joined in by stealing bread and handing it out to the protesting workers. Being largely self-educated, he attributed his first thoughts of class consciousness to reading simple works of proletarian literature and by performing labour-intensive, underpaid jobs. He spent the Weltkrieg in British-occupied Sudwestafrika, toiling on the railroads and in German-owned diamond mines. Here he faced blacklists and arrests, thanks to taking up political activities and trying to organise strikes, which resulted in him returning to South Africa in 1920. James set up shop back in Cape Town, joining Clements Kadalie's Industrial and Commercial Workers' Union and was later elected as its Assistant General Secretary. James emerged as the real power behind the ICU's labour organising, whilst Kadalie tinkered with political theory. Later when Kadalie was deported in 1924, James was tasked together with the British Syndicalist William George Ballinger to argue in Kadalie's absence in order to reconcile the far left of the ICU with its moderate, mainly white wing. Though they managed to secure the ICU's loyalty to Kadalie's vision and James was recognised as leader in Kadalie's absence, the fight over the ICU had a profound effect on James and led him to seriously reconsider the role whites should play in organising the South African labour movement. He began to privately muse that white workers, aware that their privilege always rested on the exploitation of the black proletariat, could not be relied upon to support any revolutionary initiative. James soon forged closer ties with other so-called \"Africanists\" on the radical left who shared this sentiment, such as Albert Nzula and J.T. Gumede. In 1935 he started the exclusively black and coloured National Liberation League. Later, these loyal militants would go on to serve as his own political shock troops in the turbulent days of the Second Rand Revolt.§!"

 SAF_clements_kadalie: "Clements Kadalie"
 SAF_clements_kadalie_leader_desc: "§YBorn:§! §LApril, 1896, in Chifira, Nyasaland, British Central Africa Protectorate§!\n§YBackground:§! §LClements Kadalie was born with the native name Lameck Koniwaka Kadali Muwamba to a minor chiefly family. His father and uncle's influence helped secure him entrance to a missionary school, where he turned out to be an exemplary student. At age 16, he was granted a position as a teacher to a minor village school in Nyasaland, but after a year he decided to seek employment as a clerk instead. This eventually brought him to Cape Town, where he first started going by the anglicised name \"Clements Kadalie\". There he met and befriended the white trade unionist Arthur F. Batty and together they joined forces to found a multiethnic trade union, which was dubbed the Industrial and Commercial Workers Union. Clements became known as the \"Father of Black Trade Unionism\" in South Africa and gained a great deal of fame after he and Batty led a dockworkers strike in 1919, an experience that brought them in touch with other leaders of the labour movement, such as James La Guma and Sidney Bunting. As La Guma gained a greater role within the ICU, Clements started focusing his efforts on studying political theory and writing for the ICU's newspaper, \"Black Man\", where he wove together Syndicalist ideas with Pan-Africanism and a religious rhetoric steeped in Garveyism and Ethiopianism.\n\nAs a consequence of his political activism, Clements was deported from South Africa in 1924 and left for Britain, right as the British Revolution began. He soon produced firsthand accounts of the revolution's struggles and offered a spirited defence of British Syndicalism to his peers back in South Africa. Yet in time, he grew disaffected with the African diaspora in Britain and its domination by the Anglican faith. Even though Clements was himself a Presbyterian with strong ties to the Ethiopianist movement, he imagined the need for a post-religious society after the revolution, and eventually packed his bags for Paris where the socio-political culture of Laicism suited him better. After garnering ties with Francophone African radicals, he helped provide input on the future of the ICU, laying out proposals for how the union could continue to operate in his absence and adapt to new circumstances. La Guma and other followers thus helped to promote the multi-ethnic Syndicalist wing of the ICU, against the \"Parallel Unionism\" of the white moderates, winning over indecisive members and helping to calm tensions within the union.\n\nClements himself became the ICU's main representative to the Internationale, keeping a steady watch on his home continent, even in exile, awaiting the spark that could lead to a grand workers uprising, as had happened in France and Britain.§!"

 SAF_moses_mauane_kotane_leader_desc: "§YBorn:§! §LAugust 9th, 1905, in Pella, Transvaal Colony§!\n§YBackground:§! §LMoses Mauane Kotane was born to a Black literate family belonging to the Tswana peoples. Despite his father being a Lutheran preacher, young Moses received little formal schooling as a child and as the second oldest son among eleven siblings was expected to find work at an early age, to help provide for the family. As a teenager, he initially found employment as a farmworker and was paid primarily in livestock that was given to his family. By the time he finally entered school, Moses was far behind his fellow students and grew increasingly confrontational with his teachers, who he believed were unqualified and did not properly nurture his talents. In 1924 he moved to Johannesburg and worked a variety of jobs, eventually joining the ANC and the ICU's trade unions. With backing from his fellow trade unionist Albert Nzula, Moses was soon elected as vice-chair of a national trade union conference and introduced to the wider world of the black, white and coloured intelligentsia in South Africa. He grew close to the ISL, particularly the clique surrounding Sidney Bunting, David Ivon Jones and Eddie Roux, who were greatly sympathetic to encouraging black membership in the South African labour movement. He also briefly flirted with Africanist, nativist ideas due to Nzula's influence, but ultimately feared that black nationalism would lead to racial chauvinism and tribal animosity, endangering the carefully maintained alliances between blacks and coloureds. Moses went on to serve as a typesetter and Setswana translator for various socialist newspapers under Roux' editorship.\n\nBy the 1930s, Moses packed his bags for Cape Town in an attempt to build a new political following away from the socialist leadership in Johannesburg, but also to slip beneath the South African government's notice, forging secret alliances with coastal trade unions. This paid off after the socialist revolution, as these unions elected Moses as a key member of the new ISL government, eventually paving the way for him to take over as David Ivon Jones' successor, serving as a young, charismatic, black leader of the nation's socialist movement.§!"

His grandfather John Jones had been a champion of Welsh rural politics and a participant in the religious Nonconformist movement, which heavily affected David growing up. Though initially following in his grandfather's footsteps and taking up the cause of Welsh nationalism, David contracted tuberculosis in his early 20s, a disease that has haunted him ever since. After being recommended to move to a drier climate to convalesce, David first packed his bags for New Zealand, but later in 1909 migrated to South Africa where he settled in the Witwatersrand. He witnessed vast social and economic inequality among the miners, as well as the racial divides in the labour movement. David thought both white and black labourers were treated as slaves, but put emphasis on how thoroughly downtrodden the blacks were, abandoned by the white workers who could have been their comrades. Motivated by Christian Unitarianism, along with his moralist and nascent socialist views, David proclaimed that the South African worker would have to \"fight for human rights, whether for the coloured or white people\".\n\nHe encouraged the growth of black trade unions and class consciousness among workers of all skin colours. As a staunch pacifist, he joined the anti-war International Socialist League and became its General Secretary, yet David struggled to handle the immense workload that he put on himself and after contracting malaria in addition to his tuberculosis he briefly resigned his position and underwent both a spiritual and health crisis, departing South Africa for medical asylum in the Commune of France in 1920. His love of Christ and Socialism was eventually rekindled and he soon rejoined the ISL, being chosen as their representative to the Third Internationale. While in France, David collaborated with members of the African diaspora to pen his magnum opus, \"Africa Awakening\", which declared that \"Every capitalist government is drenched with the blood of the Negro\". During this time he also reunited with the exiled South African black trade unionist Clements Kadalie, helping to solidify the political alliance between the ISL and the ICU. Eventually in 1928, David felt strong enough to return to South Africa, with his friend and mentor Sidney Bunting arranging passage for him to Johannesburg, where he has been active ever since.§!"

 SAF_william_henry_andrews: "William Henry Andrews"
 SAF_william_henry_andrews_leader_desc: "§YBorn:§! §LApril 20th, 1870, in Leiston, Suffolk, England§!\n§YBackground:§! §LWilliam Henry Andrews, commonly known as \"Bill\" Andrews or just \"Comrade Bill\" dropped out of school at the tender age of 13, and drifted between jobs, eventually receiving training as a mechanical fitter. He took to trade unionism early on, joining the Amalgamated Society of Engineers. By 1893 he secured steady employment on a railroad in South Africa, choosing to immigrate to what was then the Transvaal Colony. Bill then spent the better part of two decades on the Rand frontier and in the city of Johannesburg, toiling on the railroads or in the Gold mines and for a brief time serving in the British army during the 2nd Boer War. He recognised the desperate need for an organised labour movement that could fight back against the local \"Randlords\" who dominated the colony, slowly but surely spreading the influence of the ASE and eventually rising up countless local trade union federations and trades and labour councils. By 1909 he took a greater interest in parliamentary politics, recognising the change that the Act of Union would mark, so Bill helped to found the all-white South African Labour Party and elected as an MP on their ticket.\n\nVery soon however, Bill became opposed to the party's segregationist agenda and their endorsement of the British war effort in the Weltkrieg. He went on to help found the ISL, beginning to formulate an idea of \"parallel unionism\" that would calm racial tensions on the South African left by allowing whites to operate one set of unions, whilst the blacks, coloureds and other minority would operate a parallel union. The promise of blacks and whites being \"separate but equal\" was one which was often flaunted and disregarded, Bill knew that much, but he genuinely believed then and still does that this plan is the only way to create racial harmony in South Africa. Parallel unionism was never formally added to the ISL's political platform, though Bill did help codify it as a popular policy within the South African Trades Union Congress after he was elected as the trade union federation's first General Secretary in 1924. Few expected a radical like Bill would head up the SATUC but he won an undisputed majority of the votes and beat out Frederic Creswell, Minister of Labour in the Hertzog government. Bill continued to remain influential within the SATUC's successor, the SATLC.\n\nThanks to this political influence, to say nothing of his legendary reputation as a Syndicalist populist, Comrade Bill has become Chairman Andrews, the first provisional leader of a new socialist South Africa, where he will be forced to thread the needle between tense factional politics, economic collapse and racial tensions.§!"

During the Weltkrieg, Smuts led South Africa's armies against the Germans in Namibia and clashed with the famous Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck in East Africa. In defeat, Smuts continued for South Africa's future; while he was temporarily swept out of power in 1924 by the National Party, who wanted to break with Britain permanently, he was back in charge in 1929. He has been fighting for South Africa's alliance with the Entente for his entire career, and it does not appear he is about to give up.§!"

Even in defeat, however, Hertzog continued to champion the Afrikaner people. He rose to leadership of the Afrikaner dominated \"National Party\", and in 1924, became South Africa's first Nationalist prime minister in coalition with Labour. With the collapse of the United Kingdom the following year, Hertzog was confronted with the fact that he did not have the parliamentary majority to take South Africa out of the Empire, but managed to assume stewardship of the High Commissioner Territories. Hertzog, now as State President of the new South African Republic, has been a proponent of segregation between South Africa's various racial groups, and has encouraged the disenfranchisement and resettlement of South Africa's already oppressed black population.§!"
