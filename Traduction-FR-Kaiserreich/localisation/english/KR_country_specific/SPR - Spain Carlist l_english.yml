 SPR_guardia_civil_idea: "Guardia Real"

### Decisions ###
 SPR_assassinate_juan: "Assassinate Infante Juan"
 SPR_assassinate_juan_desc: "Infante Juan is King Alfonso's regent, as well as his heir. His death would throw [SPA.GetNameDef] into disarray and give us time to knock them out of the civil war completely!"

### Political Focuses ###
 SPR_restauracion: "Restauración"
 SPR_restauracion_desc: "Now that we have won the civil war, we must first focus on entrenching the newly restored legitimate branch of the House of Borbón. A significant period of reconstruction will be needed to repair the lives of the king's subjects, but soon Spain shall have restored itself to greatness."
 SPR_dios: "Dios"
 SPR_dios_desc: "Dios or Faith in God and the Catholic church is a central tenet of Carlism. The Kings of Spain have long had the title of Catholic Monarch and Catholic Majesty though they have not always lived up to these titles. We on the other hand shall live up to these titles."
 SPR_patria: "Patria"
 SPR_patria_desc: "Fatherland is what binds all Spaniards together. Spain is not just a nation, it is the community of the faithful Catholics who honour tradition and live according to the laws and customs of its ancestors, as tradition dictates. Liberalism has only brought the freedom to sin, to degenerate and the libertinism to defy Holy Name of God. Our nation emerges from the natural law of human communities, and as such will be recognised."
 SPR_mending_the_rift: "Heal the Soul of our Nation"
 SPR_mending_the_rift_desc: "Despite languishing under the rule of Liberals, Secularists and Anarchists for decades, Spain's Soul still remains as our recent success has shown.

 SPR_call_for_unity_desc: "Throughout this period of healing and reconcillation our nation has had to go through, our King has acted as a uniting beacon of stability. No matter the political changes or disagreements we experience, [SPR.getleader] and his successors will always be with us to guide our nation forward."
 SPR_rey: "Rey"
 SPR_rey_desc: "The concept of national sovereignty is rejected. Sovereignty is vested on the king, both legitimate in blood and in deeds. But this power is limited by the doctrine of the Church and the Laws and Usages of the Kingdom, and through a series of Councils, traditional Cortes and state-independent intermediate bodies."
 SPR_furos: "Fueros"
 SPR_furos_desc: "Natural law and its justice tells us to treat the equal as equal and the unequal as unequal. This is determined by the traditional charters respected by the king and his subjects.

 SPR_national_catholicism: "National Catholicism"

The law modernises the education system, as well as making attendance mandatory for all Spaniards for at least 14 years. This will vastly improve the quality of education in Spain."
 SPR_expand_real_academia: "Expand Real Academia"
 SPR_expand_real_academia_desc: "The Royal Academies are the highest education schools within Spain. Many often specialise in one particular field or connected fields, such as science, medicine, history, language and so on. We should make sure that they get the funding needed to provide education for Spain."
 SPR_royal_charters: "Royal Industrial Charters"
 SPR_royal_charters_desc: "As part of this period of reconstruction we will need a much larger industrial base than currently exists in the nation.

 SPR_modern_agriculture: "Modern Agriculture"
 SPR_modern_agriculture_desc: "The many small farm estates of the countryside have struggled during the recent troubles we have faced, as they have been unable to adopt new agricultural technologies and methods of cultivation. We should subsidise the import of modern agricultural equipment to jump start this process."
 SPR_military_factories: "Expand the Arms Industry"
 SPR_military_factories_desc: "War will likely come to Spain in the future. The godless Commune of France sits just across the Pyrenees after all. Thus in order to prepare for that future war, we should build new military factories."
 SPR_labour_charter: "Labour Charter"
 SPR_labour_charter_desc: "The state has announced the creation of a Labour Charter. This charter helps protect the realm's subjects from godless Syndicalism by providing a conservative welfare programme and recognising some worker's rights, nipping the growth of further Syndicalism in the bud."
 SPR_catholic_trade_unions: "Catholic Trade Unions"
 SPR_catholic_trade_unions_desc: "Trade unions are unfortunately rather important in the modern economy, and we cannot simply get rid of them completely. However instead of alienating them we should instead promote Catholic trade unions as an alternative. This will help give us greater control over the working classes as well as help deradicalise the unions that sided with the godless syndicalists."
 SPR_spanish_miracle: "Spanish Miracle"
 SPR_spanish_miracle_desc: "At long last the Spanish economy has been rebuilt. Throughout Spain, the people are hard at work while also enjoying the newfound economic prosperity throughout the realm."

 SPR_join_entente: "Join the Entente"
 SPR_join_entente_desc: "The Portuguese and the French are some of the last true Catholics left in the Mediterranean with the rise of godless Syndicalism and as they are aligned with the Entente we should seek to also join their alliance to strengthen our bonds and aid their fight against Syndicalism."
 SPR_iberian_trade: "Iberian Friendship"
 SPR_iberian_trade_desc: "We should cultivate the ties with the Portuguese who protected us during our persecutions. Spain and Portugal shall always be closely connected and friends as shall our monarchs be close together."
 SPR_french_advisors: "French Advisors"
 SPR_french_advisors_desc: "The years France has spent in exile in Algiers has led to the development of advanced amphibious assault techniques, all in service of reclaiming the mainland. We should ask our French friends to share their knowledge with us, so we too can aid their plans."
 SPR_canadian_advisors: "Canadian Advisors"
 SPR_canadian_advisors_desc: "Canada has been the heart of the British Empire in terms of industrial development and military advancement since the loss of the Home Isles. We should seek support from their IEDC and ISAC to aid Spain in our own developments in these fields."

 SPR_joint_military_training_desc: "The Entente is a global alliance with members experienced in all forms of combat in virtually every theatre that exists across the world.

 SPR_legion_espanola_desc: "The army of Spain was one of the greatest armies in the world. With the outbreak of civil war in our nation and the splintering of the remaining army we should use this as an opportunity to reform the soldiers loyal to us into a new army, the Legión Española."
 SPR_modern_terrico: "Modern Tercio"
 SPR_modern_terrico_desc: "During the Spanish Golden Age the Tercio was the backbone of the Spanish Army. We should look at modernise our Army to be the modern Terico. With these reforms our army will once again be the envy of the world."
 SPR_requetes: "Requeté"
 SPR_requetes_desc: "The Requetés have long been part of the Carlist army since the first Carlist War. While they were originally militias, we should look at reforming them into the elite force of the new Spanish army. Their high religious fervour and their distinctive red berets shall serve as an inspiration to the rest of the troops."
 SPR_artillery_effort: "Artillery Effort"
 SPR_artillery_effort_desc: "In order to improve the army we should look at improving the artillery. Artillery will play a role in future conflicts and we should look to making sure that our army has the best equipment and the most skilled men."
 SPR_guardia_civil: "Guardia Real"
 SPR_guardia_civil_desc: "Historically the Guardia Real has served as the Royal Guards of the ruler of Spain, protecting them from both internal and external threats. As much of the Royal Guard stayed loyal to Alfonso despite his illegitimate control of the throne, it is the perfect time to establish a new loyal Royal Guard dedicated to serving the true King of Spain against his enemies."
 SPR_emergency_factories: "Virtus et Labor"
 SPR_emergency_factories_desc: "Success and victory does not come to those who are slothful, but to the hard workers who devote themselves to God.

 SPR_devoted_officers: "Devoted Officers"
 SPR_devoted_officers_desc: "The new Spanish Army shall be known for its devoted officers, soldiers devoted equally both to their King and to their Catholic faith. These officers will provide an excellent example for the rest of our troops, allowing them to fight on no matter the odds."

 SPR_word_of_god_desc: "The radio has been a useful tool saving many a soldier's life during the civil war, leading to their nickname of the \"Word of God\". With how useful these radios have been, we should invest in further radio technology to help ensure more of our troops survive."
 SPR_walls_of_jericho: "Break the Walls of Jericho"
 SPR_walls_of_jericho_desc: "As the Walls of old Jericho fell to the righteous soldiers of God, so too will the defences of our enemies. Our grand railway artillery shall serve as our trumpets, with a loud shout their frontlines will crumble."
 SPR_army_of_maneuver: "Army of Manoeuvre"
 SPR_army_of_maneuver_desc: "We should make sure that our brigades have enough support teams within to be effective. Be they artillery, medical, radio, logistic or any other companies by intermixing regular troops with support companies, the Spanish army shall never falter."
 SPR_mechanized_effort: "Spanish Auto Industry"

 SPR_weltrieg_lessons: "Armoured Warfare Tactics"
 SPR_weltrieg_lessons_desc: "The Weltkrieg showed to everybody the potential use of tanks. Combined with motorised or mechanised support, tanks can excel at the purpose they were designed to achieve; to catch the enemy by surprise. Unlike in the Weltkrieg, where tanks were massive and vulnerable targets, a much more mobile approach is needed."
 SPR_navarran_lancers: "Navarran Lancers"
 SPR_navarran_lancers_desc: "During the first Carlist War, the lancers from Navarra were some of the best cavalry troops that the armies had. It therefore seems fitting to revive this legacy with our tank brigades. They shall be our elite troops, and the tip of the spear of the Spanish Army."
 SPR_tank_shipments: "Request Entente Tank Shipments"
 SPR_tank_shipments_desc: "If we are to win this ongoing war, we will need as many tanks as possible deployed to the battlefield.

 SPR_a_catholic_army: "A Catholic Army"
 SPR_a_catholic_army_desc: "Regardless of the particular reforms that we have decided upon, the one thing that we can say is that the Army of Spain is a Catholic army, from the highest of generals to the most lowly of soldiers. God shall be with the army of Spain."

### Navy Focuses ###
 SPR_armada_espanola: "Armada Española"
 SPR_armada_espanola_desc: "During the Spanish golden age, the Spanish Armada was the greatest fleet in the world. Its ship sailed the oceans and we ruled the waves. We should modernise our fleet and restore our navy to its former glory."
 SPR_upgrade_dockyards: "Dirección General de la Marina Mercante"
 SPR_upgrade_dockyards_desc: "The Spanish Navy was famous for its merchants, Spanish galleons filled with gold and other goods from the Americas would flow back daily to the mainland. We should rekindle our mercantile spirit and build a modern merchant marine for the Spanish Navy."
 SPR_devoted_captains: "Devoted Captains"
 SPR_devoted_captains_desc: "All of our ships should have dedicated Catholic chaplains to aid the sailors in matters of faith.

 SPR_infanteria_de_marina: "Infantería de Marina"
 SPR_infanteria_de_marina_desc: "The Infantería de Marina is the marine force of the Spanish Navy and the oldest marine corp in the world, having been founded in 1537 by Charles I of Spain.

Our marines shall be once again restored to a status truly befitting their legacy."
 SPR_grand_navy: "The New Armada"

 SPR_battle_cruisers_support: "Dedicated Armoured Cruisers"
 SPR_battle_cruisers_support_desc: "While dreadnoughts are the pride of the Spanish Navy, armoured cruisers will also serve a vital role as escorts for our navy."
 SPR_defend_the_coast: "Guardians of the Spanish Coast"
 SPR_defend_the_coast_desc: "The Spanish Navy shall focus on defending Spain itself. While it shall not be as large as some want, it will be respected and it shall defend Spain from all enemies."
 SPR_coast_guard: "Establish a Dedicated Coast Guard"
 SPR_coast_guard_desc: "Currently Spain lacks any form of dedicated coast guard force, with most of the duties being handled by the Guardia Civil until recently. If we are to fully protect the Spanish coast from any possible threats, it would be imperative for us to establish a dedicated coast guard unit to handle these duties instead."
 SPR_protect_our_colonies: "Protect Our Colonies"
 SPR_protect_our_colonies_desc: "The overseas colonies that we still hold are of vital interest to Spain and we should use our navy to protect the coast of our colonies from all attackers. However in case that is not viable, several well placed coastal forts and batteries shall do the job."
 SPR_cruiser_support: "Light Cruiser Support"
 SPR_cruiser_support_desc: "The use of smaller, more lightly armoured scout ships will allow us to disperse forces across a wide area in order to scout our entire coastline, ensuring we are able to rapidly respond to enemy incursions."

### Air Force Focuses ###
 SPR_aviacion_legionaria: "Aviación Legionaria"
 SPR_aviacion_legionaria_desc: "Modern wars are fought not only on the land and across the seas, but also in the skies. Modern air doctrines must be instilled into our pilots, and state of the art planes must be built if we expect to be victorious in our battles."
 SPR_upgrade_air_ports: "Nationalise Civilian Aerodromes"
 SPR_upgrade_air_ports_desc: "The infrastructure needed to support a large air force does not need to be built completely from the ground up. Across the country there are many civilian aerodromes which we would be able to nationalise and expand into proper military airports, saving us significant time in establishing new airfields for our pilots to use."
 SPR_new_pilots: "Training New Pilots"
 SPR_new_pilots_desc: "Most of our current air force is made up of eager volunteers and former pilots of civilian aircraft, with little to no knowledge of military aviation. It is therefore imperative that these recruits receive proper training before they are deployed in the skies, as their experience will hopefully give us the edge we need over our rivals."
 SPR_aviation_industry: "Support the Aviation Industry"
 SPR_aviation_industry_desc: "Spanish aircraft manufacturers have been stunted by the turbulence that has plagued the country for several years. Ongoing troubles in the world have showed the need for modern aircraft companies, and so support should be provided to several Spanish companies that seek to modernise our aviation industry."
 SPR_air_supremacy: "Air Supremacy"
 SPR_air_supremacy_desc: "The skies must be free from enemies and our armies unmolested by hostile aircraft. Our air force should primarily be focused on establishing and maintaining control of the air."
 SPR_fighters: "Fighter Effort"
 SPR_fighters_desc: "Fighters are the backbone of any air force, allowing us to express our supremacy over the sky and allow the rest of our air force to flourish. To ensure that we are able to do so, we must focus on developing new fighter models to outperform our enemies in the air."
 SPR_foreign_airplanes: "Purchase Foreign Planes"
 SPR_foreign_airplanes_desc: "Our country is not really in the position to manufacture an air force. For this reason, we must purchase old planes from abroad to help kickstart the Spanish Air Force. The air war is likely to become of greater importance as the Weltkrieg had suggested decades ago."
 SPR_army_air_support: "Army Air Support"
 SPR_army_air_support_desc: "The easiest enemy to fight is one who has already been killed by a bombing run before the battle begins, and so our air force should be focused on producing planes focused on battlefield support missions and bombing efforts to support our troops in their endeavours."
 SPR_bombers: "Bomber Effort"
 SPR_bombers_desc: "To truly assist the army, our air force must be capable of destroying fortified positions and disrupting enemy infrastructure. To accomplish this, we should focus on the development of new tactical and strategic bombers."
 SPR_voice_of_heaven: "Eyes of Heaven"
 SPR_voice_of_heaven_desc: "RADAR is a promising new technology which, with further development could provide a wealth of information about enemy tactics and positions and reveal the course of enemy aircraft. Several pilots have begun calling RADAR the Eyes of Heaven for how much they are able to reveal and see."
 SPR_paratrooper_focus: "Desperta Ferro!"
 SPR_paratrooper_focus_desc: "By the end of the Middle Ages, a famous company of Aragonese mercenaries, the Almogávares, made their war cry “Awake the Iron” famous across the Mediterranean. That war cry will honour a new unit of paratroopers; quick infantry, transported by planes and able to deploy behind enemy lines."
 SPR_colonial_air_ports: "Colonial Airports"

 SPR_rule_the_skies: "Champions of the Skies"
 SPR_rule_the_skies_desc: "The air force is no longer a rag-tag collection of volunteers, but a fully functioning organ of our military. Let us rule the skies of Spain and beyond!"

### Characters ###
 SPR_francisco_javier_de_borbon_parma_y_braganza: "Javier I"
 SPR_francisco_javier_de_borbon_parma_y_braganza_leader_desc: "§YBorn:§! §LMay 25th, 1889, in Lucca, Kingdom of Italy§!\n§YBackground:§! §LInheriting a dynastic legacy over a century in the making, Francisco Javier de Borbón-Parma y de Braganza has ascended to the head of the Carlist branch of the Borbón dynasty as the designated successor of Duke Alfonso Carlos. Having been proclaimed as King Javier I of Spain by the supporters of Carlism, he has been given the difficult task of cementing his claim to the throne and reconciling a destructively divided nation.\n\nWhile to many in the nation, Javier is king of the Spanish people, it would be hard to describe the man himself as a Spaniard. As the son of Robert I, deposed Duke of Parma, Javier was born in the Kingdom of Italy yet immersed deeply in French culture from birth owing to his family's dynastic origins. Until the death of Alfonso Carlos, Javier's only direct experience of Spain had been brief holidays and familial visits to distant dynastic relatives.\n\nBeing the brother in law of Kaiser Karl I of Austria, Javier initially planned to join the Austrian army to support their fight against Serbia. However seeing himself as a Frenchman above all else, France's entry into the war would eventually lead to him instead enlisting alongside his brother Sixtus in the Belgian army, having been blocked from joining France's as a foreign royal. Still however valuing his family, Javier aided his brother in Karl I's disastrous attempt to negotiate a secret peace with the Entente.\n\nFollowing the conclusion of the war Javier chose to remain initially in France, staying in one of his family's castles in the country. With the outbreaks of uprisings across the nation and soon Europe as a whole, Javier and other members of the Borbón-Parma dynasty sought refuge with their relatives from the Two Sicily's branch of the family in Naples. There he would remain until his arrival in Spain in the lead up to the nation's civil war.\n\nWith Javier now ruling as a practical foreigner on a much disputed throne, only time will tell if he can truly ingratiate himself with the Spanish people and help finally heal the greatly fractured country.§!"
