 NOR_weak_economy: "Sluggish Economy"
 NOR_weak_economy_desc: "After the Weltkrieg, Norway remained in the British sphere of influence, both politically and economically. The British revolution of 1925 therefore proved disastrous to the export-orientated Norwegian economy. Since then, the nation has been excluded from most European markets due to the German 'Mitteleuropa'. The lack of international trade is crippling our economy."

### Decisions ###
 NOR_norsk_jernverk_mining_steel: "Establish Norsk Jernverk Company"
 NOR_norsk_jernverk_mining_steel_desc: "Scandinavia has the resources and technological knowledge to be self-sufficient with regards to iron and steel. Why then, should we spend our limited hard currency on acquiring such basic resources elsewhere? Let us strengthen Northern Norway and produce our own steel by creating a company dedicated to the purpose."
 NOR_aluminium_industry_mining: "Establish Norsk Aluminium Company"
 NOR_aluminium_industry_mining_desc: "Due to the abundance of cheap hydroelectric power, Norway is one of the world's leading producers of aluminium, with Norsk Aluminium Company being one of the larger producers in the country. As aluminium is crucial in the production of modern military aircraft, we would be well advised to increase our production, for both our own use and for exports."

### Focuses ###
 NOR_fund_nth: "Fund the NTH"
 NOR_fund_nth_desc: "The Norwegian Institute of Technology is our most skilled scientific institution in the fields of technical and industrial development. By increasing their funding, we can expect breakthroughs within several fields of industrial expertise."
 NOR_railway_act: "Pass the Infrastructure Act"
 NOR_railway_act_desc: "Since the time of the Vikings, the sea has been our main method of transportation. Goods and people have been moved along our long coastline by ship and many coastal villages still lack proper road connections even today. We should seek to address this problem by passing a grand Infrastructure Bill. Let us tie our country together through road and rail."
 NOR_south_industry_1: "Expand the Christiania Spigerverk"
 NOR_south_industry_1_desc: "The Christiania Nail Works is a steel company with a history dating back to 1853. They are one of the largest companies in Norway and a crucial part of our plans for industrialisation. Let us expand their facilities and greatly improve our industrial capabilities."
 NOR_north_infrastructure: "The Northern Railway"
 NOR_north_infrastructure_desc: "Northern Norway is a pretty isolated due to the length of our country and the lack of proper infrastructure. The Nordland Line, a rail connection between Trondheim and Bodø, has been planned since 1882, but the construction has proceeded at a very slow pace. If we are to exploit the wealth of resources in the north, we need to accelerate its construction."
 NOR_industrial_census: "SSB and the Industrial Census"
 NOR_industrial_census_desc: "The Norwegian Bureau of Statistics conducts all types of censuses every year. By conducting a National Industrial Census, we can better exploit our limited industrial potential."
 NOR_north_industry: "Industrialise the North"
 NOR_north_industry_desc: "Most of the cities in northern Norway are primarily concerned with agriculture, fishing and other basic forms of industry. If we encourage the construction of proper industry, we can be sure to increase our industrial output and bring prosperity to the area."
 NOR_norsk_jernverk: "A/S Norsk Jernverk"
 NOR_norsk_jernverk_desc: "Norway has the resources and technological knowledge to be self-sufficient in regards to iron and steel.

 NOR_south_industry_2: "Support Norsk Hydro"
 NOR_south_industry_2_desc: "Norsk Hydro, founded in 1905 by Sam Eyde and Kristian Birkeland, is the crown jewel of Norwegian industry. From the production of fertiliser and aluminium, to the production of heavy water, Hydro is an industrial behemoth. As the only notable Norwegian company on the international stage, we should further encourage its expansion."
 NOR_aluminium_industry: "Norsk Aluminium Company"
 NOR_aluminium_industry_desc: "Due to the abundance of cheap hydroelectric power, Norway is one of the world's leading producers of aluminium. Norsk Aluminium Company is one of the larger producers in the country. As aluminium is crucial in the production of modern military aircraft, we would be well advised to increase our production, both for our own use as well as exports."
 NOR_limited_rearmament: "Defensive Rearmament"
 NOR_limited_rearmament_desc: "It is a public secret that our military spending have remained inadequate since the dissolution of the union with Sweden in 1905. The increased level of tension has pushed several politicians to call for an increase in our military budget. Although our military commanders still want more funding, it would be a step in the right direction."
 NOR_weapon_industry_1: "Raufoss Ammunisjonsfabrikk"
 NOR_weapon_industry_1_desc: "The Raufoss Ammunition Plant, established in 1896, is one of the few weapons manufacturers in Norway. If we would like to increase our production of rifles and cartridges, expanding the plant seems like a natural course of action."
 NOR_weapon_industry_2: "Kongsberg Våpenfabrikk"
 NOR_weapon_industry_2_desc: "The Kongsberg Weapons Factory has a history dating back to our independence in 1814. The producer of the famed 'Krag-Jørgensen' rifle, which was even adopted by the United States from 1892 to 1903, 'KV' has proven both reliability and ingenuity. We should expand the factory to further assist in the production of weapons to our armed forces."
 NOR_extra_tech_slot: "Establish the FFI"

 NOR_oil_industry: "Vallø Oljeraffineri"
 NOR_oil_industry_desc: "The Vallø Oil Refinery is the only oil refinery in Norway. Since Norway lack any domestic oil sources, our demands must be met either through trade or the production of synthetic fuel. However, since we control large deposits of coal of Svalbard, we could attempt the later if we expand the chemical facilities on Vallø."
 NOR_glomma_line: "Upgrade the Glomma Line"
 NOR_glomma_line_desc: "The Glomma Line is a series of fortifications along the Swedish border. Constructed to guard against Sweden in case of outbreak of war in 1905, the fortifications were mostly dismantled after the peaceful resolution to the conflict. We still have the possibility to upgrade and re-arm the fortifications, should the situation require so."

 NOR_naval_rearmament: "The 1936 Fleet Plan"
 NOR_naval_rearmament_desc: "Our naval commanders have proposed a new plan for the Norwegian navy. The 1936 fleet plan will focus on industrial construction before specialising at a later date. This would greatly increase our naval potential."
 NOR_large_navy: "Panserskip and Cruisers"
 NOR_large_navy_desc: "We need larger vessels if Norway is going to project naval power into the North Atlantic. We should therefore focus on acquiring Panserskip and light cruiser."
 NOR_light_cruisers: "Construct Light Cruisers"

 NOR_heavy_cruisers: "The Model 1936 Modern Panserskip"
 NOR_heavy_cruisers_desc: "Our fleet of Panserskip have been criticised for being obsolete. While our ships are indeed old, the Panserskip-concept isn't. We need the very model of a modern navy Panserskip."
 NOR_small_navy: "U-boats and Destroyers"

 NOR_united_airforce: "Establish Luftforsvaret"

 NOR_airbase_infrastructure: "Build New Airports"

 NOR_andoya_rocket_base_desc: "Our aircraft of the future will be based upon the jet engine. We must therefore establish a site dedicated to the testing and development of jet technology."

 NOR_SYN_working_norway_victorious: "Worker's Victory"
 NOR_SYN_working_norway_victorious_desc: "It has been a long and tenuous road, almost achieved before in 1928, but it has finally happened: the proletariat has finally taken its rightful control over Norway, through the bourgeois system no less. A new Norway dawns, one that is for all Norwegians, not just the rich!"
 NOR_SYN_forced_haakon_removal: "Force Haakon's Abdication"
 NOR_SYN_forced_haakon_removal_desc: "Haakon, or prince Carl of Denmark as he is actually known, has been good for Norway, insofar that is possible with this snobbish class that are the noblemen. However, the monarchy is an outdated institution that we Norwegians were forced to accept under duress of the Ancien Regimes in 1905, and incompatible with syndicalist thought. He must go."
 NOR_SYN_declare_martial_law: "Declare Martial Law"
 NOR_SYN_declare_martial_law_desc: "It is time we ensure that the deep state controlled by capitalist fatcats as well as the populist rabble of Quisling are no longer able to threaten the government of the proletariat."

 NOR_SYN_capitalists_trial: "Bring Capitalists to Trial"
 NOR_SYN_capitalists_trial_desc: "Certain 'owners' of the means of production took to measures of highly questionable ethics. We should ensure they will pay for the injustices they served to their employees, we owe that to their victims."
 NOR_SYN_diplo_relations: "Establish Diplomatic Relations"
 NOR_SYN_diplo_relations_desc: "The lack of formal diplomatic relations is preventing proper diplomacy with our European comrades. We should therefore send an ambassador to London and Paris."
 NOR_SYN_harbor_finns: "Harbour Finnish Socialists"
 NOR_SYN_harbor_finns_desc: "Finland's revolution was sadly crushed at its root by the so-called 'white forces' and being a socialist in Finland is not a healthy disposition. We should offer sanctuary to Finnish socialists persecuted for their beliefs."
 NOR_SYN_bring_the_britons_back: "Bring the British Back!"
 NOR_SYN_bring_the_britons_back_desc: "Great Britain has always been Norway's natural partner, but when the revolutionaries took London the capitalists put the government up to ending relations with them, instead opening channels with the misguided nation of Canada.

 NOR_SYN_fund_fs: "Fund the Danish Syndicalism"
 NOR_SYN_fund_fs_desc: "Syndicalist support in our small former overlord of Denmark is weak.

But this will not succeed on our watch!"
 NOR_SYN_kompani_linge: "Kompani Linge"

 NOR_KR_gathering_storm_desc: "For Norway, the last two decades could have been better. As a neutral country supportive of the British war effort, the hegemonic power of Germany did not favour the land of the midnight sun and the nation was excluded from the Mitteleuropa project that did include Sweden and Denmark. When Great Britain fell to the hammer and torch, the last trading partner of Norway that was not subject to heavy tariffs was an ocean away. Ever since, Norway found itself in diplomatic and economic isolation, and in the suffering this entails, the syndicalist-inclined Labour Party rises in the polls at an ever-increasing pace."

 NOR_country_intro_header: "The State of Norway"
 NOR_country_intro_content: "Norway is standing at a crossroad in history. While the nation is relatively prosperous, civil society is plagued by political infighting and stagnation.\n\nThe left is divided as a result of schisms within the once dominant Labour party. In 1921 the moderate faction broke away and formed the Social Democratic Labour Party, while the radical syndicalist wing broke away to form the Norwegian Syndicalist Federation in 1923. In addition, the Norwegian Communist Party is struggling and there are rumours about forming a new vanguard party of the far left, based upon the principles of National-Syndicalism.\n\nOn the opposite end of the political spectrum, several nationalist organisations are jockeying for power and influence. While they are somewhat united in their opposition to socialism, their means and goals differ.\n\nWhile the political infighting has not resulted in violence, the ruling Liberal party is mostly powerless to handle pressing issues due to its minority government. As dark clouds are gathering once more over Europe, the people are anxiously awaiting the election in October 1936."

 norway.2.t: "Trade Mission to Japan"
 norway.2.d: "The lack of international trade has crippled the Norwegian economy since 1925. One of the underlying issues is the lack of work for our large merchant navy. A bright individual in the foreign department has recently proposed reaching out to the Empire of Japan, as it could prove a market for our dried-fish and whaling trade. We could also lease some merchant ships to the Japanese at favourable rates. If successful, an agreement would provide much needed contracts for our merchant navy."
 norway.2.a: "Send a trade delegation."
 norway.2.b: "The idea is ridiculous."

 norway.3.t: "Mission from Norway"
 norway.3.d: "We recently received a trade delegation from the Kingdom of Norway. The country seeks new trading partners as it is not a part of the German 'Reichspakt' that dominates trade on the European mainland. They seek to trade, among other things, dried-fish and have offered us very favourable rates on Norwegian merchant shipping. Most of our trade experts are in favour of accepting, while a few oppose the use of foreign shipping in moving Japanese goods."
 norway.3.a: "We won't refuse a good deal."
 norway.3.b: "Politely decline."

 norway.4.t: "Norvego-Japanese Trade Agreement of 1936"
 norway.4.d: "Our proposal for a trade agreement has been accepted by the Japanese government and was signed in Tokyo this morning. It will provide much needed relief for parts of our economy."
 norway.4.a: "Great!"

 norway.5.t: "The Japanese Decline"
 norway.5.d: "Unfortunately, the Japanese government has declined our trade agreement. It seems we will have to find other markets for our industry."
 norway.5.a: "Apparently, the idea was ridiculous after all..."

 norway.6.t: "End of the NKP"
 norway.6.d: "Today the NKP, the Norwegian Communist Party, disbanded itself. Having failed to capitalise on the current economic crisis, the party decided to disband itself and have its members join the newly created Norwegian National-Syndicalist Party. Based upon the new teaching of politicians such as Benito Mussolini and Oswald Mosley, popularly known as \"Totalism\", the party hopes to aspire to greater things than communism ever proved capable of."
 norway.6.a: "Yet another party of the left?"

 norway.7.t: "Protests Against Farm Foreclosures"
 norway.7.d: "The current economic crisis has caused a lot of farmers to default on their loans and mortgages. As a result, their livestock and property is normally auctioned away to the highest bidder by local authorities. The practice is deeply unpopular among Norwegian farmers, but its proponents claim that debts must be repaid and that the auctions are a necessary evil in a free market economy. Yesterday, the Farmers Party proposed a bill that would ban the auctions. What is the governments position on the issue?"
 norway.7.a: "Allow the auctions to continue."
 norway.7.b: "Pass the bill and ban the auctions."

 norway.8.t: "The Birth of Bygdefolkets Krisehjelp"
 norway.8.d: "Today, a loose grouping of landowners, farmers and right-wing politicians announced the establishment of Bygdefolkets Krisehjelp. Partly political and partly economic, the goal of the organisation is to oppose the farm auctions and aid farmers in need. Questions have already been raised regarding its independence, as its founders are all members of the party Nasjonal Samling. While some newspapers have praised its creation, others are denouncing the organisation as nothing more than a ploy to increase support for Nasjonal Samling in rural areas."
 norway.8.a: "Unfortunate."

 norway.9.t: "Quisling's Speech"
 norway.9.d: "Vidkun Quisling, a former minister of defence and the leader of the extremely nationalistic party Nasjonal Samling, recently held a public rally. In his speech, Quisling denounced the government for both its handling of the economic crisis and the lack of measures taken against the Norwegian syndicalists. He encouraged his supporters to join Samfundsvernet, a conservative paramilitary organisation, claiming that Samfundsvernet and Nasjonal Samling was Norway's last line of defence against syndicalism."
 norway.9.a: "Last line against syndicalism? Really...?"

 norway.10.t: "Samfundsvernet and the State"
 norway.10.d: "Since Samfundsvernet was founded in 1923, the paramilitary organisation has been a bulwark against syndicalism. Although controlled and supported by conservative and nationalist circles, it was even granted status as reserve-police by the Police Act of 1928. However, Quisling's recent speech has filled its ranks with his supporters and radicalised the organisation. Several voices have raised concern regarding this development and wants us to curtail the organisation."
 norway.10.a: "Revoke their status and suppress the organisation."
 norway.10.b: "They are a defence against Syndicalism."

 norway.11.t: "Failure at Suppression"
 norway.11.d: "Our attempts at suppressing Samfundsvernet have failed. The right-wing parties would not accept any compromise regarding the organisation, while the left-wing parties demanded an outright ban. As a result, we couldn't build a parliamentary majority on the issue."
 norway.11.a: "They will remain a danger..."

 norway.12.t: "The Formation of Red Guards"
 norway.12.d: "Our intelligence service is reporting that the syndicalist parties and trade unions are covertly organising paramilitary red guards. While this is most likely a response to the radicalisation of Samfundsvernet, it is an unsettling development."
 norway.12.a: "What can we do..."

 norway.13.t: "Influence from the UoB"
 norway.13.d: "The Union of Britain has begun influencing our political system. It seems they are supporting syndicalist groupings with funds and attempting to undermine the legitimacy of our democracy in the left-wing press."
 norway.13.a: "Damned syndicalists!"

 norway.14.t: "Stortingsvalget 1936"
 norway.14.d: "Today, the Norwegian people elects a new parliament. The election is tightly fought and will decide the course of Norway in the foreseeable future. There are three possible outcomes. First of all, the radical-socialist Labour Party is campaigning on a platform of socialist reform. The Society Guard has declared that such a victory would force their hand, whatever that means. Another possibility is the social democratic Labour Party in coalition with the Liberal Party. Furthermore, the market liberal Conservatives could gain power with the Farmers party. Who will win?"
 norway.14.a: "The Radical-Socialists wins a Plurality."
 norway.14.b: "The Social-Democrats and Liberals gain a Majority."
 norway.14.c: "The Conservatives and Farmers Party forms a Coalition."

 norway.15.t: "Choosing the Prime Minister"
 norway.15.d: "After gaining a surprising plurality in the election, the Labour party will now attempt to form a minority government. There are two candidates for the post of Prime Minister. Olav Scheflo, the party leader, is the natural choice for the post. However, some are calling for the more moderate Sverre Støstad to lead the government. Who is the new Prime Minister?"
 norway.15.a: "Olav Scheflo, the party chief."
 norway.15.b: "Sverre Støstad, the moderate socialist."

 norway.16.t: "The Conservatives Protest"
 norway.16.d: "The conservative and far-right parties have issued a formal protest against the formation of a radical Labour government. The claim said government is a threat to the stability of the nation and demand that the king appoints someone else. However, the king is not inclined to break with parliamentary procedure and has stated that 'I am also king for the syndicalists'."
 norway.16.a: "It is the will of the people!"

 norway.20.t: "The Opening of the 85th Storting"
 norway.20.d: "Today, the king opened the 85th Storting and announced the political programme of the new government. The transfer of power has been peaceful and the new government will begin its work as soon as possible."
 norway.20.a: "Our democracy is strong."

 norway.22.t: "Governor Rygg Critise the Government"
 norway.22.d: "Nicolai Rygg, former minister of finance and the current governor of the Norwegian Central Bank, has begun to harshly criticise the government in public. According to Rygg, the country is bound for economic devastation and he strongly encourage the opposition to defeat the government. Governor Rygg is quite the influential man and his opposition is bound to be shared by the established political parties."
 norway.22.a: "Why won't he shut up?"

 norway.23.t: "The Scope of Socialist Reform"
 norway.23.d: "With our party in government, we need to decide upon the scope of our reform agenda. As we only have a parliamentary plurality, we would need support from other parties to pass the laws. A majority of our party wants to enact some limited labour legislation, including work hours and safety regulations, that would easily gain support from the social democrats and liberals. A minority believes we should exploit our recent electoral victory and attempt to push for nationalisation of critical industries. While such a plan won't easily pass parliament, it could perhaps garner some support from certain right-wing elements."
 norway.23.a: "Minor Reform. Enact some labour legislation."
 norway.23.b: "Major Reform. Nationalise critical industries."

 norway.24.t: "Quisling and Samfundsvernet Mobilise"
 norway.24.d: "This morning, Vidkun Quisling occupied at studio at the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation and started broadcasting on the radio. He announced that parliament would pass a motion of no confidence against the government the following day. To keep the peace and secure an orderly transition of power, Samfundsvernet would mobilise and protect important public institutions. In the end, Quisling justified these actions by blaming the government for its dangerous, revolutionary plans.\n\nAs the guardsmen took to the street, the police refused to take action. Clashes soon developed between guardsmen and worker's militias as the situation rapidly escalated."
 norway.24.a: "We have a mandate for change!"

 norway.25.t: "The Unions Mobilise"
 norway.25.d: "As the crisis continue to escalate, the trade unions have mobilised and declared a general strike. Martin Tranmæl, one of the most important syndicalist figures in Norway, declared support for the government and denounced the bourgeois opposition. According to Tranmæl, the Labour Party will not be able to stand on its own, while the bourgeois establishment is plotting to crush the organisations of the common man. The worker must now take matters into his own hands, claims Tranmæl.\n\nAs battle rages in the streets of Oslo, it seems that the police and army have orders to remain in their barracks."
 norway.25.a: "The country is holding its breath!"

 norway.26.t: "The Hour of Decision!"
 norway.26.d: "As the battle of Oslo rages for the third day, power hangs in the balance. Both sides have a certain claim to legitimacy and whoever captures the capital will likely control the country. The worker's guards claim to be defending the legitimate government, while Samfundsvernet wish to enable the parliamentary downfall of said government. As the battle reaches its climax..."
 norway.26.a: "The Worker's Militias take the Capital and impeach the bourgeois elements."
 norway.26.b: "Samfundsvernet capture Parliament and Quisling forms a Government."

 norway.27.t: "A Syndicalist Norway"
 norway.27.d: "With the help of the Trade Unionists, the labour government has managed to survive the bourgeois attacks on the rightful government. Now they have the power and capacity to reform Norway in a manner that has not been seen before. At the end of this, Norway will have achieved socialism!"
 norway.27.a: "All Power to the Workers."

 norway.29.t: "A Nationalist Norway"
 norway.29.d: "Vidkun Quisling has formed a national government to combat the syndicalist threat. Today, parliament passed a law granting Quisling the power to enact laws, before Quisling suspended parliament indefinitely. There is no doubt that a new age has come to Norway. Also, the King has fled to Canada."
 norway.29.a: "Order and Justice."

 norway.30.t: "Stortingsvalget [GetYear]"
 norway.30.d: "Today, the Norwegian people elects a new parliament. The election is tightly fought and will decide the course of Norway in the foreseeable future."
 norway.30.a: "The Social-Democrats and Liberals gain a Majority."
 norway.30.b: "The Conservatives and Farmers Party forms a Coalition."

 norway.100.t: "The Oslo Analyser"
 norway.100.d: "The scientist Svein Rosseland recently proposed the construction of a large mechanical computer, The Oslo Analyser. With governmental support, he has now finished the theoretical parts of the project. His team will now attempt to construct this technological marvel. If successful, the computer should greatly increase our research capabilities."
 norway.100.a: "Good luck, Mr. Rosseland!"

 norway.101.t: "The Oslo Analyser Is Complete"
 norway.101.d: "Today, in a ceremony at the University of Oslo, Mr. Rosseland unveiled the Oslo Analyser. Based upon the work of Vannevar Bush and currently the most powerful differential analyser in the world, the machine has twelve integrators and will provide our scientist with unrivalled computing power."
 norway.101.a: "Who needs Konrad Zuse or Alan Turing!"

 norway.112.t: "The DNL Wishes to Expand"
 norway.112.d: "Our recent investments into 'Det Norske Luftfartselskap' has opened up several possibilities for our flag carrier. We could focus on the domestic market and try to bind Norway together by air. By investing in new airports and routes, we can move people, goods and mail much faster. We could also focus on the Scandinavian and North Atlantic market. However, some claim that the risks involved are too large and the possible rewards to small. What course of expansion should we pick?"
 norway.112.a: "Limited Expansion."
 norway.112.b: "Grand Expansion."

 norway.113.t: "The Expansion Is a Success"
 norway.113.d: "The expansion of the DNL has proven to be a success. Most of the flights have been full and the activity on routes between our largest cities have doubled."
 norway.113.a: "Great!"

 norway.114.t: "The Expansion Is a Failure"
 norway.114.d: "The expansion of the DNL has proven to be a failure. The international competition is fierce and the DNL was not able to turn a profit. As a result, it was decided to close down all international flights."
 norway.114.a: "Very Unfortunate Indeed..."

 norway.116.t: "Opening of the Constitutional Convention"
 norway.116.d: "Today marks the opening of the constitutional convention of our young republic. Hundreds of delegates, representing trade unions from all parts of society, have gathered to debate the organisation of the new state. As the Assembly of 1814 created an independent Norwegian kingdom, this convention will found a modern republic. Its achievements will surely impact all parts of society."
 norway.116.a: "An important moment in Norwegian History!"

 norway.117.t: "Day 1. Autonomy for the Local Trade Unions"

 norway.129.d: "To improve our military and change the defensive mindset of our soldiers, the Norwegian army will conduct large scale manoeuvres on the Swedish border."
 norway.129.a: "We'll be ready for the Swedes."

 norway.130.d: "The Norwegian syndicalists have massed their army on our border and conducted war games the latest days. While any aggression would already have taken place, the purpose of the exercises can not be mistaken. The cabinet is divided in regards to our response. Some wish to present an ultimatum to force the Norwegians to back down, while others have proposed holding our own exercises."
 norway.130.a: "Threaten them with war!"
 norway.130.b: "Conduct exercises of our own."

 norway.131.t: "The Swedish Ultimatum"

 norway.134.t: "Our War Games Are a Success"
 norway.134.d: "Our wargames have proved to be a complete success. Our men have come to accept the necessity of liberating our Swedish brothers and army morale is at an all-time high."
 norway.134.a: "Great!"

 norway.139.t: "Kompani Linge in Sweden"
 norway.139.d: "A band of saboteurs and terrorists have recently begun operating in Sweden. 'Kompani Linge', named after some obscure former actor, has already blown up several rail lines and ammunition depots."
 norway.139.a: "They'll have to be dealt with..."
 norway.139.b: "This is quite enough!"

 norway.143.t: "Norway Seeks to Join the [ROOT.GetFactionName]"
 norway.143.d: "Norway, with their new socialist government firmly entrenched, has requested to join our alliance."

 norway.160.t: "State Visit to Canada"
 norway.160.d: "The Norwegian and British royal families have strong family ties, especially since Haakon VII is [CAN_king_full_name]'s uncle through marriage. Recently the Norwegian government has considered approaching the Canadian government regarding closer diplomatic relations. It has recently been suggested to send his majesty on a state visit to Ottawa. The king could bring the matter to the attention of [CAN_king_full_name] and hopefully improve Norway's standing with the Canadian public."
 norway.160.a: "Give our regards to [CAN_king_full_name]"

 norway.161.t: "Norwegian State Visit"
 norway.161.d: "The Norwegian and British royal families have strong family ties, especially since Haakon VII is [CAN_king_full_name]'s uncle through marriage. Recently the Norwegian government has considered approaching the Canadian government regarding closer diplomatic relations. They have therefore decided to send Haakon VII on a state visit to us."
 norway.161.a: "He is most welcome."

 norway.162.t: "King Haakon in Canada"
 norway.162.d: "Haakon VII's visit to Canada has proven a great success. In-between formal receptions and sightseeing, he managed to bring attention to our diplomatic situation. The king also had a very constructive session with his nephew and [CAN_king_first_name] promised to bring the matter to the attention of his ministers."
 norway.162.a: "A great success."

 norway.163.d: "Haakon VII's visit to Canada has proven a great success. In-between formal receptions and sightseeing, he has attempted to showcase the difficult situation of Norway to the Canadian public. The king also had a very constructive session with his nephew and [CAN_king_first_name] apparently promised to bring the matter to the attention of his ministers."

 norway.164.d: "The Kingdom of Norway has approached us with the intention of signing a mutual defence agreement. In practice, the agreement would make Norway a member of the Entente. While we would become responsible for the defence of territories on the European mainland, we would also improve our strategic position. The Norwegian coast is long and crucial to conduct operations into the North Atlantic and the North Sea."

 norway.171.t: "Restarting the Pomor Trade"
 norway.171.d: "After the political and economic chaos of the Russian Civil War, trade between northern Norway and northern Russia has been at a minimum. It seems that Norway has now taken steps to reestablish the trade links by reaching out to local authorities in Murmansk and Arkhangelsk. While they really should have approached central authorities first, the idea of reestablishing the Pomor trade has merit. What shall be our response?"
 norway.171.a: "Encourage the Pomor trade."
 norway.171.b: "No, trade is a governmental matter."

 norway.172.t: "The [GetYear] Norvego-Russian Trade Agreement"
 norway.172.d: "In the end, the Russian government discovered our delegation to the local authorities in Murmansk and Arkhangelsk. Luckily, they thought our suggestions have merit and have agreed to reestablish the Pomor trade."

 norway.173.t: "The Russians Refuse"
 norway.173.d: "In the end, the Russian government discovered our delegation to the local authorities in Murmansk and Arkhangelsk. Unfortunately, they were not interested in our proposal."
 norway.173.a: "Too bad..."

 norway.175.t: "Trade Agreement with Norway"
 norway.175.d: "Norway has recently approached us regarding a limited trade agreement. Since Norway isn't a member of our 'Reichspakt', their trade with continental Europe is very limited. We would normally not allow this, but after Black Monday, the promise of increased trade is tempting."
 norway.175.a: "Yes, we need a limited agreement."
 norway.175.b: "No, politely decline."

 norway.176.t: "The [GetYear] Norvego-German Trade Agreement"

 norway.177.d: "Germany has refused our proposal for a limited trade agreement."

 norway.179.t: "Trade Agreement with Norway"
 norway.179.d: "Norway has recently approached us regarding a trade agreement. They are one of the countries in Europe most geographically close to us, and closing down trade barriers with them would mean better relations and economic growth for both us and the Norwegians. This could also be beneficial in that we would be gaining an economic foothold in Northern Europe, which we could use as a stepping stone for greater ambitions."
 norway.179.a: "Agree to the proposal."
 norway.179.b: "Decline."

 norway.209.b: "No peace, total victory or death!"

 norway.210.t: "Peace with Norway?"
 norway.210.d: "Due to the unfortunate course of the war, the Norwegians are in a position to present terms and have recently sent a peace offer. They want all our Northern Atlantic possessions, but no 'true' Canadian lands. Do we accept?"

 norway.227.a: "It seems we're on our own..."

 norway.320.t: "The Abolition of the Monarchy"
 norway.320.d: "With full control over the politics of Norway, the Labour party steams ahead. Today we declare the People's Republic and Haakon will be removed from his throne. Though the Danish prince proved himself friendly to or at the very least not biased against socialism, the monarchy is an archaic method of the forces of reaction to control the people and must therefore be abolished."
 norway.320.a: "Tranmael will serve as interim chairman."

 norway.321.t: "Norway Sponsors Føderationen"
 norway.321.d: "It has come to our attention that Føderationen, the largest syndicalist organisation in Denmark, has recently received large amount of funds originating from shady sources. Our police has backtracked it to the syndicalist regime present in Norway, doubtlessly in the hopes of imposing their ideology on the Danish people."
 norway.321.a: "This is outrageous!"

 norway.322.t: "The Great Patriotic War"
 norway.322.d: "Once again, the perfidious Swedes are seeking to subdue us Norwegians, only a mere two decades after we finally cast off their yoke. Many Norwegians don't agree with the nature of our government, yet the whole Norwegian nation nearly unanimously despises the idea of a return of the Swedish-Norwegian union.\n\nThroughout Norway, volunteers to fight in our forces are enlisting, ready to confront the menace. And on the homefront, civilians help their soldiers to the best of their ability. While the Swedes outgun us and overpower us in terms of manpower, we shall make up for what we miss materially in spirit!\n\nWe shall go on to the end, we shall fight in Sweden, we shall fight on the seas and oceans, we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air, we shall defend our fylker, whatever the cost may be, we shall fight in the fjords, we shall fight on the border, we shall fight in the forests and in the streets, we shall fight in the mountains; we shall never surrender."
 norway.322.a: "We. Shall. Never. Surrender!"

 norway.323.t: "The End of the Great Patriotic War"
 norway.323.d: "For better or for worse, the great patriotic war has ended. With Sweden no longer actively fighting our nation, the anti-Swedish war enthusiasm is withering away at an ever-increasing pace... Leaving the question in its wake whether the continued wrongdoings between our people will allow for reconciliation, or whether an inherited rivalry has now definitively taken shape..."
 norway.323.a: "At least the war is over..."

 norway.324.t: "Vidkun Quisling's Counter Revolution"
 norway.324.d: "This morning, Vidkun Quisling, an outspoken Norwegian nationalist executed a counter-coup against the recently instated Norwegian syndicalist government with the assistance of the army. Quisling has long been an outspoken critic of any socialist beliefs, and has ran a prominent radio broadcast on his thoughts on the state of the nation, and his steps to destroy socialism. Army units loyal to the syndicalist cause have engaged in sporadic combat with the Norwegian Armed Forces, who have sworn allegiance to their new leader.\nWhile it is believed that there will still be significant opposition to Quisling's regime, escalation to a civil war has been found to be unlikely. As Norway finally gives into its nationalist underbelly, the world can only watch as hallmark of European liberal democracy slips into obscurity."
 norway.324.a: "For better or for worse, Norway's path is\nher own"

### Norwegian Socialism elections ###
 nor_syncon.1.t: "Landsorganisasjonen - Foreign Policy"
 nor_syncon.1.d: "As per the new constitution, the Norwegian Trade Union Confederation has been made the primary democratic institution of the new Norwegian people's state. Today they have assembled for the first time to decide on the foreign policy of this new nation for the coming years. Three factions within the confederation have solidified; the moderates, the closest to a continuation of the Labour Party, led by Einar Gerhardsen, the orthodox syndicalists of the NSF, led by Elias Volan and finally the maximists, basing themselves on the party of the same name in Britain, led by Albin Eines. Today we vote on foreign policy, and all three factions have their own ideas on this matter. The moderates consider the defence of the republic the most important, and call for a defensive attitude, while the syndicalists consider it our sacred duty to help the internationale liberate the rest of the world. Lastly, the totalists want our foreign policy to focus on Sweden, as according to them, our Swedish neighbour could well doom Norway if handled inadequately."
 nor_syncon.1.a: "It is our duty to export the revolution with the Brits and French!"
 nor_syncon.1.b: "The Defence of the Republic is Paramount!"
 nor_syncon.1.c: "Without Sweden pacified, Norway will never be safe!"

 nor_syncon.2.t: "Landsorganisasjonen - Military Matters"
 nor_syncon.2.d: "With the question of foreign policy resolved, the discussion has moved on to military matters. The moderates consider the old manner of military organisation not fit for the revolutionary status quo and want to make officer posts elected amongst the soldiers they lead. The syndicalists fear this will lead to popular but untalented officers to rise to the top at the cost of military efficiency but agree that some kind of democratic control is needed, and therefore argue in favour of reorganising our military into a trade union, where the soldiers elect representatives in a 'board' that instead assigns officers throughout the military. The maximists reject both attempts at democratising the military, which according to them will only result in inefficiency where it is least needed, and defend the status quo, preferring a traditional army."
 nor_syncon.2.a: "The syndicalists control the debate!"
 nor_syncon.2.b: "The moderates win the day!"
 nor_syncon.2.c: "The maximists secure the status quo!"

 nor_syncon.3.t: "Landsorganisasjonen - The Economy"
 nor_syncon.3.d: "Now the confederation has arrived to the matter of the economy. Disturbingly, the three factions once again can't find common ground. The moderates want to nationalise the economy and have them be controlled by way of the government, letting the people influence it through the elections on the central government. The syndicalists reject this idea and argue that the economy should be decentralised instead, letting the workers in one means of production decide over their own production through a trade union instead without influence of the government. The maximists take the middle ground, accepting the syndicalist plan to syndicalise the economy in its entirety but rejecting the notion that these unions should not be bound by government interference, lest they be needed for the national interest."
 nor_syncon.3.a: "A Syndicalised Economy."
 nor_syncon.3.b: "A Nationalised Economy."
 nor_syncon.3.c: "A Guided Syndicalised Economy."

 nor_syncon.4.t: "Landsorganisasjonen - The Youth"
 nor_syncon.4.d: "The confederation agrees that the educational system should be changed as well in the coming years. The syndicalists want to educate the youth about the revolution and socialist thought, and the importance to cherish the freedom the Norwegian worker bled for and to defend it, while the maximists instead want to focus the political curriculum on the general secretary - a cult of personality of sorts. The moderates meanwhile reject the politicisation of the educational system, and argue for it to be purified from elements focused on keeping the proletariat down installed by the plutocratic government of old but that it be kept neutral going from there."
 nor_syncon.4.a: "The Revolution should be cherished by the youth!"
 nor_syncon.4.b: "A neutral and objective educational system is what's needed."
 nor_syncon.4.c: "The youth should venerate the Chairman!"

 nor_syncon.5.t: "Electing the Chairman of the Republic"
 nor_syncon.5.d.totalist: "Against all odds, the once fringe faction of Albin Eines has achieved a total victory during the conference of the Norwegian Trade Union Confederation, the Landsorganisasjonen. As such, it surprised few that Albin Eines run for chairman went unopposed, with the leaders of the other factions unwilling to execute the maximist plans that came out of this conference."
 nor_syncon.5.d.syndicalist: "The Syndicalists stood victorious in several policy debates in the Norwegian Trade Union Confederation. With a majority of their latest proposals having been approved, it turns out that Norway is moving towards an orthodox syndicalist path. Elias Volan is now the only one to realistically become chairman, with the others dropping out or turning out to be too fringe to have a chance."
 nor_syncon.5.d.radical_socialist: "The moderate faction of Einar Gerhardsen had always been the favourite to win in these elections, holding sway among a large part of the Norwegians loyal to the republic. After several successes in the policy debates, Gerhardsen's rivals have caved and dropped out of the race, sitting their opposition to the new government of Norway. The election of Gerhardsen as Norway's chairman is all but assured."
 nor_syncon.5.d.draw_totalist_syndicalist: "Sectarianism clearly runs rife within the Norwegian state, because no majority has been found. As a result, the race for chairman is still extremely competitive, with both the maximist leader Albin Eines and moderate leader Elias Volan still being in it, a surprising turn of events considering the fringeness of the totalist spectre once. The last votes are being tallied and it appears that..."

The last votes are being tallied and it appears that..."
 nor_syncon.5.a: "Albin Eines is the new Chairman!"
 nor_syncon.5.b: "Volan for a safe syndicalist Norway!"
 nor_syncon.5.c: "Gerhardsen shall be a splendid Chairman."
 nor_syncon.5.d: "... Albin Eines is Norway's new chairman."
 nor_syncon.5.e: "... Einar Gerhardsen wins out after all."
