 LOM_rule_of_law: "Re-Establishing the Rule of Law"
 LOM_rule_of_law_desc: "Although we have finally freed ourselves from Republican rule, our nation's future is still in flux. The breakdown of government services has lead to many of our citizens going hungry, and riots have began to break out in the cities. We must have an emergency meeting of local leaders and higher-ups to decide how our country will be ran."
 LOM_building_duchy: "Building a Duchy"
 LOM_building_duchy_desc: "While Lombardia, once preeminent among the Italian lands, maintained some degree of independence until the War of the First Coalition, the old Duchy had been controlled by foreign powers for centuries. To establish a functional state from the carcass of the Republic of Italy, we must remind the people of their illustrious Ducal past."
 LOM_land_reform: "Land Reform"
 LOM_land_reform_desc: "From the Weltkrieg to the Civil War to the collapse of the Republic, we have have seen our fair share of turmoil and war. Although we would all like to move forward, it is a sad fact that our fields and farmers are simply not prepared to sustain our country after being ravaged by two decades of war and unrest. We must begin land reform processes to ensure our people have enough to eat."
 LOM_agricultural_subsidies: "Agricultural Subsidies"
 LOM_agricultural_subsidies_desc: "Although our initial land reform efforts have been successful, it will still take time before farmers are fully accustomed to the new practises.

 LOM_wounds_of_war_desc: "After 20 years of war, the many wounds gouged into Lombardy and her people are finally beginning to recover. However, if we truly wish to mend this trauma, a comprehensive societal and governmental effort will be required- one that our new Duke can be the centre of."

 LOM_universal_suffrage: "A Duchy of the Lombards"
 LOM_universal_suffrage_desc: "While the Duke is undoubtedly virtuous and just, he and the Lombard people alike understand the value of representative government. Absolute rule will no longer be tolerated by the people, and the time has finally come for Lombards to decide their own future."
 LOM_strengthen_duke: "Strengthen the Duke"
 LOM_strengthen_duke_desc: "Lombardia's righteous Duke is like a father to the people. Like any good father, he must at times be firm with his children and guide their development. If justice and good governance are to ever be assured, the Duke must be the ultimate authority in Lombadia."
 LOM_denounce_ambrosia: "Denounce the Golden Ambrosian Idea"
 LOM_denounce_ambrosia_desc: "With the restoration of Lombardia, many Lombard Republicans, undeterred by the failure of their beloved Italian Republic, embraced the legacy of old Ambrosia, a uniquely Lombard strain of Republicanism. We must once and for all repudiate republicanism while also affirming constitutional governance."
 LOM_return_crown: "Request Return of the Lombard Crown"
 LOM_return_crown_desc: "The Iron Crown of Lombardy, inlaid with a Nail of the True Cross, was the centrepiece of the coronation of the old Frankish kings of Italy and later rested upon the heads of Holy Roman Emperors. It was taken by Austria following its victory in the Weltkrieg; with Lombardia no longer in total disrepair, the time has come to request the return of this important symbol of legitimacy and Lombardia itself."
 LOM_crown_king: "Crown the King of the Lombards"
 LOM_crown_king_desc: "With the Iron Crown of Lombardy in our possession and our nation firmly established, the good Duke no longer need be sullied by a title unworthy of a man of such virtue. For his sake and our people's, let us proclaim the Kingdom of [ITA.GetNonIdeologyName]."

 LOM_question_of_radicals: "A Question of Radicals"
 LOM_question_of_radicals_desc: "Within our nation there are certain circles that aim for a more... radical form of governance, the largest of them being the Lega Longobarda.

 LOM_republic_constitution: "The Republican Constitution"
 LOM_republic_constitution_desc: "The Lombard people are desperate for a return to normalcy, and it is our duty to provide it to them. The time has come to write a new constitution, one which protects our Republican ideals and enshrines the rights of the Lombard people."

 LOM_heart_of_the_north: "Heart of the North"
 LOM_heart_of_the_north_desc: "Although our country is small, the Po valley we are situated in has long been the industrial centre of Italy.

 LOM_golden_ambrosia: "The Golden Ambrosia Idea"
 LOM_golden_ambrosia_desc: "The Golden Ambrosia Republic was a brief period where Milan existed as a republic, free of the burdens of aristocracy. This uniquely Langobard idea must be revived- only once the nobility has been driven out of Lombardy shall our people truly be free."
 LOM_work_with_nobility: "A Republican Nobility"
 LOM_work_with_nobility_desc: "The aristocracy remains a powerful force in Lombardia, and we cannot entertain the idea of driving them out. We should establish a House of Lords similar to the one in the former United Kingdom to ensure noble voices are heard."
 LOM_republican_cause: "Stamp Out Monarchism"

 LOM_place_in_the_world: "Lombardy's Place in the World"
 LOM_place_in_the_world_desc: "As a newly founded nation, many of the more well-established countries of the world are wary to lend their support to us. We must show the world that we have as much a place as any other nation, and forge new alliances."
 LOM_securing_milan: "Fortress Milan"
 LOM_securing_milan_desc: "As one of the largest cities in the whole of the Italian Peninsula, special measures must be taken to ensure the safety of Milan. Fortunately, the newly-founded nobility of Lombardy agrees with us on this, and has generously decided to invest in arms manufacturing in and around the city."
 LOM_republic_triumphant: "The Republic Triumphant"

 LOM_extinguish_flames: "Extinguish the Flames of Republicanism"
 LOM_extinguish_flames_desc: "Wherever one looks, they see the failures of republicanism. The Italian Republic lies shattered, Russia is a shambling shell of the great power it once was, and even the once-mighty United States lies teetering on the edge of civil war. We must crush any remaining republican movements in our country, lest we end up like them."
 LOM_encourage_nationalism: "Encourage Lombard Nationalism"
 LOM_encourage_nationalism_desc: "The Lombard people have witnessed defeat after defeat and suffered countless tragedy in recent years.

 LOM_lombard_youth: "Youth Lombard League"
 LOM_lombard_youth_desc: "In the hearts of its youth is a nation's integrity reinforced or destroyed. To build a stronger nation, the young of Lombardia must be instilled with national pride and an unwavering moral rectitude. A national organisation for the promotion of such qualities should be established immediately."
 LOM_forts: "Stengthen the Border"
 LOM_forts_desc: "The syndicalists to the south pose a grave danger to the existence of Lombardy, vastly outnumbering us both in population and industry. If Lombardy is to survive the upcoming war, we must invest into an extensive line of forts along the Po River."
 LOM_economic_reorganization: "Economic Reorganisation"

 LOM_repair: "Repair Efforts"

 LOM_milan_factory: "Expand Milanese Industrial Capacity"
 LOM_milan_factory_desc: "Milan, Lombardia's capital and industrial heart, due to its proximity to the Ticino River, sustained significant damage in the Italian Civil War. Now, this great city may at last be rebuilt and its industry expanded."

 LOM_nonrepublican_schools_desc: "The threat of radicalism can only be fully ended if our nation's youth have the fortitude to reject its corruption. Our schools must instil values and represent political ideologies that do not work contrary to our nation's interests."
 LOM_education_reform: "The University of Milan"
 LOM_education_reform_desc: "Milan's university has been a shining centre of learning for hundreds of years. The time has come to fully promote it and incorporate its research into a broader national system."

 LOM_patronage: "Patron of the Arts and Sports"
 LOM_patronage_desc: "Our leader [LOM.GetLeader] is truly a Renaissance Man, and among his many passions are the arts and the art of sport.

We should give further state support to these areas and ensure the contentment of our people."
 LOM_industrious_people: "An Industrious People"
 LOM_industrious_people_desc: "Throughout history, Lombardia has been an economic powerhouse. With some encouragement and government investment, there is no reason why we cannot be one today as well."

 LOM_longobards_desc: "The Longobards, for whom Lombardia is named, were a Germanic people who conquered much of Italy in the sixth century.

 LOM_new_army: "Re-Establishing the Army of the Lombards"
 LOM_new_army_desc: "Our young nation has many old Italian divisions, it is true, but they are not loyal to the Lombard state that we are now. We must work to create a capable domestic military free of Italian influence if we want to survive against the more powerful Italian states."
 LOM_officer_school: "Gian Galleazzo Officer School"
 LOM_officer_school_desc: "Much like Gian Galleazzo, the first Duke of Milan, had a dream of uniting Northern Italy and reviving the Lombard Empire, we dream of one day seeing a reunited Italy.

 LOM_equipment_purchase: "Equipment Purchases"
 LOM_equipment_purchase_desc: "It pains us to look for our arms from elsewhere, but Lombardia currently does not have the capacity to manufacture a great deal of its own weaponry. Until this changes, we should look to purchase foreign arms and equipment."
 LOM_heavy_armaments: "Heavy Armaments Industry"

 LOM_recruitment: "Recruitment Efforts"
 LOM_recruitment_desc: "While modern warfare is defined by of machines and industry, an army cannot function without men. We should capitalise on the scores of young men inspired by our efforts to revive Lombard nationalism to pad out our army."
 LOM_drill: "Drill the Troops into Shape!"
 LOM_drill_desc: "Our troops lack experience, and while training is no replacement for actual combat, to make up for the small size of our armed forces, our green units must be as prepared for war as is possible. To accomplish this, we must hire new drill instructors."

 LOM_superior_fire_power: "Armaments Above All"
 LOM_superior_fire_power_desc: "We shall never have the manpower to fight a prolonged conflict with the great powers of the world, so our nation's industry must become the lynchpin of our national defence.

 LOM_grand_battle_plan: "Outsmart the Enemy"
 LOM_grand_battle_plan_desc: "We may not have the manpower to fight toe to toe with stronger nations, but with good enough tactics, we don't need to. We should focus on teaching the most innovative strategies and tactics possible to our officers to defeat numerically superior foes."

 LOM_defend_the_coast_desc: "The new navy should be oriented towards the protection of our coastline and disruption of enemy merchant fleets."

 lombardy.1.d.sic: "The Iron Crown of Lombardy, which sat upon the heads of Holy Roman Emperors for centuries, was taken by Austria in the Weltkrieg. Following Austria's recent collapse, an agent of the Bourbon kingdom in the south spirited it away to Naples. While we are unable to force the Bourbons to return it, they may be amicable should we request the crown's return."
 lombardy.1.d.vienna: "The Iron Crown of Lombardy, which sat upon the heads of Holy Roman Emperors for centuries, was taken by Austria in the Weltkrieg. With Austria under occupation, perhaps the occupiers will return in to us."

 lombardy.20.t: "The Question of Radicals"
 lombardy.20.d: "Within our nation there are certain circles that aim for a more... radical form of governance, the largest of them being the Lega Longobarda. It was the rise of groups similar to these that lead to the downfall of the Republic of Italy, and if we want to avoid a similar fate we must grapple with the question of if we should ban these radical groups to protect our young democracy, or if we must let them grow in the name of free speech and liberty."

 lombardy.21.t: "Lombardia's Future"
 lombardy.21.d: "The government of Lombardia is currently in the hands of the military, which supports Duke Marcello Visconti... but the duke has expressed reservations about taking full control of the country. Despite the protests of some who say republicanism failed Italy, the duke maintains that the time for monarchies in Italy has also passed. Still, there are many in the country who support him and suggest his guidance is what the people want."
 lombardy.21.a: "Republicanism cannot be trusted"
 lombardy.21.b: "The Duke must step down"

 lombardy.22.t: "Lombardia's Future"
 lombardy.22.d: "Lombardia is in a state of turmoil, and the people currently have a great distrust of republicanism. Many are openly expressing a preference for Marcello Visconti, the Count of Milan, to take his place as the ruler of Lombardia - and he certainly has the military's support. He also does not seem like a man who much wants to rule, so it seems likely he would turn the country over to elections anyhow... but can we trust that? Should we not pursue republicanism, so long as it is in our grasp?"
 lombardy.22.a: "We must turn to the Count for help"
 lombardy.22.b: "No, we cannot turn back to the monarchy"
