 LOM_denounce_ambrosia_desc: "With the restoration of Lombardia, many Lombard Republicans, undeterred by the failure of their beloved Italian Republic, embraced the legacy of old Ambrosia, a uniquely Lombard strain of Republicanism.

 LOM_return_crown_desc: "The Iron Crown of Lombardy, inlaid with a Nail of the True Cross, was the centrepiece of the coronation of the old Frankish kings of Italy and later rested upon the heads of Holy Roman Emperors.

 LOM_question_of_radicals: "A Question of Radicals"
 LOM_question_of_radicals_desc: "The first question facing our young republic is the place of radicals within it, such as those in the Lego Longobarda. Are we a free state, or should we be more cautious in the voices we give to those who might lead our country astray?"

 LOM_golden_ambrosia_desc: "The Golden Ambrosia Republic was a brief period where Milan existed as a republic, free of the burdens of aristocracy.

 LOM_work_with_nobility: "The Place of the Nobility"
 LOM_work_with_nobility_desc: "The aristocracy remains a powerful force in Lombardia, and we cannot entertain the idea of driving them out. We should establish a separate house of government for our lords, and work with them to build a better future for the country."

 LOM_lombard_youth: "Youth Lombard League"
 LOM_lombard_youth_desc: "In the hearts of its youth is a nation's integrity reinforced or destroyed.

 LOM_forts: "Stengthen the Border"

 LOM_economic_reorganization: "Economic Reorganisation"

 LOM_patronage: "Patron of the Arts and Sports"
 LOM_patronage_desc: "Our leader [LOM.GetLeader] is truly a Renaissance Man, and among his many passions are the arts and the art of sport.

### Events ###
 lombardy.1.t: "Request the Crown of Lombardy"
 lombardy.1.d.aus: "The Iron Crown of Lombardy, which sat upon the heads of Holy Roman Emperors for centuries, was taken by Austria in the Weltkrieg. While we are unable to force Austria to return it, they may be amicable should we request the crown's return."
 lombardy.1.d.sic: "The Iron Crown of Lombardy, which sat upon the heads of Holy Roman Emperors for centuries, was taken by Austria in the Weltkrieg. Following Austria's recent collapse, an agent of the Bourbon kingdom in the south spirited it away to Naples. While we are unable to force the Bourbons to return it, they may be amicable should we request the crown's return."
 lombardy.1.d.vienna: "The Iron Crown of Lombardy, which sat upon the heads of Holy Roman Emperors for centuries, was taken by Austria in the Weltkrieg. With Austria under occupation, perhaps the occupiers will return in to us."
 lombardy.1.a: "Surely the Austrians will heed us."
 lombardy.1.b: "Surely the Bourbons will heed us."
 lombardy.1.c: "Surely they will heed us."

 lombardy.2.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] requests the Crown of Lombardy"
 lombardy.2.d: "The Iron Crown of Lombardy, which sat upon the heads of Holy Roman Emperors for centuries, was taken by Austria in the Weltkrieg. The Duke of Lombardia has personally requested the return of the crown in order so that he may be crowned King."
 lombardy.2.a: "Return the Crown."
 lombardy.2.b: "Keep the Crown."

 lombardy.3.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] agrees to return the Iron Crown"

 lombardy.3.a: "A great day!"

 lombardy.4.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] refuses to return the Iron Crown"

 lombardy.6.t: "Hiring new Drill Instructors"

 lombardy.6.a: "Prussian drill is superior."
 lombardy.6.b: "Local instructors will motivate our troops."

 lombardy.7.t: "Lombardia is hiring retired Prussian Generals"
 lombardy.7.d: "Lombardia has been hiring a large number of retired Generals from the Weltkrieg to provide their undisciplined troops with proper Prussian drills. While this has greatly improved their combat readiness, it has also instilled a germanophile spirit in their general staff that is beginning to affect their foreign policy."
 lombardy.7.a: "This could be to our advantage."

 lombardy.8.t: "Lombardy wishes to purchase small arms"
 lombardy.8.d: "Our puppet, Lombardia, wishes to purchase small arms from us at a discounted rate."

 lombardy.15.b: "... the Partito Liberale Lombardo"
 lombardy.15.c: "... the Partito Popolare Lombardo"
 lombardy.15.e: "... the Lega Longobarda"
 lombardy.15.f: "... the Lega Democratica Riformista"

 lombardy.20.t: "The Question of Radicals"
 lombardy.20.d: "One question our republic must immediately face is what we will do about the radicals which are already forming in the young Longobard League - or Lega Longobarda. A party dedicated, on the surface, to Lombard nationalism, they are drawing their members from the likes of the former ANI and even, it is suspected, a number of syndicalist sympathisers who would be more than happy to see the republic fall apart. Perhaps this isn't true, and we should allow the League their say. There are many, however, who say we must stand up against the sort of dissenters who destroyed the Italian Republic, before it's too late."
 lombardy.20.a: "There is no place for radicals in this republic"
 lombardy.20.b: "We stand for freedom above all else"

 lombardy.21.t: "Lombardia's Future"
 lombardy.21.d: "The government of Lombardia is currently in the hands of the military, which supports Duke Adriano Visconti... but the duke has expressed reservations about taking full control of the country. Despite the protests of some who say republicanism failed Italy, the duke maintains that the time for monarchies in Italy has also passed. Still, there are many in the country who support him and suggest his guidance is what the people want."
 lombardy.21.a: "Republicanism cannot be trusted"
 lombardy.21.b: "The Duke must step down"

 lombardy.22.t: "Lombardia's Future"
 lombardy.22.d: "Lombardia is in a state of turmoil, and the people currently have a great distrust of republicanism. Many are openly expressing a preference for Adriano Visconti, the Count of Milan, to take his place as the ruler of Lombardia - and he certainly has the military's support. He also does not seem like a man who much wants to rule, so it seems likely he would turn the country over to elections anyhow... but can we trust that? Should we not pursue republicanism, so long as it is in our grasp?"
 lombardy.22.a: "We must turn to the Count for help"
 lombardy.22.b: "No, we cannot turn back to the monarchy"
