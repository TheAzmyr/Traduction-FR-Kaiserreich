 TEX_Moseley_plan2: "Moseley Reform Plan"
 TEX_Moseley_plan2_desc: "The first step in Moseley's plan to reform the military is to take a tally of the officers deserving of promotion for heroism and those deserving of demotion for immorality. Those deserving will be recalled to the capital to receive new guidelines Moseley has developed."
 TEX_Moseley_plan3: "Moseley Reform Plan"
 TEX_Moseley_plan3_desc: "The second step for Moseley is to assess the state of the forts and weapon stocks scattered across the country. It will be very difficult to centralise our resources if we cannot locate them in an emergency."
 TEX_Moseley_plan4: "Moseley Reform Plan"
 TEX_Moseley_plan4_desc: "With the officers now galvanised and communication secured, it is time for Moseley to arrange the order of battle around the national strategy. This may disappoint generals who enjoyed the rabble of the civil war, but this is progress."

 TEX_Moseley_plan5_desc: "With Moseley's reforms finished, our army now stands at the forefront of military tactics and organisation, with an expanded logistical service and fast-reacting command chains that allow us not only to plan ahead of the battle but to also react fast enough to enemy movement as to always be prepared."

 TEX_Danford_plan4: "Danford Reform Plan"
 TEX_Danford_plan4_desc: "With the officers now informed and our weapons stocked, it is time for Danford to arrange the order of battle around the national strategy. This may disappoint generals who enjoyed abusing their authority to make risky manoeuvres, but this is progress."
 TEX_Danford_plan5: "Danford Reform Plan"
 TEX_Danford_plan5_desc: "With Danford' reforms finished, our army now stands at the forefront of military tactics and organisation, with an expanded logistical service and the latest in force weaponry, we will be able to respond to any threat, no matter how many enemies they send after us."

 TEX_Patton_plan1_desc: "With Approval of the Government, General Patton has begun reorganising the military and centralising the command structure. Soon our army will be able to evolve warfare through mobile artillery and superior armour."
 TEX_Patton_plan2: "Patton Reform Plan"
 TEX_Patton_plan2_desc: "The first step in Patton's plan to reform the military is to take a tally of the officers deserving of promotion for heroism and those deserving of demotion for shellshock. Those deserving will be recalled to the capital to receive new guidelines Patton has developed."

 TEX_Patton_plan3_desc: "The second step for Patton is to assess the state of the forts and vehicles scattered across the country. It will be very difficult to lead a charge if our armour runs out of gas."
 TEX_Patton_plan4: "Patton Reform Plan"
 TEX_Patton_plan4_desc: "With the officers now slapped and our vehicles refuelled, it is time for Patton to arrange the order of battle around the national strategy. No front will be safe from the enemy, so we should make it unsafe for the enemy everywhere. "
 TEX_Patton_plan5: "Patton Reform Plan"
 TEX_Patton_plan5_desc: "With Patton's reforms finished, our army now stands at the forefront of military tactics and organisation, with an expanded logistical service and a safer soldier, we are ready to venture onto the battlefield already victorious."

 TEX_american_auto_industry_desc: "The American automotive industry, while enthusiastic to assist in the war effort, is still developing a way to respond to the newly-ruined roads we tread."
 TEX_american_auto_industry2: "American Automobile Industry"
 TEX_american_auto_industry2_desc: "While the roads may still be shattered, thanks to the auto manufacturers we can still reach our destination and keep that new car smell."

### Huey Long Path ###
 TEX_every_man_a_king: "Every Man a King"
 TEX_every_man_a_king_desc: "What began as a dream and lifted from a motivational book by Orison Swett Mardin, Every Man a King is now a political reality. It is positive thinking and the end of pessimistic greed that caused the Great Depression that will save America. Following Huey Long's economic and social plans to transform America and rewrite the political landscape."

 TEX_patriotic_mass_education: "Patriotic Mass Education"
 TEX_patriotic_mass_education_desc: "Across this great nation there are millions more children struggling to resume normal life and facing a future no better than that of their parents without education. President Long has approved the bill Congress sped through to rebuild schools and reopen colleges for Americans in need. Making sure that the curriculum teaches them the correct ideas, of course."

 TEX_for_the_poor_man: "For the Poor Man"
 TEX_for_the_poor_man_desc: "Now the president has brought to Congress legislation to furnish a homestead allowance of 1/3rd the average wealth. A guaranteed annual income of $$2000 and old-age pensions is ready to be distributed to loyal Americans. Until such a time when the proper income tax changes are made, these benefits are coming out of the National Treasury."

 TEX_federal_farm_grants: "Federal Farm Grants"
 TEX_federal_farm_grants_desc: "While few made it through the civil war unscathed, perhaps the heaviest hit were the farmers. Marauding armies would frequently make it a point to burn fields as they went in order to prevent the enemy from gaining the spoils come harvest time. The Farm Bureau must be allocated additional funding to relieve the nation's farmers!"

 TEX_war_on_disease: "War on Disease"
 TEX_war_on_disease_desc: "It is a great crime that proper healthcare in this country is limited to just the wealthy few at the top. That you can still find people priced out from health care in the 20th century in a premiere country is inconceivable. Reform is drastically needed to ensure adequate access to health care for all Americans!"

 TEX_target_the_picket_line: "Target the Picket Line"
 TEX_target_the_picket_line_desc: "The American dream was built on the character of those who traveled to America to create a better life for their community and worked hard to make it happen. As such, there is nothing more un-American than to take to the picket line and refuse to work. Strikes were pivotal in creating the chaos of 1937, and cannot be allowed to remain a legal activity."

 TEX_minuteman_law_enforcement: "Minuteman Law Enforcement"
 TEX_minuteman_law_enforcement_desc: "In order to preserve the integrity of our armed forces, we must expand the Minutemen into the field of civil protection and border monitoring. The insurgent socialists and MacArthurites don't adhere to the rules of engagement anymore, therefore we must prepare for any level of brutality on their part."

 TEX_root_out_traitors: "Root Out Traitors"
 TEX_root_out_traitors_desc: "The ideological fight against the political and social enemies of America has been done thus far with welfare and incentives. Now President Long is ready to pull punches against the social resistance to Share the Wealth. We must use every measure possible to stop the boat of the nation from turning over."

 TEX_defang_the_klan: "Defang the Klan"
 TEX_defang_the_klan_desc: "Hiram Wesley Evans and his cadre of his Grand Wizards are finally arrested and brought to trial for their terroristic actions. Murders, lynchings, and voter intimidation is being brought against this most dangerous group of traitors. With their conviction we have finally pacified the most extreme that sought to poison the America First Party."

 TEX_four_day_work_week: "4-Day Work Week"
 TEX_four_day_work_week_desc: "A controversial position, but one that Huey Long has supported since the early 1930's. Starting with select government positions, the 30 hour week experiment will grant these employees the ability to more freely enjoy the outdoors, travel, and otherwise stimulate the economy through consumer spending across the country."

 TEX_industrial_direction_board: "Industrial Direction Board"
 TEX_industrial_direction_board_desc: "It is clear that the great unchecked American experiment of capitalism has run its course. Instead of facilitating the American dream, greedy robber barons hoarded wealth into their own pockets. A committee must be made to help oversee the great companies of America and direct industrial expansion to serve the people."

 TEX_state_public_works_projects: "State Public Works Projects"
 TEX_state_public_works_projects_desc: "With much of the country under ruin from the fighting of the civil war, there is plenty of work to be done. To fight two problems at once, large public works projects dedicated to restoring broken infrastructure will be initiated to provide employment to those who find themselves unemployed."

 TEX_freeze_commodity_prices: "Freeze Commodity Prices"
 TEX_freeze_commodity_prices_desc: "In the post civil war economy, many unscrupulous individuals have sought to enrich themselves at the expense of their neighbour. Middlemen purchasing food in bulk for resale are a scourge on the country. Accordingly, the government must step in to ensure that all citizens have access to essential commodities."

 TEX_collaborate_with_the_establishment: "Collaborate with the Establishment"
 TEX_collaborate_with_the_establishment_desc: "With a failure to follow-through on many of the overly ambitious programs that Long promised the people in the mid 1930's, it may be time to begin offering feelers to former allies in the establishment. While they may have been on the wrong side of the civil war once, who says amnesty can't be found?"

 TEX_agricultural_adjusment_act: "Agricultural Adjusment Act"
 TEX_agricultural_adjusment_act_desc: "Even with most farms converting towards staple crops, we still find ourselves with plenty of cash crop farmers. Faced with competition from Egypt and India, the Department of Agriculture has come up with a plan to force partial burns of crops in order to drive up their price."

 TEX_detente_with_big_business: "Detente with Big Business"
 TEX_detente_with_big_business_desc: "Faced with the dauntless task of finding room in the budget for such ambitious programs like the Homestead Credit were daunting tasks facing Long. Even with huge taxes levied on corporations, the programme would struggle to balance the books. Instead, it would be more prudent to work with big business to raise the common workers wages."

 TEX_capitol_hill_conference: "Capitol Hill Conference"
 TEX_capitol_hill_conference_desc: "Savvy enough to know when brute force is not the ticket to win the day, President Long has called for a conference of the leading representatives of the establishment parties. It is hoped that the legislative and executive branch leadership can come to alignment on many of the prominent issues of the day."

 TEX_guide_american_democracy: "Guide American Democracy"
 TEX_guide_american_democracy_desc: "It is clear that America is too diverse of a country to be adequately governed by a single mass party. Instead, the triumvirate of the three great parties in American politics must learn to share power and work together for the good of the people they were elected to serve!"

 TEX_protect_the_elections: "Protect the Elections"
 TEX_protect_the_elections_desc: "Rampant voter intimidation at the polls in 1936 led to a great number of spoiled ballots, particularly among the rust belt, where socialist militias found huge scores of votes for Reed. In order to combat this, we must station loyal Minutemen across the country to make sure that no one can intimidate voters at the polls."

 TEX_washingtons_inheritor: "Washington's Inheritor"
 TEX_washingtons_inheritor_desc: "It is the hope of Huey Long to fully embrace his role as the heir to Washington. Just as Washington fought against the creation of competing political parties in his farewell address, so too should we encourage our allies in the Republican and Democratic parties to break ranks and join the united America First Party that stands for all!"

 TEX_war_hero_repayment_act: "War Hero Repayment Act"
 TEX_war_hero_repayment_act_desc: "With the conclusion of the civil war, many of our young men are coming home to either destroyed farms or discovering that others have taken their jobs during the fighting. To leave them out to dry would be an utter disrespect to their service to the nation. We must enact legislation that gives preferential hiring privileges to those who defended us in our darkest hour."

 TEX_the_presidents_share_of_the_wealth: "The President's Share of the Wealth"
 TEX_the_presidents_share_of_the_wealth_desc: "The expenses the president has taken out for Every Man a King requires a fundamentally different means of tax collection and public financing to sustain itself. Therefore, President Long has laid out a road-map to plan out spending for the next four years of his term and milestones that America should cross."

 TEX_the_young_minutemen: "The Young Minutemen"
 TEX_the_young_minutemen_desc: "The orphans of the Civil War need not only education to uplift themselves, but discipline as well. A visit to Boys Town near Omaha Nebraska has inspired President Long to create the National Youth Administration. A work training and activism group for young Americans that gives orphans a place to stay and trains them in important life skills."

 TEX_the_american_progress: "The American Progress"
 TEX_the_american_progress_desc: "In order to win over the hearts and minds of the American people, we must be sure that they are constantly hearing of our grand plans to lift them up. The American Progress creates a federal agency for radio and television broadcasting. Regulations will require networks give airtime for government use in case of emergency and to broadcast future victories."

### George Van Horn Moseley Path ###
 TEX_the_business_plot: "The Business Plot"
 TEX_the_business_plot_desc: "In order to keep the reputation of the War Powers Committee away from the public eye, we have chosen to extend the facade of the 'Arsenal of the Republic' into the new America. The saved United States will return to the fundamental values of our Founding Fathers, and clearly say to the world that America is a Republic, not a Democracy."
 TEX_use_the_fbi: "Use the FBI"
 TEX_use_the_fbi_desc: "J. Edgar Hoover understands the needs of the new American Republic to safeguard against traitors. The cooperation of the FBI is also popularly received as it signals stability. We can trust the FBI to weed out traitors wherever they hide. If J. Edgar ever steps out of line, his relationship with Clyde Tolson will be public knowledge."
 TEX_alien_and_sedition_act: "New Alien and Sedition Acts"
 TEX_alien_and_sedition_act_desc: "One of the most important acts of the early American Republic was the Aliens and Sedition Act passed by President John Adams, a wise statesman. We must revive the Act to protect true Americans from syndicalist infiltrators. Firstly, being a danger to public safety or national integrity is now grounds for imprisonment and deportation."
 TEX_cointelpro: "COINTELPRO"
 TEX_cointelpro_desc: "The success of the New Aliens and Sedition Act has allowed us to identify several non-political and religious organisations with known syndicalist members. These groups will be monitored under the new COINTELPRO program, a the first fully empowered counterintelligence programme capable of monitoring communications between group members."
 TEX_purge_dissidents: "Reform AFP Principles"
 TEX_purge_dissidents_desc: "Through the Aliens and Sedition Act we have gathered a list of known enemies of the War Powers Committee. They are welfare Longists, anti-progress religious fundamentalists, and mutualists. We are prepared to arrest every ground member and have prepared to export certain as-of-yet untouchable politicians who support these dissidents."
 TEX_office_of_policy_coordination: "Office of Policy Coordination"
 TEX_office_of_policy_coordination_desc: "The Office of Policy Coordination, or OPC, was proposed as a means to influence local politics in our favour through agent provocateurs, small scale sanctions, and directly sabotage. The OPC will enable us to softly muscle out radicals and indignant federalists that wish to re-enter the US government on their terms."
 TEX_the_black_chamber: "The Black Chamber"
 TEX_the_black_chamber_desc: "Another safety objective is to revitalise the Black Chamber with something Vannevar Bush calls Memex. It is a hypothetical system that would be able to store and transmit microfilm and make information search-able from a station that is connected through telephone wire to other stations. This proposed plan could lead us to a golden age of security."
 TEX_american_nationalism: "American Nationalism"
 TEX_american_nationalism_desc: "The American Dream, or Creed, or even Ideal is the often-described glue that holds together our national integrity and prevents civil disturbances. The cascade of failure that was epitomised by Hoover and turned over by Huey Long is now fertile for our country to replant American Nationalism."
 TEX_the_american_legion: "The American Legion"
 TEX_the_american_legion_desc: "The end of Huey Long would have ended in disaster if not for the brave veterans of the American Legion. It was the American Legion under Moseley that stood tall when public hysteria grew against syndicalists. It was also the American Legion that convinced Huey Long's Minutemen bodyguards to take that necessary detour. The American Legion should be empowered to prevent any traitors from threatening our Republic again."

 TEX_nationalize_boy_scouts: "Control the Boy Scouts"
 TEX_nationalize_boy_scouts_desc: "Patriotic youth organisations have existed in Europe for decades. Our own Boy Scouts of America are an untapped well of support for the country to encourage loyalty in Americans subtlety. The War Powers Committee authorises the appropriation of the Boy Scouts facility to educate and foster true Republicanism."
 TEX_fordism: "Fordism"
 TEX_fordism_desc: "Although scientific management was not invented by Henry Ford, it was Ford that proved that measuring time spent on work tasks could lead to faster and more efficient time management. To thank our Committee member Ford, we have granted him the intellectual property over the assembly line method, as well as promoted it in publications."
 TEX_american_capitalism1: "American Capitalism"
 TEX_american_capitalism1_desc: "Our country is a capitalist nation, and through the War Powers Committee we can revitalise the age of progress that dissidents and populists intended to destroy. Through our loyal Congressmen, Business Councils will be formed again in the Capitol, taxes will be lowered, and the stock market will be made safe from terrorism."
 TEX_capitalist_education: "Create the ESMWT"
 TEX_capitalist_education_desc: "The Engineering, Science, and Management War Training, or ESMWT, is the brainchild of the Department of Commerce to decentralise technological changes. Instead of cooperation that would disrupt competition and give an unfair advantage to certain businesses, this programme disburses its findings freely to the public."
 TEX_captains_of_industry: "Captains of Industry"
 TEX_captains_of_industry_desc: "Without the noble self-sacrifice of the Captains of Industry, America would have been lost. We should push through Congress a new income tax bracket for those earning more than $$10 million dollars annually. With many exceptions designed to give these useful industrialists tax breaks if they are engaged in philanthropy."
 TEX_industrial_security_act: "Industrial Security Act"
 TEX_industrial_security_act_desc: "The need for work-site security has never been greater. The average working man is besieged by syndicalist infiltrators, Longist provocateurs, and federalist malcontents. We need to authorise the use of strikebreakers and integrate our loyal American Legionaries into the new National Guard so as to quickly respond to industrial sabotage."
 TEX_pass_nira: "National Labor Control Act"
 TEX_pass_nira_desc: "A permanent solution to the labour crisis has presented itself in the form of then executive order by [Root.GetLeader] to set up a National Labor Control Bureau. The NLRB will remedy unfair labour practices by both unions and business owners. The impartial wording of the agency has received widespread support from third parties."
 TEX_red_scare: "Red Scare"
 TEX_red_scare_desc: "The FBI has announced that after many months of searching for President Long, he can no longer be presumed alive. The uproar against any socialist groups remaining in America is enormous. The War Powers Committee can barely keep up with all the state laws being passed to stop socialism. Public approval for [Root.GetLeader] is at an all-time high."
 TEX_traditional_values: "Traditional Values"
 TEX_traditional_values_desc: "An address by President [Root.GetLeader] has denounced the changes of the last thirty years as the agenda of foreigners that sought to destroy America's industrious nature. The press is divided between those that know [ROOT.GetLeader] as an anti-semite canard and those who truly believe in America. Nevertheless, the public loves it."
 TEX_republic_without_democracy: "Republic without Democracy"
 TEX_republic_without_democracy_desc: "The American public is now in agreement that Huey Long's true vision of America was that of a Republic without Democracy. [TEX.GetLeader]'s term has been extended for another four years due to the continued emergency that threatens the American continent. Americanism as the War Powers Committee sees it grows as the term oligarchy loses its stigma."

### Martin Dies Path ###
 TEX_in_defence_of_the_republic: "A Sentinel of the Republic"
 TEX_in_defence_of_the_republic_desc: "It is the sacred duty of the true American patriot to exemplify the virtues of the early republican farmer of ancient Rome. A warrior once summoned, but simultaneously a dutiful and productive member of society keeping the economic engine running at full capacity."
 TEX_loyalty_oaths: "Affadavits and Oaths"
 TEX_loyalty_oaths_desc: "The civil war has deeply shaken the people's trust in the government. In order to restore our image in the eyes of the people, we must limit access to governmental positions unless said civil servant has taken an oath of loyalty to stay true to keeping the government intact. All labour leaders will also be required to sign affadavits affirming they do not belong to any syndicalist organisation currently in opposition to the US Government."
 TEX_empower_the_huac: "Empower the HUAC"
 TEX_empower_the_huac_desc: "Various rumours abound about secret plots and conspiracies to overthrow our government. In order to discover the true extent of these claims, we must empower the House Un-American Activities Committee to perform a thorough examination of government agents all the way up to the top to root out any traitors among us."
 TEX_strategic_blacklisting: "The Patriotic Education Guild"
 TEX_strategic_blacklisting_desc: "Those uncovered by the HUAC and found guilty by the Department of Justice can not be allowed to continue to hold any office in the country. We must remove them from power and ban them from ever again seeking office. After all, who can trust a traitor?"
 TEX_expand_the_fbi: "Expand The FBI"
 TEX_expand_the_fbi_desc: "The mission of the FBI is as follows: To protect the American people and uphold the Constitution of the United States. No motto is needed more in this country than that of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Through additional funding, we shall ensure that the FBI gets every resource and more that they need to fulfil their motto."
 TEX_cointelpro_ade: "COINTELPRO"
 TEX_cointelpro_ade_desc: "With the additional resources dedicated to them, the FBI is now more equipped to thoroughly go after subversive groups hiding in the United States. This Counter Intelligence Program will seek to infiltrate, discredit, and disrupt any anti-American forces operating domestically."

 TEX_encourage_natalism: "The Mother's Movement"
 TEX_encourage_natalism_desc: "America was the first country in the world to commit to honouring the important role that women play in the holiday, Mother's Day. We must encourage the patriotic women of this country to continue to strive for motherhood via a series of tax breaks and incentives that benefit the families who continue to create the next great generation of Americans!"
 TEX_expand_powers_of_congress: "Expand Congressional Powers"
 TEX_expand_powers_of_congress_desc: "The tragic events of 1936 and early 1937 showcase a fatal weakness in our system of governance. Unable to effectively govern, the people's representatives in Congress were left floundering under ineffective power. We must expand the powers that Congress holds in order to avoid the folly that led to the onset of the Second American Civil War."
 TEX_disband_paramilitary_groups: "Mintuemen into Reservists"
 TEX_disband_paramilitary_groups_desc: "The defence of the republic is the sacred duty of the professional armed forces of the United States. While minutemen and other paramilitary groups were essential in fighting the civil war, we must begin the process of disarming and disbanding the various paramilitary groups and encourage their entry into the Federal Armed Forces."
 TEX_constitutional_protections: "Constitutional Protections"
 TEX_constitutional_protections_desc: "In the time of the founding fathers, the memory of tyrant King George was enough to dissuade the people of that era from pursuing reckless power. However, with that memory far in the past, we must take steps to amend the consitition and restrict the excesses of the Executive branch to ensure that no dictator can destroy our republic!"
 TEX_unite_the_disparate_parties: "Readmit Republicans and Democrats"
 TEX_unite_the_disparate_parties_desc: "No factions were torn usunder quite like the establishment parties of the Republicans and Democrats. Separated by vast reaches of space, many found themselves on opposite sides of the civil war from members of their own party. Such divisions will take time to heal, but we must not look this gift in the mouth to attempt to pull together the two parties in Washingtonian unity."
 TEX_appeal_to_the_populist_base: "Absorb the Jobless and Liberty Parties"
 TEX_appeal_to_the_populist_base_desc: "For all the faults that Huey Long had, his oratory skills were not among them. He had a true gift in creating quite the populist base across the country. The minor parties that tried to imitate Long, the Jobless Party and Liberty Party, must be commended and rewarded handsomely for their dedication to American principles."
 TEX_executive_order_6166: "Executive Order 6166"
 TEX_executive_order_6166_desc: "The conclusion of the Second American Civil War has brought no shortage of trials and cases before the Department of Justice. Overwhelmed, they have called on the government to assist in streamlining and expanding the department to better serve the people. This will also give us ample opportunity to empower the Department of Justice to come down harder upon anti-Government dissenters."

 TEX_veteran_employment_act: "Veteran Employment Act"
 TEX_veteran_employment_act_desc: "We owe a great debt of gratitude for the soldier who fought under our banner and brough the Second American Civil War to a conclusion in our favour. Accordingly, we shall begin writing legislation that provides discharged soldiers with easy access to affordable home loans, gainful employment, and the ability to pursue higher education if they desire."
 TEX_selective_nationalisation: "Nationalise Without Internationalism"
 TEX_selective_nationalisation_desc: "As the fighting continues to die down in the urban industrial areas of the country, we find ourselves in control of a vast number of entreprises that once produced weapons and goods for the enemy. This affords us the perfect opportunity to nationalise these industries to better serve the state, while ensuring that those business owners who supported us remain loyal."
 TEX_restrict_union_power: "Restrict Union Power"
 TEX_restrict_union_power_desc: "The Socialist Party of America have shown their true colours to the world in their revolutionary actions. It is clear that unchecked union power would be a hindrance to proper society and lead to mass unemployment as greedy unions begin sucking up the wages of their workers and destroy the healthy capitalistic competition that America is built on."
 TEX_enshrine_the_right_to_work: "Enshrine The Right-To-Work"
 TEX_enshrine_the_right_to_work_desc: "While outright banning all union activity might be a step too far, the government can step in to protect employees from being unfairly treated by them. We must provide a guarantee that employees have the right to refrain from being forced into membership of any labour union by virtue of their place of employment being a closed shop that mandates union membership."
 TEX_continue_the_tariffs: "Continue The Tariffs"
 TEX_continue_the_tariffs_desc: "In order to rebuild the local American economy, we must begin implementing a series of protectionist tariffs designed to drive up the prices of any outside goods that foreign nations are seeking to flood America with. Instead, we must turn inwards to our fellow neighbour and build back stronger than ever!"
 TEX_farmer_relief_act: "Farmer Relief Act"
 TEX_farmer_relief_act_desc: "With government programs to assist farmers affected by the dust bowl still struggling to make progress, the advent of the Second American Civil War did nothing to help farmers as their land became a battleground for the various armies in the fighting. As such, we should begin allocating resources and grants to farmers looking to rebuild or mechanise their farms."

### Reconstruction ###
 TEX_rebuilding_the_country: "Rebuilding the Country"
 TEX_rebuilding_the_country_desc: "A long struggle to push through the Federalist and Syndicalist forces in America has left the victorious Union State economically drained. The hand that unifies the country can either promote deficit spending regime, or an austere policy that limits direct intervention in the market."
 TEX_national_recovery: "National Recovery Administration"
 TEX_national_recovery_desc: "The NRA emphasises the use of public domain and work-living units instead of 'cut throat competition' of regular contract work. Workers in the NRA will receive the benefit of a minimum wages and price-controlled work environments in constant to the old Company Store model."
 TEX_public_works: "Public Works Administration"
 TEX_public_works_desc: "The ability to generate electricity, transport water, and ensure safe and efficient travel was lost during the civil war, but the Public Works Administration will fix all that. It is a fund that will ensure contractors pay their employees fairly."
 TEX_research_projects: "National Education Administration"
 TEX_research_projects_desc: "In the wake of the collapse of the CSA, the National Education Association has folded and its members dispersed. With most teachers being apolitical and the union never being able to exert much partisan power over them, it makes a strong candidate for rehabilitation by the new American government."
 TEX_civil_works_adminstration: "Civil Works Administration"
 TEX_civil_works_adminstration_desc: "As a nation, America lost a great deal of its labour supply to fighting and the poverty of the disorganised Federalists. The leader has pushed an executive order authorising the creation of an agency to employ manual labourers fill out the spaces in employment for NRA projects."
 TEX_the_ccc: "Civilian Conservation Corps"
 TEX_the_ccc_desc: "The damage done to America by the civil war has been considerable, and even approaching the idea of reconstruction seems like an insurmountable problem. An idea has been floating around the capital of establishing a public body to oversee not only the reconstruction effort but looking into how to rebuild a better America once that project is complete."
 TEX_rural_electrification: "Rural Electrification"
 TEX_rural_electrification_desc: "The electricity network throughout the country has regressed to that of the 1910s. This is Un-American and we need to ensure that our constituents can be properly informed about our nation's glory."
 TEX_the_aaa: "Agricultural Adjustment Act"
 TEX_the_aaa_desc: "Newspaper stories during the hysteria of '36 were filled with horror stories of farmers burning rotting crops due to being unable to sell excess while city ghettos starved. Our solution to this is the Agricultural Adjustment Act, to create a policy on crop conservation."
 TEX_farm_security_administration: "Farm Security Administration"
 TEX_farm_security_administration_desc: "Sharecroppers and tenant farmers make up a significant portion of our constituency, especially in the core power of the South. We must extend a credit programme with very low interest rates to farmers who apply to resettle land, especially land in the old Steel Belt."
 TEX_begin_reconstruction: "Begin Reconstruction"
 TEX_begin_reconstruction_desc: "The civil war has blasted our country to pieces. Large parts of the rural country are naught but mud and ashes, while countless cities have been reduced to smouldering rubble. We shall set to work developing new housing and infrastructure as soon as possible."
 TEX_harsh_reconstruction: "Punish the Corrupt and Treacherous"
 TEX_harsh_reconstruction_desc: "Congress has sided with us in condemning these companies that betrayed the American people. Lists of majority shareholders in traitorous companies have been seized and the executive officers of companies that have exploited workers behind the facade of government are now on trial."
 TEX_reconciliation: "Reconciliation"
 TEX_reconciliation_desc: "Congress finally won out against the executive branch, and has decided not to bring charges against seditious companies. Executive officers were pressured to resign in order for their company to be re-listed however, but ultimately the shareholders are deemed innocent of wrongdoing."
 TEX_military_industrial_complex: "Military-Industrial Complex"
 TEX_military_industrial_complex_desc: "Constraints imposed by the poor state of the American treasury and the weak strength of the dollar has been made known to Congress, who has devised a new plan for recovery based on cooperation with private enterprise."
 TEX_coprotate_militarism: "Corporate Alliance"
 TEX_coprotate_militarism_desc: "The old bureaucratic system of time-based seniority pales in comparison to scientific management as proposed by Fredrick Taylor. We need the expertise of business professionals within Congress, in order to secure an alliance with the corporate infrastructure in America."
 TEX_business_subsides: "Loosen Regulations"
 TEX_business_subsides_desc: "The dual-layered federal government system had allowed for at times very loose regulations on workspace practice, depending on the state. In order to leverage this inherent balance in our government, we must allow businesses both large and small to thrive."
 TEX_building_grants: "Building Grants"
 TEX_building_grants_desc: "Smaller townships across America have no recourse if their need is slightly less than the threshold for contract work. Our remedy is a Building Grant program based off of the Ford Foundation. This allows communities to show proper need and return on investment for contract work."
 TEX_banking_act: "Corporate Militarism"
 TEX_banking_act_desc: "Many businesses closed or were temporarily forced to leave America when union activity reached a pitched frenzy. There must be a show of strength to prove that America is now safe. We shall offer surplus military goods to companies looking to relocate back into 'dangerous' areas."
 TEX_military_factories: "Military Factories"
 TEX_military_factories_desc: "Munitions factories and armouries are reporting a large loss of stock to theft as well as difficulty competing with foreign competition. We can fix the first without infringing on the Second Amendment with a tariff on imported arms."
 TEX_american_business_is_business: "American Business is Business"
 TEX_american_business_is_business_desc: "As most of Congress is fiscally conservative, it was easy to pass laws reorganising the newly named National Reserve to stop deflation. We must lower the money supply and remove illegal currency from circulation or else our buying power will never recover."
 TEX_create_esmwt: "Research Investments"
 TEX_create_esmwt_desc: "As we revitalise research labs and think tanks across the nation, we have also begun to spread highly rewarding research grants that have laid dormant during the Civil War. Privately funded or philanthropically created universities are given priority to receive grants from the government."
 TEX_reconstruction_is_over: "Reconstruction is Over"
 TEX_reconstruction_is_over_desc: "The course of reconstruction has revealed the true ideological basis for why Hoover was unable to fix the economy. The wiser constituents of these windbags have largely voted them out by now, as the GDP rises and the American standard of living rises and even exceeds pre-war levels."

### Army Path ###
 TEX_From_a_Militia_to_a_force: "From a Militia to a Fighting Force"
 TEX_From_a_Militia_to_a_force_desc: "So far the only force the Kingfish has commanded have been small-time militias in urban environments. With the advent of the civil war, many generals and army groups have 'deserted' to join the real American government, and adapting our previous forces and hierarchy to these newcomers should be our priority."
 TEX_Patton_Plan: "Patton Reform Plan"
 TEX_Patton_Plan_desc: "Citing our outdated army organisation, General Patton has approached us with a reform plan. Insisting that a strong offensive thrust is the best way of defending our lands from the corrupt Feds and treacherous Reds, his plan would see us orient our industry towards the rapid motorisation our forces. While his harsh methods have their critics, no one's doubting the results he'll bring when on the offensive."
 TEX_Moseley_Plan: "Moseley Reform Plan"
 TEX_Moseley_Plan_desc: "Given how outdated the Army organisation had become, General Moseley has approached us with a reform plan. He has put forward a hierarchical reorganisation from top to bottom, the expansion of old army bases to train officers and a focus on centralising the command chain. He has requested the Kingfish for a carte blanche to carry out his plan and bring our army up to standard."
 TEX_Danford_Plan: "Danford Reform Plan"
 TEX_Danford_Plan_desc: "Given how unprepared our Army is for the inferno we've thrown ourselves into, General Danford has approached us with a plan. He has put forward that in lieu of mechanisation and technological advantage, victory requires the South's industry to adapt to the needs of the artillery which shall lead the way to defeat the traitors in the North. While there are sceptics among the government, his proposition should be considered."
 TEX_logistics_management_expertise: "Logistics Management Expertise"
 TEX_logistics_management_expertise_desc: "During the Interwar, Moseley was put as assistant to General Dawes in the Bureau of Budget, and that has taught him quite a lot about logistical placement priority. This knowledge shall prove invaluable for us, as our forces are stretched, and our supplies are severely limited."
 TEX_expand_Fort_Benning_for_Training: "Expand Fort Benning for Training"
 TEX_expand_Fort_Benning_for_Training_desc: "Fort Benning has served our nation faithfully since its foundation in 1909, and its importance continues to grow by the day. Being the home of the United States Army Infantry School, an expansion of Fort Benning could provide us with better room for our new officer recruits, and in turn, provide us with better officers both on the short and long term."
 TEX_joint_chiefs_of_staff: "Joint Chiefs of Staff"
 TEX_joint_chiefs_of_staff_desc: "The disputes common in the Federal inter-service politics persist in our own government. In order to avoid this interdisciplinary contention from spilling over, we must ensure that all our Chiefs of Staff are given equal attention."
 TEX_improve_artillery: "Improve Our Artillery"
 TEX_improve_artillery_desc: "The South's Artillery industrial output is subpar at best with the rest of the nation. In order to catch up, new artillery drafts improving their range and reload speed will enable our artillery to strike faster and strike harder than our enemy's."
 TEX_Assembly_line_modifications: "Assembly Line Modifications"
 TEX_Assembly_line_modifications_desc: "With the new designs already in the assembly line, one of our designers pointed out that several pieces needed for the assembly could be streamlined with more easily accessible parts, and has proposed these to be approved to enter mass production and for our artillery assemblies to use them."
 TEX_weapons_manufacturers: "Firearms Manufacturers"
 TEX_weapons_manufacturers_desc: "The small arms industry is in dire need of reform. In spite of the national emergency, independent contractors continue to waste money researching civilian firearms. A restriction on big game hunting later, and some manufacturers are beginning to focus on military arms."
 TEX_walkie_talkies: "Walkie Talkies"
 TEX_walkie_talkies_desc: "Usually military equipment has strong names. Walkie Talkie? How did that slip through the system? Our generals claim that this new untethered communication device will enable our troops to speak effectively when they're in the field. And we called it Walkie Talkie?"
 TEX_industrial_contacts: "Industrial Contacts"
 TEX_industrial_contacts_desc: "Private enterprise has become an undeniable part of our military industry. It is time we draw up contracts and see what they can do to help us."
 TEX_auto_industry: "American Automobile Industry"
 TEX_auto_industry_desc: "Since the invention of the Automobile, it has been taken up with earnest by the people of America. While most of the factories for cars are in the north where the syndicalists are running things. However, Henry Ford has moved south, so we should encourage other companies to follow in his footsteps."
 TEX_focus_on_concentration: "Focus on Fire Concentration"
 TEX_focus_on_concentration_desc: "Force Concentration has been an invaluable tactic for every commander since the times of the Roman Legions. Given our nation's limited resources when fighting against the traitors of America, we should once again reconsider this strategy for our artillery, concentrating it on specific sectors to achieve breakthroughs for our infantry to take advantage of."
 TEX_tank_commission: "Tank Commission"
 TEX_tank_commission_desc: "It is imperative that we use the information from our battles to design better tanks. The enemy has shown a surprising speed in enlarging their sheer size to meet our armour upgrades."
 TEX_motorize_the_men: "Motorise the Men"
 TEX_motorize_the_men_desc: "Patton's plan require that our tank's breakthroughs are accompanied by waves of motorised infantry able to quickly flank the enemy positions and cut them off from reinforcements as our infantry cleans up the pockets."
 TEX_streamline_tank_production: "Streamline Tank Production"
 TEX_streamline_tank_production_desc: "Tanks are fairly complex machines to produce, and this has caused severe supply issues at the front, as every tank that is disabled or breaks down means weeks if not months of waiting for the tank crew to be back into action again. In order to solve this, we shall streamline tank production so that our crews may stay in combat, and have a replacement waiting in case anything goes wrong."
 AUS_focus_on_swiftness: "Focus on Swiftness"
 AUS_focus_on_swiftness_desc: "Modern Warfare has come a long way since the trenches that once plagued the Western Front. Fast advances with tanks followed by motorised units is now not a dream but a necessity of a successful fighting force and as such, our nation's army should be at the forefront of this development."
 TEX_draw_a_new_war_plan_white: "Draw a New War Plan White"
 TEX_draw_a_new_war_plan_white_desc: "While we have seized copies of the original draft of War Plan White, it is unfortunately useless for our purposes as it details how to supply and defend areas near Washington and the Midwest, not how to take back our nation from a southern stronghold. However, with the knowledge of this plan, and our capable commanders, we can draft a new version of it, one that accounts for our new 'circumstances'."
 TEX_focus_on_command: "Focus on Command"
 TEX_focus_on_command_desc: "Our enemies in the civil war can be described simply as disorganised and demoralised militias with occasional remnants of the former Army presenting any real resistance. If we wish to prevail against them, then we should make our own army be an example of strong organisation and cohesion."
 TEX_take_the_fight_abroad: "Take the Fight Abroad"
 TEX_take_the_fight_abroad_desc: "With our victory at home, we now have to prepare to take the fight to whatever shore we need to take, to whatever mountain we have to cross and against whatever foe we need to face."
 TEX_increase_military_spending: "Increase Military Spending"
 TEX_increase_military_spending_desc: "The Civil War devastated the American Civilian industry, but has made the Military Industry quite a profitable enterprise. While the Civil war may be over, America still has enemies to fight and wars to win, and as such keeping the Civil War military spending and expanding upon it is on our best interests."
 TEX_military_research: "Military Research"
 TEX_military_research_desc: "After so many decades of isolation and the devastation of the civil war, our nation lacks the capacity for military research and development of the other great powers of the world. Let us begin to remedy this unfortunate reality."
 TEX_new_arms_factories: "New Arms Factories"
 TEX_new_arms_factories_desc: "The main trouble with creating a military industry is that facilities under our control were already reduced from the Great Depression to reduce redundancies. We have had to expand facilities and repurpose old buildings in order to manufacture parts needed for heavy weapons in our territory."
 TEX_war_bonds: "War Bonds"
 TEX_war_bonds_desc: "Funding the war effort will require more than victory gardens and volunteer-ism. Liquid assets are in short supply, especially with our economic programs ongoing. We can capitalise on public trust and implement War Bonds as most other free nations do."
 AUS_new_army_goes_rolling_along: "'This We'll Defend'"
 AUS_new_army_goes_rolling_along_desc: "Our New Army has readopted the old motto used by our fore-fathers who took up arms to defend our great nation. Like them before our team, now it is time for us to fight for America in an ever changing world, be it at home or abroad."
 TEX_army_bonus_bill: "Army Bonus Bill"
 TEX_army_bonus_bill_desc: "Combat hardens boys into men and men into solid steel - unshakeable pillars of Americanism. Only a fool would leave veterans such as these by the wayside. By paying generous additional bonuses to combat veterans predicated on continued upstanding citizenry and especially involvement in our military research apparatus, perhaps we can at last truly harness their potential."
 TEX_new_weapons: "New Weapon Designs"
 TEX_new_weapons_desc: "The army is reporting that our infantry weapons are insufficient to deal with both close range automatic fire and long range sharpshooters. These gaps will take more lives if we are unable to fill the need as soon as possible."
 TEX_army_ranger_corps: "Expand the Army Ranger Corps"
 TEX_army_ranger_corps_desc: "Fort Benning, Georgia has been home to some of the most resourceful soldiers of the early stages of the civil war. Training Regiments to acclimatise soldiers into new environments will enable American soldiers to survive in the hostile world we find ourselves in."
 TEX_reverse_war_plan_white: "Reverse War Plan White"
 TEX_reverse_war_plan_white_desc: "Thanks to our generals, we have managed to obtain copies of War Plan White which would've been used against us. While we can't prevent the Army from reorganising their logistics, we can however predict their advances, reinforce weak points and come up with ways to deceive Washington now that they think they've got used sized up."
 TEX_the_cavalry_of_tomorrow: "The Cavalry of Tomorrow"
 TEX_the_cavalry_of_tomorrow_desc: "Patton has long been a cavalry officer and he has designs and plans to transform motorised and tanks into a modern form of Cavalry. Working closely with the government, the military, Henry Ford and other Industrialists, we can make this plan a reality."
 TEX_top_of_the_line_artillery: "Top-Notch Artillery"
 TEX_top_of_the_line_artillery_desc: "Lighter power, stronger hulls and new types of detonation equipment will enable our artillery to break any bunker. We must expedite their development if we are to break the enemy."
 TEX_coordinated_fire: "Coordinated Fire"
 TEX_coordinated_fire_desc: "Gone are the days of rhythmically timing artillery shots according to your orders. A better human motion system that times movement will enable us to coordinate fire at an schedule necessary."

### Air Force ###
 TEX_air_force_reform: "Formation of an American Air Force"
 TEX_air_force_reform_desc: "With the ongoing debate in the US Army spanning for nearly two decades continues still, the air corps officers that defected to our side have promised us great results if we separated the air branch from the army. With the Kingfish's blessing the patriotic United States Air Force shall be formed, and will have to decide its future plans."
 TEX_expand_ACTS: "Expand the Air Corps Tactical School"
 TEX_expand_ACTS_desc: "We are lucky enough that the American Army in the past relegated air officer training to the deep South, as we now possess access to the instalations and officers from the Air Corps Tactical School in Maxwell Field, Alabama. However, in order to surpass the School set up in Langley Field in Virginia, we will need to expand on our instalations."
 TEX_fighters: "Fighter Development"
 TEX_fighters_desc: "American fighter projects were halted during the 1920s due to a lack of funding from the government, leading to a disadvantage in fighter development. We must close this gap by funding design contests among different companies with the prize being obtaining a very profitable production contract for the plane that may outperform our enemy's."
 TEX_le_may_reform: "LeMay Reform Plan"
 TEX_le_may_reform_desc: "Curtiss LeMay has managed to reach the higher echelons of command recently, due to a mix of nepotism and skill, and has proposed a bold plan of reform. Since the Air Force isn't meant to complement the army, he has proposed that the air force should strike at the heart of our enemies and cripple their industries of war. While his theoretical approach is sound, the final decision rests with the government."
 TEX_air_field_expansion: "Airfield Expansion"
 TEX_air_field_expansion_desc: "There are thousands of acres of flat land across our nation, just waiting to be covered with tarmac and freshly produced, state-of-the-art planes. Let's not keep them waiting a moment longer!"
 TEX_naval_bombers: "Naval Bomber Development"
 TEX_naval_bombers_desc: "With the shortcomings of our navy for protecting our shores, the air force has the duty to also protect the shores of our nation for whatever cost against any enemy who dare set foot in our homeland. As such, we will seek to complement the Navy's patrols with naval bombers scouting and intercepting any vessels whenever our fleet is too spread out or too far away to do so."
 TEX_Weyland_plan: "Weyland Reform Plan"
 TEX_Weyland_plan_desc: "Otto P. Weyland has managed to reach the higher echelons of command recently, due to a mix of both nepotism and skill, and has proposed a reform plan which is clearly welcomed by the army leadership. In his view, the Air Force's role in war should be to support the army's advances via close air support. While his theoretical approach is sound, the final decision rests with the government"
 TEX_bombers: "Bomber Development"
 TEX_bombers_desc: "Bombers, although a terror to behold, will enable us to project our power overseas. Our secret project also hinges on effective and safe bombers to deliver their secret payload."
 TEX_radar: "R.A.D.A.R. Development"
 TEX_radar_desc: "RADAR, the top-secret technology to detect air movement will allow our sky watchers to rest easy at night."
 TEX_screaming_eagles: "'Screaming Eagles' Program"
 TEX_screaming_eagles_desc: "With the ever growing presence of our air force and ever growing needs of the battlefield, a question has arisen between our army and air force officers: Could it be possible to combine the two to transport troops behind the battlefield in a manner that may change the face of the battle? In order to prove or disprove this theory, an experiment shall be undertaken."
 TEX_rule_the_skies: "Rule the Skies"
 TEX_rule_the_skies_desc: "Off we go, into the wild blue yonder, flying high into the sky. Our Air Force shall be the world's most advanced, and nowhere will be out of our reach."
 TEX_CAS_focus: "Close Air Support Model Development"
 TEX_CAS_focus_desc: "The Army's request for more ground support while traversing the trenches our enemies have erected. As an equal partner the Air Force approves this request."
 TEX_CAS_doctrine: "Air-to-Ground Combat Coordination Exercises"
 TEX_CAS_doctrine_desc: "In order to come out into the battlefield with an effective CAS air force, we first need to practise the basics of this relatively new concept of warfare."
 TEX_flexible_bombers: "Flexible Bomber Development"
 TEX_flexible_bombers_desc: "Since our air force has the task of supporting the army, the bombers of our force will have to adapt to a variety of roles, both as close air support as well as disrupting enemy supplies and communications in the rear during a battle and we should encourage the development of planes that may fulfil these roles."
 TEX_combined_arms_offensive: "Combined Arms Offensive"
 TEX_combined_arms_offensive_desc: "While our air officers stand at the ready, an issue has arisen once more that impedes the progress of our force: Army officers don't exactly know how to exploit our air power to its fullest potential. As such, we shall have to teach them to coordinate both their infantry and mechanised vehicles with our planes in order to create unstoppable offensives."
 TEX_strat_bomber_development: "Strategic Bomber Development"
 TEX_strat_bomber_development_desc: "With the objective of our air force clear, we can focus on making bombers for the specific task of obliterating our enemy's industry."
 TEX_cult_of_aviation: "Cult of Aviation"
 TEX_cult_of_aviation_desc: "Ever since the first flight of the Wright Flyer in Kitty Hawk, Americans have been fascinated with aircraft. We should exploit this fascination and turn our air force into a source of pride for our nation."
 TEX_long_range_interceptors: "Long Range Interceptors"
 TEX_long_range_interceptors_desc: "While fighters can secure the skies above the battlefields, the battle at the enemy's doorstep is usually too far away for them to step in to protect our bomber wings from the enemy fighters. To counter this, we have managed to create and improve heavier designs with longer to have bigger agility to stand a chance in air-to-air combat, and further investment in this area may yield great benefits."

### Navy Path ###
 TEX_navy: "American Navy"
 TEX_navy_desc: "Only a few ships, and even fewer sailors, remained loyal to the American people. We need to take stock of our maritime situation."
 TEX_great_white_fleet: "Great White Fleet"
 TEX_great_white_fleet_desc: "The Great White Fleet was the height to American naval power. We should look back at it for inspiration. A great fleet of battleships and dreadnoughts will ensure we always have naval superiority."
 TEX_protect_american_trade: "Protect American Trade"
 TEX_protect_american_trade_desc: "Trade is the lifeblood of America. We should focus our naval doctrine on making sure that it is protected from enemy raids."
 TEX_carriers: "Carrier Fleet Project"
 TEX_carriers_desc: "Carriers are the wave of the future. We should invest in their research and construction to better project naval power."
 TEX_battleships: "Battleship Research"
 TEX_battleships_desc: "Battleships are the king of the high seas. We should start research into new models with bigger guns and better air protection."
 TEX_battle_cruisers: "Battlecruiser Research"
 TEX_battle_cruisers_desc: "Battlecruisers present a middle balance between heavy battleships and faster cruisers. We should ensure we have some in our navy."
 TEX_coast_guard: "The Coast Guard"
 TEX_coast_guard_desc: "Restoring the Coast Guard will ensure that trade moves smoothly, criminals are stopped at sea, and those in danger are rescued."
 TEX_light_cruisers: "Light Cruiser Development"
 TEX_light_cruisers_desc: "Lighter cruisers are important in anti-air operations, as well as attacking enemy destroyers and submarines. We should ensure our navy has a handful of these in order to stay balanced."
 TEX_naval_aviation: "Naval Aviation"
 TEX_naval_aviation_desc: "Naval aviation is the future of warfare on the high seas. We should ensure that our air designs are capable of being launched from carriers and destroying the enemy fleet without even endangering our own."
 TEX_expand_dockyards: "Expand Dockyards"
 TEX_expand_dockyards_desc: "Our dockyards are somewhat inadequate to fight a war on their own. We need to ensure that new naval production facilities are constructed to support the war effort."
 TEX_submarine_development: "Submarine Development"
 TEX_submarine_development_desc: "Submarines allow us to wreak havoc on enemy shipping and heavy ships. We should ensure that our designs stay up to date against enemy destroyers and anti-submarine tactics."
 TEX_liberty_ships: "Liberty Ships"
 TEX_liberty_ships_desc: "Our shipyards, previously dedicated to commercial shipping, can easily be converted to produce massive numbers of convoys to supply our allies around the world."
 TEX_maritime_industry: "Maritime Industry"
 TEX_maritime_industry_desc: "Our maritime tradition remains strong. We can leverage the commercial shipping industry to help our struggling democracy to survive."
 TEX_new_admirals: "New Admirals"

### internal conflict stuff ###

 unionstate.1.t: "The American Legion Appointment"
 unionstate.1.d: "With the end of the civil war comes a vacancy in the ever important position of the American Legion's National Commander. This last title holder, Smedley Butler, had foolishly sided with the syndicalists. Whomever taken this position will symbolically represent the veterans of the United States military in society, and thus our choice is important. The most common name floated up is General George Moseley, though his anti-semitism does dissuade some from his nomination. Huey Long also believes that his friend and ally Fox Conner, who introduced Patton to Huey's cause, should have the position. A potential compromise candidate is also found in Robert Elkington Wood, a respected Republican general who supported our righteous struggle. Who shall be appointed?"
 unionstate.1.a: "Appoint Fox Conner."
 unionstate.1.b: "Appoint George Van Horn Moseley."
 unionstate.1.c: "Appoint Robert Elkington Wood."

 unionstate.2.t: "The Business Plot Exposed"
 unionstate.2.d: "[TEX_legion_head.GetName] has come rushing to Huey Long interrupting one of his meetings as he delivers an important message for the Kingfish. It seems that the War Powers Committee have been looking to the American Legion to try and get support to overthrow him. The War Powers Committee was reportedly in the final stages of planning a coup against Huey Long. The plot, which had allegedly gained traction among the remaining business leaders and military officials of the AFP, aimed to undermine the rule of Long and replace him with a more compliant and business-friendly leader. This news first makes the room fall silent and then anger from Long. The entire capitol region has been shut down and the Minutemen scrambled. News media are currently attempting to locate the alleged plotters along with the Minutemen and police. Though Huey Long would like to brag that the worst his enemies deserved is a stay in Louisiana State Penitentiary, it is unlikely that the building, currenlty overfull with partisans, will be used to house the plotters."
 unionstate.2.a: "Underneath the prison more likely."

 unionstate.3.t: "A Special Session of Congress"
 unionstate.3.d: "A rapid fire session of Congress under Huey Long has been able to pass several enabling acts thus far. While all of these orders have received unanimous support, the populist wing of the America First Party has thrust Huey Long into the first pivotal choice of his Presidency over the restored America. Imploring on him the need to remember his populist roots, they are demanding that Huey take immediate action to begin implementing his Share Our Wealth program. An expensive programme, at least until the current kleptocrats begin to pass away and their ridiculous inheritances can be parceled out to the common man, this measure has been pork barreled into a joint bill that also slashes funding for the Federal Armed Forces now that the enemies of the state have been crushed in the civil war. Such a position would certainly endear Long to his base, but may alienate powerful reactionary forces who view in Huey a potential tyrant King in the making."
 unionstate.3.a: "Let the bill pass."
 unionstate.3.b: "This is too risky, veto the bill."

 unionstate.4.t: "A Midnight Dinner"
 unionstate.4.d: "After a dinner in Washington, D.C., President Huey Long has disappeared along with his limousine and several of his armed guards. The disappearance was not noted until nine the next morning, and by then the newspapers had already begun spinning a story about syndicalist plotters. The Secret Service, having been decimated by the war, must seek the aid of the FBI if they are to ever find President Long alive. American Legion national commander, George Van Horn Moseley, has announced he will guide the country until a proper leader is found, ensuring syndicalism is uprooted from the country. Congress has called an emergency session to deal with succession, as kidnapping has no proper recourse in the Constitution."
 unionstate.4.a: "The syndicalists shall not get away with this!"

 unionstate.5.t: "Sic Semper Tyrannis"
 unionstate.5.d: "While much jubilation followed the announcement of the passage of the National Reconstruction Act, effectively promising a net for the average American, it came at a cost. For the American Legion and the veterans of the Second American Civil War, it was far too high. The budget for the armed forces was heavily slashed and overnight, tens of thousands of soldiers, heroes of the battles for St. Louis, D.C. and more were unceremoniously demobilised with no severance. Adding insult to injury, Long's personal militia in the Minutemen were exempt from these cuts.\n\nThis act of rampant Caesarism could not be tolerated! Acting quickly while the anger against Long was still fresh in the soldier's minds, Robert Wood hatched a conspiracy to take down the populist demagogue. Disguising themselves as members of Long's Minutemen bodyguards, they were able to successfully infiltrate Long's residence and arrange a night time assault against the Kingfish, taking the king off the board for good. With no clear line of ascension, the American Legion moved quickly to secure the appointment of Martin Dies Jr, a conservative politician known for his unabashed attacks on un-American activities to the highest office in the land.  Having publicly called out Long's kingly ambitions, he is the caretaker that America needs as she rebuilds."
 unionstate.5.a: "Now no man will ever be a king."

 unionstate.7.t: "Capital of America"
 unionstate.7.d: "With the civil war over, the question of what should be the capital for the new America has been brought up. Of the many cities within the country, four are the most promising. The selection process, shrouded in secrecy until the final decision was announced, revealed a handful of possible strategic locations. Cronyism always at play, members of Congress were buried in donations and heartfelt pleas requesting the new seat of power rest in their fair city. Washington D.C, with the history and facilities to resume the seat of government. New Orleans, which gave up so much for the Longist revolution. Baton Rouge, where Huey Long redrew the skyline with new buildings already. Finally Saint Louis, in dire need of national attention after fighting so fercely the partisans. What city will be chosen as the new capital?"
 unionstate.7.a: "Washington, D.C."
 unionstate.7.b: "New Orleans."
 unionstate.7.c: "Baton Rouge."
 unionstate.7.e: "Saint Louis."

 unionstate.8.t: "All Hail the Kingfish"
 unionstate.8.d: "In a resounding display of leadership and conviction, President Huey Long has emerged victorious in the war against extremism without compromising his core principles. The nation, facing a critical juncture in its history, witnessed a masterful display of political finesse as President Long navigated the turbulent waters of ideological discord and emerged with both his principles intact and a united country behind him. One of the key elements of President Long's strategy was a commitment to open and honest dialogue. Rather than dismissing opposing views, he engaged with critics and dissenting voices, fostering an atmosphere of constructive debate. With his victory, Long has turned his gaze to those that would demand that he prostate himself before them during his time of need. He has given orders to the Minutemen to deal with those traitors who would dare attempt to betray and weaken America."
 unionstate.8.a: "The Kingfish is victorious!"

### Huey Long Flavour ###

 unionstate.10.t: "The [GetYear] Presidential Election"
 unionstate.10.d: "It is this year's election in [TEX.GetNameDef], and President [TEX.GetLeader] is well in the lead in the national polls and almost certain to be re-elected. The reelection campaign, which played out more as a formality than a fierce political battle, lacked the usual fervor seen in previous years. Traditional elements of a contested race, debates, campaign rallies, and intense media coverage, were noticeably absent. Instead, the president's journey to a second term was a relatively quiet affair, drawing attention to the unusual circumstances surrounding the absence of competitors. As the nation adjusts to the idea of an unopposed reelection, there is a palpable sense of uncertainty about the future political landscape."
 unionstate.10.a: "Congratulations, [TEX.GetLeader]!"

 unionstate.11.t: "The Question of Charles Coughlin"
 unionstate.11.d: "As public scrutiny intensifies, President [TEX.GetLeader] finds himself at the centre of a heated debate within the administration regarding the future of controversial propagandist Charles Coughlin. The firebrand commentator, known for his incendiary rhetoric and divisive views, has become a lightning rod for criticism, prompting discussions within the White House about whether to sever ties with the polarising figure. The years of service to America has worn Father Charles Coughlin down. In between his radio shows and his Social Justice publications, he rarely has time to promote Share Our Wealth Societies. This coupled with his increasing emotional instability has led to this day. President [TEX.GetLeader], while silent on this issue, sympathises with the Jewish citizens for whom Coughlin has made their lives very difficult. Critics argue that Coughlin's continued association with the administration undermines efforts to foster a sense of inclusivity and unity, particularly when the American people are trying to return to a state of normality. Advocates for Coughlin, however, contend that removing him would set a dangerous precedent. Removing a member of Huey long's inner circle would engender distrust among his cadre. Yet, a decision must be done..."
 unionstate.11.a: "Cut Coughlin off."
 unionstate.11.b: "We cannot betray our old fighters!"

 unionstate.12.t: "The Long Dynasty"
 unionstate.12.d: "President Huey Long finds himself at the centre of a growing debate as discussions emerge about the possibility of appointing his brother, Earl Long, to a position within the presidential cabinet. The potential nomination has ignited discussions about the fine line between family loyalty and concerns of nepotism within the highest echelons of government. While it has taken many years for the Long family to mature in the public limelight, the brothers and sons of Huey Long are more worldly because of it. In this time of uncertainty where any body could be an assassin, should Huey's family occupy the vital positions in the Presidential Cabinet? It is a stretch in confidence for all but the most determined Longists to accept family into the high posts of government."
 unionstate.12.a: "That's going too far."
 unionstate.12.b: "You can't go wrong with Long."

 unionstate.13.t: "Improving the Southern Tenant Farmers Union"
 unionstate.13.d: "In a move aimed at addressing the needs of rural communities and supporting agricultural workers, President Huey Long has announced a significant increase in funding for the Southern Tenant Farmers Union (STFU). The Southern Tenant Farmers Union, a grassroots organisation dedicated to advocating for the rights and interests of tenant farmers, sharecroppers, and agricultural laborers, will receive a substantial boost in financial support from the federal government. Although the work of the Southern Tenant Farmers Union is well appreciated, the name itself that provides homes to thousands is still the butt of jokes. The tenants are exasperated about the name of their organisation. A visit to the office and a reprint is all it takes to correct that snafu. While [TEX.GetLeader] was inside, he decided to improve and integrate other parts of the newly christened American Tenant Farmers Union into his political machine."
 unionstate.13.a: "Say hello to the ATFU."

 unionstate.14.t: "The Truth about Hugo Black"
 unionstate.14.d: "When the Honorable Hugo Black was appointed office on the coattails of Huey Long's victory, very few had bothered to check his past associations. This is why today's newspaper shocked President [TEX.GetLeader] so greatly. An expose found Hugo Black's Klan membership. Hugo Black responded to the press by profusely apologising, and saying that his membership was just perfunctory in order to get elected in Alabama. While Black's judicial record does paint him as a liberal, this flies directly in the face of Long's anti-Klan campaign. Should we fire Hugo Black?"
 unionstate.14.a: "An intolerable association."
 unionstate.14.b: "A man can change."

 unionstate.15.t: "Schism in Share Our Wealth Societies"
 unionstate.15.d: "To Share Our Wealth societies throughout America, [TEX.GetLeader] has enlisted not only party members but also former government employees. These new employees were directed by Marine Veteran Sidney McMath, and were paid on the federal payroll. Now there exists a tension between the old and the new in Share Our Wealth. Old guard leader Francis Townsend advocates for Share Our Wealth to remain a non-governmental entity to prevent partisan politics, while McMath wishes to officiate it as a Federal Department."
 unionstate.15.a: "Side with Townsend."
 unionstate.15.b: "Side with McMath."

 unionstate.16.t: "McTeague Released in Theatres"
 unionstate.16.d: "A tale of greed and betrayal that once littered America is now encapsulated in the new film McTeague. A social commentary by director Erich von Stroheim about the corrupting power of wealth is seen by many as a parable to the state of America before the Civil War. Greed is a tale of moral decay and the destructive power of wealth. The film's portrayal of the dissolution of a household over a hoard of gold reminds viewers of the desperation they felt in the harsh years before the Longist victory. This massive four-hour epic film had its ending altered from the original book, where a kind stranger intervenes in the death struggle of McTeague and whisks him away from Death Valley back to civilisation."
 unionstate.16.a: "I had a good nap watching."

 unionstate.17.t: "Accusations of Crypto-Socialism"
 unionstate.17.d: "The public's understanding of Share Our Wealth and Every Man A King is predicated largely on song and slogan. Although many Americans today sing along, there persist many partisans who continue to say our programme is crypto-socialism. Their contention is slowly damaging our reputation within the nation. President Huey Long, in a bold and assertive address to the nation, staunchly defended his ambitious Share Our Wealth program, categorically rejecting the characterisation of the initiative as socialist. President Long reiterated the core tenets of the Share Our Wealth program, emphasising that its primary objective is to address the stark disparities in wealth distribution and ensure a more equitable society. Long argued that the programme is rooted in populism and a commitment to lifting millions of Americans out of poverty, rather than promoting socialist ideals."
 unionstate.17.a: "They just don't appreciate a good thing."

 unionstate.18.t: "Superman vs The Klan"
 unionstate.18.d: "Up in the sky! It's a bird? It's a plane? No, it's Superman! Saving America from the terror of the Klan of the Fiery Cross. This latest series is the brainchild of Siegel and Shuster partnered with an anti-Klan advocate Stetson Kennedy. In a clever and satirical radio play, Superman vs the Klan has taken the airwaves by storm, leaving the Ku Klux Klan looking more foolish than fearsome. The production, inspired by real historical events, turns the tables on the notorious hate group, using the iconic superhero to expose the absurdity of their ideology. Listeners are taken on a thrilling ride as Superman, disguised as a regular human, infiltrates the Klan, ultimately dismantling their operations and rendering their intimidation tactics impotent. The play doesn't shy away from addressing the Klan's use of fear, hatred, and ignorance, portraying them as a group whose power diminishes in the face of truth and justice."
 unionstate.18.a: "Kids love it."

 unionstate.19.t: "Governor Long Fires on Protestors"
 unionstate.19.d: "Governor Earl Long has long dodged accusations of corruption and mismanagement of money. As the brother of President Huey Long, Earl has been immune from prosecution and is usually handled delicately by the press. Earl's administration has been charged to distribute veteran benefits and basic income to the people of Louisiana, with the assumption that all loyal Americans would be deserving of this welfare. A group of concerned citizens, including hundreds of veterans and poor from Northern Louisiana have gathered in Baton Rouge, claiming that Earl Long has withheld their income and benefits. Governor Earl tried to speak to the crowd, claiming that the funds have yet to arrive from the capitol, and to disperse until that day. The protestors, many of whom were black veterans, began chanting for Earl's resignation. While accounts differ about what happened next, anywhere from 20-50 people lie dead among the protestors. It now lies with President Huey to pick up the pieces. Governor Earl is appealing to his brother to help him with damage control. The press are not quite at a fever pitch, and any move Huey does could swing public opinion at the moment. "
 unionstate.19.a: "Attend the funerals of the protestors."
 unionstate.19.b: "Help Earl cover this up."

 unionstate.20.t: "Black No More"
 unionstate.20.d: "The imaginations and political opinions of Americans were piqued when Black No More, written by author George Schuyler, appeared on bookshelves. The book is a science fiction about a scientist who invents a machine that can turn a black man white. This invention turns society upside down, and challenges ideas on race and the one drop principle. The book continues with the revelation that all the characters, both white and black, are mixed race, and the entire principle of racial supremacy collapses. While there were concerns that the book would be censored due to its veiled attacks against both white supremacists and black leaders, it appears that President [TEX.GetLeader] enjoys the book."
 unionstate.20.a: "As long as it doesn't offend me."

 unionstate.21.t: "We Say Goodbye to Huey Long"
 unionstate.21.d: "Huey Long has passed away in office and in the company of his family today in Baton Rouge. In attendance was the Vice President and Huey's brother, Earl Long, who had been filling in as President Long for the past few weeks, and who already has been inaugurated as President to finish Huey's remaining terms. While America apparently mourns their leader's loss, the US governments in exile have continued their claims that Long's government is illegitimate."
 unionstate.21.a: "Farewell to a fine president!"

### Business Plot Events 31 - 50 ###

 unionstate.31.t: "The Hollywood List"
 unionstate.31.d: "We know that Hollywood has always acted above the law. Its mere existence in California an attempt to dodge intellectual property laws. Moreover, it is no secret that some artists there had hoped for a syndicalist victory over our great American Republic. Their folly must be exposed and their sedition prosecuted."
 unionstate.31.a: "We'll film their trials."

 unionstate.32.t: "Persistence of Antisemitism"
 unionstate.32.d: "With the great success of Fordism in America, there comes as well some critics of the ideas presented in Ford literature. Especially within the Dearborn Independent, articles describing a massive worldwide conspiracy of Jews has created backlash against Fordism. The public at large is beginning to question Ford's ageing logic, and as Ford is not a very public man, his responses to the press have only damned him further. To Ford's critics, including other Committee members, racial rhetoric must be pushed subtly and anonymously. Most of the Committee including [TEX.GetLeader] still agree with Ford's theories, but disagree on the medium to propagate those ideas as to not destabilise the new America's international relations."
 unionstate.32.a: "Side with Ford."
 unionstate.32.b: "Side with The Committee."

 unionstate.33.t: "Tying up Loose Ends"
 unionstate.33.d: "Weaving spiders are the many members of the press that continue their fruitless search for Huey Long. Although the FBI has made the best public display of effort possible, there persist some underground press who do not believe syndicalists did the deed. While most pamphlets on this are published anonymously, the FBI have traced their origin, and surprisingly found them to be coming from both the left and right, politically speaking. These conspiracy theorists, as we call them, could destabilise our new government if they continue their publications."
 unionstate.33.a: "Do whatever it takes to silence them!"
 unionstate.33.b: "Leave them be - this will blow over."
 TEX_covers_up: "§YThe government's ability to cover up the plot will improve§!"

 unionstate.34.t: "Every Girl a Queen?"
 unionstate.34.d: "The most delicate part of the Business Plot is upon us. It appears Huey Long's will dictates that, in an event of his injury or incapacitation, his wife Rose Long was to take his post. Many die-hard Long followers have come to Washington, demanding Rose occupy the Presidential Mansion until Huey Long be found. They are met with an equal number of former Federalists who insist Huey Long's running mate, William Lemke, is the constitutionally-correct President. Siding with the constitution as our best defence is perhaps the more prudent path, though it could also be seen as an insult to Huey Long's widow and enflame the anger of the public even further."
 unionstate.34.a: "Make a public show of sympathy for Rose Long's cause."
 unionstate.34.b: "The Constitution is not subject to sentiment."

 unionstate.35.t: "But No One Wears A Crown"
 unionstate.35.d.coverup: "Finally the Business Plot's master stroke is ready: exhausting and unresolved debates have worn down the willpower of Congress to elect a Vice President with absolute majority. A group of our more trustworthy Senators are ready to bring George Moseley into his own as Vice President, and to then serve as President until Huey is found. This involves a very specific alteration to Article II and the 12th Amendment to allow for Moseley as President Pro Tempore to assume office. Any attempts to uncover the truth behind Huey's disappearance have gone nowhere."
 unionstate.35.d.uncovered: "Although he was maligned during the war for his almost nihilistic attitude, the journalist Westbrook Pegler has more than redeemed himself to the public today. Through investigative journalism, dodging government goons, and a dedication to facts over his own political reservations, the truth has been uncovered to the public. The underground press has exposed the true killers of Huey Long: his own bodyguards. The blood money was traced right back to none other than interim president, George Moseley. The whole apparatus of state has moved to arrest Moseley, who implicated the War Powers Committee in what people are calling the 'Business Plot'. These men will be brought to justice, wherever they lay."
 unionstate.35.d.scandal: "The Business Plot has succeeded, though it has come at great cost. Journalist Westbrook Pegler published an 'expose', accusing Moseley and others of conspiring to have Huey Long killed. Since its publication, Pegler's evidence has been proven flimsy and circumstantial - enough so that George Moseley was, in the end, considered more victim that perpetrator. The scandal has left a lingering taste among the public, but Moseley's allies in Congress were able to prevent any official hearings... and, after months of exhaustive and unresolved debates, have managed to arrange for him to serve as President until Huey is found. This involves a very specific alteration to Article II and the 12th Amendment, to allow for Moseley as President Pro Tempore to assume office."
 unionstate.35.a: "I love the Republic, I hate Democracy."
 unionstate.35.b: "Walls Come Crumbling Down."
 unionstate.35.c: "Nothing like a good scandal."

 unionstate.36.t: "Twenty Second Amendment"
 unionstate.36.d: "The Committee is in agreement on the future of the 17th Amendment, the amendment that forced direct election on senators. Passed under Wilson in his vain populist bid to promote insurgent democracy over our Republican system of government. The 17th Amendment, enacted in 1913, mandated the direct election of U.S. Senators by the people of each state, rather than their selection by state legislatures. The repeal of this amendment reinstates the original constitutional framework. Supporters of the repeal argue that returning to the appointment of Senators by state legislatures will strengthen the connection between state governments and the federal legislative branch. They contend that this change will restore the intended balance of power, providing states with a more direct role in shaping federal policy and legislation. The 22nd Amendment will ensure that this unneeded alteration to our system is repaired and Congress will again be represented in the way the Founding Fathers intended."
 unionstate.36.a: "As our Founding Fathers intended."

 unionstate.37.t: "Patriotism or Profits"
 unionstate.37.d: "A conflict of interests has arisen between the market and the War Powers Committee. A recent speech given by Roger Babson highlighted the hypocrisy of multinational corporations that both claim to be patriotic while also opening factories in European syndicalist nations. Our own Fred Koch fired back by stating that the market and American people want their businesses to succeed as an extension of patriotism. While the War Powers Committee leads several multinational corporations, we have noticed a strong uptick in domestic sales that could remove the risk of retreating from foreign markets. It is time for the Committee to settle this national debate."
 unionstate.37.a: "Business is our Business."
 unionstate.37.b: "Patriotism is our Business."

 unionstate.38.t: "The Second American Plan"
 unionstate.38.d: "Although the syndicalists are defeated and their members gone to ground, there still remains the threat of the union growth Huey Long foolishly promised. A proposal from Congress may be able to remedy this. The original American Plan was legislation proposed during the Wilson administration to guarantee employers ability to challenge Union activities. The foolish Congress under McAdoo failed to properly ensure this right, but the new American Republic will correct that. The American Plan will allow individual states to pass right-to-work laws and authorises the federal courts to prosecute union activity violating those laws."
 unionstate.38.a: "Business Rights not Union Rights."

 unionstate.39.t: "War Powers Committee vs Congress"
 unionstate.39.d: "A meeting today between the War Powers Committee and several congressmen friendly to our cause was held to address the future of representation in the Presidential Cabinet. Fear that the political spotlight the War Powers Committee is under by holding cabinet positions has two possible solutions: the first is to coordinate with Congress in order to push through a law to reorganise the Presidential Cabinet to officially become the War Powers Committee. The second is to appoint several of our loyalist politicians from Congress to appease prying eyes and keep the stability our new American Republic needs. The latter comes at great political cost, and will weaken our position, though certainly it goes a long way towards obscuring our intentions."
 unionstate.39.a: "The War Powers Committee will be the new cabinet."
 unionstate.39.b: "Call in favours to appoint the congressmen."

 unionstate.40.t: "NAACP Declares the Government Illegitimate"
 unionstate.40.d: "In the wake of the devastating civil war, the future of African-American rights fought so long for is again threatened. Initial assurances of civil protection by Huey Long kept many from the streets as socialists and federalists roiled. There were even planned meetings in New York City for Huey Long to directly address civil rights concerns before that fateful day. Now with Huey Long gone, all illusions of safety are dead. Walter Francis White, along with several high ranking members of the NAACP, have declared the new America illegitimate. Many of them now prepare to emigrate to Canada and to other countries as Marcus Garvey did and so many others did during slavery."
 unionstate.40.a: "So be it."

 unionstate.41.t: "Mothers Movement Clashes With Feminists"
 unionstate.41.d: "One of the least likely sources of support within the America First Party came from Mothers Movements. The Mothers Movements are a group of religiously-minded conservative women who aligned with the radical elements that sought to undermine Huey Long. Now that Huey is long gone, leaders like Alma Bridwell White and Elizabeth Dilling now direct hysteria against suspected socialists. Their marches have also demonstrated a xenophobia against Catholics and blacks. Their position within this new America is tenuous, as the highest members of our government regard the nineteenth amendment with only slightly more respect than the thirteenth through fifteenth."
 unionstate.41.a: "For now they are useful."

 unionstate.42.t: "President Moseley Dies, Charles Lindbergh is Inaugurated"
 unionstate.42.d: "After a bout of illness and a delirium, President Moseley has died. In his final days in office, Moseley had refused every medical assistance, accusing every one he saw of being Jewish. The Vice President, Charles Lindbergh, was recalled to the capital to be sworn in. With the War Powers Committee in attendance, Charles Lindbergh was sworn in as the official 33rd President of the American Republic, as Moseley was only the interim President for his years in office. American expats have universally condemned the new President just as they did the old."
 unionstate.42.a: "Does inauguration even matter any longer?"

### HUAC Events ###
 unionstate.51.t: "The Figurehead of State"
 unionstate.51.d: "With a few weeks having gone by since the inauguration of Martin Dies Jr. as President of the United States, it is clear that he casts a significantly shorter shadow than Huey Long did. A Texan attorney and son of another politician of the same name, he was torn between supporting the old Texan democratic political machine under John Nance Garner and the rising star Huey Long and the America First Party. In the end however, this worked to his advantage with his fierce anti-socialism combined with his ties to the establishment has allowed him to serve as a mouthpiece as the two southern based movements reconverge. Still, as questions about his legitimacy swirl, many wonder if he truly is in charge at all."
 unionstate.51.a: "A proper politician in unpleasant times."

 unionstate.52.t: "The Sixth Party System"
 unionstate.52.d: "The United States has undergone multiple party systems over the years as circumstances change and factions rise and fall. The Fifth Party System was an anomaly of sorts, with the formation of more than two major parties competing for national office. It seems that with the victory of the old establishment, things are quickly head back to the way things were. The America First Party of course nominally remains in power, a testament to the enduring momentum of the movement. However with the Kingfish gone, Dies and his allies have begun reconciling with the Dixiecrats and other conservative politicians with some rumours that he may even go so far as to shed the AFP label altogether when elections resume some day. Meanwhile, Republicans and progressive Democrats find themselves in the wilderness, searching for a platform to anchor themselves in. A power vacuum has emerged with the banning of the SPA, though with the overton window rapidly shifting right many feel they have no where to go."
 unionstate.52.a: "Let's see how long this one lasts."

 unionstate.53.t: "Reefer Madness A Theatrical Sensation"
 unionstate.53.d: "In our high-schools, in our colleges, even in our homes; there is a sinister villain lurking. It is smaller than a gun, kills more young men than car accidents, and is being used at every sock hop and Sadie Hawkins Day dance. Marihuana is it's name. Until now the adult public have been left in the dark about this sinsister sniff. The HUAC have gladly endorsed a new motion picture released now in theatres to alert the public. That motion picture is called Reefer Madness. This movie informs the public about the many detrimental effects of marihuana use. Already in several major cities, police departments are reporting an increase in arrests of marihuana peddlers."
 unionstate.53.a: "Why can't kids just smoke cigarettes like the rest of us?"

 unionstate.54.t: "Investigating the Klan"
 unionstate.54.d: "The Ku Klux Klan has caused significant trouble across the country, spurred on by the growing radicalism of the 1930s and the void in stability the civil war caused. Still, with order slowly being restored, many moderates in the establishment grow tired of their antics and have joined with progressive voices in demanding the government put a stop to their worst excesses.\n\nA series of hearings have been called in the House Un-American Activities Committee, though few have actually materialised. With the committee stacked with Dixiecrats including influential figures like John E. Rankin, popular perception is that the HUAC is deliberately dragging their feet. Still, with President Dies' legitimacy built on his ability to project stability, pressure is mounting for him to act."
 unionstate.54.a: "Tell them to hurry up with the hearings!"
 unionstate.54.b: "The Klan is an old American institution..."

 unionstate.55.t: "Dance Marathons Banned"
 unionstate.55.d: "The world weariness of the war, poverty, and sheer boredom is the root of all bad habits. For thousands of young people, they are drawn to the strange endurance ritual of marathon dancing. Although some cities adverise these events as 'walkathons', the lingo is in and dance halls are being occupied for days-straight with dancers. The HUAC has investigated these activites thoroughly, and have announced a ban on this type of event. The HUAC has found inhumane conditions within these halls. Dancers can be seen passing out from exhaustion, becoming sick on their feet, and a few even become hysterical. The excessive handholding, gyrating and sweating these dances induce is also a gateway to carnality unbecoming of Americans. All this was ample reason for the HUAC to officiate a ban on marathon dancing."
 unionstate.55.a: "Another national castrophe avoided."

 unionstate.56.t: "America First Fractures"
 unionstate.56.d: "The America First Party, an amalgamation of various right-wing American factions, has seen its unity unravel with its victory in the civil war and the ensuing public spats between its leadership. Founded in many ways as a direct reaction to partisan bickering by the old Republicans and Democrats, the chaotic tenure of the new government has sapped popular faith and enthusiasm. The emergence of Dies, a relatively little known representative and seen as an establishment crony, has caused many to fracture into other factions.\n\nSplinter parties are expected to emerge in the coming years, with the Longist political machine under Earl Long, William Lemke, and Charles Coughlin exploring talks of forming a \"Union Party\". Meanwhile, Gerald Smith and his wing have already tried forming a series of new (and unsuccessful) parties, settling on the name \"the Christian Nationalist Party\".\n\nOld supporters of the War Powers Committee have largely gone quiet, dogged by growing legal suspicion into their activities. While the fate of their leaders are still in question, particularly as investigators sort through details of alleged plots, most of the others have largely decided to quietly blend into the new order the best they can."
 unionstate.56.a: "It's sunny June no longer."

 unionstate.57.t: "Fear and Loathing in the halls of Congress"
 unionstate.57.d: "When the Great Depression first broke out, Martin Dies wrote in the Herald-Examiner that \"large alien population is the basic cause of unemployment\". Many shared this sentiment as the growing number of immigrants from Europe, Asia, and South America inflamed nativist sentiment. Congress has passed a series of legislation to restrict the number of migrants coming into the nation, appeasing nativists and labour. While some have cautioned that these bills represent a growing close-mindedness among the American people, President Dies is nevertheless expected to sign them without issue."
 unionstate.57.a: "America for Americans."

 unionstate.58.t: "Antarctic Snow Cruiser Decommissioned"
 unionstate.58.d: "The expedition of a lifetime, to the ends of the earth; bitterly cancelled. The 1939 Antartica Expedition was planned and funded with great anticipation before the country flew into civil war. The crown jewel of this expedition was intedned to be a new type of snow-mobile car. It now sits, abandoned, in the Navy's experimental testing grounds. This vehicle, standing taller than the tallest tank, was briefly considered for a mobile command base for Huey Long, should he need to be moved. The Department of the Navy, in a bit of flair, has decided to donate the behemoth to the government trust. The Snow Cruiser will be recomissioned and put at the whim of National Defense. Maybe someday, when our soldiers go marching over Canada or Russia, the Antarctic Snow Cruiser will be there to guide them."
 unionstate.58.a: "Someday, old girl."

 unionstate.59.t: "The Return of the Citizen's Alliance"
 unionstate.59.d: "President Dies, in reviewing the efforts across the country against radical syndicalism, has called upon the old Citizen's Alliance to reform. Starting as a secret society of patriots in Ohio, the alliance has an essential role in suppressing radicalism. The Alliance allowed money from business owners to go directly into the hands of community leaders. Community leaders at the local level, such as mayors or pastors, are the safety net for syndicalists. They rely on community charity, housing, and heating when on strike. Paresident Dies believes the Citizen's Alliance can, once again, direct funding into local communites to convince community leaders of the errors of syndicalism. If that fails, President Dies is ready to endorse any boycott of goods the Citizen's Alliance uncovers that is made by unionised labour."
 unionstate.59.a: "There's no way like the American Way!"

 unionstate.60.t: "Disappointment Clubs"
 unionstate.60.d: "Our of the corners of our homes, whispers can be heard. It has come through letters submitted to the HUAC anonymously that there is a new subversion in domestic labour. In the homes, the help are allegedly forming 'Dissapointment Clubs' to vent their secret opposition to the US government. Tipsters claim Disappointment Clubs secretly wished for the downfall of Huey Long, and the victory of syndicalists. It is alleged that, one day soon, the help will initate a General Strike against American homes. President Dies is worried, and believes that all this is controlled remotely by the most dangerous woman in America, Eleanor Roosevelt. The HUAC has sent discreet memos to politicians in every major city advising them to relinquish the help. The hardship of this choice may be great, but President Dies wants their disappointment to stay confined to backrooms."
 unionstate.60.a: "Curse that Eleanor Roosevelt!"

 unionstate.61.t: "The Republicans Rally"
 unionstate.61.d: "While the Republican party has taken a dent thanks to their poor handling of the Great Depression and the ensuing defeats of their favoured factions during the civil war, the GOP have demonstrated their resilience by quickly rebounding in their political activities even amidst a broader atmosphere of political repression. Exploiting their status as a fairly unambiguous \"establishment party\" to avoid confrontation with the new AFP-Democratic leadership, Republican chapters have sought to plug the gaps left behind by their rivals.\n\nThat said, the Republican Party is not the same party that it was, and indeed there is a growing current of \"new Republicans\" more in tune with the current political winds. In California for example, observers have noted the rising start of one Jack Tenney, a state senator who has sought nomination for Congress. Noted for his Chairmanship of California's own Senate Committee of Un-American Activities, he has been quoted as saying \"You can no more coexist with socialism than you can coexist with a nest of rattlesnakes.\" Investigating Hollywood for syndicalist infiltration, school textbooks for subversive materials, and insisting on loyalty oaths in California Universities, some claim he has outperformed even Dies' own leadership of HUAC.\n\nElsewhere, Robert E. Wood, a retired general and former Sears Executive, has been admitted as an honorary member of the New York Society of Cincinnati. Influential within the America First movement, he is said to have returned to the Republican party as a conservative leader, funding the Manion Forum with conservative talk-show host Clarence Manion.\n\nBoth men are suspected of harbouring Presidential ambitions of their own, and one day when elections resume commentators expect that they will make bids to unseat the largely unpopular Dies. Although it is hearsay, rumours are they have already chosen their slogan:"
 unionstate.61.a: "Had enough?"

 unionstate.62.t: "Myron Fagan and the Hollywood Blacklist"
 unionstate.62.d: "President Dies has finally met a man in Hollywood he can agree with, a screenwriter named Myron Fagan. Myron serves as the head of the Cinema Education Guild, a patriotic organisation of entertainers upset with the unionisation of Hollywood. The opposition Hollywood actors and executives have had for President Dies is well known. Until now there seemed no alternative, until Myron Fagan walked in. Myron has proposed to Dies the Cinema Education Guild be given equipment to spy on Hollyood figures. Agents and police to be allocated to follow movie stars, listen into executive conversations, and ensure that rumors of widespread syndicalisation are untrue. The only reservation Dies has is a letter sent by actor Ronald Reagan, claiming Myron Fagan in untrustworthy. Reagan claims that Myron is a covert anti-semite, and that Myron intends to replace the Screen Actors Guild with his own, making him a king-maker in entertainment."
 unionstate.62.a: "That's ridiculous! Give Myron what he needs."

 unionstate.63.t: "Civil Rights Congress"
 unionstate.63.d: "With the NAACP reeling from stinging political defeats and government harassment and many more militant activists having lost the institutional support the SPA and allies once provided, a power vacuum emerged within the civil rights movement. This vacuum seems to have been filled today, with the creation fo the Civil Rights Congress as a merger of the International Labor Defense, the National Federation for Constitutional Liberties, and the National Negro Congress. They have secured further support from both socialist and progressive factions, though face an uphill battle.\n\nDenouncing President Dies, HUAC, and continued lack of progress on segregation in America, they have called for a two-pronged strategy of litigation and demonstrations to promote change. They have called for the abolition of HUAC, protection for the rights of southern workers to unionise, and fair trials for African-Americans. These demands have led to the HUAC to denounce them as socialists and subversives, and an array of investigators including the FBI and IRS are monitoring their next steps.\n\nAlready, conflict has emerged with police attempting to break up their inaugural conference in Detroit. Undeterred, Congress has called for a \"Freedom Crusade\" in Washington to press President Dies on lynching, freedom for imprisoned socialists, and fair employment. Regardless of the fate of the CRC, it is clear that this topic will continue to dog America for years to come."
 unionstate.63.a: "They have adopted a line of militant skullduggery against America."

### Military Research ###
 unionstate.101.t: "The Future of Warfare"
 unionstate.101.d: "After a long reshuffling of former US departments, the American Union State has uncovered old classified weapons proposals. The two proposals that caught the most interest are ones authored by Robert Goddard and Vannevar Bush, each proposing an expensive weapon project to deter invasions. Fortunately, both men were recovered from their respective hiding places, and persuaded into updating their proposals. Goddard's plan is for a liquid fuel rocket to deliver stable explosive payloads across long distances. Vannevar Bush's is a theoretical utilisation of nuclear fission to create a bomb based on experiments done in Europe. Which plan should we pursue?"
 unionstate.101.a: "Goddard's Rocket."
 unionstate.101.b: "Vannevar Bush's Bomb."

 unionstate.102.t: "Missiles over White Sands"
 unionstate.102.d: "After months of testing in the Southwest, and publishing several classified papers, the first test launch is prepared. In a fenced off area outside White Sands, New Mexico, Goddard's rocket stands ready. The rocket's design incorporates liquid fuel and stabilisers devised by Goddard with flight mechanics devised by Lindbergh Aircraft. At the head is a lower tonnage explosive meant to detonate after a set amount of time spent flying. A successful arc and explosion turns the New Mexico skyline on fire."
 unionstate.102.a: "Nowhere is Safe."

 unionstate.103.t: "Nuclear Power in New Mexico"
 unionstate.103.d: "Hurdle after hurdle stood in between the American Union State and atomic weaponry. It began with a dearth of willing physicists and nuclear experts including Robert Oppenheimer who has yet to be located. Several other potential candidates signed a Humanist Declaration of pacifism abroad declaring their opposition to our programme. Therefore, Bush has had to resort to industrial technicians which extended the timeline. Finally, after much testing and assistance from George Kistiakowsky, the first atomic bomb is tested. Due to the extensive safety precautions take, the vital test yielded an impressive blast but poor documentation."
 unionstate.103.a: "We wear the Crown Atomic."

 unionstate.150.t: "Southern Governors Meet in Baton Rouge"
 unionstate.150.d: "A large crowd recently gathered outside the statehouse in Baton Rouge to congratulate Huey Long for defying the federal government. News agencies were soon to arrive on the scene, when suddenly the crowd began unfurling the battle flag of the old Confederacy. Sensing an impending political disaster, Huey Long had his men to confiscate these radical symbols of the Civil War. When the governors arrived, the press only saw the image of a defiant America determined to fight the illegitimate powers of federal corruption and syndicalist oppression. The governors are now meeting with Long inside the statehouse to determine the proper response to the federal government's deadline."
 unionstate.150.a: "A close call."

 unionstate.151.t: "The AFP Declaration of Legitimacy"
 unionstate.151.d: "While many of the southern senators were in favour of drafting new amendments on the spot, the urge to retain the legitimacy of the continuous United States prevailed. The AFP Declaration of Legitimacy was drafted in Baton Rouge over the course of a few days, painstakingly listing their grievances with the Federal Government. This declaration outlined the lack of protection the Federal Government gave to citizens, and the role of the state to protect the welfare of the poor. The signatories declare that it is within their constitutional right to organise a militia against tyranny, and that the Federal Government's deadline should not only be ignored it must be defied."
 unionstate.151.a: "Annuit coeptis."

 unionstate.152.t: "The American Union State Congress Convenes"
 unionstate.152.d: "Through the grapevine, dozens of congressmen have heard of Huey Long's assembly in Baton Rouge. Some came to wish Long well and stayed, others simply to court favour with the revolution. These meetings in Baton Rouge began to take on a Congressional appearance, with Coughlin standing as the President of the attending senators. Aware of the growing determination to defy the federal government, and that this lack of willingness to negotiate meant civil war was all but certain, a large number of politicians have slinked away to the north... though those that remain seem more determined than ever to see victory."
 unionstate.152.a: "They'll get theirs!"

 unionstate.153.t: "Deadline Looms"
 unionstate.153.d: "As the federal government's deadline looms, it has become clear there will be no budging on either side. Across the part of the country controlled by Long's supporters, an army formed of militia and the Minutemen has been raised and a growing determination to see the country remade by force has taken hold. The federal government, in turn, has also made it clear they no longer see a path to compromise."
 unionstate.153.a: "It is only a matter of time."

 unionstate.500.t: "The Army Requisitions Civilian Trucks"
 unionstate.500.d: "After Patton announced his Motorisation program for the new American Army, a proposal was sent to President Long to decide on the requisition of civilian vehicles in order to supply our fast-growing army. With his approval, we have begun seizing vehicles from the civilian populace, although to our surprise, some proud patriots line up next to our storages to volunteer their vehicles for the incoming fight. While not all their vehicles have proven to be useful for us, we have managed to requisition a fair amount of trucks which can either be modified to transport troops with ease or which are sturdy enough to transport our troops at once."
 unionstate.500.a: "The Kingfish Thanks your Service"

 unionstate.501.t: "First Paradrop Exercise"
 unionstate.501.d: "While technically speaking, the first paradropping exercises were practised in 1930 with biplanes dropping machine gun squads, today a major breakthrough has been achieved in the airborne department. After finishing a rigorous conditioning and training programme started two weeks ago, a lottery was made to decide the jumping order of the experimental paradropping platoon made up of volunteers. When the Douglas C-33 took off from Lawson Airfield and finally was put into position to start the experiment, Second Lieutenant William T. Ryder became the first American Paratrooper after making his jump and landing near Fort Benning. The second man, however, refused to jump, and so the first enlisted man to become a paratrooper was Pvt. William N. "Red" King, and then the remaining 8 platoon members in the aircraft. After their touchdown, they quickly reached the rendezvous point and completed their exercise goals, making the experiment a success."
 unionstate.501.a: "Start Scheduling New Jumps"

 unionstate.502.t: "Formation of the First Paratrooper Divisions"
 unionstate.502.d: "With the success of our scheduled mass jumps and with the blessing of General Patton, Fort Benning had begun taking volunteers for paratrooper units. While originally the high training standards and relatively high mortal risk initially caused few volunteers to show up, the high command authorised a triplication of the paratrooper wage as opposed to the foot soldier wage. Soon enough, the 501st Parachute Battalion was formed, quickly followed by other battalions and regiments. After a week recruitment, the number of volunteers was enough to form 5 paratrooper divisions for us to utilise. While these divisions still lack combat experience, this breakthrough in Airborne tactics should not be underestimated, and the High Command is looking forward to seeing their investment in these divisions pay off."

 TEX_huey_long: "Huey Pierce Long"
 TEX_huey_long_desc_body: "Like many people of his stature and personality, Governor Huey Pierce Long is known by many names, although the most common one is \"the Kingfish\". Born to a poor rural family, he clawed and bit his way to a legal career over the course of his life, all while gaining notoriety as one of the most talented legal minds of recent history, and as a dedicated defender of the interests of the poor. Within a shockingly brief time, he was already one of the most famous politicians in Louisiana, and so became one of the youngest governors in its history as a result.\n\nLouisiana would become the model province for a set of programs and policies which would collectively be labelled 'Share Our Wealth'. Long built a vast public services apparatus and an unprecedented system of social spending upon a patronage system which swiftly transformed Louisiana into a dictatorship, with the Long family at the helm. In America's increasingly volatile conditions, however, such forceful measures to help the poor became increasingly popular and thus formed the policy backbone of the America First Party, to whom Louisiana was an ideal to reach towards. Thanks to Long's increasingly wide and fragile reach of contacts and alliances across the whole country, it grew far out of Louisiana"

When Congress debated whether to demand the full repayment of Canadian war debt, Fish was the strongest advocate. This position was ultimately unpopular with Republicans, but a Louisiana senator named Huey long defended him. Fish concurred by blaming the syndicalists for the ensuing government catastrophe. Long would go so far as to shelter Hamilton Fish from the anti-progressive marauders that threatened his home when the Union State won the war.

Until he became 21, he decided to study in the Virginia Military Institute, and after graduating in 1919, he attended the non-commissioned officer school and Officer Candidates School of the Marine Corps, earning the rank of second lieutenant. In 1921, he was assigned to the Gendarmerie d'Haiti and would see over forty skirmishes fighting the Caco rebels and becoming adjutant to Alexander Vandegrift. After four years of serving in garrison duty in the United States, he'd be assigned to the Marine detachment in the Nicaraguan National Guard in December 1928. In Nicaragua, he led several engagements against the Sandinista forces, where he was able to prevail despite being outnumbered significantly by the Nicaraguan rebels, and earning the Navy Cross medal. He returned to the United States in 1931, and completed the Company Officers Course at Fort Benning which he had left pending in 1928, graduating in June 1932 as a Captain and returning to Nicaragua in September. There, he took part in the Battle of El Sauce, where he earned his promotion to Major. He'd be then transferred to command the 'China Marines' in Shanghai in 1933 and would return to America in June 1936 to serve as an instructor at The Basic School. With the nation spiralling into Civil War, Puller was persuaded by Cates to join the American Civil War as Puller was indecisive as to who to support. With his arrival in Louisiana, Puller's actions in Nicaragua and Haiti had earned the respect of many members of the staff and Huey Long's cabinet, who pushed for his promotion to Brigadier General.§!"
