Renowned for his great collections of music and literature, and singular amongst Indian lords for his patronage of higher-learning, Krishna Raja Wadiyar yearns for enlightenment. His vision of an Indian 'city-on-a-hill' however, was nearly dashed with the end of the British Empire and the turmoil that followed. Now, as leader of Mysore, he strives to illuminate southern India, and perhaps one day, the entire sub-continent.§!"
