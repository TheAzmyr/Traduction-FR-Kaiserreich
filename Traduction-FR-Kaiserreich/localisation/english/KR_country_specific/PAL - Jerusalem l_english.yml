 pal_alijah: "Third Aliyah"
 pal_alijah_desc: "Enshrined in the Balfour Declaration and the later Jerusalem Accords, the Mutasarrifate of Jerusalem (M.O.J.) was opened up for Jewish settlement. Flooding in from the aftermath of the war in Eastern Europe, thousands of Jews have settled in the International Zone to great anger of both locals and the Sublime Porte alike.\n\nNonetheless these immigrants and settlers bring with them their skills and crafts, which has greatly enriched the economy of the Mutasarrifate both for the Muslim Palestinians and the Jewish arrivals."
 pal_sectarian_divide: "Sectarian Divide"
 pal_sectarian_divide_desc: "Feeling betrayed by the international community and their Caliph alike, the Sunni Arabs of the region are vehemently opposing the rapid growth of the Jewish community within their homeland leading to civil disobedience, protests and strikes. The International Gendarmerie, stationed in the zone to maintain order is struggling as tensions keep rising with every new arrival."

 pal_shortage_of_goods_desc: "As the downward trend continues across the globe, the import and export of agricultural goods are seriously hit across the entire Zone. The protectionist Ottoman Empire has drastically increased tariffs in an effort to stop its own decline but due to the special nature of our entity, this has caused massive ramifications to even the most basic of supply lines.

### Events
 pal.1.t: "The Mutasarrifate of Jerusalem in 1936"
 pal.1.d: "Created as an international zone during the closing stage of the Weltkrieg, the Mutasarrifate of Jerusalem has grown almost completely out of control. Its borders defined by an arbitrary demarcation based on the defensive fortifications of the 'Allenby Line', the zone not only splits in half Palestine but also destroyed initial attempts by the Zionist community to settle around Haifa. By ways of compromising with all parties involved, a convoluted administrative structure was created which has left neither party happy. Built on top of the old Kudus-I-Serif Mutasarrifate, this region was expanded southwards towards the Red Sea to ensure a harbour outside of the Mediterranean.\n\nThe administrative structure of the M.O.J. (Mutasarrifate of Jerusalem) is comprised of two main governing bodies: The International Council, consisting of representatives from Germany, the USA, Austria-Hungary, Britain and the Ottoman Empire is the de facto power in the region, regulating immigration, taxation and overseeing the attached International Gendarmerie force. A second body, consists of representatives of all the religious movements in the region and acts as the local government in close cooperation with the International Council which oversees their budget. At the head of this entire structure sits the Ottoman Mutasarrif, appointed by the Sultan himself but left virtually powerless to govern what is de jure still a province of the Sublime Porte.\n\nThe Palestinian Arabs however are deeply discontent with the arranged structure and the continued growth of the Jewish population, further boosted by increasing immigration to the 'Holy Land' has left them at odds with the International Gendarmerie and the tax collecting agencies. Serving as the basis for more radical change in the Middle East, the region also serves as a hotbed of awakening Arab nationalism, further fanned by the regime in Cairo. The Caliph finds himself tied as within the Ottoman Empire, calls increase for the abolition of the zone but unable to act unless he wants to suffer the ire of the powers that be. Nonetheless, operatives from the Porte and propaganda broadcasts transmitted from neighbouring Haifa are prepping the Palestinian population for the return of Ottoman authority and assisting the resistance in speeding the collapse of the M.O.J."
 pal.1.a: "Things are not looking well."

 pal.2.t: "Economic Depression Hits the M.O.J."
 pal.2.d: "The collapse of the Berlin stock exchange has sent shockwaves throughout the world to great detriment of our own region. As the Ottoman Empire desperately attempts to soften the initial blow, Palestine has been hit even harder. Our almost complete reliance on the international market has left us especially vulnerable as quasi all sectors but the agricultural one have imploded."
 pal.2.a: "This is a disaster!"

 pal.3.t: "Protest in Jaffa"
 pal.3.d: "As the economic depression becomes worse by the day and the International Council continues to avoid measures to soften the blow, citizens of both Jaffa and Tel Aviv have taken to the streets today to demand intervention by their 'government' and to restore ties to the Sublime Porte. Even though the nature of these protests was peaceful in nature, gendarmerie arrested a few of the Muslims attending to 'avoid further escalation'."
 pal.3.a: "Order must be kept at all times!"

 pal.4.t: "Shortages Continue Increasing"
 pal.4.d: "With the international trade still in disarray, shortages of coal, oil, food and industrial products keep rising in the M.O.J. Local manufacturing has almost completely stopped as both imports and exports have grinded to a complete standstill. Dockworkers in Jaffa have been laid off dramatically the last few weeks as the most important harbour of the M.O.J. continues to suffer from the lack of shipping. Relief packages by the Ottoman Empire have been halted at the border of the DMZ and rejected by Gendarmerie forces to avoid increasing the reliance on Damascus and stop possible weapon smuggling for the Palestinian resistance."
 pal.4.a: "We just have to weather the storm"

 pal.5.t: "American Forces Depart the M.O.J."
 pal.5.d: "As America descends once more into Civil War, [USA.GetLeader] has given the order to recall all active American personnel from Palestine to reinforce the homefront. Having served as one of the most important partners in the International Gendarmerie since its inception in 1920, the withdrawal of the United States has made its forces even more thinly stretched than before."
 pal.5.a: "Johnny is marching home again"

 pal.6.t: "Smuggling in the Sinai"
 pal.6.d: "The economic crisis has invigorated the Palestinian resistance once more giving rise to an increased demand for arms and support from our government. Old smuggling routes through the Sinai have been reactivated as the International Gendarmerie force struggles to patrol its vast territory. Not only arms are being brought in though as the growing shortage of basic goods has forced many Palestinians to resort to the Black Market which is seeing a steady stream of supplies from inside our territory."
 pal.6.a: "The whole rotten corpse will be brought down from within!"

 pal.7.t: "Radio Free Palestine Increases Operations"
 pal.7.d: "Founded as a radio broadcast to rally public opinion against the M.O.J. and Jewish settlement in general, it has recently increased its operations dramatically as under the table dealings with the Ittihad party have enabled it to set up further posts closer to the border. Although the government denies all responsibility over the organisation to foreign diplomats of the Porte and the Jerusalem Accords representatives, it is no secret that they tie into our governments designs on the Middle East and are used to focus and encourage Arab discontent in the Ottoman Empire."
 pal.7.a: "'Is it not the Caliph who has sacrificed you so he could keep his crown?'"

 pal.8.t: "Fourth Aliyah Commences"
 pal.8.d: "Political developments across the globe have caused great disarray to its settled Jewish population. Now the USA, beacon of freedom and liberty has been hit by another devastating civil war causing thousands of refugees to spill over to all corners of the world. The Jewish population as well, seeing itself targeted by [APG.GetNameDef], is suffering, with many now pursuing the Zionist dream. Flocking into the harbour of Tel Aviv, thousands of educated Jews are bringing with them their capital and experience to help create the new Jewish home. Arab discontent at this new influx of Jewish settlers is already mounting further fuelled by the unrest caused by the economic fallout and gendarmerie forces are struggling to keep the order in all corners of the M.O.J."
 pal.8.a: "Welcome to the M.O.J."

 pal.9.t: "Increased Eastern European Migration"
 pal.9.d: "Anti-semitic regimes have taken hold over Eastern European nations leading to an increasing amount of pogroms and discrimination against their Jewish population. With no place to go and their backs turned against the walls of Russia, many are embarking on the long journey South towards Palestine to hopefully find a safehaven. Unwilling to further increase tensions in the M.O.J. multiple members of the local government have asked the Council to close immigration as further encouraging it only plays into the hands of the Arab nationalists."
 pal.9.a: "Welcome to the M.O.J."

 pal.10.t: "Increasing Sectarian Divide"
 pal.10.d: "The rapid increase in Jewish settlers arriving on the shores of Tel Aviv is only further bolstering the Arab aversion to the M.O.J. leading to increasing crimes against settlers and protest actions throughout the region. Mediation from the Mutasarrif has failed to accomplish much as the Mufti of Jerusalem continues to preach for a closure to Jewish immigration."
 pal.10.a: "There is no reason to blow up this little bit of friction"

 pal.11.t: "Protests Escalate in Jerusalem"
 pal.11.d: "Called on by local Arab notables and leaders, a mass protest was held in the city of Jerusalem earlier today to pressure the Council into the closure of the immigration office. What started as a peaceful protest quickly escalated after gendarmerie forces started cracking down on some of its leaders. In response, the protestors started throwing stones at the windows of foreign businesses and assaulting foreign nationals on the streets of the city. Eventually the authorities were able to subdue the protest before further violence could spread but with resources spread thin, the action has scared the International Council that the situation might be far more explosive than initially thought."
 pal.11.a: "A curfew is enacted in Jerusalem"

 pal.12.t: "Council Closes off Further Jewish Immigration"
 pal.12.d: "In response to increasing calls by the Muslim population and the Jerusalem riot only a few weeks earlier, the Council has officially decreed an end to Jewish immigration and has decreed that no further settlers will be allowed entry into the zone until an accord has been reached with the local leaders. Whilst it is unlikely to fully stop immigrants from coming in due to the limited resources of the Council to enforce the decree, this marks an important turning point in the policy of the M.O.J."
 pal.12.a: "Let's hope this calms the Arabs down"

 pal.13.t: "Riots in Jaffa"
 pal.13.d: "Not silenced by the reversal of the immigration policy, riots and protests continued to shake Palestine further encouraged by both Egyptian and Arab movements alike. The breaking point was finally reached in Jaffa earlier today as yet another action against the authorities turned bloody after overwhelmed Gendarmerie opened fire on the Arab protestors leading to the deaths of 23 Arabs. Various governments in the Middle East have already reacted to the events demanding the immediate departure of International forces and the abolishment of the M.O.J. before further violence breaks out. Furthermore this first display of open conflict between the two groups will likely lead to repression against the Jewish settlers and continued actions against the authorities."
 pal.13.a: "This isn't going so well anymore..."

 pal.14.t: "Violence in the M.O.J."
 pal.14.d: "Increasing Jewish migration and a decrease in resources after the American forces pulled out last year has caused violence to erupt once more in the M.O.J. leading to the deaths of multiple dozen Arabs in peacekeeping and strikebreaking actions. Our government has in response increased its calls for the abolishment of the entity, pointing out that only Ottoman rule can end the crisis peacefully. Various Jewish groups across our empire are also calling on the Sultan to take a more decisive stance towards the M.O.J. as they fear retaliation by their Arab brethren for the actions by the International Gendarmerie."
 pal.14.a: "Send new orders to our Mutasarrif"

 pal.15.t: "General Strike in Palestine"
 pal.15.d: "Organised by various Arab National Committees a general strike of all Arabs engaged in labour, transport and shopkeeping has been called to force the departure of international forces. Listing their demands as 1) Prohibition of all Jewish immigration now and in the future 2) Prohibition of the transfer of territory from Arabs to Jews 3) Immediate withdrawal of the International Gendarmerie, a vast portion of the Arab population is primed to partake in the action encouraged by religious leaders and influential families. The Council has already reported that it will crack down heavily on any attempts to force its departure and gendarmerie forces have already been sent into Jaffa to arrest possible ringleaders of the strike."
 pal.15.a: "We will not give up our position!"

 pal.16.t: "General Strike Endures"
 pal.16.d: "Attempts to crush the strike with force have failed as the entire region has been paralysed by the continued action. Everything from the railways to the administration to the industry has completely laid down the work. Furthermore open conflict has started to roar up again as sniper actions in various cities around the region targetting foreign nationals and guerrilla actions against the Jewish settlers and the Gendarmerie are shaking the countryside. Thinly spread gendarmerie forces are attempting to keep order and the destruction of hundreds of homes in Jaffa in an attempt to flush out the rebels backfired greatly leading to even more pressure in both the city and Jerusalem itself.\n\nAs various partners of the Jerusalem Accords are entangled in domestic affairs with world war looming ever more, the International Council has commissioned a report on the continued viability of the M.O.J. and has opened talks with the Ottoman government to pursue possible solutions."
 pal.16.a: "All is falling down"

 pal.17.t: "Egypt Demands a seat on the Council"
 pal.17.d: "Throwing themselves up as the defenders of all Arabs, the Egyptian government is using the crisis in Palestine to increase its power projection in the region. Answering calls from various Arab organisations in Palestine, Egypt argues that it should have a say in the future of the M.O.J. and its administration. The Ottoman delegation has already vetoed the proposal but the action shows that conflict is brewing ever stronger between the two regional powers and that the M.O.J. might find itself in the middle of their battlefield on short notice."
 pal.17.a: "Organise a congress to settle the affair once and for all"

 pal.18.t: "Congress of Haifa Opens Its Doors"
 pal.18.d: "As violence continues to escalate across the region, the various signatories of the Jerusalem Accords have agreed to partake in a congress to decide the future of the M.O.J. The Ottoman delegation has already put all its cards on the table and has demanded the immediate reunification with Kostantiniye pointing out that the current chaos is fully to blame on those that took it away from the Porte in 1920. Meanwhile the Egyptian government is openly calling for its attachment to Egypt, claiming that the Arabs should be united and that the Ottoman actions during the Weltkrieg are what led to its creation in the first place. The Committee sent out to investigate the sustainability with the limited Gendarmerie forces available has also returned with a negative answer, proscribing its reunification to the Ottoman Empire but with an overseeing panel ensuring the Jews are kept safe from reprisals and granted land to settle on."
 pal.18.a: "The representatives will decide"

 pal.19.t: "Congress of Haifa: Future of the M.O.J."
 pal.19.d: "As one of the signatories of the Jerusalem Accords in 1920, we have kept a representative on the International Council of the M.O.J. ever since. Recent events in Palestine however have called these powers back together to decide over the future of the international zone as the entire region wages a war against the International Gendarmerie tasked with its security. Thinly stretched forces, limited resources and aggressive moves from both the Sublime Porte and the Egyptians are threatening its future and as the committee tasked with researching its sustainability has given a negative report, many in our own administration are questioning its continued existence."
 pal.19.a: "Abolish the M.O.J."
 pal.19.b: "We will not withdraw!"

 pal.20.t: "International Council Votes for the Abolition of the M.O.J."
 pal.20.d: "In response to issues in Palestine, the signatories of the Jerusalem Accords have voted in favour of its abolition and the reintegration into the Ottoman Empire. Proposals to return the Sinai to Egypt were vetoed by our representatives to great annoyance of both Cairo and the other powers which ultimately conceded to putting it under joint control by both nations, something those two have already denounced. Whether or not this solves the Palestine issue remains to be seen but what is for certain is that conflict between the Ottomans and Egypt is only starting.\n\nWith the last paperwork still left to be done and an orderly transfer of authority from the Gendarmerie to the Ottoman army being organised, the M.O.J. will continue to function for a week longer although it will no longer have the power to decide on internal matters, now a strictly Ottoman affair."
 pal.20.a: "A wise decision"

 pal.21.t: "Sinai Question"
 pal.21.d: "As the abolition of the M.O.J. approaches after the signatories of the Jerusalem Accords agreed on its reintegration into the Ottoman Empire, issues still remain over the disputed Sinai peninsula. The Ottomans claim it as part of the M.O.J. and before that as part of their Egyptian territory although their main drive seems centred around extending control over the Suez Canal. A resolution offered by the Council to return the Sinai is still under consideration but strongly attacked by the Ottoman representatives. With the Ottoman army mobilising to garrison the region, time is running out to retake control and launch our offensive into the Ottoman Empire as once entrenched it is unlikely we will succeed in dislodging their army which will be positioned within striking distance of our capital."
 pal.21.a: "Occupy the peninsula"
 pal.21.b: "We will await their decision"

 pal.22.t: "Congress of Haifa : Future of the Sinai"
 pal.22.d: "The Egyptian government has requested the return of the Sinai Peninsula, threatening to go to war over it if their demands aren't met. The Ottoman representatives at the congress continue to oppose all regulations to include the Egyptian into the debate and have now been sidelined in an attempt to prevent Palestine from becoming a battlefield between these two nations."
 pal.22.a: "Egypt will receive the Sinai"
 pal.22.b: "The Porte will receive the Sinai"

 pal.23.t: "Council Votes Against the Return of the Sinai"
 pal.23.d: "In a not so shocking turn of events, the proposal to return the disputed peninsula to our control was shot down at the Congress of Haifa and assigned to the Ottoman Empire. Whilst evidently a large blow to our prestige, the Egyptian army stands ready at the Suez to retake the Sinai by force before Ottoman troops can reinforce the region waiting only for the King's command."
 pal.23.a: "Invade the M.O.J."
 pal.23.b: "We seek no conflict with the Porte"

 pal.24.t: "Egypt Crosses the Suez"
 pal.24.d: "In blatant breach of the conclusions reached at Haifa, the Egyptian army has crossed the Suez with the intentions of fully occupying the M.O.J. The closest army units in Damascus and Beirut, already on stand-by for the duration of the congress should the conclusion been less desirable, are ready to counter the Egyptians and are now solely awaiting the command of their Padishah."
 pal.24.a: "To war!"

 pal.25.t: "International Council Votes against the Abolition of the M.O.J."
 pal.25.d: "In yet another sign of European treachery, the International Council has decreed its opposition to the abolition of the M.O.J... Army units mobilised in Damascus and Beirut however in preparation for another betrayal have been granted marching orders to re-militarise the M.O.J. by force to great anger of both the International Community and the Egyptian government."
 pal.25.a: "We will not stand for yet another insult!"

 pal.26.t: "Ottoman Army Moves into the M.O.J."
 pal.26.d: "Betrayed by the International Council, the Porte has decided to take affairs into their own hands and have ordered the re-militarisation of the entire M.O.J. including the disputed Sinai peninsula. With the Ottoman army mobilising to garrison the region, time is running out to retake control and launch our offensive into the Ottoman Empire as once entrenched it is unlikely we will succeed in dislodging their army which will be positioned within striking distance of our capital."
 pal.26.a: "Move into the Sinai to force its return"
 pal.26.b: "Invade the Ottoman Empire"

 pal.27.t: "Egypt Invades the Sinai"
 pal.27.d: "In response to our actions in Palestine, the Egyptian army has invaded the Sinai peninsula hoping to pressure us into returning it to them. With Egyptian aims clearly greater than just the little strip of desert, it may be wiser however to make an example out of them and put them down before other nations start sensing weakness."
 pal.27.a: "To war!"

 pal.28.t: "Congress of Haifa: Sinai"
 pal.28.d: "In a shocking turn of events the International Council has assigned the Sinai to us and has requested Ottoman troops withdraw from the disputed peninsula. Since it is unlikely this will stop the Ottoman army, it may be wise to continue the offensive whilst we still have the element of surprise instead of getting bogged down in the trenches of Palestine."
 pal.28.a: "Reinforce the Sinai"
 pal.28.b: "To war!"

 pal.29.t: "Pole Committee Publishes Report"
 pal.29.d: "Headed by Sir Felix Pole, former chairman of Britain's Great Western Railway, the Pole Committee was tasked last year with investigating possible infrastructural expansion in the M.O.J. and solving the ever-increasing financial troubles of the Palestinian Railways. Also tasked with improving the local stations and routes between Jerusalem, Jaffa, and Tel Aviv, the committee has now reported that substantial financial investment will be necessary to solve both congestion issues and the connection to the Ottoman Haifa.\n\nIt suggests the construction of a direct line from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem through Rishon LeZion to a junction with the Jerusalem line at the Niana. Furthermore, the report also criticises the lack of investment in the port of Jaffa, its hazardous rocks forming a perilous trip for any ocean-going vessel. Therefore he has requested a complete rebuilding of the harbour and an extension of the railroad from Jaffa station into the new harbour zone."
 pal.29.a: "These findings will be brought into consideration"
 pal.29.b: "Palestine would do better if it realigns itself with the Porte!"
 pal.29.c: "Most interesting"

 pal.30.t: "DDY Absorbs the Palestine Railways"
 pal.30.d: "Caused by looming bankruptcy of the Palestine Railways, the Ottoman State Railways or DDY have been able to purchase them and have reintegrated them with the main Ottoman lines. Already plans are made to swap railway gauges to tie them better to the existing Ottoman net and the creation of a direct line between Haifa and Jaffa for both goods and passengers."
 pal.30.a: "He who controls the railroad, controls the people"

 pal.31.t: "Coup d'État in Cairo"
 pal.31.d: "[EGY.GetLeader] was awoken to the sound of gunfire earlier today as a group of conspirators stormed the palace in an attempt to remove him from power. Calling themselves the Society of Justice, the group was planning to kill [EGY.GetLeader] and restore Abbas II to the throne. The last Ottoman Khedive, Abbas II has recently seen an increase in popularity across the Muslim world as his Islamist ideas and history as leader of Egypt have given rise to various groups wishing for his return. Whilst adored by the people, [EGY.GetLeader] is less loved by his officer corps and government who see in his desires for absolute control and his general lack of knowledge concerning statecraft a recipe for disaster.\n\nNonetheless the failed coup attempt has come to the advantage of the Cairo regime as the close relation between the Khedive and the Ottoman government has shifted public opinion squarely against the Turks. [EGY.GetLeader] himself has already called the attack on his life a vicious plan by the imperialist Turks to smother Arab independence and has been heard taking an aggressive approach to the situation, calling for immediate sanctions on the Turks with some even saying that there was a mention of war with the Porte."
 pal.31.a: "The Turks will pay for this!"

 pal.32.t: "Mutasarrif Sagay Steps Down"
 pal.32.d: "With a change of regime in the capital, the OHF associated Mutasarrif has been thanked for his services and recalled to Kostantiniye. In line with the decentralist rhetoric of the ruling HIF, a local candidate has been appointed to the position. Raghib al-Nashashibi, member of the powerful Nashashibi family has been chosen as his ideas of cooperation with the Jewish community and moderate approach to the boiling crisis are a welcome addition for the central government."
 pal.32.a: "Good luck!"

 pal.33.t: "Profits from the Suez International Zone"
 pal.33.d: "With the successful re-opening of the Suez Canal and the creation of an internationally governed and economically liberal zone, it was only a matter of time before the profits for the SUEZ company would reach new heights. Since our nation has per the agreements of the Port Said Convention received shares in the SUEZ company, we are now also reaping the benefits of our investment whilst our banks and businessmen are establishing enterprises along the canal."
 pal.33.a: "A great day for capitalism!"

 pal.34.t: "The Port Said Hospital"
 pal.34.d: "Established by the British army for their operations in the Middle East and Gallipoli during the Weltkrieg, the Hospital of Port Said has been developed into a key medical station on the route connecting East to West. The international statute of the institution, protected by the Red Cross, has ensured great advancements in medical sciences and serves as a place for soldiers and civilians of all nations fighting in the Greater Middle Eastern region to receive fast treatment."
 pal.34.a: "Great!"

### Pan-Arab agitation events
 palarb.1.t: "Anti-Zionist Protest in Baghdad"
 palarb.1.d: "Organised by students from the Baghdad Law College and Iraqi groups such as the Young Muslim Society, protests are rocking the capital of the Iraqi region. They are expressing their outrage towards the increasing Zionist settlements in the M.O.J. and calling on all Muslims in the empire to protect their Palestinian brethren from this threat."
 palarb.1.a: "Disturbing."

 palarb.2.t: "Anti-Zionist Actions in Iraq"
 palarb.2.d: "After protests were ultimately quelled by the Wali of Baghdad for their disruptive nature, various Arab and Muslim groups expressed their grief in different ways. Days of mourning have been declared, prayers recited for the souls of all who perished in Palestine, and newspapers appear bordered in black.\n\nEven more disturbing is a romantic attachment to the flag of the failed Arab revolt which has regularly started to show up all across gatherings. Although its usage is officially banned by the state, many Arab gendarmerie units are refusing to intervene causing its distribution to increase at a rapid pace."
 palarb.2.a: "This is starting to get out of hand."

 palarb.3.t: "Murder in Baghdad"
 palarb.3.d: "As tensions continue to mount in the M.O.J. and aggressive action is undertaken by the International Gendarmerie, relations between Muslims and Jews within the Ottoman Empire itself are also deteriorating.\n\nLast week two Jews were shot in the streets of Baghdad by “unknown persons” either for personal or political motives. A few days later another Jew was killed, prompting demands from the Jewish community in the city for gendarmerie protection with which the Wali complied. Although further attacks have thus far not occurred, this only further confirms fears of increasing instability in the Mashriq."
 palarb.3.a: "Most disturbing."

 palarb.4.t: "Chief Rabbi Denounces the Zionist Programme"
 palarb.4.d: "Continued attacks on the Jewish community in Baghdad and threats in local newspapers demanding that the Rabbi expresses his opposition to the Zionist project and international Jewry in general, have forced the Chief Rabbi of the city to ultimately comply.\n\nTo further relieve tensions amongst the Muslim population, meetings to “explain” the Palestine situation were organised in Baghdad mosques after prayers commemorating the Ascent of the Prophet. Whether it was the message or the high attendance of plainclothes policemen which stopped further escalation is unclear."
 palarb.4.a: "A wise decision."

 palarb.5.t: "Society for the Defence of Palestine forms"
 palarb.5.d: "Fostered by General Taha al-Hashimi, brother of the Baghdadi Wali Yasin al-Hashimi, the Society for the Defence of Palestine was formed earlier this week. Primarily created to collect donations for the Arab mujahidin fighting in Palestine, they are however also an important conduit for Arab nationalism as direct action from the government against the M.O.J. remains absent.\n\nNonetheless taking action against the group may be dangerous as the family connection between its founder and the Baghdadi Wali and War Hero, Yasin could lead to unfortunate consequences if not handled carefully."
 palarb.5.a: "Shut down the SDP."
 palarb.5.b: "Refrain from intervening."

 palarb.6.t: "Arab Desperados Leave for Palestine"
 palarb.6.d: "Coming from within the Ottoman army stationed in Iraq and Syria, a small group of volunteers and desperados has deserted the force to join the Palestinian guerrilla movements. Presumably led by Fawzi al-Qawuqji, an Ottoman officer of Syrian descent, the group is reported to be well armed and receiving covert support from the Walis of the Mashriq."
 palarb.6.a: "Let's hope the International Council gets the hint."

 palarb.7.t: "Creation of the Yavuz Sultan Selim Association"
 palarb.7.d: "Based around the illustrious Sultan Selim I who conquered the entire Mamluk Sultanate in the early 16th Century, Turkish and Arab intellectuals have come together to press the Sultan for a resolution to the Palestinian crisis.\n\nOrganising debates, political fora and teaching local Arabs of the ties binding Turks and Arabs together over the last few centuries, a large focus is placed on teaching about the history of Ottoman Palestine and the prosperity it has encountered under the wing of the Caliph.\n\nSome have however discredited the association, calling it a propaganda stunt of the Kostantiniye government who is finding it harder and harder by the day to find support for its Ottomanist ideology. Foreign observers in the meanwhile call it a stunt by the Grand Vizier to increase support amongst his population for military intervention in the region."
 palarb.7.a: "Gods we were strong then."

 palarb.8.t: "Protests in Haifa"
 palarb.8.d: "Constituting the Northern part of what could be called Ottoman Palestine, the province of Haifa has long served as an economic centrepoint for the region. With the demarcation of the M.O.J. borders in 1920 based on an arbitrary position of the frontlines at the time, much of the economic connections between the North and South were disrupted. The growing Jewish community in the region was largely displaced in the following months to great anger of both Jews and Arabs alike.\n\nAs tensions continue to rise in the M.O.J., so have Palestinian Arabs in Haifa taken to the streets in support of their Southern brethren. Calling upon the Caliph to protect Islam from this foreign invasion, to reunite Palestine and to make a stand against imperial encroachment, thousands are marching down the city's narrow streets."
 palarb.8.a: "This is getting out of hand real fast."

 palarb.9.t: "Chief Rabbi Haim Ishak Saki Denounces the M.O.J."
 palarb.9.d: "Usually not a man easy to react to political developments within the Empire, the Chief Rabbi of Constantinople (or Hakham Bashi) has decided to openly proclaim his support for the Ottoman government in their attempts to reintegrate the Palestinian region. Referencing the long and mutually cooperative history of Jews within the Ottoman system, he has attacked the Zionists whose primarily European mindset have no idea of the damage they are inflicting on the relations between Muslim and Jew in the Orient.\n\nSupport from Rabbis in Yemen, Baghdad and Tripolitania has arrived at the Hahambasilik (Chief Rabbinate) in the capital as they too experience increasing anti-Jewish attacks caused by the agitated Muslim population of the Empire. Although their words are unlikely to have any effect on policy in the region, it's the last in a long line of desperate attempts to de-escalate tensions."
 palarb.9.a: "We are grateful for your support."

### News events about events in Palestine
 palnews.1.t: "American Forces Depart the M.O.J."
 palnews.1.d: "As America descends once more into Civil War, [USA.GetLeader] has given the order to recall all active American personnel from Palestine to reinforce the homefront.\n\nHaving served as one of the most important partners in the International Gendarmerie since its inception in 1920, the withdrawal of the United States has made its forces even more thinly stretched than before. As the situation further deteriorates, German troops have been unwilling to fully retreat as public support in Germany for their involvement remains high."
 palnews.1.a: "Johnny is marching home again."

 palnews.2.t: "Protests Escalate in Jerusalem"
 palnews.2.d: "Called on by local Arab notables and leaders, a mass protest was held in the city of Jerusalem earlier today to pressure the Council into the closure of the Jewish immigration office, which recently expanded its operations. What started as a peaceful protest quickly escalated after gendarmerie forces started cracking down on some of its leaders. In response the protestors started throwing stones at windows of foreign businesses and assault foreign nationals on the streets of the city.\n\nEventually the authorities were able to subdue the protest before further violence could spread but with resources spread thin, the action has scared the International Council that the situation might be far more explosive than initially thought."
 palnews.2.a: "This is an affront to our Muslim brethren!"

 palnews.3.t: "M.O.J. Halts Further Jewish Immigration"
 palnews.3.d: "In response to increasing calls by the Muslim population and the Jerusalem riot only a few weeks earlier, the International Council in Jerusalem has officially decreed an end to Jewish immigration and has decreed that no further settlers will be allowed entry into the zone until an accord has been reached with the local leaders.\n\nWhilst it is unlikely to fully stop immigrants from coming in due to the limited resources of the Council to enforce the decree, this marks an important turning point in the policy of the M.O.J. and an affront to both the Balfour and Talaat declarations."
 palnews.3.a: "Palestine will never be free so long as foreigners decide its policy."

 palnews.4.t: "General Strike in Palestine"
 palnews.4.d: "Organised by various Arab National Committees a general strike of all Arabs engaged in labour, transport and shopkeeping has been called to force the departure of international forces.\n\nListing their demands as 1) Prohibition of all Jewish immigration now and in the future 2) Prohibition of the transfer of territory from Arabs to Jews 3) Immediate withdrawal of the International Gendarmerie, a vast portion of the Arab population is primed to partake in the action encouraged by religious leaders and influential families. The Council has already reported that it will crack down heavily on any attempts to force its departure and gendarmerie forces have already been sent into Jaffa to arrest possible ringleaders of the strike."
 palnews.4.a: "May Allah bless their efforts."

 palnews.5.t: "The Congress of Haifa Opens Its Doors"
 palnews.5.d: "As violence continues to escalate across the region, the various signatories of the Jerusalem Accords have agreed to meet in Haifa to decide the future of the M.O.J. The Ottomans quickly demanded the immediate reunification with Kostantiniye, pointing out that the current chaos is fully to blame on those that took it away from the Porte in 1920. Egypt is openly calling for its attachment to Egypt, claiming that the Arabs should be united and that Ottoman actions during the Weltkrieg are what led to its creation in the first place.\n\nThe Committee sent out to investigate the sustainability of continued operations has also returned with a negative answer, proscribing its reunification to the Ottoman Empire but with an international panel ensuring the safety of the Jewish people."
 palnews.5.a: "Let us hope that a solution can be found."

 palnews.6.t: "The International Council Abolishes the M.O.J."
 palnews.6.d: "In response to issues in Palestine, the signatories of the Jerusalem Accords have voted in favour of its abolition and the reintegration into the Ottoman Empire. Proposals to return the Sinai to Egypt were vetoed by our representatives to great annoyance of both Cairo and the other powers which ultimately conceded to putting it under joint control by both nations, something those two have already denounced.\n\nWhether or not this solves the Palestine issue remains to be seen but what is for certain is that conflict between the Ottomans and Egypt is only starting."
 palnews.6.a: "A wise decision."
 palnews.6.b: "This is an outrage!"

 palnews.7.t: "Failed Coup d'État in Cairo"
 palnews.7.d: "Gunfire could be heard earlier today in Cairo as a group of conspirators stormed the palace. Calling themselves the Society of Justice, the group was planning to restore Abbas II to the throne. The last Ottoman Khedive, Abbas II has recently seen an increase in popularity across the Muslim world due to his Islamist ideas, giving rise to various groups wishing for his return.\n\nNonetheless the failed coup attempt has come to the advantage of the Cairo regime as the close relation between the Khedive and the Ottoman government has shifted public opinion squarely against the Turks. [EGY.GetLeader] himself has already called the attack on his life a vicious plan by the imperialist Turks to smother Arab independence and has reportedly started calling for military action against the Porte."
 palnews.7.a: "This will only further destabilise the Middle East."
 palnews.7.b: "Wait... we didn't do anything, did we?"
