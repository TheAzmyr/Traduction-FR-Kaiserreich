 PNG_totalist_party: "Committee of Thirteen"
 PNG_totalist_party_long: "Committee of Thirteen\n\n§gThe Committee of Thirteen is a relatively disjointed political body that has rallied behind the native trade unionist Sumsuma of Boang Island, King of the Tanga people, promoting his ideas of a \"national union\" between all races of Papua and New Guinea. It is generally made up of natives who have been educated at mission schools or who have simply worked their way up through the labour movement to gain political significance. As such, the Committee's rhetoric is generally tinged with Christian appeals to universal human brotherhood and a strong emphasis on equality and workers rights. Though few, if any of the members of the group have ever read socialist theory, they have maintained connections to the American International Longshore and Warehouse Union and understand some elements of vulgar Marxism. The Committee favours that Papua and New Guinea should be governed by federal means, where each ethnic group and clan has a degree of autonomy to pursue their own ways of life.§!\n"

 PNG_social_democrat_party: "Mixed Race Associations"
 PNG_social_democrat_party_long: "Mixed Race Associations\n\n§gThe Mixed Race Associations represent a network of social clubs and political groups whose ranks are primarily drawn from the mixed race Melanesian middle class. Though not exclusively mixed race, their members tend to be those inhabitants of Papua and New Guinea who have grown up with relative privilege and been able to gain modern, western education in Australia or Europe. They also represent many of the more affluent churches in Papua and New Guinea, promoting Christian charity and social equality, in a way that is nevertheless somewhat paternal. Its native members such as the Associations' current key figurehead, Paliau Maloat, generally gained their political influence through rising up the ranks of the Civil Service and serving as colonial Askari. The Associations promote the idea of a unified Papua and New Guinea, with a strong central government, favouring tools such as Christianity and the local Pidgin languages to promote social cohesion between the many different ethnic groups and clans.§!\n"

 PNG_authoritarian_democrat_party: "Fifth Cargo Belief"
 PNG_authoritarian_democrat_party_long: "Fifth Cargo Belief\n\n§gThe Fifth Cargo Belief is the common term used to describe a religious and political movement led by the Prophet Gurek and his most notable disciple, Yali, whose influence is so overpowering that it has sometimes been dubbed simply \"The Yali Movement\". At its core, the Fifth Cargo Belief is similar to what one would call a \"Cargo Cult\", it believes that through worship and ritual its adherents can accumulate material goods that will benefit them, and these material goods are then in and of themself worshipped as being gifts from a higher power. Where the Fifth Cargo Belief differs is its heavy reliance on \"teaching\", men such as Gurek and Yali have gained renown not just by bestowing physical material goods, but also by instructing the various tribes and clans they have visited in how to improve their farming and hygiene, as well as how to best defy the German colonial oppressors. The cults leaders frequently travel around, keeping an \"itinerant court\" of sorts, consisting of helpers and wives that the leaders recruit from the villages they visit. The Fifth Cargo Belief claims that the people of Papua and New Guinea must materially enrich themselves in order to grow powerful, after which they will be able to forge an independent nation that can stand on the world stage, free of imperialist control, but they specify very little of what this nation will look like.§!\n"

 PNG_sumsuma: "Sumsuma"
 PNG_sumsuma_leader_desc: "§YBorn:§! §L1903, in Sasa, Boang Island, German New Guinea§!\n§YBackground:§! §LAn ethnic Tanga, Sumsuma's Filamat clan was one of many coaxed down from the highlands to settle on the coast, where the Germans could more easily tax them. His childhood was troubled, with his father living on another island and his mother often beating him. At age 10 he ran away to enlist on a ship, later finding refuge at a Methodist mission in Neumecklenburg. There he learned German and read the Bible, before returning to the sea.\n\nThroughout the 1910s he worked on cargo boats in Rabaul, gaining the nickname Tolimlimbur (Wanderer) for his travels between the islands. Sumsuma was likely the highest paid native in all of New Guinea, a cunning negotiator adept at rising through the white man's world. But shamed by the rampant inequality he profited from and influenced by the American ILWU and sympathetic Afro-American sailors, in December 1928 Sumsuma summoned his comrades to strike for equal wages so that every man could be as rich as him.\n\nMost natives had no experience with organising, but Sumsuma took cues from prior successful strikes on the ship Ralum and the island of Samarai. He sent messages to every group of workers in Rabaul, from sailors to bookbinders to policemen, inviting them to meetings at the local Christian missions. He spoke to crowds of thousands and told them not to return to work, marking the beginning of the strike. Out of practically nothing, Sumsuma managed to build class consciousness and rallying the disparate New Guinean clans against the white bosses.\n\nFaced with violence by the police and Schutztruppe sent by the hostile \"Citizen's Committee\", Sumsuma and his comrades were imprisoned and tortured for several years. Released home to Boang, he was shaken but not hopeless. He set about trying to rebuild his movement, creating agricultural cooperatives among the Tanga and earning the respect of local \"luluais\" (Chieftains).\n\nIn the power vacuum that formed after New Guinea's liberation, the lulais elected Sumsuma as \"King of the Tanga\", a position he utilised to establish ties with various Christian groups and workers' associations. In time, these coalesced into the \"Committee of Thirteen\", consisting of Sumsuma's older allies as well as a younger generation keen on supporting his \"national union\" between all ethnic groups across the islands.§!"
