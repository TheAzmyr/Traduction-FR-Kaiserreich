 JAP_narrow_rail: "Narrow-gauge Railways"
 JAP_narrow_rail_desc: "Japan's railways were built using an unusually narrow gauge inherited from the British Empire during the Meiji Era.

Experts argue over whether conversion is worth the government's time."

 JAP_bad_land: "Rampant Landlordism"
 JAP_bad_land_desc: "Land use in Japan is highly inefficient. Much of the farmland is owned by landlords who rent it out to tenant farmers at exorbitant rates.

 JAP_Imperial_Family_powerless: "Imperial Family Abolished"

 JAP_devastated_national_economy_idea: "Devastated National Economy"
 JAP_devastated_national_economy_idea_desc: "Japan's unprecedented defeat and total capitulation to a foreign occupier has rendered the collapse of the entire Japanese economy. Despite the economic chaos that followed the fall of Mantetsu, there is no greater economic catastrophe in Japanese history than the complete occupation and suspension of all economic acitivites.

By following the Three Principles of the People, they too shall become comrades in the greater Pan-Asian struggle against imperialism. Emerging from the chaos and humiliation of defeat, Japan has now found itself on the trek towards a new destiny - one that renounces imperialism and seeks solidarity with her fellow socialist sisters and brothers."

 JAP_communist_republic_of_japan_idea_desc: "Against all odds, the communists in Japan have created a true people's republic - a people's government devoted to the workers and peasants of Japan.

With these shared goals, the Army will be able to produce modernization on a consistent line."

No matter what may happen, however, the military must be made ready for war."

 JAP_fading_sun_timer_enemy_desc: "The loss of the Korean peninsula and Port Arthur to foreign forces is a serious blow to Japan's ongoing war efforts. Unless they are able to regain a foothold on the mainland, the domestic unrest sparked by the numerous defeats we have inflicted on them will soon force the Empire of the Rising Sun to the negotiating table."

 JAP_offer_peace_to_china: "Offer Peace to China"
 JAP_offer_peace_to_china_desc: "The Chinese have bested our armies and now control Manchuria and Korea. While they are incapable of invading the Home Islands, the shame and humiliation of this defeat have sparked massive internal unrest. The best course of action is now negotiating a peace, no matter the shame, and turning to combat our new internal problems."

While they are incapable of invading the Home Islands, the shame and humiliation of this defeat have sparked massive internal unrest. The best course of action is now negotiating a peace, no matter the shame, and turning to combat our new internal problems."

 JAP_demand_hawaii_desc: "The Second American Civil War has shown that the American government is unable to properly care for the people living in Hawaii. As the new undisputed power in the Pacific, it is only fair that we demand the Hawaiian Islands be surrendered to us, as to ensure mutually beneficial protection under our guidance. Should they refuse, then war it shall be."

 JAP_attack_russia: "Attack [From.GetNameDefCap]"
 JAP_attack_russia_desc: "As we have achieved the dream of co-prosperity in an Asia free from European exploitation, [From.GetNameDef] remains as a thorn in our side, bitter still about their defeat in 1905. We cannot have them jeopardise our great project, and preemptive action must be taken to neutralise them for good."

 JAP_pan_asianism_desc: "For years, China has been ruthlessly exploited by European powers. In the name of Pan-Asianism and brotherhood we shall wear down the Chinese resolve by appealing against this fact - if only they will come over their differences, China and Japan may work together to form a new powerful bloc that can oppose Western imperialism."

 JAP_harmony_and_reconciliation_desc: "Though the warlords may resist us at every turn, the Chinese people shall see us for what we are.

Only we can liberate them from this impending collapse and secure a harmonious future between China and Japan."

 JAP_NSA_focus: "The National Security Act"
 JAP_NSA_focus_desc: "A debate in the Diet regarding the National Security Act has been raging for the past few weeks, and it is time for us to decide which course our nation will take. Some conservative members of the Diet fear that if the act isn't passed, radical elements in society will try to seize power. The future of Japan is in our hands."

### Focuses - Political - Democratic ###
 JAP_protect_constitutional_government: "Protect Constitutional Government"
 JAP_protect_constitutional_government_desc: "Japan is a beacon of modernity in Asia, and our people have long enjoyed a stability that is the envy and inspiration of many across the continent. Unfortunately, recent events have exposed cracks in our young institutions. We have work to do to restore the people's trust into our government... and to provide better security for the people's elected representatives, so that events like the May 15th Incident never happen again."
 JAP_civil_servant_purge: "Civil Servant Purge"
 JAP_civil_servant_purge_desc: "If we wish to root out any and all danger from socialist radicals, it is crucial we start by neutralising any political power they may have. And though some more moderate voices have been dismissing those fears as overblown, we cannot afford to take any risks: our administrative apparatus needs to be thoroughly cleaned of any ideologically undesirable element."
 JAP_promote_conciliation_unions: "Promote Conciliation Unions"
 JAP_promote_conciliation_unions_desc: "While a healthy democracy should allow workers to organise for better conditions, allowing unions to operate with little oversight will quickly result in factories turning into breeding grounds for radical ideology. To prevent union activity from escaping our grasp, we should promote conciliation with labour organisations that reject class struggle, and encourage employers to create and oversee their own company unions."
 JAP_investigate_corruption: "Investigate Corruption"
 JAP_investigate_corruption_desc: "After thorough examination, it seems many in our local administration have been conciliating towards other parties in exchange for gifts or favours. Worse yet, the previous Seiyūkai government has obviously been very cooperative towards powerful people some of its higher-ups turning were personally acquainted with, turning a blind eye to some shady dealings in exchange for their continued support. Such dishonesty cannot stand, and we must begin cracking down on it now."
 JAP_peace_preservation_laws: "Peace Preservation Laws"
 JAP_peace_preservation_laws_desc: "While liberal parties fought off General Tanaka's Peace Preservation Law more than a decade ago, recent events have shown that even in a democratic system, a strong hand is needed to protect its institutions from radical threats. As the final step in safeguarding Japanese parliamentarianism, the National Security Act will be amended to facilitate crackdown on anyone threatening Japan's National Essence, starting of course with known syndicalists and anarchists."

 JAP_rebuild_public_faith: "Rebuild Public Faith"
 JAP_rebuild_public_faith_desc: "With the country plagued by instability and economic hardships, it's no surprise people have been losing trust in the establishment. It is crucial we work to restore support in the democratic institution, not through intimidation or censorship, but through diplomacy. Interviews in the press, fulfilling electoral promises, and encouraging elected officials to reach out to their communities will ensure that over time, a healthy political climate is restored."
 JAP_rural_outreach: "Rural Outreach"
 JAP_rural_outreach_desc: "Alongside Japan's thriving industrial centres come unfortunate side effects. As it stands, the rurality has been left behind, some toiling away in conditions unfit for the twentieth century. While radical land reform would be a folly, better protection for tenants, as well as making modern farming equipment more accessible to those working the lands will help ease their burden."
 JAP_elite_mediation: "Elite Mediation"
 JAP_elite_mediation_desc: "In order to rebuild our government's power, we have to find allies somewhere. Luckily, the Seiyūkai has within its ranks many men with powerful connections to Japan's wealthy and powerful. Some may call it clientelism, but those people are patriots, hard at work for the Japanese nation, and will certainly be thankful, provided we give them some concessions."
 JAP_ties_to_the_zaibatsu: "Ties to the Zaibatsu"
 JAP_ties_to_the_zaibatsu_desc: "If Japanese industry has been thriving, it's in great part thanks to the Zaibatsu. Thanks to the connections many of them have with our party, we can foster a mutually beneficial relationship, offering us legitimacy, while in turn our continued patronage will prove beneficial for our economy's continued growth."

 JAP_reorganise_public_finance: "Reorganise Public Finance"
 JAP_reorganise_public_finance_desc: "The so-called "lost decade" period took a serious toll on our public finances. Austerity measures led to a loss of public funding for any investment, and public services. Starting now, we will look to prop up sluggish industries, build hospitals, and subsidise manufactures across the nation."
 JAP_support_from_unions: "Support from the Unions"
 JAP_support_from_unions_desc: "As Japan's industrial core grew, so did the disparities between the common worker and the factory owner. Bemoaned by reactionaries and conservatives, trade unions are only the logical way for downtrodden workers to leverage better conditions against their employers. Instead of antagonising them, let's try to leverage their support by hearing out what their demands."
 JAP_protection_for_tenants: "Protection for Tenants"
 JAP_protection_for_tenants_desc: "Many working the earth in Japan's countryside remain landless, and remain barely able to make ends meet. While a thorough land reform will take a long time to achieve, protecting the legal rights of those working the land, and ensuring they are properly assisted in any dispute against landlords will help us win the support of much of the peasantry."
 JAP_building_the_mass_party: "Building the Mass Party"
 JAP_building_the_mass_party_desc: "With their recent surge in popularity and proven diplomatic prowess, the Minseitō seek to expand into a true mass party. In opposition to the corrupt and elitist Seiyūkai, they represent the common people of Japan, not the corrupt elites who want to curtail their rights. Consequently, negotiating the support of other organisations, and pushing for greater activism within the party will help its continued growth."

 JAP_parliamentary_socialism: "Parliamentary Socialism"
 JAP_parliamentary_socialism_desc: "In what many are calling an incredible upset, the Shakai Taishūtō has emerged from the general election as the great winner. The Party seeks to represent the Japanese working class and peasantry, as the country needs the support of the toiling masses. Slandered by conservatives as outright syndicalists, their goals are only to build a Japan for the many, not for the few."
 JAP_utilise_the_peace_preservation_laws: "Utilise the Peace Preservation Laws"
 JAP_utilise_the_peace_preservation_laws_desc: "Although the previous years have seen the Peace Preservation Laws used against many in our party, we can now utilise them against our opponents. Corrupt Minseitō and Seiyūkai bureaucrats with ties to industrialists will be put under scrutiny, and no longer shall private property be upheld as sacred. From this point on, the Japanese worker will be protected by any means necessary."
 JAP_city_housing_projects: "City Housing Projects"
 JAP_city_housing_projects_desc: "Many living in Japan's large cities are unable to afford appropriate places to live in, resorting to sleeping in dilapidated homes or staying in shanty towns. At the same time, we are failing to meet demand for the growing number of people moving into cities from the countryside. To ensure as many people as possible lead decent lives, a large scale public housing programme has been devised by the government."
 JAP_promote_artistic_expression: "Promote Artistic Expression"
 JAP_promote_artistic_expression_desc: "Though more and more people are moving into large city centres, few still are able to create, or even appreciate art for themselves. Cinema, painting, music, theatre... Funding should be granted to encourage creative endeavours by aspiring artists, and advertise them to our people so they may experience them. The next decades will see Japanese artists become namesake throughout Asia, and perhaps even the entire world."
 JAP_entrench_bureaucracy: "Entrench a New Bureaucracy"
 JAP_entrench_bureaucracy_desc: "With their gains in the latest election, the Minseitō finally have enough leverage to make sweeping changes in the administration. Many offices held by conservatives will instead be staffed by clerks from our ranks, willing to work tirelessly for democracy in Japan to flourish. Hopefully, this will also deal a significant blow to our opponents in the Seiyūkai."
 JAP_primacy_of_the_diet: "Primacy of the Diet"
 JAP_primacy_of_the_diet_desc: "Japan can take pride in being a shining beacon of democracy in Asia, and to keep the torch of liberalism alive, we must make sure to keep the parliament as the centrepiece of governmental decision-making. The officials that Japanese men have put their trust in must be able to properly represent them, not shackled by conservative aristocrats or a bloated bureaucracy."

 JAP_divert_funding_to_military: "Divert Funding to the Military"
 JAP_divert_funding_to_military_desc: "Though the last decade was for the most part one of economic hardships, it's safe to say that our economy is now finally back on track. One of the first things the victorious Seiyūkai will do is allocate a greater part of the budget towards defence, to ensure our place as the greatest power in East-Asia is secure for years to come."
 JAP_loosen_economic_regulations: "Loosen Economic Regulations"
 JAP_loosen_economic_regulations_desc: "With the threat of socialist sabotage seemingly farther than ever, and an ever-growing number of new business partners all across Asia, it is time to reconsider some of the economic regulations put in place in the previous decade. As some of our biggest supporters, who happen to be important entrepreneurs, have pointed out, a laissez-faire approach is necessary for Japan's economy to keep growing, while not leaning into it would hinder innovation and profits."
 JAP_devotion_to_war_effort: "Devotion to the War Effort"
 JAP_devotion_to_war_effort_desc: "The coming decade will be one of war, as great European powers yet again find themselves in open conflict. For Japan to defend her rightful place in the world, everyone must be made to understand that in these trying times, they will have to work twice as hard to provide for their countrymen fighting far away from home, for they are brave heroes of Japan, and for them to succeed, no effort is too great."
 JAP_cult_imperial_institution: "Cult of the Imperial Institution"
 JAP_cult_imperial_institution_desc: "More than a mere figurehead, the Emperor represents millenias of tradition and shared identity to the people of Japan. As the representatives of His Majesty, our goal is also to ensure our people remember that the sacrifices they make are helping protect the very essence of our nation against those who seek to alter it, for generations to come. "
 JAP_towards_nationalist_mass_party: "Towards a Nationalist Mass Party"
 JAP_towards_nationalist_mass_party_desc: "Created by anti-mainstream politicians at odds with the establishment in their parties, the Kokumin Dōmei has emerged as a new, powerful nationalist force in parliament. If some are arguing that their victory is a step backwards for democracy, they insist that they are most fit to represent the people, unlike the sluggish parties which nearly had the nation fall to syndicalism. Japanese people will be mobilised, and made to support the state and the army in their endeavours."
 JAP_dirigiste_economics: "Dirigiste Economics"
 JAP_dirigiste_economics_desc: "As Japan finds herself a rising power on the world stage, it has become clear she cannot reliably trust others on the global market to act as honest, durable partners. Worse yet, many of our own countrymen have been prioritising filling their own pockets over the needs of the nation. To make sure we are never left to the whims of the market again, a great degree of state intervention in industry and banking is necessary, so the economy may run like a well-oiled machine."

### Focuses - Political - Centralism ###
 JAP_military_centralism: "Military Centralism"
 JAP_military_centralism_desc: "The era of mob rule is no more, no more shall backstabbing politicians get in the way of our nation for their own gain, now with our guidance Japan will rival the Great Powers that once look down on us."
 JAP_create_cabinet_planning_board: "Create the Cabinet Planning Board"
 JAP_create_cabinet_planning_board_desc: "Although we have gotten rid of the old system, there are skilled politicians who are still patriots that favour our cause. Creation of a cabinet planning board will help to secure our power and goals for the nation."
 JAP_budget_research_and_policy_section: "Budget and Policy Research Section"
 JAP_budget_research_and_policy_section_desc: "Individual ministries have long fought each other over the issue of funding - it is time to put an end to such petty squabbles. The creation of a new section to deal with the future budget and policy research will mend our issues while also allowing for us to maintain our long term goals for the nation."
 JAP_expand_propaganda_agency: "Expand the Propaganda Agency"
 JAP_expand_propaganda_agency_desc: "By giving additional funding to the Propaganda Agency, we may be able to make our message ring throughout not only Japan but Asia as well. This endeavour will be necessary in the coming years, so that all shall know of the Empire's word and seek to defend it."
 JAP_merge_small_ministries: "Merge Small Ministries"
 JAP_merge_small_ministries_desc: "Small and inefficient ministries often block the road to greater progress as a nation and create unnecessary red tape. To remedy this, a merger of several Ministries will be put forth, though some in the Diet may oppose our actions."
 JAP_promote_nationalist_education: "Promote Nationalist Education"
 JAP_promote_nationalist_education_desc: "No nation comes to greatness with an illiterate population, however even the best minds deterred from Japan's great destiny. To prevent this, foreign ideals must be put away in favour of the ideals of brotherhood to be taught to the youth so they can remain on the path that benefits them and their fellow countrymen."
 JAP_rationalise_industrial_development: "Rationalise Industrial Development"
 JAP_rationalise_industrial_development_desc: "Japan's status as a great power was forged by war and subsequent successes as other nations, and that is something we must not forget. As the world burns around us, we must rapidly convert our economy to one geared towards war, so that we will not be outdone by those who seek to destroy us."
 JAP_create_five_year_plan: "Create the Five-Year Plan"
 JAP_create_five_year_plan_desc: "In order to prepare our future plans, we must re-arrange our nation to put it on par with the imperialists of the west, to bring forth a new powerful industry and military on preparations to liberate Asia from the imperialists."
 JAP_reorganisation_of_aerial_industries: "Reorganisation of Aerial Industries"
 JAP_reorganisation_of_aerial_industries_desc: "Air power is the future of war, and it will be a necessary matter to win it. A rapid development of our aerial industries will see this future carried out."
 JAP_develop_manchurian_resources: "Develop Manchurian Resources"
 JAP_develop_manchurian_resources_desc: "Japan unfortunately has few natural resources of its own, but this may be rectified by investing into our allies who have an abundance. As long as they remain loyal, further investment into our ally in Manchuria is a safe bet - an investment that will serve the both of us."
 JAP_zabaitsu_contracts_focus: "Contracts with the Zaibatsu"
 JAP_zabaitsu_contracts_focus_desc: "The Zaibatsu have been somewhat of an annoyance with regards to our plans, wanting a greater amount of autonomy than is truly necessary. That being said, they can still be useful, and we may be able to form a mutually beneficial agreement with them as long as they selflessly serve the greater good of the nation."
 JAP_nationalise_the_railways: "Nationalise the Railways"
 JAP_nationalise_the_railways_desc: "Japan cannot progress when parts of its own railway system is under control of the private sector. Taking it out of the business class and bringing it fully under our control will help greatly in our future war efforts."
 JAP_national_defence_state: "The National Defence State"
 JAP_national_defence_state_desc: "While the Army has pushed forth a great deal of its proposals, the fact is that governments come and go, and our progress may be washed away in the future. To safeguard against the possibility, we shall create a political party that will officially unite the Japanese people and serve as a tool to keep the Diet in line."

### Focuses - Political - Shōwa Restoration ###
 JAP_showa_restoration: "The Shōwa Restoration"
 JAP_showa_restoration_desc: "With His Majesty officially sanctioning the coup, the restoration was a success! However, the groundwork has yet to be truly laid - taking power is one thing, but governance is another. The Restorationist factions are already bickering, and to ease the tension, Premier Konoe will ensure that the restorationist cause shall be a unifying one for all of Japan."
 JAP_destroy_degenerative_individualism: "Destroy Degenerative Individualism"
 JAP_destroy_degenerative_individualism_desc: "Individualism - a western import - undoubtedly brings selfishness and unwillingness to serve the nation. Manifestations of it and its sister slogans - 'democracy', 'freedom', 'equality', have corrupted the nation to its very core. It is time we stamp out these concepts and work to eliminate them entirely."
 JAP_eliminate_party_politics: "Eliminate Party Politics"
 JAP_eliminate_party_politics_desc: "We believe in the unity of thought and action, not the endless, divisive bickering that has brought ruin. The economy may grow and the state prospers, but it will mean nothing if the nation dies. Only the Restorationist cause can nurture life back to the nation."

 JAP_work_through_the_dojinkai: "Work Through the Dōjinkai"
 JAP_work_through_the_dojinkai_desc: "A political movement cannot live on words alone, and to ensure that ours doesn't end up as an ineffectual flash in the pan, we need to make it clear to the businessmen, bureaucrats and career politicians who keep the country running that there is a place at the table for them.\n\nThankfully, the Shōwa Dōjinkai has been doing exactly that."
 JAP_one_country_one_party: "One Country, One Party"
 JAP_one_country_one_party_desc: "There is nothing more petty than provincial party politics. It would be much more efficient if we had a system in which all former political parties and their members were absorbed into the Taisei Yokusankai, even in the most remote villages."
 JAP_rural_development: "Development of the Countryside"
 JAP_rural_development_desc: "Out of sight, out of mind no more: now that the regional tycoons are part of our administration, we can venture into the hitherto unknown countryside and bring Yokusan to the masses."
 JAP_work_with_the_elite: "Reaching Out to Big Business"
 JAP_work_with_the_elite_desc: "The populist rhetoric of many in our coalition, calling for the curbing of the influence of businessmen and landlords and the wholesale nationalisation of industries, has alienated some of the most powerful and brightest men in our country. We must make it clear that their help is still needed in our efforts to build a new Japan."
 JAP_development_of_a_new_way: "A New Way"
 JAP_development_of_a_new_way_desc: "One effect of getting the who's who of Japan's business world in the same room is that they eventually realise that it's more efficient to work together than to compete. Collective petitions to get rid of this or that regulation, or to get so-and-so many more workers into their factories, are much more effective than the under-the-table bribery they are used to."
 JAP_continue_zaibatsu_ties: "A Favour Between Friends"
 JAP_continue_zaibatsu_ties_desc: "The Zaibatsu are key to maintaining Japan's continued growth, and their compliance should be proof enough of their goodwill. It is in the country's best interest that we continue this partnership and show willingness to make concessions to them, so long as they continue to support our endeavours.\n\nAfter all, what's a favour or two between friends?"

 JAP_appease_the_kodoha: "Appease the Kōdōha"
 JAP_appease_the_kodoha_desc: "While it is not easy to reconcile the hardline views of the Kōdōha with the reality of running a country, we must not forget that is was them who have put our regime into power. Only a fool bites the hand that feeds him."
 JAP_shison_danran: "Shison Danran"
 JAP_shison_danran_desc: "Above all, there is a great foundation of the Japanese state: the relationship between the Emperor and his subjects, organised in a kingly way. This foundation has made Japan superior to any other nation for more than a thousand years, and it shall continue to do so."
 JAP_revere_imperial_power: "Revere Imperial Power"
 JAP_revere_imperial_power_desc: "The nation was always constrained by plotting bureaucrats and squabbling politicians who claimed to work in the Emperor's name, yet they only sought greed and to strengthen their own power to the detriment of His Majesty. Now that true patriots are in charge, it is time to restore power to who deserves it."
 JAP_enact_economic_controls: "Enact Economic Controls"
 JAP_enact_economic_controls_desc: "While industry has undeniably helped Japan become powerful, the domination of the private sector over our economy has had horrific side effects. The growth of an urbanite class, full of corrupt, American-inspired ideas aiming at curtailing the government's power, could outright jeopardise the future of Japan as a leading nation in the world. The Kōdōha pushes for curtailing capitalism's excesses, and instead focus our economy towards the war effort."
 JAP_colonial_investments: "Colonial Industry"
 JAP_colonial_investments_desc: "Our overseas holdings provide a good testing ground for large-scale and long-term industrialisation projects. What works for Chōsen and Manchuria today, will work for Tōhoku and Hokkaidō tomorrow. It is also quite convenient that key Kōdōha personnel are already in charge of overseeing the areas to which these industrialisation projects have been assigned."
 JAP_curtail_the_zaibatsu: "An End to Excess"
 JAP_curtail_the_zaibatsu_desc: "The Zaibatsu embody the worst aspects of Japanese society: corruption, nepotism, and their ties to democratic parties make it clear that we should cease all cooperation with them and work towards curtailing their influence. It will no doubt take time, but we will start a programme of nationalisation of the largest conglomerates, and start cracking down on known collaborators within our government."

 JAP_build_the_mass_party: "Implementing Shintaisei"
 JAP_build_the_mass_party_desc: "Throughout its existence, the Shōwa Kenkyūkai has produced many plans to fix Japan's politics, economy, global position and culture. Now that its benefactor is in power to implement these plans, Japan will be transformed according to its ideas."
 JAP_nation_service_draft_ordinance: "Nation Service Draft Ordinance"
 JAP_nation_service_draft_ordinance_desc: "We can ease the burden on our production lines by assigning workers directly to industrial projects that are in need of additional manpower."
 JAP_mobilise_the_nation: "Mobilise the Nation"
 JAP_mobilise_the_nation_desc: "The recent decades, thanks to parliamentarian bickering and allowing radical ideas to spread, have led Japanese society to a state of divide. Aimed at promoting kinship through patriotic associations, education and nationalising the media to foster love for the nation instead of divide, we shall make great efforts in restructuring society to strengthen the innate bond of our people, helping them remember what they are fighting and working hard for."
 JAP_independence_and_self_sufficiency: "Independence and Self-Sufficiency"
 JAP_independence_and_self_sufficiency_desc: "While Japan's economy is thriving, our country sadly lacks much in the way of natural resources, leaving us forced to buy them from foreign powers. Not only is the Japanese economy unfairly strained by those imports, if Japan ever finds herself cut off from western markets, it could jeopardise our war effort. As we can only rely on ourselves, we will pursue further resource extraction programmes and impose tariffs on Japanese resources, with the eventual goal of complete autarky."
 JAP_banking_and_agriculture_control: "Banking and Agricultural Control"
 JAP_banking_and_agriculture_control_desc: "Private control over banks, the agricultural sector, and more are all western plagues threatening Japan's economic and political sovereignty. To dismantle the pervasive influence of liberalism, we must introduce a government rice monopoly, and rigid control measures over banks and insurance companies, as their interests must be entirely subservient to the nation's, not the other way around."
 JAP_cabinet_information_committee: "Cabinet Information Committee"
 JAP_cabinet_information_committee_desc: "By taking direct control of the media, we can ensure the public is well-informed and on board with our government's plans."

 JAP_ennoble_the_national_spirit_desc: "The world of the past, and indeed of today, is one of competition - a great, total war is upon us, and all the nations shall seek to crown themselves victor. Only nations that have a strong fighting spirit, the will to prosper in the most difficult of time, have a right to exist. As a fit-to-survive nation ourselves, we will engage in war to the end, a fanatical Darwinian struggle to see Japan at the top of the mountain!"

 JAP_narrow_gauge_railways: "Standardise the Railways Gauges"
 JAP_narrow_gauge_railways_desc: "Our narrow-gauge railways had their advantages during construction, but now they hold back our burgeoning industry. The future waits for no-one, least of all Japan."
 JAP_prioritise_military_oil: "Prioritise Military Oil"
 JAP_prioritise_military_oil_desc: "With the country at war, oil is more vital than ever. While it is useful for many civilian purposes, it is vital for our armed forces. As such, we must prioritise oil for military uses first and foremost."
 JAP_land_reform_focus: "Land Reform"
 JAP_land_reform_focus_desc: "Land use is highly inefficient in Japan. Nearly all the factions agree that something must be done, though what exactly prompts much disagreement. Nevertheless, if we are to realise our full economic might, we must solve this issue."

 JAP_finance_factory_projects: "Finance Factory Projects"
 JAP_finance_factory_projects_desc: "Some Zaibatsu have requested for the state to aid them in building factories throughout the home islands. This would create many jobs and help resolve the economic crisis."
 JAP_raw_materials_excavation_endeavours: "Raw Materials Excavation Endeavours"
 JAP_raw_materials_excavation_endeavours_desc: "Various Zaibatsu have approached us with raw resource prospects requesting us to fund them. Our funding should give access to much needed rare resources."
 JAP_foster_technological_innovation: "Foster Technological Innovation"
 JAP_foster_technological_innovation_desc: "State funds would go a long way to ensuring that skilled Zaibatsu scientists have everything they need to push Japan forward into the future and should give the government greater control over research priorities."
 JAP_the_central_railroad_plan: "The Central Railroad Plan"
 JAP_the_central_railroad_plan_desc: "The Central Railroad Plan, a series of new and modernised train lines in the home islands, has been at the forefront of our continued push towards an efficient and productive society. However it has been delayed for years now, lacking both funding and expertise. Luckily however, the Zaibatsu are able to provide both and so, with their backing, the project can finally be completed."

### Focuses - Economic - Shared ###"
 JAP_build_new_aircraft_facilities: "Build New Aircraft Facilities"
 JAP_build_new_aircraft_facilities_desc: "The aircraft industry is a vital part of national defence. As wars are likely do be decided in the air, our industry must be able to supply our pilots with many quality, home-built aircrafts. Building new aircraft factories will ensure our growing demands are met in the coming years."
 JAP_invest_in_heavy_industry: "Invest in Heavy Industry"
 JAP_invest_in_heavy_industry_desc: "For Japan to remain a competitive economic power, it is necessary that we invest further into large scale industrial projects. Said industrial projects will in turn allow us to adequately supply the state when it comes to defence."

 JAP_rapid_industrialisation: "Rapid Arms Expansion"
 JAP_rapid_industrialisation_desc: "While our economy is growing, and we avoided much of the fallout of Black Monday, our arms productions still isn't what it has the potential to be. By building factories designed specifically for such purposes, we will be able to greatly expand our arms production."
 JAP_regulating_the_automotive_industry: "Regulating the Automotive Industry"
 JAP_regulating_the_automotive_industry_desc: "Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, Japanese domestic automotive production was too small to compete globally. To remedy this and enable domestic firms to compete with much bigger Western counterparts, we can force a merger of our many small automotive firms into a few big businesses."
 JAP_reorganise_resource_extraction: "Reorganise Resource Extraction"
 JAP_reorganise_resource_extraction_desc: "With tensions rising all over the world, it is vital for our resource extraction to happen effectively and quickly. To achieve this, firms involved in resource extraction will be subjected to greater bureaucratic supervision and forced to undergo a structural reorganisation under the government's guidance."
 JAP_the_shinkansen_proposal: "The Shinkansen Proposal"
 JAP_the_shinkansen_proposal_desc: "It is time to enact the Shinkansen proposal: create a connect set of high speed railways then combine them with new steam and electric locomotives. These lines would be able to carry passengers and freight at speeds never seen before."

### Focuses - Military ###
 JAP_revise_imperial_defence_policy: "Revise Imperial Defence Policy"
 JAP_revise_imperial_defence_policy_desc: "Jakuniku Kyōshoku or 'Survival of the Fittest' is a fundamental understanding in our military philosophy; the Western imperialists have greatly expanded their air forces and navies and if we do not do the same we will surely fall victim to their forces. Factionalism in the army has remained and so our armed forces have been unable to reach their full potential, so deciding on our doctrine is of utmost importance."
 JAP_long_war_doctrine: "Long War Doctrine"
 JAP_long_war_doctrine_desc: "Proponents of Long War doctrine argue that if Japan is to survive the struggle among nations, Japan must prepare for a total war perhaps even greater in scale than the last. To this end, we must establish a strong industrial base, equip our soldiers with the latest armaments, and ready the populace for the storm to come."
 JAP_short_war_doctrine: "Short War Doctrine"
 JAP_short_war_doctrine_desc: "Pointing to Japan's weak industrial base, lack of resources, and position in Asia, advocates of a Short War strategy believe that Japan should instead prepare to fight a short, decisive conflict, in the style of the Russo-Japanese and Sino-Japanese wars before us, and to this end, create a large standing army capable of inflicting devastating defeats early in the war."
 JAP_phase_out_arisakas: "Phase out the Arisakas"
 JAP_phase_out_arisakas_desc: "Our bread and butter rifle, the Arisaka, has been a reliably used rifle in the past several decades but has fallen behind the latest advancements in warfare in part due to its bolt-action design. Therefore, we must upgrade our weaponry to the more powerful, and more efficient semi-automatic rifles. Doing so will ensure that our infantry stands the test of time and can triumph over even the most advanced militaries of the west."
 JAP_agile_and_indomitable: "Agile and Indomitable"
 JAP_agile_and_indomitable_desc: "Our infantry is nothing without the diversity of shells fired by their trusty howitzers. Therefore, we must not slow down their advance with a massive cannon that is difficult to transport, and a hindrance to operate. By designing a light, robust cannon while also maintaining the ability to load a powerful and destructive shell, our infantry will be absolved of any further issues in breaking enemy lines."
 JAP_supremacy_of_logistics: "Supremacy of Logistics"
 JAP_supremacy_of_logistics_desc: "Advancements in logistic equipment and training is a necessity to maintain a large armed force across multiple fronts in East Asia. We would be needlessly throwing away brave Japanese souls if our companies are not equipped with the most up to date support equipment. Our marines will need the latest advancements in medical technology, logistics training, as well as reconnaissance support to ensure that each invasion results in a triumph for Japan!"
 JAP_backbone_of_the_army: "Backbone of the Army"
 JAP_backbone_of_the_army_desc: "Infantry are the foundation of any modern army, if our infantry were to falter in the face of our adversaries, then there would be no hope for our planned conquest over Asia. Instead we must bolster our forces, equip each man with not only the best equipment we have to offer, but also instill in them the courage to destroy Japan's enemies. Who are we to call ourselves the hegemon of East Asia without an elite ground force to back up our claims?"
 JAP_armoured_experiments: "Armoured Experiments"
 JAP_armoured_experiments_desc: "Inspired by the utilisation of crude armored vehicles during the end of the first Weltkrieg by several european powers, there have been motivations to produce a native tank design. The Army Technical Bureau has designed a small, cheap, and easy to build tank capable of travelling at high speeds as well as being able to mitigate small firearms. These armored divisions will prove to be a boon in the upcoming war with China!"
 JAP_retention_of_mobility: "Retention of Mobility"
 JAP_retention_of_mobility_desc: "While in comparison to Asia our forces do not come up lacking when it comes to sheer firepower and technological superiority, it is not those factors alone that will win us wars. Having a mobile army is just as important, and in the vast Chinese plains it is what will win us decisive battles."
 JAP_coordinate_intelligence_services: "Coordinate Intelligence Services"
 JAP_coordinate_intelligence_services_desc: "Our intelligence services are currently much too disorganised, not only divided between civilian, army, and naval agencies, but too often ignored by operational command. We must strengthen inter-service cooperation so that the valuable work of our intelligence operatives can make a difference on the field of battle."
 JAP_f_agency: "F-Agency"
 JAP_f_agency_desc: "It is highly likely that our troops will soon be deployed for combat in tropical zones. This difficult and harsh terrain presents challenges to conducting military operations, but it may also provide an opportunity if we are able to master this style of warfare before our enemies do."
 JAP_expand_the_kenpeitai: "Expand the Kenpeitai"
 JAP_expand_the_kenpeitai_desc: "As our empire expands, so too do the dissidents who unlawfully go against our moral path. The Kenpeitai has served us in suppressing dissent at home as well as providing espionage and counterintelligence for some time now, and it is only right we continue recruitment for it."
 JAP_strengthen_the_ijaas: "Strengthen the IJAAS"
 JAP_strengthen_the_ijaas_desc: "Planes have long stopped being just reconnaissance and harassment tools. By integrating them fully into our army operations, the air force is capable of dealing damage and advancing our operations as much as the average Army Command."
 JAP_intensive_pilot_training: "Intensive Pilot Training"
 JAP_intensive_pilot_training_desc: "Japanese fighter pilot training is one of the most difficult in the world, but it is that way for a very good reason. Our planes are fast, our ground crews skilled, and our commanders smart, but nothing is more important than the courage and talent of the individual pilots."
 JAP_open_new_flight_schools: "Open New Flight Schools"
 JAP_open_new_flight_schools_desc: "Our aerial campaigns require not just a greater quality, but also quantity of pilots. New schools shall be opened to teach the recruits of the IJAAS, not only to increase the number of our air wings, but also to provide practical experience in our understanding of aerial operations."
 JAP_found_teishindan: "Found the Teishindan"
 JAP_found_teishindan_desc: "Experiments have proven the practicality and usefulness of using airborne forces to land troops behind enemy lines. Other nations have begun to form paratroop units, so why not our own? The Teishin Shudan shall be a new special forces unit, capable of practicing vertical envelopment and capturing key objectives."

 JAP_ideological_indoctrination: "Ideological Indoctrination"
 JAP_ideological_indoctrination_desc: "What separates the Japanese soldier from that of other countries? It is his fighting spirit, his total devotion to his country and divine Emperor, his refusal to surrender so unlike his cowardly foes. This is why Japan shall always triumph over its adversaries, for he who has no fear of death shall always be victorious!"
 JAP_new_field_manuals: "New Field Manuals"
 JAP_new_field_manuals_desc: "Our current field manuals simply don't match up to the rapidly evolving standards of modern war, so updating them to maintain our operational efficiency is a necessity."
 JAP_logistics_corps: "Logistics Corps"
 JAP_logistics_corps_desc: "A branch in the army designated on logistical matters - ensuring we have the necessary supplies, maintenance, information, and more - will help us to overcome difficult conditions, especially in some of the more unfavourable terrain across Asia."
 JAP_envolepment_tactics: "Envelopment Tactics"
 JAP_envolepment_tactics_desc: "If there is a lesson to be taken from the Great War, it is that frontal assaults alone are rarely decisive. Far better it is to break through the enemy's flanks and attack the rear, causing great disorganisation at less cost to our own forces."
 JAP_expand_the_engineer_corps: "Expand the Army Engineering Corps"
 JAP_expand_the_engineer_corps_desc: "Given the varied terrain we will be fighting in, combined with the often lacking infrastructure in Asia, the creation of a specialised engineer corps would be a great boon to our armed forces. We will put funds towards just such a unit."
 JAP_update_the_imperial_war_college: "Update the Imperial War College"
 JAP_update_the_imperial_war_college_desc: "The Army War College trains the very best of our country's officer corps. Originally inspired by the Prussian Staff College, its instructional techniques have hardly changed in fifty years. It is time this revered institution has been brought up to modern standards."

### Focuses - Navy ###

 JAP_expand_the_snlf: "Expand the SNLF"
 JAP_expand_the_snlf_desc: "The Special Naval Landing Forces, the Marine forces of the Imperial Japanese Navy, will be crucial in the coming conflicts - through their efforts we can make landings on the Chinese coast and the East Indies alike."
 JAP_pacific_defence_zone: "Pacific Defence Zone"
 JAP_pacific_defence_zone_desc: "Japan's ability to project power across the Pacific has never been as powerful as we'd like it to be, but with recent conflicts we can ensure that control of the Pacific is in our hands. We can also defend from any incursions that threaten the Home Islands by heavily fortifying the naval bases in the ocean."
 JAP_reexamine_naval_doctrine: "Reexamine Naval Doctrine"
 JAP_reexamine_naval_doctrine_desc: "Seen already two decades ago, it is foolish to think that the next war will be won by decisive battle. Rather the next war will be won by resources, industry and attrition. We must change our thinking or it will kill us."
 JAP_maintain_kantai_kessen: "Maintain Kantai Kessen"
 JAP_maintain_kantai_kessen_desc: "Our dockyards and our industry have limited capacity compared to our rivals in Europe and North America, but our designers and engineers are superior in every way to them. One ship of ours will be worth a dozen of their ships."
 JAP_experimental_division: "Experimental Division"
 JAP_experimental_division_desc: "Though the Japanese fleet is mighty, it may not be up to par against the American or German fleet in terms, and should we hope to gain the upper hand in the Pacific, we have to continue investing in research and development, for it is ingenuity and thinking outside the box that will win us naval battles, not sheer firepower."
 JAP_improve_the_long_lance: "Improve the Long Lance"
 JAP_improve_the_long_lance_desc: "Torpedoes, while small, are extremely deadly weapons able to sink even the mightiest battleship, as the pathetic Russian navy learnt during the Battle of Tsushima. However, ships are much larger than 30 years ago, and so we should work to enlarge our torpedoes."
 JAP_refit_old_ships: "Refit Old Ships"
 JAP_refit_old_ships_desc: "Even if Japan's fleet is among the largest in the world in size, many of our ships are not up to date, and they would struggle to perform in a future conflict. As we find ourselves lacking the resources to build a new fleet from scratch, we should instead aim to build upon our older ships and give them proper equipment, so that they may be almost as good as new."
 JAP_revise_kantai_kessen: "Revise Kantai Kessen"
 JAP_revise_kantai_kessen_desc: "Our current fleet is not designed up to our new doctrinal changes. It just doesn't have sufficient numbers of smaller vessels required for the new tasks. There is only one option to solve this situation; a massive build-up of unified, simplified and especially modular designs."
 JAP_expand_shipping_capacity: "Expand Shipping Capacity"
 JAP_expand_shipping_capacity_desc: "Warships may be more impressive, but merchant shipping is just as, if not more, important in sustaining the war effort. This is especially true for us, as being an island nation, we must necessarily import resources and supply our expeditionary forces by sea."
 JAP_start_the_fourth_circle_plan: "[GetMaruKeikaku]"
 JAP_start_the_fourth_circle_plan_desc: "The 4th Naval Armaments Supplement Programme, or Fourth Maru Keikaku, is the Naval Ministry's latest outline for the expansion of the IJN. With a six-year timeframe and a budget of hundreds of thousands of yen, we are expecting to produce dozens of vessels of all types."
 JAP_expand_personnel_reserves: "Expand Personnel Reserves"
 JAP_expand_personnel_reserves_desc: "Though it is often overlooked, the navy has manpower requirements in the same way that the army does. Building up the size of our naval reserves will enable us to quickly replace losses."
 JAP_scrap_and_build_program: "Scrap And Build Programme"
 JAP_scrap_and_build_program_desc: "Though our navy is vast, strength is measured in more than just tonnage. Many of our vessels are frankly out-of-date and cannot compete with modern warships. We should move to scrap these old ships and use the salvage to construct replacements fitted with the latest in naval technology."
 JAP_naval_wargames: "Naval Wargames"
 JAP_naval_wargames_desc: "Research has shown the usefulness of holding military simulations, not just in generally training our officers, but for actually predicting the outcomes and efficacy of potential military operations. Conducting such simulations will be indispensable as we develop our war plans."
 JAP_destroyer_development: "Destroyer Development"
 JAP_destroyer_development_desc: "Far from their origin as torpedo boat destroyers, modern destroyers have become the quintessential screening vessel and an indispensable tool in antisubmarine warfare. Destroyer designs are only going to become bigger and faster, so we must keep pace."
 JAP_floating_fortresses: "Floating Fortresses"
 JAP_floating_fortresses_desc: "Everyone knows that naval aviation has become a decisive factor in modern naval warfare. Aircraft carriers are especially important for us, with their ability to project power across our growing Pacific empire. Therefore, we must increase the number of carrier groups we can field."
 JAP_diversify_submarine_models: "Diversify Submarine Models"
 JAP_diversify_submarine_models_desc: "Whether for fleet-to-fleet combat, commerce raiding, or even supply, submarines are an indispensable component of the fleet. With so many potential roles to play, we must diversify and produce a broad slate of different kinds of submarines."
 JAP_leviathans_of_the_pacific: "Leviathans of the Pacific"
 JAP_leviathans_of_the_pacific_desc: "Despite the coming of aircraft carriers, battleships remain the pride of the IJN: they are the biggest, toughest, and strongest warships afloat, embodying the might of the Japanese Empire. With even more technologically advanced battleships, we will be able to inflict decisive defeat upon any foe who dares challenge us."
 JAP_cruiser_innovation_efforts: "Cruiser Innovation Efforts"
 JAP_cruiser_innovation_efforts_desc: "For our great battleships to effectively fight against opposing fleets, they must be properly escorted. Investing in the development of medium and light cruisers is primordial for our navy to retain its supremacy over the pacific."
 JAP_naval_aviation_department: "Naval Aviation Department"
 JAP_naval_aviation_department_desc: "Without planes our carriers are just metal boxes which can float. We must ensure that our carriers will always be equipped with only the best planes and pilots."
 JAP_the_zero: "The Zero"
 JAP_the_zero_desc: "Thanks to the efforts of the Mitsubishi Aircraft Company, we have been able to design a new fighter that will serve our efforts both on the sea and the land. The Zero, as it is called, will be a cutting-edge carrier based fighter."

 JAP_plan_edit_name_1: "Army Improvement"
 JAP_plan_edit_name_1_desc: "While the traditionalists in the army have pushed for an expansion in the size of our standing army, the reformists have pushed for the change to triangular divisions so that we may have better operational effectiveness on the battlefield. Only time will tell which plan will work out."
 JAP_plan_edit_name_2: "Planning for War"
 JAP_plan_edit_name_2_desc: "The traditionalists in the army have called for extensive planning to understand the geography and gather intel on our opposing armies, while the reformists have called for grand investment into science to wield technological superiority over the enemy."
 JAP_plan_edit_name_3: "Mobilisation Campaign"
 JAP_plan_edit_name_3_desc: "The reformists in the army have pointed to a grand national mobilisation as the way Japan will come out on top in its conflicts, whereas the traditionalists have pointed to emphasising the moral superiority and the sacred duty the Imperial army must commit itself to so that it may endure the next war."

 JAP_expand_the_army: "Expand the Standing Army"
 JAP_expand_the_army_desc: "Size isn't everything, but numerical superiority inherently has multiple advantages - we can count on less catastrophic losses, maintain a broad range of specialised units, and deploy troops wide and far across Asia."
 JAP_war_plan_expansions: "Extensive War Planning"
 JAP_war_plan_expansions_desc: "Knowing the terrain of our enemy, gathering intel on them and understanding where to strike is of utmost importance if we're to land a knockout blow. Whether it be the plains of China or the jungles of Burma, understanding the importance of natural barriers will be the key to winning our wars."
 JAP_extensive_planning: "Spiritual Mobilisation"
 JAP_extensive_planning_desc: "Wars are not won simply with the clash of bullets from the ground, sea or sky - but the ability to not give up. Whoever shall win a war, it will be because they had the strength to keep going, and soldiers of the Empire shall know what they are fighting for when they land the first decisive strike."

 JAP_the_four_year_plan: "Establish Triangle Divisions"
 JAP_the_four_year_plan_desc: "Triangular divisions are smaller than square divisions, and thus do not have the same command and control issues that square divisions have. While they may consist of less manpower per division, they are more mobile and able to carry greater firepower. It is time we make the shift over."
 JAP_scientific_war_planning: "Scientific War Planning"
 JAP_scientific_war_planning_desc: "What Japan lacks in resources and sheer economic output, we can make up for by emphasising the importance of technology. It is only by being technologically superior than our foes in Asia that we shall overcome our natural deficiencies."
 JAP_national_mobilisation: "National Mobilisation"
 JAP_national_mobilisation_desc: "Wars are not won simply with the clash of bullets from the ground, sea or sky - but the one who was able to properly commit their entire people to the war effort. One hundred million are singing their praises of Japan's holy effort to liberate Asia from Western imperialism, all united and committed to see our final victory in the end."

 JAP_nanshin_ron: "Nanshin-ron"
 JAP_nanshin_ron_desc: "For all its strengths, Japan has a key strategic disadvantage in its dependency on foreign oil. In the pursuit of self-reliance and security against ever-encroaching Western imperialism, surely it would be both wise and just to acquire these resources for ourselves, and in so-doing widen our sphere of security?"
 JAP_extend_pacific_security_zone: "Extend The Pacific Security Zone"
 JAP_extend_pacific_security_zone_desc: "With America in chaos, we can ill afford to ignore the opportunity presented.

 JAP_philippines: "Bring the Philippines into the Fold!"

 JAP_claim_colonies: "Create the South Seas Territory"
 JAP_claim_colonies_desc: "Every single island in the Pacific not held by us could act as a staging point to invade our Home Islands. The German Empire has no right to any of these islands and so they are ours for the rightful taking. First will formalise our claims to the area with the South Seas Territory. We can then use those claims to bring them into our empire, be that with diplomacy or the might of the Japanese Imperial Navy."
 JAP_ultimatum: "Issue Colonial Ultimatum"
 JAP_ultimatum_desc: "We must use this opportunity to claim our rightful role as the sole great power in Asia and in the Pacific: we must demand all [GER.GetAdjective] South-East Asian and Pacific possessions, as well as their Chinese concessions. If they don't meet our demands, then it shall be war!"
 JAP_target_indochina: "Target: Indochina"

If the Chinese don't agree, then we shall simply have to teach them a harsh lesson about defiance."
 JAP_mantetsu_projects: "Mantetsu Projects"
 JAP_mantetsu_projects_desc: "Mantetsu manages the railways of Manchuria and Korea on our behalf, and is deeply involved with the economy of North-West China as a result.

 JAP_support_allies: "Support Warlord Allies"

 JAP_five_races_under_the_sun_desc: "While many warlords fly the five-coloured flag, the truth is that the Han Chinese have suppressed the other four races of China for centuries.

The warlords continue to resist our efforts to make China whole again, ironically something they claim to champion. Promoting peace, reconciliation and reconstruction - ideals truly worth striving for - will be our key to ending this conflict once and for all."

 JAP_victory_with_vision: "Victory with a Vision"
 JAP_victory_with_vision_desc: "An endless war of attrition will benefit no one. Those who say we came into conflict with the warlords due to some noble desire to reunite the Chinese people and pan-Asian prosperity have it wrong: this is a great war to dominate all of East Asia, and we intend to ensure that our hard-won gains will ensure prosperity back home."
 JAP_continental_warfare: "Continental Warfare"

 JAP_country_intro_header: "Recovering from the Lost Decade"
 JAP_country_intro_content: "In what has come to be called the 'Lost Decade', the 1920s were marked by economic depression and political instability in Japan. The plight was particularly severe in the agricultural sector and caused a massive demographic change, as farmers fled from the depressed countryside to urban areas, flooding the labour market, and further driving down wages.\n\nAfter leaving the Kenseikai-led 'Constitutionalist Coalition' and taking charge of the Government, Inukai and his cabinet successfully expanded the Japanese sphere of influence into Manchuria and the edges of Siberia, acquiring a vital export market for the Japanese economy, but the agricultural situation continued to deteriorate as cheap agricultural imports from Manchuria bled into the countryside. As 1936 dawns, continued rearmament and state investment have fully rebuilt the industrial economy, but the issue of rural poverty remains chronic and unsolved."

### Events ###
 japdom.2.t: "Dissolution of the Diet"
 japdom.2.d: "The four-year term of the incumbent Imperial Diet elected in 1932 is ending. Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi has called for a general election to happen as soon as possible."
 japdom.2.a: "Very well."

 japdom.3.t: "General Election of 1936"
 japdom.3.d: "After the Constitutional Restoration of 1926 and the ensuing political realignment, two parties came to dominate Japanese politics: the conservative Rikken Seiyūkai (Association of Friends of Constitutional Government) and the liberal Rikken Minseitō (Constitutional Democratic Party).\n\nThe Seiyūkai won an absolute majority in the 1932 general election, but support in the countryside (its traditional voting base) has been declining. As the political atmosphere turns against the ruling party, the Minseitō, formerly known as the Kenseikai (Constitutional Government Association), has consolidated its urban voting base and is beginning to expand into the countryside, hoping to break the Seiyūkai's absolute majority in the Diet. A new, third player in the 1936 general election is the Shakai Taishūtō (Socialist Masses Party), founded in 1933 by social democrats and trade unionists.\n\nIt is now time to see if the Seiyūkai have retained enough seats to retain an absolute majority..."
 japdom.3.a: "The Seiyūkai have defended their absolute majority!"
 japdom.3.b: "The Seiyūkai have lost their absolute majority!"

 japdom.4.t: "The Assassination of Katayama Sen"
 japdom.4.d: "Born in 1859, Katayama Sen was one of the most senior syndicalist leaders in Japan, known as the 'father of Japanese syndicalism'. Exiled to the US after participating in the early social democratic movement, Katayama witnessed and was influenced by Jack Reed's syndicalist activities and the development of the IWW into the CSA. Katayama returned to Japan after the Constitutional Restoration of 1926 and founded the first legal syndicalist party in Japan, the Rōdō-Nōmintō (Labour-Farmer Party), and after it was declared illegal in 1932, he helped found the current Shakai Taishūtō.\n\nYesterday, while visiting Kyōto to congratulate Shakai Taishūtō member Yamamoto Senji on his election, a gang of three right-wingers stormed his office and beat the two men with clubs. Yamamoto survived, but Katayama, aged 76, never regained consciousness and died earlier today."
 japdom.4.a: "This will be bad..."

 japdom.5.t: "Friction Within the Japanese Left"
 japdom.5.d: "The shock of the assassination of Katayama Sen initially united the Shakai Taishūtō in solidarity against the "white terror", but this unity did not last long. The party was originally structured as a coalition of various social-democratic and syndicalist organisations, united only by their goal of 'socialisation of the economic structure with the proletariat at its foundation'. Before his death, Katayama had steered the party away from ideological clashes, but deprived of his voice, the party was forced to confront the question of its precise ideological position, and infighting soon began.\n\nThroughout the spring of 1936, the national-syndicalist Nichirōkei (Japan Labour Clique) embraced Totalism and vigorously expanded its membership, not only from within the party - at the expense of the moderate Shaminkei (Social Democratic Clique) - but also from without, notably from the Shaminkei-controlled Nihon Rōdō Sōdōmei (Japan General Federation of Labour). An open struggle between the two groups soon broke out. The Nichirōkei accused the Sōdōmei of being run by 'the labour bureaucrat establishment', and the Sōdōmei and the Shaminkei in turn accused the Nichirōkei of hijacking labour organisations and turning them into their puppets. Nichirōkei members were expelled from both the Sōdōmei and the Taishūtō earlier this month, and the group is now operating independently."
 japdom.5.a: "An interesting development."

 japdom.6.t: "The May 15th Incident"
 japdom.6.d: "The Prime Minister has been assassinated! A group of eleven radical junior navy officers connected to the Nichirōkei broke into the official residence of Prime Minister Inukai and shot him dead. They claim to have done so to avenge the death of Katayama Sen and the murder of some workers in Niigata. The incident has greatly shocked the nation, and the Admiralty Board, mortified by the incident, has already begun a court-martial and a thorough investigation of radical activities within the Navy."
 japdom.6.a: "Appoint Suzuki Kisaburō to replace Inukai."

 japdom.7.t: "Restorationists and Centralists"
 japdom.7.d: "The current political instability and the ineptitude of the political establishment have rekindled the flames of the Restorationist cause. While Lt. Col. Hashimoto's ever-secretive 'Sakurakai' has been the historical hotbed of anti-establishment thought in the military, the recent years have seen a surge in membership of General Araki's 'Kōdōha'.\n\nThe Kōdōha, or Imperial Way Faction, has gained much momentum through the organisational efforts of its radical junior officers, who openly share their beliefs in anti-capitalism, anti-oligarchism and anti-parliamentarism. Usually from underprivileged and/or humble backgrounds, many of these officers have experienced poverty from childhood and have observed what they see as the evil influence of favouritism, which fits with their view that the establishment has seized power from the Emperor and is leading the nation into the abyss. The Restorationist solution is simple: to sweep out the ruling establishment and restore all power to the Emperor, and from there initiate a complete national reform.\n\nThey are opposed by a loose coalition of more moderate army officers, whom they derisively call the 'Tōseiha', or Control Faction. But even these so-called moderates are reaching a breaking point. The greatest opposition to the Kōdōha comes from a group of officers who are close to the central military leadership who, while supporting cooperation with the establishment, have come to believe in the need for a re-militarisation of politics."
 japdom.7.a: "This will be trouble..."

 japdom.8.t: "The Security Debate"
 japdom.8.d: "The atmosphere in the Imperial Diet has become increasingly tense in recent months, and has now reached a frightening level. Many members fear for their lives, so progress isn't just a matter of political power or personal pride, but of survival. There is a growing consensus that the current security laws aren't enough to protect democracy and that more is needed. The May 15th Incident must not be allowed to happen again."
 japdom.8.a: "A comprehensive law, an act, must be made!"

 japdom.9.t: "The National Security Act"
 japdom.9.d: "The infamous Peace Preservation Act was introduced in early 1924 by the Tanaka regime in the midst of the Red Scare following the Kantō anarchist uprising in September 1923 and a syndicalist assassination attempt on the then Crown Prince Hirohito in December of that year. The Act drastically curtailed civil rights and symbolised the draconian rule of General Tanaka. It was repealed when the regime was brought down by the Constitutional Restoration of 1926, but Prime Minister Suzuki Kisaburō now wants to reintroduce it, or rather, a slightly reworked version of it, under the name 'National Security Act'. He has faced strong opposition, even from within his own cabinet, and public opinion has sunk to a new low, but Suzuki believes its reintroduction is a necessary step to counter the rising tide of radicalism, and he is not alone in this view. A cross-party parliamentary group led by Nakajima Chikuhei of the Seiyūkai and Adachi Kenzō of the Minseitō, has declared the Act to be the 'last bulwark of constitutional government' and supports its passage. The House of Peers and the Privy Council are also in favour of the Act."
 japdom.9.a: "We must defend our Democracy by any means necessary; the Act will be enforced."
 japdom.9.b: "We cannot in good conscience go against public opinion."

 japdom.10.t: "The Trial of the May 15th Incident"
 japdom.10.d: "The court-martial of the eleven murderers of Prime Minister Inukai began last month. Before the end of their trial, the court received a petition with over 350,000 signatures in blood from sympathisers all over the country pleading for a lenient sentence. In addition to the petition, the court also received a request from eleven youths in Niigata who asked that they be executed in place of the Navy officers, and sent eleven severed fingers to the court as a gesture of their sincerity! The whole trial was unpopular enough to persuade the court to speed up the process, and although the death sentences were only handed down yesterday, the assassins were executed at dawn today."
 japdom.10.a: "This country is going crazy..."

 japdom.11.t: "The Assassination of Suzuki Kisaburō"
 japdom.11.d: "The unthinkable has happened again! Prime Minister Suzuki and his brother-in-law Hatoyama Ichirō were attending a party rally in Kawagoe today. As Hatoyama stood up to deliver his speech, a syndicalist terrorist from the 'Saitama Youth Volunteer Corps for National Salvation' shot Suzuki and Hatoyama in retaliation for the execution of Prime Minister Inukai's assassins. Suzuki's wound proved fatal."
 japdom.11.a: "Gomeifuku wo inorimasu."

 japdom.12.t: "Government under Fire"
 japdom.12.d: "Unsurprisingly, the failure to pass the National Security Act has led to a backlash against the Prime Minister. The conservatives and bureaucrats who supported the bill feel betrayed by Suzuki's backing down. The House of Peers and the Privy Council, disappointed by the Government's inability to take deal with the recent wave of radicalism, have lost all their patience with the cabinet."
 japdom.12.a: "Suzuki's days are numbered..."

 japdom.13.t: "Resignation of Suzuki Kisaburō"
 japdom.13.d: "Abandoned by everyone, the humiliated Prime Minister Suzuki resigned when the Peers passed a censure motion denouncing the cabinet and, with lukewarm support, former Home Minister Mizuno Rentarō was appointed in his place. Ominously, the Privy Council and its ultra-conservative chairman Baron Hiranuma issued a statement declaring that the 'parliamentary impotency' needs to be replaced by a more stable system."
 japdom.13.a: "Call emergency convention!"

 japdom.14.t: "The Election of Mizuno Rentarō"
 japdom.14.dead: "The death of Suzuki stunned the Rikken Seiyūkai and an emergency convention was called. The bureaucratic Tokonami faction (named after Tokonami Takejirō (1867-1935), chairman of the pro-Tanaka Seiyū Hontō during the Tanaka dictatorship and its aftermath) has been crippled by the loss of its leader, leaving the reactionary Nakajima faction to take control of the party. From his new post as Director of General Affairs, Nakajima enjoys decision-making power over the entire party, although he has stopped short of crowning himself chairman, instead appointing current Prime Minister and Tokonami-aligned Mizuno Rentarō."
 japdom.14.notdead: "The resignation of Suzuki stunned the Rikken Seiyūkai and an emergency convention was called.

From his new post as Director of General Affairs, Nakajima enjoys decision-making power over the entire party, although he has stopped short of crowning himself chairman, instead appointing current Prime Minister and Tokonami-aligned Mizuno Rentarō."
 japdom.14.a: "Finally, some stability in politics."

 japdom.15.t: "Japan's Longest Summer"
 japdom.15.d: "The Japanese government has found itself effectively paralysed. The downfall of two successive Seiyūkai Prime Ministers has severely weakened the power of the new Prime Minister, and Hiranuma's open scheme to destroy the parliamentary system has only exacerbated the political turmoil. Extremist groups are growing by the day, and the military is becoming increasingly frustrated. Several high-ranking officers within the Army have hatched a plot to overthrow the civilian administration and 'save' the Empire. The conspirators have approached Army Minister Hayashi Senjuro for his support..."
 japdom.15.a: "The future of Japan lies in his choice..."

 japdom.16.t: "Japan's Longest Day"
 japdom.16.d: "After ten years of political disgrace, the army has seized power again, this time in a coup d'état. 'Parliamentary impotency' has indeed been replaced by a more 'stable' system. The ultra-conservative Baron Hiranuma Kiichirō has played his hand well, he is now Prime Minister, and a state of martial law has been declared throughout all of the Greater Japanese Empire."
 japdom.16.a: "Banzai!"

 japdom.17.t: "Failed Coup Attempt"
 japdom.17.d: "Even though the Army Minister refused to support the coup, he made no effort to stop the plot. The plotters took this as a sign of approval, and proceeded. This morning, the coup forces seized the Metropolitan Police Headquarters, the Prime Minister's Residence, and the new Imperial Diet Building, but failed to occupy the Imperial Palace. To the conspirators' surprise, the Emperor resisted the coup d'état and issued an Imperial Command to suppress the rebels, sealing their fate. The coup forces surrendered without resistance and key conspirators were quickly captured, some taking their own lives before they could be arrested."
 japdom.17.a: "Democracy has prevailed!"

 japdom.18.t: "A New Power Struggle"
 japdom.18.d: "The Coup was carried out by a broad coalition of units, but few did so with the enthusiasm of the Kōdōha junior officers and their associates. Indeed, they were happy enough to do their utmost to overthrow the ever-inept elected government, seeing the parliamentary system for what it was: a plutocratic capitalist institution.\n\nBut little has changed under the new government. Hiranuma and his ilk and the Tōseiha, those controlling frauds, have gleefully taken their leading roles in the new regime - and the Kōdōha have been sidelined for their 'radicalism'. So the junior officers have concluded that they, and Japan as a whole, have been betrayed. Once again, the establishment has seized power from the Emperor and is leading the nation into a different kind of abyss. A new power struggle is beginning."
 japdom.18.a: "Will this ever end?"

 japdom.19.t: "The Kōdōha Counter-Coup"
 japdom.19.d: "Earlier today, Kōdōha junior officers from units in the Tokyo area have staged a new coup d'état! Early this morning, 1,400 officers and enlisted soldiers set out to take control of key communications and administrative facilities. The Army Ministry, the General Staff Office, the Metropolitan Police Headquarters, the Prime Minister's Official Residence and the Imperial Diet Building were all quickly taken, and the Imperial Palace went under siege. In the afternoon, the Emperor himself addressed the soldiers and announced his official support for their revolution.\n\nTo ensure proper governance this time, General Araki has recommended Prince Konoe Fumimaro for the position of Prime Minister. Konoe has connections with various intellectuals, publicists and other notables who are sympathetic to the Restorationist cause, and is expected to find a way to create a Japan that is more in line with the Kōdōha's views."
 japdom.19.a: "The coup is successful!"

 japdom.20.t: "Restorationist Coup Attempt"
 japdom.20.d: "Earlier today, Kōdōha junior officers from units in the Tokyo area have staged a new coup d'état! Early this morning, 1,400 officers and enlisted soldiers set out to take control of key communications and administrative facilities. The Army Ministry, the General Staff Office, the Metropolitan Police Headquarters, the Prime Minister's Official Residence and the Imperial Diet Building were all quickly taken, and the Imperial Palace went under siege. After the Emperor explicitly denounced the putschists the Navy mobilised marine divisions to rescue the palace, and by the evening the coup was crushed."
 japdom.20.a: "Thank god for the navy!"

 japdom.21.t: "The Coup Is Defeated"
 japdom.21.d: "The Restorationist coup is defeated. Branded traitors, the Restorationists are being purged throughout the country. There are calls for the Army to take a greater role in government to help root out both the traitors and the syndicalists."
 japdom.21.a: "Army Minister Hayashi will assume the premiership."
 japdom.21.b: "There is no need for this right now."

 japdom.22.t: "The Government of National Unity"
 japdom.22.d: "Nakajima Chikuhei of the Seiyūkai and Adachi Kenzō of the Minseitō, both supporters of the National Security Act, have issued a joint statement, urging the two mainstream parties to form a multi-party 'Government of National Unity' to protect the Kokutai (national polity) from the syndicalist threat."
 japdom.22.a: "We need a strong government."
 japdom.22.b: "We don't need your nonsense; an election is what we need!"

 japdom.23.t: "On the Basic Principles of National Defence"
 japdom.23.d: "After taking power, the Centralists sought a political blueprint for their new regime. They have presented such a blueprint, titled 'On the Basic Principles of National Defence' and have distributed it among the Centralist leadership. Envisioning an 'Advanced National Defence State' (Kōdō Kokubō Kokka), the document proposes to transform the state into one geared and ready for total war. To this end, not only must Japan's economic structure be reorganised along a militarist line, but the Japanese people must be 'ideologically enlightened' to abandon self-interest. They must abandon class struggle, which is harmful to national security, and restructure society along a moral economic line."
 japdom.23.a: "This is the path we must take."

 japdom.24.t: "On The Fundamental Principles of the National Structure"
 japdom.24.d: "'On The Fundamental Principles of the National Structure' is a 156 page pamphlet produced by the Ministry of Education to establish an official description of the 'Kokutai', or national structure (It can also can be translated as 'national essence', 'national polity', etc). The pamphlet officially enshrines the Emperor as a living god, according to the legend of the Goddess Amaterasu and 'an unbroken line of emperors' (Banseiikkei). To serve the divine Emperor, his subjects were required to cast themselves aside for the social harmony (Wa) and for the prosperity of Japanese culture. To some extent, the pamphlet is a response to criticism of the Centralist's 'Neo-Shogunism'."
 japdom.24.a: "Long live His Majesty the Emperor!"

 japdom.25.t: "The New System Movement"
 japdom.25.d: "To mobilise support for the regime and its reform programme, the 'New System Movement' (Shintaisei Undō) has been organised. Led by Prince Konoe Fumimarō, the movement aims for the creation of a political institution that is capable of merging and binding people into the organic whole of the nation - basically a Japanese breed of corporatism, with the Emperor at its head. The movement's immediate goal is the combination of all political perspectives into one body - the Imperial Rule Assistance Society."
 japdom.25.a: "This is the way we should go forward."

 japdom.26.t: "The First Convention of the Taisei Yokusankai"
 japdom.26.d: "The 'Taisei Yokusankai', or Imperial Rule Assistance Society, is structured as a new political core institution that will represent every aspect of society, unlike the old 'plutocratic' Imperial Diet. It will branch out into every administrative level from hamlet to prefecture, and create a core group consisting of talented individuals from academic, cultural, economic, governmental, military, political, and all other professional occupations. In theory, by penetrating to the grass-roots level, a direct link between politics and the people will be established. By having every important interest group represented at its core, it would be possible to coordinate and develop effective national policies.\n\nThat is, in theory. At the first convention, three main blocs have emerged. At the centre is the Kokumin Seishin Sōdōin Undō (National Spiritual Mobilisation Movement), or Seidō for short, headed by none other than Prince Konoe himself and composed of reform-minded intellectuals and politicians. Many of their proposed reforms were first outlined by the Shōwa Kenkyūkai (Shōwa Research Association), a political workshop founded at the behest of Konoe.\n\nAn offshoot of this workshop, the Shōwa Dōjinkai (Shōwa Comrades' Association), has become the de facto public relations arm of the new government, ensuring that it achieves its goal of attracting the brightest (and the most influential) minds in Japan.\n\nAn outsider to this arrangement is the Kōdōha (Imperial Way Faction), General Araki's clique of reserve and active Restorationist military leaders. It is they who brought the new regime to power through the counter-coup, and who are now left at the sidelines. Special care must to be taken to keep them happy.\n\nMany question Konoe's forceful agenda, and even question the purpose of the Taisei Yokusankai. Konoe had designed the Taisei Yokusankai as a central nervous system of the upcoming 'New System', combining all legislative, executive and administrative powers into one. Konoe assured that the old Meiji Constitution would remain in place and that the Taisei Yokusankai would not replace the Imperial Diet, but the very idea of the political leviathan has met with fierce opposition."
 japdom.26.a: "This will be the foundation of our new Nation!"

 japdom.27.t: "Konoe Fumimarō Secures Support"
 japdom.27.d: "After a fifteen-day-long convention, Prince Konoe has successfully advanced his agenda and secured support in the Taisei Yokusankai. Now as the Premier, Prince Konoe seeks to implement his reformist vision but at the same time come to a common understanding with those who oppose him in the restorationist cause.\n\nThis may be a more difficult task than expected, and the institution of the Taisei Yokusankai has come under fire from the most outspoken in the Kōdōha. Nonetheless, Konoe recognises that he will have to make concessions in order to stay in power, walking a tightrope of politics so that the entire structure won't come crashing down."
 japdom.27.a: "Let us work together, for the sake of Japan."

 japdom.31.t: "General Election"
 japdom.31.d: "Democracy has survived despite everything, and election reform securing its place has been passed. However, with the failure of the National Unity government the government lacks the power and mandate to rule effectively. The solution is clear however: trust in its election reforms and take the issue to the people; the Government has called an election to confirm its electoral mandate and regain the political initiative!"
 japdom.31.a: "Elect Rikken Seiyūkai (Conservatives)."
 japdom.31.b: "Elect Minseitō (Liberals)."
 japdom.31.c: "Maintain the ruling coalition."

 japdom.32.t: "A Party Divided"
 japdom.32.d: "During the Rikken Seiyūkai convention of 1936, Nakajima had felt his leading role was insecure and made power-sharing agreements with other factions. One such agreement was that the powerful post of the Secretary-General would remain vacant (but not abolished), with its tasks transferred to the collective leadership of the General Council.\n\nLast month, believing he had solidified his position, Nakajima attempted to complete his domination by capturing the office of Secretary-General. To this end, he formally advised the General Council to return the post to former Secretary-General Kuhara Fusanosuke, who sympathised with the Reformists, and on April 28th Nakajima and his clique formed the 'Kakushin Dōmei' (Reformist Alliance), effectively a party within a party, pressing the General Council even further. After the general election had concluded, on May 14th the pro-Nakajima chairman of the General Council Horikiri Zenbe forced the issue to a vote within the Council, but the motion was vetoed by all other factions. Isolated within the upper echelons, the Reformists tried to overcome the situation by calling a convention to mobilise their local party cadres, but this was turned down by all other non-Reformist leaders again, frustrating Nakajima even more. Today, just a month after the election, the Kakushin Dōmei formally declared its independence from the Rikken Seiyūkai."
 japdom.32.a: "It is time to find our own path."

 japdom.33.t: "Formation of the Kokumin Dōmei"
 japdom.33.d: "After accepting Adachi Kenzō and his clique from the Minseitō into the Kakushin Dōmei, Nakajima reorganised the party and renamed it the Kokumin Dōmei (National Alliance)."
 japdom.33.a: "It is time to find our own path."

 japdom.34.t: "The National Unity Government Breaks Up"
 japdom.34.d: "Though originally formed to give parliamentary politics a strong face to present to both the Army and the people, from the start, it was clear that the main benefactors of the National Unity Government were to be the anti-mainstream Adachi and Nakajima factions of the Minseitō and Seiyūkai respectively. Over the past years, tensions within the two parties have steadily reached a breaking point. The coalition has shattered, Adachi and Kuhara leaving their parties to form the new Kokumin Dōmei (National Alliance), while the conservative factions of the Minseitō and Seiyūkai have reasserted control."
 japdom.34.a: "It is time to find our own path"

 japdom.45.t: "The Popular Front Incident"
 japdom.45.d: "446 left-wing academics, intellectuals, and politicians (including two incumbent Diet members) were arrested and indicted under the National Security Act today. All were accused of organising a 'popular front' and threatening the Kokutai."
 japdom.45.a: "Well that's that sorted right?"

 japdom.46.t: "The Second Popular Front Incident"
 japdom.46.d: "Additional arrests of intellectuals were made today, when 38 left-wing professors arrested on charges of organising a 'popular front'."
 japdom.46.a: "How many of these Reds are there?!"

 japdom.47.t: "The Keihin Workers' Group Incident"
 japdom.47.d: "An underground syndicalist group operating in the Keihin (Tokyo-Yokohama) region has been uncovered and arrested."
 japdom.47.a: "That's good, right?"

 japdom.48.t: "The Planning Board Incident"
 japdom.48.d: "Seventeen members of the Cabinet Planning Board were arrested and indicted of organising a 'popular front' within the government today."
 japdom.48.a: "This is getting out of hand!"

 japdom.49.t: "The Research Department Incident"
 japdom.49.d: "Twenty-nine bureaucrats from the Research Department (Chōsabu) of the South Manchurian Railway were arrested and indicted today of organising an underground syndicalist movement within the Railway."
 japdom.49.a: "This is getting out of hand!"

 japdom.50.t: "The Yokohama Incident"
 japdom.50.d: "Sixty writers and journalists are under arrest on charges of attempting to form an underground syndicalist party. However, it has been revealed that most of their confessions were produced under torture."
 japdom.50.a: "This is getting bad!"

 japdom.51.t: "Tokkō Officers Accused of Torture"
 japdom.51.d: "The Tokkō, or 'Special Higher Police', is a police force specialising in social and thought crimes. The Tokkō is also notorious for its abusive and brutal methods of interrogation, sometimes even resulting in death. When the National Security Act was passed, the Tokkō rapidly expanded its size and operation, and their regard for the safety of accused criminals declined even further. Today a major newspaper has reported that a man died while in custody, and has accused the Tokkō of torturing the victim to death."
 japdom.51.a: "Oh no..."

 japdom.53.t: "The Great Drought of 1939"
 japdom.53.d: "The country is in the middle of the worst drought it has seen this century. Water supplies are critically low and crops are dying of thirst. In some regions, local officials are organising rainmaking rituals in a desperate attempt to evoke storms and calm the people, but to no avail. Fortunately, the drought is mostly affecting southern Korea, western Honshu and the southern islands, and although rice harvests have dropped significantly no state of famine has developed. However, the disruption to food production from the drought is severe enough to force us to close down several rice exchanges, including the famous Dojima Rice Exchange, and control the rice supply directly, at least for the time being."
 japdom.53.a: "At least no one is starving yet..."

 japdom.54.t: "1940 General Election"
 japdom.54.d: "The time has come for a new general election. With the main and opposition parties now running, the choices are more varied than they have been since the late 19th century. After the elections are complete, His Majesty the Emperor will ask the new Prime Minister to form his cabinet."
 japdom.54.a: "Elect Rikken Seiyūkai (Conservatives)."
 japdom.54.b: "Elect Minseitō (Liberals)."
 japdom.54.c: "Elect Kokumin Dōmei (Nationalists)."
 japdom.54.e: "Elect Shakai Taishūtō (Socialists)."

 japdom.55.t: "General Elections of 1944"

 japdom.58.t: "Hayashi Senjuro is Dead!"
 japdom.58.d.pataut: "A sad day has come to pass - Prime Minister Hayashi Senjūrō has been found passed away at his home. A man who played both the Centralist and Restorationist factions to rise to prominence as the leader of the new military regime, his Premiership has seen great change in all aspects of Japanese life, no doubt cementing him as one the most influential - and perhaps infamous - figures in our nation's modern history.\n\nThe choice for Hayashi's successor is split upon two seams. General Nagata Tetsuzan, seems to confirm the path Japan is going along, known as the main theorist of the Army's Centralist faction, Nagata has worked behind the scenes since the 30s to gain the support of businessmen and politicians alike for transforming Japan into the National Defence State dreamed of by his squad of total-war advocates. Whilst on the other hand, Baron Hiranuma represents the civilian government inclined members of the Centralist faction, a keen anti-democratic schemer with numerous connections in the Army, he would provide a civilian flare to the militarist government."
 japdom.58.d.defaul: "A sad day has come to pass - the retired General Hayashi Senjūrō has been found passed away at his home. A man who played both the Centralist and Restorationist factions throughout his ultimately disappointing political career, his association with the Army radicals worried many at times, yet it all seems to have been nothing in the end."
 japdom.58.a: "Appoint Nagata Tetsuzan."
 japdom.58.b: "Appoint Baron Hiranuma."
 japdom.58.c: "Gomeifuku wo inorimasu."

 japdom.60.t: "The Drought Takes Its Toll"
 japdom.60.d: "With the nation's rural areas already struggling after the lost decade, the drought has served to further impoverish farmers and bankrupt light industries built around agricultural produce. The drought's effects seem likely to continue for some time."
 japdom.60.a: "Shō ga nai."

 japdom.61.t: "The Fengtian-Korea-Japan Provisions Proposal"
 japdom.61.d_pervasive: "After studying the nature of the ongoing drought, the Ministries of Agriculture and Forestry, Commerce and Industry, and Home Affairs, have concluded that there is little more that can be done to stem the impact of the drought beyond the measures that have already been taken. However, the Ministry of Colonial Affairs has come forward with a proposition in which Fengtian could be coerced into exporting millet and rice to Korea, with Korea then providing its own rice to feed Japan. Manchuria has largely been spared the drought, and while it would have to make do with less food for some time, our political and economic stranglehold over the country should be enough to prevent any dissent."

 japdom.64.d: "The Fengtian Government has agreed to provide food, and the major negative effects of the drought should subside soon."
 japdom.64.a: "Good news!"

 japdom.65.t: "The Emperor Supports the Government"
 japdom.65.d: "Following the chaotic past months, the Seiyūkai leadership had been under immense pressure. But with the passing of the National Security Act, it seems the government is finally seeing the light at the end of the tunnel. Today, in a rare appearance, the Emperor has gone before parliament to speak. Solemnly, he declared his support for the Government, and has stressed the need for a return to normalcy and stability, in what some have interpreted to be a strong hint to dissuade any military action against the standing government. As his words carry great weight, his support may be enough to guarantee a continuing trend towards stability."
 japdom.65.a: "We thank His Majesty the Emperor."

 japdom.72.t: "The Emperor Refuses to Support the Government"
 japdom.72.d: "The government is weak, and in a desperate move has asked the Emperor to speak. He has gone before parliament in a rare appearance but he has refused to support the government. His words carry great weight, and this lack of support may be a fatal blow. Without intervention the government will surely fall; do we agree with his support, or argue against him?"
 japdom.72.a: "Let us agree with the Emperor."
 japdom.72.b: "He is out of line!"

 japdom.74.t: "Switching Rail Gauge"
 japdom.74.d: "It has taken tremendous effort, but finally the switch is under way. While it is nowhere near complete, the worst is behind us, and we are already beginning to see the negative effects of our old, narrow, rail gauge diminishing."
 japdom.74.a: "Hurrah!"

 japdom.75.t: "Land Reform Complete"
 japdom.75.bad: "Land reform has been an ongoing political issue and we are not the first government to try and implement solutions; sadly we will not be the last either. Our efforts have been a waste of time, nothing less than a complete disaster! We have been unable to even make a dent in the issue; it will surely plague our economy for years to come..."
 japdom.75.okay: "Land reform has been an ongoing political issue and we are not the first government to try and implement solutions. We may be the last, however; while we haven't revolutionised land use, we have fixed many issues, enough that inefficient land use will no longer plague our economy."
 japdom.75.good: "Land reform has been an ongoing political issue and we are not the first government to try and implement solutions, but where others failed we have succeeded! We have not only fixed many of the underlying issues but gone above and beyond: we have purchased and redistributed tens of thousands of hectares of land to landless or tenant farmers and are already beginning to see the benefits of our work!"
 japdom.75.great: "It's a miracle! Land reform has been an ongoing political issue and we are not the first government to try and implement solutions, but where others failed we have done what many thought was impossible! We have completed what is being internationally recognised as one of the largest land redistribution programmes in history. 2.3 million hectares of land have been distributed to farmers during the project and landlordism, as Japan knew it, no longer exists."

 japdom.75.b: "I'll take it!"
 japdom.75.c: "Banzai!"
 japdom.75.d: "Banzai Banzai Banzai!"

 japdom.76.t: "Establishment of the Budget & Research Organ"
 japdom.76.d: "Prime Minister [GetSecondInCommand], along with other army officials, has proposed a new organ to deal with the budget and conduct policy research which would be placed directly under the Prime Minister's office. Ostensibly, the goal of this is to prepare the necessary funds and carry out policies that are favourable to the Army's long-term plans.\n\nThe Diet has shown great opposition to this proposal, however, as the creation of such an organ would supersede many individual ministries in its power. Some sort of compromise is not out of the question - the question is to what extent we are to carry this plan out."
 japdom.76.a: "Reassure the Diet of our plans."
 japdom.76.b: "This needs to get done no matter the cost."

 japdom.77.t: "The Inefficient Ministries"
 japdom.77.d: "The army leadership has made a proposal to the diet suggesting the merger of several ministries, seemingly to cut out inefficiencies and promote centralisation. Specifically, they suggest to merge the Development Ministry with the Foreign Ministry and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry with the Ministry of Commerce and Industry.\n\nThe Diet is rather apprehensive to such proposals, adding that it would eliminate many posts - something, they note, would only lead to further influence of the Army in politics than even now."
 japdom.77.a: "Reassure the Diet, nobody will lose their positions."
 japdom.77.b: "This needs to get done no matter the cost."

 japdom.78.t: "Details of the Five-Year Plan"
 japdom.78.d: "Out of the many plans the military has to transform the nation, the creation of Five-Year Plans will certainly be one of the most controversial. Many officials, including Army Minister Terauchi Hisaichi, have put forth these plans to gear the Empire towards war, which would put several industries under state ownership and ensure Japanese security on the land and sea.\n\nHowever, it is unlikely that the Diet or Zaibatsu would approve such wide-ranging proposals. Through some sort of compromise we may be able to push them forward - but alternatively, the threat of violence to force them forward is also an option."
 japdom.78.a: "Let's draw out a plan with the Diet and Zaibatsu."
 japdom.78.b: "Use threats and bribes to push forward our plans."

 japdom.79.t: "Curtailing the Zaibatsu"
 japdom.79.d: "The Zaibatsu, the largest industrial conglomerates in Japan, have come under fire from members of our coalition, particularly those from the Kōdōha faction. Arguing that the Zaibatsu are actively participating in Japan's decline: corrupt, nepotistic, they represent the worst excesses of capitalism, reaping all the profits while rural Japanese families, the very soul of our nation, are left behind completely.\n\nIt is true that the Zaibatsu have seen spectacular growth in recent decades, with our investments in Manchuria only furthering their influence on Japan's economy. To remedy this, some in our coalition and in the military have strongly suggested we pursue nationalisation over their assets and production, with the eventual aim of removing their influence altogether. Others have also hinted at the idea of a high inheritance tax, which would certainly help in breaking the conglomerates away from their family-dominated nature.\n\nSome voices have expressed concerns at these ideas, however, chief among them those in the Shōwa Dōjinkai, which have argued that the Zaibatsu are patriotic companies, and that hindering their business would have disastrous consequences in the long run. In response, Kōdōha members have been quick to point out leading Dōjinkai figure Fusanosuke Kuhara's ties to Nissan, founded by his brother-in-law, using his assets.\n\nWhile many in the government are ambivalent on the Zaibatsu, it has ultimately been decided that we should curtail their influence, to what degree however remains in question. "
 japdom.79.a: "Their corruption must cease, start nationalising their assets."
 japdom.79.b: "This is too reckless, moderate our plans somewhat."

 japdom.90.t: "Cleaning Up our Administration"
 japdom.90.d: "Despite the odds, it seems that democracy in Japan has survived the fallout of the May 15th incident, despite the immense upheaval it caused in the past months. Still, instead of praising the stability of our institutions, many are instead bewildered as to how something like this could've happened in the first place: socialist terror, culminating in successful extremist attacks against the Prime Minister, twice in a year, no less.\n\nAs a result, paranoia has started to take hold amongst much of the political establishment, and the atmosphere is tense. How is it possible for these fanatics to target the head of our government multiple times, and succeed? Rumours of our entire administration being overrun by socialist sympathisers giving information to Internationale spies and syndicalist agitators have been spreading like wildfire. Particularly, the Sakai Taishūtō, with their populist platform and pushes for diverting funds away from the military, have come under fire as being too sympathetic to those who nearly threw our nation into anarchy. Whether these allegations are true or not, it has been made clear that the situation is still fragile, and ignoring those warning signs any longer could mean disaster.\n\nThere is, however, a silver lining. The recently passed National Security Act gives the government far-reaching powers when it comes to dealing with radicals. Indeed, the Act enables us to remove any lower level bureaucrats suspected of being interested in revolutionary ideas, trying them as subversives attempting to alter the National Essence of Japan from within. Once found guilty, we could either sentence them very harshly to dissuade anyone from dangerous ideas, or hand them over to the Tokkō to show them the error of their ways through tenkō, a process through which the empowered Special Higher Police makes the guilty party renounce their harmful ideology, using any means deemed necessary. After all, many state custodians and politician are very competent, and could resume serving us well given enough persuasion."
 japdom.90.a: "Crack down on the worst of them, and coerce those who can admit their mistakes."
 japdom.90.b: "We can't take any chances, a thorough purge of any suspicious element is in order."

 japdom.239.t: "General Elections of [GetYear]"
 japdom.239.d: "The time has come for a new general election. With the main and opposition parties now running, the choices are more varied than they have been since the late 19th century."
 japdom.239.a: "Minshutō (Conservatives)"
 japdom.239.b: "Jiyūtō (Liberals)"
 japdom.239.c: "Shakaitō (Socialists)"

 japdom.240.t: "Fate of the Emperor"
 japdom.240.d: "With the finalisation of the last branches of the new governmental system, the future of the Japanese Throne must be discussed. While Hirohito does undoubtedly bear responsibility for prosecuting the war against us, true justice would likely leave him dead or imprisoned for life, and us with an impossible public-order problem on our hands. Our diplomats and even most generals insist that we must instead use a lighter hand. We cannot leave the Emperor's theoretically unlimited powers in his hand as it is now, but there may be some options still."
 japdom.240.a: "Leave him on the throne, but transfer sovereignty to the people."
 japdom.240.b: "Force him to abdicate."

 japdom.241.t: "Fate of the Imperial Family"
 japdom.241.d: "With the finalisation of the last branches of the new governmental system, the future of the Japanese Imperial Family must be discussed. While many members of the Imperial Family undoubtedly bear responsibility for prosecuting the war against us, true justice would likely leave several dead or imprisoned for life, and us with an impossible public-order problem on our hands. Our diplomats and even most generals insist that we must instead use a lighter hand. We cannot leave the monarchy intact, but there may be some options still."
 japdom.241.a: "Leave them be, but powerless. They will no longer be aristocracy."
 japdom.241.b: "Exile them from Japan."

 japdom.242.t: "Black Monday Reaches the Shores"
 japdom.242.d: "Eventually, as expected, the domino effect of the economic failure in the German Empire has reached our Empire. While we are not as affected as our neighbours in the region, due to our quite grand economic isolation from the German markets, we still were touched by it. The Zaibatsu and our banks will have a hard time for a few months."
 japdom.242.a: "That was to be expected."

 japdom.400.t: "The Royal Child"
 japdom.400.d: "Wonderful news has been announced this morning from the Imperial Household, Empress Nagako has given birth to another daughter after a remarkably short period of labour. Despite fears within the Household itself, owing to the Empress's age and this being her seventh child, both the mother and her child are reportedly in good health with no major complications to speak of. Much of the Imperial Family have already been introduced to their newly born relative, with the Emperor himself arriving around an hour afterwards to see his daughter for the first time.\n\nAs is Imperial tradition, the new princess has not yet received a name, as this has been reserved for the traditional naming ceremony that occurs seven days after a royal birth. Despite this many throughout the realm have already begun to speculate what name and appellation will be chosen for the child.  One of the most widespread of these theories is that the name may end up being derived from the Man'yōshū, the oldest extant collection of traditional Japanese poetry, much like her uncle Mikasa's was. Regardless of if these theories will prove correct, the joyous nature such a birth brings to the nation is always a fantastic time for its people."
 japdom.400.a: "A royal birth is always delightful news."

 japdom.401.t: "The Land of the Rising Scrum"
 japdom.401.d: "With the status of the Imperial Family leaving them often beyond reproach, political disputes arising between its members and the government are usually rare, although not entirely unheard of. The recent dispute that has arisen between Prince Chichibu, the younger brother of the Emperor, and multiple members of government is even more unusual in how mundane the subject matter is compared to the usual backroom politicking.\n\nWhile the Prince is widely renowned for his support and promotion of the growth of a wide variety of sports in Japan, the one that he has taken a shining to the most is the British sport of rugby. Having been introduced to the sport by Kayama Shigeru, former president of Japan's rugby union and coach of the national team, Prince Chichibu has become the face of Japanese rugby both at home and across the seas. With the Prince's help the sport has managed to spread across Japan, with many teams from the nation having begun to even compete internationally against those in Britain's Commonwealth.\n\nIt is here where the dispute has arisen, as some of the more hard line traditionalists within the government have started to see the growth of this foreign sport as \"the birth of a cancer that shall envelop our national identity\". Through pushing to have this support for rugby suppressed in favour of more traditional sports, and to rebrand rugby to a proper Japanese name, they have placed themselves on a head first collision course with the Prince and his activism. With the Prince having already issued an objection to these potential policies, it seems that making an official decision on how to proceed is unavoidable."
 japdom.401.a: "Japanese culture isn't going to be destroyed by a simple ball game."
 japdom.401.b: "Tradition is important, perhaps the Prince should help preserve kemari instead."

 japdom.402.t: "$fengtian.173.t$"
 japdom.402.desc: "$fengtian.173.d$ Not all in Manchuria are properly appreciative of Japanese attempts to help develop their nation, and a few have even openly protested what they call a \"blatant act of colonialism\". Still, the launch of the line is a powerful testament of Japan's efforts to bring modernity to both Fengtian and all of Asia as a whole, regardless of what some dissenters may think."
 japdom.402.a: "Three cheers to co-prosperity!"

 japdom.403.t: "The Rise of Datsun"
 japdom.403.desc: "For more than a decade now, American motor companies have completely dominated the Japanese markets. While domestic manufacturers have done well for themselves in recent years, their total combined production would be akin to a rounding error when charted against that of the Big Three of Ford, GM and Chrysler. Even with the chaos at home the Big Three's branches in Japan have kept soldiering on, although it is becoming obvious to many that their output has begun to greatly suffer.\n\nSeeing a great opportunity to capture the potential lost market share, Nissan has released a new model of their Datsun brand of cars known as the Type 16. Despite being almost identical to the previous Type 15, the timing of their release and an associated marketing push including providing a free model to the IJA has already resulted in thousands of sales including even some to well off Australian importers. While it is still too early to say if this momentum will keep up, especially once the American situation resolves itself, it seems like this may be a fantastic year for Japanese business."
 japdom.403.a: "This is only the beginning!"

 japdom.404.t: "Home Run on the Home Islands"
 japdom.404.desc: "Ever since its introduction to Japan a few decades ago baseball has grown to be one of the most popular sports across the entire country. Despite this, until recently the sport has generally been regarded as primarily a casual game that people play in their free time or as part of a school's curriculum. This all began to change a few years ago when media mogul Shōriki Matsutarō organised a team of Japan's best players to compete against America's finest including Babe Ruth and Jimmie Foxx. Taking part in a tour spanning 12 cities across the nation, the concept of professional baseball quickly managed to grip the nation.\n\nThis has led to today's news of the formation of Japan's first professional baseball league, the Japan Occupational Baseball League. Made up of seven teams including the Tokyo Giants, formed from the team who competed in the prior tour, a debut season split into three parts is expected to begin in the next few weeks. With such high public demand for professional games, and of course significant advertising support from Shōriki's newspaper, this new league is expected to be a resounding success that'll entertain the nation for years to come."
 japdom.404.a: "Give it a few years and we'll be beating the Yankees with ease!"

 japdom.405.t: "Opening of the Abashiri City Folk Museum"
 japdom.405.desc: "Much excitement and joy in Ashibari today as the Abashiri City Folk Museum opened its doors to the public. Three thousand archeological and ethnograpic objects collected by Yonemura Yoshio. The museum was desgined by Yoshiya Tanoue, a pupil of the esteemed American architect Frank Lloyd Wright. The artefacts in the museum date from from the Japanese Paleolithic, through the Jōmon and Zoku-Jōmon periods, up until daily life during the Shōwa era, and include materials relating to the Satsumon culture, Okhotsk culture, and Ainu."
 japdom.405.a: "A proud day for our nation!"

 japdom.406.t: "46 cm/45 Type 94 Naval Gun Fired"
 japdom.406.desc: "First conceptualised on the HMS Incomparable, a proposal for a very large battlecruiser by British Admiral Jackie Fisher, the gun remaind a mere dream of naval architects until now. At 10 AM, the Earth itself shook as one of the largest guns ever built was fired. This came after months of planning for the next "ultimate battleship" as dubbed by some more than enthusiastic designers, with some designs proposing guns up to 18 inches (46 cm) which would be able to dominate the seas. Dismissed as a pet project and waste of valuable resources and time by the air power advocates, the gun is likely not to see service until it is mounted on its respective ship."
 japdom.406.a: "No one will be able to match our firepower!"

 japdom.407.t: "Nagoya Pan-Pacific Peace Exposition"
 japdom.407.desc: "Sponsored by the government, the Nagoya Pan-Pacific Peace Exposition was intended to promote industry, transportation, education, science, construction, architecture, social welfare, tourism, fine arts and crafts. Over the two and a half months of operation, the Nagoya Exhibition received more than 4,800,000 visitors, or roughly four times the population of the greater Nagoya area at the time. Daily attendance averaged at 61,643 people."
 japdom.407.a: "We have shown our best to the world!"
 japdom.407.b: "If you want peace, prepare for war!"

 japdom.408.t: "New National Diet Building Completed"
 japdom.408.desc: "After some delay due to the political turmoil in the last decade, the new National Diet Building has been completed today constructed entirely of Japanese materials, with the exception of the stained glass, door locks, and pneumatic tube system. It stands as the tallest building in the country upon opening this afternoon. The roof and tower of the building might have been inspired by another entrant, third prize winner Takeuchi Shinshichi, and are believed to have been chosen because they reflected a more modern hybrid architecture than the purely European and East Asian designs proposed by other architects. The ministry sponsored a public design competition in 1918, and 118 designs were submitted for the new building. The first prize winner, Watanabe Fukuzo, produced a design similar to Ende and Böckmann's. The Diet Building was eventually constructed between 1920 and 1936 with a floor plan based on Fukuzo's entry."
 japdom.408.a: "Hopefully it was worth the wait!"

 japdom.409.t: "1943 Tottori Earthquake"
 japdom.409.desc: "At 17:36 local time on September 10, a magnitude 7.0 earthquake struck Tottori prefecture. The epicentre was recorded to be at Ketaka District with seismic activity recorded as far as Okayama on the coast of the Inland Sea. Hundreds have been reported to be killed with an estimated 80% of Tottori city destroyed, taking many historic buildings with it. Two other earthquakes occured earlier in the year but did not cause significant damage."
 japdom.409.a: "This is terrible!"

 japdom.410.t: "Taihoku City Public Auditorium Completed"
 japdom.410.desc: "Designed as tribute to Emperor Shōwa's ascension in 1928 and to replace the old Qing Empire governor's office for the island, the Taihoku Public Auditorium has finished construction after 4 years for a cost of slightly under a million yen. The city now earning the prestige of being the only major city with a public auditorium outside of the Home Islands. Chief architect of the project Ide Kaoru, aware of the severe differences in both heat, rainfall, and humidity of the island compared to the Home Islands, sought to both stress the local character of the island while also still using the modern architectural designs being applied to the rest of the island through other projects."
 japdom.410.a: "A building worthy of the Emperor!"

 japdom.411.t: "'Little Marin and the Sailor' - Newest Book on Japan's Shelves" #Formerly in 00 Literature events.txt
 japdom.411.d: "Our country's recent war has inspired many home comers to express their experiences in art, one of them being the author of a romance novel of unprecedented sales numbers.\n\nThe book, bearing the title \"Marin-chan to Kaigun-kun\", or \"Little Marin and the Sailor\", tells a story of two childhood friends and their tragic love: a boy and a girl growing up close to each other, partaking in a seemingly unchanging life. However, just when they finish high school, Japan is readying herself for war, and the boy is called to join the Navy. The two have to part from each other, Marin staying at home. Only now that they're separated, they notice their feelings for each other, but struggle to express them in the few letters they can exchange. Just when the war draws to a close, and Marin yearns for her loved one's return, his letters stop coming.\n\nWhile the book does not represent the highest of Japanese literature, it gives an astonishingly detailed insight to both the daily lives of a farmer's daughter in rural Japan and of a Japanese Navy Marine. The book is scheduled to be translated to German, English and Russian."
 japdom.411.a: "Tell me, how does it end?"

 japfor.1.t: "Mantetsu Declares Record Earnings"
 japfor.1.d: "Japan has had a presence in Manchuria ever since the conclusion of the Russo-Japanese War, and in the years since our hold over the region has greatly strengthened. The negotiations at Shanghai in 1928 forced the world to recognise our right to a 'free hand in Manchuria', opening boundless opportunity to our citizens under the Kwantung Army's watchful eye.\n\nOur control is not absolute however, and Zhang Zuolin's' Fengtian Government is not always cooperative. It is fortunate for him that our desire to safeguard a profitable peace in Manchuria remains paramount, alongside our hope that his government will one day act as a vehicle for our greater Chinese ambitions. For these reasons, the heart of our efforts in Manchuria is the South Manchuria Railway Company, or "Mantetsu" for short, which has become responsible for developing and exploiting vast swathes of the Manchurian economy, propelling the region to become Japan's primary source of coal and steel, as well as the producer of over half the world's soy bean supply.\n\nToday, Mantetsu has announced its highest profits to date."
 japfor.1.a: "Manchuria is truly a cornucopia of opportunity!"

 japfor.3.a: "By all means!"
 japfor.3.b: "Refuse them."

 japfor.4.t: "Japan Provides Arms Facilities"
 japfor.4.d: "The Japanese, obviously in an attempt to sweet-talk us, have provided us with a year's access to top-of-the-line manufacturing facilities for armaments. While we're not certain of their intentions, it's unwise to look a gift horse in the mouth..."
 japfor.4.a: "How generous!"
 japfor.4.b: "Turn them down."

 japfor.5.t: "Japan Supports Our Offensives"
 japfor.5.d: "The Japanese have approached with a tempting offer of supplies, bombardment, and ammunition in aid of our offensive operations for the next 100 days. Should we accept?"
 japfor.5.a: "Of course!"
 japfor.5.b: "Never!"

 japfor.6.t: "Japan Provides Fighter Designs"
 japfor.6.d: "The Japanese military has allowed several designs for fighters more advanced than our own to fall into our lap, with detailed instructions on how to build them efficiently. A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one."
 japfor.6.a: "Whatever we need, we get from Japan."

 japfor.7.t: "Japan Supports Our Independence"
 japfor.7.d: "Japanese advisors have turned up today, bringing gifts and support in our struggle against the Chinese. We are grateful for their gesture, but do we really want to accept Japanese aid so readily?"

We are honoured to receive one so learned."
 japfor.8.a: "Be welcome, teacher."

 japfor.21.t: "The Tokyo Conference"
 japfor.21.d: "The Japanese have sent an invitation to their 'Pan-Asian Conference' in Tokyo. Their stated aim is to promote cooperation between Asiatic nations against Western Imperialism, which is an outwardly noble aim. However, some have urged us to ignore it, claiming that this is merely a ploy to woo us into signing over our independence to the Japanese Empire, whose quest for domination of Asia is just beginning."
 japfor.21.a: "Pack my best suit."
 japfor.21.b: "Let's stay home this year."

 japfor.22.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Attends Tokyo Conference"

 japfor.23.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] refused Attendance"
 japfor.23.d: "[From.GetNameDefCap] have refused to attend the Tokyo Conference we held at great expense, providing only evasive and shaky justifications when questioned about their reasons."
 japfor.23.a: "A loss of face."

 japfor.24.t: "Joint Condemnation of Western Imperialism"
 japfor.24.d: "The summit in Tokyo today saw its first major motion come forward, a fairly uncontroversial one that aims to have all members sign a condemnation of Western colonialist exploitation of Asiatic peoples, and urges the repudiation of unequal treaties. We expect it to have major support, and to lead into the other major business."
 japfor.24.a: "On the dotted line, if you would"
 japfor.24.b: "Take no chances, 'encourage' them to sign"

 japfor.25.t: "Tokyo: Condemning Western Imperialism"
 japfor.25.d: "Our delegates in Japan are apparently being asked to put their names to a fairly standard declaration. It condemns 'anti-Asian racism', 'the exploitation of oppressed peoples by European powers', and 'the institutions of Unequal Treaties, through which mechanism the populations of Asia are deliberately kept disenfranchised within their own lands'. Should we join [JAP.GetNameDef] in this initiative?"
 japfor.25.a: "Of course!"
 japfor.25.b: "We'd rather not (drop out of the conference)"

 japfor.26.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Drops Out"
 japfor.26.d: "It would seem that the [From.GetAdjective] dignitaries became uncomfortable with our proposals at the Tokyo Conference, and have elected to drop out of further talks."
 japfor.26.a: "Shame!"

 japfor.27.t: "Tokyo: Resolution on Trade"
 japfor.27.d: "... therefore the attendees of this conference agree that, in order to promote pan-Asian cooperation and brotherhood, treaties concerning trade should be set up and brought to the top of the national agenda in each nation with a view towards establishing a common Asian customs area and protecting the economies of Asiatic peoples from the predatory Western economic principles which are..."

 japfor.29.t: "Tokyo: Calls for Deeper Economic Ties"
 japfor.29.d: "Asia must succeed! We are preparing a package of memoranda for the Tokyo Conference, calling for deepening economic integration between our economy and those of the attendees. Favourable trade terms, privileges for Japanese companies, currency exchange mechanisms and much more are all part of the broader plan. In its current form, however, some of the attendees may be put off by the package and drop out. We could lessen the terms, giving them a better deal and making them more likely to agree, but at the cost of economic integration more difficult in the long-term."
 japfor.29.a: "Present it to the conference."
 japfor.29.b: "Lessen the terms of the agreement"

 japfor.30.t: "Tokyo: Japan Calls for Deeper Economic Ties"
 japfor.30.d: "Or should that be 'Tokyo Calls For Economic Integration'? Either way, proposals have been brought before the conference detailing Japan's desire for deeper economic ties that go beyond the simple trade policies we agreed to. This could be a big step, but it could also be of greater benefit to the [From.GetAdjective] economy than our own in the long term."
 japfor.30.a: "Agreed!"
 japfor.30.b: "No! (drop out of the conference)"

 japfor.31.t: "Final Resolution: A Military Alliance?"
 japfor.31.d: "Ostensibly for anti-colonial purposes, the time is now ripe to bring the remaining conference attendees on board with a full military alliance to oppose our rivals. Far better to let the blows fall on them, after all!"

 japfor.31.b: "Heavily pressure the attendees to sign."

 japfor.32.t: "Tokyo: Calls For Military Action"
 japfor.32.d: "The Tokyo Conference today erupted into controversy when the Japanese unveiled their true gambit: having won economic agreement with their project from us, they have now turned this into promotion of a grand military alliance against Germany and other 'Western imperialist powers'. This would, of course, see them play a leading role. Are we really content with this idea?"
 japfor.32.a: "Together for all Asians!"
 japfor.32.b: "They are surely mad!"

 japfor.33.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Aligns With Japan!"
 japfor.33.d: "It would seem the statesmen of [From.GetNameDef] have agreed that their path to prosperity and strength comes from cooperation with the pre-eminent power of Asia, [JAP.GetNameDef].

 japfor.41.t: "Japanese Ultimatum"
 japfor.41.d: "For months already, the Japanese have expressed their aggressive ambitions towards our colonial lands as part of their expansionist policies. Today, the Japanese ambassador has presented us an ultimatum: They demand that we surrender all our territory in South-East Asia and the Pacific, or else we will face the full might of the Imperial Japanese Military..."
 japfor.41.a: "Don't even bother answering."
 japfor.41.b: "Agree to their demands."

 japfor.42.t: "Our Ultimatum Was Ignored!"
 japfor.42.d: "We did not receive any answer to our ultimatum from [From.GetNameDef]. We must mobilise for war and secure our place as the sole great power in East Asia!"

 japfor.43.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Accepts Our Conditions"

 japfor.45.t: "The Japanese Envoy"
 japfor.45.d: "A Japanese diplomat arrived today, seeking a meeting with [Root.GetLeader] to discuss their offer: [From.GetNameDef] will send military aid and advisors to [PRF.GetNameDef], and in exchange we will join the Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere. Not the military alliance part of it, at least not yet, but rather the group of nations which have pooled their economic strengths under the aegis of Japanese protection. It would benefit the [Root.GetAdjective] economy, to be certain, but there are those who worry the Japanese are merely looking for influence to eventually turn us into a colony."
 japfor.45.a: "We accept their offer."
 japfor.45.b: "We must politely decline."

 japfor.46.t: "The Indians Accept!"
 japfor.46.d: "Our generous offer to the Indians was met with warm praise and acceptance. Envoys from [From.GetNameDef] applauded Japanese magnanimity and astute work in bringing our great nations closer together. We have invited them to set up a permanent embassy in Tokyo."
 japfor.46.a: "Splendid!"

 japfor.47.t: "The Indians Decline Our Offer!"
 japfor.47.d: "In a display of poor judgement, the diplomats in [From.GetNameDef] have declined our magnanimous offer of friendship and alliance. Japanese newspapers reacted with caricatures of scared lapdogs, mocking them for not being willing to take the steps necessary to rid the subcontinent from colonialism."
 japfor.47.a: "Shame on them!"

 japfor.54.t: "Tsingtau Is Ours!"
 japfor.54.d: "The German military harbour in East Asia has fallen to our armies. Instead of their naval ensign, now the Japanese flag flies proudly in the city. German shopkeepers watch our regiments parade through the streets with stony expression."
 japfor.54.b: "A great victory!"

 japfor.55.t: "Japan Threatens Us!"
 japfor.55.d: "A large Japanese task force has sailed into the islands, and is threatening to attack us if we do not bow to their demand of full surrender!"
 japfor.55.a: "Resist them and call for help!"
 japfor.55.b: "Surrender is our only option."

 japfor.56.t: "The Philippines Begs for Help!"
 japfor.56.d: "Japan is pounding at the door of Philippines, and they have come to us begging for assistance. Should we respond?"

 japfor.57.b: "Back down, we can return later."

 japfor.5701.t: "The Japanese Back Down"
 japfor.5701.d: "Apparently the Japanese were unwilling to test our mettle. They have backed down from their threats, at least for now."
 japfor.5701.a: "That's a relief."

 japfor.58.t: "The Philippines Resist!"
 japfor.58.d: "The Philippines are resisting our demands, without any foreign backers to come to their rescue. We should make them pay for this in blood."
 japfor.58.a: "We will destroy them."

 japfor.59.t: "The Filipinos Surrender!"
 japfor.59.d: "Seeing the might of our forces, the Philippines had no chance but to submit before the brave sons of the empire!"
 japfor.59.a: "Puppet them!"
 japfor.59.b: "Annex them!"

 japfor.62.t: "Japan Threatens Us!"
 japfor.62.d: "A large Japanese task force has sailed into the islands and is threatening to attack us if we do not bow to their demand of full surrender!"
 japfor.62.a: "Resist them and call for help!"
 japfor.62.b: "Surrender is our only option."

 japfor.90.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Targets the Legations"
 japfor.90.d: "News from Shanghai in the last few days has taken on an increasingly worried tone as the threat of war seemed to loom over the bund. [FROM.GetNameDef]'s stance towards the settlement is seemingly a reversal of their position a mere 10 years ago, as they now condemn the Legation's existence as symbol of 'blatant Western imperialism' while reports indicate that the Imperial Japanese Navy is being prepared to take the mandate's capital. All of these signs seem to confirm that Japan is preparing for war. But with the international situation tense, [LEC.GetNameDef] far from our nation, and a powerful navy backing Japanese actions, many within our government believe aiding the cities to be a lost cause. Powerful voices within society and especially the business community, however, have pleaded with the government to stand by its foreign commitments and halt Japanese aggression."
 japfor.90.a: "Retreat - we cannot afford to fight Japan."
 japfor.90.b: "We will defend our interests!"

 japfor.91.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Abandons the Legation Cities"
 japfor.91.d: "It seems the Japanese threat to our existence have not gone unnoticed by [FROM.GetNameDef]. But rather than stand by their commitments to defend us, they have remained suspiciously silent. In fact, [FROM.GetNameDef] now seem to be scrambling to abandon Shanghai with as many of their assets possible, simultaneously denying responsibility for our defence. In the face of blatant foreign aggression, our protectors have abandoned us."
 japfor.91.a: "Oh no..."

 japfor.92.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Guarantees the Legation Cities"
 japfor.92.d: "A shocking statement has come from [FROM.GetNameDef]. Supposedly concerned by 'aggressive actions' towards [LEC.GetNameDef], the [FROM.GetAdjective] foreign minister has decried our recent moves and stated that his nation's commitments towards Shanghai will not be ignored. In sheer defiance of reason, [FROM.GetNameDef] is willing to fight to defend [LEC.GetNameDef]."
 japfor.92.a: "They shall have their war."

 japfor.200.t: "The Germans Beg for Peace!"
 japfor.200.d: "Overwhelmed by our superior army the Germans come to us begging for peace. They offer us the entirety of Insulindia and some of their own colonies in return. How should we respond?"

 japfor.202.t: "The Fengtian Silver Crisis"
 japfor.202.d: "When the Bank of Japan and Mitsui Bank, two of the largest in our country, requested payment on their loans in quick succession, Fengtian's Central Bank defaulted due to a sudden and supposedly inexplicably insufficient silver reserve. Whether this was merely gross incompetence and mismanagement, or something more sinister, is unclear, but there is little doubt that the Fengtian Government finds itself in a dire economic situation and has requested our help.\n\nWhile our influence will ensure that both Mitsui and the Bank of Japan are paid what they are due before anything else, a failing Fengtian Government would severely upset their claims to legitimacy and our claims to benevolence. We have the option of bailing them out."
 japfor.202.a: "We have no choice."
 japfor.202.b: "This is of their own making."

 japfor.203.t: "Fengtian Blames Us for the Silver Crisis!"
 japfor.203.d: "Fengtian has loudly denounced our government, citing what they say is a deliberate plot to destabilise their government through the eruption of their recent Silver Crisis, citing the incidental requests from both the Bank of Japan and Mitsui Bank for repayment on loans backed by Fengtian's silver reserve. With the reserve apparently containing far less than the Fengtian government claimed, its economy has spiralled out of control as the government loses credibility by the hour, and it seems likely that this crass and foolish attempt to deflect blame is mostly a reaction to their internal political situation.\n\nAll the same, we can deny these ridiculous assertions, but can we also let this grave insolence go unpunished?"
 japfor.203.a: "False accusations!"
 japfor.203.b: "Punish this insolence!"

 japfor.204.t: "[FNG.GetLeader] Expels our Military Mission"
 japfor.204.d: "[FNG.GetLeader] has expelled our military mission, giving them twenty four hours to leave the country, taking with them all equipment and other property. Contrary to our expectations, however, this was accompanied by a diplomatic letter explaining that the mission had achieved its goals, and that Fengtian is now sufficient in its command capacity. Fengtian's ambassador has also spent the last several hours attempting to convince the Foreign Ministry, in private, that this was merely a necessity of internal politics, and that no ill-will is intended toward Japan.\n\nWhile this may, or may not, be the case, there is little question as to whether this reduces our influence over Fengtian. Who is to say what the Chinese will do next?"
 japfor.204.d_mantetsu: "[FNG.GetLeader] has expelled our military mission, giving its officers twenty four hours to leave the country. Contrary to our expectations, however, this was accompanied by a diplomatic letter explaining that the mission had achieved its goals, and that Fengtian is now sufficient in its command capacity.\n\nFortunately, our control over Fengtian via Mantetsu is extensive, and we can almost certainly force their government to reverse its decision. This may force the more patriotic and militaristic elements of the government to independently declare war, and the consequences of such a situation should also be considered."
 japfor.204.a: "Declare war."
 japfor.204.b: "Force Fengtian to reconsider."
 japfor.204.c: "Punish Fengtian."
 japfor.204.e: "Do nothing."

 japfor.205.t: "[FNG.GetLeader] Expels our Military Mission"
 japfor.205.d: "[FNG.GetLeader] has expelled our military mission, giving its officers twenty four hours to leave the country. This not only severely threatens to upset our control over the Fengtian Government, but also potentially exposes Korea and thereby Japan to attack. This is thoroughly unacceptable, both to our generals, and to the Japanese sense of honour. Surely such an act of ungrateful insubordination must be met with an appropriate response?"
 japfor.205.a: "Send an Ultimatum."
 japfor.205.b: "Do nothing."

 japfor.206.t: "Fengtian Denounces Us!"
 japfor.206.d: "The iron ore deposits at Anshan have been worked by a Japanese-owned subsidiary of Mantetsu since 1918, known as "Anshan Iron and Steel", serving as one of Japan's most valuable sources of steel outside the Home Islands. Now that the company wants to expand, it has apparently begun digging without a permit, destroying farmland in the process, and triggering protests by the native Chinese. These protests escalated into violence, and lead to some regrettable actions by our local garrison and the loss of life on the protestors' side.\n\nThe Fengtian Government has released a long-winded and not at all atypical denouncement of our actions. How should we respond?"
 japfor.206.a: "Punish this insolence!"
 japfor.206.b: "Denounce Fengtian."
 japfor.206.c: "Stay silent."

 japfor.215.a: "That is good to hear."

 japfor.216.t: "The Philippines Have Joined the Entente"
 japfor.216.d: "The Philippines have chosen to join the Entente; they have snubbed out offer of friendship. This must not go unpunished, but the Entente is strong, so we must bid our time."
 japfor.216.a: "Soon, soon."

 japfor.217.t: "The Philippines Have Joined the Reichspakt"
 japfor.217.d: "The Philippines have chosen to join the Reichspakt; they have snubbed out offer of friendship. This must not go unpunished, but the Reichspakt is strong, so we must bid our time."

 japfor.218.a: "That is good to hear."

 japfor.225.t: "United States in Disarray"
 japfor.225.d: "The civil war has erupted in the United States, tearing apart the last shreds of unity in the Union. This presents us with a chance to remove the American presence from the central Pacific by occupying the island of Guam. There is very little that the US government can do to stop us at this point."
 japfor.225.a: "Seize Guam... and claim even more!"
 japfor.225.b: "Seize Guam."
 japfor.225.c: "Best to leave it, I think."

 japfor.226.t: "Japan Seizes Guam"
 japfor.226.d: "With America in turmoil, Japan has moved onto the island of Guam. There is very little that the US government can do to stop Japan at this point."
 japfor.226.a: "Too bad."

 japfor.227.t: "Japan Seizes Motor Companies"
 japfor.227.d: "With the nation in turmoil, Japan has seized control of several American motor companies operating there. The civil war has caused many of the companies to lose contact with their parent companies and they have been struggling to get parts for their assembly lines. This is made it rather easy for the Japanese to seize control of them under the pretence of 'assistance'. While this is clearly an illegal act, we are in no position to do anything more than send a strongly worded letter to them."
 japfor.227.a: "Strongly worded indeed!"

 japfor.230.d.taiwan_kept: "Having been utterly vanquished in battlefields across the Asian continent by our victorious armies, the Japanese have retreated from their bases in Manchuria and Korea. With little hope of challenging our regained supremacy on land, diminishing public opinion and fears of a worsening disaster has forced Tokyo to the negotiating table, but not without playing one final card left in their hand: the Imperial Japanese Navy.\n\nCiting the threat of continued Japanese blockades and the need for both powers to be strong enough to resist Western imperialism, the terms they have offered have mostly been generous though frankly just a recognition of the status quo. Our ownership of continental Chinese territory will be recognised and all 'leases' returned, Korea will be relinquished, we will withdraw from any other occupied members of the [JAP.GetFactionName], a non-aggression pact will be signed, and Japan will refrain from further meddling in Chinese affairs. Notably missing however is the island of Taiwan, which the Japanese fully intend to keep.\n\nGiven our present inability to challenge Japanese domination of the seas and the various other issues our government faces, the prudent action might be sign this agreement. Japanese blockades of the coastline are no easy task on their end, but will disrupt our trade and economic stability to a crippling degree. However, Taiwan is seen as integral Chinese territory, ignominious stripped from us after our defeat in the first Sino-Japanese war. A total victory might take years, but could it be worth it to ensure Chinese unification?"

We have therefore sought the most prudent course of action, which is to find a workable peace agreement.\n\nAfter long deliberations, the Chinese have agreed to terms.

 japfor.238.d: "After being completely humiliated by the Russian army, Japan has offered a conditional surrender, offering full retreat from the rightfully Russian regions they have illegally occupied. Their navy can do nothing besides blockading our ports on the Pacific coast, and their army has been almost entirely destroyed. Most military leaders and ministers say we should accept their conditional surrender, while a minority suggests we should push for a total victory, considering our industrial superiority over the Japanese."

Now we must fight on alone; our destiny our own to choose."

 japfor.252.d: "An unprecedented rising Asian powerhouse, the Empire of Japan, announced that they had formally surrendered all their forces on the Home Islands regarding their recent capitulation. The stubborn and warlike people of Japan are not accustomed to submitting yet faced with annihilation; they have undoubtedly decided to spare their country from further destruction. Once regarded as the premier industrial nation in the Pacific with one of the world's most modern navies and armies to boast, the Japanese defeat led to their sphere's ultimate dissolution. In the face of such an overwhelming defeat, the various members of the Co-Prosperity lay scattered and adrift - perhaps prone to foreign aggression. One thing remains certain, however, and that is that the rising sun has finally faded, and with it, new powers in Asia may soon take its place."

The Fengtian government has committed to aid Anqing in its reconstruction, hoping that it will convince them to participate in the Reclamation War to retake Beijing. If we commit as well, this will surely improve their odds."

 japfor.262.d: "As the collapse of the League of Eight Provinces has devolved into a chaotic civil war, control of important coastal cities has been continuously shifting. However, it seems Chen Tiaoyuan was able to retain control of the city of Hangzhou, and in his time of need has set up a trade route between its port and Nagasaki. Though we have provided some support in the past few weeks, Anqing's lasting control over the city could allow us to make a larger contribution, and as a potential collaborator, helping Chen Tiaoyuan could prove worth the investment in the long run."

Though until now their materiel support had been mostly discreet, we have been approached with an offer for a much more significant shipping of firearms. While this is a tempting offer, some have raised concern that this could lead to growing dependence on Japan for weaponry. Still, considering our currently lacklustre domestic production, this could very well be what we need to restore order."

### New Foreign Policy Events ###

 japfor.316.d: "The Japanese ambassador calmly came into [Root.GetLeader]'s office holding a telegram. A Japanese fleet has been dispatched to Hawaii, and within a few hours will be landing to set up a 'safety cordon'. He has stated that it is in the best interests of the people of the Pacific that the instability engulfing America not spread outside of its borders, and that the Japanese will be taking the initiative to bring stability and peace. He says that he hopes America will cooperate in the best interests of peace across the ocean, and invites us to send representatives to ensure a peaceful transition of power. This blatant power-grab has not gone unnoticed, but with America's current turmoil our leading officers question the Honolulu garrison's ability to hold of the invasion force. Hawks in cabinet insist that the internal situation will not last long, and that our men can hold out until reinforcements arrive. And that the Japanese would likely back down in face of American confidence. Others have called for calm, and are hoping to persuade [Root.GetLeader] to hold off on revenge till after America is stabilised. It is now up to the President to decide whether or not to instruct our Pacific garrisons to stand down or not. It is clear his decision may very well affect the future of the waters"

While some in America have called betrayal, their voices have so far been drowned out by the realities on the ground. A delegation has been sent to meet with American officials in Honolulu to secure a peaceful transfer of power and our troops landed without a shot fired. While the Americans insist that this is a "temporary" measure, this is no doubt a tremendous victory for us in our quest for a greater sphere of influence. However, some in our government have quietly wondered if this is a step too far. What if we've overstretched? And what if the Americans come back for revenge? There's no time for that defeatism now however, Japan is on the move and we will carve out our destiny in Asia!"
 japfor.317.a: "Subarashi!"

 japfor.318.t: "America Defiant!"
 japfor.318.d: "An escalating crisis in the pacific! Despite the chaos engulfing North America, their stubborn government has refused to loosen their grip on the Pacific, promising harsh retaliation for any attempt to violate their sovereignty. This arrogant, greedy attitude could only be expected of these colonisers, but it leaves us in a bind. While there is no doubt that we can seize these islands by force, some have questioned the ability of our navy to hold on to these islands for more than a few years. The United States is a force to be reckoned with, called a sleeping giant by some. But others say the Japanese spirit has always been about defying odds, whether it be bringing the Chinese dragon to heel in 1895 or banishing the Russians from Manchuria in 1905. To lose face even while the Americans are at their weakest would be tantamount to surrender, forever consigning the Japanese people to a secondary role in the Pacific. This is it then, Japan is at a crossroads - what will the land of the rising sun choose to do next?"
 japfor.318.a: "Tora! Tora! Tora!"
 japfor.318.b: "Call the Fleet Back, Patience is a Virtue"

 japfor.401.t: "An Invitation from [From.GetNameDef]"
 japfor.401.d.conf: "At the Tokyo Conference, Japanese officials brought up the notion of deeper economic ties between their nation and ours. Now they have approached the [Root.GetAdjective] government, presenting their offer to admit us into what they consider the economic part of their 'Co-Prosperity Sphere'. They say that we are free to join or refuse, as we desire."
 japfor.401.d.noconf: "The Japanese government has approached us with an offer to join the economic part of their 'Greater Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere'. With it, we would relax the rules for Japanese investment in [Root.GetNameDef], and bring with that investment a degree of prosperity and independence from 'Western Imperialism'. Some say, however, that this would simply be exchanging Western Imperialism for Japanese Imperialism, and that we should beware opening a box we may not be able to close again."
 japfor.401.a: "We agree to their offer."
 japfor.401.b: "We've no need of this."

 japfor.402.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Has Agreed"
 japfor.402.d: "The [From.GetAdjective] government has seen the wisdom and economic benefits that becoming part of our economic sphere would bring. They have agreed to our terms."
 japfor.402.a: "Excellent."

 japfor.403.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Has Refused"
 japfor.403.d: "The [From.GetAdjective] government, perhaps fearing our true motives, has declined our offer to join the Japanese economic sphere."
 japfor.403.a: "An unwise choice."

 japfor.405.t: "Increased Japanese Investment"
 japfor.405.d: "With active encouragement by the [From.GetAdjective] government, investors from [From.GetNameDef] have been arriving in [Root.GetNameDef] in droves. Their presence will have some benefits, it's true, but there is a growing fear that this domination by the [From.GetAdjective] economy will ultimately see us beholden to the [From.GetAdjective] government... if we are not already."
 japfor.405.a: "Investors means more money, right?"

 japfor.406.t: "Investors Build Factories"
 japfor.406.d: "The Japanese investors in [Root.GetNameDef] have been busy creating new factories - a measurable benefit from our participation in the Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere, it seems."
 japfor.406.a: "That's good!"

 japfor.407.t: "[Root.GetAdjective] Subservience to Japan"
 japfor.407.d: "If there were concerns about Japan's continued investment in [Root.GetNameDef] leading to their domination, they can be set aside - it has already come to pass. [Root.GetAdjective] policy is already routinely made to please Japanese interests, and any thoughts we had of our independence have slowly become a polite fiction. The arrival of several 'advisors' from [From.GetNameDef] has laid to rest any idea that we may act as we wish within the Co-Prosperity Sphere."
 japfor.407.a: "So be it."

 japfor.408.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Ends Alliance"
 japfor.408.d: "Foolishly, the [From.GetAdjective] government has elected to end its military alliance with us. It seems they feel they can make it without our assistance."
 japfor.408.a: "We shall see."

 japfor.409.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Withdraws from Sphere"
 japfor.409.d: "Panicked by some irrational fears about us dominating it, the [From.GetAdjective] government has elected to end its participation in the Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere, cutting the ties between the [From.GetAdjective] economy and ours."
 japfor.409.a: "How foolish."

 japfor.410.t: "[From.GetAdjective] Investments Nationalised"
 japfor.410.d: "The [From.GetAdjective] government has taken the drastic step of forcibly nationalising the investments we've made into [From.GetNameDef], also withdrawing their place in the Co-Prosperity Sphere in the process. Perhaps they worried about the prospect of Japanese control over their economy? If so, they have handed us the excuse to invade - if we desire to take them up on their provocation."
 japfor.410.a: "Leave them be."
 japfor.410.b: "We shall teach them a lesson!"

 japfor.411.t: "[withdraw_country.GetNameDefCap] Leaves Economic Sphere"
 japfor.411.d: "Having joined the [withdraw_country.GetFactionName], [withdraw_country.GetNameDef] can no longer be considered part of our economic sphere. They will have to go."
 japfor.411.a: "A foolish move on their part."

 japfor.412.t: "Withdrawing from the Japanese Sphere"
 japfor.412.d: "With our joining the [Root.GetFactionName], we can no longer be considered part of Japan's economic sphere."
 japfor.412.a: "So be it!"

 japfor.420.t: "Investors Build Dockyards"
 japfor.420.d: "The Japanese investors in [Root.GetNameDef] have been busy creating new dockyards - a measurable benefit from our participation in the Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere it seems."
 japfor.420.a: "Very nice!"

 japfor.421.t: "Japan Sends Naval Advisors"
 japfor.421.d: "As part of naval development programme sponsored by Japanese Empire, group of Advisors came from Japan to aid us with our naval programme. They are highly knowledgable in many aspects, so it is up to use to direct them to where would be most useful."
 japfor.421.a: "Direct them to assist our engineers."
 japfor.421.b: "We could use the help of their tactical expertise."
 japfor.421.c: "Some practical experience from training exercises would be best."

 japfor.422.t: "First Prosperity Ships"
 japfor.422.d: "The Japanese engineers which came to [Root.GetNameDef] have been busy teaching our dockyard workers how to build modern Japanese cargo ships, so called "Prosperity ships" - a measurable benefit from our participation in the Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere it seems."
 japfor.422.a: "Great news!"

 japfor.423.t: "Japan Wants Control of our Dockyards"
 japfor.423.d: "The Japanese army and naval official this morning officially demanded control of all dockyards built by their companies in our country. They are reasoning that during these hard wartimes, naval production must be unified under their command."
 japfor.423.a: "Very well."
 japfor.423.b: "Who do they think they are?"

 japfor.424.t: "Japan Returns Dockyards to Us"
 japfor.424.d: "As our common threat is no more there is no legal reason for Japan to have control over our dockyards any more and as such they have returned them to us."
 japfor.424.a: "A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one."

 japfor.425.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Asks for Naval Advisors"
 japfor.425.d: "This morning we received request from [From.GetNameDef] to send small number of our advisors to help in their naval development."
 japfor.425.a: "A worthy request."
 japfor.425.b: "Oh, I don't think so."

 japfor.426.t: "Japan Denies Our Request"
 japfor.426.d: "Sadly Japan has denied our request to send us naval advisors."
 japfor.426.a: "A shame."

 japfor.427.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Denies Control of Dockyards"
 japfor.427.d: "In a truly audacious move, we have been denied control of the very dockyards we worked to create. While it would be diplomatically ill-advised to react straight away, we will not forget this betrayal. They will regret this."
 japfor.427.a: "So much for being allies."

 japfor.450.t: "Japan Embargoes [Root.GetNameDef]!"
 japfor.450.d: "For months we have been worried about the extent of Japanese ambitions and their aggressive moves in the South Pacific, and now we have reason to be. They have stated their intent to lead their sphere of influence to immediately end trade with [Root.GetNameDef], calling us an 'outpost of European colonialism and imperialism in Asia'. The strain this could place on our economy is not to be underestimated..."
 japfor.450.a: "We can endure this."
 japfor.450.b: "This means a trade war!"
 japfor.450.c: "We should draw closer to Japan."

 japfor.451.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Retaliates!"
 japfor.451.d: "The [From.GetAdjective] government has imposed tariffs back on us! This gives us precisely the casus belli we were hoping for!"
 japfor.451.a: "Yes, but not just yet..."
 japfor.451.b: "Respond with military action!"

 japfor.452.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Asks for Closer Ties"
 japfor.452.d: "In response to our embargo, the [From.GetAdjective] government has asked to become part of our economic sphere, clearly believing it is better to work with us than against us."
 japfor.452.a: "Even better!"

 japfor.453.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Does Nothing"
 japfor.453.d: "The cowardly [From.GetAdjective] government has elected to do nothing in response to our embargo. They intend to simply endure it. If we wish to draw them into a war, we will have to do it the hard way."
 japfor.453.a: "So be it!"

 japfor.455.t: "Japan Seems to Plan an Attack"
 japfor.455.d: "We have gathered intelligence suggesting Japan is seeking to take over our colony in the Dutch East Indies. Our military experts warn that we might not be able to fend off such an invasion, considering the comparable states of the Japanese and government navies, and the size of the Japanese military.\n\nThey suggest that we go to the Kaiser and beg him for help: their interest, maintaining the status-quo, aligns with ours, and a Japanese takeover would threaten their possessions too. This might be our best shot at maintaining our colonial possession."
 japfor.455.a: "Message Berlin!"
 japfor.455.b: "Surely this isn't necessary..."

 japfor.456.t: "The Dutch Beg for Help"
 japfor.456.d: "The Dutch discovered evidence that the Japanese are planning to invade their colony; realising that they would never be able to defend their colony with their largely overextended colonial army and limited naval assets compared to Japan. They point out however, that a Japanese takeover of their colony would severely upset our own defensive situation, and there is no doubt at all that the Japanese seek to evict us from the region as well!"
 japfor.456.a: "We shall help you!"
 japfor.456.b: "Clog-wearers shouldn't have colonies anyhow..."

 japfor.457.t: "Germany Helps Out"
 japfor.457.d: "The Germans have agreed to help protect the Dutch East Indies from our joint Japanese menace that's seeking to take our colony away."
 japfor.457.a: "A toast to our friends!"

 japfor.458.t: "Germany Refuses to Protect Us!"
 japfor.458.d: "The Germans let us know that it would not be in their best interest to give their protection to our colonial possessions in the Indies. It seems we stand alone!"
 japfor.458.a: "We can defend the Indies ourselves, right?"

 japfor.459.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Stands Alone"
 japfor.459.d: "Unable or unwilling to get help, [From.GetNameDefCap] now sits alone. Their military is a fraction of the size of ours and their leaders weak; nothing shall stop us."
 japfor.459.a: "Banzai!"

 japfor.460.t: "Insulindia Resists with German backing"
 japfor.460.d: "The Germans have agreed to help protect the Dutch East Indies from us! While we still can attack, we should think carefully about if we are willing to start such a war."
 japfor.460.a: "We will not be swayed."
 japfor.460.b: "Perhaps now is not the time."

 japfor.461.t: "Japan Pursues Divide and Conquer Strategy"
 japfor.461.d: "It seems that Japan's long-standing claims to the legitimacy of our government, not to mention 'fraternal asian brotherhood', were nothing more than lip service. They are now moving towards a divide and conquer strategy for all of China. Our China. While this does signal that war with them might come sooner than we think, it has also damaged the standing of the Concordia Association, giving us more room to manoeuvre."
 japfor.461.a: "They will regret this."

 japfor.462.t: "Japan Exploits the Economy"
 japfor.462.d: "With the conquest of Beijing and Nanjing, the Japanese have ramped up their efforts to exploit Manchuria for their own gain. This seems to be part of a larger policy to prepare all of China - likely under our rule - to be subservient under the Japanese. Such unparalleled barbarism cannot be tolerated, and we cannot afford to be painted guilty by association. Fortunately the pro-Japanese Concordia Association will have a hard time explaining this one away, reducing Japanese influence in our government."
 japfor.462.a: "We must seriously consider a new direction."

 japfor.464.t: "Japan Rewards Our Loyalty"
 japfor.464.d: "In their wisdom, the Japanese government has decided to reward our loyalty, returning back to us land that is rightfully ours. While we are of course pleased at such a gesture, we must be careful; the Concordia Association has gained much support as a result, which will make it more difficult for us to oppose Japan in the future, should we wish to."
 japfor.464.a: "That land should have been ours in the first place."

 japfor.465.t: "The Enemy Has Overwhelming Force" ### Unused
 japfor.465.d: "By now it is become common knowledge that our enemies force far outnumber ours. What began as rumours from our intelligence service has now ended up coming true. While we will do what we can to keep public moral up, even our most steadfast supports are starting to question if continuing the fight is worth it; are we just prolonging the inevitable at this point?"
 japfor.465.a: "There must be time to turn it around..."

 japfor.466.t: "We Have Overwhelming Force" ### Unused
 japfor.466.d: "It has become increasingly clear to both us and Japan that our forces far outnumber theirs. As news of this has trickled down to the Japanese general public there is increasing unrest and support for their government is falling. If we maintain this advantage they will surely capitulate even sooner than we had hoped."
 japfor.466.a: "What excellent news!"

 japfor.467.t: "Japan Expands Propaganda Operations"
 japfor.467.d: "With their victories on the battlefield against the Chinese pretender armies, in particular the capture of Beijing and Nanjing, the Japanese have been making calls for the enemy to lay down their arms and join together in peace. Their propaganda praises [FNG.GetLeader] as the sole leader of all of China and derides the other claimants as petty warlords only interested in lining their own pockets. While the goodwill from Japan is certainly appreciated, it has only emboldened pro-Japanese voices in our government, who point to these occurrences as proof that Japan is a necessary and trustworthy ally."
 japfor.467.a: "Understood."

### Korea Events ###
 japfor.500.t: "Kitei Son and Nan Shōryū"
 japfor.500.d: "The 1936 Olympic games have come and gone, and we have reason to be proud. Our athletes have won us nine medals, setting a new national record, yet some of our victors have been... problematic. The athletes Kitei Son and Nan Shōryū - or as they prefer to be called, Sohn Kee-Chung and Nam Sung-Yong - did well in the marathon race, the former even winning 1st place, but they have overall failed to show enthusiasm proper for subjects of the Emperor. Between dropping their heads during the national anthem, hiding the flag on their chest, and insisting on being called Korean over Japanese, many within our country have been ashamed of their behaviour, in contrast to the popular attitude within Chōsen, largely supportive of their actions. As a result, the athletes have been banned by the central government from participation in future events as well as placed under surveillance. It would be a shame if their victory was used to promote instability within the empire.\n\nThe Foreign Office has also attempted to ensure sympathy abroad remains minimal by lodging a complaint with the Irish government and International Olympic Committee over a perceived lack of care towards ensuring that our athletes properly represent the empire. They have not yet responded."
 japfor.500.a: "How unfortunate."

### Puppet Military Exercise Event ###
 japfor.550.t: "Joint Military Exercise with [JAP.GetNameDef]"
 japfor.550.d: "Since the establishment of a friendly government in Japan, our High Command has been keen to take the opportunity to study the tactics of the former Imperial Japanese Army and Navy, particularly in the field of naval invasions and amphibious warfare. The best proposal for this was a joint exercise, which, moreover, would also benefit the currently rebuilding [JAP.GetName] Defence Forces, so after months of planning, a joint operation had been held the previous week. During the 3-day exercise, a corps-sized unit was trained to land and capture key strategic points near the shore and defend the newly created beachhead. Our soldiers took part on the offensive side with Japanese advisors with war experience assigned to every division.\n\nA few years ago, even the most optimistic voices could not have imagined that, our two armies would meet in an exercise where they would only be shooting at each other in imagination, or that the more or less successful conversations with the suddenly prepared dictionary booklets would take place in such a surprisingly friendly atmosphere."
 japfor.550.a: "Shōgi? Is it a fruit or... ?"

### Sino - Japanese War Events ###
 japfor.600.t: "The Japanese Descend Upon China"
 japfor.600.d: "That which we have long feared has finally come. Long have the Japanese greedily eyed our vast land, taking advantage of our natural resources and divided national unity. Now they are here in full force, this invasion will test our mettle and bravery, and we shall not falter. The Japanese are despicable barbarians. Already reports have reached us of unspeakable crimes and one can only imagine the fate of their countrymen at the hands of the loathsome pirates. The Western Powers, preoccupied with the events in Europe and America have abandoned us to our fate.\n\nAnd while we are in danger, has China not resisted and fought back against invaders for centuries? Our civilisation dates back 4,000 years - a testament to our glorious will and determination. We will resist their invasion with the greatest of tenacity and drive the Japanese back to their islands. Qilái! No longer shall we be divided and slaves to the Japanese dogs, now is not the time!"
 japfor.600.a: "United we stand, Divided we fall."

 japfor.601.t: "The Chinese Resist our Glorious Advance "
 japfor.601.d: "Thanks to the skilful strategic operations of the Imperial forces and the efforts of all the men, Japan has won continued victories. With each day, the Chinese armies disintegrate and break and victory is only a matter of when.\n\nThe Chinese however are offering considerable resistance to our liberation. They do not understand our true intentions of peace and our desire for a united Asian front against German imperialism. There are even rumours that should our advance push significantly far enough into the Chinese interior - the Chinese will even destroy the Yellow River embankments sacrificing the lives of hundreds of thousands of innocent fellow-nationals. Such an outrageous and cruel act will never be permitted by man or Heaven.\n\nNonetheless one must not doubt the strength and determination of His Imperial Majesty's Army! It is an honour to die for His Majesty as we complete Japan's true destiny - to bring all of Asia under one roof."
 japfor.601.a: "Tennōheika Banzai!"

 japfor.602.t: "War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression"
 japfor.602.d: "China faces her greatest national peril and yet for each inch of Chinese land that is lost, the urgent call to action comes forth! Our troops fight back valiantly without outdated weaponry and we are abandoned by the imperialist powers - yet with each day the Japanese war machine suffers; unable to break our indomitable spirit. Soldiers and citizens, warlords and republicans, landlords and peasants - put away your squabbling for now is the time for unity! Greedy barbarians will always envy our beautiful country but they shall not have it. We will triumph over them, let the Chinese people be united in their fight against the bandits - the Chinese people will finally be emancipated from imperialism!"
 japfor.602.a: "We shall fight to the death! Wansui!"

 japfor.603.t: "The War in China"
 japfor.603.d: "As the war in China has escalated, our valiant troops have found themselves at a certain disadvantage despite their outstanding equipment and training. Our commanders in the field have already begun to bicker and quarrel, undertaking their own divergent initiatives, which the government in Tokyo and sometimes even Imperial Headquarters cannot constrain. On top of this the long-standing Army-Navy rivalry has already spilled over into the Chinese War, as the navy refuses to ship equipment, or even throws it overboard at ports, leaving it for the army to fish out of the water.\n\nNow that we are set to push further into China, our supply lines winding along muddy footpaths and through treacherous mountain passes, this problem can only worsen. We must strive to resolve internal conflicts, and optimise our means of war, or else risk defeat in the face of an inferior enemy."
 japfor.603.a: "Shō ga nai..."

 japfor.604.t: "Japanese Propaganda Campaign"
 japfor.604.d: "Since the Japanese capture of Beijing and Nanjing, the Japanese have been expanding propaganda operations calling for peace in the name of Pan-Asianism. Though we know they spout lies, it seems that their rhetoric has infected our populace."
 japfor.604.a: "Unfortunate."

 japfor.605.t: "Japanese Propaganda Campaign"
 japfor.605.d: "Since the Japanese capture of Beijing and Nanjing, the Japanese have been expanding propaganda operations calling for peace and reconciliation between Japan and China, to clear up the misunderstandings between the 'two great nations'. Though we know they spout lies, it seems that their rhetoric has infected our populace and some in our army as well."

 japfor.606.t: "Japanese Propaganda Campaign"
 japfor.606.d: "Since the Japanese capture of Beijing and Nanjing, the Japanese have been expanding propaganda operations calling for peace  and for the warlords to stand down so that unity may come to China again. Though we know they spout lies, it seems that their rhetoric has infected our populace and some in our army as well."

 japfor.470.t: "The Great Pacific War"
 japfor.470.d: "Ever since the Second American Civil War, the Empire of Japan stood virtually unopposed in the Pacific, with many predicting that it would become the foremost power in the region, eclipsing its American and German rivals in influence. Rebuilding its military and industrial might after the civil war, the American government set its sight on the Pacific again, openly challenging Japan's dominance — with reports of naval engagements between the two great powers.\n\nDespite Japan's resounding successes across the Pacific, it now faces its most significant challenge yet, as the industrial juggernaut of America shakes off the rubble of the Civil War and its war machine comes to life again."
 worldnews_japan_vs_america_JAP: "The sun shall not set upon us!"
 worldnews_japan_vs_america_JAP_allies: "May we prevail, and quickly!"
 worldnews_japan_vs_america_USA: "In a moment of weakness we stumbled, but will not falter!"
 worldnews_japan_vs_america_USA_allies: "We stand with the eagle!"
 worldnews_japan_vs_america_GER: "It seems that Japan has overstepped its bounds for the last time."
 worldnews_japan_vs_america_INT: "The imperialists scuffle amongst themselves!"
 worldnews_japan_vs_america_neutralasia: "The balance of power will be settled one way or the other."
 worldnews_japan_vs_america_generic: "Can the juggernaut stand up to Japan's dominance?"

 japfor.471.t: "The Rising Sun"
 japfor.471.d.default: "The situation in Japan has been ever critical since the Tsingtao accord, muddled by numerous economic crises and unrest. Their ineffective response to the German interventions in China led to the collapse of the autocratic Tanaka regime. However, the Empire of the Rising Sun managed to bounce back as a regional power limited to the reaches of East Asia.\n\nToday, Japanese leadership has announced a new plan to seize their spot amongst the Great Powers, by force if deemed necessary. This news has already begun to reach Berlin, with the Kaiser and the chancellery having yet to respond to this barefaced threat over their colonial holdings."
 japfor.471.d.defeated_in_china: "The mighty Japanese empire had only begun to spread its wings of power after the collapse of the Berlin Stock Exchange and Qing's dominance over China. However, in a shocking turn of events, China has managed to overwhelm Japanese forces across Korea and has pushed them off of the mainland entirely. Many observers before this moment would have agreed that Japan would become the dominant power in eastern Asia, but this remains unclear after their calamitous defeat.\n\nIn a recent public address by the leadership of Japan, it appears that they are not troubled by this ‘minor inconvenience' and have announced their plans on becoming a great power once more. Only time can tell if Japan can truly follow through on their ambitions."
 japfor.471.a: "Troubling."

### Fengtian Events ###
 japfeng.4.t: "Japan Launches Operation Ichi-gō"
 japfeng.4.d: "This morning, the Japanese military mission head in our country announced that a state of war now exists between the nominal Chinese Government, implying that Japan was about to play an active role in the unstable Chinese political sphere. As the Kwantung Army operates and defends Japanese interests in Manchuria, our government has been ordered to take immediate measures to ensure that Japanese supply and military needs are to be met.\n\nFurthermore, we are to take part in Japan's war with China. The Japanese Government has been vague on its implications for Japanese plans regarding China, but they have invited us to participate in their Greater Pan-Asian Alliance. In order to facilitate peace and security in Asia and to prevent the western imperialists from taking further advantage of China, Japan has urged us to join the fight against the Chinese Government. While this means that we will fight against our fellow Chinese with the Japanese, it does not seem like we have much of a choice with Japan's presence and threat so close to home."
 japfeng.4.a: "Very well."

 japfeng.5.t: "Prince Kan'in Prepares to Visit Fengtian"
 japfeng.5.d: "Prince Kan'in Kotohito, Great-Uncle to the Emperor, has informed the government of his intention to conduct a state visit to [FNG.GetLeader]'s Manchurian based government. This is not the Prince's first visit to [716.Controller.GetVictoryPointName_11771], but with Fengtian's ambitions to extend their rule over all of China quickly seeming more and more likely to come to fruition, the Prince has expressed a personal interest in inspecting the readiness of their government for this struggle.\n\nWhile the government has of course approved the Prince's request and has already begun preparing for the details of his visit, many fear that it may be far from routine. As countless have become far too unfortunately aware in recent years, China is filled with radical elements, and especially in Fengtian many of them will struggle to pass up the opportunity to do harm to a member of the Japanese royal family. To ensure this does not come to pass the exact details and itinerary will need to be kept a closely guarded secret, and a letter has been sent via the consulate in [716.Controller.GetVictoryPointName_11771] warning [FNG.GetLeader] to not mess this up, phrased of course as diplomatically as possible."
 japfeng.5.a: "The Prince's visit will go without a hitch, if Zhang knows what's good for him."

 japfeng.6.t: "Fengtian Cancels the Prince's Visit Early"
 japfeng.6.d: "Citing a potentially uncovered plot to assassinate Prince Kan'in, the Fengtian Government has suddenly cancelled the rest of the Prince's visit to Manchuria. Within a few hours the Prince was back on a ship destined for Japan, with the Prince reportedly expressing to anyone who would listen his disdain for [FNG.GetLeader]'s inability to ensure the continuation of his tour."
 japfeng.6.a: "While unfortunate, at least he is unharmed."

 japfeng.7.t: "Prince's Visit Cancelled Early"
 japfeng.7.d: "With the Fengtian Government now in a state of war, a mutual decision has been made for the Prince's visit to the nation to be cancelled. While the cancellation is of course primarily due to security reasons, the Prince will be needed back home in Japan to help coordinate plans for aiding Fengtian in their offences."
 japfeng.7.d_FNG: "With the Fengtian Government now in a state of war, a mutual decision has been made for the Prince's visit to the nation to be cancelled. The cancellation is of course primarily due to security reasons, with the Prince's entourage being hurriedly evacuated back home to Japan now that we are at war with them."
 japfeng.7.a: "A shame, but an understandable one."

 japfeng.8.t: "Prince Kan'in Returns to Japan"
 japfeng.8.d: "To the relief, and significant surprise, of much of the government, Prince Kan'in Kotohito has finished his tour of the Fengtian Government's territories without any major complications. After a full inspection of the Government's major cities and their military installations, the Prince returned home to Japan via a ship which arrived back late last night.\n\nWasting no time, the Prince has compiled a shortform report about the observations of his visit. While he of course remained very courteous about Fengtian's failings during the duration of his visit, the same has not rang true with his report. Describing in great details the military, social, and even economic shortcomings of [FNG.GetLeader]'s state, the report finally concludes by questioning if Fengtian will even be able to maintain control of Manchuria, let alone the rest of the nation."
 japfeng.8.a: "Well, it could have always been worse."

 japfeng.9.t: "Prince Kan'in Returns to Japan"
 japfeng.9.d: "To the relief, and significant surprise, of much of the government, Prince Kan'in Kotohito has finished his tour of the Fengtian Government's territories without any major complications. After a full inspection of the Government's major cities and their military installations, the Prince returned home to Japan via a ship which arrived back late last night.\n\nWasting no time, the Prince has compiled a shortform report about the observations of his visit. Rather shockingly, the report has contained almost nothing but praise for the Fengtian regime, and great commendation for [FNG.GetLeader]'s excellent leadership of it. It seems that the Prince is highly confident that barring extenuating circumstances, Fengtian will be able to soon extend their rule across the whole of China. To top it all of, it seems that the Prince has personally arranged for a small gift to be provided to Fengtian as a \"Thank You\" for the excellent security provided for him."
 japfeng.9.a: "Sounds like he enjoyed himself then."

 japfeng.10.t: "Failed Attempt on Prince Kan'in's Life!"
 japfeng.10.d: "It appears that the fears of many in the government have come to fruition, and an assassination attempt has been carried out against Prince Kan'in Kotohito during his tour of the Fengtian Government's territories. While this is of course disastrous news, there is at least a silver lining as the Prince has survived this brutal deed relatively unscathed. After being quickly treated by the Japanese medical staff sent to accompany him for if such an event were to occur, it seems that the Prince is on track for a remarkably swift recovery.\n\nNews of this failed assassination has reached [JAP.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] remarkably fast, prompting a flurry of angry demands throughout the night for [FNG.GetLeader]'s head, preferrably on a silver plater. As dawn began to break, these demands began to shift to a more reasonable push for the temporary withdrawal of Japanese aid to Fengtian as punishment for their insolence. These calls are not universal however, and some have instead argued that punishing an ally so harshly over this will simply harm Japanese interests in the long run, and advocate only a token condemnation. It seems an executive decision must be made as to how to respond."
 japfeng.10.a: "They must be punished for this insolence!"
 japfeng.10.b: "They simply did the best they could."

 JAP_hirohito_desc_body: "Entrusted with the duties befitting of Tenno, Hirohito assumed the throne after his father died on December 25th 1926, reigning as the 124th emperor to sit the Chrysanthemum throne. Prior to this, the then prince regent was almost met with a terrible fate when he was nearly assassinated following the failed anarchist uprising of 1923, which sought to emulate those occuring in Europe. This traumatic experience left a deep scar within Hirohito and he will not easily forgive anyone who would try to lead Japan astray. Hirohito is a strong and stern man who will not shy away from ensuring that his nation of Japan is guided into a bright future under his reign."

 JAP_nosaka_sanzo: "Nosaka Sanzō"
 JAP_nosaka_sanzo_desc_body: "The son of a prosperous Japanese merchant, Nosaka was raised in a bourgeois environment and attended Keio University. It was at his time in Keio, that Nosaka became interested in the international labour movement, an interest that was supported by one of his professors, Kiichi Horie. He then completed a study on a moderate labour organisation known as the \"Yuaikai\" and after graduation; he became an editor for the organisation's journal.\n\nFollowing the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution and the subsequent 1919 French Revolution, Nosaka became a committed Marxist and arrived in France in 1919, where he became acquainted with British and French socialists. Influential through the Third Internationale as one of the de facto leaders of Japan's budding socialist movement, he was able to grow close to the Kuomintang's leftist leadership following their expulsion from China following the failure of the First Northern Expedition. He was involved in preparations for the 1932 Shanghai Uprising orchestrated by both the Kuomintang and the League of Chinese Syndicalists, but the uprising's failure led him to participate in the Mingan insurgency as a volunteer.\n\nAfter having accompanied the Kuomintang for some time and witnessing the success of the Second Expedition, Nosaka pledged his services to the Chinese Army"
