But after almost two decades of independence under the guiding hand of its monarch and the national coalition, unrest is festering: is Finland truly free or is German dominion merely a bit more subtle than that of the Tsars of old?"

 finland.2.t: "Black Monday hits Finland!"
 finland.2.d: "It seems as though [Root.GetNameDef] has not been able to bypass the economic hardship faced by [GER.GetNameDef] and the other members of Mitteleuropa. With the plummeting of the Berlin Stock Exchange on the 3rd of February, [GER.GetNameDef]'s economy was sent into free-fall, bringing down with it a substantial chunk of the world.\n\nThis economic downturn has hit [Root.GetNameDef] at a very unfortunate time due to problems at home and abroad. It is no secret to many that, despite being an agricultural nation, Finland does not possess much arable land and, thus, struggles to feed its populace by itself. This has left [Root.GetNameDef] in a position whereby it is forced to purchase [UKR.GetAdjective] grain in order to properly sustain its populace and avoid further dissent.\n\nOn top of all this, however, is mounting dissent from the [Root.GetAdjective] people, who have slowly, yet surely, begun to radicalise and call for an end to dependency on the [GER.GetAdjective]s. Black Monday has only granted further legitimacy to radical movements such as the Lapua Movement and the [Root.GetAdjective] People's Delegation have slowly begun to make a comeback, giving the radical groups greater impetus. Demonstrations have already sprung up in many areas. It seems as though [Root.GetNameDef] is hanging by a thread..."
 finland.2.a: "Jumalauta!"

 finland.4.t: "The Peasant March"
 finland.4.d: "Aiming to undermine the National Coalition and profess [Root.GetAdjective] nationalism, the Lapua Movement, breaking with their existing ties with the party, have begun a so-called ‘Peasant March' in Helsinki, which tens of thousands of Finns have attended.\n\nLed by several prominent far-right [Root.GetAdjective] nationalists, Kurt Martti Wallenius amongst them, the marchers chanted for the ‘emancipation of [Root.GetNameDef]' from the ‘[GER.GetAdjective] oppressors'.\n\nIndeed, King [Root.GetLeader] has been worried by the recent uptick in anti-monarchist/ultranationalist sentiment, seeing the marches as mere opportunism and a ploy by the far-right to destabilise [Root.GetNameDef]. As it stands, the coalition between the National Coalition and Lapua Movement had already become shaky in recent years. This blatant attack against the monarchy has only served to sever the ties between the monarchists and ultranationalists."
 finland.4.a: "Damn upstarts..."

 finland.5.t: "The [Root.GetAdjective] People's Delegation Protests!"
 finland.5.d: "Many Finnish socialists are still in exile after the civil war. Niilo Wälläri is among those who have petitioned to return to Finland. He is associated with the IWW and other foreign syndicalist parties, but he did not take part in the Finnish Civil War personally. Regardless of that, such agitator has not been allowed to return, and neither has his collagues like Oskari Tokoi and Otto Wille Kuusinen. A substantial minority within the SDP and the socialists that have been forced underground by the government wish to see them return, while some of the more moderate liberals in [Root.GetNameDef] oppose his conviction on the grounds of impartially by the Supreme Treason Court.\n\nIn any case, it comes as a surprise to many that the socialists who had been largely eradicated and forced underground have finally come out of hiding to protest. Many of the more rabidly anti-socialist politicians have begun cursing the name of the syndicalists for sabotaging the current financial instability within [Root.GetNameDef] for mere political opportunism."
 finland.5.a: "We'll crush those traitors once more!"

 finland.6.t: "The Red Guard and the Lapua Movement Clash!"
 finland.6.d: "Terrible news has arrived from Viipuri! Apparently, it seems as though the Lapua Movement had decided to take matters into their hands and, following the news of the resurgence of the [Root.GetAdjective] People's Delegation, have decided to hunt down any remaining syndicalists in the hopes of rooting them out. It seems as though the hunt did not go as planned, however, as the Red Guard, who appear to be working with the People's Delegation, made an appearance.\n\nReports have described the violent fighting that broke out between the two groups, with the clash proving to be inconclusive as neither side was able to gain the upper hand. Eventually, however, the fighting died down.\n\nKing [Root.GetLeader] and the National Coalition have been very worried about the ongoing events as they have only served to further sow the seeds of dissent within the [Root.GetAdjective] population while also destabilising [Root.GetNameDef]."
 finland.6.a: "We must bring back order at once!"

 finland.7.t: "King [Root.GetLeader] Makes a Decision"
 finland.7.d: "Turning his attention towards recent events, most worryingly the various clashes between the Lapua Movement and the Red Guard, King [Root.GetLeader] has been deliberating with regards to allowing the Etsivä Keskuspoliisi to take a more active role in pacifying the radicals, so as to set a precedent that dissent will no longer be tolerated.\n\nMany of the hardline anti-socialists within the King's cabinet have advocated for doing so, stating that a precedent of intervention on behalf of the government is important, alongside the strengthening of the state police, lest the clashes spiral out of control into a full on revolt. On the other hand, however, moderate conservatives within the National Coalition, alongside the social democrats, have advocated for letting the situation be and have made the point that dissent within [Root.GetNameDef] is already high enough and that any government intervention could lead to ordinary citizens joining in on taking radical action. It is clear, however, that the King must make a choice, and fast, lest the current window of opportunity escape."
 finland.7.a: "Send in the state police - we must set a precedent."

Most notably, he called upon the [Root.GetAdjective] people to come together in order to ensure the stability of [Root.GetNameDef] and reject the radicalism of the far-left and far-right.\n\nJoining him were members from the National Coalition, most notably members from the more hardline anti-socialist wing of the party. Whether or not this will change anything, that much remains to be seen..."

 finland.9.d: "Kurt Martti Wallenius, leader of the fringe Lapua Movement, has taken the opportunity to rally members of the White Guard, many of whom have turned to throwing their support behind the party in order to achieve true independence for Finland and the [Root.GetAdjective] people.\n\nIn Helsinki, members of the White Guard assembled in front of the elite Jägers in a demonstration of power and a show of solidarity. Both sides stood their ground for a long time, yet no fighting took place.\n\nWhile King [Root.GetLeader] let out a sigh of relief upon hearing the positive news of a lack of fighting, many politicians and loyal military advisors have become worried as they feel that this may be the beginning of a brewing storm..."
 finland.9.a: "We must remain calm in the face of adversity."

 finland.10.t: "Workers on Strike!"
 finland.10.d: "Due to the effects of Black Monday on [Root.GetNameDef], [Root.GetAdjective] workers have seen prices rise, wages sharply decrease, and rising unemployment. This has, of course, lead to an issue in which many [Root.GetAdjective] workers have found it difficult to make ends meet. A general sense of rising impatience and helplessness has risen amongst the workers, who have now taken it upon themselves to seize the opportunity and exploit the current instability to demand greater wages and better working conditions."
 finland.10.a: "We have no choice but to give in."
 finland.10.b: "We shall not concede!"

 finland.11.t: "The Lapua Movement's Foiled Plot!"
 finland.11.d: "Apparently King [Root.GetLeader]'s decision to send the state police to disrupt any sort of potential plots against [Root.GetNameDef], which had faced much opposition from the moderate conservatives and the social democrats, has worked out in his favour. A plot by the Lapua Movement to create mass instability throughout [Root.GetNameDef] and seize power, thereby proclaiming an independent [Root.GetAdjective] nation, was recently foiled by the state.\n\nKurt Martti Wallenius, known leader of the Lapua Movement, was arrested and the party itself forced to disband. Many prominent leaders, who were able to avoid retribution, have went into hiding. Amongst them was Vilho Annala, who has seen fit to create a similar party to the Lapua Movement, the Patriotic People's Movement."
 finland.11.a: "Hopefully we've rid ourselves of this plague forever."

 finland.12.t: "The Socialists Forced Underground"
 finland.12.d: "Following the raid, disruption, and capture of the prominent far-right ultranationalist Lapua Movement and its activities, the state police have also managed to disrupt the activities of the Red Guard and the [Root.GetAdjective] People's Delegation. While Otto Wille Kuusinen, leader of the Red Guard, was able to avoid capture by the secret police and is still on the hunt, the Red Guard itself has been disbanded, with many of its former members forced to go underground. As for the [Root.GetAdjective] People's Delegation, many of their members, amongst them prominent socialists who had caused much trouble for [Root.GetNameDef] were also arrested. It seems as though the head of the socialist snake has, once more, been cut off."
 finland.12.a: "Wonderful news!"

 finland.13.t: "The Lapua Movement Marches on Parliament!"
 finland.13.d: "Having consolidated enough power over the years, the Lapua Movement has seen fit to march on parliament and have advanced towards Helsinki. Currently clashing with the Jägers, the White Guard who have chosen to join the Lapua Movement seem to be gaining the upper hand against the dwindling number of elite light infantry. King [Root.GetLeader] and the rest of the democratic parties are extremely worried about these turn of events. Indeed, General Kurt Martti Wallenius, who is overseeing the current battle, has continually decried the, ‘[GER.GetAdjective] encroachment upon Finland' in an attempt to boost the morale of the men under his command. And while it seems the Lapua Movement will emerge victorious, the chance of a victory for the National Coalition is still plausible..."

Despite managing to defeat the Jägers, the White Guard have yet to face the Red Guard, who have begun to fiercely fight in the name of an independent, yet socialist, Finland.\n\nIn addition, Field Marshal Carl Gustaf Mannerheim has also made a plea to the White Guard to abandon the Lapua Movement in favour of a more moderate, and stable, Finland which will secure democracy.\n\nThe issue of many competing factions, whether or not the socialists will take power, or if the White Guard will turn to supporting Mannerheim is one of great concern to the [Root.GetAdjective] people, who are anxiously waiting to see what may come of this turn of events..."

The Social Democratic Party of [Root.GetName], who espouse policies in favour of the workers, the Agrarian League, who espouse policies in favour of the farmers, and the National Coalition, who espouse policies in favour of the power of [Root.GetName].\n\nHowever, the social democrats and agrarians have expressed willingness to form a coalition together in order to promote the stability and preservation of democracy within [Root.GetName].\n\nWhatever choice the [Root.GetAdjective] people choose, this will be a momentous occasion, for the [Root.GetAdjective] people, now independent after years of struggling under the [GER.GetAdjective] heel, get to decide who will lead [Root.GetName]."
 finland.21.a: "The Social Democratic Party is victorious!"
 finland.21.b: "The Social Democrats and Agrarians form a coalition!"
 finland.21.c: "The Agrarian League is victorious!"
 finland.21.e: "The National Coalition is victorious!"

 finland.22.t: "The Red-Earth Government"
 finland.22.d: "Formed as a coalition between the Social Democratic Party and the Agrarian League, the Red-Earth government, in order to promote cooperation and stability within [Root.GetName], have successfully, and peacefully, assumed power following a decisive election.\n\nThe name of the government itself is symbolic, for the ‘red' represents the social democrats while the ‘earth' represents the agrarians. While many are sure that the coalition will not hold for long and will eventually dissolve, others are remaining optimistic about [Root.GetName]'s political future."
 finland.22.a: "We must retain some semblance of hope."

 finland.23.t: "Defeating Radicalism"
 finland.23.d: "In order to ensure that another fiasco, such as the [Root.GetAdjective] Civil War and the recent infighting between various factions within [Root.GetName], does not take place, the Red-Earth government has been working tirelessly in order to promote democratic ideals and foster national unity.\n\nWhile the effort is still ongoing, it seems to have borne fruit as the youth of [Root.GetAdjective] seemed less inclined towards the radical politics of some of their elders and have shown strong support for the democratic ideals championed by the government."
 finland.23.a: "This will surely ensure for a brighter future!"

 finland.25.t: "Mending Societal Divisions"
 finland.25.d: "Avoiding the fiasco which occurred and had nearly torn apart [Root.GetName] is one of the biggest priorities for our more idealistic government, with said event still fresh in the minds of the [Root.GetAdjective] people. In order to circumvent this and prevent the mistakes of the past, prominent leaders from within the government have taken to meeting with moderates from both the left and the right and working to bring the [Root.GetAdjective] people together, uniting the nation as one. Whether or not the actions taken by the coalition will work, only time will tell..."
 finland.25.a: "We must foster unity."

 finland.26.t: "The Red-Earth Government Collapses!"
 finland.26.d.socdem: "The Social Democrats, having made the decision to effectively dissolve the Red-Earth government and favour the workers, completely ignoring the agenda of the Agrarian League. Of the course, the agrarians have lodged formal complaints, with enough representatives pushing for the withdrawal of the party from the Red-Earth government to formally end its existence.\n\nWhile the social democrats can now say that they are working to fulfil the needs of their constituents, this does not bode well for the overarching message of cooperation between political parties, and could lead to the polarisation of [Root.GetName]'s politics in the near future..."

 finland.26.a: "We have only done what was necessary."

 finland.27.t: "The Preservation of the Coalition"
 finland.27.d: "Rather than pursuing their own agendas and effectively dissolving the coalition government, which was the expected fate of the Red-Earth government by multiple representatives (even from those within the party as well), the Social Democratic Party and Agrarian League have put aside their differences, willing to put into practice and further the policy of cooperation between [Root.GetName]'s political parties. It seems as though the Red-Earth government is here to remain."
 finland.27.a: "We must put aside our petty differences."

 finland.28.t: "Fulfilling our Promises"
 finland.28.d.socdem: "Looking to reward its supporters, the Social Democratic Party has sought to support the workers through government subsidies and improving working conditions within factories. While this has helped boost support for the party, many other parties, most notably the Agrarian League and the National Coalition Party, are complaining that the interests of their constituents are being compromised for the sake of selfishness on behalf of the Social Democratic Party."
 finland.28.d.soclib: "Looking to reward its supporters, the Agrarian League has sought to support the farmers through government subsidies and preferred access to direly needed crops. While this has helped boost support for the party, many other parties, most notably the Social Democratic Party and the National Coalition Party, are complaining that the interests of their constituents are being compromised for the sake of selfishness on behalf of the Agrarian League."
 finland.28.a: "We have only done what was necessary."

 finland.29.t: "The Social Democratic Party"
 finland.29.d: "Historically known for its extremely left leaning views prior to the conclusion of the [Root.GetAdjective] Civil War, the remaining members of the Social Democratic Party of [Root.GetName], coalescing under the leadership of Väinö Tanner began to move further to the right, despite maintaining its original goals, in order to appear as a more patriotic party while also remaining palatable to the average [Root.GetAdjective] voter.\n\nAs it stands, the agenda of the SDP is to further the rights of workers, regulate [Root.GetName]'s capitalist economy, and push for the continued, yet gradual, reform of the nation."
 finland.29.a: "A new era for [Root.GetName] has begun!"

 finland.31.t: "The Agrarian League"
 finland.31.d: "Founded in 1906 by [Root.GetAdjective] living in rural parts of [Root.GetName], the Agrarian League have long supported the decentralisation and progression of [Root.GetName]. Today, primarily composed of farmers, the Agrarian League has always been an opponent of monarchism.\n\nAs it stands, the agenda of the Agrarians are to foster [Root.GetAdjective] independence, decentralise the current political system, and provide support for the farmers."
 finland.31.a: "A new era for [Root.GetName] has begun!"

 finland.32.t: "[SWE.GetAdjective] Rights within [Root.GetNameDef]"
 finland.32.d: "One of the big questions on the minds of the [Root.GetAdjective] people and, indeed, the politicians of the Agrarian League is the extent at which [SWE.GetAdjective] rights within our nation must be maintained. While the [SWE.GetAdjective] language is most popular throughout Åland, coastal communities within southern and eastern [Root.GetName] also contain many [SWE.GetAdjective] speakers.\n\nThe question on the minds of the Agrarian League is whether or not the [SWE.GetAdjective] within [Root.GetName] should be limited as much as possible, or whether the current situation should remain as is."
 finland.32.a: "The Swedo-Finns are a threat to the [Root.GetAdjective] people."
 finland.32.b: "We cannot infringe upon the rights of a large portion of our population."

 finland.33.t: "Freed Political Prisoners"
 finland.33.d: "Following the victory of the [Root.GetAdjective] People's Delegation and their subsequent purge of reactionaries within [Root.GetName], many Finnish socialists still in exile after the civil war, or having been imprisoned by the government, have been freed and pardoned. Prominent syndicalist, Niilo Wälläri is among them, having spent the past two decades in exile. What this may hold for the future of [Root.GetName], only the [Root.GetAdjective] People's Delegation and their allies, the Red Guard, know..."
 finland.33.a: "A truly joyous occasion!"

 finland.36.t: "The [Root.GetAdjective] Constitution"
 finland.36.d.syndicalist: "In order to properly cement their power, the [Root.GetAdjective] People's Delegation have taken to drafting and ratifying a new constitution for [Root.GetName].\n\nAs it stands, the newly passed constitution provides for the protection of [Root.GetAdjective] democracy, greater rights for the labour movement, a better-and more efficient-method of tax collection for the government, the furthering and support of the new regime's ideological goals, and administrative restructuring in order to allow for a smoother transition to the new form of government.\n\nAlready, trade unions, now infinitely greater in terms of the power possessed, have begun to slowly take over and now make up the government. What this may hold for [Root.GetName], only the [Root.GetAdjective] People's Delegation and their close allies know..."
 finland.36.d.totalist: "In order to properly cement their power, the Red Guard have taken to drafting and ratifying a new constitution for [Root.GetNameDef].\n\nAs it stands, the newly passed constitution provides for the centralisation of power in the hands of high ranking members of the guard, the complete restructuring of the [Root.GetAdjective] army and officer corps, the declaration of [Root.GetNameDef] as an atheist state, and the complete nationalisation of any industries deemed necessary for the survival of the nation.\n\nAlready, the militias, now infinitely greater in terms of the power possessed, have begun to slowly take over and now make up the army, effectively making up the backbone of the government. What this may hold for [Root.GetNameDef], only the Red Guard and their close allies know..."
 finland.36.a: "It seems Finland is entering a new era."

 finland.37.t: "The [Root.GetAdjective] People's Delegation"
 finland.37.d: "A governmental body comprised of a certain portion of the electorate of the Social Democratic Party, the [Root.GetAdjective] People's Delegation had taken power during the [Root.GetAdjective] Civil War, believing itself to be the legitimate successor of [Root.GetName]. Led by syndicalist and trade union organiser Niilo Wälläri, the Delegation itself was very ambitious in its goals and aimed to empower the labour movement alongside the creation of a new constitution for [Root.GetName].\n\nMany of the Delegation's members were either purged, imprisoned, or forced underground by the anti-syndicalist National Coalition Party led by the former King Fredrik I. The [Root.GetAdjective] People's Delegation, forging yet another alliance with Otto Wille Kuusinen's Red Guard, vowed to take back power and set [Root.GetName] on its rightful path.\n\nNow in a position of power, the Delegation is prepared to enact its directives, which even includes the complete removal of the dangerous Red Guards, and set [Root.GetName] on a new path..."
 finland.37.a: "We must stand firm in the face of opposition."

 finland.38.t: "Weakening the Red Guard"
 finland.38.d: "Even before we can attempt to disband the unruly and destructive Red Guard, we must take to weakening them in any way we can. This includes slowly reducing gun shipments, blocking there agenda through legislative means, and setting up prominent leaders within the movement to take the fall. Most importantly, however, we must target their members and, though the use of subtle propaganda, convince them to leave the organisation.\n\nHowever Otto Wille Kuusinen is a smart man, having been able to avoid capture, unlike Niilo Wälläri. We must tread lightly, and hope that the Red Guard does not notice our attempts at weakening them..."
 finland.38.a: "Slowly, but surely, we're weakening the Red Guard."
 finland.38.b: "The Red Guard has caught on!"

 finland.39.t: "Showdown with the Red Guard"
 finland.39.d: "By now, all pretences of any sort of covert operations against the Red Guard have been done away with, following the Red Guard's discovery of our attempts to weaken them. A showdown between the Delegation and the Red Guard is under way, with the Red Guard quickly approaching in an attempt to storm parliament and declare the creation of a new [Root.GetAdjective] state. We must depend on the people to save us from the radicalism of the Red Guard, and allow for the continuation of a peaceful [Root.GetAdjective] state."
 finland.39.a: "The people have sided with us, ousting the Red Guard!"
 finland.39.b: "The Red Guard has seized power!"

 finland.40.t: "Disbanding the Red Guard"
 finland.40.d: "Due to our success at weakening the Red Guard, it seems as though completely disbanding the militia should be rather easy. However, we still run the risk of revolutionaries and more hardline members taking over parliament and declaring the creation of a new state. However, due to our propaganda efforts, we should have enough people on our side to resist and completely disband the destructive organisation once and for all."
 finland.40.a: "The Red Guard has been disbanded!"
 finland.40.b: "The Red Guard has seized power!"

 finland.43.t: "The Red Guard"
 finland.43.d: "Paramilitary units of the [Root.GetAdjective] labour movement, the Red Guard were initially founded in 1905, and re-established in 1917 following the October Revolution in Russia.\n\nServing as the army of Red Finland, the Red Guards were known to many within Finland to be an aggressive revolutionary army, willing to do anything to push their ideology. This had put them at odds with the [Root.GetAdjective] People's Delegation, who wished to control the increasingly radicalised paramilitary units.\n\nHowever, neither of the sides within the [Root.GetAdjective] Civil War were able to make a move as, in 1918, the combined White Guard and [GER.GetAdjective] forces were able to defeat the socialists and assume control of the nation.\n\nForced with no other option, those who belonged to the [Root.GetAdjective] People's Delegation and the Red Guard, and who were not arrested, were forced to flee to Bolshevik Russia.\n\nAfter the formal surrender by the Bolsheviks in 1920, the Red Guard and the [Root.GetAdjective] People's Delegation were forced to relocate to Finland, hiding underground. Now led by Otto Wille Kuusinen, the Red Guard forged yet another alliance with the Delegation, promising to take power and bring socialism to Finland."
 finland.43.a: "We shall bring greatness to Finland!"

 finland.48.t: "The Question of the Military High Command"
 finland.48.d: "The question of the military high command has been a very prevalent discussion between various members of the Lapua Movement. As the issue of the remnants of the [GER.GetAdjective] presence in [Root.GetName] and its eventual removal has always been a goal of the Lapua Movement, it is only natural, to many, that members of the military high command who had served in the Royal Prussian 27th Jäger Battalion should be removed from their positions within the military. However, Kurt Martti Wallenius, who himself had been a part of the battalion, is not a supporter of such a purge and argues that getting rid of the military's best men would only weaken the state of the [Root.GetAdjective] Army.\n\nWith this in mind, the best course of action would be to..."
 finland.48.a: "Purge any and all Jägers!"
 finland.48.b: "Allow the men to remain in power."

 finland.52.t: "[FIN.GetName] has Remilitarised the Åland Islands!"
 finland.52.d: "It seems as though the nationalist [FIN.GetAdjective] has done what we'd feared: namely, the remilitarisation of the Åland Islands. The former government had, with the mediation of [GER.GetNameDef], agreed to respect the rights of the [Root.GetName] citizens in the area. Unfortunately, the Lapua Movement have reneged on that promise, remilitarising the island and silencing any dissent.\n\nWhile many of our more nationalist citizens are clamouring for us to declare war on [FIN.GetName] and take by the islands by military force, moderate politicians argue that we should use diplomacy to take back the islands. What should we do?"
 finland.52.a: "Declare war!"
 finland.52.b: "Diplomatic pressure would be preferable."

 finland.53.t: "[SWE.GetName] Demands the Åland Islands"
 finland.53.d: "The [SWE.GetAdjective] government have seen fit to lodge a diplomatic protest with regards to our remilitarisation of the Åland Islands, demanding we return the islands, which are populated by Swedes, and allow for its inhabitants to reunite with their [Root.GetAdjective] brethren."
 finland.53.a: "What a laughable proposition."

 finland.54.t: "The National Coalition"
 finland.54.d: "Despite having been dominated by the ethnically [GER.GetAdjective] King Fredrik I and the more conservative wing of the National Coalition for most of [Root.GetName]'s history, the National Coalition has also had within it members who belong to a more moderately conservative ilk.\n\nLed by Pehr Evind Svinhufvud, who himself is not unwilling to take advantage of the republican atmosphere within [Root.GetName], despite having pleaded with the [GER.GetAdjective]s for aid during the [Root.GetAdjective] Civil War. Svinhufvud, who himself is an ardent supporter of the White Guard, yet also resists the radical Lapua Movement and [Root.GetAdjective] Delegation, has promised to restore peace and order within [Root.GetName], while also ensuring that sovereignty is maintained.\n\nUnder Svinhufvud's directive, the National Coalition wishes to empower the office of presidency while also preserving the systems put in place."
 finland.54.a: "We cannot abandon our traditions!"

 finland.56.t: "The Citizens of Åland React!"
 finland.56.d: "The citizens of Åland, having bore the brunt of our new changes, are clearly dissatisfied with the government choosing [Root.GetAdjective] as the sole language of [Root.GetName]. This has, unfortunately, had the side effect of already hurting our already strained relationship with Åland, whose citizens ultimately wish to join [SWE.GetNameDef]."
 finland.56.a: "They'll just have to suck it up."

 finland.57.t: "The National Coalition"
 finland.57.d: "Comprised of hardline anti-syndicalists, theocrats, monarchists, and extreme conservatives, the extreme wing of the National Coalition, led by King [Root.GetLeader], has been in power since the creation of [Root.GetNameDef] and its independence, largely backed by [GER.GetNameDef].\n\nDespite having lost the support of large amounts of the [Root.GetAdjective] populace due to the desire for true freedom, the National Coalition have, once again, managed to prove that they can hold on to power and are free to carry out their directives.\n\nAs it stands, the overarching goal of the National Coalition is to maintain historical and economic ties with [GER.GetName], rally the [Root.GetAdjective] people around the King, act as a conservative bulwark so as to prevent any more political instability within the nation, and work towards rewarding loyal supporters."
 finland.57.a: "Interesting..."

 finland.58.t: "King [Root.GetLeader] Calls for Unity"
 finland.58.d: "Holding an official speech in front of the Parliament House, King [Root.GetLeader], in this time of post-crisis and widespread uncertainty, has chosen to appeal to the [Root.GetAdjective] people, hoping to change their perception of him. Rather than being perceived as a [GER.GetAdjective] puppet, the King wishes to act as a unifier for all Finns, and has done so through an impassioned speech.\n\nTouching upon the recent events and political instability, the King has called for the support of the people and has laid out his plan to make [Root.GetNameDef] a more stable and prosperous place for the [Root.GetAdjective] citizenry, stating that he will do everything in his power to make such a world a reality. And while the speech was not met with roaring applause from the still-hesitant and uncertain [Root.GetAdjective] populace, it has won the King a few supporters and has brought him some time."
 finland.58.a: "That's probably the best we could've hoped for..."

 finland.59.t: "Expanding the State Police"
 finland.59.d: "It is clear that we must take to expanding the role of the State Police, so as to allow the detection of activities deemed as stirring up dissent and, hopefully, end such activities before they can take hold on the nation and gain widespread influence amongst the people.\n\nAs such, King [Root.GetLeader] has seen fit to increase the budget and powers of the State Police while also delegating day to day matters to intelligence ministers within his cabinet. The increase in funding has allowed for the investigation office of the State Police to employ a greater amount of employees while also allowing them to test out new methods to deal with any sort of dissidents and protect [Root.GetNameDef]'s internal security. This has, of course, not been popular with large segments of the population, who view the measure as both excessive and totalitarian..."
 finland.59.a: "It is for the greater good."

 finland.61.t: "The Constitution of [Root.GetName]"
 finland.61.d: "Working tirelessly with several former and current government officials, legal and constitutional experts, and members of his inner circle, Mannerheim has been working on the creation for a new [Root.GetAdjective] constitution, so as to lay the foundation for a solid and stable [Root.GetName].\n\nIncluded in the constitution is the strengthening of parliament as the strongest organ of the government, the official abolition of the monarchy, provisions regarding human rights, justice, international relations, and the administration of the nation.\n\nWith so many experts having written the constitution, and the [Root.GetAdjective] people in favour of legitimising [Root.GetName]'s newfound status in the world, it is no surprise that, earlier today, the constitution passed with flying colours, with parliament unanimously ratifying it. It's effects, however, remain to be seen..."
 finland.61.a: "Wonderful!"

 finland.63.t: "[FIN.GetName] Pursues Ties"
 finland.63.d: "In order to garner worldwide support for their newfound independence, it seems as though the [FIN.GetAdjective] government under [FIN.GetLeader] has pushed for establishing ties with our nation. Having sent diplomats on behalf of the [FIN.GetAdjective] state and petitioning us to recognise the new government, it seems as though, ultimately, the choice is up to us with regards to how this situation should be approached."
 finland.63.a: "We shall formally recognise the [FIN.GetAdjective] state."
 finland.63.b: "We shall decline to recognise the [FIN.GetAdjective] state."

 finland.64.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Has Agreed!"
 finland.64.d: "Thankfully, [FROM.GetNameDef] has been kind enough to recognise our nation and we have already begun to open up diplomatic channels so as to formally establish ties."
 finland.64.a: "Wonderful!"

 finland.65.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Has Declined!"
 finland.65.d: "It seems as though [FROM.GetNameDef] has snubbed us, refusing to establish formal ties with our nation, least of all recognise [Root.GetAdjective] statehood."
 finland.65.a: "Damn them!"

 finland.108.t: "Ending the Fight?"
 finland.108.d: "Seeing as we have accomplished all our objectives in Sweden, having captured Tornedalen, perhaps it is time we petition them for a white peace."
 finland.108.a: "Yes - it is time we end the fight."
 finland.108.b: "No - we shall continue until we can claim total victory!"

 finland.109.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Wishes for Peace"
 finland.109.d: "The [From.GetAdjective] have expressed their willingness to formally sign a treaty and declare peace between our two nations, provided we recognise their territorial gains. What say we?"

 finland.114.t: "Ending the Fight?"
 finland.114.d: "We've taken control of all core [Root.GetAdjective] lands in Russia, but the fight rages on. Perhaps we should offer the battered Russians peace in exchange for recognition of Finnish sovereignty over these newly acquired lands."

However, this does not mean we are alone in the East. Now, [RUS.GetNameDef] has embraced the revolutionary cause and stands as the largest Socialist nation in the world. It may be wise to draw closer to nearby [RUS.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], lest [INT.GetNameDef] proves to far off to support us."

 FIN_mounting_dissent_idea: "Mounting Dissent"
 FIN_mounting_dissent_idea_desc: "The Finnish people have been witness to the rapid German influence that has proliferated throughout the nation ever since the establishment of the Kingdom of Finland in 1918 following the victory of the White Guard in the Civil War. This influence can be seen in the form of treaties, German companies in the private sector, German-made weaponry, and the king himself, who is of German descent. As a result, the Finnish people have slowly begun to resent the increasingly tightening grip the German juggernaut has had on the kingdom, resulting in dissent which threatens to boil over at any moment."
