 CAN_french_resistance_3: "Québecois Resistance"
 CAN_nee_recruitment1: "New England Recruitment"
 CAN_nee_resistance: "Yankee Rebellion"
 CAN_bastion_of_the_old_order: "Bastion of the Old Order"
 CAN_bastion_of_the_old_order_desc: "Cast out of their home and forced to take refuge on our shores, the Exiles can only watch as Britain toils under socialist tyranny. But while they may be down, we will work so they most assuredly will not remain so. In Ottawa, Montréal, Toronto, and across Canada, the flags old and new fly triumphantly and every day men of the Dominion are emboldened to prepare for the final struggle to end the Syndicalist menace. One day a reckoning will be sent across the sea; the empire will strike back."
 CAN_divided_nation: "Divided Nation"
 CAN_divided_nation_desc: "The nation is split between the Conservatives and the British Exiles on one side, hoping to force the Empire into preparing for a war in Europe, and Mackenzie King's Liberals on the other, putting Canada's sovereignty first and unwilling to commit the country to a disastrous war. It is hoped that the coming election will decide the issue once and for all."
 CAN_anglo_french_tensions_1: "Anglo-French Tensions"
 CAN_anglo_french_tensions_1_desc: "Most of Canada's French population is located in the eastern province of Québec, and the traditional distrust between the Québecois and English Canadians has heated up with recent talk of pushing the country towards war. Of all Canadians, the Québecois are the most ardently opposed to conscription and the idea of wasting their lives on a far-away war for a sovereign they feel isn't their own."
 CAN_anglo_french_friendship: "Anglo-French Peace"
 CAN_anglo_french_friendship_desc: "Not only have the tensions been resolved, for the moment relations between English and French Canadians are the best they've been in decades. Chances are something will happen which will sour things once again, but for now the French are eager to march right beside the rest of their fellow Canadians."
 CAN_great_depression_1: "The Great Depression"
 CAN_great_depression_1_desc: "Our recovery from the Great Depression was going well until Black Monday hit our shores. Thankfully, the Canadian economy isn't nearly as tied to German markets as some, and economists say it won't be long before we recover from this extra hurdle that's now been placed in our path."
 CAN_great_depression_2: "The Great Depression"
 CAN_great_depression_2_desc: "While Canada has been far quicker to recover from the Depression than their American cousins to the south, their economy is in many ways tied to southern trade and thus they will never be fully recovered until the Americans are. Still, things have been rapidly improving, and economists say a complete recovery is just around the corner."
 CAN_imp_advisors_1: "Imperial Advisors"
 CAN_imp_investment_1: "Imperial Investment"
 CAN_imp_research_1: "Imperial Research"
 CAN_imp_trade: "Imperial Trade"
 CAN_professional_army: "Professional Army"
 CAN_professional_army_desc: "Some armies might pride themselves in having a lot of blokes running around with rifles, but we pride ourselves with having one of the most disciplined and organised armies the world knows. Where mass conscripted Germans and Syndicalist militias flee against a few volleys of gunfire, we stand against the fires of Hell with a stiff upper lip."
 CAN_mounties_1: "The Mounties"
 CAN_mounties_1_desc: "The Royal Canadian Mounted Police, or 'Mounties', have been given sweeping powers to survey and detain suspected dissidents across the country. While many now see them as a sort of secret police, there is no doubting their efficiency in preventing unrest and dissent in our country."
 CAN_billc7_tory: "Tory Economic Plan"
 CAN_billc7_liberal: "Liberal Economic Plan"
 CAN_billc7_mix: "Compromise Economic Plan"
 CAN_quebec_in_flames_idea: "Québec in Flames"
 CAN_quebec_in_flames_idea_desc: "The enactment of full conscription has tipped the entire province of Québec into open violence and resistance to English rule.\n\n§YNOTE: This idea has no effects, but is a marker for the state effects in Québec which reduce resources and local manpower.§!"
 CAN_expanded_conscription_idea: "Expanded Conscription Policies"
 CAN_exiles_active_idea: "British Exiles Drafted"
 CAN_work_camps: "Economic Relief Camps"
 CAN_work_camps_desc: "Call them labour camps if you wish, but these camps exist to provide unemployed men a job, a place to live, and food to eat. The conditions in the camps notwithstanding, this is far better than they could have hoped for than if they were out on the streets without any job at all."
 CAN_unemployment_insurance_idea: "Unemployment Insurance"
 CAN_cbc_idea: "Canadian Broadcasting Corporation"
 CAN_cbc_idea_desc: "The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation is the natural continuation of our efforts to found a respected national radio service, with the British Broadcasting Corporation subverted by the Syndicalists and the Imperial Broadcasting Corporation mostly ignored by Canadians."
 CAN_cbc_propaganda_idea: "Canadian Broadcasting Corporation"
 CAN_cbc_propaganda_idea_desc: "The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation is the natural continuation of our efforts to found a respected national radio service, and its success has afforded us the opportunity to use it as a propaganda tool to support the war cause."
 CAN_uoftoronto_idea: "University of Toronto"
 CAN_uoftoronto_idea_desc: "The University of Toronto is Canada's premier institute of learning, made even grander by the presence of British scientists and intellectuals who fled to the country after the fall of the United Kingdom. Should Britain ever be restored, they will likely return home, but - for now - their presence in Toronto is incredibly useful."
 CAN_aircanada_idea: "Trans-Canada Airlines"
 CAN_aircanada_idea_desc: "Founding a national airline company capable of linking the entirety of Canada by air is no small task. But as a simple airfield is all you need to link two cities together, this allows us to bypass the need for titanic infrastructure works. The skills and techniques we learn could also apply well to general air doctrines."
 CAN_air_training_plan_idea: "Entente Air Training Plan"
 CAN_air_training_plan_idea_desc: "Air training is almost as complex as the air combat it trains the pilots for. By making sure the right concepts and techniques are taught from the get-go, we ensure that the pilots who are later put at the helm of our planes out-perform their peers. Sharing this training with our Entente allies only helps to that end."

 CAN_exile_admiralty_idea_desc: "The British Royal Navy has some of the most experienced officers in the world, with a long naval tradition, and that has now been passed down to Canada.

 CAN_invasion_plans_2_desc: "We have contacted the resistance in the Union of Britain, giving us a network of information on their operations that nobody else would be able to acquire.

 CAN_suppress_montreal: "Suppress the Québecois in [832.GetName]"
 CAN_emergency_draft: "Enact Emergency Draft"
 CAN_emergency_draft_desc: "There are a number of British Exiles present in Canada who either are too old to serve in the military or unwilling. The old guard can serve as mentors to the new, and the unwilling should serve to fight for their homeland whether they wish to or not. The time has come to call them to service."
 CAN_expand_conscription_policies: "Expand Conscription Policies"
 CAN_expand_conscription_policies_desc: "We needn't worry about arguments from the opposition, now - it's time to loosen up our policies on conscription, so we get more able bodies out in the field and we do so faster. Let's cut through the red tape and simply get it done!"
 CAN_expand_secret_police: "Expand the Secret Police"
 CAN_expand_secret_police_desc: "Keeping watch over law and order at home is the first line of our defence. Let's provide the RCMP the tools they need, even if Canadians find such a move unpopular."
 CAN_consolidate_power: "Consolidate Power"
 CAN_consolidate_power_desc: "With Parliament overridden, we can take power in the country wherever it's deemed necessary."
 CAN_expand_labour_camps: "Expand Labour Camps"
 CAN_expand_labour_camps_desc: "The 'Economic Relief Camps' provide a handy labour pool to be used for construction and mining. If those camps were bigger, and populated by a wider assortment of people, we would get far more accomplished far more quickly."
 CAN_increase_factory_prod: "Increase Factory Production"
 CAN_increase_factory_prod_desc: "Cutting through the red tape that prevents factories from working hard - such as worrying about what they pay their factory workers, or where they get them in the first place - will let us get the jump on the syndicalists."
 CAN_fund_the_military: "Fund the Military"
 CAN_fund_the_military_desc: "There is a lot of places where budgets can be cut - because the military needs the attention, desperately."

 CAN_claim_alaska: "Repudiate the Hay-Herbert Treaty"
 CAN_claim_alaska_desc: "The border between Canada and Alaska was made in the favour of Americans, thanks to an interest by the British government of the time in improving relations with the United States. Canadian interests were considered of secondary importance. Since the treaty was approved by a government we are no longer subservient to, we reject the arbitration and the border. Canada has a natural claim to Alaska, and it should have been ours to begin with."
 CAN_core_alaska: "Alaska is Canadian Land"
 CAN_core_alaska_desc: "Now that the Alaska Territory is in our hands, it should not be difficult to establish our full control - and, slowly, the Canadianisation of its people."
 CAN_claim_washington: "Repudiate the Oregon Treaty"
 CAN_claim_washington_desc: "The Oregon Treaty was a settling of the border between the United States and Canada, with the British surrendering the southern part of what we called Columbia to the Americans in order to avoid a war.

 CAN_claim_maine: "Repudiate the Webster-Ashburton Treaty"

 CAN_meet_with_germany: "Meet with the [From.GetFactionName]"
 CAN_meet_with_germany_desc: "Both the Entente and the [From.GetFactionName] are at war with the Third Internationale. There have been murmurings within the Entente leadership that cooperation between our sides might be beneficial... although others say it will likely come at too high a price. Still, it would be worth meeting with the [From.GetAdjective] government to see if cooperation is even possible."
 CAN_access_to_portugal: "Ask for Access to Southern Africa"
 CAN_access_to_portugal_desc: "Our war against [SAF.GetNameDef] will be difficult to pursue unless we gain access to bases closer to their territory. Thankfully, [From.GetNameDef] is a traditional British ally and still retains territory nearby. We should ask them for military and naval access, on behalf of the entire Entente."

 CAN_returning_home_decisions: "The Home Isles"
 CAN_returning_home_decisions_desc: "Our primary goal is to see the Home Isles wrested from the hands of the syndicalists and returned to the United Kingdom. That is our duty as leader of the Entente, as subjects to [CAN_king_full_name], and as second home to over half a million British Exiles. It will not be an easy task, but we must somehow find a way."
 CAN_erode_uob_legitimacy: "Erode Syndicalist Legitimacy"
 CAN_erode_uob_legitimacy_desc: "Our efforts must be to convince the British people that the [ENG.GetName] government is and always was an illegitimate construction, as well as their true oppressor. If their will to fight on behalf of the syndicalists collapses, the reconstruction of the United Kingdom can truly begin."
 CAN_attack_uob: "Retake the Home Isles"
 CAN_attack_uob_desc: "We must be careful to time our attack carefully, as [From.GetNameDef] and its allies are far more powerful than us on an individual level. We cannot, however, sit on our hands forever. At some point, caution must be thrown to the wind, as fate favours the bold!"
 CAN_all_hands_on_deck: "All Hands on Deck!"
 CAN_all_hands_on_deck_desc: "The fight against the syndicalists will take everything we got - and that means casting our net for conscription wider than ever before."

 CAN_approach_ireland: "Approach [IRE.GetNameDef]"
 CAN_approach_ireland_desc: "The Irish may have already openly allied with the Germans, but they may still be amenable to overtures allowing us to use Ireland as a stopping point for an invasion of the Britain - provided they can trust the British government-in-exile enough to cooperate, of course."
 CAN_reconcile_with_ireland: "Reconcile with [IRE.GetNameDef]"
 CAN_reconcile_with_ireland_desc: "Ireland is perhaps the most attractive staging ground for any invasion of Britain - if access to the country could be secured, it would be an immeasurable boon. The Irish have been concerned enough about the Union since its inception that an alliance is not impossible, even if it doesn't come for free."
 CAN_bailout_iceland: "Bailout [ICE.GetNameDef]"
 CAN_bailout_iceland_desc: "Black Monday has devastated the Icelandic economy, leaving them scrambling to recover. It's a small country, however, and a bailout on our part would be easily handled - and might be enough to convince them to join the Entente and provide us a potential launching point for an invasion of Britain."
 CAN_fund_icelandic_resistance: "Fund the Icelandic Resistance"
 CAN_fund_icelandic_resistance_desc: "[From.GetNameDefCap] is currently under the [ENG.GetAdjective] thumb, but with some quiet funding that could rapidly change."
 CAN_seize_greenland: "Seize Greenland"
 CAN_seize_greenland_desc: "With [From.GetNameDef] in the midst of an emergency, we need to act quickly to secure our own borders - the island of Greenland is too close to allow the possibility of an enemy presence."
 CAN_build_base_greenland: "Expand Godthåb Naval Base"
 CAN_build_base_greenland_desc: "Greenland isn't the most ideal place from which to control the Atlantic, but it shall serve."

 CAN_reinforce_ottawa: "Reinforce Ottawa"

 CAN_declare_war_on_CSA_desc: "It appears [CSA.GetNameDef] is on the verge of winning the civil war in the south. While they are strong, we must face them now... or risk facing them later, once they have recovered and gathered their full strength.

 CAN_invite_PSA_ceasefire: "Invite [PSA.GetNameDef] into the Entente"
 CAN_invite_PSA_ceasefire_desc: "The [ACW_ceasefire_name] leaves [PSA.GetNameDef] in a precarious situation: they control the west, but [CSA.GetNameDef] controls the industrial heartland and the East Coast. They will be hard-pressed to win the war once the ceasefire ends, so perhaps this is a good time to approach them about Entente membership. It will mean committing ourselves to war with the CSA, but - quite frankly - that was going to happen eventually anyhow."

 CAN_kings_speech_desc: "Edward, Prince of Wales, will be coronated king as the Canadian political landscape consists of two main factions: one led by Liberal Prime Minister Mackenzie King, the other led by Conservative R.B. Bennett and the exiled British aristocracy. The Empire will be awaiting his radio address after the coronation, where he will be expected to declare his government's direction."
 CAN_privy_council: "Status of the Privy Council"
 CAN_privy_council_desc: "The British government-in-exile has acted on emergency powers since the country's downfall, wielding power only through its status as the king's Privy Council. It's been over a decade, however, and there are many who feel that the time has come for a change."
 CAN_imperial_conference: "The Imperial Conference"
 CAN_imperial_conference_desc: "There has not been a gathering of the Dominions since the fall of the Home Isles, but it's been decided that now is the time - even if Canada is at the head of the table, instead of the United Kingdom. The Dominions must prepare to work together if there is any hope of defeating the syndicalists."
 CAN_fate_of_the_senate: "Fate of the Senate"
 CAN_fate_of_the_senate_desc: "The Canadian Senate consists of appointees by the sovereign, which - since the fall of the United Kingdom - have consisted almost entirely of British Exiles. Considering the Senate has ultimate control over bills passed by the House of Commons, has the time come to finally enact Senate Reform?"
 CAN_draft_bill_c7: "Draft Bill C-7"
 CAN_draft_bill_c7_desc: "With the election finally over, it is time for the government to concentrate on Bill C-7 - which will determine the country's approach to conscription, the military industry, and our national security. The debate will begin the moment it's introduced in the House of Commons, and will consume the government's attention until it is complete."

 CAN_quebec_in_flames: "Québec in Flames"
 CAN_quebec_in_flames_desc: "The patience of the Québecois with English Canada has finally hit a boiling point. Across the eastern province, demonstrations and even riots have broken down the fabric of social order... at a time when Canada can least afford it. Somehow, things must be set right."
 CAN_montreal_conference: "The Montréal Conference"

 CAN_official_bilingualism: "Official Bilingualism"
 CAN_official_bilingualism_desc: "French has always been present in Canada as a second language, but the first and biggest demand of the Québecois is that it be made an official language - as important as English at every governmental level across the nation, and protected within the province of Québec itself."
 CAN_new_quebec_status: "New Status for Québec"
 CAN_new_quebec_status_desc: "To resolve the situation in Québec, we must amend their status within Confederation. They are not a province like any other, but have a unique status and thus unique requirements. Providing them greater powers over their own immigration policies and greater say over government policies that affect them directly will finally tell them we are serious about equality."
 CAN_suppress_quebecois: "Suppress the Québecois"
 CAN_suppress_quebecois_desc: "We have had enough. Understanding the interests of the Québecois is one thing, but letting them decide when they get to be part of this country and when to fight for it? It is beyond reason.

 CAN_promote_anglophones_desc: "Left unspoken is the significant presence of English Canadians within the province of Québec. Montreal is almost half-English, and all these people feel helplessly drawn into the conflict originating with the French. We must ensure they are not reduced to second-class citizens within their own country."
 CAN_surete_du_quebec: "Sûreté du Québec"
 CAN_surete_du_quebec_desc: "The time has come to rebuild the provincial police force in Québec, to make sure that it is capable of maintaining order and that it has full power to maintain surveillance over the French population. Once Québec and Canada are both at peace, perhaps we can begin to talk about French grievances."
 CAN_war_measures_act: "Invoke the War Measures Act"
 CAN_war_measures_act_desc: "The idea behind the War Measures Act is simple: in a time of war, the federal government has the right to suspend the rights of Canadian citizens. It must be able to take whatever actions it deems necessary, without impediment by normal democratic procedure, in order to prevent the breakdown of public order."
 CAN_purge_the_opposition: "Control the House of Commons"
 CAN_purge_the_opposition_desc: "A loyal opposition within the House of Commons is all well and good, but with the War Measures Act invoked we neither have the time nor inclination to engage in eternal debate and appease the endless outrage conjured by the Liberals. We must end the debate, so we can get to the business at hand."
 CAN_assert_royal_prerogatives: "Assert Royal Prerogatives"
 CAN_assert_royal_prerogatives_desc: "The monarch has the seldom-employed ability to dissolve Parliament, if he sees fit. Given enough influence and popularity within Canada, this could be done without the expectation of a widespread revolt... and perhaps it should be done, if we are to have any chance of victory."

 CAN_crown_corporations: "The Crown Corporations"
 CAN_crown_corporations_desc: "Enterprises founded and run by the state, so-called 'Crown Corporations', allow us to develop and maintain access to strategic resources and expertise that might otherwise by neglected or ignored by the market. Sadly, not every industrial magnate sees the use of investing in wartime resources, at least for now."
 CAN_cn_rail_expansion: "CN Rail Expansion"
 CAN_cn_rail_expansion_desc: "Rail networks are the arteries of the nation of Canada, and none more so than the state-run Canadian National Railway. Expanding this network can only strengthen the nation, and it will surely prove crucial should we need to perform wartime supply and troops transport across the nation."
 CAN_cp_rail_expansion: "CP Rail Expansion"
 CAN_cp_rail_expansion_desc: "It was only the promise of a trans-continental rail network that brought the western provinces into the Dominion. Maintaining and expanding this network will help ensure our continued control over the region, and will serve us should we ever require large-scale fret between both seas."
 CAN_invest_resources: "Invest in Natural Resources"
 CAN_invest_resources_desc: "Much of the nation's wealth lies in its untapped natural resources. While prospecting and exploiting all those deposits hidden in Canada's wastes and wilderness will take time, we can take advantage of this natural bounty to ensure our strength and independence."
 CAN_prairie_oil: "Prairie Oil Prospects"
 CAN_prairie_oil_desc: "There has been small scale drilling in the prairie provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan for some time. But perhaps there is more of this critical resource waiting for those who bother to look? Perhaps we might even be sitting on fields of oil that would rival those of the United States?"
 CAN_explore_the_north: "Explore the North"
 CAN_explore_the_north_desc: "Before we can mine it, we have to find it. While the large forests have long been explored by civilian prospectors, only state-funded geological expeditions will dare venture into the Arctic and sub-Arctic regions to identify the best sites for excavation and extraction."
 CAN_create_iedc: "Create the IEDC"
 CAN_create_iedc_desc: "Suggestions have been made to form an Imperial Economic Development Council, to expand the industrial strength of the Entente by having its members work together on economic matters. Funded by Canada, the strongest remaining member of the Empire, the IEDC would serve to help us meet the challenges ahead."
 CAN_public_works: "Open Federal Relief Camps"
 CAN_public_works_desc: "The Great Depression has not released its hold upon us yet - we still have hordes of unemployed men across the country, living in poverty or turning to crime. Our best answer is to gather these people together in 'economic relief camps'. There they will receive a wage and food to eat, and they can be put to use across the country as a ready labour force."

 CAN_polymer_corp: "Polymer Corporation"
 CAN_polymer_corp_desc: "The Polymer Corporation, or Polycorp, is a crown corporation tasked with the development and production of new materials like nylon and synthetic rubber. These new materials will allow us to discover new ways to produce equipment that has until then proved a problem for our industry, making them cheaper and faster to output."
 CAN_create_isac: "Create the ISAC"
 CAN_create_isac_desc: "A number of university presidents and scientific leaders meeting in Toronto have called for the formation of a new organisation to coordinate research among the member states of the Entente. The work of co-coordinating these links is to be carried out by the Imperial Scientific and Academic Council, located and funded by Canada, with contributions from the rest of the alliance."
 CAN_national_research_council: "National Research Council"
 CAN_national_research_council_desc: "The National Research Council was founded during the Weltkrieg to advise the Canadian government on science and research. By providing the organisation with additional funding and support we can expand our technology base to the benefit of both industry and military."
 CAN_found_cbc: "Found the CBC"
 CAN_found_cbc_desc: "A proposal has been put forward to expand the Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission into a full-fledged national radio network called the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. This would help bring together a divided nation, and limit the influence of potentially subversive foreign broadcasts."
 CAN_electronics_training: "Electronics Training Initiative"
 CAN_electronics_training_desc: "We should take it upon ourselves to train a cadre of experts to man and maintain radios, RADAR and other modern electronic weapons of war. The RADAR is no simple technology, and we will need competent engineers and field operators to ensure our stations work at maximal efficiency, especially as we build more."
 CAN_university_of_toronto: "University of Toronto"
 CAN_university_of_toronto_desc: "The University of Toronto is one of Canada's oldest institutions of learning, and it is the facility that grew the most when the brightest minds from the United Kingdom fled to the country. That gathering of intelligentsia is something we should take advantage of with increased funding on government-approved projects."
 CAN_we_need_industry: "We Need Industry"
 CAN_we_need_industry_desc: "Our biggest need right now is to expand Canada's industrial base. It will never rival that of the Americans to the south, due to our smaller population, but we need to try."
 CAN_we_need_munitions: "We Need Armaments"
 CAN_we_need_munitions_desc: "We need factories to push out guns and bullets, in greater numbers than it was ever assumed possible... even if we need to build them from scratch."
 CAN_we_need_ships: "We Need Ships"
 CAN_we_need_ships_desc: "Our enemies are all across the ocean. We cannot rely on the ageing British ships to hold us over - we need to support our fleet and improve it, and replace lost ships as they fall."

 CAN_expand_air_force: "Expand the Air Force"
 CAN_expand_air_force_desc: "The Royal Canadian Air force fought with distinction during the Great War, but has long since suffered from serious neglect. We can no longer afford to fall behind in this critical area of warfare, lest we cede control the sky to our foes, a terrifying prospect for sure."
 CAN_airspace_defense: "The Night Watchmen"
 CAN_airspace_defense_desc: "A proposal has been put forward by the NRC to construct a prototype radar warning system, code-name 'Night Watchmen'. In addition to its immediate strategic utility, this programme would provide enormous benefit to further research into RADAR technology and integration into air doctrine."
 CAN_imperial_air_training_plan: "Imperial Air Training Plan"
 CAN_imperial_air_training_plan_desc: "No matter how well designed, an aeroplane is ultimately only as good as its pilot. A large and dedicated training programme will help ensure we have a healthy supply, and its extension to other members of the Entente will allow us to pool knowledge and help our allies reach our level of greatness."
 CAN_royal_atlantic_aero_corp: "Establish the RAAC"
 CAN_royal_atlantic_aero_corp_desc: "Aviation industry leaders have put forward a proposal to form a new corporation to establish regular air links between Canada and the West Indies Federation. Such air links will not only bring the two countries closer together, but also spark aeronautics research and development."
 CAN_transcanada_airlines: "Trans Canada Airlines"
 CAN_transcanada_airlines_desc: "Founding a national airline company capable of linking the entirety of Canada by air is no small task. But as a simple airfield is all you need to link two cities together, this allows us to bypass the need for titanic infrastructure works. The skills and techniques we learn could also apply well to general air doctrines."
 CAN_cfb_gander: "Expand RCAF Gander"
 CAN_cfb_gander_desc: "The air force base in Gander - an otherwise unremarkable port town in northern Labrador - is our key to controlling the skies over our Northeastern coast, as well as an excellent transitioning point for aircraft flying across the Atlantic. We will need to work hard to get it built up to where the airfield will be useful."
 CAN_cfb_north_bay: "Expand RCAF North Bay"
 CAN_cfb_north_bay_desc: "The North Bay air force base, not far to the north of both Toronto and Ottawa, is one of our most vital. In its range it covers over half of Canada's population and its most vital industrial centres. It is also the RCAF's most important training locale. We must ensure it is kept in top condition."

 CAN_jet_propulsion: "Jet Propulsion Initiative"
 CAN_jet_propulsion_desc: "Although an expensive and immature technology, turbojet aircraft could revolutionise aerial warfare. Let us found Turbo Research Inc. as a crown corporation to pursue this technology with all vigour. If our theorists are right, the speeds this aircraft could achieve would be beyond our comprehension."
 CAN_chalk_river_labs: "Chalk River Labs"
 CAN_chalk_river_labs_desc: "Atomic technology has enormous potential to transform industry and warfare. Establishing a laboratory to develop these technologies will help ensure we maintain a competitive edge in this field. We might even achieve breakthroughs in atomic energy generation, or as some scientists suggest, discover the basics of an atomic weapon."

 CAN_overhaul_navy: "Overhaul the Navy"
 CAN_overhaul_navy_desc: "The largest remnant of the Royal Navy sits in Halifax Harbour now, slowly ageing and still under the command of the British Admiralty-in-exile. It has remained separate from the Canadian chain of command, but this cannot continue. The Canadian and British navies need to act as one."
 CAN_state_of_british_fleet: "State of the British Fleet"
 CAN_state_of_british_fleet_desc: "If Canada is to defend itself, much less reclaim the Home Isles, it must first develop a first-rate navy. Fortunately, the legacy of the once-great Royal Navy provides a perfect foundation, and restarting from scratch allows us to get the most up-to-date navy possible."
 CAN_cfb_halifax: "Expand HMC Halifax"
 CAN_cfb_halifax_desc: "Halifax Harbour is one the best ports in the entire world, and it serves as our access point to the Atlantic and Europe. It has been stretched thin by needing to house the Royal Navy-in-exile for the last decade, and the time has come to expand it and prepare for even more ships to be serviced here."
 CAN_cfb_esquimalt: "Expand HMC Esquimalt"
 CAN_cfb_esquimalt_desc: "Our naval base on the far side of Vancouver Island gives us a gateway to the Pacific. We cannot become so entrenched in our belief that the only war that will ever come to Canada will be from the East. We must prepare to defend our western coast as well."
 CAN_deal_with_admiralty: "Deal with the Admiralty"
 CAN_deal_with_admiralty_desc: "The British Exile admirals have a great deal to teach the Canadian navy. We must take advantage of their presence, and try to heal the rivalry which has grown between the two services."
 CAN_davie_shipbuilding: "Davie Shipbuilding Deal"
 CAN_davie_shipbuilding_desc: "Canada's naval production capacity is barely adequate to maintain the former Royal Fleet, much less expand it back to its previous glory. A national programme of intensive shipyard expansion will be necessary to achieve naval supremacy once again and ensure our efforts do not go to waste."
 CAN_naval_bomber_programme: "Naval Bomber Programme"
 CAN_naval_bomber_programme_desc: "The FAA was founded soon after the Great War as the aviation arm of the Royal Navy, and its officers advocate for a new theory of naval warfare built around the aircraft carrier as the primary weapon of the fleet. Naval Bombers can threaten any fleet, and planes are starting to become a fearsome weapon of war."
 CAN_new_officers: "New Naval Officers"
 CAN_new_officers_desc: "While the officers of the British Royal Navy have much to teach us, they also have much to learn. Naval warfare is changing rapidly, and the time has come to update our methods and bring new blood into the admiralty."
 CAN_upgrade_fleet: "Upgrade the Fleet"
 CAN_upgrade_fleet_desc: "Building new ships will be a problem for Canada's small shipbuilding industry. Thus we must concentrate on upgrading those we have, researching new parts and guns and learning how to quickly fit them to the hulls."
 CAN_canadian_destroyers: "Canadian Small Ships"
 CAN_canadian_destroyers_desc: "Our fleet of destroyers and submarines is the backbone of the navy, and the most likely candidates to have replacements built here at home. We should maintain the top level of technology for them that we possibly can."
 CAN_canadian_cruisers: "Canadian Cruisers"
 CAN_canadian_cruisers_desc: "Cruisers are the mid-level ships, and once the Royal Navy returns home they will be the largest ships we're likely to build and maintain."
 CAN_canadian_carriers: "Canadian Carriers"
 CAN_canadian_carriers_desc: "The aircraft carrier has proven itself the supreme weapon of the seas. It is critical that we maintain research and design efforts to maintain this supremacy, and consider massively expanding our fleet of carriers to ensure that our planes reach every corner of the world."
 CAN_canadian_battleships: "Canadian Battleships"
 CAN_canadian_battleships_desc: "We must make a concerted effort to stay on the forefront of battleship design. Our naval engineers have a few proposals that deserve exploration, and we should also consider implementing new modules to account for recent technological advances, like RADAR and radio stations, or heavy AA guns."
 CAN_focus_on_rcn: "Focus on the RCN"
 CAN_focus_on_rcn_desc: "Of the three divisions of our military, the navy is the one which requires our greatest attention. If we control the seas, then we control trade, and we can prevent invasions from being launched against our shores."

 CAN_address_army: "Address the Army"
 CAN_address_army_desc: "The current Canadian army is a strange mix of a national militia surrounding a core of exiled British professionals. With war looming on the horizon, it is time to reorganise the Canadian Army into a unified fighting force, taking inspiration from the legacy of the grand British Army and her achievements in the Great War."
 CAN_preparations_for_war: "Preparations for War"
 CAN_preparations_for_war_desc: "We have waited more than a decade for a second chance at taking on the syndicalist traitors. The time has come to seriously consider what we need to do, what we need to sacrifice, in order to achieve that goal."
 CAN_rally_exiles: "Rally the Exiles"
 CAN_rally_exiles_desc: "There are over half a million British Exiles currently living in Canada. We must rally them and get every able-bodied Brit into the army at once - it's their home we're fighting for, and if they want their children and grandchildren to grow up in the United Kingdom then they need to act now!"
 CAN_within_arms_reach: "Within Arm's Reach"
 CAN_within_arms_reach_desc: "Our biggest obstacle to retaking the Home Isles, aside from the opposition of the syndicalists themselves, is the vast distance across the Atlantic we need to cross. We either need to increase our reach or investigate places closer to Britain from which to stage our invasion."
 CAN_project_plough: "Project Plough"
 CAN_project_plough_desc: "If we are to perform an invasion, we need access not only to superior landing craft but also a division of Royal Marines who will be able to stand at the forefront of the assault."
 CAN_special_branch: "Establish the Special Branch"
 CAN_special_branch_desc: "There is another avenue of warfare outside of that on the battlefield: it's been proposed that we establish a Special Branch of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, aided by MI5 veterans living in Canada, and ensure that our counterintelligence efforts are second to none."
 CAN_contact_loyalists: "Contact the Loyalists"
 CAN_contact_loyalists_desc: "Not every supporter of the monarchy was able or willing to flee Britain. There are many back home, just waiting for the chance to take up arms for our cause... or, perhaps more usefully, to pass us information on the syndicalist plans and placements."
 CAN_letson_plan: "The Letson Plan"
 CAN_letson_plan_desc: "With his career in Engineering between the wars, HFG Letson believes the static trench warfare that typified the Great War has been rendered obsolete by modern technology. Letson proposes instead an emphasis on fast, highly mobile warfare in which tanks and motorised infantry perform breakthroughs and envelop the enemy line."
 CAN_infantry_motorization: "Infantry Motorisation"
 CAN_infantry_motorization_desc: "Automobile technology has come a long way since the Great War. By harnessing the opportunity of mass produced vehicles, we can field whole divisions capable of deploying rapidly and supporting fast armoured advances. Speed on foot is no longer a limiting factor in warfare, horsepower now rules."
 CAN_bring_on_valentine: "Bring on the Valentines"
 CAN_bring_on_valentine_desc: "The tank is a fast, relatively lightly armed and armoured vehicle designed to exploit breakthroughs in the enemy line and achieve rapid advances and encirclement. In a way, it is the spiritual successor of the cavalry charge, which certainly seems to appeal to our generals."
 CAN_motor_industry: "Canada's Motor Industry"
 CAN_motor_industry_desc: "Canada has a rapidly growing motor industry in the Toronto and Windsor region of southern Ontario. We need to take advantage of this industrial base and turn it to military use, expanding our output of troop transports and armoured vehicles."
 CAN_vanier_plan: "The Vanier Plan"
 CAN_vanier_plan_desc: "Georges Vanier, a respected commander of the Canadian Corps during the Great War, proposes a theory of warfare developed from his experiences on the Western Front. His approach emphasises training and equipment quality, so that every man of ours is worth three of theirs."
 CAN_organic_support_elements: "Organic Support Elements"
 CAN_organic_support_elements_desc: "The modern industrialised army is increasingly in need of specialised support elements, like engineers and scouts, to achieve the best results in the field. We should focus effort on developing these capabilities, and ensure that they receive the best equipment we can produce."
 CAN_expand_training: "Expand Training Facilities"

 CAN_focus_on_army: "Focus on the Army"
 CAN_focus_on_army_desc: "Of the three divisions of our military, the army is the one which requires our greatest attention. All the guns and the boats in the world mean nothing if we do not have the quality manpower to defend the nation. Our manpower is limited - we need to make it count!"
 CAN_war_propaganda: "War Propaganda"

 CAN_expand_artillery: "Expand Artillery Power"
 CAN_expand_artillery_desc: "On the modern industrial battlefield, artillery is king. This much has been proven extensively in the Great War, and the guns of the interwar only get larger and scarier by the minute. We must modernise our artillery armaments if we hope to stand against our foes."
 CAN_new_munitions_plants: "New Munitions Plants"
 CAN_new_munitions_plants_desc: "Our economic revival can now turn towards increasing our production of sorely-needed munitions. Our soldiers need guns and bullets both, and lots of them!"
 CAN_foreign_contractors: "Foreign Contractors"
 CAN_foreign_contractors_desc: "Canada only has so much of an industrial base to work with. If we are going to push it beyond its limits, we'll need to coordinate with military suppliers elsewhere in the Entente."
 CAN_self_propelled_guns: "Self-Propelled Guns"
 CAN_self_propelled_guns_desc: "A mobile army requires mobile fire support. By mounting an artillery weapon on the same platforms as tanks we can economically provide a full range of capabilities to our mechanised divisions and provide the kind of on-point fire support that will seal the deal on most armoured pushes."
 CAN_munitions_industry: "Canada's Munitions Industry"
 CAN_munitions_industry_desc: "Our munitions industry still has room to grow. A series of economic incentives should prove interesting to investors, and get those factories producing like never before."

 CAN_intervention_debate: "The Intervention Debate"
 CAN_intervention_debate_desc: "The possibility has been raised in the House of Commons that we should recognise one of the competing factions in the American civil war, and offer them support in the form of volunteers and guns. It will be sure to upset the others, but to stand by and do nothing seems like it could court disaster."
 CAN_eyes_to_the_south: "Eyes to the South"

 CAN_crossing_the_border: "Crossing the Border"
 CAN_crossing_the_border_desc: "The time has come. We must prepare to cross the southern border and wade into the mess that America has become.

 CAN_new_home_of_the_free: "New Home of the Free"
 CAN_new_home_of_the_free_desc: "What an odd turn of events that it is Canada who now leads North America as the 'Home of the Free'.

 CAN_canadian_referendum: "The Canadian Referendum"
 CAN_canadian_referendum_desc: "Many within Canada feel that the British Exiles abused their stay in our country - too many, in fact. Enough that a national referendum has been called for, to decide whether Canada should remain a Dominion and part of the Empire, or whether it should cut ties and chart a new course for itself, as America once did."
 CAN_canadian_constitution: "A Canadian Constitution"
 CAN_canadian_constitution_desc: "The British North America Act is currently under the jurisdiction of the British Parliament. While it is primarily a symbolic act, patriating it and bringing the Constitution to Canada will formally end our connection to the British and our colonial past."

 CAN_KR_gathering_storm_desc: "After the Revolution of 1925, the Royal Family and other British exiles found refuge in Canada. With the support of the Conservatives, they established a semi-official government in exile, in hopes of one day reclaiming the Home Islands. All is not well, however. Canadians are growing weary of the British presence, and in 1931 the Conservative government fell to Mackenzie King's Liberals - who now hold a slim majority and seek to assert greater Canadian sovereignty in the face of mounting pressure to prepare for the inevitable confrontation between the Entente and the Third Internationale."

### Intro Screen ###
 CAN_country_intro_header: "The Current Situation"
 CAN_country_intro_content: "It has been eleven years since the collapse of the United Kingdom in 1925 and, in that time, the king, the remnants of the British government, and over half a million of the Empire's best and brightest (and wealthiest) have fled to Canada... with the clear expectation that an invasion would soon be launched to take back the Home Isles from the syndicalist upstarts.\n\nIt quickly became evident, however, that the syndicalist position was stronger than anticipated. Early forays were rebuked, and the last decade has seen the Union of Britain become solidified and entrenched. The Exiles, as they're called in Canada, have meanwhile been left adrift, determined to take back their homeland but facing the political reality that this may never happen."

 CAN_country_intro_content_1: "While initially welcomed with open arms by Canadians, the notion this might be a long-term arrangement has been an increasingly unpleasant one. Fingers were pointed and blame laid on those who were deemed responsible for the collapse and the subsequent inability to rectify matters, and resentment against Exiles who were seen as 'a higher class' in the Dominion as well as above the law has been growing.\n\nIn 1931, a year after their election, the minority government of R.B. Bennett and his Conservatives collapsed, to be replaced by Mackenzie King and the Liberals with a promised focus on Canadian sovereignty and keeping the British government-in-exile at arm's length rather than acting as if nothing had changed in the relationship."

 CAN_country_intro_content_2: "This year, Mackenzie King and the Liberals are nearing the end of their term and, on top of the tribulations of the Great Depression, there is growing criticism that little progress has been made in resolving the political situation.\n\nGeorge V lies on his deathbed, charging the Exiles and the Conservatives with bringing the Empire 'back on track'. His government clashes often with the Liberals, and the Canadian public appears split between those who would see matters come to a head and those who would prefer to abandon their ties to the crown and the French exiles in Africa both.

 canada.4.t: "Death of King George V"
 canada.4.d: "In the last several months, King George has been plagued by illness and his health has been failing. This fact has been kept from the public, to keep up appearances while treatments were attempted, but it seems all was for naught. At 11.55 p.m. yesterday, the king died following a bout of severe fever. His eldest son and heir apparent, Prince Edward, has inherited the throne as Edward VIII and is expected to address the nation within the month. An official coronation will take place in several month's time, after an official mourning period for King George has been observed."
 canada.4.a: "The Empire enters a state of mourning..."

 canada.5.t: "The Coronation of King Edward"
 canada.5.d: "King Edward VIII is the first British monarch not to be coronated within the halls of Westminster Abbey. Instead, royal planners held an elaborate ceremony in Christ Church Cathedral, Ottawa's largest Anglican church. There the Archbishop of Canterbury, himself a British exile, performed the rites as expected by tradition, with a throng of media paying close attention to every move. Rather than making his first public appearance afterwards on the balcony of Buckingham Palace, King Edward instead appeared on the balcony of Rideau Hall, the official royal residence, where he was greeted by a throng of enthusiastic Canadians."
 canada.5.a: "It's official!"

 canada.6.t: "The King's First Address"
 canada.6.d: "As King Edward prepares his first radio address to the Empire, he must consider what his message will be. His Privy Council is, of course, urging him to promote the cause of retaking the Home Isles. R.B. Bennett, the leader of the Conservative Party and the Official Opposition, suggests that he use his platform to endorse them for the upcoming election, saying that will serve the cause of war far better. Others, meanwhile, suggest that supporting the current Prime Minister and government will go a long way to mending fences and maintaining stability... though it could also be seen as a tacit endorsement of the Liberal Party's position."
 canada.6.a: "He will prepare the nation for war."
 canada.6.b: "He will endorse the Conservatives."
 canada.6.c: "He will support the Canadian government."

 canada.7.t.war: "King Edward Calls for War"
 canada.7.t.cons: "King Edward Endorses Bennett"
 canada.7.t.gov: "King Edward Supports the Government"
 canada.7.d.war: "In his radio address, the king has spoken to the nation and has electrified it. From Vancouver to St. John's, from Toronto to the Arctic, Canadians everywhere buzz with excitement after hearing a charismatic and forceful speech denouncing syndicalism and the king's pledge to finish the war that his father began and finally reclaim Britain. His message was received as a tacit endorsement of the British Exiles in Canada, and a clear call to begin preparations for war... despite the current Liberal government's more tentative policy on the matter."
 canada.7.d.cons: "In his radio address, the king has spoken to the nation and has electrified it. From Vancouver to St. John's, from Toronto to the Arctic, Canadians everywhere buzz with excitement after hearing a charismatic and forceful speech celebrating Canadian democracy. In it, King Edward specifically called out the long service of R.B. Bennett and the Conservative Party, and suggested Canadians - and indeed the entire Entente - would be well-served to have them leading the country into the next war. Bennett, in turn, publicly thanked the king and called on all his fellow Canadians to look on this as the turning a new page and a chance to follow a young and vital king to victory at last."
 canada.7.d.gov: "In his radio address, the King has spoken to the nation and has electrified it. From Vancouver to St. John's, from Toronto to the Arctic, Canadians everywhere buzz with excitement after hearing a charismatic and forceful speech celebrating Canadian progress and potential. In it, King Edward unexpectedly complimented Prime Minister Mackenzie King and the work of his government, and told Canadians that now, more than ever, they needed to band together in their common cause against the enemies that would threaten them all."
 canada.7.a: "We must liberate our brothers in Britain!"
 canada.7.b: "This election will be vital for our future!"
 canada.7.c: "The 20th century shall be Canada's Century!"

 canada.8.t: "Status of the Privy Council"
 canada.8.d: "The British government-in-exile has operated on emergency powers for the last ten years, existing without elections and unable to exercise legal influence outside of their status as the king's Privy Council. Recently, however, there have been indications that Prime Minister Austen Chamberlain's time is up. Many Exiles see him as partly responsible for the loss of the Home Isles, and have been urging King Edward to replace him. We could push the king to appoint a more moderate candidate, however - someone more likely to work with the Canadian government. We could also urge the king to call for an election among the Exiles in Canada, though how much of a legal mandate that would give the new Prime Minister is questionable. Still, it's more democratic than an appointee."
 canada.8.a: "Let the king pick Chamberlain's replacement"
 canada.8.b: "We should push for a moderate candidate"
 canada.8.c: "A vote by the Exiles should be organised"

 canada.9.t: "Fate of the Senate"
 canada.9.d: "Since the arrival of the Exiles to Canada, King George V appointed many of their numbers to the Canadian Senate - mainly as rewards for 'valiant service to the defence of the Empire'. Since King Edward's ascension, the appointments of Exiles has continued... to the point where the Senate is often referred to as 'the Canadian House of Lords'. Many members of the government are saying the time has come to insist on Senate Reform, passing a law requiring Senatorial appointments be confirmed by the House of Commons. Considering the Senate has the power to reject bills, this could result in a showdown with the king... unless he decides that it is better not to anger the government of his host country while in exile."
 canada.9.a: "We need reform at once!"
 canada.9.b: "Urge the king to appoint more Canadians"
 canada.9.c: "It's the king's prerogative to choose as he wishes"

 canada.10.t: "Senate Reform Bill Vetoed"
 canada.10.d: "Urged by [CAN_king_first_name] to do so, the Senate has vetoed the reform bill sent to them by the House of Commons, thus starting a showdown of words as the two houses argue over the bill's wording and implementation. The king's stance appears to be that 'in these troubling times' he cannot relinquish his royal prerogatives... so that likely means no reform will be possible. The king's actions have not endeared him with the Canadian public, however, as newspapers across the country have painted the king's actions as contemptuous of Canadian sovereignty and democracy."
 canada.10.a: "Well, we tried"

 canada.11.t: "Senate Reform Bill Passes"
 canada.11.d: "The Senate has begrudgingly passed the reform bill sent to them by the House of Commons, with [CAN_king_first_name] reportedly having no comment on the matter. It is clear that Prime Minister [GetBritishExilePM], head of the British Exiles in Canada, advised the king that a confrontation with the Canadian government at this time would prove imprudent. The first vote in the House of Commons on the next Senate appointee is due within weeks, and the entire country is eagerly anticipating the first Canadian-born appointee in over a decade."
 canada.11.a: "Excellent"

 canada.12.t: "Chief of the RCN"
 canada.12.d: "A heated discussion has occurred within the Canadian government regarding who to formally appoint as the head of the RCN. Until now, the British fleet-in-exile has operated more or less independently of the Canadian chain of command, but everyone agrees this cannot continue. The British Exiles are adamant on putting Sir Roger Backhouse in the fleet, since they say it IS their fleet. Ministers suggest Canadian admiral Percy Nelles is more the man for the job, and will do a better job of coordinating the two forces."
 canada.12.a: "Nelles should have the job"
 canada.12.b: "Sir Backhouse will look after the British fleet best"

 canada.13.t: "Chief of the Army"
 canada.13.d: "The time has come to select the man who will lead both the British and Canadian forces to victory on the ground. [CAN_king_first_name] and Prime Minister [GetBritishExilePM] have put forward HFG Letson, convinced his ideas on mechanising the military is exactly the kind of ideas we need. The Canadian Prime Minister however dissents on this, stating that Georges Vanier's ideas on an elite and well-trained force is best for a Canadian Army. Both men are highly qualified and neither is a bad choice, but a choice must be made."
 canada.13.a: "Georges Vanier is the Canadian we need"
 canada.13.b: "Harry Letson is the man for the job"

 canada.14.t: "The Chief of Staff"
 canada.14.d: "With the war against the syndicalists now upon us, [CAN_king_first_name] is pressuring the Prime Minister to make a choice as to who will lead the Canadian forces overall. We must choose wisely. The British commanders are skilled, and will please the king as he wants to see one of his own in charge of the invasion. The Canadian commanders, however, will be far more popular back home."
 canada.14.a: "Ironside is still our man for the job!"
 canada.14.b: "Montgomery-Massingberd will get us to London!"
 canada.14.c: "Harry Crerar is our new commander!"
 canada.14.e: "Kenneth Stuart is the man for Canada!"

 canada.20.t: "The [GetYear] Stanley Cup"
 canada.20.d: "Two teams have made it into the [GetYear] Stanley Cup Finals: the Toronto Maple Leafs, making their sixth appearance, and the Detroit Red Wings, making their second appearance and still hungry to win their first cup. With only a brief interruption at the first game in Detroit, with demonstrations by the Socialist Party of America disrupting proceedings outside the stadium, the series has gone off without a hitch and captivated audiences in both countries. Who will take home the cup this year?"
 canada.20.a: "Come on, Toronto!"
 canada.20.b: "Come on, Detroit!"

 canada.21.t: "Detroit Wins the Stanley Cup"
 canada.21.d: "The Detroit Red Wings have swept the Toronto Maple Leafs for the Stanley Cup, giving the Red Wings the Stanley Cup for the first time. The games were held during a time of great unrest but, for a day, the people weren't rioting over political differences, they were rioting over the championship."
 canada.21.a: "A worthy effort, Toronto"
 canada.21.b: "Stanley is back in Hockeytown! Woo Hoo!"

 canada.22.t: "Toronto Wins the Stanley Cup"
 canada.22.d: "Toronto has vanquished Detroit in a four-game series for the Stanley Cup, bringing the Canadian team their fourth victory in the finals. Once again, the Kid Line of Charlie Conacher, Harvey 'Busher' Jackson, and Joe Primeau has brought the Stanley Cup to Toronto!"
 canada.22.a: "O Canada! Our home and native land!"
 canada.22.b: "We'll win next year!"

 canada.23.t: "Black Monday Hits Canada"
 canada.23.d: "Just when we thought we were almost through the doldrums of the Great Depression, the German economic markets have experienced a massive crash which has come to be dubbed 'Black Monday'. While the Canadian economy isn't as tied to the German markets as some, the ripples have been felt throughout the world... particularly in the United States, a market we are particularly dependent upon. This setback is difficult to take, though Prime Minister King has assured the country, 'We will make it through this, just as we have the dark years prior! Now is the time for us to join together and work as we never have before!'"
 canada.23.a: "More troubles? Bah!"

 canada.24.t: "Writ of Election Issued"
 canada.24.d: "The House of Commons has issued the writ of election, calling for general elections to be held in October of this year. Both the Liberals and the Conservatives have already begun campaigning, and the general sentiment is that this election will be an important one - does the country push hard towards a confrontation with the Union of Britain, or does it take a more cautious approach and focus on building up Canada's strength and that of the other Dominions? The Liberals favour the latter, while the Conservatives and the British Exiles heavily favour the former."
 canada.24.a: "May the best party win!"

 canada.25.t: "Bennett Accuses Liberals of Inaction"
 canada.25.d: "With the effects of Black Monday still being felt in Canada, R.B. Bennett has taken the offensive and accused Mackenzie King and the Liberals of gross inaction - not only on the economic management of the country, but on what he suggests is an 'inevitable war that will determine the fate not only of Canada but the entire world'. Canada, he says, should be pushing hard for the coming war, and suggests that if it fails to do so 'the Entente shall be caught once again in a weak and indefensible position'. Considering the large crowd he attracted at his latest speech in Halifax, there are a large number of Canadians who agree with him."
 canada.25.a: "Is that so?"

 canada.26.t: "CCF Appeals to the Unemployed"
 canada.26.d: "The recently-formed Cooperative Commonwealth Federation party, led by J.S. Woodsworth, has been making large gains in the polls as Woodsworth speaks to groups of unemployed labourers and factory workers across the country. The party's democratic socialist platform has resulted in accusations of it being funded and run by syndicalist sympathisers, but its message of alleviating the suffering of farmers and workers under capitalism has hit a chord even so. Regardless, its popularity seems most concentrated in Western Canada, and the idea it might have a chance at forming a government is remote."
 canada.26.a: "Democratic socialism? In the True North?"

 canada.27.t: "The Conscription Debate Begins"
 canada.27.d: "As expected, the most contentious issue in the election is proving to be that of conscription. Both the Liberals and Conservatives have proposed a bill that has become known as C-7, which would shape our preparations for war over the coming years. Whether Bill C-7 includes conscription, however, is the key element. French-Canadians in Québec are, in particular, vehemently opposed to the idea of general conscription forcing them to fight in a 'British war', and thus Liberal promises of not implementing it have seen them make great gains in that province. Conservatives, meanwhile, say that Canada doesn't have the manpower to fight any war without conscription. The war, when it comes, means conscription sooner or later - and they say, for all our sakes, it should be sooner."
 canada.27.a: "This could get ugly"

 canada.28.t: "Demonstration at King Speech"
 canada.28.d: "A campaign stop by Mackenzie King in Toronto was marred today when it was met by a large demonstration organised by the Orange Order of Canada. The Order, which celebrates Canadian ties with the British Empire and has been campaigning strenuously for greater action against the Union of Britain, has declared the Liberal 'no conscription' position as an outrage that threatens the very survival of the Empire. The raucous chanting and shouting prevented King from continuing the speech, and altercations between Liberal supporters and the Orange Order almost ended up in a riot before the police were finally called in to intervene."
 canada.28.a: "They shouldn't have been there"
 canada.28.b: "They were unfairly provoked"

 canada.29.t: "Duplessis Wins Québec Election"
 canada.29.d: "Coming off a campaign based on Québecois dissatisfaction with the economic downturn and the threat of national conscription, Maurice Duplessis and the Union Nationale have won a majority government in the Québec provincial elections. Duplessis has sworn to fight any plan to enact conscription, and there are even threats of calling for a referendum on the future of Québec in Confederation should that happen. This is a clear sign of just how serious the divisions between English Canadians and French Canadians have become, now that the split of opinion on Canada's role in the coming war is so sharp."
 canada.29.a: "This is not good"

 canada.30.t: "March Against Conscription"
 canada.30.d: "A giant march against Bill C-7 and the prospect of national conscription has taken place in both Montreal and Québec City, with smaller marches taking place in Ottawa and Vancouver. Opposition to conscription is beginning to hit a head, with many of the signs in the marches declaring 'Exiles Get Out!' and 'No War For Canada!' in either English or French. Members of the Conservative party have openly suggested the marches are being organised by the Union of Britain in order to destabilise the Entente, but Mackenzie King and the Liberals have treated them seriously and doubled-down on the party's opposition to widespread conscription."
 canada.30.a: "Goodness!"

 canada.31.t: "Bennett Assaults Reporter"
 canada.31.d: "At a campaign stop in Hamilton, R.B. Bennett was aggressively questioned by a French-Canadian reporter over the Conservative plans for conscription, outright implying that the Conservatives intended to send French Canadians into the front lines in order to eliminate their 'threat to Anglophone domination'. Unsurprisingly, the tempestuous Bennett's response was to attack the man, causing a near-riot that dominated the newspapers for days."
 canada.31.a: "He's willing to fight, and that's a good thing!"
 canada.31.b: "Bennett is an embarrassment"

 canada.32.t: "Rise of the Nationalist Party"
 canada.32.d: "The main competition for the Liberals among those opposed to conscription appears to have become the Nationalist Party of Canada, led by Henry Herbert Stevens. The Nationalist Party's platform began as republican and anti-monarchist, but has evolved into a stance which would see Canada pulled out of the Entente entirely. Stevens is expected to win in his British Columbia riding, but so far has been unable to gain traction in Québec where the party could do more than eat at the Liberal domination there."
 canada.32.a: "Interesting"

 canada.33.t: "King Edward Comments on War"
 canada.33.d: "King Edward recently made the rounds in Canadian newspapers, commenting on the war with [war_country.GetNameDef] and saying, 'This won't be the end of it. The world order established after the end of the Great War is now falling apart, and the Empire must be ready. We cannot put our heads in the ground and wish things were other than they are, for one way or another the wars overseas will come to our shores.' The king's comments were seen as tacit support for R.B. Bennett and the Conservatives, and many Canadians are reluctantly agreeing."
 canada.33.a: "I see."

 canada.34.t: "Complaints over Labour Camp Conditions"
 canada.34.d: "The economic relief camps set up by the government have been the source of considerable criticism as of late, mainly due to the low rate of pay received by the workers as well as their living conditions. The unemployed men working in the camps say that they cannot earn enough money to return to their former lives and get regular jobs, forcing them to remain in the camps indefinitely. Anger has been rising, and there are demands for the government to do something about it."
 canada.34.a: "It's time to shut down the camps"
 canada.34.b: "Improve the camp conditions"
 canada.34.c: "These men should be grateful they have work at all!"

 canada.35.t: "The March on Ottawa"
 canada.35.d: "Complaints over the pay and conditions at Canada's economic relief camps has continued. Now, the camp workers have organised a 'March on Ottawa', with many of them reaching the capital by jumping on top of trains! The large group assembled and demanded to speak to the Minister of Labour and the Prime Minister, presenting a list of demands. Public sympathy for the workers has been high, with many newspapers publishing photos of the deplorable camp conditions they work in."
 canada.35.a: "Fine, fine, we'll shut down the camps"
 canada.35.b: "We'll improve conditions at the camps"

 canada.36.t: "Unemployment Insurance Proposed"
 canada.36.d.camps: "With complaints continuing over conditions at the labour camps, a new law has been proposed by CCF members within the House of Commons: namely that unemployment 'insurance' would replace the relief camps entirely. Workers and employers would pay into the system, and the unemployed would draw from the insurance to tide them over until a new job was found. It's an expensive solution, but one that has drawn considerable praise and support."
 canada.36.d.nocamps: "The labour camps have been shut down, but the essential problem of the unemployed remains... and now a new law has been proposed by CCF members within the House of Commons: namely that unemployment 'insurance' would replace the need for the camps entirely. Workers and employers would pay into the system, and the unemployed would draw from the insurance to tide them over until a new job was found. It's an expensive solution, but one that has drawn considerable praise and support."
 canada.36.a: "Pass the law"
 canada.36.b: "Just get rid of the camps"
 canada.36.c: "We are fine with the system the way it is"

 canada.37.t: "Anti-Syndicalism on the Imperial Broadcasting Service"
 canada.37.d: "The Imperial Broadcasting Service was founded by Sir John Reith in 1925 after the British Revolution when his previous broadcasting organisation, the British Broadcasting Corporation, was taken over by the syndicalists. The service proved invaluable in promoting loyalty throughout the British Empire, and also as a tool to marginalise syndicalism within our borders. There have been calls to install Reith as the head of the new Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, in order to begin a propaganda campaign against more moderate socialists in the country. Others have suggested using Reith to employ propaganda with a more external focus, to prepare our people for the coming fight against syndicalism."
 canada.37.a: "The CBC is fine as it is"
 canada.37.b: "Put Reith in charge of the CBC"
 canada.37.c: "Put Reith in charge, so long as he focuses attention on our foes abroad"

 canada.38.t: "Billy Bishop Criticises Priorities"
 canada.38.d: "Billy Bishop, our Air Marshal and a long-standing air force hero, has criticised the government's military spending priorities. The coming war, he says, will be decided in the air... and if [Root.GetNameDef] is to be ready for it, that will mean more money and manpower be spent on modernising the air force. He has a detailed plan, and it seems like it could work, but this will take resources from other projects."
 canada.38.a: "Bishop is a good man and I trust his methods"
 canada.38.b: "The air force will get no more of a priority"

 canada.39.t: "Naval Exercises in the Atlantic"
 canada.39.d: "With the international situation deteriorating, it is imperative we demonstrate our strength and exercise our right to free passage in the Atlantic. To this end, the Admiralty have scheduled an extensive array of fleet manoeuvres and war-games in the North Atlantic. We can play it safe, but the Admiralty seems to believe we could also challenge a navy of roughly equal measure to a bit of a game... if they're up for the challenge. Doing so would be risky, but the experience for our navy would be much greater."
 canada.39.a: "Conduct a large exercise off the coast of Britain and Ireland"
 canada.39.b: "Conduct a large exercise in the North Sea"
 canada.39.c: "Conduct a large exercise off the American Coast"
 canada.39.e: "Conduct normal exercises in Canadian territorial waters"

 canada.40.t: "A Challenge from the Canadian Navy?"
 canada.40.d: "A large flotilla of ships ranging dangerously close to our territorial waters has been identified as Canadian. We can't be certain, but they appear to be testing our responses... challenging us, in other words. We could send out our fleet to rattle our sabres in a game of manoeuvres, but we are taken a bit by surprise. If we lose, it will be embarrassing for us, though perhaps not as much if we don't act at all."
 canada.40.a: "They want to play? We'll play!"
 canada.40.b: "Ignore them - they're just Canadians"

 canada.41.t: "Naval Manoeuvres Lost"
 canada.41.can: "We challenged the [From.GetAdjective] navy... and it seems we lost. They ran circles around us, and made our experienced captains look like fools until we were forced to retreat."
 canada.41.oth: "We challenged the Canadian navy... and we lost. They were prepared for us to show ourselves, and then playing a game of hide-and-seek in the waters while they made us look like fools."
 canada.41.a: "How embarrassing"

 canada.42.t: "Naval Manoeuvres Won"
 canada.42.can: "We challenged the [From.GetAdjective] navy... and won the day, naturally. Our experienced captains ran circles around the [From.GetAdjective] ships and made them look like fools."
 canada.42.oth: "We challenged the Canadian ships... and, despite their preparation, we won the day. Our more experienced captains ran circles around their fleet and sent them limping back to their own waters, like fools."
 canada.42.a: "Hurrah!"
 canada.42.b: "What, not even an 'I'm sorry'?"

 canada.50.t: "Federal Election of [GetYear]"
 canada.50.d: "The moment has come, with the country heading to the polls to decide between the Liberals under William Lyon Mackenzie King and the Conservatives under R.B. Bennett. Either way, it is certain the election will be close, and should there be a prospect of a minority government it seems likely the role of kingmaker would be given to the Cooperative Commonwealth Federation, who have already declared they would support a Liberal government if it came down to that."

With the Conservative party's slim hold on power, passing the bill might prove challenging... and with a defeated bill comes a fallen government, so passing the bill is of extreme importance. Prime Minister Bennett might have to consider compromising with the Loyal Opposition, though not so much that he angers his own allies."

 canada.53.t: "Bill C-7: National Conscription"
 canada.53.d: "Perhaps the most important issue covered by the bill is that of conscription. The Conservative government has avowed that it intends to employ extensive conscription across the country. There are those in the party, however, who have expressed grave concern over the reaction from French Canadians, and have suggested that a more limited form of conscription - while still objectionable to the French - would at least not stir up violence and might actually get some support from the Liberals on the bill."
 canada.53.a: "We said full conscription, so it's full"
 canada.53.b: "Perhaps a more limited conscription would be better"

 canada.54.t: "Bill C-7: National Conscription"
 canada.54.d: "Perhaps the most important issue covered by the bill is that of conscription. The Liberal government has promised French Canadians that it will not enact conscription at all, but there are those within the party who agree with the Conservatives in that Canada's manpower reserves are already dismally low. Changing our minds might get some agreement from the Conservatives on the bill... though it would almost certainly come at the cost of accusations of betrayal and perhaps even some defections from the Liberal side of the House of Commons."

The party is in coalition with the Liberal government, and has vowed to oppose the bill when it comes to a vote. The Liberals will have to work extra hard to get Conservatives on board instead, and turn the bill into a bi-partisan measure."
 canada.55.d.limnoccf: "While the suggestion of limited conscription is seem by many as a compromise, more progressive members of the party are suggesting it is an outright betrayal and have vowed to oppose the bill when it comes to a vote.

Prime Minister Mackenzie King will have to work extra hard to get Conservatives on board instead, and turn the bill into a bi-partisan measure."

Many of them have called this an utter betrayal by the party elite, and vowed to oppose the bill when it comes to a vote. Prime Minister Mackenzie King will have to work extra hard to get Conservatives on board instead, and turn the bill into a bi-partisan measure."
 canada.55.a: "So be it!"

 canada.56.t: "Bill C-7: the Future of Canada's Industry"
 canada.56.d: "Recovery from the Great Depression has left Canada's industry in a deplorable state, and the government insists that the nation needs to industrialise at an incredibly rapid rate if it hopes to challenge the Union of Britain's power. The Liberal plan, put forward by C.D. Howe, suggests that Canada should focus on funding urban infrastructure and the civilian economy - those, combined with incentives, should bring the needed military investment in the long run. The Conservative plan is to nationalise the needed armament and naval industries now, and build them up with government funding even if the rest of Canada's industrial base lags behind."
 canada.56.a: "C.D. Howe is a cabinet minister for a reason"
 canada.56.b: "We need armaments now, not later"
 canada.56.c: "Perhaps a compromise between the two plans, then"

 canada.57.t: "Bill C-7: Domestic Security"
 canada.57.d: "Canada has been able to avoid the bitter class war that engulfed Britain after the Great War, but conflict between Canadians and the British Exiles is growing, as has syndicalist sentiment among Canada's labour unions. Both the Conservatives and the Liberals have suggested the RCMP be granted sweeping powers to crack down on dissidents, with a minister to act as chairman on a Parliamentary committee to oversee the process. The Conservatives have proposed Maxwell Knight, renowned hardliner and British Exile, be that chairman. The Liberals, meanwhile, have said that Ernest Lapointe would do a better job. He may be more moderate in his views, but as an MP from Québec he is far more in tune with French Canadians."
 canada.57.a: "Knight is exactly the kind of man we need"
 canada.57.b: "Lapointe will get the job done, and fairly"
 canada.57.c: "No secret police! We are all in this together!"

 canada.58.t: "Voting Begins on Bill C-7"
 canada.58.d: "With the debate on Bill C-7 now coming to a close, the House Speaker has begun the roll call for voting to begin. Tensions are high, and a failure by the government here would be catastrophic."
 canada.58.a: "We will know soon enough"

 canada.59.t: "Bill C-7 Passes"
 canada.59.d: "The votes have been tallied, and the Speaker of the House declared that Bill C-7 has passed both within the House of Commons and in the Senate. Not everyone is in favour of the bill's measures, but it seems both sides are eager to get the new laws implemented as soon as possible and see Canada move forward - together."
 canada.59.a: "Hear, hear!"

 canada.60.t: "Violent Demonstrations in Québec"
 canada.60.d.cons: "Even though full conscription has not yet been implemented, the more limited form enacted by the Conservative government has still caused a strong reaction in Québec. Throughout the province, demonstrations have broken out, with signs carried that either call for Québec separation from Canada or death to the 'English king'. While the RCMP has been able to restore order so far, it is not without several of the demonstrations having turned incredibly violent... along with promises that, should full conscription ever be implemented, things will get far worse."
 canada.60.d.lib: "Even though full conscription has not yet been implemented, the more limited form enacted by the Liberal government has still caused a strong reaction in Québec. Throughout the province, demonstrations have broken out, with signs carried that either call for Québec separation from Canada or say 'down with the Liberal betrayers'. While the RCMP has been able to restore order so far, it is not without several of the demonstrations having turned incredibly violent... along with promises that, should full conscription ever be implemented, things will get far worse."
 canada.60.a: "Terrible!"

 canada.61.t: "Bill C-7 Killed in the Senate"
 canada.61.d: "After several readings and amendments, the bill narrowly passed a vote in the House of Commons... though not without considerable grumbling from both sides. It was enough that the Canadian Senate felt justified in vetoing the bill and sending it back to the House, where one final vote on amendments completely failed. Bill C-7 is considered dead in the water, along with the government's mandate."
 canada.61.a: "Oh no!"

 canada.62.t: "The Government Collapses"
 canada.62.d.lib: "The failure of Bill C-7 has led to a vote of no confidence within the House of Commons, and with it the collapse of Mackenzie King's Liberal government. [CAN_king_first_name] has called for a new election to take place in three month's time, a return to the polls which is sure to make Canadians grumble. Moreover, the chaos has been reported in newspapers as putting Canada's chances of being ready for war in real jeopardy."
 canada.62.d.cons: "The failure of Bill C-7 has led to a vote of no confidence within the House of Commons, and with it the collapse of Bennett's Conservative government. [CAN_king_first_name] has called for a new election to take place in three month's time, a return to the polls which is sure to make Canadians grumble.

 canada.63.t: "Manion Replaces Bennett as Conservative Leader"
 canada.63.d.fallen: "With a blessing from [CAN_king_first_name], R.B. Bennett has stepped down as leader of the Conservative Party and been replaced by Ontario MP Robert Manion. This is seen as a direct response to Bennett's failure to pass Bill C-7, with the king confident that Manion can reinvigorate the party for the upcoming election."
 canada.63.d.stepdown: "With a blessing from [CAN_king_first_name], R.B. Bennett has stepped down as Prime Minister and leader of the Conservative Party and been replaced by Ontario MP Robert Manion. Manion is said to be a part of the king's inner circle, and far more likely to align the Conservative Party's interests with those of the British Exiles."
 canada.63.d.challenge: "With a blessing from [CAN_king_first_name], R.B. Bennett has stepped down as leader of the Conservative Party and been replaced by Ontario MP Robert Manion.

 canada.63.d: "With their loss in the last election, it is no surprise that the Conservative Party has turned to new leadership. With the blessing of [CAN_king_first_name], Ontario MP Robert Manion has stepped up and taken the leadership reins of the party from R.B. Bennett."
 canada.63.a: "Let's see if this improves their standing"

 canada.64.t: "The American Civil War"
 canada.64.d: "[CAN_king_first_name] has commented on the outbreak of the civil war in America, saying 'It is clear that the ability for one of the mightiest nations on Earth to fall to syndicalism should come as a wake up call to all Canadians and indeed the entire Empire. The loss of Britain and France was not a chance occurrence, but rather the onset of a wave of tyranny which will sweep the whole world into its wake if we do not stand against it with all our might.'"

 canada.65.t: "Mackenzie King Promises New Deal"
 canada.65.d.lib: "Still smarting from his government's failure to pass Bill C-7, Prime Minister Mackenzie King promised Canadians that their revised version would be a 'new deal' for Canadians across the country. He affirmed that the new bill would have no conscription, no special powers for the RCMP, and stick closely to the Liberal incentive plan for the economy. 'No matter the war that faces us,' he told a crowd in Montreal, 'if Canada is not a free and independent nation then it has already lost.'"
 canada.65.d.cons: "Taking advantage of the loss in Conservative popularity following their failure to pass Bill C-7, Prime Minister Mackenzie King promised that the Liberal bill would be a 'new deal' for Canadians across the country. He affirmed that the new bill would have no conscription, no special powers for the RCMP, and stick closely to the Liberal incentive plan for the economy.

 canada.66.d.cons: "Robert Manion was quick to explain to a crowd of supporters in Toronto that Bill C-8, his replacement for the failed Bill C-7, was precisely what Canada needed - now more than ever. The new bill would enact full conscription, nationalise the country's major arms industries, and set up an RCMP that would 'keep the peace at home'. 'Canada needs to be at the forefront of our alliance, stronger than it ever has been before, and I know that we can do it. Working arm in arm with our British friends and cousins, we can match the syndicalists pound for pound!'"

 canada.67.t: "The Run-off Federal Election"
 canada.67.d: "For the second time, Canadians head to the polls to elect a new government. While there are some fears that the new government will only win a minority of seats, most analysts appear certain that one of the two major parties is likely to come out big - either the government will have its mandate reinforced, or the opposition will come on strong riding on a wave of protest."
 canada.67.a: "The Liberals win a majority"
 canada.67.b: "The Conservatives win a majority"

 canada.68.t: "Liberals Pass 'New Deal' Bill C-7"
 canada.68.d: "With a minimum of debate in the House of Commons, the majority Liberals under Mackenzie King pushed through a revised Bill C-7 - their 'New Deal', as Mackenzie King referred to it during the campaign. As promised, it contains no provisions for conscription or a secret police, and adheres closely to C.D. Howe's original plan for economic subsidisation. [CAN_king_first_name] advised the Canadian Senate to pass the bill without fuss, as delaying the government's ability to function further would be 'unfortunate for us all'."

 canada.69.t: "Conservatives Pass Bill C-8"
 canada.69.d: "With a minimum of debate in the House of Commons, the majority Conservatives pushed through their revised Bill C-8. As promised, it contains provisions for full conscription, an empowered secret police under Maxwell Knight, and the nationalisation of major armament and naval companies. [CAN_king_first_name] advised the Canadian Senate to pass the bill without fuss, as delaying the government's ability to function further would be 'unfortunate for us all'."
 canada.69.a: "It's about time!"

 canada.70.t: "Mackenzie King Retires"
 canada.70.d: "Sir William Lyon Mackenzie King has retired, having led the Liberal Party of Canada since 1919. He first became Prime Minister in 1925, and was heard to say, 'it is time for me to move on.' Louis St. Laurent will replace him as the leader of the party, signalling a definite shift in power towards the more progressive wing of the Liberals."
 canada.70.a: "Let's hope that he enjoys retirement, eh?"

 canada.72.t: "Woodsworth Loses CCF Leadership Vote"
 canada.72.d: "J.S. Woodsworth, who has led the Cooperative Commonwealth Federation since its founding in 1932, lost his leadership over the party - due in large part, it's said, to his increasingly unpopular opposition to war against the syndicalists. He has been replaced by the younger M.J. Coldwell, who has promised to re-invigorate the party and restore it to prominence."

 canada.76.t: "Conservative Party Rebranded"
 canada.76.d: "With their loss in the last election, the Conservatives are left with the feeling that their party is at a low ebb. After gathering the party faithful at their annual convention, they have decided to elect Manitoba Premier John Bracken as their new leader - but he has agreed only to rejoin the party and serve if the party changes their name to the Progressive Conservatives. This rebranding, it is thought, might make the party more palatable to voters in Quebec, to whom the Conservatives have traditionally had trouble appealing."
 canada.76.a: "Good luck with that"

 canada.77.t: "[CAN_king_first_name] Replaces British PM"
 canada.77.d: "Several recent conflicts between British Prime Minister [GetBritishExilePM] and [CAN_king_first_name] have resulted in the Prime Minister finally deciding he had no recourse but to resign his post. The king thanked him for his service to the British cause, and then appointed Robert Vansittart to the post. The replacement comes at the largest shake-up in the British Exile power structure since their arrival into Canada in 1925, and as Vasittart begins to make changes to the Privy Council cabinet-in-exile the ripples are sure to be felt throughout the government."
 canada.77.a: "Interesting"

 canada.100.t: "Québec in Flames"
 canada.100.d: "Across Québec, French Canadians have taken to the streets in massive protests against the country's conscription policy. In Montreal alone, a massive crowd filled St. Catherine Street with loud chanting against both the Prime Minister as well as [CAN_king_first_name]. It's a re-enactment of the Conscription Crisis of 1917, though this time it seems French Canadians have lost their patience. 'Again and again we are called upon to shed French blood on behalf of English wars in Europe!' Québec Premier Maurice Duplessis told a large and angry crowd in Québec City. 'We say no, and they tell us we must! Québec will never be free of English tyranny so long as it is the lapdog to English politicians!'"

 canada.102.d.civ: "The anti-government violence continues, this time in the [french_state.GetName] region. A large group of French Canadian marchers set fire to several factories, causing considerable damage before RCMP forces were able to disperse the group and bring order back to the region. Tensions in [french_state.GetName] remain high."
 canada.102.d.arms: "Emergency crews were called to an arms factory in [french_state.GetName] this week as a huge explosion wracked the facility, causing a great deal of damage. Factory management blames a group of its own French Canadian workers, though no proof of this has so far been uncovered by RCMP investigators."
 canada.102.d.riots: "A series of demonstrations in [french_state.GetName] have turned violent this week, leading to clashes with both the military and RCMP forces. A curfew has been established in several cities, and while an uneasy order has finally been restored the damage caused by the rioters has left its mark on the region."
 canada.102.d.ringleader: "RCMP investigators were pleased to report that a group of French Canadian activists have been arrested in [french_state.GetName], ringleaders behind a recent string of violent demonstrations and bombings.

 canada.104.t: "The Montreal Conference"
 canada.104.d: "Members of the Federal government met today with Québec Premier Maurice Duplessis and a wide assortment of French Canadian politicians and activists in Montreal, in an attempt to sort out the differences between French and English Canadians. The topic of conscription came up repeatedly, but overall there was a feeling that the Québecois felt as if they were an unequal partner in Confederation. While tempers flared several times over the course of the conference, Federal delegates left feeling as if progress had been made and that there was at least the possibility of reconciliation... provided the government was willing to give French Canadians special status both for the French language as well as politically."
 canada.104.a: "That's a lot to ask for..."

 canada.105.t: "Special Status for Québec"
 canada.105.d: "Agreement has finally been reached on a solution that, for now, will see Québec a more willing participant in the Federal government's goals. They've been granted certain privileges unique to the province - the ability to control immigration and exert controls over French language use, powers that are normally reserved for the Federal government itself. While there are many English Canadians who consider this a bribe, and it will still have to go through the long process of amending the Canadian constitution, most are pleased enough to have the conflict over with - at least for now. Québec Premier Maurice Duplessis is calling this a victory and has been busy selling it to French Canadians, so - for the time being - the conflict with Québec appears to be over."
 canada.105.a: "Thank heavens for that!"

 canada.106.t: "The Suppression of French Canadians"
 canada.106.d: "At the order of the Federal government, both the RCMP and Canadian armed forces have moved into Québec in large numbers. Streets are being patrolled, large gatherings dispersed, and force used when absolutely necessary in order to maintain order. The pictures of violence plastered on the front pages of newspapers aren't sitting well with many Canadians, but most admit there appears to be little alternative at the moment. 'We cannot negotiate with violence,' the Prime Minister said to the House of Commons, and that appears to be the end of it."
 canada.106.a: "So must it be"

 canada.107.t: "Québec Premier Replaced"
 canada.107.d: "Throughout Québec, English-speaking Canadians have been quietly replacing Québecois in important provincial positions - culminating with a new provincial election that resulted in the defeat of Maurice Duplessis and the election of Adélard Godbout, leader of the Québec Liberals and much more amenable to working with the Federal government. There have been charges that the Federal government went out of its way to quietly promote Godbout and suppress French-speaking Canadians from participating in the vote... but, so far, these charges have not been proven and are being actively ignored."

'This is un-Canadian,' said Mackenzie King at the Toronto protest, 'and solely a move by a desperate British government to force Canada's compliance when it is most vulnerable.' So far, RCMP has been able to keep the demonstrations from turning violent, but the anger among Canadians is running deep."

 canada.111.t: "Parliament Suspended"
 canada.111.d: "Exerting royal prerogative, [CAN_king_first_name] has taken the unprecedented move of suspending the Canadian Parliament and establishing a military government. Though, on the surface, the king is acting through the Conservative Prime Minister and his cabinet, it is clear that the British Exiles are now firmly - even if unofficially - in charge of the country. The king's action is widely seen as one born of emergency, and a temporary measure intended to get Canada through the war and the Home Isles finally reclaimed.

 canada.150.t: "The Water Under O'Connell Bridge"
 canada.150.d: "Truthfully, the prospect of a military landing on Great Britain has not looked much easier in the last decade. Although plans have been made for all kinds of contingencies, the reality is that we cannot depend for certain on having a staging ground even remotely close to the Isles, and the prospect of an invasion across the Atlantic appeals to nobody. The conclusion among the general staff is that if there is any way at all to guarantee an allied presence near to Britain, we would be well advised to take it.\n\nAnd one may yet appear, in the most unlikely of places. The Irish Republic appears to have avoided falling into the German sphere while recovering from recent internal issues, and is now concerning itself with foreign matters. The dominant issue is relations with the socialist government in London: there is considerable fear that Ireland's entry into the war is inevitable, and that Ireland needs an alliance to protect it. And as unlikely it may seem, it does seem that Dublin may actually be prepared to entertain an entry into the Entente if deemed necessary - or at least, that very preliminary feelers have failed to obtain an unambiguous \"no\" on the idea.\n\nAs much of a boon as it would be, the decision would not be taken lightly by either side. It has been made abundantly clear that to attain this alliance, we would be expected to recognise the annexation of Northern Ireland into the Republic, and forever renounce our claim to it. It would be a very bitter pill to swallow, both for us and the island's loyalists who were hoping the arrangement made after the revolution would be temporary. That said, as steep as the price may be, it may be a necessary one for a chance of liberating Britain - and we owe it to our countrymen to consider all options."

Some members of the government are in favour, though others suggest that the British overlords of Canada would almost certainly betray us once the war was over - as they always have."

In the wake of chaos breaking out in Ulster, and a German backed military coup, the socialist scions of [ENG.GetLeader] and their ilk have seized power in Ireland as part of a revolution of their own.\n\nAlthough many may resign themselves to despair, the brave loyalists of Northern Ireland have vowed to not take this laying down and have already opened contact with Canadian intelligence services to help coordinate resistance to socialist rule. It seems that ultimately their plan will be to launch an uprising, ironically similarly mirroring the Easter Rising they so detest, and seek logistical and materiel support for such an endeavour.\n\nWhilst such a plan may grant the foothold needed to secure the Home Islands once more, not everyone is on board with sending equipment to loosely organised militias, instead of in the hands of proper Canadian soldiers, and a choice must be made as to if it is worth the potential cost."
 canada.159.a: "The loyalists will have our full support!"
 canada.159.a.tt: "§YWhen we are at war with the Third Internationale, Northern Ireland will rise up against [IRE.GetNameDef] after we make contact.§!"
 canada.159.b: "They will unfortunately have to handle this themselves."
 canada.159.b.tt: "§YWhen we are at war with the Third Internationale, Northern Ireland will likely rise up against [IRE.GetNameDef] on its own accord.§!"

 canada.170.t: "An Offer from [From.GetNameDef]"
 canada.170.d: "The [From.GetAdjective] government has approached us with an interesting offer: seeing as we are in dire straits, economically, they are willing to assist our recovery with a large aid package. In return, we would join the Entente and enjoy their protection... and provide them with a means to launch an invasion of [ENG.GetNameDef]. While this solves several of our issues, it also means involving ourselves in a war we have no real stake in."
 canada.170.a: "We can't turn this down"
 canada.170.b: "We regretfully must refuse"

 canada.171.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Agrees"
 canada.171.d: "While the [From.GetAdjective] government is reluctant to get involved in a war, they are in desperate enough straits to agree to our proposal."
 canada.171.a: "Excellent"

 canada.172.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Refuses"
 canada.172.d: "While the [From.GetAdjective] government admits they are in desperate straits, they claim they are well on their way to recovery and have no desire to come between us and [ENG.GetNameDef]. They have expressed thanks for our offer, but have regretfully declined it."
 canada.172.a: "Unfortunate"

 canada.173.t: "[From.GetAdjective] Funds for the Resistance"
 canada.173.d: "Quietly, through indirect channels, [From.GetNameDef] has funnelled equipment and funds for the resistance movement against the syndicalists."
 canada.173.a: "Much appreciated!"

 canada.174.t: "Government Urged to Attack"
 canada.174.d: "[CAN_king_first_name] has been active over the last several weeks, loudly and publicly demanding to know why an attack on [ENG.GetNameDef] hadn't already begun. 'We are ready,' he proclaimed. 'What's more, the syndicalists become more prepared every moment longer we wait, so we shall never be more ready than we are right now. Come what may, the attack must begin!' A large number of Canadians agree with him, it appears, as newspapers across the country have splashed 'Begin the Attack!' across their front pages for days, now."
 canada.174.a: "Perhaps he's right..."
 canada.174.b: "We will attack when we're ready, no sooner"

 canada.175.t: "Rise of the British Loyalists"
 canada.175.d.scotland: "Our attempts to contact the Loyalists remaining in [ENG.GetNameDef] have been successful. As we thought, they've been collecting numbers and equipment since the fall of the Empire... and while they haven't the strength to take on the syndicalists by themselves, they're more than ready to rise up now that we have our foothold in [invasion_state.GetName]. They have gathered in the hills of northern Scotland, and are prepared to attack at our command."
 canada.175.d.england: "Our attempts to contact the Loyalists remaining in [ENG.GetNameDef] have been successful. As we thought, they've been collecting numbers and equipment since the fall of the Empire... and while they haven't the strength to take on the syndicalists by themselves, they're more than ready to rise up now that we have our foothold in [invasion_state.GetName]. They have gathered in the hills of central England, and are prepared to attack at our command."
 canada.175.a: "Bravo, gents!"

 canada.176.t: "Rise of the British Loyalists"
 canada.176.d: "With [CAN.GetNameDef] having taken a foothold in [invasion_state.GetName], the monarchists - who we always knew have been present among us, but have had a pernicious time driving out into the open - have shown themselves and risen up. Their appearance has sent shock waves throughout Britain, though ministers have assured the government the matter should be stabilised within months. With any luck, this is our opportunity to wipe out the Canadians and the loyalists both."
 canada.176.a: "An inconvenience, nothing more"

 canada.177.t: "Rise of the Northern Irish Loyalists"
 canada.177.d: "Confirmation has been received that the weapon shipment sent to Northern Ireland has now arrived in Belfast, and has already been distributed amongst the Ulster Volunteers who are prepared to execute their plans at any moment's notice.\n\nAll that is left now is for them to receive the final signal from Ottawa and their uprising against socialist tyranny shall begin."
 canada.177.a: "For King and Country, Gentlemen!"

 canada.178.t: "Rise of the Northern Loyalists"
 canada.178.d: "In an almost unsurprising turn of events, the loyalists of Ulster have turned once again to the British Crown, and with their help have managed to seize control of much of Northern Ireland in a coordinated strike against Irish rule. As part of a takeover ironically reminiscent of the Easter Rising, the UVF have seized buildings across the six counties, most notably at Belfast City Hall where, in imitation of the Ulster Covenant of 1912, they have signed a document proclaiming independence from Dublin with Entente support and vowing to rise up to defend the \"loyal people of Ulster\" against \"syndicalist and Papist tyranny\".\n\nNorthern Catholics in many areas, despite their own conservatism, have resisted the separatists who wish for their subjugation, with the Irish Citizen Army waging a guerrilla war of their own in defence of their besieged communities and even Catholic supporters of the National Guard have putting aside their misgiving to participate in resistance against the UVF, though internal clashes with the ICA have not been infrequent.\n\nThis uprising has thrown the government into a frenzy as the potential of an Entente landing to reinforce their reactionary loyalist allies and acquire a base next to Great Britain has become a grave security threat both nationally and to the Internationale as a whole. The Cathaoirleach has responded with a speech announcing a state of war against the UVF and that, while acknowledging Protestants as fellow workers duped by the bourgeois into turning against their brothers, the forces of imperialism would be routed."
 canada.178.a: "We'll put them down, just as before!"

 canada.179.t: "British Resistance Falters"
 canada.179.d: "The Canadians have worked hard during their occupation to wear down the syndicalist resistance, and at this point it has all but collapsed. We have no choice but to give in to their annexation."
 canada.179.a: "A sad day for us all..."

 canada.200.t: "The Situation in America"
 canada.200.d: "The government is becoming alarmed at the rapidly-developing crisis in the United States, particularly with the rise of the Socialist Party of America. A syndicalist-aligned nation on our southern border would be unthinkable. The violence is already terrible - to the point that numerous state governors in the American northeast, lacking confidence in the Federal government to maintain order, have asked us to step in should civil war break out. We do not have to answer their request yet, but once the deadline ends we may very well be forced to."
 canada.200.d.assass: "The government is becoming alarmed at the rapidly-developing crisis in the United States. While the assassination of Jack Reed has meant the Socialist Party of America was unable to gather the will to rise up - a fact for which the Canadian government is extremely grateful - it still seems unthinkable that the American government would go to such lengths, and makes many wonder if Huey Long's accusations of corruption and tyranny are true. Even if they are, should we involve ourselves? The violence is already terrible - to the point that numerous state governors in the American northeast, lacking confidence in the Federal government to maintain order, have asked us to step in should civil war break out. We do not have to answer their request yet, but once the deadline ends we may very well be forced to."
 canada.200.d.peace: "The government is becoming alarmed at the rapidly-developing crisis in the United States. While the compromise reached between the government and the Socialist Party of America means there is no threat of a syndicalist uprising - a fact for which the Canadian government is extremely grateful - it is still difficult to watch such rampant destruction. The violence is already terrible - to the point that numerous state governors in the American northeast, lacking confidence in the Federal government to maintain order, have asked us to step in should civil war break out. We do not have to answer their request yet, but once the deadline ends we may very well be forced to."
 canada.200.a: "Unbelievable!"

 canada.201.t: "The Prospect of Intervention"
 canada.201.d.csa: "Parliament has begun a tense debate over whether the Canadian government should recognise one of the warring factions in the south the 'real' America. It's a tricky situation, as doing so will anger the other factions and potentially leave us with a hostile victor in the south... but even worse is the prospect of the so-called [CSA.GetNameDef] winning the day. We cannot be expected to fight wars elsewhere with a syndicalist government sitting directly to the south, can we? For now, support merely means directing the Entente to send volunteers and equipment, but - if we pick a side - some suggest our getting drawn into the conflict will become inevitable."
 canada.201.d.nocsa: "Parliament has begun a tense debate over whether the Canadian government should recognise one of the warring factions in the south the 'real' America. It's a tricky situation, as doing so will anger the other factions and potentially leave us with a hostile victor in the south... and, really, with the fears of a syndicalist faction having proven to be baseless, do we have any call to interfere at all? Many in the government are saying we should do nothing, and let the chips fall where they may. A few, however, say that betting on a winner could nab us a friendly ally, and potentially a grateful future member of the Entente."
 canada.201.a: "We should not get involved"
 canada.201.b: "The Federal government is, of course, the only legitimate one"
 canada.201.c: "We recognise [PSA.GetNameDef] as the true America"
 canada.201.e: "We support Huey Long and [TEX.GetNameDef]"
 canada.201.f: "We support New England's government"

 canada.202.t: "Refugees Flood into [refugee_state.GetName]"
 canada.202.d: "With the situation in America worsening, it's no surprise that [Root.GetNameDef] has become the top destination for those fleeing the violence. Many of the immigrants are legal, but an increasingly large number are not. Already there are several refugee camps in [refugee_state.GetName], many of them coming from [flee_from_state.GetName], and their numbers are putting a strain on our supplies. Observers comment that the situation is likely to get worse before it gets better."
 canada.202.a: "American refugees? The irony..."

 canada.203.t: "[refugee_state.GetName] Refugee Situation Worsens"
 canada.203.d: "While officials in [refugee_state.GetName] have already been struggling to contain the numbers of American refugees crossing the border, recently the situation has grown even worse. A new flood of refugees, most coming from [flee_from_state.GetName], has already arrived and put an increasing strain on the province's infrastructure."
 canada.203.a: "Let's hope this ends soon"

 canada.204.t: "The Refugee Crisis"
 canada.204.d: "The number of illegal refugees crossing the border from America has become a national crisis, impacting [Root.GetNameDef]'s stability and supply capabilities, not to mention the amount of soldiers required to keep the peace. If the current rate of arrivals continues, things are sure to get worse. Parliament is arguing that the government should figure out what to do -- and quickly."
 canada.204.a: "What a mess"

 canada.205.t: "The Refugee Crisis Deepens"
 canada.205.d: "Having not heeded earlier warnings, the crisis caused by the mass arrival of American refugees fleeing the civil war in the south has become worse. Violence in and around the camps along the border has increased, and their reputation is such that many refugees are now attempting to enter the country illegally - where they are sure to face exploitation by the unscrupulous."
 canada.205.a: "Something must be done"

 canada.206.t: "Trade with America"
 canada.206.d: "[Root.GetNameDefCap] relies a great deal on its trade routes that go to the United States. While the civil war has benefited us in some ways, namely that orders for Canadian goods from abroad have increased as American sources become unreliable, the fact is that many of our exports have always gone to America itself... with our biggest customer now an unreliable destination, our economy is left reeling and attempting to figure out what to do until the civil war is ended."
 canada.206.a: "As if we needed more problems"

 canada.207.t: "Clashes in Windsor"
 canada.207.d: "The city of Windsor lies directly across from Detroit, a stronghold of the syndicalist [CSA.GetName]. We've suspected for a while, now, that syndicalist agents have crossed the border secretly, some with the refugees, and now it seems that belief has been vindicated with the city being engulfed in clashes between industrial workers and the police. The police say these 'sympathisers' are being spurred on by syndicalist agents. Whether this is true or not, the violence has continued for several days and only just now been contained."
 canada.207.a: "Syndicalists in Canada? This cannot be!"

 canada.208.t: "Militias Cross into [473.GetName]"
 canada.208.d: "A syndicalist uprising in the state of Washington has spilled across the border as the militia units use it to evade and get around their opponents. This has caused considerable consternation in the region, as Canadian forces have needed to move in and tighten security, with several clashes having already occurred along southern highways. Several incidents of attacks and looting on civilian townships have led to British Columbia being gripped with fear, thinking that - at any moment - syndicalist militias could arrive out of nowhere."
 canada.208.a: "Not good"

 canada.209.t: "Riot at St. Catharines Camp"
 canada.209.d: "Violence has been a common problem at refugee camps, due mainly to conflicts between the refugees themselves as well as with the guards, but also due to the poor conditions. The St. Catharines Camp is one of the most densely-populated in the province, and conditions there have apparently gotten so bad that a full-scale riot by the refugees broke out. They overwhelmed the guards, spilling out of the camp and heading into the outer Toronto area where they were eventually stopped by Ontario provincial police. It is feared this is only the first incident on this scale we're likely to see."
 canada.209.a: "This needs to stop"

 canada.210.t: "Sympathy Strikes Across Canada"
 canada.210.d.csa: "Across the nation, numerous labour unions have risen up in sympathy strikes for [CSA.GetNameDef]. The SPA, they say, has been unfairly characterised as tyrannical, when it is merely combating the larger tyranny of capitalism run rampant. They want the Canadian government to stop 'fear-mongering' against the syndicalists. The strikes have been unruly and disruptive, and in several cases have resulted in violent clashes with the RCMP. Several arrests have been made, and the RCMP is keeping a close eye on strike organisers."
 canada.210.d.aus: "Across the nation, numerous groups have risen up in 'sympathy strikes' for [TEX.GetNameDef]. They are creating blockades and enforcing work-stoppages in several cities, claiming they are doing so in support of Huey Long. 'His fight for the average American is the same fight faced by average people everywhere,' said one organiser. The strikes have been unruly and disruptive, and in several cases have resulted in violent clashes with the RCMP. Several arrests have been made, and the RCMP is keeping a close eye on strike organisers."
 canada.210.a: "Interesting"

 canada.211.t: "The New Home of the Free"
 canada.211.d.nee: "Parliament has been engulfed by argument over what to do regarding the American refugees. Doing nothing is not an option, but many MP's are saying that a massive relief effort is needed to improve conditions in the camps. The expense, they say, is justified because 'Americans are our brothers and sisters, and we must care for them in their hour of need'. In a similar vein, Louis St. Laurent has proposed what he calls Project Samaritan - an even broader relief effort, spreading out the camps and housing refugees with average Canadians. There, the most able would be put to work alongside factory workers and labourers, a far better life than doing nothing inside a camp. The Conservatives, meanwhile, say that the security risk is too great. They have proposed the majority of refugees all be shipped to [NEE.GetNameDef], along with all newcomers. 'This is an American problem,' they say, 'and it should be handled by Americans.'"

 canada.212.d: "As if we didn't have enough of a refugee problem of our own, a huge number of refugees have now been directed towards [Root.GetNameDef] from [From.GetNameDef]. Their reasoning is, apparently, that this is an American problem which should be handled by Americans. We have no choice but to deal with this as best we can."
 canada.212.a: "Thanks a lot, Canada"

 canada.213.t: "Recruitment of Refugees Begins"
 canada.213.d: "All across the country, recruiters are now active at refugee camps, offering the most able a placement within the army. Most understand this is a temporary arrangement - once the war is over, it seems likely that many of them will leave the army and return home again. In the mean time, however, our good treatment of the refugees has led to a large number of men entering our service. They'll fight for the country which has taken them in, they say, even if it means fighting against Americans back home."
 canada.213.a: "Good to hear"

 canada.214.t: "Refugees Return to America"
 canada.214.d.ceasefirecsa: "The ceasefire has meant an end to the American civil war, at least for now, and so a large number of refugees have begun returning home. The fact that [CSA.GetNameDef] is victorious in the east does not sit well with many, however. Those that can are largely going to [PSA.GetNameDef], while others have decided to stay in Canada for good. Regardless of where they go, the refugee crisis in Canada appears to be over."
 canada.214.d.ceasefirenocsa: "The ceasefire has meant an end to the American civil war, at least for now, and so the vast majority of refugees have begun returning home. The fact that the ceasefire will eventually end and the conflict undoubtedly renewed does not still well with many, who have decided to either stay in Canada for good or head for destinations further afield. Regardless of where they go, the refugee crisis in Canada appears to be over."
 canada.214.d.noceasefirecsa: "The civil war in America is over, with [CSA.GetNameDef] having won the day. While this does not sit well with most of the refugees, many believe they have no choice but to return - the worst of the violence is over, after all, or so they hope. Many others have decided to stay in Canada, saying that America is now syndicalist and thus dead to them. Regardless of where they go, the refugee crisis in Canada appears to be over."
 canada.214.d.noceasefirenocsa: "The civil war in America is over, and thus the vast majority of the refugees have decided to return - either to face justice or participate in the reconstruction.

 canada.216.t: "Visit by Canadian Prime Minister"
 canada.216.d: "The Canadian Prime Minister has made a state visit to [Root.GetNameDef], congratulating the President on having reformed America. In private sessions, he has stated his belief that this could not have been done without the help of Canada and the Entente, and thus he hopes that a more permanent alliance between our two countries will result. He suggests a transfer of any owned states claimed by the other, to prevent future conflicts, and for [Root.GetNameDef] to be a more committed and permanent member of the Entente going forward. 'Ours is a special friendship,' he said, 'and I believe it benefits the world if it continues.'"

 canada.218.d: "After a visit by the Prime Minister, several long meetings with the [From.GetAdjective] President have resulted in no decisions being reached. According to the President, they are fine with relations between [From.GetNameDef] and [Root.GetNameDef] remaining as they are... meaning they would prefer to keep us at an arms length. Still, the visit was cordial, and several beneficial trade terms were reached."

We cannot prevent it from happening, but some believe it might be possible to delay. If we were to quietly contact and fund Canadian labour movements, get them to rise up in strikes that have obvious syndicalist connections, the Canadians might be too paranoid to take action until the strikes are shut down. It would, at most, buy us a few months if we keep it up. Otherwise? We should prepare to face an invasion from the north soon."

There are those in our government who suggest the strikes are too suspiciously timed... this must be an effort by [CSA.GetNameDef] to cause revolution before we can act. Regardless of the intent, all agree that the strikes must be shut down before we can think about intervening in the south."
 canada.224.d.later: "After a brief pause, the strikes have continued across the country - heightened in their efforts to call for Canada to end its persecution of syndicalism. The speeches written by the labour leaders, according to the RCMP, might very well have been written by the [CSA.GetAdjective] government. They will have proof soon, they say, but until they discover the source of the strike funding, we will need to combat the strikers and put down this irritating distraction."

 canada.232.b: "We should support the Federal government"
 canada.232.c: "We should support the Pacific government"
 canada.232.e: "We should support Huey Long's Union government"
 canada.232.f: "We should support the New Englander government"
 canada.232.g: "They can make their own decision on the subject"

 canada.300.t: "Departure of the British Exiles"
 canada.300.d: "With the restoration of [GBR.GetNameDef], many of the British Exiles in Canada have begun to depart for home - including British Prime Minister [GetBritishExilePM] and most of his senior staff, as well as a large number of the Exiles which had been drafted into the Canadian military, their presence needed back home immediately to restore order in the country. The rest will likely leave over the next year, constituting a large drain on [Root.GetNameDef]'s resources. Still, most of Canada is relieved to see them go. This is, after all, the moment the Empire has been waiting for since 1925, and it feels like a hard-won victory."
 canada.300.a: "It will take some adjustment, but we'll manage"

 canada.301.t: "The Restoration of Parliament"
 canada.301.d: "Also with the departure of the British Exiles comes the end of the War Measures Act and the restoration of full civilian government to the nation. The Conservative government has resumed control over Parliament, which they re-opened to full fanfare while a loud crowd gathered outside... many of them protesting how the nation had been handled during the emergency, and demanding investigations into the conduct of senior officials. For the moment, the government has scheduled new elections to occur within a year's time."
 canada.301.a: "Thank heavens for that!"

 canada.302.t: "The Canadian Governor General"
 canada.302.d: "Now that [CAN_king_first_name] has returned to [GBR.GetNameDef], he can no longer sit personally in the Canadian House of Commons. The time has come to appoint a Governor General to stand in his stead. The question is who to send. Rewarding one of our generals with the prestigious post will certainly look good to our military, but the Canadians might appreciate rewarding one of their own instead."
 canada.302.a: "Prince Albert will take the post"
 canada.302.b: "Give the job to Lord Mountbatten"
 canada.302.c: "A man like John Vereker will do well in Canada"
 canada.302.e: "Let the Canadians choose their own representative"

 canada.303.t: "The New Governor General"
 canada.303.d.albert: "With [CAN_king_first_name] back in [GBR.GetNameDef], he can no longer sit personally in the Canadian House of Commons. Thus he has appointed a new Governor General to stand in his stead, and has chosen Prince Albert for the task. While many Canadians appreciate having such a senior member of the Royal Family assuming the post, and greeted the Prince with wildly cheering crowds as he arrived in Ottawa, many were hoping that the British government might have allowed a Canadian to assume the post, for once."
 canada.303.d.mountbatten: "With [CAN_king_first_name] back in [GBR.GetNameDef], he can no longer sit personally in the Canadian House of Commons. Thus he has appointed a new Governor General to stand in his stead, and has chosen Lord Louis Mountbatten, cousin to the king and esteemed admiral of the British Navy, for the task. While many Canadians appreciate having such a senior member of the Royal Family assuming the post, many had hoped a Canadian might assume the position instead of it being used as a reward for yet another British military man, and so the crowds greeting Lord Mountbatten in Ottawa were subdued at best."
 canada.303.d.vereker: "With [CAN_king_first_name] back in [GBR.GetNameDef], he can no longer sit personally in the Canadian House of Commons. Thus he has appointed a new Governor General to stand in his stead, and has chosen Lord John Vereker, 6th Viscount Gort, for the task. Many had hoped a Canadian might assume the position instead of it being used as a reward for yet another British military man, and so the crowds greeting Lord Vereker in Ottawa were subdued at best."
 canada.303.d.mcnaughton: "With [CAN_king_first_name] back in [GBR.GetNameDef], he can no longer sit personally in the Canadian House of Commons. Thus he has appointed a new Governor General to stand in his stead, and has chosen Canadian general, Andrew McNaughton, for the task. Canadians are ecstatic at the prospect of one of their own finally being given the role, and thus the crowd which greeted his arrival in Ottawa were large and enthusiastic."
 canada.303.a: "We wish the new Governor General all the best"

 canada.304.t: "Debate on the Referendum Begins"
 canada.304.d: "It seems there are enough Canadians who either feel the British overstayed their welcome or who now feel as if Canada has been left behind, unrewarded and forgotten, that the idea of a referendum on Canada's future in the Commonwealth has rapidly gained traction. French Canadians in Québec are the ones most strongly in favour of cutting ties with the monarchy, but the sentiment is strong enough elsewhere that a national vote is felt necessary. The debates have already sprung up, and it's a contentious issue - one responsible for a sharp and bitter divide between Canadian households and family members, some who feel that Canada should be proud of what it has accomplished for the Empire and others who ask 'what has the Empire done for us?'"
 canada.304.a: "This could get ugly"

 canada.305.t: "Demonstrations Across Québec"
 canada.305.d: "The national debate over the referendum heated up this week with anti-monarchy demonstrations taking place across the province of Québec. The largest was in Québec City, where a massive crowd of over 100,000 showed up from across the province, angered by the suppression they endured during the conscription crisis - on the orders, they believe, of the British Monarchy. True or not, the French Canadians are adamant that their continued place in Canada depends on the referendum passing. Québecois leaders who shouted 'if the referendum fails, there is no future for the French in Canada' met with wild cheers of support. If the crowd was at all subdued, it was because the demonstrations were watched over by thousands of wary Canadian soldiers and police officers."
 canada.305.a: "So much for suppression"

 canada.306.t: "The March on Rideau Hall"
 canada.306.d: "A huge crowd descended on Rideau Hall in Ottawa today, the building which was until recently home to the exiled British king and the royal family. The angry protestors railed against a police line which protected the building from damage, and with good reason considering the threats in previous days by anti-monarchy radicals to burn Rideau Hall to the ground. After hours of confrontation, anti-riot police were called in to disperse the crowd with tear gas, leading many moderate observers to say that it was a dark day in the history of Canadian democracy."
 canada.306.a: "An ugly scene"

 canada.307.t: "March for the King"
 canada.307.d: "Responding to the waves of angry protest over the last several weeks, a march took place in the city of Toronto today - this one in support of [CAN_king_first_name]. While some pointed out that the crowd was largely formed of older, English-speaking Canadians, it was still a stern reminder of how deeply British traditions run in Canada. The conservative speakers reminded the crowd that, without Britain, Canada would not even exist... and they were met with loud cheers. Many of those present spoke fondly of the royal family, and expressed disgust that Canadians would even think of breaking with tradition so readily."
 canada.307.a: "Interesting"

 canada.308.t: "The King's Radio Address"
 canada.308.d: "[CAN_king_first_name] today spoke to the Canadian public by a radio address from Buckingham Palace, taking pains to thank the country for its years of labour and the blood shed on the Empire's behalf. 'Do not think we have forgotten Canada's service,' he said, 'for it has not been and shall never be. Canada has proven itself to be far more than a colony, far more capable and more dutiful than we could possibly have hoped. It was a safe harbour, and for many of us it was home.' He asked that Canadians consider carefully before they chartered a destiny away from the Commonwealth, though in added that - should they choose to leave - the British would be morally bound to respect their collective decision and merely hope that the two countries could continue a long and fruitful friendship."
 canada.308.a: "Well said!"

 canada.309.t: "The Fleming Inquiry Begins"
 canada.309.d.wma: "Considered by some to be disastrous timing, a federal inquiry into the alleged abuses by the government after the invocation of the War Measures Act, headed by Conservative MP Sir Donald Fleming, released its preliminary findings today. While the inquiry stated that it had a great deal more statements to collect and research to conduct, it stressed that it had so far found little evidence to support the idea that the government went beyond that which was 'merited by extreme circumstances'. For those furious at the Canadian government's short cut around democracy, they have declared the inquiry nothing short of a cover up. Rather than addressing the anger, it seems the Fleming Inquiry has stoked it even further."
 canada.309.d.pataut: "Considered by some to be disastrous timing, a federal inquiry into the alleged abuses by the government after the shutdown of Parliament on the king's order, headed by Conservative MP Sir Donald Fleming, released its preliminary findings today. While the inquiry stated that it had a great deal more statements to collect and research to conduct, it stressed that it had so far found little evidence to support the idea that the government went beyond that which was 'merited by extreme circumstances'. For those furious at the idea that the British government-in-exile took control over Canada in what they deem a coup, they have declared the inquiry nothing short of a cover up. Rather than addressing the anger, it seems the Fleming Inquiry has stoked it even further."
 canada.309.a: "Congratulations, Mr. Fleming, you played yourself"

 canada.310.t: "Prime Minister Calls for Unity"
 canada.310.d: "The Canadian Prime Minister today spoke to the country through a televised address, warning that a rift in the 'special relationship' between [CAN.GetNameDef] and [GBR.GetNameDef] would be disastrous for both countries. He pointed out that the government maintained a strong record of democracy throughout the war, and that the king's guidance was invaluable without ever overstepping the boundaries allowed him by both law and tradition. 'After going so far to see the United Kingdom and the monarchy restored, it would be ill-suited for us to spit in the face of our own history. This is a time of healing and recovery, not one where we should create further divisions and anger.'"
 canada.310.a: "But will Canada listen?"

 canada.311.t: "Canadian Referendum Imminent"
 canada.311.d: "With [GBR.GetNameDef] restored and [CAN_king_first_name] restored to Buckingham Palace, [CAN.GetNameDef] has evidently been left with the feeling that the British overstayed their welcome... or that Canada has now been left behind, unrewarded and forgotten once its task was complete. The country has been debating a national referendum on the future of the Commonwealth, and should the vote pass then it will cut ties with the monarchy completely. What this would mean for [CAN.GetNameDef]'s place in the Entente, and the connections it developed with its fellow alliance members during its years of leadership, is currently unknown."
 canada.311.a: "Campaign hard for the vote to fail"
 canada.311.b: "It's their decision to make"
 canada.311.c: "Goodness!"

 canada.315.t: "The National Referendum"
 canada.315.d: "The day of Canada's referendum is upon us, with millions of Canadians going to the polls across the country. Indeed, interest is so high that polling stations are having trouble keeping up with the long lines. The question facing the nation: do they cut ties with the British monarchy and the Commonwealth, continuing on as a nation in charge of its own constitution and its own government, or do they go on as a Dominion and a close ally of [GBR.GetNameDef], the monarchy continuing as a symbol of tradition and history both?"
 canada.315.a: "We must cut ties with the monarchy"
 canada.315.b: "We are a loyal member of the Empire"

 canada.316.t: "Canada Cuts ties with the Monarchy"
 canada.316.d: "With [GBR.GetNameDef] restored and [CAN_king_first_name] restored to Buckingham Palace, [CAN.GetNameDef] evidently now feels left behind, unrewarded and forgotten once its task was complete. Over the last month, the country has been gripped with a divisive debate over the future of their place in the Commonwealth. French-speaking Canadians were adamantly opposed, while more traditional-minded English-speaking Canadians were in favour of remaining. The anger over the referendum led to violent demonstrations and near riots, culminating in the vote that took place today - which has been answered with a definitive 'yes'. Canada will go forward, no longer a Dominion but rather a country in charge of its own government. Whether it will have a place in the Entente alliance remains to be seen."
 canada.316.a: "The people have spoken"
 canada.316.b: "Interesting"

 canada.317.t: "Canadian Referendum Fails"
 canada.317.d: "With [GBR.GetNameDef] restored and [CAN_king_first_name] restored to Buckingham Palace, [CAN.GetNameDef] has evidently been left with the feeling that the British overstayed their welcome... or that Canada has now been left behind, unrewarded and forgotten once its task was complete. Over the last month, the country has been gripped with a divisive debate over the future of their place in the Commonwealth. French-speaking Canadians were adamantly opposed, while more traditional-minded English-speaking Canadians were in favour of remaining. The anger over the referendum led to violent demonstrations and near riots, culminating in the vote that took place today - which has been answered with a definitive 'no'. Canada will continue as a Dominion within the Empire. What will become of Québec's future in wake of this referendum remains to be seen."
 canada.317.a: "The people have spoken"
 canada.317.b: "Interesting"

 canada.318.t: "Québec Nationalists Surge in Elections"
 canada.318.d: "Spurred on by anger among French-speaking Canadians at the continued loyalty shown by English Canadians towards [GBR.GetNameDef], the recent Québec provincial elections have shown a massive resurgence of the Union Nationale with Maurice Duplessis easily winning a majority of seats based on a campaign of sovereignty for Québec. Duplessis now has a mandate to proceed with the process of separation, though it is unclear how that would be done - or if the federal government would even permit it."
 canada.318.a: "It seems suppression was not enough"

 canada.319.t: "The Question of Québec Sovereignty"
 canada.319.d: "It is clear that the Québecois have lost confidence in the Canadian Confederation. They feel they are the lesser partner, the bitterness towards the British monarchy and the divisions between French Canadians and English Canadians too deep. Premier Maurice Duplessis has officially demanded that Québec be allowed to separate... though there is no clear mechanism for it to do so. Considering how many English Canadians live in Québec, who would surely become second class citizens after separation, we would be justified in blocking the attempt. Then again, perhaps this would make things better in the long run?"
 canada.319.a: "They cannot be allowed to separate"
 canada.319.b: "We will grant them autonomy, but not independence"
 canada.319.c: "Let them go - we will remain friends, after all"

 canada.320.t: "Québec Separates from Canada"
 canada.320.d.free: "French- and English-speaking Canadians have been at odds in [CAN.GetNameDef] ever since the country's creation in 1867. Now, the Francophones of Québec have decided that the divisions, exacerbated by the abuses of the British Exiles while they were in charge of the country, are beyond healing.\nThey have demanded independence, and the Canadian government, perhaps believing that the interests of stability would be better served in letting them go, has permitted it. The breakup is amicable, with many economic and cultural ties still remaining, but it remains to be seen if the goodwill will last in the coming years. For now, President-elect Maurice Duplessis is the head of the newest nation in the world, greeting large cheering crowds in Québec City, all of whom are ecstatic that the seemingly impossible has finally been achieved."

While it is not everything the Québecois wanted, autonomy does allow them to control their own immigration and culture, and new President-elect Maurice Duplessis has vowed that, in time, full independence will be achieved."
 canada.320.a: "It had to be done."
 canada.320.b: "Vive le Québec libre!"
 canada.320.c: "Interesting."

 canada.321.t: "Canadian Constitution Patriated"
 canada.321.d: "The British North America Act, which established the Confederation of Canada in 1867, has been under the jurisdiction of the British Parliament - indeed, even while the British government was in exile, they were still technically the masters of Canada's destiny. This is true no longer, as the document has been officially patriated and presented to the Canadian Prime Minister in a solemn ceremony held in Ottawa today. The Prime Minister greeted a cheering crowd, saying that 'Canada is a colony no longer - together we have achieved victory against the syndicalists and proven our strength and perseverance as a nation. Now, with our constitution ours to amend as we see fit, we go forward a truly independent nation!'"
 canada.321.a: "Well done, Canada!"

 canada.322.t: "The Birth of Canadian Nationalism"
 canada.322.d: "Canadian nationalism was never like that of their American cousins to the south. Always it has been more geared towards the idea of national unity rather than that of manifest destiny. In a century where America has faltered, however, it is Canada who has risen to the challenge... and thus this a national pride has begun to take hold, one where Canadians seek to prove their independence and shake off their image as an unassuming country existing on America's fringes, coupled with a growing disaffection for their ties to - and the decisions made by - the Old Empire."
 canada.322.a: "Let's not get carried away, eh?"

 canada.323.t: "Canada Withdraws from the Entente"
 canada.323.d: "Having cut ties with the British monarchy, it was only a matter of time before the Canadian government addressed their role in the Entente alliance - and now they have done so, definitively, announcing their withdrawal from all roles in the Entente effective as of today. Considering that it was Canada who led the Entente for so many years, military leaders in the alliance are left wondering what this means for its future... and, indeed, if the ties to Canada can ever truly be broken.\n\nWhile British officials have scoffed at Canada leaving itself 'foolishly isolated', the Canadians appear confident that their role as an independent and strong nation can only bring further prosperity."
 canada.323.a: "It was time."
 canada.323.b: "It's their decision to make, foolish as it may be."
 canada.323.c: "The Entente without Canada is difficult to imagine."

 canada.324.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Claims [claimed_state.GetName]"
 canada.324.d: "With a surge in nationalism since cutting ties to [GBR.GetNameDef], [From.GetNameDef] has laid claim to the state of [claimed_state.GetName], currently held by [Root.GetNameDef]. It is, according to the [From.GetAdjective] government, part of their 'greater destiny'. Whether they intend to back up their claim remains to be seen."
 canada.324.a: "They dare!"

 canada.325.t: "Growth of the Nationalist Party"
 canada.325.d: "The growth of Canadian nationalism has had a number of side effects, one of which has included the rapid growth of the Nationalist Party - considered until now to be a fringe group of anti-British extremists - with a large number of Conservative Party members defecting to the party. The party leader, Henry Herbert Stevens, has promised to an enthusiastic crowd of supporters that they would lead Canada into a new era of prosperity in the next election."
 canada.325.a: "Interesting, but doubtful"

 canada.326.t: "Canadian Investments"
 canada.326.d: "After the fall of the United Kingdom, the British Exiles flocked to Canada with their expertise and their money... and, now that we are the ones struggling to rebuild a tattered economy, the reverse is happening. Canadian entrepreneurs, many of the British expatriates who have chosen to remain in their new home, are coming to Britain to take advantage of the many opportunities that exist here. It is making the Canadians wealthy, true, but it is also benefiting us a great deal. We have so many ties between us, so many familiar contacts, that the association is a natural one, and it is helping Britain rebuild faster than ever before."
 canada.326.a: "We welcome their presence"

 canada.327.t: "A New Generation of Officers"
 canada.327.d: "Many young Canadian officers proved their value during the reconquest of the United Kingdom, showing their valour and their commanding abilities. Now that many British officers have returned home, the Armed Forces Council is promoting many of these Canadians to higher command posts. Some of them have also been given important roles in military academies, so that their experience will help shape a future generation of tacticians, strategists, and leaders."
 canada.327.a: "Excellent"

 ### Flavour ###
 canada_flavour.1.t: "Miss Serene Efficiency"
 canada_flavour.1.d: "Canada's political establishment is, quite clearly, dominated by men. It's rather rare to see a woman in a bureaucratic position, but Phyllis Gregory, nicknamed “Miss Serene Efficiency”, has broken through those ranks, and made quite a name for herself.\n\nBorn in 1903 in Nova Scotia to a modest family, she quickly showed herself to be an intelligent girl. She quickly learned piano as a child, and was an excellent student. In 1925 she graduated from the University of British Columbia, earning a Bachelor's degree in economics and political science with first class honours. Along with earning her Bachelor's she also earned the “Susan B. Anthony Memorial Scholarship” allowing her to study at Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania, where she earned her Masters of the Arts. After that she moved to Germany and studied at the University of Marburg, where she wrote her Thesis.\n\nEventually she came back home, to Canada, and she managed to get the position in Ottawa as an Economist. Here her education, intelligence, and sheer skill caused her to raise the ranks, even befriending the Conservative R.B. Bennet.\n\nWith the onset of the Homecoming and the war, she only continued to shine. First she was put on the” War Time Prices and Trade Board” as an economic advisor. After that she became the “Fats and Oils Administrator”, putting her in charge of countless items. Soap, paint, starch, printing ink, as a few examples. She was also tasked with finding new sources of oil to help with the War Effort.\n\nToday she has been made the Chief Economist of the Tariff board, the highest office a woman can hold in Canada. An intelligent and elegant woman, who's fought and earned every position and accolade she's been given, an example to all Canadians of what hard work and determination can bring"
 canada_flavour.1.a: "A truly remarkable woman"

 canada_flavour.2.t: "The Hobbit, or There and Back Again"
 canada_flavour.2.d: "The George Allwen and Unwin publishing house has put out a new book by British émigré J. R. R. Tolkien, who returned to South Africa following the revolution. It tells the story of Bilbo Baggins, a strange small creature called a Hobbit, who goes on an adventure featuring wizards, dwarves, giants, goblins and a fire-breathing dragon before returning home a wealthy man. The tale has already received widespread critical acclaim and Tolkien has been nominated for literary prizes. There have been hints that he is working on something longer and larger, but the author's notorious perfectionism might well delay its publishing."
 canada_flavour.2.a: "A delightful story!"

 canada_flavour.3.t: "Gilbert K. Chesterton Dies"
 canada_flavour.3.d: "British writer Gilbert Keith Chesterton died today in his exile in Ottawa, at 62. A prolific author whose most-known novel is certainly \"The Man Who Was Thursday\", he was a devout Roman Catholic and a Christian apologist, two reasons that forced him to leave Britain to avoid persecution after the Syndicalist Revolution."
 canada_flavour.3.a: "The Prince of Paradox died."

 canada_flavour.4.t: "Edmund Allenby Dies"
 canada_flavour.4.d: "General Allenby died today in his exile at Ottawa, aged 75. Retired since 1925, he was mostly known as the commander-in-chief of the British expeditionary forces in the Middle East. After achieving major victories thanks to Arab help, such as taking Jerusalem, he was forced to withdraw as the Weltkrieg went bad for Britain. By honouring him with state funerals, [CAN_king_full_name] wants to show his desire for revenge."
 canada_flavour.4.a: "A war hero died today."

### Entente Events ###
 entente.1.t: "IEDC Created"
 entente.1.d: "The Imperial Economic Development Council has been formed in order to foster greater economic cooperation within the Entente. At the [Root.GetAdjective] government's direction, members of the Entente may be invited into the IEDC, where they will be prompted - once a year - to make an investment of political power into its pool, and investment that gains them access to the IEDC's advisors. That pooled political power is spent by the head of the IEDC to invest back into its members."
 entente.1.a: "An excellent initiative!"

 entente.2.t: "Invitation to the IEDC"
 entente.2.d: "A delegation from the [From.GetAdjective] government arrived today to formally invite [Root.GetNameDef] to join the IEDC - the Imperial Economic Development Council. The IEDC was created to foster greater economic cooperation within the Entente, with yearly (and voluntary) contributions of political power which are invested back in member nations at the discretion of [From.GetNameDef]. There are those in the government who express concern whether [Root.GetNameDef] would actually see a return for its investment, seeing as [From.GetNameDef] could simply decide to invest everything in itself, but considering donations are voluntary it seems like that would ensure a short life for the IEDC."
 entente.2.a: "Join and invest £pol_power 25 Political Power"
 entente.2.b: "Join and invest £pol_power 50 Political Power"
 entente.2.c: "Join and invest £pol_power 100 Political Power"
 entente.2.e: "We have no interest in the IEDC"

 entente.3.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Agrees to Join"
 entente.3.d: "The [From.GetAdjective] government has seen the wisdom of our offer and agreed to join the IEDC, including an initial investment of £pol_power [?From.iedc_contribution] Political Power. The first [From.GetAdjective] economists and engineers have already begun to arrive in [Root.GetNameDef]."
 entente.3.a: "Excellent!"

 entente.4.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Refuses to Join"
 entente.4.d: "Perhaps seeing the Entente as unable to impact its economy in any meaningful way, or simply not trusting the [Root.GetAdjective] government to administer its investments, [From.GetNameDef] has turned down our offer and refused to join the IEDC."
 entente.4.a: "Disappointing"

 entente.5.t: "IEDC Advisors"
 entente.5.d: "Our contribution to the IEDC allows us to take advantage of their pool of advisors - the benefit from which is greater, depending on how much we contributed to the group. How shall we use them over the next year?"
 entente.5.a: "Get them to assist with our economy"
 entente.5.b: "We could really use their naval engineers"
 entente.5.c: "Construction engineers would be very helpful"

 entente.6.t: "IEDC Investment"
 entente.6.d.head: "The IEDC is willing to invest in [Root.GetNameDef], though it does not build in any particular [Root.GetAdjective] state insomuch as boost our overall industrial capacity through the Entente's economic cooperation. These factories remain so long as our participation in the alliance persists. In what direction shall we encourage this new investment?"

 entente.12.t: "Leaving the IEDC"
 entente.12.d: "As we are no longer a member of the Entente, it follows that we can no longer remain part of the IEDC. Already our engineers and advisors are leaving [iedc_leader.GetNameDef]."
 entente.12.a: "So be it!"

 entente.13.t: "IEDC Shut Down"
 entente.13.d: "Without any membership in the organisation, the IEDC has finally elected to disband. There were a few protests on the board, those who said the IEDC could still prove valuable even if it was only coordinating efforts within [Root.GetNameDef] and not within the entire alliance, but for most it was clear that the IEDC had fallen short of its mission."
 entente.13.a: "Unfortunate"

 entente.15.t: "The Foundation of the ISAC "
 entente.15.d: "While the Entente alliance and our membership within it is, theoretically, of a purely military nature, the reality is far more complex than that. One of the legacies of the Great War was the advent of mass mobilisation - the consolidation of large swathes of potentially useful sectors of society into an apparatus designed to aid the war effort. The field of technology was included in this - in the efforts to break the trench warfare of the Western Front, military technology created bold new inventions such as landships in the hopes of finally turning the tide. As result of mobilisation such as this, the line between civilian and military resources became somewhat blurred - and the recent growth of ever-present international tensions have ushered the start of a global arms race, something that nobody can afford to be left behind in.\n\nTo this end, [ENT.GetNameDef] has established an Imperial Scientific and Academic Council - an organisation intended to unify and coordinate the Entente's research efforts across borders, allowing for the swift spread of major technological breakthroughs between member states and the elimination of some wasteful duplicate work. As a member of the alliance, we have been invited to participate in the initiative and reap the benefits alongside our allies, a prospect that has generated much excitement within our scientific community."
 entente.15.a: "A wonderful initiative!"

 entente.20.t: "[CAN_king_first_name]'s Address"
 entente.20.d.home_isles: "[CAN_king_full_name] today addressed the nations of the Entente by radio, congratulating them for their successful efforts in regaining the Home Isles and thanking them for their support during Britain's darkest years. 'There is much cause for grief and much left to be rebuilt,' he said, 'but we should also take this moment to rejoice, for our homecoming is a dream in which some had lost hope. Hope, however, has always been our strongest ally. It sails with us on the seas and marches beside us on the battlefield, and it is to hope we must cling as we move together as one into this next era of our common alliance.'"
 entente.20.d.war_eng: "[CAN_king_full_name] today addressed the nations of the Entente by radio, remarking on the state of the alliance now that war with [ENG.GetNameDef] was finally underway. 'It is with a sadness in our hearts that we wage this war,' he said, 'knowing full well that it is waged against our own countrymen, and that it is British blood we must spill on British soil. Yet there is also resolution, for the tyranny of syndicalism cannot be allowed to reign over any free people... least of which the people of our United Kingdom. There are those who say our alliance stands little chance, but to them I say that we know better, as the men and women who fight for freedom shall always fight with the strength of twenty.'"
 entente.20.d.war_ger: "[CAN_king_full_name] today addressed the nations of the Entente by radio, remarking on the state of the alliance now that it was at war with [GER.GetNameDef]. 'It was not our intention to replay the events of the Great War,' he said, "but now that war with the Germans is upon us, we will fight with all our heart to see that the same mistakes are not made and that, this time, we shall achieve victory. We go into this battle knowing that the Kaiser fights only to sate his hunger for power and conquest, while we fight for the sake of the world and the good of all men. It is this glad knowledge that shall give us all the strength we require.'"
 entente.20.d.war_acw: "[CAN_king_full_name] today addressed the nations of the Entente by radio, remarking on the state of the alliance now that it had become embroiled in the American Civil War. 'We cannot stand by and pretend that the fate of America does not also dictate the fate of our alliance,' he said. '[CAN.GetNameDefCap] shares a long and vulnerable border with the Americans, and there is yet hope that our intervention can yet restore a peaceful and democratic government, possibly even an ally. Our hearts go out to those Americans and Canadians inevitably caught up in this struggle, fighting only for the freedom they have so long enjoyed.'"
 entente.20.d.france_taken: "[CAN_king_full_name] today addressed the nations of the Entente by radio, congratulating them for their successful efforts in retaking the French mainland. 'To see French soldiers once again walking the streets of Paris, and French citizens overjoyed at their liberation from syndicalist tyranny, gives us all hope,' he said. 'There is much in [NFA.GetNameDef] yet to be done, but our alliance goes forward into the future with a glad heart, knowing that our victory has provided a blow for freedom and for the good of all mankind.'"
 entente.20.d.france_mainland: "[CAN_king_full_name] today addressed the nations of the Entente by radio, congratulating them for their successful efforts in bringing the exiled French government back to the mainland. 'Paris yet eludes us,' he said, 'but we can rejoice in seeing French soldiers once again marching in the streets of Marseille, a bold step closer to their ultimate goal of liberating all freedom-loving citizens of [NFA.GetNameDef]. Our alliance has fought hard for this victory, and while there is much yet to be done, and many losses yet to be grieved, we must take a moment to acknowledge all we have accomplished. For we have done it together, as a common alliance seeking only the better for all mankind.'"
 entente.20.d.india_united: "[CAN_king_full_name] today addressed the nations of the Entente by radio, congratulating them for their successful efforts in uniting [RAJ.GetNameDef]. 'Ever since the terrible civil war which tore India apart,' he said, 'we have held onto a desperate hope that one day their nation would once again me made whole. That victory has finally been achieved. We thank the Indian government for the role they have so graciously played within the Commonwealth, and wish them well on the next step of their journey as they begin the healing process that still divides the people of their great nation. Let our alliance keep this in mind, what can be accomplished when we strive to achieve what so many have told us lay forever beyond our grasp.'"
 entente.20.d.italy_united: "[CAN_king_full_name] today addressed the nations of the Entente by radio, congratulating them for their successful efforts in restoring the Italian mainland to [SRD.GetNameDef]. 'So many nations have been split apart by war and syndicalist unrest since the end of the Great War,' he said, 'and here we are reminded once again that there is a path to redemption... for the brave Sardinians, for the Italians liberated from the tyranny of syndicalism, and for us all. As an alliance, our strength lies in our unity and in our resolution that only together can we strike a blow against the forces that would seek to oppress the free peoples of our world.'"
 entente.20.d.india_defeated: "[CAN_king_full_name] today addressed the nations of the Entente by radio, warning them to not give into despair after the fall of the Dominion of India. 'Our alliance exists to offer a path to redemption and freedom for each of our members,' he said, 'but we go into this knowing that not every battle will be won, and not every brother and sister will come out the other side of this war unscarred and intact. Even so, we must be resolute. We are weaker for the loss of India, yes, but we are not broken, and if we remain together we shall enjoy the strength we need to see ultimate victory.'"
 entente.20.d.aus_syndicalist: "[CAN_king_full_name] today addressed the nations of the Entente by radio, warning them to not give into despair after the fall of Australasia to syndicalist forces. 'One of our number has succumbed to strife and tyranny,' he said, 'and so we hang our heads in sadness at the battle which freedom-loving Australasians now have before them. To them we say to take heart, for the British crown sees their struggle, and the Entente is not yet done. The day will come when our alliance lands upon the shores of the Antipodes and puts an end to the syndicalist menace there once and for all.'"
 entente.20.d.wif_syndicalist: "[CAN_king_full_name] today addressed the nations of the Entente by radio, warning them to not give into despair after the fall of the West Indies to syndicalists. 'It was our hope that each of the men and women of our great alliance would be spared the tyranny which syndicalist rule brings,' he said, 'but we know that is not to be. To the West Indian usurpers we can only say that they must prepare themselves, for the Entente shall not rest, shall not waver, until its corrupt and unjust government has been toppled and the West Indians who so bravely fight against them are restored their freedom. That is the mission of our alliance, and this setback does not sap our strength but rather provides us clarity of purpose. That is the lesson we all must cling to in this hour.'"
 entente.20.d.acw_begins: "[CAN_king_full_name] today addressed the nations of the Entente by radio, issuing a sombre note regarding the onset of a second civil war in America. 'Our heart goes out to those noble Americans who now find themselves called upon to fight against the forces of tyranny and oppression in their own homeland,' he said, 'for we know full well the consequences of their failure as well as the terrible cost to one's soul when the enemy is one's own countrymen. Our alliance cannot merely grieve for the devastation, however. We must stand ready to act, for the fate of America is inextricably linked to our own. Should America fall to syndicalism, so too shall [CAN.GetNameDef] and then us all. Would that we did not need to consider such a grave possibility as intervention, but consider it we must - for the good of all humanity.'"
 entente.20.d.war: "[CAN_king_full_name] today addressed the nations of the Entente by radio, calling on them to dedicate their common forces towards the war effort. 'We are an alliance of nations tied together by tradition, yes, but also by a common interest in freedom and the good of mankind. Ours is a noble purpose, and we give thanks each day that allies of such stout heart still remain, still fight against the wearying tide of oppression and syndicalism. We must hold our heads high, and know that there is light at the end of the tunnel. This war will have an end, and we must see it through... together.'"
 entente.20.d.peace1: "[CAN_king_full_name] today addressed the nations of the Entente by radio, calling on them to prepare for the coming war against [ENG.GetNameDef]. 'All of us desire peace,' he said, 'but at the very same time know what it is that must be done. Millions of our countrymen struggle under syndicalist tyranny, a terrible wave which threatens to drown not only the British and the French but also the entire world. It is only with brave hearts and a sense of resolution that we move forward as one, until the day comes when our mettle shall be tested once more. We have every confidence that, on that day, our brave men and women shall prove that they are all the stronger for the trials and tribulations each of us has faced.'"
 entente.20.d.peace2: "[CAN_king_full_name] today addressed the nations of the Entente by radio, warning that - even in this time of peace - the alliance must stand ready to face the unknown. 'The Union of Britain has been defeated,' he said, 'but ours is a brittle peace, and it is only through vigilance that our freedom is maintained. There yet remains much to be done in this world, much that requires our attention, and as our alliance has proven strong by every possible measure it is with every confidence that I know we shall continue to meet these challenges with the grace and courage with which our alliance has been long-defined.'"

[CAN_king_first_name] is expected to meet with all manner of dignitaries throughout [Root.GetNameDef] - indeed, there are so many clamouring for royal attention, the king's staff has been reportedly overwhelmed with requests. Each stop on the king's itinerary is expected to have huge crowds, with a massive parade planned in [parade_state.GetName] in the king's honour. [Root.GetAdjective] officials are extraordinarily pleased with the king's visit, and it seems every effort to roll out the red carpet for him will be spared."

[CAN_king_first_name] is expected to meet with officials and dignitaries throughout [Root.GetNameDef], with at least one parade planned to be held in his honour in [parade_state.GetName]. Considering the king's meagre popularity, attendance is not expected to be very high... though there are still those who eagerly anticipate the king's presence, and [Root.GetAdjective] military leaders are eager to consult with the king's attachés regarding Entente coordination."

 entente.23.d: "While on his tour of [tour_country.GetNameDef], [CAN_king_first_name] has found himself embroiled in a scandal - allegedly involving a married [tour_country.GetAdjective] heiress. While there is no direct proof beyond a few blurry photographs, attempts to keep the scandal under wraps have failed and it's been the front page on [tour_country.GetAdjective] newspapers for weeks. The king says his tour will continue, though there are many who say the goodwill previously generated by it has already all but evaporated."
 entente.23.a: "How terrible!"

 entente.24.t: "[CAN_king_first_name] in Major Royal Scandal"
 entente.24.d: "While on his tour of [tour_country.GetNameDef], [CAN_king_first_name] has found himself embroiled in a major scandal. Apparently, the king was overheard in private conversation with his aides, and the nature was so inflammatory that it led to immediate headlines in [tour_country.GetAdjective] newspapers... headlines which were then supported by anonymous sources within the king's staff and then carried onto papers throughout the Entente. While initially [CAN_king_first_name] insisted on continuing his tour, he has since cut it short and declared that he is 'taking some time' in his private [KR_king_base.GetAdjective] estate. This is no doubt to give the scandal time to blow over, though the damage to his reputation - and the goodwill he generated during his tour - has clearly already been done."
 entente.24.a: "How terrible!"

 entente.25.t: "Attempted Assassination on [CAN_king_first_name]"
 entente.25.d: "While on parade in [tour_country.GetNameDef], an assailant in the crowd shot at the royal carriage, causing a severe panic which almost turned into a stampede. The king was unharmed but quickly evacuated, and a manhunt for the would-be assassin is already underway. [CAN_king_first_name] has been forced to call his tour short, taking with him a sincere apology by the [tour_country.GetAdjective] government... though, outside of the trouble caused by the clamp-down of [tour_country.GetAdjective] security forces, the goodwill of the [tour_country.GetAdjective] public has been unaffected. Indeed, the newspapers have been declaring nothing but praise for the king, who has since declared he will be taking a few months off of public appearances to recover from the ordeal."
 entente.25.a: "Phew! A close call!"

 entente.26.t: "Royal Tour Cut Short"
 entente.26.d: "[CAN_king_first_name]'s tour of [tour_country.GetNameDef] has been cut short due to the king's illness, which the royal staff claim is nothing serious and most likely brought on by exhaustion. The [tour_country.GetAdjective] public is clearly disappointed by the decision, though well-wishes have been pouring into the royal residence since the announcement was made. It's unknown how long the king will require to recover, and in the case of the [tour_country.GetAdjective] tour, the only likely effect is that the lingering effects of the goodwill it generated won't last nearly as long as hoped."
 entente.26.a: "At least His Majesty is all right"

 entente.27.t: "Royal Speech Well-Received"
 entente.27.d: "A speech made by [CAN_king_first_name] during his tour of [tour_country.GetNameDef], one where he pressed the virtues of the Entente and the need for a restoration of order in a world which has been thrown into chaos, has hit a particularly strong note among the [tour_country.GetAdjective] people and also been picked up by many national newspapers. The king has been complimented for his eloquence as well as his advocacy, making a strong positive note as the [tour_country.GetAdjective] tour begins to wrap up."
 entente.27.a: "Well done!"

 entente.28.t: "Royal Speech Poorly Received"
 entente.28.d: "A speech made by [CAN_king_first_name] during his tour of [tour_country.GetNameDef] ended up in disarray when the king fared poorly against several hecklers in the crowd. He was overheard making some choice comments regarding the 'rudeness' of the hecklers, who turned out to be wounded veterans... a story which has been picked up in many [tour_country.GetAdjective] newspapers and resulted in [CAN_king_first_name] being painted in a rather unfavourable light. It's not a scandal, at least, but it does ring a rather sour note as the king's [tour_country.GetAdjective] tour begins to wrap up."
 entente.28.a: "Ah well"

 entente.30.d.low: "The Exiles do not currently have a great deal of influence within [Root.GetNameDef]. Those placed within the [Root.GetAdjective] government have mostly used up their favours, and the British industrialists in the country are still consolidating their wealth. They stand ready to support [CAN_king_first_name] over the next year by whatever means he feels is necessary, though most feel their influence over [Root.GetNameDef] needs to grow first."
 entente.30.d.med: "The Exiles have currently taken up prominent places within both the [Root.GetAdjective] government and within its corporate sector, and they stand ready to support [CAN_king_first_name] over the next year by whatever means he feels is necessary."
 entente.30.d.high: "The Exiles have currently taken up powerful positions within the [Root.GetAdjective] government, and its industrialists have a strong hold over the [Root.GetAdjective] industrial economy.

The charge brings up several sticky points, not least of which is whether [Root.GetAdjective] courts have jurisdiction over a British national. Other expatriates have been arrested in the past, but never someone of such a high profile, and the [Root.GetAdjective] press has pounced on the scandal to the point where the public lingers over each day's lurid headlines. [CAN_king_first_name] is willing to personally intervene on the man's behalf, though it would cost the king a great deal of his reputation, and there are others who say it is time for the government to step in."

The story has gone public, and the [Root.GetAdjective] press is playing it up as a betrayal of the country by the Exiles themselves... flames which have been fanned by recent comments by the king, defending the official as a personal friend. Now we are left with allowing the trial to be played out with the full eyes of the public upon it, allowing [CAN_king_first_name] the chance to intervene despite the damage to the monarchy, or intervening ourselves and handing the trial over to the British government-in-exile to be handled quietly, despite the outrage this would cause."

 entente.54.t: "Conflict with the British Exiles"
 entente.54.d.1: "Prime Minister [GetBritishExilePM], head of the British Exiles in [Root.GetNameDef], is currently in the midst of a war of words with the [Root.GetAdjective] Prime Minister over the state of the [Root.GetAdjective] military and its overall preparedness to retake the Home Isles... a conflict which is starting to bleed into the national press, who are all too ready to label the Exiles as 'ungrateful squatters'."
 entente.54.d.2: "A recent law being considered by the [Root.GetAdjective] regarding the legal status of British expatriates in [Root.GetNameDef] is seeing heavy opposition by [CAN_king_first_name] and his Privy Council - who are threatening to exert royal prerogative over the bill, which is their legal right even though it would come at a heavy price, considering how the Exiles are sometimes viewed by the [Root.GetAdjective] public. Some members of the government are desperate to find a compromise."
 entente.54.d.3: "A dispute is slowly rearing its head within [Root.GetAdjective] military circles - namely who holds ultimate command over those British expatriates which are currently supported, and housed, within the [Root.GetAdjective] armed forces. Normally the Exiles and the [Root.GetAdjective] government would work together on these matters, but there are several sticking points which are refusing to go away and neither side appears ready to give on inch."
 entente.54.d.4: "Several recent comments by the Prime Minister [GetBritishExilePM], head of the British Exiles in [Root.GetNameDef], have been taken as a sign of interference in the next [Root.GetAdjective] election, and some members of the [Root.GetAdjective] government have taken umbrage - to the point of going to the [Root.GetAdjective] press with complaints regarding what they see as the erosion of [Root.GetNameDef]'s sovereignty. It is feared that this conflict might very easily get out of hand."
 entente.54.d.5: "The current influence of the British Exiles wielded within the [Root.GetAdjective] government has recently become a concern to opposition parties, some members of which have complained to the press - citing several examples where the king's Privy Council has overruled the government on matters they considered important, particularly if they believed it would lengthen the timetable for [Root.GetNameDef] reclaiming the Home Isles. The [Root.GetAdjective] press is eager to take up the challenge, and if the matter is not addressed soon it could lead to a larger streak of anti-British sentiment within the country."
 entente.54.d.6: "Several prominent [Root.GetAdjective] businessmen have been complaining about the favouritism shown towards British Exiles in [Root.GetNameDef]. British industrialists, they say, are given preferential treatment on contracts and even allowed to skirt a number of legal requirements that ordinary [Root.GetAdjective] citizens must comply with. The complaints are gaining traction with the [Root.GetAdjective] press, and if not addressed could grow into a much more serious matter."
 entente.54.d.7: "At least one major British industrialist, an Exile within [Root.GetNameDef] and member of [CAN_king_first_name]'s inner circle, has been loudly complaining at the number of what he calls 'arbitrary' restrictions placed on British Exiles when it comes to operating businesses within the country. 'We are doing the best we can,' he has said to the [Root.GetAdjective] press, 'and our help is surely needed for the war effort!' The government, meanwhile, claims it cannot afford to give the British Exiles an unfair advantage in business circles. With the king considering weighing in on the argument, it might be better to address sooner rather than later."

 entente.55.d: "The British Exiles have amassed a great deal of influence within [Root.GetNameDef]... so much so, in fact, that they have become accustomed to having their way. When [CAN_king_first_name] recently questioned a decision of the Prime Minister [GetBritishExilePM], head of his Privy Council, the result was an unexpected feud between the Exiles and their monarch, one that the [Root.GetAdjective] press has become aware of. The resulting war of words was short, but enough that both parties were damaged in the eyes of the [Root.GetAdjective] public."
 entente.55.a: "Let us hope that doesn't happen again..."

 entente.56.t: "British Exile Fortunes Improve"
 entente.56.d.1: "Several of the more prominent British industrialists currently living in [Root.GetNameDef], members of [CAN_king_first_name]'s inner circle, have been doing quite well as of late. Their investments in the [Root.GetAdjective] economy have been paying off handsomely, and thus their potential contribution towards the Exiles' overall influence has increased accordingly."
 entente.56.d.2: "A wealthy family of British expatriates living in [Root.GetNameDef], having fled the Union of Britain shortly after its rise, has been seen in the company of [CAN_king_first_name] much over recent months. Word has it that they have been admitted to the king's inner circle. If the rumours are true, the influence of the British Exiles is quickly improving."
 entente.56.d.3: "One of the members of the [CAN_king_first_name]'s Privy Council has become something of a darling in the [Root.GetAdjective] media as of late. Following his much-publicised marriage to a [Root.GetAdjective] actress, his speeches have been well-attended and many consider him an up-and-comer... indeed, even the [Root.GetAdjective] government seems to listen with rapt attention when he speaks."
 entente.56.d.4: "A high-profile member of the [Root.GetAdjective] government died today. Much known for his public rants on the importance of [Root.GetAdjective] sovereignty in the face of the British presence, and a self-avowed Republican, his replacement is a much more moderate figure as well as a friend of [CAN_king_first_name]. It is acknowledges in many circles that this is a boon for the British Exile cause in [Root.GetNameDef]."
 entente.56.d.5: "Recent public sentiment in [Root.GetNameDef] has been turning towards the cause of the British Exiles, with the Prime Minister [GetBritishExilePM] conducting several interviews on [Root.GetAdjective] national radio which have painted the Homecoming as a cause that cannot be given up on just yet. Numerous other expatriates have gone on the radio to regularly tell fond stories of the United Kingdom which once was in the weeks since, offering the Exiles even more public sympathy."
 entente.56.d.6: "A prominent member of a British noble family currently living in [Root.GetNameDef] died recently, and his funeral gained much national attention - which included a last statement written by the man, explaining at length how his final wish had been to walk on the grounds of his family's ancestral estates one last time. The funeral has gained a great deal of public sympathy for the plight of the other British Exiles."
 entente.56.d.7: "Several public policy meetings within the [Root.GetAdjective] government have ended in favour of the British Exiles recently, with prominent members of the king's Privy Council - and even [CAN_king_first_name] himself - attending and making a very public show of being conciliatory and asking for [Root.GetAdjective] forbearance rather than demanding it. The effort has clearly gone over well, and the influence of the Privy Council in government circles is definitely improving."
 entente.56.a: "Excellent"

 entente.57.t: "British Exile Fortunes Worsen"
 entente.57.d.1: "One of the most prominent British industrialists currently living in [Root.GetNameDef], a member of [CAN_king_first_name]'s inner circle, today had to declare bankruptcy after months of declining fortunes - and, rumour has it, a pending scandal of insider trading. While there is some sympathy for the industrialist, who was forced to leave a great deal of his fortune behind in the Home Isles, it does not change the fact that this negatively impacts the fortunes of the British Exiles a great deal."
 entente.57.d.2: "One of the wealthy families of British expatriates living in [Root.GetNameDef], having fled the Union of Britain shortly after its rise, has noticeably cut its ties with [CAN_king_first_name] in recent months following a very public dispute between the family's patriarch and the king. Seeing as the family was once considered an integral part of [CAN_king_first_name]'s inner circle, the fortunes of the British Exiles have surely been hurt by this parting."
 entente.57.d.3: "One of the more integral British ministers, a member of the king's Privy Council, has been caught up in an increasing series of scandals in the [Root.GetAdjective] media as of late, starting with the revelation of an affair and ending with accusations of bribery and nepotism. [CAN_king_first_name] finally ended the matter by releasing him from his position today, though it is clear that the damage has already been done to the overall influence the British Exiles currently enjoy in [Root.GetNameDef]."
 entente.57.d.4: "A high-profile member of the [Root.GetAdjective] government died today. Much known for this personal friendship with [CAN_king_first_name], and having been among the first to welcome the British Exiles to [Root.GetNameDef], his replacement is a man more known for questioning British influence over the [Root.GetAdjective] government... and thus his loss is considered a severe blow to the cause of the British Exiles."
 entente.57.d.5: "Recent public sentiment in [Root.GetNameDef] has been turning against the cause of the British Exiles, with the Prime Minister [GetBritishExilePM] having conducted a rather disastrous interview on [Root.GetAdjective] national radio which painted him as accusing the [Root.GetAdjective] people as being too 'lazy' to achieve victory against the Union of Britain. The Prime Minister later clarified strenuously that this was not what he meant, but the damage has already been done."
 entente.57.d.6: "A speech made by a [Root.GetAdjective] politician, considered almost a nobody with little chance of reaching Parliament, gained national attention recently, no doubt due to the man's angry declaration that it was time to 'give the boot' to the British Exiles who he described as 'leeches dependent on [Root.GetAdjective] goodwill'. The attention would have quickly passed had [CAN_king_first_name] not gone on record derisively insulting the man's 'lack of loyalty' - which provoked considerable anger and even more press coverage for months."
 entente.57.d.7: "Several public policy meetings within the [Root.GetAdjective] government have ended recently with the British Exiles decidedly on the losing end. Prominent members of the king's Privy Council - and even [CAN_king_first_name] himself - attended these meetings in an effort to aid their cause, but their presence ultimately did more harm than good, and was seen as an attempt to exert undue influence over [Root.GetNameDef]'s sovereignty. The Exiles have dutifully backed off from attendance in recent weeks, though it is clear the damage to public perception has already been done."
 entente.57.a: "An unfortunate setback"

 entente.58.t: "[CAN_king_first_name] in Royal Scandal"
 entente.58.d.1: "[Root.GetAdjective] newspapers are all abuzz with the details regarding [CAN_king_first_name]'s latest alleged affair - this one with a British aristocrat who is herself married. While both parties have denied the allegations, they have been photographed together on several occasions, and more than one source inside the royal household affirms that the rumours are completely true. The scandal has done considerable harm to [CAN_king_first_name]'s popularity in [Root.GetNameDef], with the public declaring the king's conduct 'disgraceful'."
 entente.58.d.2: "A member of the British royal family has been caught up in a royal scandal, with the headlines in [Root.GetAdjective] newspapers dominated by accusations of infidelity and deceit. While [CAN_king_first_name] himself is not part of the scandal, it has not reflected well on the monarchy as a whole."
 entente.58.d.3: "Recent revelations reported in a [Root.GetAdjective] national newspaper claim that [CAN_king_first_name] used underhanded tactics to have a personal friend appointed to a plum political position within the [Root.GetAdjective] government. It has not helped matters that the king's friend has been overheard bragging about the favours he's received from the royal family, and all the recent attention has painted the monarchy in a particularly bad light."
 entente.58.d.4: "A dispute within the British royal family has gone public, and although the conflict has been denied by all parties involved, [Root.GetAdjective] newspapers are filled with accounts supported by 'unnamed sources' inside the royal household. The [Root.GetAdjective] public, amused by the royal antics, has been glued to the headlines... and a stiff response from [CAN_king_first_name] has likely done the monarchy more harm than good."
 entente.58.d.5: "There has been a recent upsurge in anti-monarchist sentiment within [Root.GetNameDef], likely driven by syndicalist propaganda... but also not helped by newspaper accounts depicting the British royal family living in luxury and going about their day-to-day business as if nothing had changed. The newspaper stories were intended to promote the royals through an 'inside look' at their lifestyle, but appear to have had the opposite effect."
 entente.58.d.6: "A public spat between [CAN_king_first_name] and a rather prominent member of the British aristocracy has grown rather ugly. The aristocrat is said to have disavowed the monarchy, and his family is leaving [Root.GetNameDef] for an unknown destination... and the king is angry enough that he resorted to public comments in a [Root.GetAdjective] newspaper that called the family 'traitors' and worse. Public sentiment, however, seems to be that the entire affair reflects badly on the monarchy itself, rather than the aristocrat."
 entente.58.d.7: "A recent interview with [CAN_king_first_name] by a [Root.GetAdjective] publication has been received poorly, with several of the king's comments being perceived by the [Root.GetAdjective] public as 'out of touch'... particularly in light of the hardships suffered by the [Root.GetAdjective] people in recent years. The royal establishment has offered explanations and apologies, so the furore in the press is already dying down, but there is a general sentiment that the damage to the monarchy's reputation is already done."
 entente.58.a: "Unfortunate"

 entente.59.t: "Popularity of the Monarchy Rises"
 entente.59.d.1: "A recent wedding within the greater royal family has captured the imagination of the [Root.GetAdjective] people. Perhaps the state of the world and the country is such that the public is looking for a distraction... and thus [Root.GetAdjective] newspapers have been reporting on the royal wedding with a certain amount of glee. Royalists have been happily waving the British flag, glad for a moment of respite."
 entente.59.d.2: "A recent interview with [CAN_king_first_name] by a [Root.GetAdjective] publication has been received positively. The article is considered a rare look inside the king's private life and his private thoughts, and the [Root.GetAdjective] public has responded enthusiastically."
 entente.59.d.3: "[CAN_king_first_name] completed a visit to a [Root.GetAdjective] military base this week, and while some have complained that it was a clear publicity stunt the pictures of the king shaking hands with excited, grateful soldiers has done wonders for the king's reputation. 'He really seems to care about us,' one soldier was remarked on saying. 'It makes me so proud to fight in his name.'"
 entente.59.d.4: "[CAN_king_first_name] recently took time out of his busy schedule to visit a [Root.GetAdjective] hospital, spending the afternoon meeting with the sick and the elderly. The visit was apparently not intended for publicity, with the king banning all cameras and reporters within, but word still got out afterwards. Most of those he visited gave the king a glowing review, saying that 'he is such a kind, caring man'. Some cynically suggest that it was a publicity stunt nevertheless, and - if so - it certainly seems to have done the trick for the king's reputation."
 entente.59.d.5: "A recent death within the greater royal family - a young cousin of [CAN_king_first_name]'s who has been serving with the [Root.GetAdjective] military - has gained a great deal of sympathy and attention from the [Root.GetAdjective] public. There is a sense among many that the royals are truly part of [Root.GetNameDef], willing to shed blood alongside [Root.GetAdjective] soldiers in pursuit of a common goal."
 entente.59.d.6: "There has been a recent upswing in pro-monarchist sentiment within [Root.GetNameDef], despite - or perhaps because of - syndicalist propaganda. Some portrayals of the royal family within [Root.GetAdjective] newspapers have been depicting them as more down-to-earth and accessible, which is new territory for the traditionally aloof royals but appears to be working for them."
 entente.59.d.7: "[CAN_king_first_name] has been quite busy lately, making appearances at public openings, christening a new ship, attending church, sitting personally in his seat at the [Root.GetAdjective] parliament buildings... it has left the king quite exhausted, but it's had the effect of heightening the king's profile with the [Root.GetAdjective] people. For the moment, they appear quite fond of him."
 entente.59.a: "Wonderful!"

 entente.60.t: "[CAN_king_first_name] Takes Time Off"
 entente.60.d.1: "After recent concerns from the king's physicians regarding his personal health, [CAN_king_first_name] has informed the [Root.GetAdjective] government that he is going to be taking some personal time away from his public duties over the next few months."
 entente.60.d.2: "[CAN_king_first_name] has recently scaled back his public appearances and other duties, claiming the need to see to personal matters at his [Root.GetAdjective] estate. He told at least one reporter that there is nothing additional to be concerned over, though that hasn't stopped newspapers from speculating."
 entente.60.d.3: "Recent trouble within the royal family has led to [CAN_king_first_name] scaling back his public appearances and governmental obligations, at least over the next few months. He told at least one reporter that there is nothing additional to be concerned over, though that hasn't stopped newspapers from speculating."
 entente.60.a: "I see."

 entente.61.t: "[CAN_king_first_name] Reviews Military"
 entente.61.d: "[CAN_king_first_name] has spent the last few weeks touring [Root.GetAdjective] military bases, reviewing the troops and meetings with generals regarding the preparedness of the [Root.GetAdjective] military. He appeared pleased overall, though not as pleased as the [Root.GetAdjective] soldiers were to meet him - many got to shake the king's hand and exchange a few words, and the entire tour reflected well in [Root.GetAdjective] newspapers."
 entente.61.a: "Excellent"

 entente.62.t: "King Edward's Party Lifestyle"
 entente.62.d.nothome: "Since assuming his father's throne, King Edward has been lighting up the [Root.GetAdjective] social scene, throwing parties at the royal estate and mingling with socialites on a regular basis. Indeed, the new king appears to be enjoying his new status so much it's led to a growing commentary in [Root.GetAdjective] newspapers that Edward doesn't seem to be taking his role with the gravity that some would expect for a British Exile. 'I saw him laughing and carrying on with the lords and ladies,' one witness stated. 'You'd think he didn't have a care in the world, that he may as well have been back in London.' Monarchists have been quick to defend the king, saying that his social appearances are quite normal, and should be welcomed after George V's long period of reclusiveness following the royal exile from the Home Isles."

 entente.63.d: "With American refugees flooding north by the thousands, Canada has seen great difficulty in dealing with them all. King Edward, however, has recently made it his personal mission to greet them and make them feel welcome - at least for the time being. After several visits to camps in Ontario and Québec, the king held an elaborate garden party in Montreal to meet with more prominent Americans, the wealthy elites and celebrities who were able to come north immediately upon the outbreak of the civil war. There are some accusing the king of using this as yet another excuse to expand his social contacts, but it cannot be denied that most of the Americans were delighted by their treatment and treated the king with all the respect and ceremony anyone could desire."
 entente.63.a: "Good for him"

 entente.64.d.nee: "King Edward's fascination with American celebrities appears to have continued, what with his attendance at an increasing number of events involving refugees and trips to New England - including one recent trip to Boston, where the king was spotted in the company of an American actress by the name of Constance Bennett. This makes for the third time King Edward and the married Mrs. Bennett - currently married to French film director, Henri de la Falaise, though recent reports have it that the two are separated since the start of the civil war - have been spotted in close company, and rumours abound that the king is smitten.

The announcement follows months of speculation regarding their relationship, with insiders commenting that the king was 'so in love with Constance it's as if he's drunk'. The problem with the king's announcement, however, is that Constance Bennett, while of unclear religious affiliation, is a twice-divorced woman who is still legally married to her third husband, Henri de la Falaise. As the nominal head of the Church of England, which does not permit the divorced to remarry with a living former spouse, this is clearly unacceptable for the king... and already [Root.GetNameDef] and the remains of the Empire are tearing themselves apart over what this could mean."

 entente.66.d: "King Edward's partying days seem to be nearing an end - not, as some might believe, because of his advancing age, but because of a reported romance with Princess Katherine of Greece and Denmark, daughter and youngest child of King Constantine I of Greece. The two were introduced by relatives, it's said, and have hit it off. Indeed, Edward appears to be spending time with her exclusively, and the pair have been photographed together at numerous parties throughout [Root.GetNameDef].

Queen Constance has spent much of her time attending functions separately from the king, visiting her home city of Boston for weeks at a time, and it is said she returns to the king's side only reluctantly. While there are some laying the blame for the child's lack of issue on Edward himself, still others are claiming the two should never have married in the first place and that a royal divorce - unthinkable in any other era - might soon be looming."

Already she has been touring the country, calling on the [Root.GetAdjective] people to take heart, and her support for various war charities has not gone without notice. While some had cast doubt on the king's ascension to the throne, lacking a male heir, it is now clear they are being won over by the princess's simple charm."

'There may be dark days ahead,' he warned, 'and war is no longer confined to the battlefield, but we can only do the right as we see the right and reverently commend our cause to God.' The speech was solemn and filled with references to the horrors of war, carrying a warning to the [Root.GetAdjective] people to maintain their loyalty to the government and the cause of good order. It was well-received by most, though there were still a few comments in the newspapers the following day about Henry's lack of charisma, bemoaning the loss of 'lively Edward'."

Newspaper reporters have lauded her for being as willing to change a car tyre as she is to tend to a wounded soldier, and her no-nonsense manner has won over many people. Indeed, there are some who say the Queen has become more popular than King Henry himself, a fact he laughingly admits to in almost every public appearance."

The problem with the king's engagement, however, is that Constance Bennett, while of unclear religious affiliation, is a twice-divorced woman who is still legally married to her third husband, Henri de la Falaise. As the nominal head of the Church of England, which does not permit the divorced to remarry with a living former spouse, this is clearly unacceptable for the king.

In his broadcast, the king avowed that his love for Constance was true - as is hers for him. Neither of them sees Constance's current marriage as an impediment, and what's more the king believes that in these 'modern times' the prohibition of the Church of England should alone keep him from serving his people in good faith. With the crisis shortly to reach a high point in Parliament, it remains to be seen whether the king's attempt to garner goodwill with the public will bear fruit."

With so much public pressure on the government, it seems impossible that the king could be expected to abdicate his throne now. As a result, a hastily-drawn up decree from the Church of England has been issued offering Constance Bennett clemency... when and if the royal wedding should take place.

A special decree for clemency has been issued by the Church of England, offering clemency for Constance Bennett when and if the wedding takes place.

Edward has indicated his willingness to step down, if the government should force his hand, though he says he will do so regretfully... and with great concern for the Empire's well-being. Others are less concerned about the fate of the Empire, though the king does still have supporters throughout the country declaring their ardent support for the king in his time of crisis."

The logical choice would be Prince Albert - he is the eldest heir and favourite of the late King George, though there is concern regarding both his health and his profound lack of social ability. Is he the right choice to lead the Empire? With normal succession already thrown out the window, it would be possible for another prince to be chosen. Prince Henry is considered a biddable man, and has military experience that would be of great use. Prince George, meanwhile, is the youngest but is charismatic - and already has a son, to ensure a future king to follow him."

King Edward is the nominal head of the Church of England, an institution which does not permit a divorcee to remarry, and thus the scandal of such a marriage was too much for many. Even so, the king's popularity in the Empire has won the day. A radio plea made by the king to the public prompted a series of demonstrations which eventually encouraged the government to abandon any notion of Edward's abdication."

Edward is giving up the throne to marry American film star, Constance Bennett, who he met in Canada when she fled to Canada during the American Civil War. Twice-divorced and currently still married, Bennett was seen as unsuitable for a king who is also the head of the Church of England, which does not permit divorcees to remarry, and Edward was unwilling to give her up for any reason.\n\nPrince Albert, viewed by many as a quiet and socially awkward man, is set to be coronated as King Albert I, inheriting the rule over a British Empire that is vastly different from that of his grandfather's."

 entente.204.d.res_first: "The next to speak is the delegate from [From.GetNameDef], who spoke at length about the need for scientific investment. The economy needs modern science in order to not further stagnate, he said, while the military needs the most modern weapons. He asked that the Dominion send what research assistance they could to [From.GetNameDef], so they could better prepare for the war."

Historically, the empire's fleet has always been constructed in the dockyards of Great Britain, but recent circumstances found us leaning more on our southern neighbour in the United States. Their dockyards helped us complete some of the larger battleships that we managed to secure from the Revolutionaries at the end of the civil war. As the dockyards back in Europe are busy rebuilding a fleet for [GBR.GetNameDef], perhaps we should reach out to our ally in [361.owner.GetNameDef] to see about leasing some of their shipyards to bolster our own forces?"
 entente.278.d.gbrdoesnotexist: "Ever since the British Revolution, the dockyards that for centuries churned out the Royal Navy have fallen into enemy hands. Comparatively, local Canadian shipbuilding can not hope to match the home isles. If we are to retake the United Kingdom, we will need a large navy. Our southern neighbour has much more capability to do this than we do. Just as their dockyards were leased to finish the construction of the King George and King David dreadnoughts, should we approach [361.owner.GetNameDef] about leasing the Brooklyn Naval Yard to bolster our own fleet?"

It will undoubtebly take years for the Royal Navy to rebuild to her former pre-revolution levels. As the dockyards in the home isles are busy rebuilding the British fleet, the Canadians have reached out with the possibility of leasing dockyards from us. Despite large gains in shipbuilding capacity developed during the exile, our shipyards can still far outpace their Canadian counterparts. If we agree to lease the Brooklyn Yard to the Canadians, they are offering us support in rebuilding the nation."

In exchange for leasing of the Brooklyn Naval Yard, they will contribute funding and other resource to help us rebuild the wartorn nation. If the Canadians and the British Exiles are to reconquer the United Kingdom they will need a strong navy; one that our shipyards could produce. This could also pave the way towards future cooperation between our two nations in shipbuilding. Our assistance in building ships to take part in the Homecoming would earn us much gratitude from our neighbours to the north."

In the years before the Great War, the Brooklyn Naval Yard helped facilitate the construction of the Connecticut-class battleships although the workforce of the naval yard dropped significantly as a result of the Great Depression.\n\nDuring the Second American Civil War, the borough of Brooklyn became the battleground for some of the most intense and fierce fighting of the war. When [FROM.GetNameDefCap] asserted their full control over the city of New York, the Brooklyn Naval Yard was eventually rebuilt and refurbished (despite extensive war-time damage) to fulfil their naval capacities. Due to the necessity of maintaining the Royal Navy, our government has approached [FROM.GetNameDef] about their willingness to lease the dockyard. It appears that our persuasion and arguments have borne fruit since they have expressed their willingness to lease the Brooklyn Naval Yard for the time being in order to allow us to expand our naval power."

 entente.281.d: "Since 1801, the Brooklyn Naval Yard has served the interests of the American Navy by providing it with modern shipyards, facilities, drydocks - to build and refine some of the largest and most powerful warships of the American fleet. In the years before the Weltkrieg, the Brooklyn Naval Yard helped facilitate the construction of the Connecticut-class battleships although the workforce of the naval yard dropped significantly as a result of the Great Depression.\n\nDuring the Second American Civil War, the borough of Brooklyn became the battleground for some of the most intense and fierce fighting of the war. When [FROM.GetNameDefCap] asserted their full control over the city of New York, the Brooklyn Naval Yard was eventually rebuilt and refurbished (despite extensive war-time damage) to fulfil their naval capacities. Due to the necessity of maintaining the Royal Navy, our government has approached [FROM.GetNameDef] about their willingness to lease the dockyard. Unfortunately, our offer has been turned down. The government of [FROM.GetNameDefCap] has cited their own necessary purposes for their dockyard and have also sternly reminded our government, that despite the contribution we provided them in the American Civil War, they are unwilling to provide American land for our utilisation. Accordingly, we will have to continue developing our own naval capabilities on our own soil."
 entente.281.a: "Unfortunate!"

 #ACW - CAN ends lease
 entente.282.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Returns Brooklyn Yard"
 entente.282.d: "With their conflict overseas over, the Canadian Government has formally approached us today regarding the status of the Brooklyn Naval Yard. They are extremely thankful for the aid that we have provided them in allowing us to utilise the naval facilities for their own construction purposes and are most of all, thankful that the labour pool drawn to aid them came from the American nation. However, with their conflict now over, they no longer have any purpose in maintaining control of the naval yard. In the spirit of our strong alliance, they have formally ended their lease to the Brooklyn Naval Yard, returning this valuable dockyard of liberty to the American nation."
 entente.282.a: "A debt repaid!"

 #CAN - ACW ends lease
 entente.283.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Recquistions The Brooklyn Yard"
 entente.283.d: "A message came from the American government today that our lease to the Brooklyn Naval Yard has now been terminated. This comes as a result of [FROM.GetNameDef]'s' current state of war requiring that all of their naval facilities be utilised to their utmost potential in order to facilitate mass construction of warships, submarines, and aircraft carriers in the newly revived American navy. As such, while they value our friendship and alliance, they have cited that their current efforts require that our lease be terminated as they need all hands on deck for their coming storm. While this is regretful to hear, we wish them the best of luck in their endeavors and will do what we can to aid them in their conflict."
 entente.283.a: "Understandable given the circumstances."

 CAN_create_naval_research_group: "Create Joint Naval Programme"
 entente.284.t: "Joint Naval Programme Created"
 entente.284.d: "Both the United States Navy and the Royal Navy are distinguishable in their long-standing naval histories and experience throughout the world. The Royal Navy has always been the premier world navy especially in regards to maintaining control and protection of the former British Empire. When the British Revolution occurred, most of the experienced naval commanders of the former United Kingdom managed to flee to Canada with a large portion of their former fleet. Since then, they have maintained the quality and tradition of the Royal Navy - making them worthy heirs of the United Kingdom's former navy.\n\nThe United States Navy has long been the darling of its armed forces. First established in the American Revolutionary War, it has remained one of the largest and modern parts of the American Armed Forces up until the Second American Civil War. Most of the naval commanders from [FROM.GetNameDefCap] earned invaluable experience fighting on the high seas or partaking in blockade operations during the civil war.\n\nIn order to strengthen the bonds between our two countries and to modernise both countries' respective fleets, the Canadian Government and [FROM.GetNameDefCap] have agreed to create a new naval think tank. This collaboration seeks to not only modernise the navies of the Entente but also to share ideas on how to develop new ships and tactics with the advice from our engineers and shipbuilders. Together, we can push the boundaries of what is possible and ensure the freedom and liberty of the seas."
 entente.284.a: "Together for victory!"

 entente.300.t: "Cooperation with the Entente?"
 entente.300.d: "Many of our military experts believe our war against the Third Internationale will be a difficult one to win without some additional force applying pressure to the syndicalists. Fortunately, the experts in [From.GetNameDef] appear to agree. They have suggested that we meet with leaders from the [From.GetFactionName], now that they are also at war with [FRA.GetNameDef], and discuss the possibility we might work together. An alliance is out of the question, of course. What is the question is how much their cooperation is worth, considering they must fight the syndicalists anyhow."
 entente.300.a: "Let us meet - we'll help them however we can"
 entente.300.b: "We don't need their help"

 entente.301.t: "Germany Refuses to Talk"
 entente.301.d: "The Germans apparently believe they don't need our help, or they think talking is worth little since we have to fight the syndicalists anyhow. Whatever the reason, they have declined to meet with us to discuss cooperation. The idea is done before it began."
 entente.301.a: "Ah well"

 entente.302.t: "Germany Agrees to Talk"
 entente.302.d: "Apparently the [From.GetAdjective] government believes as we do: cooperation between those with mutual enemies could prove beneficial. They will meet with us and fellow Entente leaders in [CAN.GetConferenceLocation] in one week's time."
 entente.302.a: "Excellent"

 entente.303.t: "The Entente and Reichspakt to Meet"
 entente.303.d: "With both the Entente and the Reichspakt now at war with the Third Internationale, [ENT.GetNameDef] has called for a conference between their leaders in the [ENT.GetAdjective] city of [ENT.GetConferenceLocation] in order to discuss the possibility of cooperation... and [GER.GetNameDef] has agreed. While it is currently unclear how far such 'cooperation' would go, it seems worth the attempt. A representative from [This.GetNameDef] has been asked to attend."
 entente.303.a: "We'll be there!"

 entente.304.t: "The [ENT.GetConferenceLocation] Conference"
 entente.304.d: "Leaders from the Entente and the Reichspakt gathered in [ENT.GetConferenceLocation] today in order to discuss the possibility of cooperation in the war against the Third Internationale. What this cooperation would consist of was not difficult to ascertain: military and naval access between all members, but - more importantly, for the Entente - the willingness on the part of the Reichspakt to stay out of both France and Great Britain once the war is done. This would allow for a swift return to Europe for the French and British exile governments, the ultimate goal of both, but now a single question hangs over the conference: would [GER.GetNameDef] even agree to such terms, and if so what would they ask in return?"
 entente.304.a: "That's an excellent question"

 entente.305.t: "Our Demands"
 entente.305.d: "Staying out of both France and Great Britain in the peace conference following our future victory would mean [GER.GetNameDef] walking away from a long and costly war with little to show for it - and possibly two restored neighbours who we have vanquished previously and who have no reason to be fond of us. We cannot rely on their gratitude... so do we even consider the idea? What do we ask for in return?"
 entente.305.t.return: "Do We Demand More?"
 entente.305.d.return: "We have made it this far in the negotiations. Do we demand more concessions from the Entente, or have we reached a successful conclusion to the treaty?"
 entente.305.a: "The French must publicly renounce their claim to Alsace-Lorraine"
 entente.305.b: "After they return to Paris, the French must join Mitteleuropa"
 entente.305.c: "They must recognise their former colonies in Africa and Asia as ours"
 entente.305.e: "The British must renounce their claim to Northern Ireland"
 entente.305.f: "Let us proceed to the treaty"
 entente.305.g: "This discussion is pointless - we will never cooperate"

 entente.306.t: "The Conference Goes Nowhere"
 entente.306.d: "It appears it was barely worth the delegates even coming to [ENT.GetConferenceLocation]. While the Germans initially appeared willing to talk, the idea of completely staying out of both France and Great Britain didn't appeal. They claimed they would come out of a long and costly war with nothing to show for it, and none of the delegates could convince them anything the Entente would part with would be worth their while. The delegates from the Reichspakt are already returning home, and the [ENT.GetConferenceLocation] Conference has been deemed an utter failure."
 entente.306.a: "They asked for too much!"
 entente.306.b: "What a waste of time"

 entente.307.t: "The [ENT.GetConferenceLocation] Conference: Alsace-Lorraine"
 entente.307.d: "The German delegates at the [ENT.GetConferenceLocation] Conference have come up with a demand in exchange for their cooperation: that our government publicly renounce all future claims to Alsace-Lorraine. It's no surprise, really, and while there's nothing to stop us from re-claiming it after the war is done it will certainly appear like an illegitimate act. Our allies might not even support us in such an endeavour. Or perhaps the Germans just wish us to humiliate ourselves, to renounce something everyone knows is ours, for cooperation they probably need as much as we do."
 entente.307.a: "We will never renounce Alsace-Lorraine!"
 entente.307.b: "Very well, we agree"

 entente.308.t: "[NFA.GetNameDefCap] Refuses"
 entente.308.d: "Unsurprisingly, the [NFA.GetAdjective] delegate has refused to give up their claim to Alsace-Lorraine - not even for the help they desperately need to return to the continent. They are too proud to give up a claim to something they cannot possibly hope to recover."
 entente.308.a: "That's it for the conference, then"
 entente.308.b: "We'll put this demand aside, for now"

 entente.309.t: "[NFA.GetNameDefCap] Renounces Alsace-Lorraine"
 entente.309.d: "Shockingly, the [NFA.GetAdjective] delegates have agreed - after much discussion with the Germans - to publicly renounce their claim to Alsace-Lorraine... if the Germans agree to the [ENT.GetConferenceLocation] Conference's treaty of cooperation. Considering the humiliation involved for the French to do so, it speaks much of how much they believe the treaty will help their return to the continent."
 entente.309.a: "That is a relief"
 entente.309.b: "A sweet admission on their part"
 entente.309.c: "We have little choice"
 entente.309.e: "How unexpected"
 entente.309.f: "For the sake of Frenchmen elsewhere, we must..."

 entente.310.t: "The [ENT.GetConferenceLocation] Conference: Mitteleuropa"
 entente.310.d: "The German delegates at the [ENT.GetConferenceLocation] Conference have come up with a demand in exchange for their cooperation: once we have returned to Paris, we will join Mitteleuropa - the German economic union. No doubt they wish to ensure they economically dominate us as we rebuild the country... though rebuilding would also go much more quickly with their assistance, it's true. Do we swallow this pill? It's not impossible that we could simply refuse once Paris is ours, though there will undoubtedly be consequences for doing so."
 entente.310.a: "No, we will not surrender our independence"
 entente.310.b: "Very well, we agree"

 entente.311.t: "[NFA.GetNameDefCap] Refuses"
 entente.311.d: "It seems the French will not even accept an offered hand of assistance, believing that membership in Mitteleuropa would allow us to economically dominate their country. And they are correct, of course. Surely they did not think we'd allow France to restore itself without us having some kind of control? Now we must ask ourselves whether this is worth ending the conference over."
 entente.311.a: "It certainly is!"
 entente.311.b: "No, we must press forward"

 entente.312.t: "[NFA.GetNameDefCap] Agrees to Join Mitteleuropa"
 entente.312.d: "The German delegation has demanded that [NFA.GetNameDef] agree to join Mitteleuropa, the German economic union, after Paris has been regained. Most present at the conference believe the Germans intend to have some form of economic control over the French as they rebuild their country, but possibly their offer is benign. Whatever the motivation, the French delegation have agreed: when the time comes, they will join Mitteleuropa as requested."
 entente.312.a: "Ah, good"
 entente.312.b: "We'll believe it when we see it"
 entente.312.c: "How humiliating"
 entente.312.e: "Interesting"
 entente.312.f: "The unfortunate price for our homecoming..."

 entente.313.t: "The [ENT.GetConferenceLocation] Conference: Our Former Colonies"
 entente.313.d: "The German delegates at the conference have a demand: essentially, that the British and French colonies in Africa and Southeast Asia which Germany gained after the First Weltkrieg be recognised as theirs. It's a symbolic move, perhaps, but the Germans would like to forestall any attempts on our part to re-establish our old empires in those regions once our power is regained. That we would even be prepared to go to war for our far-flung colonies is hard to imagine, but - even so - the idea of abandoning them completely does sting."
 entente.313.a: "We will not abandon our colonies"
 entente.313.b: "They have already been lost"

 entente.314.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Refuses"
 entente.314.d: "Interestingly, even though the British and French colonies in Africa and Southeast Asia have been lost for decades, now, [From.GetNameDef] has still refused to let them go. They would be 'abandoning' their former charges, as they see it, and will not relinquish even their moral claim to their colonies. Now we must decide whether this is enough to end the conference over. It is not, after all, like their refusal to recognise our colonies means they are any less ours."
 entente.314.a: "Clearly they do not want cooperation enough"
 entente.314.b: "It was a minor matter - let's move on"

 entente.315.t: "German Colonies Recognised"
 entente.315.d: "The French and British colonies gained by the Germans since the First Weltkrieg have been a sticking point - some annexed, others occupied 'temporarily' due to the lack of what the Germans claimed was a competent government to administer them. Now the Germans have demanded the colonies in Africa and Southeast Asia be officially recognised as theirs, forestalling future efforts to see them restored, and the Entente has agreed. It's a symbolic gesture, perhaps, but one that could prevent a great deal of conflict in the future."
 entente.315.a: "It will be worth it"
 entente.315.b: "Good"
 entente.315.c: "Just get us to Paris"
 entente.315.e: "Interesting"

 entente.316.t: "The [ENT.GetConferenceLocation] Conference: Northern Ireland"
 entente.316.d: "The German delegates have done something unexpected: after discussion with their Irish allies, they have presented a demand from us - the British government must renounce future claims to Northern Ireland. It is no small thing, effectively annulling the Acts of Union and breaking apart the United Kingdom once and for all. Considering the Irish were never planning on relinquishing the land without a war, perhaps it is best that the question be settled now."
 entente.316.a: "We won't be forced into this, not by Germany"
 entente.316.b: "So be it, we agree"

 entente.317.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Refuses"
 entente.317.d: "The British government has refused to give on the matter of Northern Ireland. Annulling the Acts of Union which created the United Kingdom, they say, is too large a matter to be decided here and now - the British delegates question whether they even have the authority to make such a promise. The Irish delegates are, of course, infuriated."
 entente.317.a: "Too bad, we're done"
 entente.317.b: "We won't end this for Ireland's sake"

 entente.318.t: "The British Renounce Northern Ireland"
 entente.318.d: "Today has caused much uproar at the [ENT.GetConferenceLocation] Conference: the German delegates, acting on behalf of their Irish allies, have demanded that the British renounce all claims to Northern Ireland. Even so it would annul the Acts of Union which created the United Kingdom, the British delegates have agreed to do so. They do not wish to war with the Irish, of all people, and while they have said the matter should in the end rest with the citizens of Northern Ireland themselves, they will not personally press British claims."
 entente.318.a: "It had to be done"
 entente.318.b: "I cannot believe they agreed to that"
 entente.318.c: "Hah! I bet they renege!"
 entente.318.e: "A difficult choice"
 entente.318.f: "Astounding!"

 entente.319.t: "Reichspakt and Entente Will Cooperate"
 entente.319.d: "After meeting in a conference in the [ENT.GetAdjective] city of [ENT.GetConferenceLocation], representatives from the Entente and the Reichspakt have worked out a deal to cooperate in their war against the Third Internationale. The main terms of the deal involve both sides having military and naval access to the other, but - more importantly - [GER.GetNameDef] has agreed that, once the syndicalists have been beaten, they will take no territory in France or Great Britain and thus allow both the French and British exiled governments a swift return to Europe.\n\nSources at the [ENT.GetConferenceLocation] Conference say that the Germans elicited a host of promises from Entente leaders, though it remains to be seen whether - once the war is done, should they prove victorious - either side ultimately intends to keep them."
 entente.319.a: "Hurrah!"
 entente.319.b: "This will make things easier"
 entente.319.c: "There is hope, after all"
 entente.319.e: "A pointless exercise which will benefit no-one"

While there was initially progress, ultimately the German demand that the French relinquish their claim to Alsace-Lorraine, lost to the Germans in 1871, was refused and proved to be the breaking point.\n\nThe French departed [ENT.GetConferenceLocation] in anger, with the Germans leaving soon afterwards, and the conference declared a disappointing failure.

In brilliantly conducted coordinated naval and air invasions, the [FROM.FROM.GetAdjective] - humiliated just a few decades ago by former allies and enemies alike - have successfully driven the forces of the worldwide Entente alliance from the Pacific basin. The battered losers, reeling from their defeat, must place their hope entirely on the reconquest of Europe, but in diplomatic centres of power it is already commonplace to remark that the sun has finally set on the British Empire."
 entente.351.a: "Western Imperialism has been defeated."
 entente.351.b: "We suffer yet another defeat..."
 entente.351.c: "A grave defeat."
 entente.351.e: "The Entente is crumbling!"

 entente.352.t: "Albert's Impediment"
 entente.352.d: "It is no secret that Prince Albert, the Duke of York, has troubles. Born on a sad day for the Royal Family, and seemingly under a bad sign, Albert has always lived in the shadow of his brother Edward. It is an unavoidable fact however that the intense pressures upon the exiles, and his brother's many shortcomings, mean Albert cannot afford to provide anything less than his total commitment.\n\nWhile he is rightly known for his diligence and humility, his history of illness, hatred of public speaking and infamous speech impediment have unfairly tainted his reputation as a leader. Nonetheless, having overcome adversity to serve his country admirably in the past, he is resolved to do all he can to serve his family and people in the hour of their greatest need.\n\nAfter yet another failed treatment plan, the royal couple are looking for specialist help once more. They must do so quietly however, lest they lose face to an apprehensive public.\n\nWhile their best chance for discretion is to continue seeking help from within the exile community and assemble a brain trust of ex-Harley Street types, perhaps a new perspective is warranted? \n\nThe University of Toronto has begun plans to refine and standardise the study of “Speech Therapy”. Not only are Canadian specialists the obvious alternative but it might also help to show the appreciation and respect we have for our hosts. However through his father's personal secretary, Albert has recently learned of an aspiring Australian actor and amateur elocutionist who has been making waves among the veteran communities of Ontario for his dedicated treatments. While his efforts seem noble, many of our more established experts dismiss him as a quack and an opportunist."
 entente.352.a: "We must not lose faith in our countrymen, assemble a brain trust."
 entente.352.b: "Let us see what progress our Canadian cousins have made."
 entente.352.c: "The establishment has failed us, send for this Australian chap, post-haste!"

 entente.353.t: "Rome Wasn't Built in a Day..."
 entente.353.d: "Nothing comes quickly in medicine, especially regarding something as complex as speech. After all, if the brain were so simple we could understand it, we would be so simple we couldn't.\n\nWhile the Duke is understandably irritated by this slow progress and is reluctant to continue, the appointed brain trust of exiled professionals are confident that a breakthrough will come in time. While they may not be the freshest or most up-to-date of specialists, they have a century of experience between them and, when they do all agree on a course of action, use only the best tried-and-tested efforts.\n\nHis Majesty's progress may be slow, but it could certainly be worse."
 entente.353.a: "Damn these old fools and their ridiculous marbles..."

 entente.354.t: "Lionel Logue"
 entente.354.d: "In the months that the Duke of York has been meeting with Mr Logue, he has found his guidance to be invaluable and has quickly taken to this eccentric “Speech Therapist” and his amateur dramatics. Though initially dismissed as a quack, his self-taught methods and superhuman patience have worked wonders and, what's more, the two have struck up a friendship.\n\nNot only have His Majesty's public speaking skills improved but so have his confidence and outlook. Already Lionel Logue has become a familiar presence at the royal household and he and his family even attended the royal family's christmas dinner. While Logue's pioneering methods have been essential in ensuring this good progress, it is the love and support of his wife Elizabeth and his family that have made it all possible.\n\nEven with the bleak situation faced by the British exiles, Albert is relieved to be making this personal progress and stands readier than ever to do his duty.\n\nAs Lionel requests another round of Shakespeare recitation and places headphones upon the Duke's head, Albert breathes deep..."
 entente.354.a: "Now is the winter of our discontent, made glorious summer by this sun of York"
 entente.354.a.tt: "Should Albert find himself in a position of greater responsibility, he will be better prepared for the burdens of leadership."

 entente.355.t: "A Leaky Ship"
 entente.355.d: "While initially promising, the visits to the royals by specialists from the faculty of the University of Toronto did not go unnoticed. This was expected to some degree and while most Canadian and British journalists have been hesitant to publish any revealed details, American and French-language articles on the subject are easy to obtain.\n\nTo add insult to injury however, it appears that a doctoral student of an assisting psychologist has given information to the press detailing Albert's struggles with speech and even some references to his childhood! \n\nTogether with Edward's controversial outspokenness and rumours of George's debauched lifestyle, this has severely damaged the royal tradition of aloof, restrained leadership.\n\nWhile the head of the department has given his deepest apologies, and the student has been appropriately disciplined, Albert and his staff are uncomfortable at the prospect of continuing their relationship with the university. For now it seems he and the Duchess of York are back to square one..."
 entente.355.a: "It takes a year to build a university, it takes 100 to build a tradition..."

 entente.356.t: "Ready to Lead"
 entente.356.d: "Bertie Windsor, who has endured so much trouble in his life and was never expected to wield much responsibility, is now the moral leader, symbol and guardian for millions of people. While many is the time he dreaded being in such a position, and ever-present is his hatred of public speaking, he is emboldened by the invaluable therapy of Lionel Logue, the love and support of his family, and his own stubborn determination to do the best he can."
 entente.356.a: "England expects that every man will do his duty."
