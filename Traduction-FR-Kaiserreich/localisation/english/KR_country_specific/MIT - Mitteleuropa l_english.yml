Its internal structure is complicated, but its key institutions are the §HMitteleuropa Conference§!, a summit of delegates from all member states that takes place every six months, and the §HMitteleuropa Commission§!, a bureaucratic authority controlled by the member states whose §HPresidency§! is reelected by each Conference.\n\nIn the Mitteleuropa §HTab§!, you are able to see the President country, all member states, and a list of possible §HAgendas§! to propose for the next Conference. Each member state is able to invest §HPolitical Power§! to promote their Agenda of choice or try to be elected the next §HMitteleuropa President§!. At the end of the cycle and the beginning of the next Conference, the President will select and activate §Htwo§! Agendas from the three most supported Agendas - as well as their own Agenda, if they selected any. Then, a new President election will take place and the cycle continues.\n\nAs the founder and most powerful country, §H[GER.GetNameWithFlag]§! has access to a focus tree to unlock new Agenda types and initiate Mitteleuropa reform - as well as §Hbend the conference to their favour...§!\n\nThe Presidency of Mitteleuropa is held by §Y[MIT.GetNameWithFlag]§!\nThe next meeting of the Mitteleuropa Commission will happen in roughly §Y[GER.GetMitteleuropaNextElection]§!."

 germany_mitteleuropa_events.6.d: "Concerning news have arrived from the Mitteleuropa Commission - [MIT_next_chairman.GetNameDef] has spearheaded a vote of no confidence on our leadership. Due to various frustrations with our leadership, this challenge has gotten a large enough support among the member states that we have to address it. We can accept this challenge and allow the election of a new chairman - however, should we hold a lot of influence ourselves, we can simply ignore the challenge."
 germany_mitteleuropa_events.6.a: "Concede defeat."

 germany_mitteleuropa_events.7.d.new_leader: "We have succeeded. After lengthy debates within the Mitteleuropa Conference, the previous chairman, representing [MIT_previous_chairman.GetNameDef], has resigned and allowed a representative from our country to be elected as his successor. We now have control over Mitteleuropa's proceedings."

 germany_mitteleuropa_events.8.d.new_leader: "A challenge to the incumbent Chairman of the Mitteleuropa Commission, representing [MIT_previous_chairman.GetNameDef], led by us, has been ignored despite it getting a majority of support. They were forced to expend significant resources during the challenge, but remain in power."

 germany_mitteleuropa_events.11.d.not_voted_yet: "The next Mitteleuropa conference is set to take place within the next month. Given that there will be a number of competing agendas discussed, it would be wise if we make a decision soon on what we should support at the conference."
 germany_mitteleuropa_events.11.d.last_chance: "The next Mitteleuropa conference is set to take place within the next month. Given that there will be a number of competing agendas discussed, it would be wise to make sure we have supported the best option for us at the conference."

 germany_mitteleuropa_events.20.d.defunct: "As a result of our membership of Mitteleuropa, we became incredibly integrated into the bloc, taking on a number of obligations while also receiving some benefits such as in trade and mutual defence. These agreements no longer stand. Germany has fallen, and so the Mitteleuropa union no longer constrains us by any measure."

Any designs we might have had towards their country have to be abandoned for the time being."
 germany_mitteleuropa_events.21.d.allied_with_rival: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] has severed the last of its ties with Mitteleuropa today - their government has chosen to leave our sphere of influence and turn towards one of our rivals.

 germany_mitteleuropa_events.1000.t: "The Central European Customs Union Returns to Activity"
 germany_mitteleuropa_events.1000.d: "After the beginning of the economic crisis caused by the Black Monday stock market crash caused Germany to draw its attention away from foreign affairs for the past year, the Central European Customs Union, more commonly known as Mitteleuropa, has returned back to action. Once again, summits of the foreign affairs ministers of the organisation are being held, each one with the intention of coordinating the economies of the alliance and facilitating easier flow of goods. Over time, Mitteleuropa expanded to several official and unofficial fields of activity - and the interests of the member states may take it to aid in one field or another.\n\nOf course, certain intellectuals and politicians envision a bit more, and dream of the chance to reform the organisation and create something new... A German economic hegemony? A fulfillment of pan-European dreams? Time will tell."

 germany_mitteleuropa_events.1002.t: "The Directive System"
 germany_mitteleuropa_events.1002.d: "The Mitteleuropa Conference has approved the implementation of a Directive system to organise the work of the institutions overseeing Mitteleuropa's bureaucratic authorities. Directives are resolutions by the Mitteleuropa Commission on some goals or projects - they are mandatory to reach in some time, but their implementation falls on the member states independently, retaining their autonomy in domestic affairs. This will improve the efficiency of Mitteleuropa somewhat."
 germany_mitteleuropa_events.1002.a: "Understood."

 germany_mitteleuropa_events.1003.t: "The Mitteleuropa Court"
 germany_mitteleuropa_events.1003.d: "The Mitteleuropa Commission has established a supranational court which will be tasked with interpreting conflicts between national law and the terms of the membership in our common market. In addition, their collection of respected legal scholars will be able to aid member states in harmonising their legal systems with each other, should they ever ask."
 germany_mitteleuropa_events.1003.a: "Understood."

 germany_mitteleuropa_events.1004.t: "The Regulation System"
 germany_mitteleuropa_events.1004.d: "The Mitteleuropa Conference has approved the implementation of a Regulation system to organise the work of the institutions overseeing Mitteleuropa's bureaucratic authorities. Regulations are resolutions by the Mitteleuropa Commission which are mandatory to follow for all member states no matter their stance on the policy. This will improve the efficiency of Mitteleuropa somewhat, but also expand German influence."
 germany_mitteleuropa_events.1004.a: "Understood."

 germany_mitteleuropa_events.1005.t: "Growing Mitteleuropa Bureaucracy in Berlin"
 germany_mitteleuropa_events.1005.d: "The Mitteleuropa Commission has began moving almost all of the bureaucratic institutions of the organisation into Berlin, and more and more of the civil servants employed in the organisation are now hired from German clerks in the city. This has begun shifting the interests of the organisation more and more towards German interests, which has tipped the balance in German favour."
 germany_mitteleuropa_events.1005.a: "Understood."

 germany_mitteleuropa_events.1006.t: "The Enforcement Directorate"
 germany_mitteleuropa_events.1006.d: "The Mitteleuropa Conference has approved the creation of an Enforcement Directorate of Mitteleuropa. This directorate will be tasked with observing the implementation of Regulations in all member states, and will have the ability to reprimand states as well as establish sanctions on member states which do not fulfil the imposed Regulations. This will increase German control over Mitteleuropa."
 germany_mitteleuropa_events.1006.a: "Understood."

 germany_mitteleuropa_events.1007.t: "Conferential Control of Institutions"
 germany_mitteleuropa_events.1007.d: "The Mitteleuropa Conference has approved changes to the appointment of important officials in the bureaucratic institutions of Mitteleuropa. Instead of being appointed with the sole prerogative of the President, they will now require the approval of the Consultative Assembly, which means that the parliamentarians and representatives of Mitteleuropa states will have greater say in the direction of the bloc."
 germany_mitteleuropa_events.1007.a: "Understood."

 germany_mitteleuropa_events.1008.t: "The European Free Travel Area"
 germany_mitteleuropa_events.1008.d: "The Mitteleuropa Conference has approved the creation of the Central European Free Travel Area - an additional layer to Mitteleuropa's institutions. This organisation would mandate all member states to scale down border control on the internal borders of the bloc, allowing trade and traffic between states to travel mostly unimpeded. Document checks and other security measures will still exist, but this reform will greatly reduce the regulations and waiting time in journeys between member states, both for goods as well as for private citizens."

 germany_mitteleuropa_events.1008.b: "We would like to opt out."

 germany_mitteleuropa_events.1009.t: "The Europamark"
 germany_mitteleuropa_events.1009.d: "The Mitteleuropa Conference has approved the creation of the Europamark - a reserve currency for the Mitteleuropa bloc. This would be a common trading currency which would be used for transactions between the member states of the bloc, easing the trade between them and increasing the fairness of trade - as no member state would have to worry about getting ripped off by unfair currency exchange rates."
 germany_mitteleuropa_events.1009.a: "We will join the Europamark network."
 germany_mitteleuropa_events.1009.b: "We would like to opt out."

 germany_mitteleuropa_events.1010.t: "The Bank of Central Europe"
 germany_mitteleuropa_events.1010.d: "The Mitteleuropa Conference has approved the creation of the Bank of Central Europe - a central bank for the Mitteleuropa economic bloc. To avoid the distortion of the market by unequal fiscal policy, the Bank would be an institution tasked with creating a common fiscal policy for all Mitteleuropa members who join the Bank - such as a minimum interest rate level among member states. It would also be able to provide low-interest loans for development, and advise member states on financial policy."
 germany_mitteleuropa_events.1010.a: "We will become a member of the Bank of Central Europe."
 germany_mitteleuropa_events.1010.b: "We would like to opt out."
