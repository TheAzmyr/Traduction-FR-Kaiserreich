### Intro Screen ###
 COL_country_intro_header: "Colombia's Place in the World"
 COL_country_intro_content: "Weakened by civil wars (especially 1899 - 1903), Colombia had to acknowledge U.S. rights of control of the Panamá Canal in the Hay-Bunan-Varilla Treaty of 1903, ending the conflict between the two countries about the building of the Canal. When the Colombian Congress refused to ratify the treaty the United States forced the secession of Panamá from Colombia, compensating them between 1921 and 1930 with a payment of a total 25 million Dollars. Colombia formally recognised Panamá in 1921.\n\nThe conservatives pursued the modernisation of the country, expanding the railroad network. Since 1850 Colombia had been exporting tobacco, after 1900 coffee and bananas were added (with the aid of U.S. capital), after 1905 petroleum. The liberals formed a government in 1930 which enacted a land reform, dispossessing big landowners, and social reforms, with economic benefits for the middle class, the workers' class and the peasants."

More extreme factions from both sides have splintered and are also running mainly the socialist UNIR led by the charismatic Jorge Eliécer Gaitán, and sporadic violence between them and the right have emerged. From the sidelines, Gustavo Rojas Pinilla, fresh returned from his trip to Mitteleuropa to secure defence contracts, worryingly believes that the very fabric of the Republic may be at risk..."
