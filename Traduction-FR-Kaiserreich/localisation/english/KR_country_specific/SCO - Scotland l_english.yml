 SCO_john_maccormick: "John MacCormick"
 SCO_john_maccormick_leader_desc: "§YBorn:§! §LNovember 20th, 1904, in Glasgow, Lanarkshire, Scotland§!\n§YBackground:§! §LJohn MacCormick rose from being a barely notable legal professional and activist to the forefront of the Scottish independence debate, becoming the main centrist figure and uniting that niche in a sea of leftist agitation. MacCormick's political flexibility would cost him his freedom and be arrested for counter-revolutionary activities, though his unmatched charisma would allow him to lead the NPS even from prison, causing its fracture. Now back in power, Scotland's own 'King' wields immense power through pure charm and his sympathetic attitude, eager to embark on a plan to build a united and progressive Scotland.§!"

 SCO_arthur_donaldson_leader_desc: "§YBorn:§! §LDecember 13th, 1901, in Dundee, Angus, Scotland§!\n§YBackground:§! §LA native of Dundee, Arthur Donaldson has had an unlikely life, initially leaving school to become an assistant registrar before becoming a Dundee Journalist. After a five year-stint in the United States working for Chrysler, Donaldson would return to Scotland in 1928 to campaign for the NPS and quickly become a close associate of John MacCormick. Attempting a career as a freelance journalist and poultry farmer in the Union of Britain, Donaldson would face continued harassment from the security forces and become increasingly anti-socialist. Despite following Douglas Young into the SNP, he would quickly carve out his own rightist and pro-collaborationist faction. Now in charge, Donaldson will do whatever is necessary to protect Scotland from British tyranny.§!"

Upon release from prison, Gallacher joined the Glasgow Trades Council, part of the greater British Trade Union Movement, and organised it into an effective militia force during the revolution.\n\nNow in charge of his native Scotland, he will no doubt pursue an orthodox syndicalist course.§!"
