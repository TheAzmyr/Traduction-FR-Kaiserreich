With the M.O.J. abolished, the question of the future of the Suez returns once more to the forefront. Uncertainty remains with regard to the identity of the future guardians of the Canal, even as in the Suez Zone itself, companies are awaiting funds to clear the Suez blockade.\n\nAll nations who have accepted the §YPort Said Convention§! receive access to the §YReparation Effort§! decisions which contribute to a shared timer."

### Syrian Integration
 OTT_Handling_Suriye: "Centralisation of the Syrian Lands"
 OTT_Handling_Suriye_desc: "§YIntegration of Syrian Vilayets§! : §G[?OTT.syr_integration_factor]%§!\n\n(When §YIntegration of Syrian Vilayets§! reaches §G50%§!, the Syrian states can be upgraded to §YVilayet§! status and when it reaches more than §G100%§!, they can be upgraded to §YOttoman Province§! status)\n\nFor more info over the Greater Syria region and its relation to the Porte, hover over the §CQuestion Mark§!."
 OTT_Syria_Tooltip_GUI: "The Vilayets of Syria stretch out from the city of Aleppo in the North to the deserts of Ma'an and serve as the centre point of §RArab Resistance§! to Ottoman authority.\n\nFrom all the Arab holdings in the Empire, Syria was always seen as the most important which was reflected in its relative economic power. It is also the most politically active region in the Mashriq with the centre of §CBeirut§! and §CDamascus§! forming the forefront of developing §RArab nationalism§!. One can however not pinpoint where Anatolia ends and Syria begins as the intricate mingling of population groups has made Greater Syria one of the most diverse regions in the world, forming the home to over a dozen religions and ethnicities. This §YSectarian Tapestry§! has hindered the development of a fully Arab nationalist character and the promotion of a §GRegionalist Character§!. Aleppo, Beirut, Damascus, Homs, etc. all form their own communities with their own goals and ambitions which has led to constant political bickering. This constant fighting between cities and powerful families has in the last few years started to pave the way towards an initial attempt at bringing mass politics and populism to the common people. Successes for now remain limited but the influence from the §RInternationale§! and §RFar-right movements§! on the European continent are flowing through the cosmopolitan city of §CBeirut§!."

 OTT_SYR_Abolish_Lebanon: "Abolish the Mutasarrifate of Mt. Lebanon"
 OTT_SYR_Abolish_Lebanon_desc: "For most of its history under Turkic rule, Lebanon was an autonomous emirate governed across the years by Druze clans that pledged loyalty to the Sultan. The favouritism for Druze dynasties in positions of power and granting privileges to Muslim sects soon alienated the vast population of Christians around Mount Lebanon, particularly the Maronites. A series of revolts in the 18th and 19th century culminated in open civil war between Christians and Druze, which transpired simultaneously with the ongoing Tanzimat reforms and the attendant increase in political meddling by Western imperial powers in the Ottoman Empire's internal affairs. The end result was the Ottomans conceding to European and Maronite demands to grant Christians an autonomous province of their own.\n\nThe First Mutasarrifate of Mount Lebanon did not last long, however. It was notorious for its Byzantine bureaucracy and the overbearing role that foreign powers played in the region's internal government. When war arrived on Turkish shores in 1915, Djemal Pasha abolished the autonomous status of the region and forced it into his own Syrian fiefdom. For the Lebanese people, the war would become one of the darkest periods in their history, with a famine claiming the lives of over 100,000 citizens and the cedar trees on which the citizens prided themselves being cut down to fuel the Hejaz Railway.\n\nMilitary government would remain the order of the day in Mount Lebanon until 1921, when after heavy international and local pressure the region was restored to Mutasarrifate status. The strong foreign interests of prewar Mount Lebanon would be kept at bay, however, by fierce opposition from the Ottoman government and by further global instability.\n\nNonetheless, this restoration of autonomy was seen as a betrayal of the centralist ideals and with tensions rising in the other Mutasarrifates of Jerusalem, Kibris and Basra, the government sees these regions as obstacles to its reforms."
 OTT_SYR_Centralise_Infrastructural_Maintenance: "Integrate Syrian Railroads into the DDY"
 OTT_SYR_Centralise_Infrastructural_Maintenance_desc: "The 'Devlet Demiryolları Umum Müdürlüğü', or State Railways Administration, which was founded during the early twenties and incorporates a vast portion of the Anatolian Railway Network, will be expanded to maintain and extend the Northern Portion of the Hejaz Railway.\n\nTaking over from a wide plethora of smaller companies and foreign concessions, this will greatly increase the efficiency of our targeted railway expansion and will make it easier for Kostantiniyye to exert its authority over the vast territories it governs in the Levant."
 OTT_SYR_Settle_Tribes: "Settle the Southern Syrian Bedouins"
 OTT_SYR_Settle_Tribes_desc: "The Southern Syrian lands around the town of Amman have long escaped Ottoman authority and have been neglected by our predecessors. Mainly used as an access point to the far more important Hejaz, our control over the region is limited to the direct area around the Hejaz Railway and certain pilgrim hotspots along the way to Mecca. This has resulted in a large influx of migrants from Syria, Circassia and even Anatolia which have fled from the conscription and taxation of the North.\n\nNonetheless, the region remains dominated by Bedouin tribes who harass both pilgrims and settlers alike refusing to pay their taxes. To solve this issue, the government has embarked on a large scale settling programme of our Arab tribes both here and other regions scattered around Syria."
 OTT_SYR_Central_Tax_Collection_Agency: "Centralise Tax Collection (Greater Syria)"
 OTT_SYR_Central_Tax_Collection_Agency_desc: "The present structures established within the wider Syrian region have allowed for a wide plethora of sanctioned tax collectors ranging from the Millet level which distinguishes between religion, the Vilayet level which collects a certain amount of taxes based on an approximate geographical location and the city level which collects 'gifts' for the Damascan elite.\n\nAll together this has not only led to great confusion amongst the taxpayers but also outrage as the tax pressure seemingly increases by the day as each level of authority deems itself worthy of more and more income.\n\nTo eradicate this problem, a new plan has been proposed to combine all tax collection within a singular agency located in Beyrut and from there on better regulate the expenses of the local government."
 OTT_SYR_Restrict_Arab_Nationalist_Newspapers: "Restrict Arab Nationalist Newspapers"
 OTT_SYR_Restrict_Arab_Nationalist_Newspapers_desc: "Even though the Arab Revolt ended in a complete failure for the Hashemites and the Arab movement in general, the seeds of Ottoman resistance were planted. A new generation of educated youths has taken it upon themselves as their mission to strive for the creation of an Arab state free from Turkish tutelage and have started to use the media to spread their message across the land. Due to our pitiful literacy rate and the immense distances within our Empire, their message hasn't been able to spread very effectively yet as the ordinary man on the fields has not yet shown a tendency to oppose the Sultan.\n\nThe increasing literacy efforts of the central government though are likely to bring change to this so it may be wise to prevent their message from reaching too many people."
 OTT_SYR_Turkish_Integration_Resettlement_Program: "Implement the Turkish Integration Programme"
 OTT_SYR_Turkish_Integration_Resettlement_Program_desc: "The Northern Vilayets of Syria, especially Halep, have long been closer to the Turkish world than the Arab centre of gravitas located in the Hejaz and Baghdad. Nonetheless the population of these regions is Arab rather than Turkish and their loyalty should a general Arab revolt occur is questionable at best. To remedy this, the government has designed a plan called the Turkish Integration & Resettlement programme which plans to increase Turkish migration to these areas by the sale of government land to those that speak the Ottomanish language.\n\nThis move is likely to anger a vast portion of the Arab population and might reignite new revolts but may in the long run serve as a reliable way to ensure the loyalty of the Vilayet."
 OTT_SYR_Finish_West_Jordan_Irrigation_Project: "Finish the West Jordan Irrigation Project"
 OTT_SYR_Finish_West_Jordan_Irrigation_Project_desc: "Started during the days of the M.O.J, the aim of the West Jordan Irrigation Project is to prevent periods of drought from hitting the hill country surrounding Jerusalem and as such bolster its agricultural potential. With the population of the so-called 'Holy Land' rapidly increasing, its need for arable land has as well. Cooperating with Ottoman authorities and officials, the main funding and expertise behind the project comes from the local 'Yishuv' or Jewish community."
 OTT_SYR_Hunt_Down_Insurgents: "Persecute Palestinian Insurgents"
 OTT_SYR_Hunt_Down_Insurgents_desc: "To secure Jerusalem's and its surrounding Kaza's security, actions must be taken to defeat the roving rebel bands (often composed of deserted Arab or Ottoman troops) that have taken over the countryside. Further complicating this task are the Zionist militias which have grown in size during the conflict, setting themselves up as the first last of defence against invaders targetting their settlements. Of these, the Irgun has proven the most evasive and aggressive with the general leadership of the 'Yishuv' finding themselves incapable of reining them in.\n\nTo counter this threat, the new military governor of Jerusalem has devised a scheme in which extensive gendarmerie units will work in cooperation with the Ottoman army to thoroughly sweep the entire region and restore order."
 OTT_SYR_Ensure_Demographic_Balance: "Regulate Palestinian Immigration"
 OTT_SYR_Ensure_Demographic_Balance_desc: "Unregulated Jewish immigration under the auspices of the International Council formed one of the main reasons for the explosion of violence in the region during the year preceding the Ottoman-Egyptian war and remains a complicated debate in the region. Although the Ottoman government had already attempted to regulate the influx of Zionists prior to the Weltkrieg, it now finds itself after decades of mismanagement presented with a fait accompli. Hundreds of thousands of Zionist settlers have found a home in Palestine and with many siding with our government during the war, Kostantiniyye is uninterested in uprooting the Jewish population.\n\nNonetheless, the continued influx from Europe can no longer be tolerated as it would further upset the fragile peace that has only recently been reintroduced by the Porte. Therefore strict immigration restrictions will be placed on Palestine, forbidding the entry of new settlers (who will instead be redirected to other less developed region of the empire) and a deportation order of the so-called "Af Al Pi" immigrants (associated and sanctioned by the Irgun) given. Weakening the influence of this Zionist militia organisation and satisfying the immediate demands of the non-Jewish population, this should ensure stability and order in the region."

### Hejazi Integration
 OTT_Handling_Arab_Vilayets: "Centralisation of the Arab Peninsula"
 OTT_Handling_Arab_Vilayets_desc: "§YIntegration of Arab Peninsular Vilayets§! : §G[?OTT.hej_integration_factor]%§!\n\n(When §YIntegration of Arab Peninsular Vilayets§! reaches §G50%§!, the Arab Peninsular states can be upgraded to §YVilayet§! status and when it reaches more than §G100%§!, they can be upgraded to §YOttoman Province§! status)\n\nFor more info over the Hejazi region and its relation to the Porte, hover over the §CQuestion Mark§!."
 OTT_Arab_Tooltip_GUI: "Containing the Holy Cities of Medina and Mecca, the vast deserts of inner Arabia and the coastal cities of Jeddah, Qatar and Bahrain, the Arab peninsula is a patchwork of §YEmirates§! and §YTribal Rivalry§!. Not only is Ottoman authority here minimal at best but in the deserts of the interior, war is being waged between the §CRashidi federation§! of the North and the §CSaudis§! in the South. As the focus on §YCentralisation§! of the state and §YConsolidation§! of currently held territory remains, many in the capital have argued that the Peninsula is a §RLost Cause§!, a §RWaste of Time§! and a §RDrain on Resources§! that we do not have and that it would be better to exploit the rivalry of the tribes to keep their attention away from the Empire than to §ROverextend§! ourselves and risk awakening a §RUnited Resistance§!.\n\nThe same cannot be said over the §YHejaz§! However, where the Cities grant the Caliph his §GLegitimacy§! and where the earnings of the Hajj provide a valuable asset to the state coffers. Nevertheless the failed §CHashemite Revolt§! has left its scars and although the Ottoman army ensures the stability of the region, it is commonly referred to by common soldiers as one of the worst postings in the empire. §RTribal Raids§! are a near constant affair and as the birthplace of the revolt, the region also serves as a rallying point for various §RArab 'Freedom' Fighters§! whose anger against the regime fulminates in armed aggression towards its soldiers. The completion of the Hejaz railway and its expansion during the '20s has drastically increased our authority over the region but outside of urban regions, a web of bribery, intimidation and loose alliances with its local rulers provides a §RShaky Balance§!."

 OTT_ARA_Centralise_Tax_Collection: "Centralise Tax Collection (Hejaz)"
 OTT_ARA_Centralise_Tax_Collection_desc: "The Hejaz vilayet has a special status within our Empire as the Holy Cities, the most important cities on the peninsula, and their importance to Islam have kept many of our centralisation policies at bay with even the Young Turks of the CUP unwilling to touch this old institution. This has almost completely exempted the region from taxation and in fact subsidies called 'surre' are even granted from the Ottoman treasury which are distributed to the poor in Mecca and Medina.\n\nOur current Grand Vizier however is far less open to the continued presence of religious authority in matters of the state and has decreed that the region should pay its taxes just like any other vilayet and has ordered an extensive investigation into the region to establish a central agency in Medina."
 OTT_ARA_Salination_Plant: "Expand Desalination Operations"
 OTT_ARA_Salination_Plant_desc: "As the population of the Hejazi cities keeps climbing, the water supply is unable to keep up and in various cities along the Red Sea serious issues are starting to arise. Primitive desalination operations were started in the early 20th century but lack of funds and a focus on Anatolia and Mesopotamia has left the old installations in decline. By utilising new breakthroughs in the scientific field, we should now replace and expand the operation and ensure the Hejazi people have secure access to clean potable water."
 OTT_ARA_Settle_Tribes: "Settle the Hejazi Tribes"
 OTT_ARA_Settle_Tribes_desc: "Although one of the most 'urban' regions on the peninsula, the Hejaz still suffers from an extreme lack of urbanisation. Outside cities such as Medina, Mecca and Jeddah most of the population is still of a migratory nature which makes conducting population counts, conscription and taxation nigh impossible. The sheer size of the region has made much authority impossible outside of the Hejaz railway but by consolidating the population in designated areas, Kostantiniyye hopes to more effectively exert its influence."
 OTT_ARA_Abolish_Sharif: "Abolish the Meccan Sharifate"
 OTT_ARA_Abolish_Sharif_desc: "Dating back to the late Abbasid era, the office of Grand Sharif of Mecca has as task the protection of the Holy Cities and its surrounding territory. During the late 19th century and after the loss of Egypt, the Hejaz was restructured into the Vilayet of Hejaz with an appointed governor or Wāli. Nonetheless the Sharifate was retained which has created a dualist power structure in the region that has endured to this day. Traditionally granted to the Hashemite family, the office came under serious attack when its former tenant Hussein ibn Ali Pasha started the Arab revolt. He was replaced by Irade (imperial decree) in 1916 by Alī Haydar Pāshā who remained loyal to the Sultan throughout the war.\n\nNonetheless the Sharif is growing old and a successor will soon need to be appointed by the Sultan. Centralists within the administration see in this the chance to abolish the ancient office once and for all and solve the governing duality of the region but others have warned that tearing down such an old pillar of Islam may cause serious unrest across the entire Islamic world."
 OTT_ARA_Expand_Dubai_Air_Base: "Expand the Dubai Air Base"
 OTT_ARA_Expand_Dubai_Air_Base_desc: "Serving as a key strategic base for the Ottoman air force, the Dubai air strip was constructed in 1935 to link Iraq to Muscat and from there on India. With the threat of Iranian aggression ever looming, the air strip was accompanied by a military base home to 500 soldiers of the Ottoman army. The needs of this small army quickly established in Dubai a lively economy and proved to be a great boon to the struggling harbour.\n\nThe advent of oil in the Arab Gulf has complicated matters for the Ottoman state as whilst they were previously content with superficial control over the Gulf, it has become clear that the petroleum industry will prove to be a key aspect of the future Ottoman state and total control over the Gulf an absolute requirement. For that purpose, the order has been given to expand the Dubai base and establish similar operations across the Gulf."
 OTT_ARA_Abolish_Trucial_States: "Abolish the Gulf States"
 OTT_ARA_Abolish_Trucial_States_desc: "The Shaykhdoms of the Gulf have long enjoyed a privileged status in the Arab world, maintaining quasi total control over their little fiefdoms without the risk of foreign invasion. When Britain retreated from the Gulf and the Sublime Porte became their new guardian, life continued much as it had before but slowly the foundations were laid for a far closer relation to the Porte than Britain had ever entertained. Now that the importance of the Gulf is becoming clearer by the day, we can no longer risk limited control over its constituents and need to draw decisive lines on the new world map. To this degree the various Shaykhdoms will be abolished, with authority centralised in the new Vilayet of al-Hasa where, headquartered in Hufuf, the Ottoman Governor-Admiral will rule the Gulf. The various Shaykhs will however not immediately be asked to hand over power as even the hardliners realise this would only lead to unrest, war and other unpleasantness. Therefore the various Shaykhdoms will be reorganised into a collection of Kazas and Sanjaks with the Shaykhs appointed as kaymakams where necessary."
 OTT_ARA_Crack_Down_Gulf_Smuggling: "Create the al-Hasa Coast Guard"
 OTT_ARA_Crack_Down_Gulf_Smuggling_desc: "Piracy and smuggling have been a major issue in the Gulf for as long as it has been populated and although British naval operations were able to put a halt to the practice, the war in the Levant and India has seen a massive rise in smuggling as the Shaykh of Dubai fully embraced the practice, establishing his city as the smugglers capital of both the Gulf and the Indian Ocean.\n\nIt is clear that this practice cannot continue as whilst it has proven damaging to our foes, it also greatly harms the security of our own shipping in the Gulf and with the rise of the petroleum industry we can no longer sit idly by whilst our precious cargo is captured by 20th century pirates."

 OTT_ARA_Military_Mission_to_ARA: "Send a Military Mission to [FROM.GetName]"
 OTT_ARA_Military_Mission_to_ARA_desc: "The military reforms undertaken by our empire have led to awe from our neighbours, whose armies still rely on tribal militias with limited training. These nations have now requested experts from Kostantiniyye to assist them in their modernisation programmes, promising great compensation. This could prove risky however as this also increases the strength of these nations with whom we may someday find ourselves at war."

### Greek Integration
 OTT_Handling_Greek_Vilayets: "Centralisation of the Greek Islands"
 OTT_Handling_Greek_Vilayets_desc: "§YIntegration of Greek Insular Vilayets§! : §G[?OTT.gre_integration_factor]%§!\n\n(When §YIntegration of Greek Insular Vilayets§! reaches §G50%§!, the Greek Insular states can be upgraded to §YVilayet§! status and when it reaches more than §G100%§!, they can be upgraded to §YOttoman Province§! status)\n\nFor more info over the Greek Islands region and its relation to the Porte, hover over the §CQuestion Mark§!."
 OTT_Greek_Tooltip_GUI: "Serving as the upper middle class, intellectuals, artisans and landowners, the Greek population of the Empire is in an interesting position within the state structure. Although the Anatolian Greeks are almost fully intertwined with their Turkish counterparts, the islands of the Aegean Coast and the special administrative unit of Cyprus are far less attached to Kostantiniyye.\n\nServing as hubs of §RGreek Nationalist§! rhetoric and often adhering to the dream of '§CMegali§!', these islands have proven themselves tricky to control and out of imperial control for multiple decades. Their return to the Empire after the collapse of first Italy and then the British Empire was not seen by all as a positive development and §RAnti-Ottoman§! rhetoric remains strong."

 OTT_GRE_Abolish_Mutasarrifate: "Abolish the Mutasarrifate of Kibris"
 OTT_GRE_Abolish_Mutasarrifate_desc: "Although an experiment was executed in the late 19th Century when the Mutasarrifate was temporarily abolished and integrated into the Vilayet of the Archipelago, the attempt ultimately failed as the distance to its new capital (Çanakkale) led to a communication and administrative headache. The decision was ultimately reverted in 1870 when it became independent once more.\n\nA peculiar detail to the administrative status of the island is that for the authorities in Kostantiniyye, the Archbishop of the Orthodox Church on the island served as the sole representative of the entire Greek community and de facto serves as their ethnic leader in most matters.\n\nWith the recent reforms however and the grandiose plans of the OHF to abolish all the special and in their belief ancient structures, the status of the island is questioned once more and it is doubtful that Kostantiniyye will continue to govern the region through a religious proxy."
 OTT_GRE_Central_Tax_Collection_Agency: "Centralise Tax Collection (Greek Islands)"
 OTT_GRE_Central_Tax_Collection_Agency_desc: "The present structures established throughout the Greek Isles have allowed for a wide plethora of sanctioned tax collectors ranging from the Millet level which distinguishes between religion, the Vilayet level which collects a certain amount of taxes based on an approximate geographical location and last but not least the OPDA which accounts for our debt repayment.\n\nAll together this has not only led to great confusion amongst the taxpayers but also outrage as the tax pressure seemingly increases by the day as each level of authority deems itself worthy of more and more income.\n\nTo eradicate this problem, a new plan has been proposed to combine all tax collection within a singular agency located in Izmir and from there on better regulate the expenses of the local government."
 OTT_GRE_Turkish_Employement_Program: "Implement the "Employ a Turk" Programme"
 OTT_GRE_Turkish_Employement_Program_desc: "Not only on the Greek isles but also on the mainland, Greek citizens have always taken up high positions within the industry and service industry with doctors, engineers and business owners being mostly Greek. This fairly closed off intellectual advantage has created a large social rift in Ottoman society where the ordinary Anatolian Turk remains stuck in the past and unable to participate in the industrial revolution.\n\nTo improve the status, experience and hopefully skill of these Turks, the government has decreed a new "Employ a Turk" programme where business owners will be encouraged through financial aides to employ and train more of the Turkish population. Some of our non Turkish representatives have however countered this with the argument that this unfairly benefits one group of people which is in sharp contrast to the policy of equality proclaimed by the Party."
 OTT_GRE_Enforce_Turkish_Curriculum: "Enforce State Directed Curriculum"
 OTT_GRE_Enforce_Turkish_Curriculum_desc: "Through the Millet system, the various religious and ethnic minorities of our Empire were able to establish their own distinct education system. In the past this has increasingly led to anti-Ottomanist and nationalist influence creeping into the minds of our children which is proving to be a major thorn in the side of the centralist administration.\n\nEradicating the issue straight at the roots through a standardised curriculum established in Kostantiniyye, we hope to combat this movement and bring the focus back to the Ottomanist ideal. This is sure to anger a vast portion of the Greek population who will see this as an attempt to Turkify their lands and might lead to violent protest should we not be careful."
 OTT_GRE_Crack_Down_Tax_Havens: "Combat Aegean Tax Paradises"
 OTT_GRE_Crack_Down_Tax_Havens_desc: "Through a special construct created after the reconquest of the isles in 1919, the various Aegean Islands have been able to benefit from increased leniency of the tax collectors and have found themselves the regular home of various members of the Ottoman Upper Class. Sprouting majestic villas, large plantations and various other displays of their wealth there are even rumours that the Grand Vizier himself has a home there to repose from the tumult in the capital.\n\nThis has however also led to decreased revenue for the state and in a time where every penny counts and should be accounted for, the Ministry of Finance has announced a plan to send inspectors to the islands to turn over all rocks in search for extra revenue."
 OTT_GRE_Timar_System: "Expand the Timar System"
 OTT_GRE_Timar_System_desc: "Shortly after the conquest of the island by Sultan Selim II, a system of land grants or Timars, for his victorious soldiers was established. This granted them land on the island, in the hopes of promoting a Turkish community on the otherwise predominately Greek island. This system has long remained in use and by the 19th Century, Kibris had a vibrant Turkish population centred around soldiers their descendants.\n\nThrough the plethora of wars we have been forced to endure over the decades, we once again have a large amount of Turkish veterans looking to settle down. By giving them Timars, we hope that they will integrate themselves within the Greek community and hopefully make the island more Ottoman oriented."

### Kurdish Integration

 OTT_Handling_Kurdish_Vilayets_desc: "§YIntegration of Kurdish Vilayets§! : §G[?OTT.kur_integration_factor]%§!\n\n(When §YIntegration of Kurdish Vilayets§! reaches §G50%§!, the Kurdish states can be upgraded to §YVilayet§! status and when it reaches more than §G100%§!, they can be upgraded to §YOttoman Province§! status)\n\nFor more info over the Kurdish region and its relation to the Porte, hover over the §CQuestion Mark§!."
 OTT_Kurd_Tooltip_GUI: "The relationship between Kostantiniyye and the Kurdish population of Eastern Anatolia and Northern Mesopotamia has always been a precarious one filled with both cooperation and conflict. When the last Kurdish Princely Houses were dismantled in 1847-48 and Kurdistan was formally placed under direct rule from Kostantiniyye, a loss of native tradition and leadership occurred which has had catastrophic effects for the Kurds. The absence of authority to keep §RTribal Sheiks§! and §RFanatical Religious Leaders§! at bay, led to their increased power in the Eastern Vilayets and years of massacres throughout the region against non-Sunni citizens such as the §CArmenians§! or the §CAlevi§!.\n\nDuring the rule of §YAbdulhamid II§! and the last years of the §YCUP Autocracy§!, these were freely employed to massacres the §CArmenians§! or to restore order to unruly parts of the Empire and although aversion by the post-war establishment towards these practices is increasing, they still rule the Kurds as their allies such as the §YSufi order of the Naqshbandi§! hold vast §RInfluence§! in the capital and the Empire in general.\n\nThe autonomy they are currently enjoying however is a curse in disguise as the §YOHF§! has clearly shown their intentions to eradicate the regional power of these religious authorities and is planning to fundamentally change the freedom the §RKurdish Sheiks§! currently possess."

 OTT_KUR_Centralise_Tax_Collection: "Centralise Tax Collection (Kurdistan)"
 OTT_KUR_Centralise_Tax_Collection_desc: "Even more so than in other regions of the Empire, the Eastern Vilayets of Anatolia are a region with little control by the central state and have been proven surprisingly resilient to reforms. On top of that, Ottoman Gendarmerie has trouble providing security to the citizens of the Empire as roads and paths, especially of the mountainous region are filled with bandits and highwaymen which make travel without escort a dangerous affair.\n\nTax Collectors are especially targeted as the Sheiks seem either incapable but more likely unwilling to provide the security necessary for a good functioning administration. As a cherry on top, the little taxes that do get collected more often than not never reach the Capital and either get embezzled or outright stolen.\n\nThe situation thus necessitates a large thorough reform which is likely to uproot a plethora of local traditions and insult existing power structures which will force us to use military force if necessary to make the whole affair be handled in an orderly fashion."

What this means in practice is that it allows the government to mark certain regions as 'deemed in need of further assimilation' and resettle citizens within that region until this goal has been achieved.\n\nBeing first proposed by Yusuf Ziya Zarbun, the Law itself does not specify which populations fall under its various categories but it is no secret that it has been influenced by the Turkish Nationalist movement and that it will primarily target non-Turkish populations such as the remaining Armenian settlements of Eastern Anatolia and the Kurdish population."

 OTT_KUR_Abolish_the_Hamidiye_desc: "Created by Sultan Abdulhamid II in 1891, the Hamidiye was originally based on the Russian Cossacks to serve as border patrol on the Ottoman-Russian border. Their usage however quickly diverged from this purpose as they were employed to shut down Armenian nationalist and socialist revolutionaries. Partaking in a wide plethora of punitive actions and massacres on the Armenian population, the Hamidiye became known for their violence and corruption as they enriched themselves greatly. Through these actions, they were also able to achieve a wide degree of influence within Kurdistan, often positioning themselves above the Law and roaming the region with impunity.\n\nThroughout the Weltkrieg, they were able to increase this power even further as they played a key role in the Armenian Massacres. Post-war however, their power started to wane as the lack of Armenians to suppress and the increasing animosity between the Kurds and Kostantiniyye led to an increasing presence of Ottoman troops to pacify the region. Many former Hamidiye were forced to disintegrate and flocked to the banners of religious demagogues, bolstering the ranks of the conservative and extremist resistance to the Kemalist designs."

 OTT_Iraq_Tooltip_GUI: "Both the richest and poorest region of the Ottoman Empire, Iraq is a region riddled with contradictions. After its conquest by Selim I, the region was home to the main battlefield between the §COttoman§! and §CPersian Empires§!. Serving as a §YBorder Province§!, it was also treated as such with development leaving much to be desired and §RPoverty§! widespread. Furthermore, local groups would take control over the region during the 18th century and it would take until the middle of the 19th century before the actual Ottoman government could be restored to the region. The 19th century would bring much change to Iraq as in an attempt to counter the Persian and later §RRusso-British Threat§!, the government finally recognised the need for reform and invested considerable resources in settling tribes, constructing communication lines and later infrastructure (shown nowhere better than in the Berlin-Baghdad project). §CMidhat Pasha§!, wali of Baghdad and later the Grand Vizier who would introduce the Ottoman constitution of 1876, marked a significant leap in this regard as throughout the region from Mosul to Basra massive strides were taken.\n\nAs §REuropean Penetration§! rose however around the turn of the century and with the rise of §RArab Nationalism§! after the raid on the Sublime Porte, Iraq (although far less so than its Syrian and Hejazi counterparts) began to think of an alternative to Turkish rule. To counter these sentiments and to ensure a stable frontier, the post-war governments pumped tremendous resources into Iraq to mould it into a modern Ottoman province. §YEducation§!, §YConstruction§!, §YConscription§!, etc all saw massive increases as Iraqi officers and politicians were used to counter Syrian ambitions."

 OTT_IRQ_Abolish_Assyrian_Autonomous_Zone: "Abolish the Assyrian Autonomous Zone"
 OTT_IRQ_Abolish_Assyrian_Autonomous_Zone_desc: "Established through the Basra Accords in 1920, the Assyrian community was granted special status in the Vilayet of Basra. Serving as the conductor for British influence in the entire Persian Gulf, they were able to prosper and slowly but surely build a new life far away from their homeland on the plains of Nineveh. This status however is not liked by all as the government in Kostantiniyye has desperately been trying to abolish it for years now.\n\nWith tensions rising across the globe and the Assyrian question once more coming to the forefront of Ottoman politics in Iraq, some are pushing for a direct resolution to the issue and the immediate abolishment of the zone, restoring the region to the full authority of the Baghdadi Wali."
 OTT_IRQ_Basra_Harbour_Project: "Enact the Basra Harbour Project"
 OTT_IRQ_Basra_Harbour_Project_desc: "Providing the primary naval base for the Ottoman Empire in the Persian Gulf, the importance of Basra & Kuwait was recognised during the 19th century as the grip of the Sultan on the Emirs of Arabia waned drastically in favour of the British. The British Empire, supported by its formidable fleet was able to provide a better alternative to the pitiful Ottoman navy and even though the Porte recognised this issue, was unable to solve it. The collapse of the British Empire and the shock waves it sent throughout the Middle East have been especially felt in this region as the Ottoman Empire suddenly found itself the main naval power in the Gulf.\n\nIt could however do little with this as the facilities in Basra, albeit reinforced by the British during the Weltkrieg, were incapable of supporting the main Ottoman fleet and as such only a small, insignificant squadron could be placed in this pivotal region. To mediate this issue and once more extend the Sultans power to the Emirates, a development programme has been set up to expand the Basra harbour whilst reinforcing the defences around the city to prevent another Fao Fortress catastrophe."
 OTT_IRQ_Mosul_Development: "Execute the Tigris Programme"
 OTT_IRQ_Mosul_Development_desc: "Less so than the Arab cities in Syria, the city of Mosul and its surroundings are closely connected to the Turkish economy and are more tightly knit into the regional administration of Anatolia. Furthermore, its population also consists of a tapestry of different ethnicities and religions: Kurds from the east of the Vilayet, Turkomans from the cities of Kirkuk and Mosul, Turks and Jews in Mosul and Arabs throughout the entire region. The growing importance of oil for the Ottoman (war) economy however has led many in Kostantiniyye to believe that extra measures should be taken to ensure that should war return to the region, Mosul will clearly throw its lot in with the Turks and that control over Kirkuk can under no circumstances be lost.\n\nRapid expansion of the railroads in the region, linking Mosul to Diyarbakir and Kirkuk are vital in this whilst the arsenals of Iraq (usually located in Baghdad) should in some capacity be shifted to Mosul and Kirkuk. Fears of a Fifth Column amidst the Shiite Arabs of Southern Iraq and the Assyrians in Basra are further influencing government policy to take control over the region in its own hands."
 OTT_IRQ_Navigation_Law: "Enact the Tigris & Euphrates Navigation Law"
 OTT_IRQ_Navigation_Law_desc: "The Tigris and Euphrates rivers, central to Iraq's prosperity and conflict for millennia, are crucial for any ruling entity seeking control. However, the unpredictable nature of these waterways and the challenging terrain posed significant obstacles to the Ottoman Empire's full exploitation of their benefits.\n\nIn the late 19th century, the British significantly enhanced their influence in Iraq by introducing steamers on the Tigris and Euphrates, increasing land value and Ottoman control. Despite Ottoman efforts to catch up, Britain's dominance was established, affecting the Porte's power and opening the Iraqi hinterland to other Western nations. Even after the Weltkrieg, British dominance persisted at the rivers' mouth until 1927, when the Porte regained its influence in the Persian Gulf, improving river navigation and control.\n\nDespite the Ottoman government's ambitions, river traffic remains below expectations. To address this and secure control over the Land of the Two Rivers, a proposal to nationalize all river transport and communication firms and ban foreign vessels from upstream travel is being considered. Additionally, acquiring patrol boats to protect commercial vessels and enhancing harbor inspections across cities aims to intercept illegal goods and increase revenue."
 OTT_IRQ_Iraqi_Road_System: "Expand Farm-to-City Connections"
 OTT_IRQ_Iraqi_Road_System_desc: "Control over the inhabitants of Iraq remains problematic as an entrenched aversion by the local people to anything even associated with administration prevents a constructive policy. Farmers toiling on the fields and members of the massive tribal confederations see no need in going to urban areas and due to the massive distances in Iraq, this leads to a situation where only those in the cities have an influence on state policy whilst the economy is unable to grow as agricultural goods do not reach an export centre nor do their creators purchase consumer goods, deteriorating the pitiful revenue of what is supposed to be a rich province.\n\nTo solve this issue, the government has chosen to embark on a Farm-to-City project. Constructing and expanding the existing road network, they will attempt to bring the two groups closer to each other and as such boost the economy of Iraq in general. By providing the means, the government hopes that the rural regions will as such transport their goods to the city where enticed by the richness of the modern consumer goods market, they will spread these to their friends and families. To ensure that these roads remain safe, the government has also authorised the purchase of armoured cars for the Iraqi gendarmerie and has commenced training of new mounted police regiments to tackle banditry in the region."
 OTT_IRQ_Coordinate_Shia_Tourism: "Regulate Shiite Pilgrims"
 OTT_IRQ_Coordinate_Shia_Tourism_desc: "Some of the Holiest places in the Shiite sect of Islam are located in Iraq. Much like Sunnis travel to Mecca and Medina, many Shiites (mainly Iranians) embark on a journey to the cities of Najaf and Karbala. This both brings us an advantage and a disadvantage, as whilst these centres of faith are exerting tremendous influence on the Iraqi population, whose composition has now drastically shifted in favour of Shiite demographic domination, they also provide us with a special way to influence Iranian policy. Many influential imams and religious officials are educated at these sites and those that remain in Iraq still exert their influence over the Iranian realm as proven by events in the late 19th and early 20th century.\n\nWith relations deteriorating with our Eastern neighbour however, many in Kostantiniyye believe that it would beneficial to our regime to tighten restrictions on Persian pilgrims travelling to the cities and to bring the educational facilities located there under closer supervision of the government."

 OTT_Libya_Tooltip_GUI: "Actually consisting of three distinct regions, the §Y'Regency of Tripolitania'§! has been at the side of the Sultan ever since 1551. Despite its age, the government in Kostantiniyye didn't interfere much in its local affairs as its poverty and lack of a decent agricultural base made it too expensive to embark on costly military campaigns to quell the local tribes. Nonetheless, what the Italians would refer to as "§CLibya§!" formed a vital piece in the Trans-Saharan trade as the oases of Fezzan were the last stop before the Sahel. The sheer size of the region ensured that Ottoman control was barely felt outside of a few coastal centres and it would take until the American invasion in the early 19th Century before the Porte would finally take measures to tie it further to the crown.\n\nThe implementation of the §YTanzimat Reforms§! saw little success in the region as only in Tripolitania much progress could be recorded. It would take until the turn of the century before the changes of the Ottoman regime would start to infiltrate the interior but even then, §CFezzan§! and §CCyrenaica§! were left almost entirely untouched.\n\nThe Italian invasion in 1911 did little to affect the general social structure in the region as the Ottomans notables which governed the coastal strip returned from their exile and retook their place in society. As Ottoman attention was drawn to the Mashriq and saddled with the economic depression caused by the Weltkrieg, the region saw §Rlittle economic development§!. §RIlliteracy§! (outside the main cities) is higher than anywhere else in the Empire, the economy still largely depends on the rainfall in a given year and the few industrial operations running before the war have almost all been forced to close down as a §Rlack of export partners and resources§! makes anything but limited agriculture nigh-impossible."

 OTT_TRI_Tripoli_Benghazi_Railway: "Construct the Tripoli-Benghazi Railway"
 OTT_TRI_Tripoli_Benghazi_Railway_desc: "One of the major issues that has plagued the Regency is that all three of its regions suffer from a lack of interconnectivity. Hindered by natural obstacles, Cyrenaica and Tripolitania couldn't be further apart as the great sand sea east of Sirte makes all transportation outside of sea routes nigh impossible. Furthermore, many of the more inland territories of Cyrenaica and Tripolitania aren't even connected to the coast which has led to yet another divide between the urban centres of Tripoli, Benghazi, Misrata and the pastoral villages deep in the Jabal.\n\nEven though an initial attempt at rail connectivity was attempted in the twenties, this network was uncompleted due to a lack of funding or local enthusiasm. The new government however has made railroads their number one priority and has decreed that it will extend the metal beasts to the far-flung deserts of Tripolitania. Connecting the city of Benghazi with Misrata and Tripoli, this is not only an incredibly ambitious plan but also one likely to weigh heavily on the local population which will be required to cough up a sizeable part of the investment."
 OTT_TRI_Fezzan_Expedition: "Increase Ottoman garrisons in Fezzan"
 OTT_TRI_Fezzan_Expedition_desc: "When Ottoman rule was restored to the Fezzan interior during the middle of the twenties, few accepted it with open arms and during the subsequent years the regime in Tripoli decided that maintaining a sizeable force in the region would be too costly. Retreating all troops bar some small garrisons in the urban centres, this has led to an almost entirely autonomous position for the local tribes.\n\nThey remain discontent however and influenced by a resurgence of the Senussi sect, tribes such as the Awlad Muhammad have started to show their resistance to the regime more clearly. Raids on Ottoman garrisons, refusal to pay taxes and be conscripted have caused drastic issues for the few remaining forces in the region.\n\nA military expedition from the coast could restore order to the region but with the large economic crisis still reigning, many wonder if it wouldn't be best to withdraw all garrisons and grant the region de facto self-rule. In Tripolitania, there is less animus to abandon the region as the valuable date production of Fezzan is essential in a nation with so little rainfall."
 OTT_TRI_Centralise_Taxation: "Centralise Tax Collection (Tripolitania)"
 OTT_TRI_Centralise_Taxation_desc: "Taxes have always been an iffy subject for the tribes of Tripolitania, and have caused the vast majority of uprisings against Ottoman rule in the past. As the Ottoman control only really extends to the main urban centres, tax collection in the hinterland is a tricky subject. To solve this, the Ottoman state has attempted to cooperate with the tribes and grant positions of tax collector, administrator, judge and police to certain tribal chiefs. By using tribes to make other tribes pay their dues, the system turned out much more effective than a pure reliance on Ottoman personnel. The issue here however is that the loyalty of those tribes isn't always guaranteed and certain political fluctuations in the Jabal can cause significant issues to the budget of the region.\n\nThe new administration is less keen on continuing this practice and is planning to make greater use of the kuloglu (Tripolitanians with Turkish ancestry) in the administration of the province. Furthermore, it also wishes to break up the quasi monopoly of Jewish merchants in the urban centres of Tripoli and Benghazi, in line with the National Economy model."

The Senussi order expanded quickly, establishing itself as a de facto independent state within the Ottoman empire already in the 19th century.\n\nTheir influence however didn't remain limited to Cyrenaica as the message of anti-imperialism spread quickly across all of Northern Africa. Although they officially promote solidarity and unity within the Sunni faith, their relation with the Caliph has been less ideal and their anti-imperialist message has turned both our enemies and our allies away from our hold."

Much like in the Mashriq, the tribes continue to consist of large Bedouin populations who stay out of the grip of the Ottoman civil service, making conscription and levying taxes a nigh impossible matter."

Maronites from Mt Lebanon, Kurds from Sulaymaniyah, Assyrians from Basra, Greeks from Cyprus, etc etc. Most of these groups seek some comfort under the wings of the HIF but a significant number remain which are discontent with their policies and which refuse to work together with a coalition in which Turkish nationalists hold significant sway.\n\n§YState Interactions§! on the Independent vilayets (§gAegean Islands, Dodecanese, Cyprus, Latakia, Sivas, Batumi, Sulaymaniyah, Basra, Jerusalem, Trebizond, Abu Dhabi, Bahrain, Qatar§!) will either increase or decrease the number of £deputies_texticon §Ydeputies§! in support of our coalition.\n\n§GSupportive§!: [?OTT.ind_sup_deputies]/[?OTT.ind_deputies]\n§ROpposition§!: [OTT_congress_independent_opposition]/[?OTT.ind_deputies]\n"

With deputies sent by all Vilayets in the Empire, there is representation from the Gulf of Aden to Edirne and from Cyprus to Baghdad. To create order in this myriad of ethnicities, religious affiliations and languages, these deputies have organised in 2 main power blocs: The centralist §COHF§! and the decentralist §CLiberal Entente§!.

### Politics (Kemalist)
 OTT_Judicial_Commision: "Found the Judicial Commission"
 OTT_Judicial_Commision_desc: "As the Ottoman civil code is based on the Sharia, in the shape of the Mecelle, many of the reformers have been attempting to replace it with a modernised and secular variant. An attempt at doing so was started in 1930 but the electoral defeat in 1931, forced the OHF to re-evaluate its position. Now that the party is back in charge, it seems only natural to push it once more."
 OTT_Expand_the_Education_Ministry: "Expand the Education Ministry"
 OTT_Expand_the_Education_Ministry_desc: "Fighting an uphill battle ever since the revolution in 1908, the topic of education is of the utmost importance to the OHF. Significant steps have been made in this regard, especially on the matter of co-education, but the decentralisation of the Ottoman Education System remains a thorn in the side. With the upcoming Co-education and Unification Decree, these will be annihilated in one fell swoop!"
 OTT_Replace_the_Penal_Code: "Replace the Penal Code"
 OTT_Replace_the_Penal_Code_desc: "Whilst the current Penal Code serves us well, the Grand Vizier has been enticed by reforms enacted in [ITA.GetNameDef]. It not only provides us with a better and modernised code but it also includes special clauses targeting political dissidents such as the syndicalist movement, which seem a useful tool to the administration."
 OTT_Single_Party_Dictatorship: "Install the Single Party Dictatorship"
 OTT_Single_Party_Dictatorship_desc: "Ottoman democracy has failed us. Whilst the Grand Vizier is a staunch supporter of the will of his people, he believes that a progressive vanguard is necessary to lift the Ottoman people up. This vanguard can only function if it can act with total power, free from conservative meddling."
 OTT_Abolish_Mecelle: "Abolish the Mecelle Code"
 OTT_Abolish_Mecelle_desc: "Following the suggestions made by the Judicial Commission, the time has finally come to rid ourselves of the Mecelle. A new civil code, fully secular in nature, will treat all Ottoman citizens as equals and will show the desire to tear down the last conservative anchor points."
 OTT_Commision_Ottomanish_Language: "Reform the Ottoman Language"
 OTT_Commision_Ottomanish_Language_desc: "Based on a Perso-Arabic script, many of the more radical reformers within the Party believe the Ottoman language is needlessly complicated and therefore hindering literacy programmes. They have therefore pushed towards the adoption of the Latin Script with the necessary adjustments to fit the Turkish language."
 OTT_Reform_Millet_System: "Reform the Millet System"
 OTT_Reform_Millet_System_desc: "The Millet System was a creation to ensure that Ottoman citizens who did not practise the Islamic faith could govern themselves and as such limit sectarian conflict. This has over the years however, led to non-Muslim citizens almost completely detaching themselves from the Empire, and has encouraged the disaster that followed in the Balkans. With a new Civil Code, surely this system is no longer necessary?"

 OTT_Ottoman_Constitution: "Procuring a New Constitution"
 OTT_Ottoman_Constitution_desc: "Our current constitution dates from 1876 when Abdulhamid II was forced to concede power to the Young Ottomans. Despite a temporary setback between 1878-1908, this same constitution would be brought back by the Young Turks during the constitutional revolution. Many believe the document is dated however and gives unnecessary power to the office of the Sultan. A revision is in order!"
 OTT_Secure_Seperation_of_Powers: "Guarantee the Separation of Powers"
 OTT_Secure_Seperation_of_Powers_desc: "When the Empire in 1878 returned to the rule of the Sultan, it quickly became apparent how this was detrimental to the nation. Arbitrary decisions and the concentration of so much power in the hands of a single person who could decree laws, condemn prisoners and take control over estates he fancied will not do in the 20th century. Therefore it is important that we limit the power of the Padishah."
 OTT_Reorganise_Vilayet_System: "Reorganise the Vilayet System"
 OTT_Reorganise_Vilayet_System_desc: "The current size of our Vilayets is far too large, and as such encourage concentration of power within local figures. By reducing the size of them and through the expansion of our telegraph and radio network, we can make them more dependent on the capital and have less power to mismanage."
 OTT_Millet_Mektepleri: "Millet Mektepleri"
 OTT_Millet_Mektepleri_desc: "The Millet Mektepleri or Nation School is the brainchild of Minister of Education Mustafa Necati and has a grand aim to make the entire Ottoman population literate. Focusing on the age bracket 14-45, these 'schools' are compulsory for all citizens including women and prisoners. After completing a test, the participants will be granted a certificate from the state and join the Modern Ottoman society."
 OTT_Emancipation_Push: "Emancipation Vanguard"
 OTT_Emancipation_Push_desc: "Through the co-education act, we have laid the first bricks on the road to emancipation. Nonetheless this is only the beginning as the OHF now also plans to enable women to run for office and vote in the national elections. A variety of professions will also be opened up to women as the war has shown the chronic lack of labour force amongst the Anatolian people."
 OTT_Curtail_Religious_Organisations: "Curtail Religious Organisations"
 OTT_Curtail_Religious_Organisations_desc: "If the Empire is ever to advance towards a secular institution, we have to take decisive action against the various religious organisations shouting their opposition to the reforms. The Sufi orders form the most significant hurdle in this as they not only de facto control Eastern Anatolia but have direct contacts with the Caliph who they utilise to remain in power. No more!"

### Maintaining Internal Order (Kemalist)
 OTT_Maintenance_of_Order_Law: "Pass the Maintenance of Order Law"
 OTT_Maintenance_of_Order_Law_desc: "Tough times necessitate tough measures and the "Law for the Maintenance of Public Order" is exactly this. To combat the internal enemies of our fair state, this law will extend dictatorial powers to the office of the Grand Vizier and extend the capability of the army to restore public order. Furthermore, it will also allow us to crush subversive organisations - such as the opposition - with ease."

 OTT_Reeling_in_the_Arab_Vilayets: "Reeling in the Arab Vilayets"
 OTT_Reeling_in_the_Arab_Vilayets_desc: "As political control over the Turkish heartland increases, so should we extend this to our Arab subjects in the Mashriq and Tripolitania. Be it through political appointments, economic development or military force, the old aristocratic order will be pushed out to make place for the new Ottoman citizen, a young, intellectual and proud servant of the Sultan."
 OTT_Reform_the_Conscription_System: "Reform the Conscription System"
 OTT_Reform_the_Conscription_System_desc: "Regularly used by the Ottoman army to cover its flanks or to perform the 'dirty' work, irregulars make up a not insignificant amount of our army. They are often recruited from Kurdish, Syrian and Iraqi tribes and are highly disloyal and untrustworthy assets to the army. The time has come to eradicate this practice and incorporate any stranglers into the full Ottoman Army."
 OTT_Crack_down_on_the_SSNP: "Crack Down on Arab Parties"
 OTT_Crack_down_on_the_SSNP_desc: "Through their printing presses in Beirut and their Radio broadcasts from Cairo, a whole slew of Arab movements has popped up throughout Greater Syria. Fighting against the modernisation of the Empire and trying to persuade people that an "Arab" nation would be beneficial to their lives, it is the duty of any decent government to spare the people from these delusions."
 OTT_Order_by_the_Locomotive: "Order by the Locomotive"
 OTT_Order_by_the_Locomotive_desc: "The sheer size of the empire has made control over the periphery tricky for centuries. As the Ottoman system of the 19th century strongly relied on control from the centre, inadequate infrastructure often made responding to crises slow. Pioneered by the Hejaz Railway and later the Istanbul-Baghdad Railway, the empire can now strike anywhere at any time."
 OTT_Status_of_the_Autonomous_Regions: "Status of the Autonomous Regions"
 OTT_Status_of_the_Autonomous_Regions_desc: "Under the CUP dictatorship, many of the old autonomous regions and special statuses were firmly abolished in favour of a strong centralised state. Pressured by the international community, conservatives and the Sultan himself, much of their work would be undone after the conclusion of the Weltkrieg. Now that the centralists are back in charge, the time is ripe to finish what our predecessors started."
 OTT_Tribunals_of_Progress: "Tribunals of Progress"
 OTT_Tribunals_of_Progress_desc: "Working in close cooperation with the Law on the Maintenance of Public Order, the "Kalkınma Mahkemeleri" are mobile military tribunals sent out by the office of the Grand Vizier to restore order throughout the empire. Headed by dedicated followers of the Pasha, these men will do whatever necessary to ensure the much needed reforms can't be stopped by the banalities of the opposition."

 OTT_Reeling_in_the_Anatolian_Vilayets: "Reeling in the Anatolian Vilayets"
 OTT_Reeling_in_the_Anatolian_Vilayets_desc: "Many nationalists see the entirety of Anatolia as one unit but this couldn't be less true as a variety of peoples ranging from Bosnian to Kurdish inhabit its highlands. Furthermore, there is a divide between those living on the coast and those of the interior, often been left behind in favour of more prosperous regions. Uniting these people under the modern interpretation of "Ottoman" is thus our task."
 OTT_Extend_Authority_Kurdish_Territories: "Extend Authority over the Kurds"
 OTT_Extend_Authority_Kurdish_Territories_desc: "Divided in tribes and other communities, Sheikhs and Aghas still dictate the order of the day in Kurdistan. For over a century, the Ottoman reform movement has been trying to rid themselves of their influence and bring the Kurdish people under the control of Kostantiniyye. Be it peacefully or through the use of force, we will succeed in the end!"
 OTT_Expand_Halkevleri: "Expand the Halkevleri Programme"
 OTT_Expand_Halkevleri_desc: "Even though our reforms are set to bring greater prosperity, greater freedom and massive strides in all fields many don't agree with this vision. Especially in the countryside many have serious doubts about the length at which the reforms will change society and are afraid these are in fact heresy. To show the people their virtue, we will create the "People's Houses", community centres to explain the programmes."
 OTT_Eradicate_Military_Disloyalty: "Eradicate Military Disloyalty"
 OTT_Eradicate_Military_Disloyalty_desc: "Most of the military is in full support of their Grand Vizier or his allies in the army but there nonetheless exists a movement that is less interested in Kemal's ever-increasing power and who believe that many of his programmes will not 'fix' the Empire as he claims but instead hasten its demise. We may need to 'correct' this..."
 OTT_OHP_Membership_Reward_Program: "OHF Membership Reward Programme"
 OTT_OHP_Membership_Reward_Program_desc: "Grasping back to our predecessor, the CUP, politics have become something not solely decided by the privy council but a true mass movement. Whilst this means that we no longer have to pay lip-service to a few select upper class notables, we still need to adapt our programme to the needs of our support base or if one doesn't exist, create one ourselves through carefully placed notables."

### Internal Policy Post-CP
 OTT_Ottoman_Renaissance: "Dawn of the Ottoman Renaissance"
 OTT_Ottoman_Renaissance_desc: "The Europeans deemed us weak and sickly, the Iranians believed we wouldn't risk confronting them, and the Arabs believed they were an equal match for the power of Turkish boots. With the white crescent on a red field flying on ramparts from Cairo to Lake Urmiah, we have once and for all shown that our decline has been firmly halted and turned around!"

 OTT_Reform_on_the_Homefront: "Stabilise the Homefront"
 OTT_Reform_on_the_Homefront_desc: "The necessities of war and the Kemalist reforms which had to be pushed through without the distractions caused by popular sentiment forced our regime to restrict certain 'liberties' of our citizens. With the death of Mustafa Kemal however, it is quickly becoming apparent that the same authoritarian rule won't remain feasible without his charisma and prestige."
 OTT_Lift_Press_Restrictions: "Lift Press Restrictions"
 OTT_Lift_Press_Restrictions_desc: "As part of the authoritarian measures installed to ensure total control over the war situation and to smother conservative/Islamic resistance to the reforms, the press was heavily curtailed and only commentaries backed by the Party were allowed for publication. With the recent pressure on the authoritarian government to liberalise, we should lift the restrictions."
 OTT_Repeal_Varlik_Vargisi: "Repeal the Varlik Vargisi"
 OTT_Repeal_Varlik_Vargisi_desc: "The 'Varlik Vargisi' is a specific war tax which targets rich Armenians and Jews to fund the operations of the government. By putting exorbitant burdens on these groups, the policy both serves to remedy the ever-increasing deficit and to bolster the 'National Economy' by pushing the non-Muslims out of business and encourage take-overs by Turkish citizens."
 OTT_Lift_Ban_Political_Parties: "Lift Ban on Political Organisations"
 OTT_Lift_Ban_Political_Parties_desc: "As the authority of the central government crumbles on all sides and voices both inside and outside of the Party are calling for an end to authoritarianism, our Grand Vizier has decided to lift the ban on political organisations and organise open elections as soon as possible."

 OTT_Egypt_Khedivate: "Khedivate Restored"
 OTT_Egypt_Khedivate_desc: "The focus of the Ottoman state should lay on Anatolia and the Levant as further expansion will only lead to a worsening of our internal troubles and upset the Turkish plurality within the nation. As the deposed Khedive, Abbas Hilmi, still enjoys the luxuries of his Bosporus villa, we could establish closer ties between our two states but keep them as separate entities."
 OTT_Cairo_Aleppo: "Cairo-Aleppo Development Scheme"
 OTT_Cairo_Aleppo_desc: "The growing importance of the petroleum industry and the increasing demand from Europe for this black gold, have shifted priority for the Central Planning Board to the development of a strong industrial basis in the Levant and improve the export capacities of the Empire. Utilising the revenue of the oil business, we will furthermore expand the textile industry of Syria. "
 OTT_Absorb_Egyptian_State_Assets: "Absorb Egyptian State Assets"
 OTT_Absorb_Egyptian_State_Assets_desc: "The Egyptian aristocracy and a small group of oligarchs control the vast majority of Egyptian land and industry, forcing the Egyptian people to live as impoverished Fellahin on their lands. By enforcing the Ottoman land reform in the newly 'liberated' lands and through sales of these vast estates, we can both fill our coffers and increase Ottoman penetration of their economy."
 OTT_Ottoman_Authority_Peninsula: "Reaffirm Authority on the Peninsula"
 OTT_Ottoman_Authority_Peninsula_desc: "For too long have the tribes of the Arabian peninsula been able to raid and plunder Ottoman supply lines and contest our rule on the periphery. To follow in the footsteps of great administrators such as Midhat Pasha, the time has come for the Empire to strengthen its southern flank and crush the influence of Wahhabists and Emirs alike."
 OTT_Restore_the_Vilayet_of_Najd: "Create the Vilayet of al-Hasa"
 OTT_Restore_the_Vilayet_of_Najd_desc: "Our hold on the Arabian peninsula has always been a tenuous affair as the state preferred demanding fealty from the local emirs than exert direct control. Change was brought to this when Midhat Pasha retook al-Hasa and extended Ottoman control further inland but pressed on all fronts, the Saudis were able to force us out in 1913. With the discovery of oil, the time has come to restore our rule over the Gulf. "
 OTT_Handle_the_Yemeni_Affair: "Handle the Yemeni Affair"
 OTT_Handle_the_Yemeni_Affair_desc: "The Imam has made the crucial mistake to doubt Ottoman superiority on the field of battle and has as such thrown away any chances at retaining the special status of his realm. Holed up in their mountains and believing themselves untouchable by the Ottoman Army, they are in for a rude awakening..."
 OTT_Lift_Military_Restrictions: "Lift Military Restrictions"
 OTT_Lift_Military_Restrictions_desc: "As part of the treaty imposed on the Egyptian state after their defeat in the Levantine war, the size of their military was limited to 20.000 as to not present a threat to our interests. The rise of tensions across the world however and the vulnerability of the Canal and the Libyan flank have made us consider lifting these limitations and using the Egyptian manpower to defend the Caliphate."
 OTT_United_Once_More: "United Once More"
 OTT_United_Once_More_desc: "The disaster that befell the Ottoman state in the 19th century and which was only aggravated at the turn of the 20th century has now been corrected as Istanbul and Cairo are now finally reunited! To prevent this from happening again however, the government has decreed an extensive reorganisation of both parts of the Empire including economic, administrative and cultural adjustments."
 OTT_Haifa_Cairo_Railroad: "Construct the Haifa-Cairo Railroad"
 OTT_Haifa_Cairo_Railroad_desc: "As an important axis throughout the entirety of human history, we should improve the connection between the lands of the Tigris/Euphrates and the Nile delta. Despite earlier attempts to create a direct rail connection, the difference in railway gauges between the Ottoman and former British networks halted all efforts. No more!"
 OTT_Redraw_the_Vilayets: "Redraw the Vilayets"
 OTT_Redraw_the_Vilayets_desc: "Following the example of Anatolia, an extensive look at the provincial organisation of our new lands is essential to ensure proper integration and modernisation. Therefore we need to step away from the old Vilayet model and carve it up into smaller, more manageable provinces."
 OTT_Settle_Sudanese_Issue: "Settle the Sudanese Affair"
 OTT_Settle_Sudanese_Issue_desc: "The question of Sudan's future has for a while now bothered the government in Kostantiniyye, as unlike Egypt, there is very little connection between it and the Ottoman centre. The distance further complicates affairs as any effective communication is basically impossible. Therefore the idea now on the table proposes the creation of a separate Sudanese state tightly bound to the Porte."
 OTT_Conference_Alexandria: "Conference of Alexandria"
 OTT_Conference_Alexandria_desc: "The current policy of imposed Turkish rule based on our demographic advantage no longer holds true now that the scales have been tipped in favour of the Arabs. This realisation has made many Turkish nationalists redefine their target audience and work towards a more inclusive citizen model. Therefore the Conference of Alexandria has been opened to finally cement the definition of an 'Ottoman' citizen."
 OTT_Integrate_State_Monopolies: "Integrate State Monopolies"
 OTT_Integrate_State_Monopolies_desc: "Whilst the Egyptian state didn't include many industrial centres, it nonetheless boasts an impressive agricultural output. Through a system of landowners and Fellahs, a small group close to the crown was able to achieve tremendous power. The time has now come for us to take over these monopolies and integrate them within our own state holdings, as such breaking the power of the Egyptian aristocracy."
 OTT_Recreate_Ottoman_Fifth_Army: "Standardise Ottoman Army"
 OTT_Recreate_Ottoman_Fifth_Army_desc: "Although Ottoman policy makes recruitment a non-ethnic/non-religious affair and imposes a draft for all males of age to serve in times of need, the last few wars have proven the reliance of our high command on Turkish recruits as they fear a fifth element in the Christian and Arab population. If we are to exert control over Egypt, this policy will need to be adjusted and an expanded army instated."
 OTT_Elevate_Arab_Language: "Elevate the Status of the Arab Language"
 OTT_Elevate_Arab_Language_desc: "After the Weltkrieg and prompted by the Arab movement, Mehmet VI lifted some of the restrictions on the Arab language and made it the second (official) language of the Empire in Arab majority territories. Nonetheless, various institutions such as the military have remained solely Turkish and have caused great consternation from our Arab brethren. The time for full equality has arrived!"
 OTT_Expansion_Ottoman_Parliament: "Expand the Meclis-i Umumî"
 OTT_Expansion_Ottoman_Parliament_desc: "The Meclis-i Umumî or the General Assembly serves as the centre of power within our realm and has sole authority over matters of state. With Egypt still under questionable control, this chamber has thus far remained limited to Mashriqi and Anatolian parliamentarians as to avoid trouble with the re-integration. With the first hurdles behind us however, it is time to expand membership to our new subjects."

### Foreign Policy
 OTT_Policy_of_Deterence: "Policy of Deterrence"
 OTT_Policy_of_Deterence_desc: "Too many Ottoman lives have been lost in the dreadful Weltkrieg for us to risk entanglement in a second conflict of the same scope. We should focus inwards and protect what we have, instead of throwing it all away in a fool's gambit for glory and prestige."

 OTT_Relinquish_European_Ambitions: "Relinquish European Ambitions"
 OTT_Relinquish_European_Ambitions_desc: "From an empire centred around 'Rumelia' and the Aegean, wherein the Mashriq and Anatolia was merely the periphery, a drastic shift has occurred in the direction of Anatolia proper. Through wars and the massive population shifts that occurred due to them, we have transformed into a 'Middle Eastern' and Muslim state. Europe is not our enemy and we should make sure they don't see us as such."
 OTT_Greek_Turkish_Population_Exchange: "The Greco-Turkish Accords"
 OTT_Greek_Turkish_Population_Exchange_desc: "When the Balkan Wars finally ended, the once tightly intertwined ethnic and religious tapestry of the Empire found itself in disarray. Hundreds of thousands of Muslim refugees flooded in from the Balkans whilst in Anatolia the remaining Christians were eyed with increasing suspicion. To solve this, we believe that an exchange between the remainders of both groups will prove effective and provide a détente to the hostile relations between ourselves and the Greek government."
 OTT_Balkan_Military_Accords: "Balkan Military Accords"
 OTT_Balkan_Military_Accords_desc: "To prevent further war in the Balkans, our government proposes the creation of the so-called 'Edirne Accords' which would pose limitations on the size of our armies and increase economic activity across our borders. With greater exchange of goods and ideas over these loosened borders, it is hoped that escalation towards war will become much less likely."
 OTT_Never_Another_Balkan_War: "Peace at Home, Peace in the World"
 OTT_Never_Another_Balkan_War_desc: "'Osmanlı Halk Fırkası'nın müstakar umumî siyasetini şu kısa cümle açıkça ifadeye kâfidir zannederim: Yurtta sulh, cihanda sulh için çalışıyoruz.' - Mustafa Kemal Pasha\n('To describe the stable and general diplomatic policy of the Ottoman People's Party, I think this short sentence is enough: We work for peace at home, peace in the world.' - Mustafa Kemal Pasha)"

 OTT_Promote_Muslim_Solidarity: "Promote Muslim Solidarity"
 OTT_Promote_Muslim_Solidarity_desc: "The Ummah consists of hundreds of millions of Muslims all united in their common belief for Islamic values. Nonetheless, this community has waged war on itself for over a millennium, and has in the last few hundred years devolved into nothing but a play ball in the hands of the West. We should not blindly strive to enter the Western club but works towards a better, stronger Ummah."
 OTT_United_Against_Imperialism: "United against Imperialism"
 OTT_United_Against_Imperialism_desc: "As there was no unified front against the Imperialists, one by one the proud Muslim states fell to the claws of European colonialism. We, as the predominant Muslim power in the world, and the centre of the Sunni faith, should see it as our duty to assist our brethren of the faith, protect them and show that the spirit of the Ummah has not yet been extinguished."
 OTT_Maghrebi_Frontier: "Reaffirm Ties with Maghreb"
 OTT_Maghrebi_Frontier_desc: "From Morocco to the former Ottoman regencies of Algiers, Tunis and Tripolitania, the Maghrebis are held dear in the heart of our government and suffering the hardest from the effects of colonialism. We shall work together to secure a free and strong Maghreb!"
 OTT_Oriental_Cooperation: "Cooperation with the Orient"
 OTT_Oriental_Cooperation_desc: "For decades the Ottoman Empire has fostered relations with our distant brethren of the Orient. From the deserts and mountains of East Turkestan to the plains of Central Asia and the Indian lowlands, our brethren are ready to stand together in these troubling times."
 OTT_Security_on_the_Arab_Peninsula: "Stability on the Arab Peninsula"
 OTT_Security_on_the_Arab_Peninsula_desc: "Home of Islam, the Arab peninsula forms the centrepiece of any attempt to bring the Ummah closer together. After years of piecemeal dissection by the British, the time has come to provide the struggling economies of the Gulf and the Bedouin of the interior with a real answer to their trouble!"
 OTT_Islamic_Economic_Union: "Association of Muslim Nations"
 OTT_Islamic_Economic_Union_desc: "Envisioned as a bloc of mutual prosperity, the Association of Muslim Nations would be an economic alliance with a goal reducing the reliance on European and American goods whilst also boosting domestic industrialisation efforts of the various participating members. If we all bind together, we can't be picked off one by one and exert a certain pressure on the powers that be."

 OTT_Abolish_Full_Neutrality: "Abolish Full Neutrality"
 OTT_Abolish_Full_Neutrality_desc: "We should not kid ourselves any longer. The world is at war and the time for choosing has arrived. We could remain on the sidelines and watch as all sides plunge themselves into despair but then we would also have to contend ourselves with having no allies, no partners and an insecure future in the post-war world. Do we really want to risk that?"
 OTT_Gamble_in_the_Caucasus: "Gamble in the Caucasus"
 OTT_Gamble_in_the_Caucasus_desc: "The Germans may have snubbed us out of Azerbaijan during the last war but with tensions rising across the globe, we have an opportunity to play hard-ball and put the return of Azerbaijan as the cost for our partnership in their international venture."
 OTT_Settling_Old_Disputes: "Settling Old Disputes"
 OTT_Settling_Old_Disputes_desc: "There is a time for hurting and a time for healing. With the debt owed to us now finally rectified, the time for healing has arrived. We should let bygones be bygones and work towards a closer friendship with our German allies."
 OTT_Research_Cooperation: "Ottoman-German Research Initiative"
 OTT_Research_Cooperation_desc: "Ottoman scientific expertise is severely lacking as for one the literacy rate of the Empire is abominable. Furthermore, the Empire was never really able to catch up with the west in terms of military development and has since mostly relied on imported goods. Through our newfound connections to the German Empire, we can both access better equipment and educate our own people for the future."
 OTT_Vanguard_in_the_South: "Vanguard in the South"
 OTT_Vanguard_in_the_South_desc: "Just like Belgium in the West and Lithuania in the East, we form Germany's Southern frontier and are as such tasked with an important role in guaranteeing their possessions in the region. From geographical features such as the Suez to the Caucasus to strategic ones such as the Oil fields of Iraq and the Chromite mines of Anatolia, we are an invaluable cog in the great machine of the Kaiser."
 OTT_Alliance_of_Convenience: "An Alliance of Convenience"
 OTT_Alliance_of_Convenience_desc: "The Balkans need a firm hand to guide them back on track and end the constant conflict. Our former arch-nemesis in Vienna has similar ideas and might be tempted into forming a bloc to ensure that those are put into action. Furthermore, we both share an aversion to the hawkish nature of German meddling and would preferably ward off Russian expansion. Shouldn't we put the past behind us then?"
 OTT_Sarajevo_Accords: "Sign the Sarajevo Accords"
 OTT_Sarajevo_Accords_desc: "Although for many an unexpected turn of events, the two former enemies of the Ottoman and Habsburg Empires have found similarities in their foreign policy and have decided to join forces in a defensive bloc aimed to ward off aggression from the North, West and East."

### Army
 OTT_ottoman_army: "The Ottoman Army"
 OTT_ottoman_army_desc: "The Ottoman Army is the heart of the Turkish nation. We must seek to strengthen and support it against our numerous enemies, for the survival of our State depends on the Ever-Triumphant Horde."
 OTT_army_modernization: "Inspectorate of Army Modernisation"
 OTT_army_modernization_desc: "Mauser rifles and bayonets proved effective in the Weltkrieg, but the battlefield is changing. The large gap between enemy technologies and our equipment is ever-expanding, and we must expend considerable effort if we want our army to retain its might."
 OTT_modern_equipment: "Standardise Military Equipment"
 OTT_modern_equipment_desc: "Although the Ottoman army is undoubtedly the best equipped force in the entire Middle East, there is nonetheless a massive issue with regards to standardisation with many rifles, artillery pieces and other tools coming from a wide array of manufacturers. This diversity has led to significant strain on our supply lines, further complicated by the unreliability of many of its former owners engulfed by socialist strife. "
 OTT_armor_effort_unq: "Ottoman Armoured Project"
 OTT_armor_effort_unq_desc: "Although the army is no stranger to armoured vehicles, sporting a variety of armoured cars during the Weltkrieg and taking command over a variety of Mark V tanks from the British Empire, the empire nonetheless lacks the capabilities of an established armoured corps. To rectify this issue, a special commission has been tasked with expanding our supply of armoured vehicles and providing adequate training."
 OTT_directorate_military: "Directorate of Military Factories"
 OTT_directorate_military_desc: "We must reorganise our military production facilities into a proper network of organised factories. Establishing the Askeri Fabrikalar Umum Müdürlüğü will ensure that well coordinated orders are directed to our various domestic weapons manufacturers and the troops from the Hejaz to Gallipoli are well supplied."
 OTT_edok: "Restructure the Erkân-ı Harbiye Mektebi"
 OTT_edok_desc: "The Erkân-ı Harbiye Mektebi or Military Staff College serves as the crowning achievement in the education of the officers of the army and is destined to give ample preparation to the best students who have climbed the ranks of our system. Nonetheless the college is in dire need of restructuring as the curricula have seen little change since the Weltkrieg and are in regards to combined arms severely lacking."
 OTT_army_engineers: "Army Engineer Schools"
 OTT_army_engineers_desc: "Founded in 1795 under the reign of Selim III, the Mühendishâne-i Berrî-i Hümâyun serves as one of the most crucial schools in the empire, providing an expansive education into both civil and military engineering. Although the school was temporarily closed during the war as its students joined the army, it has been reopened after the war and expanded with an artillery education school in Anatolia."
 OTT_desert_forces: "Specialised Desert Regiments"
 OTT_desert_forces_desc: "Although several attempts had been made already to set up specialised regiments in Libya and Central Arabia consisting of Bedouin and local tribesmen, these operations usually only lasted a few years. This was to change after the Weltkrieg as a new impetus to defend the Southern frontier led to the creation of the Iraqi Camel Corps, a practice that was soon to be imitated all across the Middle East."
 OTT_Mass_Production: "Maximise Military Production"
 OTT_Mass_Production_desc: "Back in the day, the arsenals of the Sublime Porte were revered all across Europe, which cowered before the might of the unstoppable Turkish armies. These days are long behind us however as the Empire never quite caught the train of industrialisation, and the once grand arsenals fell silent. This is soon to change however as a new budget for the armed forces has made room for significant investments."
 OTT_Specialised_Equipment: "Diversify Military Portfolio"
 OTT_Specialised_Equipment_desc: "The capacity of our domestic armament industry is pitiful at best, as many of the modern tools of warfare are currently left to foreign manufacturing concerns. If we are to arm our troops with something better than rifles, grenades and a uniform we will have to drastically diversify our manufacturing capacities."

### Air
 OTT_army_aviation_unq: "Army Aviation Command"
 OTT_army_aviation_unq_desc: "We have a need for a better air force to support our ground forces. Let us take the time to reorganise the command structure of the Army Aviation Command to promote good officers and ensure that we can recruit the best pilots."
 OTT_air_warfare_academy: "Expand the Tayyare Mektebi"
 OTT_air_warfare_academy_desc: "The \"Tayyare Mektebi\" is the first place our new pilots go to train: It is a flight school after all. We must procure better funding, newer facilities, and more capable instructors in order to create a new generation of amazing pilots."
 OTT_aircraft_industry: "Hürkuş & TOMTAS Aviation"
 OTT_aircraft_industry_desc: "Vecihi Hürkuş was the first aviation engineer we ever had, and he served with distinction in the Weltkrieg. With his help we have developed a proper factory dedicated specifically to the development of new aircraft: Tayyare and Motor Türk Anonim Şirketi. With this modern factory we shall build planes that are the envy of the world."

### Naval
 OTT_Naval_Program: "Continue the Ottoman Naval Project"
 OTT_Naval_Program_desc: "Our navy has never been spectacular, and many times efforts to improve and modernise the navy have been put on hold for more pressing concerns. Not anymore. Now we shall see to the creation of a grand fleet to eclipse any we have built before!"
 OTT_Shipbuilding_Effort: "Golcuk Dockyards"
 OTT_Shipbuilding_Effort_desc: "On the coast of the Sea of Marmara lies the town of Gölcük and the nearby naval base of the same name. The naval base needs to be paired with a new dry dock and supporting facilities in order for us to build and refit better ships."
 OTT_Upgrade_Dreadnoughts: "Refit our Dreadnoughts"
 OTT_Upgrade_Dreadnoughts_desc: "The average person looks upon the visage of a dreadnought and is consumed with fear. Unable to approach the situation tactically they bemoan how difficult it is to sink a dreadnought. Ours need some upgrades and refits to bring them up to modern standards, and they will smash everyone they go up against!"
 OTT_Dominance_Black_Sea: "Black Sea Shore Defences"
 OTT_Dominance_Black_Sea_desc: "Although many see our navy as a force to dominate the Eastern Mediterranean, we must also be concerned with the Black Sea. One way we can strengthen our position on this front will be with a strong network of shore defences to blow enemy ships out of the water."
 OTT_Basra_Kuwait: "Expand the Basra-Kuwait Facilities"
 OTT_Basra_Kuwait_desc: "Even less thought about than the Black Sea is The Persian Gulf. We DO in fact have a naval base there, and the ability to put a fleet in those waters and beyond. We should take the time to modernise the Basra-Kuwait facilities in case we are needed in the Gulf."
 OTT_Naval_Academy: "Imperial School of Naval Sciences"
 OTT_Naval_Academy_desc: "With all of these projects completed recently there is a growing sense that we can do more. We can have a larger and better navy not through copying other nations, but by innovating ourselves! We shall grant greater funding and resources to the School of Naval Sciences to help become the most modern navy in the world!"

### Economic (Kemalist)
 OTT_Samsun_Iktisat_Kongresi: "The Samsun Iktisat Kongresi"
 OTT_Samsun_Iktisat_Kongresi_desc: "Following the First Economic Congress in Izmir, we will host a second grand event to showcase the progress and capabilities of the Sublime Porte. As the world economy spirals out of control following the collapse of the Berlin stock exchange, this congress will be used as a way to calm down investors and showcase the stability of our internal market."
 OTT_Raise_Import_Tariffs: "Raise Import Tariffs"
 OTT_Raise_Import_Tariffs_desc: "To encourage domestic industry and prevent reliance on foreign construction materials and basic consumer goods, the government will raise import tariffs substantially. Although this is a great boon for the nascent Anatolian industry, many in Beirut, Alexandretta and Haifa fear that this will greatly damage their status as gateways to the Orient."
 OTT_Restrict_Foreign_Exchange_Regime: "Restrict Foreign Exchange Regime"
 OTT_Restrict_Foreign_Exchange_Regime_desc: "Lack of confidence in the Ottoman government has pushed many investors to sell off their Liras in favour of foreign currencies in recent months, to the detriment of its value. By restricting our domestic investors' capacity to sell off their Liras, we can strengthen our currency compared to the leading currencies of the world like the Mark."
 OTT_Quantity_Restrictions_Import: "Impose Quantity Restrictions on Import"
 OTT_Quantity_Restrictions_Import_desc: "Whilst the government aims to create a strong local industry, it too often finds itself relying on goods imported from the Donau-monarchy or the German Empire. Steel, machinery, chemicals, etc. are all imported which makes us not only reliant on those nations, but greatly hampers domestic goods as they can't compete with the cheap export products of the larger manufactures abroad."
 OTT_Ziraat_Bankasi_Credit: "Ziraat Bankasi Credit Programme"
 OTT_Ziraat_Bankasi_Credit_desc: "Originally the brainchild of Midhat Pasha, the Memleket Sandığı was reorganised into the Ziraat Bankasi in 1888. Providing stability and relief for farmers, still the majority of our population, the bank has been greatly expanded over the years. As prices for agricultural goods are in flux, following the collapse of Ukrainian and German markets, the vast reserves of the bank will be used to fight the crisis."
 OTT_Toprak_Mahsulleri_Ofisi: "Open the Toprak Mahsulleri Ofisi"
 OTT_Toprak_Mahsulleri_Ofisi_desc: "According to Law No 3491, this agency will prevent abnormal decrease or increase of the wheat prices against producers and consumers, to protect and regulate the wheat industry, to import or export wheat when necessary, to monitor wheat production trends and market movements in the world, to establishing milling facilities and bakeries in locations to be determined and to carry on other similar tasks."
 OTT_Balance_the_Budget: "Balance the Budget"
 OTT_Balance_the_Budget_desc: "When the Ottoman Empire collapsed under the strain of the debts it had racked up during the Crimean War, an international organisation called the OPDA (Ottoman Public Debt Administration) essentially took over our economy. The disgrace and damage it has caused remain a vibrant memory in the minds of many Turkish economists, who since have sworn to maintain a balanced budget at all cost."
 OTT_Years_of_Progress: "Four Years of Progress"
 OTT_Years_of_Progress_desc: "Inspired in part by socialist systems, the cabinet of our Grand Vizier will decree the next 4-year plan which he has dubbed the 'Four Years of Progress'. With the focus on rapid industrialisation of the Ottoman nation, it wants to greatly reduce the reliance on foreign goods and expand the domestic industry targeting textiles, steel, cement and others."
 OTT_Economic_Commisions: "Fourteen Economic Commissions"
 OTT_Economic_Commisions_desc: "Whilst the Ottoman Empire has seen a distinct rise in its industrial capacity and a reduction in dependence on agricultural exports, the empire lacks a clear vision to really guide the nation towards the future. To fix that, the government has decreed the creation of 14 economic commissions, each with their own areas, to formulate a centralised plan for the future."
 OTT_Striving_for_Autarky: "Striving for Autarky"
 OTT_Striving_for_Autarky_desc: "With the global market heavily in flux after its share of disasters in the last few decades, many economists in the empire have started to push for ‘autarky', or economic self-sufficiency. Although the empire has a long way to go, deriving mainly from its lack of a large industrial base, plans for cement, steel, textile, etc. factories have already been approved by the economic commissions."
 OTT_Anatolian_Industrialisation: "Second Anatolian Industrialisation"
 OTT_Anatolian_Industrialisation_desc: "Although the National Economy scheme has already led to the development of much young industry in Anatolia, the government sees much room for improvement in what was only 30 years ago one of the poorer regions of the empire. A variety of industries in construction, tobacco, textile, etc. will serve as the backbone of this new project."
 OTT_Sumerbank: "Sümerbank Investments"
 OTT_Sumerbank_desc: "The cornerstone of the OHF industrialisation model, the Sümerbank serves as the primary investor and controller of our rapidly expanding industrial assets. Although it has a hand in most sectors of the 4-Year Plan, its primary focus is on the development of the Turkish Textile industry which after initial successes in Anatolia has been expanded to Homs."
 OTT_Lebanese_Industrialisation: "Beiruti Industrial Zone"
 OTT_Lebanese_Industrialisation_desc: "The economic motor of Syria and its primary harbour, the city of Beirut serves an important role in the industrialisation of the Mashriq and also in further centralising authority. Although some have proposed to shift focus more to Damascus or Homs, both established agricultural and manufacturing centres, the government has proven adamant in its focus on Lebanon, supposedly to break the power of Damascus."
 OTT_Model_Farm_Project: "Expand the Model Farm Project"
 OTT_Model_Farm_Project_desc: "Created during Kemal's first term, the Orman Çiftliği or Forest Farm was set up near Ankara as a private farm but was quickly developed into a "model farm" which by using the most modern forms of agriculture was to serve as a tool to teach the Anatolian farmers new methods. With matters in the capital taking most of the Vizier's time, the project is on the verge of being transferred to the government."
 OTT_Aleppan_Institute_Technology: "Aleppan Institute of Technology"
 OTT_Aleppan_Institute_Technology_desc: "Although a variety of schools already exist to cater to the Arab population, the only real institutes of technological higher learning are on the West Coast of Anatolia, primarily in the capital. To solve the issue of technical illiteracy of large swathes of our population, making them useless to our industrialisation schemes, Aleppo will be the home of a new engineering institute."
 OTT_Monopolise_Railway_Companies: "Monopolise the Railway Companies"
 OTT_Monopolise_Railway_Companies_desc: "The 'DDUM' or State Railways Administration was founded after the war to take over Entente railway concessions, and to finance the construction of further railroads across the Empire. Nonetheless many foreign concessions remained and various privately held tracks refused integration. With the crisis however, many of these companies are on the brink of bankruptcy, opening the way for unification."
 OTT_Eastern_Anatolian_Project: "Eastern Anatolian Railway Project"
 OTT_Eastern_Anatolian_Project_desc: "Just like the Americans conquered the Frontier through the iron beasts of the industrial era, so has our government decreed the expansion of rail and other roads into Eastern Anatolia. Around these railroads would then be created a system of villages and towns inhabited by Turks or immigrants of both the Balkans and the Caucasus to strengthen the hold of Kostantiniyye over their own "Frontier"."
 OTT_Three_Blacks_Project: "Three Blacks Project"
 OTT_Three_Blacks_Project_desc: "Centred around three of the main industrial resources (coal, iron and oil), the three blacks project aims to expand domestic production to the point that the Ottoman Empire is capable of being self-sufficient. To achieve this goal, the universities of the Empire have in cooperation with institutes all across Europe worked towards the refinement of extraction methods and the exploration of new sites."
 OTT_Zonguldak_Mining: "Zonguldak Coal Mining"
 OTT_Zonguldak_Mining_desc: "Already discovered in the 19th century, the coal mines of Zonguldak nonetheless saw little exploitation during most of the century and it was only with the Weltkrieg and the sudden need of coal for the Ottoman fleet that Zonguldak started to assert itself as an important economic centre. With the government plans for domestic steel production in Karabük, Zonguldak is to play a key role."
 OTT_Trans_Mashriqi_Pipeline: "Finish the Trans-Mashriqi Pipeline"
 OTT_Trans_Mashriqi_Pipeline_desc: "With the exploitation of Iraqi oil proceeding at an ever-increasing pace, hard limits have started to occur as the capacity of shipping in Southern Iraq and the increasingly hostile relations with Teheran have been identified as difficult hurdles to cross. Furthermore, since our clients are located in Europe, plans have been drafted to connect the fields of Kirkuk to the ports of Iskenderun and Beirut."
 OTT_Tigris_Program: "Tigris Development Scheme"
 OTT_Tigris_Program_desc: "This bustling river is one of the most important natural features of the Middle East, bringing life to otherwise arid deserts and providing an ideal way of communication and transportation. Furthermore, it's not solely an Iraqi river, but also leaves a deep impression on Kurdistan, Anatolia and Syria. By focusing our efforts on this vein, the government hopes to strengthen these *Ottoman* bonds."
 OTT_TPC_Kirkuk: "TPC Kirkuk Operations"
 OTT_TPC_Kirkuk_desc: "With exploitation starting in the '20s, the oil fields of Kirkuk have seen rapid expansion by the TPC as increasing government control over the company and a direct need of new revenue for the state has pushed its growth to the max. Nonetheless the vast reserves have only started to be touched and with America in disarray, the government has identified these as essential to the future of the Ottoman state."
 OTT_Lower_Mesopotamian_Exploration: "Southern Iraqi Oil Exploration"
 OTT_Lower_Mesopotamian_Exploration_desc: "Although most operations of the TPC and its German-Dutch allies are centred around Kirkuk and Mosul in the North of Iraq, large untapped reserves have recently been discovered in the South of Iraq, near the important harbours of Basra and Kuwait. Since these are also already tightly connected to the Iraqi rail network, TPC has requested a concession from the Porte to expand operations throughout Iraq."
 OTT_Basra_Concessions: "Sell off Basra Concessions"
 OTT_Basra_Concessions_desc: "Although a large part of the Basra vilayet was given in concession to the British Empire after the Weltkrieg, many of these ran out of time and were forced to be turned back over to the Ottoman government. Although the government has thus far refrained from offering them up for sale, to protect its own Kirkuk production, they could help reinvigorate the Iraqi economy."

### Political (Fevzi)
 OTT_State_of_Emergency: "State of Emergency"
 OTT_State_of_Emergency_desc: "The assassination of the Grand Vizier has shown that the Ottoman state is held captive by radical Islamist extremists, opposed to the unstoppable tide of progress and unwilling to recognise the decay of Ottoman power. We cannot give in to their lack of reason, and as such have to take any measures necessary to ensure the dream of the CUP and OHF remains intact!"
 OTT_Replace_Walis: "Recall the Walis"
 OTT_Replace_Walis_desc: "Complacency and a lack of enthusiasm amongst the ruling cadre has steadily led to a decrease in quality and ability of our Walis or governors. If the Ottoman state is to prosper, these corrupt, decadent and unscrupulous individuals have to been torn out and replaced by those loyal to the regime and its grand vision for the future!"
 OTT_Abolish_Mecelle_Fevzi: "Abolish the Mecelle Code"
 OTT_Abolish_Mecelle_Fevzi_desc: "Following the suggestions made by the Judicial Commission, the time has finally come to rid ourselves of the Mecelle. A new civil code, fully secular in nature, will treat all Ottoman citizens as equals and will show the desire to tear down the last conservative anchor points."
 OTT_Reform_the_Millet_System: "Reform the Millet System"
 OTT_Reform_the_Millet_System_desc: "The Millet System was a creation to ensure that Ottoman citizens who did not practise the Islamic faith could govern themselves, and as such, limit sectarian conflict. This has over the years however led to non-Muslim citizens almost completely detaching themselves from the Empire, and has encouraged the disaster that followed in the Balkans. With a new Civil Code, surely this system is no longer necessary?"
 OTT_Confiscate_Privy_Purse_Holdings: "Confiscate the Privy Purse Holdings"
 OTT_Confiscate_Privy_Purse_Holdings_desc: "Although the power of the monarchy has seen a steady decline these last few decades under the supervision of ambitious party figures, the crown is still the direct owner of vast swathes of the empire and uses these lands for their own benefit and enrichment. That they are depriving the state of resources in a state of crisis should be unacceptable and will only fund the religious extremists."
 OTT_Marechal_Nous_Voila: "\"Mareşal biz buradayız!\""
 OTT_Marechal_Nous_Voila_desc: "'Marshal, here we are!' has steadily developed to be a catchphrase amongst allies of the military regime who see in the great Fevzi Pasha the saviour of the Kemalist dream and a bulwark of stability and prosperity against both religious extremists and socialist revolutionaries."
 OTT_Expand_the_Military_Rusdiye: "Expand the Military Rüşdiye"
 OTT_Expand_the_Military_Rusdiye_desc: "The Rüşdiye were a sort of High School set up as part of the Tanzimat reforms in 1845 to provide for education in the European style. Besides these schools however a variety of military preparatory schools were set up in Anatolia and Iraq to install a disciplined and patriotic spirit into the students. These schools are now the target of education reform, aimed at further strengthening the loyalty to the state."
 OTT_Consolidate_Military_Dictatorship: "Consolidate the Military Dictatorship"
 OTT_Consolidate_Military_Dictatorship_desc: "Even though the Marshal supports the notion of democracy, and initially planned an immediate return to parliamentary rule, he has steadily grown disillusioned with the political establishment. Seeing them as a disease weakening the empire from the inside, perfidious voices all around him have urged the Marshal to maintain military rule on the state until we can be absolutely sure our interests are safe."
 OTT_Lift_State_of_Emergency: "Lift the State of Emergency"
 OTT_Lift_State_of_Emergency_desc: "Although the Marshal has shown his clear disgust for the weakness of the decentralists which has led to the crisis the empire only recently has been plummeted in, he still supports the notion of democracy and with the nation stabilised and the economy recovering, he has in cooperation with various political figures decided to hand power back to the establishment and lift the state of emergency."
 OTT_reorganize_the_military: "Reorganise the Military"
 OTT_reorganize_the_military_desc: "The Ottoman army has suffered too many setbacks and its incompetence is linked to its connection to politics. Now that the Marshal has his hand on the power, everything must start with a reorganisation of the army.Officers must review new battle plans and soldiers return to training."
 OTT_infallible_army: "An Infallible Army"
 OTT_infallible_army_desc: "The Ottoman army was given a complete review. The efficiency of the soltats must have been greatly improved. It should be able to protect the empire and the state in case of war."
 OTT_relinquish_some_powers: "Relinquish Certain Powers"
 OTT_relinquish_some_powers_desc: "Although the Marshal leads the nation with an iron fist, he is a wise man. He knows that the Ottoman Empire so vast could not be ruled by a small group of men without failing. He therefore proposed certain alliances to the democrats to maintain stability and a semblance of democracy."
 OTT_cautious_progress: "Cautious Progress"
 OTT_cautious_progress_desc: "Progress was the very lifeblood of the OHF and its predecessors' government. Now that he has taken over the Marshal must remain in continuity. However, he has understood that too many reforms are detrimental to the stability of the country. It is necessary to be careful and to take the time to make the people accept them."
 OTT_new_military_dictatorship: "A New Military Dictatorship"
 OTT_new_military_dictatorship_desc: "20 years after the fall of the CUP triumvirate, a new dictatorship rules the empire. This time led by a single, confident man. It will put the empire back on the right track and lead it to make the right choices for the future of the Ottoman state."

 OTT_Enshrine_Endeavour_Front: "Enshrine the 'Endeavour Front'"
 OTT_Enshrine_Endeavour_Front_desc: "Including key politicians from all factions, both decentralist and centralist, this 'Endeavour' front strives to provide a stable transitional government until all foreign threats have abated and the internal situation has been pacified. Consisting largely of military figures loyal to either the OHF or DF, the front nonetheless also includes various Arabs and other minorities to ensure a lasting peace."
 OTT_Centralise_State_Authority: "Centralise State Authority"
 OTT_Centralise_State_Authority_desc: "It is only through strong central authority that the far-flung regions of the empire can be kept safe and secure. That the decentralists believe we should give in to nationalist and autonomist movements is an outrage and will only lead to the collapse of the Ottoman state and its further dismemberment by foreign vultures."
 OTT_Lift_Maintenance_Public_Order_Decree: "Lift the Maintenance of Public Order Decree"
 OTT_Lift_Maintenance_Public_Order_Decree_desc: "Enacted during the aftermath of the political chaos that has gripped us these last few years, the decree served well in enabling emergency measures and swift retribution throughout the lands. As the threat abates however and the foreign threat relinquishes, there is no longer any need for such extreme measures."
 OTT_Disband_Trials_Progress: "Disband the Tribunals of Progress"
 OTT_Disband_Trials_Progress_desc: "Having served their goal in the eradication of domestic terrorist organisations and vicious plots, the feared military tribunals will be closed down and normal law and order will retake its rightful position in Ottoman society."
 OTT_Cooperate_Private_Sector: "Cooperate with the Private Sector"
 OTT_Cooperate_Private_Sector_desc: "An alliance of the public and private sector, the new OHF is toning down its étatist rhetoric in favour of closer cooperation with the capitalists and landholders of the Ottoman Empire. No one better to symbolise this marriage than Mahmud Celal Bey who after a successful career in the banking sector will now cooperate with the party into drafting a new economic plan."
 OTT_Vilayet_Reorganisation: "Reorganise the Vilayet System"
 OTT_Vilayet_Reorganisation_desc: "The current size of our Vilayets is far too large, and as such encourage concentration of power within local figures. By reducing the size of them and through the expansion of our telegraph and radio network, we can make them more dependent on the capital and have less power to mismanage."
 OTT_Emancipation_Vanguard_FEV: "Emancipation Vanguard"
 OTT_Emancipation_Vanguard_FEV_desc: "Through the co-education act, we have laid the first bricks on the road to emancipation. Nonetheless this is only the beginning as the OHF now also plans to enable women to run for office and vote in the national elections. A variety of professions will also be opened up to women as the war has shown the chronic lack of labour force amongst the Anatolian people."
 OTT_Millet_Mektepleri_FEV: "Millet Mektepleri"
 OTT_Millet_Mektepleri_FEV_desc: "The Millet Mektepleri or Nation School is the brainchild of Minister of Education Mustafa Necati and has a grand aim to make the entire Ottoman population literate. Focusing on the age bracket 14-45, these 'schools' are compulsory for all citizens including women and prisoners. After completing a test, the participants will be granted a certificate from the state and join the Modern Ottoman society."
 OTT_Incorporate_Kadroist_Movement: "Incorporate the Kadroist Movement"
 OTT_Incorporate_Kadroist_Movement_desc: "Based on the writings of the 'Kadro' paper, there has been a push by the radicalists within the OHF to follow the example of European nations and discard with the notion of a liberal parliamentary democracy as the ideal. Striving for populism, heavy state control and the creation of a vanguard to lift up the ignorant masses, their message is finding a welcoming ear amongst the squabbling OHF elite."
 OTT_Committee_Inquest: "Establish the Committee of Inquest"
 OTT_Committee_Inquest_desc: "As the threat to our government remains real, the party has decided to enact emergency measures in the shape of the Tahkikat komisyonu (Committee of Inquest). This committee, consisting solely of OHF hardliners, has been organised like a court with the power to imprison any perceived threat to the state. Other political parties have also been dismantled with their leaders tried by the new Committee whilst the press is silenced."
 OTT_Nationalise_Basic_Industries: "Nationalise the Basic Industries"
 OTT_Nationalise_Basic_Industries_desc: "Although the Kemalists made massive strides in their plans to bring the state economy under government control, they have clearly not gone far enough. All basic industries, tobacco, textile, minerals, oil, banks and much more are to be immediately brought under government commissions which will determine the new, better, course of the Ottoman economy."
 OTT_Social_Nationalism: "Embrace Social Nationalism"
 OTT_Social_Nationalism_desc: "Where Western society was already too late and where Russia struggled, the Ottoman Empire provides a solution to the issue of the bourgeoisie. Strongly believing that the empire does not yet have a well established middle and upper class (although many disagree), the Kadroists believe that it is the perfect place to work towards a classless society wherein all can be truly equal, united behind the banner of the Sublime Porte."
 OTT_Enact_Separation_Church_State: "Enact the Separation of Church and State"
 OTT_Enact_Separation_Church_State_desc: "If the Empire is ever to advance towards a secular institution, we have to take decisive action against the various religious organisations shouting their opposition to the reforms. The Sufi orders form the most significant hurdle in this as they not only de facto control Eastern Anatolia but have direct contacts with the Caliph who they utilise to remain in power. No more!"
 OTT_Union_Party_State: "Fulfil the Union of Party and State"
 OTT_Union_Party_State_desc: "Such as the populists in Russia have achieved, there can no longer be a difference between party and state. The party will from now on become the state and have the complete monopoly on any and all governmental matters. The Caliph, a puppet soon to be torn down, will be allowed to keep his crown but all reactionaries still standing will be brought to swift justice."
 OTT_A_New_State: "A New State"
 OTT_A_New_State_desc: "Now that the Kadroist revolution is over, we can start the reforms that the people need. The creation of a One Party State is only the first step of the Kadro theory. Now that the cadres are in charge of the country, they must force the ignorant population to abandon all forms of discrimination based on tradition. The New State must be the beacon that all people seek in the darkness."
 OTT_Turn_Towards_Etatism: "Turn Further into Statism"
 OTT_Turn_Towards_Etatism_desc: "Being in partial statism is more dangerous than liberalism. It is necessary to increase the power of the State over the economy. The State must plan the finance and also create economic plans to follow so that the market cannot contribute to the continuation of the inequalities."
 OTT_Achieve_the_Classless_society: "Achieve the Classless Society"
 OTT_Achieve_the_Classless_society_desc: "The class struggle is not applicable to the empire because there are in fact no classes as such in the empire. Only rural and urban people. The society must be unified in order to annihilate any possible inequality. For this, the state had to apply strong and sometimes difficult social reforms."
 OTT_Socialist_Biased_Neutrality: "A Socialist Biased Neutrality"
 OTT_Socialist_Biased_Neutrality_desc: "The Ottoman Empire cannot forget the disaster of the World War. However, with the shock caused by the numerous revolts in our country and the attempt to destroy it by our neighboring countries, new measures must be taken. The Empire will remain neutral but will allow itself any intervention justified for its protection and interest. All this to protect the revolutionary and social cause."
 OTT_Solidarism_Between_People: "Solidarism Between Peoples"
 OTT_Solidarism_Between_People_desc: "The Ottoman Empire is vast and composed of many peoples. The objective of the OHF and Kadro is to further incorporate these peoples. To remove all national distinctions and unify the peoples in Ottoman modernity now that all rebellion has been quelled.For that we will use Solidarism, an ideology destroying the traditional barriers between individuals to create only one indivisible people."
 OTT_Encourage_Private_Initiative_FEV: "Encourage Private Initiative"
 OTT_Encourage_Private_Initiative_FEV_desc: "The concept of Private Initiative or teşebbüs-ü Şahsi serves most prominently in the discourse of Sabahattin whom has identified its lack as one of the main reasons for Ottoman decline. Based on the ideas of Demolin, the Vizier pleads for looking for achievement in yourself and self-confidence and not relying on family or state, supporting the notion of private ownership as crucial to the social and economic development of the empire."
 OTT_Break_Up_State_Monopolies_FEV: "Break up State Monopolies"
 OTT_Break_Up_State_Monopolies_FEV_desc: "Although the DF largely pushes for a liberal agenda in the social sense, it is also no stranger to its economic ideals, and believes that the large state monopolies set up by the CUP and OHF the last few decades, have seriously hampered the economic growth of the Ottoman Empire. Stifling competition and innovation, the government now pushes for privatisation of these monopolies in an attempt to stimulate the free market."
 OTT_Multi_Level_Democracy_FEV: "Corruption Commissions"
 OTT_Multi_Level_Democracy_FEV_desc: "Faith in Konstantiniyye has been shattered as of late and with that a precipitous rise of extortion, tax-evasion, and bribery. The provincials have been neglected for far too long as the upper echelons of government have writhed with a revolving door of administrations. Now the state will make a bold push towards transparent governance and regardless of cost or effectiveness the people will be made to see our earnest commitment to cleaning up the provinces."
 OTT_Imperial_Literacy_FEV: "Imperial Literacy Campaign"
 OTT_Imperial_Literacy_FEV_desc: "Education serves as the basis for any functional society, and the lack thereof can be identified as the root cause of our decline for "Living with personal effort needs much virtue. However, we do not have such qualities because of our raising and education style. We want to live without working, we demand wealth without giving effort therefore we aim to become civil servants at the state. Explicitly, our present poverty stems from our educational system."
 OTT_Dismantle_Endeavour_Front: "Dismantle the 'Endeavour Front'"
 OTT_Dismantle_Endeavour_Front_desc: "As stability returns to the Ottoman Empire, the need for an all encompassing coalition has disappeared. With our policies these last few months decisively favouring one of the two main power blocs within the coalition, it is only normal that the Sultan will now appoint the leader of said faction as his new Grand Vizier. Let us pray that true and profound beliefs in democracy will finally be achieved."
 OTT_Enshrine_Principles_People: "Enshrine the Principles of the People"
 OTT_Enshrine_Principles_People_desc: "Forming the core tenets of the Kemalist ideology, the principles of the people are based on the Chinese ideas but adapted to suit the Ottoman state. Populism, Nationalism, Statism and Reformism will from now until forever guide the Turkish people to an ever brighter future!"
 OTT_Statutes_of_Autonomy_FEV: "Adopt Statutes of Personal Autonomy"
 OTT_Statutes_of_Autonomy_FEV_desc: "Although a Federation model failed to materialise with the reintroduction of political democracy new momentum has been building for the cause of National Personal Autonomy. First decried as a new Millet System in fact these new self-organised bodies will be indifferent to geographic expression and be responsible for the education and cultural institutions of its members but still submit to the authority of the central government."
 OTT_Join_Reichspakt_Fevzi: "Join the Reichspakt"
 OTT_Join_Reichspakt_Fevzi_desc: "Although relations with Berlin have cooled since the collapse of the Kemalist regime, we cannot deny that it is German military might that protects the Empire from the Russian bear, and despite concerns from pacifists, we have no choice but to recognise that if the Porte wishes to partake in the New World Order, we must stand united with the Germans in their time of need."
 OTT_Join_Entente_Fevzi: "Join the Entente"
 OTT_Join_Entente_Fevzi_desc: "Despicable traitors to all Islam during the Weltkrieg, you will be hard-pressed to find a living soul willing to speak positively of the reactionary French slave state or their Anglo dogs, but, it cannot be denied that the geopolitical reality is leaving us with little choice. German might is crumbling and the clear industrial and military power of the United States may be all that's left to rebuke the Russian bear."
 OTT_Join_Copro_Fevzi: "Join the Co-prosperity Sphere"
 OTT_Join_Copro_Fevzi_desc: "As the balance of power shifts from West to East and an alliance between American capital and Japanese spirit has been formed, the time has arrived for the Porte to also relinquish its ties to the old world. Standing strong with our Japanese friends and backed by the industrial might of the US of A, none will be able to oppose us!"

### Foreign Policy (Fevzi)
 OTT_Abolish_Full_Neutrality_Fevzi: "Abolish Full Neutrality"
 OTT_Abolish_Full_Neutrality_Fevzi_desc: "We should not kid ourselves any longer. The world is at war and the time for choosing has arrived. We could remain on the sidelines and watch as all sides plunge themselves into despair, but then we would also have to contend ourselves with having no allies, no partners and an insecure future in the post-war world. Do we really want to risk that?"
 OTT_Revise_German_Bilateral_Agreement: "Revise the German Bilateral Agreement"
 OTT_Revise_German_Bilateral_Agreement_desc: "Established already during the Weltkrieg and continued after, various agreements and trade deals between the German and Ottoman empires play a key role in the economy of the Sublime Porte. With war soon upon us and a clear lack of equipment noticeable within the armed forces, a proposal has been made to provide agricultural produce at lower prices in exchange for German military aid."
 OTT_Increase_Ties_German_Empire: "Reinforce Ties to Berlin"
 OTT_Increase_Ties_German_Empire_desc: "As our former allies in the Weltkrieg, many in Turkey have maintained that a permanent alliance to the German state is in the best interests of both countries and have continually asked the OHF cabinets to work towards this goal. With the army now in charge, it seems the time has come to fully realise these plans and bind the two powers closer than ever before."
 OTT_Embargo_the_Internationale: "Embargo the Internationale"
 OTT_Embargo_the_Internationale_desc: "Although the syndicalist bloc has not directly destabilised our state, lacking the educated population or unions to sway, it is however rapidly becoming clear that a confrontation will eventually be upon us, and it would be in our best interests to stick to the same marching order that the German Empire propagates."
 OTT_embargo_INT_tt: "(Every country in a faction with §Y [FRA.GetFlag] [FRA.GetNameDef]§!):\n   Trade relations with §Y[OTT.GetNameDef]§! changed by §R-200§!.\n   §Y[OTT.GetNameWithFlag]§!'s trade relations with them §R-200§!."
 OTT_Ottoman_German_Research_Fevzi: "Ottoman-German Research Initiative"
 OTT_Ottoman_German_Research_Fevzi_desc: "Ottoman scientific expertise is severely lacking, not least because the literacy rate of the Empire is abominable. Furthermore, the Empire was never really able to catch up with the west in terms of military development and has since mostly relied on imported goods. Through our newfound connections to the German Empire, we can both access better equipment and educate our own people for the future."
 OTT_Vanguard_in_the_South_Fevzi: "Vanguard in the South"
 OTT_Vanguard_in_the_South_Fevzi_desc: "Just like Belgium in the West and Lithuania in the East, we form Germany's Southern frontier and are as such tasked with an important role in guaranteeing their possessions in the region. From geographical features such as the Suez to the Caucasus to strategic ones such as the Oil fields of Iraq and the Chromite mines of Anatolia, we are an invaluable cog in the great machine of the Kaiser."

### Political (Sabahattin)
 OTT_Grand_Vizier_Sabahattin: "Grand Vizier Sabahattin"
 OTT_Grand_Vizier_Sabahattin_desc: "The most prominent Ottoman sociologist, Mehmed Sabâhaddin, has been appointed Grand Vizier by the Padishah. The prince who has had a tumultuous past, being forced into exile both under Abdulhamid II in 1899 and two CUP governments, returned after the political détente in the wake of the Great War and has asserted himself as the main force within the decentralist movement. With his appointment, it seems more than likely that he will finally push through his agenda."
 OTT_Reform_the_Gendarmerie: "Reform the Ottoman Gendarmerie"
 OTT_Reform_the_Gendarmerie_desc: "After the abolition of the Janissary corps in the early 19th century, a variety of military organisations were established to ensure order and stability in the provinces of Rumelia and Anatolia. With the proclamation of the Tanzimat reforms in 1839, these organisations were combined into the Jandarma (Ottoman Gendarmerie). This organisation however suffers from an over-reliance on Turkish manpower in its upper cadres, making it a prime target for reform."
 OTT_Break_Up_State_Monopolies: "Break up State Monopolies"
 OTT_Break_Up_State_Monopolies_desc: "Although the HIF primarily pushes for a liberal agenda in the social sense, it is also no stranger to its economic ideals, and believes that the large state monopolies set up by the CUP and OHF the last few decades, have seriously hampered the economic growth of the Ottoman Empire. Stifling competition and innovation, the government now pushes for privatisation of these monopolies in an attempt to stimulate the free market."
 OTT_Encourage_Private_Initiative: "Encourage Private Initiative"
 OTT_Encourage_Private_Initiative_desc: "The concept of Private Initiative or teşebbüs-ü Şahsi serves most prominently in the discourse of Sabahattin whom has identified its lack as one of the main reasons for Ottoman decline. Based on the ideas of Demolin, the Vizier pleads for looking for achievement in yourself and self-confidence and not relying on family or state, supporting the notion of private ownership as crucial to the social and economic development of the empire."
 OTT_Multi_Level_Democracy: "Multi-Level Democracy"
 OTT_Multi_Level_Democracy_desc: "Although Sabahattin originally did not plead for autonomy, his discourse of decentralisation almost solely found support amongst autonomist movements and various groups of landed elite. They, seeing the centralising state as a direct threat to their own status, support a system of multi-level democracy wherein not just the Chamber of Deputies but also Provincial Assemblies can be empowered to serve their local units."
 OTT_Shift_Power_to_the_Provincial_Assembly: "Shift Power to the Provincial Assemblies"
 OTT_Shift_Power_to_the_Provincial_Assembly_desc: "With the creation of Provincial Assemblies a fact, the process of administrative reorganisation has commenced, shifting more and more authority away from the central government in favour of these local bodies. These assemblies, serving as quasi-mini-parliaments for the various regions of the Empire, will better cater to the local cultural and economic needs of the population, as such uplifting the empire as a whole."
 OTT_Revise_the_Mecelle: "Revise the Mecelle"
 OTT_Revise_the_Mecelle_desc: "The civil code we have used since the Tanzimat era or the Mecelle code was first codified in 1877. Based on the Islamic Hanafi legal tradition, the code was the first enforcement of a unified law over all Ottoman citizens who previously according to the Millet system used their own codes. It nonetheless strongly favours the Sunni population of the empire, leading to demands from Christians and Shi'ites alike to replace it with a more modern equivalent."
 OTT_Equality_before_the_Law: "Equality before the Law"
 OTT_Equality_before_the_Law_desc: "Although the Ottoman constitution dictates the equality before the law for all Ottoman groups, regardless of religion or ethnicity, the empire remains heavily biased towards its Muslim majority, whose rights are better protected and catered to in all sections of the Ottoman bureaucracy. The Mecelle, based on the Sharia, stands as a key pillar within this and will need strong revision if true equality is to be achieved."
 OTT_Distribute_Miri_Land: "Redistribute Miri Land"
 OTT_Distribute_Miri_Land_desc: "Although the ideas of private land ownership were introduced into the Ottoman Empire during the 19th century and land redistribution was performed, large parts of the Empire still remain either state or direct royal property. This absence of private land tenure decreases production, which brings despotism since there is no cause for people to work. As the liberals believe that humanity needs freedom to succeed, we must open these lands to private individuals."
 OTT_Repeal_Unification_Law: "Repeal the Unification Decree"
 OTT_Repeal_Unification_Law_desc: "The Unification and Co-education decree, a testament of OHF intentions to reform the state into a secular and modern society, is seen by many conservatives in our coalition as an insult to Islam itself, whilst many liberals see in its centralist approach to education an attack on the Millet system and the initiative of private individuals. Serving as the main election promise on which our coalition was built, its repeal is of the utmost essence."
 OTT_Abolish_Senate: "Abolish the Meclis-i Ayan"
 OTT_Abolish_Senate_desc: "The Meclis-i Ayan, the Ottoman equivalent of the Senate, served little use in our political system, being primarily a way for the Padishah to place individuals favourable to his own ideas in positions which could overrule decisions made in the Chamber of Deputies. This extra weight, which only really served to grant excessive salaries to the elite, has been rendered useless as the combination of provincial and the central assemblies provide enough oversight without royal interference."
 OTT_Imperial_Literacy_Campaign: "Imperial Literacy Campaign"
 OTT_Imperial_Literacy_Campaign_desc: "Education serves as the basis for any functional society, and the lack thereof can be identified as the root cause of our decline for "Living with personal effort needs much virtue. However, we do not have such qualities because of our raising and education style. We want to live without working, we demand wealth without giving effort therefore we aim to become civil servants at the state. Explicitly, our present poverty stems from our educational system."
 OTT_Revise_Millet: "Revise the Millet System"
 OTT_Revise_Millet_desc: "Since the new Ottoman Civil Code already guarantees equality to all groups within the empire and the provincial assemblies already increase their say in affairs pertaining to their own culture or province, the need for the Millet system has been put into doubt as it currently only causes extra bureaucratic messiness and needless administrative levels."
 OTT_The_Sublime_Federation: "The Sublime Federation"
 OTT_The_Sublime_Federation_desc: "Although Sabahattin was fiercely opposed to the creation of a federal model, the HIF has had no choice but to base their programme on one of provincial autonomy, as its main supporters, consisting of minority groups, continue to push for more rights. Therefore, the creation of a federal Ottoman system has become unavoidable. This federation, led by the federal assembly and with the provincial assemblies serving as its sub-states, promises to improve the lives of every Ottoman."

### Political (Arslan)
 OTT_Grand_Vizier_Arslan: "Grand Vizier Arslan"
 OTT_Grand_Vizier_Arslan_desc: "A Druze prince from the region of Lebanon, Shakib Arslan is well known in conservative circles as Amir al-Bayān ("Prince of Eloquence") and plays a key role in the islamist movement of the empire. Although it may be seen as shocking that a non-Turk was able to achieve the office of Grand Vizier, it is also a clear signal of Kostantiniyye that the growing Arab movement needs a powerful answer."
 OTT_Promote_Panislamism: "Promote Pan-Islamism"
 OTT_Promote_Panislamism_desc: "Harking back to the origins of Islam itself, the idea of pan-Islamism was brought back to the forefront by the Ottoman sultans in the late 18th century, to exert influence over the Muslim subjects of the Czar, and to provide a metaphorical glue to the citizens of the Porte. Its greatest success can be found amongst the subjects of the Mashriq, as it ensured a degree of loyalty to the Sultan throughout the war that would likely have been reduced without the efforts of various Islamists"
 OTT_Jizya: "Institute the Varlık Vergisi"
 OTT_Jizya_desc: "The 'Varlık Vergisi' is a specific war tax which targets rich Armenians and Jews to fund the operations of the government. By putting exorbitant burdens on these groups, the policy both serves to remedy the ever-increasing deficit and to bolster the 'National Economy' by pushing the non-Muslims out of business and encourage take-overs by Muslim citizens."
 OTT_Empower_Sheikh: "Empower the Seyhülislam"
 OTT_Empower_Sheikh_desc: "The role of the Şeyhülislam can best be understood as the Grand Mufti of all Muslims within the Ottoman Empire. Residing over the Ulama, he is responsible for the writing of fatwas and ensures order and discipline within the religious hierarchy making him only second to the Caliph himself. Nonetheless his power was greatly hindered during the CUP regime as he was reduced to a tool to dweep the masses. This needs readjustment!"
 OTT_Religious_Education: "Prioritise Religious Education"
 OTT_Religious_Education_desc: "Fiercely opposed to the idea that religious education should take a backseat to the sciences, the education ministry has revised the complete curriculum and has inserted various traditional ideas and obligatory Islamic classes. Nonetheless, Arslan's ideas do not condemn all forms of modernisation, and they do not refute that which science has proven. He speaks out against imitation of the West but recognises that there are lessons to be learned from them."
 OTT_Revise_Constitution: "Revise the Constitution"
 OTT_Revise_Constitution_desc: "As Parliament continues to prove a thorn in our sight, the conservatives are now pushing for the restoration of the right to prorogue parliament without its permission and as such give the Sultan the power to push through the necessary reforms without parliamentary oversight. For after all, shouldn't the Caliph be able to enact his own decrees and reforms?"
 OTT_Enforce_Mecelle: "Enforce the Mecelle"
 OTT_Enforce_Mecelle_desc: "The civil code we have used since the Tanzimat era or the Mecelle code was first codified in 1877. Based on the Islamic Hanafi legal tradition, the code was the first enforcement of a unified law over all Ottoman citizens who previously according to the Millet system used their own codes. Throughout the years our goodwill has been misused by our minorities who have used it to escape Ottoman justice."
 OTT_Revert_Social_Reforms: "Revert Social Reforms"
 OTT_Revert_Social_Reforms_desc: "The Kemalists and their allies have besmirched the good name of the Caliphate with their social reforms who are in clear contradiction to the Scriptures. Not only have they encouraged and actively supported an emancipation and unveilment movement, they have also attacked education, justice and other core tenets of our society. If we are to lay a new path, we will need to undo their foolish mistakes."
 OTT_Desecularise_Army: "Desecularise the Army"
 OTT_Desecularise_Army_desc: "Infiltrated by Kemalist stooges and secularists, the armed forces of our Grand Caliphate have been besmirched by their bad moral reputation. Furthermore, they hang over our heads like a Sword of Damocles as they proved in 1909 when they brutally repressed our predecessors during a peaceful demonstration in the capital. They must be torn out if we are to create our new Ottoman state!"
 OTT_Caliphate_Of_Old: "The Caliphate of Old"
 OTT_Caliphate_Of_Old_desc: "When the Armies of Islam knocked on the gates of Vienna, none questioned the might of the Ottoman Empire and its Caliph. Now look at us! Suffering defeat after defeat, the empire has been dismantled by the follower of the Cross whilst abroad our Muslim brethren are being coerced into cheap Western imitation and complacency, refusing to recognise their roots. Under our Caliph, we shall show them the true path!"
 OTT_Mosque_Renovation_Program: "Refurbish Places of Worship"
 OTT_Mosque_Renovation_Program_desc: "Home to the holiest places in all Islam, the Ottoman Empire has in the last few decades nonetheless often shirked its duty to maintain these places of worship and ensure their further development. Mosques in Diyarbakir, Damascus, Baghdad, Kostantiniyye and even in the Hejaz itself are showing clear signs of neglect. We will no longer stand for this rejection of our traditions!"

### Foreign (Liberal)
 OTT_Renovate_Sublime_Porte: "Renovate the Sublime Porte"
 OTT_Renovate_Sublime_Porte_desc: "Although used as a nickname for the central government of the Ottoman Empire, the Sublime Porte or Bab-ı Ali also refers to the entrance of the ministries across Topkapi. Sadly many of these buildings were badly harmed in a fire in 1911 and as such there was a relocation of many of its former inhabitants to the Dolmabahce. With restorations completed, the foreign ministry can finally return."
 OTT_Join_Entente: "Join the Entente"
 OTT_Join_Entente_desc: "Despicable traitors to all Islam during the Weltkrieg, you will be hard-pressed to find a living soul willing to speak positively of the reactionary French slave state or their Anglo dogs, but, it cannot be denied that the geopolitical reality is leaving us with little choice. German might is crumbling and the clear industrial and military power of the United States may be all that's left to rebuke the Russian bear."
 OTT_Join_Reichspakt: "Join the Reichspakt"
 OTT_Join_Reichspakt_desc: "Although relations with Berlin have cooled since the rise of the liberal coalition to power, we cannot deny that it is German military might that protects the Empire from the Russian bear, and despite concerns from pacifists, we have no choice but to recognise that if the Porte wishes to partake in the New World Order, we must stand united with the Germans in their time of need."
 OTT_Join_Copro: "Join the Co-prosperity Sphere"
 OTT_Join_Copro_desc: "As the balance of power shifts from West to East and an alliance between American capital and Japanese spirit has been formed, the time has arrived for the Porte to also relinquish its ties to the old world. Standing strong with our Japanese friends and backed by the industrial might of the US of A, none will be able to oppose us!"
 OTT_Interventionism_Middle_East: "Interventionism in the Middle East"
 OTT_Interventionism_Middle_East_desc: "Carved up by British hawks and Arab warlords, our subjects on the Arab peninsula have long been drifting apart from us, and have established their own spheres of influence, running counter to our interests. As it befalls the Caliph of all Islam however, it is our duty to protect the safety of the Muslim people and free them from foreign, non-Turkish, meddling."
 OTT_Support_Maghrebi_Rebels: "Support Maghrebi Rebels"
 OTT_Support_Maghrebi_Rebels_desc: "From Morocco to the former Ottoman regencies of Algiers, Tunis and Tripolitania, the Maghrebis are held dear in the heart of our government and suffering the hardest from the effects of colonialism. We shall work together to secure a free and strong Maghreb!"
 OTT_Reintegrate_MOJ: "Reintegrate the M.O.J."
 OTT_Reintegrate_MOJ_desc: "Torn out of our grand empire by the despicable followers of Jesus Christ, the M.O.J. seems to have finally proven to the West what was already clear to us decades ago. Palestine is the homeland of Muslim Arabs and the arrival of Zionist thieves and other criminal scum has done nothing but destroy the stability and prosperity of our brethren!"
 OTT_Intervene_Arab_Unification_War: "Intervene in the Arab War of Unification"
 OTT_Intervene_Arab_Unification_War_desc: "The Houses of Rashid and Saud have been fighting a decades-long war over the ownership of Central Arabia, seeing multiple phases of open conflict interspersed with temporary armistices. Once more, the war has turned hot, and is threatening the safety of our Southern flank, and deputies from Iraq are demanding that the central government intervenes on their behalf."
 OTT_Secure_Persian_Gulf: "Secure the Persian Gulf"
 OTT_Secure_Persian_Gulf_desc: "Crucial for the economy of Iraq and with the recent discovery of oil in the wider region, the Persian (or Arab) Gulf has risen to the forefront of Ottoman foreign policy as control over the region has been deemed of the utmost importance. The independent states surrounding it have been deemed liabilities as their questionable relations to the Porte are a serious threat to Ottoman monopoly over Middle Eastern oil."
 OTT_Restore_Vilayet_of_Najd: "Restore the Vilayet of Najd"
 OTT_Restore_Vilayet_of_Najd_desc: "Our hold on the Arabian peninsula has always been a tenuous affair, as the state preferred demanding fealty from the local emirs, than exert direct control. Change was brought to this when Midhat Pasha retook al-Hasa and extended Ottoman control further inland, but pressed on all fronts, the Saudis were able to force us out in 1913. With the discovery of oil, the time has come to restore our rule over the Gulf. "
 OTT_Incorporate_Muscat: "Incorporate Muscat and Oman"
 OTT_Incorporate_Muscat_desc: "Once a proud empire, the lands of the Sultans of Muscat have as one of the only in the Middle East never been subdued by the armies of the Caliph as friendly relations between the two powers rendered any prolonged military operations unnecessary. The once powerful fleet of Muscat has disappeared now however, and subject to Wahhabist raids, plagued by internal division and shouldering a paranoid and ineffective Sultan, it should be our duty to bring prosperity to Muscat."
 OTT_Incorporate_Coastal_Emirates: "Incorporate Coastal Emirates"
 OTT_Incorporate_Coastal_Emirates_desc: "The various Sheikhdoms of the Arab Gulf prospered greatly under British protection, neglecting their duties to the Caliph and indirectly assisting in its demise. When British might disintegrated after their revolution, it was to Ottoman banners that they nonetheless flocked, hoping to preserve their thrones. Strategically important, the government in Southern Iraq has now outlined a plan to bring them closer to the Ottoman centre."
 OTT_United_against_Imperialism: "United against Imperialism"
 OTT_United_against_Imperialism_desc: "As there was no unified front against the Imperialists, one by one the proud Muslim states fell to the claws of European colonialism. We as the predominant Muslim power in the world and the centre of the Sunni faith should see it as our duty to assist our brethren of the faith, protect them and show that the spirit of the Ummah has not yet been extinguished."
 OTT_Stability_Arab_Peninsula: "Stability on the Arab Peninsula"
 OTT_Stability_Arab_Peninsula_desc: "For centuries, the inhospitable desert of Arabia has served as both a natural barrier and a path of invasion for its inhabitants. To defend the rich hinterlands of the Mashriq from said threat, we and those before us have worked with a string of allies and puppet states on the Southern flank and ensure the prosperity of Mesopotamia can't be harmed. The threat posed by the Wahhabists has shown that more than ever before, Ottoman control over Arabia is of the utmost importance."
 OTT_Secure_Oil_Shipping: "Secure Oil Shipping Routes"
 OTT_Secure_Oil_Shipping_desc: "With oil exploitation in Iraq and Bahrain accelerating in the wake of the American collapse, the strait of Hormuz is slowly but surely developing itself into the most crucial access point to these seemingly unlimited reserves. Muscat is weak, divided by overly powerful nobles, religious differences and a decaying army. As such they need our guidance and as such serve as the shield that protects the Gulf from foreign interference."
 OTT_Allies_in_the_Maghreb: "Allies in the Maghreb"
 OTT_Allies_in_the_Maghreb_desc: "Although lost almost a century ago, the various Muslim states of the Maghreb still look towards Kostantiniyye for guidance, paying their respects to the Caliph. Threatened by the Europeans in their endless drive for expansion, we should close the ranks and form a strong, united and most of all Muslim bloc."
 OTT_Allies_in_the_Orient: "Allies in the Orient"
 OTT_Allies_in_the_Orient_desc: "For decades the Ottoman Empire has fostered relations with our distant brethren of the Orient. From the deserts and mountains of East Turkestan to the plains of Central Asia and the Indian lowlands, our brethren are ready to stand together in these troubling times."
 OTT_Ottoman_Military_Missions: "Ottoman Military Missions"
 OTT_Ottoman_Military_Missions_desc: "The military reforms undertaken by our empire have led to awe from our neighbours, whose armies still rely on poorly-trained tribal militias. These nations have now requested experts from Kostantiniyye to aid them in their modernisation programmes, promising great compensation. The programme, which hopes to strengthen the Muslim bloc, serves also as an important political tool as sending Kemalist officers could strengthen domestic control over the army."
 OTT_Association_Muslim_Nations: "Found the Association of Muslim Nations"
 OTT_Association_Muslim_Nations_desc: "Envisioned as a bloc of mutual prosperity, the Association of Muslim Nations would be an economic alliance with the goal of reducing the reliance on European and American goods whilst also boosting domestic industrialisation efforts of the various participating members. If we all bind together, we can't be picked off one by one and exert a certain pressure on the powers that be."
 OTT_Council_Economic_Unity: "Found the Council of Economic Unity"
 OTT_Council_Economic_Unity_desc: "As outlined in Chapter 1 of the Economic Unity Agreement, the goals of the council are as follows: "Organise and consolidate economic relations among the States of the Arab League on bases that are consistent with the natural and historical links among them; and to provide the best conditions for flourishing their economies, developing their resources and ensuring the prosperity of their countries.""
 OTT_Railway_Connection: "Interlink the Railroads"
 OTT_Railway_Connection_desc: "With the modern age being pushed by cars and railroads, the need for an interconnected railway system has become more than apparent. Due to the difference in colonial occupants, each with their own railway gauge, we will have our work cut out for us, but plans for the unification of rail in Egypt, the Mashriq and Western Persia have already been drafted."
 OTT_Joint_Military_Planning: "Joint Military Exercises"
 OTT_Joint_Military_Planning_desc: "Built according to the Ottoman model, our allies and military partners could do with some more guidance from the Sublime Porte. To improve international cooperation and furthermore paint a strong, united picture out of the Istanbul Pact, large scale exercises in the Mediterranean and Northern Syria have already been planned."
 OTT_Reorganisation_Commision: "Reorganise the Realm"
 OTT_Reorganisation_Commision_desc: "Our vigorous desire to reform and adapt has left huge scars on the administrative structure of the realm, as positions, mandates and offices were often not granted to the most deserving or adept, but rather to those whose favour we needed the most. Now that the state has been sufficiently saved from foreign threats however, the time has come for a large-scale clean-up that will purge the empire of its corrupt underbelly."
 OTT_Abolish_Vilayet_Yerevan: "Abolish the Vilayet of Yerevan"
 OTT_Abolish_Vilayet_Yerevan_desc: "When Armenia was conquered, trouble on the ground and continued guerrilla attacks made control over this far-flung province tricky. In an attempt to pacify the population and ensure that they couldn't pose a threat to our flank, a series of military governors were installed to maintain order. Now that the empire has taken a decisively different course however, Armenian autonomy groups have pushed for the introduction of provincial assemblies."
 OTT_Integrate_Yemen: "Reintegrate the Imamate"
 OTT_Integrate_Yemen_desc: "Although a working relation with the Imamate was founded just before the Weltkrieg, it seems that the ambitions of Yahya were too great for this world and with his betrayal during the Levantine war, he has shown his true colours. Therefore it has become clear that the Imamate can no longer exist as a separate entity within the Ottoman Empire, and that it should be replaced by a series of provincial assemblies as to cater to its Sunni, Zaydi and Jewish population."
 OTT_Integrate_Tripolitania: "Reintegrate the Vilayet of Tripolitania"
 OTT_Integrate_Tripolitania_desc: "Consisting of three distinct regions, the 'Regency of Tripolitania' has been at the side of the Sultan ever since 1551. Despite its age, the government in Kostantiniyye didn't interfere much in its local affairs as its poverty made it too expensive to embark on costly military campaigns to quell the local tribes. With the importance of the Western flank rising and the threat posed by the remaining Senussi real, the time has come to rein Libya back in."
 OTT_Statutes_of_Autonomy: "Proclaim the Statutes of Autonomy"
 OTT_Statutes_of_Autonomy_desc: "Although the Federation model which the Ottoman Empire recently adopted has been seen as a massive step forwards for various autonomy and separatist movements, the expansion of Ottoman control towards Egypt, Iran and the Arab peninsula has made policy makers in Kostantiniyye move towards an even more drastic version of decentralisation, wherein provinces can choose to exert even greater control over their internal affairs."
 OTT_Reorganise_Kurdistan: "Reorganise the Kurdish Vilayets"
 OTT_Reorganise_Kurdistan_desc: "Stretching from Anatolia to Iran, the various Kurdish fiefdoms of old have now finally all been integrated within the same state, after centuries of division between Persian and Ottoman suzerains. The huge divide between the Kurdish tribes, in language, culture and religion, has made it difficult to foster a strong nationalist entity, something our government now hopes to exploit to instil a sense of Ottomanism."
 OTT_Reorganise_Azerbaijan: "Reorganise the Azeri Vilayets"
 OTT_Reorganise_Azerbaijan_desc: "Although Shi'ite compared to our Sunni population, the links between the Turkic peoples of Azerbaijan and Anatolia have always been strong, as a similar language and culture made the exchanging of ideas and goods swift and easy. Finally ripped out of the influence sphere of both Teheran and Berlin, the time has come to reunite the Turkic people and bind them together in a stronger and unbreakable bond."
 OTT_Reorganise_Khuzestan: "Integrate the Emirate of Arabistan"
 OTT_Reorganise_Khuzestan_desc: "Founded in the 15th century, the Emirate of Arabistan has survived as an independent entity in the South-West of Iran clutched in-between the Ottomans and the Persians. Although the treaty of Erzurum in 1847 gave Persia the sole authority over the Emirate, the recent war with Persia has led to the acquisition of the oil rich province. With much of its governance done through the absolute rule of the Emir, much work will be required to make them fit the 20th century."
 OTT_Reorganise_Egypt: "Reorganise the Egyptian Vilayets"
 OTT_Reorganise_Egypt_desc: "The disaster that befell the Ottoman state in the 19th century, and which was only aggravated at the turn of the 20th century, has now been corrected as [TUR.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] and Cairo are now finally reunited! To prevent this from happening again however, the government has decreed an extensive reorganisation of both parts of the Empire including economic, administrative and cultural adjustments."
 OTT_Reorganise_Sudan: "Settle the Sudanese Affair"
 OTT_Reorganise_Sudan_desc: "Although Sudan was never a core part of the Ottoman Empire, only being conquered in 1820 under the Ottoman vassal Mohammad Ali, it has now nonetheless found itself within our empire as its ancient connections to Egypt (strengthened under the Khedivate and later the Kingdom) led to its incorporation after the Levantine War. Much work is to be done however before 'Turkiyya' will truly become an Ottoman province."
 OTT_First_Elections_of_the_Grand_Assembly: "First Elections of the Grand Assembly"
 OTT_First_Elections_of_the_Grand_Assembly_desc: "As territorial expansion has brought a wide variety of peoples into our empire, the time has come to confer to them the rights of all Ottoman citizens, including the right to send representatives to the Meclis-i Mebusân (Chamber of Deputies). As the size of this body has seen exponential growth due to the vast lands we recently acquired, the body has seen its name changed to 'Büyük Meclisi' or 'Grand Assembly'."

### Economic (Liberal)
 OTT_Raise_Import_Tariffs_lib: "Raise Import Tariffs"
 OTT_Raise_Import_Tariffs_lib_desc: "To encourage domestic industry and prevent reliance on foreign construction materials and basic consumer goods, the government will raise import tariffs substantially. Although this is a great boon for the nascent Anatolian industry, many in Beirut, Alexandretta and Haifa fear that this will greatly damage their status as gateways to the Orient."
 OTT_Restrict_Foreign_Exchange_Regime_lib: "Restrict Foreign Exchange Regime"
 OTT_Restrict_Foreign_Exchange_Regime_lib_desc: "Lack of confidence in the Ottoman government has pushed many investors to sell off their Liras in favour of foreign currencies in recent months, to the detriment of its value. By restricting our domestic investors' capacity to sell off their Lira's we can strengthen our currency compared to the leading currencies of the world like the Mark."
 OTT_Quantity_Restrictions_Import_lib: "Impose Quantity Restrictions on Import"
 OTT_Quantity_Restrictions_Import_lib_desc: "Whilst the government aims to create a strong local industry, it too often finds itself relying on goods imported from the Donau-monarchy or the German Empire. Steel, machinery, chemicals, etc. are all imported which makes us not only reliant on those nations, but greatly hampers domestic goods as they can't compete with the cheap export products of the larger manufactures abroad."
 OTT_Ziraat_Bankasi_Credit_lib: "Ziraat Bankasi Credit Programme"
 OTT_Ziraat_Bankasi_Credit_lib_desc: "Originally the brainchild of Midhat Pasha, the Memleket Sandığı was reorganised into the Ziraat Bankasi in 1888. Providing stability and relief for farmers, still the majority of our population, the bank has been greatly expanded over the years. As prices for agricultural goods are in flux, following the collapse of Ukrainian and German markets, the vast reserves of the bank will be used to fight the crisis."
 OTT_Toprak_Mahsulleri_Ofisi_lib: "Open the Toprak Mahsulleri Ofisi"
 OTT_Toprak_Mahsulleri_Ofisi_lib_desc: "According to Law No 3491, this agency will prevent abnormal decrease or increase of the wheat prices against producers and consumers, will protect and regulate the wheat industry, will import or export wheat when necessary, will monitor wheat production trends and market movements in the world, will establish milling facilities and bakeries in locations to be determined and will carry on other similar tasks."
 OTT_Balance_the_Budget_lib: "Balance the Budget"
 OTT_Balance_the_Budget_lib_desc: "When the Ottoman Empire collapsed under the strain of the debts it had racked up during the Crimean War, an international organisation called the OPDA (Ottoman Public Debt Administration) essentially took over our economy. The disgrace and damage it has caused remain a vibrant memory in the minds of many Turkish economists who since have sworn to maintain a balanced budget at all cost."
 OTT_Liberalising_National_Economy: "Liberalise the National Economy"
 OTT_Liberalising_National_Economy_desc: "The National Economy model as followed by the OHF has damaged our economy beyond repair, and instead of the promised exponential economic growth, has only served to destroy the prosperity of non-Muslim subjects for the benefit of the ruling class. No more! We will tear down this racist system and in its stead, build a new and prosperous Ottoman economy."
 OTT_Imperial_Institute_Technology: "The Imperial Institute for Technology"
 OTT_Imperial_Institute_Technology_desc: "Although the Ottoman Empire boasts a fair selection of institutes for higher learning, there is a severe lack of technical expertise in the realm, which has severely complicated the industrialisation of the empire. To solve this, the government has proposed to open the Imperial Institute for Technology in Kostantiniyye, in close cooperation with academics from Austria and Germany."
 OTT_Repeal_National_Protection_Law: "Repeal the National Protection Law"
 OTT_Repeal_National_Protection_Law_desc: "Enacted by the Kemalist government to protect the nascent Turkish industry, the national protection law put severe limits on Turkish imports, banning all imports for goods such as processed food, alcohol, shoes, leather goods and other consumer goods. Furthermore, the imports of even materials such as cement received restriction which according to the DF greatly stifled the private sector."
 OTT_Enable_Foreign_Investment: "Enable Foreign Investment"
 OTT_Enable_Foreign_Investment_desc: "Although foreign investment was never blocked by the Kemalist government, who pursued a policy of cooperation between the private and public sector, funded largely by foreign credit, they did make it harder for Ottoman enterprises themselves to solicit foreign funding without going through a state institution. That this has stifled growth is universally agreed on by the liberals and will no longer do!"
 OTT_Foreign_Capital_Incentives_Law: "The Foreign Capital Incentives Law"
 OTT_Foreign_Capital_Incentives_Law_desc: "Enacted at the request of the DF, the Law on Encouragement of Foreign Capital is meant to reinvigorate the Ottoman economy and make it more accessible for foreign investors through principles such as “free transfer” and “national treatment”. Heavy resistance to the bill was uttered by the OHF however who see this as the destruction of the National Economy model."
 OTT_Mesopotamian_Oil_Exploration: "Mesopotamian Oil Exploration"
 OTT_Mesopotamian_Oil_Exploration_desc: "Although most operations of the TPC and its German-Dutch allies are centred around Kirkuk and Mosul in the North of Iraq, large untapped reserves have recently been discovered in the South of Iraq, near the important harbours of Basra and Kuwait. Since these are also already tightly connected to the Iraqi rail network, TPC has requested a concession from the Porte to expand operations throughout Iraq."
 OTT_Import_Agricultural_Equipment: "Import Agricultural Equipment"
 OTT_Import_Agricultural_Equipment_desc: "Although the Ottoman Empire, unlike Egypt, is not yet capped by the size of its agricultural lands, there has nonetheless been a great drive to improve the efficiency of the large estates dotted around the country, through the use of modern equipment. Where the Kemalists primarily intended to set up domestic production of these tools, the liberals have shown a desire to skip this step and import directly from Europe."
 OTT_Berlin_Baghdad_Exploitation_Rights: "Berlin-Baghdad Exploitation Rights"
 OTT_Berlin_Baghdad_Exploitation_Rights_desc: "When the original deal for the Berlin-Baghdad railroad was signed with German investors, they were given extensive land grants on either side of the tracks to fully develop and exploit. This arrangement changed near the end of the war however as large investors such as Deutsche Bank pulled out of the project, fearing an imminent collapse of the Ottoman state. Lacking domestic funds, we should bring this deal back."
 OTT_Opel_Tophane_Factory: "Opel Tophane Factory"
 OTT_Opel_Tophane_Factory_desc: "Long discussed with Opel, the idea of a German automotive company establishing a production facility in the Ottoman Empire to cater to the rapidly growing demand for cars in the Middle East is not new. Disagreements about the financing and the nationality of its workers constantly postponed the idea. It was never buried however and our liberal government seems more than willing to reopen negotiations."
 OTT_Turkish_Industrial_Development_Bank: "The Turkish Industrial Development Bank"
 OTT_Turkish_Industrial_Development_Bank_desc: "Aimed at promoting private initiative and providing loans to industrial entrepreneurs, the Turkish Industrial Development Bank is a government initiative that has been set up after long and difficult negotiations with the ruling coalition. Whilst its primary function for now is to mediate between European exporters and Ottoman importers, it plans to later on establish industries of its own."
 OTT_Anatolian_Road_Program: "Anatolian Roads Programme"
 OTT_Anatolian_Road_Program_desc: "As the primary focus of the Ottoman economy for most of its history has been on Rumelia, Asia Minor and Syria, the interior of Anatolia is severely lacking the infrastructure expected of a modern nation. Farmers are more often than not disconnected from their villages or cities, causing massive issues for our supply chains and inhibiting the potential of integrating these people in the world economy."
 OTT_Privatise_Land_Ownership: "Privatise Land Ownership"
 OTT_Privatise_Land_Ownership_desc: "The idea of private land ownership is not a new one, but remains as of today a contentious topic in the Ottoman Empire as the promising Land Reform Act, part of the Tanzimat reforms, caused massive social upheaval in the Mashriq, leading to the enforced serfdom of large parts of the Iraqi population and opposition of the conservative bloc who saw in this nothing but a shoddy attempt at European imitation."
 OTT_Populist_Economics: "Populist Economics"
 OTT_Populist_Economics_desc: "To their regret, the cabinet has been forced to recognise that the Ottoman people after all weren't ready yet for the full brunt of the capitalist system, and that the long awaited surge in private initiative has proven to be a dud. To remedy this and to cater to the growing unhappiness with the government, they have decided to intervene more heavily in the economy pursuing a populist direction."
 OTT_Turkish_Cement_Factory: "Expand the Turkish Cement Factories"
 OTT_Turkish_Cement_Factory_desc: "A key requirement for the rapid expansion of both industry and real estate, cement factories were the first successful focus of the Ottoman industrialisation plans in the 1920s. Despite this success however, the demand for cement and other building materials keeps climbing and to cater to these needs, the construction of several new factories in Asia Minor has been ordered."
 OTT_Sugar_Industry: "Expand the Sugar Industry"
 OTT_Sugar_Industry_desc: "Although sugar beets can be found all across Turkey, it is the regions around Ankara, Konya, Eskisehir, Afyon, Tokat and Yozgat that really power production. As part of the government's initiative to increase the production of processed food products, large sugar factories have been set up to process the sugar beets and deliver the finished products to the world market."
 OTT_Textile_Industry: "Expand the Textile Industry"
 OTT_Textile_Industry_desc: "An important export product of the Ottoman Empire for centuries, the textile industry encountered a large scale decline in the 19th century, as competition with the industrial weaveries of Manchester collapsed the demand for artisanal textiles. The tradition nonetheless still stands and with the collapse of the Western industries to syndicalism, the rise of the Syrian weaveries has taken the world by storm."
 OTT_Mechanised_Agriculture: "Mechanised Agriculture"
 OTT_Mechanised_Agriculture_desc: "Whilst the ox and the camel have long been trusted partners of the Ottoman farmer, it has become apparent that they can no longer compete with the smoke-billowing beasts of the industrial era. Therefore, in cooperation with loosened restrictions on agricultural imports, the liberal government has fully pulled the card of the small landowners and set up structures to assist them in acquiring material."
 OTT_Election_Factories: "The 'Election Factories'"
 OTT_Election_Factories_desc: "Ridiculed by the opposition as "Election Factories", the new liberal government has realised that solely reliance on the free market will not industrialise the Ottoman Empire and has now attempted to outdo the OHF national economy plans by fully committing itself to the rapid expansion of the industry, without any desire to keep a balanced budget. Will this save or destroy the Ottoman state...?"

 ott_institutionalised_islam_desc: "Religion has always played an important role in the Ottoman Empire, to no small degree because our Padishah is the Caliph of all Islam. Nonetheless, it would take until Abdulhamid II for an organised state religion to be truly spoken of, one wherein Kostantiniyye arranged everything from protection of the Holy Sites to education of the Ulema. Striving for a policy of Pan-Islamism, the faith was seen as the metaphorical glue holding the empire together under the Sultan-Caliph himself.\n\nThis control however has come at a cost as by bringing Islam closer to the chest, it as well now influences state policy at a higher level with various large Sufi orders possessing incredible political capital and opposing many of the attempted secularist reforms."

 ott_varlik_vargisi: "Varlık Vergisi"
 ott_varlik_vargisi_desc: "What can be seen as a successor to the Jizya tax on non-Muslim subjects in the Ottoman Empire, the application of this 'war' tax is leading to significant political issues as its very discriminatory application is in open conflict with the constitution.

 ott_pluralist_constitution: "Pluralist Constitution"

 TUR_country_intro_header: "The Ottoman Empire before the Weltkrieg"
 TUR_country_intro_content: "The Ottoman Empire, once one of the greatest empires in history, saw its decline commence in the late 18th century, developing to the point of being known as the 'sick man of Europe' by the early 20th century. An inability to effectively industrialise, constant foreign meddling in its affairs and a troubling hold on a lot of its provinces meant that the Ottoman Sultanate had fallen back well behind the European powers by 1876. Nonetheless, the Ottomans reformed, and despite the challenges they posed on a local level - where tribal issues and a corrupt bureaucracy reigned supreme - light could be seen. Prompted by Mahmud II in the early 19th century and further pursued by the Young Ottomans, radical changes were introduced in the Empire. Land ownership was restructured, the Janissaries eradicated, central rule re-established in regions such as Mosul and Al-Hasa, and a constitution promulgated. The focus of these reformers was based on the idea of Ottomanism, and attempted to foster a common identity for all its inhabitants besides their local one. It would not be enough. With Abdulhamid II‘s rise to power, a change would come once more.\n\nUnder the pretext of the Russo-Turkish war, the constitution was abolished and parliament sent packing. This period saw a radical centralisation of power under the figure of the Sultan-Caliph. With a constant threat by Christian powers, the Sultan turned towards Pan-Islamism based on the prestige of the Caliphate. Despite enjoying great success from the Muslim population, this would only hasten the departure of the territories without these. Furthermore, his absolute rule fostered great discontent amongst a population which increasingly became familiar with Western ideas.\n\nThis resistance would consolidate itself in the shape of “Committee of Union and Progress”. A coup d'état in 1908 made Ottoman politics, long suppressed by the Sultan, burst into the open. Dozens of parties would attempt to find a seat within the newly restored parliament as it seemed that Ottoman decline was finally at its end. The united democratic forces would not last - and quickly saw a split between the decentralists and the centralists. Through a tumultuous 5 years, these two sides would battle for control. In 1913, with the Raid on the Sublime Porte, the game was up. The centralists, with as significant public figures the Three Pashas, would eradicate all remaining power of the decentralists and shape the nation in their image. Under great threat by the imperialists they ultimately strengthened ties with Germany."

 TUR_country_intro_header_1: "The Ottoman Empire during the Weltkrieg (Part 1/2)"
 TUR_country_intro_content_1: "The Ottoman Empire officially entered the Weltkrieg on October 29, 1914, with the arrival of Wilhelm Souchon with the Goeben and Breslau and the shelling of Odessa. The Ottomans won several significant victories in the early years of the war, such as the Battle of Gallipoli and the Siege of Kut; but there were setbacks as well, such as the disastrous Caucasus Campaign against the Russians.\n\nDisaster continued in 1916 with the start of the Arab Revolt, combined with a new British Offensive under the command of General Edmund Allenby. Coming to a head in 1918, devastating defeats in Palestine led to a mass retreat of Ottoman forces. Jerusalem, Damascus and Aleppo fell in quick succession as only the controversial decision by the commander of the Sixth Army to withdraw into the mountains of Anatolia was able to stop the chain reaction. A valiant defeat at Antep and a Pyrrhic victory near Maraş ultimately stopped Allenby in his tracks.\n\nAt that point, the atmosphere of the Empire was rapidly changing, as the Ottoman government realised that even a victory would come at a cost. Furthermore, a change had happened in the palace as well. The CUP puppet Mehmet V had passed away, and in his wake followed the far more assertive Vahdettin. Seeing the collapse of his empire on all fronts, and with the CUP government held responsible for the disaster, he would lash out and attempt to shift power to his allies in the HIF. With the ground heating up under their feet, Talaat Pasha would then, at the instigation of Djemal Pasha, attempt to shut down the Sultan. Harsh famine in [TUR.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] due to a refusal by German forces to supply it with Ukrainian grain, betrayal in the Caucasus by its allies, the attempted silencing of the Sultan and rumours that the commander of the Sixth Army was in open conflict with the ministry of war, would finally tip the bucket over. In a massive wave of anti-German and pacifist fervour, the cabinet of Talaat Pasha was forced to resign and concede to the Sultan.\n\nAhmet Tefvik Pasha was appointed Grand Vizier and tasked with the creation of a government of national unity. Under pressure from the CUP, whose unwillingness to lift their grasp on power made the negotiations collapse, Ahmet Tefvik Pasha resigned and was replaced by Ahmed Izzet Pasha. Creating a government consisting of Cavit Bey, Fethi Pasha and Rauf Pasha, it became quickly clear that the CUP was far from defeated."

 TUR_country_intro_header_2: "The Ottoman Empire during the Weltkrieg (Part 2/2)"
 TUR_country_intro_content_2: "The Fall of Greece and the growing risk of revolution in the British Protectorate of Egypt caused Allenby to revise his strategy, and withdraw part of his forces. As France collapsed in late 1919, the War entered its closing stages. In contrast with the Western Front, however, where Austrian forces pushed into Italy and German into France and Belgium, the Ottomans at this vital moment had lost over half their Empire - either occupied, or readily vulnerable to a concerted British attack - and were held up by a British force unlikely to stand down. Sultan Vahdettin opened negotiations with the British in an attempt to salvage what remained of his empire, whilst Britain reconsidered its attitude in the Middle East.\n\nWith the Treaty of Copenhagen ceasefire later that year, demanding immediate withdrawal of all remaining Entente forces from the territory of the Central Powers, a rapid solution for the Eastern Question was necessary. Further trouble for the British in Egypt, Afghanistan and occupied Iraq ultimately forced their hand, and the order was given to withdraw. Only Palestine and the Vilayet of Basra would remain under occupation, at the insistence of Jan Smuts and Leo Amery, until an acceptable treaty was reached surrounding the 'rights of its minorities', masking their intentions of an Indian base in Iraq and a fortified position near the Suez. With uncertainty in the political climate of the Ottoman Empire, and punishment for the perpetrators of the Armenian massacres far from likely, international opinion shifted away from the Empire, losing much of its support from the Central Powers. An accord was reached in the summer of 1920, wherein two autonomous regions were established, to great anger of both Turks and Arabs.\n\nThe Mutasarrifate of Jerusalem (M.O.J.) was created in Palestine, stretching from the Allenby line to the Red Sea. This de jure part of the Ottoman Empire was to be governed by an International Council consisting of the German Empire, British Empire, Austro-Hungarian Empire, USA and the Ottomans themselves. Forbidding the entry of Ottoman troops, an international gendarmerie force would maintain the peace within Palestine. In the Vilayet of Basra a new home was to be created for the Assyrian people whose exodus from the plains of Nineveh and Lake Urmia had left them refugees in an Iran openly hostile to their ambitions."

 TUR_country_intro_header_3: "The Ottoman Empire after the Weltkrieg (1/2)"
 TUR_country_intro_content_3: "As formal peace finally arrived in 1919, the borders of the Ottoman Empire had largely remained the same. The oblasts of Kars and Ardahan were recovered with the addition of Yerevan whilst in the Aegean the Italians were pushed out of the Dodecanese. The damage had been immense however as through the actions of the CUP, especially Djemal Pasha, tensions between Turks and Arabs had burst into the open whilst in Eastern Anatolia and Mount Lebanon whole populations were eradicated either through forced deportation or starvation. Losses on the Turkish side had been colossal as well, leading to under-population and a sharp decline in agricultural output - the Empire's main source of income.\n\nAlthough the Arab revolt had been a colossal failure, the need for reform was recognised. Answering to the Arab Congress of 1913, the Arabic language was recognised as the second language of the Empire.\n\nIncreasing factionalism within the CUP and the meteoric rise of many military figures tore away at the internal stability of the party. The betrayal by its German allies in Palestine, gave rise to a substantial anti-German faction. As public opinion of the party declined even further, the CUP changed its name to Teceddüt and openly ousted some of the dictatorial figures within. Djemal Pasha went packing, whilst Talaats influence was greatly reduced.\n\nWorking from his position as minister of war, Mustafa Kemal Pasha ousted the German military mission and commenced an ambitious military restructuring. Receiving great acclaim for his actions, Kemal continued laying the foundations for his rise in power. Fearing another Enver Pasha, the upper committee of the party pushed Cavit Bey forward as its leader. Incapable of successfully challenging, him Kemal made a lucky bid for power in 1925. The party changed its name a second time to the “Ottoman Peoples Party”.\n\n"

 TUR_country_intro_header_4: "The Ottoman Empire after the Weltkrieg (2/2)"
 TUR_country_intro_content_4: "The 1926 elections ended in a victory for the OHF, but many were quick to remark that this was less due to the party itself, and more due to fragmentation of the opposition - where more than a dozen parties fought for any given seat. The newly appointed Grand Vizier did not hide his ambitions, and in a flurry of reforms he pushed the nation towards his ideals. Massive strides were undertaken in the areas of education, economic recovery, and the fight against the religious establishment. The authoritarian style of the Grand Vizier, however, lead to a further splintering of the party - when his former ally and friend Kazim Karabekir Pasha broke with the party and created his “Democratic Party”.\n\nUnder threat by the rapid centralisation of the government apparatus and with many conservatives afraid that the OHF may be attempting to break with tradition, the 1931 elections ended in the first electoral defeat for the OHF. The Ottoman Party for Administrative Decentralisation under its leader Haqqi al-Azm became the grand winner of the elections, and formed a coalition with the HIF and the DF to provide a united front against the growing centralist threat. The coalition, however, was under constant attack, as the various parties that played part in it had conflicting opinions on a non-OHF policy. Tensions reached a breaking point in late 1932, when the government of Haqqi al-Azm collapsed due to disagreement with the HIF and DF. A new government was created under HIF leadership, but as a minority government failed in achieving its goals of decentralisation and liberalisation.\n\nThe continued failures by this coalition went a long way in repairing the reputation of the OHF, which received a solid majority in the 1935 elections. As Grand Vizier Mustafa Kemal Pasha begins his second term in office, signs have started to appear that he may be looking for an alternative to the constant obstruction by the Ottoman Chamber of Deputies and interference from the conservative lobby through the Caliph..."

As the armies of Sultan, Shah and Shaykh plough through the fertile Mashriqi bosom protected by our Grand Padishah, the initial shock is making room for anger. Anger moves on to a desire for revenge as the previously beaten armies of the Caliph rally back to their standards.\n\nThe battle-drums are beaten, the Imams urge the soldiers to fight for Sultan and Allah, the artillery batteries reloaded and the Turkish army, once an unstoppable tide set to wipe out Europe, smashes into the decadent hordes of our enemies."

# Education reform
 ottpol.1.t: "Education Debate in the Meclis-i Mebusân"
 ottpol.1.d: "The fight over the minds and spirits of the population has been vigorously fought over the last few decades as the unrelenting pace of modernisation has also greatly affected this field. Started deep into the 19th century, the reforms have steadily progressed over the years, mostly carried by the secularist movement. The OHF has continued this conflict post-Weltkrieg with first the participation of women in higher education and official full coeducation only a few years later, promoted by Sultan Vahdettin. Nonetheless, the policy is finding it hard to be fully implemented on the ground as heavy opposition from the conservative Ulemma and the continued split in the various education systems makes any centralisation hard to accomplish.\n\nThe Ottoman education system, consisting of 3 main branches, remains divided and even though the idadî and sultanî (reformist schools established by the Tanzimat reforms) have been united into one distinct curriculum, the medreses (religious education) and minority schools (protected by the Millet system) remain a thorn in the side of the Ministry of National Education. Long a staple of the OHF, it has detailed its plans to unite all three systems, place them directly under the Ministry and to streamline the curricula to both promote social cohesion and make it more approachable to the common citizen. Over the last few years, primarily during their first tenure in 1927, massive strides were made towards accomplishing this goal but the subsequent decentralist government of 1931 has overturned this policy once more in favour of education on a Vilayet level, as such causing a divide in both the quality and accessibility of education depending on efforts of the Wali.\n\nNow that the OHF is firmly back in the saddle, it has brought to the table the sum of its designs: The Coeducation and Unification Act. Finally putting to law the full unification of education in the entire realm and the forced coeducation of male and female, the party has found itself up against a wall of conservative forces funded by the powerful Sufi lodges in an attempt to prevent their power over the government to fade."
 ottpol.1.a: "Change is in the air"

 ottpol.2.t: "Medreses Fight Back against the OHF"
 ottpol.2.d: "A petition signed by 300 Ulemma from across the Empire has reached the desk of the Grand Vizier earlier this week as the nearing vote on The Coeducation and Unification Act is stirring up commotion throughout the nation. Nonetheless, there is no united opposition to the act as even within the Ulemma themselves, many are seeing the benefit of centralised education with some even openly expressing their support for the Act."
 ottpol.2.a: "The vote approaches"

 ottpol.3.t: "Vote on the Education Decree"
 ottpol.3.d: "Including the controversial Coeducation and Unification Act, the Meclis-i Mebusân (Chamber of Representatives) was presented today with a wide variety of decrees and plans by the modernist OHF. As the OHF has a majority in the House after their 1935 electoral success, many are worried that the Sultan may yet interfere through the Meclis-i Âyân (Senate) whose members are almost entirely appointed by the Padishah himself. Known for being a devout Muslim and sharing many of the conservative tendencies of the opposition, the Sultan has kept himself absent from the political process ever since his ascension 10 years ago either because of a general apathy or as some whisper out of fear that what happened to Abdulhamid II may yet happen to him as well. With the future of Religious Education through the medreses now on the line however, many expect the Caliph of Islam to finally take a stance against the secularists."
 ottpol.3.a: "The law is passed"
 ottpol.3.b: "The Meclis-i Âyân shuts it down"

 ottpol.4.t: "The Grand Vizier Speaks to the International Press"
 ottpol.4.d: "Speaking to editors of both Kostantiniyye and international papers, the Grand Vizier has given a statement on the success of the vote and the expansion of the Ministry. "The decision taken by the Ottoman Parliament today is what the nation had wanted, naturally and genuinely. There is no need to look at it as something extraordinary." Showing off the stack of letters he had received from intellectuals all over the empire, the Pasha has once again shown to the international press that the people stand behind him. Whether or not this is actually the case is left vague and opposition papers are already describing vividly how this is an affront to the proud traditions of our state."
 ottpol.4.a: "A grand success for the Ottoman Nation!"

 ottpol.5.t: "Coeducation and Unification Act Fails"
 ottpol.5.d: "Although not entirely unexpected, the Grand Vizier is outraged by this act which he suspects is contributed to the Sultan's interference. As the Sultan - strictly speaking - remained within his jurisdiction, only encouraging the senators to vote against, many see in this the start of increasing interference by the House of Osman with the daily affairs of the Ottoman Parliament.\n\nGrand Vizier Mustafa Kemal Pasha has been seen earlier today making his way to Dolmabahçe Palace to present his opinion to the Sultan and to ensure that no further meddling will occur in the future. Although not directly threatening the Padishah, the Grand Vizier does not hide his preference for the younger Osman Fuad should the need arise."
 ottpol.5.a: "Just a minor setback... right?"

#Judiciary reform
 ottpol.6.t: "Committee for Judicial Reform"
 ottpol.6.d: "The civil code we have used since the Tanzimat era or the Mecelle code was first codified in 1877. Based on the Islamic Hanafi legal tradition, the code was the first enforcement of a unified law over all Ottoman citizens who previously according to the Millet system used their own codes.\n\nFor decades this code has remained mostly unchanged and is in the eyes of many still an ancient relic of a bygone era. As it is based on Islamic law, many of the reformists have protested against it as they feel that religious law has no place in a modern secular state. Christian and Jewish citizens who previously used their own legal system remain discontent with it as well, and have urged the government to reform if not outright replace the dated code.\n\nMustafa Kemal, who is likewise averse to its non-secular character, has thus opened a debate into the exploration of legal reform and formed a committee tasked with investigating possible judicial reform. Consisting of Ulemma, administrative personnel and Ottoman representatives from all millets, the committee will hopefully find a solution agreeable by all parties involved and shall present their findings as soon as possible."
 ottpol.6.a: "Another step for the reformists!"

 ottpol.7.t: "Basis of the Reformed Code"
 ottpol.7.d: "As the Sublime Committee for Judicial Reform is making progress in sifting through the 1851 articles of the Mecelle code, the majority of the reformists in the Committee have suggested looking towards the West for inspiration. Multiple different codes are being discussed as a baseline although an overall tendency towards the Swiss Civil Code, both for its modernity and relatively easy application to the Empire, seems to be prevailing. Others have pointed to the Austrian Empire whose legacy as a multi-ethnic, multi-religious empire is eerily similar to our own. A small core of hardline Ulemma however, have urged their committee members to not abandon the proud traditions of the Sharia code, and have suggested a reform of the Mecelle instead of a complete rewrite."
 ottpol.7.a: "We shall base it on the Swiss Civil Code!"
 ottpol.7.b: "Base it on the Austrian Civil Code!"
 ottpol.7.c: "We cannot abandon our Islamic character, the Mecelle just needs a few touch-ups"

 ottpol.8.t: "Women's Rights"
 ottpol.8.d: "Under the Mecelle code the status of women and men in our Empire remains a vastly different affair. Both the women's share in the inheritance and the weight of women's testimony in the courts is half of that of the men. Subsequently women are also barred from exercising all professions which has given rise to a sizeable emancipation movement clamouring for change as women during the Weltkrieg were forced to take up a wide variety of professions and bonded together in small movements to out their non-violent protests against the government. Education as well, promoted by the late Vahdettin, has allowed women to involve themselves deeper into both politics and kindled in many a desire to perform a variety of strictly male professions.\n\nPolygamy and the vagueness of marital law are also up for reform, as they are not only seen as relics from the past, but an obstruction to future reforms. Legal Marriage as well, now a voluntary action, should be made compulsory according to the Committee for all Ottoman citizens no matter their religion or ethnicity."
 ottpol.8.a: "Approved!"
 ottpol.8.b: "The place of the woman is subservient to that of the man"

 ottpol.9.d: "The slow rate of progress, the stubborn adherence to what they describe as backwards traditions and the incessant obstruction of large scale reforms in the Meclis-i Âyân (Senate) by the Sultan is pushing parliament to a breaking point. Members of the OHF are on the throats of the opposition and are calling onto the Grand Vizier to request early elections from the Sultan to settle the disputes once and for all.\n\nMeanwhile on the streets of Kostantiniyye representatives have been forced to travel with an armed guard as supporters of both sides are reacting violently to the rising tensions. The conservative representative of Konya was attacked in the streets earlier this week as a group of 6 men armed with daggers attempted to force themselves a way through the crowds. The representative was able to escape unscathed but gendarmerie in the city remain on high alert for any further political actions."
 ottpol.9.a: "Kemal requests the dismissal of Parliament"
 ottpol.9.b: "The situation will surely de-escalate on its own"

 ottpol.10.t: "Assassination of Rıza Tevfik Bey"
 ottpol.10.d: "A known member of the HIF and senator in the Meclis-i Âyân (Senate), Rıza Tevfik Bey was murdered today in broad daylight on the streets of [TUR.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. Attacked by a group of 10 young men, the senator was downed with a gunshot and died instantly.\n\nThe event marks another turning point in the parliamentary crisis as Tefvik was a well known critic of Kemalist policy. Two of the men caught in the attack seem to be affiliated with the OHF party although the latter denies all accountability and has declared that they are being framed by the HIF for an act done by terrorists. Meanwhile the Palace has still not reacted to the crisis, afraid to only further fuel the flames of unrest and to provoke an armed putsch aimed at disabling parliament."
 ottpol.10.a: "May the Great Allah help us"

 ottpol.11.t: "Sultan [OTT.GetLeader] Reacts to the Rising Tensions"
 ottpol.11.d: "Although refraining from interfering with the administrative affairs of his Empire as much as possible, Sultan [OTT.GetLeader] has today finally decided to intervene in the debate. Fully aware that the entire nation is awaiting his decision, the Sultan has ordained a meeting with his Grand Vizier earlier today to discuss possible solutions to the situation. A short meeting proceeded and by the evening the mind of His Majesty the Sultan was made."
 ottpol.11.a: "Sultan [OTT.GetLeader] grants his support to the Grand Vizier"
 ottpol.11.b: "Mustafa Kemal is dismissed as Grand Vizier"

 ottpol.12.t: "The Education and Judicial Decrees Are Pushed through the Meclis-i Âyân"
 ottpol.12.d: "With the proclaimed faith of the Sultan in his Grand Vizier, the Meclis-i Âyân has reconvened to vote on the proposal. Minimal changes to the decree were made to smooth relations with the opposition, but the overall idea behind the proposal was preserved and easily passed the Chamber of Representatives once more. In the Senate, the royal support seems to have been the deciding factor as the second vote ended in a landslide in support of the proposal."
 ottpol.12.a: "The Wisdom of His Majesty is truly immeasurable"

 ottpol.13.t: "The New Grand Vizier"
 ottpol.13.d: "When [OTT.GetLeader] took the throne in 1927, he did so with the promise to rule as a European constitutional monarch. The restoration of the constitution and the first free elections since the pre-war era were seen as huge leaps of progress within the Empire and were celebrated as the beginning of a new era. Some have however argued that [OTT.GetLeader] was forced under increasing pressure from the nationalist and secularist military to take these steps and that the only reason for his liberalisation drive was to avoid being deposed like Abdulhamid II only two decades earlier. Now that a major parliamentary crisis is shaking the nation and our sultan has for the first time openly interfered in the politics of his parliament, the nation awaits his answer to the issue.\n\nThe OHF has strong ties with the military and has already been angered by the dismissal of their leader Mustafa Kemal Pasha due to direct interference by the Sultan. Looking for an answer to the crisis, they have pushed Mustafa Ismet Pasha forwards as the replacement of Kemal and are unlikely to answer kindly to any candidate not part of their party.\n\nMeanwhile the Liberal opposition is mostly afraid that a continued OHF legislature will push them further on the path of the infamous CUP, and that an end to multi-party democracy may be approaching if the Sultan doesn't take a solid stance against it."
 ottpol.13.a: "Appoint the HIF candidate"
 ottpol.13.b: "Call for early elections"

### Sultan attempts to quell the riots
 ottpol.14.t: "Raid on the Offices of the Serbestî"
 ottpol.14.d: "Founded in 1908 as an Ottoman newspaper opposed to the rising power of the CUP, the journal has had a shaky relation with the reformist movements. When in 1909 the paper published multiple articles from the pen of Hasan Fehmi Bey, the writer and editor-in-chief of the paper was murdered whilst crossing the Galata bridge. Unwilling to bow to the CUP however, the paper continued in opposition to the ruling party and has more recently after the fall of power of the CUP spoken out against the authoritarian tendencies of the OHF.\n\nYesterday evening when the editorial staff had left their headquarters a group of unknown assailants stormed the building shouting the name of the Ghazi Kemal and torched the building to the ground. Gendarmerie was unable to catch the perpetrators who fled the scene before the flames were doused and evidence reports seem to be contradictory. It seems that the Sultan's response was not clear enough and as calls for harsher and more direct punishment rise, our old but wise leader has ordered the Constantinople Corps to seize the OHF headquarters and put an end to the party."
 ottpol.14.a: "This ends here!"

 ottpol.15.t: "Constantinople Corps Disobeys Orders"
 ottpol.15.d: "Countering the Palace, it appears that the Corps has sided with the OHF and has proclaimed martial law throughout the city. Within an hour, army units took control of the Sublime Porte, major roads, bridges and telegraph stations across the city, cutting it off completely from the rest of the Empire. More recent reports now also seem to indicate that a sizeable contingent of troops seems to be moving towards Dolmabahçe, as an eerie radio silence takes hold over the city. As skirmishes have broken out throughout the city by garrisons loyal to the Sultan, it is becoming clear that they will not be capable of resisting much longer without reinforcements from outside the capital."
 ottpol.15.a: "What is happening?"

 ottpol.16.t: "Raid on Dolmabahçe Palace"
 ottpol.16.d: "Afraid that his fate would be the same as that of Abdulhamid II, and seeing the troops gathered in front of the palace, [OTT.GetLeader] has ordered his guards to stand down and has agreed to a parley with the instigators of the mutiny.\n\nA small group of representatives of the movement under the leadership of the Ottoman Chief of Staff Fevzi Pasha subsequently passed through the gates to open talks with the Sultan as troops loyal to the plotters consolidate the military presence in the city. Fully aware that his opponents wield the upper hand in the streets and military, the old Sultan reluctantly admitted his defeat and has signed an Irade dismissing the Grand Vizier and calling new elections."
 ottpol.16.a: "It seems as if a return to 1913 is inevitable"

### Early Elections
 ottpol.17.t: "Military Supervision of the Elections"
 ottpol.17.d: "Although early elections have been written out by Irade of the Sultan, military control over the political institutions has for now not been withdrawn, as generals of the army argue that only through order and military discipline fair elections can occur.\n\nA joint motion of protest from the OPAD, HIF and various smaller opposition parties has been submitted however, claiming that the military is biased in favour of the OHF, and that the whole ordeal smells like the "Election of Clubs" which completely disabled any opposition to the CUP just before the Weltkrieg."
 ottpol.17.a: "Call back the Army"
 ottpol.17.b: "The Army remains on their posts"

 ottpol.18.t: "Elections of [GetYear]"
 ottpol.18.d: "The resignation of our Grand Vizier and the parliamentary deadlock has led to early elections. Fears of widespread voter fraud and reports of fear tactics in the hinterlands of Anatolia are running rampant as the liberal elite of Kostantiniyye are fully aware that another victory for the OHF may usher in a return to the CUP autocracy."
 ottpol.18.a: "The OHF wins a landslide victory"
 ottpol.18.b: "Victory for the OHF!"
 ottpol.18.c: "The Liberal Entente regains the majority"

 ottpol.19.t: "Mustafa Kemal Is Reappointed Grand Vizier"
 ottpol.19.d: "With an overwhelming victory claiming 240 of the 275 seats in the Chamber of Deputies, the position of the OHF has become completely solidified. The Liberal Entente, whose position has now been reduced to only 20 of the remaining seats has submitted a protest against what they see as fraudulent elections and are demanding new, fair elections. With the Sultan silenced and military high command in the pocket of the OHF, it seems in vain however and many fear that the multi-party democratic system is now formally on its last legs.\n\nThe speech by the Grand Vizier, detailing his plans for the nation and his account of the facts as they happened, was met by several minutes of applause that could be heard from across the Bosporus whilst the opposition looked on in defeat."
 ottpol.19.a: "We enter a new era today!"

 ottpol.20.t: "Liberal Entente Regains Majority"
 ottpol.20.d: "Trounced in 1935 by the OHF, the coalition of decentralist and 'liberal' parties has been reshaped under the guidance of the HIF. Although the security of their coalition is far from secure, many are breathing in relief that a return to the CUP autocracy has been averted. Lacking a central policy and with even the leadership looking shaky at best, time will tell however if the coalition will continue to hold their ground."
 ottpol.20.a: "Good luck"

### Penal Code
 ottpol.21.t: "Status of the Alīye-i Emniyet Hizmeti"
 ottpol.21.d: "The intelligence apparatus of the state has been in disarray ever since the fall of the CUP and the rogue adventures of Enver Pasha. Taking with him a sizeable portion of the Teşkilât-ı Mahsusa (Special Organisation) whose aim was to instigate Muslim revolts against the Imperialist powers and to crack down on dissent in the Middle East, the remainder of the force was reorganised by Irade into the Alīye-i Emniyet Hizmeti (Exalted Security Service) just after the conclusion of the Weltkrieg.\n\nA lack of experienced manpower and questionable allegiances of many of its members however greatly hindered its performance and the effectiveness of the force has been abysmal for over a decade now. To modernise the corps and make it an effective tool to keep our Arab provinces in check, the Grand Vizier has ordained its complete dismantlement and replacement by a new entity, the Milli Emniyet Hizmeti (National Security Service).\n\nSeveral close friends and associates of the Grand Vizier have however urged him to not take such drastic steps as rumours of a secret organisation aligned to the former CUP within the force have thus far not been quelled and some fear that should they feel the temperature under their feet rising, they may lash out and tear down all that we have built."
 ottpol.21.a: "Wipe it all clean!"
 ottpol.21.b: "Modernise the existing Alīye-i Emniyet Hizmeti"

### Failed Assassination Attempt
 ottpol.22.t: "Conspiracy against the Grand Vizier"
 ottpol.22.d: "The rebranded Alīye-i Emniyet Hizmeti is already proving its value as the complete reform of the institution has seen many of its more unsavoury members removed from their function. Angered by their dismissal, rumours have started to surface of an organisation called the "Karakol Society" with amongst its notable members men like Kara Kemal. Even though for now it seems unlikely that their clique is anything apart from a group of people with a shared grudge against the Grand Vizier and his government, they could potentially prove to be an issue further down the line.\n\nAn interesting proposal has also come from the Head of the new Milli Emniyet Hizmeti to use their organisation to the benefit of the Party. By keeping constant pressure on its members and their associates, he hopes to have them lash out prematurely and as such be easy prey for his agents. Furthermore, an idea was also circulated to use the organisation to fabricate a domestic crisis and as such grant an opportunity to the Grand Vizier to consolidate his authority over the administration."
 ottpol.22.a: "Flush the rats out"
 ottpol.22.b: "Keep tabs on them but refrain from intervening"

 ottpol.23.t: "Assassination Attempt Thwarted"
 ottpol.23.d: "Whispers of a possible plot on the Grand Vizier had started surfacing not so long ago but a breakthrough occurred in the case late last night when one of the conspirators, a refugee from the Greek island of Crete, got cold feet the day before the Grand Vizier was to arrive in Izmir. Informing the police of a possible attack on the Grand Vizier, the Wali of Izmir and close friend of Mustafa Kemal, General Kâzim Pasha, quickly shot into action and arrested 5 of the conspirators in their hotel room. Handguns, grenades and even a scimitar were found in the room and all 5 were promptly detained.\n\nShocked by the attempt on his life and by extension, so he says, the Ottoman state, Mustafa Kemal has already ordered the arrest of dozens of possible co-conspirators both high and low in the bureaucracy and including multiple generals (conveniently not those that support him). Without the executive powers to keep them detained however, and with no way to target parliamentarians protected by the constitution from persecution, a special think-tank within the OHF has been tasked with quickly figuring out a way to try all those who are 'associated' with the plot, and grant the powers to the office of Grand Vizier necessary to mop up the remaining conspirators."
 ottpol.23.a: "Round up the conspirators"

 ottpol.24.t: "Maintenance of Public Order Law"
 ottpol.24.d: "As a solution to the immunity of sitting representatives and to grant the executive powers necessary to thoroughly remove all possible opposition to the Grand Vizier, the 'Maintenance of Public Order' law was passed in parliament earlier today. Granting the Grand Vizier nigh-unlimited power and completely sidelining parliament for as long the nation remains in crisis (decided by the Grand Vizier), an opportunity has presented itself to the OHF to effectively eradicate all remaining opposition to their designs.\n\nMany desperados, veterans and former members of the CUP have already disappeared off the grid in fear of getting dragged into complicity concerning the plot whilst others have already taken the cowards way out. Kılıç Ali Bey, one of these individuals has reportedly shot himself after gendarmerie broke down the door of his home whilst others such as Kara Kemal have left the capital in a hurry to escape arrest.\n\nMembers of the HIF aren't spared either as a wave of arrests targeting them for possible complicity, even though none of them seem to have any solid connection to the plot, is shaking up the capital. Newspapers not following the party line are shut down, military training exercises cancelled, officers temporarily put on leave and the residence of the Grand Vizier put under close guard 24/7 as paranoia or, as some see it, political opportunism takes ahold of the nation."
 ottpol.24.a: "None shall escape the Law"

 ottpol.25.t: "Tribunals of Progress Opened"
 ottpol.25.d: "Dubbed the 'Tribunals of Progress', through the special emergency measures a number of tribunals have been set up in Kostantiniyye, Izmir and Bursa to persecute all those possible involved in the recent plot on the Grand Viziers life. Chaired by Bald Ali, a former lieutenant colonel in the Ottoman army and former CUP member himself, the list of men associated with the conspiracy keeps growing by the day as the megalomania and paranoia of the Grand Vizier has reached such levels that a number of his close friends and associates such as Prince Osman Fuad, Ismet Pasha, Ali Fuad Pasha and even Chief of Staff Fevzi Pasha have tried calling the man to reason.\n\nTried with a combination of charges ranging from complicity in the assassination, treason to the state, abandonment of duty and more it seems likely that the trials will be solely used as a political play to silence the opposition than to punish those responsible for the plot against the Pasha."
 ottpol.25.a: "Most disturbing"

 ottpol.26.t: "Tribunal of Progress: Military Command"
 ottpol.26.d: "Although evidence of complicity is scarce for almost all of those brought before the judge, there remains a certain truth to the charges that many of them harbour sentiments to see the Pasha encounter an early demise either out of opposition to the OHF, abandonment during the closing stages of the Weltkrieg or because of close association with the former CUP. Only 7 men on the list however were able to be caught by the Gendarmerie as many others departed the country or have gone into hiding in the vast hinterlands of Eastern Anatolia. Unfortunately for the Tribunal, this also means that those who were picked up by the Gendarmerie carry the least guilt and although some links to a backroom meeting almost 5 years ago were found, the content of said meeting and whether or not this could be associated with the attempt seems muddy at best."
 ottpol.26.a: "Persecute only those with solid evidence"
 ottpol.26.b: "They are all guilty!"

 ottpol.27.t: "Tribunal of Progress: Opposition Leadership"
 ottpol.27.d: "Dubbed the 'Black Band' or Kara Çete (a wordplay on the secret organisation called the Karakol Society), Bald Ali has dragged onto the stage many of the powerful figures still remaining of the CUP and its successor parties, often with close ties to the Liberal Entente. Benefitting from the occasion, however, the Ali has proposed to also target a variety of key members in the HIF leadership whose connection to any sort of plot is hard to prove but who could possibly have accidentally cursed the name of the Pasha in the open. Within the OHF itself however it's becoming increasingly clear that overstepping the boundaries of justice to boost political goals may lead to a split as various more moderate representatives have started to form a clique around the close friend of Kemal, Ali Fuat Pasha."
 ottpol.27.a: "Persecute only those with solid evidence"
 ottpol.27.b: "They are all guilty!"

 ottpol.28.t: "Tribunal of Progress: Bureaucracy"
 ottpol.28.d: "Even though the CUP and later the OHF was able to infiltrate all ranks of the Ottoman bureaucracy, many of the higher posts remain inhabited by close associates of the Sultan, HIF appointed candidates or disloyal CUP members who distanced themselves from its successor party. Now that it seems clear that Kemal is steadily marching towards the establishment of a dictatorship with himself at the helm, an opportunity has presented itself to persecute these people and replace them with men loyal to the Pasha. Both a massive undertaking and one sure to risk the ire of both the Sultan and the Ottoman Parliament it may be wiser however to not act rashly here and wait until the party is entrenched in a stronger way."
 ottpol.28.a: "Persecute only those with solid evidence"
 ottpol.28.b: "They are all guilty!"

 ottpol.29.t: "Ban on Political Parties"
 ottpol.29.d: "Using his new executive powers, the Grand Vizier has earlier today announced a temporary ban on all political parties, bar his own, until the domestic crisis is solved. Pointing out that a wide variety of unscrupulous individuals were able to escape justice and the state needs strong cohesion in these difficult times, the Pasha has ordered the closure of both the HIF and all smaller regional parties until further notice.\n\nOpposition to this move has already spread throughout the entire nation as protests in Beirut and Izmir against the tyranny of the Grand Vizier have been called and the newspapers of the capital run far above capacity now that they still can present their opinions without persecution."
 ottpol.29.a: "What will the future bring?"

 ottpol.30.t: "Moderates Leave the OHF"
 ottpol.30.d: "As the Pasha remains unwilling to listen to reason and the megalomania of his plans continues to know no boundaries, the moderates of the party under Ali Fuat Pasha have decided to break off and form an independent party. Calling themselves the 'Democratic Party' to show their aversion to the authoritarian moves by their former leader, the clique is rapidly growing in size and has left the government paralysed, causing it to fall due to a lack of majority in the Ottoman Parliament.\n\nIntervening in the situation and relieved that an opportunity has presented itself to stop his Grand Vizier from bringing the whole nation down, [OTT.GetLeader] has dismissed both the Pasha and parliament until the new upcoming elections."
 ottpol.30.a: "Splitters!"

 ottpol.31.t: "[GetYear] Emergency Elections"
 ottpol.31.d: "Caused by the fall of the OHF government, the various peoples of the Empire have once more been called to the ballots to decide the future of the Eternal State. Torn apart by an internal divide, the OHF seems primed to suffer a massive defeat as many voters are likely to jump ship over to the new DF. Nonetheless, the HIF has also been polling well as many of the elite fear that the DF is just another wolf in sheep clothes."
 ottpol.31.a: "HIF Victory"

### Successful Assassination Attempt
 ottpol.32.t: "A Sunny Day in Izmir"
 ottpol.32.d: "Upon request by his friend, the Wali of Izmir, the Grand Vizier had scheduled a visit to the Greco-Turkish city earlier this week. Warning that a potential retaliation strike for his progressive reforms may be imminent, the Alīye-i Emniyet Hizmeti had asked Kemal not to go until the situation was fully under control. Confirmation of a rumoured attack was given three days later when a known criminal in Bursa was apprehended drunkenly blabbering about a vast conspiracy network he was part of against the Grand Vizier and who was given the order to terminate Kemal's life. Further investigation by the Alīye-i Emniyet Hizmeti ultimately cleared the situation up as the man's imagination and the visit was scheduled two weeks later.\n\nA few days before the convoy would reach the city, further troubling reports started to surface as Gendarmerie apprehended two young men associated with the old Special Organisation near the town square. Once again, these were waved away as pure coincidence by the Alīye-i Emniyet Hizmeti.\n\nAs the Grand Vizier entered the city yesterday afternoon and was greeted by the Wali. all still seemed fine. Earlier today however, during a grand speech the Vizier was supposed to hold before a massive crowd which had come out to meet the man himself, two quick gunshots rang through the crowds as the Grand Vizier fell to the ground. Gendarmerie immediately intervened and were able to catch the perpetrator, a young man of Armenian descent whose immediate motive seems to have been revenge for the Armenian Massacres.\n\nMustafa Kemal was immediately rushed to the hospital, but his situation remains far from stable as increasing health issues over the years have greatly impacted the life of our Grand Vizier."
 ottpol.32.a: "This is a Tragedy!"

 ottpol.33.t: "Bayar Pasha Assumes Emergency Control of the OHF"
 ottpol.33.d: "With their beloved leader Mustafa Kemal Pasha in a condition prohibiting him from further leadership, a power struggle is starting to unfold within the OHF as the unexpected strike and the stubborn will of Kemal not to appoint a successor has left the party divided and squabbling amongst themselves.\n\nHardline elements who have enjoyed the favour of Kemal more and more over the past few years have pushed Ismet Pasha forwards as his successor, whilst the more moderate wing has decided to throw support behind Ali Fuat Pasha. Rumours have also surfaced that Field Marshal Fevzi Pasha may be trying to take the title for himself, and his wide support amongst the military class, who still form the backbone of the party, has both sides scared.\n\nIn the meanwhile, close friend and support of Kemal, Bayar Pasha has assumed emergency powers whilst the nation holds its breath unsure of what may follow if the symbol of Ottoman patriotism perishes."
 ottpol.33.a: "All eyes are on Kemal"

 ottpol.34.t: "Death of Mustafa Kemal Pasha"
 ottpol.34.d: "As his condition remained unstable and on the edge between life and death for over a week, many were starting to lose hope that a quick recovery was imminent. Finally convinced that his end would come, he summoned a few of his closest friends and his adoptive daughter, Sabiha, and started writing his will. Upon putting his signature below the text, all medical bulletins were stopped and the final hours of the Vizier started to unfold. Flanked at his nightstand by his secretary, three Turkish doctors and the commander of the Guard, he addressed his final words to doctor Neset Ömer: Aleyküsselâm (Peace to you) — the Muslim reply to a greeting. At 9:05 AM, Ghazi and Grand Vizier Mustafa Kemal Pasha blew out his last breath. His friend Salih would later burst into his room and upon seeing the body of his patron, step outside and shoot himself in the chest.\n\nWithin the will were his wishes — to bequeath all his property to the party, with a monthly stipend for his sister, and a curious note about his ally Ismet Pasha to whom he left the sum necessary to fund the education of his children, knowing that the man had little riches. More infuriating though is that he stubbornly refused to name a successor, and when his secretary Hasan Riza Bey attempted to extract an oral testament, he was stopped by Celâl leading to great tumult amongst the leading cadre of the party.\n\nParliament in [TUR.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] was quick to respond with a day of mourning, and a joint statement thanking the man for his actions during the war was issued written out to "Halâskâr Gazi", the Saviour Gazi (Holy Warrior). No such celebrations were to be found in the OHF headquarters though as the final passing of their leader has led the power struggle to explode into the open."
 ottpol.34.a: "Let us weep for the defender of Gelibolu, the Lion of Antep and the Ghazi of Maraş!"

 ottpol.35.t: "The OHF Starts Falling Apart"
 ottpol.35.d: "Shocked by the sudden departure of their leader and his refusal to mark a worthy successor, factions have started to form within the party. Broadly speaking, split between the hardliners under Ismet Pasha, the democrats under Ali Fuat Pasha, and the military establishment under Fevzi Pasha, many party members have decided to side with one of the three, and are mostly watching from the sidelines as the battle is fought.\n\nAli Fuat Pasha, portraying a version of modernisation based on the multi-party system with democracy at every level, is by some of the hardliners seen as a traitor to the revolution they are supposed to be bringing to the nation, and especially his programmes of decentralisation and loosened state control are receiving much opposition from within the party. Former Brigadier-General Kazim Karabekir however, and others such as Rauf Pasha, see in his message as the future of the state, and the only way to avoid decay into a full dictatorship.\n\nIn the other camp, under the still insecure leadership of Ismet Pasha, plans are made to stick close to the programme uttered by the former Grand Vizier about a progressive vanguard leading the nation into a new era, and a strong guiding hand by the state until the Ottoman people are ready for self-government. Sources indicate that even though the position of Ismet within this camp is still shaky, many military-aligned party members have shown their preference to this approach."
 ottpol.35.a: "Ali Fuat Pasha assumes control over the party"
 ottpol.35.b: "Ismet Pasha takes over the torch from Mustafa Kemal"

 ottpol.36.t: "Democrats Leave the OHF"
 ottpol.36.d: "Not unexpectedly the appointment of Ismet Pasha as new party leader has led to great resentment from the liberal party members. The harsh course that seems to now be dominant within the party has former close associates of Mustafa Kemal such as Ali Fuat Pasha, Celâl Pasha and many others forced into abandoning the OHF they helped form and work together with former rival Kazim Karabekir.\n\nSecretary General of the party, Recep Bey has already openly condemned the new party who is currently going by the name of "Democratic Party" - a clear comment on the authoritarian style of the OHF - and is trying to turn public opinion against them. Aware that their window of opportunity is rapidly closing and the current dominance of the OHF over parliament is unlikely to last, he has also been pressuring Ismet into tightening the belt, shutting down this upstart party and centralise the state around the OHF before their majority in both parliament and the army starts to decay."
 ottpol.36.a: "Traitors!"

 ottpol.37.t: "A Nation in Crisis"
 ottpol.37.d: "The OHF is not the only organisation hit by the sudden departure of the Grand Vizier, as the lack of leadership is starting to cause great troubles across the land. The organisation responsible for the assassination is still at large and many are questioning how the Alīye-i Emniyet Hizmeti failed so catastrophically in defending the Grand Vizier.\n\nRumours of a conspiracy reaching the upper echelons of the Eternal State are spreading quickly as former friends look at each other in suspicion. Recep Pasha, secretary general of the party, has therefore been pushing Ismet Pasha to enact the so-called "Maintenance of Public Order" decree which would give nigh-limitless executive power to the Grand Vizier. Seen by many in the party as a way to permanently shut down any attempts of opposition and the next step in combining party and state, this can be regarded as the path of no return and it is likely that the political scene will take decades to recover from the damage it would cause."
 ottpol.37.a: "A point of no return?"

 ottpol.38.t: "Divided Loyalties in the Army"
 ottpol.38.d: "Not only within the party, but also in the Military High Command, has the death of the Ghazi caused great disturbance, as even though they openly supported the OHF, its recent decision to drift away from a central authority has left many of the Weltkrieg veterans fearful of increased Arab input within the force and their questionable loyalties. Chief of Army, Fevzi Pasha, was a close friend to the former Grand Vizier and often cooperated with him both in the field and at the drawing desk leaving many to fear that the General may be stepping in to ensure that the policy and ideology of his colleague aren't compromised.\n\nOutside of this circle however, there also remains a divide between officers trained by the German military mission before the war, and those by the revamped Ottoman military standards post-war, with great difference in their opinion of the German Empire and the relation the Sublime Porte should have with it. Nonetheless, the risk of a military take-over seems minimal for the moment and differences between the two sides are, for now, settled behind closed doors."
 ottpol.38.a: "Most disturbing"

 ottpol.39.t: "Fevzi Pasha Announces His Ambitions"
 ottpol.39.d: "Not only the Chief of Staff of the Ottoman army but also a hero of the Weltkrieg, Fevzi Pasha has announced his ambitions to enter politics fully. The move by the Pasha, a long-time friend and former colleague of the late Mustafa Kemal, is by many seen as unexpected, as the man has not shown much inclination to join the political battlefield, preferring a real one, and is very much a testament of the fraternal relations held by the OHF and the Ottoman Army. Recent whispers amongst the upper echelons of the party have it however, that Kemal called him to his side just before his untimely departure and instructed him to lead both the party and the Ottoman nation as a whole further down the path they both envisioned.\n\nGoing in however against the loosely kept rule barring officers from holding both positions in the army and Ottoman parliament, it remains unclear whether his newly announced candidacy for party leadership will also include an early retirement from his former position. Known as a reasonable but also disciplinary man, some fear that he may be steering the nation down a more authoritarian path with closer relations between the army and the state."
 ottpol.39.a: "Fevzi fails the vote"
 ottpol.39.b: "Fevzi takes over party leadership"

 ottpol.40.t: "Ottoman Elections of [GetYear]"
 ottpol.40.d: "With the untimely death of our former Grand Vizier and the subsequent power struggle within the OHF, new elections have been written out by Sultan [OTT.GetLeader] to ensure a stable and democratically elected succession. Military interference in its affairs however indicates that without their link through Mustafa Kemal, the army may soon start playing a more direct role in politics and push the nation more on a course they prefer. Either way many fear that these elections are only the beginning and that the situation will remain unstable for the foreseeing future."
 ottpol.40.a: "Liberal Entente retakes the majority"

 ottpol.41.t: "Military Launches Coup"
 ottpol.41.d: "What many feared would come has been confirmed earlier today as Fevzi Pasha has officially declared the state of emergency postponing elections indefinitely and closing parliament until further notice. Having both the army and a large part of the OHF network on his side, it seems unlikely that this will only be for a short duration and many fear that a military dictatorship may be here to stay after the assassination of the Grand Vizier only a few weeks earlier. To counter possible resistance in the outer vilayets all Walis have been recalled to the capital to discuss further policy and likely be replaced by military men loyal to the new regime. Over in Kostantiniyye itself, Ismet Pasha has been appointed Grand Vizier to ensure a steady hand in day to day affairs but within the political circles it is clear to most that he has mostly been appointed to the position as a puppet for Fevzi's regime."

### Language Reform
 ottkem.1.t: "Turkish Language Committee"
 ottkem.1.d: "Even though a wide array of languages is used by the citizens of the Ottoman Empire, earlier attempts to centralise the administration and to increase oversight over local affairs have pushed Turkish more and more to the forefront, making it compulsory for all willing to work for the government, the military and an entry point for a variety of positions high on the social ladder. Nonetheless, the language has proven to be both hard to teach, and hard to be implemented effectively in a modern society, in which telegraph lines play an important role. Consequently it has become mostly a language for the elite, with little appeal outside of the Empire's core territories, as locals prefer sticking with their own languages and dialects. Arabs, the second largest group in the empire, have been especially opposed to its increasing enforcement in a variety of fields and are seeing in it forced Turkification and discrimination.\n\nWhere previous reformers, including even former minister of war Enver Pasha, have left off, our Grand Vizier is taking up the task to both reform the education system and the Turkish language itself in what he claims as the only way for the struggling empire to catch up with the West. As the current Turkish language is based on a Perso-Arabic script, the Pasha has with wide support from the westernising faction, decided that we should all swap to the Latin script which is easier to teach. Others however fear that this move would be received especially poorly in the Mashriq, and have proposed a middle way wherein the old script would be kept but severely streamlined, as to make it more approachable for the common man. Seeing in this an opportunity to boost Ottomanism further, they envision it as the metaphorical glue keeping the empire together, and a grand language college is already being planned to invite intellectuals from all sides of the Empire to design the language of the future."
 ottkem.1.a: "Swap to the Latin Script"
 ottkem.1.b: "Streamline the Perso-Arabic script"

 ottkem.2.t: "Implementation of the Turkish Language"
 ottkem.2.d: "As the Ottoman Empire joined the Weltkrieg and the CUP consolidated their hold on power even further, so did their plans for a Muslim Turkish which resulted in a series of laws and decrees further promoting a new Turkish bourgeoisie to replace the old Christian one. The explicit focus on promoting the Turkish language and its users however caused a divide between the Arabs and the Turks of the empire that previously did not exist in such shape or form. The Arab language, a proud and even sacred language for the Islamic world, had to concede further power to the Turkish one, to the great anger of the elites across the Mashriq and the Hejaz.\n\nRemaining the sole accepted language for a wide variety of tasks, offices and day to day necessities, other languages were lifted up in status during the tenure of the OPAD, in return greatly angering both the Turkish and centralist movements, who saw in it weakness and a grave delay to the westernisation and modernisation of the Ottoman state. With the OHF firmly back in control however, and the Turkish language being adapted to serve a broader public, the Grand Vizier has already announced his intention to re-implement the Turkish language as the sole governmental language accepted in the realm and to change school curricula accordingly."
 ottkem.2.a: "One state, one language"

 ottkem.3.t: "Student Protest at the Damascus School of Law"
 ottkem.3.d: "Part of the recently created Imperial University of Damascus, students of the School of Law in the Arab city have Damascus have come out on the streets today to protest against what they see as a policy of forced Turkification in response to the recent decision by the Ottoman government to reinstall Turkish as the sole official language of the empire. Encouraged by their professors, students in Damascus and Baghdad have also joined their brethren, as a rare unity in the Mashriq seem to be spreading amongst its people.\n\nNonetheless it cannot be denied that to the majority of the population, the decision has had very little to no effect as their apathy towards the central regime, and the strong reliance on local structures and social constructs make many of these nationwide reforms hard to sink in. Moreover the government's intentions to shut down all schools not teaching the Turkish language are troubled, due to ineffective infrastructure and the sheer size of the Ottoman realm."
 ottkem.3.a: "They will get in line eventually"

 ottkem.4.t: "Formation of the Türk Dil Kurumu"
 ottkem.4.d: "Created as an overarching organisation to protect the Turkish language, much like the Académie Française for the French language, the Türk Dil Kurumu (Turkish Language Association) has been opened in Kostantiniyye today by the Sultan. Serving and combining the efforts of the Turkish Language Committee into one distinct entity, leadership of this new institution was given to Hagop Martayan. From Armenian descent, Secretary-General Hagop served in the Ottoman army during the Weltkrieg where he met Pasha. Leaving the Empire in 1921, he went on to teach Turkish at the university of Sofia before being summoned by Kemal to the language conference held earlier this year in the capital.\n\nCurious to note as well is the negotiations held between the government and the Türk Ocakları (Turkish Hearts), a Turkish nationalist organisation, concerning the institution and possible cooperation between the two to examine the root of the Turkish language and the history of its people. Talks seem to have broken down however as Hamdullah Suphi, president of the organisation, could be seen leaving the Sublime Porte in anger refusing to speak to the press."
 ottkem.4.a: "Splendid"

 ottkem.5.t: "Higher Education in the Ottoman Empire"
 ottkem.5.d: "As literacy rates steadily rise across the empire and more and more students enrol in the universities of our grand nation, many have brought up the need for a new institution to supplement the Darülfünûn-u Sahâne (Imperial University) in Kostantiniyye. A variety of Law, Medical and Technical schools already exist throughout the Empire, most notably in Beirut, Damascus and Baghdad. Serving as a token of our modernist reforms, technological innovation and the future of the Ottoman people, debate rages over its location as many prominent cities have thrown their hat in the ring.\n\nAdana, the pearl of Southern Anatolia, has established itself as a key industrial region over the last few decades, further increased by its strategic location close to the Suriye vilayets.\n\nSmyrna, the cosmopolitan melting pot of Greek and Turkish culture is one of the most developed and largest cities in the Empire and has long been seen as both an intellectual and economical hub of the Porte.\n\nTucked away in Iraq, the city of Mosul has seen its importance skyrocket in recent years as the export of oil from the Mesopotamian Vilayets exponentially increases. Close Ottoman supervision over the region, further aided by the Turkoman population and connections through the Berlin-Baghdad railway, has made it a veritable hub of the new Ottoman movement as its choice would be seen by many as a further attempt by the Porte to bring the region under its wing."
 ottkem.5.a: "Adana"
 ottkem.5.b: "Smyrna"
 ottkem.5.c: "Mosul"

 ottkem.6.t: "Language Trouble in the Mashriq"
 ottkem.6.d: "In an attempt to preserve the value of the Arab language in public life and to ensure its continued importance in arts and culture, various small clubs have organised themselves across the Mashriq dedicated to promoting the Arab language. Holding discussions about Arab writing, opening and maintaining libraries, promoting social activities with elderly and children and even using the radio waves to preach their message of peaceful resistance, they are welcomed by both Muslims and Christians alike leading to an almost explosive growth across Syria and Iraq.\n\nAs the Ottoman government has no control over these organisations, many fear that they are used as separatist hotspots and that Arab nationalists are using them to spread their message to the Arab bourgeoisie. Walis are uncertain however whether or not intervention is justified as they aren't openly breaking any laws, and they expect the backlash to be tremendous if they are shut down without good reason."
 ottkem.6.a: "All Ottoman citizens can openly express themselves"
 ottkem.6.b: "Better safe than sorry..."

 ottkem.7.t: "Halkevleri Programme"
 ottkem.7.d: "The Halkevleri (Peoples' Houses) Programme has been officially announced today as an attempt to increase social cohesion between the various citizens of the Empire and promote consciousness amongst the lower strata. In practice however, the Houses or 'Community Centres' have the task of promoting the reforms undertaken by the OHF and stimulating popular support for a secularist and modern society.\n\nSeen by some as an answer to similar Arab organisations in the Mashriq, the institutions are quickly spreading through the nation with already close to 60 of them spread out across the Empire, primarily in Anatolia. Whilst Turkish reaction to the Houses seems to be fairly warm, even in conservative areas despite the message they are portraying, Arabs have shown far less interest with a branch opened in Medina receiving no visitors at all."
 ottkem.7.a: "How happy is the one who says "I'm an Ottoman"."

### Millet Reform
 ottkem.8.t: "The Millet System in [GetYear]"
 ottkem.8.d: "When the Millet system was founded according to the national legend in the 15th Century under Sultan Mehmed the Conqueror, the idea behind it was that as Muslim citizens were governed by Islamic Law, so should Christians and other religious minorities be governed according to the laws of their own faith. It is unclear whether or not the system was actually in use before the 19th Century when Sultan Mahmud II split his non-Muslim subjects up in three distinct Millets: Greek Orthodox, Armenian and Jewish.\n\nBowing under international pressure, the Empire was forced to cede more and more power to these bodies after the Tanzimat reforms of the late 19th Century as the various great powers saw it as their sworn duty to protect the various minority groups of the Empire. As the Millet system allowed for a plethora of special powers such as the collection of taxes and the creation of new laws for the community, the citizens of these groups became less Ottoman by the day, as the Europeans started influencing their day-to-day life more and more, effectively attempting to wrangle them away from our Empire.\n\nPressured by the outside world, we had no choice but to watch as the power of Kostantiniyye over the Millets was reduced to practically nil. Efforts by the Young Turks to fight back against the system and to abolish the dreaded Capitulations which allowed European subjects in the Empire to be governed according to European law were only partially successful, as none of the Powers were willing to give up its vast influence within our Empire.\n\nThe end of the Weltkrieg, however, brought a glimmer of hope for the reformists of the Empire, as with the blood of hundreds of thousands of Turkish sons, the dreaded Capitulations were finally abolished, as such ushering in a new era of reform for the Eternal State.\n\nThe Millet system has survived regardless, as indecisive politics in the Ottoman Parliament, and the need of both coalitions to attract the Christian and Jewish vote have thus far thwarted any attempt at reform."
 ottkem.8.a: "Interesting"

 ottkem.9.t: "Abolition of the Millet System"
 ottkem.9.d: "After the departure of the Capitulations in 1914 and the education reform abolishing the minority colleges earlier during this legislation, their power has already been severely reduced. With Russian, British and French destruction after the end of the Weltkrieg, an end has also come to their meddling in the affairs of the Millets who, without a powerful patron, have seen their power greatly reduced as the sole trading power in the Ottoman Empire.\n\nHowever, as the special taxes remained, and with a growing Muslim bourgeoisie, discrimination against the non-Muslim Millets has seen a steady growth over the last few years, to which the government now wishes to answer. Working together with the various authorities within these structures, an agreement was reached today to abolish the old system in return for complete equality for the law for all citizens of the Ottoman Empire under a secularist protective mantle."
 ottkem.9.a: "We are all Ottomans"

 ottkem.10.t: "French Ambassador Lodges Complaint"
 ottkem.10.d: "Seeing themselves as the defenders of the Maronite Christian population in Mt Lebanon and Catholics throughout the Empire, the French government in Algeria has protested against the abolition of the Millet system. Claiming that it is a direct attack on the interests of all Christians in the realm, many French industrialists and traders still in the Levant fear that this move is explicitly targeted at them and fear that their interests in Mt Lebanon may be compromised for good now unless the French government interferes."
 ottkem.10.a: "They are in no position to challenge us!"

### Abolition Mecelle
 ottkem.11.t: "Proclamation of the Ottoman Civil Code"
 ottkem.11.d: "Replacing the Sharia based Mecelle, which had been in use since the start of the Tanzimat era during the second half of the 19th century, the new Ottoman Civil Code has included substantial differences concerning both the status of women and the influence of religion within the Ottoman society, which has already caused significant discontent in more conservative areas of the Empire.\n\nFollowing the rising feminist movement and following the policies concerning coeducation during the twenties, the new Civil Code now officially recognises man and woman as equals, bans polygamy, makes legal marriage compulsory and implements a wide variety of acts concerning personal freedom."
 ottkem.11.a: "A grand day for the Empire!"

### Ottoman Constitution
 ottkem.12.t: "Sublime Committee for Constitution"
 ottkem.12.d.kemal: "Pressured by his government, Sultan [OTT.GetLeader] has officially announced the creation of the Sublime Committee for Constitution. A vast array of reform proposals have already been submitted to the office of the Grand Vizier who has not yet announced the head of the Committee. Unaware to the public, various internal elements of the party have started to reorganise themselves into two sides.\n\nAli Fuat Pasha, close friend and associate of Kemal, has shown disagreement with the harsh party line and mangled opposition. Supported in this by various other members of the Party, they argue against some of the more protectionist elements of Kemal's policy and have shown their discontent with the single party dictatorship he seems to be pursuing.\n\nThey are however opposed in this by the majority of the party who have grown disillusioned with the slow and hindered progress of reforms under the fully democratic system. Ismet Pasha, a rising star within their ranks, has been able to capture the ear of Kemal and has requested the task to be delegated to himself to make sure that the entirety of their joint vision is implemented."

 ottkem.12.a: "Ali Fuat Pasha"
 ottkem.12.b: "Ismet Pasha"

 ottkem.13.t: "Ottoman Constitution - The Ottoman State"
 ottkem.13.d: "The Sublime Committee for Constitution has been working tirelessly to write our new Constitution. The Parliament has started the process of approving the independent Articles and submitting them for ratification by His Majesty the Sultan.\n\nArticle 1. The Ottoman Empire comprises present territory and possessions, and semi-dependent provinces. It forms an indivisible whole, from which no portion can be detached under any pretext whatever.\n\nArticle 2. Kostantiniyye is the capital of the Ottoman Empire. This city possesses no privilege or immunity peculiar to itself over the other towns of the empire."
 ottkem.13.a: "Approved."

 ottkem.14.t: "Ottoman Constitution - The Sultan"
 ottkem.14.d: "Article 3. The Ottoman sovereignty, which holds the title of the Supreme Caliph of Islam, belongs to the eldest prince of the House of Osman, in accordance with the rules established ab antiquo.\n\nArticle 4. His Majesty the Sultan, in his role as Supreme Caliph, is protector of the Muslim religion. He is the sovereign and padisah of all Ottomans.\n\nArticle 5. His Majesty the Sultan is irresponsible, his person is sacred.\n\nArticle 6. The liberties, properties real and personal, and the civil list of the members of the Ottoman Dynasty are under the guarantee of all."
 ottkem.14.a: "By God, approved!"

 ottkem.15.t: "Ottoman Constitution - Sovereign Rights of the Sultan"
 ottkem.15.d: "Article 7. Among the sacred prerogatives of the Sultan are the following: The mention of his name in prayers; the minting of money; the granting of high public offices and titles, according to the law ad hoc; the conferring of orders; the selection and appointment of the Grand Vizier and the Seyhülislam; the confirmation in their offices of the members of the Cabinet formed and proposed by the Grand Vizier, and, if need arise, the dismissal and replacement of Ministers according to established practice;"
 ottkem.15.a: "Approved."

 ottkem.16.t: "Ottoman Constitution - Basic Human Rights"
 ottkem.16.d: "Article 10. All subjects of the empire are called Ottomans, without distinction whatever faith they profess.\n\nArticle 11. Every Ottoman enjoys personal liberty on condition of not interfering with the liberty of others.\n\nArticle 12. Personal liberty is wholly inviolable. No one can suffer punishment, under any pretext whatsoever, except in cases determined by law, and according to the forms prescribed by it.\n\nArticle 13. All Ottomans are equal in the eyes of the law. They have the same rights, and owe the same duties towards their country, without prejudice to religion.\n\nArticle 14. All Ottomans are admitted to public offices, according to their fitness, merit, and ability."
 ottkem.16.a: "Approved."

 ottkem.17.t: "Ottoman Constitution - Religion"
 ottkem.17.d: "As Caliph, the Sultan is the head of the Islamic faith and protector of Muslims both within and outside of his realm. His influence also stretches to the various religious organisations, orders and schools that are deeply entrenched in our nation which he both protects and funds with resources from the State Treasury. This however also means that religion is part of every layer of the Ottoman State, and is deeply engrained within the state apparatus.\n\nMustafa Kemal, greatly influenced by the laïcité introduced in the French revolution, is firmly opposed to keeping the status quo, and has dictated that the Ottoman State should it truly be willing to progress needs to stand at an equal distance of every religion, neither promoting nor condemning any set of religious beliefs. No longer should political campaigns be based on the piety of the candidate in question but instead on his merits and qualities."
 ottkem.17.a: "Islam is the state religion of the Ottoman Empire."
 ottkem.17.b: "State and Religion are separate entities."

 ottkem.18.t: "Ottoman Constitution - Houses of Parliament"
 ottkem.18.d: "In the Constitution of 1876, the Houses of Parliament were established comprising of a Parliament (Meclis-i Mebusan) and a Senate (Meclis-i Âyan). The Grand Vizier, handpicked by the Sultan, presided over the Houses of Parliament. This practice has thus far been continued up till this day, but has been challenged the last few years as deputies argue that the head of government should not be handpicked by the Sultan, but rather determined by Parliament. Even though this has in practice already been the case since 1926, it should now be solidified. Hardliners in the party however, have argued that not the people but the party should decide on the position since they are the embodiment of the will of the people and further steps would be redundant."
 ottkem.18.a: "The Sultan will appoint the Grand Vizier."
 ottkem.18.b: "The Government shall be formed by the Parliament."
 ottkem.18.c: "The People shall elect their Head of Government."

 ottkem.19.t: "Ottoman Constitution - Right to Petition"
 ottkem.19.d: "Article 63 of the Constitution states that 'One or more persons of Ottoman nationality have the right of presenting petitions in the proper quarter relating to the breaking of law and regulation, and may likewise present in protest signed petitions to the General Ottoman Assembly, complaining of the conduct of state servants and functionaries.'\n\nWhile this article by itself seems sufficiently just, several members of the Sublime Committee suggested that minorities should be explicitly allowed to present petitions in local languages, as not stating this would allow a loophole where local governments could arbitrarily decide not to process petitions written in languages other than Turkish."
 ottkem.19.a: "Allow petitions written in local languages."
 ottkem.19.b: "One State, One Language, One Indivisible Entity."

 ottkem.20.t: "Ottoman Constitution - Women Rights"
 ottkem.20.d: "Under the current constitution only men are allowed to vote and execute public office. Pressure from the Grand Vizier however, and various other members of the Party, has now announced their desire to revoke these limitations, opening up voting to both genders."
 ottkem.20.a: "Enact Universal Suffrage"
 ottkem.20.b: "Reject the proposal."

 ottkem.21.t: "Ottoman Constitution - Foreign Policy"
 ottkem.21.d: "As the Padishah of the Ottoman people, the Sultan should have the sole authority to wage war and offer peace, command armies on land and sea and the conclude Treaties in general. Or so argue the monarchists, who point to the 1876 constitution which first enshrined these privileges, but were removed after the CUP coup in 1909. Conservatives within the party have argued that it should not be the Sultan, but the Grand Vizier who should, as representative of the people, wield these powers. Their argument has however been countered by the Liberals, who point out that Parliament already represents the will of the people, and as such matters that concern foreign policy should be solely decided by this organ."
 ottkem.21.a: "The Grand Vizier dictates foreign policy."
 ottkem.21.b: "Parliament as representative of the people sets the course."

 ottkem.22.t: "Ottoman Constitution - Press"
 ottkem.22.d: "The Current constitution guarantees the freedom of the Press, which has led to open opposition to the regime freely publishing their opinions in the papers. Although we have in the past hand-waved this whenever necessary, some hardliners within the Party have argued that the State should have the power to censor and shut down those papers that oppose the regime."
 ottkem.22.a: "The Press is free."
 ottkem.22.b: "The Press is free, within limits imposed by Law."
 ottkem.22.c: "The Press is regulated by the party."

 ottkem.23.t: "Ottoman Constitution - Provincial Administration"
 ottkem.23.d: "For now the Sultan has the sole right to appoint governors to the various provinces of our Empire, which has led to a certain degree of favouritism and nepotism, where close ties with the Padishah could lead to a cushy position in one of the richer Vilayets of the realm. To resolve this issue, a new proposal has been tabled wherein the Party confers these positions amongst those that they deem most suitable. Liberals however have pointed out that this is just replacing one evil with another, and have forwarded their own proposal wherein governors are appointed through local elections. This proposal has received great support from the Arab world, who see this as a way to more personalised rule and further self-determination."
 ottkem.23.a: "The Party appoints Governors."
 ottkem.23.b: "The People appoint their own Governors."

 ottkem.24.t: "Ottoman Constitution - Veto Rights"
 ottkem.24.d: "Art. 116. In case of duly proved necessity, the Constitution may be modified in some of its provisions. This modification is subordinated to the following conditions: Every proposal of modification, whether presented by the Minister or by either of the two Chambers, must be, in the first instance, submitted to the deliberations of the Chamber of Deputies. If the proposition is approved by two-thirds of the members of the Chamber it shall be forwarded to the Senate. In case the Senate also adopts the proposed modification by a two-thirds majority, it shall be submitted for the sanction of His majesty the Sultan. If it is sanctioned by Imperial Irade, it shall have force of law. Articles of the Constitution, which it is proposed to modify, remain in force, until the modification, after having been voted by the Chambers, shall have been sanctioned by Imperial Irade.\n\nAlthough in theory just, some have questioned the need of Imperial Irade for modification to the constitution and have noted that even though the Sultan still needs to ratify laws personally, this is only symbolic. They have thus proposed to remove the extra step and put full power into the hands of Parliament and Senate."
 ottkem.24.a: "The Sultan keeps his veto."
 ottkem.24.b: "We should extend this veto right to the Grand Vizier."
 ottkem.24.c: "Parliament (Meclis-i Mebusan) and the Senate (Meclis-i Âyan) will decide."

 ottkem.25.t: "Ottoman Constitution - Royal Pardon"
 ottkem.25.d: "Article 7 of the Constitution includes amongst the royal prerogatives: "the reduction and remission of sentences passed by penal Courts and the granting of a general amnesty"\n\nThis was in 1909 adjusted to specify that general amnesty could only be granted in agreement with Parliament but was revoked once again after the Weltkrieg by Sultan Mehmet VI during his attempts to bring power back to his office. With the revision of the constitution underway, the party has seen it fit to add this clause back and is contemplating whether or not to remove the entire line, stating that the Penal Courts are a separate entity and should not be contested by the state. The Sultan however, has come down to Parliament to defend his case, stating that the symbolic action is key to his role as a benevolent ruler and that revoking it would serve no purpose."
 ottkem.25.a: "Scrap the line."
 ottkem.25.b: "The Sultan keeps his power."

 ottkem.26.t: "The New Constitution is Declared!"
 ottkem.26.d: "The new Ottoman Constitution was declared in the front garden of ancient Topkapı Palace today, with an accompanying ceremony and military parade. May our new 'Kanun-i Esasi' be auspicious!"
 ottkem.26.a: "Long live the Sultan!"

### Conservative Resistance
 ottkem.27.t: "Mysticism in the Ottoman Empire"
 ottkem.27.d: "Sufi orders have long played an important role within the Ottoman Empire, and many of our past Sultans were part of these orders. Initially serving semi-independent from the state apparatus, these orders were brought closer to the central authority of the state during the top-down reforms of the CUP at the start of the 20th century. Reforms included centralisation and bureaucratisation of the brotherhoods, the creation of training courses for Sufi sheikhs, the institution of detailed dress policies, and inspections of the practices of various orders, such that the orders became a part of the Ottoman state itself.\n\nWith their closer attachment to the state however came a closer connection to the political scene in Kostantiniyye and although only a minority of the population is part of one of these orders, their deep connection to the men of power has led to unbridled corruption and political influence. Some even go so far as to say that the electoral victory and bestowment of the Grand Vizier title on the leader of the HIF was directly caused by these orders in an attempt to break of the Kemalist reforms.\n\nConsisting of a wide plethora of orders ranging from the Mevlevi tarikat or "Whirling Dervishes" to the more powerful Kadiri tarikat whose close support of the Sultans has in the past led them to become kingmaker in the capital. As the Grand Vizier has shown his hand and his desire to greatly limit the power of these organisations, many of them are attempting to sway uncertain party members to block his proposal. The Sultan himself has also in private conversation with the Grand Vizier and multiple Sheiks from the orders showed his discontent with the direction of his Vizier."
 ottkem.27.a: "Cut their funding and split them from the State."
 ottkem.27.b: "These are not enemies we want to be making."

 ottkem.28.t: "Caliph [OTT.GetLeader] Demands the Reinstatement of the Sufi Lodges"
 ottkem.28.d: "Deferring from personally intervening, the Caliph has finally seen himself forced to intervene against his own Grand Vizier. As the radical secularisation is done with almost brute force, he isn't the only one opposing the reforms which are fundamentally changing the Ottoman state, and are according to conservatives inflicting massive damage on the pillars of its society, bordering on heresy and treason to the Caliph.\n\nThe Sultan-Caliph who not only leads the Ottoman Empire but all of Islam itself, has therefore called for a meeting with the Shaykh al-Islam and his cabinet to revert their decision to close the Sufi lodges and to reinstate their influence. Outside of the Palace walls, protests are rocking the nation as conservative hotbeds such as Bursa, Konya and Lazistan angrily react to the reforms."
 ottkem.28.a: "Re-open the lodges"
 ottkem.28.b: "They shall remain closed!"

 ottkem.29.t: "Properties of the Sufi Orders"
 ottkem.29.d: "Although greatly varying in size and wealth, many of the lodges we have recently shut down hold vast properties and cash reserves which they have used to expand their influence. As the budget of the state remains severely strapped for more to fuel the OHFs attempts to radically change the nation, the topic remains controversial. Many have already been angered by the decision to shut the lodges down and it is likely that they will see any attempts at confiscation as an heretical act by the godless followers of Kemal."
 ottkem.29.a: "Transfer the assets to the Education Ministry."
 ottkem.29.b: "Leave them be."

### Conservative Revolt
 ottkem.30.t: "Rize Incident"
 ottkem.30.d: "The day had started just as any other in the town of Rize (Lazistan) as merchants sold their wares on the market and a careless Ottoman gendarme watched over the town square enjoying some much needed shadow. Much would change shortly though and with it the future of the nation.\n\nArriving by ship, a group of 20 men led by a Dervish and accompanied by a dog they called Kitmir, the name of the magical dog which had guarded ‘the men of the cave' in the Koranic version of the Christian legend of the Seven Sleepers of Ephesus. The strangers promptly seized the green religious flag of Islam, which was kept in the local mosque, and planted it in the main square. There the dervish, a man called Mehmet, proclaimed himself Mehdi (the messiah), and claimed that he was sent by Allah to overthrow the godless rulers in the capital. A crowd of some hundred locals gathered in support, while the majority of the townspeople gaped undecided. Mehmet brandished a gun, announcing that the town was surrounded by the magical number of seventy thousand supporters.\n\nTwo officers pleaded unsuccessfully with the rioters to disperse, and then sent a platoon under the command of a young second lieutenant, Çerkesli Serdar. Serdar drew his gun and fired on dervish Mehmet, using a blank cartridge with which he had been issued for manoeuvres. Unharmed, the dervish declared that he was impervious to bullets, and drawing his gun in turn, wounded Serdar mortally. The lieutenant's body was then carried to the mosque courtyard, where the dervish cut off his head and stuck it on a pole to the applause of his supporters. Two watchmen who fired on the crowd were killed.\n\nAlarmed by the tumult, a nearby regiment quickly arrived on the scene killing Mehmet and at least a dozen of his supporters. Even though the riot was resolved quickly, the incident has sent shockwaves all the way to the capital where the Grand Vizier is reportedly furious not only at Mehmet but the population of Rize in particular who refused to come to the aid of the brave lieutenant."
 ottkem.30.a: "This is a tragic day!"

 ottkem.31.t: "Repression in Rize"
 ottkem.31.d: "The Rize incident has been particularly poorly received by the Grand Vizier, who has become so enraged by it that no one has been able to talk him out of it. Borrowing his terminology from French, he demanded that Rize should be declared a ville maudite (accursed town) and razed to the ground and its inhabitants transported, that no mercy should be shown to religious fanatics, even women, that executions should not be delayed, and that opposition journalists should, at least, be frightened by being made to appear before the court martial.\n\nWord has also spread that the dervish Mehmet belonged to the recently shut down Naqshbandi order: the order, the Grand Vizier declared, should be écrasé (crushed). In response to this possible connection, the government has sent a court martial under General Mustafa Muglali and has proclaimed martial law in all of Lazistan and vast swathes of Eastern Anatolian land.\n\nWhilst it is very unlikely that an orthodox order such as the Naqshbandi would ever support the messianic claims of Mehmet, reason has long gone out of the window as a regime of terror is installed against all remaining connections between the state and the Muslim faith."
 ottkem.31.a: "The people of Rize will pay for their deeds."

 ottkem.32.t: "Kurdish Sheikhs Gather in Diyarbakir"
 ottkem.32.d: "Shocked by the terror inflicted on the Laz people in Northern Anatolia, the Kurdish sheikhs and aghas have called a meeting in Diyarbakir to discuss their own future. Whilst firmly loyal to the Caliph, many of them see in the continued augmentation of power within the office of the Grand Vizier and the decreasing influence of the faith on Ottoman society a threat to both the Caliphate as is and their own personal influence.\n\nTherefore the Sheikhs have gathered in the Kurdish city to temporarily settle their differences, and form a united front against the heretic regime in the capital. Messages sent to the Alevi further to the west however have remained unanswered as they have not yet forgotten the vile deeds of the Hamidiye and Sunni Sheikhs only a few years earlier."
 ottkem.32.a: "Most disturbing."

 ottkem.33.t: "Sheikhs Declare Jihad"
 ottkem.33.d: "Fighting in the name of the Caliph and by extension all of Islam, several Kurdish Sheikhs, led by a Sheikh named Sait, have openly declared war on the nationalist government calling on all Muslims to join him in their mutual fight to liberate the Caliph from the tyrants in the capital. Rumour has it that the mainly Kurdish revolt is also joined by opportunistic elements of the defeated Army of Islam, Secret Organisations, and like-minded clandestine political groups.\n\nCaliph [OTT.GetLeader] has thus far refused to answer to these claims, very well aware of what happened to his predecessor Abdulhamid II in 1909 who was deposed after a failed conservative countercoup. Much like then it seems unlikely that this Jihad will find much success as the main brunt of the Ottoman officer corps remains firmly loyal to the new regime and natural enemies of the Kurds such as the Alevi, Armenians, Turkomans have refused to join the call to arms."
 ottkem.33.a: "We shall crush this pathetic insurrection."

 ottkem.34.t: "Conservative Revolt Crushed"
 ottkem.34.d: "With the last remaining hotbeds cleared out, the conservative opposition has finally been completely crushed. Not only does the OHF now rule uncontested with all real opposition firmly squashed, this has also established a certain peace within the empire as a tightly woven connection between army and state prevent civil unrest from escalating."
 ottkem.34.a: "Pax Ottomana."

### Naqshbandi plot
 ottkem.35.t: "A Conspiracy within the Naqshbandi?"
 ottkem.35.d: "The various Sufi lodges of the Empire have never hidden their aversion to the secularist policy pursued by our Grand Vizier, but be it due to a lack of power or ways to effectively act on it, have not acted. Recently however concerning reports have come in detailing activities promoted by its members in Kurdish territories and other primarily conservative regions of the Empire. More concerning however is that as the Naqshbandi remained close to the government since the Hamidian reforms, they have as such been able to infiltrate various levels of the administration. As the full scope of these operations remains unclear for now, the government of Mustafa Kemal has given the order to conduct a full investigation of its bureaucracy and the army to expose said elements and expunge those from the reformed Ottoman state."
 ottkem.35.a: "Leave no stone unturned!"

 ottkem.36.t: "Corruption within the Ottoman Bank of Honour"
 ottkem.36.d: "The Ottoman Bank of Honour, founded during the Weltkrieg by the CUP has steadily become more and more important within the Ottoman Empire and has become its official national bank since. Swept up in the statewide investigation for anti-government elements, an almost astonishing network of corruption, bribery and nepotism was uncovered stretching from deals with the Maronite Church, gifts to various notables to mass land acquisition in Eastern Anatolia. Even though the investigation is still in full sway, more than 300 employees and associates linked to the organisation have already been arrested with many more likely to follow across the Mashriq."
 ottkem.36.a: "Do they have no shame?!"

 ottkem.37.t: "Embezzlement in the Ministry of Religious Affairs"
 ottkem.37.d: "Responsible for both the maintenance of Islamic institutions and organising religious education, the Ministry has long been held in low esteem by the OHF leadership who see it as a compromise solution with the Caliph and a drain on government resources at best. As the investigation however continues to uproot the bureaucracy of the Empire, large embezzlement operations have been uncovered here as well with traces leading all the way up the Naqshbandi hierarchy."
 ottkem.37.a: "Are we surrounded by crooks and thieves?!"

 ottkem.38.t: "Murder on the Orient Express"
 ottkem.38.d: "Rage could be heard in the chambers of the Grand Vizier today as a report came in that one of the leading agents in the investigation was murdered on the famous railroad connecting the Porte with the European continent. The victim, tasked with investigating the reports of corruption near the city of Edirne in Eastern Thrace, was known amidst the corps for his highly effective methods and devoted loyalty to the state.\n\nLeaving little evidence behind, a so called private detective with a Belgian accent and curly moustache nonetheless attempted to interfere with the case and was promptly detained by the Ottoman Gendarmerie for obstruction of the law and insulting a representative of the state even though it is unlikely that the man had anything to do with the murder."
 ottkem.38.a: "This is getting dangerous..."

 ottkem.39.t: "Black Hand Uncovered"
 ottkem.39.d: "Calling themselves the 'Black Hand', a paramilitary organisation was uncovered in Eastern Anatolia, while they attempted to rally support in the countryside around Erzurum. The organisation, pleading for a strict moral adherence to the Quran and the Sharia code, seems to be in large part recruiting from the demobilised Army of Islam with which Enver Pasha descended on the Caucasus after the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk.\n\nAlthough not a separatist organisation and with self-proclaimed loyalty to the Caliph, their intentions are clearly targeted at overthrowing the OHF administration and restoring the executive powers of the Sultan-Caliph. Many Kurdish Sheikhs and Aghas, who see in their cause a way to retain their positions now that has become apparent that Kostantiniyye will enforce direct rule over the region, have been rumoured to associate themselves with the organisation and even pleaded military support should the need arise.\n\nNonetheless, their early discovery by government agents has severely limited their potential, as the first wave of arrests and executions is cutting away the head of the snake. Granting an excuse to the Walis of Eastern Anatolia to interfere more directly with Kurdish affairs, gendarmerie and army detachments have also been sent in to replace the affiliated Sheikhs with government agents."
 ottkem.39.a: "A grand victory."

### Karakol Society Coup
 ottkem.40.t: "Reports of a Conspiracy against the Sultan"
 ottkem.40.d: "Troubling news arose earlier this week as the Milli Emniyet Hizmeti started picking up the trail of a conspiracy against the Sultan and the government in general. Consisting of a radicalised core of former CUP supporters, an anonymous source tipped off the Kostantiniyye police warning them of a coming plot to assassinate both the Sultan and the Grand Vizier, assert control over the Porte and crown a new Sultan subservient to their cause. Amongst the conspirators various members of the old CUP Teskilât-i Mahsusa (Special Organisation) of Enver Pasha, many still placed in high positions within the army and security forces. The size of the network is hard to estimate, as bad communication with the Eastern provinces where various groups loyal to Envers former Army of Islam still roam, hindering the gendarmerie's ability to conduct a full investigation."
 ottkem.40.a: "Order the arrest of Kara Kemal and place the suspects under House Arrest!"

 ottkem.41.t: "Constantinople Corps Prevents Arrests"
 ottkem.41.d: "Police officers attempting to arrest Kara Kemal and 7 other politicians were blocked by soldiers of the Constantinople Corps today. Army units prevented the arrests and took Kara Kemal and the others into hiding at an unknown location. There is great confusion as to what is happening."
 ottkem.41.a: "What's going on?!"

 ottkem.42.t: "Armed Putsch"
 ottkem.42.d: "The situation rapidly descended into chaos, as soldiers from the Constantinople Corps took to the streets and martial law was declared. Within an hour, army units took control of the Sublime Porte, major roads, bridges and telegraph stations across the city. A battalion of soldiers led by two armed civilians was also reported to be moving towards the Royal Palace."
 ottkem.42.a: "Uh oh..."

 ottkem.43.t: "The Palace Raid"
 ottkem.43.d: "The putsch reached the palace as an army battalion forced its way into Dolmabahçe. After killing 4 royal guards defending the entrance, soldiers and armed civilians entered palace grounds. Sporadic resistance was offered by palace guards once inside the building. According to an unconfirmed report, the putschists burst into the Royal Chambers of Sultan Abdülmecid II and tried to force his abdication. Unexpectedly, the old and stubborn Sultan pulled out his gold-engraved revolver with a shaky hand, and a terrible firefight ensued. Sultan Abdülmecid II and three of his personal guards were slain in the fighting. Undeterred, the putschists captured Ahmed Nihad Efendi and proclaimed him the new Sultan. It appears that we have no choice but to accept this terrible turn of events!"
 ottkem.43.a: "This ends here! Fight the rebels!"

 ottkem.44.t: "Osman Fuad Rides Out!"
 ottkem.44.d: "Osman Fuad Efendi, Ottoman şehzade and field marshal, was in Şişli discussing the state of the Eastern Army with Mustafa Kemal and Field Marshal Fevzi Pasha when he received news of the Palace Raid. He went straight to the Royal Stables and took control of the 300-strong Ertuğrul Cavalry Regiment - a ceremonial lancer unit formed from Karakeçili Turkmens. In full ceremonial uniform, armed with lance, carbine and cavalry sabres, the household cavalry charged downhill to the Dolmabahçe Palace and crushed the paramilitary rebels positioned outside. Assaulting the palace itself, they chased the rebels through the building, and rescued [Root.GetLeader]. Osman Fuad was reportedly enraged to find the Sultan murdered and swore justice would be done. On his orders, the cavalry regiment was quickly assembled outside the Palace."
 ottkem.44.a: "Onwards!"

 ottkem.45.t: "Osman Crosses the Golden Horn"
 ottkem.45.d: "Reacting to the unexpected horseback assault by Osman Fuad, the Karakol Society sent two army battalions to reinforce Dolmabahçe Palace. Upon reaching the Palace however both units disobeyed their commanders and switched sides to support the well-liked warrior prince. After appointing trustworthy officers to command the formations, Osman Fuad placed a loyalist infantry battalion to guard the Palace and took the other battalion with him to the Parliament. Encountering no resistance at the Parliament, Osman Fuad positioned his infantry to defend the main road and marched on with his cavalry. The elite Ertuğrul Cavalry Regiment soon reached the Galata Bridge, held by rebel paramilitary units. The regiment - who regularly crossed this bridge every week to join the Sultan in Ayasofya Mosque - defeated the rebels on the northern side and charged across the bridge to rout the rebels on the southern side. The Sublime Porte lay ahead of them, atop a great hill and defended by rebels."
 ottkem.45.a: "Forward, show no mercy!"

 ottkem.46.t: "Osman Captures the Sublime Porte"
 ottkem.46.d: "Osman Fuad marched his regiment uphill to take the War Ministry and end the rebellion where it began. After hours of heavy fighting across the Bab-i Ali Avenue, Osman and his cavalry routed the remaining rebels and captured the ministries. Once in control of the War Ministry, Osman Fuad Efendi had radio orders sent to all units of the Constantinople Corps to return to their barracks, and spent the rest of the night organising cleanup operations across the city. Some rebels tried to escape by boats while many others simply surrendered. By dawn, all that remained of the rebellion were the bodies and the smell of gunpowder."
 ottkem.46.a: "A great victory!"

 ottkem.47.t: "Osman Executes the Rebels"
 ottkem.47.d: "Osman Fuad, the Hero of Tripolitania, Defeater of the Rebels, and Commander of the Royal Cavalry, organised the capture of several hundred rebels in the days following the putsch. Rank-and-file soldiers were sent to military prison for crimes against the constitution, but their commanders weren't as lucky. Osman Fuad ordered the officers and all paramilitary units put to death for their acts of treason."
 ottkem.47.a: "Ready the firing squad!"

 ottkem.48.t: "Osman Executes the Murderers"
 ottkem.48.d: "After the first round of executions, Osman Fuad had the leaders of the putsch brought to Sultanahmet Square for court martial. The six men were quickly convicted for the murder of the Sultan, and sentenced to death. The only question that remained was how..."
 ottkem.48.a: "Firing squad."
 ottkem.48.b: "Hanging."

 ottkem.49.t: "Osman Fuad Crowned Sultan!"
 ottkem.49.d: "Having restored order to the capital, Osman Fuad assumed full control of the Ottoman Armed Forces. After graciously allowing [Root.GetLeader] to go into retirement in Yıldız Palace, Osman Fuad son of Mehmed rode to Eyüp Sultan Mosque at head of his Ertuğrul Cavalry. Surrounded by an immense crowd, he entered the mosque alone for the sword ceremony. After brief prayers by clergymen, the ancient Sword of Osman was brought forward. Osman Fuad astonished everyone present by taking the sword and tying it to his belt himself, in defiance of the customs. The ceremony ended with the declaration of the new Padişah to the public. Later that day, the 44-year-old Sultan visited the tombs of his ancestors around the old city in preparation for his sovereign duties as Sultan Osman-ı Rābi'."
 ottkem.49.a: "Long live the Sultan!"

 ottkem.50.t: "Osman Fuad Summons Mustafa Kemal"
 ottkem.50.d: "Comrades in arms during both the Turkish-Italian war and the Weltkrieg, the friendship between Mustafa Kemal Pasha and the newly crowned Sultan is no secret, and their friendly appearances side by side in public have further reinforced the close ties the two men are deemed to have. As such it came as no surprise to the Ottoman people that the former Grand Vizier of the late Sultan Abdulmecid II was summoned earlier today to the Palace to discuss the future of the Empire.\n\nAgreeing on a wide selection of topics, the Sultan has requested from Kemal that he fully presents his plans for the future of the State and has bestowed upon him the office of the Grand Vizier once more."
 ottkem.50.a: "A powerful duo has taken control."

### Death of Kemal Post-CP war
 ottkem.51.t: "Mustafa Kemal Hospitalised"
 ottkem.51.d: "Although our Grand Vizier has reached the zenith of his career, bringing the empire back from the brink of destruction, it has come at great physical cost to the man. Years of stress, smoking and bad drinking habits are greatly weighing him down and have led to a steady decrease of time spent in public.\n\nAlthough always remaining stubborn and refusing to resign, many of the day-to-day affairs have behind the scenes already been transferred over to his trusted friend Ismet, who seems set to succeed the Lion of Antep himself. Whether Ismet will be capable of maintaining the same degree of authority is however far less certain, and talks with various opposition figures concerning toning down the heavy restrictions are being conducted behind the back of the Grand Vizier."
 ottkem.51.a: "Let us pray for a speedy recovery."

 ottkem.52.t: "Death of Mustafa Kemal Pasha"
 ottkem.52.d: "As his condition deteriorated only further in the next few weeks, many were convinced that the final days of the Grand Vizier were finally upon us. Accepting his own fate, the man summoned a few of his closest friends and his adoptive daughter, Sabiha and started writing his will. Upon putting his signature below the text, all medical bulletins were stopped and the final hours of the Vizier started to unfold. Flanked at his bed stand by his secretary, three Turkish doctors and the commander of the Guard, he addressed his final words to doctor Neset Ömer: Aleyküsselâm (Peace to you) — the Muslim reply to a greeting. At 9:05 AM, Ghazi and Grand Vizier Mustafa Kemal Pasha blew out his last breath. His friend Salih would later burst into his room and upon seeing the body of his patron, step outside and shoot himself in the chest.\n\nWithin the will were his wishes to bequeath all his property to the party, with a monthly stipend for his sister, and a curious note about his ally Ismet Pasha to whom he left the sum necessary to fund the education of his children, knowing that the man had little riches. Furthermore, he also officially nominated Ismet as his successor, referring party leadership to Cêlal.\n\nParliament in [TUR.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] was quick to respond with an official day of mourning, and a joint statement thanking the man for his actions during the war was issued written out to "Halâskâr Gazi", the Saviour Gazi (Holy Warrior). Various vessels, both small and large, military and civilian furthermore sailed in front of his seashore villa, shouting, crying and waving the Ottoman flag in memory of the man now forever captivated in the legacy of our Grand Empire."
 ottkem.52.a: "Let us weep for the defender of Gelibolu, the Lion of Antep and the Ghazi of Maraş!"

### 1940 Elections
 ottkem.53.t: "Elections of [GetYear]"
 ottkem.53.d: "Despite a lack of parties, which were abolished only a few years ago, there has nonetheless been a real impetus by the political establishment to challenge the ruling OHF power bloc. The OHF from their end has abstained from blocking candidates of many moderate (former) parties to run as the Grand Vizier has shown his understanding that at least a limited form of democracy is necessary to progress.\n\nNonetheless the party has taken measures to avoid conservative reactionaries from winning the vote in many of the conservative bastions of our state. Members of the Ulemma, representatives of Sufi orders and local notables with clear religious sympathies have all been stripped from the lists "to put a definitive halt to the decay of the Sublime Porte"."
 ottkem.53.a: "The OHF stands victorious."

### Balkan War Intervention
 ottkem.60.t: "The Grand Vizier Speaks"
 ottkem.60.d: "Praising the virtue and bravery of the Ottoman soldiers on the frontlines fighting for the honour of the Empire, the Grand Vizier has called upon parliament to provide a unified statement of praise at the address of the Sultan congratulating him with the victories of his troops. Hammering down on the shared duty to the Ottoman state and its Sultan every single one of them shares, he has subsequently requested that Parliament be temporarily dismissed until the war is over and that he be granted full executive powers to guide the nations during these trying times. How can one, he continues, have an issue with the Exalted Sultan and per extension his Council of Ministers during this crisis and how could there be disagreement in a cause so righteous and noble?\n\nAnswered by the ear-shattering applause from his supporters, and the rise of representatives from all across the Empire to outdo the other in singing their praise of the most Exalted of Sultans and his loyal servant, a vote on the proposal was called at once and answered by nigh unanimous support from both sides as members of the opposition fear that rising their voice against a cause so patriotic and so just may paint them as enemies of the State and traitors to our beloved Caliph.\n\nAs word of the parliamentary agreement spread to the streets of Kostantiniyye and the letter of praise is proclaimed to the roaring patriotic crowds gathered in front of the building (some say as part of an organised action by the OHF), tears spontaneously spring up in the eyes of the bystanders as the excitement and enthusiasm of the people spreads to both sides of the Bosporus."
 ottkem.60.a: "Long live the Devlet-i Ebed-müddet! Long live the Padishah!"

 ottkem.61.t: "Kemalists Close Down HIF newspapers"
 ottkem.61.d: "Bearing the seal of the Grand Vizier and an irade decreeing the closure of all anti-patriotic news agencies, police forces and soldiers of the Constantinople Corps could be seen going from door to door confiscating printing presses and sealing offices of newspapers affiliated to the opposition. Liberal protestors gathered in front of the buildings have called upon the soldiers to cease their actions at once, crying out that the freedom of speech and free press are being silenced by the dictatorship of the Grand Vizier.\n\nA small skirmish between police forces and protestors in front of the HIFs main office was broken up by police batons as 10 bystanders were taken into custody for "unpatriotic actions" and "treason towards the Sultan"."
 ottkem.61.a: "The Grand Vizier tightens his grip on the nation."

 ottkem.62.t: "The Grand Vizier Travels to the Front"
 ottkem.62.d: "To bolster the morale of the troops on the frontlines and his own reputation as the Ghazi of Maras, the old Commander-in-chief of the Ottoman army and current Grand Vizier has decided to take a trip to the front to discuss the situation with his generals.\n\nCongratulating the high command for their astonishing victories and shaking hands with many of the foot-soldiers in the army, the Pasha's actions seem more like an election campaign and less like governing. The action is successful nonetheless, as the popularity of the Hero of Antep and Maras continues to rise with every victory on the field."
 ottkem.62.a: "The army salutes its hero!"

 ottkem.63.t: "Incorporation of Thrace"
 ottkem.63.d: "The nation stands victorious atop the corpse of the Bulgarian state, successfully wrestling back control over its lost territories. Throughout Western Thrace the army is hailed as heroes, and sons of Osman himself, as in Kostantiniyye the triumph of Mustafa Kemal is supreme. From his actions in the Italian-Ottoman war to his valiant defence at Gallipoli to his role in the closing stages of the Weltkrieg, there can be no more doubt of his skill and patriotism.\n\nAlthough not originally envisioning a campaign into the Balkans in his designs for the nation, the re-conquest of the lost sons of Osman has made him nigh untouchable within the Ottoman political sphere. All eyes are on him, Ghazi Mustafa Kemal Pasha, now as the opposition tries to garner what support it has to prevent this man from disabling them indefinitely."
 ottkem.63.a: "His rise was spectacular but it's easy to fall when you're up so high."

 ottkem.64.t: "Unrest in Thrace"
 ottkem.64.d: "During the Dark Years of the Empire when its borders were under assault from all sides, massive population displacements occurred in the Balkans, as from one day upon another hundreds of thousands of Muslims found themselves in a nation overtly hostile to their existence. Endless caravans of refugees were forced to leave the former Ottoman territories after its humiliating defeats and tried to find a new home on the edges of the capital from where the Ottoman government tried to resettle them across Anatolia.\n\nMany of these people forced out of their homes in a war they often played no part in have seen in the recent re-conquest of Bulgarian territory to finally return home, and have been encouraged to do so by Kostantiniyye, who desires to deport as many Bulgarians out of her territory as possible. To make room for these people, the government has confiscated vast swathes of land from Bulgarian landowners to distribute amongst its citizens.\n\nNot unsurprisingly, the Bulgarian people living on the land are opposing the government wherever they can, as skirmishes between Muslim Turks and Bulgars are daily occurrences throughout the region. To answer the growing crisis and to restore public order to these new acquisitions of the Empire, the army has requested a mandate to restore order, by force if necessary. Foreign response has been openly negative to the deportations and some more cautious members of our government are requesting us to tone down the scale of the operations to avoid creating the scene for a European intervention, not unlike those seen throughout the 19th Century."
 ottkem.64.a: "Let's not do anything drastic."
 ottkem.64.b: "Send in the Army."

 ottkem.65.t: "The Village Institutes"
 ottkem.65.d: "As a way to increase the literacy rate of the rural population, the ministry of education has announced the creation of the 'Köy Enstitüleri' or Village Institutes. To combat the lack of schools in most of the Empires villages, this programme plans to train teachers so they can pass their knowledge on to their hometowns (or to induce social change in areas hard to reach by the government).\n\nOne of the main foci of these schools is to improve the agricultural efficiency of the countryside and therefore they all possess large cultivable fields with which new farming methods are taught. Other disciplines taught include practical subjects such as fishing, carpentry, construction and theoretical ones such as mathematics, science, literature and history. Furthermore, all students are required to read 25 books per year to broaden their horizons and learn to play a musical instrument. A highly radical idea launched in these schools furthermore are the weekly meetings in which students can freely criticise their teachers and the school administration.\n\nOpposition to the schools has started almost as soon as they opened as conservatives attack the policy of co-education, whilst anti-socialists oppose the open availability of leftists' works in the school libraries. Local leaders have uttered their own complaints as they see these highly educated students not only take over education but matters of farming and local industry."
 ottkem.65.a: "An amazing initiative!"

# ### The OHF After the CP war
 # ottkem.66.t: "Mustafa Kemal in Seclusion"
 # ottkem.66.d: "Although able to lay the foundations of his grand reforms, the health of our Grand Vizier has as of late steadily deteriorated as the symptoms of his disease are gradually sapping more and more of his strength. Initially refusing to accept medical treatment, he was finally convinced by his friend Ismet Pasha to bring in a foreign doctor who diagnosed him with cirrhosis. This news, coming as a great shock to the still brittle OHF, is causing great consternation amongst its leadership as the Grand Vizier is seen as the metaphorical glue holding not just the party but the entire country together.\n\nKemal has however urged them not to panic, promising them that his illness is but a minor setback on the long road towards the uplifting of the Ottoman people, and has secluded himself at the Yalova Spa for a week of rest."
 # ottkem.66.a: "We wish him a speedy recovery!"

 # ottkem.67.t: "Last Days of the Government"
 # ottkem.67.d: "As the health of our Vizier continues to deteriorate at an ever-increasing pace, the prospects for the future have become very bleak. Forced to stay within the borders of his villa on the Bosporus, he has been forced to seclude himself even further from the day to day affairs of the government, leaving all tasks to his trusted friend Ismet Pasha. In the meanwhile, official reports of his health have been refused, pushing a narrative to the Ottoman public that the Vizier is only suffering from influenza and will surely be able to resume his position in a few weeks' time. His official doctor, Nihat Resat, is however less optimistic and has told the leading cadre of the OHF that their grand leader could die at any moment, an opinion supported by imported experts from Austria-Hungary and the German Empire."
 # ottkem.67.a: "What will the future bring?"

# #
# #
# #

 # ottkem.68.t: "Fragmentation of the OHF"
 # ottkem.68.d: "With the matter of succession remaining unsolved, caused by Kemal consistent refusal to formally appoint a successor and instead deferring to an election in the Ottoman parliament, various figures within the OHF are trying to establish themselves as the dominant power in the post-Kemal era. Ismet Pasha currently seems the most likely successor, but conflicts within the party between the moderates under Celal Bayar and the hardliners under Recep Peker are splitting the party in two.\n\nTo make matters worse, talks between the moderate flank OHF and the leadership of the disbanded DF have opened, paving the way towards a possible dismantlement of the single-party dictatorship and its replacement by a broad 'democratic' alternative. This alternative, dubbed the 'Endeavour Front' aims to replace the current government of bureaucrats with a broad front of military figures, conservatives, landowners and the [TUR.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] elite.\n\nCountered by this threat, the hardliners are rallying around the plans of Recep Peker whose ideas (based on populist movements in Europe and America) plan to unify party and state and fully subject the economy to an étatist model, pushing the secular reforms of Kemal to their extreme.\n\nThus far Ismet Pasha has refrained from openly supporting either side, preferring to walk in the middle of the road and pursue a course of cooperation with both flanks, although his alignment seems thus far closer to the hardliners than the liberal flank."
 # ottkem.68.a: "We must tread carefully"

# FEVZI EVENTS #

 ottfev.1.t: "Military Takes Control over the Media"
 ottfev.1.d: "In an unprecedented attempt to "stop the spread of misinformation" and ensure only one narrative can take hold, the military has today taken hold of printing presses, radio centres and other channels of communications. With info concerning the attack on the Grand Vizier still severely limited and only dispersed through state bulletins, a wave of uncertainty and paranoia has spread across the empire with many in the urban areas amassing large supply reserves in fear of possible further instability."
 ottfev.1.a: "We have everything under control"

 ottfev.2.t: "Security in the Vilayets"
 ottfev.2.d: "To ensure chaos remains limited as far as possible in the periphery, Ismet Pasha has given the order to recall all Walis to the capital and to be given new marching orders. Benefitting from the occasion however, some have suggested to use this opportunity to replace some of the less loyal governors with military yes-men and to as such increase control of our emergency government.\n\nThe action would likely lead to great discontent amongst the Arabs however who may see this as yet another move of Turkish imperialism in a crisis they have no hand in."
 ottfev.2.a: "Keep the current Walis"
 ottfev.2.b: "A few adjustments won't hurt anyone"

 ottfev.3.t: "Arab Officers Complain about Their Positions"
 ottfev.3.d: "Although the Ottoman military is open to all ethnicities in the Empire, the upper caste of the military establishment has remained almost entirely in Turkish hands, to great discontent of the Arab officers, who see an invisible glass ceiling. Now that parliament has been temporarily dismissed and Arab deputies no longer have a way to express their concerns, some of these officers had hoped to play more important roles in the military administration with so far little success.\n\nWhilst many of these officers are lower rank, some are questioning however whether we should execute a round of promotions amongst the Arab staff to ensure that the Iraqi and Syrian armies remain under our control, pointing out the threat Arab nationalist propaganda may pose on the wavering loyalty of these army corps. Others have suggested that a mere shuffle of officers around our various armies may already be enough to mediate the threat and that by moving many of the less dedicated Arab officers to the Balkan and Caucasian fronts, they will no longer pose an issue."
 ottfev.3.a: "You're a General and you're a General! Everyone gets free promotions!"
 ottfev.3.b: "No reason to take drastic measures"

 ottfev.4.t: "Yashin Al-Hashimi Submits His Resignation"
 ottfev.4.d: "Decorated veteran of the Weltkrieg, one of our greatest allies in Iraq and Müsir of the Iraqi army, Yashin Al-Hashimi has offered his resignation earlier today. Doing so in protest to the lack of Arab input into the new direction the state has chosen to pursue, the man has laid down his military position, and has returned to his home in Baghdad. So far it remains unclear whether he will continue his position as 'deputy' of Baghdad or pursue a career in local politics but the ramifications amongst the rest of the Arab officer corps are likely to be immense."
 ottfev.4.a: "Most unfortunate"

 ottfev.5.t: "Cult of the Marshal"
 ottfev.5.d: "Never a man of much public display, the popularity of the Marshal amongst the Turkish troops has increased tremendously lately as his dedication to crushing shadowy cabals and eliminating all glaring and conspicuous signs of corruption has been received exceptionally well. Originating amongst the Kostantiniyye garrison, a soldier's song honouring the Marshal seems to have spread to most of the Turkish divisions by now and has been received well by the Marshal himself as well.\n\n"Mareşal biz buradayız!" or "Marshal, here we are!", the song is an interesting addition to the military music repository with many of the older songs referring to the lengthy and costly campaigns in Yemen or other tragic events in the military history of the empire."
 ottfev.5.a: "The army salutes its leader!"

 ottfev.6.t: "Maintenance of Public Order Law"
 ottfev.6.d: "As a solution to the immunity of sitting representatives and to grant the executive powers necessary to thoroughly remove all possible opposition to the establishment of stability, the 'Maintenance of Public Order' law was enforced through imperial decree earlier today. Granting the Marshal nigh-endless authority and completely sidelining parliament for as long the nation remains in crisis (decided by the Marshal), an opportunity has presented itself to Fevzi Pasha to effectively eradicate all remaining opposition to his designs.\n\nMany desperados, veterans and former members of the CUP have already remained in hiding, for fear of being considered complicit in these ghastly crimes, whilst others have already taken the cowards way out. Kılıç Ali Bey, one of these individuals, has reportedly shot himself after gendarmerie broke down the door of his home, when others such as Kara Kemal fled the capital in a hurry to escape arrest.\n\nMembers of the HIF aren't spared either as a wave of arrests targeting them for possible complicity, even though none of them seem to have any solid connection to the plot, is shaking up the capital. Newspapers not following the new party line are shut down, military training exercises cancelled, officers temporarily put on leave and the residence of the Grand Vizier put under close guard 24/7 as paranoia or, as some see it, political opportunism takes hold of the nation."
 ottfev.6.a: "None shall escape the Law"

 ottfev.7.t: "Tribunals of Progress Opened"
 ottfev.7.d: "Dubbed the 'Tribunals of Progress', through the special emergency measures a number of tribunals have been set up in Kostantiniyye, Izmir and Bursa to persecute all those possible involved in the “political coup against democracy”. Chaired by Bald Ali, a former lieutenant colonel in the Ottoman army and former CUP member himself, the list of men associated with the conspiracy keeps growing by the day as the megalomania and paranoia of the military establishment has reached new highs.\n\nTried with a combination of charges ranging from trumped-up bribery claims, treason to the state, abandonment of duty and more, it seems likely that the trials will be used more as a political play to silence the opposition rather than to punish those responsible for the disruption of law and order."
 ottfev.7.a: "Most disturbing"

 ottfev.8.t: "Tribunal of Progress: Military Command"
 ottfev.8.d: "Although evidence of complicity is scarce for almost all of those brought before the judge, there remains a certain truth to the charges that many of them harbour resentments toward the Marshal and hope to see his early demise either out of opposition to the OHF, their own close association with the former CUP, or fear for their own careers and even lives. Only 7 men on the list however were able to be caught by the Gendarmerie as many others departed the country shortly after the failed attempt, or have gone into hiding in the vast hinterlands of Eastern Anatolia. Unfortunately for the Tribunal, this also means that those who were picked up by the Gendarmerie carry the least guilt and although some links to a backroom meeting almost 5 years ago were found, the content of said meeting and whether or not this could be associated with successive seems muddy at best."
 ottfev.8.a: "Persecute only those with solid evidence"
 ottfev.8.b: "They are all guilty!"

 ottfev.9.t: "Tribunal of Progress: Opposition Leadership"
 ottfev.9.d: "Dubbed the 'Black Band' or Kara Çete (a wordplay on the secret organisation called the Karakol Society), Bald Ali has dragged onto the stage many of the powerful figures still remaining of the CUP and its successor parties, often with close ties to the Liberal Entente. Benefitting from the occasion however, Ali has proposed to also target a variety of key members in the HIF leadership whose connection to any sort of plot is hard to prove but who could possibly have accidentally cursed the name of the Marshal in the open. Within the OHF itself however, it's becoming increasingly clear that overstepping the boundaries of justice to boost political goals may lead to a split as various more moderate representatives have started to form a clique around the close friend of Kemal, Ali Fuat Pasha."
 ottfev.9.a: "Persecute only those with solid evidence"
 ottfev.9.b: "They are all guilty!"

 ottfev.10.t: "Tribunal of Progress: Bureaucracy"
 ottfev.10.d: "Even though the CUP and later the OHF was able to infiltrate all ranks of the Ottoman bureaucracy, many of the higher posts remain inhabited by close associates of the Sultan, HIF appointed candidates and disloyal CUP members who distanced themselves from its successor party. Now that it seems clear that the Fevzi clique is steadily marching towards the establishment of a dictatorship with themselves at the helm, an opportunity has presented itself to persecute these people and replace them with men loyal to the Marshal. Both a massive undertaking and one sure to risk the ire of both the Sultan and the Ottoman Parliament; with the backing of the Military however, it is unlikely anything can oppose the Marshal's will."
 ottfev.10.a: "Persecute only those with solid evidence"
 ottfev.10.b: "They are all guilty!"

 ottfev.11.t: "Fevzi Pasha Announces the End of the State of Emergency"
 ottfev.11.d: "Preferring the role of the Cincinnatus, the Marshal has today announced the end of his short-lived dictatorship. Decreeing that all those responsible for the crimes against the former Grand Vizier have received their just fate and laying down all his emergency powers, the intentions of the Marshal seem true and a return to democracy is now back in sight.\n\nTo ensure stability in the transition period and to give ample time for election preparations, Ismet Pasha will temporarily retain the position of Grand Vizier albeit with limited jurisdiction until parliament reconvenes."
 ottfev.11.a: "A grand day for the Sublime State!"

 ottfev.12.t: "Elections of [GetYear]"
 ottfev.12.d: "Although the remnants of the Liberal Entente have tried their best to rally the troops and spread their propaganda, the decision of our Mareşal to hold elections within two months has made any form of victory by their front nigh impossible. This was further exacerbated by the closing of the ranks within the OHF and the formation of the 'Endeavour Front' between various powerful parties. Furthermore, there was strong support of the Ottoman bureaucracy for the Front as they hoped that with it, the legacy of the CUP could be carried forwards and their plans executed. When the last ballots were counted, it was no surprise that the Front had successfully acquired the landslide it aimed for."
 ottfev.12.a: "The Çalışma Cephesi stands victorious!"

 ottfev.13.t: "Formation of the Çalışma Cephesi"
 ottfev.13.d: "Encouraged by our Mareşal, the various political parties have been brought together to create what has rapidly become known as the 'çalışma cephesi' or 'Endeavour Front'. Including key politicians from all factions, both decentralist and centralist, this front strives to provide a stable transitional government until all foreign threats have abated and the internal situation has been pacified.\n\nAlthough various liberal figures, especially amongst the ranks of the HIF, have denounced the initiative as it would only serve as a cover for continued military guidance, Kazim Karabekir has openly accepted the offer and has been seen together with Inonu by the [TUR.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] press. It seems unlikely that they see fully eye to eye on matters of political reform and the dwindling economic power of the Porte but for now these two heavy weights are uniting their forces."
 ottfev.13.a: "Stability for all!"

# LIBERAL EVENTS #
##################
 ottlib.1.t: "OHF Loses the Elections of [GetYear]"
 ottlib.1.d: "What some may have seen coming ever since their close victory in 1935 has today become reality: the OHF, party of the Turkish nationalists and CUP remnants, has been thoroughly defeated and their coalition shattered.\n\nNow we must pick up where the Liberal Entente left off in 1934 and repair all that has been torn down. The first matter of the day however is already a very precarious one however as even though the OHF coalition no longer has the majority, we aren't as united of a front as we would have liked to be, and the choice of Grand Vizier is a hotly contested discussion subject amongst the various party leaders. Prince Sabahattin, leader of the largest party (HIF), seems set to take this position with his programme of full decentralisation and his bold initiative to reinvent the Ottoman Empire. Shakib Arslan from the Mt Lebanon region seems to be his main opponent with a focus on Islamic solidarity, morality and a return to old. The Druze prince, better known as Amir al-Bayan (Prince of Eloquence) has captivated the minds and hearts of many prominent Arab families and seems to have the support of the religious establishment with some even going so far as having an ear within the palace.\n\nAs these two squabble for the position however, many are turning eyes to the DF whose support during the last liberal coalition was instrumental for its success. The relatively young party, founded by ex-general Kazim Karabekir Pasha, nonetheless has seen its election results explode with every election as the promise of a middle way between the hard-line OHF and the Liberal Entente is finding large support amongst the Turkish middle class whilst the generals personal record can count on the support of many former and present soldiers."
 ottlib.1.a: "May we soon find an acceptable candidate."

 ottlib.2.t: "Kazim Karabekir Returns from Armenia"
 ottlib.2.d: "Serving as Wali of the Armenian vilayet since 1935, former brigadier-general and Weltkrieg hero Kazim Karabekir Pasha has returned to the capital to participate in the coalition talks currently ongoing. His party, the DF (Democratic Party), has once again seen a significant increase in seats and as the rising star within the Empire, many expect that he will do a bid for the position of Grand Vizier.\n\nArriving through Haydarpasa station on the Eastern side of the Bosporus, the man was escorted directly to Dolmabahçe Palace for an audience with Sultan [OTT.GetLeader]. With a programme serving as the middle ground between the older and for many aristocratic HIF and the authoritarian OHF, it seems likely that the Sultan will at least seriously consider the man who has in the past already stood close to the palace."
 ottlib.2.a: "Welcome back Pasha!"

 ottlib.3.t: "Conservatives Flock to Prince Sabahattin's Banner"
 ottlib.3.d: "Coalition talks seem to be progressing in a satisfactory fashion as Prince Sabahattin seems well underway to form an acceptable coalition to oppose the centralists. With a programme focused on severe decentralisation and with most governing shifted to provincial assemblies, many of the minorities and Arabs are showing their support for his ideas. Nonetheless many conservatives remain opposed as whilst they believe that the programme of the OHF is borderline heresy and a disaster for the Ottoman state, they remain opposed to complete decentralisation as they fear this would have a negative effect on Islam and the position of the Sultan-Caliph."
 ottlib.3.a: "All eyes are on the Sultan now."

 ottlib.4.t: "Sultan [OTT.GetLeader] Appoints the Next Grand Vizier"
 ottlib.4.d: "As decreed by the Ottoman constitution, the final decision remains in the hands of the Sultan-Caliph, and as such many were wondering what was going in-between the palace walls. After thorough discussion with all candidates and a meeting with his advisors, the Sultan has today affirmed the next Grand Vizier as:"
 ottlib.4.a: "Prince Sabahattin"

 ottlib.5.t: "Turkish Nationalists Leave the DF"
 ottlib.5.d: "Disillusioned by the continued cooperation of the DF with the HIF, and fully convinced that the path they have chosen is destined to lead the empire into ruin, a group of Turkish nationalist deputies has announced that they would break their ties with the party and form their own faction. Whilst this comes as a significant blow to the party and may eventually lead to them abandoning the coalition if further signs point this way, the government currently still has a workable coalition."
 ottlib.5.a: "Most unfortunate."

 ottlib.6.t: "Corruption Scandal Rocks the HIF"
 ottlib.6.d: "Brought to the parliamentary floor by a group of opposition members, a clear link has been established between the undersecretary of the Grand Vizier and unknown expenses of the Ottoman treasury. Furthermore, they have proof that the man misused his position to empower his friends and family, granting them significant properties from the Defterdarlik (internal revenue office) in the region of Ainteb. This news was further soured by the testimony of Aintebi citizens who pointed out that the properties were seized by the Ottoman state during the Armenian deportations and never returned, even though their original inhabitants safely found their way home against all odds.\n\nThis unfortunate correlation has had significant repercussions on the Armenian delegates of the HIF, who out of protest have announced their immediate departure from the coalition, taking up their places amongst the independents."
 ottlib.6.a: "Most unfortunate."

 ottlib.7.t: "The Abandoned Properties Laws"
 ottlib.7.d: "As the deportations of Armenians and Greeks increased during the Weltkrieg and the death count started to ramp up, their possessions were usually left behind and confiscated by local Muslims. To deal with the growing amount of abandoned houses and other properties, these were ultimately placed under the regulations of the Abandoned Properties Laws and made possession of the state until the original owner could return and prove his ownership. During the war however, these properties were used as payment and enticement for local Kurds and other Muslims for their contribution to the war and the deportations in specific.\n\nAs the war came to an end and many of the Armenians deported along the Homs-Hama-Damascus route returned to Cilicia, the new owners of these properties were evidently less interested in returning these. A commission was sent from Kostantiniyye to solve the issue and peacefully assist in the restitution of these properties but heavy opposition from the local Muslim residents, boosted by the efforts of local CUP leaders such as Taşçızâ de Abdullah, Kethüdazâde Hüseyin Cemil Bey, Mamat Ağazâde Ali Effendi, the Kurd Hacı Osman Agha and Hafız Şahin Effendi, ultimately forced them to withdraw despite the pleas of the Central Service of Armenian Repatriation. The Armenians in question would ultimately be painted as traitors to the Ottoman Empire, enemies of the state and willing collaborators of the Entente occupation in 1918-1919.\n\nThe Armenian deputies never stopped fighting for restitution however and with their hopes invested in the HIF to finally give them back their land, they have seen in the recent sales of Miri land an opportunity to receive a fair compensation for their losses during the war. Many Muslims deputies however are firmly opposed to these ideas, with members from the OHF often even going as far as saying that this is their reward for the treachery during the war. This has prompted the Armenian deputies to lose their patience with the coalition as their inability to take a decisive stance on the issue has now led to an ultimatum. Either their people are compensated or all Armenians will withdraw from the coalition."
 ottlib.7.a: "We should compensate the Armenians."
 ottlib.7.b: "What Armenian properties?"

 ottlib.8.t: "Conflict in Ainteb"
 ottlib.8.d: "The recent decision of the government to revise the seized properties of Armenian citizens during the Weltkrieg has caused quite the stir in the city of Ainteb, as protests and riots by the Muslim population of the city against these plans have started to escalate once more. As these properties have by now often passed through many hands and with some even converted to industrial sites, the Turks are fighting tooth and nail to keep the imperial inspectors from restoring them to their original Armenian owners.\n\nThe serious backlash the HIF is receiving from the actions has caused them to reconsider once more as various interest groups in Adana and Ainteb are finding support amongst the OHF for their struggle. The Armenian delegation remains steadfast though and insists on the proper return of their land, still threatening to bail from the coalition if their demands aren't met."
 ottlib.8.a: "Give in to the Turks."
 ottlib.8.b: "Give in to the Armenians."

 ottlib.9.t: "Coalition Talks with the DF"
 ottlib.9.d: "Although the centralists have been unable to gain the support necessary to form a workable coalition, we on our own do neither. The DF of Kazim Karabekir forms the key in this debacle as its triumph at the ballots has grown the party substantially to the point that they can now crown themselves kingmaker. Kazim is very well aware of this position and has been playing hardball with our party in an attempt to secure the position of grand vizier for himself.\n\nWith the mind of the Sultan set on our own Sabahattin however, he is now willing to negotiate a coalition. The price is high however as not only the ministries of war and finances would be given to his party but also the ministry of foreign affairs, which would ensure strong influence of his party on nearly all shapes of policy."
 ottlib.9.a: "What choice do we have?"

 ottlib.10.t: "Arab Deputies Withdraw Support"
 ottlib.10.d: "Be it out of personal concerns or due to an overarching shift towards a more nationalist, Arab mindset, multiple Arab parties have announced the end of their support for the coalition and have withdrawn their deputies. Whilst this won't immediately pose much risk to the continuation of the coalition, it is an unfortunate event and it will take time and elbow grease to get them back in line."
 ottlib.10.a: "Most unfortunate."

 ottlib.11.t: "Conservative Deputies Withdraw Support"
 ottlib.11.d: "Be it out of personal concerns or due to discontent with the little attempts undertaken to stop the secularisation of the empire, multiple conservative parties have announced the end of their support for the coalition and have withdrawn their deputies. Whilst this won't immediately pose much risk to the continuation of the coalition, it is an unfortunate event and it will take time and elbow grease to get them back in line."
 ottlib.11.a: "Most unfortunate."

 ottlib.12.t: "Turkish Deputies Withdraw Support"
 ottlib.12.d: "Be it out of personal concerns or due to an overarching shift towards a more nationalist, Turkish mindset, multiple Turkish parties have announced the end of their support for the coalition and have withdrawn their deputies. Whilst this won't immediately pose much risk to the continuation of the coalition, it is an unfortunate event and it will take time and elbow grease to get them back in line."
 ottlib.12.a: "Most unfortunate."

 ottlib.13.t: "Emergency Elections of [GetYear]"
 ottlib.13.d: "With the government no longer capable to support a workable coalition, the Grand Vizier has handed his resignation to the Sultan 4 weeks ago who accepted this and disbanded the Meclis-i-Mebusân. Now 30 days later, the day of the elections is upon us and it seems as if the Grand Vizier has chosen wisely as an increase across the board for his party was noticeable. Especially in the non-Muslim vilayets of the empire, many seem to have embraced his decentralist ideals and the prospects of self-government through the provincial assemblies. Arabs seem to cautiously support him as well as the Ottoman Party for Administrative Decentralisation has officially disbanded and transferred all its deputies over to the HIF."
 ottlib.13.a: "Now onwards with the programme!"

 ottlib.14.t: "Rising Support for the DF"
 ottlib.14.d: "The DF has recently seen a growth in popularity, mainly on the Anatolian periphery, amongst the lower educated population. Usually voting for the policies of Mustafa Kemal, this came as a surprise both in the headquarters of the OHF as the DF. Trying to find an explanation for this phenomenon, some observers have found a connection related to the name of the party itself.\n\nThe party's logo, a galloping white horse, comes from the strong resemblance of the foreign word Demokrat to the Turkish words Demir Kırat, "Iron Kırat". The horse Kırat was a character in popular Turkish legend; it was the horse and trusted companion of Köroğlu, a Robin Hood-type hero who championed the causes of the common people against the oppressive regime. Demokrat and Demir Kırat were often interchanged by the peasantry. Some have pointed out that the peasantry began to view the Democrat Party as the supernatural hero protecting their rights from the detached aristocrats in Kostantiniyye, just as in the folklore."
 ottlib.14.a: "That can't possibly have worked? Right?"

 ottlib.15.t: "Stumbling Economy"
 ottlib.15.d: "The fabulous growth of the Ottoman economy seems to have met its endpoint, as a substantial decline to growth rates across the board are sending shockwaves from Kostantiniyye to Basra. A policy of mass spending, servicing lobbyists and poorly guided monetary management has doubled or even tripled production figures across all sectors but with the treasury going deeper and deeper into the red, many of these factories and farm estates will be forced to close the books if government intervention doesn't arrive.\n\nThe OHF has already embarked on a smear campaign to prove that their programme of a balanced budget and austerity was the only way for the Empire and that this reckless spending is what brought the OPDA down on us in the first place."
 ottlib.15.a: "We need to bail them out!"
 ottlib.15.b: "We have to tread carefully."

 ottlib.16.t: "Rampant Inflation Takes Hold"
 ottlib.16.d: "Unwilling to lose the support of the powerful landowner vote, the government has decided to bail out the troubled estates, which has led to rampant inflation. Agricultural prices are in flux as small farmers fear for the worst. Heavy industry isn't faring much better, as a haphazard plan by the government to keep them open at a loss is only further pushing the economy down as fears of a massive economic recession are on the front page of every newspaper.\n\nForeign companies have started to pull out investments as the lira is descending into a downwards spiral it likely won't escape any time soon."
 ottlib.16.a: "This is a catastrophe!"

 ottlib.17.t: "Formation of Military Cliques"
 ottlib.17.d: "With the monopoly on power by Turkish officers broken, and with concessions to the Provincial Assemblies to determine affairs of the army, there has been an acute increase in the formation of politico-military cliques. Consisting of officers or their family members in regions with stricter regulation and enforcement, these cliques have been working themselves towards a monopoly on power and are establishing as local strongmen in a system which some have been starting to refer to as eerily similar to that of China.\n\nMost prominent of this cliques, is the one centred around Iraqi Musir Yasin al-Hashimi, who has exploited the growing pains of the new system to place friends and family in a variety of position within the Iraqi assemblies, thus securing not just the army but also key positions regarding oil, agriculture and tribal settlement. Whilst a similar monopoly on power has thus far not occurred in Greater Syria, escalating events in Damascus are nonetheless causing great concern in Kostantiniyye."
 ottlib.17.a: "We need a clear separation of mandates!"
 ottlib.17.b: "We should not interfere in local affairs."

 ottlib.18.t: "Trouble on the Euphrates"
 ottlib.18.d: "Conflict has arisen in the Ottoman Parliament today between Kurdish, Arab and Turkish representatives from the flow basin of the Euphrates. With a length of 2735 km and a basin affecting no less than 673 000 km² of our land, the river defines the lives of all on its banks from the city of Basra to deep into Anatolia.\n\nIt's this length that has given rise to lively debate in the parliament as a commission set up in Aleppo to establish clear guidelines on its usage for irrigation, trade and power has found itself in conflict with similar structures set up both up and downstream. In traditional Ottoman Parliamentary fashion, the conflict is not so much about the work done by the commission but rather the sectarian background of its chairman. Its chairman, a Christian from the city of Aleppo, has been deemed unacceptable for the task by the delegation from Elazig who demands the position to be filled by a proud Sunni Turk. Furious debate ensued, which has placed the parliament in a deadlock for days now."
 ottlib.18.a: "The chairman shall be a Sunni, the secretary a Christian..."
 ottlib.18.b: "A Sunni Turk to oversee them!"
 ottlib.18.c: "We should not interfere in local affairs."

 ottlib.19.t: "Reversing Secularisation"
 ottlib.19.d: "Although the ideas of the HIF and Prince Sabahattin in particular were not of sectarian nature, the fears of the OHF seem to be coming true, as the increased participation of the lower classes in Ottoman politics has left the state particularly vulnerable to a steady rise of the Islamist flank. Supported by the powerful Sufi orders such as the Naqshbandi, the clique around Shakib Arslan has seen its power in the Ottoman parliament grow tremendously to great concern of the non-Sunni groups. Whilst the presence of religion in politics is not directly a cause for concern as this was also envisioned by Sabahattin, various minority groups are fearful that Arslan is going to ride a wave of Sunni populism and dismantle the system we have so painstakingly built up."
 ottlib.19.a: "Most concerning."

 ottlib.20.t: "Trouble in the Cabinet"
 ottlib.20.d: "Recent developments in the Chamber of Deputies and amongst the electorate have left the HIF in an especially weak position. Leaning primarily on its coalition partners in the shape of the IMF and the DF, the position of Grand Vizier is coming under fire not just by the opposition but also from within the coalition itself.\n\nRumours have it that the DF is considering a change in government, taking the position of the HIF as leader of the coalition and propelling one of their own figures to the position of Grand Vizier. On the conservative benches, similar ideas are being considered with Arslan more than willing to take the position for himself."
 ottlib.20.a: "Karabekir becomes Grand Vizier."
 ottlib.20.b: "Bring them back in line!"

 ottlib.21.t: "Coup in Baghdad"
 ottlib.21.d: "Although the position of the al-Hashimi family has long been a thorn in our side, not many expected them to break apart the Ottoman Empire. Centred around a clique of officers in the Ottoman Sixth Army, Yasin has today declared the independence of the Republic of Iraq and officially aligned himself with the Arab nationalists in Cairo.\n\nWith the Empire crumbling on all sides, many believe that this act of treason was not done out of a self-proclaimed sense of nationalism but rather as an act of self-preservation as various officials inside the Hashimi administration fear that a post-Ottoman world may not look so kindly on them should they remain by the side of the Porte."
 ottlib.21.a: "Damn you Yasin! You were supposed to destroy the Arab nationalists, not join them!"

 ottlib.22.t: "The Elections of [GetYear]"
 ottlib.22.d: "Much disruption could be observed in the Ottoman capital as the last political campaigns before the elections increased in fervour. Although opposition parties put up a good show, it seems unlikely that they will be able to dent the majority of the ruling coalition. With little incidents reported at the ballot box, it seems that this election will go down in Ottoman history as one of the most peaceful in recent memory."
 ottlib.22.a: "The Liberal Entente increases its lead."

 ottlib.24.t: "Nationalists Celebrate Conquest of Western Thrace"
 ottlib.24.d: "In a resounding testament to resilience and strategic acumen, the Ottoman Empire marks a historic victory with the recovery of Western Thrace from Bulgaria, achieved with the invaluable support of fellow Balkan nations. This triumph is not just a military feat but a symbol of newfound unity and cooperation in the region, sparking nationwide celebrations that transcend borders. The streets of the empire are awash with vibrant parades and the air resonates with the rich melodies of traditional songs, as citizens come together to revel in this moment of shared success. Nationalists, in particular, are filled with an immense sense of pride and joy, viewing this event as a crucial step towards the restoration of the empire's former grandeur and a shining example of what can be achieved through solidarity.\n\nThe conquest of Western Thrace, therefore, stands as a beacon of hope and a catalyst for a future where the Ottoman Empire not only reclaims its lost territories but also fosters lasting peace and cooperation across the Balkans. This momentous occasion is celebrated as a testament to the enduring spirit of the Ottoman people and their unwavering commitment to unity, resilience, and the pursuit of greatness !"
 ottlib.24.a: "There is still so much to take back !"

# SABAHATTIN #

 ottsab.1.t: "The Meclis-i-Mebusân reconvenes"
 ottsab.1.d: "With the government of Prince Sabahattin firmly appointed, the newly elected representatives have also taken up their seats in the Chamber of Deputies. After short speeches by the Sultan and the Grand Vizier, the floor was ceremonially opened. Issues started to come up almost immediately however as deputies from the OHF attacked all points of the new Grand Viziers speech and called his entire programme a disgrace to the Sublime State and therefore the world."
 ottsab.1.a: "Ah, democracy."

 ottsab.2.t: "Reform of the Ottoman Gendarmerie"
 ottsab.2.d: "After the abolition of the Janissary corps in the early 19th century, a variety of military organisations were established to ensure order and stability in the provinces of Rumelia and Anatolia. With the proclamation of the Tanzimat reforms in 1839, these organisations were combined into the Jandarma (Ottoman Gendarmerie).\n\nServing with distinction in Rumelia after the 1908 revolution and on the battlefields in Anatolia during the Weltkrieg, the by then rebranded Umûm Jandarma Kumandanligi (Gendarmerie General Command) had proven its worth and was drastically expanded to the various Arab and Kurdish provinces. One of the issues this brought with it however, and a general complaint from many non-Turkish citizens, was that the gendarmerie (especially in the higher positions) almost solely recruited from Turkish citizens and as such couldn't be counted as a non-discriminatory organisation.\n\nTo solve this issue, the HIF has tabled a proposition to revise recruitment standards and to utilise more Arab manpower in the corps. This has led to protests from Turkish nationalists who see this loosening of standards as a liability and potential threat to the security of the Arab vilayets should revolts escalate."
 ottsab.2.a: "We need a thorough reform of the Jandarma."
 ottsab.2.b: "Just appoint some token Arabs and leave the rest as is."

 ottsab.3.t: "Education of the Jandarma"
 ottsab.3.d: "Throughout the 19th century and the early 20th century, the exact status of the Gendarmerie has often changed with the last decree dating back to 1909 when the organisation was put under the authority of the Ministry of War. Recognising their tremendous success, the corps was massively expanded under the Kemalist regime but retained its close ties to the military which made many in the then opposition believe that as long as the two remained united, the corps couldn't have an unbiased stance. A proposal put forward in 1935, in which their education would be integrated within the War Academy, was just barely refused, but shows once more the intentions of the OHF to create a monopoly on security and defence loyal to their cause.\n\nTo solve this potential threat, the Grand Vizier has proposed the Gendarmerie be detached from the Ministry of War, brought under the Ministry of Interior and their training done separate from the main Ottoman army. Furthermore, he also proposes the creation of Academies in Beirut, Baghdad and Aleppo in an attempt to incorporate more Arabs into the corps."
 ottsab.3.a: "The proposal passes"
 ottsab.3.b: "What a foolish idea"

 ottsab.4.t: "Reorganisation of the Vilayet Law"
 ottsab.4.d: "Based on the ideas of the Tanzimat reformers during the late 19th century with special credit to Midhat Pasha, the old Eyalet system was replaced by a system based around Vilayets, Sanjaks and Kaza's. To mediate issues raised by the minorities that these didn't represent their groups to the fullest, each of these provincial levels was accompanied by an administrative council to assist the walis and kaymakams. In practice however this solution would do little as a combination of corruption, incompetence and the reliance of the vilayets on instructions from the capital would lead to a wide array of issues making them mostly ineffective.\n\nIn an attempt to combat the inefficiency and increase the input of regular citizens in the governing of their immediate surroundings, the councils on the Vilayet level will be expanded into full regional parliaments which will serve under the federal government but have the power and ethno-religious diversity required to effectively cater to the issues posed by the vilayet.\n\nFurthermore:\n\n- The Sanjak level will be abolished to avoid unnecessary administrative bloat but may be reinstated in specific vilayets if the Provincial Assembly deems it necessary.\n\n- The wali or governor will be democratically elected amongst the people of the vilayet and confirmed in his position by the Sultan through Irade.\n\n- Elections for the Provincial Assembly and the wali will be held every 4 years, in between two federal elections."
 ottsab.4.a: "A leap towards the future!"

 ottsab.5.t: "Elections for the Provincial Assembly"
 ottsab.5.d: "Whilst the old administrative councils for the Vilayets already had elections, many are in disagreement with the rules imposed on possible candidates. Only males 30 years of age or older who paid a sum of 150 piastres in direct yearly taxes and who spoke the Ottomanish language were to be considered for a position, and had to be selected by an electoral commission. This commission was made up of the kaza müdürü, the kadi, the mufti, the imam, kaza scribes, and religious leaders of non-Muslim residents. These would present a list of candidates to the next administrative level which would remove 1/3 of the candidates before moving it further up to the next administrative level which would again remove 1/3. The final list would then be used to select council members who would serve the wali for 2 years before new elections were to be held.\n\nThe new system would open elections up to all Ottoman males aged 18 and above with the age of candidacy at 30. Elected members would then directly serve on the provincial assembly. Some of the more progressive parliament members however are requesting that we extend the same rights to women, receiving great opposition from the conservatives who see this as an affront to the Caliph and by extension all of Islam, supported for once in this by their Christian counterparts."
 ottsab.5.a: "Enact women suffrage"
 ottsab.5.b: "Only males can vote"

 ottsab.6.t: "First Provincial Elections"
 ottsab.6.d: "Recently agreed upon in the Meclis-i-Mebusân, the first provincial elections in the history of the Ottoman Empire have gone forwards. The overseeing authorities report that the elections occurred without much incident, although turn-out at first glance seemed to be minimal with many in the Kurdish and Iraqi vilayets not showing up to their booths. Nonetheless all the seats have been filled and the elections have been declared a grand success in the liberal media, declaring the event a turning point in Ottoman history on par with the Tanzimat reforms."
 ottsab.6.a: "Not the greatest of starts... but it shall do for now!"

 ottsab.7.t: "The Iraqi Question"
 ottsab.7.d: "The Vilayets of Iraq (Mosul, Baghdad and Basra) have long proven difficult to govern effectively as due to the limited authority of the walis, relying far too much on direct orders from the capital, and the abysmal revenues. To solve part of these issues and establish a stronger rule over the border provinces, throughout the 19th century multiple requests for the merger of the vilayets into a larger Iraqi unit were refused time upon time to avoid creating a power bloc that could threaten the central government. In 1926 however with the collapse of the British Empire and the re-annexation of Basra & Kuwait, the vilayets of Basra and Baghdad would be united and placed under the discretion of a single wali. Under Yashin Al-Hashimi in 1928, the Mosul wali will furthermore be placed under the command of his Baghdadi colleague, with the Sulaymaniyah region (inhabited by Sunni Kurds) separated.\n\nWith most of Iraq as such brought under a central command structure, many question what is supposed to happen to it now that the Vilayet Law has been revised. Some argue that it should remain a singular bloc to provide a stable frontier against the Persians whilst others believe that due to its relatively large and diverse population, it should be split up into a Sunni and Shiite part both with their own provincial assemblies. The question of the Assyrian people in Basra also remains a sore point, as separating them into a separate entity would please the Assyrians but lead to issues with the large Shiite population."
 ottsab.7.a: "Sulaymaniyah, Mosul, Baghdad, Basra"
 ottsab.7.b: "Sulaymaniyah, Mosul, Baghdad"
 ottsab.7.c: "Mosul, Baghdad"
 ottsab.7.e: "One united Iraq"

 ottsab.8.t: "Trouble in Basra"
 ottsab.8.d: "Trouble has started to brew in Basra as the Assyrian minority feels that it is underrepresented in the Baghdadi Provincial Assembly, and once more demands the creation of an Assyrian autonomous region around the city of Basra. These demands have been met with less than positive reception by the Arab and Turkish population of the region, who fear that a separation of the two vilayets would lead to them becoming a minority within their own homeland, looking wearily at the influence exerted by the Maronites on the Druze people of Mt Lebanon."
 ottsab.8.a: "Separate the Assyrian Autonomous Region"
 ottsab.8.b: "Deny their request"

 ottsab.9.t: "Revision of the Ottoman Civil Code"
 ottsab.9.d: "The civil code we have used since the Tanzimat era or the Mecelle code was first codified in 1877. Based on the Islamic Hanafi legal tradition, the code was the first enforcement of a unified law over all Ottoman citizens who previously according to the Millet system used their own codes.\n\nFor decades this code has remained mostly unchanged, and is in the eyes of many, still an ancient relic of a bygone era. As it is based on Islamic law, many of the reformists have protested against it as they feel that religious law has no place in a modern secular state. Christian and Jewish citizens who previously used their own legal system remain discontent with it as well, and have urged the government to reform if not outright replace the dated code.\n\nFor some however, the issue lies not within the code itself, which is a solid document and perfectly applicable to the (Sunni) Muslim subjects of the empire. They believe the problem is that the non-Muslim subjects are also being tried under it and that instead of enforcing a sharia-based legal system on all citizens, the various communities should be able to govern their own affairs. Therefore they propose to introduce a secular civil code which will deliberately be left abstract so that on the local level, the various Millets can choose to fill in the gaps and govern themselves according to their own traditions and needs.\n\nOthers see in this a catastrophe in the making, as the purpose of the Mecelle in the 19th century was to get rid of the legal complexities and put all citizens under one code of law. They instead propose to introduce a new secular Ottoman civil code which would be used by all citizens - no matter their religion - and which would also make all citizens equal under the law, something that is receiving great support from the benches of the OHF."
 ottsab.9.a: "The Mecelle has served us for 60 years, it will continue to serve for 60 more!"
 ottsab.9.b: "We need a new secular civil code!"
 ottsab.9.c: "All groups should be tried according to their own customs and traditions!"

 ottsab.10.t: "Privatisation of the State Monopolies"
 ottsab.10.d: "Formed in large part during the etatist period between 1920-1931, much of our nation's economy rests in the hands of a few large state companies. As this goes against liberal principles and ruins the possibility for private initiative, the Chamber of Deputies has earlier today voted on their abolition and the privatisation of the market.\n\nThe question remains however to what degree we should open this up to foreign investors as many fear that by ceding control, vital parts of the Ottoman economy could once again fall in the hands of western powers to the detriment of our people. To remedy this potential threat, they propose that only investors with the Ottoman nationality can partake in the process and that foreign companies willing to invest in the market are obligated to utilise Ottoman manpower."
 ottsab.10.a: "The Free Market will not be opposed!"
 ottsab.10.b: "Let us thread carefully here"

 ottsab.11.t: "The TPC Affair"
 ottsab.11.d: "Founded in 1912 as a pooling of assets by Deutsche Bank, Shell, and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, the TPC was granted the concessions to the Kirkuk oil deposits although no exploration could be performed as war broke out in 1914. When the dust settled in 1919, the British shares in the venture were redistributed amongst Ottoman and German investors with the Armenian Calouste Gulbenkian receiving 20% of the total revenue. Oil was first struck on October 14th 1922 near the city of Kirkuk, giving way to the extensive drilling operations later established throughout the region. As interest for the Black Gold by the Ottoman government increased, the government continued to buy out shares and bring the company under its direct authority. The collapse of the German economy in early 1936 further assisted in this effort as in an attempt to salvage its assets in Germany proper, Deutsche Bank agreed to sell its remaining shares to the Ottoman government. Leaving the company as such solely in Turkish and Dutch hands, a number of new concessions were granted. The struggling economy and the lack of personnel to fully benefit from this occasion however has left these unexploited for now.\n\nNow that the government has decided to abolish its state monopolies, some are wondering whether an exception shouldn't be made for the TPC to avoid an important sector of the Ottoman economy falling in foreign hands. Co-founder of the company, Armenian Calouste Gulbenkian has shown his interest in acquiring further shares in the company but it remains questionable whether he will reinvest his profits in the Ottoman economy, instead moving back to Europe."
 ottsab.11.a: "TPC will remain owned by the state"
 ottsab.11.b: "Sell. Sell. Sell"

 ottsab.12.t: "Organisation of the Armed Forces"
 ottsab.12.d: "With the decentralisation of the empire well underway, a question has arisen as to what should befall the Ottoman army. Turkish decentralists firmly oppose dividing it in smaller parts because they claim it would reduce its striking potential and would complicate affairs in times of war. Furthermore, it could lead to different training standards, linguistic difficulties between various regiments and possibly even the creation of a warlord-esque situation should one of the constituents decide that it has had enough of Ottoman rule.\n\nArab decentralists on the other hand complain about the strongly Turkified upper crust of the officer corps, and the inability for Arab soldiers to serve solely in Arab provinces, under Arab commanders. Furthermore, they are afraid that should the army remain a centralised affair, the Turks would be able to use it to repress civilian discontent with the government and that a powerful Turkish general, such as Fevzi Pasha, could use this to enforce a military dictatorship and revert the changes made."
 ottsab.12.a: "It is vital that the army remains intact"
 ottsab.12.b: "The army will be decentralised"

 ottsab.13.t: "Abolition of the Meclis-i Ayan"
 ottsab.13.d: "The Meclis-i Ayan, or Upper House of the Ottoman Parliament, was created in 1876 as part of the Ottoman constitution and mostly served as a way for the Sultan to influence politics, as the appointment of senators relied heavily on the support granted by the Sultan. This ensured a stable and loyal inner circle that could stop drastic reforms if the need should ever arise. The expansion of the bureaucratic apparatus on the provincial level however, has increased expenditures exponentially which has led many to wonder what even the need is of an Upper House.\n\nTherefore with the approval of the Meclis-i Mebusan earlier today, the Ottoman constitution was revised and the institution abolished. With this royal safeguard gone however, some are starting to have second thoughts and wondering if by doing so they haven't opened up the way towards the abolition of the monarchy and the proclamation of a republic."
 ottsab.13.a: "Another step forwards!"

 ottsab.14.t: "Arabs Demand More Representation in the Armed Forces"
 ottsab.14.d: "Launched by a group of Syrian and Iraqi officers, a campaign was organised to demand more Arab representation in the upper levels in the military. Currently almost solely inhabited by Turks, many of which from the Balkans, the Arabs demand equal representation and more general positions for Arab officers. Furthermore, they also demand that the Müsirs (Field Marshals) of the Syrian, Hejazi and Iraqi armies always be Arab and that their actions are scrutinised more carefully by their provincial assemblies."
 ottsab.14.a: "Accept their demands"
 ottsab.14.b: "What a bunch of bogus"

 ottsab.15.t: "Expansion of the Vilayet Reforms"
 ottsab.15.d: "Whilst many were content with the changes brought to the Vilayet law, some believe that they don't go far enough. Especially in regions inhabited by large groups of minorities, there is a certain desire to have an institution separate from the provincial assemblies that only serves their own minority group. Based on the Millet system for religion, they ask that these are expanded and split up in more groups to better represent the inter-denominational tapestry of our nation. Especially within the Muslim category this has proven problematic as Sunnis, Shiites, Alevi, etc. are all combined under one category without respect to their individual beliefs or languages.\n\nSupport for this expansion however is minuscule at best as outside of the underrepresented groups themselves, few want to grant extra rights to those groups. Especially the question of the Shiites is problematic as since their religion does not recognise the Ottoman Caliph as the supreme head of Islam, they believe that the Shiites have no right to demand further autonomy. Should the Shiites however be willing to recognise this position, then further discussion can be held."
 ottsab.15.a: "Expand the Millet system"
 ottsab.15.b: "This doesn't seem like a very good idea"

 ottsab.16.t: "The Question of the Millets"
 ottsab.16.d: "With the proclamation of the new Ottoman Civil Code which guarantees total equality for all citizens under a secular law, some are starting to see the existence of the Millet system as unnecessary. They insist that due to local representation through the provincial assemblies is already guaranteed for all religious groups, the Millets can be dissolved with their previous tasks and responsibilities ported over to these newly created institutions.\n\nSome of the leading figures in the various Millets have agreed with this line of thought, but others still fear that this guarantee isn't enough, and that without the protection of their religious institutions, only (Sunni) Islam will be able express itself openly. On the Greek Islands the situation is seen as less of an issue, although objections to the existence of a secular code in the first place, has led to minor protests throughout the region. The Armenian patriarch has agreed with the idea, but in return demands that the full autonomy of the Armenian community in Armenia proper is guaranteed."
 ottsab.16.a: "Abolish the Millets"
 ottsab.16.b: "Let's not do anything too hastily"

 ottsab.17.t: "Trouble in the Armed Forces"
 ottsab.17.d: "With decentralisation fully underway, trouble seems to be brewing amongst the Turkish officers who fear that by conceding so much power to the minorities, the integrity and defensibility of the Empire becomes problematic. Convinced that there are fifth columns within many of these groups, notably the Armenians, Greeks, Assyrians and Shiites, they are trying to push back against the reforms and bring control back into the hands of the Turks.\n\nInspired by Turkish nationalist thought, they see the plans of the Grand Vizier as a direct threat to the Turkish people and are less than amused by his attempts to restrict their influence on both politics and the various security organisations.\n\nConversing with many ex-generals and shifting around various divisions and officers, trouble seems to be brewing and should the situation escalate it may lead rather soon to a military coup."
 ottsab.17.a: "Most troubling"

 ottsab.18.t: "Raid on the Sublime Porte"
 ottsab.18.d: "Discontent by the path of the liberal government and concerned by the risks posed by their reforms to the integrity of the Ottoman nation, the 2nd division of the First Army has executed a coup earlier today, arresting the Grand Vizier and his ministers during the morning. In what some call a repeat of the 'Raid on the Sublime Porte' just before the Weltkrieg, the armed forces under the command of Field Marshal Fevzi Pasha have through this action effectively taken control over the capital. With communication lines cut to the hinterland, many are now wondering what future awaits them. Sultan [OTT.GetLeader] has for now not yet taken an official stance concerning the events, preferring to wait the storm out fearful that his own position may be on the line."
 ottsab.18.a: "What is happening?"

 ottsab.19.t: "Sultan [OTT.GetLeader] Flees the Capital"
 ottsab.19.d: "Smuggled aboard a small fishing ship and with the assistance of his aides, the old Sultan has escaped the tightening grip executed by the nationalists on the capital. By losing this significant asset, chaos is starting to spread through the ranks of the plotters as fears of organised loyalist resistance in the hinterland of Anatolia are likely to torpedo the entire operation.\n\nOther members of the royal family have been detained in their villas and palaces for the time being, whilst dedicated nationalist elements have been tasked with finding the Sultan no matter the cost. Second in line to the throne and hero of the Weltkrieg, Osman Fuad Effendi has seemingly also escaped the capital which will likely further complicate the attempted coup. Throughout the Mashriq little action is being performed as all wait tentatively for a decisive winner in the struggle although a variety of Islamist adherents have expressed their anger towards the imprisonment of the Sultan-Caliph."
 ottsab.19.a: "Bring. Me. [OTT.GetLeader]. Now!"

 ottsab.20.t: "Osman Fuad Gathers His Forces"
 ottsab.20.d: "Fleeing to nearby Bursa, the royal Prince has started to gather his troops in preparation of the liberation of the capital. Benefitting from the prestige that accompanies the House of Osman and his valiant actions during the Weltkrieg, the popular prince is quickly assembling a force to bring the fight to the nationalists. Over in the capital, uncertainty and desertion is spreading as none were expecting a drawn out struggle and were hoping to execute a quick and decisive coup."
 ottsab.20.a: "This wasn't the plan..."

 ottsab.21.t: "Osman Fuad Marches on Constantinople"
 ottsab.21.d: "Backed by a variety of loyalist divisions from Western and Central Anatolia, the warrior prince has finally made his move. Taking position on the Eastern side of the Bosporus, an ultimatum was sent earlier today to Field Marshal Fevzi Pasha to lay down his arms and disband his forces. Outnumbered, outgunned, outclassed and with no chance of victory, the Marshal accepted at 5.26pm.\n\nA German submarine patrolling in the Black Sea would ultimately prevent the capture of all officers associated with the coup as through this channel they were able to flee to the Kaiserreich. Demands for their extradition have promptly been issued to the German government but have yet remained unanswered."
 ottsab.21.a: "German dogs!"

 ottsab.22.t: "Restoration of the HIF Cabinet"
 ottsab.22.d.sabahattin: "With the military threat dealt with, the cabinet of Prince Sabahattin has been reinstated in [TUR.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] and parliament has reopened. A variety of Turkish nationalists parties and deputies, held responsible for the failed coup, have been disbanded and arrested. The position of the HIF, strengthened by the defeat of their opponents on the field of battle, has now never been stronger as many opposed to their programmes are now remaining silent to avoid persecution, arrest and possibly even death."
 ottsab.22.d.karabekir: "With the military threat dealt with, the cabinet of Kazim Karabekir has been reinstated in [TUR.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] and parliament has reopened. A variety of Turkish nationalists parties and deputies, held responsible for the failed coup, have been disbanded and arrested. The position of the DF, strengthened by the defeat of their opponents on the field of battle, has now never been stronger as many opposed to their programmes are now remaining silent to avoid persecution, arrest and possibly even death."
 ottsab.22.a: "Onwards we march!"

 ottsab.23.t: "Unification Decree Repealed"
 ottsab.23.d: "The dreaded Unification and Co-education act was destroyed in parliament earlier today. The decree, a testament of OHF intentions to reform the state into a secular and modern society, was seen by many conservatives as an insult to Islam itself whilst many liberals saw in its centralisation programme an attack on the Millet system and the initiative of private individuals. With its abolition, the liberal coalition now hopes to both favour its support base amongst the non-Muslim communities and throw a bone to the conservative Islamists, on whom a lot of their support in the Chamber of Deputies stands."
 ottsab.23.a: "We march on without turning back."

 ottsab.24.t: "The Future of Ottomanism"
 ottsab.24.d: "Ottomanism, or the idea that all citizens identify with a shared Ottoman identity above their regional subgroups such as Turk, Arab, etc., has been one of the most influential ideas within the Empire since the early 19th Century. Far before the Young Turks took control after the constitutional revolution, the Young Ottomans were a group of reformers in the latter half of the 19th century that attempted to foster this identity, seeing in it the solution to the rise of nationalism amongst their subjects.\n\nThe idea in practice however remained mostly unsuccessful as the various Christian groups never accepted it as their own, and pan-Islamism turned out to be a far more effective way to keep the Arabs and Kurds in check. The subsequent loss of massive swathes of Ottoman territory starting in the 1870s further caused great harm to the ideal, as with the losses incurred during the First Balkan War, the Christian group found itself greatly reduced. The idea, at first held highly by the Young Turks, quickly lost prominence as in its place nationalism rose. Greek nationalists, Armenian nationalists, Arab nationalists and even Turkish nationalists all had conflicting opinions on the future of the empire and through their actions the hopes for an Ottoman identity free from religion have been almost completely shattered.\n\nNonetheless, the idea never disappeared and with the Young Turks shifting more and more towards Muslim nationalism, the liberal opposition used it as their counterproposal to an ever stricter policy. With Prince Sabahattin now in charge, the idea has returned to the forefront as his ideas of a heavily decentralised empire want to encourage a unified Ottoman identity above regional identification. Whether this policy is realistic though is far less certain, as many important sociologists have pointed out that the turning point has already been crossed and that a radical change in education policy to account for this identity would run opposite to the idea of a decentralised policy."
 ottsab.24.a: "Interesting."

 ottsab.25.t: "The Power of Pan-Islamism"
 ottsab.25.d: "Harking back to the origins of Islam itself, the idea of pan-Islamism was brought back to the forefront by the Ottoman sultans in the late 18th century, to exert influence over the Muslim subjects of the Czar, and to provide a metaphorical glue to the citizens of the Porte.\n\nAs the Kaiser saw in the Porte the ultimate ally to weaponise Islam and point it at his rivals, the Germans focused their efforts in the Ottoman Empire on developing and spreading this ideology in the hopes of bringing it to completion when war with the French broke out once more. Unleashing hordes of angry Muslims (German estimates were talking of hundreds of millions of rebels rising in unison), a circle of Orientalist figures close to the Kaiser saw one key figure in this entire plan: the Sultan-Caliph of the Ottoman Empire. Through German influence in Turkish statecraft and the education of its new elite, centred primarily on the armed forces, the Caliph adopted it as his own and used it himself to rein in disloyal elements.\n\nAfter the fall of Abdulhamid II in the 1908 revolution and with the ascendance of a new regime that wished to pursue a more secular path, the Germans did not give up and as the reality of the situation started to sink in, the CUP ultimately started to openly pursue an Islamic ideology. War arrived on the shores of the Dardanelles in 1915 and the call for Jihad was launched shortly after... to little success. The grand romantic scheme of the Kaiser, in which through his puppet Caliph he would be able to unleash an unstoppable tide on his enemies, bore little fruits. The idea wasn't forgotten however, rather doubled down upon, as through the network set up by Von Oppenheim and his associates various schools, forums and teachers were sent out to all corners of the world to awaken a spirit of resistance and solidarity for the Caliph.\n\nThe largest success story of pan-Islamism can be found amongst the Muslim subjects of the Mashriq, as it ensured a degree of loyalty to the Sultan throughout the Weltkrieg that would likely have been greatly reduced without the efforts of various Islamist groups. This has brought with it however a large price, as promoting Muslim solidarity makes it hard to secularise the state and limit the influence of the faith on matters of state. Furthermore, the Islamist rhetoric has spread to Egypt after the end of the war where in the young nation, it found fertile ground to further develop its ideas and if necessary use them against both Sultan and Kaiser."
 ottsab.25.a: "Disturbing."

 ottsab.26.t: "Violence in Bursa"
 ottsab.26.d: "The ancient capital of the Ottoman Empire, the city of Bursa is located in an ethnically fairly diverse region close to the capital. Nonetheless a Turkish core with strong loyalties to Islam lives in and around the city which has caused us issues in the past when more liberal ideas reached the table.\n\nA protest action organised by the 'Brothers of Muhammed' to fight the government on their leniency towards secularists and the increase of power enjoyed by the minorities escalated earlier today as a detachment of the Gendarmerie was forced to intervene to protect various Greek and Armenian shops and their assets. Outraged and convinced that the government through this clearly showed that they favour heathens over Muslims, they only became more aggressive. Ultimately the Gendarmerie was forced to open fire, killing 4 and wounding two dozen more. Faced with overpowering firepower, the protest quickly disintegrated, but the event has left a scar for many Muslims in the region that will be hard to heal."
 ottsab.26.a: "Most troubling."

 ottsab.27.t: "Protests in Konya and Mosul"
 ottsab.27.d: "Be it out of sympathy for their brethren in Bursa, similar protests shook Konya and Mosul this week as opposition amongst the Muslims against the Grand Vizier keeps mounting. The Vizier nonetheless has made sure to entertain the people of [TUR.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] with public displays of piety to ward off any nay-sayers and seems to have switched his usual rhetoric up with more references to Islam.\n\nWhilst politicians have always been forced to be careful when it comes to matters of religion, most notably under Grand Vizier Mustafa Kemal who was infamous for his less than ideal remarks on the subject, the situation seems to have become even more inflammable due to the events in Jerusalem. Pan-Islamism, the weapon of both Abdulhamid II and the CUP, now seems to be turning itself against the institutions of power instead of protecting them..."
 ottsab.27.a: "We will have to tread carefully."

 ottsab.28.t: "Turkish Nationalists Open Their Offensive"
 ottsab.28.d: "Keenly aware of the escalating situation in the office of the Grand Vizier, the Turkish nationalists have embarked on a full offensive against the HIF and its leader. Blaming them for the economic recession, insinuating that his horse is more pious than himself and openly questioning the policies of the Grand Vizier, the speeches and pamphlets have been eagerly diffused by the various newspapers and media outlets associated with the old OHF.\n\nWhilst the inherent hypocrisy of these remarks - coming from a wing of parliament which has done nothing but advocate for secularisation these last few years - is striking, their words are greatly damaging the reputation of the Vizier whose position within the coalition is becoming more fragile by the day."
 ottsab.28.a: "We might have to discuss a replacement..."

 ottsab.29.t: "Conservatives Issue an Ultimatum"
 ottsab.29.d: "A group of conservative deputies, primarily from Anatolia, have announced a full withdrawal of their support for the Grand Vizier earlier today and are demanding his immediate replacement if the coalition is to survive. Their declaration has been met with renewed trust from various Christian and other non-Muslim deputies, only further throwing oil on the fire that has by now completely overtaken the party.\n\n[OTT.GetLeader] has in response called the Grand Vizier for an audience to discuss the situation which has by many been interpreted as a signal that royal support for the Prince may be faltering. Newspapers published by nationalists and Kemalist veterans are eating their heart out as the drama continues to grow. An attempt by the Grand Vizier to shut down some of these papers was met with opposition from the other side of the floor, with many of the coalition partners objecting to this proposed press censorship."
 ottsab.29.a: "This is going from bad to worse..."

 ottsab.30.t: "[OTT.GetLeader] Sacks Prince Sabahattin"
 ottsab.30.d: "In response to the escalating situation in the Chamber of Deputies, Prince Sabahattin officially handed over his resignation to the Sultan to meet the demands of dissidents within the party and protests in cities all across the Empire. Convinced that only through the appointment of a conservative deputy the situation can be fixed, the Sultan furthermore announced that Shakib Arslan from the Mt Lebanon region will take over from the Prince. Being one of the key figures in the Islamist movement and coming from a non-Turkish family, many hope that this will cater to both of those trouble groups and reaffirm the position of the coalition."
 ottsab.30.a: "Good luck Shakib."

 ottsab.31.t: "Flourishing Coffee House Culture"
 ottsab.31.d: "An old tradition of many Ottoman men, the habit of enjoying a cup of coffee with friends and acquaintances is flourishing as never before. Much like the Parisian cafés impacted the development of social thought and the arts in French culture, these houses serve as a gathering point for the Ottoman cultural elite to discuss and ponder about the issues of life, the empire and the finer arts. Whilst not all products of this are positive, complaints from many a Wali about the laziness and bad influence these places have on work ethic are almost a daily occurrence in Kostantiniyye, they are a testament of a more open and free Ottoman society."
 ottsab.31.a: "Can I get another cup?"

 ottsab.32.t: "Trouble in Eastern Anatolia"
 ottsab.32.d: "Ruled by Aghas and Sheiks, many of the Kurds have been embracing the turn to decentralisation with open arms. There exists however a rift between the Kurds actually living in Kurdistan and those defending their cause in the capital. The metropolitan Kurds, for the most part united in their organisation Kurdistan Ta'ali wa Taraqi Jamiyad (The Society for the Rise and Progress of Kurdistan), envision a Kurdistan free from the yoke of religion with political freedom and development rivalling that of the rest of the Ottoman Empire, but don't seem to realise that the situation on the ground is vehemently opposed to this. The Aghas and Sheikhs, who have been involved in a seemingly eternal civil war between each other, are fighting tooth and nail against the plans of the government to put power into the hands of the urban Kurds. Influenced by the Sufi orders, most notably the Naqshbandi, many of the Sheikhs have steered their tribes into open conflict with Kostantiniyye in an attempt to hold on to their power.\n\nFailed rebellion after failed rebellion, Kurdistan is slowly but surely being 'liberated' from its backwardness although many are questioning whether the cost of human life and the clear opposition of the Kurdish ruling class shouldn't be a sign to leave the region alone."
 ottsab.32.a: "They will be grateful in the end!"

 ottsab.33.t: "Declining Social Mobility & Centralisation of Land Ownership"
 ottsab.33.d: "For most of the history of our empire, land ownership was built on a system of common land which was either owned by the state and then leased to farmers who paid a tax for its use, or owned by a certain tribal federation. Whilst this had the significant disadvantage that those toiling on the fields often had little desire to increase the fertility of the land or put in much effort in general, it ensured that there were ultimately little large landowners. Reforms, started already back in the 19th century in part to encourage a more sedentary lifestyle for the still nomadic tribes, have changed this concept into one where land registration became the order of the day, and where previous common land was in rapid succession claimed by certain individuals and families, as such creating a powerful caste of land owners. Iraq and the Kurdish regions have been hit hardest by this as various tribal figures exchanged their pastoral lifestyle for the bustling cities, claiming all land previously owned by the entire tribe as their own. A massive caste of farmers through these actions became landless almost overnight and with little other choice either moved through the cities, causing trouble for the already stretched amenities of these regions, or remained on the land and became subjects of a modern form of serfdom.\n\nWith a massive push on 'self-initiative', 'decentralisation' and catering to their main electoral base, - the landowners - reforms by the liberal coalition have only aggravated the situation, leading to increased support by the impoverished lower classes for the grand aims of land reform heralded by the OHF and the rising socialist parties in the Empire. Not only is this causing a shift in the political landscape towards a more ostensibly radical point of view, revenues have seen substantial drops as well, due to widespread corruption on the provincial level and the refusal by many groups to pay their share of dues to the treasury in Kostantiniyye."
 ottsab.33.a: "A powder keg in the making..."

 ottsab.34.t: "Foundation of the Arab Organisation for Education and Development"
 ottsab.34.d: "Building on the loosened restrictions imposed on education curricula and with the timid acceptance of the government for various ethnic and linguistic groups in the empire to preserve their own cultures under the umbrella of Ottomanism, a variety of Arab intellectuals announced the creation of the AOED earlier this week in Beirut. The city, already serving as the modern capital of the Arab community in our empire, lies closely to Mt Lebanon wherein the founders of the organisation will extend an olive branch to the Maronites.\n\nStarting with limited resources, the network has opened its first schools in Beirut, Jerusalem, Haifa and Aleppo, with hopes to extend this further into Greater Syria and Iraq. Furthermore, there are talks with the government to offer more Arab courses and subjects in the universities of Damascus and Beirut, but the central ministry for education has so far not promised anything. Many Iraqi teachers and notables have furthermore embraced the ideas behind the organisation, but fears of further Syrian dominance in the Mashriq have caused many to prefer creating a similar organisation than unite with Beirut."
 ottsab.34.a: "A most joyous occasion!"

 ottsab.35.t: "Federal Education Reform"
 ottsab.35.d: "Although the Unification and Coeducation Act was deservedly cast aside by our government, there has nonetheless been a group of reformers who see great harm in the complete abandonment of central education standards. They fear not so much for matters like language, religion or customs but rather technical expertise both on a university and lower level. To remedy what they see as a massive shortage, they therefore propose the creation of several federal education institutes to complement the local ones, who are subject to the Provincial Assemblies.\n\nAt these schools, in their writings referred to as Imperial Institutes of Technology, students would be subjected to a secular and science based programme supervised by the federal assembly. Furthermore, these schools would also offer practical educations for teachers, maintenance crew and even farmers in the hope that these will then distribute their acquired knowledge to the people in their hometowns once they return. Much protest from the conservative wing has however been heard surrounding the secular nature of these schools, depicting the institutes as a thinly veiled attempt to indoctrinate its students to then spread the message of heresy to their friends and family."
 ottsab.35.a: "A splendid idea!"
 ottsab.35.b: "The Federal level should under no circumstance interfere with local affairs!"

 ottars.1.t: "Arslan Reshuffles the Cabinet"
 ottars.1.d: "Claiming to cleanse the cabinet of trouble figures and restore public faith in the government, Arslan has embarked on a long journey to replace many of the older liberal elites with figures from the Islamist movement. Little resistance has been put up by the liberal coalition partners as fears of a complete collapse of the coalition have kept them quiet.\n\nThe intentions of the Grand Vizier are however quite clear and his multi-step programme to restore the importance of faith has already sent waves through the Chamber of Deputies. Multiple walis have also been recalled to Kostantiniyye as their 'questionable' loyalties make it hard to enforce his policy."
 ottars.1.a: "A small price to pay..."

 ottars.2.t: "Islamic Reading Rooms"
 ottars.2.d: "As part of the German mission to spread Pan-Islamism, Max von Oppenheim set up a massive network of reading rooms and propaganda centres to reinforce faith in the Caliph and promote the importance of the holy duties of every Muslim to answer his call for Jihad. Whilst not the resounding success that the Germans had hoped it would be, the rooms nonetheless contributed to the rise of pan-Islamism in the empire, and reinforced Arab loyalty to the Caliph. As the war came to an end and the German mission returned home, most of these propaganda centres were shut down as financial support for the operations was withdrawn by the German Empire.\n\nArslan, himself a close friend of many German and Turkish agents during the war, has in an attempt to further bolster his Islamist movement, reopened these organisations and has set aside extra assets for Islamist organisations."
 ottars.2.a: "A great initiative!"

 ottars.3.t: "The First Islamic Congress"
 ottars.3.d: "Working together with various Islamist thinkers from across the Muslim world, the Grand Vizier has embarked on a new project to bring all Muslim groups together. The World Islamic Congress, the first of hopefully many, will be a gathering of all intelligentsia, both Islamist and nationalist, to strive for the liberation of the still repressed Muslims of the Maghreb and to promote unity within the Ummah.\n\nWhilst it remains unclear whether the Grand Vizier intends this organisation to be against or in favour of the German Empire, with whom he has close ties, many of the old Ottoman special agents and their supporters from Morocco to Bengal have accepted the invitation."
 ottars.3.a: "We are all brothers here."

 ottars.4.t: "Renovation and Rejuvenation Programme"
 ottars.4.d: "As the Ottoman Empire decayed during the 18th and 19th Century, many of our places of worship withered away. From the Holy Sites in Jerusalem to the tomb of the great Saladdin or the mosque of Diyarbakir, spending has primarily gone to the military and the construction of Western infrastructure and the purchase of Western goods. Furthermore, the previous governments have held strongly to the idea that deficit spending should be prevented at all cost and have shown that they would rather protect their own interests than fulfil their duty towards our heritage and the legacy of Islam.\n\nDrafted up by the Arslan cabinet, an ambitious plan has been unfolded today with the support of the Caliph to pump resources into a 'rejuvenation' programme to show that the light of Islam hasn't faded and to show the people that it still governs according to the Laws of the Prophet."
 ottars.4.a: "A grand idea!"

 ottars.5.t: "The New Ottoman Curriculum"
 ottars.5.d: "Fiercely opposed to the idea that religious education should take a backseat to the sciences, the education ministry has revised the complete Ottoman curriculum and has inserted various traditional ideas and obligatory Islamic classes. Whilst the non-Muslims remain mostly free from this due to their own protected forms of education, all Muslims from Ankara to Medina are now being ensured that they receive the guidance of this new narrative, which shows direct links between religion and Muslim greatness, shows that Western civilisation has prospered because of their dedication to Christianity and attempts to teach students that service to the Caliph and Islam in general is the highest virtue one can achieve.\n\nNonetheless, Arslan's ideas do not condemn all forms of modernisation, and they do not refute that which science has proven. He speaks out against imitation of the West but recognises that there are lessons to be learned from them and that virtue and dedication are all that is necessary to propel the entire Islamic civilisation forwards."
 ottars.5.a: "A grand idea!"

 ottars.6.t: "The Position of the Şeyhülislam"
 ottars.6.d: "The role of the Şeyhülislam can best be understood as the Grand Mufti of all Muslims within the Ottoman Empire. Residing over the Ulama, he is responsible for the writing of fatwas and ensure order and discipline within the religious hierarchy making him only second to the Caliph himself. Nonetheless his power was greatly hindered during the CUP regime as he was reduced to a tool to dweep the masses and write out the call for Jihad whilst his position on the Imperial Cabinet was taken away and control by the Young Turks over the religious hierarchy sharpened.\n\nMany conservative forces saw these actions as an insult against both the office and the importance of Islam in Ottoman society. Further reductions in power of the office of the Caliph itself further encountered disappointement, anger and frustration as they saw these deeds not as positive for the overall administration of the Empire but an attempt to sacrifice tradition and authenticity for cheap imitation of the West. Many in the Islamist movement, whereunder Arslan himself furthermore believe that religion does still play an important role in Western society and that it is just because of their shared Christian beliefs and their dedication to them that they have been able to outclass the Muslims. They believe that the attempts by the West to impose their set of rules on our society are done out of religious reasons and that their sole goal is the ultimate victory of the Cross over the Crescent.\n\nThe cabinet, inspired by Western governmental forms and occupied by those educated along Western standards and knowledge is thus in dire need of spiritual guidance and a system of checks and balances to ensure they can not abolish what is sacred. As the Caliph, for now, is barred by the constitution from directly intervening, the Şeyhülislam works without this framework and should thus be restored to his original pre-CUP position. Church and State should not be separate as it is their unison that has led to our greatest victories and our renouncement of Islamic values that has led to our demise. No more!"
 ottars.6.a: "A wise decision of our Grand Vizier."

 ottars.7.t: "Revising the Constitution"
 ottars.7.d: "When the Ottoman constitution first went into effect in 1876 as the summum of the Tanzimat reforms, it for the first time in Ottoman history tried to ground the power of the Sultan. Nonetheless the constitution did not account for Sultan Abdulhamid II who after just 2 years used the executive powers he still had according to the document to prorogue parliament and greatly hinder the rights and duties granted by it. In 1908 when the Young Turk revolution was able to dislodge the tyrant from his throne, it was restored in full but this new group of reformers had learned their lesson. The great powers of the Sultan were toned down greatly, his status reduced to that of a constitutional monarch and a parliament formed that would take over almost all forms of government.\n\nThe CUP however soon came to realise that in the great diversity and political chaos of the empire, a strong central figure with tremendous power could be useful to shut down possible opposition. By employing a weak and unambitious monarch for their goals, they reasoned that they would have the executive power of an absolute monarch whilst being able to do as they saw fit. Slowly returning power to the position of the Sultan, their plan worked marvellously for Sultan Mehmet V who was smart enough not to oppose the real ruling figures. They had however not accounted for Vahdettin who with these powers was able to rid himself of the CUP grasp and rule as he saw fit with his allies in the liberal coalition.\n\nThe death of Vahdettin in 1926 and his succession by the more timid Abdulmecid II allowed much of this power to be shackled once more to a parliamentary body but still allowed him the freedom to appoint a Grand Vizier, declare war and serve as the supreme commander of the Ottoman army. The ageing Sultan never saw much reason to use these powers, very well aware of the threat the military establishment poses to his own position if he should but Ahmed IV, heir to the throne, seems to have inherited less of his wisdom and has shown interest in the designs by the conservatives to continually shift power back to the office of the Caliph.\n\nAs Parliament continues to prove an issue in this regard, the conservatives are now pushing for the restoration of the right to prorogue parliament without its permission and as such give the Sultan the power to push through the necessary reforms without parliamentary oversight."
 ottars.7.a: "Why shouldn't the Sultan be able to enact his own reforms?"

 ottars.8.t: "Sultan Ahmed IV Prorogues Parliament"
 ottars.8.d: "At the request of the Grand Vizier, Sultan Ahmed IV has today called for the prorogation of parliament. Frequently used by Abdulhamid II to rid himself of parliamentary interference, this is a worrying step as it is the first clear sign that the Caliph will attempt to take back power in his own hands with the assistance of his Islamist and Royalist support base. Others are however saying that this is an unnecessary worry and that the Sultan has solely taken this decision to better prepare for the elections later this year. Recent changes of leadership within the liberal coalition and the growing foreign threat do give some reasoning for this move but the decision to limit military training exercises and the decision to send some pronounced opposition members to positions abroad does little to hide the true intentions of the Caliph."
 ottars.8.a: "Most worrying."

 ottars.9.t: "Handling the Armed Forces"
 ottars.9.d: "Within the leadership of our grand army, many have been educated by German or French tutors and have as such inherited some of their modern Western values and ideas on a stable society. This brings with it however also the absurd idea that traditions are just there to be discarded, behaviour we will no longer tolerate. This treachery to the Caliph runs deep in the military establishment though and we will have to revise the entire structure from the ground up to ensure that they can no longer prove a threat to the position of the monarchy.\n\nTo block possible opposition from the existing cadre, training exercises have been halted and many of those with ties to the old CUP of the more recent OHF have either been sent abroad or placed under strict scrutiny from our agents. Not all of them seem to be folding as easily though as reports of former CUP members fleeing the capital in the midst of the night have started to trickle in."
 ottars.9.a: "Cut the head of the snake!"

 ottars.10.t: "Dealing with the Emancipation Movement"
 ottars.10.d: "Originating from the era of the constitutional revolution and expanding massively during the Weltkrieg, Anatolia has seen a growing emancipation movement that demanded changes to the old strict rules of the Sharia enforced laws and greater personal freedom. Under the rule of Vahdettin during the '20s, some of their demands were met as education for females was expanded drastically and more professions were opened up to them. Although not going as far as the OHF would have liked, with universal suffrage and the ability for women to enter politics, these reforms by the Caliph of all people were seen with horror by many conservatives who saw in this nothing but an attack on the values of Islam.\n\nWith power now, be it temporarily, shifted towards the Caliph and with Ahmed IV a lot more amenable to meeting the demands of his conservative support base, the time has come to reverse these policies and ensure that the values professed by the Holy Book are back in place. Furthermore, the decadent media outlets that allow these women to express their opposition to the faith, should be shut down immediately to avoid their message from infecting even more true Muslims."
 ottars.10.a: "The place of the woman is subservient to that of the man!"

 ottars.11.t: "Coup d'État in Kostantiniyye"
 ottars.11.d: "[TUR_arslan_coup_fevzi_status], the army has today stormed Dolmabahçe Palace and the Sublime Porte to retake control over the government. Sultan Ahmed IV has been put under house arrest as the cabinet of Arslan and many Islamist figures were immediately transferred to an undisclosed military prison where they are sure to be met by a military tribunal.\n\nChaos is taking hold across the vast empire as another regime change, so close to the last one is making every last semblance of political stability in the Porte seem removed. With all media brought under direct control of the military establishment now and several orders to arrest highly placed military officers to remove the possibility of the Islamists to regain control, it seems that the junta led by Fevzi Pasha himself is here to stay."
 ottars.11.a: "What will the future bring?"

 TUR_arslan_coup_fevzi_exiled: "In spite of exile following their failed coup, it appears that Fevzi Pasha and his conspirators still have plenty of supporters in the Ottoman army. Led by the formerly Fevzi-led 42nd Ottoman division"
 TUR_arslan_coup_fevzi_marshal: "Launched by Field Marshal Fevzi Pasha together with the 42nd Ottoman division"

 ottars.12.t: "Death of [OTT.GetLeader]"
 ottars.12.d: "Suffering from a stroke after visiting an orphanage near Bursa, the old Sultan was rushed off to Kostantiniyye for medical assistance. By the time he arrived however, the damage was already done and the wise Caliph had taken his last breath.\n\nA standing symbol of the democratic rule in the Ottoman Empire, the Sultan was one of the last obstacles left for the Pan-Islamist ambition to restore the full power of the Caliph. Although many point out that this was solely because he knew from experience how the army would react to such an authoritarian move, he nonetheless kept extremism at bay with his hands-off approach to governing.\n\nAhmed IV, a younger and less steadfast man, will take over for him and continue to steer the Porte through these turbulent times. "
 ottars.12.a: "Good luck Ahmed IV."

# ECONOMIC REFORMS #

 otteco.1.t: "The Ottoman Economy in [GetYear]: Aftermath of the Infamous Decade"
 otteco.1.d: "When the dust settled in 1920 and there finally came an end to almost a decade of non-stop war, the economy of the Ottoman Empire lay in tatters. The manufacturing economy which had seen a slow but steady growth in the CUP-era was knocked down as the effects of the Armenian Massacres took their toll on the educated middle class. Doctors, engineers, entrepreneurs, etc. all became critical jobs as a continued exodus by Greek-Ottoman citizens in Asia Minor showed how devastating the 'National Economy' plan was to the ravaged nation. In a similar way, the agricultural sector was ruined as the real effects of the war started to sink in. The loss of the Anatolian Turkish population was mind-boggling as almost 25% of the pre-war population was gone, leaving behind an abundance of land without the manpower to work it.\n\nNonetheless, the Sublime Porte did not sit idle and plans for a swift recovery were quickly drafted, as the first post-war cabinet made it their number one priority. Railroads, left behind by investors of nations no longer existing, were nationalised. The dreaded OPDA was completely shut down and its monopolies transferred over to the state. The 'National Economy' programme became the number 1 priority of the Ottoman government as the horrors of the war, and reliance on an untrustworthy non-Turkish population, left deep scars amongst the ruling elite. A Muslim bourgeoisie had to be groomed to challenge the traditional Christian dominance, the people educated and the empire finally launched into the 20th Century."
 otteco.1.a: "Grand Plans but Little Resources."

 otteco.2.t: "The Ottoman Economy in [GetYear]: An Era of Growth"
 otteco.2.d: "As the years ticked by and the economy reached its pre-war state by the late '20s, the then ruling OHF took development to the next level. Consequently, 4-Year plans were laid on the table and the hold of the government on the economy was tightened even further. Then in 1931, the unthinkable happened, as the Nationalist coalition was decisively brought down by the Liberal Entente who reopened the economy to foreign investment and toned down the Etatist measures, so carefully crafted in the decade before. Nonetheless, the economy kept expanding as industries popped up all across Anatolia and the Levant, financed by an almost never-ending wave of economic prosperity in the German Empire and low import costs for machinery and building materials.\n\nBy the middle of the '30s, the Turkish economy had never seen better days, as a feeling of euphoria and progress could be felt from Beirut to Smyrna. Nonetheless, many have pointed out warning signs on the horizon, as increasing instability on the continent and the stagnation of the German economy will likely bring issues to the Grand Orient as well."
 otteco.2.a: "Praise the Devlet-i Ebed-müddet (Eternal State)!"

 otteco.3.t: "Samsun Iktisat Kongresi"
 otteco.3.d: "Crisis. Chaos. Disaster. All across the world economists and business owners are in a state of panic as the unthinkable finally happened earlier this week, when the Berlin Stock Exchange collapsed. Similar to Berlin, Kostantiniyye is on high alert for any changes to the situation as they watch the economy collapse into the ground. Nonetheless there is far less of a crisis in the Empire than many initially expected, as the protectionist nature of the empire during the '20s has formed the foundation of a structure capable of resisting most shocks on the global market.\n\nTo ensure the fears of the private sector are quelled, and to outline the next Four Year Plan envisioned by the OHFs economic partners, a second Economic Congress is planned to be held in the city of Samsun on the Black Sea (Samsun Iktisat Kongresi). Combining both projects from the private sector and showcasing the advances of the Turkish economy over the last few decades, it will not only serve as a way to calm down Ottoman investors, but also as a showcase of the modernising Ottoman nation to the world."
 otteco.3.a: "Mahmut Celâl opens the SIK."

 otteco.4.t: "Railroad Unification Act"
 otteco.4.d: "The 'Devlet Demiryolları Umum Müdürlüğü' or State Railways Administration was founded shortly after the war to take over Entente held railway concessions and to finance the construction of further railroads across the vast lands of the Empire. Nonetheless many foreign concessions remained and various privately held tracks, mainly in Anatolia, refused integration into the DDY. With the Berlin Stock exchange disaster however, many of these companies are on the brink of bankruptcy as such opening up the way for the complete unification of the Ottoman railroad network.\n\nAct 294bn, nicknamed the 'Lightning Bolt' act referencing the way railroads pierce through the inhospitable interior of our nation, plans to in one fell swoop abolish all non government held railway companies and to bring their assets together into the DDY. Hakkı Behiç, former mastermind behind the original creation of the DDY, has been recalled from the Austro-Hungarian empire to oversee the process and the further expansion of the network."
 otteco.4.a: "From Sirkeci to Baghdad!"

 otteco.5.t: "Smyrna International Fair opens doors"
 otteco.5.d: "Located just outside of the city due to a lack of available building space, the First Smyrna International Fair opened its doors to the public earlier this week. Although the immediate purpose of the grounds remains a bit unclear, the organisers behind the project have laid the foundations of what they hope to be the largest Exposition ever in the Middle East, and are encouraging businesses and industry all across the empire to showcase the ingenuity and expertise of the Ottoman people. The government has applauded the effort and Prince Osman Fuad personally opened the park bringing with him a generous contribution from the Imperial Treasury."
 otteco.5.a: "Splendid!"

 otteco.6.t: "Completion of the Kut Barrage"
 otteco.6.d: "To maintain a high enough water level in the Tigris to sustain the Gharraf irrigation canal, around the city of Kut, construction was started by an Ottoman-Assyrian company in 1931 on a barrage. Works were temporarily halted in early 1936 as a major flood on the Tigris River, flooded the construction site which delayed the works for another 6 months.\n\nConstruction of the barrage was carried out by 2,500 Arab and Assyrian workers, and involved the removal of 1,223,288 cubic metres (1,600,000 cu yd) of ground whilst for the barrage itself 191,139 cubic metres (250,000 cu yd) of concrete was used. "
 otteco.6.a: "Splendid!"

 otteco.7.t: "The Iraqi Concession"
 otteco.7.d: "In an attempt to provide their government with much needed revenue, the Ottomans have decided to sell off concessions in Iraq. Home to tremendously rich oil deposits, this may be a once in a lifetime opportunity to get control over these, should we be willing to accept. Our window of opportunity is limited at best, as others look with great interest over our shoulder."
 otteco.7.a: "This seems like a steal!"
 otteco.7.b: "Why would we ever want such a thing."

 otteco.8.t: "Opening of the Zuwarah-Tripoli Track"
 otteco.8.d: "As part of the railroad programme in Tripolitania, the line between the cities of Zuwarah and Tripoli was opened today. The station of Tripoli which was renovated as part of the Benghazi-Tripoli construction has hereby also been reopened and was home to the festivities. Many of the Tripolitanian heroes who fought during the Weltkrieg were also present, and even Prince Osman Fuad came all the way to the city to celebrate the entry of the industrial revolution to the Tripolitanian provinces."
 otteco.8.a: "How grand!"

 otteco.9.t: "Collapse of the Persian Gulf Economy"
 otteco.9.d: "Reports have reached the wali in Basra that several of the Persian Gulf states have been hit especially hard by the economic depression in Europe and that this has caused shockwaves in their entire social structure. Many of these states, such as Dubai, are almost entirely dependent on the pearl fishing industry, and have the European continent as their main markets.\n\nWith the rise in popularity of cheaper Japanese substitutes, the market received its first hit during the '20s but the conflict between this state and the Mitteleuropan bloc ensured a steady demand for the Gulf. Now that this demand has evaporated almost overnight, the entire industry is on the brink of collapse.\n\nWhilst this is of course unfortunate for the Arabs of the region, this catastrophe has forced them closer to the Ottoman state and our internal market. Upon the request of several Sheikhs and Emirs, the TPC (Turkish Petroleum Company) has opened talks to discuss the possibility of oil exploration along the coast, and expansion of operations in the Gulf."
 otteco.9.a: "One man's loss is another man's gain."

 otteco.10.t: "Expansion of the Greek Merchant Navy"
 otteco.10.d: "Traditionally led by the Greek population of the Ottoman state, the shipping industry of Western Anatolia and the Aegean Isles is world renowned and has, despite frequent crisis prompted by conflict between Turks and Greeks, steadily grown during the interbellum.\n\nWith a massive economic crisis gripping countries around the globe, and the American nation in complete collapse, various shrewd entrepreneurs have smelled a chance at success, and have started to buy up various merchant ships from all across the world. Leading the charge on this is the well-known Aristotle Onassis, a native of Izmir, who has together with other Greek families built up a true shipping imperium on the Aegean coast. As many of these ships sail under flags of other nations it is questionable whether this will have far reaching consequences on the Ottoman economy, but the Ottoman banks have nonetheless decided to grant extensive loans for these take-over operations."

 ottsep.1.t: "Antun Saadeh Publishes 'The Genesis of Nations'"
 ottsep.1.d: "A journalist from Beyrut is making shockwaves in the Suriye vilayet with his romantic view on a greater Syria free from Ottoman rule. Taking inspiration from the ancient Assyrian empire and a return to the Fertile Crescent of old, he pleads for a nation spreading from the Suez Canal in the South, to the Tarsus mountains in the North, and from Kuwait in the East to Cyprus in the West. Though the survival of a nation consisting of such a massive amount of different ethnicities and religions seems a fairy tale, the man not only follows closely to the Kemalist ideal of a secularist state, but also inspiration from the Syndicalist powers seems apparent as well, with a focus on abolishing feudalism, nationalising vital areas of the economy, mandatory education and universal healthcare.\n\nEven though its popularity amongst the Syrian people seems rather low for now, the governor of Beyrut has ordered his arrest and the man has been imprisoned for treason against the state and instigating revolutionary activities."
 ottsep.1.a: "Troubling news."

 ottsep.2.t: "Riots in Damascus"
 ottsep.2.d: "Instigated by the sharp economic downturn in the region and populist rabble-rousers, the Syrian people seem to be shifting the blame for the current economic crisis towards the central Ottoman government. The rapid decrease in price for agricultural produce in the meanwhile is taking a toll on the recently settled tribes of the Syrian hinterland where banditry is increasing by the day.\n\nIn the intellectual centre of both Suriye and the Ottoman Arabs in general, Sam, a general strike against the government has been called. More disturbing however is the increasing polarisation of the political landscape in Syria as groups such as the authoritarian SSNP and the Syrian Syndicalist Party are growing in size and influence."
 ottsep.2.a: "Most troubling."

 ottsep.3.t: "Paramilitary Wing of the SSNP"
 ottsep.3.d: "Although the immediate popular response to Saadeh's party is limited at best, one cannot deny that it has not made a deep impression in the political scene of Syria. As opposed to the more traditional, aristocratic and oligarchic parties in the cities of Damascus and Aleppo, this new organisation has a central directive, a strong political message and a limited, but dedicated, core of supporters.\n\nParading through the streets of Beirut, the new paramilitary wing of the party is certainly a sight to behold, as the Orient isn't used to this sort of militaristic and modern display of politics."
 ottsep.3.a: "Most troubling."

 ottsep.4.t: "Increased Attacks in the Hejaz"
 ottsep.4.d: "Our momentary weakness is already showing its mark in the Hejaz, where delays in our payments to the tribal leaders have resulted in their retaliation. Caravans and pilgrims on their way to the Holy Cities are experiencing increased attacks from bandits and deserters, as the usual escorts turn a blind eye. These attacks are causing great damage to the prestige of the Caliph and it may be best to court the tribes with what little resources we have."

 ottsep.5.t: "OPAD Strengthens Hold in the Mashriq"
 ottsep.5.d: "The Ottoman Party for Administrative Decentralisation is making increasing waves in the Mashriq as a variety of parties in the Greater-Syria region were absorbed into their organisation. Although a similar hand was reached out to the Arab Parties in Iraq, this offer was politely declined as fear of increasing Damascene influence amongst the Arab movement was seen as counterproductive to the ultimate goal of Arab autonomy."
 ottsep.5.a: "They are only making themselves a bigger target."

 ottsep.6.t: "Khalid Bakdash Takes over the Arab Syndicalist Party"
 ottsep.6.d: "Leaving the nation for the Commune of France in 1930 to avoid persecution by the then ruling OHF administration, Khalid Bakdash has enjoyed education in the French capital itself, and could be seen amongst many influential leaders in debates concerning the expansion of syndicalism to the Orient.\n\nNow that he has returned, it would surprise no one if he were to push a programme similar to that which he encountered in France, but local authorities are not really concerned by his presence, as the lacking of any industrial proletariat in the Arab world makes almost any support for syndicalism impossible."
 ottsep.6.a: "Good luck."

 ottsep.7.t: "Sharif Ali Haidar Passes Away"
 ottsep.7.d: "Appointed by Irade during the initial days of the Hejazi Revolt, Ali Haidar Pasha of the Hashemite house had acted as Sharif of the Holy Cities for almost two decades before his death earlier this week. As the need of the office has been questioned repeatedly with most authority these days in the hands of the Hejazi Wali, some are hoping to use this opportunity to not appoint a successor and as such end the tradition.\n\nSon of Ali Haidar and raised amongst the Court in Kostantiniyye, Abdul Majid Haidar would be his successor, but has shown little desire for the position, preferring the lively streets of the capital to the dusty hills of the Hejaz."

 ottsep.8.d: "Troubling reports have reached us from Southern Iraq where parents appear to stop their children from attending the state schools due to fear of Sunni indoctrination. These citizens, predominately following the Shiite faith, are as such obstructing the education of their children and enlarging the social divide between the Sunni and Shia Arabs as this limits their future abilities.\n\nLittle has been done by the Iraqi administration however as it further plays into their Sunni superiority policy, which has in recent years led to a significant decrease in Shiite officials. Furthermore, they also claim that without education these people will remain apolitical, as such forming no threat to their own positions."
 ottsep.8.a: "Encourage further Shiite enlistment."
 ottsep.8.b: "An illiterate citizen is a docile citizen..."

 ottsep.9.t: "Increasing Social Inequality in Iraq"
 ottsep.9.d: "Iraqi society has always been divided between city dwellers (inhabiting cities such as Baghdad and Mosul), Bedouins (roaming the vast deserts) and a caste of farmers working the lands between the Tigris and Euphrates. This latter group has for the vast majority of its history been separated from nearly all affairs, barring their immediate needs, and has made use of the communal agricultural ground to satisfy their own and the needs of the city dwellers. Benefitting from the almost non-existent authority imposed by the Ottoman Empire, who only did the bare minimum to maintain a semblance of order in the region, this group lived a poor but fairly content life.\n\nAfter the loss of our European holdings and the seemingly shifted loyalty of many Syrian groups, the Empire has received a wake-up call to no longer use Iraq as the poor land it was always regarded as, but to shape in it the future of the Sublime State. Starting from basically a clean slate, schools, roads and a vast administrative network were pumped out of the ground in record time with primary-level school attendance doubling year over year. A 'new' local elite, trained and indoctrinated in the various Turkish academies, was to further extend Ottoman control over the cities whilst the Ottoman Military Academy set up in Baghdad served to create a loyal Iraqi officer corps.\n\nAs the Ottoman control over the cities increased at an explosive rate, this same evolution could however not be seen amongst the much larger population of peasants, still living in nearly the same condition as their ancestors had done for centuries. The Turkish educated elite however, backed by their allies in the Iraqi Walis, discontent with the low agricultural output has over the last 2 decades increasingly privatised and seized this communal land, forcing many of its former residents into a sort of serfdom. Illiterate to the man and never having interacted with the government in the first place, this class had barely any defence against the money lenders and urban elite."

 ottsep.10.d: "Fighting back against what they call Turkish imperialism and deliberate destruction of the Arab identity, students and small business owners have taken to the streets today in Baghdad calling for more local power and a greater input in the affairs of the Iraqi vilayets. Answered by the Ottoman gendarmes, and after an official answer to their complaints was read out in the mosques of the city, it seems that the protest has calmed down once more but the sharp increase in these events is frightening Ottoman officials in the region."
 ottsep.10.a: "Unfortunate."

 ottsep.11.t: "Conflict in Sulaymaniyah"
 ottsep.11.d: "The province of Sulaymaniyah has always been a point of trouble for the Walis of Mesopotamia. Inhabited by a strong Kurdish majority, many of their Sheiks and Aghas refuse to implement the new reforms and concede authority to Kostantiniyye and instead hold on strongly to tribal allegiances and Kurdist tradition.\n\nTurkoman expansion towards Eastern Mesopotamia, the Assyrian exodus and the discovery of oil near Mosul and Kirkuk has upset the delicate balance of the region with various groups attempting to take control over the territory. Inside of Kurdistan, great rivalry also rules as the various tribes are involved in a near constant state of internal conflict based on family, language and sectarian lines.\n\nAs the Ottoman state has no desire to let one Kurdish group get stronger than the others or let them find a common ground besides the Padishah, this struggle is often encouraged by authorities in Mosul to the detriment of both the Kurds themselves, the remaining Assyrians, and the Turkomans who are often victims of Kurdish offensives."
 ottsep.11.a: "Their division keeps them docile."

 ottsep.12.t: "Barzani Insurrection in Iraqi Kurdistan"
 ottsep.12.d: "The Barzani tribe is fighting back against their growing loss of power in the Empire as a coordinated offensive by the Ottoman army and air force has slowly been pushing them out of their territories towards Iran. The Barzanis, led by the charismatic Mustafa Barzani, have long been fighting against the Porte which has in recent years been responsible for the death of both his father, grandfather and two brothers in failed insurrections over the last decades.\n\nThe combination of the airpower responsible for the bombardment of dozens of villages, and a land offensive by the army however, seems, to now be breaking the final resistance as the sheer force of the modern arsenal brought by the Padishahs finest is overpowering what little resistance can still be offered. Other Kurdish tribes, long rivals of the Barzanis, have also granted support in the form of irregulars to the Turkish forces in the hopes of acquiring Barzani lands once the rebels have been firmly put down."
 ottsep.12.a: "Soon their pathetic attempts will be silenced for good."

 ottsep.13.t: "Trouble in Fezzan"
 ottsep.13.d: "When Ottoman rule was restored to the Fezzan interior during the middle of the twenties, few accepted it with open arms, and during the subsequent years the regime in Tripoli decided that maintaining a sizeable force in the region would be too costly. Thus, the retreat of all troops, bar some small garrisons in the urban centres, has led to an almost entirely autonomous position for the local tribes.\n\nThe tribes remain discontent however, and influenced by a resurgence of the Senussi sect, tribes such as the Awlad Muhammad have started to show their resistance to the regime more clearly. Raids on Ottoman garrisons, their refusal to pay taxes, and their efforts to thwart conscription have caused drastic issues for the few remaining forces in the region.\n\nA military expedition from the coast could restore order to the region, but with the large economic crisis still reigning, many wonder if it wouldn't be best to withdraw all garrisons and grant the region de facto self-rule. In Tripolitania, there is less animus to abandon the region as the valuable date production of Fezzan is essential in a nation with so little rainfall."
 ottsep.13.a: "Send in the troops!"
 ottsep.13.b: "Is this really worth the price...?"

 ottsep.14.t: "Famine in Tripolitania"
 ottsep.14.d: "Always left to the mercy of rain, Tripolitania has suffered from an especially bad year which has caused havoc to the harvests. The steady population growth of the last two decades has only exacerbated the situation as relief from Greater Syria and Anatolia is unable to fully cope with the crisis. Reports from Cyrenaica and Fezzan indicate that the issue is less severe there, as the Green Mountain seemed to have been mostly spared.\n\nWith the agricultural exports of the nation, its main source of revenue, now almost entirely gone, the government in Tripolitania has requested a decrease in taxes and further assistance from the Ottoman centre."
 ottsep.14.a: "It is our duty to help!"
 ottsep.14.b: "There is nothing we can do for them..."

 ottsep.15.t: "Idris Returns to the Throne"
 ottsep.15.d: "Exiled prince of the Senussi Order, Idris I has returned from his self-imposed exile in Cairo. His nephew Ibrahim ibn Ahmad as-Sharif has been forced to resign and all remaining Ottoman observers have been kicked out of Cyrenaica. Their new leader has also decided to move his capital closer to the Egyptian border, a clear sign of his anti-Ottoman ambitions. The city of Giarabub, which was transferred to Cyrenaica at the end of the war, has now been decreed as official capital of Cyrenaica. This spiritual centre of the Order which is home to its main educational facilities, and is forbidden to all non-Muslims, lies deep within the desert and will make it especially hard for any Ottoman intervention to occur."
 ottsep.15.a: "Put down the Order!"
 ottsep.15.b: "We should bide our time."

 ottsep.16.t: "Unrest in Benghazi"
 ottsep.16.d: "Serving as the only Ottoman base in Cyrenaica, a new wave of unrest has washed over the town with the departure of the Senussi administration from Ajdabiya to Giarabub. No doubt caused by agents of the Senussi sect, they have succeeded in causing severe damage to the Ottoman standing amongst the local population.\n\nMany of the cities non-Muslim citizens are demanding more decisive action from the garrison in the city as they fear that a departure of Ottoman rule from the region would have severe consequences on their economic fortunes, and even their lives, should it come to blows between the two sides. The Jewish community is especially at risk, as even in Benghazi, the effects of the Palestinian issue start to weigh in."
 ottsep.16.a: "Most worrying."

 ottsep.17.t: "Bread Riots in Aleppo"
 ottsep.17.d: "As the economic situation in the realm deteriorates, the Syrian city of Aleppo has once again been hit by bread riots. Even though the scope of these riots remains unclear for now, a mob assaulted Christian and Jewish bakeries and flour mills throughout the city. Luckily the governor was quick to intervene, and was able to put the mob down after reinforcements from Anatolia arrived. Eight rioters were shot in the operation but it seems that no fatalities were reported."
 ottsep.17.a: "Worrying."

 ottsep.18.t: "Trouble in Dubai"
 ottsep.18.d: "Tensions have been rising in the Sheikhdom of Dubai in the Persian Gulf, as the catastrophic collapse of the pearl trade has caused massive shockwaves in the small city. Nakhudas (captains of pearl fishing boats) are forced to stay in port year round as competition with the synthetic pearl originating in Japan has saturated the market, an already smaller pie due to the global economic catastrophe. Furthermore, the monopoly on power of the Sheikh has given rise to a reform movement calling if not for his outright abdication, at least for the instalment of a democratic body in the form of a Majlis.\n\nUnder threat from a supposed assassination plot by a group of local merchants, disgruntled princes and expatriates, the Ottoman fleet has dispatched a small vessel to the Trucial coast to deter any open aggression against the Sheikh, but tensions have only further escalated. With the ruler and his supporters entrenched on the Bur Dubai side of the creek and his opponents on the other side at Deira, it seems the whole sheikhdom is spoiling for a fight. Sporadic gunfire has reportedly been heard in the city and meddlers in the neighbouring Sheikhdoms are seemingly looking for a chance to pounce and back their horse in the fight to come."
 ottsep.18.a: "Force the Sheikh to concede!"
 ottsep.18.b: "It is not our place to intervene."

 ottsep.19.t: "Sheikh Saeed ibn Maktoum Disbands Dubai Majlis"
 ottsep.19.d: "After being forced to concede to the Dubai Reform Movement and agree with the empowerment of the Majlis (council), it seemed like real progress could have been achieved in Dubai but these efforts seem to have been in vain as only a few months after their creation, the Sheikh has crushed the movement with an iron fist.\n\nMatters had come to a head when the Majlis, under its leader Hasher ibn Rashid, restricted the ruler to 10.000 rupees of the state revenues for his personal use. Enraged by this decision, the Sheikh formally disbanded the Majlis and decided to settle the argument once and for all.\n\nTaking advantage of his son's wedding to Latifa bint Hamdan of Abu Dhabi, Saeed's loyal Bedouin who were brought into town for the ceremony, drew their swords and proceeded to kill various high ranking members of the Bani Rashid, amongst whom was the chairman of the Majlis. Crumbling apart due to this catastrophe, the remainder of the Reform Movement has fled to the Sheikhdom of Sharjah in the hopes of gaining the support of the Sheikh and returning to oust Sheikh Saeed."
 ottsep.19.a: "Tensions are rising on the Trucial Coast..."

 ottsep.20.t: "War on the Trucial Coast!"
 ottsep.20.d: "Since the red wedding, tensions had been rising quickly between the Sheikhdoms of Dubai and Sharjah, as those that escaped murder at the hands of Saeed's tribesmen fled to Sharjah, in the hopes of finding a benefactor for their cause. Finding a willing ally in Sheikh Sultan of Sharjah, the new leader of the Reform Movement (Mani ibn Rashid) has regained the momentum and tribesmen of Sharjah moved quickly into a sangar on the Dubai side of the Khan creek.\n\nFaced with a fragile support base, Sheikh Saeed of Dubai decided to answer their act with an official declaration of war. Sending his troops within 4 miles of Sharjah, the two camps quickly came to blows. In traditional Bedouin style however, the two sides exchanged inaccurate fire preventing any degree of significant bloodshed. When a truce was signed only a few days later, both sides had run out of ammo leaving 1 Sharjah man killed, and 2 Dubai men imprisoned.\n\nSince fighting had become impossible due to a lack of materiel, both sides have agreed to a 3-month truce to await the next shipment coming in from Iraq."
 ottsep.20.a: "Let us hope they'll soon sign peace."

 ottsep.21.t: "Sheikh Sultan of Ras al-Khaimah Offers His Services"
 ottsep.21.d: "Having noticed our entanglement in a foreign conflict on a global scale, the Sheikh of Ras al-Khaimah has offered his services as mediator in the world war. He has suggested that we should let the Trucial Sheikhs communicate with the Syndicalists in Paris and broker peace between them and Berlin. He also added that after their (guaranteed) success, the Ottoman Empire should rapidly arm herself and then pounce on the syndicalists with renewed vigour, per the customs of the Trucial States."
 ottsep.21.a: "... thanks for the offer, I guess?"

 ottsep.22.t: "Famine in the Persian Gulf"
 ottsep.22.d: "Hurt by the hardships of the world war, the situation has reached the breaking point in the Persian Gulf, as a severe drought has further exacerbated the already hungry people. No rain has fallen since last year and the situation has been reported on the ground as highly critical. In fact cattle and camels are in such an emaciated condition that if rain does occur within the next few weeks, it is more than likely that they will be unable to withstand the consequent cold and exposure and will perish.\n\nIn Ras al-Khaimah, rice and sugar have become in such short supply that people have started to boil and squeeze date sacks in order to extract the last drops from them. Mazari traders have left with their families and gone to Kenya in the hopes of finding food there, whilst others have set sail for the Mesopotamian delta in the hopes of receiving support from the local government."
 ottsep.22.a: "A most dreadful situation..."

 ottsep.23.t: "[PER.GetName] Seizes Hengam Island"
 ottsep.23.d: "Although Hengam Island, just South of the Persian coast, on paper belongs to the Persian state, the island is de facto ruled by Sheikh Ahmed ibn Obaid ibn Juma (father-in-law to the Sheikh of Dubai). As part of their shift in foreign policy to take a more assertive and anti-Ottoman stance, the government in Teheran has decided to push their luck in the Strait of Hormuz. Earlier this week, the Sheikh and his entourage were expelled from the island, sent packing to their family in Dubai, and a customs post was installed proudly waving the Persian flag.\n\nWhilst a diplomatic objection has been made by our government against the Persian aggression, there have thus far been no plans to escalate the small border conflict to any further punitive actions. In Dubai however, outrage against this move by Teheran has led many to question the capacity of the Ottoman government to defend the interests of the Gulf and their Sheikh for so easily submitting to Persian ploys."
 ottsep.23.a: "Let us hope the Persian beast is now satisfied!"

 ottsep.24.t: "Increasing Unrest on Bahrain"
 ottsep.24.d: "Prompted by increased interest of the Persian government in the affairs of the Shia majority island of the coast of al-Hasa, there has been a noted increase in anti-Ottoman and anti-Sunni sentiment. Further coupled to the pearl trade catastrophe and the weak response of the Sheikh to the decreasing living standards of his population, the island has been rocked by a wave of protests calling for reform and equal representation.\n\nMore disturbing than the Persian overtures however is the increase of radio sets, tuned in to Radio Free Cairo, spreading Arab nationalist propaganda and calling on all Arab people to throw of the Turkish yoke."
 ottsep.24.a: "Most unfortunate."

 ottsep.25.t: "Clash in the Arab Gulf"
 ottsep.25.d: "Tensions between Kostantiniyye and Teheran reached a new high this week as Persian customs detained a Dubai-flagged jalbut on its travel to the island of Greater Thunb. Sparking immediate outrage from the entire population of the Trucial Coast, in a rare display of unity for the region, a squadron of the Ottoman fleet was dispatched to the region and anchored just before the coast of the Persian city of Lingah. Sending an ultimatum to the Persian government to immediately release the passengers, who were travelling under the protection of the Sultan-Caliph, escalation ultimately brought forth a salvo from the Ottoman fleet after which the white flag was hoisted on the shore.\n\nWhilst the safe passage of Ottoman subjects in the Persian Gulf has thus been reassured (by force), many are seeing in this yet another sign of a nearing confrontation between the two former enemies. With unrest rising in Palestine and friction on the Kurdish frontier, it may even seem that this confrontation is coming sooner rather than later."
 ottsep.25.a: "The Persians are playing a dangerous game..."

 ottsep.26.t: "Formation of the Syrian Muslim Brotherhood"
 ottsep.26.d: "Inspired by events in Egypt under the leadership of the charismatic Imam Hasan al-Banna and by the continued secularisation and westernisation of the empire, a small group of conservatives in Damascus have set up a Syrian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood. Pledged to restore a real, Arab, caliphate to the Middle East and rid the region of Western decadence, Sheikh Mustapha al-Sibaii has found a listening ear in the struggling population of Homs. Subsidies from the Egyptian court for his organisation are sure to have had an impact on its membership but thus far our intelligence has pointed out that it has remained a fringe movement within the Greater Syrian political climate."
 ottsep.26.a: "Disturbing."

 ottsep.27.t: "The Syrian League of National Action"
 ottsep.27.d: "Rumours had been brewing for a while now, after the electoral defeat of the decentralist coalition in 1935, of a new party for second generation Syrian nationalists. Promising to be young, dynamic and very different from the traditional Damascene parties, this new party was today announced to the public under their leaders Ahmad Sharabati, Abdulrazzaq al-Dandashi, Irfan al-Jallad and Shafik Suleiman as the "League of National Action".\n\nIn opposition to the old elites, deeply engrained within the Ottoman civil system, the new party promises to be the voice of the Syrian youth and work together with other Arab nationalist forces to hasten the autonomy Syria has been striving for. Likely influenced by Egyptian rhetoric, the League of National Action has also embraced a Qawmi or greater Arab identity as opposed to the Syria focused Watani identity of the Damascene elite. Despite their enthusiasm however, so far interest from regions outside Syria has been lukewarm as best and even within Syria, their message doesn't seem to reach much further than Damascus."
 ottsep.27.a: "These are just bored youngsters!"

 ottsep.28.t: "The Ashbal al-Uruba"
 ottsep.28.d: "Further developments have occurred in the Syrian political capital of Damascus where to the example of many nationalist movements in Europe, the League of National Action has given rise to their own militia. Called the Ashbal al-Uruba, they say that they have been inspired by European armies and are wearing green shirts. Parading through the streets of Damascus, unarmed as to not give the Gendarmerie an excuse to intervene, the militia promises to create 'three-dimensional men' out of the Syrian youth, excelling in martial arts, politics, mathematics, politics and poetry."
 ottsep.28.a: "Most disturbing."

 ottsep.29.t: "The Matter of Khasab"
 ottsep.29.d: "An enclave of the Muscati state, the peninsula of Khasab is one of the most crucial positions in the Middle East. Singlehandedly having the capacity to completely cut off the strait of Hormuz, thus cutting Iran and Iraq off from the world's economy, it has been a thorn in the sight of both Kostantiniyye and Teheran. With Muscat however, forming a neutral power between the two rivalling blocs, an acceptable compromise seem to have been reached and for centuries the Sultans of the Muscati thalassocracy have been able to govern the peninsula uncontested.\n\nThe decay of the Muscati state has however not gone unnoticed, and with tensions rising between the two largest powers in the region, the peninsula has found itself a pawn in a dangerous game. The Muscati navy, their lifeblood and pride for centuries, has been entirely wiped out as the industrial behemoths of the seas have outclassed the classical Dhows leaving the defence of the peninsula solely to the goodwill of its neighbours. This goodwill seems to have run out as naval manoeuvres by the Persian fleet around the Strait have led to a similar response from the Caliphate, bringing the two to the brink of war."
 ottsep.29.a: "The Persians better not do anything they'll regret..."
 ottsep.29.b: "The Strait is Persian and shall forever be so!"

 ottsep.30.t: "The Invasion of Khasab"
 ottsep.30.d: "Townsmen of the otherwise quiet Khasab were rudely awakened by the presence of an Iranian detachment on their shore this morning, as in yet another move of mounting tensions in the Arab Gulf, the government of Teheran has seemingly unilaterally taken control over the entire Strait of Hormuz. The occupation has been without bloodshed, seemingly being led from the Iranian cruiser \"Sahand\", where shortly after 6am a group of 5 lifeboats were disembarked and sent towards the harbour of Khasab. After a short kerfuffle with the small Muscati garrison in Khasab Castle, the Muscatis surrendered and the Iranian flag was hoisted on its battlements to signify the new ruler of the peninsula.\n\nThis blatant act of aggression which has cut of our dominions in the Gulf from their traditional partners in India has caused great consternation in Basra and Baghdad, where officials are demanding an immediate response to the threat, showcasing the strength of the Ottoman fleet and giving the Iranians a warning they won't soon forget!"
 ottsep.30.a: "Set sail for Khasab!"
 ottsep.30.b: "We cannot risk war with Teheran."

 ottsep.31.t: "Ottoman Ultimatum over Khasab"
 ottsep.31.d: "Unsurprisingly outraged by our unilateral occupation of the strategic Musandam peninsula, the Ottoman Gulf Fleet has set sail for the peninsula with orders to remove all hostile elements by force if necessary. Unlikely to deter, they thus demand that we voluntarily withdraw or suffer the consequences.\n\nWhilst the Ottoman beast is suffering greatly from all sides, we should not underestimate their capabilities as incursions over the last few decades have shown. Nonetheless many see the bucket near the tipping point, and are calling on the government to take a decisive stance that will determine Iranian power in the Persian Gulf for decades to come."
 ottsep.31.a: "We must fall back."
 ottsep.31.b: "The Turks have gone too far, to war!"

 ottsep.32.t: "Iran Abandons Musandam Peninsula"
 ottsep.32.d: "Seemingly scared off by the Ottoman fleet, the Iranians have packed up their bags in Khasab and returned to the Sahand. With the Iranian presence removed from the peninsula, the question remains as to its future. The Sultan of Muscat has proven utterly incapable of defending against even the smallest of armies, and with the rising importance of the Hormuz Strait in the global economy, being the vein that connects Iraqi and Bahraini oil to the world, some have asked themselves whether it wouldn't be better for our security if a permanent Ottoman garrison is established on the peninsula."
 ottsep.32.a: "Hand the Peninsula back to our Muscati friends."
 ottsep.32.b: "The Strait of Hormuz necessitates a strong Ottoman presence!"

 ottsep.33.t: "The Invasion of Khasab"
 ottsep.33.d: "Townsmen of the otherwise quiet Khasab were rudely awakened by the presence of an Iranian detachment on their shore this morning, as in yet another move of mounting tensions in the Arab Gulf, the government of Teheran has seemingly unilaterally taken control over the entire Strait of Hormuz. The occupation has been without bloodshed, seemingly being led from the Iranian cruiser \"Sahand\", where shortly after 6am a group of 5 lifeboats were disembarked and sent towards the harbour of Khasab.

 ottsep.33.a: "Another victory for Iran!"

 ottsep.34.t: "Iran Breaks the 1913 Shatt al-Arab Protocols"
 ottsep.34.d: "Established in 1913 after almost a hundred years of negotiations, the Shatt al-Arab Protocols were the crowning achievement of the resolution that ended the Iranian-Ottoman border conflicts. With this last guarantee of Iranian neutrality in the East gone, it is without a doubt now clear that Iran will entertain its ambitions and strike on Iraq.\n\nFighting between the two great powers commenced in the early hours as an air bombardment of Fao Fortress in the Shatt al-Arab was followed by small incursions of Iranian cavalry regiments in Sulaymaniyah."
 ottsep.34.a: "War it is then!"

 ottsep.35.t: "Rebellion in Armenia!"
 ottsep.35.d: "Conflict is brewing across the Middle East, and our Empire that has ruled over the region for decades is beginning to collapse. The Armenians in the east see this situation as an opportunity, and Nzhdeh's fedayi are ready to take over Erivan, raising the flag of an independent Armenia once again."
 ottsep.35.a: "We stand loyal to [TUR.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]."
 ottsep.35.b: "For Armenia! (Play as Armenia)"

 ottsep.36.t: "The Armenian Rebellion" #PoV: PER
 ottsep.36.d: "Gathering new courage at the sight of the combined forces of the Middle East rising against the tyrants of the Porte, the Armenians have thrown off their shackles and joined the battle against the Ottoman beast. Under the leadership of Gareghin Nzhdeh, an infamous military commander and Armenian national hero, the rebels were able to banish the Turkish garrisons from [ARM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], delivering a sudden and hefty blow against the Sultan.\n\nFor the moment, spirits among the Armenian populace remain high, as this war presents a chance to finally avenge the fall of the First Armenian Republic and to restore the sovereignty of their people. However, without any outside support, their vigour alone won't keep Nzhdeh and his forces from destruction. They put their trust in both us and the Cairo Pact, so we better not disappoint them now, but show them that we, too, know how to strike fear in the hearts of the Turks!"
 ottsep.36.a: "Together, we shall shatter the crescent!"

 ottfla.1.d: "In 1459, Mehmed the Conqueror ordered the construction of Topkapı Palace, the former imperial residence of the House of Osman. As the centuries dragged on however, the sultans and their households preferred their other residences on the Asian side of the Bosporus leading to the Court moving over to the Dolmabahçe Palace. Nonetheless retaining some of its former functions, such as the Imperial Treasury, the Palace was finally emptied in 1927 after the death of Mehmet VI the year earlier. Sultan Abdulmecid II, a patron of the arts and famous artist himself, subsequently granted the grounds to the Ottoman state for use as a museum and art exposition. Closed for almost 8 years, the buildings were thoroughly renovated and restored in an attempt to once more show the splendour of the Ottoman Empire and hopefully rekindle the old Ottomanist spirit.\n\nOpened with a splendid party in the Enderûn, the old Sultan himself presented a multitude of his own works and various masterpieces of contemporary Ottoman art to the gathered world press."

 ottfla.2.d: "The Chemins de fer Orientaux have officially been integrated within the DDY today after a short round of funding by the government was able to acquire the last remaining tracks from Austrian and German shareholders in the wake of the Berlin Crash. The railway company, which was founded in 1868 to build a railway line connecting Vienna and Constantinople, has had a rough history as various wars, border adjustments and financial crises left it broken up.\n\nIts most famous user, the luxury 'Orient Express', in the past connected Paris to our grand capital where it arrived in the Sirkeci Terminal. The Weltkrieg however caused great damage to the company as the German Mitropa laid claim to a large portion of its assets in Central and Eastern Europe. Even though the 'Orient Express' still arrives from Strassburg, one cannot deny that the end is nearing for the imperialist grandeur of old."

It's not the first time that this has happened in Baghdad and it's also unlikely to be the last, as the education ministry is ignoring their demands claiming they are just 'lazy students and should stop wasting time protesting and instead devote that time on their studies.'"

Although this explanation for recent misfortune in Suriye seems, even among conservative citizens, to be complete baloney, the influence held by the Mufti has still forced the governor to reconsider his opinion, and a heated debate was prompted in the council of Sam."

Afterwards the ship served with great distinction as an ammunition and troop transport, until she was torpedoed by the British Navy.\n\nShe is however best known for her operations in the Aegean after the fall of Greece in the repatriation of many Turks to the Dodecanese, and for being the first Ottoman vessel to reach the shores of America in 1921, where she proudly showed her Turkish flag.

 ottfla.11.t: "Creation of the State Airlines General Directorate"
 ottfla.11.d: "Seen as one of the most vital technological advancements of our era, the Ottoman government has always had a keen interest in the field of aviation, as its potential for partisan suppression and quick communication are essential for maintaining the integrity of the Sublime State. Besides military applications however, there has been a growing interest into the potential of civilian transportation by air from the centre to the periphery.\n\nTo cater to this demand, the government has struck a partnership with the German aircraft manufacturer Junkers to enable the construction of licence built planes within the Ottoman Empire. Even though the Empire doesn't readily possess the technological prowess or degree of industrialisation to mass produce aircraft, this sector of the industry has been absorbed into the state directives as essential to the interests of the Ottoman state.\n\nThe current airline, operated by the Ministry of Defence, has also been rebranded into the State Airlines General Directorate and folded into the Department of Transportation. Whilst ambitious plans for an airport in Kostantiniyye have also been drafted up, the lack of funding has postponed these indefinitely with the already collected funding instead shifted towards the expansion of air strips in Baghdad, Beirut, Mecca and Misurata."

 ottfla.12.d: "Today is the first day of Ramazan Bayrami or the Festival of Breaking the Fast. After fasting for a month during the Ramadan, all of Islam is celebrating this joyous occasion.\n\nIn most households, the men attend morning prayers at the mosque. Then they come home to find a lavish breakfast prepared. It is also customary to eat either dates or some sweets before attending the prayers. For many households, this is the first breakfast served after sunrise in the last 30 days. The younger people in the household — sons, daughters, grandchildren — traditionally kiss the hand of the elders, as the elders present them with a gift. The gifts are usually money or gold coins wrapped in handkerchiefs.\n\nThe three days of celebration are organised in a hierarchical manner. The first day is reserved for family members. It is tradition for the younger ones to visit and pay respect to the elders. Then more distant family and neighbours must be visited. This is a time for hugs and kisses. It is also a time for broken hearts to be mended. If there are people who have had an argument, Eid is considered a time to make peace.\n\nAnother famous part of the festivities includes the sweet taste of Turkish Delight. These treats are offered to guests who visit as well as to neighbourhood children who run from door to door expecting candy or cash. In addition, Ramadan's famous drummers visit neighbourhoods in the morning. It is customary for the residents of the street to tip the drummer for his service throughout the month."

 ottfla.13.t: "The Empire Celebrates Epiphany"
 ottfla.13.d: "A Christian holiday, also known as the Three Kings' Day in Western Christianity, Epiphany is one of the most sacred holidays of the Orthodox faith which constitutes the majority of our Christian population. In Kostantiniyye and Smyrna the holiday is celebrated most openly by the symbolic Great Blessing of Waters wherein the Patriarch of the Greek Orthodox Church throws a wooden cross into the waters of the Golden Horn. A group of pious swimmers will subsequently endure its icy waters to retrieve the cross and deliver it to the patriarch.\n\nNot just the Christians celebrate this day however, as the blessing of Muslim Fishing Ships occurs on the same day and is performed all over the empire."
 ottfla.13.a: "We honour the Son of God!"

 ottfla.14.t: "Camel Wrestling for the Air Force"
 ottfla.14.d: "As the economic depression caused by the Black Monday crisis has taken a heavy toll on our empire, the budget for the military has also seen a significant decrease. In order to make up some of the losses, the Ottoman National Aviation League has decided to host a fundraiser in the shape of a spectacular camel wrestling championship, the likes Anatolia has never seen before.\n\nBased on the old Turkic traditions over 2300 years old, in the Turkish form of camel wrestling two male Tülü camels wrestle, typically in response to a female camel in heat being led before them. The camels fight by using their necks as leverage to force their opponent to fall down. A camel is declared the winner if his competitor falls to the ground or flees from the fight. Although the practice is regarded as backwards by many in the OHF and as severe cruelty by animal rights supporters, the Türk Ocaklari have applauded the initiative calling it a grand celebration of Turkish culture."
 ottfla.14.a: "May the best camel win!"

 ottfla.15.t: "The Fall of Vienna"
 ottfla.15.d: "When the grand armies of the Sublime Porte marched on Vienna in 1529, it seemed as if the city was going to be just another hurdle on the way to world conquest but as they were rebuked the first real limits of the Empire were tested. In 1683 another force of 170.000 men, including 12.000 Janissaries, was gathered before the walls of Vienna but once more driven back as the alliance of the Holy Roman Empire and the Commonwealth inflicted heavy losses on the besieging army in an event immortalised by the charge of Polish-Lithuanian Winged Hussars. By many seen as the turning point of the Ottoman Empire, the defeat at Vienna initiated a period of decline wherein the periphery of the Ottoman Empire was slowly but surely lost to the forces of Christianity.\n\nWhat failed twice before has now been successful however as columns of Turkish troops march across the Maria-Theresien Platz, saluting a white crescent on a red field. The Schönbrunn Palace, summer residence of the Habsburgs has in the meanwhile been transformed into a headquarters for the army as the quest to take full control over the Habsburg lands continues."
 ottfla.15.a: "Allāhu akbar!"

 ottfla.16.t: "The Villager and the Comet"
 ottfla.16.d: "Today, a villager from Aksaray claimed he saw a lightning ball crashing on his farmland, instantly killing one of his sheep. Fear took a hold of the man when the capsule opened and a man exited clad in an alien uniform. Thinking he was a hostile enemy, he charged at the man with his walking stick. Knocked unconscious by the intruder, the villager awoke a few hours later without any trace of the man left. Cemiyet-i Huniye thinks it's a sign of extraterrestrial life, while Vakf-i Folyo argues that it's a secret military project."

Countless poems, stories and even love letters from feminine admirers have been written about him. This week though, the "cult" around Serdar has grown to new proportions after a new movie called "The Red West" has premiered. The movie has Serdar (who according to the movie was in America in the midst of its civil war) and a mysterious detective called Aziz Vefa trying to rescue Ottoman crown jewels from a group of Syndicate militiamen amongst the highrises of Chicago. While the movie has received quiet criticism from the older generation decrying its lack of realism, the common [ROOT.GetAdjective] citizen seems to love it as especially children could be seen imitating scenes of the movie on the streets of [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]."

A slander campaign in the conservative papers furthermore boosted the popularity of the movie amongst the Ottoman youth, although a confrontation occurred in front of the Ali Efendi Cinema in the capital."

This late inheritance did not rest easy with him, for as a renowned patron and appreciator of culture, our Sultan sooner devoted his time to painting, music and worship, than to the mundanity of governance.\n\nNevertheless, despite his disinterest in the position, he grew into the role and presided over an era of great change in the Empire.\n\nConservatives will remember him for his piety, while liberals will recognise his willingness to leave the ruling of the Empire to the elected government.\n\nHe is now succeeded by his cousin Sultan Ahmed IV, who will lead the mourning for his predecessor through the capital, before guiding the Empire into a bright new age of his own making, inshallah."

### War on the Peninsula
 ottfor.1.t: "War on the Peninsula"
 ottfor.1.d: "After the Weltkrieg, and the victory of our Sublime State over the Arab revolt, we reasserted our hold over the tribal hinterlands of the peninsula. The Saudis, having fought against the Porte during the early parts of the war, flipped sides near the end and joined in on the repression of the Hashemites in the Hejaz.\n\nContinuous bickering between our two tributaries over complete control of the peninsula however, never ceased, and ever since the fall of the British Empire in 1925, the Saudis have built up their strength to deliver the deathblow to the Rashidi-dominated Northern federation of emirs.\n\nAs both sides pledge full allegiance to the Caliphate, and our resources are thinly spread and depleted due to years of war, we have little interest to intervene in their conflict. Tribes in Hejaz, Ma'an and the house of Al-Sabah in Kuwait however, are less complacent about the situation and have pledged support to the Rashidis to quell the Wahhabist plague once and for all. Ottoman gendarmerie in the region have warned us of large groups of young Arab men setting off on horseback into the desert, armed to the teeth, and are warning us that we might have issues demobilising these volunteers should they return, and that the flame of Arab independence may continue within these men."
 ottfor.1.a: "It's not like we can stop them from going anyway."

 ottfor.2.t: "Formation of the Arab Legion"
 ottfor.2.d: "Consisting of the radical core of the volunteer movement that supported the Rashidis in the war for Arab unification, a paramilitary organisation has been founded in Amman under the name of the 'Arab Legion'. Numbering already over 300 men, the organisation has pledged themselves to the protection of the Caliphate, although some have suggested that their real motives are the full independence of the Arab world from Ottoman yoke.\n\nThe army corps stationed in Sam has requested orders to break up the movement by force before they are able to build up a larger support base. The Syrian governor has warned us however that retaliation by force against Arab targets is only going to fuel the risk of revolt and make martyrs of their leaders."
 ottfor.2.a: "Crack down hard on the group."
 ottfor.2.b: "The Sultan is exalted by the loyalty of his children!"

 ottfor.3.t: "Fall of Ha'il"
 ottfor.3.d: "The victory of Al-Saud over the Rashidian federation has sent shockwaves throughout the entire Muslim world as the repression and punishment by the Wahhabist troops exercised on the towns of Jabal Shammar has forced thousands of enemies of the Saudis into our lands.\n\nImpoverished and plagued by the loss of loved ones, these immigrants are flocking to Amman and Kuwait in the hopes of protection from the Saudi armies. Whilst the Saudis have once more reaffirmed their loyalty to the Caliphate after their victory and have sent us a generous tribute to smoothen the deal, officials in the southern vilayets are sleeping with one eye open afraid of a possible betrayal."
 ottfor.3.a: "We recognise the Saudi victory."

 ottfor.4.t: "Fall of Riyadh"
 ottfor.4.d: "As the Saudis were once driven back by the forces of Muhammed Ali in the 19th Century, so have now the emirs of the north driven the Saudis out of their capital in Riyadh. Arabians all across the peninsula from Ha'il to Medina rejoice as the Wahhabists have once more been dealt a powerful blow. The union of Arab forces against Najd however greatly troubles the governors of the southern vilayets, as they fear that this show of Arab cooperation and the enthusiasm of the volunteers who partook in the fighting may give rise to increased Arab nationalism once more."

### Trouble in the Balkans
 ottfor.5.t: "Foundation of the Belgrade Pact"
 ottfor.5.d: "Trouble seems to once more be amok in the Balkans, as the Balkan nations have once again gathered in opposition to Bulgarian hegemony in the region. Although part of the same alliance as us during the Weltkrieg, there is no love between ours and their government, and we are perfectly aware of their designs on Edirne and Kostantiniyye. The Serbs, for now, haven't invited us to their alliance, but the likelihood of war on our Western frontier is increasing by the day. Preparations are being made to reinforce the fortresses of Edirne, and our troops have been placed on a high alert for any actions by the Bulgarians. Whether or not we will get sucked into war once more is unclear for now, as the ravaged Anatolian population, our recruitment pool, has still not fully recovered from the Weltkrieg."
 ottfor.5.a: "Dark clouds are gathering above Europe."

 ottfor.6.t: "Anti-Bulgarian Rhetoric Intensifies"
 ottfor.6.d: "As the Serbs mobilise their army and the Romanians position their armies on the other side of the Danube, anti-Bulgarian rhetoric has become widespread throughout Western Anatolia, with particular hotspots in Eastern Thrace where Imams and populists are stirring the population up for war. Reminding the population of the humiliating defeat in the city at the end of the First Balkan War, and praising the heroic actions of the Ottoman army during the Second, they now call for the liberation of our Muslim brethren under the Bulgarian yoke.\n\nSmall groups of citizens are already arming themselves in preparation of the coming war as conscription centres are filling up with volunteers to fight for the reconquest of Western Thrace. It seems that war is brewing whether we want it or not..."

 ottfor.7.t: "Terrorist Attacks in Western Thrace"
 ottfor.7.d: "It appears that the Slavs are not the only ones preparing to strike against our great nation as the Turks of our south-eastern provinces are now also rearing their heads.\n\nRandom and badly organised terrorist attacks on Bulgarian officials in the towns of the Muslim dominated province seem to be increasing as local police forces are having issues keeping down the agitated population. Imams scream for war from atop their minbars, whilst banditry and mob violence against Bulgarian shop keepers and citizens increases as the army mobilises to prepare our defences. The situation is near the breaking point and it seems unlikely at this stage that the Ottoman army will not side with the Balkan Pact to "liberate" our Muslim citizens."

 #ottfor.8.d: "The day we feared for has finally arrived, Slavic armies have taken up their arms and the Bulgarian fortifications are cracking under the combined might of the Balkans. Turkish citizens in the south-eastern provinces of Bulgaria have risen up in revolt against their local authority, and volunteers from all across Anatolia are flooding into Edirne to rally behind the Empires cause.\n\nIn Kostantiniyye, pressure is mounting on the Grand Vizier and the Palace to accept the call for war as within the Ottoman Parliament and on the streets of the city, the patriotic chants intensify by the day. The people are ready, the army is ready, all awaiting the Sultan's word, prepared once more to retake the honour of the grand Ottoman Empire!"

### Balkan Military Accords

 ottfor.13.d: "When we were driven out of our European holdings in the late 19th Century and during the First Balkan War, the Balkan nations did not depart with kind feelings. Revanchism, violence and massacres shocked all sides as the Balkans of old were fundamentally changed.\n\nNonetheless, the Ottoman Empire has now recognised that its time in Europe is over and rather than act foolishly out of a desire for revenge, the politicians in Kostantiniyye have chosen a different course. It wishes to build up good relations with its northern neighbours and ensure stability in the Balkan powder keg both for its own and their advantage.\n\nThe Edirne Accords are the means with which the Empire wants to make this, by some called hopelessly romantic and naive, dream reality. Combining both limitations on the ground forces and the fleet, the accords proscribe demobilisation of the large standing armies and a treaty limiting the maximum size of all naval vessels. On top of that, all parties who accept the Accords will also sign a non-aggression pact with each other as such to prevent further inter-Balkan conflict."

Some say the location was chosen symbolically to commemorate the tragic death of Archduke Franz-Ferdinand only a few decades ago, an event which directly led to the world as we know it.\n\nWith timid approval from both sides of the Balkans, a meeting was set up to discuss the possibility of a unified Balkan policy to ensure no threat can rise in the region strong enough to pose an issue. As the meeting wound down to a close, a proposal to both guarantee the independence of the Balkan nations but curb all possible wars or expansion found the most support and has been consolidated in the 'Sarajevo Accords'.

Tucked in between Hungary (Transylvania), Romania and Serbia, the island inhabited solely by Turkish citizens was overlooked after the Russo-Turkish war in the 19th century and as such remained De Jure territory of the Ottoman Empire until 1913 when it was occupied by the Austrian army during the First Balkan War. Nonetheless the Sultan has never ratified this transgression and to break bread with their newfound friends, [AUS.GetLeader] has today decreed the return of the island to the Ottoman Empire where it will become a private possession of the Sultan, free from taxation and conscription.\n\nThe event, the first official meeting between the two monarchs, has been turned into a massive publicity stunt with tens of thousands following the spectacle through a radio show set up explicitly for the occasion. A variety of gifts were exchanged as well with Sultan [TUR.GetLeader] donating one of his personal artworks depicting the skyline of [TUR.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] to the Kaiser and an ornate revolver given to the Sultan in exchange. The ceremony was finally concluded with a 21-gun salute by the Austrian Honour Guard, whose members of Bosnian descent were chosen for their exemplary service during the Weltkrieg."

 ottfor.30.d: "Long keeping an eye on the developing situation in Arabia, the Ottoman Parliament has today spoken out in favour of a military intervention in the Persian Gulf. if its safety can no longer be guaranteed. Widening this zone from Al-Hasa to the Trucial States, this in effect is a demand to both parties to withdraw all forces effective immediately and to hand control over to the Sublime Porte.\n\nLosing these territories would be a disaster for both our national economy and the sustainability of our current nation. but we are also by no means prepared for an intervention by the Ottoman military which can only lead to a catastrophic defeat."

### Baku Accords
 ottfor.31.t: "The Baku Conference"
 ottfor.31.d: "With war raging all around us, the Sublime Porte has in cooperation with representatives from the Azeri government, set up a conference in the vital oil city of Baku. Being both the cause of a breakdown in relations between the two allies, and the glue that can mend them, the Ottoman-Azeri delegation has come up with a possible solution to the issue.\n\nIf we were to relinquish our influence in Azerbaijan and allow it to pursue the closer relations with the Turks it seems so eager to, the Turks would be willing to formally enter the war on our side tipping the scales in the Eastern Mediterranean in our favour. As a show of good favour they are also willing to lease the Baku oil production to us for a period of 25 years if we were to withdraw as soon as possible."

Whilst we won't get the access to the powerful oil deposits of Baku, as the treaty grants these to Germany for a period of 25 years, this is a major victory for all Turkics and has been celebrated with great fanfare in Kostantiniyye."
 ottfor.32.a: "The Pashas influence increases even further!"

 ottfor.33.t: "Germany Withdraws from the Baku Conference"
 ottfor.33.d: "Stating that the Turks are nothing but a dead weight, and that abandoning Azerbaijan would be a catastrophe for the German sphere, their diplomats have formally withdrawn from the conference. An angered mob in the city of Baku, anxiously awaiting white smoke, subsequently attacked German and other Christian shops in a frenzy unseen in recent memory. It seems the dream of Turkic unity is as dead as ever."

 ottfor.34.d: "Placed on the border between Muscat and the former Trucial States, ownership over the Oasis has been a contested affair for many generations between the Sultans of Muscat and the Emirs further North. With the conquest of the latter by Ibn Saud, he has also taken over these old claims and is using them for his own machinations.\n\nIt is no secret however that Ibn Saud is not planning to stop his advance after taking the Oasis, and by claiming that they were once part of the great Wahhabist state, he will surely not stop until the city of Muscat is ablaze and the vile Ikhwan has slaughtered all that oppose him.\n\nAs the further expansion of the Saudis and the collapse of a friendly Arab government would greatly harm Ottoman interests in the region, the wali in Baghdad has requested assistance from the central government so he can defend the sovereignty of the Sultanate of Muscat."

 ottfor.34.b: "We have more worrying threats for now."

 ottfor.35.t.ottomans: "The Ottoman Empire Offers Assistance"
 ottfor.35.d.ottomans: "Aware of the advances by Ibn Saud in our direction, the wali of Baghdad & Basra has offered the assistance of his Padishah in deterring a confrontation between our meagre forces and the Ikhwan. Whilst their support would no doubt go a long way in preventing the fall of Muscat, many are suspicious of the intentions with which the Porte offers this. As Oman has always been one of the - if not the only - Arab state which was able to successfully rebuke full Ottoman occupation, both the Imam and Sultan are weary of a potential Ottoman take-over should we let them in.\n\nOur former partner, the British Empire, sits across the Gulf of Oman and could also prove a benefactor in our cause should we request their assistance. Whilst this move is favoured by the Sultan, the Imam has spoken out against this as it would only lead to the end of our sovereignty and once again assert us as a British puppet."
 ottfor.35.t.no_ottomans: "Silence from the Sublime Porte"
 ottfor.35.d.no_ottomans: "Worrying reports from the seat of the Sunni Caliph as a plea for assistance in the conflict between the armies of Ibn Saud and the Imamate of Oman has been ignored. A blemish on the prestige of the Padishah, it's yet another symbol of the decaying value of the caliphal institution. Not all is lost yet however as our former British allies in the Raj remain a possible path to salvation. Although the Imam is fiercely protesting their involvement, arguing that they only just were capable of overthrowing their shackles, notables in Muscat and the Sultan himself favoured this approach all along."
 ottfor.35.a: "Accept the Ottoman offer."
 ottfor.35.b: "Contact [RAJ.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] for assistance."
 ottfor.35.c: "We will confront this crisis on our own!"

 ottfor.36.t: "Muscat Accepts Our Offer"
 ottfor.36.d: "Answering positively to our offer, the wali in Baghdad has sent orders to the admiral of the fleet in Basra to steam for Muscat and assist the Sultan. Led by Rauf Pasha, the expedition furthermore consists of 1500 soldiers from the Ottoman Sixth Army and German produced armoured cars fit for desert warfare.\n\nWhilst not included as part of a military expedition, a representative of the Turkish Petroleum Company and various members of the bureaucratic corps have been sent along to influence the Muscati government and hopefully retrieve a 'reward' for our assistance."
 ottfor.36.a: "Good luck Pasha!"

 ottfor.37.t: "Oman Refuses Our Offer"
 ottfor.37.d: "The Muscati government has decided to refuse our assistance and bear the Saudis all on their own. Whilst this is a less desirable turn of events, there is nothing we can do to change their mind."

With the conquest of the latter by Ibn Saud, he has also taken over these old claims and is using them for his own machinations.\n\nIt is no secret however that Ibn Saud is not planning to stop his advance after taking the Oasis and by claiming that we were once part of the great Wahhabist state, he will surely not stop until the city of Muscat is ablaze and the vile Ikhwan has slaughtered all that oppose him.\n\nTo protect them from this threat, the Sultan of Muscat has requested assistance from us to ward of the Ikhwan. Knowing perfectly well what this would entail for his little state, this will firmly pull the Gulf of Oman within Entente influence and could as such be beneficial for us."
 ottfor.38.a: "Assist the Sultan."
 ottfor.38.b: "We have other priorities."

 ottfor.39.a: "We are grateful."

 ottfor.40.t: "The British Raj Refrains from Intervening"
 ottfor.40.d.ottomans: "The government in [RAJ.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] has decided that aiding us is not in their best interests and has as such refused to send any reinforcements. The offer of the Porte still stands and many now believe that we have no choice but to accept their aid, although Omani nationalists have urged for us to take on the Saudis by ourselves."
 ottfor.40.d.no_ottomans: "The government in [RAJ.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] has decided that aiding us is not in their best interests and has as such refused to send any reinforcements. With no aid coming from the Porte either, it seems we will need to take on the Saudis alone..."

 ottfor.40.b: "Then we will defend our homes by ourselves!"

 ottfor.41.t: "The Fall of Nizwa"
 ottfor.41.d.OTT: "Although the troops under Admiral Rauf Pasha were sent to defend the entirety of Muscat and Oman from the encroaching forces of Ibn Saud, the strong resistance of the Omani interior against Ottoman troops on their soil has led to them exerting little protection outside of the urban centres of the Muscati coastline.\n\nThese tribes, loyal to their Imam in Nizwa have stubbornly continued fighting the Ikhwan on their own, but have earlier today been forced to surrender to Ibn Saud, when their capital fell after a two week siege. Gruesome reports of Ikhwan soldiers gutting open Ibadi resistance fighters, and the trail of destruction left in their wake (most notably in Nizwa which was burnt to the ground) has frightened the Ottoman detachment and the Sultan of Muscat alike.\n\nRauf Pasha, believing that the only way to protect Muscat is greater Ottoman commitment to the theatre, has requested further reinforcements from Basra and has drafted plans to sideline the Sultan and establish the Ottoman army as the real authority on the ground. Having lost a significant portion of their fighting power, there is little that the Muscatis can do to resist this but many in Kostantiniyye have expressed their caution at further overextension and are instead calling for a retreat towards Basra (as such leaving Muscat an easy prey for the Saudis)."

 ottfor.410.d: "Threathened by our intrusion on what he falsely claims are his domains, the Sultan of Muscat has sent out a call for aid to [OMA_guarantor.GetNameDefCap]. Through communication with merchants in al-Hasa and agents in Muscat itself, it has now been confirmed that troops from [OMA_guarantor.GetNameDefCap] have arrived in the Sultanate and are preparing to defend it from our operations.\n\nSharp division remains in the region however as the Imam of Oman, ruling from Nizwa, has flatly rejected the offer from Muscat as he fears that it may lead to the end of the Imamate and a reassertion of control by the Sultan over the Omani hinterland. This thus leaves us a window of opportunity in which we can strike at the Imamate without repurcussions, forestalling the formation of a true United Front between Imam and Sultan."
 ottfor.410.a: "We must act quickly."

 ottfor.411.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Intervenes"
 ottfor.411.d: "A foreign naval detachement arrived in the harbour of Muscat today, reinforcing the already present troops of [OMA_guarantor.GetNameDefCap]. Clearly symbolising that they will not allow the Sultanate of Muscat to suffer the same fate as the Omani Imamate, they demand the immediate withdrawal of our troops from its territory. Aware that they lack the manpower to wage a war in the Omani hinterland, they seem willing to recognise our authority over the region although an official confirmation of the rightful border correction remains absent.\n\nRegardless, whilst our armies have proven their mettle against the Omanis, they lack the modern equipment that [OMA_guarantor.GetNameDefCap] brings to the field and as such it would be prudent for us to accept their 'offer' and consolidate our forces."
 ottfor.411.a: "Back down, we cannot fight them."
 ottfor.411.b: "They shall fall before the Ikhwan."

 ottfor.412.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Refuses to Back Down"

Ships were rapidly loaded, flags lowered and last farewells given as foreign troops left the port of Muscat in a hurry. This betrayal which will go into the history books as one of the worst affronts to Muscat and its people ensures that the proud state of Muscat is now forever doomed in the clutches of Ibn Saud."

 ottfor.414.d: "Shocking Muscati onlookers, the so-called protectors of Muscat gave their last adieu to the Sultan today as troops and equipment were rapidly loaded on ships bound for the Persian Gulf. The Sultan, already struggling to control his own population has now been completely left to his own fate. A fate which will soon be decided upon by the Ikhwan"
 ottfor.414.a: "As expected."

 ottfor.415.t: "Dhofar is Vulnerable"
 ottfor.415.d: "With the Sultan rapidly losing control over his own country in favour of foreign advisors, the Imam has seen an opportunity to reassert long slumbering claims on the border region of Dhofar. Whilst risky and without doubt resulting in prolonged conflict with the Muscati government, they are currently in no position to offer much resistance."

### Mt Ararat Conflict
 ottfor.43.t: "The Ararat Debacle"
 ottfor.43.d: "With a Kurdish insurrection spread out all across Eastern Anatolia, a difficult pain-point has been the border with Iran and more specifically the status of Mt Ararat. Whilst we control the Western and Southern slopes of the mountain, the North and East lay in sovereign Iranian land. This has been cleverly abused by the Kurdish rebels who are using these slopes as a way to resupply their forces fighting in the vicinity of the mountain.\n\nThis has reportedly frustrated our Grand Vizier so much that he has demanded his ambassador in Teheran to immediately put an end to this indirect Iranian support for the movement or Kostantiniyye will assume "liberty of action" and take matters into their own hands."

Whilst the Turks control the Western and Southern slopes of the mountain, the North and East lay in sovereign Iranian land. This has been cleverly abused by the Kurdish rebels who are using these slopes as a way to resupply their forces fighting in the vicinity of the mountain.\n\nTo hasten the defeat of their Kurdish rebels, Kostantiniyye has now demanded that either we crack down on Kurdish activity in the region in their name or allow free passage of the Turkish army to all sides of the mountain. If we are to refuse either of these suggestions, Kostantiniyye has warned us that it would assume "liberty of action", likely ignoring the border and potentially coming into conflict with our troops in the region."

 ottfor.45.d: "Unwilling to get into conflict with our army, the authorities in Tabriz have instructed all Kurdish insurgents (Iranian and Ottoman) either to return immediately to Anatolia to fight or to lay down their arms. Receiving a less ideal reception from its Kurdish population, Iranian authorities have commenced the deportation of Kurdish communities around Khoi and other border regions to prevent an escalation between the two great powers of the Middle East."

 ottfor.46.t: "Iran Refuses Our Demands"
 ottfor.46.d: "It seems Teheran has not been scared off by our demands, and they resolutely refuse to allow our troops passage into their lands. Furthermore, they have instructed authorities in Tabriz that they should assist the Kurdish groups, in the hope of further destabilising the Eastern Provinces of the Ottoman Empire.\n\nOutraged by this refusal, an emergency session of the cabinet voted with a clear majority in favour of military intervention in the region. With their new mandate, Ottoman commanders in the region have been granted permission by the government to disregard the Ottoman-Iranian border and encircle the remaining Kurds on Mt Ararat."
 ottfor.46.a: "The revolt ends here!"

 ottfor.47.t: "Ottoman Troops Cross the Border"
 ottfor.47.d: "Despite our earlier warnings, it seems that the Porte has nonetheless decided to infringe on sovereign Iranian territory and given the order to fully encircle Mount Ararat. Whilst authorities in Tabriz are advising the government that we should avoid open conflict between Teheran and Kostantiniyye, in the capital a fear lingers that by backing down now, we will look weak and open ourselves up to another wave of internal unrest."

Two main options have presented themselves although a third option, occupation by the German Empire, has also been outed by German diplomats.\n\nThe first option would result in the recreation of an international zone around the Suez Canal, now without concessions in Palestine, tasked with the protection and maintenance of the Suez Canal. This zone, for whom the great powers that be (and the Ottoman Empire) would be responsible in terms of protection, would be governed as a free state where foreign investors can have free rein (albeit within the limits of the law).\n\nThe second option, preferred by the Ottoman state, is the integration of the Canal Zone into its domain but with various concessions and restrictions granted to foreign nations. So foreign warships would be allowed to pass in peacetime, trade never obstructed (even in wartime) and the Suez company would retain majority shares in the Canal. Foreign diplomats have been less open to this plan however, as they fear that this will make the canal reliant on the whims of a struggling nation and potentially greatly endanger their supply lines during times of war."

This zone, for whom the great powers that be (and the Ottoman Empire) would be responsible in terms of protection, will be governed as a free state where foreign investors can have free rein (albeit within the limits of the law).\n\nAlthough a great victory for all non-Turkish nations, the Canal still remains out of operation as debris and sabotage actions caused by the war have left it unusable to most modern shipping.

The Russian bear, fuelled by revanchism towards its former territories in Eastern Europe and the Caucasus, has opened its final offensives, trying to break open the Ostwall.\n\nOur German alignment, a tool in the previous war, is now more a threat to our survival than a means of defence and with our nation incapable of fighting on all fronts at once, a diplomatic solution must be found. A Russo-Ottoman treaty, aimed at delineating the spheres of influence of our great Empires must serve as a non-aggression pact, a secret deal between two governments.\n\nWhilst it remains unclear whether the Russians will be enticed by such propositions, our government feels like it is at least worth a shot."

By doing so however, we are likely to infringe on the Turkish sphere of influence, an action with as of yet unclear consequences.\n\nThe Turks are weak, recovering from decades of warfare and economic devastation, but their armies still stand, and it may be in our best interests to ensure our Southern flank cannot be exploited by German allies. Therefore the foreign ministry has come up with a plan to divide the Caucasus and Eastern Middle East between our two empires, including a 10-year non-aggression pact with the Ottoman Turks which should bar their intervention in the Russo-German war."

Although animus on both sides for a peaceful resolution is high, it seems unlikely that an agreement can be found as the overlapping demands stemming from centuries of Russo-Ottoman conflicts may prove too deep a wound to ever heal."

Linked up to Azerbaijan through railroads and the Baku-Poti pipeline, it furthermore serves a key station for refuelling our troops fighting deep into Ukraine and a fortification that can threaten the Ottoman Empire.\n\nAlthough none question that Georgia should one way or another return to the Russian sphere, there remains division as to whether it should serve as an allied state or an integrated part of [RUS.GetNameDef].

 ottfor.61.d: "Conquered by the Russian Empire in the 19th century, the important port city of Batumi was regained by the Ottoman Empire with the treaty of Brest-Litovsk. This city, traditionally a bulwark of economic power in the Caucasus and a symbol of great pride for the Georgian people, could not just prove a valuable card to play in negotiation with the Georgian government but also serve as a way to bypass the Turkish defensive lines.\n\nIt is however highly unlikely that the Turks would accept this demand, sacrificing the defensibility of their realm and giving up one of their only gains in the Weltkrieg, so many have urged to move around this touchy subject and leave it open for future negotiations."

This city, with its surrounding lands, was seen as the rallying point for Turkish nationalists in the interwar as its restoration to the Ottoman Empire was seen as one of the greatest victories of the CUP during the Weltkrieg.\n\nWith Russia bearing down on us once more however, they have decided to incorporate Batumi and the province of Lazistan as part of their claim on Georgia, demanding that we hand over this piece of land in the spirit of open negotiation. A quasi impossible offer, the Russians are very well aware that they are presenting us with no choice at all if we wish to maintain the trust of our people."

With the British Empire crushed by the unrelenting red tide, their power to contest our influence in Kabul has all but evaporated, as such leaving India ripe for the takings.\n\nAlthough we don't need the permission of the Turks to exert our claims on Afghanistan, the acknowledgment of the Sultan-Caliph would go a long way in boosting the legitimacy of our take-over and divide existing Islamic ties."

Whilst this offer has not been outright rejected, hawks in Moscow are pushing for a stricter delineation and the split of the Iranian nation in spheres of influence, much like the old convention.

While observers initially believed that the conference would be fruitful, with the outbreak of war, the demands outlined in the meeting seemed to have fallen apart, and all efforts at peace and negotiation have collapsed.

Citing their historical alliance with Germany during the First Weltkrieg and their concern for Russian territorial ambition, the Ottoman state has effectively joined the Reichspakt as a powerful ally - giving Germany access to the Middle East. As Russia's foreign policy involves the retaking of Russian lands currently under the German sphere - there will be no doubt that all attempts at peace between the Russian and Ottoman nations will end. The two countries will come to blows once more, a sad but consequential truth as both nation's foreign policies cannot find agreement."

With Russian intentions to absorb the Azeri state into their empire, claiming a need for fuel and the restoration of old Russian lands, Turkish and Azeri diplomats have been hard at work to develop a plan wherein Azerbaijan can serve as a buffer state between the two empires. This plan, which includes Russian rights to the exploitation of Azeri oil for the duration of the Russo-German war and a lease for 10 years afterwards, has been positively received by the Ottoman government, but has thus far failed to convince Moscow.

Two decades have passed since then and with Russia restoring its glory of old, hawks in our government have urged us to blow off the deal with the Ottoman Turks by demanding the liberation of Armenia, a demand we are sure they will refuse, and plant the banner of Mother Russia on the ramparts of [TUR.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]."

To accommodate to the needs of the Muslim population in Greece however, and the Greeks 'left behind' by their government, a new immigration policy has been worked out that grants Greek and Turkish citizens the rights to freely choose their country and receive compensation for any possessions left behind.

### Inform about getting defense

 ottfor.94.d: "Once more foreigners threaten the lands of the Ottoman Caliph, the time has come for all Ottoman citizens to take up arms and defend their fair lands. As the drums and trumpets echo over the hills of Anatolia, the Unstoppable Horde rallies one last time. For their homes, for their Sultan and for eternal glory!"

 ottfor.96.d: "Facing a potential defeat at the hands of Iran, the [From.Owner.GetName] has petitioned our Government to assist them in their war against Iran citing the strong cultural links between our two nations and highlighting the strategic concern that a victorious Iran could pose against our independence- the [From.Owner.GetName] claims that Iran would surely seek our annexation in the event of an Ottoman defeat in the Desert War.\n\nThere are significant calls from within our Government and Army to heed the Ottoman request for aid and unite with our Azeri brothers currently held captive by Iran however it is necessary to exercise caution — entering the war now could have catastrophic consequences if our army is unprepared to deal with the Iranian threat. "
 ottfor.96.a: "A perfect opportunity to recover our southern territories!"
 ottfor.96.b: "This is too risky."

 ottfor.97.t: "[From.Owner.GetName] Joins the War"
 ottfor.97.d: "In a victory for Ottoman diplomacy, Azerbaijan has accepted our request for aid and has formally declared war on Iran. As compensation for their assistance, Azerbaijan has requested that the Azeri territories in Iran are allowed to be united with Azerbaijan - a reasonable request that will surely be honoured after our victory. With the help of our turkic brothers, we will certainly triumph against the Iranian menace."
 ottfor.97.a: "Excellent."

 ottfor.98.t: "[From.Owner.GetName] Refuses to Attack Persia"
 ottfor.98.d: "Azerbaijan has foolishly decided to ignore our request for aid against Iran, claiming that the situation is too dangerous for Azerbaijan to enter into a state of war against Iran. This betrayal, after all we have done to assist Azerbaijan. will not be forgotten. Regardless, we shall have to continue our struggle against the Iranian menace alone."
 ottfor.98.a: "Will no one stand by us?"

 ottfor.100.t: "[From.Owner.GetName] Plans to Attack"
 ottfor.100.d: "Pushed on the back foot, the Ottomans, according to our intelligence, have begun talks with Azerbaijan to open a second front in our north, and promise Iranian Azerbaijan to the Azeris. We must begin preparations against a potential assault immediately!"
 ottfor.100.a: "Bastards"

### State Descriptions ###
 OTT_Population_Istanbul: "Majority Culture: §YTurkish§!, Greek, Armenian\nMajority Religion: §YSunni Muslim§!, Orthodox Christian"
 OTT_Population_Istanbul_desc: "Known for centuries as the melting pot of peoples and civilisations from all across Europe and the Middle East, the shining city of Kostantiniyye is the capital of our proud empire and the seat of power for our Sultan-Caliph. Although predominately inhabited by Turkish people, a significant minority of Greek and Armenian citizens reside in the city profiting from the valuable trade routes passing through.\n\nPolitical opinion is divided within the city walls as the majority of the Turkish populace is widely regarded as in favour of the Centralising reforms, although significant portions of its plethora of ethnic minorities fear for an increasing degree of Turkification, and the loss of their special status. What they all share however is a disdain for the Anatolian peasants toiling away in the hinterland, which has caused a significant rift between the enlightened bourgeoisie of the capital and the hard reality on the ground."

 OTT_Population_Edirne: "Majority Culture: §YTurkish§!, Greek, Bulgarian\nMajority Religion: §YSunni Muslim§!, Orthodox Christian"
 OTT_Population_Edirne_desc: "Birthplace of Sultan Mehmed II, conqueror of Constantinople, the city of Edirne and its accompanying lands hold a special place in the hearts of the Ottoman people. Serving as a vital fortress during the Balkan wars and as the springboard for Envers rise to power in the 1913 coup, the old capital of the Empire is all what remains of the once prosperous Edirne Elayet and in the eyes of many the last holdout of the Ottoman Empire on the European continent.\n\nIts population holds a diverse array of ethnicities ranging from Turkish to Greek to Bulgarian to even Polish, although the majority still remains Turkish as substantial efforts to push out Bulgarian citizens during much of the early century and the influx of Balkan refugees has greatly diminished the non-Muslim population. Greek hawks further to the West however, have long claimed the region as part of their nation, insinuating that the large Greek minority living there and the historical dominance of the Byzantine Empire over it make for a rightful Greek territory."

 OTT_Population_Bursa: "Majority Culture: §YTurkish§!, Greek\nMajority Religion: §YSunni Muslim§!, Orthodox Christian"
 OTT_Population_Bursa_desc: "Described by foreign visitors as one of the most prosperous regions of Anatolia, the Bursa or Hüdavendigâr Vilayet is widely known for his agricultural output. Silk is however where it derives its most fame from as the city of Bursa is the heart of Ottoman silk production, derived from silk worms first obtained from French merchants. Recent discoveries in metallurgy have given the region a second boost as the Chromite ore, plentiful in the South of the Vilayet, is in high demand for the war machines of both Germany and France.\n\nMuch like other vilayets close to the Aegean, a close cooperation exists between the Christians living on the coasts of the Sea of Marmara and the Turkish Muslims occupying its highlands. Tensions remain high between the two groups however as the mass deportations and massacres of the Weltkrieg remain all the more vivid in the minds of the severely weakened and exhausted Greek population."

 OTT_Population_Sinop: "Majority Culture: §YTurkish§!, Greek\nMajority Religion: §YSunni Muslim§!, Orthodox Christian"
 OTT_Population_Sinop_desc: "Although possessing the fertile ground for a large agricultural output, the Vilayet of Kastamonu is not seen as a rich province. Whilst its population is almost entirely Turkish, there is a small minority of Greeks around the city of Sinop that controls most of the shipping in the city. Overall it's an impoverished but content region, as the people there seem distant from the hectic life in the urban centres of the Aegean, and live with only the bare necessities of life. Little investment was done in the region before the discovery of coal near Zonguldak, which was exploited to its fullest during the Weltkrieg, until bombardments of its harbour forced the Ottomans to halt their coal transports.\n\nThe loyalty of the people to the reforming Ottoman nation stands strong, as the small urban population of the Vilayet has shown their support for Kemal's reforms, whilst the much larger rural population has shown no real desire to get entangled in politics and refrains from forming any real opposition."

 OTT_Population_Izmir: "Majority Culture: §YTurkish§!, Greek\nMajority Religion: §YSunni Muslim§!, Orthodox Christian"
 OTT_Population_Izmir_desc: "Constituting of the city of Izmir or Smyrna as it is known to the Greeks, the Aidin Vilayet is ethnically the most divisive Vilayet in Turkish Anatolia. As it stretches deep into the mainland, Greek citizens of the coastline and abroad have long complained about the arbitrary census reports that according to them are designed in such a way to drown out the Greek minority of the coastline. They argue that if we look at the entire Vilayet, the population is predominately Muslim and Turkish, although this neglects the importance of the Greek population which represents the majority of the Vilayets economic power.\n\nNot only ethnically, but also politically, the population is divided, as Muslim inhabitants have shown their desire for continued centralisation in the hopes of encouraging social promotion of the comparatively poorer Muslim population. Greek citizens on the other hand are conflicted as they agree with the OHFs progressive stance on religion and legal affairs, but fear that continued centralisation could lead to the abolition of the Millet system and increased Turkification."

 OTT_Population_Mugla: "Majority Culture: §YTurkish§!\nMajority Religion: §YSunni Muslim§!"
 OTT_Population_Mugla_desc: "Relatively sparsely populated and disconnected from the rest of Anatolia due to the lack of an expansive railway and road network, this small Sandjak does not boast the impressive economic power of the Aidin Vilayet, but has nonetheless made a name for itself in the agricultural and mining sectors. Centred around Marmaris, the region is known for its honey production and extensive beekeeping culture, whilst the Southern districts mainly profit from the cultivation of citrus products. Mining also has a presence in the Sandjak as the city of Mugla is one of the Empire most renowned centres of Marble, and the Chromite extraction is steadily growing in Fethiye.\n\nPolitically the region supports the Kemalist agenda, especially their interventionist economic policies, in the hopes that heavy-handed state development can further develop the still fairly backwards region."

 OTT_Population_Afyon: "Majority Culture: §YTurkish§!\nMajority Religion: §YSunni Muslim§!"
 OTT_Population_Afyon_desc: "Tucked away in the Anatolian highlands, the region of Afyon is one the richest parts of the Ottoman Empire, deriving its economic power and fame from the Marble extraction which sires famous landmarks across the world from the Haghia Sophia to St. Peter's Basilica. Furthermore, it is one of the most productive agricultural regions of the Empire, and is famed for its cultivation of Opium, from where the name Afyon is derived.\n\nIt is a content and prospering region, with recent importance of its mineral reserves putting it on the forefront of state development. The people, almost entirely Muslims of Turkish ethnicity, don't have much interaction with the various ethnic groups of the empire, and have thus been mostly spared from the conflict between these groups. Supporting the OHF in parliament, the deputies of the region are seen as loyal to the party and form no real opposition to the centralising reforms."

 OTT_Population_Konya: "Majority Culture: §YTurkish§!\nMajority Religion: §YSunni Muslim§!"
 OTT_Population_Konya_desc: "Serving as a centre of agriculture for the Turkish population, the Konya Vilayet is not a rich one, as any forms of real industry remain absent from the region. The population, although Muslim in religion, consists of a wide variety of ethnicities as it was settled by Circassians, Albanians and other European Muslims after those were driven from their lands. They are a distrustful people, deeply loyal to the Ottoman Empire that took them in but weary of the influence non-Muslims hold within the empire, especially the Greek minority which is mostly centred around the city of Konya and the Antalya coastline."

 OTT_Population_Ankara: "Majority Culture: §YTurkish§!\nMajority Religion: §YSunni Muslim§!"
 OTT_Population_Ankara_desc: "One of the poorest regions of the empire, the central Vilayet of Ankara is impoverished, distant from the capital and discontent with the status quo. Although connected by railroad to the capital, it has only led to a decrease in local manufacturing, as merchants and traders now export their raw materials directly instead of promoting local artisans. Shaken up by the violent deportations and massacres of Armenians and Greeks as well, the middle class of the region further received a hit during the Weltkrieg, driving its already low economic status, literacy and population density have only further down.\n\nAlthough serving as the footmen in the Ottoman army and experiencing massacres at the hand of the Entente invaders during the Weltkrieg, its people remain loyal to the Ottoman state and populist rhetoric by Kemal Pasha promising a strong response to the continued issues, has swung them firmly inside the camp of the OHF, as not only its interventionist agenda speaks to the minds of the people, but many of them served directly under him during the last days of the Weltkrieg and see in him the future of their nation."

 OTT_Population_Adana: "Majority Culture: §YTurkish§!, Arab (Syrian), Armenian\nMajority Religion: §YSunni Muslim§!, Alawite, Orthodox Christian"
 OTT_Population_Adana_desc: "Once part of the Cilician Armenia, the Vilayet of Adana was created after the Egyptian forces under Muhammed Ali invaded the Ottoman Empire and marched their armies all the way up the Lebanese coast. As one of the first industrialised regions of the empire, the Vilayet represents a significant portion of the Ottoman industrial base, as its location in the centre of the Turkish and Arab regions, and its connection by railroad and ship prove it to be the perfect location. Unexploited mineral resources furthermore linger in its highlands awaiting further exploitation.\n\nOne cannot deny the severity with which the region was hit during the Weltkrieg as its prosperous Armenian population, responsible for much of the aforementioned industry, evaporated overnight as deportations and massacres culled the majority of them. As the war approached its end however, and the likelihood of an Entente victory decreased, some of the thousands that were forced to leave all their belongings behind were allowed to return to the region seeing their properties confiscated and their rights stripped. Those that are left remain bitter and with a desire for revenge but their almost negligible population counts have eroded their capacity to organise any significant opposition to their Muslim administrators."

 OTT_Population_Samson: "Majority Culture: §YTurkish§!, Greek (Pontic)\nMajority Religion: §YSunni Muslim§!, Orthodox Christian"
 OTT_Population_Samson_desc: "Home to the Pontic Greeks, the Trabzon Vilayet was once one of the most powerful economic regions of the Empire, deriving its wealth from the nascent industry in Samsun and Trabzon and the flourishing Greek merchant class which controlled both the fishing and trade on the Black Sea. Just as in the other Christian regions of the empire though, the deportations and massacres struck deep as the Pontic Greeks were targeted by the plans of Talaat Pasha. Contrary to the Armenian population however, the majority of the Greek population survived the massacres, and although refugees have been fleeing the region ever since the start of the Weltkrieg, the recent improvements in Greek-Ottoman relations and the flourishing economy have ensured a slow recovery of the pre-war Greek population.\n\nTensions remain high between the Muslim majority and the Greek minority as the latter's political status and wealth is met with jealousy from the poor Turkish inland sandjaks. This tension is also reflected in Kostantiniyye, as the Greeks flock to the banner of the OPAD in the hopes that their decentralisation programme will protect them in the future. The Turkish majority however, has found solace in the rhetoric of Mustafa Kemal, who promises a stronger Turkish people and state directed programmes to assist the impoverished Turks."

 OTT_Population_Sivas: "Majority Culture: §YTurkish§!, Kurdish\nMajority Religion: §YAlevi§!, Sunni Muslim"
 OTT_Population_Sivas_desc: "In poverty only second to Ankara, the Vilayet of Sivas is not a glamorous part of the Empire, and more often than not forgotten about in the capital. Its population, predominately Turkish peasants after the Armenian Massacres eradicated its middle class, is often used as one of the main manpower pools of the Empire as its population remains deeply loyal to the Ottoman government.\n\nPolitically the population, much like the other rural areas of Anatolia, has spoken out in favour of Kemal whose prestige and status during the final days of the Weltkrieg remains burned into their minds. Not only his success on the field flocks the Sivan population to his flag, as his plans to tackle religion in the empire have given hope to the Alevi population that their constant struggle with the Sunnis might finally come to an end."

 OTT_Population_Batumi_desc: "The ancient port city of Batumi lies on the coast of the Black Sea, between the mouth of the Çoruh River to its south and a natural harbour to its north. It is known for the high quality lemons that grow in the orchards around the town, and the botanical garden that was founded in 1912 grows all sorts of exotic plants and flora from the Caucasus. It came under the rule of the Sublime Porte in the 16th century, but it was lost in the war against Russia in 1878. With the victory in the Weltkrieg and the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, it was returned to the Empire. Its harbour being a centre for trade on the periphery of the realm and the border to the Caucasus, Batumi's population is a diverse mix of Armenians, Turks, Russians, Greeks and the slight majority of Georgians. While economic interests bring the inhabitants together, the neighbouring state of Georgia has its eyes on what they believe to be rightfully theirs."

 OTT_Population_Lazistan_desc: "Inhabited by the Kartvelian Lazi minority, the Sandjak of Lazistan was a cosmopolitan society consisting of Greek, Turkish, Kurdish, Georgian, Armenian and Lazi people. Originally even claimed by the Armenian state, very little remains of its non-Muslim population as the massacres struck the area hard and thousands of Armenians were slaughtered during the Weltkrieg. Reprisals by Russo-Armenian troops before the 1917 revolution made matters even worse as the already exhausted population suffered another hit, now to its Sunni population. As the end of the Weltkrieg arrived for the Lazi people, their lands have been ravaged by war and constant migration. Their economy, based on agriculture (mainly the export of hazelnuts) and the exploitation of the Zinc mines, has not aged well either as many have permanently left the region in search of better lands.\n\nThe Lazi people share many similarities with the Georgian people further up North, and although the difference in religion between Christian Georgia and Muslim Lazistan have thus far led to little cooperation between the two regions, Georgian spies have been caught in the region who have supposedly been attempting to gather support for an anti-Ottoman insurrection. Their attempts seem to have failed however thus far as the Lazis are fairly content with our rule and have little faith in Georgian rule."

 OTT_Population_Kars: "Majority Culture: §YTurkish§!, Kurdish, Armenian\nMajority Religion: §YSunni Muslim§!, Orthodox Christian"
 OTT_Population_Kars_desc: "The Vilayet of Kars was seized by the Russian Empire after our defeat in the Russo-Ottoman War and has only fairly recently returned to the Empire. During decades of rule by the Russians and their Armenian allies, Armenians became a substantial minority in the Kars Oblast, making up as much as 30% of its population at the dawn of the century.\n\nWhilst the Weltkrieg has not been kind to the Empire's Armenian population, the people of Kars spent much of the conflict under Russian occupation and were thus largely spared from its hardships and atrocities. Following Russia's collapse into civil war and the subsequent Ottoman reclamation of the Empire's eastern territories, however, a fear of persecution led many Armenians to flee towards the east, hoping to find refuge in the mountains of their homeland. Nonetheless, with the war nearing its end and an Ottoman victory on the horizon, those who stayed behind were mostly left unharmed. Because of this, Armenians to this day make up a sizeable portion of the local folk in the eastern parts of the province, with the remainder of the population mainly consisting of Muslim Turks and a Kurdish minority loyal to the Ottoman regime that has saved them from Russian advances and the Armenian reprisals.\n\nIts economy is solely based on agriculture, with the majority of its lands devoted to the cultivation of grain and the remaining part used for animal husbandry. Around the pastures of Ardahan and Kars, there is also a sizeable beekeeping culture, although its effects on the overall economy remain fairly low."

 OTT_Population_Diyarbakir: "Majority Culture: §YKurdish§!, Turkish, Arab (Syrian)\nMajority Religion: §YSunni Muslim§!"
 OTT_Population_Diyarbakir_desc: "Part of the Kurdish core territories, the region of Diyarbakir is a prosperous albeit, agrarian, region as its capital, the city of Diyarbakir, is known as an important centre of learning and important city for the Muslim faith. Home of the Diyarbakir Ulu Camii, the fifth holiest site in Islam and one of the oldest churches in the world, the city and its region suffered greatly during the last years of the Weltkrieg, as illness, fire and misery plagued its population.\n\nServing as an important strategic location for the Ottoman armed forces on the Eastern flank of the Empire, it is closely supervised by the Empire in the hopes of avoiding another confrontation with the Kurdish people. Resistance to Kostantiniyye remains little for the moment, but fears of the far reaching secularisation promoted by the OHF and the centralised control rule within the Kurdish region, as they are afraid that without the uniting factor of the Caliphate, the Turks will slowly but surely push them out."

 OTT_Population_Van: "Majority Culture: §YKurdish§!, Turkish\nMajority Religion: §YSunni Muslim§!"
 OTT_Population_Van_desc: "Home to the largest concentration of Armenians pre-Weltkrieg, the Vilayet of Van can be seen as one of the most contested battlefields of the Caucasian campaign swapping hands between Russian and Ottoman forces on multiple occasions. Where other Vilayets were affected to varying degrees by the ethnic cleansing, Van has been the centrepiece of some of the worst massacres as both Ottoman and Armenian forces slaughtered without impunity, drastically reducing the population of the region. Especially the city of Van itself, home to a sizeable Armenian population, was decimated as the advancing Ottoman troops during 1918 put 55,000 Armenians to the sword. It goes without saying that the memory of these massacres is still deeply rooted in the consciousness of the local population and although the remainder, now fully Muslim of Kurdish and Turkish descent, is loyal to the Empire, a certain fear lingers within the Kurdish population that a far-reaching secularisation and dismantlement of the Islamic unity on which the Empire stands, could lead to them being next in another series of attacks."

 OTT_Population_Kirkuk_desc: "Located between the Kurdish dominated Sulaymaniyah and the Arab Mosul, a small sliver of Turkomans continue to hold on. Dating back to the days of the great Turkish conquerors, this region was populated by soldiers from their armies after the wars were over. Developing into their own distinct culture, they are quite different from the Anatolian Turks to the North and are in some regards closer to the steppe people further East.\n\nThis otherwise irrelevant part of the Ottoman Empire was brought into the spotlight just before the Weltkrieg, when rumours of oil near the city of Kirkuk started spreading. As the war ended in 1920 and the Ottoman government was more than eager to find a new source of revenue, exploration was started. Oil was struck on October 14th 1922, near the city of Kirkuk, giving way to the extensive drilling operations later established throughout the region. Funded with this new black gold, the city of Kirkuk became the third most important city in Iraq and has been granted a special statute by the central government to oversee and guard the operations. Many Turkomans are furthermore also employed in the Ottoman Gendarmerie and the army to combat the constant issues with the Kurdish population at the Iranian frontier."

 OTT_Population_Erzurum_desc: "Constituting of a mix between the Vilayets of Erzurum, Harput and Trabzon, the reformed Vilayet of Erzurum was created in 1922 in an effort to reorganise some of the Empire eastern holdings. Relying for almost its entire economic output on animal husbandry and the cultivation of wheat and linseed, it is by no means a modern Vilayet, and it has been lagging behind many of its neighbouring regions industrially.\n\nNonetheless it serves as an important region for the Ottoman army, as the strategic location of the city of Erzurum has time upon time proven its worth, most notably during the Weltkrieg, when Yudenich's Russian forces assaulted the city in 1916. Whilst the fortress did not stand the Russian onslaught, it was recaptured in 1918 and has since then been reinforced to once again serve as the last line of defence for the Caucasian campaign."

 OTT_Population_Dodecanese: "Majority Culture: §YGreek§!, Turkish\nMajority Religion: §YOrthodox§!, Sunni Muslim"
 OTT_Population_Dodecanese_desc: "Consisting of the islands Rhodes, Kos, Patmos and various other smaller ones, the islands of the Dodecanese have long enjoyed a privileged status in the Ottoman Empire dating back to an edict of Suleiman forbidding interference of Ottoman generals in their affairs, after the isles were taken from the Knights Hospitaller in 1522.\n\nThe islands are however inhabited by a strong Greek majority, and although its special status was preserved far into the 19th Century, the Young Turks finally abolished it in 1908 during their efforts to centralise the state. Issues with Kostantiniyye quickly rose afterwards, and movements clamouring for the unification with Greece gained further traction throughout the region.\n\nAlthough its people have been staunch supporters of unification with Greece, the isles prospered greatly during the 19th century, becoming a hub for many rich Greeks in the Empire to relax and deal in lucrative trade with the Eastern Mediterranean.\n\nLost during the Italo-Ottoman war in 1912, the isles served under Italian military administration for almost ten years when they were formally returned to the Empire with its pre-war status restored as part of the Vilayet of the Archipelago."

Its main economic contribution, found in the rich fertile lands to the South-East of the city, consists of agriculture, which it ships out of the region through the ports of Haifa and Beirut.\n\nDeep distrust between the Turkish authorities and the local Arab population still lingers after the city's betrayal during the Empire's darkest days in 1918, when the gates were opened to the advancing Commonwealth army. The Druze further South in Jabal Al-Druze also continue to pose an issue, as repeated attempts to disarm the population and bring them into the fold have netted little success."

 OTT_Population_Mosul: "Majority Culture: §YArab (Iraqi)§!, Turkoman, Kurdish\nMajority Religion: §YSunni Muslim§!"
 OTT_Population_Mosul_desc: "Standing on the west bank of the Tigris, the city of Mosul and its surrounding lands form an important trading hub on the road from India to the Mediterranean. The region itself is mostly important for the production of cotton products, but has seen a new growing sector spring up in recent years. The black gold, flowing plentifully from the deposits near Kirkuk, has also been found near Mosul and exploitation of this is a hotly discussed topic.\n\nDue to its close ties with the Anatolian hinterland and the city of Aleppo further upstream, the region has experienced little of the Arab nationalist rhetoric. Nonetheless in the city itself, a variety of cultural groups promote the use of Arabic. Its important position on the Persian frontier, and as first line of defence against trouble in the Kurdish territories, have furthermore made it into a formidable base for the Ottoman army. Many lower-class families have used this presence to grow in the social ladder and encourage their children to attend the Military Academy in the city."

 OTT_Population_Sulaymaniyah_desc: "Trouble child of the Ottoman Empire, the region of Sulaymaniyah is almost constantly plagued by issues between the various Kurdish tribes inhabiting it. Careful manipulating of these conflicts has been the role of the representative in the city of Sulaymaniyah since forever, with the Ottoman Army frequently tasked with intervention if a certain group grows too large or causes too much damage during one of their raids.\n\nTensions reached a new high during the early '20s when Sheikh Mahmut Barzinji declared himself 'King of Kurdistan' and fought against the Ottoman troops in Iraq. Defeated, the 'King' fled over the border into Persia. He would return a second time in the middle of the twenties with the support of the Persian government which was looking to weaken its rival."

 OTT_Population_Baghdad_desc: "Baghdad is without a doubt the capital of Ottoman Iraq, but one cannot say it's the same glamorous city of old. Once the centre of the Arab world, the city never recovered from the invasions that washed over it in the centuries of decline. The presence of the Tigris furthermore serves as a crucial tool for its past successes, and its role as trade city but it has also brought a variety of negative effects. Diseases run rampant in the city as floods regularly ruin parts of it. An interesting aspect of the city itself however is the presence of a substantial Jewish community which constitutes almost 30% of the population.\n\nSouth of Baghdad, the Holy Cities of the Shi'ite faith are located. The cities of Najaf and Karbala are to many Shi'ites what Mecca and Medina are to the Sunnis, leading to a constant exchange of ideas between the incoming Persian pilgrims and the local population. Furthermore, these cities and more explicitly their religious centres wield significant influence in both Iraq and the neighbouring Persia."

 OTT_Population_Basra: "Majority Culture: §YArab (Iraqi)§!, Assyrian\nMajority Religion: §YShia§!, Assyrian Church of the East"
 OTT_Population_Basra_desc: "Serving as the Ottoman gate on the Persian Gulf, the city of Basra forms one of the most influential centres in Iraq. With the completion of the Berlin-Baghdad railroad it would however, start to see a slight decrease in importance, as an extension linking Kuwait to the track would divert shipping to that new harbour. Previously mostly inhabited by the Marsh Arabs, the hinterland of the Vilayet received almost no attention from the Ottoman government, and as such its population was almost entirely apolitical, only appearing on the radar of the government when they lynched missionaries sent to convert the Shi'ite population. Most economic activity was thus situated near the coastline, where date plantations formed an important trade resource, whilst pearls were primarily fished up around Kuwait.\n\nThis picture would see a radical change in 1920. With the collapse of the Entente and the need for a peace settlement in the Middle East, the Ottoman government was forced to sign the Basra Accords. The Assyrian people had lived for millennia on the plains of Nineveh, and had come under substantial fire during the Weltkrieg, when deportations and exterminations aimed at the Armenian population started to spread to the Assyrians. Resisting for as much as they could, and joining the war on the side of the Entente, they were no match for the Ottoman military. Fleeing with tens of thousands to Lake Urmia in Persia, they were forced to leave a second time as Simqi the Kurd ordered his troops to slay thousands of refugees. As a final resort, the British government ultimately decided to resettle the Assyrian people in the Vilayet of Basra as far away as possible from Anatolia. Less openly expressed however, was the plan of the British to utilise the Assyrian people, whose loyalty was guaranteed, as a tool to expand their influence in the Persian Gulf and secure the flank of their oil operation in Khuzestan."

 OTT_Population_Beyrut: "Majority Culture: §YArab (Syrian)§!, Druze\nMajority Religion: §YMaronite§!, Druze, Sunni Muslim"
 OTT_Population_Beyrut_desc: "The territory surrounding Mount Lebanon and Nahr al-Kabir has been a populous cultural mixing pot since the days of the Phoenicians, passing between the hands of various kingdoms and empires, until finally ending up in the hands of the Ottomans in the 16th century. Lebanon has been for most of its history under the Ottomans an autonomous emirate, governed by Druze clans who pledged loyalty to the Sultan. The favouritism for Druze dynasties in positions of power and granting privileges to Muslim sects, soon alienated the vast population of Christians around Mount Lebanon, particularly the Maronite sect. A series of revolts in the last two centuries culminated in open civil war between Christians and Druze, a crisis which caused political intervention from Western imperial powers into the Ottoman Empire's internal affairs. The end result was the Ottomans conceding to European and Maronite demands to grant Christians a strong autonomy in the form of a Mutasarrifate.\n\nOwing to its unpopularity among the reigning anti-concessionist government, it was abolished during the Weltkrieg and absorbed into Djemal Pashas Syrian fiefdom. This period in Lebanese history was marked by famine, political repression, war crimes and strife, relieved only by the Mutasuffariate's eventual resurrection in the mid-1920s. Owing to a lack of cohesive national unity, no major organised resistance to Ottoman rule has sprung up in the region for almost a decade. The death of the staunch Lebanese nationalist and Patriarch of the Maronite Church, Elias Peter Hoayek, has marked a decline in the Maronites' political influence."

 OTT_Population_Fezzan: "Majority Culture: §YArab (Libyan)§!, Berber, Touareg, Tebou\nMajority Religion: §YSunni§!"
 OTT_Population_Fezzan_desc: "As the Ottomans took Tripoli in 1551, they would determine the history of the region for the next 400 years. Ottoman sovereignty however, did not penetrate the hinterland because of the desert ecology, the lack of revenues for a major cross-desert campaign, and the existence of another state, that of Awlad Muhammad, which was founded in 1550. The Awlad Muhammad state was a trading state, and emerged as a station for organising and protecting trade caravans. Fezzan provided this state with the largest market in the Sahara trade between Bilad al-Sudan, the Maghrib, and Egypt. This wealth naturally lured the administration in Tripoli to take over the trade. Awlad Muhammad sultans resisted the Ottomans; whenever defeated, they would withdraw into Lake Chad's region to recruit soldiers, especially their allies the rulers of Katsina, and return when the Ottoman army had left Fezzan. Faced with a military expedition from Tripoli, the state would however finally fold in 1812.\n\nWhen the Trans-Saharan trade collapsed in the late 19th century due to war in Chad, Fezzan became an afterthought and despite some attempts to establish more control, these wouldn't last. The Italians would experience the difficulties of the Ottoman and Qaramanli States when they were soundly defeated by a coalition of Senussi associated tribes, a defeat that would ultimately lead to the Italian catastrophe of 1915. With the departure of Italian forces and the return of Tripolitanian control, the region remained fairly untouched. An exodus of Fezzan citizens, enticed by the capitalist prospects of the Coast, has led to a further decrease in importance which has led to a sharp contrast in terms of development between the Coast and Fezzan."

 OTT_Population_Halep_desc: "Aleppo was once the greatest city in Ottoman Syria, with exclusive access to the silk trade from Persia and economic investment from European powers such as Venice. With the collapse of the Safavids in the early eighteenth century, however, silk would begin to flow around Persia, through Basra to Damascus and thence out to Europe, mostly bypassing the once-great financial centre of Aleppo. In the early nineteenth century, a plague wiped out a quarter of Aleppo's population, weakening the city's economy further - especially in favour of its rival, Damascus. The introduction of cotton around that time gave the city a new lease on life as an export city, but the opening of the Suez canal to European trade forever ended Aleppo's dominance in the cotton trade with Europe. In the World War, Aleppo remained firm for the Ottoman government in spite of much of Syria's capitulation to the British, but Syrian nationalism remains a potent force in this ancient city."

The region is separated from inner Syria by the An-Nusayriyah mountain range and used extensively for agriculture. Its most well-known produce is the Latakia tobacco, which is traded around the world. Latakia came under Ottoman rule in the 16th century, but being part of the thriving empire then was no boon for the city. It found itself in new competetion against the harbours of Tripoli, Beirut and Iskenderun, and earth quakes struck the city multiple times in the 18th century, leaving it in a pitiful state. The harbour is slowly silting up and bigger ships must anchor outside of it. The majority of the population are Alawites, they dominate the hills around the city. sizeable numbers inside the city are Maronite Christians or followers of the Muslim faith."

 OTT_Population_Palestine_desc: "One of the most contested regions in the world, Jerusalem is home to Holy Sites of not one but three of the major world religions, and has as such served a pivotal role in the history of mankind. Under Ottoman rule, the region flourished as the Millet system was employed to the fullest here, and was later codified in the Tanzimat Reforms. This granted Muslims, Jews, Christians and other groups a large degree of communal autonomy in matters of worship, jurisdiction over personal status, taxes, and in managing their schools and charitable institutions.\n\nThe history of Jerusalem and Palestine as a whole was shaken up severely around the start of the 20th century, as the Zionist movement grew in strength and number with the Yishuv settling all around the region, establishing their own customs and even revitalising the long dead Hebrew language. This Jewish population would later also lead to the Balfour declaration by the British government, and the Talaat declaration which followed it, both promising to grant the Yishuv rights for the creation of a Jewish national home in Palestine. When the tide of war turned and the British were forced to evacuate the Mashriq, they nonetheless saw an opportunity in the declarations, and after a long diplomatic struggle succeeded in establishing the M.O.J, an international mandate aimed at keeping the peace in Palestine.\n\nThis mandate was however seen by the Muslim population of the Middle East as an affront, and quickly gave rise to the establishment of a large resistance movement aimed at stopping Jewish settlement, abolishment of the M.O.J. and the full restoration of Ottoman, Sunni, rule. Embittered by Ottoman failures to block foreign involvement in the region, many Palestinians turned towards the Kingdom of Egypt and became fierce proponents of Arab nationalism. Tensions between the various faiths have exploded over the last few years and with war on the horizon, all of Palestine holds its breath."

 OTT_Population_Maan_desc: "The Southern Syrian lands around the town of Amman have long escaped Ottoman authority, and have been neglected by our predecessors. Mainly used as an access point to the far more important Hejaz, our control over the region is limited to the direct area around the Hejaz Railway and certain pilgrim hotspots along the way to Mecca. This has resulted in a large influx of migrants from Syria, Circassia and even Anatolia which have fled from the conscription and taxation of the North.\n\nControl over the Eastern bank of the Jordan River was limited at best before the Weltkrieg with many Bedouin raiding settled areas and tribes migrating between Central Arabia and Ma'an. With the restoration of order by the military however, a large efflux of settlers from Palestine has moved eastwards adding to the still small cities of al-Salt and Amman. The economic exploitation of the region has also seen steady development, with mining operations adding to the otherwise primarily agricultural economy."

With little settlement possible as the majority of the region consists of the Sinai Desert, there are nonetheless a variety of Bedouin tribes who have established their home on the outskirts of the desert.\n\nWhilst much like the rest of the Middle East, the Sinai has a long and diverse history, it was shook up as recently as the Weltkrieg when it was the location of heavy fighting between the Ottoman Turks and the British. The Turks attempting to seize the Suez Canal and as such cut off the British from their empire were rebuked in two separate assaults after which British troops themselves made the perilous crossing to invade Syria."

In Ottoman history however, the city is also renowned for the desperate defence put up by general Fahrettin Pasha who completely surrounded by forces of the Arab traitor, Hussein, held the city against all odds and became after the war the symbol for the strength and endurance of the Ottoman army.\n\nUnlike its southern colleagues, the city of Medina is not the bustling economic centre, of the Hejaz but it nonetheless forms a key station on the Hejaz railway and the location of a sizeable Ottoman garrison."

As part of this claim, the city of Mecca itself also enjoys a special tax statute which exempts it from all the normal taxes, and instead grants it subsidies or Surre to maintain the Holy Sites and receive pilgrims from all around the world in the necessary splendour. This pilgrimage or the Hajj is one of the duties of every Muslim, and has to be undertaken by all pious Muslims at least once in their lives, each year causing a massive logistical operation for the entire Hejaz.\n\nOriginally almost entirely governed by the Grand Shariff of Mecca, the administration of the Hejaz received substantial changes in the wake of the failed Hejazi Revolt, as the Ottoman government stepped in to reduce the authority of the office and crack down hard on Hejazi autonomy. These days most power is concentrated in the office of the Ottoman Wali (governor) although the position of Grand Shariff has remained for now.\n\nBesides Mecca however, the city of Jeddah shines as the pearl of the Red Sea and serves as the most important Ottoman harbour south of Beirut. This bustling mercantile metro-pole, a melting pot of Hejazi, Egyptian, Sudanese, Turkish and other cultures has developed itself steadily over the last few decades, and has with the completion of the Hejaz Railway received a significant stimulus which has made it the home of Hejazi political development."

Each has a rich history, usually ranging back to the times of the ancient Aegean civilisations. Rhodos was home to the Knights Hospitallers, and their fortifications still dominate the island's capital. The Aegean Isles have changed hands twice in recent history. In 1912, when the Ottoman Empire was attacked both by Italy and the alliance of Greece, Bulgaria, Montenegro and Serbia, the islands were surrendered to the enemies of the Porte. With victory in the Weltkrieg however, the Ottoman crescent flies over the harbours of the Aegean Isles again. The people living on these islands are almost all of Greek descent and Orthodox Christians. Their livelihood is either farm work or fishing, with some special produce being the mastic of Chios, a tree resin with many purposes, for example as a spice in Turkish coffee, to flavour raki or even as finish for paintings and lacquer for musical instruments."

 OTT_Population_Cyprus_desc: "Conquered from the Venetians in 1573, Ottoman rule over the island of Cyprus dates back almost 5 centuries, and has seen numerous changes over the years. The most important of these was that through a system of Timars or land grants for retired Ottoman soldiers, a sizeable Turkish Cypriot community made the island their home. The Greek community was allowed to retain various privileges however, as under the Millet system, they were responsible for their own religious duties, education and the development of Greek culture. The Ottoman Empire further encouraged this by appointing the Archbishop of Cyprus as the sole representative of the Orthodox community and gradually of the ethnic Greek group.\n\nAlthough an experiment was executed in the late 19th Century when the Mutasarrifate was temporarily abolished and integrated into the Vilayet of the Archipelago, the attempt ultimately failed as the distance to its new capital (Çanakkale) led to a communication and administrative headache. The decision was ultimately reverted in 1870. The Ottoman-Russian war brought further changes to the island as in a secret agreement with Britain, control over Cyprus was handed to the British. The many Cypriots who expected this to be a definitive turn towards self-government were badly disappointed however, as all power was to be held by London with very little representation of the Cypriots in their own affairs.\n\nThe independence of Greece played another important role in the history of Cyprus, as with it the calls for Enosis or Unification with Greece intensified, soon engulfing the entire island. Their cries would be ignored however, as with the restoration of Ottoman control over the island in the wake of British collapse, a new Mutasarrifate was installed with clear orders to promote the attachment of Cyprus to Anatolia through any means necessary."

 OTT_Population_Homs_desc: "Likely settled as early as 2300BC, the city of Homs and the surrounding area have played an important role in the history of Syria. Much like the rest of Syria, Homs was captured by the Arabian Caliphates in the 7th century after which it quickly became a centre of piety and a strong economic centre. Ruled under subsequently the Umayyads, the Abbasids, the Tulunids, the Hamdanids, the Qarmatians and the Hamdanids. Despite this rapid succession of dynasties, the city of Homs prospered and quickly became one of the largest in Syria. The city continued to play an important role later in as first invaders from the west in the form of crusaders and later invaders from the east in the form of Mongols tried to take the strategic city.\n\nThe city ultimately fell into Ottoman hands in 1516 and it remained an important centre for silk, olive oil and sesame whilst its surrounding marshlands provided ample production of wheat, rice and grapes. Nonetheless the city started to decline in status as the incapacity to defend against Bedouin raids, a succession of earthquakes and the rise of European industry derived it from most of its wealth.\n\nBy the start of the 20th century however Homs was on its way back up as a decline in European textile production gave rise to a large scale expansion of the weaving industries, earning it the nickname of "Manchester of Syria". Seeing little activity during the Weltkrieg as the main brunt of the British operations bypassed the city, the city has continued to grow in status and is proving a worthy rival to the other major cities of Syria, Damascus, Aleppo and Beirut."

 OTT_Population_Haifa_desc: "Home to the largest port of Palestine, the Sandjak of Haifa was created in the wake of the Weltkrieg, as the loss of Jerusalem to an international mandate necessitated the reorganisation of the Syrian administration. With the situation in Mt Lebanon fickle after the devastating famine tore through the region, it was thus decided that a new Sandjak would be created with it capital at Haifa and placed underneath the Vilayet of Suriye.\n\nDespite the separation from the Southern half of Palestine, the region remains in close contact with Jerusalem as little border control exists between the two regions. This has also given rise to a substantial anti-Zionist movement, covertly backed by the Ottoman government, aimed at the restoration of Palestine and the reunification of the region. Despite tacit Ottoman support for the cause, the Porte was unable to stop the rise of Arab nationalist thought and while the primary aim of the movement remains an end to foreign meddling in Palestine, it now also includes the Ottoman Empire under these."

 OTT_Population_Tripolitania_desc: "Tripolitania is one of the three parts of Libya, with the others being Cyrenaica in the west and Fezzan in the south. It got its name from the three ancient Phoenician cities that formed a three-city alliance in what is now the lands around the city of the same name, Tripolis. Between the green lands on the coast and the desert to the south lie the Nafusa mountains, inhabited by Berbers. After it became part of the Ottoman Empire in the 16th century, the region, being on the frontier of the Empire and far away from Constantinople, gained an autonomy bordering on self-rule. The Pasha of Tripolis and his captains made a name for themselves as fearsome pirates in the Mediterranean until the western powers of France and the United States of America destroyed both fleet and city of Tripolis at the turn of the 19th century. During the Tanzimat reform period now hundred years ago, Tripolitania was one of the first vilayets to the be formed, in 1864. Since the 1880s, it has seen a strong influence by the Senussi Order that operates from Kufra, further undermining the rule of the Sublime Porte, and in 1912 Tripolitania, together with the rest of Libya, was lost in the war against Italy. The land was returned after the victory in the Weltkrieg, but the upheavals are still felt and the Senussi Order cannot be trusted."

 OTT_Population_Benghazi_desc: "Founded by Greek settlers in 525BC under the name Euesperides, the city formed part of the Pentapolis or five most important cities in the later Roman province of Cyrenaica. The city steadily developed itself as an important regional centre and would prosper for 600 years, outgrowing the nearby Cyrene and Barca as the chief centre of Cyrenaica. This success story wouldn't last however, as a Jewish revolt in the second century AD and conquest by the Vandals in 431 brought the city crashing back down. By the time Amr ibn al-As conquered the province in 643, the city had dwindled to an insignificant village and became known as Barneeq. After the Ottoman invasion of Libya, the city rose once more in prominence as its strategic location in the Mediterranean made it a key port to control.\n\nAt the advent of the Italian invasion of Libya, Benghazi was nonetheless the most impoverished region in the Empire lacking paved roads, telegraph services and with a harbour too silted to allow much traffic. After 1912, under Italian control, it quickly saw an improvement in its infrastructure however, as the city was deemed a suitable target for Italian settlers, and it served during the Weltkrieg as one of the only parts of Libya still controlled by Italy. The loss in the war however, and the subsequent collapse of the Italian state, led to the return of the city to Ottoman control whom having lost any semblance of authority over the rest of Cyrenaica, developed it primarily as a military base to control the interior and threaten the Egyptian Western flank."

 OTT_Population_Qatar_desc: "The Ottoman Empire first claimed jurisdiction over the Qatar peninsula in 1550, when tribes along the Al-Hasa coast asked for Ottoman protection. After being disputed by both local Sheikhs and invaders from the Arabian peninsula, Ottoman rule was first established firmly in the mid-nineteenth century, although it retreated once again to Kuwait around the turn of the century. The Porte actually renounced sovereignty over Qatar in 1913 to the United Kingdom, but in 1925 demanded oaths of fealty from the local sheikhdoms, in order to secure the Persian gulf. Preliminary oil surveys have produced hopeful signs, but until these signs solidify Qatar remains a backwater."

 OTT_Population_Bahrain_desc: "Although the Ottoman Empire has claimed dominion over the archipelago of Bahrain since its conquest of Basra in the sixteenth century, it has never exercised any form of centralised control over it. Perennially without a permanent ruler, the island was invaded by local leaders from Qatar, the Al-Khalifa tribe, in the beginning of the nineteenth century, and in 1868 the British established a protectorate over the island. In 1892 the British centralised rule of their protectorate, and tied it to the government of the British Raj. When the Raj collapsed into civil war in 1926, Ganga Singh abandoned the British protectorates in Arabia, and in order to prevent a Persian invasion Hamad ibn Isa Al Khalifa swore allegiance to the Sublime Porte. Although still a poor island subsisting mostly on fishing and pearl exports, Bahrain is still a possible flashpoint between Persia and the Ottoman Empire, and should be treated gently as such."

 OTT_Population_Abu_Dhabi_desc: "Protectorates of the Sublime Porte, the Shaykhs of the Trucial Coast were forced between a rock and a hard place when their former patron, the United Kingdom, was forced to abandon its interests in the Arab Gulf. As Ibn Saud looked on with glee, eager to force the Shaykhs under the iron grip of Riyadh, it would be the Ottoman Porte who struck first as Admiral Rauf Pasha on the orders of the central government steamed to Abu Dhabi with two destroyers and met with its Sheikh to discuss the future of the Gulf states. Reluctantly agreeing that a protectorate under the Porte was better for the autonomy of Abu Dhabi than incorporation into the Saudi state, the Shaykh signed. The Shaykhs of Dubai, Sharjah and Ras al Khaimah followed suit, each signing individually and receiving full recognition of their authority from the Porte.\n\nMore than ten years have passed since the transfer of power, and under protection of the Porte, the various Shaykhdoms endured. Nonetheless, they have had their share of misfortune as the steady decline of the pearl trade, the primary economic motor of the region, is causing massive social upheaval whilst the Ottoman representatives on the ground have slowly pushed for more and more concessions from the Shaykhs, including the sale of land near Dubai for the construction of an air strip to the disgust of the inland Bedouin. The Shaykhdoms have had their differences internally as well and tensions between Sharjah, Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Ajman have grown the last few years. Furthermore, the Persians have been watching closely, and under their last government taken steps to reduce the influence of the Shaykhs on the other side of the Hormuz Strait, whilst naval manoeuvres have started to infringe on sovereign Trucial land to great annoyance of the Ottoman fleet."

 OTT_Population_Eastern_Thrace_desc: "Once a part of the Adrianople Vilayet, the mountains and hills of Western Thrace were conquered by the Bulgarian army by force during the First Balkan War, and became a part of the Kingdom of Bulgaria. The population of the region, once heavily ethnically diverse and divided between Bulgarians, Greeks and Turks, was severely disrupted in the aftermath, as each retreating army would be followed by thousands of refugees of their respective nationality, be it Bulgarian, Greek or Turkish. The diversity remains, however, and in the Tsardom of Bulgaria, Western Thrace was one of the most ethnically diverse, and thus problematic regions.\n\nThough sparsely populated and impoverished, Western Thrace owed a greater weight for the Bulgarian economy than one might consider, thanks to the region's tobacco plantations and their contribution to the treasury."

 OTT_Population_Momchilgrad: "Majority Culture: §YTurkish§!, Bulgarian, Greek\nMajority Religion: §YSunni Muslim§!, Orthodox Christian"
 OTT_Population_Momchilgrad_desc: "Once, Kardzhali was known as Zherkovo, an important fortress in the medieval Bulgarian and late Byzantine Empires, and a centre of Orthodox Christianity. Conquered by the Ottoman Empire, it grew increasingly Turkish due to immigration thanks to its strategic trade route location, and obtained its current name - from the brigand Kirca Ali, who terrorised the roads in the 18th century and used Kardzhali as his hideaway. By the creation of the principality of Bulgaria, the region was majority Turkish, and remained so even after conquered by force in the Balkan Wars.\n\nKardzhali is a rural region, the only industry present here are processing plants for tobacco plantations from across Bulgaria's Aegean coast. During Bulgarian rule, it was deemed a part of ethnic Bulgaria and thus subjected to heavy Bulgarisation - but the Turkish majority remained and can develop freely under restored Ottoman rule."

 OTT_Population_al_Hasa_desc: "The oasis of Al-Hasa, or Al-Ahsa, as it is called in the non-Bedouin dialects of Arabia, is one of the newest additions to the realm of the Sublime Porte. While the region came under Ottoman rule in the 16th century, the tribe of the Banu Khalids hold the real power in the oases of the gulf coast. In 1872 direct rule was restored and Al-Hasa became part of the Basra vilayet, but this should not hold for long, when in 1913, using the weakness of the Empire, the Saudis annexed the region into their Emirate of Nejd. Since these cowards hid their intentions in the first Arab Revolt, the land was not reclaimed immediately, but now it is again under Ottoman rule. While it does not seem to have to offer much at a first glance, it is the gateway to central Arabia from the gulf, and its numerous date tree farms are said to produce only the finest fruits. Some prospectors believe there to be resources of value below the sands of Al-Hasa, but these are just rumours for now."

 OTT_Population_Urmia_desc: "The Azeri province of Persia, although the home of the Safavid unifiers of Iran, has been occupied by the Ottoman Empire several times throughout its history. During the Durrani wars of the early sixteenth century, the Ottomans invaded the region, although they were soon driven out again. During the Weltkrieg, the Ottomans fought the Entente throughout the western regions of supposedly neutral Iran. Urmia was taken in 1915, and the Turanist project of Enver Pasha seemed to be approaching realisation. However, after the war ended in 1919, the Central Powers were forced to leave the region to what remained of the Qajars. Now under Turkish control once more, Western Azerbaijan seems likely to remain a counterbalance to rebellious Armenia, hard to the northwest. Still, full integration will take time."

It is not the first time that Ottoman troops marched into this part of Kurdistan, it being the border between the Sublime Porte's lands and the various Persian empires for centuries. The administrative central of the former Iranian province is Kermanshah. While it was decently prosperous region for most of history, its economy took a hit when the traditional methods of transportation along the silk road were replaced by routes on the ocean in the last century. Being the new occupier of the land and having shown dangerous tendencies in 1916 when the Kurds were deported to the outskirts of the Ottoman Empire, the conservative Kurdish sheiks look to Kostantiniyye with suspicion."

 OTT_Population_Khuzestan_desc: "Khuzestan has stood out from the other provinces of Persia, since its population, although majority Shiite like the rest of the country, is Arabic. In the north of Khuzestan however live the Lur, an Iranian people that was forced to give up their nomadic lifestyles recently under Persian rule. Part of the Fertile Crescent, Khuzestan has played an important role in the history of the region since antiquity. The ancient Persian empire had its capital in Khuzestan, in the city of Susa. Susa was destroyed in the Mongol invasions, and since then Shushtar and the commercial port of Ahvaz have taken the place as the most prominent towns of the province. The sea is an important resource for Khuzestan, with Ahvaz being a gateway to inner Persia, and fishing is a major food source. The Ottoman takeover of the province is met with mixed feelings. While the Persian rule was never popular, the new economic competition of the other harbours at the coast is not a cause to celebrate for the people of Khuzestan."

 OTT_Population_Ajdabiya_desc: "The city of Ajdabiya lies at a crossroads of traditional caravan routes. Only a few kilometres inlands from the sea, the roads and routes along the Libyan coast, up to Benghazi in the north, meet with the caravan tracks that lead inwards to Jaghbub and Kufra to the south of the Cyrenaica. The town centre is dominated by the ruins of a castle built by the Fatimids thousand years ago, who used Ajdabiya as their bridgehead into Egypt, which they ultimately conquered in 969. The town itself lying on a flat, rocky plateau with little agriculture, it is the wells and cisternes that keep the town alive and crops growing. While not a stronghold of the Senussi Order like the oasis towns to the south, it still was part of their domain and the local Ottoman officials will have to find a way to win the populace over to the order now upheld by the Sublime Porte."

 OTT_Population_Jaghbub_desc: "The oasis town of Jaghbub lies in the outliers of the Libyan desert, closer to the Egyptian Siwa than to any other city in the Cyrenaica. It controls an important caravan route on the way to Egypt and many camels loaded with goods make stop at the waters of Jaghbub. The land around it is dominated by the desert sands, broken up by sharp rocks of dolomite. Before Ottoman troops forced the Senussi Order to retreat to Kufra, Jaghbub has been the centre of their movement since 1856. When the Order set up their headquarters, still under the leadership of its founder Muhammad as-Senussi, a wall was built around the small town and a Zawiya opened its doors that became an Islamic school of renown. Muhammad as-Senussi's tomb is in Jaghbub and attracts pilgrims from all over the Sahara."

The oases in this wasteland only became settled in the 19th century by the local Arab tribes, with Al Jawf, "the centre", being the central town at the largest of the oases of the region. The first European to set foot there was a German explorer only in 1873. The remoteness of the southern most frontier of the Cyrenaica is what led the Order of Senussi to set up their headquarters in Kufra. The Ottoman Empire had forced these unruly zealots out of Jaghbub in 1895. Now that it is under Ottoman control, much work awaits the local officials. While it is an important waypoint for caravans crossing the Sahara and was the main centre of Senussi thought, being a region of strategical importance for the whole of Libya, order must be restored, and this part of the desert largely remains not yet even mapped."

 OTT_Population_Yemen_desc: "Away from the coast and in the southern end of the Sarawat Mountain Range lays the heart of Yemen, and arguably the breadbasket of Arabia. Unlike the rest of the region, rainfall is somewhat frequent and the mountains give way to cultivation terraces that allow the local populace to engage in more extensive agriculture and pastoral practices, making the region one of the most densely populated in the peninsula.\nThanks to the same mountains and the plateau that hosts almost three million souls, the Yemeni heartland has always been difficult to hold for any foreign powers, and we're not the exception. The broken mountains offer excellent opportunities to construct fortifications and hide forces. Nevertheless, holding these mountains is key to secure the hold of the southern tip of the Tihamah region and ensure control over the Red Sea."

Disputed by many rulers and foreign powers since then, Aden fell into the British hands in the 1800s, challenging Ottoman presence in the region and bringing a large influx of Indian merchants from the Raj."
 # Being a key post travelling towards the Suez from their colonies in the east, the immediate surroundings of the city have seen substantial urban growth and economic prosperity, even after their retreat and the takeover of the local Sultan of Lahej under his Federation of Emirates, further demonstrating the economic importance of the harbour.

This isolation has led in part to the Hadhrami peoples retaining a sizeable influence of ancient south semitic languages in their speech, and being the source of great curiosity by British explorers in the late 1800s. \nSplit by mountains the Hadhrami tend to agriculture along the coast and cattle farming in the north, making use of the their few water resources. There is also a sizeable community of Hadhrami jews, extremely distinct from other jewish communities due to their long historical isolation from other communities. "

 TUR_abdulmecid_osmanoglu_leader_desc: "§YBorn:§! §LMay 29th, 1868, in Dolmabahçe Palace, Beşiktaş, Konstantiniyye, Ottoman Empire§!\n§YBackground:§! §LAbdülmecid II was born to then Sultan Abdulaziz and is his third son. During his early life, Abdülmecid enjoyed private education inside the walls of the palace, where he developed interests in music and arts. However, as per Ottoman traditions, he was not allowed to leave the palace until he had reached the age of 40. Still, he was happy, and over time grew increasingly content with the fact that he'll probably never be a Sultan.\n\nIn 1908, the year in which the Young Turk Revolution took place, Abdülmecid was finally old enough to leave the palace. He used his newfound freedoms to share his love for art and music with the world. He became the Chairman of the Ottoman Artists' Society, exhibited his paintings all over Europe, met with some of the most prominent musicians of the continent and learned to play new instruments.\n\nEven though Abdülmecid would have likely wanted to dedicate his entire life to music and arts, the world had bigger plans for him. On the 4th of July 1918, his first cousin Mehmed VI was crowned Sultan, a development which once again saw Abdülmecid become the heir apparent to the throne. After Mehmed had died 8 years later, Abdülmecid succeeded to the throne and was crowned Sultan of the Ottoman Empire and Caliph of all of Islam. For most people, this would've been a dream come true - but for Abdülmecid, it was something he had never truly wanted. His apathy was one of the many reasons for why the Grand Viziers appointed during his reign managed to decrease the already diminished influence of the Sultan even further, turning him into nothing but a popular figurhead that mostly keeps away from politics, and whose main role it is to represent the Empire abroad. By now, the political power of the Sultan has come to an all-time low, and it seems unlikely, if not impossible, that this will change in the near future.§!"

However, this restriction was lifted after his grandfather had died in 1904. Because of this, Osman was able to join the Volunteer Officer Force during the Italian Invasion of Tripolitania in 1911. Even though he was only 16 years old at the time, Osman was already able to show his qualities as an officer and as a soldier. During his time in Libya, he met Mustafa Kemal, who was still only a Captain at the time and would soon become a good friend of Osman.\n\nAfter gathering his first experiences on the battlefield, Osman attended the Ottoman Military Academy. Following his graduation, he and a few of his cousins were sent to the German Military Academy in Potsdam. Afterwards, he joined the German Imperial Guard of Hussars, in which he held the rank of Captain. Once the Weltkrieg broke out, he was recalled to the Empire in order to help with its defence. Over the course of the war, he fought on many different fronts, but his most notable battles took place in Gallipoli and Benghazi. For his bravery, courage and competence in battle, he was decorated with numerous military honours, including the Gallipoli Star and the Liakat War Medals. Moreover, he was also promoted to Major-General - something truly astonishing for a 23-year-old.\n\nAfter the war had come to an end, Osman stayed in Kostantiniyye and focused on his military career. He became known throughout the realm for his skills as an officer and especially for his abilities as a cavalry commander. These skills came in handy in the aftermath of the Palace Raid, during which he managed to crush the rebels and to retake control of the capital. Because of his quick reaction, the people now see him as an efficient and trustworthy leader, that can take action when needed. However, some fear that Osman might be just another puppet of the OHF and strongly influenced by his dear friend Kemal. The Sultan will have to show his nation if he can rule alone, or if he is nothing but another pawn in a much greater game.§!"
