 MEX_mexican_socialism: "Mexican Socialism"
 MEX_mexican_socialism_desc: "Mexican society is complex. There are plenty of both conservative and progressive towns and citizens that, while wishing to help one another, fear each other.

 MEX_economic_development_desc: "Previous governments were way too focused on workers' rights and forgot that without businesses, there can be no workers.

 MEX_rewrite_history_desc: "Our history books show the old Porfiriato as an evil regime that oppressed the citizens of Mexico with the autocratic lead of Porfirio Diaz.

 MEX_military_youth: "Military Youth"
 MEX_military_youth_desc: "Many disillusioned young men have seen fit to rebel against the government in the past, that's why the revolution was so popular among the younger generations.

 MEX_support_the_church: "Support the Church"
 MEX_support_the_church_desc: "The Church was sidelined during the progressive governments following the Revolution, and as such have been forced to endure a severe restriction of their influence in our traditionally conservative society.

 MEX_revolutions_legacy: "Revolution's Legacy"
 MEX_revolutions_legacy_desc: "The Revolution has become a sensitive topic for most Mexicans.

 MEX_camps_for_syndies: "Work Camps"
 MEX_camps_for_syndies_desc: "A bullet is the simplest way of dealing with dissent, but not the most efficient one.

 MEX_army_modernization: "Modernise the Army"
 MEX_army_modernization_desc: "The Mexican armed forces are still using outdated equipment from the Weltkrieg-era and our military doctrines and tactics have also fallen behind the times over the past decade. Our nation is a major player in North and Central America, so our army should be modernised and expanded."

 MEX_guerilla_warfare: "Guerrilla Warfare"
 MEX_guerilla_warfare_desc: "Mexico's terrain is extremely harsh with various deserts, mountain ranges and jungles. Already during the Mexican Revolution, guerrilla tactics have proven to be highly effective in such terrain which doesn't permit for large, heavily-equipped armies."
 MEX_zapatas_training: "Study the Mexican Revolution"

 MEX_night_ambushes: "Night Ambushes"

 MEX_citizen_soldier: "Citizen Soldiers"
 MEX_citizen_soldier_desc: "A guerrilla force should not only be made up of professional soldiers, but every citizen should also be able to participate in the fight against the enemy. With special citizen militias, we can make sure that every citizen will be able to fulfil his duties."
 MEX_decentralized_command: "Decentralised Command"
 MEX_decentralized_command_desc: "It is difficult to command a guerrilla unit in the deserts of Sonora or the jungles of Yucatan from Mexico City. Our command structure should be more decentralised with local commanders having enough autonomy to perform well during guerrilla attacks."
 MEX_recon_scouts: "Recon Scouts"
 MEX_recon_scouts_desc: "Ambushes can be very powerful, like the Afghans have shown in their constant wars against the British imperialists. However, an ambush is useless if no enemy ever arrives. Professional scouts which can accurately report the position of the enemy facilitate the setting up of ambushes."
 MEX_small_unit_tactics: "Small Unit Tactics"
 MEX_small_unit_tactics_desc: "Ambush units are usual on the same level of manpower as squads, maybe platoons, but an entire division doesn't create a good local ambush. Our army should function on the basis of small units, so our tactics and command structure need to be reworked."

 MEX_jungle_training: "Jungle Training"

 MEX_solderas_desc: "During the Mexican Revolution, many women fought for the principles of the revolution. These 'soldaderas' have proven their strength and will on the battlefield, but women are still frowned upon in the military.

 MEX_mechanized_warfare: "Mechanised Warfare"
 MEX_mechanized_warfare_desc: "While the strength of our Mexican soldiers is high, and while the strength of a Mexican artillery piece is even higher, the strength of a Mexican tank is the highest! We need to mechanise our forces so that no regular enemy force can defeat us."

 MEX_general_staff: "General Staff Reforms"

 MEX_military_college: "New Military Colleges"

 MEX_professional_army: "Professional Army"
 MEX_professional_army_desc: "The goal of our major military reforms is to create a professional, modern army. While we will achieve to create a modern army by improving our equipment and tactics, a professional army can only be achieved if every soldier knows his duties and is willing to fulfil them under any condition."
 MEX_centralized_command: "Centralised Command"

 MEX_logistics: "Logistic Companies"

 MEX_flexiable_planning: "Flexible Planning"
 MEX_flexiable_planning_desc: "Helmuth von Moltke the Elder accurately said that 'no battle plan ever survives contact with the enemy', and that has been perfectly proven by the chaotic battles of the Mexican Revolution.

 MEX_grand_navy: "Grand Navy"

 MEX_naval_glory: "Naval Glory"
 MEX_naval_glory_desc: "The sight of the Anáhuac is enough to impress most people and its 234mm guns are larger than any artillery pieces that our ground forces field. We should take pride in our naval forces which bravely defend the shores of Mexico."
 MEX_battleships: "Battleship Development"
 MEX_battleships_desc: "The Anáhuac is the largest ship of our navy, yet it is more than three decades old and will not be able to compete with modern capital ships. We need to develop our own proper battleship to serve as the new flagship of our navy."
 MEX_battleship_production: "Produce Our Titans of the Sea!"
 MEX_battleship_production_desc: "Our naval industrial capacity is quite limited, however. Through negotiations and agreements with foreign friendly nations, we have been able to utilise their industrial capacity to produce parts that are then shipped to our dockyards. This will speed up the production and quality of our new behemoths of the sea!"
 MEX_carriers: "Carrier Development"

 MEX_marine_focus: "Fuerza de Infantería de Marina"
 MEX_marine_focus_desc: "Sometimes, it is easier to bypass the enemy forces by sea than to fight through entrenched lines in difficult terrain. While naval operations like the Battle of Gallipoli have failed, the invasion from the sea might become a viable military tactic."

 MEX_protect_trade: "Protect Trade"
 MEX_protect_trade_desc: "Our navy will simply never be able to compete with the major navies of the world, so instead of trying to compete uselessly, we should focus on defending our trade lines instead. While we can't beat the US fleet, we can beat pirates and raiders."
 MEX_coast_guard: "Coast Guard"
 MEX_coast_guard_desc: "Our nation has a large coastline, both along the Pacific and the Caribbean Sea, which provides enough hiding places for raiders and smugglers. We need to patrol our coasts to stop these criminals."

 MEX_destroyers_desc: "A large battleship is not very suited for convoy escort missions. Instead, we should invest in small escort destroyers which can protect our convoys will being cost-efficient and reliable."
 MEX_escort_training: "Protecting Our Trade!"

 MEX_air: "Fuerza Aérea Mexicana"

 MEX_air_ports: "Build Airports"
 MEX_air_ports_desc: "An aircraft can't take off from a jungle... well we haven't tried yet but it seems unlikely. We need to construct airfields on flat terrain so that our air force can takeoff to defend the sky above Mexico."
 MEX_air_defense: "Air Defence"
 MEX_air_defense_desc: "We aren't the only ones to build up an air force... far from it actually. Our air force will most likely be on the defence if we have to face the major counter-revolutionary and imperialist air forces, so we should aid them from the ground."
 MEX_air_supremecy: "Air Supremacy"
 MEX_air_supremecy_desc: "In order to effectively support our ground and naval forces and in order to defend them from enemy bombers, our air force needs to focus on gaining and defending air superiority."
 MEX_fighters: "Fighter Research"

 MEX_army_air_support: "Army Air Support"
 MEX_army_air_support_desc: "Many of our adversaries, most notably counter-revolutionary Central American countries, lack an air force, so we should focus on supporting our army from the air. We will not be able to challenge the air forces of the Entente, so we should focus on exploiting the weakness of our smaller rivals."
 MEX_bombers: "Bomber Research"
 MEX_bombers_desc: "Using small aircraft armed with nothing more than machine guns to destroy enemy infrastructure and industry will be almost impossible. We need large aircraft with multiple engines to deliver a large bomb payload to the enemy."
 MEX_radar: "RADAR Development"
 MEX_radar_desc: "RADAR, which stands for radio detection and ranging, is a new method of detection which will be quite useful for the air force. With RADAR installations, we will be able to detect incoming aircraft outside of viewing distance so that we can alarm the air force quickly enough."
 MEX_expand_air_ports: "Expand Airports"
 MEX_expand_air_ports_desc: "Our air force is constantly expanding, but our airfields can't keep up. Their capacity limits will soon be exceeded, and we found out that you can't takeoff an aircraft from the jungle... we will need to expand our airfields quickly."
 MEX_paratroopers: "Paratroopers"
 MEX_paratroopers_desc: "The Battle of Gallipoli has shown that seaborne invasions are quite difficult to perform, but airborne invasions haven't been tried yet. We should build up an airborne unit that can jump behind enemy lines to cut supply lines and ambush retreating forces."
 MEX_rule_the_skies: "Rule the Skies"
 MEX_rule_the_skies_desc: "The Mexican air force shall rule the skies... well the skies of Central America at least. It will still take quite a while until we can compete with the air forces of the Entente..."

 MEX_KR_gathering_storm_desc: "Mexico has come out through the Mexican Revolution changed. During the 1920s the presidencies of Álvaro Obregón and Adolfo de la Huerta would see improved relations with the United States of America while stabilising the country from the revolution. The Great Depression in America has allowed Mexico to embrace the ideas of the Revolution which they started when they elected Emiliano Zapata as President in 1932. Now with two years left in his term, and the revolution seemingly done, Zapata looks to plot the future course for Mexico."

### Intro Screen ###
 MEX_country_intro_header: "Mexico - A few years ago"
 MEX_country_intro_content: "Mexico has been transformed in the recent years. In 1910 the Mexican Revolution began against Porfirio Díaz and would last nearly a decade. By 1917 Venustiano Carranza had become the president, however, he quickly proved to anger other revolutionaries when he embarked on a campaign to destroy his political rivals including Zapata. This would lead to the Plan de Agua Prieta by a number of military and political leaders and lead to Álvaro Obregón to becoming the President of Mexico. From here the chaos of the revolution would wind down as the government of Mexico began a period of stabilisation.\n\nThe first term of Álvaro Obregón would see improved relations with the United States, especially after Pancho Villa was made Ambassador to the Commune of France and Adolfo de la Huerta was able to finally get the Yankees to recognise the current government of Mexico as the legitimate government of Mexico. The economy would start to be improved especially in the south where Zapata held power and was able to implement the land reforms more comprehensively than they were being implemented elsewhere in the country. Obregón would work to improve labour rights though this would spark a new conflict between the two big unions - Confederación Regional Obrera Mexicana or CROM and the more syndicalist Confederación General de Trabajadores or CGT. However, all was not well in Mexico there was the growing tension from the Catholic population due to the draconian anti-clerical laws that were written into the Constitution against the Catholic Church."

 MEX_country_intro_header_1: "Mexico in 1936"
 MEX_country_intro_content_1: "Obregón would be succeeded by Adolfo de la Huerta who would continue for the most part the same general policies. However, his term would have a number of international incidents for him to deal with. Notably the British Revolution and the subsequent Great Depression in the United States which would send shock-waves down southward and effect the economy of Mexico. This would all trigger conflicts in Central America, notably in Nicaragua, where Zapata would go and help spread his brand of revolutionary ideals southward. However, none of this was the most controversial thing de la Huerta did. That would be the rewriting of the term limits, so that Obregón could run for a second term, which of course Obregón won.\n\nHowever in 1932, Zapata would be elected on a Socialist and populist platform. Zapata's term would focus on the economy, particularly the agrarian sector with improvements on the working conditions and rights of peasants of the ejidos, or communal land under usufructuary property. Work to improve the rights of the peasants and natives within Mexico would be his main focus during his first term. However, his policies would anger the conservatives and Catholics even more. A more unpopular measure with the conservatives was the change to electoral law, restricting maximum terms to 1 but lengthening the duration of each term to 5 years. His overtures to the International would cause tension with the US as was his policy of land redistribution.\n\nAs 1936 dawns many wonder what form the future of Mexico will take."

 mexico.41.a: "Competition shall allow Mexico to Prosper."

### Dirty War ###
 mexico.42.t: "Campesinos War Begins"
 mexico.42.d: "The assumption of power by the Military junta following Zapata's death has resulted in quite the dissatisfaction from the people.

 mexico.46.t: "Restore Democracy?"
 mexico.46.d: "With our victory against the peasant rebels, we're finally in a position to look inwards to our government institutions and fully restore our pre-revolutionary government. However, it's unclear what path we should take regarding it. Mexico, for decades, prospered under the guidance of Porfirio Diaz, and while the benefits of his rule slowly waned in his final days, there's no denying that perhaps going back to those days with Garza in power could be benefitial. On the other hand, Democracy has quickly become part of the Mexican culture, and with liberal and conservative parties pressuring the junta to restore at least some semblance of democratic rule, perhaps it would be best if instead of a dictatorship, we pursued a slow transition towards democracy..."

 mexico.61.t: "The New Constitution"
 mexico.61.d: "In Mexico City today a new constitution was unveiled today. The Constitution of [GetYear] is rather similar to the 1917 Constitution, though it is also different in a number of ways. Notably it does not contain the same anti-clericalism, land reform and other radical parts that made up the 1917 constitution. It is regarded as a more moderate, more democratic constitution. While there is great fanfare in Mexico City, in a number of rural towns the new constitution was met with obvious disdain."
 mexico.61.a: "A new day rises in Mexico."

 mexico.62.t: "The Legacy of the Revolution"
 mexico.62.d: "The legacy of the Mexican Revolution has been something that has been up for debate within the Mexican Congress. Some regard the whole revolution as terrible and we should condemn it as a backwards step. Others wish though that we should condemn just the radicals like Zapata and Villa for destroying Mexico. What shall be decided?"
 mexico.62.a: "Condemn just Zapata and other Radicals."
 mexico.62.b: "Condemn the whole revolution."

 mexico.63.t: "Anti-Native Law"
 mexico.63.d: "A law has been proposed that would repeal the various laws that Zapata passed for the indigenous Mexicans. The law has a great deal of support from those in power among the right wing that regard the laws as just another policy that Zapata did to destroy Mexico. However, this naturally will not please the various indigenous Mexicans, notably the Maya and their allies in the Yucatan."

 mexico.65.t: "Mexico Is Unable to Pacify Yucatan"
 mexico.65.d: "While [MEX.GetLeader] promised to defeat the Rebellious Yucatan in less than year, it is clear by now that is no longer the case.

 mexico.65.a: "We must watch our backs."

 mexico.66.t: "Yucatan Manages to Survive"
 mexico.66.d: "We have managed to drive out the Mexicans and for the first time, we are now a free and independent republic. Now that the war is over, we can focus on rebuilding the country, of course we must never let our guard down against the Mexicans that we will seek to take our land."

The question is shall we end our rebellion and rejoin Mexico or fight onwards for independence once and for all?"
 mexico.68.a: "Let us Rejoin Mexico. (Game Over)"
 mexico.68.b: "Let us continue the fight for independence!"

 mexico.69.t: "The Yucatan ends their rebellion"
 mexico.69.d: "The rebellion in the Yucatan has ended thanks to [MEX.GetLeader]'s policy of restoring the laws that Zapata passed. These laws plus assurances that their autonomy and traditions shall be respected and that the traitors that started this conflict would be punished harshly have helped to convince the Yucatec to rejoin the country."
 mexico.69.a: "Viva Mexico."

 mexico.70.t: "The Yucatan Fights on"
 mexico.70.d: "The Yucatec have decided that they rather fight on for independence despite our efforts to restore the laws of Zapata and punish the traitors. Very well, the Yucatan shall be pacified soon enough."

### National Populist events ###
 mexico.100.t: "Patria vs La Raza"
 mexico.100.d: "Synarchism as an ideology is still in its infancy, with the main unifying factor being a resistance to liberalism and secularism. Under the Synarchist banner there exist both Legionarists following the pattern of the Iron Guard, and the other followers of La Raza. The inherent conflict between these forces concerns their racial policies. The Synarchist leadership under Salvador Abascal sees the traditional caste system of Mexico as the correct social order, including the enshrinement of Catholic priests. La Raza as promoted by José Vasconcelos proports the idea of a Hispanic race as the true ideal of Mexican patriotism. These ideas are more similar to Integralism in Brazil than Legionarism. The party has begun to split with La Raza members becoming disillusioned with the lack of support they receive within the party. How can we correct this?"
 mexico.100.a: "We must appease these dissidents."
 mexico.100.b: "They have no choice, ignore their demands."

 mexico.106.t: "Juventudes Sinarquistas"
 mexico.106.d: "The Juventudes Sinarquistas is a youth programme that has been created by [MEX.GetLeader]. The organisation is to help train the youth the ideals of Sinarchismo and traditional Catholic values. Structurally the organisation is similar to scouting groups that exist in other countries though controlled by the Mexican government. The Juventudes Sinarquistas has two main sub-organisations, one for boys and one for girls. By making sure that the youth are enrolled in the organisation this will make sure that they never sway from the government's ideals."
 mexico.106.a: "The youth are the future."

 mexico.108.d: "Crowds of loyal Sinarquist supporters and alike gathered in Mexico City to hear a speech given by José Antonio Urquiza after brave Mexican forces secured the long lost territories ceded in the Treaty of Guadeloupe Hidalgo.

When he moved to Agua Prieta, Governor José María Maytorena named him deputy. After the Decena Trágica, Calles began recruiting men from Agua Prieta to oppose Victoriano Huerta and in 1913 would join up the revolutionary forces to fight. Calles ended up under the direct orders of Alvaró Obregon, and became colonel and commander of Hermosillo by late 1913. In October of 1914, Calles successfully defended the city of Naco for three months, managing to hold against all odds, and due to this he was turned into brigadier general by February 1915. With the success of the Plan de Agua Prieta and Obregon's rise to power, Calles became his second in command, and would become a vital member of the staff for years to come, although he has been seen dabbling more into politics in the recent years.§!\n\n§YNotes: Member and one of the main candidates of the Partido Nacional Revolucionario.

His first course of action was to take Cuautla from Porfirista forces, which was successful despite suffering heavy casualties.

He started his adventure when Laureano Lopez Negrete, the owner of the Sombretillo Ranch where Doroteo worked, abused his older sister. In reprisal, he shot Laureano, and then evaded capture from the authorities, after which he escaped to the nearby mountains, where he was found by a gang of bandits lead by a man called Francisco Villa. He'd accompany the bandits for years, raiding and pillaging around Durango until Francisco Villa was shot in a firefight, and named Doroteo his successor to lead the gang. Doroteo then adopted the name of his saviour, and continued his criminal activity. With the leadership of the gang secured, Villa decided to join forces with Ignacio Parra, and started his attempts to stop, sometimes violently, the abuses committed by the landlords to the peasants in Chihuahua. In the late 1910 he'd join the Movimiento Maderista, and through cunning and bravery, 'Pancho Villa' reached the higher ranks of the Mexican Revolutionary Army with the nickname 'The Centaur of the North', and even managed to shortly become Governor of Chihuahua. He'd anger the American government in 1916 after attacking the small town of Columbus in New Mexico, which lead to the Punitive Expedition led by John Pershing, who was never able to catch Villa despite all his efforts.
