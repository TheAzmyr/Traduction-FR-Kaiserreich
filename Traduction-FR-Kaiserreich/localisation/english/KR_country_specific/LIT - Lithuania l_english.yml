 ### Parties ###
 LIT_totalist_party: "Aušrinė"
 LIT_totalist_party_long: "Studentų socialistų aušrininkų draugija 'Aušrinė'\n§gThe Society of Socialist Students 'Aušrininkai' is a semi-formal student movement which first organised around the magazine Aušrinė ('Morning Star') in 1910. Not long after its inception, it took a straight dive towards socialism, influenced by Benoît Malon and Peter Kropotkin, and, ultimately, revolutionary syndicalism. It was forced out of schools and universities and ultimately banned by executive order in 1923, but continued spreading its ideas through the underground. Using dummy organisations to cover up their activities and publishing their magazine through ever-changing names and titles, and sometimes taking up left-wing terrorism, they remain a headache for any Lithuanian government. Aušrinė stands out among worldwide Syndicalist organisations by being a 'writers' party' - the absolute majority of their members are intellectuals, poets and writers, as such it is a lively community and their ideology is untainted, but they command little popular support.§!\n"

 LIT_syndicalist_party: "Aušrinė"
 LIT_syndicalist_party_long: "Studentų socialistų aušrininkų draugija 'Aušrinė'\n§gThe Society of Socialist Students 'Aušrininkai' is a semi-formal student movement which first organised around the magazine Aušrinė ('Morning Star') in 1910.

 LIT_radical_socialist_party: "LSDP"
 LIT_radical_socialist_party_long: "Lietuvos socialdemokratų partija - Radikalusis sparnas\n§gNot all members of the Social Democratic Party of Lithuania are 'soft' social democrats - plenty of them believe that merely reducing the negative effects of capitalism is not enough. The radical wing of the LSDP calls for no compromise with Lithuania's status as a monarchy, nor its domination by Germans, and instead looks towards France and other Syndicalist states as its potential saviours. Despite these radical stances, they maintain a constant presence in the party and hold significant influence over its leadership as well as ordinary membership.§!\n"

 LIT_social_democrat_party: "LSDP"
 LIT_social_democrat_party_long: "Lietuvos socialdemokratų partija\n§gThe Social Democratic Party of Lithuania is the largest party of the Lithuanian left wing and proudly calls itself the oldest political party in Lithuania. Its history stretches to 1896, although it only became a Lithuanian party foremost in 1902. Although the LSDP commanded great influence over the Lithuanian independence movement, it was forced out of the Council of Lithuania due to its republican stances, an act which many hold grudges for ever since. In the independent Kingdom of Lithuania, they have moderated their anti-monarchist position, but its condition as an anti-German, anti-capitalist party has allowed it to become a big tent movement for the Lithuanian left wing. The core of the party is influenced by the German SPD and Austromarxism, and while it remains a democratic party at heart, it does not disdain socialist or outright Syndicalist influence. This Petri dish of left-wing ideas collected to one organisation makes it rather difficult to achieve a consensus, however.§!\n"

 LIT_social_liberal_party: "KPL/LLK"
 LIT_social_liberal_party_long: "Lietuvos lenkų komitetas/Komitet Polaków na Litwie\n§gThe Committee of Lithuanian Poles is the largest of many ethnic minority parties in the Kingdom of Lithuania, originally founded in 1920 to contest the first democratic elections in the country. It is a party that unites Lithuanian Polish interests and campaigns for issues that matter to them first and foremost, such as cultural and political autonomy, funding of Polish language education in Białystok and Vilnius regions, and deeper economic, cultural and political ties with Poland. Aside from these core issues, the party is largely non-ideological, the political positions of their members varying from aristocratic conservatism to near-Syndicalism.§!\n"

 LIT_market_liberal_party: "Santara"
 LIT_market_liberal_party_long: "Demokratinė tautos laisvės santara\n§gThe Democratic National Freedom League, more commonly known as just Santara, is a minor liberal political party in Lithuania which was first founded by many famous Lithuanian politicians in exile in 1917. Based in Petrograd, this party campaigned for Lithuania's future as a democratic republic and tied its future with the Entente, believing that Russian victory in the Eastern Front and Lithuanian autonomy within a greater Russian federation would be the best outcome for Lithuania as a whole. This never came to be, however, and Santara was thus cast out of any influence in building the foundations of the Kingdom. Santara is commonly known as the 'party of veterans'. Its leaders all became involved in politics before the Weltkrieg and were invited to hold ministries in various past governments, but the party does not command nearly as much influence among the population. It is an outlet for liberal ideas in Lithuania - Santara champions secularism, religious tolerance, liberalism, and sees itself as a mediator between the left and the right.§!\n"

 LIT_social_conservative_party: "LKDP"
 LIT_social_conservative_party_long: "Lietuvos krikščionių demokratų partija\n§gThe Christian Democratic Party of Lithuania is the largest party of the Lithuanian right-wing, originally founded in 1917, although its predecessor movements are claimed to have started operating as early as 1890. A leading proponent of conservatism and monarchism in the Lithuanian political arena, it laid down the foundations for the Kingdom of Lithuania and has remained an extremely influential party since. Because of its vast size, the party has several distinct wings - some of its members are more willing to endorse liberal ideas and reconcile with the left, others are not; some see Lithuania's future as a loyal disciple of Germany, some are wary of being constantly reigned over by godless Lutherans, others are more nationalistic. Some are influenced by Christian corporatism or even Christian socialism, others are staunch conservatives or free market proponents. Regardless of the wing, however, ideas such as Christian ethics, monarchism, and democracy unite them all.§!\n"

 LIT_authoritarian_democrat_party: "LTS"
 LIT_authoritarian_democrat_party_long: "Lietuvių tautininkų sąjunga\n§gThe Lithuanian Nationalist Union is the successor to the National Progress Party, founded in 1929, and holds the right-wing nationalist niche which the Christian Democrats have pretty much abandoned. The Nationalist Union unites around the larger-than-life persona of Antanas Smetona, once the head of the Council of Lithuania and the first Prime Minister of Lithuania, turned the leader of the Lithuanian nationalist cause. The failure of the Memel Uprising of 1928 taught Smetona that militant resistance against the Germans is futile, and freedom from their grasp can only be achieved through the ballot, thus the Nationalist Union disdains any talks of armed rebellion and instead seek to implement their ideas (mostly) democratically. It believes in the need for a strong executive, in corporatist and state-controlled economics, support for Lithuanian nationalism, and the ever-present slogan of 'Lithuania for Lithuanians!'. Despite its professed allegiance to the King and Democracy, it comes into direct conflict with the Lithuanian left wing, which sees them as a direct road towards authoritarianism.§!\n"

 LIT_paternal_autocrat_party: "TPP-N"
 LIT_paternal_autocrat_party_long: "Naujoji Tautos pažangos partija\n§gAs the extreme members of the Lithuanian Nationalist Union have seized control of the party, moderate members of the party from an older extraction have chosen to split, restoring what they describe as the more moderate and aristocratic roots of the party - the Party of National Progress. Though still ethnic Lithuanian nationalist, it holds more moderate stances.§!\n"

 LIT_national_populist_party: "LAF"
 LIT_national_populist_party_long: "Lietuvos aktyvistų frontas\n§gThe Lithuanian Activist Front is an underground Lithuanian nationalist movement founded in 1930, in the aftermath of the Memel Uprising. It unites the radical, militant and reactionary forces of the Lithuanian political spectrum, those who cannot find a home in any legal political parties. Knowledge about how the movement operates is very scarce, but it is believed that they have no universally recognised leader and are split among several influential political visions - despite that, however, a unifying feeling of hatred towards Germany, the government in Vilnius, and non-Lithuanians keeps them from dissolving. They spread their ideology through magazines such as Vairas, Naujoji Romuva and Tautos Kelias, as well as organise protests, raids and occasional terrorist activity. It does not contest elections nor has it ever tried to, believing itself to be above the 'psychosis of democracy'.§!\n"

 LIT_paternal_autocrat_PLECH: "Plechavičius' Clique"
 LIT_paternal_autocrat_PLECH_long: "Plechavičius' Clique\n§gAfter the failure of the civilian government to prevent the death of King Vytautas, General Povilas Plechavičius has stepped up and taken control of the government. Focused only on the survival and stability of Lithuania, he has no qualms about allies or methods.§!\n"

 LIT_national_populist_wolf_party: "Geležinis Vilkas"
 LIT_national_populist_wolf_party_long: "Geležinis Vilkas\n§gThe Iron Wolf, or 'Voldemarininkai' are followers of Augustinas Voldemaras and his militant and ultranationalist teachings. For a long time, they have formed the main part of the LAF's armed operations. The Iron Wolf's vision of a perfect Lithuanian state has been best expressed by one of the organisation's chief ideologues, cavalry officer Juozas Tomkus: 'The Weltkrieg and the years after have proven two things - that all wars from here on out will be won by not just arms and regular troops, but the mobilisation of the entire nation for war; and that Lithuania is destined to end up at war eventually, and anyone foolish enough to believe that these are times of peace has no place in the country. The only way for Lithuania to survive is for it to become an army - from the man in the front to the woman in the back, from the professor in the laboratories and worker in the factories, every single person and every single resource must be dedicated to national defence. Every single Lithuanian must be trained to wield a weapon and know his place in the armed nation. Such a nation will be completely unassailable and impossible to destroy.'§!\n"

 LIT_national_populist_vairas_party: "Vairas"
 LIT_national_populist_vairas_party_long: "Vairas\n§gVairas is a movement formed around writer Vytautas Alantas. Their main belief is the creation of a purely national ideology, one that would be entirely Lithuanian with no foreign elements, and so encompassing that Lithuanians would be liberated not only politically, but also culturally. Their Second National Revival will look back into Lithuania's pagan traditions, which, in Alantas's eyes, are the truest expression of Lithuanian national identity - it idealises a dream where the Lithuanian nation is subservient to a truly nationalist society under a single unquestioned leader, the Vadas, whose citizens are willing to give their life for the Nation, which worships traditions of time immemorial instead of 'the psychosis of democracy'. Despite their totalitarian intentions, it maintains liberal economic intentions, its leaders such as Domas Cesevičius expressing that a Lithuanian National Revival must create a society where every Lithuanian can achieve well-being through his own effort and individual innovation.§!\n"

 LIT_national_populist_romuva_party: "Naujoji Romuva"
 LIT_national_populist_romuva_party_long: "Naujoji Romuva\n§gNaujoji Romuva began as offspring within the Lithuanian Christian Democratic movement, but under Antanas Maceina they drifted into more radical politics. Inspired by integralism and distributism, the Young Catholic movement identifies its prime enemy as social and economic injustice. Maceina calls for radical land reform, redistribution of wealth and the uprooting of 'bourgeois-liberal thought' from the Lithuanian identity. Even the Catholic Church would not be safe from redistribution - after all, one can worship Christ without gold and silk, so why should the Church hold onto its wealth when there is so much suffering they could alleviate? In place of capitalism, they push forward a society of economic democracy and Christian corporatism. However, they challenge Syndicalists and social democrats alike by declaring that only an ethnically pure society can be socially and economically just. To them, Lithuania can only be Lithuanian, and a Lithuanian must live and die immersed in national and Catholic culture. While the Naujoji Romuva nominally believe in democracy, they also express that 'temporary' strong hand leadership is necessary and even mandatory to achieve all of their radical reforms.§!\n"

 LIT_secure_maceinas_cooperation_desc: "It appears that Antanas Maceina has come out of hiding after the raid of Kauno Radiofonas, and is wishing to speak to Šalkauskis. The first crack within the LAF has been made - or could it be Maceina wishing to save his own hide?"

 LIT_capture_alantas: "Capture Alantas"
 LIT_capture_alantas_desc: "With the location of Vytautas Alantas obtained, it appears this has been leaked to the more militant members of the Ateitis. The Ateitis have more reason than most to see Alantas and his followers, the Vairininkai, removed due to their actions against Ateitininkai-affiliated Priests. Though Šalkauskis is against such actions, it appears those militant members are taking matters into their own hands."

 LIT_demoralisation_campaign_desc: "Policy of divide and conquer has proven effective in handling the insurgency. By promising less harsh punishments for ordinary activists, and by showcasing the constant failures of their leadership, many of the radicals have started to question their motivations."

 LIT_enact_federal_police_act: "Enact the Police Act"

Should the King remain or be forced to abdicate? Is their goal a social democratic welfare state or a path to Syndicalism? Are they here to break Lithuania free from Germany or begrudgingly accept that it's impossible? These questions and many others plague the loose coalition formed by Steponas Kairys from the very beginning, and they will need to be answered in the following years. For many, Social Democrats are associated with their brutish opposition to the monarchy and their contacts with Lithuanian syndicalism.

 LIT_define_the_party_programme: "Define the Party Programme"
 LIT_define_the_party_programme_desc: "The Social Democratic Party of Lithuania has consistently adapted its party programme to fit with the times. Steponas Kairys's 'On the Questions of Our Party Programme' in 1929 cleared up several questions on the party's policy - most notably, while it did not abandon the idea of an impending socialist revolution, it moderated to allow for work in a democratic state before the conditions for socialism can be achieved. It is about time to define this stance further and choose whether to maintain it or abandon it."

 LIT_subordinate_the_army: "Subordinate the Army"
 LIT_subordinate_the_army_desc: "The Royal Lithuanian Armed Forces have historically been a haven for right-wing nationalism, and as time passes and our conflict with the far right turns increasingly violent, even a military coup is no longer out of question.

These pillars further stem from his Christian values, influence from Distributism, and belief that Lithuania is a unique fusion of Eastern and Western cultures and should preserve both.\n\nUnder his guidance, the LKDP will seek to guide the federation of corporate federations in economics, culture and society, make amends with Lithuania's minorities and grant them wide-reaching cultural autonomy, and reform the political system from the ground up. The Seimas, according to the project, shall be divided into three Houses - a universally elected 'House of Ideological Communities', a 'Little Seimas' composed of Federal representatives, and a 'House of Corporations' directly elected from trade unions, business owners, and agricultural communities. Each of the three Houses of the Seimas will appoint five ministries, all of whom will be controlled by the State Control Commission and finally overseen by the King.\n\nThe ultimate goal of the project is to form an 'optimal state', one where the voice of any citizen is heard, one whose inhabitants identify with 'Lithuania' as a concept rather than one of many numerous ethnic groups, much like they had in the Grand Duchy centuries past.\n\nThis state, according to Šalkauskis's vision, will serve as a bridge between East and West and lead all of humanity to a new age.\n\n§CFederalisation Progress§!: [?LIT_federalisation|0+]%"

 LIT_open_new_AMBO_factories_desc: "Initial testing and trials have demonstrated the success of the ANBO VIII in the air. As we find ourselves again drawn into the conflagration of global war, we will need to build more and more of the ANBO series. The state will help provide funding for our workshops under Karo Aviacijos Tiekimo Skyrius to encourage the production of more military aircraft."

 LIT_48_hour_mobilisation: "48-Hour Mobilisation"
 LIT_48_hour_mobilisation_desc: "The '48 Hour mobilisation' idea is that the Lithuanian Army will be ready to fight and all our defences prepared if war breaks out. Given our army's current state of disorganisation, this won't be easy to achieve. We will begin war games and training exercises to ensure that the Lithuanian Army will soon achieve mobilisation rapidly."

 LIT_implement_NCOs: "Implement NCOs"
 LIT_implement_NCOs_desc: "The officer corps of the Lithuanian Army has long been in a series of neglect. To reform our infantry, we will have to start at the ground up and begin implementing non-commissioned officers; men hand-picked explicitly for their leadership and management. Our new NCOs will ensure that missions and orders can be executed without waiting explicitly from headquarters."

 LIT_instil_a_fighting_spirit: "Instil a Fighting Spirit"
 LIT_instil_a_fighting_spirit_desc: "Most of the regular infantry lacks the motivation and morale to carry out their duties effectively. We will begin a rigorous programme of drilling and propaganda to inspire the men of Lithuania once again to take up arms to defend their country. Over time, we will expect to see a more disciplined fighting force, soldiers willing to give life or limb for their nation."

 LIT_complete_the_army_reform: "Complete the Army Reform"
 LIT_complete_the_army_reform_desc: "After an intense period of intense and significant reforms, the Lithuanian Army has been brought back to its former glory. With our army reforms a complete success, the days of a disorganised and chaotic Lithuanian Army are over. Our army now reaches the standards of our neighbours, and we are more ready than ever to combat threats externally and internally."

 LIT_integrate_the_riflemen_union: "Integrate the Riflemen Union"
 LIT_integrate_the_riflemen_union_desc: "The Lithuanian Riflemen Union (Lietuvos Šaulių Sąjunga, LŠS) is a state-supported paramilitary organisation that serves as a bridge between the army and society. The men of the Union are trained militarily, and some are even excellent marksmen given the sportsmanlike culture of the Union. Our military will need experienced riflemen; we will implement the legislation necessary to incorporate the Union into the Lithuanian Army."

 LIT_young_riflemen: "The Young Riflemen"
 LIT_young_riflemen_desc: "Our country is small, and we will need to prepare even the youth for war if our nation's independence is at risk. The 'Young Riflemen' is a division of the LŠS focused on the youth (11-18) and gives them a taste of service in the military. To prepare the Fatherland for the worse, we will endorse this organisation and give it the funding to ensure that our youth will be ready in times of crisis."

 LIT_death_or_dishonour: "Death or Dishonour"
 LIT_death_or_dishonour_desc: "Our small nation will find itself threatened as war comes to us - the fate of Lithuania is at stake. Lithuanians, young and old, male and female - will fight for every inch of their nation's soil. We must glorify patriotic death and teach all Lithuanians that to die for their country; is a tremendous honour one can have."

 LIT_expand_the_officer_corps: "Expand the Officer Corps"
 LIT_expand_the_officer_corps_desc: "The backbone of every military is the officer corps, and despite our implementation of non-commissioned officers, we will need more men capable of leading the Lithuanian Army. We will provide exceptional training and curriculum for those in the officer corps as we expand the size and strength of the Lithuanian officer corps."

 LIT_study_infiltration_tactics: "Study Infiltration Tactics"
 LIT_study_infiltration_tactics_desc: "Experience in the later stages of the Weltkrieg showed that elite and disciplined infantry detachments far from headquarters could infiltrate enemy lines and cause havoc. Our military will study these tactics, perfected by the Reichswehr and Baltische Landeswehr, to properly implement them into the Lithuanian Military Doctrine."

 LIT_establish_the_war_school: "Establish the War School"
 LIT_establish_the_war_school_desc: "Our military has no academy to call its own, and while we can always rely on studying at foreign academies, we cannot rely on them to develop and grow our military and doctrine. With this in mind, we will establish the Vilnius War School to train a new generation of officers and generals while also emphasising the study and development of new doctrine and tactics."

 LIT_hold_the_line: "Hold the Line"
 LIT_hold_the_line_desc: "General Żeligowski's clique, along with his supporters from southern Lithuania, wish to embrace a more defensive and cautious posture to ensure that Lithuania is left unmolested by any potential enemy. They advise us to focus on playing for time until reinforcements from other Reichspakt nations can help us."

 LIT_territorial_defence_force: "Territorial Defence Force"
 LIT_territorial_defence_force_desc: "The 'Lietuvos Vietinė Rinktinė' is our nation's planned initiative to launch a volunteer militia force in times of crisis. Its goal is to call up reservists and militiamen in the hopes of quickly reinforcing our frontlines and solidifying our nation's defence further."

 LIT_improved_terrain_usage: "Improved Terrain Usage"
 LIT_improved_terrain_usage_desc: "No one knows this land better than us; for generations, our ancestors have long used it as their natural fortification. As we prepare our nation's defences, we will begin scoping out favourable terrains such as forests and hills for us to create emplacements and ambushes. An enemy that attempts to march into Lithuania will suffer the consequences of not understanding our land."

 LIT_defensive_strategems: "Defensive Stratagems"
 LIT_defensive_strategems_desc: "Our nation will prepare to brace for the worse. We will expand our trench and fortification systems and emphasise behind-the-lines partisan actions to harass and strike the enemy from the rear. To ensure that our troops have equipment at all times, we will strengthen the communications systems. No enemy will be able to break through our carefully planned defences."

 LIT_movement_warfare: "Movement Warfare"
 LIT_movement_warfare_desc: "General Plechavičius and his ilk are mostly veterans of the Russian Civil War, where they learned the value of cavalry. This clique has embraced offensive warfare with the use of fast-moving units to flank the enemy with infantry supporting these elements. They seek to increase motorisation and mobility of our forces."

 LIT_prepare_for_enemy_tanks: "Prepare for Enemy Tanks"
 LIT_prepare_for_enemy_tanks_desc: "Our forces currently lack the means and weaponry to deal with the armoured beasts that are tanks. As our troops will constantly be on the move, we will ensure that they are equipped with anti-tank weaponry to penetrate even the thickest armour. This will help solidify our defensive and offensive capabilities as we will not have to worry about enemy armour."

 LIT_army_motorisation: "Army Motorisation"
 LIT_army_motorisation_desc: "Much of our army's transportation and movement is still horse-drawn. If we focus our military on speed entirely, we should invest in motorisation such as trucks and vehicles. While the horse has always been an influential part of our military, the truck is not constrained to fatigue, and we will be able to achieve greater speeds on the battlefield."

 LIT_old_generals_new_tactics: "Old Generals, New Tactics"
 LIT_old_generals_new_tactics_desc: "Our military has decided to embrace the art and beauty of speed in warfare fully. Emphasising striking critical points in enemy lines with mobile, manoeuvrable forces, we will focus on speedy offensives to drive the enemy into confusion. Despite our military staff being relatively old, they will be proponents of this new form of warfare; to quickly dash the enemies into smithereens!"

 LIT_local_rifle_manufacturing: "Local Rifle Manufacturing"
 LIT_local_rifle_manufacturing_desc: "Our country lacks a proper armaments industry to prepare ourselves for the conflicts to come. We will petition local manufacturers and gunsmiths and begin converting factories for military use to reduce our reliance on foreign weapons in times of war. This will also serve to strengthen our economy as we take steps to construct a proper military industry."

 LIT_acquire_tank_licences: "Acquire Tank Licences"
 LIT_acquire_tank_licences_desc: "Our industry is not capable yet of producing heavily armoured vehicles, but this should not stop us from pursuing such means. We will begin surveying tank models from Bohemia, Sweden, and Germany to see which ones will suit our military better. By importing foreign tank models, we will have modern tanks and tanks of superior craftsmanship."

 LIT_seek_military_contracts: "Seek Military Contracts"
 LIT_seek_military_contracts_desc: "Our government must look towards the armaments industry for the procurement of modern weapons and equipment. By securing contracts with foreign and domestic weapons industries, we will escalate our military production and capabilities. We can rest assured that our soldiers will be fully equipped at all times with the most modern of weapons."

 LIT_build_the_linkaiciai_artillery_workshops: "Build the Linkaiciai Artillery Workshops"
 LIT_build_the_linkaiciai_artillery_workshops_desc: "The government has decided to endorse the plans for the construction of the Linkaičiai Artillery Workshops - an ambitious industrial plant capable of housing thousands of workers that will provide for every Lithuanian soldier the rifles, ammunition, and artillery needed to wage a modern war in defence of the Fatherland. Our goal for this factory plant is to be one of the most modern weapons manufacturers in all of Europe."

 LIT_military_industrial_complex: "Military-Industrial Complex"
 LIT_military_industrial_complex_desc: "To aid the developing Lithuanian military industry and ensure our nation is indeed ready for war, the government will have to take drastic measures to prepare Lithuania. We will shift civilian industries to military production while ensuring that both the military sector and the nation's military profit extensively. Not only will this strengthen our economy, but it will also strengthen our national defence."

 LIT_develop_klaipeda: "Develop Klaipeda"
 LIT_develop_klaipeda_desc: "One of the largest ports and cities in Lithuania, Klaipėda will become the home of Lithuania's maturing naval industry. We will begin a government requisition of dockyards and ships in Klaipėda to ensure that the Lithuanian Navy will have the most modern fleet in all of the Baltic Sea."

 LIT_coastal_guard_expansion: "Coastal Guard Expansion"
 LIT_coastal_guard_expansion_desc: "One of the most essential seas for maritime trade and travel, the Baltic Sea will indeed become a battleground as the nations of Europe once again devolve into war. As a pivotal member in the Baltics, the Lithuanian Coast Guard must be expanded in terms of our number of ships and sailors to ensure that travel and trade remain safe. We will encourage further enlistment into the naval forces and ensure that our sailors are well-trained and prepared for all that is to come."

 LIT_seaplanes: "Seaplanes"
 LIT_seaplanes_desc: "An interesting proposal from Gustaitis is the intertwining between the navy and the air force. As our navy lacks any major heavy warships to damage enemy fleets, we can instead fit planes for sea travel to ensure that they can act as naval bombers. Taking inspiration from other nations, seaplanes ensure that Lithuania's seas are guarded against the skies above."

 LIT_naval_construction_contracts: "Naval Construction Contracts"
 LIT_naval_construction_contracts_desc: "We will need more ships if we are to become a naval power in the Baltics. Our current fleet size is not impressive enough, and to boost our numbers, we will seek out contracts with the naval industries domestically and abroad. This ensures that not only are we getting new and modern ships but also ships of superior quality."

 LIT_submarine_development: "Submarine Development"
 LIT_submarine_development_desc: "Submarines are not new, but our young nation has yet to embrace them fully. Having submarines will give us an unparalleled advantage in the seas as we can strike the enemy from the depths. With submarine pens in Palanga, the Lithuanian naval forces can procure foreign submarines to begin our submarine programme. We will hire advisors from foreign countries to instruct and incorporate submarines into our Navy."

 LIT_establish_the_navy: "Establish the Navy"
 LIT_establish_the_navy_desc: "Lithuania has never really quite had a strong maritime tradition, with our only access to the sea being the small port of Palanga. Nonetheless, through our development of other ports, our training and expansion of the coast guard, and our growing naval industry, we have built quite an impressive naval force for ourselves. It is now appropriate that we begin to transition the Lithuanian coast guard into a proper Lithuanian Navy."

 LIT_raise_the_banners_of_resistance_desc: "The German tyrants may have been expelled for now, but as war wages across Europe, we will inevitably be drawn towards it. Let us mobilise our underground forces and form them into units which will stand the line against their ranks!"

 LIT_tripartite_showdown: "The Tripartite Showdown"

 LIT_cult_of_death: "The Cult of Death"

 LIT_a_militarised_society_desc: "Surrounded by enemies within and outside, Lithuania must be prepared to fight at all times. All Lithuanians, boys, and girls, will be expected to give their life for the fatherland; every citizen will become a wolf - this is the way to protect our dear country. Like the heroes of old, so too will the Lithuanians of today willingly shed blood for their beloved nation!"

 LIT_economy_for_war: "Economy for War"

 LIT_seize_foreign_assets: "Seize Foreign Assets"
 LIT_seize_foreign_assets_desc: "Having secured our independence from Germany, we will no longer be slaves to their finances.

We will nationalise foreign industries and seize what is left as now they will help strengthen our new state. Glory to Lithuania!"

 LIT_mandatory_military_training: "Mandatory Military Training"
 LIT_mandatory_military_training_desc: "The threat of war constantly looms with the despicable Kaiser to the West and the monstrous Russian bear to the East. While our nation is small compared to the aggressive imperialists and their manpower great, we will make them pay for every inch of Lithuanian soil they take. We will pass a national conscription law decreeing that every Lithuanian capable of carrying a rifle will serve in the armed forces. Truly a Sparta of the Baltics, this is the only way Lithuania can survive!"

 LIT_central_economic_planning: "Central Economic Planning"
 LIT_central_economic_planning_desc: "The freer the economy, the less control we have. All of Lithuania must be brought into line with a government-made economic plan, so that the resources of our people and land may be used for the good of all."

 LIT_an_army_of_labour: "An Army of Labour"
 LIT_an_army_of_labour_desc: "Every worker in Lithuania is a soldier, fighting for Lithuania with their hammers, their spades, and all the other tools of work. If the workers are organised like an army and trained like one, they will be that much more productive."

 LIT_an_army_of_research: "An Army of Research"
 LIT_an_army_of_research_desc: "As we begin the national conscription, we realise that quite a few Lithuanian intellectuals are willing to help develop Lithuania's research industry. As we transform our nation into a militarised state, we will prioritise military research to help us develop the latest weapons. Not only will our armies be the most disciplined in the Baltics, but they will also be the most advanced."

 LIT_nationalist_land_reform: "Nationalist Land Reform"

 LIT_assert_economic_independence: "Assert Economic Independence"
 LIT_assert_economic_independence_desc: "Alone, we are stronger. Lithuania does not need to rely on foreign powers for economic assistance like a pathetic vassal. As we declare to the world our independence, we will also signal our financial independence by embracing an economy of autarky. This will reduce our reliance on foreign goods and increase our national self-sufficiency, thus helping Lithuania reach its true potential."

 LIT_end_democracy: "End Democracy"
 LIT_end_democracy_desc: "Democracy is a complete sham; the bickering of politicians and parties will achieve nothing... There only needs to be one party, the LAF, and one leader, our great Vadas. Under his protection, we will be made strong. Thus to strengthen the LAF and the Lithuanian state, we will disband the Seimas once and for all. No longer will we be bound by their pathetic ways, but now we are reborn a new Lithuania!"

 LIT_single_party_state: "Single Party State"
 LIT_single_party_state_desc: "Only one party is fit to rule Lithuania, the LAF. The LAF is run by true Lithuanian patriots, men, and women willing to free Lithuania from the influence of subservient enemies externally and internally. Those that disagree will be 'cleansed' and replaced by true patriots, as we will not tolerate those who are ideologically unreliable."

 LIT_the_party_corporation: "The Party-Corporation"
 LIT_the_party_corporation_desc: "Experience in the Weltkrieg taught us that the line between civilian and combatant became heavily blurred; all civilians helped their nations win a total war against their enemies. We will adopt a similar practice in which all Lithuanians will form a society to wage an all-out war of glory on their enemies. There will be only those who work and build Lithuania, those who will fight for Lithuania, and those who will lead Lithuania."

 LIT_vairas: "Vairas"
 LIT_vairas_desc: "Even within the LAF, some were not willing to bring the complete national revival of our nation. Voldemaras and his followers were too weak... their idea of a Lithuania, pathetic and susceptible to destruction. No longer! Under the Vairas, we will complete the national revival - pathetic Lithuania will be a fragment of the past, and behold, a new mighty one shall take its place!"

 LIT_break_the_power_of_the_clergy: "Break the Power of the Clergy"
 LIT_break_the_power_of_the_clergy_desc: "The clergy's role is to save the people's souls, not tell them who to vote for or how to serve Lithuania. That is our job, and we should remind the clergy of this fact. While we will not infringe on the clergy's existence, we will ensure that people do not look to the church in these times but rather to the Lithuanian heroes of old. Christianity is dead; let the modern Lithuanian look to the gods and spirits of his ancestors for guidance."

 LIT_permanent_national_revival: "Permanent National Revival"
 LIT_permanent_national_revival_desc: "It does not stop here. The National Revival will be made permanent, Lithuania a true utopia that links us with our ancestral roots.

 LIT_privatise_public_properties: "Privatise Public Properties"
 LIT_privatise_public_properties_desc: "We will adopt a relatively liberal economy. Under the leadership of Domas Cesevičius, the newly reborn state of Lithuania will be a society where every Lithuanian will be able to achieve well-being through his efforts and innovation.

 LIT_naujoji_romuva_desc: "A new Lithuania rises from the ashes but one that protects the Lithuanian worker. The Lithuanian proletariat has long suffered under the yoke of the bourgeoisie, and it is time for their chains to be broken!

A new movement of Young Catholics will help transform our nation into the glorious Organic State!"

 LIT_a_total_national_state: "A Total, National State"
 LIT_a_total_national_state_desc: "Under Maceina's leadership, we will transform Lithuania into a national state. Under the National State, we will not need politics and particularism; these insecurities will only seek to divide our nation and make us weak. Instead, we will look to the days of Lithuanian glory and hope to replicate them. The state will focus on displaying the glory of the Lithuanian nation in film, art, and literature - a new golden age of Lithuania will soon dawn!"

 LIT_interim_revolutionary_leadership: "Interim Revolutionary Leadership"
 LIT_interim_revolutionary_leadership_desc: "Some fools believe that one man must lead Lithuania and one man only. Nonetheless, the process to reform Lithuanian society is revolutionary, and the revolution is at risk of being threatened and destroyed by enemies everywhere. For now, we will grant extraordinary powers to Maceina; this is just temporary, but this will ensure that a strong leader will lead Lithuania to ensure our transformation of society."

 LIT_establish_national_purity: "Establish National Purity"
 LIT_establish_national_purity_desc: "The unpleasant aspects of Lithuanian society will be wiped clean. The streets will become peaceful again, and order will be restored in all the towns. Our society and culture have long been perverted by foreigners such as the Germans and the Poles. To restore the glories of Old Lithuania means that once again, Lithuanians will speak Lithuanian. Speaking Lithuanian will be mandatory in all schools and public places - to reverse centuries of damage."

 LIT_control_the_economy: "Control the Economy"
 LIT_control_the_economy_desc: "Black Monday has shown us that the Capitalist system is indeed corrupt and decadent - capitalism has brought nothing but a decay of morals, a decay of faith, and a decay of nationalism. We will ensure that wealth is shared among Lithuanians to create a just Lithuanian society. We will even compel valued institutions like the Church to give up their wealth for the less fortunate - and ensure they comply."

 LIT_enforce_economic_democracy: "Enforce Economic Democracy"
 LIT_enforce_economic_democracy_desc: "Together, Lithuanians will work for the strength and growth of the organic state. Workers will be organised in unions to empower them over their overlords, giving power to the Lithuanian proletariat.

 LIT_expropriate_the_landlords_desc: "Their wealth and power are ours, an end to the bourgeoisie! So long have we suffered from the chains of capitalism, and that time is over. The landlords of Lithuania will lose their status, and their land will be distributed to those who need it more. Finally, the Lithuanian who works the land will own it instead of being nothing more than a serf. No longer will the Lithuanians have to slave endlessly for the bourgeoisie; we will no longer be bound to their corrupt ways."

 LIT_break_apart_monopolies: "Break Apart Monopolies"
 LIT_break_apart_monopolies_desc: "Monopolies are a threat to our control of the nation and reflect the unfairness of capitalism. We will have to remove them as they bring nothing but further despair to our country. We will seize their assets and wealth and distribute them to the Lithuanian peoples. They will learn a lesson to not hoard wealth from their own people. No longer will they have any power over us; Lithuania will be free at last!"

 LIT_a_parliament_of_corporations: "A Parliament of Corporations"
 LIT_a_parliament_of_corporations_desc: "As described by the Apostle Paul, all people and components are functionally united like a human body. This is indeed the meaning of the Organic State, a true democracy, where all Lithuanians will come together in unions and groups to form a national parliament. This ensures that Lithuanians from all walks of life will coordinate a prosperous future for Lithuania and ensure that the nation's true interests are being represented."

 LIT_establish_social_welfare: "Establish Social Welfare"
 LIT_establish_social_welfare_desc: "The Organic State cares for all members of society. Those who are less unfortunate will be cared for as this is in the goodwill of our Christian character.

 LIT_begin_wealth_redistribution: "Begin Wealth Redistribution"
 LIT_begin_wealth_redistribution_desc: "Our true goal is the ultimate redistribution of wealth in Lithuanian society. We will ensure that wealth is redistributed evenly; even the church will come under scrutiny.

We will eradicate the aristocrats and the elite, ensuring that their wealth will help the suffering proletariat."

 LIT_end_capitalism: "End Capitalism"
 LIT_end_capitalism_desc: "There is nothing viler in this world than the archaic system of capitalism. Capitalism has brought nothing but misery and despair to Lithuanians - remember the suffering that Black Monday brought our nation.

 LIT_KR_gathering_storm_desc: "The Kingdom of Lithuania was founded after the Weltkrieg as a monarchy closely tied to the German Empire - its vast non-Lithuanian population and ceaseless nationalist resentment marking its history up to today. The old king, Mindaugas II, passed a long time ago, and his heir is widely seen as a step backwards, lacking both the character and the skill to rule. While nefarious forces plot in the open and in the shadows alike, can the Kingdom survive the challenges ahead, however impossible they may seem?"

### Intro Screen ###
 LIT_country_intro_header: "The Kingdom of Lithuania"
 LIT_country_intro_content: "The Kingdom of Lithuania was officially founded on December 11th, 1917, and this declaration was reiterated on February 16th, 1918, by the Council of Lithuania, a body of Lithuanian politicians and public figures elected in the Vilnius Conference during the Weltkrieg. The formation of the Kingdom was far from easy, however - the declaration split Lithuanian nationalists and forced the republican-leaning Social Democrats (LSDP) out of the Council, while it only took until 1919 for the Germans to take the declaration of independence seriously. Ultimately, they confirmed Wilhelm von Urach as Mindaugas II, the first King of Lithuania since 1263.\n\nThe Constitution of 1920 established Lithuania as a bicameral constitutional monarchy, guaranteeing basic rights such as freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of religion and universal suffrage. To this day, it remains one of the most liberal constitutions in the Reichspakt. Lacking serious competition, the Christian Democrats (LKDP) have formed the government since the country's inception, while the economy of the country remains dominated by German Junkers and company branches. The absolute majority of them are established in Vilnius, declared a city for 'German Development' - the lion's share of foreign investment is directed there and it has become a jewel of the Oststaaten, a place where you can hear five different languages on your way from the grocery shop. The rest of Lithuania is underdeveloped, however. This is most obvious in the so-called 'Outer Lithuania', the Slavic-speaking southern districts, which, more often than not, look like they are stuck in the 19th century.\n\nVytautas II, also known as Karl Gero von Urach, is the King of Lithuania since 1928. The incumbent Prime Minister is Leonas Bistras, representing the Christian Democrats."

 LIT_country_intro_header_1: "Memory of the Memel Uprising"
 LIT_country_intro_content_1: "Nationalism in Lithuania, briefly quenched by the declaration of independence at the end of the Weltkrieg, saw a resurgence during the 1920s. The laws of free expression allowed a revival of Lithuanian culture - numerous nationalist inclined arts and culture movements began to appear, the Prussian Lithuanian philosopher Vilhelmas Storosta-Vydūnas initiated a revival of the old Lithuanian faith, and dissatisfaction with Lithuania's Oststaat status started to rise. These nationalists started to rally around the Party of National Progress (TPP) - a minor nationalist party founded in 1916 and led by Antanas Smetona, one of the signatories of the Declaration of Independence, who ended up sidelined after independence due to his conflict with the Christian Democrats.\n\nIn 1928, upon the death of Mindaugas II, Lithuanian nationalists sought to take advantage of the disorder and seize Vilnius and Klaipėda. The attack on Vilnius never took place, while the one on Klaipėda became known as the 'Memel Uprising' or 'Memel Massacre', resulting in the death of 50 armed militiamen at the hands of the German garrison. Smetona distanced himself from the uprising, the TPP dissolved under the public backlash and reformed to the Nationalist Union (LTS), while the event became a rallying moment for Lithuanian nationalism.\n\nNowadays, Lithuanian nationalists remain split between two approaches. Those rallied around Antanas Smetona and the 'moderate' LTS believe that it is possible to achieve a second National Revival through democratic means. Others have become disillusioned with what they perceive as a sham, however. Uniting the most radical and extreme strands of Lithuanian nationalism is the informal movement known as the Activist Front (LAF)."

 LIT_country_intro_header_2: "The Government of Leonas Bistras"
 LIT_country_intro_content_2: "Representing the Christian Democrats (LKDP), Leonas Bistras is the fifth Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Lithuania, appointed after the election of 1933. A doctor by profession, Bistras is an active member and chairman of the Party and, as expected of the Christian Democrats, a devout Catholic. Since the beginning of his term, Lithuania has experienced economic growth thanks to growth in Germany and Lithuania's close ties to its economy, as well as education reforms. This economic growth means that the Bistras cabinet is confident enough in its stability to consider projects once seen as nothing but impossible dreams, such as acquiring Lithuania's own port or organising land reform.\n\nDespite this, it is expected that this will be the last time the Christian Democrats head a majority government alone. Minority parties, such as the Committee of Poles in Lithuania (LLK) and the Jewish Labour Bund (Bundas), are growing stronger, and so are the Social Democrats (LSDP), having recovered their strength after the slump in the 1920s. Finally, the growth of Lithuanian nationalism has culminated in the Nationalist Union (LTS) becoming a serious challenge to the establishment. Though dismissed as a party of violent radicals, their leader, Antanas Smetona, is committed to achieving his vision through democratic means.\n\nWith the planet drawing closer to... something, it remains to be seen where Lithuania shall turn."

 LIT.6.t: "Black Monday Hits Lithuania"
 LIT.6.d: "The German stock exchange has crashed and its rippled effect is beginning to be felt in Lithuania, especially in the capital. German-run businesses seem to be laying off people en masse causing a slow rise in unemployment. The full extent of the crisis has yet to be measured, but only misery and woe are sure to follow."
 LIT.6.a: "O Dieve..."

 LIT.7.t: "Big Troubles in Little Białystok"
 LIT.7.d: "Białystok, like the rest of the Kingdom, hasn't been spared from the brunt of the effects of Black Monday. This has further aggravated tensions between the Lithuanian Polish and Jewish communities within the city. This has stemmed from the Jewish businesses being able to weather the effects of Black Monday due to their tight-knit community and Polish Jewish Bund affiliations. As a result, many Polish businesses have gone under, and in some cases being bought by their Jewish counterparts, serving as a further slap to the face.\n\nMany have turned to Stanisław Narutowicz, the leader of the Committee of Lithuanian Poles, desperate for some form of relief from the situation. After a short meeting, Narutowicz with other Lithuanian Polish leaders has stated that they would need to turn to Vilnius for support and this could mean a reduction in autonomy in the region."
 LIT.7.a: "Of course, we will support all in the Kingdom in this time of need."
 LIT.7.b: "They are on their own..."

 LIT.8.t: "A Form of Normality Restored"
 LIT.8.d: "With the Government providing limited aid to Białystok, a level of normality has been restored in the city. The tension between the Poles and the Jewish population has dropped in the city, with people just trying to get on with their lives as opposed to ruining their neighbours. With this small gesture, the Polish community within Białystok are slowly starting to look to Vilnius for aid as opposed to Warsaw. Time will tell how Białystok weathers the storm."
 LIT.8.a: "Well that's one spot fire extinguished."

 LIT.9.t: "Białystok Turns to Warsaw"
 LIT.9.d: "With the Government not wishing to support the Lithuanian Poles in their time of need, they have looked to other avenues to help recover. This led to them reaching out to those in Warsaw with sympathetic ears and small enterprises were set up in the city to assist those Lithuanian Poles in need. The growing resentment towards the Jewish community has boiled over resulting in several Jewish-owned businesses being targeted by arsonists, who were heard shouting in thick Masovian accents denouncing the Bund and comparing them to syndicalists. Order was restored quickly, though the offenders seemed to have disappeared into the night, with rumours circulating that the arsonists weren't locals. The following morning, it is evident that the Poles in Białystok are looking away from Vilnius and towards Warsaw for their needs."
 LIT.9.a: "It's one thing after another with those insufferable Poles."

 LIT.10.t: "Cracks in the Bund"
 LIT.10.d: "General Jewish Labour Bund in Lithuania has a turbulent history, to say the less. Formed in 1897, the Bund promotes the idea of a 'Nation in a Nation', with it strongly advocating for the use of the Yiddish language as a Jewish national language and promoting Socialist ideals that borderline Syndicalism in their nature.\n\nIt first split when Lithuania was annexed by Germany from the Russian Empire, resulting in the Bund seceding from the General Jewish Labour Bund in Lithuania, Poland and Russia. Now a second split is occurring with the Litvaks (Lithuanian Jews) and Polish Jews in Białystok butting heads over the direction of the Bund. The Litvak community generally wish to promote the Nation with a Nation idea and there are those who wish to become more politically active as opposed to the Polish Jews, with Zionism gaining traction amongst its community and the promotion of Hebrew over Yiddish. With no common ground to be found between the two groups, the Bund has further fragmented between those in the South and those in the North."
 LIT.10.a: "Wait, how does this affect the steel works in Białystok?"

 LIT.11.t: "Reaction of the Bistras Government"
 LIT.11.d: "Black Monday and the ensuing economic crisis has left the country completely unprepared. The government of Leonas Bistras operated with the belief that the German golden era would outlast them, and thus did not build up a sufficient money reserve to counter the crisis. An emergency session of the cabinet has been summoned to consider all possible solutions for recovery.\n\nThe summit has sharpened the long-present divisions within the Christian Democrats. A growing wing of the party finds itself enthralled by the ideas proposed by the professor and Christian ideologue Stasys Šalkauskis, a proponent of democratic corporatism and federal devolution of the Kingdom. This 'Federalist' wing believes that assuring autonomy from the German markets and rallying the trust of the people in corporate economics can help weather the crisis.\n\nPrime Minister Bistras is not willing to throw the Germans under the bus, however. He and the old guard of the party have instead drawn up a series of initiatives known as the 'Galvanauskas Plan', named after our Minister of Finance. This plan involves the development of a sustained industrial heartland in Vilnius and Kaunas and bailing out the worst off of the German Junkers to keep foreign capital flowing into the country.\n\nThe announcement of this plan has not resonated well with the Lithuanian people, however. The inhabitants of the Southern regions, so-called 'Outer Lithuania', protest this abandonment, and so do the Social Democrats and the Nationalist Union. In their eyes, this reliance on German investors is what caused the crisis in the first place. The first results of the injected surplus seem to be positive, however."
 LIT.11.a: "Let's see how it goes."

 LIT.12.t: "German Investors Abandon Lithuania"
 LIT.12.d: "The Galvanauskas Plan has not yielded the results which the government has sought - German businesses and investors continue abandoning the Lithuanian market. Their companies are liquidating what little assets they have left and are putting their facilities on sale in order to recoup at least some of their losses.\n\nNature does not tolerate a vacuum, however, and other actors are starting to take advantage of this investor flight. In Vilnius, several of the most notable companies have been purchased by Jewish business owners, unions and worker cooperatives, many of them in cooperation with Lithuanian and Polish entrepreneurs. The Jewish Labour Bund in Lithuania, wielding its influence within the community and especially among Jewish labour unions, several of whom it directly operates, helped orchestrate these buyouts. Native companies in Kaunas and Białystok, Lithuanian and Polish respectively, have begun buying out former German assets at a low price, seeking to wrest control of the market from German competitors after having been suppressed for many years by not-so-clean business practices.\n\nThe transition has been far from soft, however. Thousands of workers in Lithuanian cities have been laid off and are starting to radicalise. The local companies organise these buyouts with pretty much all of the remaining assets they have, leaving their future uncertain - and, in fact, many of these freshly established cooperatives and companies are reported to declare bankruptcy in the following weeks. Should we cling onto our guns, our economy will go through this transition and come out more independent - however, when it is so painful and so difficult, will we even be able to weather the storm?"
 LIT.12.a: "The longer term is what matters."

 LIT.13.t: "Call for Land Reform"
 LIT.13.d: "The question of land reform was one which the first governments of Lithuania had failed to answer. In the aftermath of the Weltkrieg, many of the manors across Lithuania ended up abandoned and ripe for taking - the Polish nobility started repatriating, and Russian nobles fled for their homeland. Radically-minded members of the legislature called for distributing the land to the poor and the landless, and this measure was even endorsed by several members of the Christian Democrats, such as Mykolas Krupavičius, who saw this as a way to stifle the growth of socialism among the peasantry. Ultimately, however, no consensus was reached and many of the abandoned manors were bought out by Germans at a low price. Large agribusinesses established themselves in the Lithuanian countryside, causing resentment among the landless peasantry and even serving as a way for some German families to settle down in Lithuanian territory.\n\nBlack Monday has changed the situation in the countryside, however. Many of the formerly thriving conglomerates are now desperately trying to sell their land, even at the lowest possible price, and pull out from the country to save operations in their homeland. This presents an opportunity for the Lithuanian government to step in, buy out the land and ensure a fairer distribution of land ownership in the countryside."
 LIT.13.a: "Change is needed, then."

 LIT.14.t: "Nationalist Union Rallies"
 LIT.14.d: "The news of growing Bundas influence in the Vilnius industrial hub and other major cities have begun to rouse major dissent among the population. This dissent is, first and foremost, raised by the Lithuanian Nationalist Union (LTS). Their deputies in the Seimas, most notably Antanas Smetona, have begun speaking out against the transition of industry in Vilnius, and have lodged bill after bill trying to break this monopoly. Younger, more active and frustrated members of the Party have taken matters into their own hands, however, and started organising mass protest rallies across cities such as Kaunas, Šiauliai and Vilnius.\n\nTheir anti-semitism is thinly-veiled, if hidden at all - these nationalists call for a 'Lithuania for Lithuanians' and their marches, more often than not, devolve into violence, such as vandalism of German or Jewish owned shop fronts or, in some cases, direct assault against peaceful citizens. The following sparked a harsh reaction from the Constabularies - several of the most radical activists were detained, while additional police officers were dispatched to ensure order in the cities.\n\nImmediately upon the conclusion of this nationalist fever, eyes were turned towards the leaders of the Nationalist Union, Antanas Smetona and Augustinas Voldemaras. Both of them handled the situation tactfully, however. Smetona publicly denounced the actions of what he described as 'loose cannons barely affiliated with his party'. Voldemaras was under police investigation due to suspicions of having a hand in these actions, but they were cut short and Voldemaras himself expressed his support for the stance of his party's leader."
 LIT.14.a: "Doubt besets me..."

 LIT.15.t: "Recovering German Business"
 LIT.15.d: "After a period of falling out, a small upsurge of investment in Lithuanian businesses by German investors has been registered. Soon enough, the Seimas received a petition from several of their companies, requesting a second chance. They promise that, if they are provided with grants, loans and preferential status in the Lithuanian market, they promise to maintain operations in Lithuanian territory and provide employment for their citizens, helping us recover from Black Monday."
 LIT.15.a: "I suppose Germans have their uses."

 LIT.16.t: "Nationalist Marches Continue"
 LIT.16.d: "Nationalist activism has been continuing across Lithuanian cities for months, sparked by poor economic conditions, the Government's perceived reliance on German interests, dissatisfaction with Jewish dominance over the Lithuanian sector, and Lithuania's status as one of the Oststaaten. However, as time passes, it seems that the initial hostility raised by the riots seems to have faded. No more cases of violence or vandalism are being reported and even some of the most unsavoury slogans have been dropped in favour of more moderate ones, though they still call for expanding Lithuanian autonomy and ensuring Lithuanians as the superior ethnicity in the Kingdom. Any and all ideas of acting against the LTS have had to be dropped for now.\n\nThe Nationalist Union has been running a very strong campaign in general. Despite his advanced age, Antanas Smetona has been campaigning everywhere from Palanga to Vilnius, and so have all of his underlings, each of them offering an alternative to Syndicalism and Christian conservatism alike, a strong, national rule, free from the shackles of foreigners, a chance for Lithuania to carve its own fate. For the first time since its founding, the Nationalist Union may provide a challenge to the established parties in the election."
 LIT.16.a: "What is that old fox up to?"

 LIT.17.t: "Palanga Agreement"
 LIT.17.d: "In 1920, the first democratically elected government of Lithuania was forced to sign a punitive agreement regarding the trade flowing in and out of the country. According to the terms of the agreement, all Lithuanian foreign trade must flow through the ports of Memel, Libau and Riga, all three of which are controlled by Germany and the Baltic Duchy. The agreement also stipulates harsh restrictions on the types of products which are allowed to be traded through the ports, and several types of tolls. Ultimately, it means that Lithuanian foreign trade is severely restricted and reliant on the German whim.\n\nOne of the campaign promises of Leonas Bistras and the LKDP was to re-negotiate the agreement and 'carve Lithuania out a window to the West', and now they are ready to act upon this promise. Palanga, Lithuania's sole town on the coast of the Baltic Sea, holds the potential of becoming an adequate port, if only the Germans allow to ease restrictions on local docks and shipbuilding. While preparations for the diplomatic mission are ongoing, our Ambassador to the German Empire, Jurgis Šaulys, offers support in the form of contacts among German businessmen and diplomats - of course, this would come with a price."
 LIT.17.a: "No, this must be seen as a Lithuanian effort."
 LIT.17.b: "How much is it going to be then, Hans?"

 LIT.18.t: "A Lithuanian Envoy"
 LIT.18.d: "An envoy has arrived from Lithuania, wishing to invite representatives from our government to negotiate a new trade agreement. Currently, due to the treaty of Brest-Litovsk and our subsequent agreements, we have restricted Lithuanian trade from the Baltic Sea, their goods either go through Memel or Riga. It now appears they wish to have unrestricted access to the Baltic Sea, circumventing Memel and Riga."
 LIT.18.a: "Very well."
 LIT.18.b: "No, we shall keep the restrictions."

 LIT.19.t: "The Palanga Agreement"
 LIT.19.d: "Several days of intense negotiations between the Lithuanian and German delegations have passed, and despite negotiating from a weaker position, our delegates have triumphed. Surprisingly, their German peers were passive, agreeing to several of the requests which had initially been thrown forward as a probes, and ultimately, the summit concluded with Germany agreeing to lift restrictions on our naval trade.\n\nIt seems that large number of German export companies suffered so much in the late economic crisis, that immediate value of the Palanga trade has fallen greatly in German economic priorities."
 LIT.19.a: "Out of the frying pan, into the fire."

 LIT.20.t: "The Germans Reject the Agreement"
 LIT.20.d: "Several days of intense negotiations between the Lithuanian and German delegates have passed, and despite our best efforts, it seems that the Germans have rejected our proposal. Unsurprisingly, the German diplomats were aggressive, agreeing to none of the requests initially being thrown forward as a probe. Ultimately, the summit concluded with Germany keeping the status quo on our naval trade.\n\nIt seems that even though large number of German export companies suffered much in the late economic crisis, the German negotiators were focused on long-term economic consequences."
 LIT.20.a: "Damn them!"

 LIT.21.t: "Shlomo Kleit - a new leader of the Bundas"
 LIT.21.d: "Arkadi Kremer, the long-time leader of the Jewish community in Lithuania and rightful bearer of the title 'Father of the Bund', has passed. His contributions to the Bundist movement and the left-wing movement in the Russian Empire, in general, cannot be understated, and neither can his efforts to reestablish the General Labour Bund in Vilnius after the end of the Weltkrieg. At the end of his life, he has seen the Bundas achieve the apogee of their power in Lithuania thanks to Black Monday, and could give away the reins of the organisation in peace. His successor is Shlomo Kleit, a Jewish socialist, and leader of the left wing of the Bundas.\n\nKleit immediately took the Bundas in a new direction. While his predecessor was wary of involving the Jewish community in politics and instead opted to just endorse policies most beneficial to their members, Kleit is a strong supporter of the Social Democratic Party and an opponent of the growing current of anti-semitic nationalism. This has culminated in an official agreement between the LSDP and the Bundas. The Bundas have offered its funds to the Social Democrat campaign and agreed to a coalition ticket - several Jewish labour leaders shall stand under the Social Democratic Banner in their constituencies, and all Lithuanian Jews are encouraged to support this joint ticket in the next elections.\n\nThough the right wing has begun crying out about 'Jewish syndicalist infiltration of the LSDP', they can only concede that the leader of the Social Democrats, Steponas Kairys, has made yet another successful move."
 LIT.21.a: "Seems like the next election may not be so one-sided."

 LIT.22.t: "The Federalists Rise"
 LIT.22.d: "Despite the successful groundwork for Lithuania's recovery from Black Monday laid, Prime Minister Leonas Bistras has not managed to escape getting under fire by his own peers. Faced with successful campaigns from the LSDP and LTS alike, an emergency meeting of the Christian Democratic party has been held to formulate a response. In the meeting, the Prime Minister was blamed for an inability to predict an economic downturn and for failing to prevent the party's rivals from taking advantage of the downturn. Bistras tried to defend himself to the best of his ability - and, ultimately, as a sudden new speaker declared, the blame rests on everyone's shoulders. Decades of unchallenged leadership have left the party complacent and unwilling to present something anew.\n\nThis speaker was Stasys Šalkauskis, a Lithuanian professor and ideologue, the founder of democratic, federal corporatism in Lithuania, which he dubs the 'Optimal System'. Though he has only been a member of the party for a few years and only entered politics recently, he had already gathered a strong base of support from young, active members of the party. Šalkauskis presented the tenets of his programme, calling for a corporatist, integral economical and political system, and reconciliation with Lithuania's numerous ethnic groups under a federal democratic government. The ultimate goal of the 'Optimal System' would be a nation where all of its members can live up to Christian teaching and values, where everyone's voice is heard in the government and where everyone knows they contribute to a greater whole.\n\nLacking the stamina or the charisma to try to sway the mass of the party back to the old guard, Bistras opted to concede, allowing Šalkauskis to speak for the duration of the meeting."
 LIT.22.a: "Democratic integralism? Impossible."

 LIT.23.t: "Leonas Bistras Announces Retirement"
 LIT.23.d: "With only a small amount of time left until the election of 1937, the Prime Minister of Lithuania, Leonas Bistras, has announced that he will not stand for his seat in Kaunas nor will he remain Prime Minister should the Christian Democrats achieve a coalition yet again. The politician has cited that he does not believe that clinging onto politics will do any good for him or his country, and that a new generation of faithful Christians will succeed him as the flagbearers of the Christian Democratic Party - tactfully alluding to the growing Federalist wing in the LKDP.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether history will judge him as an inept optimist who brought Lithuania into economic recession, or a calm silent leader who did the best he could to alleviate the Kingdom's troubles. For now, however, the impending election of 1937 will decide who shall succeed him."
 LIT.23.a: "A shake-up is always good."

 LIT.24.t: "Komitet Polaków na Litwie"
 LIT.24.d: "Compared to other ethnic minorities in Lithuania, the Poles are the most politically active, organised under the banner of the Committee of Poles in Lithuania (KPL/LLK). The party was initially founded as a non-partisan union of candidates in 1920 by Polish landowners, intellectuals and businessmen to campaign for their rights. Since then, it has consistently scored the districts in the Białystok region, and Polish-majority neighbourhoods in Vilnius such as Naujoji Vilnia. The venerable leader of the Committee is Stanisław Narutowicz, one of the signatories of the Act of Independence of Lithuania - due to his age, experience and non-confrontational attitude, he is respected not just by Lithuanian Poles, but by many Lithuanians as well.\n\nAs the election of 1937 of approaches, the Committee has strengthened its grip over the Białystok region, and its endorsement may be critical in winning the election."
 LIT.24.a: "The silent minority."

 LIT.25.t: "The Polish Dilemma"
 LIT.25.d: "In an election as close and intense as this one, even the smallest endorsement may be critical in tipping one of the competitors over the edge. This time, it is the turn of the Committee of Poles in Lithuania to be this kingmaker - their current neutrality in the election has seen both the Social Democrats and the Christian Democrats vying to get their attention. Of course, the Nationalists are uninterested in such an idea entirely.\n\nThe Social Democrats have long been endorsing the idea of pluralism - granting wide cultural autonomy to all of the ethnic groups within Lithuania, promoting multiculturalism and socialist internationalism, and though most of the members of the Committee are put off by the idea of Syndicalism or even democratic socialism, the idea of pluralism eludes them. Stanisław Narutowicz has received a personal phone call from Steponas Kairys, the leader of the LSDP, offering cooperation in the electoral campaign and a coalition afterwards.\n\nHowever, the Christian Democrats have not been any less active in enticing the Polish vote. Now led by Stasys Šalkauskis, they reach out to several high-ranking members of the party, explaining their programme of federalisation and offering autonomy greater than the Social Democrats could ever promise. Finally, not all Polish activists even seek to ally with any party, believing it to be a betrayal of their principles of representing Polish interests first and foremost."
 LIT.25.a: "The Social Democratic Party gains their support!"
 LIT.25.b: "Šalkauskis's sweet promises of a federation are compelling..."
 LIT.25.c: "The Poles aren't swayed to either side, giving the LTS an easy win."

 LIT.26.lkdp.d: "With the conclusion of the election of 1937, the Christian Democrats and their coalition allies have voted to propose Stasys Šalkauskis to become the new Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Lithuania. King Vytautas II has welcomed the new head of government and granted his cabinet royal assent.\n\nIn a rather brief speech, Šalkauskis thanked the monarch for his assent, stating that, in his Optimal System, the monarch takes up a central role, serving as the supervisor of the government and the manifestation of its spirit as a body. Protection and blossoming of Christian culture and traditions, the defeat of the economic crisis, and a new, corporatist path for Lithuania are all cited in his inauguration speech."
 LIT.26.lsdp.d: "With the conclusion of the election of 1937, the Social Democrats and their coalition allies have voted to propose Steponas Kairys to become the new Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Lithuania. King Vytautas II has welcomed the new head of government and granted his cabinet royal assent.\n\nIn a rather candid speech, Kairys has declared that the era of futile conservatism is over, not hesitating to throw out remarks about the 'antiquated' practice of a monarchy, the need for greater accountability from the government and an era of the people, rather than the landowners and the capitalists. The King has withheld any reactions to the speech for now, but he was clearly far from happy with the words being said."
 LIT.26.lts.d: "With the conclusion of the election of 1937, the Nationalist Union and their coalition allies have voted to propose Antanas Smetona to become the new Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Lithuania. King Vytautas II welcomed the new head of government and granted his cabinet royal assent.\n\nAntanas Smetona's inauguration speech acknowledges that he serves as the bearer of the King's will, but is filled to the brim with undertones of Lithuania moving forward without German control. He denounced factionalism and Syndicalism within Lithuanian society, seeing any divisions, be they cultural, religious or political, as hazardous. Compared to his speech, the King's closing speech is clearly just a second act."
 LIT.26.a: "May God protect the king."

 LIT.27.t: "Smetona's Gambit"
 LIT.27.d: "The race for the election was as tight as it could possibly be. Though the Christian Democrats lost a sizeable amount of support, they remain popular and Šalkauskis's democratic corporatist ideas are starting to attract a new batch of voters. However, the LKDP is not uniform, nor all of its members are willing to go ahead with the new direction that the party has taken.\n\nAntanas Smetona, the leader of the Nationalist Union, has chosen to turn this crack into a ravine. During the last few months, he has been reaching out to as many members of the LKDP old guard as he possibly could, calling in old favours from their days in the Council of Lithuania, swaying others with fearmongering on radical Young Catholics driving the country to the ground, or simply enticing others with promises. Ultimately, this has resulted in a split in the Christian Democratic Party - a sizeable portion of the old guard, led by Mykolas Krupavičius and Vladas Mironas, have broken ties with the LKDP leadership and declared the founding of their own party, the Homeland Union (Tėvynės sąjunga). The Homeland Union claims to be the successor of the old traditions of the Party, and it has won support from many among the LKDP's old guard."
 LIT.27.a: "The election is turning even more interesting..."

 LIT.30.t: "Inauguration of the new Seimas"
 LIT.30.d: "With the election over, and [LIT.GetRulingParty] having won the elections, a new Seimas needs to be inaugurated.\n\nAccording to custom, the first session of the Seimas is opened by the Monarch after a procession through, and the members of the new cabinet are sworn in by him personally.\n\nThis procedure was heavily attacked by socialist newspapers, claiming that the mere presence of the King would taint the will of the people. While most of the country does not share this opinion, a small, personal audience with the new Prime Minister could be viewed as more supportive of democracy. As an added benefit, this would not expose the King to any possible attacks during the opening ceremony."
 LIT.30.a: "A King must guarantee democracy."
 LIT.30.b: "A personal audience is less intrusive."

 LIT.31.t: "Securing the Procession"
 LIT.31.d: "According to custom, the King will take part in the first session of the Seimas, and swear in the new government.\n\nThe situation after Black Monday is still tense, as many blame Germany, and thus by extension the King for their misfortune. To complicate matters, the LAF has also begun protesting the elections, claiming the results illegitimate, and only a "reaffirmation of Lithuania as a lapdog of Germany".\n\nThese events have caused senior Army commanders to propose using the Army as the security force of the King for the upcoming procession to the Seimas."
 LIT.31.a: "The security of the King is a police matter."
 LIT.31.b: "No ill must befall the King, use the Army!"

 LIT.32.t: "Death of the King!"
 LIT.32.d: "As he headed to the opening of the Seimas, King Vytatuas II was assassinated by a group of LAF activists. The obviously well-trained paramilitaries, overpowered the lightly armed police escort to get to the King who died during the firefight, along with multiple members of his entourage.\n\nFearing an all-out riot, General Povilas Plechavičius moved in army units to the major thoroughfares of Vilnius and declared martial law, decrying the civilian government as one unable to upkeep order in the country.\n\nWithout any way of being able to change the mind of Plechavičius, the swearing-in of the civilian government was abandoned, leading him to be the de facto leader of Lithuania."
 LIT.32.a: "Will the Germans let this happen?"

 LIT.33.t: "King Assassinated!"
 LIT.33.d: "As he headed to the opening of the Seimas, King Vytatuas II was assassinated by a lone shooter from one of the houses along his route. The inexperience of his Army escort only led to further chaos, when they returned fire on the building, injuring multiple civilians, but missing the gunman.\n\nThe news spread through Vilnius like wildfire, and it was only well-timed police intervention that managed to stop any sort of civil unrest.\n\nWith the country thrown into disarray and the government not having been formally sworn in, the Lithuanian Seimas has acted with a surprising amount of tact, creating a government of national unity headed by the Polish-Lithuanian Stanisław Narutowicz. The unity government has been joined by all major parties, and has a stated aim of protecting the liberty of the citizens and the territorial integrity of Lithuania.\n\nWhile no military leaders have personally taken responsibility for this debacle, it looks only minor officers will be the scapegoats. To avoid any political backlash, all major Army commanders have reassured the civilian government that they will help keep order in the country."
 LIT.33.a: "Let us hope politicians can sort this out."

 LIT.40.t: "Raštikis' Reforms"
 LIT.40.d: "'A small country with a meagre military industry, and an even smaller resource base, is not fit for the same strategies and tactics which are fielded by its neighbours', states the beginning of Raštikis's drafted document on comprehensive Lithuanian army reforms. 'In any conflict, the Lithuanian army will only see use in two possible ways: as a supporting force for the greater Imperial German Army, or as a last-ditch defence against a foreign invader if and when this German army fails. As such, the reforms to the Lithuanian army must keep in mind these two ways and optimise its effectiveness in both'.\n\nThese reforms include:\n- An emphasis on military aviation, led by Antanas Gustaitis, and air-ground cooperation.\n- The modernisation of the equipment of the Lithuanian army.\n- An overhaul of officers' education, and the formation of a modern command structure.\n- The transformation of the army into a 'people's force'.\n- The development of trust and recognition of the authority of the army among the civilian population.\n- The restructuring of the Lithuanian Riflemen Union to serve as the bridge between the army and the public.\n- A reduction of mobilisation time from 8-10 days to a maximum of 48 hours.\n- The drafting of two comprehensive plans for the defence of the country:\n    - Plan 'R' - a plan for defence against an invading Russian army\n    - Plan 'F' - a plan for defence against the unlikely chance of a French\n      breakthrough through Germany and invasion of Eastern Europe.\n\nThe document has been presented to the Prime Minister and the King and approved for implementation within a five-year timeframe."
 LIT.40.a: "Vienybėje jėga, tikėjime pergalė!"

 LIT.41.t: "The Hardships of Establishing a Navy"
 LIT.41.d: "To establish a navy for a country which has not had a naval force since the seventeenth century is no easy task, especially when the time and resources granted to the project are far from generous. With the announcement that a separate Lithuanian Naval Force will be founded as a branch of the Royal Lithuanian Armed Forces, the officers and bureaucrats worked day and night to establish a directory for the force in Palanga and all the logistics needed to get the organisation going.\n\nAs it soon turned out, the head office of the Lithuanian navy needs a flag to fly in front, like all government institutions in the country, and it just so happened that the central authority of the armed forces had not provided them one, so the naval officers had to make one in haste. As naval officer Povilas Julius Labanauskas would later write in his memoirs, they had to use a yellow sheet as a base for the flag and paint the necessary colours in less than twenty minutes before authorities from the headquarters showed up, so they had to make do with what they had - and as the Chief of Staff arrived, he witnessed not the Lithuanian green and red bicolour flying in front, but a yellow-green-red tricolour, as the top third of the flag had not gotten painted in time. One of the officers almost immediately compared the flag to that of Ethiopia, calling it 'something African', but Raštikis's opinion was different - he played along, called it 'a quaint banner' and gave the Lithuanian Naval Force the permission to adopt the tricolour as their symbol.\n\nThough born out of a complete mistake, the Yellow-Green-Red Tricolour has become the flag of the Lithuanian Naval Force - even if it will forever remain the butt end of jokes."
 LIT.41.a: "It will do, for now."

 LIT.42.t: "The Lithuanian Panzer"
 LIT.42.d: "Within the General Staff's plan to turn the Lithuanian Armed Forces into a professional fighting force, armoured units have played an interesting and sometimes elusive role. The so-called 'tank', or 'panzer', proved its worth as a reliable machine of war during the Weltkrieg, and the postwar period has seen more and more advanced designs in the field of armoured vehicles. Some even say that the tank will be a deciding factor in any future wars, as ridiculous of a proposal as it is. Junior officers in the Lithuanian army, taught in German academies, have returned with a similar outlook towards warfare. These officers such as Antanas Sidabras, Sergejus Fanstilis and Juozas Tomkus have been calling for a Lithuanian armoured unit to be formed. Despite the reluctance of conservative officers, the General Staff eventually agreed, and a commission of officers has been formed to search for a possible armour design for Lithuania to adopt.\n\nOur cadre of officers have identified several tank designs which could be... 'borrowed' for our armed forces, each one coming from a separate foreign arms company. Each design has its advantages and disadvantages, as well as associated costs. Though there are fears that moving away from standardised German equipment could be a logistical nightmare, the officer cadre assures that these problems have been accounted for."

 LIT.43.t: "Lithuanian Rifle Union: Women's Auxiliary"
 LIT.43.d: "The Lithuanian Riflemen Union has allowed women to serve within the organisation ever since its conception, but despite the patriotism of our women, they have played a minor role among its ranks ever since. Their role has mostly been limited to actions such as crowdfunding, public support, and minor support roles such as cooking and nursery. Now that the Riflemen Union is being integrated into the greater framework of the armed forces, and public attitude in our society slowly starting to change, Lithuanian women have not been forgotten and are no longer going to be limited to such minor roles. Under the advice of Chief of Staff Stasys Raštikis, the LŠS has formed additional women's auxiliary units and expanded their listing of roles for women in the organisation. Though they are still not allowed to hold rifles and march alongside men, they can work in field hospitals, as mechanics and technicians, as staff in signal and logistics companies, and in similar non-combat support positions. This decision has not been universally accepted, however, and there've been murmurs among older, conservative officers about allowing the other sex closer to the battlefield."
 LIT.43.a: "For an independent Lithuania!"

 LIT.44.t: "Lithuanian Rifle Union: Appealing to Minorities"
 LIT.44.d: "Since the inception of the Lithuanian Riflemen Union, it has been staunchly an ethnic Lithuanian organisation. The founders of the Lithuanian Riflemen, commanders Vladas Putvinskis and Vincas Krėvė, envisioned it as a spiritual successor to what they believed to be the traditions of the Grand Ducal army, an organisation of 'knights' loyal to Lithuania first and foremost. Though some non-Lithuanian volunteers have joined the organisation throughout the years, they are few and far between. Since Lithuania has now chosen to integrate the Riflemen into the greater framework of the army, this loss of a large population pool has become an issue. An idea has been proposed to allow the formation of auxiliary units tailored towards other ethnic groups in Lithuania. These Polish, Belarusian and Jewish legions would, obviously, have to appeal to the patriotism of their respective culture, exalting their respective heroes and historical pride. Is this something we really want?"
 LIT.44.a: "An example of our policies at work!"
 LIT.44.b: "This goes too far!"

 LIT.45.t: "Oro desanto būrys"
 LIT.45.d: "Under the guidance of Gustaitis and several German advisors, the formation of a Lithuanian Paratrooper unit is becoming more of a reality. Gustaitis' enthusiasm shows no bounds as his first lot of recruits seem to be a mix of glider enthusiasts and naive boys from the countryside. However, this grandiose plan has hit its first hurdle - the funding was only able to cover the training facilities and a fraction of the equipment required, with Gustaitis using his connections within the Government and the aviation industry to assist him.\n\nA young second lieutenant has approached Gustaitis with a solution to this: opposing the expensive endeavour of attempting to form Lithuanian Paratroopers, he proposed for the unit to be repurposed as an elite infantry formation that specialises in the harsh terrain of southern Lithuania. Of course, this would come with its own hurdles, as Gustaitis is attached to the newly formed Lithuanian Air Force as opposed to the Army - but this is nothing new in military history, with even the concept of the 'Marine' being a new thought for some. Alternatively, a second proposal has been put forward: instead of forming an elite formation, have these men dispersed throughout the Army, providing their expertise to commanders out in the field."
 LIT.45.a: "Good idea Ramanauskas, Lithuania needs an elite fighting formation."
 LIT.45.b: "A Lithuanian Jäger detachment sounds interesting."

 LIT.50.t: "The King's Grand Plan"
 LIT.50.d: "The news of King Vytautas II's 'Grand Plan' was quick to travel across the nation, national press starting to speculate on the monarch's next move - only for everyone to sigh in disappointment when the day arrived. Having immersed himself in books on Lithuanian history during the past year, he came across the Palace of the Grand Dukes, and now stands before the Seimas offering to dedicate the Kingdom's resources towards restoring it.\n\nThe Palace of the Grand Dukes was constructed in the 15th century to serve the monarchs of Lithuania and, later on, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth - however, it stopped being a suitable residence for a monarch during the Swedish Deluge in the 17th century, and was fully demolished after the Partitions of Poland. Right now, the royal family of Lithuania resides in Verkiai Palace to the north of Vilnius, and though it is more than adequate for a monarch, the King has offered his services to the nation by designing a reconstruction of the Palace of the Grand Dukes - with an Art Deco touch, of course.\n\nThough the Palace is a famous relic of Lithuanian history, the Kingdom's resources are far from infinite, thus a debate has broken out between the King and his government on its study, size and feasibility."
 LIT.50.a: "Let's see what the Prime Minister has to say..."

 LIT.51.t: ""No.""
 LIT.51.d: "The answer probably should have been obvious from the get-go. King Vytautas II may be a monarch of the Lithuanian people, but he does not have the right to waste their tax money on a massive vanity project which might not even be feasible with modern technology. That was not going to dissuade the King, however, and a close associate of his, as well as the Lithuanian ambassador to Sweden, Ignas Šeinius, proposed an alternate approach.\n\n'None in Lithuania can deny that monuments are a source of national pride and identity, with many of them needing to be built or renovated, and is it not the duty of the monarch to be a patron of the arts, crafts, and culture? It will just so happen that for the projects he gives patronage to, the king will have a hand in designing and providing advice to'. Vytautas II was ecstatic, and ordered the patronage of the Palace of the Grand Dukes right away."

 LIT.52.d: "The project for the new Palace of the Grand Dukes has been designed and the groundwork has been completed. It will still take a long time for the Palace to be completed, however, and the King has left himself a possibility to add or remove more features - in a private conversation with the Prime Minister, he's assured that the project has sparked his enthusiasm and all sorts of creative ideas are flowing through his mind every passing day.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether the Lithuanian people will be endeared at hosting one of the most illustrious palaces in the modern era, or annoyed at their tax money being blown on such an expensive project."
 LIT.52.a: "I heard it even has a movie theatre!"

 LIT.53.t: "A Royal Tutelage"
 LIT.53.d: "It appears that the King's new tutor has been selected, the young Salomėja Nėris. She has grown renowned for her studies of Lithuanian folk tales and their translation into German. This has allowed Lithuanian folklore to be disseminated throughout the German-speaking world. Salomėja seen as a perfect fit for the King and his peculiar habits, others are hoping having the King be seen with a female company will help dispel any rumours of the unmarried prince's interests. The only concern regarding Salomėja is her rumoured affiliations with the Aušrininkai, a semi-formal syndicalist student movement..."
 LIT.53.a: "Surely that has been checked..."

 LIT.54.t: "Tutelage is Paying Off"
 LIT.54.d: "As part of the King's lessons with Salomėja, the King has been exposed to the history of Lithuania. Most recently, the King was moved by his recent lesson regarding the Polish-Lithuanian uprising that occurred in late 1830 dubbed the 'November Uprising'. It appears the King has become fascinated by the young Polish-Lithuanian Countess Emilia Plater, once he learned she has been dubbed the 'Lithuanian Joan of Arc', and how she led her people of different creeds and cultures against the Tsarist oppression, though to only die of a broken heart.\n\nUpon learning that Emilia was buried in the small town of Kapčiamiestis, the King set about drafting his project, a monument to the Lithuanian Joan of Arc. Though he must tread lightly as the effects of Black Monday are still ravaging the land and people want chickens in their pots and not monuments..."

 LIT.55.t: "Kapčiamiestis, the First Surprise of Many"
 LIT.55.d: "With the monument completed, the King has drawn his inspiration from the Polish artist Jan Rosen in his depiction of the young Countess. The monument has a young Emilia Plater wearing a military uniform of the era and holding a banner upon a horse. The pose of the young maiden appears to be one motivating an invisible army onwards in the heat of battle. A small plaque is at the base of the monument, and transcribed in Lithuanian, Polish and German.\n\nThe King gave a speech at the opening ceremony, though it was mainly in German with several interpreters in the crowd assisting in conveying the King's message. After the ceremony was completed a small contingent of Litvaks led by a Rabbi approached the King and his entourage. The Rabbi speaking fluent German requested if any funds could be spared to complete the repairs for the local synagogue. The King found himself enjoying a rare moment where was taken aback twice within a few seconds, as he was curious how the Rabbi knew the project went under budget, and by the fluency of his German. One of the King's entourage went to speak to the Rabbi, with the King agreeing to give a small donation to the Rabbi for his synagogue, and then asked the Rabbi where he learned to speak German so well."

 LIT.57.t: "Lithuania Weathered the Storm"
 LIT.57.d: "With Lithuania beginning to recover from the storm and tempest that was Black Monday, so has the people's trust in their King improved. Thanks to his very visible participation in many relief construction programmes and other policies to help the commoners, Vytautas has won some loyalty, especially among the poor. It seems that the king has the intention to continue with these large-scale public works even after the worst is over, despite worries from his cabinet that his grandiose designs will prove too expensive for the recovering nation."
 LIT.57.a: "An Architect King... god, he better be no Augustus"

 LIT.56.t: "Further Lessons, Further Inspirations"
 LIT.56.d: "As the King continues to receive further lessons from Salomėja, his knowledge base in Lithuanian history has expanded ten-fold. From the battle of Grunwald, where a Polish-Lithuanian coalition brought the Teutonic Order to its knees, to the Lithuanian book smugglers, who risked their lives to smuggle in contraband books written in Lithuanian during the times of the Tsar. The King knows it would be foolish to express his interest in further projects, knowing that with Black Monday now hampering his Kingdom, he will have to wait till Lithuania weathers the storm.\n\nThese lessons seem to have rejuvenated the King in his efforts to prove himself to his subjects. Though some grow concerned that Salomėja and the King are getting a little 'too close', with the King and Salomėja's private lessons appearing to go on for longer and at odd hours, many see it as a blessing that the King is taking an active interest in the history of Lithuania and its people."

During the Weltkrieg, the Church survived mainly intact with little work required to restore it though people are confused about why the King selected this Church, as its brickwork was completed in 1907.\n\nIt appears the King has been captivated by the Church's neo-gothic design and that it was designed by a foreign architect, Karl Eduard Strandmann. As the King and his growing cohort of Architects were surveying the Church and where the memorial would be located, the King was surprised that a Prussian Lithuanian by the name of Vydūnas has petitioned that he and some other Prussian Lithuanians be included in this project. They state that the Knygnešiai are as much part of their culture as it is to Lithuanians. The King has been put into a difficult position as Vydūnas is a known supporter of Prussian Lithuanian nationalism and by accepting his inclusion in the project, he could risk angering the Kaiser for promoting regional nationalism, bringing with it a painful reminder of the Memel uprising and also cause the project to take longer due to their input. Though on the other hand alienating the Prussian Lithuanians would be viewed poorly by the Kingdom and further strain ties between Prussian Lithuanians and the Kingdom."
 LIT.58.a: "I must respect the Kaiser's will, tell Vydūnas thanks but no."
 LIT.58.b: "The Kaiser be damned, tell that odd fellow Vydūnas we will accept his help."

 LIT.59.t: "A Dismal Opening"
 LIT.59.d: "With the King opting to exclude Vydūnas and other Prussian Lithuanians from the project, word spread like wildfire throughout the Kingdom and Lithuania Minor of this action. It has been perceived by the general public that the King is nothing more than another foreign ruler who cares little for the people he rules over. As a result of this, the opening ceremony turnout was a mediocre affair, with only a few residents of Palanga and government officials attending the opening.\n\nMany have seen the design of the memorial as bland and simple, with no real inspiration taken in its design and it appearing to be less of an extension of the Church and more of an eyesore. With this, the King has left for Vilnius both perplexed and disappointed."
 LIT.59.a: "All this over a memorial..."

 LIT.60.t: "Holding Hands Across the Neman"
 LIT.60.d: "The project ran longer than expected due to Vydūnas and the other Prussian Lithuanians' inputs on the memorial. The King and Vydūnas came to a disagreement regarding Vydūnas insistence on including references to Lithuania's old pagan religion within the memorial. Eventually cooler heads prevailed as the 'Lietuviškasis kryžius', or Lithuanian Cross, was agreed upon to be included in the memorial. To the surprise of the King, Vydūnas stated that both German and Lithuanian within the memorial to highlight the link between the two cultures.\n\nThe opening of the memorial went off better than expected, with people from both sides of the Neman attending the ceremony. During Vydūnas' speech, he made mention that this memorial should be the first of many projects that Prussian Lithuanians and Lithuanians undertake together and the memorial also represents the two groups holding hands across the Neman in unity. This last part of Vydūnas' speech was controversial to say the less and has brought the ire from Berlin down on the King, who has been 'kindly' reminded by his council of his where his loyalties should lie."
 LIT.60.a: "Alright."

 LIT.61.t: "Restoring the Church of St. Joseph the Betrothed"
 LIT.61.d: "Upon his daily walks throughout the city of Vilnius, the King saw an old run-down Church. At first, he thought nothing of it, as unfortunately, Vilnius is an old city and with the effects of Black Monday affecting his citizens, a sight like this isn't out of place. It wasn't until he started enquiring about the building that he learned of its history.\n\nThe church once named St. Joseph the Betrothed, was quite quaint and at some point was used as a monastery by an order of Carmelite monks. It was first established in 1638 by the then Vice-Chancellor of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, Stefan Pac. The church survived many of the disasters and occupations that betide Vilnius, though it appears it couldn't survive the ruling of the Russian Tsars with an order for it to be demolished in 1877. Since then it appears a market of sorts was meant to be installed, though it appears the Weltkrieg and then the German occupation of the city put an end to that. With this in mind, the King saw this as a new challenge and immediately began his work on restoring the old church."
 LIT.61.a: "He is doing what now?!"

 LIT.62.t: "The Petition"
 LIT.62.d: "Though many are elated that the King is restoring the old church, many are concerned with the direction he may take with it. The Church itself features your usual features in a Catholic church, though with a Lithuanian influence, with its use of an unquiet Lithuanian cross design. A petition has been forwarded to the King to ensure he keeps this design and not 'add upon' it.\n\nThe King did wish to add a 'Bavarian' flair to the Church and do away with these near pagan crosses on the church as such a thing wouldn't occur in Germany. Torn between what the people expect and what designs he has already laid out, the King must decide on the design."
 LIT.62.a: "The Church is for the people, not for me!"
 LIT.62.b: "They will like what I tell them to like!"

 LIT.63.t: "A Mixed Reception"
 LIT.63.d: "Following the recommendations highlighted in the city's petition the turnout for its grand opening has been far from great. It appears the petition only represented the Lithuanian community within Vilnius, which has slowly begun to grow since 1918 but is still the smallest minority in the city. Poles, Belarusians and other communities appeared to show little interest in the event, though a Bundas representative was present to the surprise of many. The design of the church itself completely restored the church to its original humble form, though with modern comforts added like power and plumbing. A small plaque was placed at the front of the Church with its brief history explained as a reminder to rule under the Russian Tsar."
 LIT.63.a: "The complexity of Vilnius is mind-boggling."

 LIT.64.t: "A Begrudging Acceptance"
 LIT.64.d: "Ignoring the petition that was sent to him, the King continued with his own vision of the Church. After more consultation with Salomėja, he decided to keep one Lithuanian cross on the nave's roof, with the other two taking a more traditional approach. On the day of its opening, it appears the crowd of mixed cultures and creeds had mixed feelings about its new design. It didn't favour any one culture within the city and for all intents and purposes was just a Church. Further to this, a Bundas representative was present to the surprise of many and seemed to approve. The King was to find out later that the petition only represented the Lithuanian minority in the city and following its recommendations would be clear favouritism, regardless of his nativity."
 LIT.64.a: "Vilnius seems to be more complex than I thought."

 LIT.65.t: "To My Dearest Father"
 LIT.65.d: "Born Wilhelm Karl Florestan Gero Crescentius, the King's late father was crowned the second King of the newly created Kingdom of Lithuania, which drew its legitimacy from the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Wilhelm's regal name, Mindaugas II, was chosen after the first and only King of Lithuania, though, unlike his Lithuanian predecessor, did not earn his crown via conquest and court intrigue, but by a vote.\n\nMany expected the newly crowned King to be at best another German King who didn't care about the goings-on of his Kingdom and at worst, a monarch similar to the Polish Commonwealth Kings of old. What they got to their surprise was a King, who was firm in the belief that a monarch is there to serve his people. and one that learned the language and traditions of his land. Though he was still a puppet King, he ensured that Berlin's interference in Lithuania was minimal, with one act being his support for Vilnius being declared as a 'Development City', in an attempt to curb the German dominance on his Kingdom.\n\nThe few vices of the late King was his unwavering views on tradition and royal protocols. This was famously proven when Mindaugas refused to accept his son's engagement to a woman beneath his status, resulting in Wilhelm abdicating the throne, and Karl Gero being trusted as the heir apparent to a Kingdom he knew little of. Unlike his brother, Karl had no wish to guide a nation, but wished to design buildings having finished his studies as an architect. After being wounded heavily in the Weltkrieg and now reinvigorated to show his subjects, the King sets about designing a memorial to his late father, with the city of Valkaviskas selected as he seemed to always enjoy its humble streets and its charming people."
 LIT.65.a: "I think it reminded him of 1830s Bavaria..."

 LIT.66.t: "A Consideration"
 LIT.66.d: "The memorial design and construction are currently proceeding without a hitch. The locals seemed to marvel at the spectacle that has come to their city, with people from all over the Kingdom moving to the city to work on the project and others attempting to benefit from the attention it has been getting. Though the sudden influx of people is beginning to strain the city's infrastructure due to its lack of sanitation and electrical infrastructure, which could hamper the completion time of the memorial.\n\nIn an audience with the Mayor of Valkaviskas, he has requested of the King further funding to accommodate this sudden boom of population. Though the benefits of this funding would result in the expansion of Valkaviskas and the steady growth of jobs, it would have the King going over several heads of Government, which goes against the supposed 'natural order' of things and could cause a stir with the [From.GetRulingParty] and the current head of state, opposed to the King requesting such funding be made available, which is a drawn-out process."
 LIT.66.a: "I shall support my people in their time of need"
 LIT.66.b: "Let me see what I can do"

 LIT.67.t: "Groundwork Laid"
 LIT.67.d: "With extra funding secured for the city of Valkaviskas via the King directly, the Mayor has been able to commerce with the much-needed expansion of its core infrastructure. This has drawn more people to the city from the countryside due to the growing need for unskilled labour being required in the city.\n\nA large crowd of people flocked to the unveiling ceremony of the King's memorial to his late father. In a further sign of respect to the city, the plaque commissioned to the memorial was also written in Belarusian, German and Lithuanian alike, to allow a majority of the local population to understand its meaning. During the ceremony itself, the rural population believed the memorial and the ceremony to be the commemoration of a saint and began to kneel in prayer to the bemusement of those around them. It wasn't till a local interrupter and several local priests informed them that it wasn't for a Saint but for the King's late father. The Mayor in his speech stated the memorial represented two things, the great deeds done by the Old King and secondly the rebirth of the city by deeds of the new one. Further to this, he stated that the people of Valkaviskas shouldn't look to Minsk as their ancestral capital but to Vilnius as 'Litvins', not Belarusians. The last comment was met with several murmurs in the crowd till the labourers of the city began cheering in unison drowning out those concerned by the mayor's 'Litvin' remarks.\n\nAfter the ceremony, it appears the memorial was given a tongue-in-cheek nickname due to the actions taken by the rural population, with it known as 'Sviaty Uil'yam', Saint Wilhelm, with the King also finding the mirth in the comment.."
 LIT.67.a: "Litvin or Litvak...are we not all Lithuanians?"

 LIT.68.t: "Groundwork Laid"
 LIT.68.d: "With extra funding secured for the city of Valkaviskas via the government, the Mayor has been able to finally commerce with the much-needed expansion of its core infrastructure. This had to begin to draw people from the countryside to Valkaviskas, though it's a sluggish affair to say the less.\n\nA large crowd of people flocked to the unveiling ceremony of the King's memorial to his late father. In a further sign of respect to the city, the plaque commissioned for the memorial was also written in Belarusian (along with German and Lithuanian) to allow a majority of the local population to understand its meaning. The Mayor in his speech stated the memorial represented two things, the great deeds done by the Old King and secondly the rebirth of the city by deeds of the new one. He went on to state if the King's actions continue to live up to those of his father, then the people of Valkaviskas could stop looking to Minsk as their ancestral capital and start looking to Vilnius. The last comment was met with several murmurs in the crowd till the labourers of the city began cheering in unison drowning out those concerned by the Mayor's 'Minsk' remarks.\n\nAfter the ceremony, it appears the King was given a tongue-in-cheek nickname due to his actions regarding securing funding for the city, 'Vitovt niabožčyk'."
 LIT.68.a: "Vytautas the Late... cheeky devils"

 LIT.69.t: "Valkaviskas Infrastructure Completed"
 LIT.69.d: "After several months, the funded infrastructure project has allowed for the city to expand and modernise by a large degree. The Mayor of Valkaviskas announced that the core constructions were complete, though there is always room to expand. This has begun to attract more investment into the city and has begun to attract more people from the countryside to the city seeking work.\n\nNew schools have begun to open allowing the largely illiterate rural population of the Valkaviskas state to be educated with the language of instruction being Belarusian and Lithuanian. This has allowed for the concept of the 'Litvin' identity to take further root in the city, with the younger population looking to Vilnius not Minsk as their cultural home."
 LIT.69.a: "Let's hope for more cultural harmony in the Kingdom"

 LIT.70.t: "The King's 'Model' Town"
 LIT.70.d: "After the events of Valkaviskas, the King has taken it upon himself to begin designing more than buildings, but the foundation of a town itself. He has drawn great architects like Albert Carl Moritz and Jonas Virakas to help him draft what he is calling 'The King's Model Town'. It seems he has taken a liking to Valkaviskas, stating it reminds him of Bavaria, though many don't see how the two are even remotely the same."
 LIT.70.a: "He wants to do what?"

 LIT.71.t: "Design Concept"
 LIT.71.d: "After several design concepts, and mock-ups, it appears the final two designs have boiled down to either a town that blends Lithuanian, German and Polish in the design of its buildings or essentially is a little slice of Bavaria. Both Carl Moritz and Virakas favour the former option as they state the latter would merely be a vanity project. The King decides on..."
 LIT.71.a: "A simple design of Lithuanian, German, and Polish would suffice."
 LIT.71.b: "Vanity... pfft. I'll bring Bavaria here..."

 LIT.72.t: "A Polish-Lithuanian Design"
 LIT.72.d: "The King has decided on a design based on a blend of Polish and Lithuanian concepts. Persuaded by the arguments by Carl Moritz and Virakas that doing so is the better choice and better suited to represent his legitimacy as King of Lithuania - the King has agreed that the town should indeed feature a blend of Polish and Lithuanian designs. The town's construction thus begins with high anticipation from speculators and investors."
 LIT.72.a: "Wonderful! A town for the Lithuanian people!"

 LIT.73.t: "A Slice of Bavaria"
 LIT.73.d: "'Bavaria is a beautiful place, and now the artwork, architecture, and most importantly, food of Bavaria is here in Lithuania. This a little slice of German Heaven', exclaimed the King at a meeting with his advisors Moritz and Virakas. Against the advice of his designers and builders, the King has decided on a Bavarian design. While he is most definitely happy with his choice, there are already bitter rumours and murmurs that the project is merely a reflection of the King's arrogance and not his genuine passion and love for the Lithuanian people."
 LIT.73.a: "I still don't get Bavaria..."

 LIT.74.t: "A Memorial to Władysław Syrokomla"
 LIT.74.d: "Born Ludwik Władysław Franciszek Kondratowicz in the village of Smolków, Władysław Syrokomla was one of the great romantic poets of the 19th century. Despite his short life, Syrokomla's poems (written mainly in Polish) resonate deeply among Lithuanians as an example of multi-cultural Polish-Lithuanian identity.\n\nComing from an impoverished noble family, Syrokomla suffered tragedy after tragedy in his early life. He had to abandon his studies early due to financial problems, and three of his four children passed away in the same year. In 1844, he published the first of his poems, 'Pocztylion', under the pen name 'Władysław Syrokomla', a name he took from his family's coat of arms. Eventually, he rose to become the editor of the Kurier Wilenski, the largest and most prestigious Polish language in the Vilnius area. However, after taking part in an anti-tsarist demonstration in 1861, he was arrested by the Russian Okhrana and sentenced to house arrest - dying a year later, virtually penniless.\n\nHeavily influenced by fellow Polish poet Adam Mickiewicz, Syrokomla's poems dealt with the liberation of peasants and the dream of a free Polish-Lithuania. While he wrote in Polish, he acknowledged himself as Lithuanian as his birthplace was located in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. He also wrote several poems in Belarusian due to his fascination with the society and culture of 19th-century Belarus. An icon among the Lithuanian literary world, Syrokomla's works illustrate Poles, Lithuanians, and Belarusians."
 LIT.74.a: "He was truly a worthy man"

 LIT.75.t: "Completion of the Memorial"
 LIT.75.d: "After days of tiring construction, Władysław Syrokomla's memorial is finally complete. Built in Vilnius, this humble statue serves as a reminder of how important art is in Lithuania and the shared cultural union between Poles and Lithuanians. As curious onlookers, young and old, begin viewing the statue with fascination, they are drawn to a curious inscription on the bottom:\n\n'Ludwik Kondratowicz Władysław Syrokomla 1823-1862. The little bird will ask God to lend a hand, to help the poor man bear his bitter lot. To have the strength to carry his cross. To make it to the grave without complaint.'\n\nThe words on the state are indeed a solemn memento mori. Syrokomla died young, struggling with his lack of education and his deep poverty. Yet the poet's deep lyrics resonate to an audience more than seventy years later... a testament to his accomplishments."
 LIT.75.a: "He was a blessing to us all"
 #Please help me find some of his poems I want to replace this with the opening to one - Eberronguy

 LIT.76.t: "Bare Necessities Installed"
 LIT.76.d: "News from the Palace of the Grand Dukes' construction site have arrived - the minimal necessities, such as plumbing, electricity and central heating, have been installed in the carcass and the Palace is now technically liveable, though it is far from complete. Convinced in the sturdiness of his work, King Vytautas II has chosen to spend a night in the Palace by himself, and has returned somewhat pleased, though also with more and more ideas on which parts of the Palace can be improved, what needs to be changed and where to divert resources, forcing out frustrated sighs from the construction workers."
 LIT.76.a: "On the toilet, king and beggar are equal."

 LIT.77.t: "Ballroom Built"
 LIT.77.d: "News from the Palace of the Grand Dukes' construction site has arrived - the ballroom, the crown jewel of the Palace, has been completed according to King Vytautas II's specifications. The ballroom draws inspiration from Baltic manors such as the Verkiai Palace, and German palaces alike. Though there is also a noticeable modern touch to its design and is applauded for its beauty. It has also been made usable for other matters of state - to prove this, he has ordered a meeting of his cabinet in the newly completed ballroom, where the Prime Minister and other high-ranking officials informed him on the ongoing matters of state. However, they left with complaints that the ongoing construction outside was very distracting."
 LIT.77.a: "But look at the chandelier!"

 LIT.78.t: "Living Quarters Built"
 LIT.78.d: "News from the Palace of the Grand Dukes' construction site has arrived - the living quarters and most of the rooms of the Palace have been successfully completed. The decor of the palace is fitting for a monarch, and has been praised by other architects and interior designers inspecting the Palace. While reviewing the royal bedroom, King Vytautas II received a candid remark from Antanas Smetona - why did he choose to construct himself a bed for two people if he has yet to get married? The King did not respond to the inquiry, but witnesses say that he stormed off after becoming flustered by the remark."
 LIT.78.a: "Shut up, I'm still waiting for the one!"

 LIT.79.t: "Cathedral Upgraded"
 LIT.79.d: "News from the Palace of the Grand Dukes' construction site has arrived - the Vilnius Cathedral has successfully been integrated into the Palace complex and refurbished. The walls and rooftop of the Cathedral have been renovated and additional towers have been constructed to go with the main building. Upon the completion of the upgrade, a celebratory Mass was held in the Cathedral where the devout of the capital were called to pray for the longevity of House Urach and the restored Kingdom of Lithuania, for centuries to come. Complaints have started to pop up, however, that the Palace and the new towers of the Cathedral are obscuring the view of the iconic Tower of Gediminas, the last remaining tower of the Vilnius Upper Castle. When informed about this, King Vytautas II did not respond, instead descending to deep thought. Perhaps, once the Palace is completed, he can put his skills to use in restoring the Upper Castle?.."
 LIT.79.a: "Gelbėk mus nuo karaliaus, Viešpatie."

 LIT.80.t: "The Architect King"
 LIT.80.d: "With glorious fanfare and surpassing his critics, the King's project has indeed been a success. The palace built in the gothic style during the 15th century has been rebuilt to the point where curious onlookers are certainly impressed with the quality of the project and the speed of the construction. Featuring an assortment of German, Baltic, Renaissance, and modern tastes - the project's success has proven the King's critics wrong and does show his prowess in architectural design. In addition, the integration of the Vilnius Cathedral has further solidified the King's legitimacy in the eyes of the people. Nonetheless, some have questioned whether or not the King truly intended the project to be for him or the Lithuanian peoples - the palace has been accordingly renamed as Palace of the King, moving away from the Grand Duchy of Lithuania's past."
 LIT.80.a: "The King has seen his project go through!"

 LIT.100.t: "The Optimal System"
 LIT.100.d: "The political views of Stasys Šalkauskis stem from his Christian upbringing and his experience of both 'Western' and 'Eastern' culture. Having studied in Moscow and Friburg alike, he came to view Lithuania as a fusion of 'rational' Western culture and 'emotional' Eastern culture, believing both of these rudiments to be equally important and Lithuania as something unique in world history. It is a bridge between East and West, a nation which is able to manifest the best features of them both, if only its cultural and political system is reformed to optimally draw out these rudiments and create a truly pluralistic, democratic state.\n\nŠalkauskis has been a maverick in Lithuanian politics for as long as he has participated in them. Though a believer in social justice and a harsh opponent of free market capitalism, he denounced socialism as demagogic and atomistic, and based his beliefs on Christian compassion and solidarity rather than revolutionary thought. He believed his fellow Christian Democrats to be 'inquisitors', rather than politicians, too. In his eyes, Christian democracy should carefully weigh the balance between individualism and socialism (which he saw as a reaction to individualism, i.e. capitalism) and draw out the benefits of them both - and the way to do so is through federal corporatism.\n\nLike many Christian politicians, Šalkauskis believed in economic corporatism. The entire country needs to be organised into economic, cultural, political and spiritual corporations - and these corporations unite into even greater units, federations. These federations would work autonomously, resolving social issues amongst themselves without the need for extensive government involvement. Politically, these federations would manifest as autonomous Lithuanian, Belarusian, Polish and Jewish entities within a united Kingdom; economically - as federations of trade unions and chambers of commerce; spiritually and culturally - as a universal belief in Christian ethics and compassion, serving as the strings which knit the society together. It should be noted that Šalkauskis did not believe in the imposition of Christianity over Lithuania's non-Christian subjects, such as Jews - in his eyes, Christian ethics, such as those professed in the Decalogue, are universal amongst all humans, even if they carry different names in different religions."
 LIT.100.a: "Atkurti viską Kristuje!"

 LIT.101.t: "Outlining Federal Borders"
 LIT.101.d: "The first act of the Šalkauskis government to lay down the foundations for an Optimal System is to outline the borders of all the federal units which shall compose the Kingdom. The Prime Minister's wish is to outline it according to cultural lines - however, the mere mention of determining the ethnic composition of Lithuania brings up several competing viewpoints. Some overblow the Lithuanian population, some Polish, some Belarusian, and the reason is that previous censuses in Lithuanian territory were inaccurate, prone to nationalist fact-twisting and uncertainties regarding certain nationalities. A new census is thus planned to take place and settle all debates once and for all.\n\nThe Lithuanian census of [GetYear] can be organised swiftly, allowing the government to quickly move on with the issue and start on other projects in the Optimal System plan, or we can take our time to make sure the data is as accurate as it can possibly be."
 LIT.101.a: "Slow and steady wins the race."
 LIT.101.b: "Speed is key!"

 LIT.102.t: "Census Complete"
 LIT.102.d: "The all-Lithuanian census is complete and has gone without a hitch. There have been no accusations of bias or result twisting, all the inhabitants of the country have been successfully tabled and new borders of ethnic groups in Lithuania drawn. The Optimal System project can now continue unabated."
 LIT.102.a: "Things are moving swimmingly!"

 LIT.103.t: "Census Complete"
 LIT.103.d: "The all-Lithuanian census is complete, but ran into some significant problems. There have been accusations of bias by the census committee, some of the results were left out entirely and some people were not reached by the census officials. Regardless, the results have been tabled and new borders of ethnic groups in Lithuania drawn, even if they may not satisfy everyone..."
 LIT.103.a: "Things are not moving so swimmingly..."

 LIT.104.t: "State Support for Trade Unions"
 LIT.104.d: "The Bundas and its left-leaning tint have always been a thorn at the side of the Christian Democratic party - even before it took a turn towards politics and instead declared neutrality, it was unofficially aligned with the LSDP due to the simple fact of holding the same ideological niche. Prime Minister Šalkauskis is more passive towards the organisation than his predecessors, seeing it as an example of what an economic corporation envisioned in his works would look like - however, his opposition towards socialism, which Bundas espouses, and dissatisfaction with the Jewish corporation outcompeting other ethnic groups have led to him approving a plan to curtail its influence.\n\nUnder orders of the Christian Democratic government, several state-sponsored trade union federations have been founded, most notably the Lithuanian Christian Labour Federation (Lietuvos krikščioniškoji darbo federacija) and the Central Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Handwork (Centriniai prekybos, pramonės ir amatų rūmai), uniting Lithuanian labourers and business owners respectively. Unifying a significant portion of Lithuanian industry under several corporations and significantly sponsoring them has eroded the power of the Bundas, allowing Lithuanian businesses to retake some of the market share in Vilnius and other notable towns."
 LIT.104.a: "Great to hear!"

 LIT.105.t: "Language of Instruction"
 LIT.105.d: "One thing not initially considered while embarking on the Optimal System project is the education system. Right now, the standard curriculum has Lithuanian and German as mandatory languages and various options depending on location, such as Russian, Polish, Belarusian, and Yiddish, or foreign languages like French and English. Though this is different in minority schools, this standard curriculum remains from Palanga to Białystok. The drive towards federalism forces us to reconsider our approach to language education.\n\nPrime Minister Šalkauskis's dream would be to have each student in the country, Lithuanian, Slavic or other, learn Lithuanian and one Slavic language of choice, to allow interconnection between the Kingdom's population - but German authorities continue to enforce mandatory German language education for all students, and loading them with three mandatory languages to learn would be horrifying. So, a compromise will have to be found."
 LIT.105.a: "Lithuanian and a Slavic language would be best."
 LIT.105.b: "German is more useful in the greater world."
 LIT.105.c: "Allow each cultural corporation to choose for themselves."

 LIT.106.t: "Anti-Federalist Activism"
 LIT.106.d: "Far from everyone in the Kingdom of Lithuania is supportive of Prime Minister Šalkauskis's ideas - in fact, plenty are willing to go as far as to declare this an act of treason. The Prime Minister's calls for cultural autonomy, reconciliation with the Poles and Belarusians, and a deep belief in social justice have led many right-wing Lithuanian nationalists to denounce him as a closet Syndicalist, a traitor to the Lithuanian people, and a sell-out to the Slavs. This activism is further radicalised by the poor conditions caused by Black Monday and ethnic polarisation in Lithuanian cities stemming from the Bundas' takeover of industry there. It manifests itself in the form of mass protests, vandalism, or even outright assaults against political opponents. Several skirmishes between armed nationalists and police forces have been registered across the country, resulting in dozens wounded and the country shackled by terror.\n\nIt is believed that this violent activism is the work of the Lithuanian Activist Front (LAF), an underground organisation of Lithuanian nationalists seeking to free Lithuania from any and all foreign influence."
 LIT.106.a: "They will fall!"

 LIT.107.t: "An Ally in Need"
 LIT.107.d: "Faced with a real threat of an Activist Front takeover of the country, the Jewish Labour Bund has opted to act pragmatically and fully endorse the Optimal System Project. Despite the ideological differences between the Christian Democrats and the Bundas, it is far, far more palatable than the outright antisemitism of the LAF, and the pluralistic, federal tendencies of the Optimal System give assurances that the Jewish community will be safe should democracy remain. Shlomo Kleit, the leader of the Labour Bund, has come out with his full endorsement for the incumbent government and called for all left-wingers in the country to stand behind Prime Minister Šalkauskis and his cabinet."
 LIT.107.a: "...is an ally indeed."

 LIT.108.t: "Šalkauskis and Kleit - Man to Man"
 LIT.108.d: "Both Šalkauskis and Kleit with their cohort met in what appeared to be a recently refurbished hall within Vilnius. Kleit appeared uneasy by this sudden meeting called between the newly elected Prime Minister. This mood was quickly replaced with a sense of ease, with Šalkauskis firstly thanking Kleit and his Bundas for their support during the turbulent days of Black Monday, and adding that this level of charity will not be forgotten amongst the Lithuanian people. Šalkauskis continued, that though his Christian beliefs, political views, and way of life may clash with Kleit and the Bundas, they have the same end goal, being the betterment of their fellow man. For this, Šalkauskis and his government are willing to overlook certain aspects of the Bundas. Of course, Kleit knew there would be a 'but', with Šalkauskis expressing the need for the more radical members of the organisation to be reeled in. Upon completion of his sentence, Kleit's cohort began conversing amongst themselves in a mixture of Polish and Yiddish. An argument had broken out between certain members, complete with coarse curses being exchanged, but was then silenced by Kleit slamming his fist on the table, and in Lithuanian, telling two of his cohort to leave. After an awkward silence, these men excused themselves from the meeting and left the room. Kleit excused this outburst, with Šalkauskis and Kleit hammering out the finer points of this compromise."
 LIT.108.a: "Appears the Bundas isn't as united as we thought..."

 LIT.109.t: "Kościałkowski's Speech"
 LIT.109.d: "One of the leaders of the right wing of the Central Polish Electoral Committee, Marian Zyndram-Kościałkowski, has recently held a speech in Białystok, during which he gave an unprecedented and scathing criticism of our policies. He has declared that Prime Minister Šalkauskis's policies and ideology are thinly veiled nationalism, seeking to turn all the ethnic groups in Lithuania into subordinates of a greater 'Lithuanian' culture, which he is clearly a supremacist of, declaring it to be a unique specimen in world history. He called for his fellow Poles to resist the Šalkauskis government and its efforts for reform. This speech has been broadcasted through radio across much of the Białystok Region, and it seems that many of those listening to him express support for his atomising ideas.\n\nPerhaps it should be no surprise, given that Kościałkowski is a notable Polish irredentist and has gotten into trouble with the authorities over his anti-Lithuanian remarks before, but it should also be noted that our census has sparked Polish resentment which Kościałkowski simply used to his advantage..."

 LIT.110.t: "Support Gained for Optimal System"
 LIT.110.d: "Despite the reluctance of conservatives and traditionalists who doubted the resilience and strength of the Optimal System, it seems that more Lithuanian citizens are gradually accepting it. While many agree that the LAF's anti-German stance is admirable given the distaste for Germany's presence in Eastern Europe - their violent methods and outright belligerent rhetoric has also scared many. It has been reported that with each day, the progress of the Optimal System seems fruitful as more and more Lithuanians are identifying as Lithuanian despite their numerous ethnic backgrounds. With the end goal of Lithuania being a nation that expresses both western democratic values and eastern tradition, proponents of the Optimal System have argued that the system will only lead Lithuania forwards. Together all Lithuanians will be represented, a far cry from the hateful rhetoric espoused by those in the LAF."
 LIT.110.a: "Lithuania, our dear homeland!"

 LIT.120.t: "The King Wishes to Address the Nation"
 LIT.120.d: "One of the largest dilemmas of Stasys Šalkauskis's Optimal System project is the question of the monarchy, and what place will it hold in the system. Šalkauskis's sketches place the King in a position separate from all three branches of government, as an apolitical mediator who is the supreme expression of executive government. The philosopher vehemently denies this as an attempt to grant the monarchy stronger executive powers, however, citing that his belief is that the monarch must be an apolitical unifying figure first and foremost. Needless to say, this question in the project has yet to be resolved, and this has led to people like Antanas Maceina interpreting the idea as necessitating vast executive powers, even undemocratic ones.\n\nKing Vytautas II and the cabinet of ministers have been discussing this dilemma, however, and as the Optimal System project is coming to a close, he is willing to present the results of their compromise in a speech to the nation."
 LIT.120.e: "The monarchy is indeed a heated matter of debate for the nationalists. Led by Antanas Smetona, the nationalists desire a Lithuanian state for themselves - Lithuania for Lithuanians! Their primary goal is to establish the Lithuanian 'unitary state' - a fully centralised Lithuania. Nonetheless, despite their nationalistic rhetoric and hatred for German monarchs, Smetona's Lithuanian Nationalist Union has agreed to change its stance on the monarchy. In a move unforeseen by observers and the press, the king has decided to meet with the Smetona regarding the future of Lithuania's leadership. There are heated tensions on both sides, especially since Smetona will undoubtedly demand power for himself and his party, and few expect an actual compromise to be made. Smetona's popularity has eclipsed that of the king, and if a settlement is to be made, it would involve the king relegating his duties.\nNevertheless, the King has arranged a proclamation to the people of Lithuania, which will no doubt more clearly delineate his anticipated future role."
 LIT.120.f: "Led by the charismatic Steponas Kairys, the Social Democratic Party of Lithuania (LSDP) has seen a surge in popularity in recent years. In response to Lithuania's seemingly never-ending problems with ethnicity, the LSDP has argued for their idea of 'National Personal Autonomy.' Staunch republicans, indeed, the LSDP is not a fan of the monarchy. However, they have changed their party stance to allow Lithuania to become a constitutional monarchy. Under the limitations granted to him, the King will agree to be reduced to a figurehead for all Lithuanians, quelling ethnic unrest in these turbulent times. Part of his role was giving periodic addresses to the nation, something which he felt was necessary for the coming days."
 LIT.120.a: "Oh god, he's not going to speak in Lithuanian, is he?"

 LIT.121.t: "The King's Proclamation"
 LIT.121.d.salkauskis: "The King's proclamation was seen by thousands of Vilnius citizens live in the Verkiai Palace, and many more heard the speech broadcasted through radio. In it, Vytautas II announced that he will grant more prerogative to the State Commission, imagined in Šalkauskis's Optimal System project as a tool of judicial and executive control of the government, as well as the Cabinet of Ministers. The monarchy will be reduced to an honourable figurehead role, a rallying point for all Lithuanians, no matter their ethnicity or religion. Though the King is still the head of state for all legal purposes, Stasys Šalkauskis' responsibilities - and power - have expanded to that near the level of the king himself."
 LIT.121.d.smetona: "The King's speech was seen by thousands of Vilnius citizens live in the Verkiai Palace, and many more heard the speech broadcasted through radio. In it, Vytautas II announced that he will be reducing his official role and duties within Lithuania and empowering them to a Regent. Unsurprisingly, this title was given to Smetona - although it appears that Stanisław Narutowicz has been given the role of Prime Minister within Lithuania, putting him a step below the new Regent. This has caught many on the back foot, with members of the Smetona's party protesting the decision to put a 'Pole' into this position. Many believe this is another power move to ensure the loyalty of Balstogė and the Poles within the Kingdom, with a common enemy in the East rearing its head towards Lithuania.\n\nSmetona's first announcement as Regent was to rebrand the title as 'Tautos Vadas', Leader of the Nation, which he states is a more 'Lithuanian' title. Though the King is still the head of state for all legal purposes, Smetona's responsibilities - and power - has expanded to that near the level of the king himself."
 LIT.121.d.kairys: "The King's speech was seen by thousands of Vilnius citizens live in the Verkiai Palace, and many more heard the speech broadcasted through radio. In it, Vytautas II announced that he supports Kairys' initiatives to reduce the autonomy of his court. He continued to state he wishes to see his role more of that of an honourable figurehead, a rallying point for all Lithuanians, no matter their ethnicity or religion. Though the more radical members of the LSDP wish to see the King completely removed from office, it seems Kairys' gambit is paying off, with him assuming responsibilities - and power - near the level of the King himself."
 LIT.121.a: "Šalkauskis, the philosophical leader Lithuania needs in these troubling times."
 LIT.121.b: "An... interesting move from the King."
 LIT.121.c: "Kairys will lead Lithuania into a golden age."

 LIT.122.t: "Lithuania Decouples from us"
 LIT.122.d: "Our embassy in Vilnius has worrying news that the Lithuanian nation is headed towards greater autonomy. Our shattered economy found it harder to manage and aid the countries of Eastern Europe. It turns out that the Lithuanian economic reforms have drawn them farther away from the Reichspakt than closer. While they are still under our protection and our financial control, Lithuania experiences a greater degree of freedom. While this may not be a significant cause of concern for us as they are still under our control, perhaps it is a sign that we must strengthen our eastern borders."
 LIT.122.a: "Those Balts have been nothing but trouble"

 LIT.123.t: "Lithuania decouples from Germany"
 LIT.123.d: "Through taxing economic and political reforms after the Black Monday disaster, the state of Lithuania has achieved a degree of economic and political autonomy. While this is far from actual independence, for the first time in its history under the Reichspakt, the Lithuanian nation can honestly declare itself an autonomous government. If this is indeed true or not remains subject to debate. Lithuania will still be reliant on the German country for economic ties and will no doubt contribute to the defence of the Reichspakt in some way - yet this is perhaps a sign of the waning strength of the German Empire in the East."
 LIT.123.a: "Sėkmė!"

 LIT.150.t: "Political Arrests"
 LIT.150.d: "No matter how democratic or liberal a state may be, it can still have enemies which need to be purged - these words flying from Smetona's mouth have punctuated a series of raids and arrests against his numerous political opponents. Under the guise of eliminating Syndicalist subversion and preventing illegal separatism in the South, over 500 people have been detained during the following month. The most notable arrests come from the radical wing of the Social Democratic Party, including Justas Paleckis and Vincas Galinis, as well as one of the suspected leaders of the underground Aušrinė movement, Rapolas Čarnas. In the Polish majority Białystok region, this fate descended upon Marian Zyndram-Kościałkowski, a notable Polish activist, member of the Committee of Poles in Lithuania, and a proponent of Polish irredentism in the region. The news of this violent transgression of democracy has sparked protests and dealt a blow to the government's approval ratings, but the Prime Minister declared that he shall weather the storm."
 LIT.150.a: "Send in the boys in blue."

 LIT.151.t: "LTS Land Reforms"
 LIT.151.d: "To Antanas Smetona, Lithuania and its national identity have always and will always be connected to agriculture. Having come from an agricultural background himself and witnessed the cities of Kaunas and Vilnius in his youth, which he believed to be a completely alien, 'un-Lithuanian' world, he grew to view urbanisation and industrialisation with suspicion. The first priority of the Nationalist Union in the economic department is to enact sweeping land reform, requisitioning unused land and setting maximum limits to the amount of land one person might own, and distributing government land to the landless and those who own very little land. Unlike the land reform plans proposed by the Social Democrats, however, Smetona's 'national land reform' has a political bent as well. Priority to distributing government land goes to Lithuanian-speaking farmers, while non-Lithuanians such as Poles and Belarusians are not prioritised, and, even if they do receive scraps, this land is usually granted deep in Lithuanian-speaking territory, as an attempt to force more non-Lithuanians to move northwards and start assimilating them. Needless to say, the minorities are not fully accepting of this plan, and both the Bund and the Central Polish Electoral Committee have lodged protests towards this policy."
 LIT.151.a: "Nereikalauk nieko iš kito, jei pats nieko neduodi."

 LIT.152.t: "Political Trials"
 LIT.152.d: "Dissidents and political opponents arrested under the orders of Antanas Smetona have been put to trial to examine the crimes which they have been accused of. As much as Prime Minister Smetona would have wanted to control the decisions of the judiciary and turn this process into a series of show trials, democratic legal procedure prevailed in the end. Most of the detained activists have been let free with no charges, as the judges declared that the accusations directed towards them are not reason enough for any sort of jail time. Several were forced to pay fines or given a few months of arrest for less than savoury articles or actions, while the few Aušrinė leaders who fell at the hands of the government received no mercy.\n\nAll in all, while the results were less than satisfactory, the true meaning of the process soon became clear - it was not a matter of arresting anyone, but rather to instil a message to the opposition of Antanas Smetona and his government. He had no desire to be a soft, complacent democrat like his LKDP predecessors - he sought nothing less than to centralise the country around his personality. This flexing of political muscle has caused the left-wing opposition to back down by quite a fair amount."
 LIT.152.a: "Kam niežti, tas kasos."

 LIT.153.t: "Agricultural Academy Founded"
 LIT.153.d: "To toil the land, you must not only be strong, but you must also be smart. You need to always stay ahead of the curve in modern machinery, and selective breeding, know about soil quality and be well-versed in fertilisers and the specifics of each type of plant when it comes to taking care of them... To help improve agricultural efficiency and ensure that Lithuania always stays ahead of this curve, the government of Antanas Smetona has announced the foundation of the Agricultural Academy in Kaunas. It will offer courses in Agricultural Engineering, Agronomy, Economics and Management, Forestry and Ecology, and Water and Land Management - and, of course, all of them will be solely in Lithuanian. The former Prime Minister of Lithuania and a certified agronomist, Aleksandras Stulginskis, has been invited to serve as a lector in the newly established academy, his powerful persona attracting many new enrollees."
 LIT.153.a: "Old ways are the best."

 LIT.154.t: "Strength in Unity; Unity under Smetona"
 LIT.154.d: "For almost twenty years, everyone had written off Antanas Smetona as a spent force in Lithuanian politics. Too nationalistic, conservative and potentially authoritarian for King Mindaugas II's liking, he was cast aside in favour of more liberal leaders such as Baron Stasys Šilingas, the first Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Lithuania. Smetona bid his time, however, carefully building up influence in Lithuanian right-wing circles, keeping the radical nationalist forces under his leadership on a leash to maintain electability, and finally dealing the final blow in the snap election of 1937 to overcome both the Social Democrats and the Christian Democrats.\n\nAs unbelievable as it might have been a mere four years ago, Antanas Smetona is now the new Prime Minister of Lithuania - and with Black Monday successfully put under control, the unyielding, soft-spoken, yet controlling leader of the Nationalist Union has declared in a speech that his government is ready to fulfil the next part of their programme. Right now, Lithuania is a weak state - but it is a weak state because it is plagued by internal divisions, be it cultural or political, and the previous governments were incapable to put them under control. They allowed Syndicalism to foster, they were blind towards the developing process of 'Seimocracy' - an unbridled parliamentarianism and detachment between the government and the people.\n\nWhat Lithuania needs is a strong, popular leader who can guide the nation to a brighter tomorrow. It shall ascend to a unitary state, a nation of one people, not of many peoples - whether it wants to or not."
 LIT.154.a: "Tautos jėga vienybėje!"

 LIT.155.t: "Smetona's Domestic Policy"
 LIT.155.d: "Though shackled by a rift between its moderate and radical factions, as well as their Christian Democratic allies, all members of the Nationalist Union can agree on what their ultimate goals entail - a unitary Lithuanian state, one where the Lithuanian people are considered to be masters of their destiny, instead of being forced to adhere to the whims of the Kaiser. The following years will require the government of Antanas Smetona to balance between the wishes of its radical faction and their moderate allies, and ultimately marginalise both in order to push through the Prime Minister's own vision of the Lithuanian state.\n\nThe Nationalist Union will seek to improve the Lithuanian heartland and guide businesses and other economic operations to establish themselves there, and resolve the issue of German and Jewish businesses controlling Vilnius. The Southern administrative divisions, long controlled by Polish and Belarusian representatives and acting as a thorn in the Prime Minister's side, will need to be curtailed, their autonomy eliminated and loyalty instilled. The rest of the Kingdom will need to express the same loyalty, as well.\n\nAntanas Smetona's ultimate goal is to remove the Privy Council of the King and declare himself to be the 'Tautos vadas' ('Leader of the Nation') - not merely a Prime Minister appointed by the monarch, but a powerful guide, who knows what the Lithuanian people truly want, bypassing the bureaucratic swamp of the Seimas and operating under the principle of 'Pasakyta - padaryta!' ('What is said - so is done!'). That, to the Nationalist Union, is true democracy."
 LIT.155.a: "Pasakyta - padaryta!"

 LIT.156.t: "Securing the Jewish Flank"
 LIT.156.d: "In his campaign to promote the Lithuanians as the domineering ethnicity in their Kingdom, Antanas Smetona has always seen the large Jewish population as a dilemma. On one hand, the Lithuanian Jews, or 'Litvaks', are far more integrated than any other large minority group in Lithuania, their representatives were supporters of Lithuanian independence during the Weltkrieg - they may even be called a 'model minority'. On the other hand, it cannot be denied that the Lithuanian nationalism which courses through the LTS's veins is deeply tied to anti-semitism. Lithuanian nationalists hate the fact that Jewish entrepreneurs are dominating the market, and even their mere presence is too much to bear for some of the radicals of the nationalists. Smetona does not support this blatant antisemitism, but looking at the Lithuanian Jewry, he sees something which he can agree is only a threat - the Jewish Labour Bund.\n\nShlomo Kleit, the leader of the Lithuanian Bundas, has received a private visit from the Prime Minister, where he explained his point of view on the organisation - in of itself, it is a necessary evil, and there are many things which Lithuanians can learn from the productivity and unity of the Labour Bund - however, to tolerate its existence, there are reforms which he needs to undertake. As a show of force, Smetona's right-hand man, Augustinas Voldemaras, rallied the paramilitary of the Nationalist Union, the National Guard 'Geležinis Vilkas', to organise loud mass protests surrounding the headquarters of the Bundas, complete with strike teams of armed junior officers ready to burst in at a moment's notice. Kleit folded to the pressure, agreeing to Smetona's demands - expunging Syndicalist elements within the Bundas, banning the use of Russian in all publications (with either Lithuanian or Yiddish to be used), and announcing full political neutrality."
 LIT.156.a: "It will be better this way."

 LIT.157.t: "The Suwałki Region"
 LIT.157.d: "The Suwałki region, known as Suvalkija in Lithuanian, has historically been a melting pot of Polish and Lithuanian cultures. As this region was the earliest part of Lithuania to abolish serfdom, thanks to its brief annexation by the Duchy of Warsaw during the Napoleonic Wars, it became the nucleus of the Lithuanian National Revival in the 19th century. Many of Lithuania's leading nationalist figures, such as Jonas Basanavičius and Vincas Kudirka, hail from this region, and even the Lithuanian language has been standardised according to the 'Zanavykai' dialect in northern Suvalkija. However, throughout the 19th century, Polish influence continued to encroach on the region, and towns that were once a core part of Lithuanian culture, such as Sejny/Seinai, have become bilingual or even Polish-dominant.\n\nSince the formation of the Kingdom of Lithuania, the Suwałki electoral districts have been safe constituencies for the Committee of Poles in Lithuania, as their Lithuanian competitors are divided by ideological grounds and could not field a significant challenge. Polish-dominated local assemblies have been imposing education in their language, maintaining ties with other Polish communities and thus fostering the slow Polonisation of the region. Now that the Committee has been broken apart, however, Antanas Smetona's government sees an opportunity.\n\nIt may be possible to orchestrate the formation of a united Lithuanian electoral list in the Suwałki region, which would take advantage of the disunity among the Polish community and retake control of the local assemblies. If a Lithuanian local government is installed this way, not only will it be able to impose policies more acceptable to us, such as Lithuanian language education, funding for Lithuanian communities, and incentives for colonists from the north - but it will also be more loyal to us, allowing us to erode the autonomy of the region. This would cost a lot of political capital, however, as uniting ideological opponents will not be easy..."
 LIT.157.a: "Orchestrate the union of Lithuanian parties in Suwałki."

 LIT.158.t: "Lithuanian Grip over Suwałki"
 LIT.158.d: "The disunity of the Committee of Poles in Lithuania and the successful actions of Antanas Smetona's government has allowed Lithuanian parties to take control of the local government in the Suwałki region for the first time since the foundation of the Kingdom. The newly elected pro-Lithuanian assembly has undertaken significant reforms, and Antanas Smetona's central government has immediately begun supporting it with generous donations and funds from the Outer Lithuania Development Fund. Land clearance in the region has allowed families from the north to move in and establish themselves, and significant modernisation programmes have been imposed in the education system, reforming the schooling programme to one more in line with ethnic Lithuania. For our efforts of centralisation and subjugation, this is an impressive boon, even if it has drawn the ire of the Polish community."
 LIT.158.a: "We will unite Lithuania without a single bullet fired."

 LIT.159.t: "Administration Reforms - Official Language Used"
 LIT.159.d: "Traditionally, all the constituent units of Lithuania have had a sizeable degree of autonomy regarding the education system and especially languages taught as part of the education programme. The reforms of Leonas Bistras' government in the early 1930s saw this devolved system streamlined in order to create some semblance of uniformity between schools - for example, creating separate categories of schools depending on the language used for education. However, much autonomy was kept regardless. One of Antanas Smetona's primary talking points as leader of the Lithuanian Nationalist Union was to put an end to this system and put education in Lithuania solely under the control of the central government.\n\nThe Nationalist Union has lodged a bill in the Seimas which has been simply dubbed as 'Language Reform Law'. The primary goals of the project are to eliminate most of the 'school categories' created by the Leonas Bistras government and put most schools in Lithuania under a unified education programme, especially language education. All schools falling under the 'standard' school category would be required to teach Lithuanian and German to all students, and hire native speakers for the former subject - this includes schools in so-called 'Outer Lithuanian' territories, majority Polish and Belarusian regions. The Language Reform Law also includes several other streamlining education reforms unrelated to language.\n\nAnd, of course, it is stapled alongside a bill on the increase of funding for orphanages in the Vilnius region, in order to make sure that any opponent thinks twice about voting against this law and thus making poor children in Vilnius cry. This is good because this law has a lot of opponents."
 LIT.159.a: "We will unite Lithuania without a single bullet fired..."

 LIT.160.t: "Protests against Language Reform"
 LIT.160.d: "Having passed through the Seimas, the Language Reform Law is being ripped apart by the public. Even ethnic Lithuanian newspapers and public figures are calling out this project and expressing their disappointment with such a ham-fisted violation of cultural autonomy. And this is without even speaking of Polish, Belarusian and Jewish representatives, who are predictably enraged. The local governments of Białystok, Valkaviskas and Gardinas, among several others of smaller parishes, have declared that they will use any measures to prevent this law from being applied. Reports are coming that they are hiring legal experts to search for loopholes in the project in order to get around this integration of the education system."
 LIT.160.a: "The eternally plotting Pole strikes again..."

 LIT.161.t: "LTS Work Initiatives"
 LIT.161.d: "In a move that has enraged the radical elements of the LTS, Smetona has backed an initiative that is mainly focused in Białystok and Valkaviskas to assist those still suffering from the recession with offering them jobs by offering companies initiatives in hiring workers through the scheme. These jobs are menial in nature and are only given to Lithuanian companies that are working within the region (with a lot of them just being set up coincidentally).\n\nThe radicals argue that these initiatives should only be offered to Lithuanians, who too are suffering from the effects of Black Monday with the only thing they endorse from this initiative, is the need of knowing Lithuanian or taking the mandatory lessons to be eligible for this scheme. A new voice has slowly begun to rise with members of the 'Aušrininkai' (Morning Star) slowly growing in strength in the nation as Smetona's methods are forcing those who were once moderate socialists to more hardliners."
 LIT.161.a: "Aušrininkai? What a bunch of crypto-Bolsheviks..."

 LIT.162.t: "Smetona and the Privy Council"
 LIT.162.d: "Similar to the Litvaks and their bloody Bundas, Smetona knows that he can never completely remove the German presence in Lithuania. He knows that the true power behind the throne isn't the King, but his Privy Council. During the Black Monday crisis, there were members of the Privy Council urging the King to suspend the Seimas and to place themselves in charge of Lithuania to deal with the crisis. This never eventuated due to Smetona's efforts and the King's notorious apathy when it comes to matters of the state. Now plans are in motion to remove the Privy Council from their position and for Smetona to supplant them.\n\nWhilst pulling Lithuania out of the depths of hell it currently finds itself in, a special investigation team now dubbed Antrasis Departamentas to investigate the German Junkers and those of the King's Privy Council was formed. Its goal was to investigate any possible links these two groups had with the Black Monday Crisis. It appears that Antrasis Departamentas uncovered damning evidence regarding both groups, which if exposed would put both groups in hot water with Lithuanian authorities and those in Germany.\n\nIn the most dramatic parliamentary session for decades, Smetona finally presented the findings on how the German Junkers and businessmen had planned to 'milk the Lithuanian cow dry'. Smetona continued stating that these groups were backed by the Privy Council. To the shock of the Privy Council, the King made no move to defend them. Cries of protest started against Smetona's 'power grab', but these lacked strength. It was obvious that the King took rather the Lithuanian side, and without him, Smetona could not be stopped.\n\nMost of the Privy Council resigned. The rest of their powers were stripped with emergency legislation that conferred their privileges to Smetona himself. That wasn't the final shock for the day, the new legislation had also been stapled with a review of the basic welfare package with further support and expanding of its services to be provided to the chuckle of the King."

 LIT.165.t: "Alantas's 'Žygiuojanti Lietuva'"
 LIT.165.d: "The victory of the Lithuanian Nationalist Union has given a breath of fresh air to nationalist thought in our country. One of the first actions of the Smetona government was to legalise numerous nationalist newspapers and journals banned over the years, most notably the 'Vairas' (The Wheel). Once the newspaper of the Party of National Progress, it took a different turn after the Memel Uprising, under the leadership of the journalist and poet Vytautas Alantas.\n\nAlantas and his clique of supporters, such as Jonas Statkus and Domas Cesevičius, believe that it is not enough to simply assert Lithuanian superiority in our nation. The Lithuanian culture itself must be purified and unwanted foreign influences within it must be removed - for it was this inability to purify which led to Lithuania becoming a slave to Poland, then to Russia, and finally Germany. It is even more extreme in its nationalist stances than even the most radical leaders of the Nationalist Union - it has no desire to even pay lip service to democracy, and its hatred towards any ethnic minorities in Lithuania is unprecedented... however, they cheer for Smetona and his goals of strong leadership nonetheless, seeing it as a step in the right direction.\n\nIn his most recent work, 'Žygiuojanti Lietuva' ('Marching Lithuania'), Alantas hails Smetona's government, yet at the same time declares that it needs radical reforms. His primary talking point is Christianity, which Alantas does not hide his disdain for. Describing it as an unwanted, destructive influence imposed upon Lithuania by foreign powers, he calls for Smetona's government to break up the influence of clericalism, abandon its pretences of democracy and embrace the ideals of pagan humanism, a return to the metaphysical of our forefathers, and selfless sacrifice to one's country. To heed this call would be absurd - but perhaps we can introduce some of these concepts... in moderation?"

 LIT.167.d: "A surge of nationalism is rolling across our nation, and it does not always lead to good things. Seeing where the wind is blowing, patriotic Lithuanian youths, many of them believed to be associated with the Lithuanian Activist Front, have begun terrorising minorities in our country, both in our towns and in our villages. Mobs have begun to assault non-Lithuanian landowners and farmers across the country, sometimes besieging their farmsteads and issuing them an order to forcefully sell their lands to 'patriots', in order to evict the minorities from their homes and send them down south. Sharp and scathing reports have barraged Lithuanian newspapers, most of them accusing the Smetona government of the violence and demanding a change in policies - even though this has not been planned at all. The Seimas and even a few members of the cabinet are calling for the Prime Minister to issue a halt to the violence, lest they risk the minorities turning even more hostile than they already are. On the other hand, perhaps there might be a way of controlling these uppity youths to channel their enthusiasm elsewhere?"

With the official designation of 'The Model Lithuanian', the new programmes encourage Lithuanians' participation in song festivals and cultural events where stories of old Lithuania are glorified. In addition, if one walked down Vilnius' Old Town streets, they would be greeted with Lithuanian, a language once only heard in the homes. City signs have been rewritten in Lithuanian, and newspapers written in Lithuania are becoming increasingly popular. Schools are required to teach Lithuanian, and instruction in schools is all given in Lithuanian. According to Smetona and his LTS party, the programmes have been highly successful; the rebirth of a new Lithuania has begun."

 LIT.170.d: "Constantly opposing Smetona and criticising the leader on his seemingly 'undemocratic measures', the breakaway faction of the Christian Democrats, the Homeland Union, has been a constant thorn to Smetona's ambitions. As Tautos Vadas and as the virtual head of state in Lithuania, Smetona today has signed into legislation the merging of the Homeland Union into his LTS party. This effectively crushes all resistance towards Smetona's rule, and the Seimas (the Lithuanian Parliament) has been completely made into Smetona's puppet.

We shall provide relief to the suffering Lithuanian farmer and combat the Mammonic greed of German and Jewish capitalists in our cities to create an integral, compassionate society for all.\n\nOnce this economic crisis is curtailed and its worst effects relieved, I shall seek to guide the Lithuanian nation towards a new, greater era. It is not right to heal the symptoms without addressing the root cause of our problems - that the Kingdom has been shackled by 'Seimocracy'. Lacking a strong and respectable government, it has been driven to the ground by fools in the Seimas. Our representatives are bought out by Jews and Germans and pay lip service to foreigners in our country where there really should be none. If Lithuania wishes to thrive in this day and age, it can only do so with a strong, unitary government, which respects the Lithuanian people first and foremost.\n\nI sincerely hope that you shall continue to support me in the following years, and join me in my cause.\n\nThis has been the message delivered to you by our Pirmasis Ministras, Antanas Smetona'."

 LIT.180.t: "Securing the Polish Flank"
 LIT.180.d: "Ever since the formation of the Kingdom of Lithuania, its southern electoral districts, especially the Białystok Region and many constituencies in the Vilnius Region, have been dominated by the Committee of Poles in Lithuania. Throughout the last sixteen years, this united front of Polish minority candidates has had complete control over their respective regions - however, it is a brittle political party and its influence over the Polish minority is not immovable.\n\nIdeological divisions in the KPL/LLK have plagued it since its earliest days - Stanisław Narutowicz, the respected longtime leader of the party, is socially liberal and leaning towards socialism in economic matters, whereas several of his deputy leaders and fresh members steer significantly to the right, maintaining close ties with right-wing Polish parties such as the Endecja and Chadecja. For Smetona, this was a fertile ground to break up his opposition. Narutowicz was the easiest to bend - the two of them knew each other from the days of the Council of Lithuania, and the elderly politician eventually bent under pressure and agreed to enter a political pact of 'non-aggression' with the LTS. This immediately caused massive rifts within the Committee, leading to the formation of two new political parties - 'Christian Democracy of Poles in Lithuania' and Marian Zyndram-Kościałkowski's irredentist 'Polish Electoral Action'.\n\nAt the same time, the Seimas successfully approved plans for the creation of a Southern Lithuania Development Fund, giving the central government in Vilnius a say in investment and development in Polish majority regions, allowing them to fund communities and schools supportive of their goals and breaking up the hegemony of the Committee in local affairs. With several successful moves, the power of the Committee has been heavily weakened."
 LIT.180.a: "Lieka lenkas be skatiko..."

 LIT.181.t: "Narutowicz's Protest"
 LIT.181.d: "In the midst of growing resentment over Antanas Smetona's unitary and authoritarian measures, Stanisław Narutowicz, the leader of the weakened, battered, but still standing Committee of Lithuanian Poles has attempted to take the role of peacemaker again. The calm, collected, elderly Polish-Lithuanian aristocrat has historically stepped in to resolve conflicts in the Seimas several times in his career, commanding immense gravitas despite leading a Polish minority party - however, Smetona has proven to be a tougher nut to crack. Narutowicz sent several personal letters to Smetona, stating that much like in 1918, the future of the Lithuanian state depends on compromise, rather than brutally enforced extreme nationalism. To maintain the stability of the country, he should listen to the concerns of the opposition and dial down his efforts, and recognise that Poles and Jews are as much Lithuanians as the Lithuanians themselves."
 LIT.181.a: "When will this old Pole stop sticking his nose in where it doesn't belong?"

 LIT.182.t: "Białystok in Flames"
 LIT.182.d: "With Smetona pushing for administration reforms appears to have been the straw that has finally broken the camel's back. What started off as minor civil disputes here and there, has escalated to widespread rioting, as both the Jewish and Polish population within Białystok come together regarding the new Language Reforms.\n\nSome of Smetona's allies even demanded that martial law be imposed on the city, with him sending those loyal to the party to quell the insurrection.\n\nThough the cooler heads of the coalition have stated both Narutowicz and Victor are willing to assist in the matter, though to what end is on the forefront on Smetona's mind."
 LIT.182.b: "There has to be a reasonable solution!"

 LIT.183.t: "Compromise offered"
 LIT.183.d: "To the surprise of many, compromise has been reached by none other than Smetona! As the head of state and with full authority, he signed into effect legislation guarding the rights of Polish-Lithuanians. He has promised to grant the city of Białystok local recognition of the Polish language and the implementation of Polish language schools. Smetona has even decided to compromise further and has appointed a Polish politician to his cabinet of ministers. The battle is finally over, and the streets are now quieter.\n\nAfter weeks of unrest in Białystok, a sense of normalcy has returned. The military stepped in, and the result was incredibly effective; civil dissent ceased. In addition, the most radical Poles such as Zyndram were rounded up and arrested. For now, the situation has calmed down and civilians, Poles and Jews alike, breathe a sigh of relief as it would appear the situation will not escalate."
 LIT.183.a: "That old fox is always full of surprises."

 LIT.200.t: "Tears Among the Left"
 LIT.200.d: "As much as the Social Democrats may want to claim that they have arrived here to reform Lithuanian society from its very foundations, this will be a task easier said than done. The election of 1937 has left the LSDP commanding a loose and fragile coalition of democratic socialists, Santara's secular liberals, the near-Syndicalist Jewish Labour Bund, and the Polish minority. The Social Democrats themselves are not united in their direction. The old guard of the party, Kairys included, have moderated severely during the postwar years - but not everyone followed this trend. A strong radical socialist faction, led by Vincas Galinis, Justas Paleckis, and others remains. During the 1920s, the LSDP absorbed the Popular Peasants Union led by Mykolas Sleževičius, integrating a moderate, mildly social liberal faction into their caucus. And this caucus is close to a breaking point.\n\nThe mere mention of Kairys's sweeping reforms are agitating Syndicalist sympathy within the Party. Already, the LSDP is seen as a less-than-trustworthy force and few believe that it has truly abandoned republicanism. Whether the Prime Minister will seek to destroy this radical influence, or subjugate it and ride the wave forward, will unfold in the years to come."
 LIT.200.a: "Let's hope some semblance of unity remains."

 LIT.201.t: "National Personal Autonomy"
 LIT.201.d: "Immediately upon the results of the election of 1937, Steponas Kairys, the new Prime Minister of Lithuania and head of the Social Democratic Party, muttered the immortal words - 'Now we have work to do for a long time'. His opponents immediately took this as a prediction that Kairys will try to stay in power as long as his health allows it - in truth, however, what he was referring to was the structural reforms which he and his party hoped to undertake.\n\nThe Social Democratic Party of Lithuania professes the ideal of National Personal Autonomy. First formulated by Otto Bauer in 1907, it remains the prevailing ethnic policy of the Austromarxist movement, which the LSDP borrows most of its ideas from - what it seeks to achieve is to turn the nation not into a territorial and ethnic entity, but instead a simple association of persons, disjoining the state from its territory. After all, what says that, to be a Lithuanian, you need to live specifically in this plot in Europe and follow a specific set of traditions? As long as you believe yourself to be Lithuanian, hold Lithuanian citizenship, and contribute to the nation, either through taxes or through other ways, what stops you from being considered Lithuanian?\n\nA similar view was espoused by many Bundist Jewish ideologists and thus turned the Social Democrats and the Bundas into natural allies. During their term, the government of Prime Minister Steponas Kairys will seek to undertake significant reforms to achieve their ideal of National Personal Autonomy. Each ethnic group in Lithuania will have their own universal cultural assemblies, with the ability to levy its own taxes and autonomously decide on matters pertaining to its members. Every citizen of the Kingdom would belong to one of these cultural assemblies, but the question of which national movement to join would be a matter of personal choice, and no authority would have any control over his decision.\n\nOf course, these reforms will coincide with LSDP's other policy programmes, such as a swift establishment of a welfare system and taking out the right-wing opposition, mostly through legal methods."
 LIT.201.a: "Svarbiausia - darbo žmogus!"

 LIT.202.t: "Curtailing the Influence of the Church"
 LIT.202.d: "The Lithuanian priesthood has traditionally been a very important lobby in Lithuanian economics. There is no shortage of priests and bishops who move from their spiritual duties into the Seimas, plenty have historically been influential ministers or even occupied the Prime Minister seat. Almost universally, the priesthood are loyal followers of the Christian Democratic Party, and use their influence to not only push through policy beneficial towards them, such as state funding for the Church, but also do not hide their stances during sermons and mass. During the most recent electoral campaign, there has been no shortage of cases when fiery priests called that any soul who casts their vote for the Social Democrats will go straight to Hell - and not only is this an annoyance, but also a serious violation of democratic ideals.\n\nThe entire Popular Front coalition agrees that the influence of the Lithuanian priesthood should be curtailed, but disagree on how far these measures should go. The moderate members of the cabinet believe that soft measures such as rescinding state funding for the Catholic Church and strictly enforcing political neutrality should cut it, especially since much of the countryside is still deeply religious and would not take a state conflict with the Church well. The democratic socialist lobby is dissatisfied, however - nothing less than full secularisation will satisfy them. Through a ban on religious education, state control of seminaries and reformed education programmes, they believe that the back of the Catholic Church can be broken for good."
 LIT.202.a: "A moderate approach should be taken."
 LIT.202.b: "The Church has no place in the runnings of the state!"

 LIT.203.t: "Military Cuts Debate"
 LIT.203.d: "The Royal Lithuanian Armed Forces and the Social Democratic Party have never been allies. The Army has traditionally been a profession of the right-wing, their clubs such as the Vilnius Ramovė (Vilnius Officers' Club) openly declare socialism to be a hydra that needed to be fought. Though Prime Minister Steponas Kairys voted in favour of the incumbent Chief of Staff, Stasys Raštikis, back in 1935, believing him to be a politically neutral choice, he has denounced the general's reform project as a waste of money during the campaign trail, instead declaring that these funds should be put into social programmes. It is time to act upon these campaign promises.\n\nThe idea of cutting military funding is especially popular among the radical wing of the LSDP, whose spokesmen Vincas Galinis and Justas Paleckis claim that the army serves as nothing more than a hurdle to the inevitable march of socialism. Is it really worth it to poke the sleeping bear of the Armed Forces, however? The moderate lobby disagrees, their claim is that the funding for social programmes can be procured in safer ways, ones which do not turn the army completely against the government."
 LIT.203.a: "We'll find the money through other means."
 LIT.203.b: "Begin military spending cuts!"

 LIT.204.t: "Further Social Spending"
 LIT.204.d: "As the Social Democratic-led popular front implements its wide-reaching welfare programmes, it has reached a halt once disagreements began to break out within the government, crowned by a rather hostile argument between the Social Democratic representative Vincas Galinis and the deputy leader of the Democratic National Freedom League, Vaclovas Sidzikauskas. The latter strongly opposed the former's proposal of implementing unprecedented pro-labour reforms, such as establishing a national labour relations board and implementing state funding for trade unions. Sidzikauskas' claim is that with each proposal as radical as this one, Lithuania veers closer and closer to Syndicalism. Already, Santara has accepted concessions such as a minimum wage, generous pensions and work safety regulations, but it cannot accept radical policy of this unprecedented scale.\n\nIt falls to Prime Minister Steponas Kairys and his cabinet to figure out their response to this conflict within the coalition."
 LIT.204.a: "We can make a compromise"
 LIT.204.b: "We were elected to help the people!"

 LIT.205.t: "Legalise Aušrinė"
 LIT.205.d: "No discussion on Syndicalism in Lithuania can pass without the mention of 'Aušrinė' and the Society of Socialist Students which bears the same name as the journal. Originally founded in 1910, it was by far the most left-wing of all Lithuanian nationalist societies in the last years of the Tsarist period. Even before the Weltkrieg, it translated the works of Benoît Malon and Pyotr Kropotkin and declared itself to be an 'individualist socialist', idealising a society of free communes, liberty and religious freedom. In 1923, after several issues where it openly advocated in favour of the French Communard system, 'Aušrinė' was banned and the society of students which organised around it moved underground, where they continued issuing periodicals and radicalise further.\n\nThough a movement of poets and intellectuals at its core, the 'Aušrininkai' have occasionally participated in acts of terror, such as bombings, assassination attempts and clashes with the police, swiftly turning into a boogeyman for the Lithuanian right. It is also no secret that many members of the Social Democrats Party are acquainted with the movement, either by attending their secret meetings or reading their banned literature - thus it is unsurprising that one of their goals is to lift this ban and put an end to years of Aušrininkai terrorism. How should this legalisation take place, however?.."
 LIT.205.a: "Legalise them, if they disassociate from Syndicalism."
 LIT.205.b: "Legalise them now!"

 LIT.206.t: "Status of the Bundas"
 LIT.206.d: "Although the Bundas are trade unions, they are being organised by Jews, and for Jews alone. Having been allies of the LSDP, most within the party wish to allow them to keep their current influence over the Jewish minority. Radicals however have criticised the Bundas for their disassociation from the rest of the country, wishing to form a national trade union congress in order to undermine their influence and organise all trade unions more centrally."
 LIT.206.a: "The Bundas are our natural allies."
 LIT.206.b: "Stronger trade unions are an expression of democracy."

 LIT.207.t: "A Rainy Night in Vilnius"
 LIT.207.d: "Because of its origin as a party opposed to the Lithuanian and German establishment, the LSDP is notable for holding far more secretive meetings than any other legal political party in the country, sometimes in foreign countries or under the guise of third party organisations. The Lithuanian Group for the Study of French Culture is one of them. Officially a non-aligned organisation dedicated to the study of French culture, art and literature after the Revolution of 1919, it is believed to be a method for the spread of Internationale influence in Lithuanian left-wing circles. With the LSDP seemingly turning towards radicalism, the Lithuanian secret services, in cooperation with their German peers, have finally chosen to act. Through secret channels, they have recruited Vytautas Mačernis to investigate the Group and collect information on the future plans of the Party. Equipped with forged documentation of his membership in the Social Democratic Party and a faint, seemingly confident smile, the young poet turned spy heads through the rainy streets of Vilnius to come across the headquarters of the Group in Vokiečiai Street..."
 LIT.207.a: "Everything seems correct. You may pass."

 LIT.208.t: "Vilnius After the Rain"
 LIT.208.d: "The situation, as described by Mačernis in his notes, is worse than it may seem. Members of the LSDP, Aušrininkai and their allies alike, after singing the Internationale in Lithuanian, Polish and Yiddish, congratulated each other on the successes of the past year and outlined their plans for the future. One thing which all of them agreed upon, however, was that German and bourgeois domination in Lithuania will not last. According to the two keynote speakers, Justas Paleckis and Vincas Galinis, the inevitable war between the Reichspakt and the Internationale will be the perfect opportunity to lay down the last step towards a proletarian, Syndicalist revolution..."
 LIT.208.a: "We shall be ready."

 LIT.209.t: "The King Steps In"
 LIT.209.d: "Once the initial chaos of the country started to recede, King Vytautas II of Lithuania declared his stance on recent events in a speech at the Seimas. By that point, the incumbent government was prepared to face a vote of no confidence, calls for a new Seimas election were flooding public discourse, and the stability of the country took a severe blow. The King announced that the extreme situation in the country calls for measures to stabilise it, and the traitorous actions of the Social Democrats mean that they have fully lost the assent of the monarch.\n\nSteponas Kairys has been forced out, with Stasys Šalkauskis appointed as the new PM with an LKDP government. The Social Democrat hopes for reform have been dashed, and now only revolution will be able to salvage their ideals - if it ever happens..."
 LIT.209.a: "The end of the road, then..."

 LIT.210.t: "The Lithuanian Revolution"
 LIT.210.d: "The victorious march of the Third Internationale in the Second Weltkrieg has finally opened up an opportunity in Lithuania. For years, the Social Democratic government, long since overtaken from the inside by Syndicalist sympathisers, played second fiddle to its Western neighbour, but now that their armies are faltering and the Internationale seems poised to win the struggle for the future of Europe, the chance to break free has finally risen up. The leadership of the Party and the members in Cabinet have gone through with their plan to arrest King Vytautas II and have already begun disarming the German garrisons in the country, declaring the complete independence of Lithuania from all foreign powers!"
 LIT.210.a: "Workers of the World, unite!"

 LIT.211.t: "Coup d'Etat in Lithuania"
 LIT.211.d: "Following a coup carried out by radicals from within the ruling Social Democrat government in Lithuanian, the Lithuanian monarchy has been abolished and our troops have been disarmed. Their new regime has immediately declared independence and now threatens to cut us from the rest of the Baltics. We must act quickly if we want to restore order."
 LIT.211.a: "Traitors!"

 LIT.212.t: "Nationalist Uprising in Lithuania"
 LIT.212.d: "Vilnius is in chaos. Long a thorn on our side, the rabidly anti-German Lithuanian Activist Front was evidently not deemed a threat strong enough to worry about by the ruling government - a fatal mistake that has cost us dearly. With the connivance of like-minded army officials, LAF cells have risen up and successfully taken over the capital, with the king barely escaping the ensuing battle.\n\nThe new regime has immediately declared a war of independence against 'German domination', and now threatens to link up with Russian forces and cut us from the rest of the Baltics."
 LIT.212.a: "We have crushed them once, we will crush\nthem again."

 LIT.213.d: "We have received a telegram from Berlin that a state of war now exists between us and the German Empire. They are clearly not letting us go, though, through the strength of the people, we shall persevere, and boil those Prussians in their armour like our ancestors did many years ago."

 LIT.214.d: "We have received a telegram from Berlin that a state of war now exists between us and the German Empire. They are clearly not letting us go and it's unlikely that we would survive on our own. While we can try to defend our country by ourselves, sending a telegram to Paris and pledge for help might guarantee the survival of our independent Lithuanian state."

 LIT.216.t: "The Liberals Express Their Worries"
 LIT.216.d: "Our ongoing turn towards radical socialism has started to alienate our moderate allies in the coalition. Members of the Democratic National Freedom League 'Santara', including its leader Stasys Šilingas, have spoken before the Seimas expressing their worries about some of the recent actions of our government. They have issued a call for their coalition allies to reconsider their position. The conflicts between the moderate and radical forces in our coalition have been even more dramatic off-screen, and the stability of our coalition has become tenuous. We must make a decision to salvage our coalition government one way or another."
 LIT.216.a: "Fine, we'll find a way to appease the centrists for now..."

 LIT.217.t: "The Slow Speed of Reforms"
 LIT.217.d: "Our slow pace in enacting reforms has begun to alienate the radical wing of the Social Democratic Party. Labour activists such as Vincas Galinis and Justas Paleckis have all spoken in turns in the Seimas, declaring that the incumbent government needs to rapidly hasten the pace of reforms, take radical steps in ensuring the equality of society and destroy the last vestiges of opposition against the encroaching socialist order. The conflict has been even more dramatic and serious off-screen, to the point where the integrity of the Social Democratic Party is turning frailer and frailer. We must make a decision to salvage our coalition government one way or another."
 LIT.217.a: "Fine, we'll try to maintain party unity..."

 LIT.218.t: "Jewish Cultural Autonomy Elections"
 LIT.218.d: "The idea of National Personal Autonomy posits that the state should intervene as little as possible in cultural and ethnic affairs and instead hand over power over these fields to autonomous communities, who lack territory and are instead a congregation or a syndicate of persons who associate themselves with that ethnic group on their own accord. These autonomous ethnic communities would be able to levy their own taxes, establish their own education programmes, and, of course, elect their own leadership.\n\nToday, elections are held in the cultural autonomy of the Lithuanian Jews. Though superficially dominated by the Jewish Labour Bund and their electoral lists, the Lithuanian Jewish community is highly ideologically varied, and while socialism is highly prominent among them, the liberal Folkspartei and Orthodox Jewish conservative Agudat Israel gather a lot of support as well. The results of the election are sure to shape the Jewish cultural autonomy for years to come, and..."

 LIT.221.t: "On the Questions of Our Party Programme..."
 LIT.221.d: "If, in 1921, we could declare in our programme this: 'The socialist revolution taking place across the world and the victories of the proletariat elsewhere... will lend support to Lithuanian workers and show the path to a new future with their example', then today is not the time to express this hope too far. Not because this hope could be miscalculated or wrong, but because the Lithuanian workers need to first be able to trust each other and forge their own future. The events of the last decade only remind us that only those proletarian victories are permanent which the people managed to not just acquire, but to maintain.\n\nThe working class in Lithuania will only be able to take over and establish socialism when the economic conditions of the country place us to proletarian lines or tie the majority of the population to them when this majority becomes a willing supporter of the socialist agenda.'\n\nThese are words written by Steponas Kairys in 1929, defining and specifying the ultimate goal of the Social Democratic Party - democratic socialism. Needless to say, now that it has actually come to power and has been forced to ally with liberal democratic parties, this policy has come under serious question. Is it time to abandon evolutionary Marxism and finally join the ranks of the capitalist parties, or is a socialist utopia still our final goal?"

 LIT.222.d: "It is no secret that the Royal Lithuanian Armed Forces and the Social Democrats are under no good terms. While they are able to tolerate Chief of Staff Stasys Raštikis due to his generally non-confrontational attitude, many of his right-wing subordinates are a different question entirely. This includes Generals Kazys Škirpa and Povilas Plechavičius, leaders of the far right clique within the Lithuanian army, utterly despised by the Lithuanian far left and holding no warm feelings in exchange. The radical wing of the LSDP has drafted a policy plan to force these right-wing officers into early retirement, subordinating the army to civilian authority at the cost of bleeding out the officer corps. The rest of the coalition disagrees with the extent of the programme, however, believing that this is too reminiscent of Syndicalist terror and unacceptable policy in a democratic state.\n\nWhat is the decision made by the Prime Minister?"

 LIT.230.d: "The waves of Black Monday behind us have drawn attention to the economic situation of Vilnius. Despite nominally being the capital of our Kingdom, we do not control the economic processes taking place here - as a part of our agreements with the German Empire in the 1920s, it was designated as a city for German investment and development. Economic regulations and taxes here are loose, but the bankruptcy or evacuation of our German investors means that a gaping hole has been left in the city's economy. Companies owned by the Bundas and local Lithuanian investors alike have been trying to fill up that gap as much as they can, and both of them protest the pro-German rules and regulations still present. As the Kaiserreich is going through plenty of troubles back home, we have the unique opportunity to assert our economic independence from Germany without immediate repercussions. What should be done with these regulations as well as remaining, abandoned German assets?"

Prince Wilhelm von Urach, the disgraced elder brother of Vytautas II, has since pursued a career in automobile engineering - with the patronage of their late father, and plentiful contacts, he received a job in Daimler-Benz both in the engineering department and as a scout for new places where the company may establish itself. Today, he seeks an audience with his brother directly, asking for assistance in convincing the cabinet to allow a large Daimler-Benz factory to be established near Vilnius.\n\nThe arrival of such a titan of German manufacturing would certainly provide a boost in revenue as well as a large number of jobs for the unemployed - however, Lithuanian media will certainly pick up the favouritism."

 LIT.234.t: "Grand Opening"
 LIT.234.d: "Daimler-Benz Ost has officially begun operations, and the first automotive plant in Memel is already bringing dividends as well as employing hundreds. The day before the opening, Prince Wilhelm made a call to his brother from Lithuania Minor, explaining that he is disappointed in the decision and his bosses are not going to think highly of Lithuania from now on. A week after, the first scathing news reports from the media came, complaining about the missed German investment opportunities, which have now been funnelled over the German border."

 LIT.235.d: "The Daimler-Benz company has announced the creation of a new branch of the company: Daimler-Benz Lithuania, with a stated purpose to develop the company's automobile manufacturing and to establish new automotive plants in Germany's neighbour. Already, the first automotive plant has been established in Vilnius. The grand opening of the plant has been attended by numerous political figures, as well as both the King and Prince Wilhelm. Though far from everyone in the Lithuanian government is happy with further German economic influence in the country, one cannot deny that the benefits are already flowing in. More and more people are being employed by the company every day."

 LIT.249.t: "National Guard 'Iron Wolf'"
 LIT.249.d: "The Lithuanian military has historically been a haven for right-wing thought, serving as a place of acceptance for nationalistic and authoritarian personalities - the most radical of them organise in the so-called 'sports club' known as the National Guard 'Iron Wolf' (Geležinis vilkas). While nominally allied with the Lithuanian Nationalist Union, it is, in truth, loyal solely to Augustinas Voldemaras, and many of its members are suspected to play a key role in the underground LAF.\n\nServing as a unifying force for right-wing nationalist soldiers and officers, the Iron Wolf is difficult to define ideologically, aside for the generic 'national populist' label, although they do have some unifying pieces of thought. The Iron Wolf's vision of a perfect Lithuanian state has been best expressed by one of the organisation's chief ideologues, cavalry officer Juozas Tomkus, in the underground newspaper 'Tautos kelias'. The Weltkrieg and the years after have proven two things - that all wars from here on out will be won by not just arms and regular troops, but the mobilisation of the entire nation for war; and that Lithuania is destined to end up at war eventually, and anyone foolish enough to believe that these are times of peace has no place in the country. The only way for Lithuania to survive is for it to become an army - from the man in the front to the woman in the back, from the professor in the laboratories and worker in the factories, every single person and every single resource must be dedicated to national defence. Every single Lithuanian must be trained to wield a weapon and know his place in the armed nation. Such a nation will be completely unassailable and impossible to destroy."
 LIT.249.a: "I see..."

 LIT.250.t: "LAF Change Tactics"
 LIT.250.d: "The people of Lithuania have been experiencing nothing more than an utter reign of terror as the LAF has begun a new wave of terror attacks in cities and towns across the nation. While we have long questioned how and where they are getting their supplies and weapons, our intelligence has indicated that it appears that Russia is supplying them. While our intelligence has revealed that the LAF is not strong enough to topple our regime through a civil war, it is evident that the LAF is content with simply hampering the government and its reforms. Their propaganda can be found in towns all around Lithuania with leaflets describing the severe faults and failings of the ruling administration. If they have genuinely chosen violence to convey their message, then we may have to return with just as much violence to end their insurrection once and forever."
 LIT.250.a: "All who take the sword die by the sword."

 LIT.251.t: "Industrial Sabotage"
 LIT.251.d: "This morning, the residents in Vilnius awoke to a dreadful sight and sound as a bomb went off in a factory, killing several and wounding scores. The bomb severely damaged the factory while also scarring the local infrastructure. The attack has been claimed by none other than the LAF, who claim that the purpose of the attack was to strike at German businesses in Lithuania. While the local firemen and police officers' response is admirable, many locals are highly unnerved, with some even blaming the Lithuanian government for inaction. There are even growing murmurs that the government's actions in recent days have done nothing but provoke the LAF into orchestrating more terror attacks. If we are to regain the trust of our people, then we must double down on our efforts to show the people that we can protect them!"
 LIT.251.a: "We will prevail!"

 LIT.252.t: "Arms Factory Attacked"
 LIT.252.d: "Just last night, an arms factory in Kaunas found itself bombed, disrupting an entire production line of armaments. While reports on the ground indicate no deaths, there are still plenty of workers wounded. The attack has been claimed by none other than the LAF, who have declared that their attack aimed to disrupt Germany's hold on our nation. While rebuilding our damaged industry will take time, our citizens grow weary of the violence each day. If we are to regain our peoples' support, then we must eradicate the LAF as soon as possible before they attempt more drastic measures."
 LIT.252.a: "They will pay for it!"

 LIT.253.t: "All Quiet"
 LIT.253.d: "After weeks of violence, bloodshed, and terrorism, the LAF has... disappeared. Like rats in the shadows, it appears either that the government suppression of LAF activities is working or that the LAF is planning something else, something sinister perhaps than their previous actions have shown. While hardliners are pushing for the military to seek out the LAF actively, a search of the LAF would be akin to finding a needle in a haystack without any intelligence of their whereabouts. Unfortunately, it appears that we must wait for them to make the first move before we crush them once and for all..."
 LIT.253.a: "It's quiet... too quiet..."

 LIT.254.t: "Failed Attack"
 LIT.254.d: "The military command in Vilnius was utterly ecstatic today when news of an actual victory reached them. It appears in their vain arrogance, the dogs of the LAF attempted to raid a small military outpost near Kaunas in broad daylight. They most likely intended to raid the base purely for supplies since they have been on the run and are probably running out of fuel for their so-called insurrection. Striking the base foolishly, the defenders fired from fortified sandbag positions and towers, picking off the LAF forces like fish in a barrel. Finally, after substantial casualties, the LAF fled for the woods once more but not before leaving behind their wounded and fallen comrades. News of the victory has reached the streets of all Lithuanian towns, with the military and government praised for the response. Finally, we have achieved great success, a testament to our government's strength and our military's loyalty to Lithuania!"
 LIT.254.a: "Good riddance."

 LIT.255.t: "Railway Bombing"
 LIT.255.d: "Residents along the Kaunas-Virbalis railway awoke to a loud explosion and a cloud of smoke in the middle of the night. It would appear that in the dead of night, the LAF terrorists struck quickly and vanished just as fast into the Lithuanian forests. The implication of their attack is clear; the rail lines in Lithuania are pivotal to the supply and transportation of the Reichspakt, and without them, troops around the Reichspakt's eastern borders would have their food and ammunition hindered. While we will send reconstruction crews to get our trains up and running once more quickly, the latest attack reflects the increasingly violent nature of the LAF. We will make sure that when we find them, they will pay for their crimes."
 LIT.255.a: "We will catch them!"

 LIT.256.t: "Military Depot Raided"
 LIT.256.d: "A military depot in Białystok, close to the Polish-Lithuanian border, found itself under attack in the dead of night. With the sudden firing of a flare as a signal, the LAF forces converged upon the outpost, targeting whoever and whatever they could, while also picking off panicked deserters from the trees. Most of whom initially panicked, the loyalist defenders began a courageous defence using the depot's light machine guns to suppress the enemy. However, the LAF insurgents had vanished deep into the Knyszyn Forest despite their valiant attempts, and the defenders were too exhausted to pursue them. By the time the sun finally rose, reinforcements in the military had finished putting out the last of the fires. The damage to the city's industrial hub is assessed to be light and moderate, but the lives lost were irreplaceable."
 LIT.256.a: "Those bastards will pay."

 LIT.257.t: "Battle in the Streets"
 LIT.257.d: "In an utterly brazen attack that was undoubtedly motivated by racial hatred, the town of Pabradė found itself under attack by LAF forces in broad daylight. In a chaotic rampage, the LAF set upon the centre of the city, causing havoc and destruction everywhere they went. The city's Jewish population, nearly making up one-third of the population, fled from the town in abject fear. However, the cry for help did not fall on deaf ears, and the alarm reached a local garrison of Lithuanian military that arrived in the town at once. After an intense firefight on the city streets and the LAF fled, but the damage had been done. Houses, shops, and businesses were targeted in the orgy of violence, and although the military has restored order, the incident has most certainly unnerved many Lithuanians. As evident from this attack in the day, it is clear that the LAF is getting stronger day by day, and the question on everyone's minds is - when will they return."
 LIT.257.a: "Even in broad daylight?"

 LIT.258.t: "Army Remains Neutral"
 LIT.258.d: "As civil strife rears its ugly head in the Kingdom, the Royal Lithuanian Defence Forces have been witnessing more and more divide. It's undeniable that there are sympathies for Voldemaras present among the officer corps, especially among the more radical young guard. The respected spokesman of the armed forces, Stasys Raštikis, however, has tried to navigate the delicate issue by keeping the LAF sympathisers on the sidelines without outright forbidding them from holding command. For now, the army is on the side of the lawful government, but the creeping doubt still lingers."
 LIT.258.a: "Not great, not terrible."

 LIT.259.t: "Minorities Harassed"
 LIT.259.d: "Reports are coming in from the southern provinces, informing about horrifying acts committed by members of the Activist Front. To nail down and enforce the message that they stand for a 'Lithuania for Lithuanians', these nationalists have been harassing and attacking Polish, Belarusian and Jewish minorities, driving them out of their homes in the cities and assaulting known notable leaders of those ethnic groups. More often than not, this violence has been responded to by violence - the Jewish Labour Bund has started to organise self-defence squads to protect their members, so have the Poles in Białystok, and they have been getting into shootouts with 'Wolves', as the LAF paramilitaries have been dubbed."
 LIT.259.a: "We will protect our own!"

 LIT.260.t: "Lithuania in Flames"
 LIT.260.d: "Violence. Every day, the newspaper headlines scream nothing but the violence committed by the LAF. In the streets of northern Lithuania, the pavements run red with blood. The wolves of Voldemaras have been roaming the streets searching for prey, their victims often being Poles. Their violence has even escalated to the point where priests are becoming victims; a Polish priest was gravely wounded after being beaten badly by members of the LAF. The Catholic organisation Ateitis grows militant by the day, angered by the military's inaction and protective of their priests. There are even rumours and murmurs that members of the LŠS are also supporters of Voldemaras - a grave indication that perhaps the LAF's support base is more extensive than what is on paper. An old Polish general, Żeligowski, has been vocal in his demands for the government to take bolder action, or the Poles will organise and start defending themselves."
 LIT.260.a: "We must act!"

 LIT.261.t: "The Mysterious Case of Kauno Radiofonas"
 LIT.261.d: "Two days ago, a radio station of Kauno Radiofonas, suddenly went under and its broadcasts ceased. Police were called to the headquarters of the building immediately, called by concerned citizens, but they found only an empty building and all of its equipment mysteriously vanished. Before the story could even be publicised by national newspapers and the mystery brought to the limelight, it solved itself - Kauno Radiofonas started broadcasting messages yet again. The message was clear - it was a speech of hatred towards the Poles, the Jews, the Germans and all other 'parasites' corrupting the Lithuanian nation. We have tried to hunt down the terrorist radio with poor results, but they cannot keep broadcasting their propaganda forever."
 LIT.261.a: "Give the green light to bust this travesty!"

 LIT.262.t: "Radio Station Canvassed"
 LIT.262.d: "The police have been able to storm one of the LAF hideouts sending out their radio propaganda. After a lengthy search, all information regarding the party has been collated and disseminated to several members of the government and the army. The pro-Voldemaras conspiracy seems deeper than initially thought. Multiple organisations, such as Antanas Maceina's Naujoji Romuva and the Ateitis, a Christian youth organisation with close ties to LKDP, have been compromised by the LAF. Several members are being removed from the Ateitis, though it appears corruption and immoralism of the LAF's influence run deeper than anyone could have thought."
 LIT.262.a: "They have chosen the wrong side."

 LIT.263.t: "Maceina's Cooperation Secured"
 LIT.263.d: "After surrendering himself to the local authorities, Antanas Maceina has been hastily escorted to a prison cell within Vilnius. To learn more about the LAF's leadership, movements, and locations, Maceina has been interrogated brutally by the Lithuanian Army. Despite Maceina's resistance, it appears that the harsh methods of the Lithuanian military bore fruit, as Maceina has finally broken down. He revealed that ever since his capture, his followers have now flocked to Voldemaras with what appears to be internal unrest among the leadership of the LAF. He has also revealed critical movements and hideouts of the LAF and has even exposed the location of Vytautas Alantas, his rival. Nonetheless, this has been a vital victory in the fight against the LAF as their leadership seems to be increasingly fragile. With their movements revealed, the military can finally go on the move. Maceina has pleaded for amnesty, arguing that he never believed the LAF would resort to violence and that he had been one of the most vocal inside the LAF against terrorism. Whether or not he is genuine will be up to the jury, but he will sit in his cold cell reflecting on his actions and decisions that have brought him here."
 LIT.263.a: "Good information, we'll catch them soon enough."

 LIT.264.t: "The Capture of Alantas"
 LIT.264.d: "The net has been tightening around Vytautas Alantas for quite some time now, and finally we have a good idea of his base of operations. A group of handpicked elite soldiers was sent to capture Alantas, either dead or alive, and found the supposed location to be a little homestead in a quiet part of the country. Storming the hamlet, they found Alantas in his home, but the celebration was cut short when Alantas informed the soldiers that he had effectively fallen out with Voldemaras. The party found themselves soon under attack by a small group of Voldemarininkai who their leader had sent to take out Alantas. The Voldemarininkai were no match for the disciplined and veteran volunteers and were soon routed. Alantas, highly fearful for his life, willingly surrendered to the Lithuanian Army and declared that he would cooperate and reveal anything the Lithuanian Army needed."
 LIT.264.a: "Time to finish the game."

 LIT.265.t: "An Iron Cage for an Iron Wolf"
 LIT.265.d: "The LAF leadership had been effectively dismantled, and its members lay primarily scattered in the wind. The information revealed from Maceina and Alantas revealed that the LAF had become frail due to internal conflicts in leadership that threatened to take the party apart. Even though Voldemaras was now the de facto leader of the LAF and stood unopposed, his central location deep in the Lithuanian forest had been revealed, and his forces were becoming increasingly thin and worn out. Reports from intelligence indicate that with Voldemaras' circle becoming progressively smaller, he was currently at his most vulnerable. With the approval of [GetSecondInCommand], the military has planned out an operation of handpicked volunteers who had no connections to the LAF. Finally, the time had come to rid Lithuania of this terrible nightmare and end the vile threat of the LAF once and for all."
 LIT.265.a: "Finally, we can end ourselves of these nuisances."

 LIT.266.t: "Voldemaras Laid Low"
 LIT.266.d: "Under cover of darkness, the elite Lithuanian infantry moved stealthily until they came upon the location disclosed by both Alantas and Maceina, a small compound deep in the Lithuanian forest. After quietly taking out the guards on patrol around the compound, the volunteers violently stormed open the building with automatic weapons, and the rattle of gunfire echoed throughout the forest, breaking the silence of the night. The LAF forces guarding Voldemaras fought back furiously to the bitter end, but many of them were wiped out, with those wounded immediately surrendering themselves to the Army. Finally, the firing stops, and the volunteers search the corpses for Voldemaras amidst the carnage and destruction of the skirmish. He is found dead, a bullet to the head, and while it is unclear whether or not he was shot in the firefight or took his own life, one thing is sure - the Iron Wolf of Lithuania has fallen."
 LIT.266.a: "The Wolf is dead..."

 LIT.267.t: "A Successful Raid"
 LIT.267.d: "Units of the Royal Lithuanian Army have successfully captured a LAF hideout after a brief but intense shootout. Sadly most of the terrorists managed to escape along with their stash of weapons, but the skirmish is celebrated as a victory nonetheless. One by one these terrorist hideouts are disappearing from the map, forcing the criminals to retreat further into the forests and small villages in the countryside, where they still have many loyalists."
 LIT.267.a: "Onwards!"

 LIT.268.t: "A Bloody Business"
 LIT.268.d: "The real victims of this bloody mess are the ones who are just attempting to provide for their families. For every person killed there is a family left to suffer. Despite the government's relief efforts and strongly-worded condemnation of their guerilla opponents, many are questioning the point of the entire conflict. Once again the news report of civilians caught in the crossfire or in LAF's bombing attack against the military. Many have pointed out that the harsh measures from the military have not helped much in eroding LAF's support base - quite the contrary, it seems like the spilling of blood simply fuels Voldemaras' words."
 LIT.268.a: "The terrorist cannot hide forever."

 LIT.269.t: "The Voldemarininkai Stronghold"
 LIT.269.d: "Today brings us a major victory, as our forces have captured a major LAF weapons stash. The well-hidden cellar was found after light 'coercion' of the local peasants, which gave us all the information to assault the hideout and capture most of the terrorist cell. With further investigation, the stash proved to be filled with Russian small arms and homemade explosives and even some light mortars. This should harm the LAF efforts in mounting further effective attacks against us."
 LIT.269.a: "Well done."

 LIT.270.t: "No Contact"
 LIT.270.d: "The forests have been quiet lately. LAF has been silent, no doubt gathering their strength as our forces have been tirelessly searching for their hideouts. The lull in violence has given the brave citizens of our kingdom a moment of relief amidst the insurgency."
 LIT.270.a: "It's quiet..."

 LIT.271.t: "The LAF rises"
 LIT.271.d: "Emboldened by their successful attack on King Vytautas, the Lithuanian Activist Front has declared the current government of [LIT.GetLeader] an illegitimate German puppet. Violence has started to grip the countryside, as the as-of-yet directionless Army and Police units can barely move out of their barracks.\n\nIt seems a violent struggle awaits Lithuania in the coming weeks and months."
 LIT.271.a: "This will be bloody."

 LIT.300.t: "Coup in Vilnius"
 LIT.300.d: "After weeks of preparations, the plan was put in motion. Dozens of LAF cells in Vilnius sprung up during the night, and with the support of conspiratorial, like-minded officers in the nearby garrison, they quickly took control of the bridges over river Neris and other key locations around the city. Some of the government's loyalists were disarmed after a brief firefight, while many others are still offering resistance from their holdouts across the city. In the chaos of the coup, bands of Voldemaras' men have started indiscriminate violence against all perceived traitors. Thousands of Poles, Jews and simply Lithuanians not willing to support the radicals have fled in panic, clogging the roads from Vilnius even worse. The fate of the capital hangs by a thread as the forces loyal to the government attempt to buy time for the reinforcements to rally."
 LIT.300.a: "The LAF is repulsed after a bloody struggle."
 LIT.300.b: "Vilnius falls to the rebels!"

 LIT.301.t: "Bialystok Secedes!"
 LIT.301.d: "Despite the success of the national restoration, it seems that the despicable Poles are working against our nation! We have received a report that the Polish assembly met and denounced our regime yesterday - most likely with support from Warsaw. Furthermore, they have stated that the Polish minority in Bialystok will not be safe under our authority, and they have taken it a step further by declaring their outright secession from our nation. Today, Polish soldiers have crossed the border and have announced that the city has 'rightfully' been restored to Poland. While we applaud the expulsion of the Poles from our homeland, the Polish state has stolen our lands - an act we will not forget."
 LIT.301.a: "Damn them!"

 LIT.302.t: "Valkaviskas Secedes!"
 LIT.302.d: "We have received treacherous news from Valkaviskas. It appears that the local Belarusian population in Valkaviskas has denounced our regime as illegitimate, citing that our policies will only threaten the lives of Belarusians. We have received word that the Belarusian community has voted for outright secession from Lithuania and expelled the local garrison by taking up arms. Furthermore, it appears that their actions have been supported directly by Minsk as [WHR.GetAdjective] soldiers have crossed into Lithuania, dismantling the border posts. The rebellious elements in Valkaviskas have immediately accepted annexation to the [WHR.GetAdjective] nation. While we welcome the expulsion of Belarusians from our lands, we will not stand for this outright theft of Lithuanian soil!"
 LIT.302.a: "We will strike back!"

 LIT.303.t: "Collapse of Lithuania"
 LIT.303.d: "The Kingdom of Lithuania has fallen, and the radical nationalist Lithuanian Activist Front has taken over the country in its wake. Led by a camarilla of national populist leaders, it has collapsed into chaos and disorder. There is no doubt that the lives of our fellow countrymen living on Lithuanian soil are at risk from the nationalist regime. If we do not step in and intervene - we will abandon our blood to the wolves.\n\nThe southern states within Lithuania, resisting the ongoing chaos in Lithuania, have overpowered the garrison in their region, with our forces occupying these areas. They gladly accept our protection and joyfully cheer on our soldiers as they march down the streets. Our lands have been reunited once more!"
 LIT.303.a: "Niech żyje Polska! Wiwat armia! Nasi przyszli!"
 LIT.303.b: "Vaŭkavysk, Radzima čakała ciabie!"

 LIT.305.t: "The Collapsing Trinity"
 LIT.305.d: "Voldemaras, Alantas and Maceina are three men unwilling to budge, even for their dear Lithuania. A certain sense of paranoia has hung over the ruling trio ever since they took the nation for themselves. Their supporters are possibly even more mistrustful of each other, having operated most of the insurgency in separate cells. Especially Maceina's 'Crypto-Bolsheviks' have drawn the ire of Voldemaras' Wolves, going as far as to open skirmishes during the Battle of Vilnius. Atlanta's group, being smaller than the Wolves but having perhaps even more radical thought, has been wary of Voldemaras' intentions of taking control of the national renewal, with fears that he will use his advantage to crush his so-called 'allies' before they can move on him - like any of the three would, if they could.\n\nUnder this backdrop of paranoia, the secret meeting between Alantas and Maceina has taken place in one of their hideouts in the outskirts of Vilnius: and the subject of the meeting is no other than high treason. Maceina's proposal is simple: two men must put aside their ideological differences and cut the wolf's head, lest they will lose theirs."
 LIT.305.a: "We'll work together, just to survive."
 LIT.305.b: "This is not the time for backstabbing..."

 LIT.306.t: "Fall of the Iron Wolves"
 LIT.306.d: "Augustinas Voldemaras, the de factor ruler of Lithuanian National State, was shot today. The actual events are left unclear - some blame a German assassin, while others are quick to point fingers at Voldemaras' so-called 'allies.' The loss of the man who turned the group of activists into a true, national revolution, is tremendous to the spirit of his followers, who have started a debate to find a worthy successor for the Iron Wolf. Despite cries to find a leader among themselves, even the idealists have to admit that two other men left of the LAF leadership, Vytautas Alantas and Antanas Maceina, are perhaps the only two people who can lead the existential battle.\n\nThe debate is bitter - Maceina believes in the eventual destruction of the bourgeoisie, the strength and renewal of the Lithuanian worker, and the end to social and economic injustice. To Maceina, capitalism is the very reason for Lithuania's moral and economic decay, and only through the Church and Lithuanian culture will Lithuania find its path once more. On the other hand, Alantas believes that Lithuania must return to its folk origins, to the days of the ancestors' gods and that the church is nothing more than foreign interference in the history and culture of Lithuania. Alantas believes that society must be heavily militarised, but his stance on economics is far more liberal than the radical distribution of wealth advocated by Maceina. Both men agree that Lithuanian society must be one for and run by Lithuanians only - but it seems that it's rapidly becoming the only thing they agree on.\n\nAfter hours of speeches and politicking, Alantas has finally snapped and denounced Maceina as nothing more than a socialist agent, turncloak who arranged the assassination of Voldemaras. Maceina's answer was equally harsh, describing Alantas as nothing more than a man with dictatorial ambitions who plans to destroy the Church in Lithuania. Both men offer compelling arguments to the remnants of the LAF, and whoever can swing more of the remnants to their side will no doubt be in control of the party."
 LIT.306.a: "The remnants back the Vairas!"
 LIT.306.b: "The remnants back Naujoji Romuva!"

 LIT.307.t: "Rise of the Iron Wolves"
 LIT.307.d: "Traitors, traitors, traitors! The words ring out in the meeting hall of the LAF as Voldemaras denounces his former 'ally', Antanas Maceina, over and over. He's been dragged to 'court' after a bloody battle between the Wolves and the men rabidly loyal to Maceina's treasonous cause. In the mock of a trial, it is revealed that Maceina was conspiring to murder the one, true leader of Lithuania - and these revelations come from none other than Alantas, who has shared his account of the shadowy negotiations of treason Maceina initiated. There was never any doubt of the verdict - the jury picked by Voldemaras has declared Maceina and his organisation enemies of the state, sentenced to death by firing squad. After the gunshots sent one of the three to meet his dear Maker, Voldemaras turns to his remaining co-ruler, Alantas, whose involvement in the conspiracy still seems shady to many. Voldemaras gives him a simple choice - to recognise Voldemaras as the sole and sovereign ruler of Lithuania like any loyal follower should, or face trial for his part in the so-called Maceina Affair. Practically at gunpoint, Alantas realises having been played into a corner and gives in - and thus Voldemaras has secured his position in one fell swoop, and the Iron Wolves are ready to serve their Tautos Vadas."
 LIT.307.a: "Traitors."

 LIT.310.t: "Meeting Antanas Merkys"
 LIT.310.d: "Running a country is not as easy as running the army, and now that the war on the LAF has wound down, civilians have been aching for a return to stability. The mayor of Kaunas, Antanas Merkys has offered his support to General Plechavičius in achieving this goal. A leader of questionable integrity, and strange financial dealings, he nonetheless has the governing experience the Army unquestionably lacks.\n\nWith his help, Plechavičius hopes that more men of a similar disposition will join his regime, creating an effective civilian bureaucracy."
 LIT.310.a: "Having him on our side will benefit everyone"

 LIT.311.t: "The Coronation of the King"
 LIT.311.d: "Lithuania appears to be going through Kings as a Turk goes through his cigarettes. With this being the third within the decade, the grandeur of such an event is all but lost on the people of Lithuania, especially in these dark times. Nonetheless, the government has moved heaven and earth to ensure that Eberhard receives a coronation akin to that of a Grand Duke. The streets heading towards Vilnius Cathedral were lined with Grand Duchy paraphernalia, and streets lined with people promised a free holiday in case they attended.\n\nAs the King publicly accepted the crown, and swore his oath to serve Lithuania, he turned to the stand and began his speech. Unlike his late brother, Eberhard, now coronated as Mindaugas III, gave his speech in Lithuanian, to then switch to Polish, and Yiddish with ease. He ended his speech in Belarusian, though it was apparent he still is attempting to learn the language. His speech overall was about Lithuania needing to step forward, together as a nation, and that the true threat is external, the true threat is Russia. This last comment led to a mighty roar, with the crowd chanting Mindaugas name. Plechavičius was seen smiling whilst smoking his pipe, and was heard saying..."
 LIT.311.a: "He isn't like his brother at all... The bastard has balls."

 LIT.312.t: "The Threat to the East"
 LIT.312.d: "[LIT.GetLeader] has given a rallying speech regarding the true threat to Lithuania, and that being the Russian menace. According to him, independent from one's mother tongue, being Lithuanian unites the country, and the Russians threaten the existence of every citizen, meaning that all must be done to combat this threat. The speech has been met with approval from both the Army, and the cooperating part of the civilian bureaucracy.\n\nWith this rallying call it appears that like his brother, the people have given him a title. For Vytautas, it was the Architect King, but for Mindaugas, it is the Warrior King."
 LIT.312.a: "The man proves to be bolder by the day."

 LIT.313.t: "A New Constitution"
 LIT.313.d: "The ruling coalition has proposed a new constitution for Lithuania, which is supposed to finalise the stabilisation of the country.\n\nThe proposed new constitution will introduce sweeping powers for the legislature, expand the role of the King in government, and cut back on the various personal freedoms the old one provided. The few willing detractors are claiming that this is a full-blown takeover of Lithuanian institutions by cliques loyal to Plechavičius and the King, but official government propaganda has pushed back against this narrative heavily.\n\nAs in keeping with democratic traditions, the government has organised a week-long plebiscite during which the whole adult population of Lithuania can accept or reject the new constitution by open ballot."
 LIT.313.a: "No, a secret ballot is not necessary for democracy."

 LIT.314.t: "Accusations of Impropriety"
 LIT.314.d: "While according to the government the vote is going without a hitch, independent foreign media is claiming otherwise, mostly blaming the open ballot and the heavy-handedness of the police.\n\nOne [AUS.GetAdjectiveCap] newspaper described the events reminiscent of the famously undemocratic Hungarian elections in the XIXth century, with intimidation of voters, vote rigging, and beatings by the gendarmerie of those who do not support the governments initiative.\n\nSuch condemnation has not been drawn from other countries, with the most important ally of Lithuania, [LIT.overlord.GetAdjectiveCap] foreign office staying silent on the matter."
 LIT.314.a: "Sounds like sedition"

 LIT.315.t: "The Results"
 LIT.315.d: "After a week of frantic voting, several heavily injured opposition activists, the results of the Lithuanian constitutional referendum are in. All of Lithuania awaits the results with bated breath."
 LIT.315.a: "The referendum passes even with 44.11%"
 LIT.315.b: "The referendum passes with 103.5%"

 LIT.316.t: "A New Kingdom"
 LIT.316.d: "As the dust from the plebiscite settles, and the wounds of the surviving opposition slowly start to heal, a new sun rises over Lithuania.\n\nThe country has now changed undeniably, and the cliques around Plečhavicius and the King have asserted their power for the long term. How they will transform Lithuania is still an open question."
 LIT.316.a: "Stability comes at a price"

 LIT.317.t: "Fighting Together"
 LIT.317.d: "Soldiers of various ethnicities in Lithuania have fought together against the terrorists of the Lithuanian Activist front. Seeing action together against the enemies of the nation, many of the prevailing ethnic stereotypes have been proven false, and men can claim to actually know Lithuanians of other ethnicity.\n\nWith this, the number of reported racist incidents in the Army is slowly falling, and understanding is slowly taking its place, even if there is a long way to go."
 LIT.317.a: "A trial by fire unites a people."

 LIT.318.t: "The Final Blow"
 LIT.318.d: "Weeks of intense police and military action have finally brought the LAF to an end. A raid on a safehouse in the northern countryside has resulted in the death of Voldemaras while the other leaders of the movement have gone to ground.\n\nWith the destruction of its military arm, the LAF can now be considered to be nothing but an ugly stain on Lithuanian history."
 LIT.318.a: "Seems like they are going out with a whimper."

 LIT.319.t: "A New Art Installation"
 LIT.319.d: "On the suggestion of Kreve-Mickevicius the National Gallery of Lithuania is sponsoring a new installation on patriotic paintings meant to commemorate the efforts made for the liberation of Lithuania in the Weltkrieg.\n\nWhile some on the nationalist side of our government have argued that the blatant support of Germany is unhealthy for the soul of Lithuania, these arguments ring just as hollow as the socialists' accusations of it being pro-war propaganda."
 LIT.319.a: "All art is propaganda"

 LIT.330.t: "The Bundas Demands Action"
 LIT.330.d: "In the LAF's campaign against all groups they deem traitors to Lithuania, few have received as much ire as the Jewish population. With most LAF members subscribing to rabidly anti-Semitic views, cells have taken to destroying Jewish businesses and committing horrible acts of violence in Jewish quarters across the nation. These attacks have become more frequent and more daring in recent days, as our critically-stretched police force struggles to prevent attacks even in towns and cities where Jews are the largest ethnic group.\n\nOur inability to protect the Jewish population has left the Jewish Labour Bund deeply furious - as a precondition for their support of Narutowicz's government, Shlomo Kleit and the rest of the Bundas leadership have demanded that something be done to address the terror against Lithuania's Jews. Narutowicz has agreed that the current situation cannot stand, and has spent a long night attempting to reach an agreement on a solution. The most obvious and direct answer to the problem is to further expand the nation's constabularies, hopefully providing them with the shot in the arm needed to hamstring the LAF's ability to target Jewish communities. However, some radical Bundas members aren't content with this solution - they complain that the constabularies, even with extra support, are in practice only able to react with various amounts of delay to LAF attacks, and in some cases may be prone to anti-Semitic thinking themselves. Their alternative proposal is to allow Jewish communities to form their own police forces, which they argue will be more responsive and effective at keeping these communities safe.\n\nThis counteroffer is highly controversial for several reasons - not least because it places these Jewish police units as a parallel entity to the government and largely outside its control, and may be interpreted as a concession on the part of the government that it can't protect all of its citizens, regardless of how true that may or may not be. However, while many of the police insist that the extra resources will be enough to get a handle on LAF activity, some admit that structural inefficiencies are limiting their effectiveness and that throwing more money at the problem will only go so far. Either way, the support of the Bundas is crucial - and so, a decision must be made."
 LIT.330.a: "Expand the constabularies. Lithuania must protect her own."
 LIT.330.b: "Approve these Jewish units - as long as it's temporary."

 LIT.331.t: "Polish Irredentism"
 LIT.331.d: "The Polish nationalist Marian Zyndram-Kościałkowski has been rallying Poles in Białystok to secede from Lithuania. A former member of the Union of Active Struggle, a Polish independence organisation - Kościałkowski has been using the LAF as the reason to rebel against Narutowicz's vision of a new Lithuania, stating it's immoral and corrupt for the government to allow such atrocities against the Poles to take place. Declaring that Białystok is not Lithuanian but Polish, he has attracted a lot of support within Białystok, with many of the town's inhabitants openly expressing their support."
 LIT.331.a: "Damn that man"

 LIT.332.t: "Plechavičius Dispatched"
 LIT.332.d: "In the hopes of rallying more Poles to his cause, it seems that Zyndram-Kościałkowski was unable to secure the Jews of Białystok, who are unwilling to join in the violence. Nonetheless, he has secured arms and several buildings within Białystok, turning the town into a centre of a rebellion. Despite having orders to deal with the LAF, Plechavičius and his troops have been ordered to secure the city and crush the local resistance - though this hampers their efforts to destroy the LAF."
 LIT.332.a: "This could get ugly"

 LIT.333.t: "Big Trouble in Little Białystok... Again"
 LIT.333.d: "Arriving in Białystok, Plechavičius sends a message to the barricades demanding Zyndram-Kościałkowski to surrender. The message is met with nothing but scorns and insults - the Polish rebels will not surrender and are willing to fight to the last. Angered by this, Plechavičius orders his troops to march on the city against the wishes of Narutowicz. After a day of skirmishing in and around the city of Białystok, neither side has gained a particular advantage - much to the frustration of Plechavičius. However, the incident has attracted more than utter annoyance and frustration in Vilnius, with Narutowicz relieving Plechavičius of his duty and replacing him with Żeligowski. Bitter and resentful, the conservative general Plechavičius demands that Zyndram-Kościałkowski come out from his street defences to settle matters of honour through a duel. There is no response, and Plechavičius takes this as a moral victory."
 LIT.333.a: "Żeligowski will do a better job for sure."

 LIT.334.t: "The Knight of Białystok"
 LIT.334.d: "Given their shared Polish heritage, Zyndram-Kościałkowski sends a negotiation message to the Lithuanian forces led by Żeligowski outside of Białystok. The offer is promptly denied by Żeligowski and Lithuanian troops preparing to storm the city when the LAF seizing the chance to attack both forces approach the town. Żeligowski sends a quick message of truce to Zyndram-Kościałkowski, who is more than happy to work together to defeat the LAF. The Lithuanian Army and the Polish rebels succeed in driving out the LAF, who cannot deal with both sides' combined firepower and numbers. Thankful for their assistance, Żeligowski allows the forces of Zyndram-Kościałkowski to leave the city but not before the two men share a respectful Polish salute with one another. In turn, the people of Białystok are grateful for the peaceful conclusion of the conflict and soon begin to call Żeligowski the "Knight of Białystok" - seeing him as a hero that saved the city from ruin."
 LIT.334.a: "He let him go... Eina šikt!"

 LIT.335.t: "Order Restored in Białystok"
 LIT.335.d: "Peace and order have finally returned to the streets of Białystok. The citizens emerge from their hiding places, and cellars — the street barricades constructed by Zyndram-Kościałkowski have been torn down. Despite the shared bloodshed against the LAF, Zyndram-Kościałkowski has still been branded as a rebel in Vilnius and remains on the run. As for Żeligowski, it appears that he is indeed fully committed to Narutowicz's version of a new Lithuania, one of shared ethnic unity. Some of the citizens of Białystok have even declared that they identify as "Litewski-Polski" - Polish by ethnicity, but Lithuanian by nationality. Jews, Poles, and Lithuanians are all unified together to stand against the hateful ideas of the LAF. This is something that Narutowicz is truly hopeful for, and the cessation of tensions in Białystok seems to reinforce the idea that perhaps ethnic unity could be possible."
 LIT.335.a: "First step towards something great."

 LIT.336.t: "The Devil You Know"
 LIT.336.d: "Narutowicz with his guard meet Plechavičius at the very building where Narutowicz and 19 other members of the Council of Lithuania signed the "Act of Independence of Lithuania". The building itself once a Russian drama theatre, is now abandoned, with its German owners long having left the city, along with their hopes of turning the building into a place of German culture.\n\nPlechavičius instructs the guard to remain as he and Narutowicz enter the building, with Plechavičius removing his holstered side arm and throwing it at the feet of Narutowicz's nearest guardsmen. Narutowicz raised his hand before any further protest could be made and followed Plechavičius into the building, to eventually be led to the very room where the act was signed.\n\nTo his bemusement and relief, sitting in the room is Antanas Smetona, who invited him to sit in the chair next to him. Smetona is quick to the point, he stated he openly detested Narutowicz's perversion of his new "Lithuanian" culture and states he will never support such a notion. He went on to state though this may be his views, he also cannot tolerate the LAF and their "unholy" views they hold and in short, sees them as the greater devil. Smetona proposed that with his contacts in the LAF, he can persuade several important members and their men to leave the LAF with the condition of amnesty given.\n\nNarutowicz firstly scoffed at this notion, stating Smetona has no real power here, and furthermore, what guarantees could he offer Narutowicz that he like the LAF, won't attempt to lead a coup against his government? Smetona grinned and as if by command, several members of the LAF forces entered the room, with Plechavičius drawing his concealed sabre, staring right at Smetona with a look of betrayal on his face. Smetona raised his hand at Plechavičius and stated, “These men have wished to surrender themselves to you Narutowicz, though of course I promised them amnesty and I hope you will allow me to hold my word to these men and others that will follow". Upon hearing this, Plechavičius broke out into a laugh, sheathing his sabre and slapped Narutowicz on the back, stating Smetona, the old fox still has it. Smetona stated his only request for assisting Narutowicz is that he be allowed to reform the LTS and be allowed back into the Seimas. Narutowicz thought about this deal long and hard, but internalising that Smetona had said earlier regarding “the lesser devil”. Narutowicz agreed to Smetona's terms and struck a deal with him."
 LIT.336.a: "... though only God knows what that man truly wants."

 LIT.337.t: "Smetona Readjusting"
 LIT.337.d: "It seems that Smetona has been slowly "readjusting" to the new Seimas, with him approving of the new improvements made by Narutowicz to its running.\n\nDuring his opening speech to the Seimas, Smetona has openly declared that his party detest and denounces the actions taken by the LAF, calling them traitors to the Lithuanian people and spineless cowards, for attacking those who can not defend themselves. He further stated the antisemitic views of the LAF are completely unfounded, with the Litvaks proving themselves to be the most willing to embrace what it means to be "Lithuanian". He went on to further state that there is still a chance of redemption for these members and all they have to do is surrender themselves, making promising that no harm will befall them or their loved ones.\n\nIn his closing statement, he stated in veiled words his "dislike" of Narutowicz's ideals and "revisionism" of Lithuanian culture, but also that the Seimas is the only battleground that he and his supporters will fight on. His speech was met with polite applause, though it was evident that Smetona's message wasn't for the Seimas, but for those listening elsewhere in the country.\n\nAfter Smetona's speech, Narutowicz took the floor and thanked Smetona for his "support" and proceeded to bring up the agendas of the day"
 LIT.337.a: "That man is insufferable."

 LIT.338.t: "Narutowicz Announces His Ambitions"
 LIT.338.d: "Upon the opening of the Seimas, Narutowicz has announced his ambitions to combine his socialist democratic ideals with a blending of Krajowcy ideals through a series of reforms and projects. These ambitions seem to be a catered compromise between both the LSDP and the LKDP regarding how Lithuania is administered and the direction of the economy.\n\nThis announcement has caused discontent in the old guard of the LKDP and more radical members of the LSDP, but their voices have been drowned out by the majority in each of their respective parties, who wish to set Lithuania back on track and see the greater menace on the horizon. Narutowicz still appears to have other projects in the works, but has kept them close to his chest for now. For now, Narutowicz has steered the proverbial ship that is Lithuania onto a new course, and it is to be seen if he will steer to port or scuttle on the shore."
 LIT.338.a: "Narutowicz is the captian now."

 LIT.339.t: "Creating a Switzerland of the East"
 LIT.339.d: "After long discussions with the great minds of Stasys Šalkauskis and Steponas Kairys, and drawing inspiration from multi-ethnic states such as Switzerland and [BEL.Getname], Narutowicz states that rather than embracing this new phenomenon of 'nationalism', he wishes to promote the Krajovcai, the idea of 'Lithuanianism', which draws its identity from the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.\n\nWith this, he is moving to establish several counties - 'apskritys/powiaty' - within the Kingdom, though it appears these are just based on the Kingdom's old administration areas, which themselves are broken down by ethnicity. Not all agree with this model of governance."
 LIT.339.a: "Narutowicz has some work cut out for him."

 LIT.340.t: "Status of LAF Former Members"
 LIT.340.d: "With the assistance of Smetona, Narutowicz was able to avoid a prolonged civil war between the LAF forces and those loyal to the government by allowing a level of pardon to now former members of LAF. It appears now that a small contingent of former members wish to resume their former military roles within the newly formed Lithuanian Army and have petitioned to do so through the Seimas. This has been met with a mixed reaction with some wishing to allow these men a chance to reform themselves, whilst others do not wish for the newly founded well to be poisoned by their presence."
 LIT.340.a: "Some can serve, others have lost our trust."
 LIT.340.b: "They can show their newfound loyalty within the vanguard units."

 LIT.341.t: "Bundas Backed Schools"
 LIT.341.d: "An agreement between the LKDP and the Bundas was made regarding the allowance of gymnasiums to have a Jewish curriculum, though no formal agreement was made regarding the funding. Though Narutowicz does support the subsidisation of these Jewish gymnasiums, it appears the LKDP have the final say on the matter, with the old guard still attempting to make its presence known by arguing that the Bundas like those who wish to attend a secular school, must support the gymnasiums by their own means."
 LIT.341.a: "No, we shall support our Litvak brethren."

 LIT.342.t: "Great Compromise"
 LIT.342.d: "Finally, after endless heated discussions and debates, a compromise is indeed reached. For days, Narutowicz has been working with Santara to receive their aid for his federalisation project. And while the compromise took a while to achieve, it would appear that indeed a deal is made. Narutowicz has promised to appoint those who support him to small government positions in exchange for their support. For a small party such as Santara, this is an offer that is indeed quite tempting. They have agreed willingly, and Narutowicz, with his newfound support, can move forward with his ambitious federalisation."
 LIT.342.a: "First step towards a new Lithuania."

 LIT.343.t: "An Old Thorn"
 LIT.343.d: "Stanisław Narutowicz has long been an influential figure in Lithuanian politics; indeed, many consider him one of the founding fathers of the modern Lithuanian state. A self-declared Samogitian, Lithuanian, and Pole, Narutowicz aims for an ethnically unified Lithuanian nation where Poles would be able to champion their own language and culture, all the while identifying as "Lithuanian." Given his influence in Lithuanian politics as well as his Polish identity, Narutowicz has long served as head of the KPL/LLK since the early 1920s. However, with the rise of ethnic tensions surfacing in Lithuania once again, the right wing of the KPL and the LLK has seen a rise in popularity. Led by Marian Zyndram-Kościałkowski, the right wing of the KPL/LLK has grown more aggressive in recent days - receiving support from the Polish minority in Białystok and nationalists in [POL.getname]. A constant thorn in the side of Narutowicz's ambition, Narutowicz wishes to find out the true extent of the right wing's goals. With his approval, an operation is set up to infiltrate the right wing and seek out their true intentions."
 LIT.343.a: "Interesting."

 LIT.344.t: "Infiltration Successful"
 LIT.344.d: "Receiving special approval from Narutowicz, a Polish-Lithuanian spy managed to join the right wing and even became in close contact with some of Zyndram-Kościałkowsk's inner circle. The plot has been uncovered - Zyndram-Kościałkowsk has been crossing the border constantly with Poland, receiving arms and support from extremists. The movement aims for the restoration of Białystok into Poland, and while there is a minority that truly yearns for this - Narutowicz will not allow outright secession. The act of Zyndram-Kościałkowsk is akin to that of outright rebellion, and with this intel, Narutowicz must be prepared to make his move."
 LIT.344.a: "Wait where has Plechavičius gone?"

 LIT.345.t: "The Hunt for Zyndram-Kościałkowski"
 LIT.345.d: "With Zyndram-Kościałkowski's location located and disclosed to the army, Plechavičius (after losing his usual temperament) has a lead cohort of soldiers he trusts in an attempt to locate the rebel. Small skirmishes have erupted on the Polish-Lithuanian border as Zyndram-Kościałkowski and Plechavičius have begun their own little private war. Response from the government still remains muted, if not angered at Plechavičius' hasty decision."
 LIT.345.a: "Damn that man!"

 LIT.346.t: "The Battle of Białystok Rages On"
 LIT.346.d: "Plechavičius forces begin to obtain the upper hand over Zyndram-Kościałkowski, and his men. Though outraged by Plechavičius thinking he can play "warlord" in Lithuania, Narutowicz's has sent Żeligowski to relief Plechavičius of his command, and to face censure in Vilnius. There is a brief stand-off between the two ex-Imperial Russian generals, with Plechavičius and his cohort leaving unceremoniously, last seen heading towards Šiauliai."
 LIT.346.a: "Jasna cholera!!!"

 LIT.347.t: "Order Restored"
 LIT.347.d: "Żeligowski proves his loyalty to Narutowicz, despite Zyndram-Kościałkowski attempts at subversion. Wishing to avoid bloodshed, Żeligowski utilises the Antrasis Departamentas, a newly formed intelligence agency, to find and locate Zyndram-Kościałkowski. Several agents are tasked to stage a drop-off of weapons to Zyndram-Kościałkowski and his men. While it didn't turn out to be a bloodless affair, it did end with Zyndram-Kościałkowski's capture. Now with the snake's head cut off, the body shall wither and die, with Białystok secured. Though Plechavičius brooding in the north presents further problems."
 LIT.347.a: "Out of the frying pan..."

 LIT.348.t: "Question of Succession"
 LIT.348.d: "The King of Lithuania has died without any sons or daughters. While he has two younger brothers, who could inherit the throne, they are not prepared to lead the country.\n\nWith none of the major parties in Lithuania actively advocating for a quick succession, and the populace having grown weary of having a new monarch, the government is presented with a unique opportunity to declare a Republic.\n\n[LIT.GetLeader] is a clever politician, and knows that a serious amount of political capital will be necessary to convince [GER.GetNameDef] to agree."
 LIT.348.a: "Will the Germans complain?"

 LIT.349.t: "Lithuanian Lobbying"
 LIT.349.d: "Envoys from [FROM.GetNameDef] have approached us regarding the succession in their Country. While they had originally a German monarch, his death at the hands of terrorists from the Lithuanian Activist Front has left the country led by a temporary regency under [FROM.GetLeader].\n\nWith support for the monarchy dropping, and republicanism on the rise, they have come to ask if they could declare a Republic. While no longer headed by a German monarch, this new state of affairs wouldn't mean any change in the relationship between [GER.GetNameDef] and the new Republic of Lithuania."
 LIT.349.a: "We should not be bothered by such trivial matters."

 LIT.350.t: "The German Reply"
 LIT.350.d: "To the astonishment of all major actors in Lithuanian politics, [FROM.GetNameDef] has actually agreed to allow the transformation of Lithuania into a republic.\n\nAs of now, [ROOT.GetLeader] will stay in power as president, with the Asis continuing to lead Lithuania for the moment."
 LIT.350.a: "Well, time to put the crown in a museum."

 LIT.351.t: "An Astonishing Session within the Seimas"
 LIT.351.d: "In an astonishing speech to the Seimas, Narutowicz has announced his retirement, shocking all in attendance. Having secured stability, and a republic for Lithuania, he has decided to step down, from his post as regent.\n\nThe new head of state will be a president, who is to be elected by the Seimas after new elections in a month."
 LIT.351.a: "Who could fill these shoes?"

 LIT.352.t: "New parties Forming."
 LIT.352.d: "With the Asis coalition formally disbanded, as new elections are to be held in a month, the Lithuanian political scene is in turmoil. Alliances are formed and disbanded day by day, providing daily entertainment to those who read the newspapers, and mass confusion to those who do not do so regularly."
 LIT.352.a: "I love democracy."

 LIT.353.d: "As the new parties and alliances shape up politics, the first elections of the new Lithuanian Republic are held. The voters have headed to the polls, and now the country awaits results with bated breath.\n\nBoth traditional parties have a chance of winning, but as a dark horse, the liberal Santara party has been strengthened by reorganisation of politics, and many see them as a successor to the policies of Narutowicz."

 LITFLA.1.t: "Gardinas' Language Shift"
 LITFLA.1.d: "Gardinas (Hrodna in Belarusian) has gone a language shift of sorts with the local population adopting Lithuanian over Belarusian. The trend seems to have originated with the Lithuanian Jews themselves adopting Lithuanian over Russian or Belarusian, who make up the majority of the city's population and like many other cities within Lithuania, holding the lion's share of business due to practices of the Bundas. This has resulted in the locals having to use Lithuanian when dealing with the Lithuanian Jews, with most now only speaking Belarusian as a home language. Furthermore, many have begun to view themselves as 'Litvins', an archaic Slavic term for citizens from the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. This phenomenon seems to be only localised in Gardinas, with the residents of Valkaviskas seeing their northern cousins as 'eccentric' at best, and speak insults best not repeated."
 LITFLA.1.a: "Finally they speak Lithuanian."

 LITFLA.2.t: "Valkaviskas - the Howling of Wolves"
 LITFLA.2.d: "Valkaviskas, the largest southern city within the Kingdom of Lithuania is unique for several reasons. One of those is the city is divided amongst Belarusians, Jews and Poles with each going by their day-to-day business. Unlike the Lithuanian Jews in the Gardinas, the Jews of Valkaviskas are Polish speaking and do not have any affiliation with the Bundas. The economy of the city is mainly based on the production of machinery, though mainly due to the politicking of the city, this area is sorely in need of investment. No real nationalist movements have taken place in the city, though many of the Belarusian population, unlike their northern 'eccentric' cousins look to Minsk for cultural guidance over Vilnius."
 LITFLA.2.a: "Machinery... interesting... I think"

 LITFLA.3.t: "Naujoji Vilnia By-Elections"
 LITFLA.3.d: "A few days ago, Danielius Alseika, the Santara deputy to the Seimas of the Kingdom of Lithuania, has passed away, leaving only a single underage daughter Marija. According to the electoral law, by-elections have to be held in his constituency - Naujoji Vilnia, also known as Novovilejsk. It is a distant eastern suburb of our capital, Vilnius, inhabited almost completely by Polish and Russian minorities. Traditionally, even the Committee of Lithuanian Poles has hesitated to challenge Alseika in his constituency, as the humble, soft-spoken doctor was beloved by people of all ethnicity in the suburb. With his passing, however, it has enthusiastically put forward Jan Piłsudski, brother of the famous hero of the Polish people in the Weltkrieg, as their candidate. Unsurprisingly, he is supported by an absolute majority of the Polish-speaking population, while the Lithuanian parties in the Seimas fear the lockdown of yet another safe KPL constituency.\n\nA plan has been proposed in the headquarters of the Christian Democratic Party to prevent this fate from befalling the Naujoji Vilnia constituency. While it should not be allowed to redraw constituency borders so close to the date of the election, it is not 'illegal' per se, and the idea is to carefully carve out new borders for the constituency, including non-Polish neighbourhoods in the constituency to balance out the Polish vote. At the same time, a smear campaign will make sure that the Belarusians, Russians and Lithuanians do not cast a single vote for Piłsudski, which should ensure a victory for the Christian Democratic candidate, Antanas Šmulkštys. This will definitely not be a popular move - but yet another Polish parliamentarian will make that minority even more unruly..."

 LITFLA.4.t: "Goose Crisis"
 LITFLA.4.d: "The ongoing economic crisis has hit few Lithuanian industries harder than the poultry industry. According to calculations in 1934, Lithuania exported up to three hundred thousand geese to Germany per year - and now these exports have ground to a halt. Faced with the threat of a complete collapse of the Lithuanian poultry industry, the so-called 'goose crisis', the government has chosen to enact an emergency solution. For the following year, all government officials, bureaucrats and pensioners are required by law to purchase a specified amount of geese, depending on one's ranking within the bureaucratic apparatus and wage, at a minimum of one. As proof of goose transaction, all farmers selling these birds have been required to sell them with numbered cards, which would then be turned in to the government by the person purchasing geese.\n\nAlthough certainly an unorthodox way to solve the economic ills of the country, it has actually paid off somewhat. Magazines and newspapers are getting full of new goose recipes for the unfortunate bureaucrats."
 LITFLA.4.a: "I don't even like geese..."

 LITFLA.5.t: "The Credo of Adomas Jakštas"
 LITFLA.5.d: "Stasys Šalkauskis and the Christian Democrats coming to power under his leadership has pushed Vilnius book publishers to re-release the works of Adomas Jakštas. One of the most famous and influential leaders of the Lithuanian National Revival, he was also the grandfather of Christian ideology in Lithuanian politics, and Stasys Šalkauskis was one of his students - in fact, many of the ideas which Šalkauskis calls his own, such as the belief in eventual unity of the world under Christian ethics, as well as democratic corporatist economic ideas, come from Jakštas's writings.\n\nIn his 'Credo', Adomas Jakštas detailed the tenets of his ideology. He believed rational science, metaphysics and Christian ideology to all stem from the same source, the divine Logos, and thus a good Christian should seek a unity of theological, philosophical and scientific knowledge. This drive for unity should reflect itself in society - Jakštas advocated for amending the Schism and restoring a single, universal Christian church, he believed that class warfare should be replaced by class cooperation, driven by Christian ethics, and he was the first in Lithuania to introduce the idea of the United States of Europe, which his home country Lithuania should champion and join. He was an internationalist - he believed that 'open-minded and open-hearted people' who would support these ideas exist in every country, repressed by the ignorance of the masses, and should they join a single worldwide organisation, they would be able to guide the world towards the absolute Truth and absolute Good.\n\nPerhaps because of this reason, Jakštas has had a deep interest in Esperanto ever since its creation, and chaired the Esperanto Federation of Lithuania until his death, believing it to be an important step towards his internationalist ideals."
 LITFLA.5.a: "I will cover the eight directions under one roof, and make Vilnius their abode..."

 LITFLA.6.t: "The Lithuanian Temperance Movement"
 LITFLA.6.d: "The Lithuanian nationalist revival in the second half of the 19th century is indistinguishable from its native temperance movement. Started by Bishop Motiejus Valančius in 1858, it grew to encompass the majority of Lithuania's peasant population within only a few years, before it was cracked down on by Tsarist Russian authorities. It is widely considered to be a seminal event in the growth of the Lithuanian National Revival, as it was started with nationalist intentions in mind - to improve the economy and people of the country, to promote Catholic ideals, and to stand against a prevailing Tsarist policy to turn a blind eye towards alcoholism, in order to keep the populace intoxicated and thus easy to control.\n\nThe priesthood of Kaunas refounded the temperance movement in 1908, in the form of the Lithuanian Catholic Temperance Brotherhood. Since then, it has been an important mass movement and pressure group in Lithuanian politics, uniting over sixty thousand members as well as maintaining close alliances with other Lithuanian religious organisations. An idea has been raised to promote this Brotherhood further and use it as a tool to indoctrinate the populace with Christian ethics and beliefs, temperance being one of them."

 LITFLA.7.t: "Litvins, Tutejszy and Others"
 LITFLA.7.d: "The long and extremely complicated history of the region which now forms the Kingdom of Lithuania makes it a complete and utter nightmare for those familiar with rigid, separate nationalities. Years of numerous ethnicities living under the same Grand Duchy, and the memory of this construct lasting long after 1795, have formed various mixed, hard-to-classify groups within our territory.\n\nThough the Lithuanians are a Baltic people, that does not mean that all who declare themselves to be Lithuanian speak the language. Centuries of cultural proximity and unity under a single nation have left many Belarusian-speaking peoples, especially aristocrats and intellectuals, identifying with Lithuania as their homeland, seeing it not as a nation-state, but as a multicultural union of various nations, cultures and languages. These people are known as Litvins.\n\nMany people in the Vilnius region, especially the poorest peasantry and proletarians, do not define themselves with any specific nation at all. Living in such a hub of numerous languages and cultures, they do not consider themselves to be a part of anyone, speak a mix of Belarusian, Lithuanian and Polish lingo known as 'mowa prosta' and are known as Tutejszy, or 'locals', as they would declare their nationality to be in census data.\n\nFor the longest time, Lithuanian censuses have defined peoples by their native language and avoided the nationality question entirely for this specific reason, but because of internal pressure to start including nationality in census data, we will have to decide on how we wish to treat Litvins, Tutejszy and other difficult ethnic groups."

 LITFLA.8.t: "The Memory of Vincas Kudirka"
 LITFLA.8.d: "1938 marks the eighty-year anniversary of the birth of Vincas Kudirka, one of the champions of the Lithuanian National Revival and editor of the newspaper 'Varpas' ('The Bell'), one of the two first newspapers printed and published in the Lithuanian language. During his forty years of life, Kudirka accomplished much in the name of the Lithuanian nation, most notably writing the hymn 'Tautiška giesmė', which has since become the national anthem of Lithuania. Unlike his fellow patriarch of the National Revival, Jonas Basanavičius, Vincas Kudirka had a much more defined political programme. He believed that patriotism alone would not be able to revive the Lithuanian nation, thus it was the duty of their generation to educate the Lithuanian peasantry, improve their lives and fight in the name of social justice. Though he passed away in 1899, before the independence of Lithuania could be established, his thought has had a profound impact on Lithuania since. It is said that Vincas Mickevičius-Kapsukas, a famous leader of Lithuanian radical socialists, chose his alias in honour of Kudirka - Kudirka's pen name was 'Kapsas', while Mickevičius was only 'Kapsukas', meaning 'little Kapsas'. On the other side of the political spectrum, right-wing Lithuanian nationalists also claim his memory for themselves, they note his stance against Polonisation and nationalist outlook.\n\nIn honour of this anniversary, a statue for Vincas Kudirka, designed by the sculptor Vincas Grybas, is planned to be erected in Vilnius. At the same time, we are able to push through our own version of Kudirka. By downplaying some facts about his life and exalting others, we can shape historical memory into a political weapon. What should future generations remember him as?"
 LITFLA.8.a: "A champion of the ethnic Lithuanian nationalist cause!"
 LITFLA.8.b: "A true progressive, the founding father of social democracy."
 LITFLA.8.c: "Was he not the man whom even Syndicalists admire?"

 LITFLA.9.t: "The Memory of the January Uprising"
 LITFLA.9.d: "1938 marks the one hundred and ten year anniversary of the birth of Antanas Mackevičius, a Lithuanian priest and one of the leaders of the Lithuanian rebels in the January Uprising of 1863. Though traditionally seen as a Polish uprising against Tsarist rule, it gained significant traction in Lithuania as well, where it coincided with peasant unrest over an unsatisfactory abolition of serfdom. It is considered to be a turning point in Lithuanian history - while the uprising in Lithuania still hoped to join Poland in a federation, the Lithuanian National Revival which sparked in the years after finally disjoined Lithuanian national identity from that of Poland, and turned these nations from comrades into enemies. Antanas Mackevičius and other Lithuanian members of the January Uprising, while still supporters of a Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, had a far more concise national identity than their brethren in the decades beforehand. At the same time, the uprising fought for social justice, the rights of the peasantry, and other radical ideas, which made it an inspiration for the Lithuanian socialist movement in the years after.\n\nIn an independent Lithuania, the November and January Uprisings are most commemorated by Polish Lithuanians, as a means of expressing the centuries-long connection between the Polish and Lithuanian nations. Now, they seek to fund a memorial in Krekenava, which, alongside Mackevičius, would also commemorate other leaders of the uprising in Lithuania, such as Zigmantas Sierakauskas and Konstantinas Kalinauskas. We are able to turn this memorial into a political message. What should future generations remember about the January Uprising?"
 LITFLA.9.a: "Prevent the memorial from being raised, it honours Polonised traitors."
 LITFLA.9.b: "Let us not forget that Mackevičius was a devout Catholic."
 LITFLA.9.c: "Mackevičius was the first Lithuanian revolutionary socialist!"

 LITFLA.10.t: "The Memory of the Constitution of May 3rd"
 LITFLA.10.d: "May 3rd, the date when the Constitution of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth was signed and declared in 1791, is one of the most important dates in Polish history - and ever since the foundation of an independent Lithuania, there has been pressure from the Polish Lithuanian community to list it as a commemorated day here as well. It was the first Constitution published in the Old World, and while it only lasted in effect for less than a year, it has had a profound impact on the political thought in the region, being the culmination of Enlightenment thought in Poland-Lithuania. However, while it is unquestionably important in Polish historical memory, it does not hold the same respect among Lithuanians. After all, it was the same Constitution that sought to abolish the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and establish the unitary Kingdom of Poland in its wake - and while this was prevented with the Reciprocal Guarantee of the Two Nations a few months after, it does not change the fact that this Constitution is seen as something 'foreign', rather than something 'Lithuanian' as much as it is 'Polish'.\n\nRegardless, the pressure to recognise May 3rd as a commemorated date remains. Should we cave in to the pressure, or maintain the line of thought that this is not a date Lithuania should commemorate?"
 LITFLA.10.a: "This date is a memory of a beautiful union once lost..."
 LITFLA.10.b: "It is an event memorable for Poles. Not Lithuanians."

 LITFLA.11.t: "The death of Silvestras Žukauskas"
 LITFLA.11.d: "Our general, Silvestras Žukauskas, has recently passed away at the age of 76. Having previously served in a cavalry unit in the army of the Russian Empire, he quickly rose through the ranks during the Russo-Japanese war before eventually becoming a Major-General in 1916 due to his service in the Weltkrieg. Following the treaty of Brest-Litowsk, Silvestras Žukauskas has since then served the newly formed independent nation of Lithuania."
 LITFLA.11.a: "Ilsėkis ramybėje."

 LITFLA.12.t: "The History of Lithuania"
 LITFLA.12.d: "Edited by the young historian Adolfas Šapoka, 'The History of Lithuania' is a defining work in Lithuanian historiography, condensing the history of the country from its foundation in the 13th century to modern day in one book which is easy to read for the average consumer. The glorification of Lithuanian heroes and grand dukes in the treatise has led to it being picked up by Lithuanian nationalists as their unofficial Bible."
 LITFLA.12.a: "At least they're happier..."

 LITFLA.13.t: "The National Lithuanian Olympiad"
 LITFLA.13.d: "With patriotism rising across our country, the idea has been suggested to organise a national olympiad of various sporting events where Lithuanian sportsmen and sportswomen, both from the Kingdom and from abroad, would be able to test their skills and compete in preparation for representing their country worldwide. This would be the so-called National Olympiad ('Tautinė Olimpiada'). The National Olympiad would be opened with a prestigious ceremony this July and all of the participants would swear an oath to represent their nation in international sporting events with all of their might, dedicate themselves to the nation and respect its history, culture and traditions. This would be a fantastic event to rouse up support for our government and calm the nation down. The funds for this will come out of the budget."
 LITFLA.13.a: "Endorse the initiative."
 LITFLA.13.b: "It's too costly."

 LITFLA.14.t: "The Cult of Vytautas the Great"
 LITFLA.14.d: "Vytautas the Great, one of the most famous Lithuanian monarchs from the 15th century, has always been a symbol of the Lithuanian fight for independence. He was anti-German and anti-Polish, he promoted Christianity yet was tolerant towards other faiths and cultures, he was a staunch abstinent from alcohol, and he was a great military tactician - thus, he appeals to pretty much everyone in Lithuanian society. Already, there are annual celebrations during his death date five hundred years ago, October 27th, and the day when he should have been crowned as the King of Lithuania before his death, August 8th. An idea has been raised to promote this into a cult of the long deceased Grand Duke, tying his image with the image of the government and thus using this cult of personality to strengthen the legitimacy of our government."
 LITFLA.14.a: "Endorse this idea!"
 LITFLA.14.b: "Let's not be silly."

 LITFLA.15.d: "The famous Lithuanian explorer and traveller, Matas Šalčius, has met his end in Bolivia, on an attempt to travel from Alaska to Tierra de Fuego on a motorcycle. A cultural icon in his home country, responsible for popularising foreign travel and interest in geography, his death has been met with shock and surprise by the Lithuanian people. Šalčius has been buried in an unknown cemetery in Bolivia, but his heart has been brought back to Lithuania where it has been buried in Vilnius."
 LITFLA.15.a: "Now he can explore Heaven on wheels."

 LITFLA.16.t: "Lithuanian Group for the Study of French Culture"
 LITFLA.16.d: "Lietuvių draugija prancūzų kultūrai pažinti (Lithuanian Group for the Study of French Culture) is an organisation of left-leaning Lithuanian poets and writers with the official stated purpose of learning about the culture of France and how it has been affected by the Revolution of 1919. Notable members are Salomeja Neris, Vincas Krėvė and Petras Cvirka. It is widely considered to be a front for the influence of the International in Lithuanian writing circles."
 LITFLA.16.a: "Their influence spreads"

 LITFLA.17.t: "To an Organic Lithuanian State"
 LITFLA.17.d: "Far from all Lithuanian Catholics are aligned with the Christian Democratic Party, its stated goals and vision, or even its support for democracy. A growing new generation of religious activists and intellectuals concentrated in movements such as the Catholic youth journal 'Naujoji Romuva', having forgotten the long struggle of the Lithuanian nation before the Weltkrieg, see it for what it is - a state shackled by petty politicking, German domination, and social injustice. The ideals of this movement are most expressed in the works and activities of Antanas Maceina, culminating in him and many of his peers publishing the manifesto of the Young Catholic movement, 'Į organišką valstybę' ('To an Organic State')\n\nThe primary enemy of the Young Catholic movement is social and economic injustice, spurred by Distributist influence, and in their manifesto, Maceina calls for radical land reform, redistribution of wealth and the uprooting of 'bourgeois-liberal thought' from the Lithuanian identity. Even the Catholic Church would not be safe from redistribution - after all, one can worship Christ without gold and silk, so why should the Church hold onto its wealth when there is so much suffering they could alleviate? In place of capitalism, they push forward a society of economic democracy and Christian corporatism. However, they challenge Syndicalists and social democrats alike by declaring that only an ethnically pure society can be socially and economically just. To them, Lithuania can only be Lithuanian, and a Lithuanian must live and die immersed in national and Catholic culture. While the Naujoji Romuva nominally believes in democracy, they also express that 'temporary' strong hand leadership is necessary and even mandatory to achieve all of their radical reforms.\n\nThe Young Catholic movement sits with the Lithuanian Activist Front, occupying a left-wing, Christian national distributist niche."
 LITFLA.17.a: "I see..."

 LITFLA.18.t: "The Vairas Steers Right"
 LITFLA.18.d: "While all in the LAF seek to free Lithuania from foreign influence, others raise the question of how its subjugation happened in the first place and how to avoid it a second time. This movement, the most right-wing faction of the LAF, is known as the Vairas ('the Wheel'), named after the nationalist journal their followers took over in the 1930s, and their leader is the writer and ideologue Vytautas Alantas.\n\nAlantas declares that it is not enough for Lithuania to break free from German domination - the goal of the LAF should be to form a truly 'national ideology', to liberate Lithuanians spiritually, culturally as well as physically, for as long as they think like slaves and see themselves as slaves, they will remain slaves. In his eyes, the first National Revival was a failure, as it failed to form a truly free Lithuanian state, so the Vairas should be the flag-bearers of a second one, one which will last forever. It disdains Christianity, believing it to be a foreign influence imposed upon Lithuanians, and instead looks towards pagan traditions, which, in Alantas's eyes, are the truest expression of Lithuanian national identity - it idealises a dream where the Lithuanian nation is subservient to a truly nationalist society under a single unquestioned leader, the Vadas, whose citizens are willing to give their life for the Nation, which worships traditions of time immemorial instead of 'the psychosis of democracy'. Despite its totalitarian intentions, it maintains liberal economic intentions, with its leaders such as Domas Cesevičius expressing that a Lithuanian National Revival must create a society where every Lithuanian can achieve well-being through his own effort and individual innovation.\n\nThe Vairas movement sits with the Lithuanian Activist Front, occupying a far-right wing, totalitarian nationalist niche."
 LITFLA.18.a: "I see..."

 LITFLA.19.t: "The Grynoriai"
 LITFLA.19.d: "With the American civil war ravaging the continent, many have left for Europe, and returned to their ancestral homeland. While Lithuania has not been a beacon of stability in the past months either, some refugees have found their way here.\n\nAs they do not have connections, and some younger ones do not even speak Lithuanian, they are integrating slowly. This problem will only be solved by government intervention."
 LITFLA.19.a: "The poor souls..."

 LITFLA.20.t: "Ignas Šeinius - The Red Flood"
 LITFLA.20.d: "Ignas Šeinius, Lithuania's most famous impressionist writer, has recently published a new book, 'Raudonasis tvanas' (The Red Flood) that has just breached Lithuania's prison in literary obscurity.\n\nMuch like his famous 'Kuprelis', The Red Flood is a gripping impressionist tale about a love story between two young individuals in a divided country, but what is most interesting is the setting of the story. The novel takes place in an alternate timeline where the Brusilov Offensive was successful and knocked Austria-Hungary out of the Weltkrieg in 1916. This leads to a chain of events that results in an Entente victory. Germany is engulfed by revolution and becomes a Syndicalist nation, while Russia experiences a coup led by Kolchak, supported by the Black Hundreds, and becomes a totalitarian ultra-nationalist dictatorship. Europe is soon embroiled in war once more, and Lithuania becomes a front line, a bloodbath between the Germans and Russians, where even the strongest men perish and die in minutes. The end of the novel hints at a possible Russian breakthrough, as well as a naval invasion by the still-extant British Empire...\n\nThe book has been criticised for horrid descriptions of cruelty and war crimes, but Šeinius defends his tale, saying that 'something like this could have happened in another Universe'."
 LITFLA.20.a: "Is he trying to make that Universe as bad as possible?"

 LITFLA.21.t: "EuroBasket 1937"
 LITFLA.21.d: "The European basketball championships of 1937, held in Berlin, Germany, have concluded. In a surprising turn of events, the returning champions, the German team, have been bested in a close match by the Lithuanian team, coached by the Lithuanian-American player Feliksas Kriauciunas. German basketball fans have reacted with shock and surprise while the Lithuanians have taken to the streets to celebrate their victory in this David vs Goliath match."

The nobility and the Lithuanian Poles, such as himself, were just as critical to see an independent Lithuanian state arise. Narutowicz's political career has lasted for decades, starting with the Revolution of 1905, when he started the so-called 'Republic of Alsėdžiai' in the surroundings of his manor, and travelled across the Governorate to call people to the Great Seimas of Vilnius. Narutowicz was a member of the left faction of the Council of Lithuania and campaigned for a republic first and foremost, but ultimately conceded to the monarchist cause.\n\nThe leader of the Committee of Lithuanian Poles is perhaps the only Pole whom even Lithuanian nationalists, such as Antanas Smetona, respect - his efforts for an independent Lithuanian state are well known and so is his unyielding support for democracy, the rights of all minorities in Lithuania, and social justice.§!"

His profession of choice was the law at the University of Moscow, a decision which would guide his path in life from there on out - experiencing the nihilist, atheist atmosphere of the Russian intelligentsia forced him to cling even more deeply to his Catholic faith, realising that its universalism and compassion, backed by reflective philosophy, is the best answer to the fundamental questions of life. These beliefs were reinforced by correspondence with Adomas Jakštas and studies at the Catholic University of Fribourg, in Switzerland.\n\nŠalkauskis is not a politician by trade and finds philosophy far more comfortable, but his complex vision of a new, compassionate Christian society has swayed many in the Christian Democratic Party. A drive towards an 'optimal system of government', a need for a government guided by solidarity and anti-capitalism, and a holistic interpretation of Lithuania as a synthesis of Eastern and Western culture are the main points of his ideology.§!"

Upon the outbreak of the Weltkrieg, he was a cavalry officer in the Imperial Russian Army and fought in the Eastern and Caucasus Fronts, reportedly getting wounded twenty-nine times, and yet returning for more every single time. The October Revolution found him while he was stationed in the Caucasus, but did not discourage him one bit - posing as a Cossack, he joined Anton Denikin's Volunteer Army and fought alongside the Whites against the Bolshevik uprising in the Russian south. Though his service there was brief, it instilled Plechavičius with a deep and seething hatred for communism - alongside his brother Aleksas, he returned to Lithuania in the fall of 1918.\n\nPlechavičius found Lithuania in chaos and disorder, infested with bandits and Bolshevik sympathisers, where the German authorities held a tenuous grip. He organised a band of Samogitian men, which soon grew into an army, and enacted a policy of White terror in northern and western Lithuania. Though his methods were effective in restoring order in his home, even receiving tacit German authority approval, the Constituent Assembly of Lithuania was horrified by the brutality. Threatened by the Social Democratic deputy Liuda Purėnienė with legal action, Plechavičius defended himself simply: \"Honourable justices, if I or a person like me weren't there at the time, none of us would be sitting here today\".

The February Revolution in Russia saw him, an officer stationed in Omsk, travel across the entirety of the disintegrating Empire, through hardship and danger, until he reached Vilnius in the first half of 1918. Seeing the Council of Lithuania paralysed and the Germans having free rein in his homeland disappointed him, however. Against the will of the Council and the Ober Ost administration, he organised a Lithuanian volunteer unit in Vilnius, engaging in street clashes with Polish paramilitaries and raising the flag of Lithuania atop the Gediminas Tower on January 1st, 1919, before it was taken down by German authorities the day after.\n\nDespite this futile resistance, he ended up acquitted and became one of the first volunteers in the Lithuanian army.

His friend Jozef Piłsudski was imprisoned by the Kaiser's minions and Poles kowtowed to Berlin's will.\n\nDefeated, Żeligowski put aside the dreams of unified Polish people for now, and focused on the task at hand - to speak for the Poles in Lithuania, and to strive for Lithuania where Poles are free to express their culture - and perhaps, one day, unite with their brothers in the south.§!"

 LIT_kazys_ladiga_commander_desc: "§YBorn:§! §LDecember 25th, 1893, in Iškonys, Kovno Governorate, Russian Empire§!\n§YBackground:§! §LKazys Ladiga's military career started with his service as a reconnaissance scout in the Imperial Russian Army - for his bravery and several wounds he endured, he was awarded the Cross of St. George. He was one of the few Lithuanian officers who did not defect after the February Revolution - instead, he remained in service until February of 1918, when he and his entire unit were taken prisoner by advancing German forces in Dunaburg. Ladiga remained imprisoned for almost a year until he was found by Konstantinas Olšauskas, a delegate from the Council of Lithuania, and bailed out in order to join the developing Lithuanian armed forces.\n\nKazys Ladiga is a staunch abstinent and Christian, but suffers from nefarious voices claiming that he is a communist sympathiser - after all, he remained in the Russian Army even after the October Revolution, unlike his peers, who defected as soon as the military began to disintegrate.§!"

Among this list, he saw one or two Lithuanian surnames - and immediately reached out to those men to speak to them only in Lithuanian from then on out. A stalwart Lithuanian nationalist and a respected general, Adamkavičius was one of the first volunteers in the Royal Lithuanian Armed Forces upon his return in November of 1918. Though of somewhat poor health, owing to miraculously surviving a bullet going through his head during the Weltkrieg, the moustached general commands great respect from his peers and junior officers.§!"
