 SWI_romandy_crisis_desc: "Agitated by supporters in the neighbouring French Commune, local Syndicalist revolutionaries in Romandie and Haute-Savoie have made a move against the Swiss national government. This uprising has become internationally known as "The Savoyard Crisis", and how the government reacts to this crisis will shape the future of our nation."

 SWI_bend_to_france: "Bend to France"
 SWI_bend_to_france_desc: "Germany has abandoned us, and no other nation has taken up our cause in the face of the French behemoth. Is it not better, then, to join the French rather than be crushed by the Syndicalist tide?"

 SWI_enemies_on_all_sides: "Enemies on All Sides"
 SWI_enemies_on_all_sides_desc: "Germany to the North has betrayed us. France to the West has seized our land, backed by Italy to the South. Austria to the East pays us no heed.

 SWI_german_aid: "Aid from Germany"
 SWI_german_aid_desc: "In the face of outright aggression from the French, Germany has answered our calls for aid and stands firmly with the Swiss people in their stand against Syndicalism. With Germany by our side, we can beat back the French hordes and secure our borders with German aid."

 SWI_black_spot_of_europe: "The Black Spot of Europe"
 SWI_black_spot_of_europe_desc: "There is a Black Spot forming in the centre of Europe, where few enter, and few leave. The Swiss people have made their nation an impenetrable fortress bristling with xenophobia and myriad interweaving fortresses, content for now to their self-imposed isolation."

 SWI_abolish_the_verdingkinder_desc: "The Verdingkinder, or "Contract Children", are children taken from their loving families and sent to work as slaves for the benefit of fat capitalist corporations. These children must be freed immediately from the capitalist yoke and be re-educated with good Syndicalist values."

 SWI_mandatory_service: "All Citizens Serve"
 SWI_mandatory_service_desc: "It is not enough to simply draft the men in defence of Switzerland. The women, the children, the elderly. Our neighbours can field armies of millions, so we too must field an army of equal size to combat these threats."

 SWI_gold_reserves: "Fill the Gold Reserves"
 SWI_gold_reserves_desc: "To form the backbone of our new economy, the Swiss Bank's gold reserves must be filled and preserved with large quantities of gold that will anchor our currency for generations to come."

 SWI_the_government_has_failed: "The Government Has Failed"
 SWI_the_government_has_failed_desc: "The current model of the Swiss government has proven wholly weak and ineffective in protecting Switzerland from the vultures that circle her. Drastic governmental reform and a strong leading hand are needed if Switzerland is to continue as a free and independent nation."

 SWI_one_people: "One Swiss People, One Swiss Language"
 SWI_one_people_desc: "For too long have the Swiss people bent to the wills of our neighbours and spoken in their tongues. It is time for Switzerland to abandon these foreign languages and only conduct official business in the German language, the one true language of Switzerland."

 SWI_swiss_french_alliance: "Safeguarding the Future of Switzerland"
 SWI_swiss_french_alliance_desc: "The diplomatic pressure coming from the French Commune is overwhelming, and the other powers of Europe have shown themselves too afraid to stand against the Commune's might. The Syndicalist wave is unstoppable, we are better off bowing to France of our own accord then being swept aside by the inevitable."

 SWI_geneva_avenged: "Avenge Those Lost in Geneva"
 SWI_geneva_avenged_desc: "Years ago, the brave workers of Geneva stood up for their rights and freedoms, and were brutally struck down by the old capitalist regime.

 SWI_beat_back_french: "Beat Back the French"
 SWI_beat_back_french_desc: "After securing our position from the National Redoubt, it is time to gather our forces and mount a large counterattack in order to fight the French off of our land. Once beaten back, we can work with our German allies and march into the Commune itself."

 SWI_austrian_assisstance: "Alliance with Austria"
 SWI_austrian_assisstance_desc: "Responding to our calls for aid, our longtime neighbour the Austrian Empire has responded and promised to defend our sovereignty against French aggression. With the aid of a power such as Austria, we are surely capable of holding against the French invaders."

 SWI_fortress: "Réduit"
 SWI_fortress_desc: "Switzerland's defensive mindset centres around a series of mountain fortresses and fortifications that make Switzerland an impenetrable obstacle. This prideful spirit of defence drives our forces onwards to a glorious victory."

 SWI_national_unions: "Found the National Unions"
 SWI_national_unions_desc: "Outside of Romandie, Syndicalist Unions have failed to make significant gains politically and are struggling with their newfound power. We must support and officially recognise the authority these Unions now have in the government."

 SWI_Sargans_desc: "Fortress Sargans forms one of the three main defensive fortifications that make up the defensive network stretching across Switzerland.

 SWI_retreat_redoubt: "Retreat to the National Redoubt"
 SWI_retreat_redoubt_desc: "The betrayal of the Romandie Cantons and the advance of the French forces has put us in an unfavourable position. We cannot hope to hold the line at the border, it is best that our military retreat to our prepared defences in the National Redoubt as we regroup and prepare our counterattack."

 SWI_cultivation_battle: "Winning the Cultivation Battle"
 SWI_cultivation_battle_desc: "Switzerland is not a nation blessed with an abundance of natural resources. For centuries Swiss farmers have fought a battle against the harsh mountain climates to grow enough crops to feed the nation. Now that war looms on the horizon, we must subsidise these farmers to make Switzerland self-sufficient."

 SWI_bircher_plan: "The Bircher Plan"
 SWI_bircher_plan_desc: "Major General Eugen Bircher has put forth a plan to defend the nation that involves pursuing a more traditional war with a larger army and a central, mobile force that would seek set-piece battles. Choosing this plan would commit the nation to fighting a war centred around a mobile army with as many offensive moves as defensive."

 SWI_guisan_plan: "The Guisan Plan"
 SWI_guisan_plan_desc: "Lieutenant Colonel Henri Guisan has put forth a plan to defend the nation that involves a stoic defence and continued usage of the pre-prepared fallback lines and fortresses that would ensure a campaign of guerrilla warfare throughout our nation. Accepting his plan would mean moving forward with a plan to fight a purely defensive war."

 SWI_man_borders: "Activate the Border Guard"
 SWI_man_borders_desc: "We must first activate the civilian Border Guard units and flood our outer defences with soldiers in a show of force against outside aggression. The Swiss people will flock in droves to our defence, and only the staunchest of foes would dare break themselves upon our walls."

 SWI_guisan_speech: "The Rütlirapport"
 SWI_guisan_speech_desc: "What the troops need to perform effectively is a strong leader who will lead them through the darkness to victory. Henri Guisan is prepared to be that man, and has gathered a large amount of soldiers to inspire with his words."

 SWI_resist_to_the_end: "Resist to the End"
 SWI_resist_to_the_end_desc: "Even after the battles are lost and are armies driven from the field, our enemies can not rest easy. It is the duty of the Swiss people to resist in everything they do, and to stop the enemy in every way they can."

 SWI_ski_divisions: "Assemble the Ski Divisions"
 SWI_ski_divisions_desc: "The Swiss Ski Divisions have a mastery of the Alpine terrain and should be moved into a single, cohesive unit capable of making a decisive strike against our enemies. Properly equipping and expanding these forces will give us a powerful tool to use in the fights to come."

 SWI_mountineer_defense: "Active Defence"
 SWI_mountineer_defense_desc: "The best defence is a good offence. It is not good enough to simply sit behind or lines. We must make active manoeuvres and strike at the enemy whenever we are given an opportunity, so that we may eventually drive him from our lands entirely."

 SWI_luftwaffe: "The Schweizerische Flugwaffe"
 SWI_luftwaffe_desc: "The Swiss Air Force has not seen a major change in composition since the end of the Weltkrieg. Our planes are old and decrepit, and in drastic need of an overhaul. We must begin an immediate modernisation of our air force so as not to be left behind."

 SWI_mitteleuropa: "Join the Reichspakt"
 SWI_mitteleuropa_desc: "Our continued cooperation with the Germans and integration of our economic and military command structures have pushed us ever closer into the German sphere. Our ties are so great that it seems almost unthinkable to sever our ties with Germany, even if we may desire it. We are already a de facto member of the German sphere, and the time has come to formally join the Reichspakt as a proper member state."

 SWI_national_bank: "Federal Act on Banks and Savings Banks"
 SWI_national_bank_desc: "The Swiss National Bank is the strong economic arm of the entire country, handling the finances of the vast majority of the population and the government alike. Subsidising and assisting the bank in its operations, and allowing for bank secrecy when dealing with account holder funds, will serve to boost the economy as we recover from the Black Monday disaster."

 SWI_free_our_skies: "Free our Skies"
 SWI_free_our_skies_desc: "Our terrestrial defences are strong, but can be easily weakened in the face of enemy air superiority. We should focus heavily on maintaining air superiority in order to keep our enemies at bay."

 SWI_alpine_rhine: "Expand the Alpine Rhine Crossing"
 SWI_alpine_rhine_desc: "Our border with Austria is complicated by rivers and mountains that make traversing the terrain slow and difficult. Expansion of these passages between our two nations will enhance the Austrian's ability to send troops and materials to our aid when advancing westwards into the Commune."

 SWI_economic_routes: "Create Economic Lifelines"
 SWI_economic_routes_desc: "The conflict with France has severed many of our traditional routes of supply. As a landlocked nation, we rely heavily on land routes through friendly nations in order to receive the resources we need for survival. We must expand these network in order to fuel our war effort and maintain the flow of goods."

 SWI_new_fighters: "New Fighters"
 SWI_new_fighters_desc: "It is not enough to copy the designs of other nation's militaries. Funding a new initiative to design a truly Swiss fighter will reduce our dependence on foreign militaries for supplies and equipment."

 SWI_international_aid: "Call for International Aid"
 SWI_international_aid_desc: "Our own forces are insufficient, but we hold the moral high ground in this obviously unwarranted conflict. By pleading with every nation that will listen for aid, maybe we can scrape together enough assistance to turn the tide."

 SWI_formalize_volunteers: "Formalise the Volunteer Divisions"
 SWI_formalize_volunteers_desc: "With a new flow of foreign volunteers established, it is now only a matter of organising this trickle of able-bodied men into cohesive fighting units. Mixing these volunteer units with proper Swiss soldiers will strengthen their backbone and improve their organisation the battlefield."

 SWI_hold_the_line: "Hold the Limmat Line"
 SWI_hold_the_line_desc: "Even with a world power on our side, we must still find a way to hold the line against the French aggressors. We cannot win alone, so we must use every advantage available to us to survive long enough for foreign intervention to save the day."

 SWI_german_military_tactics: "Learn German Tactics"
 SWI_german_military_tactics_desc: "Joining our military command with Germany's has taught us that our own military tactics are woefully behind the times. The new doctrine of the German Army can be taught to our troops in order to bring our troops up to our Ally's standards."

 SWI_mountain_airfields: "Alpine Airfields"
 SWI_mountain_airfields_desc: "The lofty peaks of the Swiss Alps provide many areas for us to construct new airfields for military use. The altitude of these airfields will make them difficult for the enemy to seize or destroy in war."

 SWI_air_academy: "Nationalise SwissAir"
 SWI_air_academy_desc: "Our air force is lacking in trained pilots and serviceable planes. In light of this crisis, we must take advantage of every possible plane we can get our hands on. One proposition is to nationalise all civilian planes and recruit their pilots, mechanics, and radiomen into our own air force."

 SWI_cross_the_border: "Airborne Border Raids"
 SWI_cross_the_border_desc: "We should look to use our air force not only as a defensive force, but also as a force capable of striking deep into enemy territory. Performing these cross-border raids into enemy territory will let our enemies know that we are capable of more than simple defensive actions."

 SWI_mountain_aa: "Camouflaged Anti-Air Emplacements"
 SWI_mountain_aa_desc: "The mountainous terrain of the Alps creates a multitude of areas where we can create new defensive AA emplacements to defend our skies. Such a network of emplaced defences will make any air force rethink their plans to invade our airspace."

 SWI_new_swiss_army: "The New Swiss Army"
 SWI_new_swiss_army_desc: "Through reform and new military leadership, the Swiss Army of today is all but unrecognisable compared to the army that marched in drill but a few short years ago. This new army is tough, veteran, and ready to take on the world."

 SWI_coal_mines: "Expand The Coal Mines"
 SWI_coal_mines_desc: "The National Coal Mines provide the strong economic foundation on which the Swiss economy is built. Expanding their operations will increase our economic output exponentially."

 SWI_reverse_economic_downturn_desc: "After the disastrous hit to our economy that was Black Monday, it has become clear the government needs to take immediate action in order to save the Swiss economy from suffering a complete meltdown."

 SWI_war_profiteering: "War Profiteering"
 SWI_war_profiteering_desc: "Our neighbour's losses are our gains. Selling weapons to our neighbours as they kill each other in senseless conflict can only serve to strengthen our own position when the time comes to fight."

 SWI_economic_sufficiency: "Striving for Economic Self-Sufficiency"
 SWI_economic_sufficiency_desc: "All aspects of the Swiss economy rely heavily on foreign imports in order to survive. We must work to move as many industries as possible inside of our own borders to reduce our reliance on foreign powers and encourage our economy to rely on internal sources for production."

 SWI_liscense_foregin_designs: "Licence Foreign Designs"
 SWI_liscense_foregin_designs_desc: "Foreign aircraft have proven to be deadly and effective in recent wars. Our own aircraft industry is in its infancy. Perhaps the best idea is to instead licence foreign designs rather than having to spend valuable resources researching our own Swiss aircraft."

 SWI_trans_alpine_tunnels: "The Trans-Alpine Railway Tunnels"
 SWI_trans_alpine_tunnels_desc: "The tunnels running beneath the Alps form a powerful economic lifeline that cross through the centre of Europe. Expanding these tunnels will increase our ability to profit from our control of these railways."

 SWI_promote_franc: "Promote the Swiss Franc"
 SWI_promote_franc_desc: "The economic systems of our neighbours have seen disastrous free falls in the wake of Black Monday. This has affected the strengths of their currencies, and confidence in the financial markets has fallen. Promoting the Swiss franc as the viable alternative to the failing German mark will serve to boost our own economy in the face of this economic crisis."

 SWI_sell_war_bonds: "Sell Wehr Bonds"
 SWI_sell_war_bonds_desc: "Promotion of the Swiss Franc has begun boosting our economy, but the government is still heavily in debt. We must turn to the people in order to support the government in the face of war."

 SWI_strategic_services: "Found the Military Intelligence Service"
 SWI_strategic_services_desc: "As a small nation in the centre of Europe, we cannot hope to win on strength alone. We must found a new intelligence service that can solve our problems before they can snowball out of control, and give us powerful intelligence on the moves of our enemies."

 SWI_electronics_research: "NEMA Modell 45"
 SWI_electronics_research_desc: "Developed as a replacement for the ageing German ciphers used by the Swiss Army prior to the Second Weltkrieg, the NEMA represents the nation's interests in ensuring that no other nation no matter how friendly, can read our mail."

 SWI_issues_of_the_day: "Issues of the Day"
 SWI_issues_of_the_day_desc: "For many issues of public importance in Switzerland, the people are allowed to vote in nation-wide referendums, where the outcome is determined by popular vote. Focusing our efforts on these issues will ensure that we tackle the societal problems that people find important in their daily lives."

 SWI_vienna_circle: "Join the Vienna Circle"
 SWI_vienna_circle_desc: "The Austrians have recently made overtures to other nations close to them to participate in the Vienna Circle, a centre of technological advancement and learning in the heart of the Austrian Empire. Joining such a programme would no doubt allow us to enjoy the fruit of these technological advancements."

 SWI_strengthen_ties: "Strengthen Formal Ties"
 SWI_strengthen_ties_desc: "Our continued relationship with Austria in our fight against Syndicalism is the lifeline keeping our nation from total collapse. We must make moves to ensure that this relationship holds for as long as we face a common foe."

 SWI_an_official_alliance: "Join the Donau-Adriabund"
 SWI_an_official_alliance_desc: "While we are de-facto in an alliance with our wartime ally Austria, it has become necessary to make the alliance a formal relationship. Austria commands the loyalty of a larger network of nations, and joining this web as a formal participant can only serve to strengthen our position."

 SWI_german_tech_sharing: "The Kaiser Wilhelm Society"
 SWI_german_tech_sharing_desc: "The Kaiser Wilhelm Society is Germany's foremost centre of technological advancements and research. Applying for membership in such a prestigious collaboration effort will improve our ability to field a technologically advanced military force."

 SWI_never_again: "Never Another Geneva"
 SWI_never_again_desc: "The Geneva Strikes of the early 1930s were caused by a failing and inefficient government. We have made steps to reform that government, but there are many who seek protections against such a tragedy ever occurring again. Thus the Syndicalist Unions are to be given their own military powers, so that the power rests solely in the hands of the Trade Unions."

 SWI_the_peoples_republic: "Found the Helvetic Commune"
 SWI_the_peoples_republic_desc: "The people of Switzerland have made their wills clear. The crimes and failings of the past were caused by a government too strong for its own good, and too disconnected from the people, wallowing in its capitalist greed. Thus a new government must be formed, a government run solely by the people, and for the people."

 SWI_totalitarian_regime: "A Stronger Hand is Needed"
 SWI_totalitarian_regime_desc: "The people of Switzerland have made their will clear. The crimes and failings of the past were caused by lack of protection from foreign influences. The common people cannot defend against such aggression by themselves. Thus a strong state is necessary to safeguard the nation's future comrades. For we are the only thing standing between you and them."

 SWI_loyalty_to_the_state: "Loyalty to the State"
 SWI_loyalty_to_the_state_desc: "We must encourage loyalty to the state whenever possible, so that we may foster both a populace and a military that values the strength of the government and its ability to protect the people."

 SWI_consolidate_power: "Consolidate Governmental Power"
 SWI_consolidate_power_desc: "There are dissenting voices still within the government and in the streets that oppose the takeover of the government by loyal nationalist forces. These voices are muted, for now, but a consolidation is necessary if we are to identify and "rectify" those who still have misguided views on the government in Switzerland."

 SWI_fortress_defense: "Fortress Defences"
 SWI_fortress_defense_desc: "If our enemies are so keen to attack us in our homes, then we will make such a network of interconnected fortifications that the very idea of assaulting Switzerland will fill the enemy with dread, as they imagine the many millions it will take to gain even a single kilometre of our land."

 SWI_expansionist_military: "Encourage Militarism"
 SWI_expansionist_military_desc: "Only through show of arms can we secure our nation's future. To this end, it is important that we instil a strong sense of national pride in all citizens of the nation, so that they will fight to the bitter end to defend their home and their state."

 SWI_nuclear_program: "The Study Commission for Nuclear Energy"
 SWI_nuclear_program_desc: "The Study Commission for Nuclear Energy's purpose is to investigate the use of both nuclear power in providing for our nation's energy needs, and to evaluate the requirements for the advancement of a weaponised nuclear programme for the defence of the nation."

 SWI_uranium_mine: "The Schmutzli Project"
 SWI_uranium_mine_desc: "Switzerland is a small state compared to the titans of Europe. Thus we find it necessary to defend ourselves with all means available to us, even if we must bathe the continent in nuclear fire to achieve our goals."

 SWI_expand_our_operations: "Expand our Intelligence Operations"
 SWI_expand_our_operations_desc: "With the world falling to chaos, the Military Intelligence Service must be called upon again and again to undertake more dangerous and more dubious tasks to defend the nation. Expanding their areas of influence and operational capacities will help them resolve whatever problem comes their way. No matter how unsavoury."

 SWI_motorization: "Transition to a Motorised Force"
 SWI_motorization_desc: "Our military is almost entirely composed of foot infantry and horse-drawn support. Our troops are slow to move and our supplies even slower to arrive. It is important that we invest in motorisation to keep our troops from fighting the next war with the last war's equipment."

 SWI_armor_experiments: "Invest in the Nahkampfkanone"
 SWI_armor_experiments_desc: "The Nahkampfkanone, an experimental Swiss AT Destroyer, has shown great promise in its initial field tests. This project has shown that we are capable of designing our own armoured vehicles, and that we should continue to invest in similar projects."

 SWI_mechanised_brigades: "Leichte Brigaden"
 SWI_mechanised_brigades_desc: "Our initial motorisation efforts have proved most successful, but there is still more to do. In Germany, new mechanised Leichte Brigaden have begun to show promise as the fighting force of the future, and it is only wise that we follow in their footsteps and invest in our own mechanised forces."

 SWI_new_academy: "Reform the Pilot Schools"
 SWI_new_academy_desc: "In the interwar period, our fighters relied on an informal school of training that involved local instructors and wildly differing levels of competence. Now that the Air Force is being reformed into a strong and professional force, we must take care to standardise our pilot training school to improve the quality of our pilots nationwide."

 SWI_new_tactics: "Bambini-Code"
 SWI_new_tactics_desc: "Bambini-Code is a brevity code recently developed to allow for easy communication between our fighter squadrons in the heat of combat. Its use has proven wildly effective, and promoting and requiring its use among our pilots will drastically improve their ability to perform against their counterparts."

 SWI_bombers: "Surveillance Squadrons"
 SWI_bombers_desc: "The establishment of the Surveillance Squadrons will allow us to gain intelligence through fighter patrols in and around our borders while also maintaining a large nighttime presence."

 SWI_air_factories: "Flugzeugwerk Emmen"

 SWI_strategic_bombing: "Strategic Bombing Initiatives"
 SWI_strategic_bombing_desc: "The acceleration of our previous raiding campaigns have taught us that if we are to continue, we must invest in large strategic bombing forces. These forces will allow us to project our power across the continent while maintaining our air force entirely within the confines of Switzerland."

 SWI_defensive_constructions: "New Defensive Fortifications"
 SWI_defensive_constructions_desc: "Our previous projects have given us extensive experience and knowledge in the proper construction and design of fortifications. We can take advantage of this knowledge and create new defensive networks wherever they are needed."

 SWI_new_roadways: "Electrify the Railways"
 SWI_new_roadways_desc: "Our nation is one with twisting roadways and extensive railways that connect cities separated by large mountain ranges. It is important that we update and maintain our extensive rail networks so that we may move goods and soldiers around the nation as easily as possible. Electrifying tour rail lines with power from our hydroelectric dams will ensure they run as efficiently as possible."

 SWI_develop_cantons: "National Canton Development Initiative"
 SWI_develop_cantons_desc: "We must make a concerted effort to develop all regions of the nation equally. To this end, we must allow the Cantons autonomy in their own development and construction of infrastructure, as well as to empower the Bureau of Mining of the Federal War, Industry and Employment Office to create a national survey of the nation's natural resources for exploitation."

 SWI_canton_improvement: "Subsidise Schmolz + Bickenbach"
 SWI_canton_improvement_desc: "Switzerland is a nation with few national resources of its own. Schmolz + Bickenbach is one of the few Steel corporations operating inside of the country. If Switzerland is to become self-sufficient in Steel production, we will need to fund their efforts."

 SWI_swiss_seas: "Swiss on the High Seas"
 SWI_swiss_seas_desc: "Switzerland is a traditionally landlocked nation with no direct access to the high seas, however, this does not prevent us from fielding a fleet of our own. Whether it is a militarised navy or one of maritime commerce, the Swiss will sail the seas as proud as any other nation on earth."

 SWI_final_factories: "The Swiss War Economy"
 SWI_final_factories_desc: "The war is becoming a large drain on our stockpiles of arms and ammunition. Our trade with foreign powers is not only insufficient, but unreliable.

 SWI_expanding_the_shipyards: "Expand the Shipyards"
 SWI_expanding_the_shipyards_desc: "Our military adventures have found us currently in possession of several large shipyards. These shipyards, the first in our nation's history, could be used to produce the large blue-water navy that the Swiss people have only ever dreamed of."

 SWI_merchant_marine: "Focus on the Merchant Marine"
 SWI_merchant_marine_desc: "Investing into a strong military navy would be a waste. By the time hostilities have ended, our navy will still be in its infancy. Meanwhile, we could instead use this time to invest heavily into our merchant marine, the voyages of which could directly impact our international trade and bring back tidy profits."

 SWI_military_navy: "Focus on a Militarised Navy"

 SWI_naval_officers: "Naval Officer Training"
 SWI_naval_officers_desc: "Switzerland's naval activities in previous years has consisted only of merchant marine sailors and the brown water Lakes Flotilla. We must take these few experienced men we can, and use them to train the next generation of proud Swiss sailors for our navy."

 SWI_ship_designs: "Swiss Ship Designs"
 SWI_ship_designs_desc: "While we have come into the possession of new naval facilities, a first for this formerly landlocked state, we cannot move forward with a fleet without first investing in ship designs.

 SWI_first_vessel: "Christening the EKS Helvetia"
 SWI_first_vessel_desc: "After several gruelling months of work, it is time for great celebration as the Swiss Navy officially christens its first ocean going naval vessel. The EKS Helvetia is the first of many in the new Swiss Fleet, and will serve as our first flagship as the Swiss Navy joins the great oceangoing fleets of this age."

 SWI_beneath_the_waves: "Swiss beneath the Waves"
 SWI_beneath_the_waves_desc: "While we have found ourselves in possession of large naval facilities and dockyards, it is not feasible to create a large traditional fleet. Instead we should focus on cheap and efficient submarines, so that we can project power without the decades-long investments a surface fleet requires."

 SWI_surface_fleet: "The Landlocked Fleet"
 SWI_surface_fleet_desc: "Our nation was formerly a landlocked state, one that could not properly project its power on the high seas. Now we find ourselves in the possession of multiple dockyards, and as an ascendant naval power. It is our duty to create a surface fleet that can go toe-to-toe with the old powers."

 SWI_peace_at_last: "Peace and Reconciliation"
 SWI_peace_at_last_desc: "We have made it through the Savoyard Crisis with no Swiss blood being shed.

 SWI_french_mission: "Diplomatic Mission to the Commune"
 SWI_french_mission_desc: "The source of the crisis in Haute-Savoie was our extremely sour relations with our large neighbour, the Commune of France. We have had poor relations for over a decade, and it is time for this era of rivalry to end.

 SWI_integrate_militias_desc: "The true heroes of the Savoyard Crisis are the brave men of the anti-syndicalist militias. Their support helped us strengthen our nation, but it is now time to integrate the political militias into our armed forces, so they can fight for our great nation once again."

 SWI_refugee_question: "The Refugee Question"
 SWI_refugee_question_desc: "Switzerland has had a liberal immigration policy since the late 19th century. However it has become apparent that many of these migrants and refugees are to blame for many of our problems. While others have shown too much cowardice to stand up to international emigration, we must act to change our immigration policy."

### Intro Screen ###
 SWI_country_intro_header: "The State of Switzerland"
 SWI_country_intro_content: "The Swiss Confederation saw crisis in 19th century. In several cantons liberal powers prevailed, calling for more democracy and more centralism. This met the opposition of the Catholic, conservatively dominated cantons who formed the Sonderbund in 1845. The Sonderbund War erupted in 1847 which saw the liberals as victors. In 1848 a Federal Constitution was ratified, turning the loose league of cantons into a federal state with a new federal capital in Bern. The new constitution created new institutions like the Bundesrat (Federal Council), Bundesversammlung (Federal Assembly), and Bundesgericht (Federal Court). Switzerland remained neutral throughout the Weltkrieg, although there were various domestic conflicts between German and French speaking Swiss citizens. In addition economic problems arose, completely surrounded as the country was by warring nations. The radical left gained a lot of support during that time, and in 1919 a strike in Geneva called for by the workers movement attempted to push through major social changes. The attempt failed because of the fear of spreading of French syndicalism and its subsequent repression by Swiss government, but in its wake social reforms were begun, bringing about higher wages and shorter work days. In 1919 the system of proportional representation was introduced. The conservative Freisinnige lost their majority while the social democrats grew stronger. Into the 1930s domestic politics were governed in response to the conflict between social democrats and conservatives. The struggles between communities in Switzerland are now taking more political values: French-speakers are more socialist, Germans more conservative and Italians more clerical. Will the rising belligerence in Europe have consequences on the neutral Confederation?"

### Events ###
 swiss.1.t: "Guisan's Speech"
 swiss.1.d: "It was a wonderful sunny day when Henri Guisan made his speech not only to all of the soldiers and officers in attendance, but to the whole of Switzerland. In his speech he praised the strength and unity of the Swiss people, and promised that victory was not only attainable, but assured.\n\nAs Guisan finished giving his lengthy and beautifully worded speech, he was greeted with thunderous applause from all in attendance. This will surely go down in Swiss history as a historic event."
 swiss.1.a: "Inspirational to us all."

 swiss.2.t: "Gathering the Army"
 swiss.2.d: "Switzerland has maintained its neutrality in conflict for hundreds of years. We are a people that hold fast to our values of neutrality and peace. But now we find ourselves embroiled in a conflict for our very survival. The men are scared and many are unsure if they are capable of fighting at all. Seeing this weakness among the soldiers, Henri Guisan has decided to hold a large rally on the Rütli, the historic location of the Rütlischwur of 1291. All Swiss officers are to be in attendance, and the speech is to be made to inspire Swiss people across the nation."
 swiss.2.a: "We await Guisan's speech."

 swiss.3.t: "Referendum: Official Languages"
 swiss.3.d: "Enough political capital has been raised to institute an official referendum today on an important topic to the Swiss people. The issue of whether or not to include Romansch as a national language of Switzerland is what is to be decided. If voted in, this predominantly Swiss language would join the likes of French, German, and Italian among Switzerland's national languages. Should we support this referendum?"
 swiss.3.a: "No Campaigning."
 swiss.3.b: "Limited Campaigning."
 swiss.3.c: "Moderate Campaigning."
 swiss.3.e: "Extensive Campaigning."

 swiss.5.t: "The Language Referendum Succeeds"

 swiss.7.t: "Referendum: The National Protection Act"
 swiss.7.d: "There has been increasing support recently for increasing powers of the state to arrest and detain subversive actors in the nation with increased authority. This move is seen as necessary by many who have seen the escalating rift between French West and German East inside of the country, and believe that many extremist movements, on the right and left, are forming an increasingly large threat to the stability of the nation. Many opponents believe that it will only be a stopgap measure, and that a conflict between the government and extremist movements is inevitable. Should we support this referendum?"
 swiss.7.a: "No Campaigning."
 swiss.7.b: "Limited Campaigning."
 swiss.7.c: "Moderate Campaigning."
 swiss.7.e: "Extensive Campaigning."

 swiss.9.t: "The National Protection Referendum Succeeds"

 swiss.10.a: "The people did not support it."

 swiss.11.t: "Referendum: Combat the Economic Crisis"
 swiss.11.d: "The recent disaster that was Black Monday has thrown the nation's economy into a dangerous downward spiral. There are actions that the government can, and will, take to combat this crisis, but this referendum is to decide whether the government can take extraordinary action outside of its usual power in order to resolve the crisis swiftly. Should we support this referendum?"
 swiss.11.a: "No Campaigning."
 swiss.11.b: "Limited Campaigning."
 swiss.11.c: "Moderate Campaigning."
 swiss.11.e: "Extensive Campaigning."

 swiss.13.t: "The Economic Referendum Succeeds"

 swiss.13.a: "Wonderful!"

 swiss.14.t: "The Economic Referendum Fails"
 swiss.14.d: "It seems that the people do not believe that the government needs extra authority to solve the crisis. What does this mean for our economy?"
 swiss.14.a: "The people did not support it."

 swiss.15.t: "Referendum: Ban Syndicalist Unions"
 swiss.15.d: "It is no secret that Syndicalism has been spreading constantly over recent years inside of the nation. It shares a large border with the Syndicalist Commune of France, and the pains of the Geneva Massacre still fester in Romandie. This referendum is an extreme measure to combat this crisis at the root, and ban the Syndicalist Unions from the nation entirely. This move is sure to be controversial, especially with the French Commune. Should we support this referendum?"
 swiss.15.a: "No Campaigning."
 swiss.15.b: "Limited Campaigning."
 swiss.15.c: "Moderate Campaigning."
 swiss.15.e: "Extensive Campaigning."

 swiss.17.t: "The Syndicalist Union Referendum Succeeds"
 swiss.17.d: "Despite strong Syndicalist support in the Western regions of Switzerland, the referendum has succeeded. All existing Syndicalist Trade Unions are now dissolved and none are legally allowed to form again. This is sure to raise the ire of the French."
 swiss.17.a: "Wonderful!"

 swiss.18.t: "The Syndicalist Union Referendum Fails"
 swiss.18.d: "It seems that Syndicalist support was too strong, and the referendum has failed. Syndicalists will continue to meet as they have done over the past few years."
 swiss.18.a: "The people did not support it."

 swiss.19.t: "Referendum: Reorganise the Army"
 swiss.19.d: "It has become clear that the old structure of the Swiss army is no longer fit for the coming years. Previously, the military has relied on a strong reserve of quickly-trained volunteers in order to form the backbone of the army when in need, but the rise of strong professional armies all around Switzerland has made this model seem obsolete. This referendum proposes that we reform the army along the German model, and create a strong and professional standing force. Should we support this referendum?"
 swiss.19.a: "No Campaigning."
 swiss.19.b: "Limited Campaigning."
 swiss.19.c: "Moderate Campaigning."
 swiss.19.e: "Extensive Campaigning."

 swiss.21.t: "The Army Referendum Succeeds"
 swiss.21.d: "The army referendum has succeeded, and reforms are to begin immediately within the ranks of our armed forces."
 swiss.21.a: "Wonderful!"

 swiss.22.t: "The Army Referendum Fails"
 swiss.22.d: "The people have struck down our proposed reforms to the army. The army will continue to be formed from reserve troops for the foreseeable future."
 swiss.22.a: "The people did not support it."

 swiss.23.t: "Referendum: The Status of Freemasonry"
 swiss.23.d: "Freemasonry has come into the public spotlight recently for its supposed connection to dangerous extremist movements and the prevalence of its members among higher levels of office. Freemasons are not believed by the state to be a real danger, but who really knows with such secretive societies? The public will have to say whether they are allowed to continue their practice within our borders. Should we support this referendum?"
 swiss.23.a: "No Campaigning."
 swiss.23.b: "Limited Campaigning."
 swiss.23.c: "Moderate Campaigning."
 swiss.23.e: "Extensive Campaigning."

 swiss.25.t: "The Freemasonry Referendum Succeeds"
 swiss.25.d: "The referendum has passed, and Freemasons have been barred from official meetings inside the nation. While there is likely little effect on the day-to-day of the government's operation, the public's support of the state has risen with the news."
 swiss.25.a: "Wonderful!"

 swiss.26.t: "The Freemasonry Referendum Fails"
 swiss.26.d: "The referendum to ban Freemasonry from Switzerland has failed. Is this the influence of the Freemasons at work?"
 swiss.26.a: "The people did not support it."

 swiss.27.t: "Referendum: On the Transport of Goods"
 swiss.27.d: "The referendum of the day has to do with the current system of transport of goods along Swiss roadways. The proposed referendum would change how these goods are to be moved, and would potentially increase the overall volume of trade along major roadways. Should we support this referendum?"
 swiss.27.a: "No Campaigning."
 swiss.27.b: "Limited Campaigning."
 swiss.27.c: "Moderate Campaigning."
 swiss.27.e: "Extensive Campaigning."

 swiss.29.t: "The Transportation Referendum Succeeds"
 swiss.29.d: "The referendum on the transportation of goods has succeeded, and our economy is likely to get a small boost from this."
 swiss.29.a: "Wonderful!"

 swiss.30.t: "The Transportation Referendum Fails"
 swiss.30.d: "The referendum on the transport of goods has failed. The roads will remain unchanged, for now."
 swiss.30.a: "The people did not support it."

 swiss.31.t: "Referendum: Abolish the Federal Government"
 swiss.31.d: "There is a heavy atmosphere over the crowds today as the nation moves forward with a referendum to abolish the current federal government, and invite the leading representatives from the nation's strongest Trade Unions to draft the foundation of a new government. French "allied" military personnel and observers are seen in full force throughout important civilian centres, and many know that a vote against the change is fruitless. The old Swiss government is no more."
 swiss.31.a: "Is this truly a fair vote?"

 swiss.33.t: "The Government Referendum Succeeds"
 swiss.33.d: "It was truly a bizarre sight, as bands played bombastic tunes and parades were held to mostly unenthusiastic crowds in the wake of the referendum's success. The new Swiss government is to be formed shortly, but many in the conservative German East of the nation find nothing to celebrate."
 swiss.33.a: "As if there was any doubt."

 swiss.34.t: "Switzerland Seeks to Join the Internationale"
 swiss.34.d: "After the recent Syndicalist revolution rocked our small eastern neighbour, many assumed it would only be a matter of time before they joined the Third Internationale. Today is that day, as Swiss diplomats have officially requested that the nation be allowed into our alliance."
 swiss.34.a: "Of course!"
 swiss.34.b: "We don't need them."

 swiss.35.t: "The French have Accepted"
 swiss.35.d: "After our formal request to join the Third Internationale, the French have responded positively, accepting us into the alliance."
 swiss.35.a: "Our brothers!"

 swiss.36.t: "Our Membership has been Declined"
 swiss.36.d: "Despite the fact that we share ideological similarities as well as a land border, the French have refused to accept us into their international alliance. For what reason could they have they done this?"
 swiss.36.a: "Impossible!"

 swiss.37.t: "Switzerland Seeks Protection"
 swiss.37.d: "A diplomatic envoy arrived today from Switzerland with a missive explaining that the current government of Switzerland has found a need to join our military alliance. How should we respond?"
 swiss.37.a: "They made a wise decision."
 swiss.37.b: "They would only drag us down."

 swiss.38.t: "We Stand with Germany"
 swiss.38.d: "Our diplomat to Berlin has sent news that Germany has issued a formal invitation to their international alliance and welcomed us with open arms. We are now a proper member state of the Reichspakt."
 swiss.38.a: "Our future is bright."

 swiss.39.t: "Germany has Ignored Us!"
 swiss.39.d: "Despite our diplomat's best efforts, we have been unable to get an official response from Germany with regards to our acceptance into the Reichspakt. It seems that the Germans are keen on keeping us out of their alliance."
 swiss.39.a: "But why?"

 swiss.40.t: "Nationalist Coup"
 swiss.40.d: "Before dawn broke over the governmental offices in the capital, it was already over. The Schweizerischer Vaterländischer Verband, a populist movement that held large influence over governmental affairs through its extensive membership in both the military and high government offices, had moved in the earliest hours of the morning to secure all necessary locations to ensure a successful coup. Hand-picked military units held important locations throughout the capital and the rest of the nation, and not a single shot was fired, nor a single life lost.\n\nThe previous government's failure to both protect the Swiss people in Romandie and secure foreign assistance against such a move had made it obvious to the Schweizerischer Vaterländischer Verband that the current government has failed completely, and only an entirely new government could hope to revitalise the Swiss nation.\n\nOne only hopes that their nationalistic tendencies can be kept in check."
 swiss.40.a: "Switzerland needs no allies."

 swiss.43.t: "Switzerland Calls for Aid!"
 swiss.43.d: "Switzerland, the small mountain nation in the centre of Europe, has sent out a moving plea for assistance against the imperialistic actions of the French Commune. As we are one of the major powers of the world, accepting would show our support against French imperialism. Should we help the Swiss in their moment of need?"
 swiss.43.notfrance: "Switzerland, the small mountain nation in the centre of Europe, has sent out a moving plea for assistance in their ongoing war. Switzerland is a small country with few resources, and it unlikely to win the war on their own without international assistance. As we are one of the major powers of the world, accepting would show our support against French imperialism. Should we help the Swiss in their moment of need?"
 swiss.43.a: "And we will answer!"
 swiss.43.b: "They are on their own."
 swiss.43.c: "We have our own war to fight."

 swiss.45.t: "Black Monday hits Switzerland"
 swiss.45.d: "The recent run on the Berlin Stock Exchange is not without consequences for Switzerland. The Swiss economy relies heavily on German trading and the collapse of the German markets has sent immediate shock-waves through the Swiss economy. We must act if we are to save our economy from total collapse."
 swiss.45.a: "The horror!"

 swiss.46.t: "Switzerland joins the Vienna Circle"
 swiss.46.d: "Responding to our calls for Europe's best and brightest to join our research initiative in Vienna, our friends the Swiss have responded favourably and have sent a handful of researchers to contribute to our initiative. Together we will make great discoveries in the name of scientific advancement."
 swiss.46.a: "Fantastic."

 swiss.48.t: "The Foundation of the Helvetic Commune"
 swiss.48.d: "Emotions were largely muted at the official signing of the papers that would make the new Helvetic Commune the official government in Switzerland, cementing the power of Syndicalism in governmental structure for the foreseeable future. Drawing on inspiration from the Helvetic Republic of old, the new Directorate promises to lead the Swiss people in a fashion that will benefit all Swiss people, and uphold their values for decades to come."
 swiss.48.a: "A new dawn awaits!"

 swiss.49.t: "The Birth of the Helvetic Commune"
 swiss.49.d: "Thunderous applause from the steps of the capital building as Jakob Herzog was sworn in as the first and sole Director of the new Helvetic Commune. Rising to prominence on a wave of popularity due to his advocacy of the "Strong Hand" approach to revitalising Switzerland, the new Director has made promises that the mistakes of old will not be repeated, and that the new Helvetic Commune will stand tall as a proper power in Europe."
 swiss.49.a: "Herzog is our future!"

 swiss.50.t: "A New Official Capital?"
 swiss.50.d: "With the foundation of a new government and a new future for Switzerland, a motion has been put forward to move the nation's official capital from its old seat in Bern to a more appropriate location in Geneva. The Genenva Council of State has been handling the government's duties effectively so far, and Geneva has long been the centre of Syndicalist movements in Switzerland. Many feel that this move would cement Switzerland's future as a proper Syndicalist nation. What should we do?"
 swiss.50.a: "The capital will move to Geneva."
 swiss.50.b: "The capital will stay in Bern."

 swiss.51.t: "The [GetYear] Swiss Federal Elections"
 swiss.51.d: "The time has come again for the people of Switzerland to vote, and decide which party will seize the majority in the National Council. Only one party can come out on top, which will it be?"
 swiss.51.a: "Sozialdemokratische Partei der Schweiz!"
 swiss.51.b: "Liberale Partei der Schweiz!"
 swiss.51.c: "Freisinnig-Demokratische Partei!"
 swiss.51.e: "Katholisch-Konservative Partei der Schweiz!"
 #swiss.51.f: "Bauern-, Gewerbe- und Bürgerpartei!"

 swiss.52.t: "Looking for Foreign Assistance"
 swiss.52.d: "With the French bearing down upon us, we must look to our neighbours for assistance in the defence of Switzerland. Facing down the might of the French Commune is no easy task, and it is unlikely that we will be defended, but we must try all the same."
 swiss.52.a: "Look to Germany for aid."
 swiss.52.b: "The powers of the world have their own struggles."
 swiss.52.c: "The Austrians are no friends of the French."

 swiss.54.t: "Switzerland Calls for Austrian Aid"
 swiss.54.d: "Earlier today envoys from Switzerland arrived to plead for Austrian backing against French threats to seize the Romandie region. While we have little to gain from supporting such a venture, throwing our support behind the Swiss cause could boost our prestige worldwide and show the French that the Austrian Empire is not to be trifled with. Backing the Swiss in such a manner would certainly place them in our debt..."
 swiss.54.a: "We will back the Swiss in this conflict."
 swiss.54.b: "We really have nothing to gain from this."
 swiss.55.b: "Then we shall crush them both!"

 swiss.56.t: "The Austrian Empire Stands with Switzerland"
 swiss.56.d: "In response to the brewing conflicts in Romandie and Haute-Savoie, the Austrian Empire has officially declared its support of the Swiss people against us. If we are to continue forward with our demands against the Swiss, it could result in a conflict of arms against Austria. The Austrians are a power to be reckoned with, can we afford a war so early?"
 swiss.56.a: "The Austrians are not to be trifled with."
 swiss.56.b: "It is time we show them who is the true power in Europe."

 swiss.58.t: "Austria Remains Neutral"
 swiss.58.d: "Despite the just nature of our cause, the Austrians have failed to come to our aid against the French menace. We cannot rely on the Habsburgs to assist us."
 swiss.58.a: "Curses!"

 swiss.59.t: "Looking Again for Foreign Aid"
 swiss.59.d: "With our most recent diplomatic efforts not turning out the way we had hoped, we likely only have one more chance to appeal to a foreign power before we run out of time..."

 swiss.60.t: "We Have Been Abandoned"
 swiss.60.d: "Despite our best efforts to gain international support for our cause, it seems that no nation is willing to stand for justice against the imperialism of the French Commune. We have been abandoned by our neighbours, and there is no choice left but to give in to the French demands. We cannot hope to win on our own."
 swiss.60.a: "We are surrounded by enemies on all sides."

 swiss.61.t: "Revolution in Switzerland"
 swiss.61.d: "Despite our initial intentions of only inciting revolt in Haute-Savoie, it seems that our efforts to destabilise Switzerland have exceeded our wildest expectations. Rather than stopping in the Western cantons and holding their ground, revolutionary forces have instead advanced east, bolstered by local support and army defections. These forces have successfully toppled the Federal Government in Bern, and are now looking to us for support of their new government."
 swiss.61.a: "Wonderful!"

 swiss.62.t: "Syndicalist Uprising"
 swiss.62.d: "What initially appeared as fringe uprising in the Western cantons has spread like wildfire east, with Syndicalist supporters rising to support an ever-growing flood of revolutionary sentiment that has swept through the nation. The army, feebly led and unwilling to take decisive action against the civilians, has been wholly ineffective at stopping their march on the capital. As the sun rises, a new, Syndicalist government claims control of the nation."
 swiss.62.a: "How could this have happened?"

 swiss.63.t: "Crisis in Haute-Savoie"
 swiss.63.d: "With the rising escalations in the Romandie and Haute-Savoie regions and France's seeming willingness to intervene in our internal affairs, the situation in Haute-Savoie looks grim. It is only a matter of time before the situation spirals out of our control. We must prepare for the worst."
 swiss.63.a: "Worrisome."

 swiss.64.t: "France Demands Reforms"
 swiss.64.d: "Sensing our apparent weakness and willingness to surrender to their terms, France has responded to our offer to surrender Haute-Savoie with incredulity, informing us that our response is "insincere" and obviously insufficient to guarantee the rights of Syndicalist supporters not only in Romandie, but in the whole of Switzerland. They have offered to send "advisors" to our nation in order to ensure that the proper reforms are passed "for the good of all Swiss peoples"."
 swiss.64.a: "This is the only way to avoid bloodshed."

 swiss.65.t: "The Swiss Give In"
 swiss.65.d: "After we properly informed the Swiss that their proposal to cede Haute-Savoie was not in our best interests, they have further shown their weakness and aversion to conflict by agreeing to our proposals of instituting reforms in the nation to protect the rights of Syndicalists in the nation. No doubt these reforms will lead to the eventual supremacy of Syndicalism in the nation, and the Swiss will surely drift into our own sphere of influence."
 swiss.65.a: "The revolution spreads!"

 swiss.66.t: "War with France!"
 swiss.66.d: "Despite our best efforts to both gain international support for our cause and prevent any bloodshed, both our trustworthy ally and France have both refused to back down. It seems that we must fight to maintain our independence from French aggression."
 swiss.66.a: "We will defend ourselves to the end."

 swiss.68.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Backs Our Position"
 swiss.68.d: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] has agreed to back our position in our diplomatic conflict against France. Hopefully we will not need them to resolve this peacefully."
 swiss.68.a: "We owe them a great deal."

 swiss.69.t: "A Meeting of Officers"
 swiss.69.d: "We have received suspicious reports of large meetings of military officers meeting late in the evenings, and long into the night. While this is not a cause for concern in and of itself, the fact that all of these men are members of the Schweizerischer Vaterländischer Verband has caused some in the National Council to take note. Could the officers be planning something?"
 swiss.69.a: "Worrisome."

 swiss.70.t: "Selection of a General"
 swiss.70.d: "In times of peace and stability the highest attainable rank in the Swiss military is that of Lieutenant General, although the role is more of a Senior Colonel than a General. Only in times of great need or looming military conflict is a man promoted to the rank of General in order to lead the defence of the nation. Now that we have been thrust into a time of great crisis, it is time for us to select a General to lead the command of our armed forces."
 swiss.70.a: "Time to choose."

 swiss.71.t: "Die Arbeiterwache Rally"
 swiss.71.d: "Earlier today fringe Syndicalist paramilitaries "Die Arbeiterwache" held a rally in the streets of Geneva against the "wilful suppression" of the Swiss workers by the current government. While such a fringe rally would normally be of no concern, the sheer amount of people in attendance has caught the government's eye.\n\nThousands of people were in attendance, seemingly hanging on every word of the main speaker, Jakob Herzog. It seems that Syndicalist sentiment is more prevalent in the West than we previously thought."
 swiss.71.a: "We will have to keep an eye on them."

 swiss.72.t: "Vorarlberg Defects"
 swiss.72.d: "With our neighbour Austria on the verge of complete collapse in their ongoing war, some of its citizens have taken their futures into their own hands. The Bundesland of Vorarlberg, right on our eastern border with Austria, has held a public referendum to leave Austria behind and seek union with Switzerland.\n\nOver 80% of voters agreed with the proposal, and the local authorities have wasted no time pleading their case with us, hoping to avoid whatever cruel peace awaits them if Austria were to fall in their current war. The citizens of Vorarlberg are certainly willing, should we accept this new member of the Swiss state?"
 swiss.72.a: "We gladly accept."
 swiss.72.b: "It is too risky."

 swiss.73.t: "Vorarlberg's Defection"
 swiss.73.d: "It is no secret that things are not going well in the current war. Many key cities across the empire are in our enemy's hands, and morale is low. However, news has now reached us that the traitorous province of Vorarlberg has voted to leave the Empire entirely, and joined Switzerland instead!\n\nCan these traitors not see that a turn of fortunes is soon on its way? We will have to deal with these traitors, in time."
 swiss.73.a: "Damn them!"

 swiss.74.t: "Germany has Intervened in the Crisis"
 swiss.74.d: "Despite not directly asking for their backing, it seems that the German Kaiser has seen the need to protect the order in Europe, and has intervened on our behalf against the Syndicalist menace. Could this turn the tide against the French hordes?"
 swiss.74.a: "Wonderful!"

 swiss.75.t: "Germany has Intervened Against Us"
 swiss.75.d: "Despite the Swiss not asking for their assistance, the German Kaiser, delusional in his power, has seen fit to throw his nation into war against our glorious crusade. Surely this is the end of Germany's reign over Europe."
 swiss.75.a: "German dogs!"

 swiss.76.t: "The End of Swiss Neutrality"
 swiss.76.d: "Despite our best efforts to avoid foreign entanglements, Switzerland has found itself caught up in the machinations of foreign powers. Our neutrality, maintained for over a hundred years, has finally been broken as our government has been brought into alignment with [SWI.faction_leader.GetNameDef]"
 swiss.76.a: "Will they be able to protect us better than neutrality?"

 swiss.78.t: "The Government Moves to Geneva"
 swiss.78.d: "With the collapse of the government in Bern following the Syndicalist uprising, a loose coalition of Unions was formed to handle governmental affairs. It has become painfully apparent that this haphazard group of Unions is not capable of running the government and all its functions.\n\nInstead, a new government has been formed under the guidance of the Genenva Council of State, with the assistance of the French Commune. This new government will operate the state until a proper constitution can be formed for the new Switzerland."
 swiss.78.a: "We are in their hands."

 swiss.79.t: "The End of Swiss Neutrality"
 swiss.79.d: "Despite our best efforts to avoid foreign entanglements and conflicts, Switzerland has found itself embroiled in a war. Our neutrality, maintained for over a hundred years, has finally been broken as men young and old are called up in service of their country."
 swiss.79.a: "Today, we fight."

 swiss.80.t: "Jakob Herzog visits Britain"
 swiss.80.d: "In response to an invitation by 'Vanguardist' elements in Britain, local Syndicalist agitator Jakob Herzog, leader of the radical Die Arbeiterwache party, has left the nation in order to meet with his ideological comrades.\n\nOnce an anarcho-syndicalist, Herzog's political leanings have become increasingly more radical and his supporters more numerous. His advocacy for an even more extreme form of Syndicalism can only bring further unrest to the nation."
 swiss.80.a: "We'll keep an eye on him."

 swiss.81.t: "Herzog visits Mussolini"
 swiss.81.d: "After his rapid ascention to power in former Switzerland, leader Jakob Herzog found time today to fulfil a task of the usual diplomatic affairs in an official state visit to the Italian Socialist Republic. While there was the usual pomp and circumstance in the visit, Herzog made it quite clear that he was here more so to solidify relations with Italy, over any personal desires.\n\nHerzog was reported to have nothing but praise for the Italian head of state, who in turn seemed to enjoy the generous compliments. Together, the two promised 'a new era in Helvetic-Italian relations' and increased cooperation between the two Totalist nations."
 swiss.81.a: "To future cooperation!"

 swiss.82.t: "Protests against German Favouritism"
 swiss.82.d: "An organised protest was held today in the capital against the state's new policies on official languages. Thousands of Swiss citizens who speak French, Italian, or Romansch in their daily lives were seen chanting anti-government slogans and disrupting traffic around the city.\n\nRomansch speakers in particular are incited over the change, given that their language was made official via referendum in Switzerland only a year ago. Local forces are more than prepared to handle protests of these size, but the people have made their displeasure known to the government."
 swiss.82.a: "That was then, this is now."

 swiss.83.t: "Loyalty in the Officer Corps"
 swiss.83.d: "With the government firmly in the hands of the proper German-Swiss authorities, it has come to the attention of many in the upper echelons of the new government that there are officers in the Swiss army with questionable loyalties.\n\nThe loss of Switzerland's non-German speaking territories is a blow the strength of the nation, however the greater threat of disloyal officers still looms. An internal review of officers born in Romandie and other French-speaking regions of the nation has begun, and those viewed to be potential threats are to be detained."
 swiss.83.a: "Weeds in the garden."

 swiss.84.t: "The Bern Trials"
 swiss.84.d: "After a lengthy internal review of the Swiss Officer Corps, officers loyal to the state have compiled a definitive list of those deemed potential threats to the new military government. Dozens of officers from French or Italian backgrounds, or those known to harbour Syndicalist leanings, have been detained and brought before a special military tribunal in Bern.\n\nThe show trials of these officers will strengthen the loyalty of the current officer corps to the state and ensure that any future officers know that treason will not be tolerated. However, many officers in custody hold high office within the military, and the removal of these officers is sure to dampen the strength of our forces."
 swiss.84.a: "Let the trials begin."

 swiss.85.t: "The Trial of Gustave Combe"
 swiss.85.d: "The trial has begun for Major General Gustave Combe, born in Orbe to a French-speaking family. His preference for French and potential loyalty to his family in French-occupied Romandie has marked him as a potential liabilty in the new Swiss military.\n\nThe trial has commenced and the charges laid against him seem damning."
 swiss.85.a: "Guilty."
 swiss.85.b: "Combe is a man of character. Innocent!"

 swiss.86.t: "The Trial of Louis de Montmollin"
 swiss.86.d: "The trial has begun for Lieutenant Colonel Louis de Montmollin, a French speaking officer born in Savagnier, Neuchâtel. Montmollin is both from a French-speaking household hailing from the cantons lost to France, and has shown previous Syndicalist leanings, refusing to participate in military actions taken against Syndicalist supporters within the country.\n\nWith this information, the state has determined that Lieutenant Colonel de Montmollin is a great potential risk and must be removed from his post immediately."
 swiss.86.a: "Guilty."
 swiss.86.b: "Louis is a sterling officer. Innocent!"

 swiss.87.t: "The Trial of Henri Guisan"
 swiss.87.d: "The trial has begun for Lieutenant General Henri Guisan, distinguished Swiss Officer and the most high-ranking man brought in for trial.\n\nGuisan's arrest is undoubtedly politically motivated, due to his high position and Eugen Bircher's alleged distate of the man. Losing his talents would set our military back considerably.\n\nGuisan is beloved by both his men and acquaintances alike, and a sentence for him would be very unpopular. However, letting him go would show that the current government is perhaps not as powerful as they would have the people believe..."
 swiss.87.a: "Guilty."
 swiss.87.b: "Guisan deserves better. Innocent!"

 swiss.88.t: "Continuing the Trials"
 swiss.88.d: "The most high-proflie trials are over for now, but there are still many who must face the military's justice. Traitors and Syndicalists alike face trial, and perhaps a directive from the government could speed the process..."
 swiss.88.a: "Most are Guilty."
 swiss.88.b: "The rest are undoubtedly innocent."

 swiss.89.t: "The Trials Conclude"
 swiss.89.d: "After many long weeks of innocence and guilt, the trials of the Swiss Officer Corps are completed, and many have been either exonerated or retired. This process has ensured that the new Swiss military is one loyal to the state, but at what cost..."
 swiss.89.a: "We now stand united."

 swiss.90.t: "Defection of Loius de Montmollin"
 swiss.90.d: "Lieutenant Colonel Louis de Montmollin, after being declared innocent in the Bern Trials months before, has today been reported to have fled over the border into the Commune of France. He took with him several like-minded officers who either escaped arrest or were declared innocent in the trials, along with crucial information on our military deployments against the French.\n\nThe whole affair is seen as an embarrassment for the regime in Bern and many are wondering if the military are truly in control."
 swiss.90.a: "We were fools to trust him."

 swiss.91.t: "Ineffectual Purges"
 swiss.91.d: "After the widely publicised show trials in Bern, the government has almost nothing to show for their efforts. We failed to prosecute any officers of note, and the people have taken us to be utter buffoons. How could we hold such trials and make no convictions?"
 swiss.91.a: "We look like fools."

 swiss.92.t: "New Generation of Officers"
 swiss.92.d: "Months have passed, and a new generation of officers loyal to the state have entered the military. Month by month, the effects of the Bern Trials on our military effectiveness fade."
 swiss.92.a: "Loyal officers are good officers."

 swiss.93.t: "Swiss Officers Defect"
 swiss.93.d: "After the end of the Savoyard Crisis, the Swiss government to our east was quickly overthrown by pro-German military officers who felt that the government had failed them. Paranoid and angry at French-speaking Swiss for 'betraying' their nation, they quickly began purging French elements of their military structure.\n\nThis approach has obviously backfired, as today a group of former Swiss officers fled over the border into France, seeking asylum from their oppressive government. They bring with them many secret Swiss military documents, which will surely be of use to us."
 swiss.93.a: "Welcome, brothers."

 swiss.100.t: "Memories Fade"
 swiss.100.d: "With the bloodless resolution of the crisis in Haute-Savoie, Syndicalist agitations within the borders of our nation have faded. Old grudges have begun to be forgotten and a new period of unity is dawning. Those who remain as Syndicalist supporters have mostly begun resorting to more peaceable forms of political activism, and the political tension that once gripped the country is no more."
 swiss.100.a: "We are brothers."

 swiss.101.t: "France Loses Interest"
 swiss.101.d: "Despite increasing tensions between ourselves and the French commune over the status of Haute-Savoie, today we have learned that the French government has suddenly dropped all plans to incense activism inside of Switzerland. It seems that the government in Paris has become dissuaded from pursuing the matter further, content to simply rattle its sabre. We have dodged what could have become a major international crisis."
 swiss.101.a: "Luck is on our side."

 swiss.103.t: "The Savoyard Crisis Defused"
 swiss.103.d: "For many months, the regions of Romandie and Haute-Savoie have been gripped by tension as Swiss socialists have petitioned the Commune of France for annexation and intervention in order to unite the French speaking peoples under one banner. However, it appears that despite initial threats against the stability of the Swiss nation, no intervention seems forthcoming from the Commune. Lacking a serious supporter and seemingly acting against the wishes of the greater Swiss nation, today Syndicalist leaders have met with the Federal government for what appears to be the first of many negotiations to end the hostilities. It seems that peace has won the day, the crisis is over."
 swiss.103.a: "Peace reigns."

 swiss.104.t: "The Savoyard Crisis Defused"
 swiss.104.d: "Despite the earlier opportunity to support the French-speaking regions of Switzerland against their capitalist oppressors, we have not found supporting their movement in our best interests. Now news has come from Switzerland that Syndicalist revolutionaries in the nation, disheartened at our lack of support, have decided to enter formal negotiations with the Swiss federal government. Whatever comes of these talks, our chance to intervene has passed."
 swiss.104.a: "An opportunity lost."

 swiss.105.t: "Diplomatic Mission to the Commune"
 swiss.105.d: "Now that the crisis in Haute-Savoie has passed without bloodshed, there are many who have seen the extreme dangers of having an unfriendly power such as the Commune of France right on our border. The Federal Government has decided the only way to rectify this situation is to improve bilateral relations between ourselves and the French. An diplomatic mission has been sent to the Commune to attempt to defuse the hostilities."
 swiss.105.a: "Let's make the attempt."

 swiss.106.t: "Diplomatic Mission from Switzerland"
 swiss.106.d: "Swiss diplomats arrived today in Paris to discuss the state of relations between our two countries. Previously our two states were on opposite sides of the Savoyard Crisis, but now that the crisis is behind us, it seems that the Swiss are eager to get in our good graces."
 swiss.106.a: "Let's negotiate."
 swiss.106.b: "Swiss? We have no need of the Swiss."

 swiss.107.t: "Turned Away from Paris"
 swiss.107.d: "Despite the earnest efforts of our diplomatic team to the French Commune, the French seem unwilling to negotiate with us on restoring friendly relations. We will have to remain vigilant on our shared border."
 swiss.107.a: "A shame."

 swiss.108.t: "Extracting Concessions"
 swiss.108.d: "As the Swiss are more damaged by our poor bilateral relations, it is possible that they will agree to concessions in exchange for economic cooperation and the lifting of trade sanctions.\n\nOn the other hand, asking for too much threatens to leave the negotiations entirely. Should we make demands?"
 swiss.108.a: "Demand the return of Haute-Savoie."
 swiss.108.b: "Demand the concession of French Romandie."
 swiss.108.c: "Demand economic concessions."
 swiss.108.e: "Demand no concessions."

 swiss.109.t: "The French Demand Concessions"
 swiss.109.d: "After some initial negotiations, the French have come to us with an offer. They will negotiate in good faith, but any negotiations must be preceded by the concession of Haute-Savoie to the Commune. The Commune has declared that as the one and only legal French government, we are obligated to return Haute-Savoie under the terms of the Congress of Vienna. How should we respond?"
 swiss.109.a: "We must accept."
 swiss.109.b: "No!"
 swiss.109.c: "This is outrageous! We're leaving!"

 swiss.110.t: "The French Demand Concessions"
 swiss.110.d: "After some initial negotiations, the French have come to us with an offer. They will negotiate in good faith, but any negotiations must be preceded by the cession of Romandie to the Commune. France has claimed that the French-speaking majority, rife with Syndicalist supporters, belongs as a proper part of the French nation. How should we respond?"
 swiss.110.a: "We must accept."
 swiss.110.b: "No!"
 swiss.110.c: "This is outrageous! We're leaving!"

 swiss.111.t: "The French Demand Concessions"
 swiss.111.d: "After some initial negotiations, the French have come to us with an offer. They will negotiate in good faith, but any negotiations must be preceded by an agreement to economic concessions. Any trade deal we sign with the French will be required to assist them more than it assists us. How should we respond?"
 swiss.111.a: "We must accept."
 swiss.111.b: "No!"
 swiss.111.c: "This is outrageous! We're leaving!"

 swiss.113.t: "The Swiss are Outraged"
 swiss.113.d: "The Swiss response to our demands was one of complete shock. After hours of quiet discussion in private, the delegation has decided that our demands were simply insulting and belied an unwillingness to properly negotiate.\n\nThe entire delegation left soon after, and do not seem intent on returning for another round of talks."
 swiss.113.a: "Negotiations have broken down..."

 swiss.114.t: "Rejection of our Demands"
 swiss.114.d: "In response to our demands, the Swiss have soundly rejected any sort of concessions, and seem unwilling to consider the negotiations if concessions are on the table.\n\nThey are unlikely to back down on this stance."
 swiss.114.a: "They called our bluff. We will cooperate without concessions."
 swiss.114.b: "No concessions, no negotiations."

 swiss.115.t: "France Expels our Diplomats"
 swiss.115.d: "We have informed the French negotiators that we are unwilling to continue negotiations if the French are going to demand concessions. In response, the French have expelled our delegation and halted negotiations. There will be no deal with the French."
 swiss.115.a: "Unfortunate."

 swiss.116.t: "The nature of our Cooperation?"
 swiss.116.d: "After agreeing to the initial French demands, the ball is now in our court. Rather than simply restoring relations, it is possible that Switzerland and France can work together and create a relationship that will benefit us both. What sort of relationship should we pursue?"
 swiss.116.a: "Political Cooperation."
 swiss.116.b: "Technological Cooperation."
 swiss.116.c: "Economic Cooperation."
 swiss.116.e: "Just restoring trade will be enough."

 swiss.117.t: "Nature of Cooperation?"
 swiss.117.d: "The French have agreed to negotiate with us, and have made no unreasonable demands of us in the process!. Rather than simply restoring relations, it is possible that Switzerland and France can work together and create a relationship that will benefit us both. What sort of relationship should we pursue?"
 swiss.117.a: "Political Cooperation."
 swiss.117.b: "Technological Cooperation."
 swiss.117.c: "Economic Cooperation."
 swiss.117.e: "Just restoring trade will be enough."

 swiss.118.t: "End of Negotiations"
 swiss.118.political: "The Swiss have returned to the discussion with an offer of political cooperation. Both of our nations will open an official embassy with the other and trade will be restored. Both nations promise to foster improved relations with the other. With this new deal, both of our nations will gain from the deal."
 swiss.118.techno: "The Swiss have returned to the discussion with an offer of technological cooperation. Both of our nations will cooperate on technological development with the other and trade will be restored. With this new deal, both of our nations will gain from the deal."
 swiss.118.economo: "The Swiss have returned to the discussion with an offer of political cooperation. Both of our nations will cooperate on economic development and trade will be restored. With this new deal, both of our nations will gain from the deal."
 swiss.118.nothin: "The Swiss have returned to the discussion with an offer of political cooperation. Trade will be restored between our two nations. With this new deal, both of our nations will gain from the deal."
 swiss.118.a: "We agree to the terms."

 swiss.119.t: "Successful Negotiations"
 swiss.119.d: "Despite the political and military differences between ourselves and the Swiss, the negotiations have gone a long way towards restoring normal relations. We will see how the fruits of these negotiations fare in the coming months."
 swiss.119.a: "The Swiss have made amends."

 swiss.120.t: "Successful Negotiations"
 swiss.120.d: "Despite the political and military differences between ourselves and the French Commune, the negotiations have gone a long way towards restoring normal relations. Hopefully this negotiated peace will last."
 swiss.120.a: "The political freeze is over."

 swiss.121.t: "Switzerland Recognises the Commune"
 swiss.121.d: "We have received news that as part of a negotiated deal with the Commune of France, the Swiss government has officially recognised the Commune of France as the legitimate French government. This leaves us in an awkward position, as the Swiss government previously recognised us as the sole legitimate government of France.\n\nWe will not forget this slight!"
 swiss.121.a: "Damn them!"

 swiss.122.t: "Peace with the Commune?"
 swiss.122.d: "We have gone to war in defence of the small Swiss nation against the Commune of France. Initially, we had hoped to hold the French at the border, and force them into a negotiated peace that would ensure the integrity of the Swiss nation.\n\nThis plan has failed, and as we speak enemies march into Austria itself! We must sue for a negotiated peace now before it is too late."
 swiss.122.a: "Sue for peace."
 swiss.122.b: "Peace?! Never!"

 swiss.123.t: "Austria Sues for Peace"
 swiss.123.d: "Our war of liberation against Switzerland and their Austrian allies is going well. So well, in fact, that the Austrians have come to us with an offer of peace. Austria itself is being invaded, and Vienna is looking to get out of this unfavourable war.\n\nIt is obvious that they are on the losing end of this war, and it should be possible to extract heavy concessions out of them if we so choose. How should we respond?"
 swiss.123.a: "White Peace will do fine."
 swiss.123.b: "Demand heavy concessions."
 swiss.123.c: "There will be no peace but our victory!"

 swiss.124.t: "An Offer of White Peace"
 swiss.124.d: "France has responded to our request for a negotiated peace by offering us favourable terms. White peace between ourselves and the French Commune, but Switzerland will be left to the French will.\n\nConsidering our military situation, it seems like the best offer we will ever get..."
 swiss.124.a: "We Accept!"
 swiss.124.b: "We can't betray Switzerland!"

 swiss.125.t: "An Offer of A Harsh Peace"
 swiss.125.d: "France has responded to our request for a negotiated peace by offering us harsh terms. We will be forced to cut all ties with the Italian Republic, and be forced to cede some land to France's new regime in former Switzerland. Switzerland itself will be left to suffer whatever fate the Commune dreams for it. We will pay minor economic reparations for our part in the war.\n\nConsidering our military situation, it seems like a decent offer..."
 swiss.125.a: "We Accept."
 swiss.125.b: "These terms are unacceptable!"

 swiss.126.t: "No Peace!"
 swiss.126.d: "The French have completely refused to negotiate any sort of peace with us, stating that the only peace we will receive is one dictated to us from our own halls in Vienna. The French will not negotiate with us."
 swiss.126.a: "We will not lose!"

 swiss.127.t: "Austria Accepts White Peace"
 swiss.127.d: "The Austrians were all to eager to accept our offer of a white peace, even if it means leaving the Swiss to their fate. Peace will be signed with the Austrians, and we will have a free hand to do as we like with the Swiss."
 swiss.127.a: "A wise choice."

 swiss.128.t: "Austrian Betrayal"
 swiss.128.d: "The war was certainly not going well, but the latest news from Vienna is simply shocking. The Austrians have signed a peace agreement with the French. And even worse, they have agreed to let the French do as they will with our nation. It seems as though this is the end for our nation..."
 swiss.128.a: "Enemies on all sides!"

 swiss.129.t: "Our Terms Rejected"
 swiss.129.d: "Despite being the nation to initiate the process of peace, the Austrians have rejected the terms we so politely offered them, and instead have insisted on seeing this war to its conclusion.\n\nThey will soon know the error of their ways."
 swiss.129.a: "War it is, then."

 swiss.130.t: "Austria Surrenders"
 swiss.130.d: "Austria, seeing the dire situation they are in, have accepted our most generous terms and will cede all of the territory we have requested of them. In addition, Switzerland has been abandoned to its fate and is ours to do with as we please.\n\nOur allies the Socialist Republic of Italy will be most ecstatic to hear this news."
 swiss.130.a: "A nice bonus."

 swiss.131.t: "Austria and Italy"
 swiss.131.d: "Unbeknownst to us, the Austrians and French have been engaged in a series of peace talks regarding their current conflict over Switzerland. A peace deal has been reached, and France has secured us an agreement which will see the Austrians revoking all support from [ITA.GetNameDef]. It is only a matter of time before that false state flounders without its master's strings."
 swiss.131.a: "A true ally"

 swiss.132.t: "Austrian Evacuation"
 swiss.132.d: "The Austrians and French have been engaged in a series of peace talks regarding their current conflict over Switzerland and, while the peace deal has been reached, the Austrians have not come out on top. As a part of the agreement, they will be forced to sever all ties with us. Times are grim."
 swiss.132.a: "Damn"

 swiss.133.t: "Swiss-Germans Flee Syndicalist Rule"
 swiss.133.d: "With the new Syndicalist regime seizing control of Switzerland, there are many who have something to fear from the changing of the guard. Thousands of Swiss, fearing Syndicalist reprisals, have fled over the border into Germany seeking the protection of the German Empire."
 swiss.133.a: "We didn't need them."

 swiss.134.t: "Swiss Refugees"
 swiss.134.d: "With the Swiss government overthrown by Syndicalist rebels, there is chaos in many predominantly German cities in Switzerland. Many, fearing punitive action from the new government, have fled across the border into Germany and are seeking the protection of the Kaiser from the Syndicalist menace."
 swiss.134.a: "Welcome them."

 swiss.135.t: "The Red Cross"
 swiss.135.d: "The Second Weltkrieg has begun, and the Red Cross, based in Geneva, has begun to organise in response to the predicted casualties. The Red Cross will help both sides in the war, taking no sides, and surely countless lives will be saved by their efforts.\n\nIn the last war, Red Cross societies delivered tens of millions of letters and parcels, sent out millions of Francs in aid, facilitated the transfer of hundreds of thousands of prisoners, and saved countless lives.\n\nLet us hope that they will not need to do as much in this war."
 swiss.135.a: "War is hell."

 swiss.136.t: "Defeat in Switzerland?"
 swiss.136.d: "In what was widely considered by the High Command to be a quick and easy war, we have found ourselves on the back foot in our fight against the Swiss and their Austrian defenders. In order to save face in the international community, many have suggested we sue for peace immediately before our ineptitude on the battlefield becomes internationally observed."
 swiss.136.a: "Sue for peace."
 swiss.136.b: "Never!"

 swiss.137.t: "France Begs for Mercy"
 swiss.137.d: "There are high spirits all around as a French delegation arrived today with the intent to negotiate a peace between our two nations. It is no secret that the war is going very poorly for the French, and they are surely eager to end the war as soon as possible.\n\nThis would be a great opportunity to demand more out of them..."
 swiss.137.a: "Peace is enough."
 swiss.137.b: "Seize the rest of Savoie."
 swiss.137.c: "We're marching to Paris!"

 swiss.138.t: "Switzerland Accepts White Peace"
 swiss.138.d: "Switzerland has responded favourably to our request for a settled peace, it seems that they are as eager to end the war as we are. All land gained or lost during the course of the conflict is to be returned to its original owner, and both sides are to return and lick their wounds. The war is over."
 swiss.138.a: "We got off easy."

 swiss.139.t: "Switzerland Demands Savoie"
 swiss.139.d: "The Swiss are willing to accept our offer of peace, but only on the condition that we hand over stewardship of the rest of the Savoie region. They do have a legal claim to the region, dating back to 1815 and the Congress of Vienna, but this is an obviously opportunistic land grab.\n\nHowever, in our current situation, we are not in a position to refuse their demand. They could certainly have demanded worse..."
 swiss.139.a: "We have no choice."

 swiss.140.t: "Switzerland Refuses Peace"
 swiss.140.d: "Despite our generous offer of peace in the face of the Swiss advance, we have received news that the Swiss are refusing any and all offers of peace. It seems that the mad Swiss are so confident in their invincibility that they think they can defeat the whole Commune. We will take pleasure in destroying these fools."
 swiss.140.a: "They are overconfident buffoons."

 swiss.141.t: "Peace with [FROM.GetNonIdeologyName]!"
 swiss.141.d.switzerland: "We have come out victorious in the war against [FROM.GetNonIdeologyName]! The people are cheering in the streets and parades are being held in honour of our victorious troops all around the nation. It is time to celebrate!"
 swiss.141.d.other: "News has arrived today that Switzerland has reached a negotiated peace with [FROM.GetNonIdeologyName]. This is a victory for both ourselves and the Swiss, and the syndicalist menace has shown its weakness for all the world to see!"
 swiss.141.a: "Peace is restored."

 swiss.143.t: "Occupation of Haute-Savoie"
 swiss.143.d: "In 1815 at the Congress of Vienna Switzerland was given the legal right to maintain the neutrality of Haute-Savoie in exchange for relinquishing all official claims on the region. During the Weltkrieg, as France was falling to Syndicalist revolutionaries, the Swiss government found it necessary to send soldiers to protect the region from the chaotic violence of the time.\n\nShortly after, the true French government was exiled to Africa, and Switzerland has maintained her military occupation of the region until a time that France returns to the mainland to reclaim it.\n\nThis of course has not sat well with the current government in Paris, which has actively attempted to reclaim the province."
 swiss.143.a: "We will fulfil our legal mandate."

 swiss.144.t: "KKP and BGB Leave the Bourgeois Block"
 swiss.144.d: "The Bourgeois Block, the informal alliance of the popular Market Liberal FDP with the BGB and KKP conservative parties, has long stood as the most stalwart of Swiss political institutions, working to ensure that conservative interests are satisfied and that aggressive Radical Socialist and Syndicalist parties remain marginalised. Today that relationship was severed as the Catholic-Conservative Party (KKP) and the Party of Farmers, Traders and Independents (BGB) announced their loss of confidence in FDP's ability to handle the economy in the wake of the Black Monday disaster.\n\nWith Switzerland's greatest political parties beginning to fight amongst themselves rather than against socialism, there will be room for smaller parties to make their move."
 swiss.144.a: "We are in a precarious situation."

 swiss.145.t: "Swiss National Day"
 swiss.145.d: "August 1st, is the Schweizer Bundesfeier, the anniversary of the signing of the Federal Charter of 1291, and is cause for celebration across the nation!"
 swiss.145.a: "Go us!"

 swiss.146.t: "Eugen Bircher speaks against Syndicalists"
 swiss.146.d: "Eugen Bircher, an influential Major General in the Swiss military, made a speech today in front of the National Council, wherein he plead with the council to 'slay the beast' that was the Syndicalist movements spreading within the nation.\n\nEugen Bircher leads the Schweizerischer Vaterländischer Verband, a paramilitary pro-German society that has been gaining influence among prominent Swiss military officers and politicians.\n\nThe Major General has been increasingly vocal both in public and in private of his distaste for Syndicalist and Socialist movements in Switzerland, and his opinion holds considerable sway."
 swiss.146.a: "Hm."

 swiss.150.t: "New Political Rivalries"
 swiss.150.d: "With the old Federal government overthrown by proper Syndicalists and a new interim government created in its place, a clear struggle is forming between the two main Syndicalist parties for control.\n\nOne is the Die Arbeiterwache under Jakob Herzog, adherents of more authoritarian socialism. Their main opponents are the SPdS, the more mainstream Syndicalist party under Jules Humbert-Droz.\n\nWith the need to form a new government apparent, both sides have been rallying their supporters in a bid to be the first party come out on top."
 swiss.150.a: "Why can't we get along?"

 swiss.151.t: "Die Arbeiterwache March"
 swiss.151.d: "The Die Arbeiterwache party, not wanting to wait for official discussions, got off to a head start today as party leaders organised a large march through the capital's streets. Thousands were in attendance and Die Arbeiterwache has shown that it has the support of many Swiss citizens."
 swiss.151.a: "Herzog takes the lead."

 swiss.152.t: "Jules Humbert-Droz Speaks Against Authoritarianism"
 swiss.152.d: "Not content to allow the Die Arbeiterwache to simply walk away with the nation, today Jules Humbert-Droz broadcast a powerful radio address to the nation.\n\nIn his speech, he rallied against the extremist messages of Die Arbeiterwache, and warned that supporting such a party would betray the true spirit of the revolution. Many have been swayed by the SPdS leader's message and Herzog's support has fallen overnight."
 swiss.152.a: "A fair point."

 swiss.153.t: "Violence in Bern"
 swiss.153.d: "In recent weeks, both the Totalist Die Arbeiterwache and the more traditionalist SPdS parties have been working hard to show themselves as the front running party in the movement to assemble the new government.\n\nWith such a close race, tensions are bound to be high, and today a violent fight erupted in Bern between supporters of the two groups. Similar bouts of violence have been popping up around the nation, and the Union Council is beginning to worry that the violence will only escalate from here."
 swiss.153.a: "Order is breaking down."

 swiss.154.t: "The Union Council Calls for Formal Debate"
 swiss.154.d: "In an effort to stop the violence spreading across the nation, the temporary Union Council has stepped into the fray in an attempt to resolve things peacefully. It has called upon both parties to agree to a series of formal debates, to be broadcast nationally over radio, in which both parties will attempt to state their case to the general populace.\n\nTo everyone's relief, the leaders of both parties have agreed and the debates are set to begin shortly."
 swiss.154.a: "Let's settle this peacefully."

 swiss.155.t: "The Debate Begins"
 swiss.155.d: "Tonight marked the first round of the formal debates being held between the Die Arbeiterwache led by Jakob Herzog and the SPdS led by Jules Humbert-Droz. Many topics were covered ranging from economic agenda to political reforms. While there are more debates to come, whoever is more successful in this first debate is likely to carry public support through subsequent debates.\n\nBoth potential leaders have good points but there can only be one winner."
 swiss.155.a: "Jakob Herzog is victorious!"
 swiss.155.b: "Jules Humbert-Droz has won!"

 swiss.156.t: "Die Arbeiterwache Wins Public Support"
 swiss.156.d: "Jakob Herzog's impassioned speech in the formal debate, combined with his multitude of rallies and marches, have shown the people of Switzerland that Die Arbeiterwache is the only party with enough support to form the new Syndicalist government. The need for a strong hand has taken hold of the nation."
 swiss.156.a: "Herzog will form the new government."

 swiss.157.t: "SPdS Wins Public Support"
 swiss.157.d: "With Jules Humbert-Droz's sterling performance in the governmental debate, and the passion of his speeches against authoritarianism and Jorges Herzog, the hearts of the people have moved behind the SPdS. Die Arbeiterwache remains popular, but it is obvious that it no longer has enough public support to take the lead in the new government."
 swiss.157.a: "Jules Humbert-Droz will form the new government."

 swiss.159.t: "Foundation of the Swiss Merchant Marine"
 swiss.159.d: "As Switzerland is a landlocked nation, it relies on trade with other nations to survive. To this end, the Swiss government has commissioned the purchase of several merchant vessels to operate under the Swiss flag.\n\nThese merchant vessels will participate in vital trade missions which will secure the necessary goods Switzerland needs to survive should her borders become compromised by conflict."
 swiss.159.a: "Interesting."

 swiss.160.t: "Christening of the EKS Helvetia"
 swiss.160.d: "There was much celebration and excitement today as the government announced the official christening of the Swiss Navy's first flagship, the EKS Helvetia. This ship, a Light Cruiser produced from Switzerland's very own dockyards, is the first official flagship of the fleet and a symbol of Switzerland's overseas ambitions."
 swiss.160.a: "The Swiss were born to sail."

 swiss.163.t: "Syndicalist Parties Banned"
 swiss.163.d: "With the new provisional military government in control of the nation, a proclamation has come from Bern that all Syndicalist organisations operating in the country, legally or otherwise, are to be immediately dissolved. This proclamation has been met with a surprising amount of popular support, as the remaining population of the country rallies against Syndicalist "traitors"."
 swiss.163.a: "We're better off without them."

 swiss.164.t: "Full Membership in Mitteleuropa"
 swiss.164.d: "An agreement has been made to allow for economic supplies to flow from Mitteleuropa into Switzerland to keep the nation afloat. However, while this temporary arrangement is supporting our economy for now, perhaps we should consider full membership in Germany's economic bloc?"
 swiss.164.a: "Let's join."
 swiss.164.b: "Rather not."

 swiss.165.t: "Farmers Hit by Black Monday"
 swiss.165.d: "With the German economy in freefall, the prices of many agricultural goods have fallen with it. Swiss farmers, heavily reliant on trade with Germany, have been hit hard almost overnight, and many have taken to the streets to protest the government's inaction over the issue. The BGB (Party of Farmers, Traders and Independents) who represents the interests of many Swiss farmers, and Social Conservative KKP (Catholic-Conservative Party) have begun wavering in their commitment to the current governing alliance of Conservative and Market Liberal parties."
 swiss.165.a: "This isn't good."

 swiss.166.t: "Socialists Propose Reconciliation With France"
 swiss.166.d: "As a part of their ambitious Syndicalist-styled plan to recover the Swiss economy, Socialist leaders in the Romandie have proposed that the Swiss government save the economy through reconciliation with the Commune of France.\n\nEver since Switzerland began the occupation of Haute-Savoie, the French have embargoed Switzerland, and cut off a valuable trade route for the Swiss economy. These socialist leaders have called for the return of this land to France as a sign of goodwill on behalf of Switzerland towards France."
 swiss.166.a: "Not a chance."

 swiss.167.t: "An Illegal Referendum in Savoie"
 swiss.167.d: "With the Federal Government in Bern so adamantly opposed to the Socialist plans for reform, a movement has gained popularity for an organised referendum on sovereignty in Haute-Savoie. The Socialists believe that if the Savoyards can be shown to wish reunification with the Commune of France, then the government will have to support their plans. Bern has caught wind of this illegal referendum taking place in the region soon, and has vowed that such a vote outside of the law will not be allowed to take place."
 swiss.167.a: "Stop this at once!"

 swiss.168.t: "Violence in Haute-Savoie"
 swiss.168.d: "The day of the proposed referendum has come, and violence runs rampant in Haute-Savoie. Swiss military presence in the occupied zone, on high alert on orders from Bern, has clashed repeatedly with Socialist and Syndicalist protestors attempting to organise the vote in the area.\n\nDozens have been beaten and bloodied, and the region is in a state of disarray as military forces and Socialist agitators from Romandie clash in the streets. It is only a matter of time before France hears of this commotion..."
 swiss.168.a: "This got out of hand."

 swiss.169.t: "Syndicalists Claim Referendum Victory"
 swiss.169.d: "Days after the violence in Savoie, the Syndicalist Party of Switzerland has declared that the results of the referendum are in and the region has voted to rejoin the Commune of France. In the chaos, it is impossible to verify the integrity of the vote, and the Socialists, who hold the ballots, have not offered to hand anything over to the federal government. Many in Bern doubt the validity of the Socialist claim, but it has increasingly seemed like a shouting match between two sides that won't back down..."
 swiss.169.a: "These results are illegal and unverified!"

 swiss.170.t: "Violence in Occupied Haute-Savoie"
 swiss.170.d: "Reports have come to Paris bearing news of the violent oppression of Syndicalist freedom fighters in Haute-Savoie who were attempting to organise a referendum on the region's return to French governance. The Swiss government in Bern has sent a military force to suppress the vote, and violence has broken out over the legality of the referendum. We can't ignore this violence against our people!"
 swiss.170.a: "Frenchmen bleed on French soil!"

 swiss.171.t: "Romandie Secedes"
 swiss.171.d: "With no nation willing to defend Switzerland, and our government's weakness exposed for all the world to see, the local governments in Romandie, reinstated by French demands, have quickly voted to secede from the Swiss Confederation and join the Commune of France. We are powerless to stop them."
 swiss.171.a: "Traitors, all of them."

 swiss.172.t: "The Romand Secession"
 swiss.172.d: "After Switzerland pathetically accepted our demands for the return of Haute-Savoie, they were forced to reinstate publicly elected Socialist officials that they so viciously removed from their posts earlier in the year. These politicians, to our surprise, wasted no time in voting on secession from the Swiss Confederation in favour of joining the Commune of France as brothers in French Socialism.\n\nWe of course have accepted their legal and popular move, and have welcomed them into our fold."
 swiss.172.a: "A welcome surprise."

 swiss.173.t: "A New National Identity"
 swiss.173.d: "With the transition of the Swiss State to a more orderly regime under the guidance of the military, many have proposed the creation of a new national flag to represent the new order. A few designs have surfaced as popular enough to represent the nation. Which one should we move forward with?"
 swiss.173.a: "We must maintain our current flag."
 swiss.173.b: "The coat of arms on white background."
 swiss.173.c: "The nationalist full-cross design."
 swiss.173.e: "A flag more suiting the military regime."

 swiss.174.t: "A New National Identity"
 swiss.174.d: "A new era has dawned for the Swiss people under the new Syndicalist regime, and with it comes the need for a new national symbol and flag. A few designs have surfaced as popular enough to represent the nation. Which one should we move forward with?"
 swiss.174.a: "The Helvetic Design with Syndicalist elements."
 swiss.174.b: "The simple Helvetic design."
 swiss.174.c: "Continue with the interim flag."
 swiss.174.e: "Flag of the Syndicalist Party of Switzerland."

 swiss.175.t: "Switzerland Seeks an Alliance"
 swiss.175.d: "A diplomatic envoy arrived today from Switzerland with a missive explaining that the current government of Switzerland has found a need to formalise our current relationship and join our new military alliance. How should we respond?"
 swiss.175.d_war: "A diplomatic envoy arrived today from Switzerland requesting we formalise our de-facto relationship, and allow them membership in our new military alliance. How should we respond?"
 swiss.175.a: "They made a wise decision."
 swiss.175.b: "They would only drag us down."

 swiss.176.t: "We Stand with Austria"
 swiss.176.d: "Our diplomat to Vienna has sent news that Austria has issued a formal invitation to their international alliance, and welcome us with open arms. We now have a proper protector against any further untoward aggression."
 swiss.176.d_war: "Our diplomat to Vienna has sent news that Austria has issued a formal invitation to their international alliance, and welcomes us with open arms."
 swiss.176.a: "Our future is bright."

 swiss.177.t: "Austria has Ignored Us!"
 swiss.177.d: "Despite our diplomat's best efforts, we have been unable to get an official response from Austria with regards to a formalisation of our current impromptu alliance. It seems that the Austrians are keen on keeping us out of their alliance, whatever reason they may have."
 swiss.177.a: "But why?"

 swiss.178.t: "Chaos in Haute-Savoie!"
 swiss.178.d: "With French support and a lax military presence in the region, French saboteurs have managed to stir unrest in Haute-Savoie, and the administration will be forced to spare extra resources to maintain the peace. We must maintain a stronger military presence if we are to keep the region stable."
 swiss.178.a: "We were too lax!"

 swiss.179.t: "The Commune Defeated"
 swiss.179.d.war: "The Commune of France has found itself soundly defeated and removed from the landscape of Europe. With the largest threat to our nation now a thing of the past, we no longer have to worry about the looming threat of war."
 swiss.179.d.cooperation: "The Commune of France has found itself soundly defeated and removed from the landscape of Europe. Unfortunately for us, it means whatever we gained from cooperating with them is also gone... but, on the other hand, we no longer have to worry about their influence or the threat of a war."
 swiss.179.a: "Peace reigns!"

 swiss.180.t: "Returning Haute-Savoie"
 swiss.180.d: "With a semblance of peace and order restored to Europe in the form of the defeat of the Commune of France and a restoration of a legitimate French government, it is time we honour our obligations made at the end of the Weltkrieg and return Haute-Savoie to French control. We have been its careful stewards for many years, but our commitment to our promise is resolute. The territory must be returned, and the French government will surely be grateful for the safeguarding of their land."
 swiss.180.italian: "With a semblance of peace and order restored to Europe in the form of the defeat of the Commune of France, and the consolidation of Savoy under the new Italian regime, it is time we end our custodianship of the territory of Haute-Savoie. We have been its careful stewards for many years, but our commitment to the Treaty of Turin of 1816 remains true. The territory's neutrality is no longer threatened, and the new Italian government will surely appreciate the legitimacy of being seen as the territory's legitimate nation."
 swiss.180.syndie: "The old Swiss order has been overthrown, and in its place a new and proper Syndicalist government has arisen. In order to solidify our relation with our neighbouring Syndicalist Commune of France, we must make good on a promise made many years ago and return Upper Savoy to Communard rule. With this act of cooperation, we can surely align ourselves with the power that is France."
 swiss.180.a: "It must go to [735.Owner.GetNameDef]."

 swiss.181.t: "The Return of Upper Savoy"
 swiss.181.d: "Switzerland has approached us with an offer to return the region of Upper Savoy to our control after controlling the region for nearly two decades. They have deemed our nation the rightful owners of the land, and according to their previous obligation of protecting the territory until peace is restored, have properly returned the region to us."
 swiss.181.a: "They have honoured their obligations."

 swiss.184.t: "Officers Protest"
 swiss.184.d: "Many officers have resigned out of protest in response to our declaration of Martial Law in the nation. Perhaps driven by some remaining loyalties to Syndicalist elements operating within our borders, these officers will leave a hole in our ranks that can only be filled with time."
 swiss.184.a: "This is not ideal."

 swiss.185.t: "Our Swiss Assets Nationalised"
 swiss.185.d: "We have been informed that the nationalist regime in Switzerland has nationalised all foreign-owned economic assets in their nation in an attempt to gain greater control over their economy. Naturally, we have not-insignificant holdings there, and we are under pressure to regain the lost capital for our citizens."
 swiss.185.a: "We won't forget this."

 swiss.186.t: "The New Order Falls"
 swiss.186.d: "Not even a year after toppling the old Swiss government and establishing a military dictatorship "for the good of the nation", the government of the Schweizerischer Vaterländischer Verband has shown itself completely incapable of rallying public support.\n\nAn increasing amount of public protests have culminated in a storming of governmental offices in the capital and the seizing of key areas by mutinous military units in league with the uprising.\n\nEugen Bircher is missing, as are many of the officers involved in the coup, but for now a new government has been created from more moderate conservatives in the government until the old Federal Government can be properly restored."
 swiss.186.a: "Long live Switzerland!"

 swiss.187.t: "Outpost Raided"
 swiss.187.d: "An outpost in Mittelland, not responding to radio contact, was today discovered to have been attacked and raided by an unknown enemy. It is theorised the attackers were Syndicalist sympathisers, looking to arm themselves with the weapons stored at the location. The men defending the outpost were found to have been killed defending it. We must avenge their deaths."
 swiss.187.a: "Scoundrels."

 swiss.188.t: "Gunfire in Bern."
 swiss.188.d: "Gunfire rang out in the early morning today in Bern as unidentified gunmen attempted to attack a military patrol moving through the streets. The gunmen were killed without military casualties, but the shock of the incident has rattled citizen's trust in our control of internal affairs."
 swiss.188.a: "Troubling."

 swiss.189.t: "Popular Support Rising"
 swiss.189.d: "Our recent policy of increased military patrols and police presence have reduced crime rates dramatically across the nation, and the people are slowly coming around to the idea of our government being their protectors."
 swiss.189.a: "We protect the people."

 swiss.190.t: "An increase in patrols?"
 swiss.190.d: "While our recent military activities have been successful in quashing resistance across the nation, especially in urban areas, it has been proposed that we increase our military presence in the more rural regions of Switzerland as well. These are the regions most difficult to maintain order in, and it would require a significant increase in manpower to cover these areas."
 swiss.190.a: "It will be done."
 swiss.190.b: "Those men are better spent elsewhere."

 swiss.191.t: "Fighting on the Frontier"
 swiss.191.d: "Our recent decision to oust foreign agents from the nation has driven many to the frontiers to hide and work against the state. In recent days these fighters have been in numerous battles against military forces patrolling in these areas, and casualties have mounted among our forces."
 swiss.191.a: "Damn them."

 swiss.192.t: "The Nation Secured"
 swiss.192.d: "Despite the continual efforts of Syndicalist partisans to sabotage our efforts to maintain peace and order, we have successfully identified and crushed all major sources of resistance and potential dangers to the government. With this, a new era of peace can be ushered in."
 swiss.192.a: "Peace at last."

 swiss.193.t: "French-Swiss Flow into France"
 swiss.193.d: "The rising tide of anti-French sentiment has manifested itself in recent days in a string of violence and harassment against the significant French-speaking population remaining in the nation. This divide has caused a wave of citizens to flow over the border into the French-occupied Haute-Savoie, and the military is struggling to clamp down on some of the more extreme cases of discrimination in the countryside."
 swiss.193.a: "Less traitors to worry about."

 swiss.194.t: "French-Swiss flow into France"
 swiss.194.d: "Unable to accept the truth of a unified France under a Syndicalist regime, the reactionary government of Switzerland has begun a new campaign of persecution against the population of French-speaking Swiss still within their borders. This has resulted in a flow of migrants over the border into our nation, and many have shown an interest in taking up arms for an eventual liberation of their homeland from the reactionary menace."
 swiss.194.a: "You are welcomed with open arms."

 swiss.197.t: "Integrating the Militias"
 swiss.197.d: "Eugene Bircher's political militias helped us prevent syndicalist subversion before the coup, but many in the government are questioning the use of the militias now. Bircher has committed to disbanding many of the militias, however it is the choice of the government whether to simply encourage the conscription of militia personnel into our military, or to take a more direct approach."
 swiss.197.a: "Accept those willing."
 swiss.197.b: "These men must serve."

 swiss.198.t: "Deciding our Immigration Policy"
 swiss.198.d: "While Switzerland has acted liberally towards immigration in the past, the danger to our nation is too great to allow this unrestrained migration to continue. Our government has already decreed that we must address this issue; the time has come to amend our immigration policy."
 swiss.198.a: "Make limited changes."
 swiss.198.b: "Radically reduce immigration."

 swiss.199.t: "Eugen Bircher Flees"
 swiss.199.d: "Due to the large pro-German bias that was present in the old government, Eugen Bircher was able to take a high-ranking position in the army. However, it has become apparent that his loyalty has never been to Switzerland and he has since fled to Germany along with some other capitalist refugees, too afraid to allow themselves to be judged fairly for their crimes against the Swiss people."
 swiss.199.a: "He will not be missed."

 swiss.201.t: "The Remaining Commanders"
 swiss.201.d: "While Major General Bircher fled after the revolution, many of his brothers-in-arms have opted to stay. Their remaining in Switzerland demonstrates a great level of faith and loyalty to our nation, and their experience in the army would be invaluable to our efforts to rebuild the military. However, their involvement with the old guard of the military has made their status controversial among hardline revolutionaries. The possibility of removing them though is out of the question, and instead it is perhaps best that we take on a more militant posture."
 swiss.201.a: "Their help will be invaluable."

### Liechtenstein Stuff ###

 swiss.202.t: "Liechtenstein Asks for Protection"
 swiss.202.d: "We have just received a diplomatic envoy from the Principality of Liechtenstein. With the fall of the Austrian empire they are asking us for protection.\n\nThe Principality of Liechtenstein is the final remnant of the Holy Roman Empire and due to its unique geographic location has survived as a microstate, and an absolute monarchy, until now. Since 1818 they have been under the protection of Austria, first through the German Confederation and later through bilateral treaties.\n\nNow, since Austria is defeated, Liechtenstein has asked for our protection; what is our reply?"
 swiss.202.a: "We would be happy to help."
 swiss.202.b: "It is best to not get involved."

 swiss.211.d: "Campione has been part of Italy since Roman times, but since the War of the Holy League in the early sixteenth century it has been entirely surrounded by Swiss land. More recently, it has been under our administration and protection since the Italian Civil War, under an arrangement made with the collapsing Kingdom of Italy in 1919. Now that the Italians have reunified their nation again, both the Italian diplomat and the mayor of Campione have requested a meeting with us regarding its future. We plan to..."
 swiss.211.a: "... honour our deal (return the territory to Italy)."

 swiss.212.t: "Return of the Campione Commune"
 swiss.212.d: "Our government has scored a minor diplomatic triumph as Switzerland has recently decided to return Campione, a formally Italian exclave in Ticino, back to us. The lakeside commune in question was temporarily put under Swiss protection following the start of the Italian Civil War in the 1919 - now that our country is reunified again, the Swiss found no reason to keep Campione away from us any longer."
 swiss.212.d_ref: "Our government has scored a minor diplomatic triumph as Switzerland has decided to return the control of Campione, a formally Italian exclave in Ticino, back to us again after a plebiscite. The lakeside commune in question was temporarily put under Swiss protection following the start of the Italian Civil War in the 1919 - now that our country is reunified again, the people of Campione have once again decided via plebiscite to be Italian."

 swiss.213.d: "Violence erupted on the street in front of the Swiss consulate in [159.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] today after Switzerland decided to annex Campione, an Italian exclave in Ticino. The lakeside commune in question was temporarily put under Swiss protection following the start of the Italian Civil War in 1919. Now that our country is reunified again with a government they found hostile, the Swiss found no reason to continue their ruse any longer, and have annexed the commune into Ticino."
 swiss.213.d_ref: "A nationalist protest was held solemnly on the street in front of the Swiss consulate in [159.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] today after Switzerland decided to annex Campione, an Italian exclave surrounded by Ticino, following a plebiscite in the commune. The lakeside commune in question was temporarily put under Swiss protection following the start of the Italian Civil War in 1919. Even though our country is reunified again, the people of Campione have collectively decided to officially join Switzerland as a canton instead."
 swiss.213.a: "Nothing we can do about that."
 swiss.213.b: "Time to teach them a lesson."
 # SWI - Gambit succeeds:
 swiss.214.t: "Our Campione Gambit Succeeds"
 swiss.214.d: "The Italians have decided to back down after a brief \"staring contest\" across the Alps between the two armies, fearing that a conflict over a minuscule area that has already been de facto administered by the Swiss for years is not worth it."
 swiss.214.a: "Thank God!"
 # SWI - We're fcked:
 swiss.215.t: "Italy Prepares for War"
 swiss.215.d: "The Italians turn out to be more \"emotional\" than we initially thought over the issue of Ticino, perhaps propelled by their recent reunification fervour. Their armies are now stationed across the border, ready to invade us at any moment without any sign of backing down."
 swiss.215.a: "Issue the Mobilisation notes! Quick!"
 # SWI - REF results:

 swiss.216.d: "The people of the commune of Campione, when last consulted on their fate in 1814, they voted against being annexed into Switzerland. However, given the nature of the Italian reunification, some in both our government and that of Campione believe this vote might be different. After a vigorous campaign by both those who wished to officially join with Switzerland and those who wished to return to Italy, a plebiscite was held among the people of Campione. Today the results are in and the people decided that..."

 swiss.1000.t: "The Savoyard Crisis Resolved"
 swiss.1000.surrender: "A few days ago a demand from the Commune of France was telegraphed to the Swiss government: cede the province of Haute-Savoie under threat of armed coercion. The French characterised their demand as a need to end the 'persecution of the French population' within the province. The Swiss government decided to avoid war and agreed, stating that a peaceful transfer of ownership was preferable to bloodshed.\n\nThis is a victory for the French government, which has already declared the reclamation of Haute-Savoie a victory for the world's working class."
 swiss.1000.swiwin: "A few days ago a demand from the Commune of France was telegraphed to the Swiss government: cede the province of Haute-Savoie under threat of armed coercion. The French characterised their demand as a need to end the 'persecution of the French population' within the province. After tense debates and political discourse, the crisis has been resolved without bloodshed or the concession of Swiss occupied territories.\n\nFor now, the fragile peace in Europe is maintained, although the French willingness to resort to confrontational tactics over territorial disputes has rattled international observers."
 swiss.1000.enemies: "A few days ago a demand from the Commune of France was telegraphed to the Swiss government: cede the province of Haute-Savoie under threat of armed coercion. The French characterised their demand as a need to end the 'persecution of the French population' within the province. Despite a desperate attempt to find international support for the retention of the region under the Swiss government, no nation seemed willing to risk war over the French demands.\n\nThis is a victory for the French government, which has already declared the reclamation of Haute-Savoie a victory for the world's working class."
 swiss.1000.austria: "Peace reigned supreme today as the Commune of France revoked their demands for the immediate return of the Haute-Savoie region. It is reported that France decided to revoke its claim after a pledge to "Preserve the time-honoured neutrality of Switzerland" from the Austrian Empire, who supported Switzerland in the crisis over the region.\n\nFor now the region will remain under the guardianship of the Swiss Confederation, who have promised to return the territory once a 'responsible French government' is restored in Paris."

 SWI_maintain_peace_mission_desc: "Our military presence in Haute-Savoie is dreadfully lacking, and without military forces to bolster local law enforcement, it is only a matter of time before our grip on the region begins to slip. We must relocate troops to the region immediately!"
 SWI_peace_mission_ongoing: "Maintain Peace in Haute-Savoie"
 SWI_peace_mission_ongoing_desc: "With a sudden increase in French activists rallying against our mandated occupation of Haute-Savoie, the Commune of France is no doubt involved, and seeking to inflame anti-Swiss sentiment in the region. It is our duty to maintain the peace in Haute-Savoie, and that peace requires a military occupation to maintain."
 SWI_Savoie_decisions: "The Fate of Haute-Savoie"
 SWI_Savoie_decisions_desc: "Since the collapse of the French Republic, Switzerland has maintained a military occupation of Haute-Savoie to fulfil their mandate of maintaining neutrality in the region. Now though, the Commune of France actively supports separatists in the region and there is a rising tide of unrest from those caught in the violence. The fate of Haute-Savoie must be decided."
 SWI_fortify_savoie: "Fortify Haute-Savoie"
 SWI_fortify_savoie_desc: "An uptick in French interest and activity in the region has led to an increase in Syndicalist activity there. An increase in local fortifications should increase our ability to maintain the peace and crackdown on dissent."

 SWI_jakob_herzog: "Jakob Herzog"
 SWI_jakob_herzog_leader_desc: "§YBorn:§! §LJuly 27th, 1882, in Lucerne, Switzerland§!\n§YBackground:§! §LJakob \"Joggi\" Herzog was born into a family of Catholic Swiss Germans. Having lost his parents at an early age, Herzog was raised in an orphanage, before taking on a carpenter's apprenticeship as a young man. He eventually abandoned this career and fell in with the radical politics of the Swiss Social Democrats and the International Union of Socialist Youth Organisations. He became a close collaborator to the Youth International's German president Willi Münzenberg, serving as his vice-president during the Weltkrieg. Herzog's combative and hotheaded personality eventually saw him expelled from the Social Democrats, whereafter he formed his own group \"Forderung\" (Demand), which was strongly influenced by the Christian Socialist and Anarcho-Syndicalist ideas of Fritz Brupbacher and Jules Humbert-Droz. During the Swiss General Strike of 1918 Herzog rallied disaffected soldiers and students in Zurich to take up arms against the government, forming a Zurich Workers Council in hopes of replicating the success of the Russian Revolution. The chaotic uprising failed and Herzog was imprisoned for ten months, during which time his political ideas moved in a more authoritarian and militant direction. Upon his release he studied the Dutch Marxist Anton Pannenkoek's \"Tribunist\" movement and later took a great interest in the ideas of the French Socialist Revolution, particularly the Sorelians. Even so, Herzog began forging his own ideological path, establishing a more personalistic leadership in Forderung. Though he had once been an anarchist, Herzog now called for the creation of centralised Syndicalist states based upon \"revolutionary parliamentarism\" and criticised the \"inconsistencies, opportunism and elitism\" of moderate Syndicalists. His views on Christian Socialism took decisive influence from the French Sorelians, a far cry from the ideals of his former idols Brupbacher and Humbert-Droz. In 1921 he forged an unlikely alliance with his old rivals Léon Nicole and Fritz Platten, cooperating with their Solidarité (Solidarity) group to strengthen the radical Swiss trade unions. This partnership deepened in 1927 with the founding of \"die Arbeiterwache\", or \"le Garde Ouvrière\" (The Workers Guard), a dedicated political paramilitary for the Swiss socialist movement, that has served as Herzog's main source of influence outside of the more close knit Forderung group.§!"

 SWI_jules_humbert_droz: "Jules Humbert-Droz"
 SWI_jules_humbert_droz_leader_desc: "§YBorn:§! §LSeptember 23rd, 1891, in La Chaux-de-Fonds, Neuchâtel, Switzerland§!\n§YBackground:§! §LJules Humbert-Droz was born into Francophone, Protestant family in the canton of Neuchâtel. His parents and grandparents had longstanding connections to the Swiss labour movement, so Jules was raised in a radical, working class environment that heavily influenced his future beliefs. He subsequently graduated from the University of Neuchâtel with a thesis about the contradictions and compatibilities between Socialism and Christianity, before taking up work as a pastor and writer for local left-wing newspapers. When Switzerland escalated its "armed neutrality" during the Weltkrieg and expanded conscription, Jules became a conscientious objector and went to jail several times for his anti-militarism as well as his participation in the 1918 General Strike. The year afterwards he moved to Paris and founded the newspaper \"Le Phare\" (The Lighthouse), to promote Syndicalist ideas and solidarity between the French and Swiss socialist movements. He was subsequently recruited to aid the Third Internationale, where his responsibility was primarily the Romance-speaking world. After nearly a decade of service to the revolution he returned to Switzerland, where he sought to reconcile the Swiss Social Democratic Party with the Third Internationale, to limited success. Jules was a man of many contradictions, a zealously devoted Christian who nevertheless always defended the Parisian political line, even as tensions in France escalated over anti-clericalism. He turned the other cheek when radicals questioned his whether his ardent pacifism did more to harm the revolution than help it.\n\nTo Jules, pacifism did not preclude waging a righteous struggle, but it mandated him to oppose the senseless violence he saw embodied by men such as Jakob Herzog and Léon Nicole. He rejected their paramilitary methods and turned towards mainstream politics, hoping to usher in a Syndicalist revolution by the ballot. He was later elected to the National Council representing Zürich, though Neuchâtel still remains as his primary base of operations as he serves as its local Social Democratic Party's de-facto leader.§!"

 SWI_robert_grimm: "Robert Grimm"
 SWI_robert_grimm_leader_desc: "§YBorn:§! §LApril 16th, 1881, in Wald, Zurich, Switzerland§!\n§YBackground:§! §LBorn April 16th, 1881, to a German Protestant family in the village of Wald, Zurich, Robert Grimm grew up the son of a machine fitter and weaver, which taught him the skills to gain an apprenticeship as a printer. Familiar with industrial machinery, he excelled in the workshops of Oerlikon, the industrial sector of the city of Zurich an embarked on his 'Wanderjahre' (journeyman years) in 1905. This wide trip across Germany, France, Austria and Italy introduced him to radical Marxist ideas. Upon his return he joined the Swiss Social Democratic Party and was subsequently blacklisted due to an attempt to organise his workplace outside of Basel. Bereft of employment, Robert turned to journalism and political activism, leaving Basel-Stadt in favour of Bern, where he participated in the strikes of 1906 and 1912. By the outbreak of the Weltkrieg, Robert turned away from the failed optimism of the Second International and towards the ambitions of Bolshevism, spending time in the company of the Russian exile Vladimir Lenin. In the wake of the February Revolution, he helped to negotiate Lenin's return and unsuccessfully sought to utilise his influence among German workers to mediate a separate peace between Russia and Germany. A year later he organised the Olten Action Committee in the eponymous Solothurn town of Olten.\n\nEconomic collapse and a looming famine had necessitated the Swiss Government to decree the conscription of all civilians to aid in public works, which faced nationwide resistance. When his comrades hesitated, Robert effectively hijacked the Social Democratic Party to push for a general strike, in hopes that it would break the back of the Federal Council and establish a Swiss People's Republic. The 1918 Swiss Landesstreik/Grève du Pays (National Strike) was short and brutal, leaving several workers dead and a near military coup shaking the country, as the army intervened to crush the uprising. Robert, who has ever since then been known as the 'Father of the National Strike', faced years in prison but upon his release returned to fighting for workers rights and maintained an immense political influence. In recent years he has drifted between both the moderate and radical wings of the socialist movement, but he has never forgotten his roots and has always been ready for the day that the glorious Swiss revolution, dreamed of in 1918, can truly be made real.§!"
