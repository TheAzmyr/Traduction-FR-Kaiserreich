### Ideas ###
 TIB_struggle_tibet: "The Struggle for Tibet"
 TIB_struggle_tibet_desc: "At the moment, Tibet's government is struggling with exiled revolutionaries and reformers competing for control of the country. This has inhibited the Ganden Phodrang's ability to govern the Tibetan people, and increased the disconnect between average Tibetan freemen with serfs and the nobility."

 TIB_struggle_tibet2: "Aristocracy Unsettled"
 TIB_struggle_tibet2_desc: "The religious and civil offices of Tibet, from the Yigtsang to Kashag, are currently struggling to deal with the imprisonment of the 5th Reting Rinpoche. Many civil servants are going without pay, and several Thubtens are refusing to pay their feudal dues to Lhasa. Without this money the Ganden Phodrang struggles to enact any meaningful reforms."

 TIB_struggle_tibet3: "Aristocracy Resettled"
 TIB_struggle_tibet3_desc: "Through political capital, The Young Tibet Party has successfully gained the trust of the Thubtens and civil servants of Tibet. Though we can only demand less from these feudal lords as a trade-off, we can now focus our political capital to the people that must defend our nation."

 TIB_monastic_governance: "Monastic Governance"
 TIB_monastic_governance_desc: "Much of the Tibetan countryside is comprised of monastic fiefs. These areas are quite autonomous from the Tibetan government, and operate as states unto their own, having their own armies and tax collection services. While this makes for a weaker central government, the self-reliant communities offer a degree of stability and community."

 TIB_monastic_governance2: "Monastic Primacy"
 TIB_monastic_governance2_desc: "Much of the Tibetan countryside is comprised of monastic fiefs. These areas are quite autonomous from the Tibetan government, and operate as states unto their own, having their own armies and tax collection services. The Ganden Phodrang has been able to leverage the monasteries for additional levies and taxes to aid in our national interest."

 TIB_dob_dobs: "Dob-dobs Recruitment"
 TIB_dob_dobs_desc: "The main form of peacekeeping in the countryside are the Dob-dobs, warrior monks recruited by the monasteries to protect their holdings. While often uneducated compared to their peers, they tend to be extremely conservative and dedicated to protecting what they see as “Dharmic” institutions. The Dob-dobs are the bread-and-butter of our military."

 TIB_dob_dobs_trad: "Dob-dobs Tradition"
 TIB_dob_dobs_trad_desc: "The main form of peacekeeping in the countryside are the Dob-dobs, warrior monks recruited by the monasteries to protect their holdings. While often uneducated compared to their peers, they tend to be extremely conservative and dedicated to protecting what they see as “Dharmic” institutions. The Dob-dobs now receive a stipend from the Ganden Phodrang to ensure they can feed their families during wartime."

 TIB_dob_dobs_trad2: "Dob-dobs Tradition"
 TIB_dob_dobs_trad2_desc: "Warrior monks have been successfully appraised by Lhasa, and a new more rigid structure implemented to better protect our lands. Those monks of acute ability are now promoted to officers, in spite of their social rank, while undisciplined monks have been demoted to subordinates."

 TIB_dob_dobs_purged: "Dob-dobs Purged"
 TIB_dob_dobs_purged_desc: "The leadership of these warrior monks have been successfully retired and replaced by our loyal men. It may take some time for our loyal political ambassadors to convince the rest of the Dob-dobs of the value of better training."

 TIB_recovery_teams: "Recovery Teams"
 TIB_recovery_teams_desc: "The Tibetan army has been trained to shoot old Lee Enfield rifles, but needs better hardware. The proliferating wars in the north, south, and east provide opportunities for soldiers to resupply."

 TIB_dmag_sgar_supremacy: "Dmag-Sgar Supremacy"
 TIB_dmag_sgar_supremacy_desc: "The Dob-dobs have finally been properly re-organised into regulars in the Indo-British model. This new top-down leadership now offers more directional control and accountability for military actions undertaken."

 TIB_serfdom: "Institutionalised Serfdom"
 TIB_serfdom_desc: "Serfdom is still practised throughout Tibet, and many peasants are still permanently tied to their lands. Despite being assailed politically from the south and east, an alternative has not gained traction with the population."

 TIB_serfdom2: "Alleviated Serfdom"
 TIB_serfdom2_desc: "In order to relieve political pressure from the south and east, the Regent has benevolently decided to emancipate all the serfs working directly in the Ganden Phodrang's estates. The Young Tibet Party believes this will encourage a gradual end to serfdom without demanding change from the aristocracy."

 TIB_modernized_education: "Modernised Education"
 TIB_modernized_education_desc: "The upheaval in Tibetan society reached education. Mandatory school attendance for both genders as well as education in the sciences is being enforced by the government. Resistance to this policy from the general public is strong. "

 TIB_dual_education: "Children's Villages"
 TIB_dual_education_desc: "The political upheaval has made an exception for education. While modern sciences are now mandatory in public education, some vestiges like gender segregation in schooling is still retained. Resistance to this policy from the general public is negligible."

 TIB_revolutionary_spirit: "Revolutionary Spirit"

 TIB_more_workers_employed: "More Workers Employed"
 TIB_more_workers_employed_desc: "The Ganden Phodrang of Tibet has put into place an employment programme for young Tibetans to find temporary employment. This model has shown some success in the British Raj."

 TIB_institutions_safeguarded: "Institutions Safeguarded"
 TIB_institutions_safeguarded_desc: "The Ganden Phodrang has ensured that the Ganden Phodrang and nobility are secure once more. With the support of the landowners and monasteries, our country can squeeze out foreign infiltration."

 TIB_the_d_l: "Exaltation of the Dalai Lama"
 TIB_the_d_l_desc: "The 14th Dalai Lama has been found and exalted to the splendour of the faithful. He is the spiritual leader of our nation, and we will protect him until the very end."

 TIB_intervention_idea: "Limited Tibetan Intervention"
 TIB_intervention_idea_desc: "The Tibetan government has allowed a limited range of volunteership in foreign conflicts, mostly as a way to assert some influence on the Asian political scene."

 TIB_yushu_desertion: "Muslim Militarism"
 TIB_yushu_desertion_desc: "The Ma Clique has incited militant activity in Muslim communities throughout the North, which is causing our people to doubt our ability to protect them. No doubt the Mas are promising the world to our Muslim residents, and we have no faculty to reassure them."

 TIB_Ma_diplomatic_interference: "Ma Diplomatic Interference"
 TIB_Ma_diplomatic_interference_desc: "The Ma Clique has successfully discredited our government with most of the warlords of China. It is no secret that most of the warlords of China wish to see our lands subordinated once more, but we had hoped their own desperate situation would cause them to ally with us. This will make it more difficult to assert our sovereignty over land outside our control."

 TIB_theosophy: "Theosophical Society"
 TIB_theosophy_desc: "Nicholas Roerich's contribution to the Tibetan political scene is the introduction of the well-connected Theosophical Society from India. Their members arrive to Lhasa to proselytise their belief in the Ascended Masters that originated in Tibet. To the Theosophical Society, Tibetan independence and the progress of Leninism is the herald to the Sacred Union of the East, their long awaited theocratic socialist state promised by Nicholas Roerich."

#Focuses
 TIB_convene_national_assembly: "Convene the Kashag"
 TIB_convene_national_assembly_desc: "It is time to defer to the protocols of the 'Ordinance for the More Effective Governing of Tibet' once again. Herein the Kashag, which has not met since the Regent appointed Trimön, must re-convene to set a course for political action to direct the Ganden Phodrang."

 TIB_appoint_new_treasurer: "Appoint a New Treasurer"
 TIB_appoint_new_treasurer_desc: "The Tibetan Treasury has suffered greatly from the crises of the past two decades. From Shigatse's political opposition, to Yushu's isolation, we must appoint a Treasurer who can coax more money out of the monasteries."

 TIB_reformists_win_out: "Reformists Win Out"
 TIB_reformists_win_out_desc: "The tide of reform has finally swept over the Ganden Phodrang, and the government in Lhasa has proclaimed a desire to reform Tibet. Such a concern for the Tibetan people is unnatural for the civil government, and it will take some time before the Tibetan people."

 TIB_jolly_minister: "Satisfy the Prime Minister"
 TIB_jolly_minister_desc: "The new Prime Minister, Khenchen Lobsang Tashi, is on the edge of exiling the Young Tibet Party. The arrest of the Reting Rinpoche and the transfer of the Regency to a lower monk would be a hard sell to any Prime Minister, much less a neutral one. Khenchen Lobsang Tashi cannot be won over by any amount of public support, only through an exceedingly expensive bribe to keep quiet."

 TIB_tsikhang_shakes: "Shaking up the Tsikhang"
 TIB_tsikhang_shakes_desc: "The Tsikhang is the governing body for aristocratic education in Tibet, a thankless job as evidenced by the Rugby Four. It is through the Tsikhang's obstinacy that education for girls and the poor is ignored. Although this will certainly infuriate a portion of the educators, it is essential that we modernise the education system in Tibet to enfranchise the people we depend on and raise their literacy."

 TIB_pressure_regent: "Pressure the Regent"
 TIB_pressure_regent_desc: "The new Regent is frozen in ceremonial formality, and unwilling to take part in the Kahsag meetings for the betterment of Tibet. We must impose ourselves into the Regent's schedule, and get some sort of concession on his stance if any reforms are to occur."

 TIB_aristocrat_appeal: "Recovery Teams"
 TIB_aristocrat_appeal_desc: "Having experience equipping our military with civilian firearms, our Military Staff has authorised the procurement and distribution of civilian firearms by Recovery Teams. These auxiliaries are being trained to identify and categorise weapons in the local area for use by the Army."

 TIB_debate_regency: "Debate the Tse Laptra"
 TIB_debate_regency_desc: "The Tse Laptra's focus on only male education is derived from the need to populate monasteries with literate monks, but did not extend this obligation to girls. If we are to receive the best and brightest Tibetans in the future we must bring the Tse Laptra to answer to the Kashag and hopefully enfranchise at least the women living in monastic communities."

 TIB_return_panchen_lama: "Return of the Panchen Lama"
 TIB_return_panchen_lama_desc: "The Panchen Lama has returned to Tibet bearing a translation of the Three Principles of the People. This new programme has charged the Panchen Lama's Regency towards building a new government in Tibet that can enjoy the protection of the KMT and the Bharatiyan Commune. Chiefly their expectation is for the Panchen Lama to call for an election."

 TIB_whip_into_shape: "Whip Army Into Shape"
 TIB_whip_into_shape_desc: "For too long the Tibetan Army has languished untrained and unaccounted for. The first task of our Military Staff is to review and assemble the whole body of our military drill records, and evaluate our performance scores the British Inspectors gave back in 1919."

 TIB_expand_trapichi_factory: "Expand the Trapichi Factory"
 TIB_expand_trapichi_factory_desc: "The Trapichi Factory, our sole modern military factory, is in need of funding. In order to supply a larger military force, we must order the Trapichi monks to clear land for additional assembly buildings. The Trapichi quartermaster will have to train and lead an increase in production that he promised us years ago."

 TIB_electrical_machine_office: "Focus on the Electrical Machine Office"
 TIB_electrical_machine_office_desc: "The Electrical Machine Office in Lhasa is our sole modern telegraph office, and has been in operation unrepaired since the British Revolution. We must purchase a larger electrical generator for the office, and investigate the assembly of radio transmitters."

 TIB_expand_mint: "Expand the Mint"
 TIB_expand_mint_desc: "At Trapichi, our mint office has steadily worked with little mechanical improvement in decades. It is time to invest in a modern milling machine and debase our currency to a lower concentration of silver. This will enable us to afford more machines in the future."

 TIB_dode_valley_hydroelectricity: "Dode Valley Hydroelectricity"
 TIB_dode_valley_hydroelectricity_desc: "The Dode Valley was recommended to us by British diplomats for experimental hydroelectric turbines. This ambitious project would be the first of its kind in the country, and if successful could prepare our civil engineers for more ambitious projects."

 TIB_expand_tip_arsenal: "Expand the Tip Arsenal"
 TIB_expand_tip_arsenal_desc: "The arsenal at Tip has degraded since the last British inspection into a repository of confiscated firearms, instead of a proper tool for defence. If our army is to defend Tibet from a more united threat, we must bring metallurgists in to clean and repair the Tip arsenal."

 TIB_domestic_artillery: "Domestic Artillery Production"
 TIB_domestic_artillery_desc: "It is time we internalise the advice the British inspectors gave us and develop our own artillery. The designs will of course be based on the models in [RAJ.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], and be compatible with their ammunition, but the production will fall to us."

 TIB_reinforce_army: "Reinforce the Army"
 TIB_reinforce_army_desc: "As our General Staff is finally spurred to action, a series of hasty plans have landed at our office, many of which are obvious copies of training manuals sold in India and China. Nonetheless, they should be able to reliably apply the programme we choose."

 TIB_uyghur_militia: "Foreign Volunteers"
 TIB_uyghur_militia_desc: "While many Tibetans are content with defending their homeland, there are a select few adventurous soldiers who wish to ensure Tibet's safe borders through volunteership. There is some reason to believe that this could be a viable strategy to contain our foes."

 TIB_expand_militias: "Foreign Weapons Designs"
 TIB_expand_militias_desc: "The Tibetan forces are in dire need of modernisation. Manpower will never be an advantage we will be able to count on, and thus we must look to quality instead. Fortunately, there are plenty of sources willing to aid us in this endeavour... for the right price."

 TIB_open_mineral_mining: "Scrape the Himalayas"
 TIB_open_mineral_mining_desc: "Sections of the Himalayas are sacred, being the home of the Boddhisatvas and Hindu Lords, and we pray that this mining operation we undertake do not disturb them. We all remember the fate of Khyenrab Kunzang Mondo, that bright son whose mineralogical expedition caused such a row that forced him into seclusion for disturbing the spirits."

 TIB_The_Traditionalist_Torch: "The Traditionalist Torch"
 TIB_The_Traditionalist_Torch_desc: "The fury of the reformers and revolutionaries has proven to the Ganden Phodrang the continuing need for a traditionalist government. This torch, held by the Regent, will allow Tibet to self strengthen against all that desire our lands."

 TIB_Slow_Industrialization: "Slow Industrialisation"
 TIB_Slow_Industrialization_desc: "The first and most radical decision by the Regent to counteract any future revolutionaries is to exercise absolute authority over the national budget. The Minister of Finance is fully behind this decision, and will take the advice of the Regent in all future state projects until such a time when the nation is ready for free growth."

 TIB_Expand_the_Lhasa_Arsenal: "Expand the Lhasa Arsenal"
 TIB_Expand_the_Lhasa_Arsenal_desc: "The Ganden Phodrang's greatest weakness was exposed by the Regent in a recent meeting. Lhasa has no way of fighting a siege if the Shigatse arsenal. We must set up a machinist shop in Lhasa as both an expansion and an insurance."

 TIB_Subsidise_Military_Industry: "Subsidise Military Industry"
 TIB_Subsidise_Military_Industry_desc: "The Regent has convinced the Kashag to subsidise the construction of more modern assembly-line factories. It is imperative we furnish a large stockpile of arms for future conflicts."

 TIB_Urban_Development: "Urban Development"
 TIB_Urban_Development_desc: "Demands from the people for modern plumbing in cities has finally reached the Ganden Phodrang, and we finally have the time to answer this claim. The Kashag can do one better, and has authorised the clearing of additional land for urban development in inclusion to laying pipes for urban sewage."

 TIB_Employ_More_Workers: "Employ More Workers"
 TIB_Employ_More_Workers_desc: "A temporary solution to the mass of unemployment in our cities has been offered by the Minister of Finance. The plan is to employ workers by the Ganden Phodrang for a set period of months, and deploy them to assist in strategic construction projects throughout Tibet."

 TIB_Lhasa_Machine_Factory: "Construct the Lhasa Machine Factory"
 TIB_Lhasa_Machine_Factory_desc: "The ground was broken for the Lhasa Machine Factory several years ago, left to languish and turned into shrubbery. It is time the Kashag allocate the necessary funds to build the Machine Factory, which will make future construction projects easier."

 TIB_Improve_Local_Roads: "Improve Mountain Pathways"
 TIB_Improve_Local_Roads_desc: "The roads that stretch from east to west in Tibet are entirely unmaintained by the Ganden Phodrang. For our military security, we must pave these roads with gravel, using our civil workforce, since we lack the framework to employ enterprise to solve this."

 TIB_Connect_to_the_West: "Connect to the West"
 TIB_Connect_to_the_West_desc: "The road to Sikkim has seen much more traffic since expansion of banditry in Simla. We can enhance our manoeuvrability by ensuring this lifeline can connect to our main monasteries and cities."

 TIB_Connect_Kham: "Reorganise The Tsechag"
 TIB_Connect_Kham_desc: "The Tsechag office is a crucial spot for Tibet's route through Kham. This location is in dire need of administrative reorganisation if we are to better serve the needs of the people of Kham. "

 TIB_Destroy_the_Radicals: "Destroy the Radicals"
 TIB_Destroy_the_Radicals_desc: "The radicals that Trimön banished from Lhasa must be driven out of Tibet entirely. They have proven they cannot be trusted to leave the Ganden Phodrang in peace, and we must exorcise their influence if we are to keep the trust of the Tibetan people. "

 TIB_Safeguard_Tibetan_Institutions: "Safeguard Tibetan Institutions"
 TIB_Safeguard_Tibetan_Institutions_desc: "Institutions that support the Ganden Phodrang are on high alert since the death of the 13th Dalai Lama. We must reassure the monasteries, tax offices, and guardposts that the Ganden Phodrang can protect them from any incursions, both internal and external."

 TIB_Exalt_the_Dalai_Lama: "Exalt the Dalai Lama"
 TIB_Exalt_the_Dalai_Lama_desc: "Returning the 14th Dalai Lama to Lhasa will allow us to exalt him properly as the spiritual leader of Tibet. Exaltation will involve the young Dalai Lama presiding over the many ceremonies and holidays Lhasa celebrates every year. "

 TIB_Protect_the_Dalai_Lama: "Protect The Dalai Lama"
 TIB_Protect_the_Dalai_Lama_desc: "The emphasis the Ganden Phodrang places on safety has never been higher since the return of the Dalai Lama. The symbol of our independence and sovereignty must never be extinguished, neither the young Dalai Lama or the Potala Palace."

 TIB_Only_the_Best_Education: "Only the Best Education"
 TIB_Only_the_Best_Education_desc: "The need to educate the young Dalai Lama has spurred the Kashag to allocate additional funding to childhood education overall. This will benefit the other sons of the aristocrats."

 TIB_Buddhist_Legacy: "Buddhist Legacy"
 TIB_Buddhist_Legacy_desc: "A cornerstone of Tibet's power is and has been their adherence to Vajrayana tradition. Without it we would not be able to unite against the Chagatai and Qing invaders and reassert our sovereignty. It is the opinion of many in Tibet that, in the eventual return of Shambhala, the Muslim world will be defeated by a Vajrayana Buddhist King."

 TIB_Support_the_Monastic_Fiefdoms: "Support the Monastic Fiefdoms"
 TIB_Support_the_Monastic_Fiefdoms_desc: "The lands the Sakya Monastery and the flight of the Panchen Lama demonstrate the influence monastic fiefdoms have on the land and people. We must not work against them to receive additional taxes, but support their expansion against the small landlords that provide very little to our government."

 TIB_Empower_the_Dob_Dobs: "Empower the Dob-dobs"
 TIB_Empower_the_Dob_Dobs_desc: "The Dob-dobs were essential in dealing the death blow to the revolutionaries, and must be handsomely rewarded. Empowering them with better pay and uniforms will hopefully precipitate greater enlistment from the monastic fiefdoms."

 TIB_Protect_the_Monasteries: "Protect the Monasteries"
 TIB_Protect_the_Monasteries_desc: "The security of the monasteries in Tibet ranges greatly, and the experience with the Kumbum Monastery in Yushu proves that they can support a city besieged. If we were to build more Dzongs around monasteries, they would be able to project power more safely."

 TIB_Protect_the_Nation: "Protect the Nation"
 TIB_Protect_the_Nation_desc: "Tibet is not recognised by most of the world as an independent nation. We are usually disregarded as either a British or Chinese puppet. This outdated and wrong perception shall be rebuked in all forms. To the few foreigners that may visit Tibet, they will see our national flags front and centre."

 TIB_Preserve_Dzongs: "Preserve Dzongs"
 TIB_Preserve_Dzongs_desc: "The Dzongs have served as nests of influence for both the old Imperial Qing and now Ganden Phodrang. Their symbol helps define our nation, and certainly is a target by our enemies for demolition."

 TIB_tip_gambit: "Return of the Panchen Lama"
 TIB_tip_gambit_desc: "The 9th Panchen Lama, the friend of the 13th Dalai Lama, has returned to Tibet. With him comes Chinese KMT and Bharat revolutionaries, these influences on the Panchen, now Regent, will surely push the Ganden Phodrang towards the democratic fundamentals that both Bharat and the KMT share."

 TIB_party_convention: "Sacred Union of the East"
 TIB_party_convention_desc: "The ambition of Nicholas Roerich is to create a Sacred Union, something Roerich claims Lenin had endorsed in his lifetime. This ambitious plan has Tibet extend its boundaries and attempt to negotiate an equal partnership with the democratic forces in China. This programme will win over the hearts of the traditionalists and facilitate them to convert into Leninists."

 TIB_chopel_victory: "Party Convention"
 TIB_chopel_victory_desc: "There is no conventional way for political parties to flourish in Tibet. We will take inspiration from the 2nd Republican Revolution and foster a Party Convention for the Tibet Improvement Party. Dissenting opinions are welcome, and we are certain the people of Tibet will appreciate the ability to interact with their future leaders."

 TIB_communal_agriculture: "Kyicho Kuntun Victory"
 TIB_communal_agriculture_desc: "The Kyicho Kuntun, led by Lungshar, has won the Tibetan election. Their political programme is to emancipate the serfs of Tibet, and implement a market economy to elevate the free Tibet. The election of Kyicho Kuntun ultimately frustrates the effort of the KMT and Bharatiya Commune to solidify their influence in Tibet."

 TIB_red_flag_lhasa: "Panchen's Victory"
 TIB_red_flag_lhasa_desc: "The Tibet Improvement Party is victorious in an open and fair election, further validating the Panchen Lama. The TIP can now further the Three Principles of the People, and hopefully achieve some peace with the Chinese governments. This election has legitimised the Left KMT's influence in the Ganden Phodrang through popular mandate."

 TIB_ragpa_victory: "Mixed Economy"
 TIB_ragpa_victory_desc: "The right way forward for Tibet is to retain some of the powers of the Kashag in financial policy, while opening more land to private development. The emancipated Tibetans will naturally congregate to whichever option is best for them, providing the best economic growth potential for our nation."

 TIB_three_principles: "The Three Principles"
 TIB_three_principles_desc: "Dr. Sun Yat-sen taught that the way forward for the Chinese is through democracy, nationalism, and caring for the livelihood of the people. Tibetans can also follow these principles, especially after the election. Democracy can be tutored to the people by the Kashag, nationalism fostered by the Ganden Phodrang, and livelihood extended through emancipation."

 TIB_monastic_curtail: "Curtail Monasticism"
 TIB_monastic_curtail_desc: "The undue influence the monasteries had on the civil government was proven when the Reting Rinpoche assisted Trimön in his dastardly schemes. No longer will the Regent be able to circumvent the civil government."

 TIB_mixed_economy: "Subsistence Agriculture"
 TIB_mixed_economy_desc: "The means to which most of Tibet survives has long been sidelined as a concern for the government. No longer. We shall make an agricultural survey of Tibet and reduce or increase taxes in relation to the ability for the town to feed itself."

 TIB_kham_investment: "Invest in Kham"
 TIB_kham_investment_desc: "Kham is the more progressive half of Tibet, and a majority of our core party members come from Kampha nobility. We should reward their sacrifice for democracy by focusing funds on improving their estates."

 TIB_invite_kk: "Dual Education"
 TIB_invite_kk_desc: "The centuries long tradition of exclusively male aristocratic education is an affront on our beliefs. We must find a solution that allows for free education at some level to the common Tibetan. At the same time, even if it must be segregated, girls should receive some form of education provided by the civil government."

 TIB_local_teachers: "Local Teachers"
 TIB_local_teachers_desc: "It is time we leveraged the educational facilities in monasteries to their full potential. Monasteries are the repository of our cultural history, and with some funding can enfranchise more young people and set them up towards technical education in Lhasa."

 TIB_tibetan_parliament: "The Kalmyk Plan"
 TIB_tibetan_parliament_desc: "Among the Sinologists of Saint Petersburg there was an idea that Russia could secure Central Asia from imperialism by uniting all the lands between Russia and India. Roerich has taken and modified this plan, still believing that connecting to Bharatiya is the only way to secure the revolution. This will mean absorbing the decadent kingdoms of the Himalayas."

 TIB_radicals_crushed: "Crush the Radicals"
 TIB_radicals_crushed_desc: "The power of the Ganden Phodrang is mostly restored though not as great as it was under the 13th Dalai Lama. We can however leverage our goodwill to finally purge radicals from the Thubten class and Gelug School, without those institutions, future upstarts will have no legitimacy in Tibet."

 TIB_foreign_assistance: "Foreign Assistance"
 TIB_foreign_assistance_desc: "With the British Empire in India divided, the Russians pushed backed by the central Asian armies, and our scant few sympathisers in China under siege, it is time we make a choice. We can leverage the vast material wealth of the Ganden Phodrang to curry favour with sympathisers overseas, but unless the need is extremely dire we will not make any permanent alliances with foreign powers."

 TIB_russian_sector: "White Tara or Red Mahatma?"
 TIB_russian_sector_desc: "The Russian allies in Tibet are symbolised by two radical figures, Agvan Dorzhiev and Nicholas Roerich. Agvan, a tutor to the Dalai Lama, claims the Russian Empire is the true protector of Buddhism in Asia. Roerich, who was exiled shortly after his arrival, believes the Soviets fulfilled this role."

 TIB_qing_collaboration: "Monarchist Collaboration"
 TIB_qing_collaboration_desc: "Tsarong Dzasa's foreign policy is that of a cooperation with both the Crown in [RAJ.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] and in Beijing. Tsarong has leveraged his status as a hero of the Xinhai Revolution to push for this unorthodox rapprochement towards the Qing, assuring Tibetans that the Qing can be disposed of if they betray Tibet."

 TIB_kmt_collaboration: "KMT and Bharat Collaboration"
 TIB_kmt_collaboration_desc: "The homes of revolution in East Asia, Longyan and Calcutta, will lead Tibet to the future. Their concern is not diverted by imperial ambition, and their commitment to uniting the banners of Asia is noble."

 TIB_qing_focus: "Secret Deal with Entente"
 TIB_qing_focus_desc: "After the failure at bilateral trade between the British Empire and us, the Regent has formulated a new tactic to re-approach the western powers. The Regent will deliver an ultimatum to the Entente, stating that there is little in the way of stopping Chinese advancement towards India if Tibet were to fall once again."

 TIB_country_intro_header: "The Regency and The Tibetan People"
 TIB_country_intro_content: "In 1936, Tibet is embroiled in a bitter leadership dispute. The 13th Dalai Lama died in 1933, leaving 5th Reting Rinpoche, Jamphel Yeshe Gyaltsen, as his regent until a new Dalai Lama can be found. As the leadership struggle unfolded, the Reting Rinpoche was instated as the Regent, however he serves as only a figurehead of the chaotic government. Four main factions unfolded in the conflict, Lungshar's Kyicho Kuntun, The Panchen Lama's Tibet Improvement Party, Tsarong's Young Tibet, and the Traditionalists, led by Jamphel Yeshe Gyaltsen and Trimön. The rest of the central government of Tibet, referred to as the Ganden Phodrang, is occupied by a collection of appointed officers both theocratic and civil. The Rinpoche are high ranking Buddhist monks that are confirmed by the public to be reincarnations of previous important monks. The Kashag is a four-way council traditionally appointed by civil servants, but after 1933 has been controlled by Marshal Trimön. The Thubten are feudal landowners that hold significant sway in the more prosperous eastern half of Tibet in Khampa. The people of Utsang, while still loyal to the Ganden Phodrang, are suffering from neglect and bandits coming out of Xinjiang and Kashmir."

#Events
 tib.2.t: "Restoration of the Dalai Lama"
 tib.2.d: "The Regent has announced today that the 14th Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, has been restored to his rightful place as Head of State of Tibet. Although his power is mostly ceremonial and concentrated with other government members, he is finally here. The search has ended."
 tib.2.a: "May he live ten thousand years!"

 tib.10.t: "The Regents Vision"
 tib.10.d: "Sitting on the shore of the Lhamo La-tso Lake, the Regent has had a vision of the new Dalai Lama. Through a large monastery with a gilded roof and turquoise tiles, and a twisting path from it, the vision took the Regent to a hill to the east. Opposite to the hill stood a small house with distinctive eaves. The eaves of this house were distinctive of houses in Amdo. The vision ends, and the Regent awakens to alert the lamas of their journey."
 tib.10.a: "A Journey to Amdo!"

 tib.11.t: "Preparing for the Journey"
 tib.11.d: "Despite the intense political disruption of the past few months, the Taktra Rinpoche has remained loyal to the government, although the Kwetsang Rinpoche has sequestered himself in Kham, after refusing to join the Reting Rinpoche's government in 1932. Once the Kwetsang Rinpoche is added to their team, they must enter the Ma's territory in Amdo to retrieve the Dalai Lama. The feuding Ma family will surely not notice an expedition if it is done quickly, however waiting may bring harm to the next Dalai Lama, just as neutrality before Trimön caused the deaths of thousands of Golok Tibetans in 1921."
 tib.11.a: "Now for the escort"

 tib.12.t: "The Company of the Lamas"
 tib.12.d: "It appears that the Ma family feud is still confined primarily to Qinghai and Ningxia, meaning most of their forces will be preoccupied. Our commander in chief recommends a detachment of elite Dmag-Sgar regulars, which would ensure no Ma patrol could harm the expedition. The Regent, however, does not recall any military encampment in his vision, and insists that a small escort will suffice. A small collection of Lamas in the Ganden Phodrang, all from Amdo, have professed that no escort will be safer than any escort, as they have been able to visit Amdo in recent years in disguises. The choice ultimately falls to the Regent."
 tib.12.a: "Faster with no escort"
 tib.12.b: "Bring a small escort"
 tib.12.c: "No less than two thousand guards"

 tib.13.t: "Meeting the Kwetsang Rinpoche"
 tib.13.d: "The expedition has reached Gyêgu Monastery, outside of Yushu. The Kwetsang Rinpoche has been coordinating an effort there to protect Tibetans from the Ma family. The Kwetsang Rinpoche has reported that he has narrowed down the candidates for the Dalai Lama to three children, and is struggling currently to ensure the Tibetans of Amdo continue to follow their Buddhist traditions, lest another fish incident occur, when in 1924 the Lamas of Amdo abandoned their vegetarian diet while meeting westerners, and nearly caused the 13th Dalai Lama to die of imprudence. The Kwetsang Rinpoche would be invaluable in ensuring that each child be tested accurately, at the same time the thought of the new Dalai Lama dying because his fellow Tibetans did not adhere to their monastic vows is frightening."
 tib.13.a: "Wish him well"
 tib.13.b: "Send him home"

 tib.14.t: "Meeting A Poor Farmer"
 tib.14.d: "Whilst enroute to the foretold destination in Yushu, the Lamas' happened upon the ruins of a desolate village, the smouldering piles of burnt wood and dirt craters turned up little evidence as to what had happened here. It was not until a day later, whereupon the company encountered a refugee caravan, that the truth revealed itself. Recent raids from the Ma Clique has annihilated large parts of the Yushu countryside, forcing the peasants to flee north-west, where they are being huddled into militarily occupied villages. While some refugees have hope of moving past the military checkpoints, others have more vengeful ambitions. One of the poor, destitute farmers that the Lamas' caravans passed struck up a conversation with the monastic lords, whilst eyeing their collection of guns, food and ammunition. It did not take long for this refugee to steer the conversation in the direction of what Lhasa can do to aid the downtrodden in Yushu. Perhaps, smuggling weapons and supplies to the northbound refugees will put the Ma Clique in for a surprise... On the other hand, it may very well compel the Ma Warlords to treat the refugees even more harshly, if they have reason to suspect them to be partisans."
 tib.14.a: "Help Him"
 tib.14.b: "Move Along"

 tib.15.t: "Ma Forces Encounter Escort"
 tib.15.d: "Not long after passing the refugee caravan, the Lamas laid eyes upon one of the very villages they had been warned of. Squalid hamlets, stitched together tents and all around air of misery surrounded the tiny settlement, which was brimming with guards proudly flying the Ma Clique's red and white flag. To many of the locals which had been relocated here, even the war-torn province of Gansu may be preferable to this. The mention of Gansu filled the Kwetsan Rinpoche with a sudden realisation. A smaller stream of refugees had been moving west, in an attempt to settle near Liulin village and avoid the northern checkpoints. By following this alternative route, then veering north into the wilderness for a few days, the Lamas' caravan could likely avoid the military checkpoints. As the guards near the occupied village began to eye the caravan suspiciously, the Kwetsan Rinpoche guided his comrades west, soon ordering them into a full blown march to maintain one step ahead of the Ma Clique patrol's pursuit!"
 tib.15.a: "Run!"

 tib.16.t: "Visiting Kumbum Monastery"
 tib.16.d: "Although it has severely tired his men, and the enemy soldiers have mercilessly hounded them west, the journey to Amdo draws ever closer to its destination. After a couple of days along the trail to Liulin, the Ma Patrols' eventually gave up the chase, unleashing their greed and wrath upon some other caravan of helpless innocents. A few more days north through the wilderness, and the Lamas' caravans finally reached Kumbum Monastery, earning them a long rest in the company of friends and allies. The Monastery, which is ranked second only to Lhasa in terms of spiritual importance, has remained untouched by the Ma Clique's forces. The great temple of Je Tsongkhapa, the founder of the Gelug school, is simply too sacred of a shrine even for nonbelievers and warlords to pillage, even though they have attempted to sow divides between the Gelug school and the Nyingma school by meddling in Kumbum's affairs. Despite this, the Monastery welcomed the Caravan with open arms and helped guide them in the direction of Taktster, showing that there was still some brotherly love between the schools."
 tib.16.a: "We're getting closer"

 tib.17.t: "Reaching the Village of Taktser"
 tib.17.d: "The Caravan entered the village of Taktser with a heavy heart. Out of the three names of children in Yushu the Kwetsang Rinpoche gave to the Regent, the first two were not him. The first child, in another village, was already deathly ill when the Caravan encountered him. The second child who was shown the items of the 13th Dalai Lama ran away, hopefully to his parents. This village was home to the Thubten Jigme Norbu, a young child who had been chosen for nobility in 1921. Hopefully here we will find the Dalai Lama."
 tib.17.a: "A non-tibetan village? Interesting"

 tib.18.t: "Testing the Boy of Taktser"
 tib.18.d: "A child was brought out to view the items of the 13th Dalai Lama who had demonstrated knowledge of Lhasan Tibetan. This child was repeatedly allowed to pick out an item from a set display, and every time he choose a former memento of the 13th Dalai Lama. In the few days the Regent has been in Taktster, the child has demonstrated incredible calmness to the strife broiling to the north. This child could be the reincarnation of the 13th Dalai Lama."
 tib.18.a: "The boy that lived..."

 tib.19.t: "This is the Dalai Lama!"
 tib.19.d: "With time running short, the Regent has consulted his thoughts. Truly the weight of the brewing conflict between the Ma Clique would leave so many more children destitute, even destroy towns like Takster. The child would certainly not survive the war. Ultimately the weight of all of Buddhism is impressed into the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama. The child is the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama and is thus the most precious symbol of Tibetan hope in this world."
 tib.19.a: "Now Make haste to Lhasa"

 tib.20.t: "The Qinghai Army Approaches Taktser"
 tib.20.d: "Before the Caravan could depart from Takster, a guide reported that the Qinghai army is nearby. Every measure must be taken to keep the Dalai Lama out of the hands of the Ma Clique, for they have no kindness for Buddhists, and we can only counter their aggression with our own. The Regent has taken the Dalai Lama to hide at a nearby farmhouse, hopefully the Qinghai soldiers will stray elsewhere."
 tib.20.a: "Hide the boy"
 tib.20.b: "Hide the boy, the escort will distract them"

 tib.21.t: "The Dalai Lama Hides"
 tib.21.d: "Hiding in a nearby farm, the caravan containing the new Dalai Lama hides. Although the Qinghai Army spent several days in Taktser, the loyalty of the residents to our cause meant that the army could do nothing but search. After two days, the Qinghai Army passed out of Takster, and the caravan could start on their return journey in earnest."
 tib.21.a: "The coast is clear"

 tib.22.t: "The Dalai Lama Reaches Lhasa"
 tib.22.d: "After a month of travel, the caravan containing the Regent and Dalai Lama have returned safely to Lhasa. Upon their return, the Regent gave a speech to the Lamas outlining the incredible danger posed to Buddhists in Amdo, including the very real threat posed by the Qinghai army. The Lamas, once sanguine in their positions, have begun agitating the Kashag towards war with the Ma Clique once again, fearful that another massacre like the one committed against the Golok people was imminent."
 tib.22.a: "Safe at last"

 tib.23.t: "Preparing the Procession of Lamas"
 tib.23.d: "The 13th Dalai Lama suffered from both the shackles of imperialism and the apathy of the Buddhist world, which was exacerbated by his time in exile. In order to ensure that this Dalai Lama is protected and exalted by Buddhists all across asia, a larger ceremony is necessary, one with western observers. Firstly our friends in the Gelug School must be gathered from their far flung reaches, from Mongolia, Tuva and Kalmykia. These Lamas will be the first to exalt the Dalai Lama before he is given the larger audience. The danger of invasion also means that, should Tibet fall, our Gelug allies can best coordinate a plan to save the Dalai Lama. "
 tib.23.a: "Invite the Mongols, Tuvans and Kalmyk"

 tib.27.t: "Direction of Tibet Military Reform"
 tib.27.d: "We need to decide the direction of our Army. Two paths lay for the Tibetan Army. The first direction is to focus on the Dob-dobs and make it more rigid and make it more meritocratic. Another direction is to focus on a more modern and regular Army. This will require purging the Dob-dobs and reducing their influence in government. What path shall be chosen?"
 tib.27.a: "The Dob-dobs can be reformed"
 tib.27.b: "A regular army is needed"

 tib.28.t: "Dmag-Sgar Empowered to Regulars"
 tib.28.d: "Decades after the first Dmag-Sgar regiment was organised under the 13th Dalai Lama, the Army of Tibet is finally fuly modernised. Like most reforms in Tibet, this change comes from the top-down, starting with our finance minister and continuing to our officers first. Hopefully larger divisions will enable us to defend better against the modernised armies to the east."
 tib.28.a: "Finally"

 tib.29.t: "Young Tibet Party Leaves Lhasa"
 tib.29.d: "After being demoted, General Tsarong Dzasa has been a thorn in [TIB.GetLeader]'s side. Tsarong Dzasa has been agitating in Lhasa to escalate our diplomatic relations with the British in [RAJ.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], even as their power has waned following their syndicalist revolution. Thankfully Tsarong Dzasa and his Young Tibet party didn't support the blind Lungshar, who made his revolutionary intentions known in Kham, deserving of his blindness."
 tib.29.a: "We may need to blind Dzasa as well."

 tib.30.t: "Tibet Improvement Party Spotted in Shigatse"
 tib.30.d: "Rumours circulating among the Dob-dobs that visit the Ganden Phodrang allege that the Nepalese border has seen an increase in tax resistance. This can only mean one thing, that the 9th Panchen Lama is plotting against the Regency again. The Panchen Lama was exiled a decade ago for resisting the 13th Dalai Lama's tax collection, and his domain in Shigatse was rightfully seized by the Ganden Phodrang to pay back taxes. Until The Panchen's name appeared on copies of \"The Three Principles of the People\" in Tibet, it was assumed that the Panchen Lama was still living in Mongolia."
 tib.30.a: "Send guards to Sikkim"

 tib.31.t: "[TIB.GetLeader] Grapples with Refugees"
 tib.31.d: "The Regent, [TIB.GetLeader], has publicly reiterated his promise to protect West Xikang from the Sichuan clique. The people of West Xikang are so grateful to the Gaden Phodrang for liberating them from Chinese imperialism. [TIB.GetLeader] also spoke of how they shall continue to protect the Golok people, but they also spoke of avenging their loss inflicted upon them by the Qinghai Army."
 tib.31.a: "We will keep you safe"

 tib.32.t: "Young Tibet Party Arrives in Utsang"
 tib.32.d: "Reports of General Tsarong Dzasa's insidious YTP has made a fresh set of promises to the people of Utsang. The Young Tibet Party has apparently promised the peasants liberation from banditry should Tsarong Dzasa be elevated to Regent. The Young Tibetans are not shy claiming a new Regent and the demotion of our most esteemed Trimön will allow Tibet to modernise faster. We owe the continued independence for Tibet to the right guidance of Trimön and [TIB.GetLeader], both of whom are deeply offended by Tsarong's politicking."
 tib.32.a: "That is nearly seditious speech"

 tib.33.t: "Tibet Improvement Caught Entering Through Sikkhim"
 tib.33.d: "Nepalese monks have reported being accosted by radical Thubtens in Sikkim. What distinguishes the Thubtens is their promotion of Indian Socialist and Sun Yat-sen rhetoric. Surely these radicals are the rumoured Tibet Improvement Party, an easily transparent Indian plot to overthrow the Ganden Phodrang and bring in atheistic socialism. Although Sikkim is out of our ability to intervene, the Ganden Phodrang can lean on the Nepalese government to help disperse these socialist agitators."
 tib.33.a: "Nepal wouldn't help socialists, would they?"

 tib.34.t: "Tibet Asks Us to close Sikkim Border"
 tib.34.d: "The Tibetan Regent claims the Tibet Improvement Party is secretly crossing from Bharatiya to Tibet through Sikkim. At some cost we can send troops there to ensure our relations with Tibet does not deteriorate. At the same time we could ignore this possibly spurious theory of theirs."
 tib.34.a: "Close Sikkim"
 tib.34.b: "Tibet cannot order us around!"

 tib.35.t: "Nepal Agrees to Close Sikkhim border"
 tib.35.d: "Without any access to Sikkim, the Tibet Improvement Party are apparently trying to pull their forces across the Himalayas back into the Bharatiya Commune. Hopefully this time they shall remain in exile."
 tib.35.a: "The liberal snake is gone!"

 tib.36.t: "Nepal Refuses to Close Sikkhim Border"
 tib.36.d: "The Tibet Improvement Party has continued to grow in Sikkim and it seems to have grown bold enough to finally cross into Tibet. We cannot mobilise the Dmag-Sgar out of Lhasa in time, but the Dob-dobs can be deployed in time to counter the rebels. The Dob-dobs can either be sent to hunt the Tibet Improvement militants in Kham province, or try to stem the flow of traitors coming in through Sikkim. Marshal Trimön believes a hunt for Khampa allies will shock the Tibet Improvement into retreating once more, while his understudy General Changra believes a direct assault against the Sikkim border is both necessary and legally justified."
 tib.36.a: "Send Dob-dobs to the Sikkim Border"
 tib.36.b: "Send the Dob-dobs to Kham"

 tib.37.t: "Tibet Improvement Militia Defeat Dob-dobs"
 tib.37.d: "The militia of the Tibet Improvement Party reportedly ambushed Dob-dobs patrolling in Kham and have taken some as prisoners. Following this victory the Tibet Improvement Party along with their militia horde appear to be carving a path towards Sichuan. Monks in the Ganden Pradong believe they can stop the Tibet Improvement's charge by pressuring all loyal Tibetans to ostracise the rebels, while Trimön believes the Dob-dobs in Kham could defeat them if ordered to."
 tib.37.a: "Deploy the Dod Dobs to cut them off"
 tib.37.b: "Rely on the Ganden Pradong's word"

 tib.38.t: "Our Dob Dob End the Tibet Improvement Push"
 tib.38.d: "The Tibet Improvement militia made the foolish mistake of attacking Dob-dobs patrolling Kham. Despite some early victories, the militias retreating into Sichuan were fired upon by Sichuanese border guards, assuming correctly that these were rebels and not our army. With no word from the Sichuanese monasteries, we can assume the militia have been separated from their foolish revolutionary leaders."
 tib.38.a: "We have you now!"

 tib.39.t: "Tibet Improvement Militia are routed"
 tib.39.d: "After a long chase through Kham, The Panchen Lama and Thubten Kunphela have been captured. The revolutionary leaders were caught by militiamen while hiding in an former estate of Thubten Kunphela. The estate has now been liquidated and the traitorous serfs repossessed by the Ganden Phodrang With this victory it looks like the Tibet Improvement Movement is dead. Trimön has another medal to pin on his chest."
 tib.39.a: "To the Potala prisons with them!"

 tib.40.t: "Tibet Improvement Militia arrive in Longyan"
 tib.40.d: "A strange sight befell the Central Committee this morning, as a ragged group of Tibetan soldiers and dignitaries arrived at Longyan, carrying copies of the Three Principles of The People, their leaders have beseeched the Central Committee for a task force to carry out revolution in Tibet. Proudly, the Central Committee has appointed Huang Musong as the General-Advisor of Tibet. Furthermore, the Central Committee has authorised a new division to leave for Lhasa and liberate the Tibetan People from the corrupt Regent and tyrannical Trimön."
 tib.40.a: "Take a general and troops to victory!"

 TIB_Huang_general_tt: "§YHuang Musong§! becomes a Field Marshal"

 tib.41.t: "Tibet Improvement Party Take Lhasa"
 tib.41.d: "On a quiet morning, General Trimön was inspecting a guard post outside of Lhasa. Suddenly and without warning, General Trimön was fired upon from the plains. Too slow to raise the alarm, General Trimön was shot dead outside of Lhasa, the most important victory that day of the Tibet Improvement Party, which was able to overrun the city by the next evening. The Reting Rinpoche is now justly imprisoned, and the Ganden Phodrang under watchful occupation. "
 tib.41.a: "Our Country is Free!"

 tib.42.t: "Young Tibet Party Angered Over Utsang"
 tib.42.d: "Tsarong Dzasa's Young Tibet Party is reportedly giving ostentatious speeches throughout Utsang on their plight in Tibet. General Tsarong Dzasa, using his notability from his actions during the Xinhai Revolution, promises the end of hunger, banditry, and neglect they blame on the Ganden Phodrang. It is doubtless that this rabble rousing has garnered them support in the region."
 tib.42.a: "But they cannot help anyone!"

 tib.43.t: "Bandit Raids in Utsang Intensifies"
 tib.43.d: "Bandits from the west are a known spectre in Utsang. From the grave deceivers like Ja Lama that reportedly built a fortress in the Gobi Desert out of the bodies of his many slaves, to more obvious curs like the Uighurs. Our monks are reporting that Tsarong Dzasa has recently won a string of victories against Turkic bandits, and is making a circus of his victories to the humble people of Utsang. Trimön recommends we send the Dmag-Sgar, the unit Trimön inherited from Thubten Kunphela, to make a bigger show of chasing turks out of Utsang. However, this could be playing into Dzasa's plan to embarrass us, and [TIB.GetLeader] believes the Utsang Dob-dobs are merely lazy and need explicit orders to do their jobs. "
 tib.43.a: "Deploy the Dmag-Sgar to Utsang"
 tib.43.b: "Tell the Dob-dobs to do their jobs!"

 tib.44.t: "Dmag-Sgar Find British Guns on Bandits"
 tib.44.d: "An elite Dmag-Sgar division has been sent from Lhasa to Utsang to root out Uyghur camps in the region. The Uyghur rebels, Trimön hopes, will retreat back to Kashgar and the Traditionalists can claim a political victory. Trimön has reported great success, and claims he has found British Lee-Enfield rifles held by the Uyghur bandits. There is only one thing this could mean."
 tib.44.a: "I knew it! British banditry"

 tib.45.t: "Dmag-Sgar Interrogate Bandits, British Collusion"
 tib.45.d: "Shocking news came through Lhasa as Trimön paraded several Uyghur prisoners through the streets. In front of his home, Trimön reported that the Uyghur bandits confessed that they were being armed by the British Indian army. Furthermore, they were instructed to raid Utsang in order to raise a bounty for their Ottoman masters back in Kashgar. To the people of Utsang, this revelation fell neatly in line with the growing discontent over the violence in Xinjiang. To many in the crowd, this could even fortell the Kalachakra tantra, which promises a holy war between all Muslims and all Buddhists some day."
 tib.45.a: "But we got those bastards first!"

 tib.46.t: "Dob-dobs Join Young Tibet, March on Lhasa"
 tib.46.d: "A surprise parade in Lhasa drew out a large crowd, hoping it was another one of Trimön's pronouncements. Instead, at the head of the parade was Tsarong Dzasa, with a group of Uyghur prisoners. The most astonishing sight was a troop of Indian and Afghan riflemen, led by a British man. Tsarong introduced this guest to the crowd as General Philip Neame, and proclaimed that they had joined forces during a battle and captured many Uyghur bandits. From the Potala palace, Trimön watches on in horror."
 tib.46.a: "We are screwed, people"

 tib.47.t: "Trimön Declared Insane, Tsarong Dzasa New Regent"
 tib.47.d: "The terrible embarrassment Trimön brought to Lhasa that day could not be forgotten. After wandering out of the Potala palace, Trimön was discovered by the crowd in a white robe, something far too pedestrian for his reputation. Upon being spotted, Trimön gave a dumb expression and looked upon his subjects as if they were strangers, then attempted to leave Lhasa. The crowd, believing him insane, captured Trimön and has placed him under house arrest. The Khenchen Lobsang Tashi will now serve as Prime Minister, and the Reting Rinpoche has graciously stepped down from the Regency in favour of Tsarong Dzasa."
 tib.47.a: "Begone corrupt and insane old men!"

 tib.48.t: "Revolutionaries Announce Election in One Year"
 tib.48.d: "With the creation of the new constitution, the Kyicho Kuntun, the Tibetan Improvement Party and the Sacred Union parties register to run candidates for the upcoming election. Already posters for various candidates have started to pop up in Lhasa and other major cities. Much ado is being made of the three candidates, especially the opposition leaders Nicholas Roerich and Lungshar. Lungshar's detractors still claim the aristocrat plotted to sell Tibet to foreigners, likewise with the foreign-born Roerich. Roerich's status as a candidate in the Tibetan elections is shaky, but has seen strong support from Tibetans living in exile in Bharatiya. Fortunately for Roerich's supporters, the Indian revolutionary militias have protected him and ensured his stay in Lhasa."
 tib.48.a: "Good Luck Everyone"

 tib.49.t: "Kyicho Kuntun Promises Moderation"
 tib.49.d: "Kyicho Kuntun promises, if elected, they will reopen the Ganden Phodrang and empower the Tsongdu Gyendzom. The Tsongdu Gyendzom consisting of abbots and ex-abbots of the three biggest Gelugpa monasteries.

They pledge to follow the Three Principles of the People of Dr. Sun Yat-sen.

The journey the members of the Ganden Phodrang undertook, including lurid details of the danger, the other children the Gaden sought out, only to find them dead or missing, makes for a thrilling story.

On the other hand, victory could hinge on the deadly will exhibited by some of the more mercenary commanders, those willing to do-or-die. This man comes to us from the tumultuous kingdom of Tibet, whose cliques have relied heavily on mercenary commanders in the past. This general comes with a sob story of how the tides turned against him, and he came ragged to us ready to fight the good fight for once.

However, as most of the Dob-dobs were traditionalists this only increased tension among the ranks. It got so bad that at one point when the Frontier Corps went to the nearby Shigatse town they were nearly mobbed by the villagers and Dob-dobs.

With the 14th Dalai Lama still far too young to represent the people of Tibet on his own, it falls to the Kashag to delineate his roles in this new revolutionary environment. [TIB.GetLeader], compelled by attractive revelations and supported by the Bharatiyan establishment, has begun to question the absolute legitimacy of the young child as the new Dalai Lama. According to Roerich, revelations occurring across Tibet and India point towards there being a 9th Dalai Lama living, not a 14th.

He was for a time well respected by the Ganden Phodrang. As a young scholar, the 9th Panchen Lama met with radical lama Agvan Dorzhiev. Teaching him the Prayer to Shambhala. This prayer was intended to collect the allies of Buddhism together to the centre of the world, the fictional city of Shambhala.

With the fall of Tibet to the national revolution, he has been sent to personally oversee the management of Tibet under the Three Principles, nominally only leading Chinese Legation in Lhasa to aid local KMT loyalists in Tibet. In practice however, his control of KMT forces in the area makes him the most powerful man in the region.§!"

 TIB_dingja_high_command_desc: "§YBorn:§! §L1896§!\n§YBackground:§! §LBorn with the personal name Dorji Gyaltsen, Dingja was one of the potential candidates of the celebrated \"Rugby Four\" to be sent for overseas education. After not being selected, Dingja became Postmaster-General of Tibet in 1917. Dingja attached himself to the rising star Tsarong by marrying his sister. This status made him able to arrange for advanced gunnery training in the British Raj, as well as lessons in English and Hindu. Dingja was appointed General in 1923, and was demoted in 1925 due to his liberal viewpoints. Following the death of the 13th Dalai Lama, Dingja attempted to organise the purchase of weapons from the British Raj, but was denied by the new Commander-In-Chief, Trimön. To ensure that Dingja did not upset Lhasa further, Trimön assigned Dingja in 1935 to lead the Dob-Dobs of Shigatse, ostensibly to protect them from a possible return of the Panchen Lama.§!"

Upon his return in 1930, Taishi was given a prestigious position of Secretary of the Kashag. In 1932 Taishi received additional training commanding machine gun operators, again in the British Raj. Taishi's extensive training allowed him a spot in the bodyguard of the 13th Dalai Lama. In 1933 Taishi was made general of a second experimental Dmag-Sgar division, the second after Thuben Kunphela's. Taishi's talent for new technology was recognised by the Reting Rinpoche in 1935, who made him Minister of Salt and Tea tax.§!"
