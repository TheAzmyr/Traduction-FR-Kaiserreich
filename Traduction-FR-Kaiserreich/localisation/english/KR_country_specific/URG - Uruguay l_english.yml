## Political Trees ##
# Pre-elections #
 URG_continue_council_rule: "Maintain Council Primacy"
 URG_continue_council_rule_desc: "With Baltasar Brum and his reform in 1918, our country finally reached the end of an almost century old dispute between the 'Blancos' and 'Colorados'. This ushered in the prosperity that came afterwards, and it would be foolish to end this system because of a worldwide catastrophe and risk going back to the times of constant brawling between our factions."
 URG_promote_political_stability: "Promote Political Stability"
 URG_promote_political_stability_desc: "Uruguay is no stranger to political instability. For almost a century the conflict of 'Blancos' and 'Colorados' almost tore apart our nation more than once. With the council, however, we've managed to unite both parties, who now both try their best to cooperate and lead us to a better future. We shall encourage this harmony, and make all those who strive for compromise and cooperation exemplary citizens."
 URG_encourage_political_confidence: "Ensure Political Confidence"
 URG_encourage_political_confidence_desc: "The people of Uruguay have a choice in the elections. However, many people still do not vote, believing they will not have any effect on the result, or not even knowing about the election at all! We should try to promote confidence in the political game, to encourage stability."
 URG_power_to_the_council: "Expand the Council's Authority"
 URG_power_to_the_council_desc: "Now that we're done dealing with the crisis, we can go back to issues we had before it. The council's actions have proven to be decisive, and that has gained us a lot of public support. Since the council has proven to be the decisive factor instead of the President, we shall seek to expand our executive power to all the state functions the president used to have."
 URG_begin_council_policy: "Issue a Joint Recovery Plan"
 URG_begin_council_policy_desc: "The Council has finally stabilised the political scene, and it is now time for policies to be reimplemented after the crisis."

 URG_restore_presidentialism: "The Presidential Restoration"
 URG_restore_presidentialism_desc: "Ever since Baltasar Brum's presidency, the president was sidelined and the real power was held by the council. For too long has the council had absolute control over the nation, handicapping the state's power in useless squabbles between scheming politicians. It is time for one man to seize back control for the good of the nation, and that man shall be Gabriel Terra."
 URG_expand_presidents_power: "Expand the Presidency"
 URG_expand_presidents_power_desc: "With the Constitutional Reform that went into effect in 1919, the presidency had to share most of its power with the National Council of Administration. While this did work at the time, now we need to take decisive action, which cannot happen with the constant infighting in the Council, and as such we need to expand the president's power."
 URG_encourage_political_participation: "Encourage Political Participation"
 URG_encourage_political_participation_desc: "One of the major fears with the loss of the council is the lack of representation for opposing parties. However, we shall prove to them that there is nothing to fear. The local municipalities will hold a large amount of autonomy, and referendums shall be scheduled regarding a few social policies in order to appease the people and prove we are not tyrants."
 URG_stabilise_the_nation: "Stabilise the Nation"
 URG_stabilise_the_nation_desc: "With the economic recession afoot and the dissolution of the council, strikes and riots fill our streets, and criminals feel emboldened to realise their heinous activities. Restoring stability won't be easy, but with the strong hand of our president, we shall soon overcome this!"
 URG_begin_presidents_policy: "The Terra Manifesto"
 URG_begin_presidents_policy_desc: "With the political situation finally stabilised, we can start worrying about our political reforms for the country."

# Post-elections #
 URG_moderates_in_power: "Maintain Council Bipartisanship"
 URG_moderates_in_power_desc: "The Council has been, since its inception, a compromise between the two largest parties of Uruguay in order to guarantee stability, and the fact that once again the council becomes vital once again to break the stalemate that shows the benefits of having kept it to this day. Hopefully, between the parties new compromises can be forged, and a new Uruguay can come ahead better than before."
 URG_compromise_between_sides: "The Politics of Consensus"
 URG_compromise_between_sides_desc: "Uruguay shall not be built by one single group, or one single party. Uruguay is for everyone, and it's due to this that before stepping forward towards planning our policies, we should first strive to compromise both parties as much as possible in order to ensure that the times for discussion when policies are finally voted are lot shorter than they were."
 URG_balanced_budget: "Balance the Budget"
 URG_balanced_budget_desc: "Something the Council has managed to agree on is on the government budget. While the Colorados have obviously argued for increased investment, the Nacionales have struck a compromise, and will allow the Colorados to pay for said policies, as long as those policies remain within the stipulated budget, as the Nacionales fear that overspending will lead to another economic crisis."
 URG_ensure_stability: "Ensure Political Stability"
 URG_ensure_stability_desc: "With the political factions of our country having a say in our government, as well as granting them plenty of executive power we are slowly, but surely putting the final end to the rifts that once tore our country apart, we can look forward to the future as one people."
 URG_new_elections: "New Elections"
 URG_new_elections_desc: "While originally the council bipartisanship was established in order to provide political stability to the country, the collapse after the Black Monday crisis clearly showed us we need to rethink our administration, and that it is time to call for new elections. May the best party win the election, and may it bring long awaited stability which our country desperately needs."
 URG_colorado_in_power: "Partido Colorado"
 URG_colorado_in_power_desc: "The socially democratic Colorado Party has been the leading party of Uruguay for the last few decades, and as they hold a majority of the power, we will now move on to implement their policies."
 URG_agricultuaral_council: "The Agricultural Development Office"
 URG_agricultuaral_council_desc: "Now that Uruguay is back on its feet, we need to take steps to prevent past mistakes. One of the sectors that got hit the hardest was the agricultural sector. We've decided to centralise national agricultural activities into a single entity, the 'Oficina de Programación y Politica Agropecuaria', or 'OPYPA'."
 URG_new_farming_methods: "Distribute Modern Farming Equipment"
 URG_new_farming_methods_desc: "New methods of farming have been researched recently, and they prove to be extremely effective. If we want to increase exports, we should move to promote this to all the farmers of Uruguay."
 URG_people_over_money: "Wealth Distribution Programmes"
 URG_people_over_money_desc: "One of the main tenets of the Colorado party is and has always been 'To make the rich a bit less rich in order to make the poor a bit less poor'. With this idea in mind and our reforms finally coming along, we can finally start our wealth redistribution policies, so we can have a better and more equal Uruguay."
 URG_nacional_in_power: "Partido Nacional"
 URG_nacional_in_power_desc: "The Partido Nacional, which has been around since the creation of the Uruguayan state, has finally defeated the Colorados and as such, we will now move on to implement their policies."
 URG_attract_foreign_investment: "Attract Foreign Investment"
 URG_attract_foreign_investment_desc: "Uruguay is a nation in development. The Uruguayan land is fertile, our ports are great and capable, and we have plenty of room to expand industrial parks. The only thing we lack is money to invest in said areas, and as such we should try to incentivise foreign investment to improve our economy."
 URG_redo_taxes: "Repeal Emergency Taxation"
 URG_redo_taxes_desc: "Now that the crisis is behind us and that we've managed to balance our budget, there's no need to keep our past tax hikes. We shall be true to our word and reduce them, a move that shall increase the confidence of the average Uruguayan in their government."
 URG_school_reform_plan: "Education Reform Plan"
 URG_school_reform_plan_desc: "We're surrounded by giants, that have huge armies and huge industries, so hoping to survive against them relying on numbers is useless. We have to begin relying on quality, and for that we need better education, which shall give us an edge on technology with enough time and resources."
 URG_socialists_in_power: "Partido Socialista de Uruguay"
 URG_socialists_in_power_desc: "The Partido Socialista de Uruguay has, in spite of having all odds against it, prevailed even after having to be disbanded and reformed after 1921 with the split between the traditional socialists and the syndicalists, who formed the PSiU. We will not move forward towards implementing their policies."
 URG_peaceful_transition: "The Peaceful Transition"
 URG_peaceful_transition_desc: "One of Frugoni's main tenets of Socialism is that the violence, as seen in France and Britain, is only counter-productive for the workers and the society itself, and as the elected official by the Uruguayan government, he has promised to stick to this tenet to the letter. Time will tell however if his hardline pacifism will truly work to reform Uruguay..."
 URG_improve_workers_rights: "Improve Workers' Rights"
 URG_improve_workers_rights_desc: "One of our main pool of support are the industrial workers of Uruguay, who, while not great in number as our neighbour Argentina has, are still a huge part of the Uruguayan society as a whole. However, decades of economic growth has forsaken many of them, forcing them to live in despicable conditions, and it is as such that the president is pushing for new work laws to be passed in order to improve their livelihood."
 URG_support_trade_unions: "Support Trade Unions"
 URG_support_trade_unions_desc: "The Trade Unions of Uruguay have played a huge role in our victory, and we shouldn't underestimate their influence. However, they are also extremely vulnerable to radicalise and start heeding the violent revolutionary call of the PSiU, and in order to avoid it, we should woo them to our side by granting them concessions to make sure they won't hinder our reforms."

### Economic ###
 URG_big_dam: "Complete the Rincón del Bonete Dam"
 URG_big_dam_desc: "The Rincón del Bonete Lake, made possible by the construction of this dam, will be the largest source of fresh water in all of Uruguay. It is completely an artificial lake - a testament to our small, yet powerful economy. Let us finish construction of the dam so that we may alleviate the people's needs and improve our country."

 URG_dealing_with_black_monday: "Black Monday Woes"
 URG_dealing_with_black_monday_desc: "The stock market in Berlin crashed, dealing an heavy blow to our economy. We need to take a stance on the recovery plan, but which vision will prevail? President Terra's policy, or the council's combined one?"
 URG_presidents_decision: "The Terra Policy"
 URG_presidents_decision_desc: "President Gabriel Terra has proposed to maintain the welfare state that Uruguayans have long enjoyed. This will ensure that although our economy will suffer temporarily - the people's needs will be addressed. Alternatively, there is a proposal that the government must embrace fiscal austerity and end funding for the welfare state - at least until our troubles are over."
 URG_council_policy_decision: "The Council's Policy"
 URG_council_policy_decision_desc: "President Terra agreed to the council's decision to approach the crisis with a more cautious and organised approach. This will take time, but it will be time well spent, after which our country will be even more prosperous than before."
 URG_end_welfare_state: "Fiscal Austerity"
 URG_end_welfare_state_desc: "Uruguay had a promising start this century, with the first signs of political stability since the birth of he nation and flourishing trade with the rest of the word. Then it made sense to have Welfare State to improve the livelihood of our citizens. Now, we stand at the edge of total economic collapse, and if we wish to save ourselves we need to end the Welfare State and restore balance to our budget decisively."
 URG_temporary_tax_increases: "Temporary Tax Increases"
 URG_temporary_tax_increases_desc: "During the Welfare State, not only did the state provided social benefits, but it also tried to keep taxes at a minimum. Now the Uruguayan citizens are used to this system, and we cannot just make a permanent tax increase to help with our deficit. We shall enact small taxes in all services, and state that it's only a temporary measure. Hopefully we'll lower them again when our economy recovers."
 URG_shrink_government_involvement: "Shrink Government Involvement"
 URG_shrink_government_involvement_desc: "The State used to supervise through its ministries most issues of Uruguayan society. While this secured our state as a benevolent entity, now it has become a mere hindrance to our budget. We shall start reducing state involvement, and hopefully this will be the last of our budget cuts."
 URG_promote_foreign_business: "Entice Foreign Businesses"
 URG_promote_foreign_business_desc: "For us to finally get rid of Black Monday, it's not enough for us to just cut spending, we need new profits. Although we have kept agricultural trade high, foreign investment has remained rather low. We should move to promote investment from foreign business to make sure our whole economy isn't based on agricultural trade only."
 URG_reform_welfare_state: "Maintain the Welfare State"
 URG_reform_welfare_state_desc: "Achieving a Welfare State has been one of our proudest achievements, and as such we can't just end it! Many Uruguayan citizens rely on us! We shall find a way to reform our system and get back on track without leaving our people alone."
 URG_fund_recovery_programs: "Fund Recovery Programmes"
 URG_fund_recovery_programs_desc: "We now have a rather sizeable income surplus. Our next step should be to get our economy back on track.

We shall enact fund recovery programmes, that way we can get our local talent back on track and increase our profits in order to continue with further reforms."
 URG_farmer_subsidies: "Subsidise Farmers"
 URG_farmer_subsidies_desc: "Uruguay is mostly an agrarian nation, and Black Monday has hit our agricultural sector the most. With Tambos (Uruguayan dairies) being forced to close down and farmers forced to sell their products well below the cost of production. Our next step should be to subsidise their activities and products, who shall in turn get back on track and return us their precious profits with taxes."
 URG_gib_smole_business_money: "Small Business Subsidies"
 URG_gib_smole_business_money_desc: "Small business is the pillar of our economy, and of our nation. Providing investments in that field will surely ensure a better and brighter future for our nation, and we could also sneak in some funds to sustain our army even more."
 URG_implement_government_involvement: "Debate the Governmental Size"
 URG_implement_government_involvement_desc: "With the new tax reforms now in effect, we must now decide as to whether we continue with the current size of the government, or we should encourage foreign investment more by reducing our economic intervention."
 URG_implement_decided_tax: "Review the Tax Codes"
 URG_implement_decided_tax_desc: "Now that we've softened the first blow, we now have to consider what to do with our tax system. As always, deliberation on the subject will take time, but we shall find a solution together."
 URG_farmer_policy: "The Status of Agriculture"
 URG_farmer_policy_desc: "Finally, we have to decide what to do with our farmers. Agriculture is the lifeblood of Uruguay, and with the recent crisis and our subsequent delayed response, many of our farmers have been forced to reduce their activities, leading them to have large unprofitable swaths of land. We need to get those back to work in order to increase our profits, but how?"
 URG_implement_recovery_plan: "Finalise the Recovery Plan"
 URG_implement_recovery_plan_desc: "We've already covered enough what we do with our people's money, now we have to decide what to do with the money we get. Our recent reforms has given us a sizeable surplus, which we can use to start up a recovery plan. The question now is which plan?"

 URG_expand_police_force: "The Departamento de Asuntos Interiores"
 URG_expand_police_force_desc: "In order to keep stability in the streets, our current police force is not enough, but our army cannot go into the cities as they have other obligations to attend to. We will need to expand the police force in order to maintain strict control over our country."
 URG_purge_disloyal_officers: "Purge Disloyal Officers"
 URG_purge_disloyal_officers_desc: "We can no longer afford to have officers in our army which may prove to be a liability in these trying times.

 URG_new_industrial_policy: "The New Industrial Policy"
 URG_new_industrial_policy_desc: "We can no longer trust rural exports to make up the backbone of Uruguay's economy.

 URG_anti_unionism_act: "Suppress the Trade Unions"

 URG_propaganda: "Propaganda Terrista"
 URG_propaganda_desc: "It is Gabriel Terra who holds the key to saving this nation, but many people haven't yet recognised him as such. We shall increase our propaganda effort so that every man, woman and child knows who is the new president and how can he help us in these trying times."

 URG_purge_the_government: "Purge the Government"
 URG_purge_the_government_desc: "The previous government merely stands as symbols of the old bourgeois regime.

Their crimes are unforgivable, and the solution is simple..."
 URG_cooperate_the_government: "Cooperate with Previous Politicians"

 URG_buro_nacional_revolucionario_desc: "Now that we've consolidated our power and have began removing the vestiges of the old system, we need a paramilitary force that can protect us from a reactionary counter-revolution.

 URG_international_relations_desc: "The Internationale was made the unite the workers around the world, and now that we've achieved our revolution, we should contact them in order to get their assistance.

## Economic Tree ##
 URG_an_agricultural_economy: "Invest in Agricultural Ventures"
 URG_an_agricultural_economy_desc: "Unlike Germany, our nation is not very industrialised. Our economy is mostly made up of agriculture and export of agricultural products, so our economic plan should focus on the farms and fields of Uruguay."
 URG_education: "Education and Literacy Grants"
 URG_education_desc: "Despite having a good education system compared to the South American standards, it's still not good enough compared to other places in the world, such as Europe.

 URG_increase_cattle_product_exports: "Increase Cattle Product Exports"

 URG_KR_gathering_storm_desc: "After decades of instability, the Oriental Republic of Uruguay finds itself in a prosperous and stable state: neutrality in the Weltkrieg and the institution of the National Administration Council in 1919 meant that the Uruguayan economy was able to prosper during these years despite the loss of one of their biggest commercial partners. Should its agricultural economy collapse, however, the situation may deteriorate really fast and open possibilities for extremists to destroy the stability and neutrality of this fragile nation..."

### Intro Screen ###
 URG_country_intro_header: "The Oriental Republic of Uruguay"
 URG_country_intro_content: "The Oriental Republic of Uruguay has, for most of its history, been deeply divided. Even after the end of the Uruguayan Civil War, there was still strong civil unrest between the two main political parties, the Colorado and the National party. No middle ground could be found, and the division seemed to have no end, but the nation was still functional.\n\nWhen the first Weltkrieg struck the world, Uruguay remained neutral, for both Germany and Great Britain were important trading partners. Although Uruguay was able to keep trade going throughout the conflict, the war did not have a major impact on the nation, and Uruguay continued to exist as a weak and unstable nation. That was, however, until 1919, when a new constitution was created and agreed upon by both parties. The constitution allows the Colorado party to keep the role of president, but it would have its powers limited and shared with the National Administration Council, made up of elected representatives of both the Colorado and National party.\n\nThis balance of power has ushered in a golden age for Uruguay, bringing peace and stability to the population. The council had its powers extended even further in 1928, to the point where it's more influential than the president. The council has become fundamental in Uruguayan politics. Due to this political golden age, the economy has improved drastically, allowing the government the ability to establish Uruguay as a strong welfare state.\n\nHowever, the politics of Uruguay are just as volatile as always. Should disaster strike, like the sudden collapse of the agricultural industry, the cracks in the council might begin to show, and some politicians who believe the president must have more power might try to use this as an opportunity to bring an end to the Council's rule."

### Events ###
 urg.2.t: "Black Monday Hits the River Plate!"
 urg.2.d: "During the Weltkrieg, we exported tonnes of foodstuff and cattle products to all sides, mostly to both the United Kingdom and Germany. This continued even after the Weltkrieg up until the 1925 revolution in Britain, when our exports to the British ended almost entirely. Ever since then our economy has grown more and more dependent on Germany's. This benefited us due to the strength of the German economy, bringing years of constant economic growth.\n\nSuddenly, however, our economy has stagnated. Businesses have began to close due to ripples of the Black Monday crisis. Thankfully, our two main trading partners, Germany and Brazil, have continued to import our food stocks and other exports. However, many economists fear that Germany will be forced to end their imports, which will bring a full national crisis.\n\nFor now, it seems the Uruguayan golden age is over."
 urg.2.a: "Oh no!"

 urg.3.t: "Farming Exports Collapse!"
 urg.3.d: "It seems our fears have become reality. Due to the Black Monday economic crash, Germany has been forced to terminate most of our trade deals. Farmers across the nation now have produced far too much grain and cattle products with no one to buy them. This has lead to farm owners having to sell at extremely low prices or just destroy their leftover stock. Thousands of people have lost their jobs, because the farm owners cannot afford to employ any workers any more. It seems what was originally an initial economic downturn has become a national crisis."
 urg.3.a: "Disaster!"

 urg.4.t: "Deepened Political Crisis"
 urg.4.d: "Since the start of the Black Monday crisis, any idea of political cooperation has gone out the window. People throughout the nation are losing faith in our government, and riots are occurring in the cities. Suddenly, more extremist ideologies are beginning to gain an audience with the population, where most people have lost everything. The socialist rebellion that occurred in Argentina could happen here too. If we do not start dealing with these issues, we could lose control of our nation. However, there are doubts as to whether the government is strong enough to change anything."
 urg.4.a: "Worrisome."

 urg.5.t: "The Council Begins Deliberations on Solutions"
 urg.5.d: "The National Administration Council have finally met up to try to discuss solutions on the economic and political problems facing Uruguay. The council have only just started discussing solutions on these issues, even though the initial crash occurred weeks ago. One of the main criticisms of the council is the fact that it has taken so long for the government to even begin to try to solve the economic issues. Critics argue that the crash may not have been as bad had the council been able to respond faster to the problem. However, this is not the fault of any one person in the government, but rather the government structure as a whole. The council cannot react quickly to problems because of the need to discuss these issues for many weeks before finally reaching a conclusion. Some politicians currently serving on the council fear that it is too late, and that the council is on deaths door."
 urg.5.a: "Why must they take so long?"

 urg.6.t: "The Council is called into question!"
 urg.6.d: "After the council announced a week ago that they would begin working on solutions, it did not seem to quell the criticisms of the government, but made these criticisms even louder. The loudest critic of the council is President Gabriel Terra of the Colorado party, who states that the council might be effective in times of peace and order, but in times of disaster, a powerful president is necessary to react to problems as they come, rather than waiting to discuss it with the other side. President Terra has stated that it is time for the council to die, and now we must make the decision. Should we maintain the council, or is it time for a strong president once more?"
 urg.6.a: "Maintain the Council."
 urg.6.b: "Abolish the Council."

 urg.7.t: "Council Maintained"
 urg.7.d: "Even with the anarchy and criticisms against the National Administration Council, we continued the rule of the council, and it seems this has paid off. The violence on the streets has decreased back to ordinary levels, for faith in the government is increasing again. The people now trust that the Council will be able to make the right choices for Uruguay, even if it takes longer than a president would."
 urg.7.a: "Our Democracy Is Strong!"

 urg.10.t: "Socialist Protests Throughout the Nation"
 urg.10.d: "Due to the economic crash that is affecting the nation, the popularity of the Partido Socialista de Uruguay, the main socialist party of Uruguay, has increased dramatically, and have organised protests throughout the nation. They are using the failure of the government to deal with this crash as proof that the council is flawed and needs to be replaced with a socialist system. The socialist message is very appealing to the masses of Uruguay who are currently having to deal with the fact that many of them have lost everything.\n\nThankfully, these are only protests, without violence. This shows that although the socialist message is appealing now, they understand that if they made a mistake, like causing political violence, they would fail to gain any major support or legitimacy."
 urg.10.a: "At least it was peaceful."

 urg.11.t: "Anti-Carlés Rally Held"
 urg.11.d: "A rally has been held in Montevideo, protesting the new leadership of Argentina following the Christmas Coup, bringing Carlés to power. The message of the Montevideo protest is that although Argentina has fallen to a violent dictator, the people of Uruguay will defend their democracy with their lives. The people of Montevideo also fear that with Carlés coming to power, the safety and independence of Uruguay could be threatened by Argentina. Whatever happens in the future, we must try to keep our democracy strong."
 urg.11.a: "Liberty or Death!"

 urg.12.t: "The New Presidency"
 urg.12.d: "With the leadership of the National Administration Council coming to an end, the power of the president is back. The council was slow and inefficient, and finally it has been torn down by those inside the government, in the form of a self-coup. Now, President Terra can begin to solve the issues that the council has left alone."
 urg.12.a: "President Terra is now Head of State."

 urg.13.t: "Uruguayan Neutrality Violated!"
 urg.13.d: "Uruguay has not got involved in a war with another nation for many decades, and the people of Uruguay are proud of their neutrality. However, it seems this neutrality has been violated due to invasion from a foreign power. Now, the people of Uruguay are ready to fight to the death to defend their nation."
 urg.13.a: "Uruguay will never fall!"

 urg.15.t: "President Terra Meets with President Vargas"
 urg.15.d: "President Terra recently had a meeting with Brazil's President Vargas, to discuss mutual trade and relations between the two nations. Vargas has become a controversial figure throughout South America, due to a recent coup he executed to give himself dictatorial powers in what he calls 'The New State'. However, it is important we keep our relationship with Brazil strong, for they are one of the main countries we export our food products to."
 urg.15.a: "Hopefully Terra doesn't get any ideas..."

 urg.16.t: "Pax Uruguaia"
 urg.16.d: "Once again, the world has fallen to war. The horrors of the first Weltkrieg are repeating themselves in Europe, and even here on our own continent, war ravages the people. And yet, we in Uruguay are at peace. The fact that we have remained peaceful for so long, even when surrounded by outside threats, brings joy and confidence to the Uruguayan peoples."
 urg.16.a: "What a good country we live in."

 urg.20.t: "1938 Council Elections"
 urg.20.d: "With the council keeping power throughout the crisis of 1936, it is time for the national council elections. Once again the main two parties are represented; the Colorado party and the Nacional party, and they are the main two options. However, if neither of the parties secure a majority in the council, the parties will have to act moderately and work together in a balanced council."
 urg.20.a: "Slight Colorado Victory."
 urg.20.b: "A Balanced approach."
 urg.20.c: "Slight Nacional Victory."

 urg.21.t: "[GetYear] Council Elections"
 urg.21.d: "Once again it is time for elections in the National Administration Council. Again, the two options are the Colorado Party or the Nacional Party, which may or may not be able to secure a majority in the Council. If neither get a majority, it will have to be a balanced council."
 urg.21.a: "Slight Colorado victory."
 urg.21.b: "A balanced approach."
 urg.21.c: "Slight Nacional victory."

 urg.25.t: "The Council Must Decide What to Do"
 urg.25.d: "The council has two choices as to the initial reaction to the crisis. Either we can push more government money into helping people who have lost their wealth, increasing public support massively, or we can focus our money on recovering the economy, not gaining as much public support but allowing our nation to begin to produce again."
 urg.25.a: "Increase public support."
 urg.25.b: "Focus funds on the economy."

 urg.26.t: "Council's Decision: Tax"
 urg.26.d: "The council must now decide on a tax policy. After some deliberations, there are two main options we can follow. Either we can implement a massive tax increase on all levels to try to get money to fund our future efforts, or we could increase taxes to a lesser degree, and not increase the taxes of the very poorest."
 urg.26.a: "High Tax Increases."
 urg.26.b: "Moderate Tax Increases."

 urg.27.t: "Council's Decision: Size of the Government"
 urg.27.d: "It is universally agreed on the council that the amount of welfare we were offering the people was far too much, which is why this crisis has caused such an issue. Therefore, we must now decide as to whether we still hold on to a large government involvement in peoples lives, or to whether we allow business to purchase some of our public services."
 urg.27.a: "Keep high government involvement."
 urg.27.b: "Allow businesses to purchase government services."

 urg.28.t: "Council's Decision: Recovery Plan"
 urg.28.d: "The council must now decide on a further recovery plan. Either we can fund the construction industry, allowing the building of more factories, or we can give government funding to industrial businesses already working in Uruguay, allowing them to employ more people and increase their production to almost pre-crisis levels."
 urg.28.a: "Fund construction industries."
 urg.28.b: "Fund pre-existing businesses."

 urg.29.t: "Council's Decision: Farmer"
 urg.29.d: "The final issue the council is meeting on is its policy on farm owners. In this state of emergency, we can choose to seize farmland from farmers who are not getting much profit from the land. However, we can also fund these farmers to encourage them to try to get more profits."
 urg.29.a: "Seize non-profitable farmland."
 urg.29.b: "Fund non-profitable farmers."

 urg.30.t: "1938 Presidential Election"
 urg.30.d: "After Gabriel Terra's self-coup against the council succeeded in 1936, the elections that he promised are now taking place. There are two main options: Gabriel Terra from the Colorado party, or Luis Alberto de Herrera of the Nacional party. However, there is a third, fringe candidate. After the Black Monday Crisis of 1936, the socialist party gained a lot of support from the peasant population. Their candidate, Emilio Frugoni, is up for election, though if he were elected it would be a shocking surprise."
 urg.30.a: "Victory for Gabriel Terra."
 urg.30.b: "Victory for Luis Alberto de Herrera."
 urg.30.c: "Victory for Emilio Frugoni."

 urg.31.t: "1942 Presidential Election"
 urg.31.d: "It is once again time for a presidential election in Uruguay, and the candidates have changed. For the Colorado party the candidate is Juan de Amézaga, after Gabriel Terra failed to win the Colorado candidacy. For the Nacional party, the candidate is Martín Echegoyen, for Luis Alberto de Herrera decided to not run again."
 urg.31.a: "Victory for Juan de Amézaga."
 urg.31.b: "Victory for Martín Echegoyen."
 urg.31.c: "Victory for Emilio Frugoni."

 urg.32.t: "1946 Presidential Election"
 urg.32.d: "It is again time for a presidental election in Uruguay. This time around, the Nacional party have chosen Jose Luis Finocchetti as their candidate."
 urg.32.a: "Victory for Juan de Amézaga."
 urg.32.b: "Victory for Jose Luis Finocchetti."
 urg.32.c: "Victory for Emilio Frugoni."

 urg.33.t: "Terra Announces He Will Run Again in 1942"
 urg.33.d: "Gabriel Terra has been the head of the nation since 1936, when he performed his self-coup against the National Administration Council during the worst of the black Monday crisis. And now, after winning the 1938 election easily, he has announced today that he will run again in 1942. This has come as a shock to many people, seeing Terra as attempting to cling on to power for as long as possible. Although it is technically legal, most people in Uruguay see it as time for a new president, and fear what might happen if Terra gets another four years. The Nacional Party have denounced the president following this, and the Colorado Party has called an emergency meeting of its national committee to discuss this sudden turn of events, for it seems even they were not ready for this. Terra, however, remains confident he will get another four years."
 urg.33.a: "It is legal..."

 urg.34.t: "Terra Loses Support of the Colorado Party"
 urg.34.d: "Two weeks after Terra's announcement that he will run again in 1942, the Colorado Party have now come out and said that they will not support him in his run, and will instead support his designated successor Juan de Amézaga. This has been met with outrage from Terra's office, but no official statement has been made by the president himself."
 urg.34.a: "Will Terra have the support?"

 urg.35.t: "Terra Announces He Will End His Presidential Run"
 urg.35.d: "In the wake of losing the support of the Colorado party, Terra has announced that he is ending his presidential run. He has said that although he wants to continue his run, he has decided to put the nation and his party first. He has, however, refused to give his support for Amézaga, even claiming that he will be a 'weak successor'."

 urg.36.t: "Fears about Syndicalist Victory in Argentina"
 urg.36.d: "It appears one of the greatest fears of the nation has become a reality. Syndicalist forces have taken over Argentina and have already started to implement radically socialist reforms over their nation. Immediately afterwards, there were mass protests across our country, the likes of which have not been seen since the Christmas Coup by Manuel Carlés in early 1936. Many people in the country fear that the Syndicalism of our neighbour will spread over to our democracy, and that our borders are not safe from the syndicalist menace."
 urg.36.a: "Danger is ahead."

 urg.37.t: "Emilio Frugoni Holds Speech on [FOP.GetNameDef]"
 urg.37.d: "'People of Uruguay! Our neighbours are not evil, like people have feared. They are hard working citizens of their nations. And although we should be wary of their influence and aggression, a full anti-syndicalist approach is by no means the way forward. We should continue to strive for neutrality and friendly relations with our neighbours, and should remember to avoid dangerous demagogues who threaten democracy and the Uruguayan people.'\n\nFrugoni's speech was seen by hundreds of people in the street of Montevideo, and it has been published in newspapers across the country. Although many still hold fear of our syndicalist neighbour, some people are beginning to embrace it."
 urg.37.a: "Peace and Neutrality."

Immediately afterwards, there were mass protests across our country, the likes of which have not been seen since the Christmas Coup by Manuel Carlés in early 1936.

Although many still hold fear of our syndicalist neighbour, some people are beginning to embrace it."
 urg.39.a: "Peace and Neutrality."

 urg.40.t: "Gabriel Terra Speaks to the General Assembly"
 urg.40.d: "The President of Uruguay, Gabriel Terra, has spoken to the General Assembly of Uruguay about the dangers of syndicalism. He has stated that over the coming weeks he will move to try to reform Uruguay to the modern day, stating that our current society is vulnerable to syndicalist propaganda and is in need of urgent change, or Montevideo will fall to the socialism and syndicalism that we all fear."
 urg.40.a: "it is a true fear."

 urg.41.t: "Terra Announces Emergency Press Act in Speech in Montevideo"
 urg.41.d: "Terra has spoken outside the General Assembly building in Montevideo, talking about the start of his new reform programme to 'defend the nation against the syndicalist menace'. The first thing he has proposed is the Emergency Press Act, which constitutes the limiting of public press activity in Uruguay. Many people in Uruguay seemed to have taken well to the act, echoing what Terra says about its necessity to protect the nation from radicalism and syndicalism. However, newspapers have come out aggressively against this, stating that it is 'more of a threat to Uruguayan democracy than radical neighbouring nations'. Voting on the Act will take place in the General Assembly soon."
 urg.41.a: "Maybe it is what is needed."

 urg.42.t: "March against Terra Turns Violent"
 urg.42.d: "A mass protest in Montevideo, attended by thousands of socialist, syndicalists and liberals, turned violent when police had rocks thrown at them by socialists. This lead to a clash between the socialists and the police, with much violence. After an hour the protestors backed down, but the clash lead to the injuries of 12 police officers, 9 innocent civilians and tens of protestors. The PSU has distanced themselves from the violence, stating that the message of the protest was plagued by violence which they did not condone."
 urg.42.a: "I thought we were better than this?"

 urg.43.t: "Terra Holds Speech on the Morning of the Emergency Press Act Vote"
 urg.43.d: "'Our nation is under threat! We cannot stand idle while chaos consumes the people, and threatens the hard working citizens of Uruguay. Just the other day, right here in our capital city, dangerous socialists came to the streets and attacked, leading to the injuries of not only loyal citizens but also to our police force. This is only the beginning of socialist violence, unless I can protect the people from the syndicalist menace.'\n\nTerra held a rousing speech this morning following the protest the other day. It was watched by a massive crowd outside the General Assembly building, hours before the vote on his Emergency Press Act is held. It is believed that he has enough votes to pass the bill, but it could still fail in the General Assembly should these predictions be wrong."
 urg.43.a: "The Emergency Press Act passes!"
 urg.43.b: "The Act fails on the General Assembly floor."

 urg.44.t: "Terra Proposes Modifying the Constitution"
 urg.44.d: "Terra has proposed that the constitution be altered slightly for the current situation, giving the president far more power than he currently holds, and allowing him to bypass the General Assembly if the nation is 'under threat'. He has moved far quicker on this than he did on his Emergency Press Act, trying to get this past the people of Uruguay quickly so as not to produce much backlash. The news has been banned from reporting on this in any major way, downplaying the significance of this if it does not go unquestioned by the General Assembly. Although some in the General Assembly have opposed this, many have claimed that it is necessary to protect Uruguay from the dangers of syndicalism."
 urg.44.a: "The constitution is modified without a hitch."
 urg.44.b: "The General Assembly steps in and stops him."

 urg.45.t: "Anti-Terra Riot in Montevideo and Other Large Cities"
 urg.45.d: "A large riot has taken place in Montevideo today, against the rule of Gabriel Terra. Thousands have taken to the streets across the nation in anger of Terra's successful attempts to seize more power in the government. Police have tried to keep order, and in some places army garrisons have had to be called in to put down some of the riots. By the time the riots had been put down, hundreds of thousands of dollars of damage had been done, hundreds had been injured and there was even 3 deaths. This signifies one of the first times in years there is such political violence.\n\nTerra has responded to the riots, saying that it is time someone restored order to Uruguay. He claims that the 'socialist' rioters are out to destroy Uruguay and turn it into a syndicalist state, leading to mass purges and more violence. Many other politicians, primarily from the Partido Nacional, are echoing Terra's rhetoric, claiming it is time for the socialist violence to end."
 urg.45.a: "Order must be restored!"

 urg.46.t: "Terra Moves to Suspend the Constitution Indefinitely"
 urg.46.d: "Gabriel Terra has moved to bring an end to Uruguayan democracy it seems. Many politicians and military leaders have rallied behind him in what many have seen as a self-coup to destroy democracy and to make Terra president for life. There is much resistance to Terra's self-coup, mainly from Terra's own party, the Partido Colorado. The question is, will Terra's self-coup succeed, or will rival politicians be able to restore order in Montevideo?"
 urg.46.a: "Terra succeeds and becomes President for Life!"
 urg.46.b: "Terra's self-coup fails, the Colorado Party replace him with Amézaga."

 urg.47.t: "Luis Batlle Berres Denounces Terra's new regime"
 urg.47.d: "'A tyrant has taken over in Montevideo. Not only is Terra undemocratic, he is anti-liberal and anti-Uruguayan. We are moving into a time when our nation is ruled by a corrupt dictator, who will silence dissent, and destroy any sign that we are truly a republic in any way other than by name. I call for the National Party to stop aiding him, and I call to everyone in Uruguay to stand up and refuse to work in this dictatorship.'\n\nLuis Batlle Berres, a prominent figure in the Colorado Party, said this today in a speech in Montevideo to hundreds of Colorado supporters. This follows many people in the party denouncing Terra's continued leadership, and there have been calls from many people, mostly socialists or Batllistas, for Terra to step down and restore democracy. The Nacional Party, who have been working and supporting Terra's dictatorship, have not responded to Luis Batlle's speech."
 urg.47.a: "He will learn eventually."

 urg.51.t: "1950 Presidential Election"
 urg.51.d: "It is again time for a presidential election in Uruguay."
 urg.51.a: "Victory for Juan de Amézaga."
 urg.51.b: "Victory for Luis Alberto de Herrera."

 urg.52.t: "1954 Presidential Election"
 urg.52.d: "It is again time for a presidential election in Uruguay."
 urg.52.a: "Victory for César Batlle Pacheco."
 urg.52.b: "Victory for Luis Alberto de Herrera."

 urg.53.t: "Agricultural Strike"
 urg.53.d: "Throughout the country, many agricultural workers have not gone to work today, and have instead marched in their villages, towns, and cities. It appears to be a protest to the leadership of Gabriel Terra. The strike was set up by Emilio Frugoni of the Socialist Party, with organisational help from the syndicalist Paulina Luisi. So far there has not been any violence, but some strikers have stated that this strike will go on for days, even weeks if need be."
 urg.53.a: "Let's hope it doesn't last too long."
 urg.53.b: "The police can break them up!"

 urg.54.t: "One Man Dead after Army Sent to End Protests in Melo"
 urg.54.d: "After tensions continued to rise following the police moving in to end the strike, one police officer panicked. He shot 3 times into the crowd of protestors, injuring 2 people and hitting one man in the neck, killing him instantly. The shots echoed through the streets of Melo. There was mass panic, leading to another 3 people being injured. Emilio Frugoni has denounced the actions of the police, claiming they are 'just as corrupt as Terra himself'. However, the event seemed to have scared off the strikers, for the strike was called off the next day."
 urg.54.a: "Our power is more secure than ever!"

 urg.55.t: "Emilio Frugoni Arrested."
 urg.55.d: "Leader of the Partido Socialista de Uruguay, Emilio Frugoni, has been arrested today by the Montevideo police. He was being investigated due to his dangerous links to socialism, but remained active in anti-Terra activity. A few days ago, under the new anti-syndicalism laws, multiple men were arrested with links to both the PSU and the PSiU, who were rather close with Frugoni. After a few days of questioning, it was discovered that the socialists, lead by the widely popular Frugoni, were going to attempt to overthrow the Terra regime in a revolution. Thankfully, we were able to discover this plot early on, before anything could come of it. Without Frugoni leading the PSU, they are sure to lose much popularity."
 urg.55.a: "Excellent."

 urg.60.t: "Shots Across the Río de la Plata"
 urg.60.d: "Since the Christmas Coup of 1935, sketchy and contradictory reports have emerged from Argentina regarding the status of its government. But now citizens in the South have been able to witness first hand sporadic fighting taking place in the Buenos Aires Capital region. Military observers and the navy have flocked to the area and began reconnaissance to ascertain the exact situation."
 urg.60.a: "Troubling."

 urg.61.t: "The Future of the Rio-Montevideo Mission"
 urg.61.d: "For a year, Brazilian military advisors have been working with our forces and high command though the lease on their services is set to expire. The Brazilian government has offered an extension of the military mission for another year though this is not an entirely charitable act. In exchange for continuing the lease they have requested a lump sum of monies be paid for their service though of course we could simple renege on this and end the mission."
 urg.61.a: "Extend the lease!"
 urg.61.b: "We can't afford it."

 urg.62.t: "Brazil Collapses into civil war!"
 urg.62.d: "Brazil, our northern neighbour, has collapsed in yet another civil war in less than ten years, which means trouble for us. First of all, we have to hope that a friendly government comes out on top of the war, and we also have to expect that whoever comes out on top of the civil war will be friendly towards us. Our small military can't intervene in such a large-scale conflict, and the only thing we can do is prepare for whatever will come."
 urg.62.a: "Bugger."

 urg.63.t: "Construction of the Dam"
 urg.63.d: "With the construction of the Rincón del Bonete Dam our country will finally have access to a large swath of water, an artificial one, which will be incredibly helpful both for our agrarian economy and also as a source of electricity via hydroelectric production. This is truly a day worth remembering for our country."
 urg.63.a: "Nice."

 urg.64.t: "The Question of Argentine Aggression"
 urg.64.d: "Argentina is looking very dangerous, and we could approach the government in Montevideo with a proposal: a mutual defence union between our nations in order to contain the Argentinian aggression. It's a risky move, but we're certain we will be able to convince our southern neighbours that we both can only get advantages from this."
 urg.64.a: "Send the request."
 urg.64.b: "Uruguay! How many divisions do they have?"

 urg.65.t: "International Protection Achieved"
 urg.65.d: "We have now joined Brazil's faction, and while this means that we will get dragged in any war our faction leader will get involved with, at least we have achieved international protection. Our own independence is guaranteed."
 urg.65.a: "Very good."

 urg.66.t: "The Formation of the Montevideo Treaty"
 urg.66.d: "Today, in Montevideo, a formal agreement of mutual defence and assistance has been signed between [Root.GetLeader] and [BRA.GetLeader] in case of aggression from any foreign power. This agreement will only strengthen the bond between our two nations, and protect both of us from any foreign invader."
 urg.66.a: "Excellent."

 urg.67.t: "Join Uruguay's alliance?"
 urg.67.d: "Just recently our ally Uruguay decided to join an international faction to seek protection from foreign threats, should we follow suit and do the same? That would probably mean give up for good our claims on our lands Brazil conquered in 1870."
 urg.67.a: "It's not worth fighting for that land and give up strong allies - let's follow Uruguay."
 urg.67.b: "And give up our rightful land? Never!"
