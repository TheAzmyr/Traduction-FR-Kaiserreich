 BEL_Reform_The_Provincial_System_desc: "To better understand the needs of the people, the Government has decided to reform the provincial system.

 BEL_Rally_Behind_the_Lion_desc: "Our best way of Flemish support is to ensure that their hatred for the French is greater than their hatred for us.

 BEL_Stop_the_Flamenpolitik_desc: "The Flamenpolitik was originally founded by the German occupants during the Weltkrieg and dictated a policy of causing internal divide by favouring Flemish over Walloons.

 BEL_BWP_Victory: "BWP Victory"
 BEL_BWP_Victory_desc: "For the first time since the Weltkrieg started in 1914, the BWP or Belgische Werkliedenpartij has been able to secure a strong position in the parliament.

 BEL_Unite_with_Catholic_Parties_desc: "The influence of the Catholics stretches far and wide and would be a big boon for our further plans. By rallying priests and teachers behind our cause, we can better indoctrinate the population and reinforce our militarism."
 BEL_Subsidize_Agriculture: "Subsidise the Boerenbond"
 BEL_Subsidize_Agriculture_desc: "The Catholics have come up with a plan to support the agrarian region of Flanders by creating the Boerenbond. Helping them accomplish their goals would not only tighten our bond but free up manpower necessary for the armed forces."

 BEL_Look_Towards_The_Netherlands: "Look towards the Netherlands"
 BEL_Look_Towards_The_Netherlands_desc: "After the Treaty of London we were stripped of our rightful territories and when the German giant came during the Weltkrieg, they looked on while we were massacered. No more shall the Dutch be protected by their 'neutrality', the time to strike has arrived!"

 BEL_Introduce_Free_State_Education: "Introduce Free State Education"

 BEL_KR_gathering_storm_desc: "With the Weltkrieg ending, the nation of Belgium found itself transformed into the Kingdom of Flanders-Wallonia. The country, suffering a major economic downturn and having a population unwilling to accept the pretender Adalbert, struggled throughout the years after Versailles. Yet the nation may change its course drastically. The syndicalists, supported from across the border, and the royalists, desiring to invite the Soldier King back, wait for an opportunity. Flanders-Wallonia may see a storm coming its way. The question is: who shall be standing after it passes?"

### Intro Screen ###
 BEL_country_intro_header: "Status Report: Location of Flanders-Wallonia"
 BEL_country_intro_content: "Located on the western border of the German Empire and bordering the Commune of France, Flanders-Wallonia has a very strategic but vulnerable position.\n\nAs the vanguard of the West against the Syndicalist menace we are supposed to stop their advance on the bunkers of the Ludendorfflinie and push together with our German allies into the French heartland.\n\nTo the east the German behemoth watches us closely and will prove to be a difficult enemy should the need arise. North of us lies the Netherlands: neutral in the Weltkrieg, our former masters don't seem much of a threat with their ill-equipped army and friendly relations."

 BEL_country_intro_header_1: "Status Report: Economy of Flanders-Wallonia"
 BEL_country_intro_content_1: "Occupation and major battles during the first Weltkrieg have clearly marked our country and hefty reparations and general dismantlement of our industrial base imposed on us have left us weak. What was once the eighth greatest industrial power in the world has been greatly humbled. Still, our people are sturdy and managed to rebuild our industrial might to a level approaching its former extent. However as much of our industry is hopelessly reliant on German investment there remains a great deal of work to be done.\n\nIn order to reinvigorate the economy, the Adelbert Canal was dug post-war connecting the important harbour of Antwerp with the steel industries of Liège. Coal mining has been expanded into the province of Limburg further stimulating the steel industry while the Flemish provinces have steadily developed their industrial power to partially replace the old reliance on the agricultural countryside."

 BEL_country_intro_header_2: "Status Report: Political Situation in Flanders-Wallonia"
 BEL_country_intro_content_2: "Even though our country is a constitutional monarchy on paper, parliamentary control over the Government is severely hampered. Moreover, political parties can only have a legal status and participate in elections if they accept the post-Weltkrieg status quo such as the Hohenzollern Monarchy, membership in the Reichspakt and other national indignities. This limitation makes legal opposition parties stunted and ineffective. The government is advised by the Flemish Council which consists mainly of members of the higher class, most of whom support the king and execute his decisions with limited practical power of veto.\n\nThere are two major opposition groups that seek to contest the current status quo and as a result have been forced underground. First we have the royalist Catholic Party who seeks to restore Belgium and its rightful king Albert I, currently in exile in Canada. The other large group is the Syndicalist party which seeks to improve working conditions and create a socialist regime like that which exists in the Commune of France. Both of these groups have stronger ties to the Wallonia region with occasional frictions. The Catholic Party is also however widely accepted in the agrarian region of Flanders which still strongly holds on to the Catholic faith."

 belmil.1.t: "Revising the Army Budget"
 belmil.1.d: "While our generals have repeatedly urged our government to allocate them more funds so they can bolster the army, restrictions imposed by the German Empire have made it impossible for their requests to be accepted.

 belmil.12.a: "Very well."

 bel.1.t: "Disaster of 17 February '36"
 bel.1.d: "The 17th of February, which marks the day that Adelbert I was crowned as king of Belgium and took control of the country, has been annually marked with celebrations in the capital. Military parades and fanfares announced the start of the celebrations, and at 12 o'clock Adelbert mounted the balcony of the palace watching over the Warande.\n\nAs he addressed the population and celebrated another peaceful year, a loud bang resounded against the stone walls of the palace. In the midst of the crowd a group of rebels had fired a gun in the direction of the king. They shouted "Vive la Révolution" and "Weg met de mof!". Dozens of men and women placed at tactical locations in the crowd by the combined resistance started rallying the people and prepared to storm the palace.\n\nPolice quickly mobilised and formed a protective circle around the palace gates, and though the crowd dispersed into the surrounding streets revolt quickly became too large for the local police force to handle."
 bel.1.a: "Try to soothe the protestors with small concessions."
 bel.1.b: "Send in the army!"
 bel.1.c: "We should wait for them to calm down."

 bel.2.t: "Black Monday Hits Flanders-Wallonia!"
 bel.2.d: "On the 2nd of February the German Stock Market crashed resulting in an economic crisis like never before. Flanders-Wallonia, already weakened by the reparations and reconstruction of its country has been hit very hard. Hundreds left the Brussels stock exchange crying and screaming. Drastic action will be required to save the struggling people of Flanders-Wallonia."
 bel.2.a: "What will we do?"

### Black Monday ###
 belbla.2.t: "Run on the Banks"
 belbla.2.d: "With stocks plummeting on the Brussels stock exchange, thousands of citizens are flocking to the banks trying to withdraw as much cash as possible. The Societe General in Brussels is panicking as they see their cash reserves quickly dwindle, urging the king to take action before riots erupt on the streets. While paying out to our citizens would guarantee stability in the short term, it would also come at a tremendous cost to the Government."
 belbla.2.a: "Close the banks!"
 belbla.2.b: "Let the fools withdraw their cash."

 belbla.3.t: "Middenkredietkas Declares Bankruptcy"
 belbla.3.d: "Bad investments, plummeting stocks and their support of friendly banks all conspired to quickly bring the Middenkredietkas down in a brutal liquidity collapse. As the financial branch of the Boerenbond, the farmer representative body that boomed in influence after the Weltkrieg due to German reliance on Mitteleuropa crops, thousands of farmers who had invested their capital into the organisation now stand with empty pockets. Thousands have been left virtually penniless in a period of ever increasing instability and financial insecurity.\n\nMembers of Parliament have proposed the creation of a CKL, or Centrale Kas voor Landbouwkrediet, to support the troubled farmers by promising to provide generous subsidies to the agricultural sector upon economic recovery. While this would be a tremendous burden for the AVV and ABB, it would greatly help the image of Adelbert and the pro-German regime."
 belbla.3.a: "Create the CKL."
 belbla.3.b: "They'll have to save themselves."

 belbla.4.t: "Aan- en Verkoopvennootschap Requests State Intervention"
 belbla.4.d: "Despite the creation of the CKL to pay back the farmers, the other financial branch of the Boerenbond is suffering greatly. The AVV, or 'Buy and Sell Society' responsible for supporting farmers in buying farming equipment and supplies in bulk was forced to close the doors of its stores after thousands of farmers swarmed them to secure their unsure future."
 belbla.4.a: "Grant them a government loan."
 belbla.4.b: "The markets will decide their fate."

 belbla.5.t: "Societe General de la Belgique Splits Up"
 belbla.5.d: "The largest coorporation of Flanders-Wallonia and created by the Dutch in 1815, the Societe General has been the driving power behind much of the rapid industrialisation and colonial expansion of the 19th century. After the loss of the Congo and the start of the German occupation, its power fell precipitously but even today they are still the most important economic institution of our nation, dominating nearly 40% of the industrial sector.\n\nTo weather the storm caused by Black Monday, several members of the liberal party are suggesting that we hive off the unprofitable branches and salvage what we can. The Generale Bank would be sold off as a separate subsididy of the main organisation and would handle the bank's affairs independent of interference by the SGB."
 belbla.5.a: "Block the proposed split."
 belbla.5.b: "An independent bank would be a wise move."

 belbla.6.t: "Creation of the Banking Committee"
 belbla.6.d: "In an effort to stop the catastrophic impact that Black Monday is having on the Flemish-Walloon banks, the government has proposed the creation of a banking commission to oversee the crisis recovery and stop the economy from imploding. While this is guaranteed to be opposed by German bank managers who see this as an effort by the Flemish-Walloon government to diminish their influence, desperate times call for desperate measures."
 belbla.6.a: "The king blocks the proposal."
 belbla.6.b: "The proposal passes unanimously."

 belbla.7.t: "Strike of the Potato Farmers"
 belbla.7.d: "Angered by the Government response to the collapse of the Middenkredietkas, thousands of farmers have driven their tractors to Brussels to protest against their mistreatment. The Catholic party has opened a debate in Parliament pleading the king to allow them to allocate funds to keep the Boerenbond from collapsing and devastating Flanders-Wallonia's agricultural sector."
 belbla.7.a: "Send in the Vlaamse Wacht."
 belbla.7.b: "Allocate funds to rescue the Boerenbond."

 belbla.8.t: "Restoration of the NLVC"
 belbla.8.d: "Originally founded by the German occupiers during the Weltkrieg, the Nationale Landbouw- en Voedingscorporatie, or 'National Farming and Food Corporation' dictated a strict and planned policy to keep Belgian agriculture afloat. While the organisation was dismantled after the war since rations and military management were no longer necessary, the failure of the Middenkredietkas and Boerenbond to assist in the Black Monday crisis has prompted the pro-German regime to rekindle these plans and consider reforming the agency."
 belbla.8.a: "Dismantle the Boerenbond."
 belbla.8.b: "Refuse the NLVC plan."

 bel.3.t: "Army Deployed Against the Rioters"
 bel.3.d: "The closest division was quickly mobilised and used to suppress the rioters. The rioters however, enraged by the heavy weaponry, became even more violent and attacked the palace defences. The army was finally able to suppress the rioters by opening fire. 106 rioters would find their death the same day and hundreds more were arrested in the following days. We seem to have temporarily regained control but strong measures will have to be implemented to prevent another disaster."
 bel.3.a: "We should prepare for further violence."

 bel.4.t: "The King Offers Concessions"
 bel.4.d: "After summoning Parliament the king has decided it is time for change. Already he has offered a number of concessions that may irrevocably change the face of the Flanders-Wallonia regime, and certainly promise to set our nation on a different path."
 bel.4.a: "The Government is now ripe for reform."

 bel.5.t: "The Riots Continue"
 bel.5.d: "Trapped in the palace but safe from the rioters outside, the king decided not to resort to the use of heavy weaponry and has instead sought to deal with the protestors solely by using local police battalions. However, the riot has proven not to be so easily suppressed and has started to spread throughout the entire city. Student organisations in the cities of Leuven, Ghent and even Brussels itself had been preparing their own protest march and quickly organised themselves. Chanting the Brabançonne and the Vlaamse Leeuw, waving banners and protesting through the streets, the protests have quickly become nearly insurmountable for the Police."
 bel.5.a: "Its only becoming worse!"

 bel.6.t: "Walloons in Charleroi and Mons Rise Up"
 bel.6.d: "Massive strikes and protest are also plaguing Wallonia, where the large industrial cities of Charleroi and Mons have started organising themselves into a full scale rebellion. Supported by the syndicalist resistance and raids of the Police headquarters in Mons, the revolters have reorganised themselves outside of the city biding their time."
 bel.6.a: "Will this never end?"

 bel.7.t: "Mass Desertion"
 bel.7.d: "As the rebellion grows by the day, many soldiers of the former Belgian army have deserted and joined forces with the rebellion. Well armed, they may pose a significant threat to our ability to suppress the revolt."
 bel.7.a: "Ask for German reinforcements."
 bel.7.b: "We can handle this on our own!"

 bel.8.t: "Support for Independence Grows"
 bel.8.d: "As the different factions keep growing there will soon be a choice that might decide the future of our country. For the moment there is little contact between the Walloon rebels and the Flemish. It might be in our best interest to keep the situation separated until we can crack down on the rebellion."
 bel.8.a: "Keep them separated and we will prevail!"
 bel.8.b: "We can't spare the resources at the moment."

 bel.9.t: "Mayday"
 bel.9.d: "On the first of May the syndicalists celebrate the fight for the 8-hour workday as described by the second Internationale in 1889. Despite the rebellion raging on throughout Belgium many syndicalists see this day as sacred and guerrilla strikes will be less fierce today. This could be our opportunity to organise a counter attack!"
 bel.9.a: "Perform coordinated strikes against key figures."
 bel.9.b: "Install a curfew in Liege, Namur and Charleroi."
 bel.9.c: "It may be too dangerous to provoke them any further."

 bel.10.t: "Assassination Attempts Have Failed!"
 bel.10.d: "During the assault by our troops on the Charleroi Headquarters one of the soldiers who sympathised with the syndicalist cause turned his back on his fellow soldiers and lured them into a trap. Syndicalist forces ended up quickly capturing the rest of his unit and are holding them hostage."
 bel.10.a: "Is there nothing we can do right?"

 bel.11.t: "Syndicalists and Royalists unite!"
 bel.11.d: "After the catastrophic attack on the Charleroi headquarters the Royalists and Syndicalists have reinforced their pact and set aside their differences until German occupation has come to an end."
 bel.11.a: "They have only made themselves a bigger target!"

 bel.12.t: "Syndicalists Stand Alone"
 bel.12.d: "After we successfully cut the communications between Flemish and Walloon resistance, the syndicalists of Wallonia stand alone. With no real way to get support for their own free syndicalist state, they will have to seek aid from the Commune of France."
 bel.12.a: "Finally a victory!"

 bel.13.t: "Syndicalists Strike Back!"
 bel.13.d: "After the catastrophic attack on the Charleroi headquarters the syndicalists are planning a massive terrorist attack on our infrastructure. We are however unable to reinforce both the army bases and our industrial complexes so we need to make a choice."
 bel.13.a: "Protect the army bases!"
 bel.13.b: "Safeguard our industry!"

 bel.140.t: "Foundation of the 'Geuzengroep'"
 bel.140.d: "Due to rising tensions in the industrial city of Antwerp, a new resistance movement has been detected by our intelligence services. They are called the 'Geuzengroep' and seem to have gathered a lot of support around the harbour area, rallying the populace behind their cause. They seem to work mostly underground though and as such there seems to be no more intel about either their members or their leader."
 bel.140.a: "Keep a close eye on them."

 bel.141.t: "Attack on the Headquarters of the Vlaamse Wacht"
 bel.141.d: "During the night a dozen members of the Witte Brigade stormed the headquarters of the Vlaamse Wacht located in Antwerp. The Vlaamse Wacht or Flemish Watch, was used as a reserve for the Feldgendarmerie and held a large arsenal in reserve. It seems that they may have had assistance from the inside as they were able to quickly get in and leave before reinforcements could arrive. Voices in the king's circles are calling for the abolishment of the Vlaamse Wacht as they may betray us and side with Flemish liberation movements."
 bel.141.a: "Increase supervision of the Vlaamse Wacht."
 bel.141.b: "Abolish the Vlaamse Wacht."

 bel.142.t: "Loss of the 20th Train Convoy"
 bel.142.d: "After the capture of a large terrorist cell trying to breach the Von Bissingkazerne in Mechelen, the commander has decided to transport the prisoners to a safer location closer to the main bulk of the army. 276 prisoners were put on the train convoy, called the 20th Train Convoy. Accompanied by a convoy of 15 soldiers and their officer, they left for Leuven. However between Boortmeerbeek and Haacht the train was stopped by three young men who, under fire from German forces, opened the prison train and allowed 168 of the prisoners to escape before the Germans regained control of the train."
 bel.142.a: "Strengthen the protection of our convoys!"

 bel.143.t: "Groupe G"
 bel.143.d: "While our forces were engaged in Wallonia, a devastating terrorist attack was launched on the Electrical Train Network by the infamous Groupe G. They are a resistance movement composed almost entirely of students from the ULB, free university of Brussels. Encouraged by the protest at the universities of Ghent and Leuven, a group of engineering students from the ULB prepared a nationwide attack on the railroad system. This was the first time an attack occurred in both Flanders and Wallonia by the same group. We will have to stay wary of further cooperation between the two regions."
 bel.143.a: "Track down these students!"

 bel.144.t: "Armée Secrète/Geheim Leger"
 bel.144.d: "Reports have reached us that the deserting forces are gathering in the villages around Poperinge. They seem to rally as close as possible to the French border, making large scale troop movements by us difficult. Charly Claser, leader of this movement has started to expand the group very fast, exceeding our expectations. They are however in contrast to the other groups an (secret) army with a chain of command and armed to the teeth. It will not be easy to crack them down and we will have to keep a close eye on them."
 bel.144.a: "Station a small brigade in the city of Ieper to keep them in check."

 bel.14.t: "Status of the Flemish Resistance"
 bel.14.d: "While we were trying to counter the Walloon syndicalists and had to withdraw some of our forces out of Flanders, the Flemish decided to work more underground and have been recruiting members into their movement. Priests have tried to convince their parochians to take up arms and liberate the nation while rebels in the cities have diffused illegal newspapers and propaganda to enlist as many as possible. The recruited rebels, guided by experienced veterans from both the army and veterans from the Weltkrieg, also performed small, coordinated raids against German transports and have been able to acquire quite the armoury. It's not yet clear what they are up to but it would be wise to reinforce our control over Flandres, risking loss of control elsewhere."
 bel.14.a: "Fall back into Antwerp, Limburg and Flemish-Brabant!"
 bel.14.b: "Fall back into Flemish-Brabant!"
 bel.14.c: "Reinforce all provinces!"

 bel.15.t: "11th of July"
 bel.15.d: "The 11th of July 1302 will always be remembered as the great victory over the French army at the Guldensporenslag. On this day an inferior Flemish army defeated the French knights. This victory marked an important point in the creation of the Independent Flemish movement and has been immortalised in the roman by "De leeuw van Vlaanderen" by Hendrik Conscience. With the temporary retreat of the German forces the Flemish Resistance memorises this day and has proclaimed the 11th of July a national holiday."
 bel.15.a: "Vlaanderen de Leeuw!"

 bel.16.t: "11th of July"
 bel.16.d: "The 11th of July 1302 will always be remembered as the great victory over the French army at the Guldensporenslag. On this day an inferior Flemish army defeated the French knights. This victory marked an important point in the creation of the Independent Flemish movement and has been immortalised in the roman by "De leeuw van Vlaanderen" by Hendrik Conscience. With German forces spread thin to suppress the resistance the Flemish Resistance has prepared a massive attack to liberate the cities of Bruges, Gent, Kortrijk and Oostende. Due to our small forces we were quickly overrun and after 5 hours of heavy fighting our last stronghold at the Gravensteen in Ghent fell and the Flemish Lion proudly waves atop its battlements."
 bel.16.a: "We have lost control over West and East Flanders!"

 bel.17.t: "The Flemish Offer a Deal"
 bel.17.d: "After the loss of great parts of Flanders, the Flemish Resistance has proposed a deal. They demand independence from Flanders-Wallonia and immediate retreat off all German forces out of Flandres. In exchange they are willing to remain part of the Reichspakt and fulfil their role as buffer state and will not aid the Syndicalists in Wallonia in their struggle."
 bel.17.a: "We have no choice but to accept these demands. (Play as Wallonia)"
 bel.17.c: "We have no choice but to accept these demands. (Play as Flanders)"
 bel.17.b: "Never! How dare they assume we would accept their proposal!"

 bel.18.t: "Walloons Hear of Flemish Victories"
 bel.18.d: "After the victories of the Flemish Resistance over the German forces the Walloons now have the opportunity to decide whether or not to work together with the Flemish for an unified Belgium or to seek affiliation with the Commune of France. The syndicalists are inclined towards joining the Commune and helping spread the socialist revolution. On the other hand the royalists would prefer to work together with the Flemish to unify the country and reinstate the king. After days of frenzied discussion the doors of the headquarters finally open and the decision is announced."
 bel.18.a: "We shall seek unification with the French Commune."
 bel.18.b: "We shall approach our Flemish brethren and try to rebuild Belgium."

 bel.19.t: "Flandres Receives Walloon Deal"
 bel.19.d: "After the proposal to the German government failed, the Flemish have now received a deal from the Walloon movement. They ask the Flemish to work together with them to ensure independence for all of Belgium and to reinstate the king."
 bel.19.a: "No. Flanders shall be independent!"
 bel.19.b: ""Eendracht maakt Macht!""L'union fait la force!""Unity is Strength!""

 bel.20.t: "Hainaut Attacks"
 bel.20.d: "After the Flemish and Walloons made their pact to unify Belgium, they launched an assault on the German Administration Offices in Mons and secured the governor and his family. They are now held hostage and the rebels are demanding the withdrawal of German forces from Hainaut. We have surrounded the building and are ready to move in if necessary. The chances of extracting the governor successfully are slim but we could re-secure the building to reinforce it against further attacks and to tighten our grip on the province."
 bel.20.a: "Launch an assault on the building!"
 bel.20.b: "We will have to give in."

 bel.21.t: "Hainaut Secured"
 bel.21.d: "After we stormed the building the rebels immediately executed the hostages and kept fighting to the last man. We were however able to retake the building with minimal losses and have established a perimeter. Barbed wire and machine gun posts were quickly installed to deter any further attack and part of the city has been evacuated to make place for the 2nd Walloon Division to set up camp."
 bel.21.a: "Very well."

 bel.22.t: "Rebels Push Into Antwerp"
 bel.22.d: "With renewed forces and help from Wallonia the Flemish Resistance has successfully begun pushing into Antwerp. Fighting in the streets immediately ensued and for three days there appeared to be no clear winner. The strategic situation changed when a tank depot fell to Flemish forces and the Germans retreated to the east side of the city. Simultaneously a push was orchestrated towards Boom and Dendermonde ensuring the liberation of most of Antwerp province."
 bel.22.a: "Fall back to Brussels."

 bel.23.t: "Flemish Forces Approach the Capital"
 bel.23.d: "With their victories in Antwerp and the retreat of German forces out of Limburg we are left with only Brussels and Wallonia. As the movement keeps winning they gather more support and by now they heavily outnumber us. The only forces we have left are the division located in Brussels and two in Wallonia. We will have to make an important decision which will decide the fate of the country. Will we retreat into Germany, thus abandoning Belgium or will we dig in and try to hold out as long as we can, hoping that Germany may recover quickly enough to support us?"
 bel.23.a: "We will not risk any more German blood."
 bel.23.b: "Dig in boys, its going to be a tough fight!"

 bel.24.t: "German Forces Evacuate Belgium"
 bel.24.d: "On September 13th 1936 at 2:37 PM in the Royal Palace the former King Adelbert signed the formal ceasefire treaty, resulting in his immediate abdication, the withdrawal of all German forces from his former territory and a truce between the reborn nation of Belgium and the German Empire. Hundreds of thousands of men, women and children have come out into the streets waving the Belgian flag, chanting the Brabançonne and celebrating the nation's regained independence. It truly is a great day for Belgium!"
 bel.24.a: ""Lang leve België!""Vive la Belgique!""Long live Belgium!""

 bel.241.t: "German Forces Evacuate Belgium"
 bel.241.d: "On September 20th 1936 at 2:37 PM in the Royal Palace the former King Adelbert signed the formal ceasefire treaty, resulting in his immediate abdication, the withdrawal of all German forces from his former territory and a truce between the reborn nation of Belgium and the German Empire. Hundreds of thousands of men, women and children have come out into the streets waving the Belgian flag, chanting the Brabançonne and celebrating the nation's regained independence. It truly is a great day for Belgium!"
 bel.241.a: ""Lang leve België!""Vive la Belgique!""Long live Belgium!""

 bel.25.t: "Germans Forces Pushed Back into Brussels"
 bel.25.d: "After our defeat at Mons and in return for the governor we have fallen back into Brussels where we have dug ourselves in. Any Walloon resistance will have to deal with our fortified position and prepared troops!"
 bel.25.a: "Watch out, those Walloons are everywhere!"

 bel.26.t: "The Walloons Hold Back"
 bel.26.d: "The Walloons have set up a perimeter around Brussels but appear not to be planning to immediately attack. They may be trying to secure Flanders first before moving against our troops' positions in the city."
 bel.26.a: "We must be cautious."

 bel.27.t: "Full Frontal Assault on Brussels"
 bel.27.d: "With our troops firmly dug in and awaiting the rebel attack, news has reached us of a German division stationed in Deutsch Wallonia being repositioned to Brussels to reinforce us and help ward off the Walloon attack. Unfortunately however, the rebels intercepted the message and have decided to immediately launch their operations. The troops surrounding Brussels moved in under artillery support and the tanks captured in Antwerp swiftly breached our first line of defence. This was followed up by intense fighting in the metropolitan area of Brussels, with especially fierce conflict engulfing Schaarbeek en Dilbeek. Here the soldiers fought house by house leading to heavy casualties on both sides. After eight hours of heavy fighting our garrison is no longer able to hold them off and the rebel army has begun marching on the palace."
 bel.27.a: "Retreat to Namur!"
 bel.27.b: "Surrender to the rebels."

 bel.28.t: "Last Stand of Flandres-Wallonia"
 bel.28.d: "Pushed back out of Brussels, the remaining army has fallen back to the southern city of Namur. Here reinforcements from the German Empire have recently arrived and using them we have been able to set up an adequate defence. We do however have a limited amount of supplies left after our defeat at Brussels and will most likely have to surrender within three months if we do not launch a counter-offensive with what little we have."
 bel.28.a: "Our situation is hopeless, we have to surrender."
 bel.28.b: "Launch a counter-offensive on the Walloon perimeter!"

 bel.29.t: "Counter-Offensive Fails"
 bel.29.d: "At 6:32 AM German artillery placed on the top of the hill opened fire on the Walloon defences. The barrage was followed up by an infantry assault trying to breach their line. Waves after waves of brave Germans threw themselves at the line but at 11:16 AM they had to retreat. The offensive has failed. German troops are exhausted and the Walloon line still stands."
 bel.29.a: "Surrender to the rebels."

#French Intervention
###########

 bel.30.t: "Walloon Syndicalists Request Communard Support"
 bel.30.d: "Radio transmissions between the syndicalist cells in Hainaut and the French army fortified behind the border have indicated that Walloon rebels are establishing contact with the Commune, likely to request support in their struggle. While France is unlikely to support them at this time, it would be wise to keep a close watch on the border."
 bel.30.a: "Let us hope that France stays out of this."

 bel.31.t: "Wallonia Calls For Aid"
 bel.31.d: "Members of the Walloon resistance have reached out to Paris, requesting our assistance in the ongoing Belgian Revolution. While they have had some mild successes, recent raids on their supply points has drastically reduced their equipment supplies and it doesn't look like they will be able to hold out much longer on their own. We could assist them by covertly sending volunteers and supplies to try and secure the valuable province for the Internationale and liberate the workers from German oppression."
 bel.31.a: "Send volunteers and equipment."
 bel.31.b: "We shouldn't anger the Germans."

 bel.32.t: "French 'Volunteers' Join the Walloon Resistance"
 bel.32.d: "Heavy pushes by Walloon cells and the breakthrough they achieved at Mons are indicating that they have received French support. While we have no proof of this, our ambassador to France has demanded that they not intervene. The Commune bluntly stated that they have not sent any volunteers to Wallonia and that German forces may be confusing French and Walloon soldiers in their defeats."
 bel.32.a: "Send further support to Hainaut."

 bel.321.t: "The Liège Revolution"
 bel.321.d: "While our troops have been steadily pushed back by Walloon-French troops, the workers of Liège have risen up and taken control of the city. Though small pockets of resistance continue to tenaciously fight back against the rebels, the city is as good as lost without reinforcement. With the fall of Liège all but assured, the resistance now controls the industrial capital of Wallonia and its most populous centre."
 bel.321.a: "Wallonia is escaping our hold."

 bel.322.t: "The Walloon Commune Declares Independence"
 bel.322.d: "After the fall of Liège and the subsequent capture of Namur, all of Wallonia has fallen firmly under rebel control. They have audaciously raised the Walloon coq hardi flag in Liège town square formally declaring independence for Wallonia. Flemish movements have used this moment to secure their independence as well but have sworn allegiance to Germany. The world's eyes are now squarely focussed on France who will almost certainly be responsible for deciding the outcome of this crisis."
 bel.322.a: "Vive La Wallonie!"

 bel.323.t: "Wallonia Seeks Allies"
 bel.323.d: "With our hold on Wallonia secure, the German Empire is mobilising rapidly on the Meuse border hoping to strike quickly and reassert control over the region. The Commune of France is our only hope at deterring this attack and it has been formally requested of them that they guarantee our independence."
 bel.323.a: "Help us Communards, you're our only hope."

 bel.324.t: "Wallonia Requests Communard Protection"
 bel.324.d: "After our troops successfully assisted the resistance in bringing down the Flemish-Walloon regime, the new Walloon government has requested that we protect them in case Germany decides to retaliate."
 bel.324.a: "Protect Wallonia."
 bel.324.b: "We don't want to anger Germany."

 bel.325.t: "France Guarantees Wallonia"
 bel.325.d: "French officials have confirmed to Liège that France will stand with Wallonia against any German assailment should the need arise."
 bel.325.a: "The proletariat stands united!"

 bel.326.t: "France Refuses to Guarantee Wallonia"
 bel.326.d: "Afraid of possible retaliation by the German Empire, the Commune of France has abandoned their ambitions to secure an independent Wallonia and has left us to die at the hands of a vengeful Reich."
 bel.326.a: "The Revolution seems at an end."

 bel.3261.t: "The Walloon Counter-Offensive"
 bel.3261.d: "Afraid of our military might, the French cowards have abandoned their Walloon allies, giving us the opportunity to strike and bring them back into our sphere."
 bel.3261.a: "We'll be home by midnight."

 bel.327.t: "The Commune Guarantees Wallonia"
 bel.327.d: "The Commune of France has expressed their interest in keeping Wallonia independent and have reinforced the Meuse border with their army. While they seem to be prepared to die for Wallonia, our troops are less secure of this and provoking an early war could prove detrimental to the recovering German economy."
 bel.327.a: "Wallonia or War!"
 bel.327.b: "Back down for now."

 bel.3271.t: "Germany Backs Down"
 bel.3271.d: "At 12 AM, German troops finally agreed to cease all hostilities and withdraw their forces from Walloon territory. The Pont de Fragnée, built during the Liège Internationale of 1905 to display the power of Belgium, was used to sign the treaty after which all troops fell back to their respective lines. A demilitarised zone was established on the Eastern bank of the Meuse to secure the protection of the industry and people there and to prevent Internationale troops from establishing themselves beyond the Meuse."
 bel.3271.a: "Peace in our Time."

 bel.328.t: "Wallonia or War!"
 bel.328.d: "Confident in their military supremacy and aware that the loss of Wallonia could cause issues in the rest of Mitteleuropa, the German Empire has presented us with an ultimatum. Either we retreat fully from Wallonia and allow German troops to retake it without bloodshed or they will attack and do so by force."
 bel.328.a: "Reject their demands."
 bel.328.b: "We can't risk a war."

 bel.3210.t: "The Internationale Stands by Wallonia"
 bel.3210.d: "With a German attack imminent and the refusal of their ultimatum by the French government, we have decided to formally join the Internationale and stand united against the threat of imperialism."
 bel.3210.a: "To arms!"

 bel.3211.t: "The French Refuse Our Ultimatum"
 bel.3211.d: "With French refusal telegraphed to Berlin last night, German troops have been ordered to move in at once and secure the capital of Liège before sweeping into France. Flemish troops have pledged their service to us as well and are moving in to take Mons before the French can reorganise."
 bel.3211.a: "The Weltkrieg has begun!"

 bel.33.t: "Radio Silence from the Commune of France"
 bel.33.d: "Afraid of provoking the German Empire, the Commune of France has decided to stay out of the conflict dooming the Walloon rebellion to an early death. Our troops who recovered from their defeat in Charleroi are already converging on the last syndicalist strongholds, hoping to end the rebellion in mere days."
 bel.33.a: "German might is not to be questioned."

 bel.331.t: "Fall of Charleroi"
 bel.331.d: "Flandres-Wallonia troops accompanied by German reinforcements successfully breached the outer defences of Charleroi this morning and are swarming through the main streets alongside Panzer support. Resistance cells were unable to counter our armoured forces due to a lack of equipment and finally surrendered in the evening to the German general. With this blow, the syndicalist revolution is all but over."
 bel.331.a: "Shift our focus towards Flanders."

 bel.332.t: "Flemish Resistance Under Attack"
 bel.332.d: "After the Fall of Charleroi and the end of the Walloon rebellion, the rebels in Flanders find themselves backed against a corner. The Vlaamse Wacht has informed us that prominent members of the Flemish Council were spotted near the Dutch border, likely attempting to win their favour and prompt Dutch intervention."
 bel.332.a: "The Netherlands would be wise not to interfere with our affairs."

 bel.34.t: "The Kingdom Strikes Back"
 bel.34.d: "With no support from the other side of the language border and outgunned by the German government the rebellion is doomed to fail. Repression will be severe but righteous as we will try to avoid any further rebellions. The government will have to be reformed to make sure that we are better prepared next time."
 bel.34.a: "Let's get on with it!"

#Elections in Free Belgium
###########

 bel.360.t: "Monarchy or Republic?"
 bel.360.d: "The German pretender has been ousted and the provisionary government has called for formal elections to be held. Two separate ballots will have to be cast, firstly deciding on which type of government the state will embrace and secondly to decide which parties will lead us through these troubling times. King Albert I, still residing in Canada is watching events at home with great interest as the people decide on whether or not he may return. The Liberal and Socialist parties are however not so keen on his return and are hoping that the people opt for a more democratic state ruled by and for the people."
 bel.360.a: "The monarchy will be reinstated."
 bel.360.b: "Belgium will reform into a Republic."

 bel.361.t: "Belgian Elections"
 bel.361.d: "As the royalist faction of the government brings back the king, the people have voted for a prime minister who will guide Belgium into the future. Verdinaso, a national party within the Flemish Council, has played an important part in the rebellion and has great plans of expansion and a greater Diets Empire. The KP, the largest pre-Weltkrieg party and biggest proponent of the rebellion in Flanders, is trying to reestablish their Party and has placed Frans van Cauwelaert as their candidate. Finally the BWP, or Belgian Workers Party, has tried to win as much support within the worker class as possible. The party however is fractured and hasn't proposed a single decisive candidate but rather three factions."
 bel.361.a: "Verdinaso."
 bel.361.b: "Catholic Party."
 bel.361.c: "BWP."

 bel.362.t: "Belgian Elections"
 bel.362.d: "As decided on the First Belgian Congress, the Belgian Republic has been founded. To form a strong government however the Belgian people have voted for their first President. As the rebellion was led by many different factions there is no clear winner. The BWP, Belgian Workers Party, has been divided by internal struggles and has not proposed a clear candidate. Three main splinter factions have been created and are each proposing their own agenda. Paul-Henri Spaak, influenced by his liberal heritage has created a social liberal faction and has proposed a clear plan to guide Belgium. Another movement has declared their support for a grand industrial plan, Plan Van Acker, and have distanced themselves from the main party. The remnants of the party are still struggling to reform the party but have promised to continue their syndicalist agenda. Lastly there is the Liberal party, led by Paul Emile Janson, who will guide the country to the image of our Dutch neighbours."
 bel.362.a: "Choose Van Acker."
 bel.362.b: "Vote Social-Liberal for the best of both worlds!"
 bel.362.c: "The Liberals Take It."
 bel.362.e: "The Radicals Within The BWP Secure Victory."

 bel.41.t: "King Albert I Returns!"
 bel.41.d: "As the Royalists restore the monarchy King Albert I, formerly known as Van Saksen-Coburg Gotha now as Van België, sets sail in Canada as the first king restored to his country. Over in Belgium all preparations are made for Albert to swiftly and without issues remount his throne."
 bel.41.a: "Long live Albert I!"

 bel.42.t: "Plan Van Acker"
 bel.42.d: "With Achille Van Acker and his social democrat government firmly in control, they start to unravel the first phases of their plan. To combat the depression caused by Black Monday they have decided to switch to a planned economy. This plan consists of the creation of 5 Economic Secretaries led by technocrats to oversee the further steps. They will have the primary task to rebuild the country by reducing unemployment and starting to nationalise the Basic Industries. With these industries under control they will then better be able to guide Belgium to economic stability and prevent another crisis."
 bel.42.a: "Very well."

 bel.421.t: "Reformed BWP"
 bel.421.d: "As Jacquemotte has taken charge of the party and unravels his plans for the future of Belgium, many within the party are worried about their position. Jacquemotte has proclaimed that he will purify the party and will kick out all non-syndicalist members. Only with a fully loyal council will he be able to push through the large reforms that he is planning. Rumours are that he plans to create a new Belgium state mirroring the French Commune."
 bel.421.a: "What will the future hold for Belgium?"

 bel.43.t: "Plan Spaak"
 bel.43.d: "With Paul-Henri Spaak and his social liberal government firmly in control, they start to unravel the first phases of their plan. To combat the depression caused by Black Monday they have decided to switch to state capitalism. They will start by reforming the ministries into one strong government who will invest heavily in large scale construction projects to reduce unemployment. They will instate smaller provincial councils to better listen to the needs of the people and will try to abstain as much as possible from military matters focusing on rebuilding the economy."
 bel.43.a: "Very well."

 bel.44.t: "Foundation of the Belgian Republic"
 bel.44.d: "With the Royalist party firmly renounced, Belgium can finally start moving towards a republic. Governed by dukes, kings and emperors for all of their history, the Belgian people have decided to renounce the monarchy and move towards a decentralised government. They seek to turn Belgium into a democratic state, free of the oppression of the nobility and with the Citizen alone placed in the spotlight."
 bel.44.a: "Belgians All!"

 bel.45.t: "Reinforce National Unity"
 bel.45.d: "With Verdinaso firmly in control of the Government they have started to unveil their plan. They will try to strengthen their position by eliminating the opposition and re-militarise Belgium. Then they will seek a preferably weak target to attack. Nothing strengthens the country more than a common enemy, no? Soon the world shall feel the power of a united Belgium!"
 bel.45.a: "Very well."

#Treaty of Arlon
 bel.461.t: "The Belgian Revolution"
 bel.461.d: "While we were busy solving our own problems, Adelbert, king of Flanders-Wallonia, has been deposed and sent packing by his people. Even though this an outrageous event we have to handle the situation carefully as a war will hinder our recovery and may provoke syndicalist aggression. Delegates of the new Belgian state however, have come up with a proposal of their own. They request we sign a treaty guaranteeing their newfound sovereignty, and rebalancing our currently one-sided economic system. In exchange they would rejoin the Reichspakt, expand their army and be our first line of defence against the syndicalist threat. German holdings and companies would remain in charge of large parts of the industry and special programmes would temporarily be kept aiding German citizens in their integration into Belgium, or alternatively their return home."
 bel.461.a: "Try to negotiate with them."
 bel.461.b: "Germans do not give in, attack at once!"

 bel.46.t: "Treaty of Arlon"
 bel.46.d: "Deep in the Ardennes, in the city of Arlon, German and Belgian representatives have gathered to discuss the future relations between the two countries. Multiple proposals have been put on the table by both sides until finally an agreement was reached. Belgium would stay in the Reichspakt and help the German Empire in its wars in exchange full recognition of its sovereignty. While the German delegation can be persuaded to recognise our independence, all requests for the return of Verviers or Luxembourg have thus far been swept off the table."
 bel.46.a: "The treaty is fine as is. Sign it."
 bel.46.b: "Demand the return of our occupied territories and Luxembourg."
 bel.46.c: "We want nothing more to do with the Germans!"

 bel.462.t: "Belgium Demands Yet More"
 bel.462.d: "Even though we agreed to nearly all of their demands and almost reached an accord, the Belgian Prime Minister suddenly rose up and declared that no treaty would be signed unless we hand over Luxembourg. This was met with protest from our outraged delegates refusing to accept such ridiculous demands. Some see this sudden about face however as an excuse to stay out of the Reichspakt and search for other allies. Though it appears those who embrace the realpolitik of the situation of seen it fit to offer only the return of occupied Verviers to them, whilst Luxembourg remains as fief of the Kaiserreich."
 bel.462.a: "Offer them only the return of Verviers."
 bel.462.b: "Accept their extra demands."
 bel.462.c: "Leave the Congress."
 bel.462.e: "They dare insult us!?"

 bel.463.t: "The German Empire Accepts"
 bel.463.d: "To the immense surprise of all, the German delegation has given in and accepted to return Verviers. An agreement has been reached and the treaty signed. Only formalities and the evening gala remain. "
 bel.463.a: "This is fantastic!"

 bel.464.t: "Treaty of Arlon"
 bel.464.d: "With an official ceasefire between the Empire and the Belgian rebels, we have agreed to listen to their demands. They demand full independence from Germany but promise to remain in the Reichspakt military alliance to assist us on the western border. While agreeing to these demands could be seen as a disgrace to the mighty German behemoth and could perhaps even spark resistance in the East, we have to avoid overextending ourselves in these times of crisis."
 bel.464.a: "The treaty is signed!"

 bel.465.t: "Belgium Refuses the Congress of Arlon"
 bel.465.d: "It seems the upstart Belgians have completely rejected our generous offer and turned their backs on us. With this clear slap to the face, our war hawks have demanded that the Kaiserreich set things right and move in to crush these upstarts. However, cooler heads may prevail, with [GER.GetRulingParty] opting to bide it's time and deal with the problem at a later date, when this plague of Black Monday no longer afflict us."
 bel.465.a: "We will come for them soon enough."
 bel.465.b: "We don't remember offering them a choice in the matter."

 bel.466.t: "The German Counteroffer"
 bel.466.d: "It seems that the Germans have agreed to return Verviers, but have refused to entertain a cession of Luxembourg. This would mean that Arlon would rejoin Belgium, which would appease those within the more extreme fringes of the political spectrum and be a win in the eyes of the Public. Of course this would be mean that Luxembourg, would remain under the Kaiserreich and though this is a smaller pill to swallow, there are those who state it's all or nothing."
 bel.466.a: "Very well, we accept."
 bel.466.b: "Luxembourg is non-negotiable."

 bel.47.t: "Arlon Treaty Talks Fail"
 bel.47.d: "The German Empire has refused our proposal and decided to leave the summit. There will be no alliance this time and no concessions."
 bel.47.a: "We will seek other allies."

 bel.48.t: "Treaty of Arlon Signed"
 bel.48.d: "With the Belgian government agreeing to the German terms, the treaty has been signed. Germany will recognise Belgian independence and in exchange Belgium will remain in the Reichspakt."
 bel.48.a: "Together we stand strong."

 bel.481.t: "Peace with the Belgians?"
 bel.481.d: "Clearly the Belgians have proven to be just as tenacious as they were twenty years ago. Our people are losing the will to fight what they see as a pointless war, and we are being urged to sign a peace treaty with the Belgian government."
 bel.481.a: "Very well, let us contact Brussels."
 bel.481.b: "Never!"

 bel.482.t: "The Germans Refuse Peace"
 bel.482.d: "The warmongering Germans have sent us further messages of defiance and imperialism! They demand that we surrender utterly, subjecting ourself under the rule of King Adelbert once more. We will never accept these terms, so the war must go on."
 bel.482.a: "Until we stand in Berlin!"

 bel.483.t: "Peace with the Germans?"
 bel.483.d: "The Germans have had enough of their bullying for now, it seems. They are meeting with our representatives in Antwerp to work out the terms of an arrangement, one which could result in our reacquisition of parts of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg taken from us after the last war. Should we accept?"
 bel.483.a: "We want nothing more than peace."
 bel.483.b: "We will have peace for the return of our lands in the south."
 bel.483.c: "We demand the integration of the entire Grand Duchy of Luxembourg!"
 bel.483.e: "Never!"

 bel.484.t: "The Belgians Refuse Peace"
 bel.484.d: "The Belgians have refused our offer of peace. They apparently aim for the total destruction of our empire, preferring it to peace and prosperity."
 bel.484.a: "They will learn the consequences of their stubbornness."

 bel.485.t: "The Treaty of Antwerp"
 bel.485.d: "The Belgians have agreed to our proposals for peace. They have pledged to remain neutral and disarmed for at least a year, and in return we will agree to recognise their government and borders. There is once more peace in Europe!"
 bel.485.a: "Long may it last!"

 bel.486.t: "The Belgian Demand at Antwerp"
 bel.486.d.wallonia: "The Belgians have met with our representatives at Antwerp, and are willing to conduct a peace treaty. However, they demand the retrocession of Verviers, annexed to the Rhineland in 1919. Should we agree to their offer?"
 bel.486.d.luxemburg: "The Belgians have met with our representatives at Antwerp, and are willing to conduct a peace treaty. However, they demand the retrocession of Verviers, annexed to the Rhineland in 1919, as well as the full annexation of the Grand Duchy of Luxemburg, claiming that all of the Low Countries should be freed from 'foreign occupation'. Should we agree to their offer?"
 bel.486.a: "We accept these terms."
 bel.486.b: "We will give away no inch of our lands!"

 bel.487.t: "The Treaty of Antwerp"

 bel.49.d: "Backed into a corner by superior Flemish-Walloon forces, the remnants of the Flemish resistance have contacted us to request intervention in the Second Belgian Revolution. They are willing to support reunification with the Netherlands should we assist them and are hoping for a peaceful resolution to the conflict through our influence."
 bel.49.a: "Support the Flemish resistance."
 bel.49.b: "Stay out of German affairs."

 bel.50.t: "End of the Flemish Resistance"
 bel.50.d: "With no support from the Dutch nor Walloons, the Flemish resistance will inevitably slowly get pushed back by the better equipped German Empire."
 bel.50.a: "We will put a swift end to this rebellion!"

 bel.51.t: "Dutch Intervention: Treaty of Terneuzen"
 bel.51.d: "Dutch officials have agreed to the requests of the Flemish resistance and have sent in Dutch divisions to secure the cities of Antwerpen and Gent. While our Flemish-Walloon divisions are no match for the numerically stronger Dutch forces, they have taken a big risk by angering the German giant."
 bel.51.a: "We can only wait for an answer from Berlin."

 bel.77.t: "Flanders Secedes From the Union"
 bel.77.d: "After our troops fell back safely to the Language Border, granting the Dutch control over the major Flemish cities, the Flemish government has announced their independence. As agreed upon in the treaty of Terneuzen, they immediately afterwards rejoined the Kingdom of the Netherlands for protection."
 bel.77.a: "Lang Leve Vlaanderen! (play as Flanders)"
 bel.77.b: "We will bring them back into the fold."

 bel.771.t: "Dutch Takeover of Flanders"
 bel.771.d: "During the independence stuggle currently going on in Flanders-Wallonia, it seems that the Dutch have stepped in and retaken control over Flanders as agreed upon in the Treaty of Terneuzen. This is however an outrageous infraction on our Reichspakt alliance and as such we can send them an ultimatum to either join us or die fighting. The Dutch are very likely to agree to our very reasonable terms and it may even prove to provide better stability on our western border."
 bel.771.a: "Send the ultimatum."
 bel.771.b: "They infringed on our sovereignty, we will declare war at once!"
 bel.771.c: "Back down, we have more important matters."

 bel.772.t: "German Ultimatum"
 bel.772.d: "Unhappy with our recent expansion into their territory, the Reich has given us the chance to right our supposed fault and join their Reichspakt alliance. They strongly insisted that disobeying their request will result into an immediate declaration of war, for which we are not at all prepared."
 bel.772.a: "We will join them."
 bel.772.b: "Come and get us!"

 bel.52.t: "We have Refused!"

 bel.53.t: "Schelde Discussion"
 bel.53.d: "Ever since the Treaty of London we have been relying on the Dutch to dredge the Westerschelde. Without this, the harbour of Antwerp can't be reached by large cargo ships thus hindering our trade potential. As the south bank of the river is mainly populated by Flemish people we propose that the Dutch government helps us in exchange for us abandoning our claim on Zeeuws-Vlaanderen."
 bel.53.a: "Let's hope they agree."

 bel.54.t: "Schelde Discussion"
 bel.54.d: "As we hold control of the Westerschelde we decide which ships leave and enter the harbour of Antwerp. The Belgians however have asked us that we help them out by dredging the Westerschelde in exchange for them abandoning their claim on Zeeuws-Vlaanderen."
 bel.54.a: "We will gladly help our southern friends."
 bel.54.b: "Which claim?"

 bel.55.t: "The Dutch Agree"
 bel.55.d: "With support from the Dutch government we should be able to expand the harbour."
 bel.55.a: "Antwerp will once again take its place on the world map!"

 bel.56.t: "The Dutch Refuse"
 bel.56.d: "With refusal from the Dutch government to cooperate it seems that we will only get our goal through war."
 bel.56.a: "Then war it shall be!"

 bel.70.t: "Assassination of Theunis"
 bel.70.d: "In retaliation for our attacks on their leaders, the Syndicalist movement has struck back. During a meeting concerning the economic crisis and the national treasury, a bomb was detonated wounding many of the attendees and killing Georges Theunis. The Catholic Party is outraged by this blatant attack on one of their most respected and has announced that there will be consequences. A unified movement by Catholics and Syndicalist may not be a possibility anymore."
 bel.70.a: "Good. Let them destroy themselves."

 bel.71.t: "Revenge for Theunis"
 bel.71.d: "At 8.38 May 18 opens the unexpecting aide of Adhemar Hennaut the door to his bed chamber. There she finds Hennaut killed in his sleep and an half open window. Catholic extremists have decided to strike back and have assassinated Adhemar Hennaut as revenge for the bombing of Georges Theunis. With both groups now having attacked the other, there has never been a bleaker future for an independent Belgium."
 bel.71.a: "Divided we shall destroy them!"

 bel.72.t: "Flanders Declares Independence!"
 bel.72.d: "The Flemish movement has taken action now that we are at war the French Commune and have declared their independence. Blocking half our resources and factories things are not looking well for our little country. Even the capital of Brussels has been overrun and Adelbert was forced to flee to Liège where he will try to lead the remnants of his kingdom."
 bel.72.a: "Damn you Flanders!"

 bel.73.t: "The Belgian Question"
 bel.73.d: "Now that our country is recovering we can look into the Belgian Question again. We weren't able to assist Adelbert when a full scale rebellion took place in his country but now we finally have the opportunity to bring Belgium back into the fold."
 bel.73.a: "We demand the submission of Belgium!"
 bel.73.b: "There are more important matters to attend to."

 bel.74.t: "Germany Demands Belgian Submission"
 bel.74.d: "The ambassador from the German Empire has presented our government with an ultimatum. Either we accept German demands and become once again part of their empire as a satellite, or we stand and fight to defend Belgium once again. Hardened by the bitter fighting against troops of the old Flanders-Walloon regime, our stoic populace is ready for another engagement to defend their homeland."
 bel.74.a: "We have no choice but to give in."
 bel.74.b: "Belgium will never surrender to those German Devils!"

 bel.75.t: "Belgium Refuses Our Demands"
 bel.75.d: "The Belgian government has politely declined and has put our ambassador on the first train to the German border. The time for words has come to an end, the time for steel has come."
 bel.75.a: "Attack at once!"

 bel.78.t: "Desertion Crisis Resolved"
 bel.78.d: "With the country starting to fall back in line we have been able to spare men to help round up any deserters for execution. Slowly but surely, the mass desertion crisis has been stymied and we are are now more capable of replenishing our depleted army with troops."
 bel.78.a: "Discipline is always effective."

 bel.79.t: "Flanders Restored to Our Control"
 bel.79.d: "With the Flemish rebellion quelled we can start repairing our factories, damaged in the war. Even though the Flemish population is not yet completely cooperative we will surely get the job done."
 bel.79.a: "Keep up the good work."

#Events German Control
 bel.807.t: "Front de l'indépendance"
 bel.807.d: "We have received shocking reports from the Walloon detachment of the Feldgendarmerie indicating a recent surge in armed socialist resistance. A new resistance group, calling themselves "Front de l'indépendance" is growing in size and deadliness. Determined to bring totalism to the state of Flanders-Wallonia, they do not shy away from using armed violence against those who oppose them."
 bel.807.a: "Formulate a plan of action and destroy this resistance!"

 bel.808.t: "Discovery of Die Rote Kapelle"
 bel.808.d: "Die Rote Kapelle or the Red Orchestra, is the largest syndicalist resistance network in Europe. With members spread across the continent and receiving assistance from both Paris and London, this intelligence group is huge threat to our national security. Due to their non-violent nature, they are difficult to track down and previously all attempts at trying to root them out have yielded poor results.\n\nNow, however it appears that Efremov, leader of the Flanders-Walloon branch has been captured in Oostende while seeking to move between safehouses. He was immediately interrogated and at last he gave up important members of the movement, representing a new breakthrough in our efforts. After a wave of arrests in the following hours, thirty members of Die Rote Kapelle were caught and executed. A heavy blow has been dealt to the organisation."
 bel.808.a: "Finally, results!"

 bel.805.t: "Expansion of the Feldgendarmerie"
 bel.805.d: "News of our difficulties in pacifying Flanders-Wallonia has reached Berlin and apparently greatly troubled the Kaiser. German geopolitical interests in Western Europe, centring on the Ludendorfflinie, are reliant on a secure front in former Belgium. Therefore the Kaiser has given the order to send a specialised division of the Feldgendarmerie to aid the Flemish-Walloon police force in their struggle. Still, relying on the aid of foreign forces to combat our own citizens may however further alienate the regime and our king from his subjects."
 bel.805.a: "Accept assistance from Berlin."
 bel.805.b: "Politely decline German help."

 bel.81.t: "Germany Demands Increased Taxation"
 bel.81.d: "With the German Empire slowly recovering its confidence and power from Black Monday, they have seen fit to demand that our king institute a large tax aimed at the middle and lower class to help the German economy. Unfortunately, Flanders-Wallonia has also been hit very hard as the country is heavily industrialised and due to the crisis many citizens have been left without jobs.\n\nWhile a massive tax imposition would certainly improve our relations with Berlin, it may severely hurt our own chances of a quick recovery and stir up anger among the people."
 bel.81.a: "Implement a high tax."
 bel.81.b: "A smaller tax should be sufficient."
 bel.81.c: "This is far too harsh a demand!"

 bel.82.t: "Trade Agreement With the German Empire"
 bel.82.d: "With the onset of a new economic climate due to the impact of the Black Monday crisis, we have the opportunity to renegotiate a trade deal with the Reich. With a strong industry based around steel, textiles and chemical expertise, Flanders-Wallonia is without a doubt one of the major industrial powers in the Reichspakt. As a result a large proportion of German imports come from our country, despite our political subjugation. With this new opportunity however, it is now time to renew the agreement and decide whether to keep focussing on exporting to the Empire or to focus more on benefitting Flanders-Wallonia itself."
 bel.82.a: "Focus on benefitting the Empire."
 bel.82.b: "We should favour neither party."
 bel.82.c: "Focus on a Flanders-Wallonia first policy."

 bel.83.t: "Weapons Production For the German Army"
 bel.83.d: "Due to Germany's massive increase in demand for armaments caused by serious border tensions with the French Commune, the German Army is in need of specialised equipment. Flanders-Walloon expertise concerning small arms and anti-tank cannons is widely appreciated and praised even in the higher echelons of German High Command. Due to this reputation, the Reich has offered us a new deal where we supply them with weapons in exchange for monetary compensation. Still, due to Germany's ravenous appetite for new arms our own forces may suffer supply shortages if we agree to the deal."
 bel.83.a: "Export as many weapons as they require."
 bel.83.b: "Prioritise our own army."

 bel.831.t: "State Treasury Investigation"
 bel.831.d: "Every year a special commission is established by Parliament to investigate the entire monetary balance of the country. This has, since the start of the occupation, traditionally been the role of members of the Flemish Council, however due to recent events the king has become more inclined to let an outside German commission investigate to make sure that any corruption or covert operations are discovered. This would cause extreme turmoil in Parliament though, as members would see this as yet another power grab by the king and the German puppet regime neglecting the wishes of the people."
 bel.831.a: "Request that Germany appoints an external commission."
 bel.831.b: "Allow the Flemish Council to handle the affair."

 bel.832.t: "The Investigation Progresses"
 bel.832.d: "As the Flemish Council goes through the budget like it has done every year it has encountered a large source of expenses. Recent renovations to the Palace and the German Embassy have cost the taxpayer untold millions of Marks. In these troubling times such expenses should not be allowed and will only further increase the burden on the common man. Therefore the Council has proposed to the king that he delay the works until after the Black Monday crisis abates."
 bel.832.a: "Nonsense, a king cannot rule without a palace!"
 bel.832.b: "We will temporarily retreat to Laken until work can resume."

 bel.842.t: "German Favouritism"
 bel.842.d: "Citizens of Flanders-Wallonia, though theoretically equal before the law, exist alongside another social hierarchy imposed unofficially from above. German immigrants and imperial citizens are far more likely to reach high ranking positions in our society and seem able to exert more influence over the country than Flemish-Walloon citizens. While this way of handling things is appreciated by the German population, it causes great discontent among the rest of the citizenry.\n\nJoris Van Severen, a leading member of the Flemish Council has proposed combating this favouritism and indirect discrimination through a series of strong new measures. While such moves would be greatly beneficial for social harmony, they would inevitably receive fierce opposition from the Reich."
 bel.842.a: "We will not change our way of life for these pesky peasants."
 bel.842.b: "Allow Van Severen to go ahead."

 bel.843.t: "German Citizens Protest"
 bel.843.d: "Due to recent reforms introduced by Joris Van Severen concerning the status of German citizens, many have marched on the capital today to protest against this sudden u-turn by the Government. Even though their numbers are small, a large outflux of German money caused by their distrust of the Government could be catastrophic for our economy.\n\nVan Severen has proposed a very drastic plan which would allow us to seize the Flemish-Walloon holdings of Germans in the event of revolt or mass-evacuation. It's clear that such bold plans to combat capital flight would provoke severe hostility from the Fatherland and especially amongst our own German population."
 bel.843.a: "Let's not do anything rash."
 bel.843.b: "Allow Van Severen to go ahead."

 bel.844.t: "German Capital Flight and Emigration"
 bel.844.d: "Due to not letting Van Severen handle the situation, many of the richer Germans who benefited greatly from our favouritism policy, large sums of money are leaving the country. We can introduce a small tax cut for these upper class citizens to make them more likely to stay."
 bel.844.a: "Propose the tax cut."
 bel.844.b: "We don't need their kind anyway!"

 bel.849.t: "Reform the Voting System"
 bel.849.d: "To further consolidate his power, the king has decided to reverse the universal suffrage that was only recently introduced in Flanders-Wallonia. As such his commands will be unchallenged as only the most loyal of his subjects will have their voting rights preserved. Advisors in the Government however have suggested that the king should not take such drastic action and instead should merely 'influence' the results of the elections."
 bel.849.a: "Reintroduce census voting."
 bel.849.b: "Rig universal suffrage elections."

#Factions
 bel.101.t: "Creation of the Dutch-Belgian Treaty Organisation"
 bel.101.d: "A diplomatic mission from the reborn country of Belgium has approached us. They seek to bolster relations between our two nations and strengthen our position on the world by forming an alliance. They propose that together we might deter hostile action and ensure that we both prosper. Accepting this proposal would however damage our relation with Germany and we might not be strong enough to protect them from the prying eyes of the Internationale."
 bel.101.a: "the Low Countries shall stand in unison!"
 bel.101.b: "Refuse their application."

 bel.102.t: "Belgium Seeks to Join the [ROOT.GetFactionName]"
 bel.102.d.entente: "A diplomatic mission from the reborn country of Belgium has approached us. They have reminded us of the Treaty of London and the strength of the Anglo-Belgian alliance for which we fought for in the Weltkrieg. They are in a tricky position however, and relations with Germany will surely be severely damaged if we choose to accept. Even so, an allied Belgium would also provide an excellent base of operations against the Internationale."
 bel.102.d.internationale: "A diplomatic mission from the reborn country of Belgium has approached us. They would like to join the [ROOT.GetFactionName] and be part of the coalition against Germany. They are however, not a fully syndicalist regime and many in our government see this as a futile attempt to protect themselves from the World Revolution. Other voices say that they are situated in a vital location and that an alliance with them will only strengthen us."
 bel.102.a: "We welcome Belgium into the [ROOT.GetFactionName]!"
 bel.102.b: "We accept, but they must return Dunkirk."
 bel.102.c: "Refuse their application."

 bel.103.t: "An Alliance with [FROM.GetNameDef]"
 bel.103.d.default: "Our proposal to join the [FROM.GetFactionName] has been accepted. A great meeting took place between the representatives of our countries in the Egmont palace in the centre of Brussels. The wonderful palace was the perfect scene to announce a new fruitful cooperation, which holds great promises for the future."
 bel.103.d.benesam: "Our proposal to form the Dutch-Belgian Treaty Organisation has been accepted. The Dutch delegation, including the prime minister, was hosted in the Egmont palace in the centre of Brussels. The wonderful palace was the perfect scene for fruitful talks, holding many promises for the future of the region, and finally ending with an agreement. It is certain that never again the Dutch-Belgian brothers would be divided."
 bel.103.a: "Eenheid!"

 bel.104.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Demands the Return of Dunkirk"
 bel.104.d: "An answer returned from the [FROM.GetAdjective] foreign affairs. They are willing to accept this offer and would be glad to accept Belgium among their allies. However, a problem remains, it is impossible for them to accept while we still hold on the city of Dunkirk, transferred to us from France by the Germans after the Weltkrieg. While the surrounding countryside can be considered Flemish, it is certain that the city itself is decidedly populated by French workers. The French government has thus never stopped to claim it as theirs. If we still want in the alliance, we will have to content the French and return Dunkirk."
 bel.104.a: "Very well, this is a sacrifice we have to make."
 bel.104.b: "Impossible! Dunkirk belongs to us!"

 bel.105.t: "Belgium Returns Dunkirk"
 bel.105.d: "Upon receiving our message, the comrades in Belgium have heard reason. They answered with another telegraph stating that they recognise Dunkirk has always been French, and that its temporary separation from France has only been the work of the imperialists in Berlin. Thus, they will cede Dunkirk again to the government of the Commune, and enter in the military alliance of the Internationale."
 bel.105.a: "Welcome, brothers!"

 bel.106.t: "Belgium Refuses to Returns Dunkirk"
 bel.106.d: "In a surprising move, the telegraph received today from Brussels stated that the Belgian government refused to return the city of Dunkirk! This show of imperialism on the French town is truly shocking, coming from so-called comrades, and it is unsure whether we can even accept to continue negotiations. It has to be kept in mind however that Belgium is a strategic piece in Europe. Located between France and Germany and hosting numerous resources and a large industry, it would be a valuable asset in the Internationale. It is now our choice to decide, can the behaviour of the Belgian government be excused?"
 bel.106.a: "Belgium is more valuable than Dunkirk."
 bel.106.b: "Break off the negotiations."

 bel.107.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Relents"
 bel.107.d: "Quite surprisingly, our refusal to hand over Dunkirk didn't stop the intentions of the Internationale. It seems that in the end, the pure strategic benefit of having us in the alliance was enough to continue the negotiations. [FROM.GetNameDefCap] is now ready to make us enter in the military alliance of the Internationale, scot-free."
 bel.107.a: "Magnificent!"

 bel.108.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Breaks Off Negotiations"
 bel.108.d: "\"A shocking show of nationalism\" The answer of the Internationale to our refusal to hand over Dunkirk was firm. It is, according to them, impossible to continue negotiations with a government deep enough into nationalism that they would refuse to let the French of Dunkirk rejoin their homeland. They justified their request by pointing out the artificial character of the division, born of post-Weltkrieg imperialism. The long explanations we've sent in our refusal and our shows of good will made nothing to change their mind. It seems we will be alone for the foreeseeable future."
 bel.108.a: "So much for socialist solidarity!"

 bel.109.t: "The Return of Dunkerque"
 bel.109.d: "The context of negotiations between the Internationale and Belgium has allowed to discuss the matter of the city of Dunkirk. The city, mostly inhabited by Frenchmen, has been in Belgian hands since the end of the Weltkrieg because of imperialist German plans in the region. Our government has since then never stopped to claim the city and its surrounding countryside as ours.\n\nIn the process of the negotiations, the Belgian government agreed to hand us back Dunkirk in order to join the military alliance. This news was met with great joy in Dunkirk, where the population applauded the corps of the Lille militia sent to take the city. This is also a great victory for our government."
 bel.109.a: "Next stop, Alsace-Lorraine!"

 bel.110.t: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] Refusal"
 bel.110.d.default: "Our proposal to join the faction has been rejected. No one exactly knows the reason of this refusal but we can speculate it might be because of the small size of our country, or for personal reasons. In any case, the unfortunate news has severely damaged relations between our countries."
 bel.110.d.benesam: "Our proposal to form the Dutch-Belgian Treaty Organisation has been rejected. No one exactly knows the reason of this refusal, as our relations with the Dutch Kingdom has always been quite good. It is possible the Dutch might have other strategic orientations in mind. In any case, the unfortunate news has damaged relations between our countries."
 bel.110.a: "We can only be disappointed by their foolish mistake."

 bel.111.t: "The Koninklijke Academie"
 bel.111.d: "The next step towards Belgian-Dutch cooperation is the creation of the Royal Academy of Science, made up of the top minds of both Belgium and the Netherlands. The Academy, sit in Brussels near the University, is officially headed by the monarchs of both countries, and is in large part sponsored on the budget of the royal housrs of Belgium and Nassau. The Academy will lead research projects in physics and chemistry, which will directly benefit our military alliance, but also in history, literature and philosophy, particularly focusing on the cultural links between our two countries. We have high hopes that this project will be the forefront of technological progress in our organisation and will inspire many more students and workers to cooperate with their counterparts."
 bel.111.a: "Excellent."

#National Holidays
 bel.117.t: "11th of July"
 bel.117.d: "The 11th of July 1302 will always be remembered as the date of a great victory over the French army at the Guldensporenslag. On that day an inferior Flemish army, supported by troops from Namur, defeated the far superior French knights. This victory marked an important point in the creation of the Independent Flemish movement and has been immortalised in the roman by "De leeuw van Vlaanderen" by Hendrik Conscience. As many see our current national situation as dire as back then, support for the movement is at an all time high."
 bel.117.a: "Suppress any festivities."
 bel.117.b: "Let them have their day of glory."

 bel.217.t: "21st of July"
 bel.217.d: "This day marks the crowning of the first Belgian monarch in 1831. On the 4th it was decided by the National Congress to create a Belgian monarchy and elect Leopold van Saksen-Coburg-Gotha, Leopold was quickly put into a carriage and brought to Belgium. The 21st then marks the day on which while on the Koningsplein in Brussels Leopold was sworn in as the first Belgian king, beginning our monarchy. This date was later proclaimed as the national holiday and is typically marked by widespread outpouring of patriotic tendencies. Therefore when the German army capitulated Belgium during the Weltkrieg, the holiday became strictly forbidden."

#Protest aggressive Further reaction
 flawa.2.t: "Geuzengroep Uncovered"
 flawa.2.d: "During a routine patrol by our Antwerp Harbour Defence Force, they uncovered a group of five men trying to infiltrate the Hansa Dock. Quick action by our troops meant they were able to capture the group, killing one man and disarming the rest. They carried small pistols designed for the Vlaamse Wacht and seemed to have intended the sabotage of the harbour trains, which would have disrupted vital shipping for the German Empire.\n\nUpon further investigation three of the four men have been discovered to be officers of the Deurne Police, thus invoking the question of whether we can trust our own police forces. The Ministry of Defence has responded forcefully to this implication, stating that only a full overhaul of the selection and training programme of the police can prevent further trouble. Others however believe this might be going too far. How should we respond to the situation?"
 flawa.2.a: "Slowly increase our safety checks."
 flawa.2.b: "Completely overhaul the training process."

 flawa.3.t: "Geuzengroep Suffers Losses"
 flawa.3.d: "Due to the recent increase in background checks and close internal investigation into our police forces, we have been able to capture more than three hundred members of the Geuzengroep, thus greatly disrupting their capacity to damage our regime. King Adelbert himself has personally awarded the commander of the Vlaamse Wacht with a medal, rewarding his loyalty and dedication to defeating the enemies of Flanders-Wallonia."
 flawa.3.a: "A great success for our repression policy!"

 flawa.4.t: "Strikes in Ghent"
 flawa.4.d: "After our heavy repression in February which involved dispersing protestors in the capital with brute force, many of the smaller actions throughout the country dissipated, fearing more bloodshed. However, to show the Government that they have not managed to completely extinguish the flame of resistance over thirty thousand farmers and workers from across Ghent province have entered the city and amassed in Kaiser Wilhelm square and the surrounding park.\n\nThe gathered assembly has been protesting heavily against the violent actions taken by the Flanders-Wallonia regime and the recent 'reforms' undertaken against the Flemish Council. The local Vlaamse Wacht is keeping a close eye on the protest to ensure that escalation like in Brussels is prevented."
 flawa.4.a: "They have the right to protest."
 flawa.4.b: "Disperse this mob with force!"

 flawa.5.t: "Mayday in the Sillon Industriel"
 flawa.5.d: "As the first of May approaches, the leftist underground movements are preparing for a large demonstration of their resolve and passion for the syndicalist cause. Throughout the entire Sillon Industriel, workers will down their tools in order to celebrate the syndicalist holiday. Just like last year the date will be accompanied with marches through the cities of Namur and Liège publicly chanting the Internationale and engaging in other activities forbidden by the Government.\n\nWhile we could the marches go ahead peacefully, showing those who have not yet joined the movement that we can be tolerant of dissent, our German commanders have expressed their desire to act with heavy force destroying much of the movement in one large sweep."
 flawa.5.a: "Only act when required."
 flawa.5.b: "Send in an armed detachment."

 flawa.6.t: "Bloodbath at Seraing"
 flawa.6.d: "During the breakup of yet another strike at Seraing, arguments between the Vlaamse Wacht and the strikers suddenly turned violent when a shot was fired at the commanding officer, killing him instantly. The Vlaamse Wacht immediately returned fire and after a hail of bullets and blood, fifty-three strikers lay dead on the ground.\n\nIt has become clear that our Vlaamse Wacht is not at all prepared for dealing with this kind of insurgency and that we will need a large scale overhaul of the training process. Hendrik Elias, head of the Wacht, has suggested that boosting their numbers would be more than enough to solve the problems and will even result in more successful raids against the insurgents."
 flawa.6.a: "Overhaul the training process."
 flawa.6.b: "Start enlisting more members into the corps."

 flawa.7.t: "Hendrik Elias Announces Ghent Mayoral Candidacy"
 flawa.7.d: "Our current head of the Vlaamse Wacht has announced his ambition to run for mayor in the industrial capital of East Flanders. While it is clear that he isn't exactly loved by the local population, some assistance from our side may guarantee a loyal mayor in the city."
 flawa.7.a: "Support his campaign."
 flawa.7.b: "Curtail his ambitions."

 flawa.8.t: "Elias Expands Ghent Garrison"
 flawa.8.d: "It appears that Hendrik Elias has reopened the Leopoldskazerne in Ghent and has founded a new training facility there to accommodate the new recruits. While this move, so close to the election, can almost certainly be seen as a sign of increasing instability in the city, Elias has assured us that it is merely a coincidence."
 flawa.8.a: "Well alright then."

 flawa.9.t: "Alfred Vander Stegen Wins the Ghent Elections"
 flawa.9.d: "In an unsurprising turn of events, Hendrik Elias has lost the race against the much more popular Alfred Vander Stegen, who has been congratulated by the sitting mayor for his victory. Stengen has announced his ambitions to usher in a new era of prosperity for the population of Ghent in these trying times. Hendrik Elias however has considered rejecting the results and is preparing to take action."
 flawa.9.a: "Congratulate Alfred Vander Stegen."
 flawa.9.b: "Hendrik Elias rejects the results!"

 flawa.10.t: "Elias Declares Himself Mayor!"
 flawa.10.d: "Assisted by the garrison stationed in the Leopoldskazerne, Elias has declared the elections void and proclaimed himself mayor. To keep the population in check, he has also announced a curfew from 8pm to 6am on the streets of Ghent until the situation has stabilised."
 flawa.10.a: "Well at least we now have a loyal mayor."

 flawa.11.t: "Denderleeuw Train Crash"
 flawa.11.d: "Due to an error at the Denderleeuw signal station, the IC train destined for Brussels Central has collided with the train heading for Bruges. The two trains, both completely full due to the morning commute, collided at full speed instantly killing both drivers and thirty four others. Dozens of citizens are even now still trapped in the wreckage, and the nation is in mourning. Parliament has already expressed its condolences alongside the families of the victims and the king is planning to give a speech on the radio later this afternoon. An investigation commission will be formed to identify the cause of this catastrophe and to prevent this from happening again."
 flawa.11.a: "Truly a tragedy!"

 flawa.12.t: "Terrorist Plot Discovered?"
 flawa.12.d: "The investigation behind the Denderleeuw train crash from last week has taken an interesting turn. During the interrogation of the signal operator, he confessed to have been warned an hour prior to the crash by a figure relative closely associated with the resistance in order to help create an 'accident'. Both men were immediately arrested and the Gendarmerie is investigating any links between the men and known resistance members."
 flawa.12.a: "Let the secret police take care of this."

 flawa.13.t: "More Intelligence on the Denderleeuw Crash"
 flawa.13.d: "New information has been discovered about the recent collision concerning the identities of some of the passengers. It appears that Hendrik Elias, head of the Vlaamse Wacht, was supposed to take this particular train for a routine inspection in Bruges. He was however unable to come and thus never boarded the train. Many feel like this attack was targeted against the Vlaamse Wacht for siding with the German regime. It might be wise to integrate them into our main police force in order to avoid further catastrophe."
 flawa.13.a: "Revoke some of the priviliges of the Vlaamse Wacht."
 flawa.13.b: "We should not interfere with their affairs."

 flawa.14.t: "Vlaamse Wacht Protests"
 flawa.14.d: "Ever since the occupation of Belgium in the Weltkrieg, the Vlaamse Wacht have been the beneficiaries of a special status separating them from the main police force. They initially helped pacify the country during the Weltkrieg by promising the Flemish population independence and more rights for the Dutch language. However, when it became clear after the conflict that Belgium would be turned into a puppet state of Germany, public opinion quickly turned against them.\n\nWith many of the original Vlaamse Wacht force feeling abandoned by their leaders, large groups of men have deserted the corps. The remaining hardcore loyalists have since embraced their higher status and established themselves as a form of secret police dedicated to preserving the regime's survival. As such, with the king deciding to strip them of their power, many have angrily risen up and marched on Brussels to demand their rights and privileges back. Many fear retaliation by the resistance movement and are afraid that without the king's protection they will be severely punished."
 flawa.14.a: "Our decision will stand."
 flawa.14.b: "Allow them to rejoin the Rijkswacht/Gendarmerie."

 flawa.15.t: "Retaliation Against the Vlaamse Wacht"
 flawa.15.d: "It appears that the Vlaamse Wacht's fear was justified as in under ten days more than a dozen former members were found dead, likely assassinated in revenge for their actions against the resistance. We will have to be careful as it seems the resistance has definitely not been quelled completely."
 flawa.15.a: "We will have to keep a close watch on the situation."

 flawa.16.t: "Vrij België"
 flawa.16.d: "During a small raid in Ghent by the Vlaamse Wacht, hundreds of newspapers under the name 'Vrij België', or Free Belgium, were found and taken into possession. Even though this raid may have slowed down the spread of the newspaper temporarily, the flame of revolution definitely still burns and action will have to be taken."
 flawa.16.a: "Nicely done."

 flawa.17.d: "Due to the abolition of our Flemish secret police force, it appears that the spread of illegal propaganda has increased. The Rebels may have the possibility now to further expand their movement and we will have to expend more of our own resources to suppress the movement."
 flawa.17.a: "More overtime for our police!"

 flawa.18.t: "Smuggling Operation Discovered in Ghent"
 flawa.18.d: "During a routine inspection by the police around Gent-Sint-Pieters station in Ghent, an unidentified train wagon was found containing military supplies. With all weapons and equipment stripped of any discernible markings, it has been difficult to identify their origin. Still, many inside the corps suspect they may originate from the Commune of France to our south. Other suspects include the Dutch who may be trying to reinstate their kingdom by liberating Flanders. We can't however make false accusations, and so we will have to choose which nation to confront over this issue."
 flawa.18.a: "This is clearly done by the Syndicalist rabble!"
 flawa.18.b: "Bring me the Dutch ambassador, he will have to explain this!"

 flawa.19.t: "Audience with the French Envoy"
 flawa.19.d: "The representative from the Commune has been called to the palace and after a short interrogation has denied all accusations. He warned us however that increasing our border forces could lead to unwanted escalations and advised us to drop the matter."
 flawa.19.a: "Who does this Frenchman think that he is?"

 flawa.20.t: "Audience with the Dutch Ambassador"
 flawa.20.d: "The Dutch ambassador has been called to the palace and even though a short interrogation did not give us the answers that we sought for, the ambassador has promised us that they will tighten their border security to make sure that no weapon shipments or other illegal goods are able to enter our country from their border."
 flawa.20.a: "Well alright then."

 flawa.21.t: "Breakthrough in the Investigation"
 flawa.21.d: "When investigating the military budget for last year, a lot of small unidentified expenses have been discovered. The purchase of a shipment of weapons from the German Empire, support equipment from Swiss and even an armoured convoy from the Netherlands. When verifying the destination of this equipment all signs point to the Leopoldskazerne in Ghent. This barracks has however not been used since 1933 when it was transformed into a hospital. It is as of yet unclear who authorised the purchases but the main suspects are low ranking members of the Flemish Council who may be aiding the rebels."
 flawa.21.a: "Continue the investigation."

 flawa.22.t: "The Investigation Comes Up Short"
 flawa.22.d: "After carefully following every lead, we have yet to get the results we hoped for. Some members of the Council have been interrogated and even though some may have connections with the resistance, there is no clear evidence. While we can continue to let the secret police carry on focussing on this issue, for the time being no culprit has been discovered."
 flawa.22.a: "Leave no stone unturned!"
 flawa.22.b: "Call this pointless investigation off."

 flawa.23.t: "Major Flemish Conspiracy Discovered"
 flawa.23.d: "The head of the task force aimed at uncovering the Flemish Conspiracy has returned with results. It seems that the shipments directed to the Leopoldskazerne originate from a high level circle within the Flemish Council. Frans van Cauwelaert has been identified as the head of this secretive body and has seemingly been responsible for much of the unrest and dissent arising in Flanders-Wallonia since the Weltkrieg. It appears that members of the Council have tried to shuffle funds into Resistance hands by ay of infiltrators in the Postal Service. They were also able to spread their propaganda by the same means and have been secretly organising rallies and meetings discussing the liberation of both Belgium and Flanders."
 flawa.23.a: "Firmly root out this weed!"

 flawa.24.t: "Van Cauwelaert On the Run"
 flawa.24.d: "With a warrant for his arrest signed by the king himself, police forces surrounded van Cauwelaert's home in Brussels seeking to capture him. He must have been warned in advance however, as all they found was an empty house and a smouldering fireplace. Police and Feldgendarmerie are organising a manhunt to quickly put an end to his treason and forces across the country are mobilising."
 flawa.24.a: "Find him quickly!"

 flawa.25.t: "Van Cauwelaert Caught!"
 flawa.25.d: "After only a few days police have finally caught up with van Cauwelaert as the treasonous figure sought to cross the French border near the village of Paradijs. With the capture of such a high level member of the resistance we may finally be able to strike a blow back."
 flawa.25.a: "So close to paradise, yet so far!"

 flawa.26.t: "Rise of Verdinaso"
 flawa.26.d: "Led by the charismatic Joris Van Severen, a faction has been growing in the Flemish Council striving for a greater Dietsland free from German interference. His influence is limited at the moment but it could prove wise to ban him from the Council to avoid further issues."
 flawa.26.a: "Ban Van Severen from the Council."
 flawa.26.b: "Befriend his party to secure their loyalty."

 flawa.27.t: "Creation of the Landwacht"
 flawa.27.d: "After his banishment from the Flemish Council, Van Severen has slowly been gathering support in the Flemish cities in the north. He has managed to create a cult of personality around himself with a strong focus on militarism. Inspired by the VNH in the Netherlands, they have now formed their own Landwacht who march in uniforms through the streets causing serious tensions with our own Vlaamse Wacht."
 flawa.27.a: "Arrest them all!"
 flawa.27.b: "They aren't doing us any harm."

 flawa.28.t: "May Day Clashes"
 flawa.28.d: "Large groups of socialists have been protesting in the streets of Antwerp against the recent lay-offs in the harbour. These leftists were met by a prepared group of the Landwacht who began clashing with them, before forces of the Vlaamse Wacht finally broke up the fight. The incident has proven that the group is becoming increasingly dangerous and that a quick resolution of the situation is vital for national stability. Hendrik Elias has offered to integrate them into the Vlaamse Wacht since they are clearly anti-syndicalist and could prove more loyal soldiers in violent dispersements of syndicalist strikers."
 flawa.28.a: "Persuade them to join the Vlaamse Wacht."
 flawa.28.b: "Disband the movement by force."

 flawa.29.t: "Flemish Coup"
 flawa.29.d: "Around lunchtime, when Adelbert was enjoying his meal in the royal palace, events suddenly kicked off. Sick of German tyranny, Flemish nationalists have slowly been expanding their influence as of late - and after recent measures by the king they have finally seen an opportunity to execute their plans.\n\nWith orders from Van Severen and other members of the Council, at around 12:47 PM members of the Vlaamse Wacht departed their Brussels barracks in lorries. A first detachment was deployed and rushed towards the federal Parliament which was in session. By quickly overwhelming the security guards the putschists were able to establish a fortified position in the building and hold many parliamentarians hostage.\n\nAnother detachment headed straight for the royal palace, and by ramming the front gate with a special lorry they managed to storm it. Overwhelming the royal guard, they were able to secure the building. With one swift and powerful strike, the Government has been completely paralysed."
 flawa.29.a: "Oh..."

 flawa.30.t: "Regime Forces React"
 flawa.30.d: "After the initial shock wore off, German and regime troops from the army barracks situated around the city mobilised and rushed towards the centre. Upon arrival they were met with fierce resistance from elements of the underground movement which saw an opportunity and helped execute the coup. With regime forces unable to reach the palace in time, Vlaamse Wacht quickly managed to breach the last line of defence and poured into the royal dining room. There they met Adelbert, still enjoying his soup and completely unaware of the situation.\n\nHendrik Elias, head of the Vlaamse Wacht has proposed an ultimatum to the king: that either he abdicates voluntarily as ruler of Flanders-Wallonia and stays as a hostage until arrangements with the German Empire have been made, or that alternatively he signs a decree ending his influence in Flemish-Walloon politics."
 flawa.30.a: "Abdicate."
 flawa.30.b: "Sign the bill."

 flawa.31.t: "The Flemish Council Takes Control"
 flawa.31.d: "With Adelbert deposed, Joris Van Severen has successfully taken control and declared himself leader of the country until stability has been restored. German citizens, fearing for their lives, are fleeing the country as quickly as they can, leaving much of their wealth behind. We have the opportunity now to right the wrongs of the Weltkrieg and all of the regime's excesses over the past twenty years, inflicting upon the occupiers and their lackeys a brutal humiliation. On the other hand, we could set our nation on a new course - to move beyond the injustices of the past."
 flawa.31.a: "Take revenge for the Rape of Belgium!"
 flawa.31.b: "We are decent men."

 flawa.32.t: "Change of Power"
 flawa.32.d: "With the Flemish Council firmly in control, many of the high ranking officials of the other parties fear that Van Severen is planning on instating a military government instead of letting formal elections go ahead. A grand coalition of the BWP, KB and LP is organising themselves in an effort to oppose Van Severen, and it has been claimed that they can call on the tacit support of a vengeful Germany."
 flawa.32.a: "The Grand Coalition deposes Van Severen."
 flawa.32.b: "Van Severen declares himself 'Leider'."

 flawa.33.t: "Landwacht Coup"
 flawa.33.d: "In an effort to make sure that their leader Van Severen remains in power, the Landwacht has launched a counter-coup against the democratic forces. Clashes between the two factions are erupting throughout the nation and the last remnants of order are breaking down."
 flawa.33.a: "The army moves in."

 flawa.34.t: "Deffontaine Takes Control of the Government"
 flawa.34.d: "In an effort to restore order to the nation, Deffontaine has seized control and ordered his troops to disperse the heavy fighting in the cities. He has promised that he will not remain in control for long and that he will transfer power back to the democratic government after the elections."
 flawa.34.a: "We shall schedule new elections within sixty days."

 flawa.35.t: "The Flemish Council Proclaims the Duchy of Flanders!"
 flawa.35.d: "In a last ditch effort to secure their power over the Flemish region before Adelbert finally disbands them, the Council taken the bold step of unanimously declaring Flanders independent from the union. Though they have the backing of the hard-line flamingants and some detachments of the Vlaamse Wacht, they could be fairly easily be crushed by the full might of the German Empire. We could however recognise their decision as legitimate and grant them self-governance in our union."
 flawa.35.a: "Crush the rebellion."
 flawa.35.b: "Recognise the Duchy of Flanders."

 flawa.36.t: "Flemish Rebellion Crushed"
 flawa.36.d: "The Flemish have suffered a crushing defeat but German High Command has decided that they should be rewarded with full independence. Luckily for us, we have the mighty power of the waffle to support us so we can still go ahead and simply re-absorb them."
 flawa.36.a: "Take that Flamouches!"

 flawa.37.t: "Flemish Council Takes Control"
 flawa.37.d: "With Adelbert's signature on the bill, he has been rendered constitutionally powerless and incapable of acting as little more than a figurehead for the nation. While the Flemish Council has now secured all but total control over the nation, they still have a long road ahead of them to convince the populace of their good intentions. A good step in that direction would be restoring free elections, allowing all parties to have a say in Parliament. However, fervent nationalists and Dietsland proponents in the Council are opposed to the idea, suggesting that this could lead to a rise in syndicalist popularity which would endanger their positions."
 flawa.37.a: "Elections shall go ahead."
 flawa.37.b: "The Council rules unopposed."

 flawa.38.t: "Elections for the Flemish-Walloon Parliament"
 flawa.38.d: "As decreed by the Council which has voluntarily stepped down, elections are to be held throughout the nation. While the restrictions imposed by Adelbert have been severely loosened, German observers are still keeping a keen eye on their puppet and will intervene if necessary."
 flawa.38.a: "BWP gains a majority."
 flawa.38.b: "KP delivers the PM."
 flawa.38.c: "LP achieves the most seats."

 flawa.39.t: "Socialists Achieve Electoral Victory in Flanders-Wallonia"
 flawa.39.d: "After the Flemish Council reduced the power of Wilhelm's son Adelbert in the Government, the socialist BWP party has won the snap election and gained control of the state. While it is unclear yet if they are planning to 'reform' the state into a syndicalist bastion like in the neighbouring Commune of France, or just to pass progressive legislation, we have the possibilty to pre-emptively intervene and restore Adelbert to power using our forces stationed in the country."
 flawa.39.a: "The Reich cannot endure another den of leftists!"
 flawa.39.b: "We shall not intervene directly..."

 flawa.40.t: "German Intervention"
 flawa.40.d: "In an effort to quell the rise of syndicalist elements in the BWP, the German army has stepped in and restored Adelbert to power. Garrisons across the nation have been bolstered with extra reinforcements and a curfew has been instated in the Flemish cities and the Sillon Industriel to prevent any escalation."
 flawa.40.a: "Adelbert rules supreme."

#Peaceful Belgian Transistion
 flawa.41.t: "Protests in Ghent and Antwerpen"
 flawa.41.d: "Protesting against the dissolution of the Landwacht and the complete eradication of Verdinaso, hundreds have flocked to the streets to raise their voices against the king's decision. While the protests seem nothing more than yet another peaceful attempt at forcing the departure of Adelbert, strong intervention may be necessary to show the rabble who is really in control here."
 flawa.41.a: "Let them protest."
 flawa.41.b: "Send in the cavalry."

 flawa.42.t: "Nationalist Rally in Brussel"
 flawa.42.d: "Under the guise of a peaceful demonstration in favour of relief efforts for West-Flemish farmers, thousands have come down to the Warande. What started off as a simple protest for farmers quickly escalated into a full on nationalist rally with Belgian flags being waved around and chants of the Brabançonne performed throughout the park. Police forces quickly encircled the park to quell the revolutionaries but are awaiting further command before intervening."
 flawa.42.a: "They have the right to protest."
 flawa.42.b: "Nothing the Feldgendarmerie can't solve!"

 flawa.43.t: "Referendum For the Reinstatement of the Kingdom of Belgium"
 flawa.43.d: "Organised by the resistance and members of all the major parties, a referendum calling for the independence of Belgium has been prepared in secret after repeated protests and rallies had no influence on the king. While they don't believe that their action will successfully convince the German government to grant Belgium its independence, they hope to convince foreign powers to intervene on their behalf. Syndicalists, both in the Commune of France and the Belgian resistance, anxiously await the inevitable German response as a denial of the referendum is likely to strengthen their position in the divided nation."
 flawa.43.a: "Let the referendum go ahead."
 flawa.43.b: "Arrest all involved in its organisation."

 flawa.44.t: "The Belgians Demand Independence"
 flawa.44.d: "It appears that tensions in neighbouring Flanders-Wallonia have finally come to a head. Our puppet regime in the country has failed to properly stamp down on dissent against our rule, and now an unofficial referendum organised by the Belgian resistance, all major political parties and other opposition figures has emboldened its population, turning them against our rule. They are now openly calling for us to grant them independence, most likely hoping that international pressure will force us to accede to their request. Though we could obviously refuse this audacious demand, doing so could embolden Syndicalist elements of the resistance and push the nation towards the Communards."
 flawa.44.a: "Let Belgium have its independence."
 flawa.44.b: "The fools forget their place!"

 flawa.45.t: "The Commune of Belgium Declares Independence"
 flawa.45.d: "Fuelled by revanchism against the German occupiers and the continued oppression by Adelbert and his regime, syndicalists in our nation have finally seized their chance and declared the nation of Belgium part of the Internationale and announced their support for the Communards in the war against the German Empire."
 flawa.45.a: "The Fires of Revolution burn throughout the nation."

#Adelbert starts reforming
 flawa.50.t: "Corruption in the Generale Bank"
 flawa.50.d: "After the Generale Bank was split off from the Societe Generale de la Belgique after the Black Monday crash last year, Flemish Council representatives were placed into high ranking postions within the organisation. This morning however, the De Standaard newspaper published a front page article detailing high ranking corruption within the institution. A number of major Catholic members and German industrialists are mentioned by name, while Paul Van Zeeland, the head of the Catholic Party, has been publicly accused of being responsible for the corruption infesting the organisation..."
 flawa.50.a: "Call a special hearing in Parliament!"

 flawa.51.t: "Paul Van Zeeland Speaks to Parliament"
 flawa.51.d: "Upon Van Zeeland's entry into Parliament, unrest amongst the ranks erupted openly with many calling for his immediate resignation and the resignation of the Catholic-led government. Van Zeeland however has labelled the rumours mere Socialist propaganda aimed at damaging his reputation with no other purpose than to blackmail him and discredit the party."
 flawa.51.a: "Search his home and office."

 flawa.52.t: "Feldgendarmerie Storms Generale Bank Headquarters"
 flawa.52.d: "With a search warrant signed directly by Adelbert I himself, a strike force of the Feldgendarmerie has been ordered to storm the Generale Bank in a dawn raid and secure all documents and key personnel for the investigation. While the Gendarmerie successfully confiscated hundreds of documents, the Bank's ovens were conveniently putting in overtime in an effort to try and destroy as much evidence as possible. By the evening ten large trucks drove out of the building transporting all evidence to the palace."
 flawa.52.a: "Appoint an investigation commission."

 flawa.53.t: "Sap Speaks Out Against Louis Franck"
 flawa.53.d: "With full chaos engulfing the Catholic Party, whose members are desperately trying to close ranks and shun all members implicated in the scandal, Gustave Sap has openly called out Louis Franck, head of the Generale Bank, for his participation in the corruption. As he painfully details all his mistakes with what some call insider knowledge, Franck's reputation was completely devastated causing him to walk out in the middle of Sap's humiliating speech."
 flawa.53.a: "The house of cards is falling down."

 flawa.54.t: "Van Acker Frames the Catholic Party for the Black Monday Scandal"
 flawa.54.d: "In the socialist paper Vooruit!, Achille Van Acker has joined Sap's commitment to bringing down Louis Franck and Van Zeeland. While Van Acker has lambasted Van Zeeland for his failures in the Black Monday crisis, he has called Franck a despicable lapdog of the German aristocracy driven sorely by profit and responsible for the oppression of Flemish workers."
 flawa.54.a: "Franck's reputation is completely ruined!"

 flawa.55.t: "Louis Franck Commits Suicide"
 flawa.55.d: "Increasing pressure from all sides and the German investigation into his tenure as director of the Generale Bank have taken their toll on Louis Franck who committed suicide yesterday evening. He was found next to his service weapon from the Weltkrieg and dressed in full uniform, with a note on his nightstand detailing the roles of all persons implicated in the scandal. With this last act, he hopes to have done the right thing for his fatherland and that his relatives will be spared from his shame. Already the Feldgendarmerie have been deployed en-masse to imprison the many wretches Franck has implicated."
 flawa.55.a: "With this last act, he has regained some measure of honour."

 flawa.56.t: "Adelbert Accuses the Council"
 flawa.56.d: "With the arrests of any prominent members of the Flemish Council, Adelbert has pointed out the widespread corruption and treachery of the body and its danger to the goal of securing a safe and free Flanders-Wallonia. Police forces and the Investigation Committee are following the crisis closely, trying to root out the deeply embedded malfeasance we have now discovered lying beneath the surface of many national institutions."
 flawa.56.a: "The Council is clearly outliving its usefulness..."

 flawa.57.t: "Creation of the Rijkswacht"
 flawa.57.d: "With the Feldgendarmerie pleading loyalty to Adelbert himself and the Vlaamse Wacht under Council administration, the Government has voted for the creation of the Rijkswacht to fulfil the roles of the Vlaamse Wacht and to secure a more apolitical police force."
 flawa.57.a: "Another the blow to the Council."

 flawa.59.t: "Cooperative Vooruit Presses for BWP membership"
 flawa.59.d: "While the first elections since the Weltkrieg have been planned for 1938 due to Adelbert's recent reforms, the BWP or Belgian Workers Party is still forbidden from partaking due to the fear of socialism spreading amongst the common man. To protest this decision, Van Acker and the cooperatives are pressing their members to go on the streets and protest against this injustice. They also have been calling for all citizens to vote 'none of the above' if the elections do move ahead without them."
 flawa.59.a: "The BWP has fed greedily off Black Monday's embers."

 flawa.60.t: "French Agitators Captured in Charleroi"
 flawa.60.d: "After a strike in the Charleroi industrial region, multiple French citizens were picked out of the Walloon crowd and identified as Communard syndicalists. While the workers are outright refusing to cooperate with the authorities, their very presence only reaffirms our fear of syndicalism spreading throughout the Sillon."
 flawa.60.a: "Arrange an audience with Van Acker."

 flawa.61.t: "Royal Audience with Van Acker"
 flawa.61.d: "Due to the Charleroi strikes and the subsequent arrests of multiple French syndicalist agitators, Adelbert has decided to tackle the problem headfirst and has arranged a meeting with the leader of the BWP, Achille Van Acker. While the king is reluctant to allow the BWP participation in the upcoming elections, Van Acker has promised him that only through a strong, centralised social democrat leadership Flanders-Wallonia can be saved from falling to extremism."
 flawa.61.a: "Only through cooperation can we secure stability."
 flawa.61.b: "All Socialists are traitors to the king!"

 flawa.62.t: "1938 Elections in Flanders-Wallonia"
 flawa.62.d: "For the first time since the start of the German occupation of Belgium during the Weltkrieg the German regime as allowed for elections to be held in their puppet state. While all parties have decided to run independently, utterly convinced of their own superiority, it looks like the KP is set for a crushing victory."
 flawa.62.a: "The BWP achieves a sweeping victory."
 flawa.62.b: "The KP achieves an absolute majority."

#Prelude to Revolution
 bel.225.t: "Strikes at the Zolder Mines"
 bel.225.d: "Miners and workers in the nearby industrial zone have laid down their equipment to protest against the inhumane conditions they are regularly being exposed to. To fulfil the quotas imposed by the regional industrial head, many of the workers have been forced to work seven days a week, some for over twelve hours a day, or risk losing their jobs. The cooperative of Zolder has decided to take action and has prepared a large strike to fight against their conditions and has sworn to uphold the strike until their terms are met."
 bel.225.a: "Send in the Vlaamse Wacht."
 bel.225.b: "Make some empty promises about helping the Cooperative."

 bel.226.t: "Anniversary of the Antwerp Killings"
 bel.226.d: "On the 22nd of January 1935 the country was devastated by the killing of Albert Pot en Theofiel Grijp, two prominent members of the Antwerp union, by affiliates of a German shipping company. This resulted in a nation wide strike organised by the BWP, the local Cooperatives and the Unions to force the Government into signing a law ensuring better working conditions and the introduction of the forty-hour work week.\n\nThe government however decided to fight back against the strike with force leading to six casualties in the Ghent harbour and the imprisonment of over three hundred union members in the following weeks. Ultimately the strike was lifted as organising members were locked up or threatened into submission.\n\nToday the cooperative of Ghent has requested that the mayor of the city allow them to organise a small ceremony in Sint-Baafs Cathedral commemorating the sacrifices of their members."
 bel.226.a: "It's better to forget such a black stain on our reign."
 bel.226.b: "Send a representative to express our condolences."

#Linguistic Troubles resolvement
 belind.1.t: "The First Talentelling"
 belind.1.d: "Even though Belgian independence has once again been secured, linguistic issues dominate the political landscape. To make matters worse, due to the German push for integration, none of our demographic statistics remain valid. Therefore the Government has proposed a full census of the population to determine which villages and cities speak which language. With the results of this 'Talentelling' Brussels hopes to determine the exact location of the language border and solve the linguistic debacle."
 belind.1.a: "Start the count."

 belind.2.t: "Results of the Talentelling"
 belind.2.d: "After weeks of counting, the commission responsible for the Talentelling has finalised their report and sent it to Parliament. The results are far from shocking with huge majorities of French being spoken in Wallonia and Dutch in Flanders respectively. The largest anomalies are the French speaking, Flemish town of Moeskroen and the Brussels capital region. Due to the influence of the German puppet government and the dominance of the Flemish Council, the city of Brussels has almost completely stopped its Frenchification and has experienced the creation of a large German minority. To solve the issues created by German interference and the pre-existing tensions, the Government is considering the creation of a so-called Language Commission which would be tasked with solving the crisis."
 belind.2.a: "Create the Language Commission."
 belind.2.b: "Belgium has more important issues!"

 belind.3.t: "Status of the German Minority"
 belind.3.d: "German influence in Flanders-Wallonia and the integration plans of Adelbert have dramatically increased the number of German speakers, who have become too large a minority to ignore. On the eastern side of Liège and the city of Brussels especially their influence is extremely tangible and the regions are currently undergoing protests, leading to serious tensions with the Flemish and Walloon populace. The German minority request that German is recognised as an official language and that the German community is granted their own measure of autonomous government. If we give in to their requests, this could lead to tensions in Flanders where separatism is still standing strong."
 belind.3.a: "Ignore the German plea."
 belind.3.b: "Look into creating Language Communities."

 belind.4.t: "Defining the Language Border"
 belind.4.d: "Currently our language border is just an abstraction and does not have any importance. Due to the mixed populations on the border though, many feel left behind due to the monolingual facilities. In a Walloon town in Henegouwen bordering East-Flanders, all forms of law and government are solely in French which proves problematic for the Flemish minority living in the same town. Therefore, a system where Flemish citizens can request to have their official correspondence and facilities in Flemish has been proposed. While overhauling the language border would be a costly affair, it would greatly help our citizens living on the border."
 belind.4.a: "Hold on to the monolingual system."
 belind.4.b: "Create bilingual facilities for those affected."

 belind.5.t: "Adaption of the Provincial Borders"
 belind.5.d: "As indicated by the Talentelling, many towns on the language border are currently placed in the wrong province. Towns like Komen and Orroir have a French majority of over 80% but are located in Flemish provinces. To complete the transfer of these communities, consent will have to be given from the Federal government in Brussels."
 belind.5.a: "Transfer the towns."

 belind.6.t: "March on Brussels"
 belind.6.d: "In protest against the recent transfer of villages, large groups of Flemish speaking citizens have come down to the capital protesting against what they see as state encroachment on the Flemish language. They argue that while Flemish citizens who migrate to Wallonia adapt themselves to the French language, Walloons insist on speaking the French language. This leads to rising Walloon minorities in the Flemish region of the language border, pushing the border north. The demands of the Flemish movement are clear: no further Talentellings, complete abolishment of the facility communities around Brussels, Flemification of industry and the creation of a separate Flemish government."
 belind.6.a: "Make small concessions to calm the protestors."
 belind.6.b: "Give in to their demands."

 belind.7.t: "Second March on Brussels"
 belind.7.d: "Discontented with the passive reaction from the Government, the Flemish movement has organised a second March on Brussels. Even though most of the established parties were against such a radical provocation against Brussels, the Flemish nationalists have insisted on the protest further cementing their popularity. With counter protests from the Francophone movement as well, it looks like Brussels will have no choice but to move forward with decentralisation efforts."
 belind.7.a: "Start the Government reform."

 belind.8.t: "Split of the Communities"
 belind.8.d: "Pressured by movements from all three language groups, Brussels has gone ahead with the Community programme. Three separate autonomous governments will be created: a Flemish government, a French government and a German government who will each have the power to decide matters of education and culture within their jurisdiction. Brussels will be jointly controlled by all three of these governments, each serving the speakers of the language they represent. Included with the proposal is the Community 'alarm' procedure, a legislative process ensuring that no single Community can enact a reform which would damage other Communities. While this move has seriously fractured the power of the federal government and strengthened the Flemish nationalists, it seems that the majority of the population is content with the new reform and is looking forward to the first Community elections."
 belind.8.a: "The first state reform is a fact."

 belind.9.t: "Split of Brabant"
 belind.9.d: "As the only Belgian province where both Walloons and Flemish live together split along the language border, the Government has proposed cutting the province in two along this border to simplify the work of the Language Communities. Walloon-Brabant would be governed from the city of Wavre, while Flemish-Brabant would be administered from Leuven. The city of Brussels, while being located in the middle of the province, would become its own entity and be wholly a part of the Brussels Region."
 belind.9.a: "Split Brabant."
 belind.9.b: "Keep Brabant intact."

 belind.10.t: "Split of the Regions"
 belind.10.d: "Due to the declining importance of Walloon industry, increasing pleas from Walloon industrialists backed by their German counterparts have been received by the federal government. They request that just like the cultural split into Communities, another split be made based on economic regions. The creation of the Regions, which would consist of Flanders, Wallonia and the Brussels Capital Region would once again bring the decision making process closer to the people. The cost for sustaining such a large bureaucratic state with seven different governments would be enormous and further consideration of this proposal may be in order."
 belind.10.a: "Refuse their requests."
 belind.10.b: "Delegate the responsibilities to the Communities."

 belind.11.t: "Protest in Liège"
 belind.11.d: "While the Flemish Community has agreed with the Federal Government and accepted their request to unify the Flemish Region and the Flemish Community, the French Community has refused these demands and has found support from the Walloon population in doing so. They insist that cultural and economic tasks need to stay separated and that they cannot help the French-speaking citizens of Brussels without this split. It may be worth it for us to consider their opinion to retain control over Wallonia but the increased cost of sustaining both these government organs should be considered as well."
 belind.11.a: "Force the Walloon Region and French Community to combine."
 belind.11.b: "Preserve both separate governments."

 belind.16.t: "Friction in the NMBS"
 belind.16.d: "Uproar was caused today when a Flemish nationalist got into a fight with train personnel in Brussels. The man refused to answer the French speaking conductor unless he spoke Flemish, saying that in Belgium all people have to speak both languages and not just the Flemish. This is yet another incident in the rising tensions between Flemish and Walloons."
 belind.16.a: "Investigate the issues."
 belind.16.b: "Ignore the matter."

 belind.17.t: "Strikes in Antwerp"
 belind.17.d: "Due to protest instigated by last week's scandal, Antwerpen-Centraal has been blocked off by Flemish strikers. They demand an obligatory language examination for all Walloon personnel willing to work in Flanders. No reaction has been given by the NMBS leadership, as the state company awaits a reaction from the federal government."
 belind.17.a: "Push for a bilingual examination."
 belind.17.b: "Let the NMBS handle this on their own."

 belind.18.t: "Clashes in Brussel"
 belind.18.d: "Another clash between Flemish protestors and the Rijkswacht has occurred in Brussels today when a large protest against the economic policy of Belgium came into contact with the Brussels police forces. Multiple protestors were beaten up by the police and even though no fatalities were reported, the Volksunie is out for blood."
 belind.18.a: "A sad day for all Belgians."

 belind.19.t: "The Volksunie Speaks Out Against the Economic Policy"
 belind.19.d: "Due to the collapse of large parts of Walloon industry and increasingly commercial focus on Flanders, it has become clear to many that Wallonia has become the lesser partner in the union. To remedy this, the federal government has authorised large transfers of subsidy and investments into the Sillon Industriel to help the Walloons recover. The Volksunie is now proclaiming that if they win the elections, these transfers will be completely cut and fully used to aid Flanders. This has caused heavy outrage from the BWP who has accused the Volksunie of being asocial and detrimental to Belgian stability."
 belind.19.a: "The Volksunie is becoming a threat."

#No Communities
 belind.12.t: "Unrest in the Flemish Ardennes"
 belind.12.d: "In Ronse-Renaix, large protests have been organised by the Flemish Movement against the increasingly French speaking population. They fear that if Brussels does not intervene in the Language Crisis, the Flemish language will be pushed further north due to the migration and refusal to adapt of the Walloon populace. They argue that further consolidating of the educational department and equal enforcement of both languages on a national level should be top priorities for the Government if they wish to solve this crisis."
 belind.12.a: "Overhaul the educational system."
 belind.12.b: "Ignore Flemish protests."

 belind.13.t: "The Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde Dossier"
 belind.13.d: "Ever since the independence of Belgium, the province of Brabant has formed the centre of our nation consisting of the Walloon majorities in the south, the Flemish majorities in the north and the divided region of Brussels in the middle of it all. Due to the Government's stubbornness in keeping the province intact and the old electoral districts, protest in the region is mounting, urging Brussels to at least split up the province or adapt the Brussel-Halle-Vilvoorde region to the present situation."
 belind.13.a: "Split Brabant."
 belind.13.b: "Keep Brabant intact."

 belind.14.t: "Elections in Belgium"
 belind.14.d: "Tensions are high in the wake of the language protests throughout the nation with both Walloon and Flemish nationalists proving very popular. Public opinion is turning against the sitting government due to their stubborn and conservative stance on state reform which might cost them the election."
 belind.14.a: "The Flemish nationalist Volksunie wins."
 belind.14.b: "The BWP takes the most seats."
 belind.14.c: "The KP/DC achieves victory."
 belind.14.e: "The LP clinches it."
 belind.14.f: "The liberal wing of the BWP gains prominence."

 belind.15.t: "Volksunie Announces its Victory"
 belind.15.d: "Bolstered by the discontent of citizens residing on the language border and attracting voters from the much more radical Verdinaso and VNV, the Volksunie has won the election by a close margin. They claim they seek to act on their election promises and reform Belgium into a confederacy where the Flemish and Walloon governments are freed from the restrictions of Brussels and can act on their own as they see fit."
 belind.15.a: "This will be a long and hard process."

 belind.30.t: "Collapse of the [ROOT.GetFactionName]"
 belind.30.desc: "A grave disaster has befallen the Dutch people; socialist elements have risen up to overthrow both the government and the country's monarchy. While the Dutch Queen and her family are safe, and have managed to flee the country, the news continues to get worse. The radicals who have seized control of the nation have declared their commitment to the revolutionary cause, abandoning any notions of neutrality.\n\nUnsurprisingly this news has meant the dissolution of the [ROOT.GetFactionName] alliance, and has left the nation trapped between hostile powers with no allies to turn to. With fears abound of potential invasion and the horror of a possibly partition of [BEL.GetName] that may follow, much of the government has slowly begun to accept that the only real option left on the table is a return to the German sphere. While [BEL.GetName] will at least be on more equal footing with the Germans compared to before, the idea of rejoining them is certainly one few have wished for."
 belind.30.a: "Swallow our pride and ask Germany for protection."
 belind.30.b: "The Belgian Lion will stand alone, Germans be damned."

 belind.31.t: "Collapse of the BeNeSam"
 belind.31.desc: "A grave disaster has befallen the Dutch people; socialist elements have risen up to overthrow both the government and the country's monarchy. While the Dutch Queen and her family are safe, and have managed to flee the country, the news continues to get worse. The radicals who have seized control of the nation have declared their commitment to the revolutionary cause, abandoning any notions of neutrality.\n\nUnsurprisingly this news has meant the dissolution of the [ROOT.GetFactionName] alliance, and has left [BEL.GetName] trapped between hostile powers with no allies to turn to. With fears abound of potential invasion and the horror of a possibly partition of [BEL.GetName] that may follow, it is expected that [BEL.GetName] will seek outside protection, no matter the cost."
 belind.31.a: "This is not good."

 belind.32.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Requests Protection"
 belind.32.desc: "With the fires of the Dutch revolution quickly burning the country's metaphorical bridges, it has also burnt up the nation's cooperation treaty with [BEL.GetName]. Having banded together in an attempt to maintain neutrality after [BEL.GetName] broke away from the Reichspakt, it seems that the [BEL.GetAdjective]s have once again learned the failings of neutrality.\n\nIn an attempt to save themselves from being torn apart by their socialist neighbours, they have sent delegates to [GER.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] to hopefully negotiate [BEL.GetName]'s entry into the Reichspakt as an independent member. Their reentry would of course allow troops to be once more deployed to their nation and provide a significant strategic advantage against the Internationale, however their prior anti-German stances have left many simply wishing to allow them to succumb to their fate.\n\nIf however their offer is refused, it is impossible to know what measures their desperation will lead them to. With no other options left on the table, they may even do the unthinkable and seek alignment with [INT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] instead. It is therefore vital that the potential consequences are thought through before any decision is made on the matter."
 belind.32.a: "The prodigal son returns, eh?"
 belind.32.b: "They made their choice - now they can live with it."

 belind.33.t: "[ROOT.GetNameDefCap] Rejoins the [FROM.GetFactionName]"
 belind.33.desc: "Wonderful news has been received from the representatives sent to [GER.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], the Germans have agreed to allow [BEL.GetAdjective] reentry into the Reichspakt. With the full protection of Germany's armies against the socialist menace, the people of the nation may sleep soundly once more."
 belind.33.a: "Who knew that the underside of a boot would be so safe?"

 belind.34.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Refuses Protection"
 belind.34.desc: "It appears that the team of representatives sent to [GER.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] having returned home emptyhanded. Seemingly as punishment for the previous transgressions against them, the Germans have decided to abandon [BEL.GetName] to its fate.\n\nWhile it may seem unthinkable, the idea of approaching [INT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] and negotiating protection has slowly gained more and more support within recent days. This would almost certainly mean the instillation of a government aligned with [INT.GetAdjective] interests, but in truly desperate times like these anything that ensures the nation's survival may be worth the cost."
 belind.34.a: "We have no choice - open negotiations with [INT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]."
 belind.34.b: "We will protect ourselves - on our own, if we must."

 belind.35.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Requests [ROOT.GetFactionName] Membership"
 belind.35.desc: "While diplomacy is rarely straightforward, the request received today from [BEL.GetNameDef] is especially unusual. With the fantastic success of the Dutch Revolution leading to the diplomatic isolation of [BEL.GetName], they initially tried to grovel with the [GER.GetAdjective] in hopes of protection against the inevitable tide of socialism. For whatever reason, almost certainly spite, the Germans refused to allow [BEL.GetAdjective] reentry into the Reichspakt and have instead abandoned them to their fate.\n\nNow with nowhere else to turn to, the desperate [BEL.GetAdjective]s have even requested entry into the [ROOT.GetFactionName] in hopes of preserving their independence. Quite obviously any [BEL.GetAdjective] membership will mandate the removal of their existing government and the installation of a government that will truly serve its people, which they will almost certainly be aware of. Whether the [BEL.GetAdjective]s deserve to be allowed the privilege of joining the [ROOT.GetFactionName] is however a question that must be considered, and a decision must be made on how to reply to this request."
 belind.35.a: "Gladly, but they must install a syndicalist government."
 belind.35.b: "Absolutely not."

 belind.36.t: "The [FROM.GetFactionName] Presents Membership Terms"
 belind.36.desc: "Unlike the failed negotiations with [GER.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], good news has been received from the negotiations with [INT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] and they have agreed to [BEL.GetAdjective] membership of the [FROM.GetFactionName]. Unfortunate as feared, this good news has been accompanied by the demand for the instillation of a socialist government aligned with [INT.GetAdjective] interests. While this was always the most likely outcome, it is finally time to face the difficult choice on if it should be accepted."
 belind.36.a: "If we must..."
 belind.36.b: "Absolutely not!"

 belind.37.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Refuses Terms"
 belind.37.desc: "A reply has been received from the [BEL.GetAdjective]s, a resounding \"No\" regarding the installation of a socialist government. While they almost certainly knew that these demands would be made before they sent their original offer, it seems that they were unable to face reality when finally presented with it."
 belind.37.a: "Hardly a surprise for reactionaries."

 belind.38.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Refuses Protection"
 belind.38.desc: "It seems that like with [GER.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], the attempts to negotiate with [INT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] have also ended in complete failure. Even with the potential promise of the installation of a socialist government, it seems that the [INT.GetAdjective] cannot be swayed. [BEL.GetName] must face the world alone, even if it may not face it for much longer."
 belind.38.a: "Does no one in this continent like us!?"

 belind.50.t: "An Alliance with the [GER.GetFactionName]?"
 belind.50.d: "With the war against the Communards, there have been calls to integrate ourselves into the German military alliance to better protect ourselves, at least until the war ends. What should we do?"
 belind.50.a: "The enemy of my enemy is my friend."
 belind.50.b: "We don't need them."

 belind.51.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Asks for a Temporary Alliance"
 belind.51.d: "Today we have received a call from the [FROM.GetAdjective] ambassador to create a temporary military alliance between our nations to better defend Western Europe from Communard incursion. What should we say?"
 belind.51.a: "Absolutely."
 belind.51.b: "We don't need them."

 belind.52.t: "[FROM.GetNameCap] Refuses Alliance"
 belind.52.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] ambassador has responded to our offer of an alliance with a flat rejection. For whatever reason, it seems [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] has no desire to protect us... even if that means leaving themselves vulnerable to the Communards."
 belind.52.a: "They will bitterly regret this if the Rhine Line ever falls."

 belind.53.t: "The BeNeSam Reforms"
 belind.53.d: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] has decided to reform the BeNeSam alliance, now that the war is done, and has called on [Root.GetNameDef] to take their place at their side once again."
 belind.53.d.rp: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] has decided to reform the BeNeSam alliance, now that the war is done, and has called on [FROM.GetNameDef] to take their place at their side once again. If we refuse, staying in the Reichspakt will not be an option - at least not for now. We will be on our own."
 belind.53.a: "Of course!"
 belind.53.b: "We'd rather not..."

 belind.54.t: "The BeNeSam Reforms"
 belind.54.d: "With the war now over, [FROM.GetNameDef] has elected to return to its former position as the head of the BeNeSam alliance."
 belind.54.a: "We thank them for their assistance!"

 bel.500.t: "The Blue Lotus"
 bel.500.d: "The newest comic of Georges Rémi, or Hergé, takes place in the Qing Empire where the reporter Tintin is sent to dismantle drug trafficking. It is known that Hergé was helped in his work by a young student from the legation city of Shanghai named Zhang Chongren who came to [BEL.GetName] to study fine arts. The expertise of Zhang led to a striking and realistic representation of Chinese society and contributed greatly to the enormous success of the book in both Europe and China. The book criticises the weakness and the corruption of the Qing government as well as the Japanese presence in Manchuria and is as such, banned in both of these countries."
 bel.500.a: "So exciting!"
