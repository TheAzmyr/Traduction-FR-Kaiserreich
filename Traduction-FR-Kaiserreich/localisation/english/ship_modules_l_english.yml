 ship_armor_bc_3: "330mm Belt/130mm Deck"
 ship_armor_bc_3_short: "Battlecruiser Armour III"
 ship_armor_bc_3_desc: "Designed with an eye towards weight limitations, this armour scheme attempts to maximise protection for the vital parts of a ship by leaving other areas exposed. This scheme is not supposed to stand up to battleship-grade weaponry for long."
 ship_armor_shbb: "450mm Belt/210mm Deck"
 ship_armor_shbb_short: "Super-Heavy Armour"
 ship_armor_shbb_desc: "The last word in armour design, this armour scheme is intended to defeat all known main battery projectiles, allowing a ship so equipped to engage and sink any other battleship in the world today."
 ship_armor_cruiser_1: "50mm Belt/40mm Deck"
 ship_armor_cruiser_1_short: "Cruiser Armour I"
 ship_armor_cruiser_1_desc: "An armour scheme intended to give a cruiser a slight edge when fighting against destroyers and other lightly-armed ships."
 ship_armor_cruiser_2: "100mm Belt/50mm Deck"
 ship_armor_cruiser_2_short: "Cruiser Armour II"
 ship_armor_cruiser_2_desc: "A heavier belt intended to allow a cruiser to engage older light cruisers and smaller ships with a good deal of protection."
 ship_armor_cruiser_3: "120mm Belt/65mm Deck"
 ship_armor_cruiser_3_short: "Cruiser Armour III"
 ship_armor_cruiser_3_desc: "Copying methods used for armouring battleships, this armour scheme is designed to keep pace with developments in armaments around the world."
 ship_armor_cruiser_4: "150mm Belt/60mm Deck"
 ship_armor_cruiser_4_short: "Cruiser Armour IV"
 ship_armor_cruiser_4_desc: "This armour scheme attempts to maximise protection over the areas absolutely needed to keep a ship afloat and in the fight, at the cost of all other areas."
 ship_armor_carrier_deck: "90mm Deck"
 ship_armor_carrier_deck_short: "Flight Deck Armour"
 ship_armor_carrier_deck_desc: "Heavy armour plates protect the hangar spaces against hits by enemy bombers at the cost of less working space."
 ship_armor_ice_carrier_deck_1: "Pykrete Runway Reinforcements"
 ship_armor_ice_carrier_deck_1_desc: "Additional construction reinforcements, ensuring stronger and more resilient construction, while also providing better resistance against the elements."
 ship_armor_ice_carrier_deck_2: "Steel-Reinforced Pykrete Runway"
 ship_armor_ice_carrier_deck_2_desc: "Steel-Reinforced Pykrete provides sturdier construction, capable of withstanding more damage, while offering better insulation."
 ship_armor_ice_carrier_deck_3: "Ice-Composite Runway"
 ship_armor_ice_carrier_deck_3_desc: "Materials and methods used offer the best structure resillience and reducing the impact of weather on the ship operations."
 SHIP_DESIGNER_MODULE_SELECTION: "§HModule Slot:§! $NAME$\nSelect a Module:"
 ship_light_battery_sub: "200mm Battery"
 ship_light_battery_sub_desc: "A formidable deck gun of a calibre more commonly found on light cruisers."
 EQ_MOD_CAT_ship_light_battery_sub_TITLE: "Deck Guns"
 cruiser_submarine_specialization: "Long Range Hunters"
 cruiser_submarine_specialization_desc: "Cruiser Submarines represent the pinnacle of heavy sub-surface raiding. What they lack in manoeuvrability and stealth, they certainly make up for in reach."
 midget_submarine_specialization: "Midget Submarine Pioneers"
 midget_submarine_specialization_desc: "Small submarines designed for harbor raiding or light convoy raiding suit our naval doctrine perfectly."
