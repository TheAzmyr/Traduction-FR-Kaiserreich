 CHN_autonomous_region_modifier: "Autonomous Region"
 CHN_autonomous_region_modifier_desc: "The Qing dynasty's hold over its borderlands was a complicated affair, with ebbing and flowing degrees of control. These territories to the north and west, referred to as \"Feudatory Regions\" by the Chinese and \"Chinese Tartary\" by Western observers, consisted of a patchwork of tribes, clans, and frontier military garrisons swearing allegiance to the Emperor. As Chinese nationalism evolved and the Xinhai Revolution was underway, the question of how to treat ethnic minorities was a pervasive question for post-revolutionary Chinese identity, further complicated by attempts from secessionist groups to create breakaway states in Tibet, Mongolia, and Xinjiang. With a Chinese government having established control over this region, the powers that be have decided the best way to protect the rights of the locals and secure their loyalty has been to create a self-governing Autonomous Region."

### Decisions ###
 china_join_the_internationale_decision: "Join the Internationale"
 china_join_the_internationale_decision_desc: "When the German invasion collapsed the First Northern Expedition, many Kuomintang exiles sought refuge in the nations of the Third Internationale. Now with our strength revived and reinvigorated, it is only natural that we will be able to play a role in assisting the Third Internationale in spreading the world revolution as well as paying back our socialist comrades for their help over the years."

 china_join_the_moscow_accord_decision: "Join the Moscow Accord"
 china_join_the_moscow_accord_decision_desc: "The arrival of Black Monday has ended years of German dominance across the world. With rising powers across the world, it is only natural that China should seek allies. We may find such allies in our neighbours to the north, the Russians who are eagar to put aside our past squabbles for a new century led by the powers of Eurasia."

 china_join_the_co_pro_decision: "Join the Co-Prosperity Sphere"
 china_join_the_co_pro_decision_desc: "The Japanese, despite our prior estrangement and the wars that ensued, are still our Asian brothers. We allowed European imperialists to divide us, throwing the entire Asian continent into disarray and subjugation. Having proved our might and restored our dominance on land, while they continue to rule the seas, we can finally negotiate to work with them as equal partners. As allies, we will restore prosperity all of Asia!"

 china_invite_countries_to_faction: "Invite [FROM.GetNameDef] into the [ROOT.GetFactionName]"
 china_invite_countries_to_faction_desc: "China's rightful place in Asia is as the eldest brother, mentor, and leader of all the continent's peoples.

 chinese_unification: "Chinese Unification"
 chinese_unification_desc: "Central authority in China has long eroded, as decades of foreign imperialism, political instability and domestic unrest in light of imperial weakness spawned a new class of regional militarists in the ailing days of the old Qing Empire. The Xinhai Revolution brought further turmoil to the nation, as revolutionary generals seized control of numerous provinces and set about building complex networks of military officers, allied businessmen, landed gentry, sympathetic intelligentsia, and government officials.\n\nNevertheless, a common national identity remains, and various movements across the land have made their bid to unite the nation and rebuild China in their image. Taking advantage of their own patronage networks, foreign support, and growing armies, they clash for influence in the cities and countryside. Still, in the twisting and turning realities of warlord China, open warfare is not the only this conflict develops. Tales of shifting alliances and sordid betrayal unfold, all the while foreign invasion looms...\n\n§COur leadership is currently [ChinaGetMemberAlignment] §YAligned§!.§!"

 china_create_united_front: "Create the United Front"
 china_create_united_front_desc: "We, the descendants of Yan and Huang, cannot sit idly by as our country is powerless to stop the foreign devil from ravaging our lands. Too long have we been divided, split alongside provincial and factional lines while the imperialists look hungrily at our borders - ready to exploit our nation. No more! Let us put aside our petty squabbles for national unity to defend our honour, the honour of Zhonghua, from being tarnished forever! Qilai!"

 china_join_united_front: "Join the United Front"
 china_join_united_front_desc: "As the foreign imperialists launch a brutal invasion of our country, [FROM.GetName] has invited us to help defend China's honour in her hour of need. While our country still remains heavily divided between provincial and factional lines, our civilisation is at risk of being utterly destroyed. Let us put aside our differences and work together for the defence of the Motherland!"

 china_offer_ceasefire: "Negotiate a Ceasefire with [FROM.GetNameDef]"
 china_offer_ceasefire_desc: "China has found itself at war with a major power. Fighting them on our own would be a foolish decision while China is still divided. We should negotiate with our current enemies in [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] a temporary truce till the aggressor has been defeated. We must not forget that all the imperialists want are our riches. We have nothing to lose! Wansui!"

 china_declare_government_SHX_desc: "With our position in the North Chinese Plain secured, we may now boldly claim for ourselves the legacy of the Xinhai Revolution. Our new government shall now strive for national unification, vanquishing any rival contenders that may stand in our way. No one, except perhaps [SHX.GetLeader] in all his wisdom, could have expected the province of Shanxi to find itself in such power. But through our courage and valiance in liberating the Central Plains, we have proven ourselves worthy of leading the national unification!"

 china_declare_government_SHD_national_populist: "Declare the New Qing Empire"
 china_declare_government_SHD_national_populist_desc: "The fierce battle for the Forbidden City was pressed on Zhang Tianran's orders. The palace gates became a prison for the cowardly Aisin-Gioro family. Several family members attempted to leave but were led back, and the walls manned by Red Spears at all corners. Finally, the Emperor surrendered to the Shangqing. Instead of death, Puyi was forced to capitulate to Zhang Tianran in his Imperial Yellow Jacket, as well as reaffirm to the people his emperorship. Puyi will remain the Emperor, and the Shangqing Tianguo's minor emperors, managers and priests the official magistrates of the Qing Empire.\n\nZhang Tianran has absolved the captive Emperor of any guilt in this war, and declared that this victory is the culmination of a spiritual genealogy that began with the Boxers and Sun Yat-sen."

 china_declare_government_SHD_manchu_restoration: "Restore the Qing Empire"
 china_declare_government_SHD_manchu_restoration_desc: "Many doubted Qu Yingguang's ability to hold off the Zhili's invasion after the failure of the Manchu Coup, but now all doubt has been cleared. Not only has Shandong held off the attack, but Qu has guided Shandong and the emperor back from the brink, and we now stand stronger than ever. Puyi shall be restored as emperor, with his brother Pujie by his side, and Qu Yingguang will be their closest advisor. Let all who stand in our way know that the Manchu are back, and this time they are here to stay."

 china_declare_government_other: "Form a National Government"
 china_declare_government_other_desc: "Having secured our place as the strongest force in China, it is time that we declare our ambitions to unify the nation and end this miserable age of strife once and for all. It may attract some unwanted attention, and there will likely be conflict instigated by those who would seek to their own dominance over the land, but that is the sacrifice we must make to free our nation from warlordism once and for all!"

 china_declare_unification: "Declare the Reunification of China"
 china_declare_unification_desc: "Our foes have been vanquished and anyone who dared to unjustly claim the mantle of national leadership has been put back in their place.

We are the victors of the Warlord Era for better or for worse, and it is up to us to lead China into its benevolent future."

 KMT_conquer_beijing_fallback_decision_key: "Complete the Revolutionary Mission"
 KMT_conquer_beijing_fallback_decision_desc_key: "As long as reactionaries continue to rule over the Northern Capital, the great mission our late founder Dr. Sun Yat-sen has placed in our hands cannot succeed. We must prevail against the odds, to prepare a second march northwards. This is not just for the salvation of the revolutionary cause but we fight for the survival of the Chinese race! Long live the National Revolution, Long live the Republic of China!"

 CHN_conquer_beijing_fallback_decision_key: "Liberate Beijing"
 CHN_conquer_beijing_fallback_decision_desc_key: "Beijing was the ancient capital of China and holds a unique place in the Chinese national consciousness. To hold it means international recognition and domestic legitimacy, making its capture of the upmost essence. Since our original efforts to take the city have fallen short, we must redouble our efforts. Onwards, to a new China!"

 CHN_demand_control_of_beijing: "Demand Control of Beijing"
 CHN_demand_control_of_beijing_desc: "The end of the Northern Expedition has brought Beijing under the Kuomintang fold, however in practice the region remains under continued warlord rule. While this sort of local autonomy has proven to be a necessary evil as we proceed with unification, to allow this fate to befall China's ancient seat of power is flatly unacceptable. So long as Beijing remains out of the direct control of the central government, there will always be those plotting to undermine and usurp our authority. We must make moves to bring national rule to the North, bringing the revolution one step closer to completion."

 CHN_march_to_manchuria: "The March to Manchuria"
 CHN_march_to_manchuria_desc: "Too long has Manchuria been ran into ruin by the traitors to the Chinese nation and the Japanese imperialists who seek to exploit our country for her natural resources. While it is the eastern frontier of our territory outside of China proper, the Manchurian question is undeniable as [ROOT.GetNameDef] identifies the provinces of Dongbei as integral provinces of the Chinese state. While we stand behind the safety of the Shanhai Pass, let us take it upon ourselves - to liberate our countrymen once and unify the country once and for all."

 china_move_capital: "Declare a Permanent Capital"
 china_move_capital_desc: "There have been many capitals of a united Chinese state and with key parts of China under our rule, we can proclaim a permanent capital for the republic. There are four main choices to go with should we control that city: Nanjing, Beijing, Wuhan or Guangzhou. Each one brings unique advantages. We must consider this carefully as this decision will be irreversible."

 china_attack_decision: "Attack [FROM.GetNameDef]"
 china_attack_decision_desc: "The continued defiance of [FROM.GetAdjective] leadership is one that cannot be resolved by peaceful means. [FROM.GetLeader] has proven [FROM.GetLeader.GetHerselfHimself] an unworthy leader, and will be ejected from [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] by force."

 china_break_free_desc_lkmt: "The political intrigues and chicanery of [ROOT.Overlord.GetLeader]'s Kuomintang Central Committee has brought nothing but ruin to the Chinese nation and her people. It is time for [ROOT.GetLeader] and the true champions of Dr. Sun to charge forth, oust the traitors, and ride the high tide of the National Revolution. [ROOT.GetNameDefCap] may be outmanned, but our wills are steeled and our hearts speak true."
 china_break_free_desc_rkmt: "To think that the revolution would become so twisted, so divergent, from its original principles. The true interpretation of the Three People's Principles has been distorted by petty worlds, spineless intellectuals, and most of all the vile despot [ROOT.Overlord.GetLeader]. It is unfortunate, but as the nation teeters on the very verge of collapse, [ROOT.GetLeader] must detach [ROOT.GetNameDef] from the sinking ship, and charge forward to victory."
 china_break_free_desc_fed: "Ostensibly seeking the protection of the Chinese people, the development of a native democracy, and the promulgation of a true, free constitution, the Federalist movement has seen itself corrupted by autocrats and elites. Whilst we are no stranger to pragmatic deals, [ROOT.Overlord.GetLeader] has taken it too far. [ROOT.GetLeader] cannot simply stand on the sidelines as the very essence of the movement withers away."
 china_break_free_desc_zhili: "Improper to the upmost, the leadership of the Zhili clique has faltered for too long. Having lost the unity of the nation, and the control of [ROOT.GetNameDef], Governor [ROOT.GetLeader] had to ensure stability within the province. Yet again, it would appear that we must save the Chinese people. This time, however, it is not just [ROOT.GetNameDefCap], but the nation itself. Whilst uncouth for a subordinate to revolt against his superior, the decadence of [ROOT.Overlord.GetLeader]'s regime has stood for too long."
 china_break_free_desc_fengtian: "How could the nation have fallen so low? At first swayed by the grandstanding of Marshal Zuolin, championing the republican cause in light of the Xuantong Restoration, or perhaps even by [ROOT.GetLeader]'s' personal ties to the Zhang family. Yet the very nation is being lead to disarray and ruin under the rule of kleptocrats, simpletons and traitors, with a bandit like [ROOT.Overlord.GetLeader] lording over all of it. Ultimately, [ROOT.GetNameDefCap] must play our desperate hand, one last final bid for national leadership. It may be foolish, but our movement is no stranger to turncoats."
 china_break_free_desc_manchu: "Before our very eyes lies the Son of Heaven, ruling on his throne, lording over the true restoration of his authority, yet within our camp lies a strong sense of shame, of rejection, of reprehension. Is China not a modern nation? What was Xinhai for? All of the bloodshed, sacrificed and tears to overthrow the barbarity of the Manchu, just for us to rescind to our fates once again? No, no longer shall the supposed \"Mandate of Heaven\" lord over the free and independent Chinese people!"
 china_break_free_desc_fallback: "China is no stranger to the revolving door of executives seeking to steer the nation their way. Yet it has led to a directionless nation, collapsing in on itself. To truly save the people from their plight, we must work to overthrow [ROOT.Overlord.GetLeader], the latest buffoon to have taken the concept of national leadership. The new Chinese nation shall be a [ROOT.GetNameDef]-led one, free of corruption."

 CHN_join_NZH_decision: "Join the [NZH.GetName]"
 CHN_join_NZH_decision_desc: "The Northern Zhili Clique has dominated the Chinese political scene since their victory in 1927, weathering Beiyang's political storms, southern revolutionaries and northern rivals. Though their hegemony has been recently challenged, their victory is inevitable and with the preservation of Chinese morality and political order."

 CHN_join_SZH_decision: "Join the [SZH.GetName]"
 CHN_join_SZH_decision_desc: "The Southern Zhili Clique is an offshoot of the mainline branch in the north, centred around the legacy of Sun Chuanfang and his League of Eight Provinces.

 CHN_join_AGJ_decision_desc: "The National Pacification Army (the Anguojun) was a warlord coalition led by Zhang Zuolin that sought to fight off the revolutionary radicals of the Kuomintang and reunite China under the Fengtian Clique's banner.

 china_request_return_of_concessions: "Request the Return of the [FROM.GetAdjective] Concessions"
 china_request_return_of_concessions_desc: "The concessions were initially small pieces of land lease out to foreign powers in our weakness, which only expanded in scope as colonial powers sought to bring low our people.

Although one thing they are united in is the Zhili's role in China's unification.\n\nWith Cao Kun's faction relying on his political heavyweight career, ruling position within the Zhili Clique as a whole, and his hallmark constitution, they promote a series of cautious modernisation of the Chinese nation and the continuation of Beiyang's legacy. In contrast, Wu Peifu's faction promotes an intellectually minded Confucian Democratic Republic, hoping to remedy the mistakes of the Beiyang Republic in a form of genuine reformist intent.§!"
 china_faction_tenets_southern_zhili_desc: "§LThe lasting legacy of the \"Smiling Tiger\" Sun Chuanfang, the Southern Zhili Clique shares similar ancestry to the North Zhili Clique. With its progenitors being Li Hongzhang and Feng Guozhang, the South Zhili would split from their Northern relatives following the rise of the Three Supervisors of the Yangtze River. That being Feng Guozhang, Li Chun and Wang Zhanyuan.\n\nFurther emboldened by Wang Zhanyuan's power plays and Feng's death, the South Zhili would ultimately come into their own under Sun Chuanfang. With the formation of the League of Five Provinces, the Southern Zhili cemented their dominance within China's Eastern Coast. However ideologically the Southern Zhili are far from coherent, with the numerous members all espousing their own tenets.\n\nWith Sun Chuanfang promoting a sense of enlightened despotic republicanism, Qi Xieyuan in contrast promotes a policy of autocratic concessionist rule, with Chen Yi landing himself in a peculiar position as a Southern Zhili member that retains extensive ties to both Japan, and has sympathies for the ideals of the old Tongmenghui.§!"
 china_faction_tenets_manchu_qing_desc: "§LMuch detested by the Chinese people, the monarchy did not truly die in 1911. With the fire of monarchism continually championed by Kang Youwei, Liang Qichao, the Royal Family and other monarchical groups. Restored to prominence in a false gesture by the Zhili Clique, the monarchist groups within the Assembly were never truly satisfied with their position as second fiddle to Republicans.\n\nFollowing a period of Zhili weakness, the \"Manchu Coup\" was launched, seizing control of the Central Government and placing it in the hands of the Xuantong Emperor. Ruling through the Mandate of Heaven, and with various reformers and intellectuals at their side, the Restorationists champion a reformed Monarchy, one progressed onwards from the failures that led to the Xinhai Revolution.§!"
 china_faction_tenets_fengtian_desc: "§LThe Anguojun Government, formally the National Pacification Army Government, is the supposed last vestiges of the original Beiyang Republic. Or at least, such a statement is claimed by Grand Marshal Zhang Zuolin, its ruling figure. Underneath the surface however, the Anguojun is but another source of legitimacy with which Zhang Zuolin clings onto any claim of national legitimacy.\n\nGrouping together the many factions of the Fengtian Clique, such as the Shaoshuai Clique of Zhang Xueliang, the Shikan Clique of Yang Yuting, and the Zhang Clique, the Anguojun also incorporates those disparate factions from its time in Beijing. Carrying with it the legacy of 1928, the Shenyang Assembly sports members from the old Anhui Clique; not too dissimilar to the membership of the Jiwei club, the Old and New Communications Cliques, the Pro-Japanese Concordia Association, and finally any Beiyang bureaucrats ejected from the Beijing Assembly or Zhili. Dysfunctional at best, it is a situation held together by the sheer force of the Old Marshal alone.§!"
 china_faction_tenets_federalists_desc: "§LOwing a similar legacy to the Revolutionary Movements of the Xinhai Revolution, the Federalist movement can find its true ancestor in the form of the Tongmenghui. Further advanced by the intellectual musings of the legendary Zhang Taiyan, Liang Qichao, Song Jiaoren, and numerous others, the \"Provincial Constitution Movement\" would see rapid strides in provinces all around the nation. With Zhejiang, Hunan, Guangdong, Sichuan and Yunnan being the most successful.\n\nFollowing the developments of the Warlord Era, the Federalist movement would become a natural development as power moved from the Central Government towards the provincial level, and the status of the province rose. Seeing its first implementation in Hunan under Zhao Hengti, and in Zhejiang under the Zhejiang Autonomy Movement, Federalism would see further adoption and consideration throughout the nation.\n\nSplit ideologically, the Federalist movement carries with it the group that espouse \"bottom up\" Federalism, such as Li Jiannong and Zhao Hengti. \"Top Down\" Federalism as espoused by Tang Jiyao, and the well-field Federalist system promoted by Chen Jiongming. Seen as an alternative revolutionary movement to the Kuomintang, the Federalists saw little success in traditionally centralist North of the country, with their biggest proponents being minor parties within Beijing.§!"

Disgusted with the Beiyang Warlords, Sun established a rival government in Guangzhou in collaboration with other Southern Republicans, such as Chen Jiongming's Federalists. After Sun and Chen had a falling out, the former came into contact with the Internationale, which sent him assistance through Russian exile advisors.\n\nThe Bolsheviks helped Sun revolutionise the Kuomintang in the Reorganisation of 1924, which saw the Party adopt the principles of Democratic Centralism with the goals to unify China under a One-Party State, during which the Party would enact political tutelage to prepare China for democracy and promote Sun's Three Principles of Minsheng, Minzu, and Minquan. After Sun's death, the Kuomintang would become beset with factionalism between the leftists who supported the alliance with the Chinese Syndicalist League and the rightists who opposed it.\n\nAfter the Northern Expedition collapsed and Chiang Kai-shek was killed, the Central Committee fled to Paris with remnants maintaining an Insurgency in the MinGan region.

### Army Reform
 china_army_decisions: "Army Reform"
 china_army_decisions_desc: "Chinese armies and those of separatist states have long struggled to catch up to Western standards. Soldiers are notoriously poorly trained and disorderly, often recruited from a varied stock of bandits, petty criminals, and the chronically destitute. Equipment is regularly patchwork, obsolete, or even downright archaic. Loyalty is typically given to individual officers, or a regularly filled ricebowl, and ideological motivation is ephemeral at best. It will take a great deal to rebuild these armies along modern lines.\n"

 china_army_reform: "Army Reform"
 china_army_reform_desc: "Formed by the needs of the waning days of the old Qing Empire and moulded by the experiences of the Warlord Era, Chinese warlord armies and armies of various breakaway states are almost feudal in nature, organised by bands of regional strongmen. Our army has been frequently criticised for its low quality, with some officers accused of being incompetent at everything but enriching themselves. We must strive for more than this, especially if we wish to stand for anything greater."
 china_lessons_of_war: "Lessons of War"
 china_lessons_of_war_desc: "The lessons of war have taught us considerably in the ways of modern conflict. With renewed ambition, we must pursue major structural reforms to bring our forces up to date, building a force that can stand the test of time."

 CHN_cleanse_army_corruption_decision: "Cleanse Army Corruption"
 CHN_cleanse_army_corruption_decision_desc: "The soldier's pay has historically been very poor in China, but there is little shortage in \"alternative means of compensation\" for enterprising soldiers. Selling off military supplies to the black market, enrolling children and relatives as additional soldiers on the payroll, selling commissions and favours to other soldiers, extortion and protection rackets, and sometimes just outright theft from civilians are just a slice of ways Chinese soldiers have enriched themselves. Often times their officers take a cut or even take the lead in these operations. Despite our reforms, the rapid expansion of our military has been accompanied by an up-tick of corruption. This cannot stand. A thorough effort must be made to arrest embezzlers and crooks in uniform, thus ensuring supplies and men flow unimpeded to their destination as well as protect the reputation of our army."

 CHN_reorganise_military_units_decision: "Reorganise Military Units"
 CHN_reorganise_military_units_decision_desc: "Our march towards unification has come at a cost: many of our starting units have been severely thinned out from casualties and desertion, others have been swelled to an unmanageable size by deserting opponents and ad hoc reinforcements, while still others were rushed to the front before they could be properly constituted. As a result, quality has been severely degraded across the board - with uneven and ill-planned distributions of veteran and green units. Like a dulled knife, the army needs to be sharpened and this can only occur by rotating exhausted units to the rear echelons for much needed reprieve and reorganisation. Doing in a way that does not leave further vulnerabilities poses a significant logistical challenge and will require a major top-down effort by military planners. "

 CHN_disband_unreliable_units_decision: "Disband Unreliable Units"
 CHN_disband_unreliable_units_decision_desc: "The army as it stands is like a circus, a diverse collection of units of varying sizes, quality, and origins that looks like a display showcase rather than a uniform, disciplined symbol of the new government. While there are some elite, dedicated units bearing modern equipment and slick uniforms, they are few and far between compared to the larger number of ex-warlord and ex-bandit armies that harass the locals and then run at the face of danger. Worse, some units only exist on paper - these ghost units go beyond inflated unit rosters, with skeletal staffing if they exist at all.\n\nWhile quantity does have a quality of its own, it also has degrading effects on quality with many better units distrusting lesser ones to guard their flanks and more idealistic soldiers suffering severe damage to morale upon witnessing the barbaric acts of their \"comrades\" on the people. This problem has only gotten worse as we've absorbed many units from enemy armies. Still, removing and disarming these units will not be a pretty affair. There will copious amounts of counter-accusations of favouritism and corruption on the part of the auditors, and many will complain that we are placing political expediency over national unity."

 CHN_purge_disloyal_officers_decision: "Purge Disloyal Officers"
 CHN_purge_disloyal_officers_decision_desc: "As enemy armies began to disintegrate, many of our former foes began to defect and sometimes entire formations changed uniforms. Unfortunately, this is often dismissed as just another reality of a military career in warlord China and neighbouring areas and while somewhat true many grow complacent about the dangers this poses for the future of the army. Many freshly recruited officers are not particularly interested in our cause, yet expect to retain the same privileges and status they enjoyed under their previous employers. Some are borderline mutinous, dismissive of loyal officers' attempts to integrate them into oru mission.\n\nWe excise this tumour before it begins to spread, dismissing the most egregious examples and pre-emptively screening future recruits for loyalty. Of course, dismissed officers in the region tend to depart in turn with entire staff and units loyal to them personally, taking their guns with them. There is plenty of concern they will become bandits so we must be extra alert."

 china_poor_officers_fixed_text: "Desertion has declined thanks to a mix of pay increases, better morale, and greater competence across the board. Ghost soldiers are being slowly eliminated from army rosters, though considerably more reforms are required to fully eliminate the issue. With officers promoted by merit rather than patronage or nepotism, a coordinated and effective command structure can emerge its place."
 china_poor_army_3_officers: "Warlord Era Inadequacies"
 china_poor_army_3_officers_desc: "Despite various claims, there has never really been a \"Chinese Army\". Instead, the military is decentralised, highly factional, and irregular - the armies of the various warlords and breakaway states having grown haphazardly and semi-independently over decades of conflict. Most significant forces are regional, oversized, poorly maintained, and distrustful of one another, if not outright hostile. Corruption is endemic. Where logistics exist, most are simple coolie or mule trains complemented by regular robbery of the surrounding countryside. Though a few units appear to meet western standards, the vast majority do not, and better resemble gangs of bandits and other criminals. Even in peacetime, mere word of an approaching army is often enough for local peasants to flee the oncoming wave of looting and abuse."

 CHN_military_disarray_idea1: "Military Disarray"
 CHN_military_disarray_idea1_desc: "Despite resounding successes on the battlefield and the bravery our soldiers demonstrated on the march towards unification, the army has grown severely bloated as a result of incorporating thousands of defectors, volunteers, and the capture of enemy stockpiles. At the same time, paradoxically, many of the army's elite starting units have grown depleted as the expedition went on, some existing effectively only on paper. Their reinforcements have been either delayed or redirected as logistics snarled going northwards.\n\nThe pervasive, nearly systematic, rot that has spread across the army has become impossible to excise. If we are to save it from becoming a shambling mass of men, the only realistic solution left is to temporarily demobilise entire army corps wholescale and rebuild anew division by division. This is a tall order and expected to face significant resistance, especially since warlord units will face the brunt of disbandment orders."
 CHN_military_disarray_idea2: "Military Disorder"
 CHN_military_disarray_idea2_desc: "Some progress has been made in rebuilding the army, though problems continue. Many local commanders have resisted our orders to disband, fearing that our efforts will come primarily at the expense of their power. Others fear demobilisation will leave their sectors unguarded, or hesitate to split apart units that have years of camaraderie.\n\nStill, brigade by brigade and regiment by regiment our divisions are slowly being reconstituted once more into fighting units. As the frontline solidifies somewhat, a more steady logistical train has been established, thus alleviating some pressing concerns about the state of our military. Time is of the essence however, it is only a matter of time before the Army is once more called to protect and defend China."
 CHN_military_disarray_idea3: "Military Disorganisation"
 CHN_military_disarray_idea3_desc: "The sweeping successes of the army during the Northern Expedition hid a growing problem within its ranks: that of outrunning its logistical tail and becoming over-bloated like the armies of the warlords. After thorough discussion and realising there was no other options, the high command ordered a thorough demobilisation.\n\nIt was a painful process but it seems that the worst of it is behind us now. Most of our best divisions are fully restored, and those we have raised or acquired along the way have been largely integrated into our ranks. There remain many command and control issues at a corps and army level, though this can be chalked up to growing pains as our freshly build army balloons in size. They must remain vigilant however, we have considerable ground to make up as we continue onwards to national unification."

 CHN_devastated_national_econ_idea: "Devastated National Economy"
 CHN_devastated_national_econ_idea_desc: "It is rather easy to win a war. It is far harder to govern. Or at least that is what they say, and indeed the stories of Yuan Shikai, Sun Yat-sen, Duan Qirui, and others suggest that it is true in China. The initial ouster of the old central government has created tremendous instability in the Chinese economic scene, with the risk of hyperinflation threatening the very fabric our government. Looting remains widespread, and many fear it is systematic and as the new government struggles to make its payroll, harsher taxes are being levied on the people.\n\nThe problems we face have a deeper historical root. China was once the wealthiest nation in the world, the centre of booming trade and elegant craftsmanship. The decadence of the Qing dynasty, isolation from the outside world, and our predecessors' failure to grasp the significance of the industrial revolution doomed the mighty power to a Century of Humiliations. Having failed to modernise and keep pace with foreign powers, China lagged behind in industrial production. Heavily dependent on foreign investment to industrialise, what little that has been created is largely owned by foreigners, who exploit their advantageous position to extract significant concessions from squabbling and corrupt Chinese leaders. Meanwhile, the countryside is still underdeveloped and unequal, with little mechanisation and production while remaining manpower intensive.\n\nUnder strain from recent wars, forced to bear the burdens of moving armies, taxation, and war-time destruction, the system has effectively collapsed. Foreign investors are pulling out, trade is disrupted, looting and banditry is widespread, and vast swathes of territory under our control is facing famine. Many are questioning our government's ability to back up the currency it is issuing or handle the growing crisis, and we have precious little time to get things back on track."
 CHN_devastated_national_econ2_idea: "Damaged National Economy"
 CHN_devastated_national_econ2_idea_desc: "Although the [ROOT.GetAdjective] economy has improved somewhat, its woes still continue to multiply. Attracted like flies to the emerging stability of the new government, creditors of the previous government have come out of the woodwork expecting us to honour our obligations. Our actual ability to pay off our debts is still in the air as many still distrust the longevity of our regime and plenty refuse to accept our currency. More has to be done and fast - our armies, government, and patronage networks require money to run. The longer we dawdle, the more risk we undertake.\n\nWe may have less room to manoeuvre than our western counterparts. After a Century of Humiliations, China's economy is very fragile with limited modernisation in its agricultural and industrial sectors. Heavily dependent on foreign investments and the expense of political stability, and suffering from severe socio-political rot due to the warlord era, the strains of recent war severely damaged the economy of territories under our control. Though we may have stemmed the worst of the crisis, heading off inflation and bringing workers, merchants, and peasants back to work remains a priority. Fears of a famine have mostly subsided, though many continue to go hungry and there are areas that remain at severe risk for further crisis. There is much for us to do before we can declare a return to normal."
 CHN_devastated_national_econ3_idea: "Disrupted National Economy"
 CHN_devastated_national_econ3_idea_desc: "After considerable hard work over the last few months, our economy has stabilised considerably. Although we still struggle to maintain our reserves and back up our currency, there has been some faith in the money we have printed and they are mostly accepted within our borders. Once thought to be at risk of bankruptcy, we have assured most of the world of our financial prudence. The Century of Humiliations may have left a battered China, with an economy that could ill afford the chaos caused by warlord infighting, but the nation has proved far more resilient than expected. With more and more people coming to accept that our government is likely here to stay, a gentle hum has returned to the factories and farms as the economy comes back to life and the people return to their livelihoods. Productivity has mostly returned to normal in our core territories, though areas more recently seized by our forces remain in dire straits as we work to reintegrate the disrupted system. Even when we are done, further efforts are needed to truly bring China into the future."

 CHN_national_illiteracy1_idea: "National Illiteracy"
 CHN_national_illiteracy1_idea_desc: "Illiteracy remains widespread across the nation, despite persistent calls from reforms across the political spectrum to address the issue. For many, it has become emblematic of the \"backwardness\" China suffers from, especially in rural areas where access to books, teachers, and schoolhouses remains limited. Truancy is common too, since many perceive (to varying degrees of correctness) the curriculum as hopelessly out of date and impractical, preferring instead to help out with family farms and business or acquire more hands-on skills elsewhere. Many fail to complete mandatory middle schooling, and fewer finish a optional high school education. For the lucky few who can afford to study at universities, many wonder if they will be able to secure a job afterwards in the rapidly changing (often for the worst) economy. It is unlikely that we will be able to fix all these major issues in such a short time, but we can stem at least the worst of it."

After years of domestic turmoil and governmental neglect, many continue to suffer under the yoke of unfair tenantry laws, inadequate equipment, out-of-date techniques, various predatory entities, and natural disasters.\n\nWith our battlefield victories now won, it is up to us to face the next front in China's reconstruction and make those triumphs count.

 #chi_for.102.d: "The Kuomintang have long been a menace to our interests in East Asia, receiving extensive support from Syndicalist powers and riling up the people with their socialist, nationalistic messaging. Our intervention to save China from syndicalist rule in the 1920s was supposed to bring peace, but it seems that it has only bought them a decade to prepare - an opportunity squandered by our various allies in the continent. Emerging from their hiding places in Fujian, they have spent the last few years dismantling the hard work we have put in building a security architecture capable of keeping the Japanese and Syndicalists out.\n\nNow they are at our gates, demanding that we hand over all concessions we have in their \"integral territories\" lest there be war. Although perhaps it would be easy to acquiesce to these threats, it would be a great shame for our nation. Qingdao was a small fishing village when we first arrived and received a 99 year lease, and it was through a tremendous investment by our admiralty that it has become a modern port that it is today. And if it wasn't for us, it would've been seized by the Japanese during the Weltkrieg. To lose Qingdao and the other territories would truly mark the end of the age of German influence in the region."

If anything, they have increased the fortifications of their territories, putting their troops on high alert and declaring the need to protect the citizens under their protection from the \"Red Menace\". We have word that their fleet and whatever forces they can muster are being deployed in effort to buttress their defences.\n\nIt hardly matters however, at least for many of our high command and leading anti-Imperialist thinkers. Ever since the Germans' intervention during the northern expedition, many have held a grudge - waiting for the day to avenge their fallen comrades.

Formally rented from the Chinese government after an agreement in 1557, Macau has since become a major city and the embodiment of what a successful Sino-Portuguese cooperation could look like.\n\nInstead however, the new red government has elected to throw all of that away in favour of violence, threatening a broader war. Although they claim to be \"liberators\", we point out that many refugees fleeing the socialist menace have fled into our concession - showing how little legitimacy their government has. On the other hand however, our forces are stretched fairly thin, and Macau is a long way from the metropole. The local Governor and military authorities have begun sending urgent telegrams asking for instructions on what to do next."

This victory, done with as little violence or costly fighting, is proof of the growing strength of the Chinese people and is one great step towards reversing the humiliation our nation has experienced.

 #chi_for.107.d: "The Portuguese have stubbornly and foolishly decided to fight for control of Macau. Citing a litany of ancient treaties and various testimonies of reactionaries and warlords that have holed up in their concession of \"Socialist abuses\", they have made it clear that our attempt to take back Macau means war. We are, however, unbowed. The Chinese people are behind us, behind our revolution, behind our principles. The imperialists have stolen our land and exploited our people for centuries now, and Macau was perhaps one of the first instances of Chinese land being taken by force. With banners raised, we go forward for the liberation of the people from Portuguese domination!"
 #chi_for.107.a: "Onwards!"

 #lngupc.31.t: "[From.GetName] Demands Integration!"
 #lngupc.31.d: "With intensified anti-imperialist rhetoric, [FROM.GetLeader] has made it clear that our uncertain status cannot be maintained any longer. While the municipalities under our control are guaranteed to have autonomy under the Chinese Constitution, we are to be returned to direct control of the Chinese Federal Government with the Unequal Treaties declared null and void."
 #lngupc.31.a: "We shall join the reunited China. (Play as [From.GetName])"

 #chi_for.21.t: "An Ultimatum from the KMT"
 #chi_for.21.d: "Ever since the Hong Kong incident in 1925, the international community looked with suspicion on the Kuomintang - fearing their radical socialist and nationalistic tendencies. Their defeat in the Northern Expedition was supposed to extinguish the threat for good, and the establishment of the Legation Cities was meant to ensure a peaceful and cooperative future with the Chinese. When reports of a KMT insurgency emerging in the mountains first came in, Sun Chuanfang and the league were supposed to handle it, holding up their end of the bargain. How wrong we were.\n\nThe uprising of the KMT remnant overtook the League all too quickly in 1936, and since then we have watched in trepidation as the socialist army marched across China - no doubt backed by Syndicalist powers. Multiple attempts to stop this red tide by native Chinese forces have failed, and our commanders had begun preparing for the inevitable.\n\nThings have finally come to a head today. Emboldened by their successes, KMT agitators staged a series of protests and strikes across our cities - a flimsy pretext to invade. We have received a final ultimatum personally signed by [CHI.GetLeader], demanding that transfer over control of our concessions over to their authorities - which would mark the end of the Legations.\n\nGiven the overwhelming power of the nationalist government, our administration is divided. Some say we would be better off cutting our losses and leaving, while others argue that the powerful defence we have erected and the loyalty we have gained from the locals (joined by those fleeing the KMT's advance) will be sufficient to hold them off until foreign reinforcements arrive. Finally, the council arrives at a decision..."
 #chi_for.21.a: "They made us an offer we can't refuse."
 #chi_for.21.b: "Great Powers will protect us."
 #
 #chi_for.22.t: "Reply from Legation Cities"
 #chi_for.22.d1: "The Legation Cities have agreed to finally rejoin China after oppressing the Chinese citizens there for many years, places like Hong Kong and Shanghai haven't truly been free for decades with generations living and dying under European yoke. Now with the key cities under our control, they can, at last, be free from European colonialism."
 #chi_for.22.d2: "The Legations have refused our just demands and have pleaded with Europe for protection, this won't save them when our armies are read. The only question is, should we go as far as to attack them?"
 #chi_for.22.a: "Goodbye, the imperialists."
 #chi_for.22.b: "The imperialists are not credible."

 #lngkmt.12.t: "Request from the Central Committee"
 #lngkmt.12.d: "The reorganised Central Committee of the Kuomintang in Guangzhou has sent a simple request that we rejoin their ranks. This means putting ourselves under their command and supervision. For the good of the nation, of course."
 #lngkmt.12.a: "Of course. For the Republic!"
 #lngkmt.12.b: "This is encroaching on our autonomy!"
 #
 #lngkmt.13.t: "[FROM.GetLeader] Refuses our Request"
 #lngkmt.13.d: "The treacherous dogs in [FROM.GetNameDef] have refused to comply! They have essentially refused to recognise the authority of the Central Committee and they shall receive the punishment befitting traitors."
 #lngkmt.13.a: "They will pay."

 china_events.0.t.ally_of_target: "Imminent [FROM.FROM.GetAdjective] Invasion of [FROM.GetName]"
 china_events.0.d.target: "Reports from the border indicate that we will soon be under attack from our wretched neighbours in [FROM.GetName]. Dissatisfied with our government, [FROM.GetLeader] has formally denounced us before a crowd in [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. Since then, more and more units have amassed along the border. Small skirmishes have already begun as our opponents make probing attacks and tensions spike. We must hurry to our defence, lest we be crushed under the weight of our foes."
 china_events.0.d.ally_of_target: "We have received a warning from our allies in [FROM.GetName] that an invasion from [FROM.FROM.GetName] is on the horizon. Both sides have already begun preparation for such a conflict as the border grows increasingly tense. Given our prior obligations to [FROM.GetName], we will likely be drawn into this conflict. We must begin scrambling troops of our own immediately - let us hope that our decision to ally with the [FROM.GetAdjective] was not made too hastily."
 china_events.0.a: "Assemble the general staff!"

 china_events.1.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Demands Our Submission"
 china_events.1.d: "Confident in their growing strength or perhaps merely seeking to project it in these times of troubles, we have received a series of demands from [FROM.GetLeader]'s government demanding our immediate recognition of their authority. This would naturally entail the stationing of troops, adhering to their decrees and likely further tributes that would naturally be sent to a national government.\n\nCalling their bluff of course, is always an option. It will likely mean war, though freedom from tyranny often requires such a price. Especially in warlord-era China, the nation is littered with failed governments who overstretched themselves assailing \"weak\" and \"vulnerable\" factions. Submitting for now and playing the long-game is also an option as well."
 china_events.1.a: "We acquiesce to their demands."
 china_events.1.b: "We stand defiant!"
 china_events.1.c: "We are the legitimate government of China!"

 china_events.2.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Submits to Our Authority"
 china_events.2.d: "Seeing few potential options to preserve their autonomy and believing us to be their best one, the government of [FROM.GetLeader] has agreed to recognise us as the legitimate rulers of China. In doing so they have committed to harmonising their laws with ours, provide troops for our wars, and commit to further coordination in national affairs.\n\nIn return however they have in practice preserved much of their old government, as well as the patronage networks that operate underneath. Warlord troops have always been known to be unwieldy and the warlords themselves untrustworthy. Further integration will have to be discussed another day, for now though the status quo works."
 china_events.2.a: "We are magnanimous rulers."

 china_events.3.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Refuses to Yield!"
 china_events.3.d: "Despite our efforts to settle the matter peacefully, [FROM.GetLeader] has formally renounced our efforts at promoting national unity and begun mobilising [FROM.GetAdjective] units in a show of force to try and ward us off. [FROM.GetLeader.GetSheHeCap] has also ejected all of our representatives and denounced our government as illegitimate, spreading such vile lies throughout [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName].\n\nNaturally his actions are a grave insult, but our best course of action remains to be seen. Given the stubborn and fickle nature of warlords, rejection was always in the cards. But enforcing our will on [FROM.GetNameDef] will require allocating forces which may be spent elsewhere. Timing, as always, is everything."
 china_events.3.a: "Let us begin a buildup at the border."
 china_events.3.b: "The invasion begins now!"

 china_events.3000.t: "The [FROM.GetName] Offers a joint strike against [GXC.GetAdjective]"
 china_events.3000.d: "A most peculiar offer has arrived upon the desk of [ROOT.GetLeader] as of recent. Intermixed with the flurrying reports on the national situation was a finely printed telegram from the neighbouring Governor of [FROM.GetNameDefCap], [FROM.GetLeader]. Indicating mutual allegiances to our shared cause, the promotion of national unity, securing of borders, and the furthering mutual ties, the esteemed Governor has offered a \"joint strike\" between [ROOT.GetLeader] and [FROM.GetLeader] directed at [GXC.GetLeader].\n\nWhilst a prospect of keen interest, it does not prove entirely risk free. For it would thrust our soldiers into another possibly senseless war in essence to seize the two provinces of Guangxi and Guangdong for our mutual cause. Similarly however, that could yield great benefit for the party able to secure and maintain control of Canton, the very key to the South of the nation. Equally enticing is the nature of the offer, as it is only as good as the paper that it is printed upon, and should the situation change, could be reneged upon."
 china_events.3000.a: "Arm in arm, we advance on Guangdong!"
 china_events.3000.b: "I was never one to trust [FROM.GetLeader]."

 china_events.3001.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Answers Our Call!" #YUN/HNN Accept
 china_events.3001.d: "Most fortuitous news! It would appear our call for aid in a future campaign against [GXC.GetLeader] has been met with a resounding success. Exchanging great pleasantries with [ROOT.GetLeader] over telegram, and informing us of the positive insights of his plan, [FROM.GetLeader] has formally dedicated his force of arms towards the conquest of Guangdong. Now we must merely plan for the future conflict, and hope his word holds true."
 china_events.3001.a: "The beginning of something greater?"

 china_events.3002.t: "The [FROM.GetName] Refuse Our Call!" #YUN/HNN Decline
 china_events.3002.d: "Tragic news has reached the Governor's desk! It would appear our call for aid in a future campaign against [GXC.GetLeader] has been met with a resounding failure. Exchanging great pleasantries with [ROOT.GetLeader] over telegram, and informing us of the positive insights of his plan, [FROM.GetLeader] nonetheless refused to dedicate any man or materiel towards the conquest of Guangdong. Citing the possible dangers, instability of the nation, and the preference for inner stability as opposed to inviting further conflict, [FROM.GetLeader] has stayed short of denouncing our proposed actions. Humbly alone, we must plan for the future battle without their help."
 china_events.3002.a: "I suppose I cannot say we are disappointed."

 china_events.3003.t: "The Honour-less [FROM.GetAdjective]" #YUN/HNN Refuse to enter after agreeing
 china_events.3003.d: "Perhaps it is too much to expect sincerity and honour from the Warlord Era, and yet it continues to disappoint. Despite prior agreements, joint exercises, and even the joint drafting of a campaign plan to valiantly squash [GXC.GetLeader] and his illegal polity situated upon our mutual border, it would appear that [FROM.GetLeader] has developed second thoughts on the cusp of initiative. Either unprepared to throw away lives, or utterly unwilling in the first place, [FROM.GetLeader] recently telegraphed [ROOT.GetLeader], promising assurances that they would not interfere in our course of action, but they would no longer support it.\n\nWhilst not unfounded, it has developed both great animosity and ferocity within our ranks, with many of the more keen warmongers suggesting a dual-pronged attack. Thankfully, [ROOT.GetLeader] appears to not even be considering that as an option. Instead [FROM.GetLeader]'s words appear to have carried some sort of sway, perhaps at least sentiment. If they are backing out, is there some truth to their words? Would it be wise to reconsider an offensive for Canton?"
 china_events.3003.a: "It's not like we needed them anyway!"
 china_events.3003.b: "Perhaps there is wisdom in their action."

 china_events.3004.t: "[YUN.GetNameDefCap] and [HNN.GetNameDefCap] prepare to mobilise against us!"
 china_events.3004.d: "It would appear that Liangguang's position within the nation is most threatening to its neighbours, most important of which being that of [HNN.GetNameDefCap] and [YUN.GetNameDefCap]. Situated to the direct north and west, the affairs of the Southwest have commonly been dominated by events within Guangdong spiralling out towards Hunan and Yunnan. Therefore it is natural for Kunming and Changsha to be wary of occurrences within Canton. Seeing possible vulnerability, or perhaps overwhelming odds, [YUN.GetLeader] and [HNN.GetLeader] recently announced a formal campaign to eject [ROOT.GetLeader] from \"squatting\" upon Guangdong.\n\nCiting stability within the Southwest, unity of the nation, and the removal of \"bandits\", the armies of Xiang and Dian have reportedly amassed on our mutual provincial borders, exchanging skirmishes with local border detachments. It would appear it is only a matter of time before the gavel strikes, and in such an event the general staff and soldiers must undoubtedly be prepared."
 china_events.3004.a: "Two against one? I like those odds."

 china_events.4.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Offers an Alliance"
 china_events.4.d: "Just because we are the only legitimate government of China does not mean we travel alone. There are many sympathetic to our goals throughout the nation, just waiting for liberation. Sometimes, however, they manage to liberate themselves in advance.\n\n[FROM.GetLeader] appears to have done just that, rallying the [FROM.GetRulingParty] to free the people of [FROM.GetNameDef]. Aligned with our cause, or at least so they claim, we have officially received their petition to join our cause as a local affiliate."
 china_events.4.a: "We graciously accept."
 china_events.4.b: "We cannot trust them."

 china_events.5.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Accepts our Alliance"
 china_events.5.d: "Having heard our petition to align with them, we have been officially accepted into the ranks of [FROM.GetNameDef]. Communications between our officers are being established, and we will work more closely towards national liberation. [FROM.GetLeader] has officially commended [ROOT.GetLeader] and the [FROM.GetRulingParty] in a speech at [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] for their patriotic efforts, deepening our ties. Although a small victory for us today, history will remember this as a critical step toward the future of China."
 china_events.5.a: "Onwards comrades!"

 china_events.6.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Refuses an Alliance"
 china_events.6.d: "Despite our sincere efforts at national unity, the paranoid clique surrounding [FROM.GetLeader] has decided to reject our efforts at joining their movement, going so far as to denounce us as duplicitous and power-hungry. These unfair accusations only serve to demonstrate their own internal rot, unable to trust outsiders with power.\n\nWe will have to find our own way towards liberation, independent of [FROM.GetAdjective] machinations. In doing so we bear the true legacy of Xinhai, one uncorrupted by the tendrils of [FROM.GetLeader]."
 china_events.6.a: "Their cause is not as noble as they say."

 china_events.7.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Invites us to Join Ranks"
 china_events.7.d: "Even as China grew more and more divided, there were many across the nation that shared a common vision for the future of the nation. These kindred spirits were often divided by mountains and rivers, forced to fight their own regional battles for dominance. Still, it is always a pleasant sight when the stars align and comrades independently take power.\n\n[FROM.GetLeader] of [FROM.GetNameDef] has identified our [ROOT.GetRulingParty] as an ally in their quest to liberate the nation. [ROOT.GetLeader] has been invited to join forces, bringing China ever closer to unification without firing a shot."
 china_events.7.a: "We accept wholeheartedly."
 china_events.7.b: "We are not affiliated with one another."

 china_events.8.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Joins our Ranks!"
 china_events.8.d: "Thanks in part to the similar roots between [FROM.GetRulingParty] and our own [ROOT.GetRulingParty], it appears that our goals have remained aligned over the years. [FROM.GetLeader] of [FROM.GetNameDef] has agreed to begin coordinating our efforts at unification, peacefully bringing [FROM.GetNameDef] into the [ROOT.GetAdjective] fold.\n\nWith any luck, our combined forces will be sufficient to bring about successful national liberation from the chaos and strife that has engulfed it. With momentum on our side, the combined might of our forces will continue onwards to victory!"
 china_events.8.a: "One cause for one nation."

 china_events.9.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Denies our Alliance!"
 china_events.9.d: "Despite the similar roots of the [FROM.GetRulingParty] and our own [ROOT.GetRulingParty], it appears that our goals have diverged over the years. [FROM.GetLeader] of [FROM.GetNameDef] has denied our efforts at peacefully unifying our cause against mutual enemies, instead electing to go their own route.\n\nThis treason can only be explained by their own selfishness and inability to think beyond their own interests. Whatever the case, it appears that it is up to us to bear the true legacy of Xinhai, and carve a future for all the Chinese people."
 china_events.9.a: "[FROM.GetAdjective] traitors ought to at least stay out of our way."

 china_events.10.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Attempts to Increase Integration"
 china_events.10.d.integration_level_1: "Having already professed our loyalty to the [FROM.GetAdjective] cause, one would believe some trust is in order. Nonetheless, [FROM.GetLeader] insists that further efforts at integration is necessary to continue on with national liberation, and insisting on further oversight in our internal matters.\n\nFor now, this only means a slight increase in the number of [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] magistrates roaming about, but by accepting the state of affairs will subtly but perceptibly change. The extensive autonomy we have so far enjoyed will begin chipping away and many will begin turning away from [ROOT.GetLeader] and look towards [FROM.GetLeader] for leadership. Perhaps now it is time to break free and save our independence."
 china_events.10.d.integration_level_2: "We have long enjoyed our autonomy here in [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], far from the prying eyes of central authority. This has in many ways made things more efficient in terms of governance, though we are by no means secessionist or regionalist (rather dirty words within Chinese politics). Still, it appears things are changing.\n\nThe [FROM.GetRulingParty] operating out of [FROM.GetNameDef] have insisted on greater control over our mostly autonomous political council. They insist on control over several key internal functions, something that we had thought would be left alone when we initially agreed to submit to [FROM.GetAdjective] rule. Of course, refusing will have dire consequences, but we are quickly approaching the turning point in which it will be difficult to escape [FROM.GetLeader]'s grasp. We must now seriously contemplate the risks and successes of breaking free from the grasp of this newly proclaimed government."
 china_events.10.d.integration_level_3: "Leading members of the [ROOT.GetRulingParty] have begun growing anxious as of late, as their long-entrenched patronage networks grow threatened by the increasing presence of [FROM.GetAdjective] agents. Rumours abound that the [FROM.GetRulingParty] has begun establishing regional headquarters in [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], hoping to build a political base of their own.\n\nThe point of no return nears, as magistrates from the central government grow bolder in their efforts to subjugate us. Laws passed in [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], previously often ignored, are now being enforced with increasing vigour. Sooner or later we will be nothing more than another province under the auspices of the [FROM.GetRulingParty]. We have no choice but to prepare our selves for war."
 china_events.10.d.integration_final: "It has been a long time coming, but all the same there was some shock within [ROOT.GetLeader]'s inner circle when [FROM.GetNameDef] made their move today. In a private meeting, [FROM.GetLeader] spoke about the future of [ROOT.GetNameDef], and while assuring that [ROOT.GetLeader] will remain governor for the time being, the central government will take steps as necessary to ensure his rule is compatible with the ideals of the [FROM.GetRulingParty].\n\nLeft unspoken is the growing control in which [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] has asserted over us, with the expectation that they will have the right to de facto (and possibly even de jure) select a new governor and veto internal appointments. There is really no other choice at this point, either we go down in history as good [FROM.GetRulingParty] soldiers or [ROOT.GetLeader] makes one final desperate stand against their rule. This pivotal moment shall decide the fate of our province henceforth."
 china_events.10.a: "We accept [FROM.GetAdjective] rule."
 china_events.10.b: "We oppose this encroachment!"

 china_events.11.t: "Integration of [ROOT.GetNameDef] Progresses"

 china_events.11.intro: "We have long enjoyed our autonomy as an independent province, away from the shadow of the central government. Due to the corruption and instability of China's political climate, we have turned away from any notion of centralisation - finding that in this chaotic period of strife; only self-governance would alleviate our own problems. Indeed, for many years we have set about to carry out our own reforms and to reinforce our cultural differences from the rest of the country."

 china_events.11.d.integration_level_1: "$china_events.11.intro$\n\nGoverning officials from [THIS.overlord.GetNameDef] have demanded that our local radios and our newspapers to cease the production of dialect-based media. The news is henceforth broadcasted from the language chosen by [THIS.overlord.GetNameDef] and to cease publication of our provincial newspaper. Several prominent authors in our province have resigned out of protest, and voices have sprung up in fear of further centralisation."
 china_events.11.d.integration_level_2: "$china_events.11.intro$\n\nGoverning officials from [THIS.overlord.GetNameDef] have demanded that all local culture festivals are to be shut down as they are \"inciting notions of separation\" and are reminiscent \"of a backwards and archaic era\". Local elders and villages have cried out in protest at local councils throughout the province."
 china_events.11.d.integration_level_3: "$china_events.11.intro$\n\nGoverning officials form [THIS.overlord.GetNameDef] have demanded that our schools immediately suspend their local curriculums and to adopt their language to be the language of instruction in their classrooms. At the same time, many teachers and professors have lodged complaints of protest against our government. Even more shocking are that we finding that it is more and more difficult for parents unable to communicate with their children. As instruction is now in the dialect of [THIS.overlord.GetNameDef], a greater number of our citizens, from students to local rickshaw pullers, cannot speak either the new national dialect or their old one."
 china_events.11.d.integration_final: "$china_events.11.intro$\n\nOur home province, while appearing the same on the outside, has experienced significant political, social, and economic shifts since the centralisation of our country. Magistrates and governing bodies are now directly appointed by the central government in [THIS.overlord.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. While plenty in the province still speak their provincial dialect fluently, the younger generation of today only speaks in the national dialect. Our economy has also experienced profound changes as the once useful provincial monetary system has collapsed in the wake of adopting the national currency. Furthermore, our provincial forces have all been nationalised, leaving any notion of political independence from the central government gone."
 china_events.11.a: "Change comes inevitably."

 china_events.12.t: "Our Efforts to Integrate [FROM.GetNameDef]"
 china_events.12.intro: "In recent weeks we have taken steps to further integrate the [FROM.GetAdjective] administration with our own, making slow but steady progress in this regard. This has of course not gone unnoticed by [FROM.GetLeader] and the [FROM.GetRulingParty], but it appears that they have generally acquiesced to our demands, whether out of genuine ideological loyalty or because they see unification as fait accompli."

 china_events.12.d.integration_level_1: "$china_events.12.intro$\n\nTo prepare such matters, let us proclaim to their government that they must henceforth use our dialect in all forms of public communication. Not only will this help tear down provincial dialect barriers but it will help us prevent means of local dissent. In any case, our control over [FROM.GetNameDef] has greatly increased from before."
 china_events.12.d.integration_level_2: "$china_events.12.intro$\n\nWe must reach out to the masses of China as well and inform that we are bringing China into a modern age, a new era for the Chinese nation. At such a crucial time of national unification, we must let them know that their local and backward customs can no longer exist in comparison with modern knowledge."
 china_events.12.d.integration_level_3: "$china_events.12.intro$\n\nThe future of China belongs to the new youth, and the youth must learn our ways and understand our authority if our hold on China is to carry on for generations. Let us send out an order to have their schools use our languages in instruction and conversation."
 china_events.12.d.integration_final: "Our efforts to integrate the [FROM.GetAdjective] provincial administration with our own has been a complete success. Their people are now content and understanding of our rule, with favourable reports arriving weekly from our appointed magistrates. Furthermore, we hear that their society is now embracing the culture of our capital region and that their schools use our dialect in all forms of dialogue. We do not need to worry about dissent as their local media no longer broadcast with their provincial dialects, and their army is now fully integrated into ours."
 china_events.12.a: "One step further in the road to unification."

 china_events.13.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Revolts Against Integration"
 china_events.13.d: "Warlords are fickle, untrustworthy beasts, always jealously guarding their autonomy despite the costs it imposes on the nation and their people. Although we tried to be as reasonable and subtle as possible during the transition, [FROM.GetLeader] has stubbornly resisted our efforts to bring [FROM.GetNameDef] closer in line with what is expected from our national cause.\n\nHe has instead rallied the [FROM.GetRulingParty] against us, denouncing what he decries as [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] tyranny and efforts to disarm [FROM.GetAdjective] military forces. We must work to quickly quell this rebellion, and with any luck avoid any further damage to our cause."
 china_events.13.a: "A small price to pay for national salvation."

 china_events.14.t: "[FROM.FROM.GetNameDefCap] Revolts Against [FROM.GetNameDef]"
 china_events.14.d: "Shocking news has arrived in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] as word of a [FROM.FROM.GetAdjective] rebellion against the authority of [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] spreads. Discontented at [FROM.GetLeader]'s leadership and fearful of continued encroachment by [FROM.GetRulingParty] agents in local affairs, the [FROM.FROM.GetName] has expelled all [FROM.GetAdjective] representatives in an act of fierce defiance.\n\nThis has thrust [FROM.FROM.GetLeader] into a sudden position of prominence as the leader of what he hopes to be a broader coalition of those who dare to defy [FROM.GetRulingParty] authority. For now we watch from the sidelines as chaos engulfs the fledging [FROM.GetAdjective] government, but it is likely that we will soon be forced to chose as they fight for the future of the movement."
 china_events.14.a: "We must hurry to join the uprising!"
 china_events.14.b: "Remain loyal to the government."

 china_events.15.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Renounces Our Authority"
 china_events.15.d: "Perhaps it was inevitable, or perhaps this is an action of brazen selfishness, but regardless the day has come. Inspired by [FROM.FROM.FROM.GetLeader] uprising against our rule, [FROM.GetLeader] has chosen to throw his lot with the rebels. Perhaps incensed by perceived encroachment on their autonomy or maybe discontented by the continued leadership of [ROOT.GetLeader], they have found an opportunity to bring down our government from within. Either we put down these traitors immediately, or the [ROOT.GetRulingParty] dream of national unification will be dead before it could even begin."
 china_events.15.a: "There is but one thing a traitor deserves."

 china_events.16.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Joins the Rebellion"
 china_events.16.d: "Seeing an opportunity to break the shackles of [FROM.FROM.FROM.GetAdjective] oppression, the [FROM.GetRulingParty] has decided to align with us in our effort to topple [FROM.FROM.FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. [FROM.GetLeader] has sent a telegram formally placing the resources of [FROM.GetNameDef] under our control, though how much this will actually work out in practice remains to be seen. Warlords are fickle creatures, and no doubt they are wondering if we too will take a tyrannical turn.\n\nFor now however, we must focus on defeating the forces of [PREV.GetNameDef]. Our ranks now swelling in number, our chances have grown with it. However, it is unlikely that [FROM.FROM.FROM.GetLeader] will go down without a fight, and the revolt continues."

 china_central_plains_war_desc_federalist: "Although [FROM.GetNameDef] has had considerable success so far in convincing disparate warlords to join [FROM.GetLeader]'s movement, there has always been a fear that the fickle erstwhile \"allies\" of the Federalist movement would turn on them. Such fears finally came true today, with many governors rebelling against [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName].\n\nThe two sides have been trading claims of tyranny, with the rebels denouncing the central government as betraying federalist principles while the [FROM.GetRulingParty] insist that they are trying to democratise regionalist oligarchies. War is imminent, and if the Federalist ideal is to survive, their armies must move quickly."
 china_central_plains_war_desc_lkmt: "Frantic news from China has arrived that the country has seemingly fallen into another civil war. While they once proclaimed loyalty to the Kuomintang's National Government, rebellious warlords have announced their decision to cut off ties with the [CHI.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] Government - denouncing the Kuomintang's apparent authoritarianism.\n\nWhile some may consider that the Kuomintang's idea of a unitary state has led to an inevitable civil war, there can be no doubt that the NRA must act quickly in dispelling the rebels, or else the Kuomintang may very well lose their chance once more to fulfil Dr. Sun's revolution."
 china_central_plains_war_desc_rkmt: "After being repeatedly ousted by his rivals, Dr. Sun Yat-sen formed the Kuomintang along vanguardist lines, demanding personal loyalty oaths from each member. Despite this, the Kuomintang have long struggled to present a united front, even before their eternal Premier's death. The Kuomintang's rightist elements have attempted to build a unified coalition, only to see it collapse in recent days.\n\nThe central government, led by [FROM.GetLeader] has denounced the growing rebellion as the work of \"bandits\" in hopes of delegitimising the growing discontent at his authoritarian rule. As the armies prepare to clash, it appears that the Kuomintang have suffered another major blow."
 china_central_plains_war_desc_zhili: "It was supposed to be over. After the Zhili clique's stunning victory over its rivals in the 1920s, many envisioned a future built along Zhili lines. This dream was utterly shattered in 1936 with the collapse of the League, and it seems things have only gotten worse from there. [FROM.GetNameDefCap]'s attempt to pick up the pieces took a severe blow today with news of a major uprising by various regional governments.\n\nReminiscent of the National Protection War, the rebels claim to be liberating the nation from Zhili tyranny. Whether or not this is merely a front for warlord rule, and if the Zhili whether yet another storm, will be determined on the battlefield."
 china_central_plains_war_desc_manchu: "Installed in an effort to achieve international legitimacy, the Qing monarchy has not been particularly popular even after the ouster of the Zhili. Their efforts to assert control over allied factions, has triggered a new National Protection War, with rebels stoking republican sentiment against what they argue is a foreign imposed monarchy.\n\nThe [FROM.GetAdjective] leadership in turn have vowed to quash the rebellion in a national pacification campaign: the outcome will determine the fate of the troubled history of the Qing dynasty."
 china_central_plains_war_desc_fengtian: "The triumph of the [FROM.GetNameDef] has not meant the end of its troubles governing over the indomitable tempers of regionalist actors. Although [FROM.GetLeader] has successfully secured the loyalty of various regional governments through negotiations, it appears those agreements fell through today as greater integration was sought.\n\nWith multiple regions now in open rebellion, [FROM.GetAdjective] legitimacy is now in question. Propaganda, true or not, about [FROM.GetAdjective] cooperation with the Japanese and other sordid rumours have begun to spread. If this rebellion is not quashed quickly, their dreams of unifying China will soon be over."
 china_central_plains_war_desc_generic: "Although [FROM.GetNameDef] has made great strides towards unification, their initial successes in securing the loyalty of various Governors has taken a major blow in recent days. Warlords are known to be mercurial and capricious in their loyalty, and the same is likely true of their [FROM.GetRulingParty] masters in [FROM.GetNameDef].\n\nThis mutual distrust combined with [FROM.GetAdjective] efforts at asserting further control has resulted in civil war breaking out as multiple previously aligned governors have denounced the central government. As the armies march to war, citizens cower and hope to survive yet another bout of instability."

### United Front Events ###
 china_events.20.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Offers to Join the United Front"
 china_events.20.d: "We have received an offer from [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] asking to join with our recently formed united front against foreign aggression. They have offered to put aside any differences to help us in ejecting the invaders, contributing forces to the cause of national protection.\n\nThere are some concerns of course, particularly about the trustworthiness of [FROM.GetLeader] and his [FROM.GetRulingParty]. Aligning with them means tying our fates together. Coalitions such as these are unfortunately common in warlord China, and collapse just as quickly. Still, in the name of national unity, can we really say no?"
 china_events.20.d.ceasefire: "$china_events.20.d$\n\nPosing another challenge is the fact that [FROM.GetNameDef] remains at war with other factions in China. Accepting them creates the diplomatic headache of having to resolve any existing conflicts, lest we be drawn into them."
 china_events.20.a: "We welcome them into our alliance."
 china_events.20.b: "We refuse reject duplicity."

 china_events.21.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Accepts Our Entry Into the Front"
 china_events.21.d: "Seeing the pressing need for unity in face of foreign aggression, [FROM.GetLeader] has personally messaged [ROOT.GetLeader] to welcome us into the Chinese United Front. Our combined armies are bound to pose a major threat against those that would invade China, however it is doubtful that such a coalition can last for long. There is little time to think about that now however, as we march onwards against the invaders!"
 china_events.21.a: "Comrades to victory!"

 china_events.22.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Rejects Our Entry Into the Front"
 china_events.22.d: "Despite our ernest efforts at promoting national unity, we have been harshly rebuffed by [FROM.GetNameDef]. It appears they do not trust us, as [FROM.GetLeader] jealously guards his power over the coalition. This sort of treasonous behavior is not uncommon in China, and may very well spell the doom of the nation as it is invaded by outside forces. In the mean time, we will simply have to manage on our own."
 china_events.22.a: "Fools and traitors."

 china_events.23.t: "The End of the Chinese United Front"
 china_events.23.d: "Now that enemy invasion has come to a close, it appears that there is little need for a Chinese United Front. Already the various warlords have begun refusing central government commands, and distancing themselves from [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. It seems that things will go back to the way they were as various factions press their claims for national leadership.\n\nStill, we demonstrated in this last war that we can lead China. That we can protect it from enemy invasion, and disunity is not inherent but an illness caused by regionalist selfishness. May the people remember us and our accomplishments across the nation, and we will soon united with them once again."
 china_events.23.a: "Blessed victory."

 china_events.24.t: "The United Front Disbands"
 china_events.24.d: "Now that enemy invasion has come to a close, it appears that there is little need for a Chinese United Front. The unity that such a front provided was useful for a time, however the divisions within the front are simply too much to last. We now must go our own way, though the goodwill and patriotic fervour we have gained from our participation will likely stay with us for years to come. As one China fended off foreign invasion. And that will go down in the history books forever."
 china_events.24.a: "It was nice while it lasted."

 china_events.25.t: "United Front Formed"
 china_events.25.d: "In face of foreign threats, various policymakers, patriots, and intellectuals have proposed the warring Chinese factions come together into one Chinese United Front in the name of common national security. We, as a Chinese state, have been included in such discussions, and there are many within the [ROOT.GetRulingParty] that have petitioned [ROOT.GetLeader] to move towards this alliance. Although it cannot possibly last forever, it is the patriotic duty of all Chinese to defend the nation for enemy aggression."
 china_events.25.a: "We weigh our options."

 china_events.26.t: "The Chinese United Front"
 china_events.26.d: "[ROOT.china_united_front_desc]"
 china_events.26.a: "[ROOT.china_united_front_option]"
 china_united_front_desc_front_leader: "In face of foreign aggression, we have achieved a prominence that we have long sought as the effective leader of China. [ROOT.GetLeader] has delivered a speech today in [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] formally announcing the creation a Chinese United Front, and calling for all China to rally to the national cause.\n\nThe war ahead is not expected to be easy by any means, and the coalition we assembled will likely be unwieldy. Nonetheless, our strength has been buttressed by the joint might of various warlord armies, and our odds considerably improved as a result. Under the shadow of war, China girds itself for a prolonged conflict against those who would subjugate it."
 china_united_front_desc_front_member: "In face of foreign aggression, we and many others have banded together to face off against the invaders in a Chinese United Front. A shared government, mostly on paper, has been established to coordinate activities, one of which we have taken an active interest in.\n\nThe war ahead is not expected to be easy, but united China is still a power to behold. With millions of patriots prepared to fight and die against foreign oppression, and with considerable battlefield experience shared across its members, we must push the enemy out of Chinese lands. For the sake of the nation, its people, and its future, there can be no surrender!"
 china_united_front_desc_possible_front_member: "Assembling various factions within China together, the Chinese United Front has formed to oppose foreign aggression and coordinate a defence against enemy invasion. Although [ROOT.GetLeader] and his staff are still mulling whether or not to join, that has not stopped others from going forward in creating this alliance.\n\nWe have experienced pressure internally, even within the [ROOT.GetRulingParty], to participate in this defence of the homeland, though the risks remain evident. United, China can pose a major threat, however victory is far from assured. And the future of the front is not certain either - what will happen after a victory remains an open question."
 china_united_front_desc_enemy: "Various Chinese forces, in a desperate effort to deny us our rightful demands, have come together to form a so-called \"Chinese United Front\". Unifying disparate warlord factions into one supposedly joint alliance and government, they have vowed to force us to retreat, utilising every resource and ounce of Chinese patriotism left in such a divided nation.\n\nWhile it is unlikely such an unwieldy alliance can truly stand up to our forces, this sudden Chinese unity is cause for some concern. We must take care to adequately adjust to such battlefield changes, and possibly expand the scope of our campaign objectives as well."
 china_united_front_desc_neutral: "Faced with foreign invasion, various Chinese factions have agreed to cooperate in a \"Chinese United Front\". Ostensibly with a unified command structure and government, experts warn that in practice regional autonomy will remain the same and coordination will probably be lacking.\n\nStill, this sudden unity against aggression has caused an outburst of patriotism in cities across the nation. Whatever doubts exist about the sincerity of the participants or the odds of victory have largely remained invisible, as the Chinese nation mobilises for war. It appears that the idea of a united China is far from dead, though the outcome of the war may very well change that."
 china_united_front_option_front_leader: "We shall lead our people to victory!"
 china_united_front_option_front_member: "Let us drive out the imperialists together!"
 china_united_front_option_possible_front_member: "A decision must be made soon..."
 china_united_front_option_enemy: "Let's see how united they truly are!"
 china_united_front_option_neutral: "The Chinese tiger roars."

 china_events.27.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Demands a Ceasefire for Unity"
 china_events.27.d: "Citing our current conflict within the nation and the need for unity in face of foreign threat, representatives from [FROM.GetNameDef] have insisted that we sign an immediate ceasefire, allowing the winning side in our conflict to set limited terms. Under normal circumstances, ending a conflict such as this and giving our enemies a respite is only a recipe for disaster, though the alternative in this case does not seem to be much better.\n\nRefusing would mean being seen as a collaborator with foreign aggressors in a time where patriotic fervour is at an all-time high, and we will attract scorn from the gathering Chinese alliance to resist foreign invasion. We may very well end up facing down the entire united front in the looming conflict if we do not take similar steps towards peace, a proposition far greater in scope that we initially bargained for."
 china_events.27.a: "We reluctantly accept."
 china_events.27.b: "We stubbornly refuse."

 china_events.28.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Accepts Ceasefire"
 china_events.28.d: "Agreeing with the need for national unity in these dire times, [FROM.GetLeader] has agreed to sign a ceasefire with representatives of our United Front. For the most part, forces have withdrawn to status quo positions, which may cause friction but in the grand scheme of things has been peaceful. We are very fortunate that [FROM.GetAdjective] have seen reason in this time of peril."
 china_events.28.a: "This is...acceptable."

 china_events.29.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Refuses Ceasefire"
 china_events.29.d: "Despite the clear national emergency that the nation faces, [FROM.GetLeader] has stubbornly refused to sign any ceasefire and end their present conflict within the Chinese nation. As a result, they have effectively thrown in their lot with the enemy, and become co-belligerents with the invader. We therefore have little choice but to fight them too, casting out yet another group of selfish traitors that taint the nation's integrity. Although our enemies continue to grow, we expect many await within [FROM.GetAdjective] borders for national liberation."
 china_events.29.a: "Despicable Hanjian!"

### Army Reform Events ###
 china_events.40.t.first_step: "The [ROOT.GetAdjective] Military Reforms"
 china_events.40.d.first_step: "The first steps to reforming our military is underway, with the creation of a centralised bureaucracy to coordinate logistics, supply, and payments. A commission to handle this project was established, with trusted men supposedly hand-picked by [ROOT.GetLeader] taking on this task with stride. This lays the foundation for future army reforms, critical for bringing our forces to the modern era of war."
 china_events.40.t.second_step: "Military Reforms March Onwards!"
 china_events.40.d.second_step: "Having taken our first steps towards improving the quality of our army, further initiatives soon followed. Localised units have been broken up and redistributed, with some officers outright expelled for corruption. Training similarly has been revamped from the ground up to bringing our forces up to speed with modern techniques.\n\nThere has been plenty of grumbling from members of the old guard, particularly those who have benefited from the regional nature of our old forces. However, this patchwork model, while sometimes more effective in the early days of the warlord era, has no place in the future of our military."
 china_events.40.t.third_step_officers: "A Breath of Fresh Air in the [ROOT.GetAdjective] Army"
 china_events.40.d.third_step_officers: "After considerable effort, our military has been thoroughly reformed. Having successfully reformed the core components of our military, the difficult work of integrating the allied and auxiliary units that we have inherited from times past, began.\n\nOur high command is pleased to report their efforts across the last few months as a success. Although there remain issues with ghost soldiers, corrupt payrolls and desertion, there is little doubt that we have come a long way."
 china_events.40.t.third_step_finished: "A New Day for the [ROOT.GetAdjective] Military"
 china_events.40.d.third_step_finished: "After considerable effort, the core components of our military has been thoroughly reformed. Gone are the ghost soldiers, the desertion, the looting, the semi-feudal structure. In its place is a new, professional force, comparable with that of Europe and Japan. Now, they are ready to enforce Chinese unification and possibly beyond, an army truly to be reckoned with!"
 china_events.40.a: "Our armies triumph even off the battlefield!"

 china_events.41.t.army_reform_ongoing: "Cleaning House and Catching Thieves"
 china_events.41.d.army_reform_ongoing: "China's military has taken a severe dive in quality over the last few years, despite the abundance of veteran officers produced by the warlord era. Many have achieved their ranks through nepotism, corruption, or favouritism, while others (even competent ones) exploit their power for their own ends.\n\nOur efforts have involved cleaning up the ghost rosters, stopping desertion, and eliminating patronage - increasing accountability within our ranks. A new batch of officers have been trained to this end, instilled with patriotic spirit and hopefully less beholden to corruption that the previous generations."
 china_events.41.t.army_reform_finished: "A New Day for the [ROOT.GetAdjective] Military"
 china_events.41.d.army_reform_finished: "$china_events.41.d.army_reform_ongoing$\n\nThese officers join an army thoroughly reformed from the inside outwards, ready to liberate their nation. Through our efforts, they have a become a professional force, comparable with that of Europe and Japan. May they ensure China will never be divided or humiliated ever again!"
 china_events.41.a: "A new generation of officers for a new China."

### Capital Event ###
 china_events.50.t: "The New Capital"
 china_events.50.d: "With the unification of China, it is finally time to set the permanent seat of the new central government. Beijing would be the natural choice, an ancient city that has been capital of Chinese governments consistently for the past centuries under the Yuan. A strong contender, it would represent a natural, stable transition from the old. This however also works against it, being strongly associated with the Monarchy and the failed Beiyang government. To a lesser extent, it emphasises a certain northern political dominance in national politics.\n\nNanjing is another potential choice, sitting closer to centre of China, between the Yangtze and Yellow rivers. Nanjing was a capital of the Ming Dynasty, the provisional capital of the First Republic before Yuan Shikai's usurpation, and has significant value among nationalists and republicans.\n\nSimilarly, Wuhan, located further in-land, was the site of the Wuchang uprising, the epicentre of the Xinhai Revolution that first toppled the Qing monarchy. Its symbolism has made it a popular choice for revolutionaries who seek a firm break from the old order.\n\nGuangzhou, a controversial choice, has also been thrown into the mix. The economic centre of the South and a major port city, it has been the traditional hotbed for republican revolutionary movements. Both the Kuomintang and the Federalists movement trace their roots here, and many of their leading officers grew up or were trained in the city since the start of the Constitutional Protection movement.\n\nOther cities have been considered, however as discussions draw to a close it seems the list has been quickly narrowed. After further deliberation, [ROOT.GetAdjective] authorities have settled on..."

### Becomes Most Legitimate Tooltip
 china_events.51.t: "[ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]'s Growing Renown"
 china_events.51.d: "With the recent demise of our strongest rival, most observers have shifted their attention to [ROOT.GetLeader] and the [ROOT.GetRulingParty] as the most likely candidate to unite China under their banner. Foreign embassies have begun the process of switching recognition from our predecessor to our government, and our foreign ministry is confident we will soon achieve widespread international recognition. Domestically, our legitimacy has been raised, which opens up our path to uniting the country.\n\nThis is a precarious position of course, as the revolving door of Beiyang and Guangzhou leadership has shown. Being the strongest often makes one a target, not only from rival warlord cliques but also for creditors who often seek payment for long-past due loans of prior Chinese governments. It also attracts jealousy and ambition from within our own camp, as the unifying force of external threats recede. [ROOT.GetLeader] would be well advised to know our triumph is hardly assured. Still, victory is well within our reach, if only we would take it. Then comes the hard part..."
 china_events.51.a: "Now who dares still stand in our way?"

### Demanding Cities ###
 china_events.60.t: "The Central Government Demands Beijing"
 china_events.60.d: "The victory of our revolutionary coalition has successfully toppled our rivals in the region. Having proudly served the national cause, our administrators have begun the vital process of restoring order in Beijing. The city, literally translated \"Northern Capital\", has played a pivotal role in Chinese history. It has long served as the capital of the nation and its capture has conferred significant amounts of legitimacy to both [FROM.GetNameDef] and to [ROOT.GetLeader] as well.\n\nOur allies seems to have recognised this fact and grown suspicious of our intentions. The press in [FROM.capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] have noticeably stopped printing mentions of [ROOT.GetLeader] or [ROOT.GetRulingParty], an early sign of their displeasure. They have also dispatched several representatives of their own in a not-so-subtle attempt to wrest control of regional administration from our own appointed leadership.\n\nPushing is coming to shove, and finally we have received a private call from [FROM.GetLeader] himself demanding we hand over the jurisdiction of Beijing to the central government of the Republic for direct administration. This encroachment on local autonomy is a grave threat to our authority but it seems they have no intentions of backing down from this confrontation. Accepting would be the noble action, though perhaps dooming us to permanent subordination. Still, a certain ambition flickers in [ROOT.GetLeader]'s eyes. This would hardly be the first time a revolutionary alliance collapsed over the eminent city."
 china_events.60.a: "So be it, we yield."
 china_events.60.b: "Our autonomy will not be infringed!"

 china_events.61.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Yields Beijing"
 china_events.61.d: "Bowing under increased central government pressure, [FROM.GetLeader] and the [FROM.GetName] has agreed to turn over jurisdiction of Beijing and the surrounding areas to the central government. A large delegation of officials arrived earlier today at Zhengyangmen station to take up their posts in the city, though this is mostly a formality. Preceding them were various central army officers and other representatives that worked to ensure a smooth and peaceful handover. With the old capital finally under our control and a potential rival humbled, we can at last begin preparations for our next steps in national unification."
 china_events.61.a: "As it should be."

While we certainly view these lands as integral to the Chinese nation, perhaps we can see their point and respect their autonomy under our influence.

 china_events.104.d: "In the negotiations with [FROM.GetNameDef], the Chinese government has agreed to offer our government and nation autonomy provided that we cede territory that they declare are Han-dominated. While these regions are explicitly ours, pacifist members of our government have urged our leadership to accept these demands in order to avoid bloodshed. Even if we lose land to the Chinese, at least our core territory and people will be allowed to enjoy the benefits of independence far away from Chinese rule. Nationalists within our government have denounced this idea, claiming that we should be treated as equals at the negotiation table and that the Chinese demand for some of our territory will eventually end with all of our territories lost."

Perhaps seeing the hopelessness of their position, they have agreed to cede all lands inhabited by the Han in exchange for their autonomy under our sphere. We shall accept their proposal and surrender, but this incident has shown that we are now fully capable of projecting our power and strength in Asia."

Stubbornly refusing to cede any [FROM.GetAdjective] territory, even those with a Han majority, they have stuck to the original terms they have offered which is to remain autonomous within our sphere of influence. That would be the path of least resistance, though will likely cause lingering issues in our partnership for years to come. Some can only wonder if they have the truly have the leverage to demand such conditions."

In exchange, they ask that we shall drop all claims on their core territory and respect and recognise their national sovereignty. While some moderates have advocated this approach, the nationalists of our country have argued that these territories are integral Chinese lands and that if lost, they may be used by foreign powers against us. Instead, they have petitioned our government to take a more aggressive stance to resolve the crisis."

In exchange, they have agreed to all claims on their core territory and respect and recognise their national sovereignty. While pacifists and moderates have applauded this move, there are also those within our government who have advocated rejecting this proposal as one demand for land might lead to another in the future.

In a tremendous show of weakness and duplicity, [FROM.GetLeader] has informed us that we cannot expect the assistance of [FROM.GetFactionName] in the event of a conflict.\n\nThis puts us in a weakened position. If we press to continue protecting our allies, we will be forced to sacrifice our ties with [FROM.GetFactionName], leaving us ourselves vulnerable.

### Autonomous Region Events ###
 china_events.150.t: "Establishing a Mongolian Administration"
 china_events.150.d: "Across the 17th and 18th Century, Mongolia was slowly absorbed into the Qing Empire. This Manchu dynasty had previously good relationships with Mongolian clans and utilised their Mongolian subjects to great effect as cavalrymen, however the Qing dynasty's efforts to subjugate the Mongolians and implement their banner system was met with resistance. The 18th Century saw famine and a large migration of Han Chinese into the region that became known as \"Inner Mongolia\", the decline of Mongolian nomadism, and Sinicization of the Qing court. Qing governance over Mongolia relied on military governors to watch over the various Mongolian Leagues (six in Inner Mongolia and four in Outer Mongolia), with the Outer Mongolian Leagues enjoying greater autonomy.\n\nAmid the turmoil of the 1911 Xinhai Revolution, Bogd Khan was enthroned and led a revolt that expelled Chinese officials from Outer Mongolia. The new Republic sought to reassert control over Mongolia as well as Tibet (which signed a mutual recognition treaty with Mongolia), deploying forces that were briefly able to take control of Urga (their capital and only permanent city). However, troops led by Baron von Ungern-Sternberg were able to eject Chinese troops, allowing the Mongolians to secure de facto independence even as the Chinese continued to claim the territory.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Baron's fall and our return to Mongolia, we inherit a divided and devastated Mongolia. Local leaders have petitioned for greater autonomy similar to the policies previously implemented by warlord forces in Inner Mongolia. They worry that further Han migration, which tends to favour settled farmers, would compete with Mongolian herders for grazing land and political influence. Some officials however argue for a direct administration to elevate the deeply impoverished province's economic conditions and stamp out secessionist efforts."
 china_events.150.a: "Authorise the creation of an Outer Mongolian Autonomous Region only."
 china_events.150.b: "Establish both an Inner and Outer Mongolian Autonomous Region."
 china_events.150.c: "Mongolia shall be reorganised into ordinary provinces."

 china_events.151.t: "Establishing a Xinjiang Administration"
 china_events.151.d: "Xinjiang has had a long and tumultuous history and Chinese military presence there began in the Han dynasty with garrisons deployed to protect trade interests along the valuable Silk Road. Control over the region frequently shifted as successive dynasties had varying degrees of fortune keeping the distant land under their control. The Qing dynasty wrested control of Xinjiang and Tibet from the Dzungars across the 17th and 18th Century in a devastating war of conquest. They also encouraged Han, Hui, and Manchu migration to supplement their control along with their garrison, a tactic used in previous dynasties such as the Tang. Xinjiang, then known as Chinese Turkestan, was converted into a province and given its present name, which translates to New Frontier.\n\nThe 1911 Xinhai Revolution saw the collapse of Qing authority and the assumption of Han Governor Yang Zengxin to power. A multi-ethnic region, Xinjiang has been plagued by instability and unrest, particularly by Kumul Khanate loyalists in the north and East Turkestan separatists in the south. The travel distance from Beijing to Dihua (the provincial capital) is said to take longer than travelling from Moscow to Vladivostok, which has created a degree of isolation - further worsened by regionalist tendencies of the Governors and the disruption of the warlord era.\n\nNevertheless, we have successfully brought Xinjiang under our heel, developing a plan for long-term governance is a must if we are to stabilise our rule. Xinjiang is home to many ethnic groups, including Uyghurs, Han, Kazakhs, Hui, Kirghiz, and Mongolians and there has been a call by local leaders to establish an autonomous zone to ensure the rights of local minorities. However, there has also been considerable resistance to the idea - unlike Tibet or Mongolia, Xinjiang has been ruled as a province for decades now."
 china_events.151.a: "Authorise the creation of a Xinjiang Autonomous Region."
 china_events.151.b: "Xinjiang shall remain a province."

 china_events.152.t: "Establishing a Tibetan Administration"
 china_events.152.d: "The history of Chinese rule over Tibet is a long and complicated one. The Qing Dynasty first asserted direct control over the region when their soldiers aided the 7th Dalai Lama in expelling the Dzungar Khanate, appointing their own administrators known as Ambans to the region. Tibet became a \"Fanbu\" to the Qing, translated loosely as a vassal state. As Qing power waned, their ability to directly control Tibet was challenged both by Tibetan leaders and the British operating from India. After the British invasion of Tibet, the Qing made an effort to reassert their sovereignty over the region, sending an army to integrate Tibet by force while also securing British recognition of Chinese suzerainty.\n\nThe 1911 Xinhai Revolution saw Qing rule collapse and the Tibetans had their revenge on the Chinese garrison by slaying their commander and forcing the survivors to withdraw. The new Republic maintained its claims on Tibet and attempted to secure the Dalai Lama's submission, however the 13th Dalai Lama argued that previous Chinese rule had not been subordination but rather a patron and priest relationship. The Lhasa government declared its independence along with the newly freed Mongolia. The British attempted to broker a deal similar to that of inner/outer Mongolia, with inner Tibet receiving autonomy under Chinese suzerainty while outer Tibet would be divided by Chinese administration and Tibetan religious authority. This convention broke down due to disputes over boundaries, further complicated by the status of contest Tawang and the Indian revolution.\n\nOur forces have successfully invaded Tibet, once again reasserting Chinese control over Lhasa. The death of the 13th Dalai Lama in 1933 upended the Tibetan political arena, leaving several competing factions that range from traditionalists in the monasteries and aristocracy to Khamba revolutionaries to court reformers. Within our own government, there have been calls to directly govern Tibet as a province to stamp out separatism, while others have advised providing autonomy to secure the loyalty of local allies."
 china_events.152.a: "Authorise the creation of an \"Outer\" Tibet Autonomous Region only."
 china_events.152.b: "The Tibet Autonomous Region should be expanded to include \"Inner Tibet\"."
 china_events.152.c: "Tibet shall be administered as a province."

Now the matter is deadly serious. The Chinese could simply walk into any of our concessions virtually unopposed, leaving us with the unenviable task of recovering them, and then subduing the Chinese nation as a whole. However, China's last century of martial tradition is spotty at best, and our own troops are no doubt the pride of [ROOT.GetNameDef]."

Faced with failure after failure, the Mandate of Heaven, which had ruled the Chinese people for so long, seemed to draw the imperial system to an end finally.\n\nSince the end of the Weltkrieg, the political situation in China has changed dramatically with the Xuantong Restoration. Despite being allied with the Zhili Clique, Chinese royalists have successfully brought the Qing Dynasty to a complete restoration in the past years. Now from [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], Emperor [ROOT.GetLeader] has officially proclaimed that with China's recent unification, the Great Qing will seek to reassert China's cultural and political superiority in East Asia."

 china_events.301.t: "Victory of the Zhili Clique"
 china_events.301.d: "Despite having their rule and control of China adequately challenged in the Northern Expedition, the subsequent Xuantong Restoration restored the Qing Empire and saw control of the North solidified by Wu Peifu, Cao Kun and the Zhili Clique.\n\nDespite the past years' unrest with the economic collapse of Black Monday and the League War, nonetheless, the Zhili have held on through the storm. While other warlords attempted to split from Zhili control, the Zhili nevertheless have defeated all competing governments, thus unifying China once more. In a glorious speech at [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], Wu Peifu has declared that Zhili will seek to modernise China and assert her influence in the world once more."

Nonetheless, following a failed coup by the Manchu loyalists during the League Collapse, the Zhili leadership declared the return of the Beiyang Republic.\n\nWith the re-adoption of a Republican Constitution and the recent election of President [ROOT.GetLeader], the Zhili-led Republic seeks to continue on the legacy of the Xinhai Revolution. Only time will tell whether or not the Zhili will successfully continue their transition from a warlordist clique to a formal Republic - but their unification of the country shows they are perhaps the most capable of doing so."

His proclamation, made just inside the Nanjing Presidential Palace's Main Hall, is rife with symbolism - it was where Dr. Sun Yat-sen was declared provisional president of the first Chinese Republic in 1912.\n\nThough the Nationalists have long held a foothold in the region, they were dismissed as a fleeting insurgency. Their final triumph over rival contenders has secured begrudging international recognition as the left wing of the Kuomintang aims to establish a single-party socialist state that will eliminate the chaos and allow for a just and democratic civil society to safely form under their tutelage."

 china_events.308.b: "The Chinese Revolution has arrived."
 china_events.308.c: "We must stop the Kuomintang threat!"

 china_events.309.t: "Proclamation of the Republic of China"
 china_events.309.d: "News from China has been chaotic recently, as rapid warfare for control over China seems to be coming to a close. The right wing of the Kuomintang under [FROM.GetLeader] has achieved supremacy throughout China, and has declared the unification of the Republic of China under the flag of the Blue Sky, White Sun and Wholly Red Earth.\n\nFollowing in the ideals of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, Generalissimo [FROM.GetLeader] has promised the Chinese people and the world that this is a new era for China, promising to reverse the humiliation of European powers and the guiding of the nation to greatness. Only time shall tell what the Kuomintang shall achieve."
 china_events.309.a: "The Kuomintang has done it at last."

 china_events.310.t: "Proclamation of the United Provinces of China"
 china_events.310.d: "With China largely under the control of [FROM.GetLeader]'s National Defence Army, a new Republic has been proclaimed in Beijing as Federalist troops parade through Tiananmen Square. The United Provinces of China, as often called in the West, has completely replaced the previous internationally-recognised Chinese government and with their power secured, it is only a matter of time before the international community recognises it.\n\nThe Federalist Government intends to organise a \"National Conference\" consisting of deputies from all liberated provinces to draft a new constitution and form an official provisional government until national elections can be called at the earliest convenience."
 china_events.310.a: "Long live Chen and the Republic!"
 china_events.310.b: "Will they truly bring democracy in China?"

 china_events.311.t: "The Zhili Unify China Against the Odds"
 china_events.311.d: "Since the Northern Expedition, there has been no greater crisis for the Zhili Clique than the successful coup of Manchu loyalists - that saw the deaths of Cao Kun and Wu Peifu. Driven out of Zhili Province in the coup's aftermath, the remnants of the Zhili Clique fled for their aligned province of Sichuan - where they declared a rival government to the Manchu Government.\n\nEmerging out of the famine-stricken province, the Zhili defeated all competing national governments and returned home to their native province by victory of arms. With the Manchu threat finally defeated, [ROOT.GetLeader] has declared that under the Zhili Clique, the Republic of China is hereafter to be revived. Only time will tell whether the Zhili will succeed in their new battle to win the hearts of the masses."
 china_events.311.a: "The Zhili have shown that they cannot be defeated."

 china_events.312.t: "The Federalist Movement in Sichuan is Victorious"
 china_events.312.d: "To many in China, the Federalist movement seemed destined for failure as the Federalist movement has been expelled twice now in recent history from their home province of Guangzhou. Driven once more into exile, Chen Jiongming found a haven under the Sichuanese provincial government.\n\nFrom Sichuan, the Federalists have managed to defeat all competing and rival governments successfully. Their rule solidified, the Federalists have officially proclaimed the first year of the United Provinces of China under the leadership of the Zhi-Gong Party. The new government intends to organise a \"National Conference\" consisting of deputies from all provinces to draft a new constitution prepare the nation for elections."
 china_events.312.a: "Will they bring true democracy to China?"

 china_events.313.t: "General Liu Xiang declares National Reunification"
 china_events.313.d: "The poor western province of Sichuan is known for its competing warlord factions and cliques, tearing the province apart in a civil war before a deadly famine consumed it. In this chaotic period of Sichuanese politics, General Liu Xiang of the Industrial Corps managed to outmanoeuvre his opponents and unify his province under his leadership.\n\nDenouncing the leadership of the Central Government, the General took the province of Sichuan on a path of war, with his provincial army waging war and defeating rival competing governments. With his recent victories and crushing of dissenters, he has declared himself the President of a revived Republic of China. Only time will tell whether or not the General's regime and legacy will be lasting."
 china_events.313.a: "The Sichuan Clique has answered the call to unification!"

 china_events.314.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] complete Chinese Unification"
 china_events.314.d: "In the era of constant warfare and strife in the ever-changing political landscape, it is not surprising to see smaller cliques and provinces move beyond their borders to seek power and glory. Surprising many, [FROM.GetNameDef] has emerged out of their province to defeat rival competing governments and has proclaimed the Republic of China from their capital of [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName].\n\nThe country of China long divided, has finally been reunified once more under the leadership of [ROOT.GetLeader]. Only time will tell whether or not China will catch up to the rest of the world, but for now, the Chinese people can finally rest, knowing that the chaotic Warlord Period has come to an end."
 china_events.314.a: "The Chinese people have stood up at last!"

 china_events.315.t: "Unification by the League Marshal"
 china_events.315.d: "Who would've thought that the kleptocratic miasma of the League of Eight Provinces would weather the storm? With the League Collapse in 1936 having undeniably torn down its rotten structure in one fell swoop, few believed it would ever again reach the zenith of its power that it had in 1929. And yet here it has far surpassed that of the old League, trumping expectations.\n\nIt would not be Sun Chuanfang that would unite the nation under the Southern Zhili Clique, but that of Qi Xieyuan. A detested subordinate of the Smiling Tiger, he controversially took the reigns following the former's incapacitation. Pursuing an open-door policy, it would appear that the Germans have earned an erstwhile ally in the East. Although many fear another League Collapse in the future."
 china_events.315.a: "A bastard's reign, exported nationally."

 china_events.340.t: "Chairman Wang Holds On"
 china_events.340.d: "Despite leading the Kuomintang from exile and near destruction to resounding national successes with the completion of the Second Northern Expedition, Chairman [CHI.GetLeader]'s rule seemed to fall apart with the growing factional opposition from the Kuomintang's Provisional Action Committee. Despite attacks on all sides however, it appears that the Chairman has indeed solidified his control and rule of the Party, effectively crushing the opposition.\n\nNow, for the first time in decades, peace has finally returned to China and Chairman Wang will seek to modernise and revive the Chinese country in order to fulfil the principles outlined by his mentor, the late Dr. Sun Yat-sen, for years to come."
 china_events.340.a: "Wang Jingwei is truly the heir to Dr. Sun's Revolution."

 china_events.341.t: "Song's PAC Secures Leadership of the KMT"
 china_events.341.d: "While the Kuomintang was nominally led by Wang Jingwei during the party's exile period following the Northern Expedition, those who remained in China organised themselves as the autonomous MinGan Insurgency government. This was the foundation on which the Provisional Action Committee (PAC) of the Kuomintang was formed, and in their 1932 Declaration to the Revolutionary People in China and the World, they announced a populist, socialist platform seemingly closer to the people.\n\nYears later, Chairwoman [CHI.GetLeader] has declared the transition of the PAC into a new Revolutionary Committee to lead the common masses towards the eradication of class and towards a new revolutionary future for the peasants and workers of China."
 china_events.341.a: "The people have stood up!"

 china_events.342.t: "The Reorganisation Faction Takes Over the KMT"
 china_events.342.d: "While the Kuomintang succeeded in unifying the country under their party flag, the Party descended into civil war following the assassination and death of its former Chairman, Wang Jingwei. The party then splintered into multiple factions as the country once again collapsed into another great civil war.\n\nIt would appear that from his government in Beiping, Chairman Zeng Zhongming and Premier Chen Gongbo, along with the Reorganised Comrades Association, have proclaimed victory against all the other factions. Now that the Reorganisation Faction maintains total control of both the country and the Party, foreign observers believe that China will head towards an authoritarian socialist future, one driven by some of China's most radical socialists."
 china_events.342.a: "A New China has arisen..."

 china_events.343.t: "The China Revival Society Declare Victory"
 china_events.343.d: "While the Kuomintang succeeded in unifying the country under their party flag, the Party descended into civil war following the assassination and death of its former Chairman, Wang Jingwei. As squabbling factional forces began to fight one another, the radical China Revival Society managed to seize power and secure the country in a state of an emergency.\n\nIn a grand speech from [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], Generalissmo Hu Zongnan has declared that all enemies of China, both foreign and domestic, shall be crushed under a new direction of the national revolution. The CRS' talk of a totalitarian revolution inspired by the likes of Savinkov, Mussolini, and Mosley shall surely dim a light on any chances of democracy in China."
 china_events.343.a: "Darkness has befallen the National Revolution."

# Faction Joining Events
 china_events.401.t: "China seeks to join the Internationale"
 china_events.401.d: "Our relationship with the Chinese Kuomintang goes back to the 1924 Reorganisation of their party when we approached the late Dr. Sun Yat-sen to work with the KMT, as we see the Kuomintang movement as the only one in which a socialist China can emerge. We helped train their revolutionary army at Whampoa and most of all, we took in the Kuomintang exiles such as Wang Jingwei following the collapse of the First Northern Expedition.\n\nNow many years later, our investment in the Kuomintang has bore fruit as the Kuomintang has succeeded in unifying China under the socialist creed and has now approached us to join the Internationale. Citing their commitment to help others secure liberation in the world revolution as well as their desire to help us oversee the destruction of the German world order, they have asked to formally be invited to the Third Internationale. While we are more than happy to accept cooperation with our Chinese comrades, a minority within our  government who are suspicious of the Kuomintang's \"Party State\" ideals and have warned against working with them."
 china_events.401.a: "Together we shall free the world!"
 china_events.401.b: "They are far too unorthodox for our taste."

 china_events.402.t: "China Joins the Internationale!"
 china_events.402.d: "Our application to join the Internationale has proven to be a success! For years, we have owed much to the Third Internationale for their support, recognition, and aid in helping organise and funding the Kuomintang so that we may liberate China from the warlords and imperialists that oppressed our dear country. With our revolution finally successful, it is due time that we repay years of support to the Internationale and aid in the world revolution against the capitalist and imperialist world order of [GER.GetNameDef]. Together, the Internationale shall unite the human race and we will strive forward for mankind's socialist progress forevermore!"
 china_events.402.a: "Together we complete the world revolution!"

 china_events.403.t: "Our Application Denied."
 china_events.403.d: "Despite our desire to cooperate with the Third Internationale, unfortunately - they have denied our application to join their global revolution. Citing our ideological differences from orthodox syndicalism amongst other differences, the Internationale has formally rejected our application to join them. While this is certainly frustrating given our once close relationship with the Third Internationale, it proves to many of us that no matter what ideology - the West merely seeks to work with China for its own benefit and does not really seek to establish an equal relationship. Whether capitalist or socialist, it is quite clear to us that the West is still guided by the mindset of imperialism."
 china_events.403.a: "Imperialists can never change their stripes."

 china_events.404.t: "China seeks to join the Reichspakt"
 china_events.404.d: "Ever since we intervened in favour of the Beijing Government during the KMT's doomed Northern Expedition, we have held close ties with China both diplomatically and economically. Although at times fragile, especially during the anti-concessionist rebellion that nearly destroyed the our ally's rule over China, they have, thanks to our help, overcome this struggle and united China for good.\n\nNow, seeking deeper co-operation, the Chinese ambassador has requested for China to formally join our military alliance. While it could prove beneficial for both parties, we are aware how such closer ties could jeopardise the security of our investments as China would be pulled into any war Germany is in. However, at the same time it could give us the opportunity to better defend our interest in the event of a outside attack against China."
 china_events.404.a: "A military alliance will secure our investments."
 china_events.404.b: "We can not ruin our investments by allying them."

 china_events.405.t: "China Joins the Reichspakt!"
 china_events.405.d: "Today, the [ROOT.getAdjective] ambassador in Berlin has wired the German response regarding [ROOT.getNameDef]'s bid to join the Reichspakt. The many years of military co-operation and economic concessions with the Germans have bore fruit - China is finally formally accepted into a military alliance with Germany.\n\nFor the government in [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] today marks a turning point in history. The military alliance is a major step towards the Western powers accepting China as an equal partner and thus a major step towards ending the Century of Humiliation."
 china_events.405.a: "German and Chinese soldiers march side by side."

 china_events.406.t: "Our Application Denied."
 china_events.406.d: "Despite having compromised and conceded to the Germans for years, the government in Berlin has today denied the [ROOT.GetAdjective] request to join the Reichspakt. They cite concerns regarding the safety of German investments and preference of an ambiguous security relationship.\n\nIn response, our government has condemned Germany for its imperialist attitude towards China saying that it was a huge blow to the Chinese people and government. Still, in a separate statement they affirmed to continue strong ties to Germany despite the recent events."
 china_events.406.a: "After all these years they still treat us like chess pieces!"

 china_events.407.t: "China seeks to join the Moscow Accord"
 china_events.407.d: "The recent decades saw China plunged into endless civil war, with the lion's share going to the Qing Government in Beijing and the Japanese backed Fengtian Clique holding out in their fortress of Manchuria. During this time, our influence was relegated to purely the outskirts of China, with only some amenable forces in Mongolia and Xinjiang willing to combat German and Japanese imperial domination in the region. Thankfully, when Qing hegemony collapsed, a friendly government was able to establish complete control over China. With their internal situation stabilised, the new Chinese government hopes to secure itself from a resurgent Japan or renewed German aggression via formally joining our military alliance. While this would be a mutually beneficial arrangement, there are some who view a Sino-Russian alliance as contradictory to our far eastern interests, and the Chinese may prove to be something of a burden."
 china_events.407.a: "Russia and China, good friends!"
 china_events.407.b: "The fate of Eurasia belongs to Russia and Russia alone."

 china_events.408.t: "China joins the Moscow Accord!"
 china_events.408.d: "The Russians have responded to our ambassador in Moscow, welcoming us formally into the Moscow Accord. This is a great triumph for the Chinese nation, for one of the world's great powers has recognised us on equal grounds, and perhaps the Century of Humiliation is finally behind us. Of course, there remain other powers who would not hesitate to return us to the crippled state we were in just a few years ago, and we must continue marching forward and take our rightful place as the great power of East Asia, and deny continued German and Japanese aggression against us and the rest of Asia."
 china_events.408.a: "Russia and China united against imperialism!"

 china_events.409.t: "Our Application Denied"
 china_events.409.d: "The Russians have responded to our ambassador in Moscow, turning our formal application down on the grounds of conflicting interests. While the Russians denied our application, they still affirmed the continuation of good relations between our two nations. Regardless, this is a great blow to our aspirations to negotiate with the great powers of the world on equal footing. However, we must continue striving for an equal relationship with the other great powers regardless, for it is our destiny to become the great power of East Asia, with or without their acknowledgement."
 china_events.409.a: "After all these years, they still treat us like chess pieces!"

 china_events.410.t: "China seeks to join the Co-Prosperity Sphere"
 china_events.410.d: "During the Warlord Era of China, we backed the Fengtian Clique as the rightful government of the entirety of China. Our government even directly intervened in the Chinese Civil War to assist our friends on the mainland. However, the war situation did not develop to Japan's advantage, and we were pushed out of China, for good we thought. However, this time of peace with the Chinese government has also developed a unique situation for reconciliation.\n\nBefore regrettable circumstances caused the Sino Japanese War, many in both China and Japan pushed for our two nations to be united in the cause of pan asianism, where we would work together to push out the European Imperialists and free our oppressed Asian brothers. Political thinkers like Ikki Kita welcomed the Chinese revolution of 1912, and many of China's senior military officers received their education here in Japan.\n\nThe government of China has seen the wisdom of such an initiative, and today the Chinese ambassador has wired our government for a formal application into the Co-Prosperity Sphere. It is clear from their tone however, that they expect to be treated as an equal partner, and Japan is not to be the big brother of this relationship, as was the case between us and Shenyang in the 30s. Such an assertion would have been laughable in the past, but China emerges as a new united power that we ought not take lightly."
 china_events.410.a: "Asia for the Asians!"
 china_events.410.b: "The Chinese are not our equals and never will be!"

 china_events.411.t: "China joins the Co-Prosperity Sphere"
 china_events.411.d: "The Japanese have contacted our ambassador, formally welcoming us into the Co-Prosperity Sphere. Many would find our alliance with the Japanese unthinkable, for it was only a short time ago that they were the primary imperialist power attempting to prevent our rise. They forget however, the long history of ties between China and Japan. President Duan Qirui and his Anhui Clique had a fruitful relationship with Tokyo that didn't extend to the lapdog levels of the Shenyang-Tokyo relationship of the 30s, and we will make sure that our new relationship with Tokyo will not be as it was in the earlier 20th century. Instead, our two nations shall pursue an equal relationship based on mutual gain and cooperation. Together, we shall expel European Imperialists once and for all! Asia for the Asians!"
 china_events.411.a: "Japan and China united against imperialism!"

 china_events.412.t: "Our Application Denied"
 china_events.412.d: "The Japanese have contacted our ambassador, declining our application into the Co-Prosperity Sphere on the grounds of conflicting interests. Tokyo stressed that they still do wish to pursue good relations with us, and that Pan-asian liberation is a laudable goal. Our government has denounced Tokyo for clearly holding grudges against China for losing the Sino Japanese War and for putting Pan-Asian liberation second in priority to their pettiness. It's clear from this interaction that Japan is still interested in supremacy over Asia, and they still cling desperately to this delusional line of thought. In the end, it is their weakness on full display and China moves on from this incident all the stronger for it."
 china_events.412.a: "We should have known better than to trust the Japanese."

 china_events.422.t: "[FROM.GetName] seeks to join the [ROOT.GetFactionName]"
 china_events.422.d: "With the unification of China and our professed mission to to liberate Asia and the Pacific from imperialism, we have quickly become an inspiration for all those hoping to throw off the yoke of foreign colonialism. Many now proudly pattern their guerillas after MinGan and drill their soldiers with the Whampoa Spirit, and of course readily seek us out for aid and support. It is therefore so surprise that those who did overthrow their old masters have sought to align with us, hoping to protect themselves from further attack and perhaps aid in the liberation of Asia. Still, it is worth doing our due diligence - while world revolution sounds nice on paper the realities of geopolitics and overlapping nationalist claims should not be discounted in this new era for the continent."
 china_events.422.a: "Of course we will welcome our [FROM.GetAdjective] brothers!"
 china_events.422.b: "Unfortunately we must decline their application."

 china_events.423.t: "[ROOT.GetName] Joins the [FROM.GetFactionName]!"
 china_events.423.d: "With the unification of China and our professed mission to to liberate Asia and the Pacific from imperialism, they have quickly become an example for all those hoping to throw off the yoke of foreign colonialism. That said, our own successful efforts to free our people independently is a marvel unto itself and sets us apart from many groups in Asia who struggle to awaken their peoples' national and class consciousness. The freedom fighters of Asia need hope and inspiration, and what could be better than not one but two beacons of anti-colonialism? Thus, we have been admitted into the [FROM.GetFactionName] as we pursue mutual defence, prosperity, and freedom!"
 china_events.423.a: "Arm and arm for the liberty of Asian peoples!"

 china_events.424.t: "Our Application Denied."
 china_events.424.d: "The Chinese are an ancient civilisation, and have always been a haughty one. Emperor after Emperor, Dynasty after Dynasty, they tolerate few friends but expect many vassals. One would hope the humanitarian, transnational call of socialism would encourage the Chinese to change their ways and lend a hand in defence of their comrades, but it seems like this is for naught. The Chinese have declined to sign an alliance with us, whether because of fears of entanglement, nationalist claims, or perhaps simple realpolitik."
 china_events.424.a: "It seems that despite their revolution, the Chinese have yet to truly change."

 china_events.425.t: "An Invitation to join [FROM.GetFactionName]"
 china_events.425.d: "This morning our ambassador welcomed the Chinese delegation from [FROM.GetNameDef]. Appointed by [FROM.GetLeader], the victor of China's recent civil wars, it is no secret that the reunified Chinese state has sought to project strength overseas and restore China's historical role as the dominant power in East Asia. Whether or not that is a good thing is up to much debate.\n\nThe ambassador expressed sincerely his hopes that we should work together with the Chinese Government in solidarity for the mutual defence against foreign imperialism. Our resources will be shared and our military forces will actively work together in joint military exercises in order to strengthen our cooperation.\n\nWhile there are certainly those within our government who support such a decision, there are also others who are suspicious of Chinese intentions and worry that we will merely find ourselves lackeys or puppets in their new order in Asia."
 china_events.425.a: "Together for lasting peace!"
 china_events.425.b: "No, we have nothing to gain from that!"

 china_events.426.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Joins Us!"
 china_events.426.d: "It would appear that our ambassadors have accomplished a remarkable feat of diplomatic success as he has managed to convince [FROM.GetNameDef] to work with us and partake in the greater international struggle and revolution against foreign imperialism. Let us hope that this relationship with [FROM.GetNameDef] shall prove to last the ends of time, as we resolutely declare war on all foreign imperialists - for a free Asia!"
 china_events.426.a: "Together, we are strong!"

 china_events.427.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Declines Our Invitation"
 china_events.427.d: "Unfortunately despite his best efforts, it would appear that our diplomatic corps has failed in convincing [FROM.GetNameDef] to partake in our new order. It seems that the people of [FROM.GetNameDef] have either assumed the worst of our intentions or that they simply do not take our strength seriously. They have chosen to stand alone without our protection and leadership, a risk that they have brought upon themselves."
 china_events.427.a: "Their loss."

 china_mio_arsenal_integration_decision_category: "Building a Chinese Domestic Defence Industry"
 china_mio_arsenal_integration_decision_category_desc: "One of the few silver linings of decades of civil war is that heavy military spending has built a sturdy foundation for a modern military-industrial complex. However, many barriers remain. Besides the usual suspects of corruption, inexperience and wartime disruption, Chinese soldiers historically have been equipped with foreign designs, if not outright foreign imports, stifling the growth of a domestic arms industry. Furthermore, most of China's vast arsenals are heavily decentralised and poorly integrated, a product of warlord regionalism. As we march towards unification, we must work to capture and synchronise these military production hubs, unleashing the full potential of the Chinese industrial behemoth!"

 CHN_integrate_major_arsenal_decision_desc: "[CHN_integrate_major_arsenal_desc_scripted_loc]"

 CHN_integrate_major_arsenal_shenyang_key: "Integrate Shenyang Arsenal"
 CHN_integrate_major_arsenal_shenyang_desc_key: "Shenyang Arsenal is perhaps one of the hallmark achievements of the Fengtian clique, created and maintained with the help of Japanese advisors to maintain Zhang Zuolin's grip over Manchuria and fuel his ambitions of uniting China under his banner. Formally known as the Eastern Three Province Arsenal, it is one of the largest in China and boasts of its ability to produce more arms than all others in China combined across the 1920s. Taking advantage of Dongbei's superior industrial might and rich natural resources, Shenyang arsenal became a centre for not only production but also creating an extensive military logistical chain (including centralised production of rations and uniforms), as well as weapons development of their own. While Zhang was unable to fully break China's dependence on foreign arms imports, perhaps under our management it will play a valuable role in building a domestic arms industry."

 CHN_integrate_major_arsenal_taiyuan_key: "Integrate Taiyuan Arsenal"
 CHN_integrate_major_arsenal_taiyuan_desc_key: "Taiyuan Arsenal is a massive complex built in Shanxi's capital by its venerable Governor Yan Xishan. Quoted as saying \"armed force is the backing of justice\", he saw his precious arsenal as the cornerstone of preserving his province's autonomy. The plant was first constructed in 1912 as the Shanxi Machinery Bureau, and has undergone several iterations over the decades, churning out rifles, machine guns, mortars, grenades, and ammunition for the Shanxi clique. Unlike other warlord arsenals, Taiyuan is notable for its rare ability (even among central government facilities) to produce artillery pieces and shells in meaningful quantities. Its capture by our forces adds another invaluable northern foundry to our growing arms industry."

 CHN_integrate_major_arsenal_gongxian_key: "Integrate Gongxian Arsenal"
 CHN_integrate_major_arsenal_gongxian_desc_key: "In 1914, Yuan Shicai personally oversaw the construction of Gongxian Arsenal in Henan. Taking advantage of its strategic position and easy access to raw materials, Admiral Sa Zhenbing and hired German engineers used purchased American machinery to establish one of the premier modern military arsenals in China. Its relatively intact capture has secured for us a valuable prize in central China, one we must quickly integrate with the rest of our defence industry."

 CHN_integrate_major_arsenal_hanyang_key: "Integrate Hanyang Arsenal"
 CHN_integrate_major_arsenal_hanyang_desc_key: "Hanyang Arsenal is one of the largest, oldest and most important modern Chinese Arsenals. Built in 1891 as Hubei Arsenal, it required significant time and funds diverted from the fleet. Capable of producing artillery, rifles, and ammunition, Hanyang fed a series of armies including the original Xinhai Revolutionaries based in Wuhan. It has achieved fame developing and producing the Hanyang 88 rifle (based on the German Gewehr 1888) and the General Liu Rifle (designed by Hanyang Superintendent General Liu Qingen), some of the most iconic weapons of the Warlord Era."

 CHN_integrate_major_arsenal_guangdong_key: "Integrate Guangdong Arsenal"
 CHN_integrate_major_arsenal_guangdong_desc_key: "First erected by the Viceroy of Liangguang in 1873, the Guangdong Arsenal got its start as the Guangdong Machinery Bureau producing light arms. Gradually, it was expanded and modernised, constructing new facilities and absorbing other arsenals like Zengbu Arms Bureau to create a powerful military industrial complex in Guangdong. The Xinhai Revolution and ensuing wars saw Guangzhou become the centre of a succession of southern governments, and Guangdong Arsenal's role only continued to expand. Assisted by other regional arsenals like at Shijing, Pajiang, and even a dedicated gas-mask factory, the facilities of southern China will be of great service to the nation's cause."

 CHN_integrate_major_arsenal_fallback_key: "Integrate Major Military Arsenals at [FROM.GetName]"
 CHN_integrate_major_arsenal_fallback_desc_key: "The large-scale military production facilities here are of the utmost quality, or at least could be with sufficient investment and attention by our government. We must work to amalgamate them into our broader production line."

 CHN_integrate_minor_small_arms_arsenal_jinan_key: "Integrate Jinan Arsenal"
 CHN_integrate_minor_small_arms_arsenal_jinan_desc_key: "Created as the Shandong Machinery Bureau by Governor Ding Baozhen in 1875, it acquired machinery needed to produce weapons a few years later in 1883. It began producing a series of light arms derived from western designs, quickly expanding its industrial base to producing increasingly large amounts of rifles and other infantry equipment. Renamed Shandong Arsenal by the Beiyang Government, it saw further production and its final name as Jinan Arsenal under Zhang Zhongchang's rule."

 CHN_integrate_minor_small_arms_arsenal_jinling_key: "Integrate Jinling Arsenal"
 CHN_integrate_minor_small_arms_arsenal_jinling_desc_key: "Jinling Machinery Manufacturing Bureau, built atop the old Xitian Temple site by late Qing Dynasty reformer Li Hongzhang in 1865, quickly became one of China's venerable weapons production depots in Eastern China. Referred sometimes as \"the cradle of China's national military industry\", it became known for its ability to churn out rifles for the armies of the southern Zhili clique. Renamed Jinling Arsenal, it became the focal point of Sun Chuanfang efforts to build a modern Chinese army along German lines. Staffed with German technical advisors, it has been modernised into a production powerhouse for the League of Eight Provinces."

 CHN_integrate_minor_small_arms_arsenal_chongqing_key: "Integrate Chongqing Arsenal"
 CHN_integrate_minor_small_arms_arsenal_chongqing_desc_key: "The disruption caused by various wars in Eastern China, including recent developments following the collapse of Qing authority, have pushed some relocations of production infrastructure towards the hinterlands. While the extent to which these moves were planned versus hasty opportunism is debated, Chongqing has been a willing recipient of these evacuations, creating a burgeoning defence sector of its own. "

 CHN_integrate_minor_light_arms_arsenal_kunming_key: "Expand Southwestern Arsenals"
 CHN_integrate_minor_light_arms_arsenal_kunming_desc_key: "With fears of war looming over the horizon, a scattered but still substantive effort by various governments and patriotic citizens to evacuate China's industry westward into the hinterland yielded results. Yunnan Machine Bureau in Yunnan was one of the larger beneficiaries of this \"patriotic migration\", though ultimately it sits atop a scattered collection of smaller production sites scattered across China's southwest including the Kunming Arsenal and the Guizhou Chishui Arsenal. Bringing all of these western arsenals into our production sphere will allow our industrial potential to continue to grow."

 CHN_integrate_minor_light_arms_arsenal_zhuzhou_key: "Expand Zhuzhou Arsenal"
 CHN_integrate_minor_light_arms_arsenal_zhuzhou_desc_key: "As the military needs of the Zhili clique grew, some experts from Gongxian Arsenal went to the freshly secured province of Hunan to aid in the creation of a new light arms plant at Zhuzhou. While their goals of creating a cutting edge facility fell short due to the instability Hunan faced following the collapse of the League, Hunan sits at the crossroads of the nation and in turn it is imperative that we invest in expanding existing facilities there accordingly."

 CHN_integrate_minor_light_arms_arsenal_dihua_key: "Expand Dihua Arsenal"
 CHN_integrate_minor_light_arms_arsenal_dihua_desc_key: "Decades ago, in the far reaches of Xinjiang, Governor Rao Yingqi had enough foresight as he watched the Russians and British play their \"Great Game\" for Central Asia to realise that as China's western-most frontier he had to be prepared for the possibility of foreign incursions. In 1897, with the permission of the Qing government, he purchased German machinery from Shanghai and thus formally established the Xinjiang Machinery Bureau. Production was difficult, stymied by improper site selection causing water to dry up in the summer and winter.\n\nHowever, more recent warlords wisely invested in the plant, renaming it Dihua Arsenal and working to ensure it could produce a steady supply of new weapons as well as repairing existing ones. This helped give them an edge against rebels in the region, and with our newly found mastery over the region it is important that we learn from their frugal, hardy ways."

 CHN_integrate_minor_artillery_arsenal_lanzhou_key: "Expand Lanzhou Arsenal"
 CHN_integrate_minor_artillery_arsenal_lanzhou_desc_key: "In the ailing days of the Qing Empire, Governor Zuo Zongtang of Shaanxi and Gansu elected to establish the Lanzhou Machinery Bureau in 1871. Hiring local craftsmen and purchasing the necessary machinery from abroad, he laid the foundations for a reasonably successful regional ordinance production centre by coordinating facilities under his command in Lanzhou and Xi'an. The rifles, artillery guns, and their corresponding ammunition allowed Zuo to achieve successes fighting across China's western reaches, though the plant was unfortunately shut down in 1882.\n\nMore recent warlords have reopened it, albeit much of the infrastructure and personnel were since lost or grown outdated. Still, sitting deep in China's interior, it could not hurt to develop an alternative source of artillery and indeed it seems our predecessors had a similar idea though they failed to see it to full completion."

 CHN_integrate_major_dockyard_yingkou_key: "Integrate Yingkou Naval Yard"
 CHN_integrate_major_dockyard_yingkou_desc_key: "The port of Yingkou sits in a strategic site in the Yellow Sea, positioned in a controlling position along the Daliao river and Liaodong Bay. With Dalian (Port Arthur) under Japanese control, Yingkou was effectively the sole port under the Fengtian clique's direct control and significant (albeit insufficient) funding was provided to expand it as the home of their fleet. It is clear they have learned plenty from their Japanese partners, a skill-set we must be able to utilise for developing a fleet of our own."

 CHN_integrate_major_dockyard_jiangnan_key: "Integrate Jiangnan Shipyards"
 CHN_integrate_major_dockyard_jiangnan_desc_key: "Jiangnan Shipyard was founded in 1865 to build, repair, and covert both military and civilian ships alike. Located near the Yangtze and situated largely within the mighty port of Shanghai, Jiangnan is one of the premier shipbuilding centres in all of China. Long strongly under the control of the Beiyang government, the creation of the Legation Cities altered the dynamic significantly. Still, they have benefited from outside investment and expertise, something we must bring under our control for a more equal future."

 CHN_integrate_major_dockyard_mawei_key: "Integrate the Fuzhou Arsenal"
 CHN_integrate_major_dockyard_mawei_desc_key: "Fuzhou Arsenal, also known as the Foochow Arsenal or Mawei Arsenal, was created under the orders of late Qing Dynasty leaders Li Hongzhang and Zuo Zongtang a few miles up the Min River. Taking advantage of Fujian's proud naval heritage and local naval academies, the Fuzhou arsenal complimented the region by providing a western designed naval dockyard, a metal-working forge, and additional schools for navigation and marine engineering. Damaged in ensuing wars, it was rebuilt and remained a prominent dockyard though under Legation control. Having secured its return, we must utilise it to its fullest capacity in helping us build a modern navy."

 CHN_integrate_major_dockyard_whampoa_key: "Integrate Whampoa Dock Company"
 CHN_integrate_major_dockyard_whampoa_desc_key: "The Hong Kong and Whampoa Dock Company was founded by Douglas Lapraik and Thomas Sutherland in 1866. Often abbreviated Whampoa Dock or Kowloon Docks, it effectively monopolised shipbuilding in the Pearl River Delta across the 1870s. The Canton region has traditionally been a centre for external trade, and its location made it both an asset and a target in the South China sea. We shall integrate these newly acquired facilities into our navy."

 CHN_integrate_major_dockyard_fallback_key: "Integrate Major Shipyards at [FROM.GetName]"
 CHN_integrate_major_dockyard_fallback_desc_key: "[FROM.GetName] has become quite a centre for naval construction, with a powerful collection of drydocks, shipyards, and training centres for naval personnel. Having become its newest masters, it is critical that we make the most out of their expertise for the good of the nation."
