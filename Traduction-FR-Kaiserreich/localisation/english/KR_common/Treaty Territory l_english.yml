### Ideas ###
 holds_leases_idea: "Holds Minor Territories"
 holds_leases_idea_desc: "We currently either lease or directly own important but diminutive territories around the world.\n§W--------------§!§L\n[gitmo_active][mole_active][samana_active]§!"

 gitmo_lease_idea: "Guantanamo Bay Lease"
 gitmo_lease_idea_desc: "We currently lease the significant Guantanamo Bay naval base to §Y[GTM.GetNameWithFlag]§!.\n\nGuantanamo Bay was occupied by the United States during the Cuban War of Independence as part of the larger Spanish-American war. In the years and decades thereafter, American control over Guantanamo Bay under nominal Cuban sovereignty was reaffirmed and the Guantanamo Bay naval base was greatly expanded. Whoever controls Guantanamo Bay, the United States or some other imperial power, will surely reap significant benefit."
 mole_lease_idea: "Môle Saint-Nicolas Lease"
 mole_lease_idea_desc: "We currently lease the coastal city of Môle Saint-Nicolas to §Y[MSN.GetNameWithFlag]§!.\n\nOnly recently a small coastal town, Môle Saint-Nicolas is slowly but surely being transformed into a naval station to rival that of the nearby Guantanamo Bay."
 samana_lease_idea: "Samaná Lease"
 samana_lease_idea_desc: "We currently lease the coastal city of Santa Bárbara de Samaná to §Y[SAM.GetNameWithFlag]§!.\n\nCoveted by the Americans prior to their acquisition of Guantanamo Bay, after decades of relative obscurity in the eyes of foreign powers, Samaná is now being rapidly transformed into a hub for [SAM.GetAdjective] fleets."
