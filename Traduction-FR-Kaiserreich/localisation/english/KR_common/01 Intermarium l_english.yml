 mie.0.d: "Russia's decade long slump has ended, and now the Russians are rebuilding - already, they raise claims over their former Imperial territories, and Eastern European states are surely going to be one of their targets.\n\nTo make sure that the Russian threat is contained and Eastern European states can defend their sovereignty, leaders and generals of the Oststaaten have gathered in [MIE_leader.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] to discuss a programme of mutual cooperation. A joint military defence fund has been established and [MIE_leader.GetNameDef] has been entrusted with managing it to fund the region's joint defence ventures."

When the Second Weltkrieg begins, we will have to brace ourselves against the Russian storm - and unless we work together, we will be picked off one by one.\n\nAfter [?global.russia.GetNameDef] activates its foreign policy tree, all Eastern members of the Reichspakt unlock the ability to §Ypool resources§! and distribute them between their member states to eliminate any weak links. The country responsible for distributing the joint resource pool can invest in its fellow member states to §Ybuild fortifications§!, §Yraise divisions§!, and provide beneficial §YNational Spirits§!.\n\nCurrent pooled resources:\n    £rifle_texticon  Infantry Equipment: §Y[?global.MIE_infantry_equipment]§!\n    £support_texticon  Support Equipment: §Y[?global.MIE_support_equipment]§!\n    £unit_artillery_icon_small  Artillery Equipment: §Y[?global.MIE_artillery_equipment]§!\n\n[MIE_leader.GetNameWithFlag] is currently responsible for distributing the resource pool."
