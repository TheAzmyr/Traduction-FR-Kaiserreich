 intermarium_events.0.d: "Russia's decade long slump has ended, and now the Russians are rebuilding - already, they raise claims over their former Imperial territories, and Eastern European states are surely going to be one of their targets.\n\nTo make sure that the Russian threat is contained and Eastern European states can defend their sovereignty, leaders and generals of the Oststaaten have gathered in [MIE_leader.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] to discuss a programme of mutual cooperation. A joint military defence fund has been established and [MIE_leader.GetNameDef] has been entrusted with managing it to fund the region's joint defence ventures."
