### Events and Decisions ###

Occupation can be expensive and destabilising but it would give us direct access to the riches of this new land. On the other hand, creating a puppet nation would certainly be cheaper, though our new subjects may not be as reliable as we might think. Either way, the fate of nations rests in our hands."

#Generic Land Exchange Events
 annex.5.t: "An Offer from [From.GetNameDef]"
 annex.5.desc: "A delegation from [From.GetNameDef] has arrived with an offer: in exchange for us assuming control over a number of our claimed lands, now in [From.GetAdjective] possession, they ask for [Root.GetNameDef] to join the [From.GetFactionName]. It is a tempting offer, though it means abandoning any of our current alliances and wars."
 annex.5.a: "We agree to their alliance"
 annex.5.b: "Absolutely not"

 annex.6.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Agrees"
 annex.6.desc: "The [From.GetAdjective] government was more than happy to exchange the return of their land for an alliance with us."
 annex.6.a: "Excellent!"

 annex.7.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] has Refused"
 annex.7.desc: "The [From.GetAdjective] government apparently does not want their lands back badly enough, or do not trust our offer. Either way, they have refused to join our alliance."
 annex.7.a: "Their loss, it seems"

 annex.8.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Abandons the [Root.GetFactionName]"
 annex.8.desc: "It appears an offer made by [From.From.GetNameDef] for the return of claimed lands was too much for [From.GetNameDef] to refuse. They have abandoned our alliance and joined the [From.From.GetFactionName]. Perhaps it is land we could never have delivered to them, but even so - it is a bitter pill to swallow."
 annex.8.a: "Hopefully we do not end up on opposing sides..."

 annex.18.t: "Territories Regained!"
 annex.18.d: "The [From.GetAdjective] government has elected to return lands in formerly Austrian-occupied Italy to us."
 annex.18.a: "Hurrah!"

 annex.184.t: "An O'Neill Restoration?"
 annex.184.d: "Now that we have recreated an Irish state some have proposed the restoration of an Irish monarchy. The most obvious option would be the O'Neills, descendants of the last High King of Ireland, Brian O'Neill, and who played a major part in both the Nine Years War and the Irish Confederate Wars with Hugh O'Neill and Owen Roe O'Neill achieving many great victories against the English and Scots. The current head of the Clanaboy line of the O'Neill dynasty Jorge Maria O'Neill resides in Portugal, currently working as an electrical engineer, a role far beneath his station."
 annex.184.a: "The O'Neills shall be restored to the throne of Ireland!"
 annex.184.b: "Maintain an Irish republic."

 annex.185.t: "Jorge O'Neill arrives!"
 annex.185.d: "Jorge Maria O'Neill has agreed to take up residence in Dublin Castle as High King of Ireland. Arriving this morning, he made a speech on the Hill of Tara affirming that he would be a strong and just ruler, and emphasised the achievements and victories of Hugh O'Neill and Owen Roe O'Neill over the English. While die-hard republicans are angry over the restoration, many have accepted the new High King as Ireland's rightful head of state."
 annex.185.a: "O'Neill Abú!"

 annex.240.t: "The Fate of the Former Papal States"
 annex.240.d: "Our recent annexation of Northern Italy has left us with remnants of land that, according to the peace treaty of 1919, should pertain to the Pope. We thus have the option of returning it to its rightful owner, either freely or conditioned to their submission. We could also simply continue the occupation of these lands."
 annex.240.a: "Give it freely to the Pope."
 annex.240.b: "Propose a deal: the land for a submission."
 annex.240.c: "Continue the occupation!"

 annex.241.t: "Our Rightful Land"
 annex.241.d: "A generous power in the north has decided to respect the treaty of 1919 and give back the land they occupied to their rightful owner, us. We'll evidently have to thank them for this great victory of our state."
 annex.241.a: "The Papal lands are reunited."

 annex.242.t: "A Generous Proposition?"
 annex.242.d: "The occupying power in the north sent diplomats to Rome today to propose us a diplomatic deal. They would agree to return the lands that were stolen to us during the bloody civil war of 1919 for the simple condition of accepting to stop any independent initiative in our foreign policy, in other words, become a satellite. This proposal, while endangering our sovereignty has the merit of bringing us back the vast territories that we were promised. It will have to be judged and answered to accordingly."
 annex.242.a: "Accept the proposal, get back our land."
 annex.242.b: "We'll never bow down!"

 annex.243.t: "The Pope Accepted the Deal!"
 annex.243.d: "The Pope has sent back our diplomats with good news, he accepted the proposal to abandon his control over his foreign policy for the safe return of his land in the North. It is now time to apply the conditions of the deal."
 annex.243.a: "Very good."

 annex.244.t: "The Pope Refused the Deal!"
 annex.244.d: "The Pope has reportedly angrily sent back our diplomats, outraged at the idea of a submission of the Holy See to any invader. It seems our deal never had a chance to be accepted after all."
 annex.244.a: "Who do they think are? They won't get an inch back!"

 annexation_PAL_CONQ: "The Fate of Palestine"
 annexation_PAL_CONQ_desc: "Our armies have taken control of the southern part of the Levant, and the local Palestinian population is clamouring for self-government. We should decide what's to be done with the region."
 annex.247.a: "Release a Palestinian government."
 annex.247.b: "Give it to our [TUR.GetAdjective] allies."
 annex.247.c: "Give it to our [SYR.GetAdjective] allies."
 annex.247.d: "Give it to our [EGY.GetAdjective] allies."

#Italy
 annex.281.t: "An Offer from [From.GetNameDef]"
 annex.281.d.allitaly: "A delegation from [From.GetNameDef] has arrived with an offer: in exchange for us assuming control over most of Italy, the lands now in [From.GetAdjective] possession, they ask for [Root.GetNameDef] to join the [From.GetFactionName]. It is a tempting offer, though it means abandoning any of our current alliances and wars."
 annex.281.d.centralitaly: "A delegation from [From.GetNameDef] has arrived with an offer: in exchange for us assuming control over much of Central Italy, the lands now in [From.GetAdjective] possession, they ask for [Root.GetNameDef] to join the [From.GetFactionName]. It is a tempting offer, though it means abandoning any of our current alliances and wars."
 annex.281.d.piedmont: "A delegation from [From.GetNameDef] has arrived with an offer: in exchange for us returning to the mainland and assuming control over Piedmont, now in [From.GetAdjective] possession, they ask for [Root.GetNameDef] to join the [From.GetFactionName]. It is a tempting offer, though it means abandoning any of our current alliances and wars."
 annex.281.a: "We agree to their alliance"
 annex.281.b: "Absolutely not"

 annex.282.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Agrees"
 annex.282.d: "The [From.GetAdjective] government was more than happy to exchange the return of their land for an alliance with us."

 annex.283.a: "Their loss, it seems"

 annex.284.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Abandons the [Root.GetFactionName]"
 annex.284.d: "It appears an offer made by [From.From.GetNameDef] for the return of lands in Italy was too much for [From.GetNameDef] to refuse. They have abandoned our alliance and joined the [From.From.GetFactionName]. Perhaps it is land we could never have delivered to them, but even so - it is a bitter pill to swallow."
 annex.284.a: "Hopefully we do not end up on opposing sides"

#Serbia
 annex.285.t: "An Offer from [From.GetNameDef]"
 annex.285.d: "The Serbian leadership has been approached by a representative from [FROM.GetNameDef]. The [FROM.GetAdjective] government's new ownership of territories in the Balkans is a situation in need of a more long-term solution, they say, and they have little to gain from a costly occupation. They are aware of the long-harboured Serbian ambitions on uniting the southern Slavs into a single polity, and of their continued failure in doing so, despite there being no doubt that the idea of Yugoslavia still holds much allure.\n\nThe presented offer is a simple one. The territories that make up the proposed state of Yugoslavia, in exchange for full Serbian participation in the [FROM.GetFactionName].\n\nMost in the government see this proposition as too good to be true, though the usual dissenting voices are already spreading whispers of being drawn into further unwanted bloodshed. It would of course mean parting ways with any current allies, which the same voices are decrying as supercilious, but it would almost certainly be worth it."
 annex.285.a: "Where do we sign?"
 annex.285.b: "There has to be some kind of catch."

 annex.286.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] has Agreed"
 annex.286.d: "To the surprise of few, the Serbs have accepted the proposal for an alliance, in exchange for the territories they so covet.\n\nTheir long-desired Yugoslavia may now be created, [ROOT.GetNameDef] gains an ally in the Balkans, and the [ROOT.GetFactionName] grows larger!"
 annex.286.a: "Hej, Sloveni!"

 annex.287.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] has Refused"
 annex.287.d: "Stating the uncertainty of their current government being able to handle the transfer of territory, with a hint of being of not wanting to being drawn into further conflicts, the Serbs have shocked the diplomatic corps at their refusal of the generous offer. It looks like we will now need to set up local supervised governments to administer the region."
 annex.287.a: "Their loss."

 annex.288.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Abandons the [Root.GetFactionName]"
 annex.288.d: "It appears an offer made by [From.From.GetNameDef] for the transfer of their claims in the Balkans was too much for [From.GetNameDef] to refuse. They have abandoned our alliance and joined the [From.From.GetFactionName]. Perhaps it is land we could never have delivered to them, but even so - it is a bitter pill to swallow."
 annex.288.a: "Hopefully we do not end up on opposing sides..."

#Romania
 annex.289.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Offers Transylvania"
 annex.289.d: "The course of geopolitics in recent years has, as it often does, created some unusual situations. For Romanians, the one that has had the biggest reverberations is the entry of Transylvania into the [FROM.GetFactionName]'s sphere - after the tragic defeat in the Great War, the dismantlement of the Austrian state has raised many hopes that the Great Union may still be achieved after all.\n\n[FROM.GetNameDef] seems to understand this. The government received a note today explaining that they are very prepared to hand Transylvania over to us - on the condition that we will promptly join their alliance. Needless to say, the opportunity to achieve the goal held by many Romanians over the last few decades is a highly tempting one - but it does not come without risk. Entangling ourselves with the [FROM.GetFactionName] obviously would throw us into any conflicts they may enter, regardless of them being in Romania's interests. This is to say nothing of the innate diplomatic risks of realignment, which would threaten to alienate any friends we may already have. The question, therefore, is this: how much are we willing to risk for the union of all Romanians?"
 annex.289.a: "No price is too high for salvation."
 annex.289.b: "Not today, my friends."

 annex.290.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Accepts"
 annex.290.d: "As expected, [FROM.GetName] has just sent their acceptance of our terms regarding the Transylvanian proposal. Transylvania will be transferred as soon as possible - completing for us a great strategic coup."
 annex.290.a: "We destroy our enemies by making them our friends."

 annex.291.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Refuses"
 annex.291.d: "It seems that we do not understand [FROM.GetName] as well as we thought - they have just sent a message that politely but curtly declines our proposal to transfer Transylvania. The foreign office seems to be rather stunned by this news."
 annex.291.a: "Nobody wants to talk to each other anymore..."

 annex.292.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Betrays Us!"
 annex.292.d: "Treachery has fallen upon us! Until now, all thought of [FROM.GetNameDef] as a steadfast ally in a chaotic time - but apparently friendship is a fragile thing in politics. It came to light today that [FROM.GetNameDef] has been involved in secret negotiations with [FROM.FROM.GetNameDef], with the intent of reaching an agreement to satisfy their claims on Transylvania in exchange for an alliance. This may not have been such a dramatic injury had we not learned of it from an announcement of the deal's completion - and the following expulsion of our forces from [FROM.GetNameDef].\n\nWe have been caught completely flat-footed by the news, and reactions inside and outside of the government range from shock, to despair, to demands that [FROM.GetNameDef] be made to pay for their duplicity."
 annex.292.a: "And after everything we've been through!"

#Event for Chinese tag to notify return of concessions from Japan
 annex.300.t: "Japan Returns Concessions in China"
 annex.300.d: "In the peace negotiations following our victory against the Japanese, they agreed to return any Chinese concessions seized after the peace treaty. As such, they have returned what is rightfully ours. Another victory for China and another humiliation for our rivals in the East. The Century of Humiliation is one step closer to ending."
 annex.300.a: "Japan's influence in mainland China should be all but over now."
