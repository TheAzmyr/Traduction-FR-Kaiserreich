On the other hand, liberating friendly nations would certainly be cheaper, though our new allies may not be as reliable as we might think.

#Generic Land Exchange Events
 annexation_events.5.t_romania: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Offers Transylvania"
 annexation_events.5.t_generic: "An Offer From [From.GetNameDef]"
 annexation_events.5.desc_italy: "A delegation from [From.GetNameDef] has arrived with an offer: in exchange for us assuming control over most of Italy, the lands now in [From.GetAdjective] possession, they ask for [Root.GetNameDef] to join the [From.GetFactionName]. It is a tempting offer, though it means abandoning any of our current alliances and wars."
 annexation_events.5.desc_papacy: "A delegation from [From.GetNameDef] has arrived with an offer: in exchange for us assuming control over much of Central Italy, the lands now in [From.GetAdjective] possession, they ask for [Root.GetNameDef] to join the [From.GetFactionName]. It is a tempting offer, though it means abandoning any of our current alliances and wars."
 annexation_events.5.desc_romania: "The course of geopolitics in recent years has, as it often does, created some unusual situations. For Romanians, the one that has had the biggest reverberations is the entry of Transylvania into the [FROM.GetFactionName]'s sphere - after the tragic defeat in the Great War, the dismantlement of the Austrian state has raised many hopes that the Great Union may still be achieved after all.\n\n[FROM.GetNameDef] seems to understand this. The government received a note today explaining that they are very prepared to hand Transylvania over to us - on the condition that we will promptly join their alliance. Needless to say, the opportunity to achieve the goal held by many Romanians over the last few decades is a highly tempting one - but it does not come without risk. Entangling ourselves with the [FROM.GetFactionName] obviously would throw us into any conflicts they may enter, regardless of them being in Romania's interests. This is to say nothing of the innate diplomatic risks of realignment, which would threaten to alienate any friends we may already have. The question, therefore, is this: how much are we willing to risk for the union of all Romanians?"
 annexation_events.5.desc_serbia: "The Serbian leadership has been approached by a representative from [FROM.GetNameDef]. The [FROM.GetAdjective] government's new ownership of territories in the Balkans is a situation in need of a more long-term solution, they say, and they have little to gain from a costly occupation. They are aware of the long-harboured Serbian ambitions on uniting the southern Slavs into a single polity, and of their continued failure in doing so, despite there being no doubt that the idea of Yugoslavia still holds much allure.\n\nThe presented offer is a simple one. The territories that make up the proposed state of Yugoslavia, in exchange for full Serbian participation in the [FROM.GetFactionName].\n\nMost in the government see this proposition as too good to be true, though the usual dissenting voices are already spreading whispers of being drawn into further unwanted bloodshed. It would of course mean parting ways with any current allies, which the same voices are decrying as supercilious, but it would almost certainly be worth it."
 annexation_events.5.desc_generic: "A delegation from [From.GetNameDef] has arrived with an offer: in exchange for us assuming control over a number of our claimed lands, now in [From.GetAdjective] possession, they ask for [Root.GetNameDef] to join the [From.GetFactionName]. It is a tempting offer, though it means abandoning any of our current alliances and wars."
 annexation_events.5.a_romania: "No price is too high for salvation."
 annexation_events.5.a_generic: "We agree to their alliance!"
 annexation_events.5.b_romania: "Not today, my friends."
 annexation_events.5.b_generic: "Absolutely not."

 annexation_events.6.t_generic: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Agrees"
 annexation_events.6.desc_romania: "As expected, [FROM.GetName] has just sent their acceptance of our terms regarding the Transylvanian proposal. Transylvania will be transferred as soon as possible - completing for us a great strategic coup."
 annexation_events.6.desc_serbia: "To the surprise of few, the Serbs have accepted the proposal for an alliance, in exchange for the territories they so covet.\n\nTheir long-desired Yugoslavia may now be created, [ROOT.GetNameDef] gains an ally in the Balkans, and the [ROOT.GetFactionName] grows larger!"
 annexation_events.6.desc_generic: "The [From.GetAdjective] government was more than happy to exchange the return of their land for an alliance with us."
 annexation_events.6.a_romania: "We destroy our enemies by making them our friends."
 annexation_events.6.a_serbia: "Hej, Sloveni!"
 annexation_events.6.a_generic: "Excellent!"

 annexation_events.7.t_generic: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Has Refused"
 annexation_events.7.desc_romania: "It seems that we do not understand [FROM.GetName] as well as we thought - they have just sent a message that politely but curtly declines our proposal to transfer Transylvania. The foreign office seems to be rather stunned by this news."
 annexation_events.7.desc_serbia: "Stating the uncertainty of their current government being able to handle the transfer of territory, with a hint of being of not wanting to being drawn into further conflicts, the Serbs have shocked the diplomatic corps at their refusal of the generous offer. It looks like we will now need to set up local supervised governments to administer the region."
 annexation_events.7.desc_generic: "The [From.GetAdjective] government apparently does not want their lands back badly enough, or do not trust our offer. Either way, they have refused to join our alliance."
 annexation_events.7.a_generic: "Their loss, it seems."

 annexation_events.8.t_romania: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Betrays Us!"
 annexation_events.8.t_generic: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Abandons the [Root.GetFactionName]"
 annexation_events.8.desc_romania: "Treachery has fallen upon us! Until now, all thought of [FROM.GetNameDef] as a steadfast ally in a chaotic time - but apparently friendship is a fragile thing in politics. It came to light today that [FROM.GetNameDef] has been involved in secret negotiations with [FROM.FROM.GetNameDef], with the intent of reaching an agreement to satisfy their claims on Transylvania in exchange for an alliance. This may not have been such a dramatic injury had we not learned of it from an announcement of the deal's completion - and the following expulsion of our forces from [FROM.GetNameDef].\n\nWe have been caught completely flat-footed by the news, and reactions inside and outside of the government range from shock, to despair, to demands that [FROM.GetNameDef] be made to pay for their duplicity."
 annexation_events.8.desc_generic: "It appears an offer made by [From.From.GetNameDef] for the return of claimed lands was too much for [From.GetNameDef] to refuse. They have abandoned our alliance and joined the [From.From.GetFactionName]. Perhaps it is land we could never have delivered to them, but even so - it is a bitter pill to swallow."
 annexation_events.8.a_romania: "And after everything we've been through!"
 annexation_events.8.a_generic: "Hopefully we do not end up on opposing sides..."

 annexation_events.184.t: "An O'Neill Restoration?"
 annexation_events.184.d: "Now that we have recreated an Irish state some have proposed the restoration of an Irish monarchy. The most obvious option would be the O'Neills, descendants of the last High King of Ireland, Brian O'Neill, and who played a major part in both the Nine Years War and the Irish Confederate Wars with Hugh O'Neill and Owen Roe O'Neill achieving many great victories against the English and Scots. The current head of the Clanaboy line of the O'Neill dynasty Jorge Maria O'Neill resides in Portugal, currently working as an electrical engineer, a role far beneath his station."
 annexation_events.184.a: "The O'Neills shall be restored to the throne of Ireland!"
 annexation_events.184.b: "Maintain an Irish republic."

 annexation_events.185.t: "Jorge O'Neill arrives!"
 annexation_events.185.d: "Jorge Maria O'Neill has agreed to take up residence in Dublin Castle as High King of Ireland. Arriving this morning, he made a speech on the Hill of Tara affirming that he would be a strong and just ruler, and emphasised the achievements and victories of Hugh O'Neill and Owen Roe O'Neill over the English. While die-hard republicans are angry over the restoration, many have accepted the new High King as Ireland's rightful head of state."
 annexation_events.185.a: "O'Neill Abú!"

 annexation_events.200.t: "Who to Give Italy to?"
 annexation_events.200.desc: "Although we have triumphed over the northern Italian socialist regime, it is clear to all in [ROOT.Capital.GetName] that we have no interest or ability to continue to occupy the Italian lands our country occupies.

 #annexation_germany_desc: "For the last fifty years, the German Empire has stood united in the centre of Europe. From the once-Polish lands of Prussia to the Francophone Catholic west, from Lower Saxony in the north to Bavaria in the south, the conservative Kaiserreich created one nation where before there had been many. However, with our victory, we have a chance to radically restructure the German state structure. Our total conquest has shattered the spirit of German civil resistance, and we essentially have unlimited license to choose whichever government, or governments, serve our interests in Central Europe."

 annexation_28: "The Fate of Alsace-Lorraine"
 annexation_28_desc: "Since the capitulation of our last remaining enemies in Europe, our military administration has governed the territories of Alsace and Lorraine, long contested by Germany and France, with martial law. With peace comes expectations of change, however, and envoys from Strasbourg, often accompanied by imperious French ambassadors, have been seen in the hallways of power in [ROOT.Capital.GetName], hoping to pressure stressed bureaucrats into restoring the mostly German-speaking territory to France before anyone in our administration has time to sit down and fully consider the matter. Should we indulge their requests? Is Alsace once and for all German? Or should we give the Alsatians a few good years of [ROOT.GetAdjective] occupation before considering the matter properly, when the world situation best permits it?"

 annexation_8: "The Fate of Luxembourg"
 annexation_8_desc: "For centuries, the Luxembourg Question troubled the great powers. After the Weltkrieg and twenty-five years of German rule, few of the Luxembourgish people have aspirations for independence, and in the era of syndicalism, close air support, and cryptologic decryption, any mention of the Salic Law has been met not so much with contempt as bafflement. The Grand Duchy of Luxembourg will not return to the map of Europe. However, there is also no need to return it to Germany. Luxembourg was part of both France and then Belgium little more than a century ago without complaint, and should a decision serve our foreign policy, there is little doubt that Luxembourg would cause no trouble this time either."

 annexation_781: "The Fate of the Rhineland"
 annexation_781_desc: "The beating heart of German industry, the foundation of the Prussian dominance of Germany, and the brutal stage for the Second Weltkrieg - the Rhineland is in some respects the place most responsible for the horrors of the twentieth century. Consequently, some advisors in our government have recommended detaching the Rhineland from Germany, and even imposing massive reparations to depower the region. On the other hand, with the war so recently over, it is unlikely that Germany could threaten us again anytime soon, and they might be a far more capable ally and economic partner with, rather than without, the foundries of the Ruhr. Whatever we decide, it would be wise to do so quickly, for the longer we occupy the Rhineland, the more of our resources it will absorb rather than produce."

 annexation_59: "The Fate of North Germany"
 annexation_59_desc: "Before the Prussians dominated Europe, they subjugated Germany, and before they subjugated Germany, they started with the North German Federation. Now [Root.GetNameDef] has stripped even Northern Germany away, and it is up to [Root.GetNameDef] to determine what will become of the Lower Saxon lands. We could create a puppet state based in Hamburg or Brunswick, relocating the centre of German political life westward for the first time in centuries. Alternatively, we could decide to favor one of our other German allied states, possibly bolstering their legitimacy and power to reunite Germany themselves one day. Can we afford to take the chance? Or for the security of Europe, must our soldiers occupy North Germany for the foreseeable future?"
 annexation_events.1004.a: "Release a North German state."

 annexation_782: "The Fate of [782.GetName]"
 annexation_782_desc: "One of the first victims of Prussian imperialism was the Danish-speaking province of [782.GetName]. It was in the aftermath of the Second Schleswig War in the 1860s that Prussia was able to dominate Germany from a war that started around their base in the region, and although Denmark and Germany have been allies in the century since it has remained a sore point for the local population that they are ruled by foreigners. However, sometimes diplomatic and military necessity override obscure matters of linguistic history, and there is no doubt that the territory would be safer in the hands of a German ally than a Danish foe. Our military commander in the region is capably handling unrest, for now, but should we make a decision on the future of [782.GetName] and spare him the trouble?"

 annexation_64: "The Fate of Prussia"
 annexation_64_desc: "Brandenburg was the centre of gravity of Prussia, and thus the Prussian-formed German Empire. For decades, Berlin has bustled with activity, mostly with the politicians and diplomats of the great powers but as of [GetYear] with the barked orders and shouts of soldiers, and, now, enforced quiet under [Root.GetAdjective] martial law. With the end of the former German state comes, almost inevitably, the beginning of a new.\n\nA German state based in Berlin would be a powerful contender for a reunification of Germany one day, so some in our government have proposed granting Brandenburg and Berlin to a German statelet based in a western city, so that Prussia can never rise again. Others point to the need for a strong Prussian ally to counter our enemies on their borders, and claim that with our military supremacy over Europe Prussia would never dream of challenging us again. No doubt, of course, the Prussians could appreciate the irony of a good, long \"temporary\" military occupation."

 annexation_10: "The Fate of Poland"
 annexation_10_desc: "Once again, Poland is on the verge of being wiped off the map of Europe. Once a powerful player in European geopolitics, the three Partitions of Poland in the late eighteenth century annexed Poland-Lithuania to its three neighbors, and only the Germany victory against Russia in the First Weltkrieg restored it, albeit as a shell of its former self. With the capitulation of authorities in Warsaw to [ROOT.GetAdjective] troops, we now control the majority of the country, and accordingly its fate is in our hands. Should we grant Poland its liberty, at least within the bounds of the limited kingdom of the last century? Of course, once we have taken this step, there is nothing stopping us from imposing a government that favors our interests, or allowing this friendly government to realise Pan-Slavic dreams of a greater Poland. On the other hand, if our interests demand it, we can follow the example of so many powers before us and haul down the Polish red-and-white bicolor for good."

Again, therefore, the French nation lies defeated, ready for a regime change. With our military occupying practically the entire country, we have full control over the direction of that regime change. Should we establish a friendly government, backed by our military? The French people may have had their spirit finally broken by this last war, but there is no guarantee that we will not be fighting them again in twenty years.

For a couple centuries it was close to Portuguese, before the two started to diverge by the 15th century. Between the 16th and 19th centuries it was a dark age for the Galician language and culture; Galician started to be replaced with Spanish in writing and used mostly orally. However, a resurgence began in the 19th century to bring the culture and the language official status, resulting in calls for autonomy in an attempt to reverse increased centralisation. A nationalist movement developed in the 1910s and 1920s, though it was ultimately insignificant. However, an autonomist movement gained some traction during this time, albeit unable to achieve anything under Primo de Rivera's reign.\n\nWith our occupation of Galicia, we have been left with a couple options of what should be done with the territory."

Carlism managed to take hold in the region, especially in rural Navarre, with the promise of restoring the fueros.

Under the Crown of Aragon between 1137 and 1516, the Catalan culture flourished and distinct institutions developed. With the union of the Crowns of Castile and Aragon from 1516 onwards, Catalonia enjoyed a degree of autonomy it held previously for a time, though it gradually started to be stripped away from increased centralisation in the next few centuries. The Nueva Planta decrees of the early 18th century abolished the Crown of Aragon, including the old laws and institutions that had developed previously.\n\nWith the seeds of industrialisation and a cultural revival in the 19th century, Catalan nationalism started to take root seeking to at least federalise the region. The Commonwealth of Catalonia was established in 1914, which resulted in the submission of a Statute of Autonomy in 1919, that ultimately failed with the ascent of Miguel Primo de Rivera.\n\n[annexation_catalonia_description].

Mongolia has been ruled by Roman von Ungern-Sternberg, who expelled Chinese troops from the region, aiding Bogd Khan in declaring independence.

In the aftermath of the Xinhai Revolution, the Fengtian Clique backed by Japan utilized the region as their home base in their efforts to unite China under their banner.

 annexation_1042_desc: "[1042.GetName] was administered in a contentious between Russia, China, and Afghanistan ever since 1864 with the signing of the unequal Tacheng Boundary Treaty. Stipulating the border between Russia and China extending to the Pamir Mountains and bounded by Kokand, it did not specify the boundary of Badakhshan, this was further muddled by the signing of another unequal treaty, the Sino-Russian Ili Treaty which stipulated that the Sino-Russian border \"shall be determined in accordance with the existing borders of the two countries\".\n\nFurthermore in 1884, a boundary survey and yet another unequal treaty, the Sino-Russian Kashgar Boundary Treaty, simply added a disputed area to the border. The Russian Empire would send soldiers into the region in 1891, and then entered the Chinese territory in 1892. In 1895, Russia and Britain would divide the Pamirs between themselves, despite the Qing lodging diplomatic complaints.\n\nAdditionally, there exists Afghanistan's claim having historically controlled the region for centuries. After the Russian conquest of Turkestan, the border between Russia and Afghanistan remained loosely defined. Forming the 1884 Afghan Boundary Commission, Britain and Russia hoped to settle the issue, but before the commission could come to an agreement, Russia launched an invasion to push the border as far south as possible, resulting in the Panjdeh Incident; becoming a point of continuous contention from there onwards into the interwar. With multiple parties all lodging claims, it is now up to us to determine its future."
