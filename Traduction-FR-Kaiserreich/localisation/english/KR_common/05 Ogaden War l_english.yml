###  EVENTS  ###
 ogaden.1.t: "Attack on Ogaden"
 ogaden.1.desc.ETH: "It is high time we ended the illegal occupation of the borderlands and freed them from Somali domination once and for all. Our troops are massing on the border, and while the Somali forces likely expect little more than another round of light skirmishes, this time we are coming at them with full force."
 ogaden.1.desc.SOM: "In the last war, the Ethiopians pushed us from our positions, and they probably even delude themselves into thinking that this victory is to last. It is anything but, and our forces are more than ready to show them who is the king of the Horn!"
 ogaden.1.a: "Forward!"

 ogaden.2.t: "Tactical Victory in Ogaden"
 ogaden.2.desc.ETH: "The latest reports from the front are in, and they tell of our triumph! The Somali forces are scattered and retreating, and our forces have begun to secure their positions so that it remains ours for good. We have regained control of Ogaden and the coming months will show that the territory is to remain in our hands."
 ogaden.2.desc.SOM: "Our advance has forced the Ethiopians from their positions, and our troops have liberated the many scattered towns of Ogaden. While the enemy is doubtlessly preparing a counterattack at the moment, it is our duty to hold and show true Somali resolve."
 ogaden.2.a: "This is a testament to the greatness of our people!"

 ogaden.3.t: "Victory! Ogaden is [ROOT.GetAdjective]"
 ogaden.3.desc.ETH: "In a beautiful display of Ethiopian might, the forces of the Empire have vanquished the Somali foes. We have once and for all shown that we are just as capable of defending our borders as the Imperial Powers of Europe."
 ogaden.3.desc.SOM: "The Ethiopian forces have met a decisive defeat and given up any further hostilities over Ogaden. It is no question that this will be it for good."
 ogaden.3.a: "Wonderful!"
 ogaden.3.b: "Why end it here?"

 ogaden.4.t: "Ogaden Under Attack"
 ogaden.4.desc.ETH: "In a bold move, the daring Somalians have attacked us in an attempt to reclaim what they consider their stolen land. We have beaten them once, we will beat them again!"
 ogaden.4.desc.SOM: "The Ethiopians are launching another expedition against us! It's as if they're trying to relive the glory days of the 1860s!"
 ogaden.4.a: "Hold the Line!"

 ogaden.5.t: "[ROOT.GetAdjective] Forces on the Retreat"
 ogaden.5.desc.ETH: "Our forces have been forced to abandon their positions, but we are perfectly capable of returning from this setback."
 ogaden.5.desc.SOM: "The Ethiopians have made a bold move, pushing us out of the disputed territories. This is not a defeat, but a strategic retreat. It is clear that it is us who will come out on top in the end."
 ogaden.5.a: "Muster a Counterattack!"

 ogaden.6.t: "Ogaden Under [FROM.GetAdjective] Control"
 ogaden.6.desc.ETH: "It has become increasingly clear that we have underestimated Somali readiness to defend Ogaden. Our ill-prepared and costly offence must come to an end, its goals unaccomplished. May future attempts prove more successful."
 ogaden.6.desc.SOM: "The Ethiopians are holding steady, and attempts to dislodge them have proven unsuccessful. It is time we admit to ourselves that this war is lost."
 ogaden.6.desc.war: "Not only have we been unable to stop the enemy forces, they are dead-set on advancing deeper into our territory."
 ogaden.6.a: "We will return!"
 ogaden.6.b: "Defend at all costs!"
