 EGY_levant_crisis_mission_desc: "Compared to the Ottomans, our infrastructure is insufficient for a prolonged war. We must strike swiftly and decisively, ending the conflict before the enemy can regroup and fortify their defences."
 OTT_levant_crisis_mission: "Halt the Egyptian Advance"
 OTT_levant_crisis_mission_desc: "The General Staff is in disarray over the Levant Crisis, but one thing is certain: the Egyptian Army cannot sustain a prolonged war against us. A defense-in-depth strategy can wear them down, forcing them to overextend their lines - but we must turn the tide before they threaten the heartland."

### Operation Abu'l-A'war events
 palabu.1.t: "Operation Abu'l-A'war"
 palabu.1.d: "Faced with the insurmountable naval dominance of the Ottoman fleet, military theorists have in cooperation with Communard attachés developed a proposal to even the playing field. As an all-out attack on the Ottoman naval station would be impossible, a more radical plan has been formed.\n\nDuring the first hours of the war, in an attempt to catch the Ottomans off guard, a detachment of naval bombers would be sent to strike the Ottoman fleet near its station at Beirut. This would subsequently be followed up by a rapid push through the Sinai and Palestine (with the assistance of Syrian cells). It is a bold plan but should it work might even persuade the Greek government to take a side and keep the Turks busy in the Aegean."
 palabu.1.a: "Operation Abu'l-A'war is a go!"

 palabu.2.t: "The Blackburn Baffin"
 palabu.2.d: "The pinnacle of British Engineering, the Blackburn Baffin is a bi-plane naval bomber used in the Union of Britain. With preparations for operation Abu'l-A'war proceeding, the government of [ENG.GetLeader] has given the order to sell some of these planes to the Royal Army.\n\nTheir reliability goes without saying but many are questioning whether the planes will be able to resist Ottoman anti-air defences or their own modern and German-based airplanes."
 palabu.2.a: "Buy 30 of them."
 palabu.2.b: "This whole plan seems a waste of our resources..."

 palabu.3.t: "Successful Raid on Beirut"
 palabu.3.d: "Flying out under the cover of darkness, 20 Baffins successfully bombed the Ottoman fleet in its bases at Beirut. Taken by complete surprise as Turkish military command did not expect the Egyptian army to possess naval bombers, the damage was severe. Nonetheless losses were heavy on the Egyptian side as anti-air emplacements shot down 8 of the planes before they could drop their torpedoes with a further 7 failing to withdraw.\n\nAs the morning sun rose over the harbour, the gravity of the raid started to sink in. The former flagship of the Ottoman navy and pride of the Weltkrieg, the Yavuz Sultan Selim-i Evvel, received two direct hits and coupled with the damage endured during the last war was not able to remain afloat. The Sultan Abdulhamid-i Sani and Istanköy also received heavy blows, knocking them out of action for at least six months.\n\nThe attack which many deemed a certain failure has instead become a colossal victory for the Egyptians, causing great consternation from the Greek government and sending shockwaves as far as Cyprus."
 palabu.3.ott: "We will avenge our fallen brothers!"
 palabu.3.egy: "Onwards to final victory!"

 palabu.4.t: "Failed Raid on Beirut"
 palabu.4.d: "Sixteen Baffins would leave their base on the Mediterranean in the early morning and only 1 would return unscathed. The catastrophe started right at the beginning when instead of the planned 20 only 16 were able to take off. Those that did successfully depart would see their numbers further reduced when heavy weather blew them out of course and towards the Palestinian harbour of Haifa. Mistaking a German freighter for an Ottoman destroyer and intercepted by an Ottoman fighter squadron, 5 more planes were shot out of the sky with no damage to military installations. The remaining 11 quickly turned North in an attempt to reach Beirut but Turkish pilots succeeded in shutting down their attack. A singular bi-plane was able to return unscathed to its base near Alexandria after it broke away from the main squadron following the failed raid on Haifa.\n\nMany had expected that a successful attack would be highly unlikely but with such a crushing defeat dealt to the Egyptian air force, morale has taken a plunge. The cat is out of the bag however and as gendarmerie in Haifa inspects the damage, Egyptian troops cross the Suez. War has arrived at last."
 palabu.4.ott: "Tonight we dine in Cairo!"
 palabu.4.egy: "We will never forget their sacrifice!"

### Third Arab Congress
 palcon.1.t: "The Third Arab Congress"
 palcon.1.d: "After the first Arab Congress of 1913 in the buildings of the Parisian Société de Géographie, the Arab nationalist movement has seen a steady rise. Changing from the initially reformist ideas ushered by its founders who wanted to tackle the status of Arab within the Ottoman Empire, the Second Arab Congress of 1927 showed the new direction the wind was blowing. Hosted in Cairo just after the successful Egyptian revolution and Ottoman betrayal at the Suez, the dialogue was now controlled by radicals and greater Arab nationalists. Members of Al-Fatat, Hashemite exiles, Algerian revolutionaries, Palestinian desperados all came to the gathering to definitively shift the ideas of Arab nationalism. With the Italian threat dealt with and British presence in the Middle East almost fully eradicated due to the actions of Arab heroes in 1925, attention now shifted back to the Turks.\n\nAlthough the Second Congress didn't get any further than a few strongly worded letters and resolutions no one cared about, this is no longer true. The collapse of the German economy and the growing political instability in the Ottoman Empire have created a new sense of urgency across the entire Middle East. This Third Arab Congress will ultimately be little but a thinly masked attempt to combine all Arab efforts and eradicate the Turkish presence within the Mashriq. From Libya to the sands of the Arabian desert, many anxiously await the course our new King will set."
 palcon.1.a: "Send out the invitations"

 palcon.2.t: "Invitation to the Third Arab Congress"
 palcon.2.d: "Organised by the Egyptian government in Cairo, the Third Arab Congress plans to unite all Arab struggles and determine the direction it needs to go in. With much of the Mashriq still suffering under the rule of the Sublime Porte and with the Arabs of the Maghreb living in a French slave state, it is clear that we as the only independent Arab powers need to combine our strengths and strive for the liberation of our brethren."
 palcon.2.a: "To Cairo we go!"

 palcon.3.t: "[FROM.GetName] Has Accepted Our Invitation"
 palcon.3.d: "As the inhabitants of the only other independent Arab state and with the Porte greatly interested in its dealings, the government of [FROM.GetLeader] has sent his representatives to Cairo. Interested to see whether we will turn our words into actions, an important member of the dynasty was sent with them to add gravitas to the discussion."
 palcon.3.a: "Welcome!"

 palcon.4.t: "Yemen Sends Representatives"
 palcon.4.d: "Despite serving as a de jure part of the Sublime Porte and refusing to assist during the Arab Revolt of 1916, it is no secret that the Yemeni foster little warm feelings for their government in Kostantiniye. Imam [YEM.GetLeader] has therefore sent his own representative to Cairo despite a warning of the Porte not to do so.\n\nUnlike some of our other Arab allies however, Yemen does not share our ambitions and remains focused inwards. Should the Ottoman government offer them a better deal than us, it would surprise no one that the Imam would bail on our plans."
 palcon.4.a: "At least they came..."

 palcon.5.t: "Iran Sends a Delegation"
 palcon.5.d: "Despite not receiving an invitation to the Conference in protest to the treatment of the Khuzestan Arabs under the new government, Iran has decided to send a delegation to Cairo.\n\nA protest in the streets of Cairo, organised by Iraqi political exiles and with support from the Ittihad party, was unable to deter King Farouk I who stressed the importance of Islamic solidarity in these trying times. After a short kerfuffle, the delegation was granted a seat at the table in the hopes of encouraging an open debate."
 palcon.5.a: "We welcome the right honourable gentlemen from Teheran"
 palcon.5.b: "We deserved that seat on the table!"

 palcon.6.t: "Idris I Arrives in Cairo"
 palcon.6.d: "Leader of the Senussi order and opponent of the Ottoman-backed Ahmed Sharif I, the exiled Idris has arrived in Cairo. Backing the Entente during the Weltkrieg in their struggles on Libyan ground, the leader of the Senussi order was forced to flee into Egypt when the Italian front collapsed. By many Libyans he is however still seen as the legitimate ruler of their nation and over the years he has steadily been preparing resistance cells for his return."
 palcon.6.a: "A true hero!"

 palcon.7.t: "The Delegation from Syria Takes the Floor"
 palcon.7.d: "Representing the secret organisations of Beirut and Damascus, a variety of political exiles from the Greater Syria region have attended the conference to attack Ottoman practices in their native home. The Palestinian issue featured most prominently in their speeches as they see the continued existence of the M.O.J. as a slap in the face of Muslims across the world. Syria has to be freed from Turkish tutelage which serves nothing but the treasury of [OTT.GetLeader].\n\nLess radicalised speakers were also given the floor, with even Maronite Arabs allowed to give their say on the matter. Preaching a dialogue between the various people of the Greater Syrian region and even considering an arrangement with the Jewish settlers, the debate became quite heated. After a representative from Jaffa threw a sandal at his colleague from Aleppo, a short recess was announced and the perpetrator removed from the room."
 palcon.7.a: "We support the Syrian people!"

 palcon.8.t: "The Delegation from Iraq Takes the Floor"
 palcon.8.d: "After the speaker from Jerusalem finished his speech about the threat that Zionism poses to us all, the floor was granted to the delegation from Iraq. Announcing their support for our brethren in Palestine, they urged the people in the room to not ignore a second threat to the Arab people. The Iranian nation may be trying to paint itself as a friend of the Arabs but it goes without saying that it only does so to weaken its rival in Anatolia and exploit the Iraqi Arabs after the sand has settled.\n\nBefore the representative from Mosul could finish his speech however, the Iranian delegation rose up to protest against their accusations. Should we not focus on our common enemies instead of creating new ones before the first one has been dealt with? As the temperature in the room for the second time rapidly started rising, another brief recess was announced."
 palcon.8.a: "To a free and Arab Iraq!"

 palcon.9.t: "Ghazi ibn Faisal Attends the Conference"
 palcon.9.d: "Son of Arab hero Faisal ibn Hussein who commanded the Hashemite forces during their revolt in 1916, Ghazi ibn Faisal was sent to Egypt in 1920 by his grandfather Sharif Hussein when Ottoman troops marched on Mecca. Taken under the wing of Fuad I, the shy and inexperienced boy became a rallying point for Hashemite sympathisers who fled Hejaz when the Ottoman wali was installed.\n\nUsed to a life of luxury at the Egyptian court, with his various escapades published in the papers, many Hejazi see him as disillusioned and removed from the political realities of the region. His calls for a second Hejazi Revolt and an Arab state stretching from Mecca to Baghdad, whilst very passionate and only briefly interrupted by a poem he wrote to honour his father, have been almost entirely disregarded by the other representatives. When his speech was finally over all representatives clapped politely."
 palcon.9.a: "We honour the Hashemite heroes!"

 palcon.10.t: "Farouk I Condemns the Zionist Settlers"
 palcon.10.d: "After hearing the tragic accounts of Palestinian Arabs suffering at the hands of the international gendarmerie and seeing the latest 'data' on Jewish immigration, King Farouk I finally took to the stage. Condemning the vile deeds his brothers of the faith had to endure, he promised the Syrian delegation his full support and promised that the Palestinian people would soon be liberated. A grand applause followed when all representatives gave him a standing ovation.\n\nNews of his speech was received less well by the significant Jewish community in Egypt itself. These Jews who enjoy fairly good living conditions and political freedom under the Egyptian state, are now afraid that this open attack on the 'Jewish menace' in Palestine could send shockwaves in their direction."
 palcon.10.a: "We support the Palestinian people!"

 palcon.11.t: "Idris Pleads for Help"
 palcon.11.d: "After the speech of Farouk I, the conference has taken a different turn. The charade of a cultural conference to celebrate the Arab people has been replaced with the open discussion of actions to be undertaken against those that threaten the Arab people.\n\nThe exiled Libyan leader Idris I has been building up support for well over a decade and with Ottoman garrisons in Libya becoming careless as heated political debate overtakes the capital, he plans to strike within the year and oust Ahmed Sharif I. Hearing all the kind and passionate words from the other representatives, it is now time to turn these into guns, manpower and donations to ensure his struggle is successful."
 palcon.11.a: "We support Idris!"
 palcon.11.b: "We can't spare anything."

 palcon.12.t: "The Egyptian Ambitions"
 palcon.12.d: "With representatives from all corners of the Arab world brought together in Cairo, the time has come to show our hands and dictate the course we will be setting. We will have to tread carefully as the multitude of political groups and resistance cells which our operation relies on if we want to keep the Arab states united behind us after their liberation."
 palcon.12.a: "Egypt strives for the incorporation of the Levant."
 palcon.12.b: "Egypt wishes to liberate the Arab people!"

 palcon.13.t: "Egypt Announces Its Goals"
 palcon.13.d: "With representatives from all corners of the Arab world brought together in Cairo, Egypt has finally dropped the curtain on its grand designs. As some had already feared - and others hoped - [EGY.GetLeader] has announced his ambitions to incorporate the Levant within his Kingdom. The matter of Iraq was left open but hinting at the creation of a friendly Arab regime in the region. Hejaz would furthermore be ceded to their allies on the peninsula as a payment for their help in the coming war.\n\nMany of the Syrian delegation left the conference in anger as they claim that this is just putting Syria under new management instead of granting it the self-government its people are so clearly demanding. Hejazis are not too keen either on the scheme as they see their brethren of the Arab Desert as underdeveloped and uncultured barbarians who will do more bad than good to the relatively rich coastland."
 palcon.13.a: "Let's hope their hubris won't be our downfall."

 palcon.14.t: "Egypt Announces Its Goals"
 palcon.14.d: "With representatives from all corners of the Arab world brought together in Cairo, Egypt has finally dropped the curtain on its grand designs. Promoting self-government amongst the Arab states, they will strive to retain the various constituents of Arabia as individual units that can decide on their own whether to join a larger Arab state.\n\nRepresentatives from Iraq, Syria and Hejaz are pleased that they will retain the right to determine their future but on the Peninsula enthusiasm is far less high. Not only would they see no rewards from their participation in the war but furthermore they would have to contend with a powerful Hejazi state."
 palcon.14.a: "This will be interesting, to say the least."

 palcon.15.t: "Iran Leaves the Conference"
 palcon.15.d: "As the final resolution of the Conference seems to imply an independent Iraq free from Iranian influence, the Iranian delegation has left in anger. Whether this will impact their decision to take part in the war with the Sublime Porte or - Allah forbid - take the Turkish side remains unclear but it has left a sour taste."
 palcon.15.a: "They weren't invited anyhow!"
 palcon.15.b: "Reason is not something the Arabs understand!"

 palcon.17.t: "Creation of the Cairo Pact"
 palcon.17.d: "Enclosed in the final resolution of the Conference, there is the promise by all attendants to join arms should any of them end up at war with the Turks. This resolution which lays the foundation of a military alliance, has been called the 'Cairo Pact' and marks the creation of the first such treaty in Modern Arab history."
 palcon.17.a: "We will join the Cairo Pact in due time."
 palcon.17.b: "We refrain from signing."
 palcon.17.c: "To a prosperous Arabia!"
 palcon.17.e: "We will join as soon as we can."

 palcon.18.t: "The Conference Draws to an End"
 palcon.18.d: "As the sun sets on the Nile, Farouk I closes the conference with another speech. Thanking all representatives for their attendance, it is to all apparent what a formidable display of Egyptian power this really was. Arabs from all groups and social standings have come to be awed by the wealth of Egypt and revel in the freedom that this truly independent Arab state provides. Furthermore Egypt has attempted to unite the different forces in the region and push them all towards an ideology most favourable to the Egyptian state itself."
 palcon.18.a: "Look at those fireworks!"

 palcon.19.t: "Attend the Third Arab Congress?"
 palcon.19.d: "Hosted by the predominant Arab power, the Kingdom of Egypt, it has long become clear to us that just like us Cairo has been trying to gauge Ottoman responsiveness and its possible strength in a future conflict.\n\nAlthough we have not received an invitation to their grand Arab Congress, it may be necessary for us to force entry to the negotiations if we are to have a voice on the future status of Iraq and the Mashriq in its entirety."
 palcon.19.a: "Send a delegation to Cairo!"
 palcon.19.b: "It is pretty clear that they do not want our presence."

 palcon.20.t: "The Cairo Congress"
 palcon.20.d: "Leaders of many countries within the Middle east from [PER.GetNameDef] to Arabia to Cyrenaica have gathered in Cairo to discuss the Ottoman issue.\n\nMany predict that Egypt will dominate the Congress as she lays out a plan for the Middle East without the Ottoman Empire. However, time will tell if this will be just sowing the seeds for conflict or peace."
 palcon.20.a: "I wonder where I've seen this before..."

### News Events ###
 levant_crisis_news.1.t: "Levant Crisis"
 levant_crisis_news.1.d: "Arab nationalism and Turkish imperialism have finally found themselves at odds as talks over the Sinai-Palestine issue have collapsed after Egypt marched its army through the Sinai desert. Nominally united until 1914, the two leading powers in the Middle East are now set on a course to decide the destiny of the region. Even as the Egyptians can count on an array of allies in the other Arab states, many fear that it won't be enough as the military and economic capacity of the Turkish Empire for now still vastly outclasses that of its rival.\n\nForeign investors are watching the conflict with fear, as the oil reservoirs of the Middle East have become more important than ever with the collapse of authority in the United States."
 levant_crisis_news.1.a: "But what about the oil?"
 levant_crisis_news.1.b: "We can't let the Empire fall."

 levant_crisis_news.2.t: "Rebellion in the Yemen"
 levant_crisis_news.2.d: "The Weltkrieg caused tremendous damage to the already struggling Ottoman Empire. Large sections of the Arabian peninsula were cut off from the Sublime Porte's rule for years due to the successes of the Arab Revolt. All the same, with the Treaty of Versailles the Yemeni vilayet was to some extent brought back under Ottoman rule - at least in theory.\nFor many years Yemen has mostly run its own affairs, with the Sultan's gaze fixed firmly on his own domestic troubles. With conflict erupting in the Suez and across the Holy Land, the Yemen has once more been cut off from the bulk of the Ottoman army. Taking advantage of this opportunity, combined with perceptible weakness of the Ottoman state, the Imam has publicly declared the creation of a new independent kingdom."
 levant_crisis_news.2.a: "Another blow to the Sultan."

 levant_crisis_news.3.t: "The Cypriot Rebellion"
 levant_crisis_news.3.d: "Returned to Turkish rule in the aftermath of the British collapse, the predominately Greek Orthodox island of Kibris or Cyprus never had a good relation with the Porte. Their secession movement which has as its sole purpose Enosis (reunification with Greece) has been steadily gaining support and power over the last few years until it culminated earlier today with an open assault on the governor offices of the Ottoman administration.\n\nLed by Archbishop Leontios II, the island has been shaken up by violence and terrorism as agents from the Greek government have started to infiltrate the island to aid the rebels."
 levant_crisis_news.3.a: "How much more can the Ottomans endure?"
 levant_crisis_news.3.b: "Those pesky Greeks."

 levant_crisis_news.4.t: "The Second Arab Revolt"
 levant_crisis_news.4.d: "Home of the First Arab Revolt under Sharif Hussein ibn Ali, the people of the Hejaz have once more risen up against their Turkish overlords. Unlike similar movements in Syria however, it is far less likely that this revolt will see much success as hawks from the Arab interior look onto what they see as an easy prey.\n\nTalks with Egypt concerning possible entry to the Cairo Pact have been started but it is likely that their entry will be vetoed by other ambitious Arab warlords."
 levant_crisis_news.4.a: "Let us hope they have more success this time."
 levant_crisis_news.4.b: "They will be crushed!"

 levant_crisis_news.5.t: "The Great Syrian Revolt"
 levant_crisis_news.5.d: "Buckled under Turkish rule, the Arab people of Greater Syria have finally decided to throw off the yoke and have joined their Arab brethren in Cairo. Fighting for the liberation of the Mashriq and the creation of a new, Arab, Middle East, Syrians from all religions and ethnic groups are uniting to rid themselves of Turkish rule.\n\nAmbitions of individual leaders and disagreements between the various partners of the Cairo Pact however may lead to issues should the common threat be dealt with as the ideas of Greater Syrian independence aren't compatible with Farouk's designs of an Arab state ruled from Cairo."
 levant_crisis_news.5.a: "Another blow to the Sublime Porte."
 levant_crisis_news.5.b: "Their cause is hopeless."

 levant_crisis_news.6.t: "War over Khasab"
 levant_crisis_news.6.d: "An enclave of the Muscati state, the peninsula of Khasab is one of the most crucial positions in the Middle East. Singlehandedly having the capacity to completely cut off the strait of Hormuz, thus cutting Iran and Iraq off from the worlds economy, it has been a thorn in the side of both [TUR.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] and Tehran.\n\nNaval manoeuvres by the Persian fleet around the Strait have led to a rise in tensions, culminating in the military occupation of the enclave by Teheran which has prompted an ultimatum from the Sublime Porte. Receiving no answer, the Ottoman fleet opened fire on Khasab in the early morning, as such commencing hostilities between the two regional powers."
 levant_crisis_news.6.a: "The Middle East descends further into chaos."

 levant_crisis_news.7.t: "The Barzinji Insurrection"
 levant_crisis_news.7.d: "Leader of two failed attempts in Sulaymanyiah to carve out a Kurdish kingdom, the infamous Sheikh Mahmud Barzinji has once more declared the independence of his Kurdish state, drawing support from various tribes in Sulaymaniyah. Although a ceasefire was brokered between Tehran and [TUR.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], limiting support for Kurdish movements on either side of the border, it seems Iran has pulled out of the agreement.\n\nDespite foreign support, it seems unlikely that Mahmuds revolt will succeed as even amongst the Kurdish tribes, few see him as the legitimate ruler of Kurdistan."
 levant_crisis_news.7.a: "Good luck!"
 levant_crisis_news.7.b: "Without allies, they are lost."

 levant_crisis_news.8.t: "War over the Shatt-al-Arab"
 levant_crisis_news.8.d: "Signed in 1913 under the guidance of the British and Russian attachés to Constantinople and Tehran, the Shatt-al-Arab protocol was supposed to solve the centuries old border conflict between the Ottoman and Persian Empire by delineating the Tigris-Euphrates delta.\n\nClaiming the treaty as unjust and favouring the Ottomans, Iran has issued an ultimatum to the Turks demanding a large swath of land \"to secure Persian interests.\" [TUR.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] has ignored the ultimatum, claiming the 1913 protocols were already too generous. Receiving no answer, Persian troops subsequently started the bombardment of Fao Fortress, initiating open war against the Turks."
 levant_crisis_news.8.a: "Another Persian-Ottoman war for the\nhistory books..."

 levant_crisis_news.9.t: "The Armenian Uprising"
 levant_crisis_news.9.d: "Serving under Ottoman military occupation for close to two decades, the Armenian resistance has used the war between [TUR.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] and Tehran to reassert Armenian independence, driving out the Ottoman garrison and raising their flag in rebellion.\n\nAlthough many question the viability of the revolt, stuck between a rock and a hard place, their courage and determination has not gone unnoticed abroad with many nations in the socialist bloc immediately recognising their independence."
 levant_crisis_news.9.a: "Good luck!"
 levant_crisis_news.9.b: "Nothing but a distraction."
