 international_workers_olympiad_events.2.d: "Today, the 1937 International Workers' Olympiad has been opened in [iwo_host_city]. The ceremony was attended by dignitaries and athletes from the entire socialist world. After a parade through the host city, a mass gymnastics event followed that ended up drawing a crowd of tens of thousands of people. Over the next few days, athletes both local and from abroad will participate in countless events such as Athletics, Cycling and Football.\n\nOrganised by the Socialist Workers' Sport International, the I.W.O. is conceived as the antithesis of the bourgeois Olympic games: where theirs are a showcase of elitist competition, our Games are based on mass-participation and friendship between our peoples. That difference in conception has sure shown its effect in the attendance numbers!"
