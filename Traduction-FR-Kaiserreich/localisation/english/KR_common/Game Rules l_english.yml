 ### Game Rules ###
 RULE_GROUP_KAISERREICH_RULES: "General"

 RULE_WK2_BEGIN_OPTIONS: "Early Second Weltkrieg"
 RULE_OPTION_RESTRICTED: "Restricted"
 RULE_WK2_BEGIN_OPTIONS_RESTRICTED_DESC: "Almost all paths which could lead to war breaking out between the Reichspakt and the Third Internationale before 1939 are blocked, even if this means early confrontations between the two always result in one party backing down."
 RULE_OPTION_RARE: "Rare"
 RULE_WK2_BEGIN_OPTIONS_RARE_DESC: "Paths which could lead to war breaking out between the Reichspakt and the Third Internationale before 1939 aren't blocked, but the chances that they'll lead to war are very small."
 RULE_OPTION_UNRESTRICTED: "Unrestricted"
 RULE_WK2_BEGIN_OPTIONS_UNRESTRICTED_DESC: "Any early confrontation between the Reichspakt and the Third Internationale could mean a breakout of the Second Weltkrieg, based on the chances involved in any event chain. This means early wars happen frequently."

 RULE_UNIT_LIMIT_OPTIONS: "Division Limits"
 RULE_OPTION_STANDARD: "Applies to All"
 RULE_UNIT_LIMIT_OPTIONS_STANDARD_DESC: "Limits have been applied to how many divisions the AI can build, based on their factory counts and economy law level. Once the AI hits this limit, they simply stop building new divisions. This limit also applies to a player, though for them it's a soft cap and they receive a malus based on how far over the limit they build.\n\n§RNote that this is a system put in place to reduce the inevitable slowdown that happens as a game goes on, as the sheer number of divisions in action is the primary cause of system lag.§!"
 RULE_UNIT_LIMIT_OPTIONS_AI_ONLY: "Applies to AI Only"
 RULE_UNIT_LIMIT_OPTIONS_AI_ONLY_DESC: "Limits have been applied to how many divisions the AI can build, based on their factory counts and economy law level. Once the AI hits this limit, they simply stop building new divisions. At this setting, there is no limit to how many divisions a player may build other than their ability to supply manpower and equipment.\n\n§RNote that this puts the player at a considerable advantage against AI countries that would otherwise be of comparable strengths.§!"
 RULE_OPTION_TURN_OFF: "Turn Off"
 RULE_UNIT_LIMIT_OPTIONS_TURN_OFF_DESC: "This turns off the division limit system completely.\n\n§RIt is suggested you only do this if you either don't mind game speeds getting much slower as the game goes on, or you have a VERY hefty computer to run the game.§!"

 RULE_DEMOB_OPTIONS: "Peacetime Demobilisation"
 RULE_OPTION_DEMOB_EXISTS: "Default"
 RULE_OPTION_DEMOB_EXISTS_DESC: "When at peace, the player is prompted to reduce their economy and/or conscription laws to levels allowed in peacetime and according to their $MODIFIER_WAR_SUPPORT_FACTOR$ within four months. The AI does the same, though they do so more quickly and tend to reduce their laws to lower levels than the player is required to. If unit limits apply to the AI, this also tends to prompt them to reduce the number of units they have active for performance reasons."
 RULE_OPTION_DEMOB_AI_ONLY: "Applies to AI Only"
 RULE_OPTION_DEMOB_AI_ONLY_DESC: "In peacetime, the AI reduces their economy and/or conscription laws. If unit limits apply to the AI, this also prompts them to reduce the number of units they have active for performance reasons. The player, however, is never be prompted to reduce their laws."
 RULE_OPTION_DEMOB_OFF: "Turn Off"
 RULE_OPTION_DEMOB_OFF_DESC: "Neither the player nor the AI are ever be prompted to reduce their economy and/or conscription laws in peacetime.\n\n§RIt is suggested you only do this if you either don't mind game speeds getting much slower as the game goes on, or you have a VERY hefty computer to run the game.§!"

 RULE_CONFERENCE_OPTIONS: "Peace Conferences"
 RULE_OPTION_CONFERENCE_STANDARD: "Default"
 RULE_OPTION_CONFERENCE_STANDARD_DESC: "The AI takes states in a peace conference based on its cores, claims, ambitions, and whether it can reach them."
 RULE_OPTION_CONFERENCE_PLAYER_PRIMACY: "Player Primacy"
 RULE_OPTION_CONFERENCE_PLAYER_PRIMACY_DESC: "The AI refuses to take any states in a peace conference if it involves a player on the winning side. Note that, once this Game Rule is active, a debug decision appears which allows the player the option of turning this effect off and back on throughout the game."

 KR_STATE_TRANSFER_TOOL_OPTIONS: "State & Country Transfer Tool"
 RULE_OPTION_STATE_TRANSFER_TOOL_STANDARD: "Inactive"
 RULE_OPTION_STATE_TRANSFER_TOOL_STANDARD_DESC: "The State & Country Transfer Tool is deactivated, and no user interface for it is visible. Note that this has no effect if the debug option is set in the HoI4 launcher - if it is, then the State Transfer Tool can always be activated by the debug decision."
 RULE_OPTION_STATE_TRANSFER_TOOL_ACTIVE: "Active"
 RULE_OPTION_STATE_TRANSFER_TOOL_ACTIVE_DESC: "The single player version of the State & Country Transfer Tool is be active by default, and its custom GUI visible when any state is clicked (unless removed from view with Ctrl-S or deactivated by the debug decision). This allows states to be transferred between any existing countries, and all cores added or removed.\n\n§RUse at your own risk!§!"
 RULE_OPTION_STATE_TRANSFER_TOOL_MULTIPLAYER: "Multiplayer - Standard"
 RULE_OPTION_STATE_TRANSFER_TOOL_MULTIPLAYER_DESC: "This multiplayer version of the State & Country Transfer Tool is active by default. It works as the single player version, save that only states belonging to the player or one of their puppets (with some puppets ineligible, in situations where they could rebel against the player later in the game) may be marked and no cores can be added or removed.\n\n§RUse at your own risk!§!"
 RULE_OPTION_STATE_TRANSFER_TOOL_MP_NO_SUBJECT: "Multiplayer - No Subject Transfer"
 RULE_OPTION_STATE_TRANSFER_TOOL_MP_NO_SUBJECT_DESC: "Works the same as the multiplayer version, save that no subject states can be marked.\n\n§RUse at your own risk!§!"

 # El Daddy's general principles for Game Rules / Country Paths
 #    Path Rules
 #        Any change in ideology should be accessible through TAG_PATH rules and options.
 #        These rules should always be called _PATH, with each option named after the ideology in question.
 #        If more than one leader per ideology and they have unique content, call the option TAG_PATH_SURNAME_IDEOLOGY, if the surname is different and appropriate to use.
 #        The names of the path rule options should be a more informal name of the party, rather than formal name, where appropriate, if one exists, or a more poetic / narriative name, so long as it is not used elsewhere.
 #        Avoid naming path rule options "Liberal Party Wins", or similar, such an option would be "Liberals". Also avoid calling the path rule options the names of national spirits, national foci, or events.
 #        In the option description, try to refer to the political party in their full name in their native language as the ideologically-coloured part of the text.
 #        This is then followed in the text by the English translation of their full name in white.
 #        Try to prioritise the names of political parties themselves for the coloured text, where possible.
 #        The text for the option descriptions should always be written in the present tense and always in the third person.
 #        Avoid "Leader will do xyz", or "attempts to", or "decides to", or "has been", if they can be avoided, as they just waste space.
 #        Options for country leader changes that have no unique content and no ideology change should generally be avoided, other than a few limited circumstances.
 #    Forpol Rules
 #        All faction/alignment choices should have a TAG_FORPOL rule, with the rule called that in the code and "Demonym Foreign Policy" in the text, in all circumstances.
 #        For the names of these options, they should be just named after the faction in question. i.e. "Reichspakt", not "Align with Germany". These should never be narrative names.
 #        Similarly, the code of the rule should be TAG_FORPOL_INT, TAG_FORPOL_GER, TAG_FORPOL_ENT, etc.
 #        The text for the option descriptions should all also be in the third person and present tense.
 #    Rule Restrictions
 #        Generally speaking, rules should allow a country bypass randomness, so that players can determine what option an AI-led country will take.
 #        However, a game rule option should only exist if the AI is capable of making that particular option in default circumstances with no rules enabled.
 #        For instance, if a particular path for a country doesn't ever join a particular faction, then the TAG_FORPOL game rule should not allow that particular path to do so.
 #        This is the case for all variables that are already accounted for and have their own rules. There can be some leniency in other conditions that have no game rules.
 #        For instance, without game rules, a country may not join another faction if the leader of that faction has a certain % surrender progress. Faction game rules can bypass this, as there is no rule for surrender requirements.
 #        Some exceptions are made for the "Boosted" rules, as the other countries that can be invited to these factions may always have joined another faction by the time this rule is chosen.
 #        Since the content to invite these countries to the faction takes these countries into account, but the content of the countries themselves don't take this into account, AI behaviour can be altered differently in these circumstances.
 #        Unless specifically otherwise stated, game rules should not work on the country you are playing as, or participating countries in multi-country content. This is to avoid minigames being cheesed.
 #        There should also not be game rules for tag internal content that does not effect their leader, ideology, or foreign policy.
 #        So there is no need for game rules for mutually exclusive sub-branches of economic or military trees, for instance.
 #    Rule Requirements
 #        In the "Requires" section, generally speaking, they should be seperated by double linebreaks / blank lines into three categories, where applicable.
 #        The first of these are narrative/event requirements, the second, requirements that other game rules are active, and then the third, requirements that other game rules are not active.
 #        There is some slight leeway here in cases where events and then options follow a particular sequence in time.
 #        All potential rules options that are required for another given rule option to work should all be individually listed, unless such a rule option is already mentioned within the requirements of another mentioned rule.
