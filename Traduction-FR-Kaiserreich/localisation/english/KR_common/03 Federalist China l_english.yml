### Leader Descs ###
 QIE_hu_shih_UPC_leader_desc: "§YBorn:§! §LDecember 17th, 1891, in Chuansha, Jiangsu Province, Qing Empire§!\n§YBackground:§! §LA political philosopher and intellectual, Hu Shih originally worked alongside Wu Peifu and the Zhili Clique, hoping that he could influence the Jade Marshal to reform China along more liberal and democratic lines. Hu also tried to get Wu to adapt some of Chen Jiongming's federalist platform into his government. However, Wu would continually frustrate his efforts by refusing to adopt any meaningful federalist measures and even acquiesce to the restoration of the Qing monarchy, an action that Hu protested vigorously.\n\nHu's dreams of a democratic China seemed doomed to failure until Chen Jiongming defied all odds and successfully marched on Beijing. In the aftermath of Chinese unification and the creation of the new constitution, Hu was chosen to lead the Democratic Constitutionalist Party and has now been elected as the new president of the United Provinces of China. An idealist at heart, Hu will do whatever he can to defend the rights of the Chinese people and will ensure that authoritarianism never returns to China.§!"
 QIE_gao_lingwei_UPC_leader_desc: "§YBorn:§! §LSeptember 12th, 1870, in Tianjin County, Zhili Province, Qing Empire§!\n§YBackground:§! §LEarning the Imperial Examination at the age of 25, Gao would become entrapped within Zhang Zhidong's clique, serving as supervisor of the Hubei Armed Forces Academy, General Officer of the Hubei Mint, and later as the province's academic and chief envoy. Resigning in 1910, Gao would return to Tianjin to serve as director of Civil Affairs of Zhili province. In 1913 Gao would supervise the reorganisation of provincial banks, and would serve as director of the Zhili Finance Department and Zhili Taxation Investigation Department.\n\nElected as a member to the new congress in 1917, Gao would serve as deputy minister of agriculture in 1920, becoming the Chief Financial Officer upon the recommendation of Cao Kun. Further wrapped into the intra-politics of the Zhili Clique, Gao would become Chief Minister of Internal Affairs of Liang Shiyi's cabinet and other important positions in Yan Huiqing and Zhou Ziqi's cabinets.\n\nReplacing Cao Rui as governor of Zhili Province, Gao would serve as director-general of agriculture and commerce, Chief of the Interior and in 1923, acting Prime Minister and president. With a brief intermission after the fall of the Zhili, Gao would continue to serve in Cao Kun's cabinet.\n\nFollowing the fall of the Zhili, Gao rallied the remnants of the Beiyang government, across both sides of the Shanhaiguan Pass, to form a bloc of northern opposition to southern antics. Nominated by the Democratic Constitutionalist Party, this refined, studious and diligent politician won with flying colours. Once again president of a Chinese republic, it would appear that the legacy of Beiyang is here to stay, Federalism or not.§!"
 UPC_zhang_junmai_leader_desc: "§YBorn:§! §LJanuary 18th, 1887, in Jiading, Jiangsu Province, Qing Empire§!\n§YBackground:§! §LInterested in politics as a young adult, Zhang Junmai would go abroad to Japan to study political economics. It was in Japan that Zhang met fellow reformists Liang Qichao and Zhang Dongsun, men that he would be affiliated with for the rest of his life. The three men would lead efforts to democratise the fledgling Chinese republic established after the Xinhai Revolution, but warlords in the government would hamper their efforts. Zhang attempted to ingratiate himself to premier Duan Qirui to no avail.\n\nRecognising his efforts to be futile, Zhang left the government and went to Europe. In the following years, Zhang would lecture at Tsinghua University, especially criticising the materialist worldview of marxism with his idealist lens. Zhang would even cooperate with Young China Party co-founder Li Huang in founding the “New Road” magazine. In 1931, Zhang would grow increasingly frustrated with the ruling Zhili Clique and found the Chinese Democratic League in Guangzhou under the protection of Governor Chen Jiongming.\n\nSupporting Chen's aspirations for a free China since then, it was no surprise that the China Democratic League would be elevated to second only to Chen's Public Interest Party in his Grand Republican League. With the league no longer needed and the unification of China under a free government finished, it was only natural that Zhang ran for the office of presidency. His victory not only demonstrates the institutional strength of China's new multi party democracy, but also a recognition of the efforts of all democratic minded republicans across China.§!"
 YUN_tang_jiyao_UPC_leader_desc: "§YBorn:§! §LAugust 14th, 1883, in Qujing, Yunnan Province, Qing Empire§!\n§YBackground:§! §LA loyal follower of General Cai E, Tang began his political career in 1911, when Cai E ordered him to take part in the Wuchang Uprising, beginning the Xinhai Revolution. After the success of the revolution, he became governor of Guizhou and would later return to his home province of Yunnan in 1913 to replace Cai E. When Yuan Shikai announced his ambitions of becoming an Emperor, Tang immediately seceded with the support of the likes of Cai E and Li Liejun, who would spearhead the National Protection War alongside Tang. With their victory in the National Protection War, Yunnan became one of the main hegemons of the continent.\n\nHowever, Yunnan's glory days have long since faded away. Tang led one failed expedition after another, with his failure in defeating Sichuan causing him to almost be deposed by Gu Pinzhen in a coup d'etat in 1921 - thus, the failure of the Northern Expedition became a blessing for Tang's control over Yunnan. Tang continued his cooperation with Chen Jiongming and the Public Interest Party following the collapse of the league, and played a crucial role in the unification wars that followed. As the co-founder of the PIP alongside Chen, it only made sense for Tang to be Chen's successor as leader of the party. A man of startling contradictions but with a grounded set of ideals, Tang will ensure that the UPC will both respect federalist principles but also maintain a strong central government.§!"

The ungrateful fools of the party decided instead to choose Chen Qiyou as their leader, infuriating Tang. Tang would instead assume leadership of the Democratic Constitutionalist Party and win the presidency from that avenue. While the PIP may have betrayed him, Tang continues to hold to his ideals of a democratic federal republic that sports a capable central government.§!"

### Decisions ###
 UPC_mopping_up: "Dealing with Separatists"
 UPC_mopping_up_desc: "China's periphery has always been more loosely integrated into the central government and have a violent history of uprisings, ethnic tensions, and separatism. During the Civil War, a couple of states attempted to break away from the Central Government and declared their independence. While few in China want to recognise them, reintegrating them may be more difficult than it is worth just to appease Han chauvinist attitudes. Either way, we must make a decision whether to recognise them or reel them back."

 UPC_retake_periphery: "[FROM.GetFlag] Crush [FROM.GetAdjective] Separatists"
 UPC_retake_periphery_desc: "[UPC_crush_separatist_tag]"

 UPC_crush_separatist_MON: "Outer Mongolia was lost back in 1911 and our Republic's founder was one of the many voices demanding an expedition to retake it by force at the time. We cannot accept their terrible regime in our periphery; the Mongolian people itself should be in charge, and we can give it to them without our Federation."
 UPC_crush_separatist_MAN: "The Northeast Provinces were snatched away from us from dastardly imperialists while we conducted our democratic revolution. As a core part of China, we must reconquer the lost frontier and liberate its people from their foreign puppet master."
 UPC_crush_separatist_KUM: "The Kumul Khanate is an anachronism, and that is putting it nicely. Leftovers from a bygone era, dedicated to the Manchu Monarchy that we finally rid ourselves of once and for all. Their remnants will be destroyed, and the region will finally see freedom and modernity instead of serfdom, oppression and backwardness."
 UPC_crush_separatist_ETS: "The religious fundamentalists of Xinjiang, fuelled by ethnic separatism, are a stain to China's honour. We cannot trust the Uyghur to be fair and just watchmen of the Northwestern frontier, for they are drunk on ethnic nationalism and Islamic fundamentalism in a multicultural land. It will be a difficult task, but Xinjiang must be reintegrated."

 UPC_deal_with_separatists: "[FROM.GetFlag] Negotiate with [FROM.GetNameDef]"
 UPC_deal_with_separatists_desc: "[UPC_deal_with_separatists_tag]"

 UPC_deal_with_separatist_MON: "Outer Mongolia was lost back in 1911. Even if our Republic's founder was one of the many voices calling for a military expedition to retake the autonomy, it is high time to accept the fact that the Outer Mongolians do not want to be part of the Federal Republic. Surely, it is time to start anew, as their twinkling democracy should be a brethren in Asia and not an enemy out of nothing but selfish pride."
 UPC_deal_with_separatist_ETS: "Recognising East Turkestan will be a tough pill to swallow for Xinjiang has been part of China for centuries. Still, if they will not become part of the United Provinces, do we really have an excuse to subjugate them against their will? Surely, their young Republic can become a fellow Asian democracy. Besides, a military expedition would be a hellish adventure considering the distances, poor infrastructure, and fierce militants opposing us."

 UPC_reconstruction_plan: "Reconstruction Plan"
 UPC_reconstruction_plan_desc: "The Reconstruction Plan is the brainchild of Chen Jiongming and the China Public Interest (Zhigong) Party. In the 1920s, the Federalist leader envisioned a country reunified peacefully between the Zhili and Fengtian-dominated North and Kuomintang-dominated South, but this failed, and he instead focused on identifying the causes of the First Republic and the Kuomintang regime's downfall, why neither could solve China's problems, and how to solve said-problems. This included a zealous programme of public works, increased central-provincial cooperation, and demilitarisation to fund it all.\n\nWith China reunited, we can begin rebuilding it into a great power equal to the West."

 UPC_guangzhou_nanning: "Guangzhou-Nanning Railway"
 UPC_guangzhou_nanning_desc: "Guangxi, partly due to its rough terrain and partly due to its relative isolation, is poorly connected with the rest of the country. In order to better integrate Guangdong's sister province and prevent the return of banditry and corruption, a railway connecting Guangzhou and Nanning will be built."
 UPC_improve_hainan: "Hainan Mining Expansion"
 UPC_improve_hainan_desc: "The island of Hainan's economic potential has long been neglected. With new mining technologies and a stable government with a drive for investment, we can rectify this and expand iron mining operations."
 UPC_nanning_guiyang: "Railway to Guizhou"
 UPC_nanning_guiyang_desc: "Guizhou is one of the poorer provinces in the south, but has potential with proper investment. Connecting the province to the growing railway network is the first step towards the goal of brining prosperity to more remote corners of the country."
 UPC_guiyang_kunming: "Extend Line to Kunming"
 UPC_guiyang_kunming_desc: "Yunnan is mountainous and remote, making its integration a difficult process and infrastructure projects expensive. Nevertheless, we must connect it and its bountiful resources to the country."
 UPC_guiyang_chengdu: "Connecting Sichuan"
 UPC_guiyang_chengdu_desc: "Sichuan is one of the southern provinces with significant support for the Federalist cause. Yet, due to its numerous conflicts between its regional cliques and the famine, it is in dire need of help. While the Yangtze has traditionally kept it connected with the east, improving its infrastructure and joining it with the railway network will be able to improve our ability to supply the province and prevent another famine by expanding the amount of freight we can move in and out of Sichuan."
 UPC_guangzhou_changsha: "Expand the Guangzhou-Wuhan Line"
 UPC_guangzhou_changsha_desc: "The Guangzhou-Wuhan Line is the most important railway in the south, connecting the economic capital of the south with the distant Beijing. Expanding the line between Guangzhou and Changsha will help better connect with our friends in Hunan and allow us to move north and maintain important supply links with any operations outside of the south."
 UPC_guangzhou_fujian: "Railway to Fujian"
 UPC_guangzhou_fujian_desc: "Southeastern China is poor and neglected, but Chen Jiongming, as brief governor of Fujian, has a history with the region and hopes to rekindle his old promises to the people of the province. Connecting it with the railway network will allow better communication and transport in one of the south's rougher regions."
 UPC_connect_coast: "Connect the Southeast"
 UPC_connect_coast_desc: "While the northern part of Southeastern China is connected with the north, it is not connected with the south. Building this connection will give us a secure route towards Nanjing and an alternative to the route through Wuhan."
 UPC_changsha_nanjing: "From Guangzhou to Nanjing"
 UPC_changsha_nanjing_desc: "Nanjing is the most important city on the east-central part of China still under Chinese hands. Improving the rail link between it and Guangzhou will both help with supply and transport and prove our ability as nation-builders by improving the connection between two of the most important cities of China."
 UPC_wuhan_bridge: "Bridging the Yangtze"
 UPC_wuhan_bridge_desc: "There is no bridge over the Yangtze in Wuhan, meaning that train wagons have to be ferried across the mighty river. The construction of a rail bridge there has been long considered, but has, thus far, been far too ambitious to complete. Such a feat of engineering, however, has become possible, if expensive. The future Wuhan Yangtze Great Bridge will not merely be a prestige project, but a marvel of engineering that will finally properly connect and unite North and South China, plugging one of the most problematic gaps of the country's infrastructure."
 UPC_wuhan_beijing: "Modernise the Beijing-Wuhan Railway"
 UPC_wuhan_beijing_desc: "The connection between Wuhan, the centre of the Revolution, and Beijing, the old northern capital, is as important as the connection with Nanjing or Guangzhou. The line must be modernised and expanded as the amount of freight needed to be transported through it continues to increase."
 UPC_connect_northwest: "Connect the Northwest"
 UPC_connect_northwest_desc: "The northwestern provinces have long been isolated and rather independent for centuries. Railways have long promised to bridge the extreme distances between the populated coast and the remote frontier, but only now have we finally had the opportunity to finally connect east and west."
 UPC_connect_xinjiang: "Reach Xinjiang"
 UPC_connect_xinjiang_desc: "Naturally, with our railway network reaching the northwestern provinces, the next goal is to reach the even more remote Xinjiang. We cannot allow the region to fall to bandits, rebels, corruption, and foreign imperialists ever again, and a railway to the most remote region of China is the first step in the final integration of China's frontier."

 UPC_foreign_policy: "Federal Foreign Policy"
 UPC_foreign_policy_desc: "The United Provinces of China is the uncontested central government of China and is on the way towards modernisation and prosperity. However, we are fairly isolated and there remain several unequal treaties with other powers. If China is to become a great power, these treaties must be repealed and new treaties signed on the basis of equality of nations. This will be a tough task to do so peacefully, but the Century of Humiliation must end!"

 UPC_repeal_unequal_treaties: "Repeal Unequal Treaties"
 UPC_repeal_unequal_treaties_desc: "It is time for China to reassert herself as a Great Power in her own right. We, from now on, shall be treated as equals. No more unequal treaties! Let us end the Century of Humiliation!"

 UPC_trade_treaty: "Offer Treaty to [FROM.GetNameDef]"
 UPC_trade_treaty_desc: "The imperialists in [FROM.GetNameDef] have refused to accept the new reality that China is to be independent once and for all. We should renew our offer, and perhaps we can put their petty insult behind us as we work for China to be treated as an equal, lest they cling to their colonial attitudes."

However, Tang Jiyao, the co-founder of the party, has made his move. With his clique behind him, he spoke out against \"obvious foreign influences\" and radicalism that stank of the \"treacherous Kuomintang\".

 UPC_Crack_Down_On_Opium_desc: "Opium has been a plague for a century. The Century of Humiliation can only end when the drug has been eradicated.

 UPC_Reform_The_Judiciary: "Reform the Judiciary"
 UPC_Reform_The_Judiciary_desc: "While the First Republic did introduce an independent judiciary and courts, the weak Ministry of Justice was overshadowed by a powerful Interior Ministry. Judicial independence should be true in reality, not just on paper, to provide the people with justice and legal protection fit for the powerful country China should be."

 UPC_Reform_The_Currency_System: "Reform the Currency System"
 UPC_Reform_The_Currency_System_desc: "Currency in China is a complete mess. While a modern system was introduced in the early 1900s, the anarchy of the Warlord era led to a number of provincial, national and foreign currency with various exchange rates circulating. With our government firmly in control, it is time to enforce a single national currency minted from a central bank, the Federal Reserve Bank of China."

The Federalists have been pushing for greater financial transparency and separation of Central and Provincial finances since the foundation of the Public Interest Party. It is now time for them to implement their policy to the government and hopefully bring economic stability to China."
 UPC_Fiscal_Reform: "Fiscal Reform"
 UPC_Fiscal_Reform_desc: "Revenue is difficult to control in a country as large and corrupt as China. Reforms are sorely needed to modernise taxation and move away from questionable income sources such as gambling monopolies and exorbitant or unfair taxation. When stable revenue can be guaranteed, the government will be able to invest funds to help rebuild the devastated nation."

 UPC_China_Reconstruction_Plan_desc: "The Reconstruction Plan is Chen Jiongming's brainchild from the mid-1920s onward which outlined his ideals and plan to reunify and rebuild the nation. Through social, political, and economic reform, China can not only recover from Warlordism and Imperialism, but become a great power equal to any of the great western powers."
 UPC_Set_Up_Provincial_Assemblies: "Set Up Provincial Assemblies"
 UPC_Set_Up_Provincial_Assemblies_desc: "Local democracy has been snuffed by warlords, corrupt politicians and monarchists. Provincial governments should adopt constitutions and create democratic institutions on county- and provincial-levels and help reintroduce old traditions of local self-government. In the end, this will help the people, still largely illiterate, understand democracy and give it stronger foundations on a national level."

Chen Jiongming, in his writing, vagueness in power separation as one of the major problems behind the fall of the First Republic, and clear language in the new Constitution will help alleviate inter-institutional conflicts."
 UPC_Governor_Elections: "Governor Elections"
 UPC_Governor_Elections_desc: "The appointment of governors is in dire need of reform as Warlordism showed all too clearly. The Federalists have generally supported for governors and county magistrates to be directly elected by the people, while Guangdong adopted indirect elections, believing that lingering corrupt and feudal influences were still too strong. Either way the process must be reformed to encourage democratisation."
 UPC_Concessions_To_The_Landowners: "Concessions to the Landowners"
 UPC_Concessions_To_The_Landowners_desc: "While land reform is a necessity, it must be enacted within the bounds of the law and will never be possible without the support, or at least consent, of the landowners themselves. A compromise is therefore necessary, and the gentry will either be compensated or given concessions to ensure their continued support of more pressing political decisions."
 UPC_Good_Business_Relations: "Good Business Relations"
 UPC_Good_Business_Relations_desc: "The government will need to encourage investment from wealthy individuals and organisations in order to bring the tall task of rebuilding China to a successful conclusion.

 UPC_Support_Farmer_Unions: "Support Farmer Unions"
 UPC_Support_Farmer_Unions_desc: "The peasants make up the absolute majority of the population. It is only reasonable that we support their wellbeing and prosperity over those of the already-wealthy landowners. Chen Jiongming encouraged unionisation among both urban and rural populations, believing unions to be essential for the peasants to express their grievances and settle land and labour disputes."
 UPC_Land_To_The_Tiller: "Land to the Tiller"
 UPC_Land_To_The_Tiller_desc: "The Land to the Tiller programme is one of reasonable land reform that will benefit both peasants and landowners. Of course, implementing is easier said and done and it will certainly be costly, but is the way to both modernise the agrarian economy of China and reduce poverty among the cripplingly-poor peasants of the country."

 UPC_Develop_The_Daye_Hanyang_Corridor_desc: "The Daye-Hanyang Corridor in Hubei province is one of the more developed industrial zones or China, yet remains poorly developed at best and was planned poorly.

 UPC_The_Star_Of_Guangdong_desc: "Under Chen Jiongming, Guangdong Province was seen as the Model Province for the Federalist movement. Its success in modernisation and prosperity should be replicated by adopting its policies and adapting it to local realities. Soon enough, self-government and democracy will take hold in other provinces as the benefits they bring become obvious."

 UPC_The_Northern_Frontier_desc: "Inner Mongolia and the Northwest has been left to its own devices. Because of the lack of development and poor local economies, it will take federal intervention to develop the Frontier's immense potential in resource extraction.

 UPC_Streamline_Rifle_Production_desc: "The biggest problem of a large army is keeping it supplied. Not only with food and ammunition, but every footsoldier, as the basic unit of the army, needs a rifle in hand.

 UPC_Reform_Conscription: "Reform Conscription"

 UPC_Naval_Aviation: "Naval Aviation"
 UPC_Naval_Aviation_desc: "Naval aviation has a surprisingly long history in China as the Navy was quick to catch onto its potential and experiment, but did not receive the attention and funding it needed.

 lngupc.1.t: "The [GetConferenceCity] Conference"
 lngupc.1.d: "The First and Second Shantou Conferences of 1924 were an assembly of federalists from across China to discuss the future of the movement and the country. Notably, the second one was attended by delegates from both the Kuomintang and the Beijing Government despite their ongoing conflict. Chen Jiongming will now host a third conference, hoping to bring the southern provincial governments together to agree on a new Reconstruction Plan for the region and form a provisional government to rival the Beijing and Fengtian governments and the Kuomintang upstarts. Once more, the strength of the Federalist movement is on the upswing and there is a real chance for it to become influential in national politics."
 lngupc.1.a: "Towards unity."

 lngupc.101.t: "Beginning of the Conference"
 lngupc.101.d: "Governor Chen Jiongming, chairman of the China Public Interest Party, opened the conference stating that Southern China was in a unique position once again, and that the Federalist movement could prove themselves to the rest of China as models for true democracy and prosperity. [GXC.GetTangStatus]. Zhao Hengti reiterated his statement from 1922 that the only way to unite China is to build a federalised, unified nation. Notably, there are a number of delegates from outside the Federalist movement observing the Conference like the first two. After the opening statements, the delegates begin discussing Chen Jiongming's Reconstruction Plan and the possibility of forming a new National Government."
 lngupc.101.a: "Get on with it!"

 lngupc.102.t: "Tang's Course of Action"
 lngupc.102.d: "As the Conference drags on, Governor Tang is becoming uneasy. Chen Jiongming's Reconstruction Plan would severely weaken his position within the movement and in Yunnan itself, and while he had previously agreed to it back in 1924, the leader of Yunnan has become ambitious over the years. As deputy chairman of the Chen's Public Interest Party, Tang is in a position to oppose the more radical proposals of the party chairman.\n\nIt is becoming clear that the chairman and deputy chairman are no longer in complete agreement, and Tang is seeing his chance to usurp the Federalism movement from Chen. To do so, however, would go against the majority of the Public Interest Party and break the movement altogether. However, the idea of attaining national leadership is an attractive one, and may be worth the risk of a war with Chen's government."
 lngupc.102.a: "Denounce Chen and claim leadership!"
 lngupc.102.b: "No, unity must be preserved."

 lngupc.103.t: "Declaration of the United Provinces"
 lngupc.103.d: "The delegates at the Conference have agreed to Chen's Reconstruction Plan and soon finished the draft of their declaration. Chen Jiongming declares that [QIE.GetNameDef] to be illegitimate and the formation of a new national government in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]: The United Provinces of the Republic of China. The Conference then elect him as Provisional Chief Executive of the United Provincial Government, promptly announcing another conference to draft a provisional constitution for the Federalist government.\n\nWhile Southern China has been de facto outside the control of the Beijing Government since February 1936, this declaration formally announced the creation of a rival republican government in the South. While Chen Jiongming hopes that reconciliation is still possible with other republican movements in China, this will likely be taken poorly from the rival national governments."
 lngupc.103.a: "Long live the Federal Republic!"

 lngupc.104.t: "Declaration of the United Provinces"
 lngupc.104.d: "The delegates at the Conference have agreed to Chen's Reconstruction Plan and soon finished the draft of their declaration.

The Conference then elect him as Provisional Chief Executive of the United Provincial Government, promptly announcing another conference to draft a provisional constitution for the Federalist government.\n\nOur province has been formally invited to join the Federalist government, and we are expected to join Chen Jiongming against the monarchists and militarists in the North, and the party-dictators in the East."
 lngupc.104.a: "Long live the Federal Republic!"
 lngupc.104.b: "Is it too late to change our minds?"

 lngupc.105.t: "End of the [GetConferenceCity] Conference"
 lngupc.105.d: "The [GetConferenceCity] Conference has successfully closed today after the foundation of the Federal Republic. We are now on the path to a free, democratic, federal China. This path, however, is guaranteed to be a difficult one as many claim leadership over the country, and few are willing to entertain the Provisional Chief Executive's plea for reconciliation and peaceful reunification."
 lngupc.105.a: "Chen will free China!"

 lngupc.106.t: "End of the [GetConferenceCity] Conference"
 lngupc.106.d: "The [GetConferenceCity] Conference has ended in relative success. The Federalist movement appears united and on the way to securing the whole of Southern China. This could eventually pose a threat to our position, and we should keep a watchful eye to the Federalist upstarts in Guangzhou."
 lngupc.106.a: "We shall see."

 lngupc.107.t: "Tang's Betrayal"
 lngupc.107.d: "Tang Jiyao, governor of Yunnan and deputy chairman of the Public Interest Party, has turned on Chen Jiongming in the middle of the conference. It wasn't long before Tang and his delegates walked out of the assembly, denouncing Chairman Chen as a radical and what he sees as violating provincial autonomy.\n\nThe Conference is shaken, but continues without Yunnan. Tang's betrayal is quickly denounced and the rest of the delegates accept the Reconstruction Plan. Chen Jiongming reads out the conference's decision, declaring that [QIE.GetNameDef] to be illegitimate and the formation of a new national government in Guangzhou: The United Provinces of the Republic of China. The Conference then elect him as Provisional Chief Executive of the United Provincial Government, promptly announcing another conference to draft a provisional constitution for the Federalist government.\n\nWhile Southern China has been de facto outside the control of the Beijing Government since February 1936, this declaration formally announced the creation of a rival republican government in the South. While Chen Jiongming hopes that reconciliation is still possible with other republican movements in China, this will likely be taken poorly from the rival national governments, and his legitimacy is shaken by Tang's open rebellion."
 lngupc.107.a: "Down with Tang, long live the Republic!"

 lngupc.108.t: "Declaration of the United Provinces"
 lngupc.108.d: "Tang Jiyao's open betrayal at the conference has shaken the Federalist movement, but the delegates continued their work regardless. The remaining delegates at the Conference have agreed to Chen's Reconstruction Plan and soon finished the draft of their declaration. Chen Jiongming declares that [QIE.GetNameDef] to be illegitimate and the formation of a new national government in Guangzhou: The United Provinces of the Republic of China. The Conference then elect him as Provisional Chief Executive of the United Provincial Government, promptly announcing another conference to draft a provisional constitution for the Federalist government.\n\nOur province has been formally invited to join the Federalist government, and we are expected to join Chen Jiongming against the monarchists and militarists in the North, and the party-dictators in the East."

 lngupc.108.b: "The Federalists are a sinking ship."

 lngupc.109.t: "End of the [GetConferenceCity] Conference"
 lngupc.109.d: "The [GetConferenceCity] Conference has successfully closed today after the foundation of the Federal Republic despite Tang Jiyao's betrayal. We are now on the path to a free, democratic, federal China. This path, however, is guaranteed to be a difficult one as many claim leadership over the country, and few are willing to entertain the Provisional Chief Executive's plea for reconciliation and peaceful reunification, especially with his legitimacy shaken by Tang's split."
 lngupc.109.a: "Chen will free China!"

 lngupc.110.t: "End of the [GetConferenceCity] Conference"
 lngupc.110.d: "The [GetConferenceCity] Conference has ended and the split between Chen Jiongming and Tang Jiyao has become a very public affair as the two former allies have become hostile enemies. It is clear to us that the Federalists are quite lacking in unity, but it could come out from this crisis very strong. We should keep a close eye on the South."
 lngupc.110.a: "Third time's clearly not the charm."

 lngupc.111.t: "Formally Join the United Provinces?"
 lngupc.111.d: "While we were present to observe Chen Jiongming's Shantou Conference, we were unable to make a commitment at the time - our state of war had rendered us distracted from much of the conference, outside of providing somewhat vague statements of support. Whilst Jiongming has declared a United Provinces of China and constructed an alliance to aid in his goal of a free, united country, we were left out on account of our ongoing conflict as neither we nor the Federalist leadership were willing to commit to a full-scale war against our enemies.\n\nHowever, our war is now over, and the supportive statements we made in Shantou are now expected to mean something. [UPC.GetNonIdeologyNameDefCap] is now requesting that both of us make good on our previous commitments, and join the United Provinces. Even so, a few of our advisors have either been opposed to the idea from the start, or have since soured on the prospect - it would take away any diplomatic flexibility that we might have, and would almost certainly render some major players in China permanently hostile to us. Still, refusing would likely mean the same for the Federalists - thus, a choice must be made."
 lngupc.111.a: "Let us join forces."
 lngupc.111.b: "Actually, we are better off on our own."

 lngupc.112.t: "[FROM.GetNonIdeologyNameDefCap] Joins the [ROOT.GetNameDef]"
 lngupc.112.d: "We have received word from [FROM.GetNonIdeologyNameDefCap] that they have concluded their war, and are now prepared to more formally declare themselves our allies. Our movement for a free China continues to grow stronger by the day."
 lngupc.112.a: "We salute our new friends!"

 lngupc.113.t: "[FROM.GetNonIdeologyNameDefCap] Betrays Us!"
 lngupc.113.d.refused: "[FROM.GetNonIdeologyNameDefCap] has done a sudden turnabout and indicated that they will not be joining our alliance after all. We have been caught flat-footed - if we wish to extend the United Provinces to their territory, it will now have to be by force."
 lngupc.113.d.refused_after_war: "During the Shantou Conference, [FROM.GetNonIdeologyNameDefCap] expressed alignment with our goals, and a willingness to join the United Provinces that were soon to be proclaimed - however, the state of war that they found themselves in was something that we were not prepared to respond to, so it was decided that we should wait to extend our alliance until the conflict had ended. Yet, now that the war is over, [FROM.GetNonIdeologyNameDefCap] has done a sudden turnabout and indicated that they will not be joining our alliance after all. We have been caught flat-footed - if we wish to extend the United Provinces to their territory, it will now have to be by force."
 lngupc.113.a: "What is this treachery?"
 lngupc.113.b: "It *is* their choice..."

 lngupc.2.t: "Attend the [GetConferenceCity] Conference?"
 lngupc.2.d: "With his position secure in [UPC.GetNameDef], Chen Jiongming has invited us to the [GetConferenceCity] Conference. We attended the first two conferences in 1924 as members of the Federalist movement, which led to mixed results as our movement failed to end the war between the North and South. We expect that, this time, Chen Jiongming is aiming to form a new national government based on his ideals for a democratic and federal China, which he believes is the only way for the Chinese people to be free and prosperous.\n\nIf we are to attend and agree to his Reconstruction Plan, it is clear that we will eventually have adopt a federalist constitution, transfer power to an elected assembly, and, more importantly, have our armies absorbed into a central command. While this is not ideal for us, Chen's ideas have grown popular in southern China, and joining him will help stabilise our province and put us in a prominent position in the movement."
 lngupc.2.a: "Accept."
 lngupc.2.b: "Decline."

 lngupc.3.t: "Observe the [GetConferenceCity] Conference?"
 lngupc.3.d: "With Governor Chen Jiongming securing a significant part of Southern China, the Federalist movement has been on the upswing once again. While we are not part of this movement, we have been invited as part of Governor Chen's hope of fostering cooperation between the warring factions. Sending a delegate could help us gather more information in the happenings of the South and see if the Federalists can truly take advantage of their renewed momentum."
 lngupc.3.a: "Accept."
 lngupc.3.b: "Decline."

 lngupc.4.t: "Chen Jiongming Nationalises our Forces"
 lngupc.4.d: "As part of the Reconstruction Plan agreed at the [GetConferenceCity] Conference, Chen Jiongming has moved to unify all federalist forces under the United Provinces' Ministry of War, thus making our armies officially subordinated to the unified civilian government. While this will formally create the Federal Army as a single military force, this means [Root.GetLeader] will legally become Chen Jiongming's subordinate."
 lngupc.4.a: "Long Live the Federal Republic!"
 lngupc.4.b: "Hold up- what about our autonomy!?"

 lngupc.5.ta: "[From.GetLeader] Refuses to Comply"
 lngupc.5.da: "Completely disregarding our previous agreement in [GetConferenceCity], [From.GetNameDef] has refused to subordinate themselves to the federal government. This betrayal must be punished!"
 lngupc.5.tb: "[From.GetLeader] Complies"
 lngupc.5.db: "Without any sign of trouble, the forces of [From.GetNameDef] have been subordinated to the Government of the United Provinces as agreed in the [GetConferenceCity] Conference."
 lngupc.5.a: "Very well."

 lngupc.6.t: "Provisional Constitution of the United Provinces"
 lngupc.6.d: "A commission consisting of delegates from the provinces have officially adopted a constitution for the United Provinces of the Republic of China, which will soon be ratified by the provincial assemblies. A unified, federal China is one step closer to reality- at least, in the south."
 lngupc.6.a: "Long live the Republic of China!"

 #Used to house the new capital event, turned in a generic

 lngupc.8.t: "National Flag Debate"
 lngupc.8.d: "The National Conference began discussing the official adoption of a national flag. There are plenty who want to restore the flag of the First Republic, the Five-coloured flag, as a symbol of national unity. Many revolutionaries, however, wish to avoid connections with the corrupt Beiyang, Fengtian, and Zhili warlord regimes, and the party flag of the Public Interest Party (the white \"jing\" symbol on a blue canton on a red field) has grown in popularity along with the Federalist movement's continued successes."
 lngupc.8.a: "Restore the Five-coloured flag."
 lngupc.8.b: "Keep the Party flag."

 lngupc.9.t: "The Federalist Constitution"
 lngupc.9.d: "The National Conference has made the final vote; the Constitution has been promulgated! With their work completed, the Conference will be disbanded when the National Assembly is elected.\n\nThe Constitution of the United Provinces of China (or Federal Republic) is largely based on the 1924 Constitution of the Republic of China. Its main differences lay on the organisation of the Republic and its government, which is based on the United States. The powers of the central and provincial governments are more clearly defined. The main administrative unit of the Republic is the Province and the Province's is the County, and each are self-governing. Each province is to have their own constitution, which cannot conflict with the Federal one, drafted and adopted by representatives of its people. The Zongzhizheng (Chief Executive) is the Head of State and is responsible to the National Assembly while executive power is vested in the Cabinet. The National Assembly has two chambers: The Lower House is the House of Representatives elected by the people, and the Upper House is the Senate elected by the provincial governments.\n\nIn short, China is to become a federal parliamentary republic. It is hoped that with this new constitution will lead to a better, stable and united China where democracy can finally take hold."
 lngupc.9.a: "Long live the Federal Republic!"

 lngupc.10.t: "The Senate and Interim Government"
 lngupc.10.d: "Members of the Senate have been elected by the Provincial governments to represent them, forming the upper house of the legislature. Their first act was to elect the first Chief Executive of the United Provinces, and they unanimously chose Chen Jiongming, already the provisional head of state.\n\nWhile initially reluctant, Chen accepted the position, only to announce his retirement from politics after his term. From then on, as envisioned by the Reconstruction Plan, the Chief Executive would be elected by the people."
 lngupc.10.a: "Provincial representation guaranteed."

 lngupc.11.t: "Third Congress of the Public Interest Party"
 lngupc.11.d: "With the future of China in their hands, the China Zhigongdang, or Public Interest Party, have held a new congress to decide the next chairman after an exhausted Chen Jiongming bid farewell to politics.[UPC_CZGP_congress_loc]"
 lngupc.11.a: "Chen Qiyou, naturally."
 lngupc.11.b: "Tang Jiyao, a major surprise."

 lngupc.12.t: "Congress of the Democratic Constitutionalist Party"
 lngupc.12.d: "The Democratic Constitutionalist Party is, loosely speaking, a descendent of the Progressive Party of the First Republic. It was founded in exile after Yuan Shikai's fall and remained largely irrelevant. With democracy returning to China, the party is seeing a renaissance, embracing a new role as representatives of the recently-liberated north and dispersed conservative politicians. Two major candidates stand for the chairmanship: Gao Lingwei, politician of the First Republic and respected bureaucrat from the Zhili clique, and Hu Shih, another diplomat and distinguished essayist and philosopher. [UPC_DC_congress_loc]"
 lngupc.12.a: "Gao Lingwei and the Zhili remnants."
 lngupc.12.b: "Tang Jiyao; take advantage of his name."
 lngupc.12.c: "The pragmatic Hu Shih."

 lngupc.13.t: "Congress of the China Democratic League"
 lngupc.13.d: "The China Democratic League is a broad coalition of liberal intellectual throughout. With China's reunification, the League welcomed the Rural Reconstruction Party, which participated in Qing parliamentary politics before the Monarchy's overthrow, to its coalition along with other small liberal movements.\n\nZhang Junmai, an avowed social-democrat in the Western style, remains at the head of the League. The liberal coalition's main goal is to ensure the new Republic continues to uphold civil liberties with a focus on education reform and modernisation."
 lngupc.13.a: "Zhang Junmai will lead the centrists."

 lngupc.14.t: "Congress of the Chinese Nationalist Party"
 lngupc.14.d: "The Kuomintang have struggled since their second defeat in the League War. Thanks largely to Chen Jiongming's cooperation with Chen Mingshu's Productive People's Party, the Nationalist Party has survived the storm. With the country reunited, the Central Committee disbanded the PPP and held a new party congress to decide on the future.\n\nIn a controversial decision, Wang Jingwei and those left loyal to him decided to renounce revolutionary methods and recognise the Federal Government. Along with Chen Gongbo (the leader of the Reorganised Comrades Association), the two Kuomintang men held provincial and familiar ties with Chen Jiongming — with whom they were once comrades. This announcement was met with a fierce denouncement from Song Qingling's faction the Provisional Action Committee, who denounced Wang as betraying Dr. Sun's original ideals. Wang Jingwei has quickly consolidated his power as the new Chairman of the Kuomintang, hoping to bring the Kuomintang's socialist and leftist platform to the National Assembly."
 lngupc.14.a: "Wang Jingwei will continue Sun's legacy."

 lngupc.15.t: "Congress of the Chinese Syndicalist Party"
 lngupc.15.d: "With its alliance with the Kuomintang ended, the Chinese Syndicalist Party held its own congress to decide its future. As the Chinese urban proletariat remains small, the Syndicalists have made it their objective to ensure that the Federal Government maintains its pro-union stance and called for the creation of a federation of trade unions to unite China's numerous trade unions and ensure proper representation of workers. Chen Duxiu remains at the head of the CSP, with the party likely to remain fringe and largely uninfluential."
 lngupc.15.a: "Chen Duxiu holds the far-left."

 lngupc.16.t: "The Beginnings of Democracy"
 lngupc.16.d: "With several major democratic parties actively participating in the electoral process, the idea of democracy taking hold in China appears more realistic than previously expected. Debates are civilised, if sometimes energetic and emotional, and there seem to be little signs of obstruction in proceedings. Of course, many were optimistic during the 1912 National Assembly Election, only for the winner, Song Jiaoren of the Kuomintang, to be assassinated. Only time will tell as the upcoming election will be the first test of Chinese democracy since the 1910s."
 lngupc.16.a: "With cautious optimism, we look to the future."

 lngupc.17.t: "Chen Jiongming's Offer"
 lngupc.17.d: "Once merely the governor of Guangdong, Chen Jiongming's Federalist movement has become a veritable force in China and is potentially on its way to becoming a serious contender for national leadership. An emissary from the so-called United Provinces of the Republic of China, Chen's government, appeared with a request: Join the United Provinces in overthrowing the decadent and corrupt [QIE.GetName] and restore the Republic and Constitution.\n\nThe message does include demands and a final threat: [Root.GetLeader] must abide to Chen Jiongming's so-called Reconstruction Plan, which would require us to adopt a constitution and delegate the majority of our powers to an elected assembly while our armies would be integrated into the United Provinces', essentially depriving us of political power. In exchange, [ROOT.GetAdjective] officers would maintain their rank in the federalist army, with [Root.GetLeader] promised a command.\n\nShould we refuse, the message makes it clear that Chen Jiongming is willing to use force to \"help the [ROOT.GetAdjective] people overthrow their illegal warlord regime and restore democracy.\""
 lngupc.17.a: "We accept. For China!"
 lngupc.17.b: "We will not submit to this upstart!"

 lngupc.18.t: "[From.GetLeader] Submits!"
 lngupc.18.d: "The leader of [From.GetNameDef] has accepted our demands. His armies are now under our control and his provincial government will put the Reconstruction Plan into effect. We are one step closer towards unifying China under federalist leadership."
 lngupc.18.a: "Long live the Republic!"

 lngupc.19.t: "[From.GetLeader] Rejects our Demands"
 lngupc.19.d: "Unwilling to cooperate with our government and enact our Reconstruction Plan, the leader of [FROM.GetNameDef] defiantly rejected our demands. We will have to resort to force to overthrow their illegal warlord regime and bring the people to power."
 lngupc.19.a: "They will regret this."

 lngupc.20.t: "Federalists Mobilising Against Us"
 lngupc.20.d: "Chen Jiongming and his treacherous band of counter-revolutionaries have mobilised their warlord forces against us, seeking to destroy the National Revolution. We will never forget his betrayal of the Nationalist cause before the Northern Expedition- We have defeated him once, and we will defeat him again."
 lngupc.20.a: "They dare spit on Sun Yat-sen's legacy!"

 lngupc.21.t: "Delegation from the Federalists"
 lngupc.21.d: "Chen Jiongming's rival government in Guangzhou, having secured themselves a significant presence in the South, has sent delegates for negotiations. Unwilling to shed further bloodsheds and wanting to reunify the country as painlessly and peacefully as possible. The emissaries made their case that our government should adopt Chen Jiongming's Reconstruction Plan, which would mean that our provinces would send delegates to Chen's National Conference. This assembly would hammer out a new Federal Constitution based on the 1924 Constitution and an economic plan to rebuild the country. This would, however, submit all our military forces to this new civilian federal government, practically robbing us of significant bargaining power in Chen's Federal Republic.\n\nNegotiations quickly broke down as the Federalists refused to allow our Marshal to remain head of the reunified Chinese military or to adjust the powers of the President. The delegates left bitterly disappointed and we can only expect their rebellious armies to march against us."
 lngupc.21.a: "Foolish rebels."

 lngupc.211.t: "Negotiations Break Down with [FROM.GetNameDef]"
 lngupc.211.d: "Our delegates have returned bitterly disappointed. [FROM.GetLeader] refused to adopt Chen's Reconstruction Plan and attempts at compromise failed, seemingly unwilling to avoid more bloodshed among countrymen in order to preserve their thinly-veiled dictatorships. We will have to overthrow the militarists by force."
 lngupc.211.a: "Foolish militarists."

 lngupc.22.t: "Federalists Mobilising Against Us"
 lngupc.22.d: "Chen Jiongming and his treacherous band of republicans and self-proclaimed revolutionaries have mobilised their rebel forces against us. Unsurprisingly, they are unwilling to be reasonable, dead-set on overthrowing the Emperor and bringing another era of anarchy to the Empire. We can expect them to attack us soon, and we will destroy the anarchist when he tries to march north."
 lngupc.22.a: "He never should've been restored to Guangdong."

 lngupc.23.t: "Implementing the Reconstruction Plan"
 lngupc.23.d: "While we have been working on its preliminary implementation since we joined Chen Jiongming's Federalist movement, the new Federal Government has made it official as its first act. We will soon be invited to the National Conference, where details of a new Constitution will be decided.\n\nUnlike the last two Republican constitutions, this one will clearly determine the powers of the Chief Executive (head of state), the cabinet, the legislature, the Federal and Provincial governments, and so on. Essentially, the Provisional Government is expected to model itself after the United States of America while taking into account its recent failings and, of course, the particularities of China. After a Constitution is adopted and Senate (representing the Provinces) is formed, elections will be organised for the National Assembly.\n\nUntil the National Conference opens, as part of the Plan, we can expect help from the Provisional Government in infrastructure projects to help rebuild the national economy."
 lngupc.23.a: "Help? From the Central Government?"

 lngupc.24.t: "Invitation to the National Conference"
 lngupc.24.d: "The National Conference, as agreed in the Reconstruction Plan, is to draft the new Constitution of the Republic, form a Senate to represent the provinces of China, and create a new Central Government along democratic, federalist ideals. Our part of the country will be an integral part of the reborn Chinese nation."
 lngupc.24.a: "A new China rises."

 lngupc.25.t: "[FROM.GetLeader] Attends the National Conference"
 lngupc.25.d: "Among the representatives of [FROM.GetNameDef] is [FROM.GetLeader] joining us at the National Conference. Their support in the reconstruction of China will prove instrumental and we welcome them with open arms!"
 lngupc.25.a: "Welcome, brother!"

 lngupc.26.t: "Diplomatic Overture from [FROM.GetNameDef]"
 lngupc.26.d: "Ever since we have gained our independence, China, regardless of its successive governments, continues to claim our lands as part of their country. While this was hardly a problem when the Chinese continued to squabble among each other, a new Chinese government has risen from the ashes and reunified the country, which is now at its strongest in recent memory.\n\nHowever, it appears that [FROM.GetLeader] is willing to see reason and compromise. They sent a diplomatic envoy, making clear that they are willing to recognise our independence. In exchange, our nations are to seek closer economic ties for mutual benefits. The Chinese diplomat appears sincere enough with pretty words about our twinkling democracies forming closer ties despite a turbulent past relationship and does not give up hope for further Asian unity in the future."
 lngupc.26.a: "Let us seek closer relations as equals."
 lngupc.26.b: "This is merely an act to exploit us again!"

 lngupc.27.t: "Diplomatic Relations Established with [FROM.GetNameDef]"
 lngupc.27.d: "Our diplomat was successful. In exchange for recognition of their independence, we have signed a mutually-beneficial trade agreement as the basis for future relations and regional cooperation."
 lngupc.27.a: "For a better future with fellow Asians."

 lngupc.28.t: "[FROM.GetLeader] Rejected our Proposal"
 lngupc.28.d: "Our diplomat was unsuccessful. They have made clear that they will not accept anything more than recognition of their independence and that any trade deal would only reopen their country to Chinese dominance. Their insult has been noted."
 lngupc.28.a: "This is ridiculous!"

 lngupc.29.t: "First National Assembly Election"
 lngupc.29.d: "The first free elections of the Chinese Republic since the 1910s have finally arrived. Millions of Chinese will go to the polls, the vast majority for the first time in their lives, to vote for their preferred candidate or political party. This will reflect well on the country and its people regardless of the results."
 lngupc.29.a: "Chen Qiyou and the Federalists"
 lngupc.29.b: "Tang Jiyao and his moderate Federalists."
 lngupc.29.c: "Zhang Junmai and the China Democratic League"

 lngupc.30.t: "National Assembly Election of [GetYear]"
 lngupc.30.d: "[Root.GetLeader]'s term in office has ended and the Chinese people are back to the polls. We expect a bigger turnout rate than the previous election thanks to improving public education and infrastructure across China. Our burgeoning democracy is getting the attention of the whole world as we prove ourselves capable of greater civic responsibility than they ever expected. The Chinese people can be proud to cast their votes in free and fair election unknown in this part of the world."

 fedchi.100.t: "Successful Healthcare Expansion"
 fedchi.100.d: "The size of the country and limited resources has made the creation of a healthcare service a very difficult and expensive task. However, the Federal Government's initiative is starting to bear fruit as the number of hospitals in cities and clinics in rural areas has increased significantly. The people of China is starting to have access to modern healthcare for the first time in history."
 fedchi.100.a: "Excellent."

 fedchi.101.t: "Successful Literacy Campaigns"
 fedchi.101.d: "Education reform are always difficult to implement and judge its success. The Federal Government's efforts to improve literacy, however, by building more schools and giving night classes for workers, has already had a noticeable effect among the populace. Of course, it will take even more time for long-term effects to appear, but the early results are already promising."
 fedchi.101.a: "Excellent."

 fedchi.102.t: "Land To The Tiller"
 fedchi.102.d: "Land reform has been a controversial issue. Not because some disagree (the need for such a programme has been nigh-universally acknowledged in China), but because implementing it can either be expensive or violent through expropriations. Regardless, the government's attempt to implement a reasonable land reform without resorting to illegal or violent means is starting to see some real changes in rural areas throughout China. It will take a very long time, but the Land to the Tiller programme is slowly redistributing land and compensating landlords, giving a higher rate of peasant land ownership like never before."
 fedchi.102.a: "Excellent."

 fedchi.200.t: "China Repeals Unequal Treaties"
 fedchi.200.d: "The new national government of China, with their position secured, has decided to unilaterally void all unequal treaties. As a way to reassert themselves on the world stage, they invite us to sign an new treaty with them as equals. This would recognise the end of our nationals' extraterritorial rights in China and bring about a mutually-beneficial trade agreement instead of the preferential tariffs and territorial concessions. Refusing this will include trade sanctions with China, which would be disadvantageous as the Chinese government is unwilling to restore the previous treaties that profited us."
 fedchi.200.a: "Very well, this is a new era."
 fedchi.200.b: "Impose sanctions instead."

 fedchi.201.t: "A New Treaty with [FROM.GetNameDef]"
 fedchi.201.d: "The government of [FROM.GetNameDef] has accepted to recognise us as an equal nation and a new trade agreement has been enacted instead. We are one step closer to ending the Century of Humiliation and achieving our place in the world."
 fedchi.201.a: "Excellent!"

 fedchi.203.t: "China Proposes Trade Agreement"
 fedchi.203.d: "When the Chinese government unilaterally ended the unequal treaties, we refused to recognise it and instead enforced sanctions on China. However, this has destroyed trade relations with China and has had little effect on them. China's foreign ministry has repeated their earlier offer of a new treaty with them, seemingly willing to ignore what they perceived as a grave insult to their status as a nation in order to rebuilt relations between our two nations as equals instead of an \"imperialist arrangement\"."
 fedchi.203.a: "Very well."
 fedchi.203.b: "Never!"

 fedchi.204.t: "[FROM.GetName] Rejects our Offer"
 fedchi.204.d: "The imperialists of [FROM.GetNameDef] has refused to sign a new treaty with us, instead clinging to their dying colonial attitudes and continuing sanctions. They will see the consequences of losing access to the Chinese market as we continue to modernise and prosper."
 fedchi.204.a: "They will regret that insult."
