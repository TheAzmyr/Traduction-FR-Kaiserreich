### Events ###
 pact.1.t: "The Congress of Belgrade"
 pact.1.d: "The cooperation of the Balkan nations against a common foe, despite their internal disagreements, is a path well trodden by history already. The Balkan League, formed between Serbia, Bulgaria and Greece to defeat the Ottoman Empire in the Balkans, was a prime example of that, even though it disintegrated into the Second Balkan War mere months after victory. Today, Serbia, Romania and Greece stare down against another hegemon - the Tsardom of Bulgaria - and each of them have territories to reclaim.\n\nFor almost two decades, the thought of such an alliance occurring was unthinkable. The three Balkan states had been dismantled, weakened, disarmed, and the eye of the great powers of Europe ever watchful. By the 1930s, however, the situation had changed conclusively. The ever constant frailty of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and thus lacking will to intervene in the Balkans have already given the Balkan minors a chance to rearm, and now, it has given a chance for them to plan together. Bipartisan summits and diplomatic talks had been taking place between Serbia and Romania since 1932, and Serbia and Greece since 1934, and it all has culminated in the Congress of Belgrade.\n\nA fourteen day summit in the capital of Serbia, it is a cultural event as much as a political one. The diplomatic planning between the foreign ministers of the three states takes place in parallel with dialogue between the Universities of Belgrade and Bucharest regarding research and student exchanges, for example.\n\nRegardless, by the end of the Congress, the delegations of the three states released a 14-point resolution - the most alarming of which was "a recognition that only the self-determination of people, according to their ethnic allegiances, may be considered a just path to sovereignty and territorial claim", and a call for a "new order in the Balkans" to implement this principle, presumably at Bulgaria's expense."
 # Of course, such an event could not take place without controversy. The inclusion of the Romanian delegation, while crucial, has been protested by many representatives in the Skupština, who could not bring themselves to bear [SER.GetLeader] shaking hands with the despised Corneliu Codreanu. - TBA later
 pact.1.a: "Open the Congress!"

 pact.2.t: "The Congress of Belgrade"
 pact.2.d: "[From.GetNameDefCap] has invited us to send a diplomat to Belgrade to take part in the Belgrade Congress, so that we may discuss the political and military situation in the Balkans. Since the victory of Bulgaria in the Weltkrieg, we have had our eyes on land that is rightfully ours, as does Serbia. They suggest we form a new, formal alliance called the Belgrade Pact, to protect our mutual interests and contain the Bulgarian menace. This could, however, anger Bulgaria's former allies Germany, Austria and the Ottoman Empire."
 pact.2.a: "Announce our support for the Belgrade Pact."
 pact.2.b: "We have no interest in their alliance."

 pact.3.t: "[From.GetName] Joins the Belgrade Pact"
 pact.3.d: "The [From.GetAdjective] government has announced they will attend the congress in Belgrade and formally join the Belgrade Pact."
 pact.3.a: "Together for peace!"

 pact.4.t: "[From.GetName] Refuses"
 pact.4.d: "The [From.GetAdjective] government has announced they will, for the time being, not be part of any formal alliance aimed at Bulgaria."
 pact.4.a: "We don't need them."

 pact.5.t: "End of the Pact"
 pact.5.d: "While we have tried to form an alliance to further Serbian interests in the Balkans, we find ourselves alone against the greater world. The time has come to recognise that the Belgrade Pact is at an end."
 pact.5.a: "Alas..."

 pact.6.t: "Congress of Belgrade Argues for a New Order on the Balkans"
 pact.6.d: "On the initiative of Serbia, representative of several countries have convened in Belgrade to discuss the political and military situation on the Balkans. In these fourteen day long event, Serbs, Romanians and Greeks plot to create a so-called 'new order in the Balkans', even going as far as to create a 14-point resolution which declares that "only the self-determination of people, according to their ethnic allegiances, may be considered a just path to sovereignty and territorial claim".\n\nClearly, the Balkans are restless once again, and the resolutions of the Belgrade Congress will surely be used to justify a common war against Bulgaria and, ultimately, the Austrian Empire. What is to be done about these news?"
 pact.6.a: "The Serbs and Romanians will think twice after an embargo!"
 pact.6.b: "Let them come, the Balkans cannot threaten us."

 pact.7.t: "[From.GetName] Announces Support for Bulgaria"
 pact.7.d: "The [From.GetAdjective] government has announced today that they will support Bulgaria in any future conflicts between the Belgrade Pact and the Tsardom of Bulgaria, and will be joining an international arms embargo to put a dent to our weapons stockpiles in preparation for the war."
 pact.7.a: "This is not good."

 pact.8.t: "[From.GetName] Announces Support for Bulgaria"
 pact.8.d: "On the initiative of Serbia, representative of several countries have convened in Belgrade to discuss the political and military situation on the Balkans. In these fourteen day long event, Serbs, Romanians and Greeks plot to create a so-called 'new order in the Balkans', even going as far as to create a 14-point resolution which declares that "only the self-determination of people, according to their ethnic allegiances, may be considered a just path to sovereignty and territorial claim".\n\nClearly, the Balkans are restless once again, and the resolutions of the Belgrade Congress will surely be used to justify a common war against Bulgaria and, ultimately, the Austrian Empire. The Austrians have called for an international arms embargo on the Balkan states to support Bulgaria, shall we announce our support for the Bulgarians as well?"
 pact.8.a: "Only Bulgaria will keep the Balkans stable."
 pact.8.b: "We are uninterested in the Balkans."

 pact.17.t: "The Serbian Blow!"
 pact.17.d: "After a tense two week standoff on the Morava River, the Serbian government has finally spoken again - they demand us to vacate Macedonia and the Niš region in 48 hours, effectively surrendering it to Serbian control, in order to protect the local Serbian population from further terror and bloodshed. Follow-up ultimatums have been sent by its allies in the Belgrade Pact, addressing the ethnic conflict and their worries in their respective territories.\n\nBefore the ink on those documents has even dried, our forces in Nish have already sent reports of Serbian forces crossing the Morava, first skirmishes and aerial bombardments taking place. Only one option is left for us, then."
 pact.17.a: "To war! Defend Bulgaria's honour!"

 pact.21.t: "The Question of Thrace"
 pact.21.d: "With Bulgaria now embroiled in a war with the Belgrade Pact, a question has now arisen within the halls of government as to whether we, too, should reclaim lands which are rightfully ours. Since the end of the Weltkrieg, Bulgaria has occupied lands in Western Thrace which are largely both Muslim and Turkish - surely they would see reason if their old 'ally' asks for them to be handed over?"
 pact.21.a: "Make the demand."
 pact.21.b: "We've no interest in getting involved right now."

 pact.22.t: "The Ottomans Demand Thrace"
 pact.22.d: "It seems our old 'allies' in the Ottoman Empire wish to capitalise on our current conflict with the Belgrade Pact. They've demanded the return of western Thrace, an area which is largely both Muslim and Turkish, but which we have rightfully occupied since the end of the Weltkrieg. Should we refuse, they may very well attack us from the rear, an added front to the war we can hardly afford."
 pact.22.a: "Give them what they want..."
 pact.22.b: "Never! We'll defeat them as well!"

 pact.23.t: "Bulgaria Agrees"
 pact.23.d: "Seeing the wisdom in not pursuing a two-front war, Bulgaria has agreed to return the lands in western Thrace to us."
 pact.23.a: "Very wise."

 pact.24.t: "Bulgaria Refuses"
 pact.24.d: "Stubborn to the last, the Bulgarian government has responded to our demands with only outrage. They are ready to fight us as well, if need be."
 pact.24.a: "So be it."

 pact.25.t: "Ottomans on the Move"
 pact.25.d: "Perhaps deciding our war against the Belgrade Pact presents an opportunity, Ottoman forces are assembling along our mutual border. It's difficult to say whether they will make a demand or simply invade, but we should be ready for either eventuality."
 pact.25.a: "How dare they!"

 pact.26.t: "[From.GetAdjective] Help Arrives"
 pact.26.d: "As they promised, the government of [From.GetNameDef] has sent us aid in the ongoing conflict against the Belgrade Pact. Unfortunately, they can't intervene directly, but several volunteer divisions and some equipment have arrived."
 pact.26.a: "Any help is welcome."
 pact.26.tt: "[From.GetAdjective] troops and equipment arrive"

 pact.27.t: "Serbia Negotiating Peace"
 pact.27.d: "The Serbian foreign ministry has informed us that they are currently negotiating a peace treaty with Bulgaria which would put an end to the War, and fulfil generous territorial demands for all of the Pact's members. As the war has been dragging on, such a peace would be welcomed by the people. However, Bulgaria will remain an independent state, something officials within our government are concerned with - this will mean Bulgaria may, theoretically, be able to rearm and strike back at us much like they did during the Weltkrieg. Should we accept this peace?"
 pact.27.a: "Let us end the war now, before the costs build up."
 pact.27.b: "Bulgaria delenda est!"
 BP_temporary_breakaway_tt: "You will be able to rejoin the Pact after the war."

 pact.28.t: "The Peace of Sofia"
 pact.28.d: "A peace treaty has been signed between the members of the Belgrade Pact and Bulgaria in Sofia, putting an end to the Fourth Balkan War."
 pact.28.a: "Victory!"

 pact.29.t: "War Exhaustion"
 pact.29.d: "Our country has entered the Fourth Balkan War with the promise that the war will be short and result in swift territorial gains, but now, it has stalled and the populace yearns for peace. Rumours have been spread that the Bulgarians offered a very generous peace treaty which would fulfil all of our territorial claims, but it has been refused, and so even more men will be sent to die in war for nothing more. Our officers struggle to motivate their soldiers to continue fighting and the homefront is turning unruly."
 pact.29.a: "Damn..."

 pact.30.t: "Reinvitation to the Belgrade Pact"
 pact.30.d: "Now that the war with Bulgaria has concluded, Serbian officials have approached us with the request to restore our membership in the Belgrade Pact for the impending fight against Austria."
 pact.30.a: "Let's do it."
 pact.30.b: "No, we will stay out from any more foreign ventures."

 pact.35.t: "We're Losing the Balkan War"
 pact.35.d: "The forces of the Belgrade Pact have soundly defeated us in battle and occupied a large part of our country. We must end this war before they manage to overrun our entire homeland, or Bulgaria might cease to exist."
 pact.35.a: "Sue for peace..."
 pact.35.b: "We can still win this!"
 BUL_other_states_may_continue_war_tt: "The peace, if accepted, will be processed in seven days. During this time, members of the Pact may continue the war independently."

 pact.36.t: "Bulgaria Asks for Peace"
 pact.36.d: "With a large part of their homeland occupied and their forces in full retreat, Bulgaria has asked us for peace. They will hand over all disputed territories, but we will have to retreat our forces behind these new borders. An independent Bulgarian state will continue to exist, for now."
 pact.36.a: "The Belgrade Pact stands triumphant!"
 pact.36.b: "No, they shall be utterly crushed!"
 SER_other_states_may_continue_war_tt: "The peace will be processed in seven days. During this time, our allies may leave the Pact to continue the war independently."

 pact.37.t: "Peace with the Belgrade Pact"
 pact.37.d: "The Belgrade Pact has accepted our peace offer. We have to cede all disputed land, but they will retreat their forces behind the new border."
 pact.37.a: "At least we exist!"

 pact.38.t: "Bulgaria Surrenders"
 pact.38.d: "The joined armed forces of the Belgrade Pact have managed to revert the injustices imposed on us after the end of the Weltkrieg. Bulgaria will cede all disputed lands to the Belgrade Pact, but we must retreat our forces behind the border. An independent but greatly reduced Bulgaria will continue to exist, for now."
 pact.38.a: "The Belgrade Pact stands triumphant!"

 pact.39.t: "Bulgaria Makes Peace"
 pact.39.d.gained: "Bulgaria has made peace with the Belgrade Pact, and thus we are forced to end our war as well. Fortunately, we will leave the war having gained any claimed states we control, denying the Serbs the opportunity to divvy them up with their allies."
 pact.39.d.nogain: "Bulgaria has made peace with the Belgrade Pact. Unfortunately, since we did not end up in control over our claimed states, they are left in the hands of the Serbs to divvy them up as they wish. It seems we should have moved more quickly."
 pact.39.a: "Very well."
 pact.39.b: "Then we continue the war!"

 pact.40.t: "We Have Occupied Thrace"
 pact.40.d: "We have occupied western Thrace with our troops, and still hold the line against Bulgaria. Surely they will see the wisdom in making peace now?"
 pact.40.a: "Make the offer - let's end this."
 pact.40.b: "No - they wanted a war, they'll have one!"

 pact.41.t: "Ottomans Offer Peace"
 pact.41.d: "The Ottomans have occupied their claimed states and are still holding the line against us - if we continue to push the war against them, we may very well fall completely. Perhaps we should consider giving them what they want?"
 pact.41.a: "Bah! So be it!"
 pact.41.b: "No, we continue the war no matter what!"

 pact.42.t: "We are Losing the War"
 pact.42.d: "Despite the odds against them, and what we assumed would be a quick war, the Bulgarians have pushed us back. Indeed, we no longer control land in Europe, and if this continues we will end up in very dire straits indeed. Perhaps we can offer to relinquish our claims to Thrace and put an end to this war now?"
 pact.42.a: "Yes, make a peace offer."
 pact.42.b: "No, we fight on!"

 pact.43.t: "Ottomans Call for Peace"
 pact.43.d: "The Ottomans, clearly regretting their intervention in the war and having been already pushed out of Europe, have offered to make peace - they will relinquish their claims to western Thrace, and leave whence they came."
 pact.43.a: "So be it."

 pact.46.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Refuses Peace"
 pact.46.d: "Although we offered great concessions to our enemy, the [From.GetAdjective] government has refused our peace offer, stating we will be utterly crushed."
 pact.46.a: "We need to turn the tide!"

 pact.47.t: "We're Losing the Balkan War"
 pact.47.d: "The war against Bulgaria has been a total disaster. Despite our allies in the Belgrade Pact, Bulgaria has been able to defeat us once again, and they're close to Belgrade itself. We can offer the Bulgarians the dismantlement of our alliance, capitulate the province of Montenegro, give the Albanians in Kosovo and Albania autonomy, and de-militarise border provinces. Furthermore, we need to offer them reparation payments for several years. These are harsh terms, but otherwise we might lose our independence completely."
 pact.47.a: "Sue for peace..."
 pact.47.b: "We can still win this!"

 pact.48.t: "Serbia Asks for Peace"
 pact.48.d: "With our success in the Balkan War, the Belgrade Pact is on the verge of collapse. Serbia has approached us with a peace offer. They will capitulate the territory of Montenegro, several border provinces will be de-militarised, the Belgrade Pact will be disbanded, and Serbia will pay us war reparations. In return, we allow them to keep their independence."
 pact.48.a: "We are triumphant once again."
 pact.48.b: "No, they shall be crushed!"

 pact.49.t: "Bulgaria Accepts Peace Offer"
 pact.49.d: "The Fourth Balkan War has not quite had the successes we had in mind. Bulgaria has been able to successfully mount an offensive and was on the verge of taking Belgrade. They have accepted our peace offer so we can keep our independence. However, we need to surrender Montenegro its independence, give Kosovo to Albania, and pay war reparations for the coming years."
 pact.49.a: "At least we exist."

 pact.50.t: "The Bulgarians are Victorious"
 pact.50.d: "The Fourth Balkan War was not quite the success we had in mind. Bulgaria has been able to successfully mount an offensive and was on the verge of taking Belgrade. Negotiations between Serbia and Bulgaria have resulted in a peace deal. We need de-militarise Oltenia and the Belgrade Pact will be disbanded."
 pact.50.a: "Are they invincible?"

 pact.51.t: "The Bulgarians are Victorious"
 pact.51.d: "The Fourth Balkan War was not quite the success we had in mind. Bulgaria has been able to successfully mount an offensive and was on the verge of taking Belgrade. Negotiations between Serbia and Bulgaria have resulted in a peace deal. We need de-militarise Thessalia, cede Thessaloniki, renounce our claims to Bulgarian territory, and the Belgrade Pact will be disbanded."
 pact.51.a: "Are they invincible?"

 pact.52.t: "The War is Over"
 pact.52.d: "With the Fourth Balkan War having drawn to an end, [Root.GetAdjective] soldiers are returning home from the countryside at long last, and things are returning to normal."
 pact.52.a: "Finally."

 pact.53.t: "The War is Over"
 pact.53.d: "The war with the Bulgarians has drawn to a close, and finally our northern borders are returning to something resembling normalcy."
 pact.53.a: "Finally."

 pact.54.t: "Bulgaria Makes Peace"
 pact.54.d: "Bulgaria has made peace with the Belgrade Pact, and thus we have a chance to end our war with them as well. Do we take advantage of Serbia's victory, and gain our claims, or do we prolong the war further?"
 pact.54.a: "Let's end this now."
 pact.54.b: "We won't stop until they're conquered!"

 pact.64.t: "Call for Joint Occupation of Bulgaria"
 pact.64.d: "The Bulgarians have been defeated and we have redeemed ourselves in the eyes of the world! However, we had not originally thought out what to do with the remaining lands of Bulgaria beyond industrial reparations. The majority of our military officers are calling for at least temporary military occupation of the whole of Bulgaria, while some claim that an occupation might be too costly for our weary nation to handle."
 pact.64.a: "Divide Bulgaria into occupation zones!"
 pact.64.b: "Let them have their independence."

 pact.65.t: "[From.GetName] Calls for Joint Occupation of Bulgaria"
 pact.65.d: "The [From.GetAdjective] government has called for a joint occupation of the remaining lands of Bulgaria. In the future, a much smaller Bulgarian state may be carved out of these territories. For now we have the right to govern our occupation zone as we see, even plundering it from anything valuable."
 pact.65.a: "Very well."
 pact.65.b: "No, we keep our new lands!"

 pact.66.t: "[From.GetName] Refuses to Set Up Occupation Zones"
 pact.66.d: "The [From.GetAdjective] government has refused our demand to set up occupation zones in the former Bulgarian territories. They stated that all the land they have is now rightfully theirs. Relations with [From.GetName] are greatly damaged, and the only thing that rests us is to cancel our military alliance."
 pact.66.a: "This is outrageous!"

 pact.70.t: "Help Bulgaria?"
 pact.70.d: "The Serbians have attacked Bulgaria together with their Belgrade Pact allies. During the Weltkrieg, Bulgaria had aided us by fighting alongside our men whilst sending aid in the form of weapons. Some argue we should directly intervene in favour of Bulgaria, but others say this will upset the precarious balance in the Balkans and might result in some of our neighbours declaring war on us. We can of course also ignore the conflict completely, but that would mean we don't help our former ally."
 pact.70.a: "Send aid."
 pact.70.b: "Offer the Bulgarians an alliance!"
 pact.70.c: "We cannot do anything."

 pact.71.t: "Albania Offers Us an Alliance"
 pact.71.d: "Surprisingly enough, the Albanians have offered us an alliance, citing the help that we'd offered them during the Weltkrieg when fighting off the Serbians. While this could prove to be beneficial, they could also prove to be a hindrance to the war effort. What say we?"
 pact.71.a: "Great!"
 pact.71.b: "We don't need them."

 pact.72.t: "Bulgaria Has Accepted Our Offer of an Alliance"
 pact.72.d: "The Bulgarian government has gladly accepted our offer of an alliance and our troops are already moving into their territory. Together, we will contain the aggression of the Belgrade Pact and defend the territorial integrity of Bulgaria."
 pact.72.a: "We shall defeat the Serbian menace."

 pact.73.t: "Bulgaria has Rejected Our Offer of an Alliance"
 pact.73.d: "The Bulgarian government has declined our offer of an alliance and have stated that they don't need our help against the Belgrade Pact."
 pact.73.a: "So be it."

 pact.74.t: "We're Losing the Balkan War"
 pact.74.d: "Our intervention in the Fourth Balkan War has been a total disaster. Bulgaria is no more, and part of our land is now occupied by the Belgrade Pact. We must sue for peace while we still can!"
 pact.74.a: "Sue for peace."
 pact.74.b: "We can still win this!"

 pact.75.t: "The Albanians Ask for Peace"
 pact.75.d: "With part of their land occupied and their forces in full retreat, Albania has asked us for peace."
 pact.75.a: "The Belgrade Pact stands triumphant."
 pact.75.b: "No, they shall be crushed!"

 pact.76.t: "Peace with the Belgrade Pact"
 pact.76.d: "The Belgrade Pact has accepted our peace offer. We have to cede some disputed land to them but they will retreat their forces."
 pact.76.a: "At least we're still a sovereign nation!"

 pact.77.t: "Albania has Surrendered"
 pact.77.d: "The joined armed forces of the Belgrade Pact have managed to defeat the Albanians. They have surrendered and ceded some disputed land to the Pact, but we have to give them their capital back. Another enemy of ours is defeated."
 pact.77.a: "The Belgrade Pact stands triumphant!"

 pact.78.t: "We're Losing the Balkan War"
 pact.78.d: "Though it pains us to admit it, the Albanian intervention has turned the tide. We should offer to return all their claimed lands, lest we lose our independence."
 pact.78.a: "Sue for peace"
 pact.78.b: "We can still win this!"

 pact.79.t: "Serbia Asks for Peace"
 pact.79.d: "The Belgrade Pact is in retreat. Now, Serbia has approached us with a peace offer. The Belgrade Pact will give up all our claimed lands, returning to the pre-war state. In return we allow them to keep their independence."
 pact.79.a: "Enough bloodshed. End this war."
 pact.79.b: "No, they shall be crushed!"

 pact.80.t: "Peace is Signed, End of the War"
 pact.80.d: "While it pains us to admit it, the Albanians were able to defeat us on the battlefield. Negotiations between Serbia and the Albanians have resulted in a peace deal. We need to give up all their claimed lands."
 pact.80.a: "We will not forget this!"

 pact.81.t: "The War is Over"
 pact.81.d: "The war with the Serbs has drawn to a close, and finally our borders are returning to something resembling normalcy."
 pact.81.a: "Finally."

 pact.200.t: "Victory in the Balkan War"
 pact.200.d: "After years of planning and preparing, the combined forces of the Belgrade Pact now stand victorious over the Bulgar menace! No longer can the Bulgarians pressure us into doing their bidding, because we are now the masters of the Balkans. Our victory came at a cost of course, many brave men gave their lives to achieve our long held dream, and it is their lives that we will celebrate in this stunning victory.\n\nYet, even after reclaiming our rightful territories from the clutch of the Bulgarians, our mission isn't over. Austria stands firm to the north, oppressing their South-Slavic population into doing the Habsburg's bidding. This cannot stand. We must right the wrongs of the Weltkrieg and finally take revenge against Vienna, though to ensure unity amongst the Belgrade Pact, a second Belgrade Congress will be held in the coming weeks."
 pact.200.a: "Send out the invitations!"

 pact.201.t: "An invitation from Serbia"
 pact.201.d: "Today we received a message from the Serbian embassy, inviting us to attend a second Congress of Belgrade in a couple of weeks. Our allies wish to liberate the South-Slavs that remain under the Austrian boot, and no doubt want us to assist in this endeavour. In addition, there are likely spoils we can get out of an Austrian defeat, so it's imperative we at least attend the Second Congress to formulate a plan of action."
 pact.201.a: "Very well, we shall attend."

 pact.202.t: "Possible New Allies"
 pact.202.d.ITA: "The Balkan states are not the only ones which have territorial grievances against the Habsburg Empire. Even if you do not count the competing ethnicities making it up within, the countries surrounding it all have brethren to free from this 'prison of nations'. As Austria is far more powerful than the Balkan states combined, we need to consider these possible new allies.\n\nDuring the Italian civil war, the Austrians ripped off a piece of Italy and established a vassal republic in Milan. They could not suppress it for long, however, and now an extreme revanchist government is in control of [ITA.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], led by [ITA.GetLeader], which seeks to reclaim all Italian lands - including those held by Austria.\n\nPerhaps they can be persuaded to join our cause?"
 pact.202.a: "All help is welcome."
 pact.202.b: "Don't bother."

 pact.203.t: "An invitation to Belgrade"
 pact.203.d: "The Balkan states, having jointly defeated Bulgaria and now led by Serbia, now turn their sights north, towards the Austro-Hungarian Empire - and as their interests align with ours, the Serbian government has reached out to us with a proposal - an invitation to Belgrade to attend in the Second Congress, where the delegates will decide on joint action against Austria. What should be our response?"
 pact.203.a: "Very well, we shall attend."
 pact.203.b: "This is a waste of time."

 pact.204.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Agrees to Attend"
 pact.204.d: "The foreign ministry of [FROM.GetNameDef] has written back to us, informing us that they agree to join our common cause against Austria."
 pact.204.a: "Excellent."

 pact.205.t: "The Delegates Arrive"
 pact.205.d: "Today, a multi-national throng of diplomats, observers and military officials from [GetCongressMembers] descended on Belgrade to attend the opening ceremony of the Second Congress of Belgrade. In a short speech, the Prime Minister thanked all of the delagates for attending, and then gave a toast to our certain victory over our mutual enemies in Vienna. Tomorrow, the serious discussions will begin, concerning everyone's claims on Habsburg territory and our approach to dealing with them. But today is a day to cherish this rare-celebration of pan-national unity!"
 pact.205.a: "Let the Congress begin!"

 pact.206.t: "Deciding on a Goal"
 pact.206.d: "Our overall aim might be unified, but there are multiple ways we can approach dealing with Vienna. The more radical delegates at the Congress are calling for a war to bleed the Austrians dry, in revenge for their actions during the Weltkrieg. On the other hand, the moderate diplomats are favouring a more diplomatic approach, hoping to negotiate with Vienna rather than being purely belligerent towards them. A peaceful approach would likely be preferable, but few are optimistic about Austria's chances of actually going to the negotiating table. Ultimately, the leading Serbian delegates have the final choice over what approach we should seek to take, and after some hours of backroom meetings they return to the Congress with their course of action."
 pact.206.a: "To war with Austria!"
 pact.206.b: "Force them with diplomacy!"

 pact.207.t: "The Congress Chooses to Attack Austria"
 pact.207.d: "The delegates in Belgrade have decided that, with Bulgarian hegemony toppled, that it was now time to overthrow the Habsburg hegemony over Central Europe. Since most of the Pact's members have extensive claims on the Austro-Hungarian Empire, their delegates are eager to finally end their respective national goals, but not all members are so eager to throw themselves at the rotten Empire. Regardless, it is time to officially announce our support for this plan of action or leave the Congress."
 pact.207.a: "We support this initiative."
 pact.207.b: "We will join the Pact!"
 pact.207.c: "What? No!"
 pact.207.e: "We never cared about Transylvania anyway."

 pact.208.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Leaves the Congress"
 pact.208.d.war: "The delegation from [FROM.GetNameDef] has left the Congress, either to protest our agreed plan of action or because they see no benefits for themselves."
 pact.208.d.diplomacy: "The delegation from [FROM.GetNameDef] has left the Congress, seemingly uninterested in the Austrian question."
 pact.208.a: "Their loss."

 pact.209.t: "The Question of Claims"
 pact.209.d: "With the plan of action decided, the delegations have decided to formalise their claims on the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Naturally, we have made sure to inform them that our government's ultimate goal is to unite the Southern Slavs of Austria-Hungary under our flag, freeing them from centuries of oppression."
 pact.209.a: "We shall free the Slavs!"

 pact.210.t: "The Question of Claims"
 pact.210.d: "With the plan of action decided, the delegations have decided to formalise their claims on the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Naturally, we have made sure to inform them that our government's ultimate goal is to liberate the lands inhabited by ethnic Romanians, currently humiliated by centuries of oppression."
 pact.210.a: "We will reunite with Transylvania!"

 pact.211.t: "The Question of Claims"
 pact.211.d: "With the plan of action decided, the delegations have decided to formalise their claims on the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Greece, however, has little to gain in terms of territory directly from the Habsburgs, but we do believe that this is part of improving regional cooperation and solidifying relations."
 pact.211.a: "We have no claims."
 pact.211.b: "Northern Epirus belongs to us!"

 pact.213.t: "The Question of Claims"
 pact.213.d: "With the plan of action decided, the delegations have decided to formalise their claims on the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Naturally, we have made sure to inform them that our government's ultimate goal is to finally bring an end to the Risorgimento, freeing the Italians of Austria from the Habsburg Yoke and avenging the stain of 1919!"
 pact.213.a: "We shall recover Istria and Trento!"

 pact.214.t: "The Congress has Ended"
 pact.214.d: "With our plan and intentions clear, the Congress comes to a close. We now march towards the final battle in the establishment of a new order in the Balkans, one where the nations are free from foreign empires and oppression."
 pact.214.a: "Onwards!"

 pact.215.t: "The Congress Chooses to Negotiate with Austria"
 pact.215.d: "The delegates in Belgrade have decided that it would be unwise to throw ourselves senselessly at the Austro-Hungarian Army. In order to clearly voice our grievances and gain the sympathy of the international community, we are to open negotiations with Vienna to achieve the Congress' stated goal of rectifying historical wrongs and end the suffering of many of our co-nationals currently residing in Austria-Hungary. Should they refuse, we will have all the excuses to seek justice by force of arms."
 pact.215.a: "We support this initiative."
 pact.215.b: "What? No!"

 pact.216.t: "An Invitation to Belgrade?"
 pact.216.d: "The Belgrade Congress has extended an invitation to us. While they have clearly stated their goals to dismantle our ancient Monarchy, they seem willing to try an come to terms at the negotiating table first. Of course, we know their terms and they are completely unacceptable; it would be a complete waste of time to attend and we should instead prepare to mobilise against them."
 pact.216.a: "A chance for peace, perhaps?"
 pact.216.b: "We reject their ridiculous offer!"

 pact.217.t: "Austria Rebukes Our Efforts"
 pact.217.d: "Predictably, Vienna has refused to negotiate. As they clearly want the war that will finally bring the end of their rotten Empire, it is time for us to march towards our final battle to overthrow the Habsburg yoke."
 pact.217.a: "War it shall be, then."

 pact.300.t: "The Pact of Organisation"
 pact.300.d: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] is proposing to deepen ties between Balkan nations through an economic union. Should we sign their pact, an Economic Council will be formed to coordinate trade and economic interests of its member states. We will undoubtedly benefit from this close economic alliance."
 pact.300.a: "Of course, we can all benefit from this."
 pact.300.b: "This will result in a loss of independence!"

 BP_economic_integration_tt: "§GWe shall become a member of the Pact of Organisation and receive its economic benefits§!."

 pact.301.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Refuses"
 pact.301.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government has refused to sign the Pact of Organisation, uninterested in closer economic ties in the Balkan region."
 pact.301.a: "Too bad for them."

 pact.302.t: "Formation of the Economic Council"
 pact.302.d: "With the ratification of the Pact of Organisation, the Economic Council is set to begin its work in coordinating trade and economic relations between its members."
 pact.302.a: "A closer, prosperous Balkans."

 pact.303.t: "Formation of the Economic Council"
 pact.303.d: "With the ratification of the Pact of Organisation, the Economic Council is set to begin its work in coordinating trade and economic relations between its members."
 pact.303.a: "A closer, prosperous Balkans."

 pact.304.t: "Report from the Economic Council"

 pact.305.d.revolution: "Our new socialist regime has declared all treaties with the Balkan Economic Council null and void, effective immediately. As such, we will no longer receive its benefits."
 pact.305.a: "Very well."

 pact.306.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Joins the Economic Council"
 pact.306.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government has signed the Pact of Organisation, having missed the formation of the Council before, and all members of the organisation no enjoy increased benefits from mutual economic cooperation."
 pact.306.a: "A closer, prosperous Balkans."

 pact.307.t: "Future of the Belgrade Pact"
 pact.307.d: "With our primary goal of defeating Austria achieved, many are asking the question: what now? Even though alliances in the Balkans have often been short-timed, some more idealistic voices have been promoting the idea of turning Belgrade Pact into long-term alliance, not only to defend the Balkans against foreign threats, but also to cooperate economically and bring prosperity to both Serbian and Romanian nations. More pessimistic voices point out all the perceived problems: ideological differences, West Banat, disbelief over whether the Balkan nations can really stand up against behemoths such as Germany and Russia on their own. Regardless, should our government endorse the idea of long-term cooperation, it would greatly increase the odds of our alliance staying together."
 pact.307.a: "We shed blood together, we shall stay together."
 pact.307.b: "Sorry, it was just one war thing."
