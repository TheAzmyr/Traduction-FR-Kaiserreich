### City Capture Events ###

 city_capture.251.t: "The Fall of London"
 city_capture.251.d.generic: "Reports from London confirm that the capital of [FROM.FROM.GetNameDef] has been captured by advancing [FROM.GetAdjective] troops after long, pitched battles across the Thames River. [FROM.FROM.GetAdjective] forces put up stiff resistance, hoping to delay the [FROM.GetAdjective] forces for as long as possible, but were eventually beaten back.\n\nFor the first time since 1216, London has fallen to a foreign invader. The atmosphere in the city is heavy, with gunfire still ringing out in the night as the [FROM.FROM.GetAdjective] forces retreat, leaving protestors and [FROM.GetAdjective] military police fighting in the streets."
 city_capture.251.d.entente: "Reports from London confirm that the capital of the syndicalist Union of Britain has been captured by advancing Canadian soldiers after furious battles across the Thames River. British forces put up stiff resistance, hoping to delay their royalist counterparts for as long as possible, but were eventually beaten back.\n\nAs the dust settles, it seems London is back in the hands of the government that abandoned it in 1925. The atmosphere in the city is still heavy, with spasms of gunfire still ringing out in the night as the syndicalist army retreats, leaving only protestors to fight the Canadian troops."
 city_capture.251.d.ireland: "In a shocking turn of events, reports from London confirm that the city has been captured by advancing [FROM.GetAdjective] troops after furious battles across the River Thames. Just a few short decades ago, it was the [FROM.FROM.GetAdjective] who were the ones seizing control of [FROM.GetAdjective] cities in the midst of the War of Independence, yet it seems the tables have been dramatically turned with the [FROM.GetAdjective] flag now raised up over London.\n\nWhile the [FROM.GetAdjective] troops have remained generally disciplined, despite some internal agitation to seek revenge against Britain, the atmosphere in the city is still heavy. The streets are still occasionally filled with spasms of gunfire as the [FROM.FROM.GetAdjective] forces retreat, leaving protestors and [FROM.GetAdjective] military police fighting in the streets."
 city_capture.251.a: "This is only a temporary setback!"
 city_capture.251.b: "This is the beginning of the end."
 city_capture.251.c: "With London in [FROM.GetAdjective] hands,\n[FROM.FROM.GetAdjective] defeat is inevitable."
 city_capture.251.e: "It seems the king has returned."
 city_capture.251.f: "Proudly high over London Town they hung out the flag of war."

 city_capture.252.t: "The Fall of Paris"
 city_capture.252.d.germany: "Reports from Paris confirm that the [FROM.FROM.GetAdjective] capital has been captured by advancing German troops after furious fighting across its large avenues and the Seine. [FROM.FROM.GetAdjective] forces put up stiff resistance, hoping to delay the German forces for as long as possible, but were eventually beaten back.\n\nAs shocked Parisians looked on, the German army once more paraded through the same path they had during the Weltkrieg, down the Champs-Elysées and towards the Eiffel Tower. This festive atmosphere finally descended into vicious urban combat with [FROM.FROM.GetAdjective] resistance in the dead of the night, as [GER.GetAdjective] tanks easily ploughed through inefficient barricades in the large Parisian avenues."
 city_capture.252.d.other: "Reports from Paris confirm that the [FROM.FROM.GetAdjective] capital has been captured by advancing [FROM.GetAdjective] troops after furious fighting across its large avenues and the Seine. [FROM.FROM.GetAdjective] forces put up stiff resistance, hoping to delay the [FROM.GetAdjective] forces for as long as possible, but were eventually beaten back.\n\nAs shocked Parisians looked on, the [FROM.GetAdjective] army paraded through the Champs-Elysées and towards the Eiffel Tower. This festive atmosphere eventually devolved into vicious urban combat, however, with [FROM.FROM.GetAdjective] resistance in the dead of the night and [FROM.GetAdjective] force easily ploughing through inefficient barricades in the large Parisian avenues."
 city_capture.252.a.germany: "The Germans will not win! France cannot fall again!"
 city_capture.252.a: "No! We cannot let Paris fall once again!"
 city_capture.252.b: "Our victory over [FROM.FROM.GetNameDef] is now all but assured."
 city_capture.252.c.germany: "This time, the end had to be bitter."
 city_capture.252.c: "It seems the fall of [FROM.FROM.GetNameDef] is now all but assured."

 city_capture.253.t: "The Fall of Berlin"
 city_capture.253.d.france: "Reports from Berlin confirm that the [FROM.FROM.GetAdjective] capital has been captured by advancing Communard troops after long, merciless fighting through the greatest city of the Reichspakt. [FROM.FROM.GetAdjective] forces put up stiff resistance, hoping to delay the Communard forces for as long as possible, but were eventually beaten back.\n\nAs shocked Berliners looked on, the Communard army paraded down the central archway of the Brandenburg Gate - an act formerly restricted to the Kaiser and his family alone - before organising a choir to sing the Internationale as the famous monument was draped with Communard banners for all the world to see. The next days have seen Communard forces rounding up [FROM.FROM.GetAdjective] soldiers and dignitaries, bringing them away in military police wagons."
 city_capture.253.d.lkmt: "Reports from Berlin confirm that the [FROM.FROM.GetAdjective] capital has been captured by advancing divisions of the National Revolutionary Army after long, merciless fighting through the capital of the Reichspakt. [FROM.FROM.GetAdjective] forces put up stiff resistance, hoping to delay the NRA troops for as long as possible, but were eventually beaten back.\n\nAs shocked Berliners looked on, the flag of the White Sun, Blue Sky, and Wholly Red Earth was raised over the heavily damaged Reichstag - an ironic fate for the German Empire as it was not too long ago that the German intervention had nearly destroyed the Kuomintang. It would appear that the Kuomintang has returned the humiliation of defeat."
 city_capture.253.d.other: "Reports from Berlin confirm that the [FROM.FROM.GetAdjective] city has been captured by advancing [FROM.GetAdjective] troops after long, merciless fighting through the greatest city of the Reichspakt. [FROM.FROM.GetAdjective] forces put up stiff resistance, hoping to delay the [FROM.GetAdjective] forces for as long as possible, but were eventually beaten back.\n\nAs shocked Berliners looked on, the [FROM.GetAdjective] army paraded down the Brandenburg Gate, before listening to a speech by [FROM.GetLeader] in front of the famous monument. However, what eventually seems to have caught the attention and memory of the world is a picture of a [FROM.GetAdjective] soldier proudly holding the [FROM.GetAdjective] flag from the roof of a heavily damaged Reichstag, taken by one of his squad mates."
 city_capture.253.a.france: "[FROM.FROM.GetNameDefCap] cannot end like this. Push the Communards back!"
 city_capture.253.a.lkmt: "How is this possible? This cannot be!"
 city_capture.253.a: "This cannot be! How could Berlin have fallen?!"
 city_capture.253.b.france: "Verdun, Chemin des Dames, Somme. They have all been avenged."
 city_capture.253.b.lkmt: "The Northern Expedition has been avenged."
 city_capture.253.b: "It is all but over for [FROM.FROM.GetNameDef], now."
 city_capture.253.c: "A great victory for [FROM.GetNameDef], indeed."

 city_capture.254.d.carlist: "Reports from Madrid confirm that the [FROM.FROM.GetAdjective] city has been captured by advancing [FROM.GetAdjective] troops after long, merciless fighting through the hilly terrain and the old city. [FROM.FROM.GetAdjective] forces put up stiff resistance, hoping to delay the [FROM.GetAdjective] forces for as long as possible, but were eventually beaten back.\n\nOfficial reports indicate that though looting has been widespread, monuments and noteworthy buildings have been entirely spared. With the fall of their capital, it is expected for [FROM.FROM.GetNameDef] to surrender soon, despite calls for merciless resistance from [FROM.FROM.GetAdjective] generals."
 city_capture.254.d.other: "Reports from Madrid confirm that the [FROM.FROM.GetAdjective] city has been captured by advancing [FROM.GetAdjective] troops after long, merciless fighting through the hilly terrain and the old city. [FROM.FROM.GetAdjective] forces put up stiff resistance, hoping to delay the [FROM.GetAdjective] forces for as long as possible, but were eventually beaten back.\n\nOfficial reports indicate that the Palacio Real de Madrid has been thoroughly pillaged by [FROM.GetAdjective] soldiers, ending up with the building burning down in the night, and that the Puerta de Alcalá was rigged with explosives and destroyed along with many more less noteworthy royal monuments. With the fall of their capital, it is expected for [FROM.FROM.GetNameDef] to surrender soon, despite calls for merciless resistance from [FROM.FROM.GetAdjective] generals."
 city_capture.254.a: "Without Madrid we are lost."
 city_capture.254.b: "Madrid is finally ours!"
 city_capture.254.c: "So falls the heart of [FROM.FROM.GetNameDef]."

 city_capture.255.t: "The Fall of Barcelona"
 city_capture.255.d: "Reports from Barcelona confirm that the [FROM.FROM.GetAdjective] city has been captured by advancing [FROM.GetAdjective] troops after pitched fights across the Serra de Collserola mountain range. [FROM.FROM.GetAdjective] forces put up stiff resistance, hoping to delay the [FROM.GetAdjective] forces for as long as possible, but were eventually beaten back.\n\nThere were reports of long urban fights through the Gothic Quarter of Barcelona, and sparse fighting along the Barcelonian Riviera. This same Riviera was the site of a long and luxurious parade by [FROM.GetAdjective] troops as they marched along the sunny beaches, a clear symbol that [FROM.GetNameDef] has taken control of the Catalonian city."
 city_capture.255.a: "This is not good..."
 city_capture.255.b: "Barcelona is finally ours!"
 city_capture.255.c: "So falls the heart of old Catalonia."

 city_capture.256.t: "The Fall of Burgos"
 city_capture.256.d.SPA: "Reports from Burgos confirm the Carlist temporary capital has been captured by advancing Spanish troops after skirmishes in the countryside. Carlist forces put up stiff resistance, hoping to delay the Spanish forces for as long as possible, but were eventually beaten back.\n\nCastilians fleeing north to the Basque coast tearfully described seeing their homeland burning and ravaged by this fraternal war and Spanish soldiers even committing atrocities on their own people. Rumours state King Javier was escorted out with the flow of refugees by Carlist militia, but his destination remains unknown. Many hope Carlist Spain might continue fighting in the hostile Iberian Central Plateau to protect their other strongholds."
 city_capture.256.d.SWF: "Reports from Burgos confirm the Carlist temporary capital has been captured by advancing Anarcho-Spanish troops after skirmishes in the hilly countryside. Carlist forces put up stiff resistance, hoping to delay the enemy forces, but were eventually beaten back.\n\nCastilians fleeing north to the Basque coast tearfully described seeing their homeland burning and CNT-FAI soldiers even committing atrocities on their own people. Rumours state King Javier was escorted out with the flow of refugees by Carlist militia, but his destination remains unknown. Many hope Carlist Spain might continue fighting in the central plateau to defend their homes from the crush of the syndicalist invasion."
 city_capture.256.a: "We shall not surrender! For Javier!"
 city_capture.256.b: "A crippling blow to Carlist dreams of conquest."
 city_capture.256.c: "Can the Carlists hope to come back from this?"

 city_capture.257.t: "The Fall of Gibraltar"
 city_capture.257.d: "Reports from Gibraltar confirm that the fortress has been captured by [FROM.GetAdjective] troops after rapid landings and skirmishes along the coast, with fighting moving towards the Rock of Gibraltar itself. [FROM.FROM.GetAdjective] forces put up stiff resistance, hoping to delay the [FROM.GetAdjective] invaders for as long as possible, but were eventually beaten back.\n\nWhile the capture of Gibraltar itself was swift, skirmishes in the tunnels running through the Rock lasted until late in the evening, until the encircled and desperate [FROM.FROM.GetAdjective] garrison announced its formal surrender."
 city_capture.257.a: "Now they control access to the Mediterranean..."
 city_capture.257.b: "The gateway to the Mediterranean is ours!"
 city_capture.257.c: "The mighty Rock of Gibraltar has fallen?"

 city_capture.258.t: "The Fall of Lisbon"
 city_capture.258.d: "Reports from Lisbon confirm that the [FROM.FROM.GetAdjective] city has been captured by advancing [FROM.GetAdjective] troops after skirmishes through the Serra de Monsanto and a rapid push towards the mouth of the Tagus River. [FROM.FROM.GetAdjective] forces put up stiff resistance, hoping to delay the [FROM.GetAdjective] forces for as long as possible, but were eventually beaten back.\n\nThe fight for Lisbon was complicated as the [FROM.FROM.GetAdjective] defenders intentionally destroyed Lisbon's bridges, forcing attackers to ford across the large river to fully capture the city. A ceremony was held in the Praça do Comércio where [FROM.GetAdjective] forces called for the surrender of all remaining [FROM.FROM.GetAdjective] soldiers in the hillsides."
 city_capture.258.a: "We will fight to the last!"
 city_capture.258.b: "Finally, Lisbon is under our control."

Is this the end of the socialist experiment in America?"

 city_capture.265.d.wca: "[FROM.GetAdjective] militias have been fighting sparse skirmishes with the Red Guard down the Hudson River. This morning, the palisades, both natural and man-made, fell from socialist hands. Not long after that Manhattan Island was forced to capitulate rather than risk the massive loss of life that urban warfare would bring. The defenders have ordered the remainder of the Red Guard to transport the gold from the Federal Reserve Building to safety, leaving behind many financial workers imprisoned on Welfare Island.\n\nThe whole of New York City is now under the control of [FROM.GetNameDef], and a massive relief effort is underway to assess the full scope of the damage the offensive did to the city."

Political prisoners were left in their prison cells in Welfare Island.\n\nThe fall of New York City strikes a major blow to the [FROM.FROM.GetAdjective] cause, as one of the greatest symbols of American prestige has fallen by force.

Despite the city's international protections, the victory came somewhat easily, as Shanghai's police forces and limited garrison could put up little resistance against a real army. The general population barely resisted, and their non-cooperation cannot have aided the already bare-bones defences.\n\nThe international city's future now seems unclear, as its prosperity has always been built on the backs of trade and foreign investment.

For many in China, the Chinese victory marks a final end to the Century of Humiliation by humbling its imperialist neighbour and rival.

[FROM.GetAdjective] troops were quick to surround the walled Old City and demand the surrender of [FROM.FROM.GetLeader], and when he failed to present himself, launch an assault that destroyed much of the old Manchu palace. [FROM.FROM.GetLeader] was never found.\n\nWith the city lost, it's rumoured that [FROM.FROM.GetLeader]'s subordinates are beginning to doubt his ability to protect Manchuria, much less unite all of China.

The [FROM.FROM.GetAdjective] forces were eventually dislodged, but not before tearing up the station's rails, leaving it mostly unusable for the time being.\n\nRegardless, the city's capture is a great victory for the [FROM.GetAdjective] campaign to conquer China.

For the rest of [FROM.FROM.GetNameDefCap] however the fall of Batavia is a devastating blow to national pride on top of a strategic disaster.

The ageing forts around the city were reactivated to provide some relief to the capital, but it was no use.

Yet, with the major arteries of Calea Victoriei, Queen Elisabeta Boulevard and Serban Voda Way captured, their fall is all but certain.\nThe residents dread what the occupation may bring, with the last one still in living memory, despite [FROM.GetAdjective] attempts to assuage local concerns.

 city_capture.305.b.japan: "We will never surrender to the Japanese dogs!"
 city_capture.305.c.japan: "The Japanese advance into China continues..."

 city_capture.306.t: "The Fall of Guangzhou"
 city_capture.306.d: "After fierce house-to-house fighting, [FROM.GetName] forces captured Guangzhou early this morning. Often known by the name \"Canton\" internationally, the port city is south China's largest industrial and commercial hub outside Hong Kong, and its loss will be a serious setback to [FROM.FROM.GetNameDef] war effort. Although the city's docklands and narrow alleyways seem secure, rumours speak of organising resistance in the Baiyun Mountains to the north, and from there perhaps an attempt to retake the city.\n\nSouth China and Guangdong in particular are known for their resistance to outside control, be it from Beijing or elsewhere. Holding the city could be more than [FROM.GetLeader] bargained for."
 city_capture.306.a: "The port of Canton has been taken!"
 city_capture.306.b: "A defeat but one that we shall return from!"
 city_capture.306.c: "A great loss for [FROM.FROM.GetName]"
 city_capture.306.d.japan: "After a bombardment audible eighty miles away in Hong Kong, Guangzhou fell to [new_controlled.GetName] forces earlier today. The city hasn't seen such a siege since the German response to the Severn Note in October 1926, but unlike the Kaiserliche Marine, its occupiers appear inclined to stay. A military headquarters has already been established at the provincial governor's office, with an encampment under construction close by at Yuexiu Hill.\n\nHowever, rumours speak of organising resistance in the Baiyun Mountains to the north, and from there perhaps an attempt to retake the city. South China and Guangdong in particular are known for their resistance to outside control, be it from Beijing or elsewhere. Holding the region could be more than Japan bargained for."
 city_capture.306.a.japan: "With Guangzhou secured, Southern China is ours!"
 city_capture.306.b.japan: "We will never surrender to the Japanese dogs!"
 city_capture.306.c.japan: "The Japanese now control the Pearl River..."

 city_capture.307.t: "The Fall of Chongqing"
 city_capture.307.d: "As the furthest navigable point on the mighty Yangtze, the streets of Chongqing once brimmed with refugees; rich and poor alike, all fleeing the unstoppable Japanese advance. That was several days ago. As the city sirens wailed, and the thunder and flash of artillery marked the final stand of its defenders on the river's eastern bank, the city again emptied. The stampede claimed almost as many lives as the invaders.\n\nNow the streets are quiet, filled only by smoke, debris, and bodies. With the fall of Chongqing, little lies between Japan and the total domination of southwestern China."
 city_capture.307.a: "Another glorious victory!"
 city_capture.307.b: "A serious loss, but we will recover!"
 city_capture.307.c: "A major step toward Japan realising her ambitions."

 city_capture.308.t: "The Fall of Kunming"
 city_capture.308.d: "For the first time since the defeat of the Three Feudatories in 1681, the city of Kunming has fallen to an invader from outside Yunnan Province. After losing the Wujiaba aerodrome to the southeast, [FROM.FROM.GetNameDef] forces were gradually forced back along Lake Dian, only to finally break as the city's ancient walls were overrun.\n\nAs [FROM.GetNameDef] troops march beneath the iconic Jinma-Biji arches, their leaders must sit content with the knowledge that they control not only the prolific Kunming Arsenal, but also the terminus to the hugely profitable Kunming-Haiphong Railway."
 city_capture.308.a: "With this victory, our hold in the west of\nChina is secured."
 city_capture.308.b: "We will make our stand in the\nmountains beyond!"
 city_capture.308.c: "The mountains of Yunnan have a new master..."
 city_capture.308.d.japan: "For the first time since the defeat of the Three Feudatories in 1681, the city of Kunming has fallen to a foreign invader. After losing the Wujiaba aerodrome to the southeast, [FROM.FROM.GetNameDef] forces were gradually forced back along Lake Dian, only to finally break as the city's ancient walls were overrun.\n\nAs Japanese troops march beneath the iconic Jinma-Biji arches, their leaders must sit content with the knowledge that they control not only the prolific Kunming Arsenal, but also the terminus to the strategic Kunming-Haiphong Railway. Another great blow has been struck against China. Now that Japan has reached so far into the nation's interior, how many more can it take?"
 city_capture.308.a.japan: "The Chinese cannot flee from our advance!"
 city_capture.308.b.japan: "To the mountains! We will never surrender to them, never!"
 city_capture.308.c.japan: "The conquest of China may soon become a reality..."

 city_capture.309.t: "Zhang is Driven from Jinan!"
 city_capture.309.d_Zongchang: "Since 1925 the city of Jinan has come to mirror its master: corrupt and corpulent, brimming with vice and villainy. From his \"court\", Zhang Zongchang patronised everyone from artists and writers to playboys and prostitutes, executing any who crossed him, splitting heads as one might split melons. Everything was brought to an end as Jinan's defences collapsed earlier today.\n\nZhang himself could reportedly be heard bellowing above the din, perhaps overseeing the evacuation of his uncounted wealth. Now he is nowhere to be found, his harem abandoned, his sprawling mansion consumed by flames. Some say Zhang will return, either as a victor or in a coffin, a notion not without precedent. Once, despite defeat, he paraded through Jinan, sitting in a coffin and smoking a large cigar."
 city_capture.309.d_Tianran: "High upon Mount Tai, Zhang Tianran seemingly eschewed the ways of the world below, but in truth his reach stretched far beyond Shandong. Through the Yiguandao faith, his eyes and ears were everywhere, and often the sharp end of a knife.\n\nHowever, his followers are now in retreat, and even Mount Tai itself has been lost to a determined [FROM.GetName] offensive. The Shrine of the Blue Dawn, the Temple of the Jade King, and numerous other sacrosanct sites are now in the hands of irreverent soldiers; trampling through its sacred spaces, scattering statues, offerings, and incense; looting indiscriminately. Taishan may not recover for a generation, but Zhang's fate is anything but certain. This loss will no doubt incense his followers, and he has never been without a plan."
 city_capture.309.a: "Good riddance!"
 city_capture.309.b: "This is nothing but a tactical retreat!"
 city_capture.309.c: "An end to China's basest warlord?"
 city_capture.309.e: "An early end for a strange faith."

 city_capture.310.t: "The Fall of Alexandria"
 city_capture.310.d: "Founded by the legendary conqueror Alexander himself, the city of Alexandria was best known for housing wonders such as the Library of Alexandria and the Necropolis.\n\nHowever, history repeats itself as the ancient city has once again been conquered by a foreign power. After a heavy bombardment, the [FROM.FROM.GetAdjective]s were forced to retreat into the Citadel of Qaitbay. Surrounded on all sides and with their only escape being the sea, the [FROM.FROM.GetAdjective]s made a desperate defence. However, with their supplies being limited and morale low, the [FROM.FROM.GetAdjective] defenders had no choice but to offer their unconditional surrender to the victorious [FROM.GetAdjective] army. Despite the great victory however, the [FROM.GetAdjective] forces have pledged not to harm the city's historical buildings."
 city_capture.310.a: "With this victory, the city of Alexander is ours!"
 city_capture.310.b: "A serious defeat! We will not tolerate it!"
 city_capture.310.c: "The city of Alexander has been conquered yet again..."
 city_capture.310.d.ottomans: "The city of Alexandria is one of cultural significance and pride to the Egyptian nation. The place of great ancient wonders like the Library of Alexandria, the city is truly an important centre of life, culture, and industry for Egypt.\nHowever, the Ottomans have made tremendous progress in their war with Egypt and her Arab allies as Ottoman forces this morning have captured the city and the port. The Egyptian navy managed to flee before the Ottoman forces had arrived but the remaining defenders were unable to push the Ottomans back. Surrounded on all sides and facing the might of the Ottoman army, the Egyptians routed from the city - once again the Ottomans are now in control of the ancient city. Despite the glorious Ottoman victory against their Egyptian enemies, the Ottomans have pledged not to destroy the city's ancient buildings."
 city_capture.310.a.ottomans: "With this victory, we advance further into Egypt!"
 city_capture.310.b.ottomans: "We will never surrender to the Turks! We will be back!"
 city_capture.310.c.ottomans: "The Ottomans have dealt a blow to the Cairo Pact."

 city_capture.311.t: "The Fall of [217.Controller.GetVictoryPointName_3529]"
 city_capture.311.d: "The city of [217.Controller.GetVictoryPointName_3529] has been an important centre of transportation and commercial activity for centuries due to its location. Despite explosive population growth, the city's poor conditions had turned it into a hotbed of revolutionary activity. During the Russian Civil War, the town became the site of an important battle and siege, and likewise, history repeats itself once more, as the city has once again become a battlefield.\n\nLarge parts of the city lay in ruins as bitter urban warfare, and aerial bombardments have reduced much of the urban centres into ruin. Despite a near-fanatical resistance from [FROM.FROM.GetAdjective] forces, the [FROM.GetAdjective] army announced today that the city has fallen into their hands."
 city_capture.311.a: "Not one step back! We will return!"
 city_capture.311.b: "A glorious victory, soon the Russian Bear\nwill fall."
 city_capture.311.c: "Russia further staggers in its war."

 city_capture.312.t: "The Fall of [653.Controller.GetVictoryPointName_1821]"
 city_capture.312.d: "Nestled on the eastern side of Russia's Ural Mountains and bisected by the Iset River, the city of [653.Controller.GetVictoryPointName_1821] is notable for being a grand city connecting Russia's eastern and western halves. The city was also where the former Russian imperial family was imprisoned before their unfortunate execution.\n\nHard times seem to have fallen on the city once more however as [FROM.FROM.GetAdjective] forces abandoned the city in the wake of the approaching [FROM.GetAdjective] armies. The [FROM.FROM.GetAdjective] war effort has suffered a tremendous defeat with the loss of this critical junction connecting Europe and Asia and the valuable resources of the Urals."
 city_capture.312.a: "The end is near for Mother Russia."
 city_capture.312.b: "With this victory, the Russian war effort has been dealt a tremendous blow."
 city_capture.312.c: "The end appears near for the Russians."
