### Shared Decisions ###

 india_invade_tawang_decision: "Demand [858.GetName]"
 india_invade_tawang_decision_desc: "During the original chaos that led to the collapse of Britain's dominion over India, the border territory of [858.GetName] fell under the occupation of local rulers. Now that the subcontinent is once again unified, it is finally time to seek a restoration of the nation's proper borders."
 india_invade_aksai_chin_decision: "Demand [897.GetName]"
 india_invade_aksai_chin_decision_desc: "All of Kashmir is part of India, regardless of any Chinese claims to the contrary, and this of course extends to the northernmost part of the region that has unfortunately fallen under foreign occupation. A request should therefore be sent to [FROM.GetName] to demand their evacuation from the region so that it can finally be fully under [ROOT.GetAdjective] administration."
 india_tackle_resistance_decision: "Tackle Resistance"
 india_tackle_resistance_decision_desc: "Even with India united there are still countless bitter about their defeat, ready to send the nation back into chaos if they ever get the opportunity to do so. We must dedicate significant resources to ensure that these dissenters are dealt with, using both the carrot and the stick when needed."
 india_increase_integration_efforts_in_state_decision: "Increase Integration Efforts in [FROM.GetName]"
 india_increase_integration_efforts_in_state_decision_desc: "While with enough time our men on the ground will ensure that [FROM.GetName] is properly integrated into the restored nation, it may be prudent to send them additional help to speed up these integration efforts, especially in the more important regions of the country."

 india_reintegration_category: "Reintegration of India"

### Shared Events ###

 india.1.t: "Choosing the Capital of [ROOT.GetNameDef]"
 india.1.d.RAJ: "With India finally unified, it is time to rebuild and decide on where we want the capital of the country to be. While Lahore has served us well, it may be wise to move to Delhi, where great work took place before the revolution to turn it into a fitting capital for the nation. Alternatively, we can go back to Calcutta, the old capital of British India, where the period of industrial growth under the Bharatiya People's Republic and its proximity to the coast could be a useful asset to India's trade with the rest of the world. Bombay, meanwhile, has always been one of the most industrious cities on the subcontinent, and unlike Delhi or Calcutta the lack of revolutionary change under the princes could lead to a much smoother restoration of the old administration if chosen as a capital.\n\nAlternatively however, we could simply choose to stay in Lahore, that has stayed our provisional capital, while we slowly integrate the rest of the country and rid it of reactionary and radical elements."
 india.1.d.HND: "With India finally unified, it is time to rebuild and decide on where we want the capital of the country to be. We could opt for Delhi where progress to turn it into the centre of the Raj's administration since 1911 was cut short by the British Revolution, although it is a reminder of our colonial past. Bombay, meanwhile, has always been one of the most industrious cities on the subcontinent, and one to which socialism may easily take hold.\n\nWhile moving to one of these locations could help raise support from the people, they still have yet to understand the benefits of socialism under our leader, [ROOT.GetLeader]. Staying in Calcutta, the home of the revolution, would also be symbolic for generations to come."
 india.1.d.PRF: "With India finally unified, it is time to rebuild and decide on where we want the capital of the country to be. We could opt for Delhi where progress to turn it into the centre of the Raj's administration since 1911 was cut short by the British Revolution, although it is a reminder of our colonial past and [ROOT.GetLeader] has always wanted his independence from the rest of India. Alternatively, we can move to Lahore, the old provisional capital of British India, and many of the great empires of the subcontinent's past, if we too wish to claim succession to their great legacies.\n\nStaying in Hyderabad may also be a fitting choice, where the decades of investment have brought with it new public services, educational and financial institutions in addition to the modern infrastructure needed for a modern capital. The potential resistance that may be faced in Lahore or Delhi by those still rejecting the subcontinent's future also makes Hyderabad a fitting choice, although ultimately in time such resistance is unlikely to last."
 india.1.a: "The former capital, Delhi."
 india.1.b: "Let's return to the old, Bengali capital."
 india.1.c: "It's time for Bombay to shine."
 india.1.e: "The great city of Lahore shall serve us well."
 india.1.d: "Let us stay where we are currently."

 india.10.t: "The Devastation of India"
 india.10.d: "At last, the war that first started over a decade ago has finally reached its end, but this victory is anything but glorious. The nation now lies in ruins, with thousands dead, homes reduced to rubble, and what little was left of the Indian economy lying in tatters. Worse still, the fighting is not truly over, with many still loyal to the false governments refusing to lay down their arms and accept the new status quo. While one great struggle is now behind us, it is clear that a new great struggle to recover from this conflict has now begun."
 india.10.a: "At least the nation is whole again, what's left of it anyway."

 india.50.t: "Dealing With Nepal"
 india.50.d: "In the aftermath of the Raj's collapse, [NEP.GetNameDef] utilised the chaotic situation to seize several low-lying districts at the foothills of the Himalayas. With all of India finally reunited, many of the hawks within the cabinet are demanding the return of this unlawfully occupied territory. Some are even calling for the inclusion of Nepal into a wider customs union combined with a military treaty."
 india.50.a: "Demand the return of the occupied districts!"
 india.50.b: "Claim the districts and press for a friendly government!"
 india.50.c: "Press for a friendly government!"

 india.51.t: "The Demands of [From.GetNameDef]"
 india.51.d.return: "We are under pressure from the resurgent [From.GetAdjective] government to secede the districts we conquered in the aftermath of the British Raj's collapse."
 india.51.d.govt: "We are under pressure from the resurgent [From.GetAdjective] government to secede the districts we conquered in the aftermath of the British Raj's collapse. Furthermore they demand that we surrender our de facto independence."
 india.51.a: "We have no choice but to comply."
 india.51.b: "Tell them that mighty Nepal shall defend her conquests!"

 india.52.t: "Nepal Submits"
 india.52.d.return: "Left with little choice, the [From.GetAdjective] government has turned our territory back over to our control."
 india.52.d.govt: "Left with little choice, the [From.GetAdjective] government has turned over our territory and submitted to [Root.GetAdjective] de facto control."
 india.52.a: "Was there any other doubt?"

 india.53.t: "Nepal Refuses!"
 india.53.d: "Amazingly, the [From.GetAdjective] has refused our demand, saying that if we wish to retake the Indian lowlands then we shall have to do so by force!"
 india.53.a: "Then war it is!"
 india.53.b: "Perhaps another time..."

 india.60.t: "[From.GetName] Seizes Indian Territories!"
 india.60.d: "While we are occupied with our war, [From.GetAdjective] soldiers swept into our territories in the Indian Ocean and seized control of our local forces almost before they could lift a finger. [From.GetNameDefCap] claims these territories to be rightfully theirs, and for the moment there seems to be little we can do about it... except for outright declaring war."
 india.60.a: "This outrage will not go unanswered!"
 india.60.b: "This means war!"

 india.61.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] and the Return of our Indian Colonies"
 india.61.d: "The [From.GetAdjective] government has just proposed a deal that would transfer some of the territories we snatched after the collapse of the British Raj back to [From.GetNameDef]. This could be a good way to improve relations with the national government, but could also set a dangerous precedent in our other colonies."
 india.61.a: "Hand over the isles to the Indians."
 india.61.b: "No, these naval bases are vital to the Kaiserliche Marine."

 india.62.t: "The Transfer of the German Colonies"
 india.62.d: "We have managed to convince the Germans to return some of the colonies taken by the Reich after the Raj collapsed. This is both a great sign of Indo-German friendship, but also proof that we truly have obtained the mandate as legal successor to the British. Glory to India!"
 india.62.a: "Merge the isles into our nation!"
 india.62.b: "Grant Ceylon wide internal autonomy and incorporate the atolls."

 india.63.t: "[From.GetName] Has Refused"
 india.63.d: "Representatives from the [From.GetAdjective] government notified us that returning the Indian Ocean territories is simply impossible, as they are vital to the Kaiserliche Marine."
 india.63.a: "I see..."

 india.65.t: "[From.GetName] Seizes [seized_state.GetName]!"
 india.65.d: "[From.GetAdjective] soldiers swept into [seized_state.GetName] this morning and seized control of our local forces almost before they could lift a finger. [From.GetNameDefCap] claims [seized_state.GetName] to be rightfully Indian territory, and for the moment there seems to be little we can do about it."
 india.65.a: "These vultures!"
 india.65.b: "This outrage will not go unanswered!"

 india.70.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Demands [858.GetName]"
 india.70.d: "With the Indian subcontinent now once again unified by [FROM.GetNameDef] they have begun to seek the full restoration of their old borders, and have demanded that the border territory of [858.GetName] be transferred to them. While such a claim is obviously entirely false, it seems unlikely that such a resurgent power will simply drop the matter if refused, and will likely seek to enforce their claim through war, and it must be decided if the nation is prepared for such an eventuality."
 india.70.a: "We have no choice but to comply"
 india.70.b: "We will not cede anything to these tyrants!"

 india.71.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Agrees to Return [858.GetName]"
 india.71.d: "A response has been received from [FROM.GetName], and they have smartly decided to peacefully comply and have agreed to return the occupied territory of [858.GetName] to [ROOT.GetAdjective] rule."
 india.71.a: "It is good that they have seen reason."

 india.72.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Refuses to Return [858.GetName]"
 india.72.d: "In violation of [ROOT.GetAdjective] sovereignty over the region, [FROM.GetName] has refused to return [858.GetName] and have made clear their intention to maintain their occupation of it. It seems that it is now time to either back our words with force, or surrender the region to their permanent occupation."
 india.72.a: "It seems force is the only option left."
 india.72.b: "It is not worth fighting a war for such a minor dispute."

 india.75.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Demands [897.GetName]"
 india.75.d: "With the Indian subcontinent now once again unified by [FROM.GetNameDef] they have begun to seek the full restoration of their old borders, and have demanded that the border territory of [897.GetName] be transferred to them. While such a claim is obviously entirely false, it seems unlikely that such a resurgent power will simply drop the matter if refused, and will likely seek to enforce their claim through war, and it must be decided if the nation is prepared for such an eventuality."
 india.75.a: "We have no choice but to comply"
 india.75.b: "We will not cede anything to these tyrants!"

 india.76.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Agrees to Return [897.GetName]"
 india.76.d: "A response has been received from [FROM.GetName], and they have smartly decided to peacefully comply and have agreed to return the occupied territory of [897.GetName] to [ROOT.GetAdjective] rule."
 india.76.a: "It is good that they have seen reason."

 india.77.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Refuses to Return [897.GetName]"
 india.77.d: "In violation of [ROOT.GetAdjective] sovereignty over the region, [FROM.GetName] has refused to return [897.GetName] and have made clear their intention to maintain their occupation of it. It seems that it is now time to either back our words with force, or surrender the region to their permanent occupation."
 india.77.a: "It seems force is the only option left."
 india.77.b: "It is not worth fighting a war for such a minor dispute."

 india.80.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Demands Our Burmese Districts"
 india.80.d: "The cursed [From.GetAdjective] government is demanding the return of the Burmese territory we 'pacified' during the Raj's collapse. This is a shameful display of bad manners!"
 india.80.a: "It's no use fighting over these useless provinces."
 india.80.b: "We know of no 'Burmese' districts, this is Siam - one and indivisible!"
 india.80.c: "Rally our allies to our defence!"
 india.80.e: "Rally our overlord to our defence!"

 india.81.t: "[From.GetName] Submits"
 india.81.d: "The [From.GetAdjective] government has wisely caved to our demands and returned all occupied Burmese territory."
 india.81.a: "A wise move."

 india.101.t: "The Kaisar-i-Hind"
 india.101.d: "The ruling Nizam of the All-India Federation, Osman Ali Khan, has today proclaimed himself the true successor to the mantle of Kaisar-i-Hind - a title previously borne only by the Mughal and British emperors of the sub-continent.\n\nFollowing his coronation at a grand ceremony in Delhi, the new emperor triumphantly declared that the nation had at last reclaimed its rightful place in the world, and that he will guide it to a great new future. While cheered on by his supporters, many see this as little more than a pretentious act by Osman to further his own ego."
 india.101.a: "So pretentious!"

 india.102.chairman: "[HND.GetLeader] Elected Bharatiya Chairman"
 india.102.chairwoman: "[HND.GetLeader] Elected Bharatiya Chairwoman"
 india.102.intro: "In the aftermath of reunification, Bharatiya Chairman Abul Kasem Fazlul Huq announced his retirement from the position, hoping to have his deputy Jawaharlal Nehru succeed him. Soon after, years of factional politicking within the Indian National Congress finally reached their climax, with the leaders of the two other primary factions in the party challenging Nehru's bid."
 india.102.bose: "$india.102.intro$\n\nAfter weeks of a heated election campaign, the INC's membership have rejected Nehru's bid, and have instead selected Maximist leader Subhas Chandra Bose as their new chairman. Bose's election has been interpreted as a clear signal that even with the nation now united, the INC has no intentions of reigning back in its political militarism, with the new government expected to significantly expand upon it."
 india.102.nehru: "$india.102.intro$\n\nAfter weeks of a heated election campaign, Nehru has succeeded in seeing off his challengers, with the party selecting him as their new Chairman. Nehru's election has been interpreted as a clear signal that the Republic will reaffirm its commitment to the global socialist cause, and continue down an orthodox syndicalist direction."
 india.102.naidu: "$india.102.intro$\n\nAfter weeks of a heated election campaign, the INC's membership have rejected Nehru's bid, and have instead selected Agrarian leader Sarojini Naidu as their new chairwoman. Naidu's election has been interpreted as a clear signal of the INC's desire to return to Gandhian thought and home grown ideological beliefs, harmonised together with socialist ideals."
 india.102.a: "Interesting."

Now, it seems that the ceasefire has finally been broken, with hostilities resuming between the socialist Bharatiya People's Republic, and the anti-socialist signatories of the Bombay Pact, the Dominion of India and [PRF.GetName].\n\nThe conflict encompasses India's hundreds of millions of people, with each combatant having foreign backers. Regardless of its outcome, it is certain that the Indian civil war will be one of the twentieth century's most deadly."
