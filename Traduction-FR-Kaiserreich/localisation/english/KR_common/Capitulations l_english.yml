### Events ###
 capitulation_events.1.t: "Germany is Conquered"
 capitulation_events.1.d: "We have been beaten by our wretched enemies and our armies are collapsing across Europe. Though they have taken the Fatherland, the war is far from over!"
 capitulation_events.1.a: "Assume control of Mittelafrika - we shall fight on from there."
 capitulation_events.1.b: "There is nowhere to run. Surrender!"

 capitulation_events.2.t: "Militarists Push for Direct Control"
 capitulation_events.2.d: "As a result of the collapse of the German war effort in mainland Europe, the Schutztruppen have mobilised and are now seeking to seize power from the bureaucrats in charge. Their leadership has decreed that [MAF.GetLeader] is to step down immediately as Governor of Mittelafrika and that administrative duties are to be handed over to Schutztruppen officials as they arrive in [THIS.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. Mittelafrika is to be turned into a tool for the reclamation of Germany, and our colonial project is to be put on hold."
 capitulation_events.2.a: "Do these madmen think we can still win this? Our loyalty is to Berlin, whoever may hold it."
 capitulation_events.2.b: "Welcome the Schutztruppe and give in to their demands."

 capitulation_events.3.t: "Bureaucrats Win Power Struggle in [MAF.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]"
 capitulation_events.3.d: "The colonial administrators in Afrika see no reason to relent at this point; the war is lost already. They have declared that they will listen to whoever is in charge of [THIS.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] two weeks from now, leaving us no option but to collapse in the face of our enemies!"
 capitulation_events.3.a: "The ungrateful wretches!"

 capitulation_events.4.t: "Patriots in Control of Mittelafrika"
 capitulation_events.4.d: "The colonial administrators have made way for the Militarists; Germany shall yet be reclaimed!"
 capitulation_events.4.a: "We shall yet return!"

 capitulation_events.5.t: "The War with [SIA.GetNameDef]"
 capitulation_events.5.d: "It appears we need to deal with the continuing war in the Far East, with [SIA.GetAdjective] armies still fighting against our colonial forces in [GEA.GetNameDef]. Should we continue the war, one we almost certainly cannot hope to have much impact on with our scattered and beaten forces, or sue for peace?"
 capitulation_events.5.a: "Give them whatever they want."
 capitulation_events.5.b: "We will continue the war, if we must."

 capitulation_events.6.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Sues for Peace"
 capitulation_events.6.d: "The scattered forces of Germany, now rallying under makeshift command from Africa, have offered us much of the territory they hold in [GEA.GetNameDef], if we will only end the war now before they are drawn in further."
 capitulation_events.6.a: "An excellent plan."
 capitulation_events.6.b: "Much? We want it ALL."

 capitulation_events.7.t: "The War with [JAP.GetNameDef]"
 capitulation_events.7.d: "It appears we need to deal with the continuing war in the Far East, with [JAP.GetAdjective] armies still fighting against our colonial forces in [GEA.GetNameDef]. Should we continue the war, one we almost certainly cannot hope to have much impact on with our scattered and beaten forces, or sue for peace?"

 capitulation_events.8.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Sues for Peace"
 capitulation_events.8.d: "The scattered forces of Germany, now rallying under makeshift command from Africa, have offered us much of the colonial territory they hold in [GEA.GetNameDef], if we will only end the war now before they are drawn in further. Considering that refusing the deal will mean chasing after the Germans in Africa, perhaps we should consider their plan."
 capitulation_events.8.a: "An excellent idea."
 capitulation_events.8.b: "We will take everything they have."

 capitulation_events.9.t: "[GEX.GetNameDefCap] Sues for Peace"
 capitulation_events.9.d.siam: "The so-called Free German government, struggling to continue the fight from Africa, has arranged for a peace with [From.GetNameDef]. This will involve ceding much of our territory, and there seems little hope of continuing the fight on our own with so many Reich officials already abandoning their offices here in [GEA.GetNameDef]. Although local forces are committed to continuing the fight, without support from the homeland a swift defeat is likely imminent for these holdouts."
 capitulation_events.9.d.japan: "The so-called Free German government, struggling to continue the fight from Africa, has arranged for a peace with [From.GetNameDef]. This will involve our complete annexation, and there seems little hope of continuing the fight on our own with so many Reich officials already abandoning their offices here in [GEA.GetNameDef]. Although local forces are committed to continuing the fight, without support from the homeland a swift defeat is likely imminent for these holdouts."
 capitulation_events.9.a: "To the lifeboats! We're off to Africa!"
 capitulation_events.9.b: "We shall fight to the last!"

 capitulation_events.12.t: "Should we Continue the War?"
 capitulation_events.12.d: "The German government has collapsed and its command transferred to Africa, assuming control over their former colonies here. They still possess much of the colonial territory we claim, however, and are in considerable disarray. Should we demand that they turn over the territories, on threat of continuing the war, or end it now?"
 capitulation_events.12.a: "Demand the colonies."
 capitulation_events.12.b: "We have had enough of war with the Germans."

 capitulation_events.13.t: "The [NFA.GetAdjective] Threat"
 capitulation_events.13.d: "[NFA.GetNameDefCap] has issued a threat - either we turn over the colonies which once belonged to them, or they will continue their war against us. Considering our current state of disarray, it might be wise to accept their demands. If not, we will be fighting them here in Africa."
 capitulation_events.13.a: "Give them what they want, if it will end this."
 capitulation_events.13.b: "We face them here in Africa, then."

 capitulation_events.15.t: "[transferred_state.GetName] Is Ours"
 capitulation_events.15.d: "With the collapse of the German government, their hold over [transferred_state.GetName] has become untenable, and thus the local administration has surrendered to our forces to avoid the area falling into chaos."
 capitulation_events.15.a: "Marvellous."

 capitulation_events.23.t: "The German Collapse"
 capitulation_events.23.d.nowar: "While the last couple of days since the German collapse in Europe have been uncertain, fears that [Root.GetNameDef] would be left to its own devices are unfounded. The main German opposition has now established itself in Mittelafrika, and we have restored communications to their officials in Daressalam. Order, at least for the moment, has been restored."
 capitulation_events.23.d.war: "With the Germans having collapsed in Europe and barely holding on in Africa, the continuing war here in [Root.GetNameDef] has led to many of the colonial officials already having fled for the new capital in East Africa. Communications have not yet been restored, and it seems that - for the moment - we are on our own."
 capitulation_events.23.a: "That's a relief...?"
 capitulation_events.23.b: "We've been abandoned?!"

 capitulation_events.30.t: "Peace with the Internationale?"
 capitulation_events.30.d.britain: "With the successful occupation of France by our forces, many plans for the invasion of Britain have been drawn up, but none have been successful.\n\nAlthough the British government is wounded, they have successfully resisted our attempts to cross the English Channel, and with the defence of the shores taking up much needed resources, many in our government have come with a proposal for a peace treaty with the remnants of the Internationale.\n\nWe will have full control of their continental European holdings, at the cost of recognising [ENG.GetNameDef]'s government. With anti-war sentiment growing within our borders as well as Britain's, many believe this can bring an end to this futile war, at least temporarily."
 capitulation_events.30.d.other: "The extermination of the Third Internationale in Europe has been completed, the lands of Britain and France having fallen to our superior forces.\n\nFollowing this, many in our government expected for the Internationale to collapse without a leader, but this has been untrue, as [INT.GetNameDef] has taken up the mantle of military leadership and railled its remaining members. Seeing as how far this nation is from our borders and supply lines, many in our government see it as a waste of resources to invade them.\n\nThus, a proposal for an official peace treaty has come from this faction of the government. Our hold on Europe will be strengthened, but the Internationale's existence as an obstacle to our world power will continue. With many in the Empire growing tired of war, it may be in our best interests to make this proposal of peace."
 capitulation_events.30.a: "It is time for an armistice."
 capitulation_events.30.b: "The only peace we will accept is unconditional surrender!"

 capitulation_events.31.t: "Germany Proposes Peace"
 capitulation_events.31.d.britain: "Over the course of the war, dark times have befallen our alliance. The Commune of France has collapsed, and we have had to take up the mantle as head of the revolution, and the Germans have attempted to invade Britain, but to no avail due to the tenacity of our people.\n\nHowever, on both sides, the scars begin to show, on both infrastructure and our people. Today, this came to a head when [FROM.GetNameDef] contacted us, offering to negotiate peace. In exchange for recognition of our government and the continuation of the Internationale's existence, we will lose all of our allies on mainland Europe.\n\nMany in our government consider this an insult, and urge to continue to fight for the revolution, while others believe that any attempt to reclaim our hold on Europe is futile, and we should accept this peace while we can, even at the cost of our humiliation. How shall we respond?"
 capitulation_events.31.d.other: "Dark times have befallen the Internationale. The two primary leaders of the alliance, Britain and France, have fallen to German invasion. Due to our own power within the alliance, we have taken up the mantle of leaders of the revolution.\n\nBut on both sides, the prospect of total victory grows more distant by the day. Our people grow tired of the state of war, and this seems to have come to a head today, as the German Empire has approached us with a proposal: in turn for us abandoning our European holdings and making peace with the Germans, our government will be recognised and the Internationale as an entity will continue, under our leadership.\n\nAlthough this will solidify us as leaders of the world revolution and bring the war to a close, such a peace treaty would leave us humiliated and as losers of the Second Weltkrieg. Many in our government wish for the war to end, while many others want to continue to fight for the revolution. How shall we respond?"
 capitulation_events.31.a: "This war is lost. Sign it."
 capitulation_events.31.b: "The Revolution must fight on! Reject it!"

 capitulation_events.32.t: "The Internationale Accepts Peace"
 capitulation_events.32.d.britain: "The war is over. Although we hoped to eliminate the revolution completely after France's defeat, these hopes did not come to fruition. Britain has responded with an acceptance of our proposal, seemingly suffering from the same damage as we are facing now. With Britain and the Third Internationale surviving, many across the Empire question how long this peace will last until Europe breaks out into all-out war again."
 capitulation_events.32.d.other: "The war is over. With the occupation of the Internationale's European allies, the remaining members have accepted that that could not go on longer. They have accepted peace, and although the threat in Europe is eliminated, many wonder how long it will take until the new leader of the Internationale can strike back at us. But for now, we have won the day."
 capitulation_events.32.a: "Europe is at peace!"

 capitulation_events.33.t: "The Internationale Refused Peace!"
 capitulation_events.33.d.britain: "Our proposal for peace has been met with a reprisal from Britain, saying that our government simply wishes to humiliate Britain again with this peace, and the terms are unacceptable. It seems that the war can now only end with the invasion of Britain, or the fall of Berlin to British forces..."
 capitulation_events.33.d.other: "Our proposal for peace has not been received well by [INT.GetNameDef], and they have responded with a resounding 'no' to our request for peace. It seems that the stubborn revolutionaries wish to fight on, and the war will only end with the unconditional surrender of one of the sides. We must prepare for an invasion..."
 capitulation_events.33.a: "We will finish what we started in 1919."

 capitulation_events.34.t: "Peace with [INT.GetNameDef]?"
 capitulation_events.34.d: "[GER.GetNameDefCap] has negotiated a peace treaty with [INT.GetNameDef], since it's clear the [INT.GetAdjective] have lost their will to carry on the war. This might be a chance for us to end our war with them, as well. Should we take advantage of the opportunity, or continue the battle?"
 capitulation_events.34.a: "Let's end this now!"
 capitulation_events.34.b: "No, we continue the war!"

 capitulation_events.35.t: "The Treaty of [INT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]"
 capitulation_events.35.d.britain: "An announcement was made today by [GER.GetLeader] announcing the signing of a peace between the Third Internationale and the Reichspakt. Germany, despite capturing Paris for the third time in seventy years, was unable to facilitate an arrival in Britain.\nThus, a peace has been signed between the two war-torn factions: the Third Internationale shall remain an entity, under the leadership of [ENG.GetNameDef], at the cost of its continental allies to German control. [ENG.GetLeader] has attempted to remain optimistic, calling out to remaining allies across the world that the revolution is not dead yet, and that Britain will carry on France's torch.\nBut one thing is clear: Britain and France have been humiliated by the Germans for a second time in recent history, and only time will tell if they can strike back."
 capitulation_events.35.d.america: "An announcement was made today by [GER.GetLeader] that the Weltkrieg in the West has ended. Although Germany has claimed victory over the European revolution, there remains the new revolutionary titan across the sea, [WCA.GetNameDef].\nThus, [WCA.GetNameDef] and [GER.GetNameDef] have signed a peace treaty that has allowed the Third Internationale as an entity to continue its existence, under the leadership of America, at the cost of the Internationale's European allies to German occupation. President [WCA.GetLeader] has attempted to remain optimistic, vowing to their remaining allies that they will carry Europe's torch of the revolution, but many see this as an affirmation of German hegemony in Europe. Only time will tell if the revolution can survive without the guidance of France and Britain."
 capitulation_events.35.d.other: "An announcement was made today by [GER.GetLeader] that the Weltkrieg in the West has ended. Although the Communards were defeated and Germany claimed victory over the European revolution, [INT.GetNameDef] yet remains in existence.\nFacing the prospect of grueling transcontinental warfare, [INT.GetNameDef] and [GER.GetNameDef] have signed a peace treaty allowing the Third Internationale to continue its existence, under the leadership of [INT.GetNonIdeologyName], at the cost of its former European allies undergoing German occupation. [INT.GetLeader] vowed to their remaining allies that they will carry Europe's torch of the revolution, but many see this as an affirmation of German hegemony in Europe. Only time will tell if the revolution can survive without the guidance of France and Britain."
 capitulation_events.35.a: "Is history doomed to repeat itself?"

 capitulation_events.40.t: "Paris has Fallen"
 capitulation_events.40.d: "It appears we must once again face the ignominy of occupation by a foreign power, as Paris has fallen to enemy control. Resistance throughout France has begun, but how long can we maintain it? There are many both within our nation as well as without who claim we were not a legitimate government to begin with. So long as the people are on our side, however, we still have a chance!"
 capitulation_events.40.a: "We have not lost yet!"

 capitulation_events.41.t: "The French Capitulation"
 capitulation_events.41.d.ger: "With the Commune of France's defeat, we have been asked to turn over control of our controlled territories in France to the German Empire, to better organise the occupation of the region and force an eventual French submission."
 capitulation_events.41.d.nfa: "With the Commune of France's defeat, we have been asked to turn over control of our controlled territories in France to [NFA.GetNameDef], their proper owner. It will be up to them to oversee the occupation and deal with any lingering Communard resistance."
 capitulation_events.41.a: "Of course!"
 capitulation_events.41.b: "No, we shall keep what we currently control."

 capitulation_events.42.t: "French Resistance Collapses"
 capitulation_events.42.d: "The occupation of Paris has been solidified, with the various pockets of resistance having been finally been defeated and the legitimacy of our exiled government having been reduced to tatters. The French refusal to admit that we have been defeated once again has finally crumbled in the wake of its inevitability."
 capitulation_events.42.a: "Alas."

 capitulation_events.43.t: "Germany Offers Occupied Territory"
 capitulation_events.43.d: "Perhaps in the interest of undermining the legitimacy of the Communard exiles, [GER.GetNameDef] has made an offer to the [Root.GetAdjective] government: control over a small number of provinces in the south of France. They make no promises come the eventual peace conference following the eventual collapse of the Communard resistance. For now, they are willing to simply turn over occupation to us."
 capitulation_events.43.a: "That is a good deal - we'll take it!"
 capitulation_events.43.b: "No, we won't deal with the Germans!"

 capitulation_events.44.t: "The French Refuse"
 capitulation_events.44.d: "Despite the benefit it would offer them come the eventual peace conference for French territory, [NFA.GetNameDef] has refused our generous offer."
 capitulation_events.44.a: "So be it."

 capitulation_events.45.t: "The French Agree"
 capitulation_events.45.d: "Obviously delighted by our generosity, [NFA.GetNameDef] has agreed to our offer and has already moved [NFA.GetAdjective] troops into some of the southern territories."
 capitulation_events.45.a: "Excellent!"
