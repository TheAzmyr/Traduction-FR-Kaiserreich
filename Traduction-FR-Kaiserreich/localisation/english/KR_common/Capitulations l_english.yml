### Events ###
 capt.1.t: "Germany is Conquered"
 capt.1.d: "We have been beaten by our wretched enemies and our armies are collapsing across Europe. Though they have taken the Fatherland, the war is far from over!"
 capt.1.a: "Assume control of Mittelafrika - we shall fight on from there."
 capt.1.b: "There is nowhere to run. Surrender!"

 capt.2.t: "Germany Demands Direct Control"
 capt.2.d: "As a result of the collapse of the German war effort in mainland Europe, the Kaiser has decreed that [MAF.GetLeader] is to immediately step down as Governor of Mittelafrika and transfer administrative duties to Reich officials as they arrive in Africa. Mittelafrika is to be absorbed by Germany directly, with our colonial rule ended."
 capt.2.a: "Lapdogs no longer! Declare the independence of the Mittelafrikan Empire!"
 capt.2.b: "Welcome the exiled government and give in to their demands."

 capt.3.t: "Mittelafrika Declares Independence"
 capt.3.d: "The colonial administrators in Afrika have gone mad! They have declared outright independence from the Reich, leaving us no option but to collapse in the face of our enemies!"
 capt.3.a: "The ungrateful wretches!"

 capt.4.t: "Mittelafrika Accepts Reich Control"
 capt.4.d: "The colonial administrators wisely decided to cede full control of Mittelafrika back to the Kaiser's officials."
 capt.4.a: "We now rule from Afrika."

 capt.5.t: "The War with [SIA.GetNameDef]"
 capt.5.d: "It appears we need to deal with the continuing war in the Far East, with [SIA.GetAdjective] armies still fighting against our colonial forces in [GEA.GetNameDef]. Should we continue the war, one we almost certainly cannot hope to have much impact on with our scattered and beaten forces, or sue for peace?"
 capt.5.a: "Give them whatever they want."
 capt.5.b: "We will continue the war, if we must."

 capt.6.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Sues for Peace"
 capt.6.d: "The scattered forces of Germany, now fled to Africa, have offered us much of the territory they hold in [GEA.GetNameDef], if we will only end the war now before they are drawn in further."
 capt.6.a: "An excellent plan."
 capt.6.b: "Much? We want it ALL."

 capt.7.t: "The War with [JAP.GetNameDef]"
 capt.7.d: "It appears we need to deal with the continuing war in the Far East, with [JAP.GetAdjective] armies still fighting against our colonial forces in [GEA.GetNameDef]. Should we continue the war, one we almost certainly cannot hope to have much impact on with our scattered and beaten forces, or sue for peace?"

 capt.8.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Sues for Peace"
 capt.8.d: "The scattered forces of Germany, now fled to Africa, have offered us much of the colonial territory they hold in [GEA.GetNameDef], if we will only end the war now before they are drawn in further. Considering that refusing the deal will mean chasing after the Germans in Africa, perhaps we should consider their plan."
 capt.8.a: "An excellent idea."
 capt.8.b: "We will take everything they have."

 capt.9.t: "[GEX.GetNameDefCap] Sues for Peace"
 capt.9.d.siam: "The German government, now fled to Africa and in utter disarray, has arranged for a peace with [From.GetNameDef]. This will involve ceding much of our territory, and there seems little hope of continuing the fight on our own with so many Reich officials already abandoning their offices here in [GEA.GetNameDef]. Our government is in complete disarray, and without support from the homeland it seems there is little we can do."
 capt.9.d.japan: "The German government, now fled to Africa and in utter disarray, has arranged for a peace with [From.GetNameDef]. This will involve our complete annexation, and there seems little hope of continuing the fight on our own with so many Reich officials already abandoning their offices here in [GEA.GetNameDef]. Our government is in complete disarray, and without support from the homeland it seems there is little we can do."
 capt.9.a: "To the lifeboats! We're off to Africa!"

 capt.12.t: "Should we Continue the War?"
 capt.12.d: "The German government has collapsed and fled to Africa, assuming control over their former colonies here. They still possess much of the colonial territory we claim, however, and are in considerable disarray. Should we demand that they turn over the territories, on threat of continuing the war, or end it now?"
 capt.12.a: "Demand the colonies."
 capt.12.b: "We have had enough of war with the Germans."

 capt.13.t: "The [NFA.GetAdjective] Threat"
 capt.13.d: "[NFA.GetNameDefCap] has issued a threat - either we turn over the colonies which once belonged to them, or they will continue their war against us. Considering our current state of disarray, it might be wise to accept their demands. If not, we will be fighting them here in Africa."
 capt.13.a: "Give them what they want, if it will end this."
 capt.13.b: "We face them here in Africa, then."

 capt.15.t: "[transferred_state.GetName] Is Ours"
 capt.15.d: "With the collapse of the German government, their hold over [transferred_state.GetName] has become untenable, and thus the local administration has surrendered to our forces to avoid the area falling into chaos."
 capt.15.a: "Marvellous."

 capt.23.t: "The German Collapse"
 capt.23.d.nowar: "While the last couple of days since the German collapse in Europe have been uncertain, fears that [Root.GetNameDef] would be left to its own devices are unfounded. The main German government has moved to Mittelafrika, and we have restored communications to their officials in Daressalam. Order, at least for the moment, has been restored."
 capt.23.d.war: "With the Germans having collapsed in Europe and fled to Africa, the continuing war here in [Root.GetNameDef] has led to many of the colonial officials already having fled for the new capital in East Africa. Communications have not yet been restored, and it seems that - for the moment - we are on our own."
 capt.23.a: "That's a relief...?"
 capt.23.b: "We've been abandoned?!"

 capt.30.t: "Peace with the Internationale?"
 capt.30.d.britain: "With the successful occupation of France by our forces, many plans for the invasion of Britain have been drawn up, but none have been successful.\n\nAlthough the British government is wounded, they have successfully resisted our attempts to cross the English Channel, and with the defence of the shores taking up much needed resources, many in our government have come with a proposal for a peace treaty with the remnants of the Internationale.\n\nWe will have full control of their continental European holdings, at the cost of recognising [ENG.GetNameDef]'s government. With anti-war sentiment growing within our borders as well as Britain's, many believe this can bring an end to this futile war, at least temporarily."
 capt.30.d.other: "The extermination of the Third Internationale in Europe has been completed, the lands of Britain and France having fallen to our superior forces.\n\nFollowing this, many in our government expected for the Internationale to collapse without a leader, but this has been untrue, as [INT.GetNameDef] has taken up the mantle of military leadership and railled its remaining members. Seeing as how far this nation is from our borders and supply lines, many in our government see it as a waste of resources to invade them.\n\nThus, a proposal for an official peace treaty has come from this faction of the government. Our hold on Europe will be strengthened, but the Internationale's existence as an obstacle to our world power will continue. With many in the Empire growing tired of war, it may be in our best interests to make this proposal of peace."
 capt.30.a: "It is time for an armistice."
 capt.30.b: "The only peace we will accept is unconditional surrender!"

 capt.31.t: "Germany Proposes Peace"
 capt.31.d.britain: "Over the course of the war, dark times have befallen our alliance. The Commune of France has collapsed, and we have had to take up the mantle as head of the revolution, and the Germans have attempted to invade Britain, but to no avail due to the tenacity of our people.\n\nHowever, on both sides, the scars begin to show, on both infrastructure and our people. Today, this came to a head when [FROM.GetNameDef] contacted us, offering to negotiate peace. In exchange for recognition of our government and the continuation of the Internationale's existence, we will lose all of our allies on mainland Europe.\n\nMany in our government consider this an insult, and urge to continue to fight for the revolution, while others believe that any attempt to reclaim our hold on Europe is futile, and we should accept this peace while we can, even at the cost of our humiliation. How shall we respond?"
 capt.31.d.other: "Dark times have befallen the Internationale. The two primary leaders of the alliance, Britain and France, have fallen to German invasion. Due to our own power within the alliance, we have taken up the mantle of leaders of the revolution.\n\nBut on both sides, the prospect of total victory grows more distant by the day. Our people grow tired of the state of war, and this seems to have come to a head today, as the German Empire has approached us with a proposal: in turn for us abandoning our European holdings and making peace with the Germans, our government will be recognised and the Internationale as an entity will continue, under our leadership.\n\nAlthough this will solidify us as leaders of the world revolution and bring the war to a close, such a peace treaty would leave us humiliated and as losers of the Second Weltkrieg. Many in our government wish for the war to end, while many others want to continue to fight for the revolution. How shall we respond?"
 capt.31.a: "This war is lost. Sign it."
 capt.31.b: "The Revolution must fight on! Reject it!"

 capt.32.t: "The Internationale Accepts Peace"
 capt.32.d.britain: "The war is over. Although we hoped to eliminate the revolution completely after France's defeat, these hopes did not come to fruition. Britain has responded with an acceptance of our proposal, seemingly suffering from the same damage as we are facing now. With Britain and the Third Internationale surviving, many across the Empire question how long this peace will last until Europe breaks out into all-out war again."
 capt.32.d.other: "The war is over. With the occupation of the Internationale's European allies, the remaining members have accepted that that could not go on longer. They have accepted peace, and although the threat in Europe is eliminated, many wonder how long it will take until the new leader of the Internationale can strike back at us. But for now, we have won the day."
 capt.32.a: "Europe is at peace!"

 capt.33.t: "The Internationale Refused Peace!"
 capt.33.d.britain: "Our proposal for peace has been met with a reprisal from Britain, saying that our government simply wishes to humiliate Britain again with this peace, and the terms are unacceptable. It seems that the war can now only end with the invasion of Britain, or the fall of Berlin to British forces..."
 capt.33.d.other: "Our proposal for peace has not been received well by [INT.GetNameDef], and they have responded with a resounding 'no' to our request for peace. It seems that the stubborn revolutionaries wish to fight on, and the war will only end with the unconditional surrender of one of the sides. We must prepare for an invasion..."
 capt.33.a: "We will finish what we started in 1919."

 capt.34.t: "Peace with [INT.GetNameDef]?"
 capt.34.d: "[GER.GetNameDefCap] has negotiated a peace treaty with [INT.GetNameDef], since it's clear the [INT.GetAdjective] have lost their will to carry on the war. This might be a chance for us to end our war with them, as well. Should we take advantage of the opportunity, or continue the battle?"
 capt.34.a: "Let's end this now"
 capt.34.b: "No, we continue the war!"

 capt.35.t: "The Treaty of [INT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]"
 capt.35.d.britain: "An announcement was made today by [GER.GetLeader] announcing the signing of a peace between the Third Internationale and the Reichspakt. Germany, despite capturing Paris for the third time in seventy years, was unable to facilitate an arrival in Britain.\nThus, a peace has been signed between the two war-torn factions: the Third Internationale shall remain an entity, under the leadership of [ENG.GetNameDef], at the cost of its continental allies to German control. [ENG.GetLeader] has attempted to remain optimistic, calling out to remaining allies across the world that the revolution is not dead yet, and that Britain will carry on France's torch.\nBut one thing is clear: Britain and France have been humiliated by the Germans for a second time in recent history, and only time will tell if they can strike back."
 capt.35.d.csa: "An announcement was made today by [GER.GetLeader] that the Weltkrieg in the West has ended. Although Germany has claimed victory over the European revolution, there remains the new revolutionary titan across the sea, [CSA.GetNameDef].\nThus, [CSA.GetNameDef] and [GER.GetNameDef] have signed a peace treaty that has allowed the Third Internationale as an entity to continue its existence, under the leadership of America, at the cost of the Internationale's European allies to German occupation. President [CSA.GetLeader] has attempted to remain optimistic, vowing to their remaining allies that they will carry Europe's torch of the revolution, but many see this as an affirmation of German hegemony in Europe. Only time will tell if the revolution can survive without the guidance of France and Britain."
 capt.35.d.other: "An announcement was made today by [GER.GetLeader] that the Weltkrieg in the West has ended. Although the Communards were defeated and Germany claimed victory over the European revolution, [INT.GetNameDef] yet remains in existence.\nFacing the prospect of grueling transcontinental warfare, [INT.GetNameDef] and [GER.GetNameDef] have signed a peace treaty allowing the Third Internationale to continue its existence, under the leadership of [INT.GetNonIdeologyName], at the cost of its former European allies undergoing German occupation. [INT.GetLeader] vowed to their remaining allies that they will carry Europe's torch of the revolution, but many see this as an affirmation of German hegemony in Europe. Only time will tell if the revolution can survive without the guidance of France and Britain."
 capt.35.a: "Is history doomed to repeat itself?"

 capt.40.t: "Paris has Fallen"
 capt.40.d: "It appears we must once again face the ignominy of occupation by a foreign power, as Paris has fallen to enemy control. Resistance throughout France has begun, but how long can we maintain it? There are many both within our nation as well as without who claim we were not a legitimate government to begin with. So long as the people are on our side, however, we still have a chance!"
 capt.40.a: "We have not lost yet!"

 capt.41.t: "The French Capitulation"
 capt.41.d.ger: "With the Commune of France's defeat, we have been asked to turn over control of our controlled territories in France to the German Empire, to better organise the occupation of the region and force an eventual French submission."
 capt.41.d.nfa: "With the Commune of France's defeat, we have been asked to turn over control of our controlled territories in France to [NFA.GetNameDef], their proper owner. It will be up to them to oversee the occupation and deal with any lingering Communard resistance."
 capt.41.a: "Of course"
 capt.41.b: "No, we shall keep what we currently control"

 capt.42.t: "French Resistance Collapses"
 capt.42.d: "The occupation of Paris has been solidified, with the various pockets of resistance having been finally been defeated and the legitimacy of our exiled government having been reduced to tatters. The French refusal to admit that we have been defeated once again has finally crumbled in the wake of its inevitability."
 capt.42.a: "Alas"

 capt.43.t: "Germany Offers Occupied Territory"
 capt.43.d: "Perhaps in the interest of undermining the legitimacy of the Communard exiles, [GER.GetNameDef] has made an offer to the [Root.GetAdjective] government: control over a small number of provinces in the south of France. They make no promises come the eventual peace conference following the eventual collapse of the Communard resistance. For now, they are willing to simply turn over occupation to us."
 capt.43.a: "That is a good deal - we'll take it!"
 capt.43.b: "No, we won't deal with the Germans"

 capt.44.t: "The French Refuse"
 capt.44.d: "Despite the benefit it would offer them come the eventual peace conference for French territory, [NFA.GetNameDef] has refused our generous offer."
 capt.44.a: "So be it."

 capt.45.t: "The French Agree"
 capt.45.d: "Obviously delighted by our generosity, [NFA.GetNameDef] has agreed to our offer and has already moved [NFA.GetAdjective] troops into some of the southern territories."
 capt.45.a: "Excellent"

 capt.100.t: "Our Dire Situation"
 capt.100.d.rsa: "The situation our previous government has left us in is dire indeed. Germany and its allies have firm control over Eastern Europe and much of Russia, and there seems little hope of a comeback for us. If we surrender to Germany now, it means laying out the welcome mat for Vasily Boldyrev to take over the Russian government and transform the nation into a German ally. No doubt it also means surrendering any and all claims to Germany's allies and giving up much of our territory to new German puppets - demands that will go well beyond the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, though at least it seems possible that Boldyrev could prevent Russia from being saddled with decades of punishing reparations. Should we refuse, it seems likely that Germany will eventually force our surrender anyhow or crush us completely."
 capt.100.d.norsa: "The situation our previous government has left us in is dire indeed. Germany and its allies have firm control over Eastern Europe and much of Russia, and there seems little hope of a comeback for us. If we surrender to Germany now, it means being forcibly disarmed, stripped of our allies and any parts of our land the Germans feel they can turn into new puppets... as well as being saddled with decades of harsh reparations. All of it goes way beyond the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, but what option do we have, now? Should we refuse, it seems likely that Germany will eventually force our surrender anyhow or crush us completely."
 capt.100.a: "We have no choice but to recognize our defeat"
 capt.100.b: "No! We will not give up, now or ever!"

 capt.101.t: "Russian Capitulation?"
 capt.101.d.rsa: "The new Russian government has assessed its situation and rightly decided that their situation is untenable. They've sent word to us and offered to surrender. If we agree, it means allowing Vasily Boldyrev to take over the Russian government, transforming it into an independent ally within the Reichspakt. We'll also reduce their military capabilities, though not completely - we do, after all, still need Boldyrev as our ally. Combined with turning over all claimed lands belonging to German allies and any territories we could potentially release as new German puppets, this should be enough to transform the balance of power in Europe completely. A few lone ministers are worried that Russia could end up again at odds with Germany within a decade or two... but, for now, this does seem like the best option."
 capt.101.d.norsa: "The new Russian government has assessed its situation and rightly decided that their situation is untenable. They've sent word to us and offered to surrender. If we agree, it means forcing them to terms that go way beyond what the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk imposed: complete military disarmament, the assumption of a war indemnity for at least the next 20 years, the handing over of all claimed territories to our allies and any lands we could potentially release as new puppets. There are a few in the German government who say that such harsh measures could only mean a resumption of conflict with Russia a decade or two from now... but what option are we left with? Brest-Litovsk did not do the trick, but perhaps this will."
 capt.101.a: "Let's head to the negotiating table, then"
 capt.101.b: "Surrender? Not until we've crushed them completely!"

 capt.102.t: "Germany Refuses Peace"
 capt.102.d: "The German government has all but laughed at our offer of peace. According to them, forcing a treaty on us will only mean repeating the mistake of Brest-Litovsk and a resumption of war within ten or twenty years. No, they apparently wish to crush us completely."
 capt.102.a: "So be it! A battle to the bitter end!"

 capt.103.t: "Germany Offers Peace"
 capt.103.d.rsa: "Once again we find ourselves at the brink of a humiliating defeat against Germany. They have firm control over Eastern Europe and much of Russia, and there seems little hope of a comeback for us. If we surrender now, it means laying out the welcome mat for Vasily Boldyrev to take over the Russian government and transform the nation into a German ally. No doubt it also means surrendering any and all claims to Germany's allies and giving up much of our territory to new German puppets - demands that will go well beyond the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, though at least it seems possible that Boldyrev could prevent Russia from being saddled with decades of punishing reparations. Should we refuse, it seems likely that Germany will eventually crush and annex us completely."

All of it goes way beyond the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, but what option do we have, now? Should we refuse, it seems likely that Germany will eventually crush and annex us completely."

 capt.110.t: "The Treaty of Tsaritsyn"
 capt.110.d: "Representatives from the Reichspakt and [RUS.GetNameDef] met in Tsaritsyn today to quickly hammer out the terms of Russia's surrender, terms that go way beyond anything we experienced at the end of the First Weltkrieg. It is a humiliating moment, made even more so by the ascension of Vasily Boldyrev to the Presidential seat. He and his fellows from the so-called Free Russian Army are hurriedly taking over the government to prepare the way for Russia to become the newest member of the Reichspakt... and a lapdog of German whims in perpetuity, without a doubt."
 capt.110.a: "A sad day for Mother Russia"

 capt.111.t: "The Treaty of Tsaritsyn"
 capt.111.d: "Representatives from the Reichspakt and [RUS.GetNameDef] met in Tsaritsyn today to quickly hammer out the terms of Russia's surrender, terms that go way beyond anything we experienced at the end of the First Weltkrieg. It was also an opportunity for Vasily Boldyrev to make his first public statements as the new President of Russia, whereby he explained the goals of the Free Russian Army and its plan to bring Russia into the Reichspakt as a new member of Germany's world order. For now, the government is under military control, but Boldrev assured all at the treaty talks that a transition to democracy would be forthcoming."
 capt.111.a: "The Free Russian Army prevails!"

 capt.112.t: "Russia Collapses"
 capt.112.d.east: "We knew that it was coming: Russia has proven unable to withstand the German onslaught, and so history repeats itself. They have met with Reichspakt representatives in Tsaritsyn to hash out terms of Russia's surrender, and now they have reached out to us. [Root.GetNameDefCap] would be covered by the terms of the treaty, if we agree. We would surrender any and all claimed territories to Germany and its allies, and our government would be replaced by one more amenable to German control. An insult, but what is the alternative? Can we withstand the might of the Reichspakt on our own? If we refuse, it's possible the Germans might give up the war anyhow... but is the gamble worth it?"
 capt.112.d.noteast: "We knew that it was coming: Russia has proven unable to withstand the German onslaught, and so history repeats itself. They have met with Reichspakt representatives in Tsaritsyn to hash out terms of Russia's surrender, and now they have reached out to us. [Root.GetNameDefCap] would be covered by the terms of the treaty - so long as we surrender any claimed lands to Germany and its allies, the Germans will allow us to go in peace. If we refuse, it's possible the Germans might give up the war anyhow... but is the gamble worth it?"
 capt.112.a: "We will sign the treaty"
 capt.112.b: "We will not sign! Let them come, if they wish!"

 capt.113.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Refuses Peace"
 capt.113.d: "The [From.GetAdjective] government has thumbed its nose at the Treaty of Tsaritsyn, refusing to sign. Should we pursue war with them, or leave them be?"
 capt.113.a: "Let them go, it's not worth pursuing"
 capt.113.b: "Then the war continues!"

 capt.114.t: "The Treaty of Tsaritsyn"
 capt.114.d: "Representatives from the Reichspakt and [RUS.GetNameDef] met in Tsaritsyn today to quickly hammer out the terms of Russia's surrender, terms that go way beyond anything we experienced at the end of the First Weltkrieg. It is a humiliating moment, made even more so when our army leaders had to thank Germany for their 'generosity' in allowing Russia to assume war indemnities in exchange for our freedom... a freedom that will come at the cost of complete disarmament, leaving us wide open to attack from any of our enemies."
 capt.114.a: "A sad day for Mother Russia"

 capt.120.t: "Breakdown of Order in Russia"
 capt.120.d.nowar: "As is hardly unexpected, news of our second defeat at the hands of Germany rippled throughout all of Russia. There are massive protests in the streets, and communications have quickly become impossible with Central Asia and anywhere beyond the Urals. It is all the remaining army can do to keep a lid of the unrest. If there is anything to be thankful for, it is that the violence is too random in order to lead to anything that could actually topple the interim government. The extremists are battling each other as much as our soldiers. It does, however, mean that we won't be able to do much if any groups decide now is a good time to grab land or declare independence. If they do, we will simply have to relinquish our claims and give in."

There is simply no other option."
 capt.120.a: "Let's hope this escalates no further..."

 capt.121.t: "Breakdown of Order in Russia"
 capt.121.d: "Russia has fallen to the Germans once again, and there is such complete chaos just outside our borders that we really have no choice but to step in. These are [Root.GetAdjective] lands, after all, and it's abundantly clear that the interim Russian government will have no choice but to surrender any and all claims to it."
 capt.121.a: "A new day for [Root.GetNameDef]!"

 capt.122.t: "Breakdown of Order in Russia"
 capt.122.d: "Russia has foolishly fallen to the Germans once again, and there is such complete chaos throughout Siberia that it's quite obvious the interim Russian government has zero control over anything east of the Urals. We can march west and grab it all, and they will have little choice but to let us do so and beg us for peace. Alternatively, we could simply keep going. but there are many in our military who say we are overstretched as it is. We would need time to settle things in Siberia before looking to what remains of Russia. Perhaps it is better to be prudent?"
 capt.122.a: "Let's take Siberia, while we can"
 capt.122.b: "Why stop the war now? Onwards to Moscow!"

 capt.123.t: "Breakdown of Order in Russia"
 capt.123.d: "Russia has fallen to the Germans once again, and there is such complete chaos that the new government has no choice but to give in to any peace demands of ours, should we choose to end the war here. Any claims of ours or our allies would be immediately surrendered, no questions asked. Of course, the Russians are also weak. Is it worth pushing the war further?"
 capt.123.a: "Let's end this, while we can"
 capt.123.b: "Why stop the war now? Onwards to Moscow!"

 capt.124.t: "Russia Ready to Ally"
 capt.124.d.nowar: "President Boldyrev has sent word that his assumption of control over the Russian government is more or less complete. They will proceed towards a democratic restoration of the Russian Republic, but in the meantime, he has said Russia is read to assume our role as a member of the Reichspakt... if we still desire that."
 capt.124.d.war: "President Boldyrev has sent word that his assumption of control over the Russian government is more or less complete. They will proceed towards a democratic restoration of the Russian Republic, but in the meantime, he has said Russia is read to assume our role as a member of the Reichspakt. This does, of course, mean that we would need to go to war against those nations Russia has not capitulated to already. Are we ready to do so?"
 capt.124.a: "Yes, by all means!"
 capt.124.b: "On second thought, they're too much trouble as an ally"

 capt.125.t: "Germany Refused Us?"
 capt.125.d: "Even though membership in the Reichspakt was part of the Treaty of Tsaritsyn, it appears the Germans have changed their minds. They are fine with Russia being left as an independent, yet neutral, nation on their eastern borders, and have only maintained military access to our lands, should it ever be needed."
 capt.125.a: "So be it!"

 capt.130.t: "The Treaty of Tsaritsyn"
 capt.130.d.boldyrev: "TEMP: Russia has surrendered to Germany. Treaty signed at Tsaritsyn.

Not in showing the face of a despised conqueror to the rest of the world, as Germany did? Not only that, if we are forces to take over Germany, we will be dealing with rebellious (and rightfully hateful) Germans for decades to come. There are those who suggest harsher or even punishing terms, however. Yes, the chances are higher that the Germans would become stubborn and refuse... but, if they do, so what? Then we crush them completely and take away Germany's role as European hegemon. This is our chance to make them truly suffer, as we did!"

[FER.GetNameDefCap], they say, is a product of Japanese investment in the future, and they expect us to join their alliance immediately... and, in exchange, they will help us conquer all of Siberia. This seems fine, except there are elements within the Circle of St. George who strenuously object to this move. These are Russian officers who have always been leery of acting as Japanese puppets and seen their involvement in [FER.GetNameDefCap] as being for Russia's greater good, so this move has alarmed them enough that they are accusing Grigory Semyonov of treason against Russia. They will move against Semyonov, if they are not put down immediately."

Semyonov has been overthrown and this so-called 'Circle of Saint George' has taken over, declaring Japan to be just as much their enemy as the current Russian government. They've refused our soldiers access to their territory, though they are certainly happy to keep all the equipment we provided to help them gain their current position. So much for arranging a buffer state between ourselves and Russia."

 capt.250.a: "We agree to the demands..."
 capt.250.b: "We will fight all the way to Tokyo, if we must!"
 capt.251.t: "The Treaty of Seishin"
 capt.251.d.fer: "Victory! With the aid of Japan, we have fought our way across Siberia and wrested it from Russian hands. The Japanese are perhaps being a bit too obvious that they are 'allowing' us to take most of the spoils, and that they fully expect us to remember their aid. Perhaps it doesn't matter, because we have indeed carved out our empire in the east!"
 capt.251.d.jap: "Today we stand victorious against Russia! After all our historical clashes, this has been a decisive blow in our favor, one that shall be remembered for ages to come!"
 capt.251.a: "Siberia is ours!"
 capt.251.b: "Glory to [Root.GetNameDef]!"
 capt.252.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Refuses"
 capt.252.d: "It appears [From.GetNameDef] still does not know when it is defeated, and has spurned our efforts at peace. We will have no choice now but to ground them into dust."
 capt.252.a: "This is going to take a while..."
 capt.260.t: "Continue the War with Russia?"
 capt.260.d.fer.cancontinue: "As expected, the war to conquer Siberia is dragging on interminably. We can choose to continue the war or try to end it now, though ending it requires both the Russian government to agree as well as for us to abandon our allies in [FER.GetNameDef]."
 capt.260.d.fer.notcontinue: "As expected, the war to conquer Siberia is dragging on interminably, and there is little political will to continue this fighting merely for [FER.GetNameDef]'s sake. We will be forced to abandon them to Russia, and cut our losses while we can... assuming the Russian government is as tired of the fighting as we are."
 capt.260.d.nofer.cancontinue: "The war with [RUS.GetNameDef] has dragged on much longer than we thought it would. Now is the time to consider whether we should continue on, change our objectives, or cut our losses and end the war completely... assuming the Russian government is as tired of the fighting as we are."
 capt.260.d.nofer.notcontinue: "The war with [RUS.GetNameDef] has dragged on much longer than we thought it would. Sadly, there is little political will to continue this fighting, and we will be forced to sue for peace with the Russian government... assuming they are as tired of the fighting as we."
 capt.260.a: "We will continue on with our current objectives"
 capt.260.b: "Switch to claiming the Transamur region, and nothing else"
 capt.260.c: "Switch to claiming the Far East, everything east of Irkutsk"
 capt.260.e: "Switch to claiming all of Siberia"
 capt.260.f: "Yes, it's time to end this war..."
 capt.261.t: "Japan Continues the War"
 capt.261.d: "The war with [JAP.GetNameDef] has dragged on interminably, but it appears they have dug deep and are determined to continue the fighting at least for now."
 capt.261.a: "Let's get to it, then!"
 capt.262.t: "Japan Wishes Peace"
 capt.262.d.cancontinue: "We have received several Japanese envoys, expressing a desire to end the state of war between us. We could continue on, though it would require digging deep. Either that or we can agree, and cut our losses."
 capt.262.d.notcontinue: "We have received several Japanese envoys, expressing a desire to end the state of war between us. Frankly, there is not enough political will in [RUS.GetNameDef] to continue the fighting, so we will be forced to agree and cut our losses."
 capt.262.a: "Too bad for them -- we fight on!"
 capt.262.b: "We must first consider our demands..."
 capt.262.c: "Yes, let's end this now..."
 capt.263.t: "[RUS.GetNameDefCap] Refuses Peace"
 capt.263.d: "The Russian government has spurned our offer of peace. They have dug deep and are determined to fight on."
 capt.263.a: "So be it!"
 capt.264.t: "[RUS.GetNameDefCap] Agrees to White Peace"
 capt.264.d: "It seems the Russians are as eager to end the fighting as we are. The war is over, with nothing gained by either of us for all the fighting."
 capt.264.a: "What a waste"
 capt.265.t: "Japan Abandons Us"
 capt.265.d: "It appears the Japanese did not have the stomach to remain in the war for the long haul. They have signed a separate peace with the Russians and abandoned us to our fate."
 capt.265.a: "We'll show them!"
 capt.266.t: "Our First Demand"
 capt.266.d.fer.no: "Ranking members of the Russian army have been discussing what would make for our most appropriate demand... and the feeling is that demanding the complete annexation of land currently held by [FER.GetNameDef] would be sufficient. We have not pushed far enough elsewhere to get more, and that is certainly our highest priority."
 capt.266.d.fer.yes: "Ranking members of the Russian army have been discussing what would make for our most appropriate demand... and the feeling is that demanding the complete annexation of land currently held by [FER.GetNameDef] is a given. That is our highest priority. The question, then, is what we would ask for next?"
 capt.266.d.ferfact.yes: "Ranking members of the Russian army have been discussing what would make for our most appropriate demand... and the feeling is that requiring Japan to abandon their alliance with [FER.GetNameDef] is certainly a start. That is our highest priority. The question, then, is what we would ask for next?"
 capt.266.d.nofer.yes: "Ranking members of the Russian army have been discussing what would make for our most appropriate first demand from the Japanese."
 capt.266.a: "That will have to do, then"
 capt.266.b: "First, we must demand Sakhalin's return"
 capt.266.c: "First, we require the return of Port Arthur"
 capt.266.e: "There is argument over our priorities..."
 capt.267.t: "The Return of Port Arthur"
 capt.267.d.more: "While there is much argument over which demands should or should not be made in the peace treaty, the one which has consistently come up is the return of Port Arthur, currently called [745.GetName], a former Russian concession situated at the extreme southern tip of the Liaodong Peninsula. It having been taken by the Japanese in 1905 was a matter of pride for the country, and its return will be symbolic. There are more demands for us to consider, but it is agreed that this should be first."

 capt.270.d: "We have watched as each of our holdings on the mainland fall to Russia and its allies, and now it appears the inevitable has occurred: the Russians have approached us with an offer to end the war, but only should we give up all their objects. This includes everything we hold or influence in Mongolia, Xinjiang, Korea, Manchura, and the northern islands. A humiliating defeat, if accepted, but this may be the only way to prevent an even longer and unending war, one that might end in [JAP.GetNameDef]'s ultimate annexation."
