# Russia starts the war
 worldnews.1.t: "Russia Invades the Reichspakt"
 worldnews.1.d.starts_wk: "For two decades, Germany and Russia have been at peace. Despite the animosity left by Russian defeat in the Great War, the price of five years of foreign and civil war was steep - and neither side wished to pay it again. Not everyone was convinced that this would last.\n\nToday, the sceptics were proven correct: after years of military rearmament and revanchist sentiment, Russia has repudiated the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk and proclaimed their intent to forcefully reverse what they describe as German overlordship over Eastern Europe. As Germany and her allies mobilise against this long-feared threat, Russian artillery strikes have been reported on German positions across the Russian border - the inauguration of the second great war in a generation to shake the continent of Europe."
 worldnews.1.d.joins_wk: "While long anticipated, the outbreak of war between the Internationale and Germany was a dramatic shock - the last time there was war between the great powers of Europe, it quickly spiralled to include the entire continent. Even if they wouldn't act instantly, it was already obvious that Russia, Germany's long-bitter eastern nemesis, has been growing more belligerent in recent years.\n\nAfter much anticipation, [RUS.GetLeader] made a speech early this morning declaring that, in light of recent years, German hegemony over the world has never been more of a myth. While it only obliquely referenced the war, the speech was otherwise bellicose - and was followed by aggressive army postures along Russia's border. Once more, Germany must fight a war on two fronts."

In this timeline, Theodore Roosevelt and his Bull Moose Party win the 1912 American presidential elections, leading to an American entry in the Weltkrieg and an Entente victory. A defeated and partially occupied Germany is gripped by constant economic and political crises, witnesses the defeat of the Whites in the Russian Civil War, and is couped by a bitter and extremely nationalist Adam Dressler. He leads the German Workers Party who follow the ideology of \"People's Socialism\", an extreme version of National Populism.\n\nThe novel ends with the beginning of a three-sided war between Dressler's \"New Reich\", the Western Entente led by the dominant British Empire, and a Soviet Russia led by Sergey Kirov. The book has divided critics, with some praising its attention to detail, while others criticise it for large flaws in historical logic.

 worldnews.400.d: "Getúlio Vargas has, over the last few years, immensely grown his grip over the state apparatus, as the instability in Brazil has been subsiding and he claims all credit for it. Now, in a bold move to ensure peace and stability, he has assumed total control over lawmaking and granted himself numerous emergency powers, \"until this age of turmoil in the world ends\".\n\nWhile certainly wars have flared up across the world since Black Monday struck the Berlin stock exchange, it makes this move no less of a brazen power grab. He has however great popular support in various states, and support of leadership in many states. Time will tell if this development will truly ensure a peaceful Brazil."
 worldnews.400.a: "Vargas has indeed assumed direct control."
 worldnews.400.b: "At least no more pretension of democracy, but a worrying development."

 worldnews.401.t: "Constitutionalist Revolt in Brazil"
 worldnews.401.d: "The state of São Paulo, perhaps the most powerful in Brazil, has taken up arms against Getúlio Vargas and his New State, claiming his rule to be an utterly unconstitutional dictatorship, after several attempts by the influential president to meddle in affairs of the state, including trying to impose a state president of his own trust rather than elected.\n\nNow, tensions have utterly boiled over, and nothing but war can happen between São Paulo and other states, who were called by the earlier to join them in their struggle. Time till tell if this call will be heard, or if the revolt will be snuffed out."
 worldnews.401.a: "Centralisation is never easy."
 worldnews.401.b: "A chance for the people?"

 worldnews.402.t: "Constitutionalist Revolt in Brazil Succeeds!"
 worldnews.402.d: "As Getúlio is arrested, and put on await for trial, the constitutionalist revolutionaries who fought so hard for this moment celebrate across Rio and Brazil.\n\nNow, the republic's previous framework will be re-instated, and will closely follow the political ways of the Second Republic, but with extra safeguards against ambitious would be dictators, and even greater autonomy for member states of the Union."
 worldnews.402.a: "Brazil's democracy gets a second chance."
 worldnews.402.b: "Workers dead for no change at all, sadly."

 worldnews.403.t: "Constitutionalist Revolt in Brazil Fails!"
 worldnews.403.d: "São Paulo may have been powerful, but it could not stand against the might of Brazil. As their surrender was accepted, pro Getúlio rallies broke throughout the nation, and few can doubt that the man's grip on power is in fact stronger than it ever was.\n\nWith most of his relevant opponents in exile or arrested, Getúlio can focus himself to other matters, for he certainly has won the dangerous game of Brazilian politics, and has a degree of control until now unprecedented in the hands of one man, even in the times of the monarchy in the nation."
 worldnews.403.a: "The New State made its show of force."
 worldnews.403.b: "Workers dead for no change at all, sadly."

 worldnews.404.t: "Imperial Restoration in Brazil"
 worldnews.404.d: "When the Empire of Brazil fell in 1889, Pedro II resigned himself to that fate, and refused to fight back. Since then, the republican United States of Brazil have been plagued by economic woes, corruption and even civil wars. Following a victory by the Integralists in elections, and a public consultation on the matter, today at the Candelária Cathedral in Rio the Emperor Pedro III of Brazil was crowned in an unusually lavish ceremony even for monarchic standards.\nNow, the Integralists and the new Emperor will set their sights in restoring the former glory of Brazil, and will no doubt change the nation in a perhaps irreversible fashion. While republican demonstrations were held at the time of the ceremony, they were swiftly dispersed by the Army, and the nation wonders if this Empire will finally bring peace to the troubled South American country."

 worldnews.405.t: "Rondon's Revolt"
 worldnews.405.d: "Cândido Rondon, a renowned and respected marshal of Brazil, has returned from one of his by now usual expeditions deep into the northern jungles. With his shock at the news of the Integralist efforts to restore the monarchy, as devout republican he openly voiced his discontent. The worried government in Rio de Janeiro ordered his arrest, however the man's loyal military men refused the order, and he rose in open revolt in the west of the country.\nWhile the revolt has a deep rooted republican origin, his support of local strongmen is also speculated to come from traditionally powerful politicians whom were losing power in the new Integralist order of things. It seems that Brazil is facing its second civil conflict in the century, and the nation holds its breath as open war is now inevitable."
 worldnews.405.a: "How can an old man be so stubborn?"
 worldnews.405.b: "A chance for the people?"

 worldnews.406.t: "Rondon's Revolt Crushed"
 worldnews.406.d: "Cândido Rondon's revolt has been crushed, and his forces have been utterly defeated. While the leader of the revolt could not be found, for he fled into the forest with his most loyal servicemen, the back of the republican movement was crushed, for the uprisings inspired by the man revealed the true allegiances of many a would be traitor in the nation.\n\nNow, the Integralists can follow through with their plans completely unabated."
 worldnews.406.a: "The empire struck back!"
 worldnews.406.b: "Workers dead for no change at all, sadly."

 worldnews.407.t: "Rondon's Revolt Triumphant"
 worldnews.407.d: "The republic stands strong and victorious in Brazil, as Cândido Rondon's daring revolt against the Integralist government resulted in a large scale conflict, and the defeat of that government, as various states joined the republican uprising and divided the already overstretched military. Rondon, under cheers from his fellow republicans, is now is thrust into a provisory presidency, a role he certainly never wanted, but has vowed to hold elections as scheduled, and not to take any radical measures.\n\nMany speculate the old man will finally retire, the great Revolution fought across Brazil being his final adventure."

 worldnews.408.t: "The Union of Brazil Is Proclaimed!"
 worldnews.408.d: "Uproar over diplomatic overtures with Syndicalist Chile caused a deep constitutional crisis, and resulted in a coup by members of the military who thought the ED was sliding into socialism. However, the coup was short lived, and the army loyalists have arrested or exiled most of their leadership. Even further, these officers have proclaimed the Union of Brazil, a syndicalist government, for after seeing the sweeping progress Chile made in its military since the revolution, many more officers leaned towards the left.\nNow, the Union will hold its First Congress of Trade unions, and will convene to choose which path Brazilian Socialism will take. Upon the news arriving of the so called Union of Brazil being proclaimed, multiple state governors have now openly rebelled, and will seek to restore the United States of Brazil to a democratic state."
 worldnews.408.a: "The syndicalist menace spreads!"
 worldnews.408.b: "A surprise, to be sure, but a welcome one."

 worldnews.409.t: "Reactionary Uprising Victorious in Brazil"
 worldnews.409.d: "The will of the people has been heard, proclaimed Rio Grande do Sul's strongman Getúlio Vargas as he spoke after a victorious march on Rio after he symbolically tied his horse to the Obelisk in Rio Branco avenue. The revolting barracks have been taken, and the so called Congress of Trade Unions closed. The republic's former framework will be re-established in due time, and the men responsible for this chaos, especially the \"syndicalist enabling\" Democratic Left's members, will be brought to courts.\n\nAfter the failure of this brief experiment, the nation hopes to finally find some peace, as the visible damage to many of the capital's main buildings stands as a grim reminder of the now called \"Commune of Rio\" and the fate of those who would revolt against the Republic."
 worldnews.409.a: "Disaster was averted."
 worldnews.409.b: "A regrettable step backwards."

 worldnews.410.t: "Reactionary Uprising Crushed in Brazil"
 worldnews.410.d: "With the end of the revolt and the surrender or exile of the involved state presidents, the Union of Brazil cemented its position in power. However, the conflict has left its scars, and already the cries of both amnesty and treason trials echo across the nation, as the intense resentment towards the central government does not fade with the end of the armed conflict.\n\nTruly, only the first step in what is sure to be an era of immense change in Brazil as a whole."

 worldnews.411.d: "Chen Tiaoyuan, leader of the Anqing Clique and now master of Eastern China, has officially recognised the Fengtian Government as the rightful national government of China. While not surprising given Fengtian's open support of the Anqing Clique during the League War, it still shocked many throughout China, but also Westerners wary of Japan's expanding influence throughout China.\n\nThis declaration will be remembered as an important day in Chinese history."

 worldnews.412.t: "The Beijing Reunification Conference"
 worldnews.412.d.chinese: "When Zhang Zuolin's Reunification Conference began in Beijing several weeks ago, few expected it to succeed. Foreign papers derided it, domestic papers doubted it, and even those attending felt a certain uncertainty. Nontheless, China has now passed a new threshold in her history as former enemies came together in order to put the country first, placing a great portion of the country beneath a single banner for the first time in decades.\n\nLooking ahead, the road to true unification remains long indeed, but now a great step has been taken - hopefully one to be followed by many more."
 worldnews.412.d.foreign: "When Zhang Zuolin's Reunification Conference began in Beijing several weeks ago, few expected it to succeed. China has long been fraught by internal conflict, and observers in Shanghai expected this latest unification effort to fall victim to the usual oriental squabbles. However it seems that Zhang possesses the subtle instinct and political finesse of only the highest class of mandarin, and he has now brought a great part of China together by diplomacy.\n\nStill, the country is not yet truly united, and Zhang's position of military superiority suggests that as always China needs the strong hand of effective authority to make and keep it whole."

 worldnews.414.d: "The United Baltic Duchy, a Baltic German substate of the German Empire, has finally disintegrated after several months of inner strife and partisan resistance by the Forest Brothers movement. Across the Duchy, any semblance of order has been lost and Baltic Germans flee their lands en masse.\n\nSome have ended up in Germany, whereas others have gathered in the free city of Riga, the last holdout of Baltic German rule. The conflict in the Baltics has been frozen and will surely renew in the future, but for now, Latvia and Estonia have asserted their independence."

 worldnews.415.d.natpop: "Founded in the ashes of the Russian Empire, the Kingdom of Finland had remained since the end of the Great War a nation thoroughly entrenched in the German sphere. It appear now though that this was not meant to last. In the wake of Black Monday, the Finnish government was thrown into crisis as political violence spiralled out of control. Unable to maintain order, the regime finally collapsed.\n\nThe ultranationalist Lapua Movement under Kurt Martti Wallenius, now leader of the Republic of Finland, marched on Helsinki, seizing power and unleashing a wave of violence against monarchists and socialists alike. Authoritarian, corporatist, and virulently anti-German, the movement no doubt represents a violent break with the old order."

What remained of the former colonial administration had retreated to Namibia, shocked, disgraced, and disorganised. It seems that this was not meant to be, however. Under the leadership of [NMB.GetLeader], the Germans launched a series of campaigns from Windhoek, determined to see the imperial banner fly once more from Zanzibar to the Gold Coast.
