### Set Up Events ###
 amcivwar.1.t.president: "President Reed Escapes to Chicago"
 amcivwar.1.t.not_president: "Jack Reed Calls for Action"

 amcivwar.1.d.president: "President Reed has escaped to Chicago and declared that MacArthur is a traitor to all the people of America. His calls have gained a great deal of support in the Steel Belt, and a number of governors have already announced that they do not recognise the 'illegitimate' authority of the current government. They have closed off their borders to American soldiers, raising a chilling spectre of the civil war the country experienced less than a century ago."
 amcivwar.1.d.macarthur: "Jack Reed has given a rousing a radio broadcast from Chicago, urging all his followers to rise up against the twin tyrants of General MacArthur and Huey Long. Within the hour, a number of governors across the Steel Belt have announced their support and declared both Huey Long and General MacArthur as having no true authority. The governors have been bolstered by Reed's supporters, who within days have overtaken army posts and erected road blocks throughout the northern states."

 amcivwar.1.d.nothing_is_done: "The violence in Pittsburgh was just the spark that was needed for Jack Reed to declare on the radio that President Olson is a puppet of the corporations and a dishonest conman, intent on selling out the American worker to the highest bidder. He said it is time for the worker to make a stand. A number of northern governors immediately declared their support for Reed, backed up by syndicalist militias who have spread throughout the states to block roads and take over army bases."
 amcivwar.1.d.revolt_against_compromise: "The compromise attempt has failed and with its failure, America has been broken. Jack Reed today announced that the workers of America must take a stand against the governments, and almost immediately a number of northern governors declared their support for him. They say President Olson and his government have no authority, demanding they surrender to a committee headed by Reed to oversee the restructuring of the government 'as the founding fathers intended'."
 amcivwar.1.d.assassination_long: "With chaos engulfing the country following the failed assassination of Huey Long, Reed has seized the moment and denounced the federal government as puppets of their capitalist masters. A number of northern governors immediately declared their support for Reed, declaring the 'morally bankrupt' government as having no true authority. These state governments are backed up by syndicalist militias who have spread throughout the states to block roads and take over army bases."
 amcivwar.1.d.assassination_reed: "The assassination attempt against Jack Reed has been foiled, and worse, the involvement of the federal government has been made public. This is all the justification the SPA needed. Jack Reed today denounced President [USA.GetLeader] and Huey Long both as traitors and tyrants, and has rallied his supporters to defend their way of life against tyranny. A number of northern governors immediately declared their support for Reed, backed up by syndicalist militias who have spread throughout the states to block roads and take over army bases."

 amcivwar.1.d.long_assassinated: "With chaos engulfing the country following the assassination of Huey Long, Jack Reed has seized the moment and denounced the federal government as tyrants and American democracy as truly dead. A number of northern governors immediately declared their support for Reed, declaring the 'morally bankrupt' government as having no true authority. These state governments are backed up by syndicalist militias who have spread throughout the states to block roads and take over army bases."
 amcivwar.1.d.austerity: "With his supporters fired up by the federal government's collusion with Huey Long and the AFP, Jack Reed has seized the moment and called on American workers to rise up against a tyrannical system which has betrayed them. A number of northern governors immediately declared their support for Reed, declaring the 'morally bankrupt' government as having no true authority. These state governments are backed up by syndicalist militias who have spread throughout the states to block roads and take over army bases."

 amcivwar.1.d.default: "The crackdown on the Socialist Party could have only had one outcome: to protect the rights of workers across the nation, Jack Reed has called upon the workers of America to stand up against their capitalist overlords, saying that decent Americans have a moral obligation to take action against President [USA.GetLeader] and the corruption he represents. A number of northern governors immediately declared their support for Reed, backed up by syndicalist militias who have spread throughout the states to block roads and take over army bases."

Both are tyrants that need to be toppled, and only the AFP, under his guidance, can cleanse America. He has gained ready listeners among a number of southern governors, all of whom have recognised that they recognise the authority of neither MacArthur nor President Reed."
 amcivwar.2.d.president_long: "President Huey Long has escaped to Baton Rouge and has declared that General MacArthur is a traitor to the people of America. He has gained ready listeners among a number of southern governors, all of whom have recognised that they no longer recognise MacArthur's authority, and demanded his resignation. Long has spoken on the radio, urging all Americans to support the legitimate President and fight against the tyranny MacArthur represents."

 amcivwar.2.d.revolt_against_compromise: "The compromise attempt has failed, and with its failure America has been broken. Huey Long declared on the radio today that the corrupt President Olson and the tyrannical Reed both must be stopped for the good of America, and has called for all decent Americans to rise up against them. A number of southern governors have put their support behind him, announcing that they do not see the Olson government as legitimate, and while they have not yet gone so far as to announce secession from the Union they have made it clear that they do not recognise the government's authority within their borders."

These state governments are backed up by Minutemen militias who have spread throughout the states to block roads and take over army bases."

 amcivwar.2.d.default: "Huey Long has declared that President [USA.GetLeader] is a tyrant and must be opposed. In a radio speech, he denounced the president for being in league with the syndicalists of the SPA, and accused him of doing nothing to stop the chaos. Long has vowed to restore order and destroy the corrupt government in Washington, and a number of southern governors immediately declared their support for him and demanded that [USA.GetLeader] immediately step down and turn over control to Long and a 'reconciliation committee' that would see a restructuring of the American government."

### End of Civil War ###
 amcivwar.24.t: "The End of the Second American Civil War"
 amcivwar.24.d.CSA: "What could have been the greatest capitalist oppressor of the 20th Century is now firmly under the control of the working class. Throughout the country, the working class celebrates its liberation from the depredations of their bourgeois masters. While there is still much to do, today we can celebrate this victory and savour the air of an America where, for the first time, each man is truly equal."
 amcivwar.24.d.TEX: "Huey Long and his allies have triumphed over all their enemies. With this victory, we can now celebrate a new era of peace. Though there is much rebuilding to do we shall take this time to celebrate our victory."
 amcivwar.24.d.USA: "The enemies of America have been destroyed. Once again, the South has been pacified, and the syndicalist menace has been suppressed. The threats to the American way of life have been destroyed, and the great system designed so wisely by the Founding Fathers has survived another threat. Now across the country, the people can rejoice and celebrate a new era of peace."
 amcivwar.24.d.PSA: "The enemies of America have been destroyed. Once again, the South has been pacified, the syndicalist menace has been suppressed, and the American Caesar has been vanquished. The threats to American democracy have been destroyed, and the great system designed so wisely by the Founding Fathers has survived another threat. Now across the country, the people can rejoice and celebrate a new era of peace."
 amcivwar.24.d.NEE: "When the nation fell into chaos in the spring of 1937, few in New England would have expected the old order to return. The collapse of the American nation into civil war once more and New England's precarious position led many to abandon any notions of seeing their families and friends again. However, that no longer seems to be the case! Through strength and will, the brave men and women of the Armed Forces of the Provisional Government have fought through thick and thin to reunite their beloved country. In Boston's city hall, the flag of the Provisional Government is finally being hoisted down and replaced with the Star-Spangled Banner to the cheers of the tearful crowds watching. Across New England, ticker-tape parades and parades are found in every major city as soldiers return home to their loved ones, friends long separated have finally reunited, and sons return to their mother's tender embrace. While there is much to do in terms of reconstruction, New England celebrates for once more the heart of America's original revolution stands triumphant against tyranny!"

### CSA Flavour Events ###
 amcivwar.30.t: "Directive 10: Redistribution of Material Assets"
 amcivwar.30.d: "Now that the revolution has begun, we must decide what should be done to the bourgeoisie. The IWW proclaim we confiscate all their wealth and redistribute it to the people immediately. The up-and-coming Vanguard has called for their immediate arrest and execution as well, citing the fate of Vladimir Lenin as an example of a revolution defeated by leniency. SPA members belonging to the depreciated AFL, along with several loyal Progressives have sought life over death. Asking the Central Committee to only expropriate what is necessary for war, and keep their materialist constituents happy. "
 amcivwar.30.a: "Their wealth and their lives are ours!"
 amcivwar.30.b: "We may need these moderates in the future"

 amcivwar.31.t: "Bourgeoisie Flee to Canada"
 amcivwar.31.d: "The bourgeois have decided that they will flee the CSA. Thousands have sought refuge within enemy territory, Especially within the illegitimate Canadian government. The thieving scum have taken whatever of their stolen wealth they could carry with them as they have escaped the revolution."
 amcivwar.31.a: "The revolution will come for them, in time"

 amcivwar.32.t: "The Life of William Crawley Released in Theatres"
 amcivwar.32.d: "The revolutionary agitprop have just released the story of the life of Willaim Crawley, a humble son of Florida. Filmed on a modern sound stage, the daring rescue is portrayed by ex-Hollywood Paul Robeson. Although the real life William Crowley preferred the church choir, Paul Robeson's musical numbers were jaunty popular tunes. The film has proven to be a smashing success at the box office, beating out an adaptation of Jack London's The Iron Heel at the opening weekend. The press caught up to William Crawley, where he commented that the film is 'Quite the spectacle on our great liberation'."
 amcivwar.32.a: "Splendid"

 amcivwar.33.t: "Directive 213: War Syndicalism"
 amcivwar.33.d: "As the war stalemates and perhaps may even turn against us, the Central Committee is debating a comprehensive economic reform proposal known as 'War Syndicalism.' Some of its proposals, such as state control of all foreign trade, nationalisation of all factories, strict labour discipline are not especially controversial. It also includes potentially problematic measures such as the outlawing of wildcat strikes, obligatory labour-duty for those not working or in the military, strict food rationing, and military control over railroads. This is seen as tyrannical within the SPA with a number saying that some of the latter measures, especially the outlawing of wildcat strikes would betray the values of the revolution, and make the current government no better than its Capitalist enemies. Those supporting the proposal in the Vanguard counter that it is necessary in order to achieve victory in the revolution, and that the first laws passed after the end of the war will revert War Syndicalism."
 amcivwar.33.a: "Enact War Syndicalism"
 amcivwar.33.b: "That's not Socialism!"

 amcivwar.34.t: "The Betsy Ross Flying Corps"
 amcivwar.34.d: "Gender equality has long been a major ideological component of socialist thought, and we have yet more evidence that it works! A squadron of female pilots has earned renown throughout the CSA for their daring raids on enemy territory, their coordinated and synchronised attack formations allowing them to take down larger enemy air forces with ease. Named after the creator of the American flag by its founder Opal Kunz, the squadron has taken their new nickname up with a great deal of pride."
 amcivwar.34.a: "Death is in the air."

 amcivwar.35.t: "Female Soldiers"
 amcivwar.35.d: "As the Revolutionary struggle continues a number of women have joined the armed struggle in accordance with the socialist ideals of gender equality. While not all are accepted by their male comrades, it has not deterred many from fighting and dying for the revolution. Manuals have been distributed to recruiters on how to effectively organise Women Detachments, of which the militias can teach the military a thing or two."
 amcivwar.35.a: "Rebel Girl, you are the queen of my world!"

 amcivwar.36.t: "Internal Conflicts"
 amcivwar.36.d: "At the offset of the revolution, John Reed placed the IWW as the model and future successor to Congress. The AFL, which had seen a decline in membership before 1935, was revitalised by Reed's endorsement. Now the AFL, as a part of the coalition fighting the socialist revolution, has begun to exercise their ideological autonomy. They have chosen to occupy the entire left side of the IWW, and begun to pull in allies. Their debates with the IWW can sometimes leak out into street brawls, and, in two cases, friendly fire. The Vanguards, owing only their allegiance to the revolution, have tried to foster cooperation. Now Reed must decide whether it is more danger to continue his support for the IWW, when compromise is in sight. "
 amcivwar.36.a: "Side with the IWW"
 amcivwar.36.b: "Let the Vanguard compromise"
 amcivwar.36.c: "Side with the AFL"

 amcivwar.38.t: "Directive 764: Revolutionary Education Act"
 amcivwar.38.d: "To those who are well educated, either formally or through bitter experience, revolutionary thought comes as easily as breathing. However, many of our comrades, whether in the Steel Belt or elsewhere in America, have been lied to their entire lives by the capitalists, and do not understand how the revolution frees them. Many do not give their heart and soul to the revolution, and some even attempt to sabotage our efforts, unaware that we are the only force that truly cares for them. This must be remedied, and our comrades must be deprogrammed. Should we focus on reaching those in our territory, keeping our own morale up, or should we spread our message throughout enemy territory, and sap their will to fight their liberators?"
 amcivwar.38.a: "Focus on the socialist family"
 amcivwar.38.b: "Focus on the reactionary enemy"

 amcivwar.39.t: "Directive 984: Sentencing of Pre-War Capitalist Politicians"
 amcivwar.39.d: "As the revolution nears success, the people demand that we deal with the corrupt, capitalist politicians in office before the revolution who now rot in our cells. Some believe that by having these politicians work hard labour for a few years, they will empathise with the worker, and be converted to our cause. Others believe that no amount of education can reform them, and they must remain behind bars for the rest of their lives. A small, but vocal minority insists that they must be executed for their crimes, like the Romanovs or the Bourbon dynasties of old."
 amcivwar.39.a: "They shall be redeemed by the sweat on their brows and the ache of their backs"
 amcivwar.39.b: "They shall watch as the world leaves them behind and makes them irrelevant"
 amcivwar.39.c: "It is now our turn, and we shall not make excuses for the terror!"

 amcivwar.40.t: "Directive 1231: Establish the CIA"
 amcivwar.40.d: "It is an unfortunate fact that there are spies and saboteurs within our territory working to prevent our glorious liberation of the proletarian masses. Of the many proposals submitted to the Central Committee, one stands out. Earl Browder's proposal is to create a committee to enforce revolutionary order and stop counter-revolutionary sabotage. However, others within the Central Committee, including Chairman Reed, wonder if this is a necessary step and if we would be betraying our ideals. Regardless, a vote was taken. What was decided?"
 amcivwar.40.a: "The CIA will be created!"
 amcivwar.40.b: "It is not necessary for now"

 amcivwar.41.t: "Red Terror"
 amcivwar.41.d: "War is hell. Civil war, even more so. The psychological strain caused by having to repeatedly kill, even if the enemy are capitalists, has caused some of our soldiers and commanders to become sadistic beyond what some consider to be acceptable. Although not commonplace, reports of systematic mass executions and torture are being reported from both the front lines and core territories to suppress populations suspected of aiding the capitalist factions. Reed has made an executive decision to suppress these reports from the free media. 'If the revolution were to fail because of a few bad apples', says Reed 'then humanity would collectively suffer for centuries longer'."
 amcivwar.41.a: "Tis' the final conflict, after all"

 amcivwar.42.t: "The Final Struggle"
 amcivwar.42.d: "To no one's surprise, the arch-reactionaries in Canada have finally decided to step in to try and squash the revolution in America, in a desperate attempt to prevent us from destroying their decaying monarchy. The final struggle has thus begun, and only one victor may emerge in North America: revolution, or reaction?"
 amcivwar.42.a: "We must not waver!"

### AUS Flavour Events ###
 amcivwar.46.t: "Lindbergh appeals to Long"
 amcivwar.46.d: "Charles Lindbergh has arranged a meeting between Huey Long and a number of leading industrialists including Henry Ford, Fred Koch, and H.L. Hunt. These men are inclined to close their factories and refineries within the South to comply with orders from the Federal Government. However, they are instead persuaded by Lindbergh to stick up for Huey Long and move their business empires into the American Union State on a few conditions. They ask that Huey Long guarantee some sort of political exception to them in these dire economic times as well as a promise of political office once the war is won. If Long agrees to their demand, it will give them greater influence and many of his supporters will wonder if he plans on betraying his ideals. However, refusing in such a time may prove costly."
 amcivwar.46.a: "Agree to their reasoning"
 amcivwar.46.b: "I will not betray my ideals!"

 amcivwar.47.t: "War Powers Committee"
 amcivwar.47.d: "Business leaders within our territory have formed a committee ostensibly in support of Huey Long in order to coordinate the war effort on his behalf called the War Powers Committee. Just as Huey Long himself had created offices to handle the monumental task of fighting for America, so did the industrialists take it upon themselves to create an industrial institution. Though they do not have all the power that they were promised, they have declared themselves to be the arsenal the AUS, and are led by controversially anti-Semitic but respected general George Van Horn Moseley."
 amcivwar.47.a: "A formidable ally... for now"

### USA Flavour Events ###
 amcivwar.61.t: "Conscription"
 amcivwar.61.d: "With the war going on the question, is should we implement conscription or not. Doing so would provide us with the men we need to restore order to the country. However, it is not a popular move. Some suggest focusing on Propaganda instead."
 amcivwar.61.a: "Implement conscription"
 amcivwar.61.b: "Focus on propaganda instead"

 amcivwar.62.t: "Recall the China Marines?"
 amcivwar.62.d: "With the outbreak of the civil war, our garrison in the Legation Cities has been left sitting on their hands in China. Though recalling the division would leave our Chinese concessions relatively unguarded, and our influence in the Cities smaller, many are advising us that it must be done to win the war. Should we recall the division?"
 amcivwar.62.a: "Bring our boys home!"
 amcivwar.62.b: "We shouldn't risk it."

 amcivwar.63.t: "Emergency Stockpiles"
 amcivwar.63.d: "While the rebels scramble to arm their militias, we have opened the strategic stockpiles whose locations have been only known to the few. Even if these underground storages absolutely do not have your newest equipment, it is still thousands and thousands of kits for American infantrymen, meant for the worst day - and the worst day has arguably come."
 amcivwar.63.a: "Let's go!"

 amcivwar.64.t: "Hardship of the Civil War"
 amcivwar.64.d: "The civil war is bringing the hardship home. People within a number of loyal cities are starving. We could focus on relieving their suffering, but this will mean diverting supplies that are needed for the front to fight the civil war. Congress and the Military are at odds in this regard. What should we do?"
 amcivwar.64.a: "Relieve Civilian Suffering."
 amcivwar.64.b: "Support our Troops."

 amcivwar.65.t: "Martial Law?"
 amcivwar.65.d: "With the civil war raging a question has come about suspending habeas corpus and enforcing martial law in occupied territories. Those within our General Staff are even divided, as it could create more rebels than it defeats pre-emptively. It might allow us to keep things under control during the civil war but such a move is naturally controversial. What shall be done?"
 amcivwar.65.a: "Enforce Martial Law"
 amcivwar.65.b: "Civil order is better"

 amcivwar.66.t: "Loyalist Terror"
 amcivwar.66.d: "During the ongoing civil war, some of our commanders started to use rather doubtful methods to permanently suppress civilian populations suspected of helping our mortal enemies. When pressed, the President has defended their actions, stating 'Only discretionary violence was used, any commander capable of true brutality has already become a rebel'. "
 amcivwar.66.a: "We can only hope."

 amcivwar.67.t: "Native American Codetalkers"
 amcivwar.67.d: "A number of native American tribes have decided to support us and offer their services. Notably, this should help with hiding our communications since there are few people who speak the various languages of the native Americans."
 amcivwar.67.a: "This should help"

 amcivwar.68.t: "Conscientious Objectors"
 amcivwar.68.d: "A number of men and women, particularly among religious like the Jehovah's Witnesses and the Mormons, do not wish to engage in war, have objected to fighting in the conflict. We can try to silence them or we can offer them to work in non-military jobs to help the war effort. Public opinion seems to be divided, as super-patriots have begun to assault objectors during their demonstrations."
 amcivwar.68.a: "The public will handle them"
 amcivwar.68.b: "Make them work"

 amcivwar.69.t: "Double V Campaign"
 amcivwar.69.d: "As we are fighting the various traitors, leaders of the NAACP have begun to push for what is being called the Double V Campaign, Victory for America and Victory against Racism. Not all African-Americans wish to fight for the radical factions and thus a campaign has begun to fight for America and to help win the civil war as well as to help fight against racism within America."
 amcivwar.69.a: "Victory for America and Victory against Racism!"

 amcivwar.70.t: "Militarise the WASPs?"
 amcivwar.70.d: "Congress is debating a bill to militarise the Women Air Force Service Pilots (WASPs) in a similar fashion to the WACs and WAVES. This would require the government to provide the expenses for the WASPs similar to the other two organisations instead of having the female pilots themselves pay the expenses. It would not have them fly in combat situations, since that is still the job for the Male pilots. Despite this it is facing quite the pushback from Congress as many regard the WASPs as not as experienced as male pilots and not suited for the job. The question then is what shall congress vote to do?"
 amcivwar.70.a: "Congress votes to Militarise the WASPs"
 amcivwar.70.b: "Congress votes to not Militarise the WASPs"

 amcivwar.76.t: "Washington is Endangered"
 amcivwar.76.d: "Washington is in danger of falling to traitors and rebels, and as such we must move out of the city. Military leaders have drafted several possible cities that we could relocate to - the question is, which one shall we relocate to?"
 amcivwar.76.a: "Denver"
 amcivwar.76.b: "San Francisco"
 amcivwar.76.c: "Helena"
 amcivwar.76.e: "Phoenix"

 amcivwar.90.t.CSA: "Support from the Syndicalists"
 amcivwar.90.t.USA: "Support from the Loyalists"
 amcivwar.90.t.TEX: "Support from the Longists"
 amcivwar.90.t.PSA: "Support from the Resistance"
 amcivwar.90.d: "Rebels fighting for the [Root.GetAdjective] cause elsewhere in the United States have made contact with our government, offering an array of scavenged supplies."
 amcivwar.90.a: "It will be a great help"

 amcivwar.95.t: "Syndicalist Uprising in the West"
 amcivwar.95.d: "Fighting along the West Coast between syndicalist sympathisers and security forces has been severe in recent weeks, but dropped off within the last weeks - leading to hopes that the unions out west had finally given up hope of success. These hopes were dashed as a new uprising was revealed, with a number of militias organised by powerful Teamster and Longshoremen unions in Washington and Oregon state and armed through underground efforts. This opens up a new front in the civil war, should the rebels find a way to break out of the mountains."
 amcivwar.95.a: "Hurrah!"
 amcivwar.95.b: "More syndicalist scum?!"

 amcivwar.97.t: "Longist Rebels Rise in Kentucky"
 amcivwar.97.d: "Huey Long always held strong support in the heartland, with states like Kentucky and Indiana only barely swinging elsewhere in the 1936 election. Now, Longist supporters have risen up in Kentucky and the surrounding region, taking up arms gained through the underground to band together and open a new front in the civil war."
 amcivwar.97.a: "Hurrah!"
 amcivwar.97.b: "This will not help them in the long run"

 amcivwar.99.t: "Loyalists Rise in Pennsylvania"
 amcivwar.99.d: "Support for the federal government remains strong even in the syndicalist heartland of Pennsylvania, and this has finally been proven as bands of loyalist militia -- reportedly organised in the city of Philadelphia -- rose up in the hills in the central part of the state, claiming the region once more for federal control. Whether they will achieve that goal and open up a new front in the civil war remains to be seen."
 amcivwar.99.a: "Hurrah!"
 amcivwar.99.b: "A futile effort"

 amcivwar.101.t: "Resistance Rises in Midwest"
 amcivwar.101.d: "Support for the democratic proponents in the Pacific government has been strong in the American Midwest, with several protests on the streets frequent - many of whom appear to be placing blame for the civil war squarely on the shoulders of General MacArthur. These protests have recently become more organised, and have culminated in a widespread uprising across Colorado, quietly funded and equipped through underground means. Whether these rebels will succeed in opening up a new front for the civil war remains to be seen."
 amcivwar.101.a: "Hurrah!"
 amcivwar.101.b: "A nuisance at best"

 amcivwar.103.t: "Syndicalist Uprising in Georgia"
 amcivwar.103.d: "It seems there are more than a few disaffected supporters of Huey Long who are angry enough that they've defected to the CSA's control. Over the last number of weeks, they've been organising in the hills of southern Georgia, and now they've finally made their move. This opens up a new front in the civil war."
 amcivwar.103.a: "Hurrah!"
 amcivwar.103.b: "They should make up their minds"

 amcivwar.105.t: "Longist Uprising in California"
 amcivwar.105.d: "It seems there are more than a few disaffected SPA militia members who are angry enough that they've defected to the AUS's control. Over the last number of weeks, they've been organising in the hills of southern California, and now they've finally made their move. This opens up a new front in the civil war."
 amcivwar.105.a: "Hurrah!"
 amcivwar.105.b: "It makes no difference"

### Foreign Interventions ###
 amcivwar.150.t: "America in Chaos"
 amcivwar.150.d: "Chaos has overtaken our neighbours to the south, and - even worse - the Socialist Party of America has proclaimed a stronghold right off our southern border. A number of the northeastern governors in New England, their states beset by syndicalist militia violence, have formally asked the Canadian government to intervene. Clearly they feel the Federal government is incapable of the task, though some of our ministers feel this might be seen by some of the factions less as intervention and more as aggression. They say the matter should be debated in Parliament before any action is taken. For New England, at least, that might not be quick enough to save them."
 amcivwar.150.d.nocsa: "Chaos has overtaken our neighbours to the south, though it seems as if we are spared the possibility of an American syndicalist uprising. Even so, the violence has been extreme and several governors of American states from the northeast in New England have asked us to intervene and restore order. Clearly they feel the Federal government is incapable of the task, though some of our ministers feel this might be seen by the Federal government less as intervention and more as aggression. They say the matter should be debated in Parliament before any action is taken."
 amcivwar.150.a: "Hold off on any intervention"
 amcivwar.150.b: "Move into New England, as requested"

 amcivwar.151.t: "Alaska Requests Intervention"
 amcivwar.151.d: "The American territory of Alaska has experienced a severe shortage of needed supplies following the outbreak of the civil war. After a recent bombing in the city of Juneau, the Alaska governor is fearing a breakdown of order - one that the far-off Federal government will be too busy to respond to. Thus he, like the New England governors, has requested that the Canadian government intervene for the interim to keep the peace."
 amcivwar.151.a: "Alaska is on its own"
 amcivwar.151.b: "We should move in"

 amcivwar.152.t: "[CAN.GetNameDefCap] Seizes Alaska"
 amcivwar.152.d: "The territory of Alaska has experienced a severe shortage of needed supplies following the outbreak of the civil war. After a recent bombing in the city of Juneau, the Alaska governor feared a breakdown of order - one that the far-off Federal government will be too busy to respond to - and thus made a formal request to [CAN.GetNameDef] that they intervene. Canadian troops and supply trucks have already moved into the region."
 amcivwar.152.a: "We will deal with this later"

 amcivwar.156.t: "The Fate of America"
 amcivwar.156.d: "With the civil war over, we find ourselves left to figure out what we're to do with the American territory now under our control."
 amcivwar.156.a: "Return it to [USA.GetNameDef]"
 amcivwar.156.b: "Return it to [PSA.GetNameDef]"
 amcivwar.156.c: "Return it to [TEX.GetNameDef]"
 amcivwar.156.e: "Return it to [NEE.GetNameDef]"
 amcivwar.156.f: "Set up a new American government"
 amcivwar.156.g: "Continue with the military occupation"

 amcivwar.157.t: "American Land Returned"
 amcivwar.157.d.supported: "[From.GetNameDefCap], true to their pledge of supporting us through the civil war, has returned much of their occupied American territory to us."
 amcivwar.157.d.notsupported: "[From.GetNameDefCap] occupied a fair amount of American territory during the civil war. Now their government has approached us, returning much of it to its 'rightful owner', no questions asked."
 amcivwar.157.a: "We appreciate it."

 # uses amcivwar.157.t / .a
 amcivwar.158.d: "Our Canadian allies, true to their word, have turned over almost all their occupied American territory to us."

 amcivwar.159.t: "A New American Government"
 amcivwar.159.d: "With the former governments in tatters, we will need to establish something from the old. What form shall the new government take?"
 amcivwar.159.a: "The United States of America, as is proper"
 amcivwar.159.b: "The Pacific States of America"
 amcivwar.159.c: "The American Union State"
 amcivwar.159.e: "New England"

 amcivwar.160.t: "The Fate of New England"
 amcivwar.160.d: "We are currently occupying New England. Should we return it to [america_country.GetNameDef] or continue our occupation?"
 amcivwar.160.a: "Return it to them"
 amcivwar.160.b: "We deserve it, after all we did"

 amcivwar.161.t: "The Fate of Alaska"
 amcivwar.161.d: "We are currently occupying Alaska. Should we return it to [america_country.GetNameDef] or continue our occupation?"

 amcivwar.162.t: "Elections for [america_country.GetNameDef]?"
 amcivwar.162.d: "It's been over a year since the new government was established in [america_country.GetNameDef], and our allies there say they are ready to stand on their own feet again. Shall we allow them to hold elections and continue on as free allies?"
 amcivwar.162.a: "Of course"
 amcivwar.162.b: "They're not ready"

 amcivwar.163.t: "Peace with Canada?"
 amcivwar.163.d: "We have occupied Ottawa, and currently have the Canadians on the run. Perhaps the time has come to make peace, lest we find ourselves dragged down in their expansive territory."
 amcivwar.163.a: "We intend to teach them a lesson"
 amcivwar.163.b: "Very well, let's end this"
 amcivwar.163.c: "Only if they give us land concessions"

 amcivwar.164.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Asks for Peace"
 amcivwar.164.d: "We have received an envoy from the [From.GetAdjective] government, saying they have occupied enough of Canada and hope we have learned an abject lesson. They're willing to consider peace, though warn us severely that next time they will not be so lenient."
 amcivwar.164.a: "Yes, let's end this"
 amcivwar.164.b: "No, we can still win!"

 amcivwar.165.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Asks for Peace"
 amcivwar.165.d: "The Canadian government, having been beaten soundly by [From.From.GetNameDef], wishes to pull out completely from its involvement in the civil war, and thus has asked for peace with [Root.GetNameDef]."
 amcivwar.165.a: "Yes, let's end this"
 amcivwar.165.b: "We intend to teach them a lesson"

 amcivwar.166.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap]'s Proposal"
 amcivwar.166.d: "We are currently in a ceasefire with [CSA.GetNameDef], but none of us are under the illusion that this is anything more than a respite before the fighting resumes. The [From.GetAdjective] government has approached us with a proposal: if we join the Entente, they'll fight on our side when the battle resumes. It makes sense, considering that the Canadians fear [CSA.GetNameDef] as much as we do, but some in our government oppose the idea of leashing ourselves to the Entente cause. We will, after all, be locked into their wars in Europe even should we win the civil war now."
 amcivwar.166.a: "We need their help to win the war"
 amcivwar.166.b: "No, we will do this without their help"

 amcivwar.167.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Joins the Entente"
 amcivwar.167.d: "Grateful for our assistance, the [From.GetAdjective] government has chosen to accept our offer and has formally joined the Entente."
 amcivwar.167.a: "Three Cheers for America!"

 amcivwar.168.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Rejects our Offer"
 amcivwar.168.d: "The [From.GetAdjective] government has rejected our alliance offer, perhaps believing that they can win the civil war on their own."
 amcivwar.168.a: "How disappointing!"

 amcivwar.169.t: "[PSA.GetNameDefCap] Joins the Entente"
 amcivwar.169.d: "Obviously fearing our ultimate victory, the [PSA.GetAdjective] government has cosied up to the Canadians and the British. We will need to fight them all, once the ceasefire is done."
 amcivwar.169.a: "So be it!"

### Rocky Mountain Ceasefire ###
 amcivwar.200.t: "A Possible Ceasefire"
 amcivwar.200.d: "The civil war has ravaged America, and there is a growing discussion within the government regarding approaching [PSA.GetNameDef] for a possible ceasefire. Whether the Pacific rebels would even consider such a thing is unknown, but if it occurred it would give us time to consolidate our hold over the east and for our men to recover. Eventually a reckoning would be necessary, of course, but if we don't attempt this now the war may drag on even longer as a result."
 amcivwar.200.a: "Let's meet them in Denver"
 amcivwar.200.b: "No, there's no point in this"

 amcivwar.201.t: "Ceasefire Talks in Denver"
 amcivwar.201.d: "With the war between [survivor.GetNameDef] and [PSA.GetNameDef] dragging on, talks have been held between highly-placed officials on both sides regarding a possible ceasefire. This comes at the urging of the [survivor.GetAdjective] government, though it's unknown just how much traction there currently is. We shall see within a couple of days whether anything comes of it."
 amcivwar.201.a: "An interesting idea?"
 amcivwar.201.b: "We will not negotiate with those who would see America destroyed!"

 amcivwar.202.t: "The Proposal"
 amcivwar.202.d: "After two days of talks, army officials have put together a proposal: any states west of the Mississippi River which are currently occupied by [PSA.GetAdjective] forces would be ceded to [PSA.GetNameDef], with some gaps filled in on the map - though nothing they can't properly supply. The rest would be ceded to [survivor.GetNameDef]. Outside of that, there are no guarantees and no talk of actual peace... eventually there will be a reckoning. Both sides simply call for hostilities to stop for now, for damage to be assessed, and for the living to take a much-needed breath."
 amcivwar.202.a: "This will do."
 amcivwar.202.b: "They're asking for too much!"
 ACW_agree_proposal: "Agree to the proposal as it stands"
 ACW_we_will_try_again: "We will go back to the table and try again..."

 amcivwar.203.t: "There Will be no Ceasefire"
 amcivwar.203.d: "Perhaps it was too much to hope for. Talks between both sides in Denver fell apart without any real agreement, and any hopes for a ceasefire have vanished. The war resumes."
 amcivwar.203.a: "So much for that"

 amcivwar.204.t: "The [ACW_ceasefire_name]"
 amcivwar.204.d: "Talks with [PSA.GetNameDef] have concluded, and the ceasefire is going ahead. Already our troops are pulling back to the eastern side of the new border. How long this will last remains to be seen."
 amcivwar.204.a: "It's peace for now"

 amcivwar.205.t: "The [ACW_ceasefire_name]"
 amcivwar.205.d: "Talks with [From.GetNameDef] have concluded, and the ceasefire is going ahead. Already our troops are pulling back to the western side of the new border. How long this will last remains to be seen."
 amcivwar.205.a: "It's peace for now"

 amcivwar.206.t: "The [ACW_ceasefire_name]"
 amcivwar.206.d: "Civil war has ravaged America for many months, but today a ceasefire was called in the conflict after a meeting in Denver between officials of [PSA.GetNameDef] and [survivor.GetNameDef] worked out terms. Pacific forces would withdraw to new boundaries west of the agreed-upon border, while [survivor.GetAdjective] forces would withdraw eastward. This is not an official peace, however, and many feel that a future reckoning between the two countries - a final showdown, as it were, for the future destiny of America - is all but inevitable.\n\nEven so, this is a moment of respite for each side to gather their strength and count their dead, and Americans on both sides are celebrating a bit of peace snatched from the jaws of chaos."
 amcivwar.206.a: "We'll see how long it lasts"

### Liberia and Philippines in Chaos ###
 amcivwar.212.t: "America in Chaos"
 amcivwar.212.d: "Liberia has been under the economic and effective political dominance of the USA since its foundation as a colony for freed slaves in 1822. This dominance has also helped to protect her from European colonial powers. However, now the USA is in chaos, as rival political factions make a bid for the Presidency. The conflict has now deepened to the point of war. No longer can they be relied upon for protection. Now we must decide how we are to survive."
 amcivwar.212.a: "Lapdogs no longer - we can protect ourselves!"
 amcivwar.212.b: "We aren't traitors - stay loyal to the Americans"

 amcivwar.226.t: "Independence in the Philippines"
 amcivwar.226.d: "The civil war in America has left the American hold over the Philippines weakened. The people of the Philippines are demanding full independence but some in the government are worried that an independent Philippines will be absorbed by the greater powers in the area."
 amcivwar.226.a: "Freedom. Horrible, horrible freedom"

 amcivwar.227.t: "Seizing American Equipment"
 amcivwar.227.d: "With the Americans heading off the island, they have left large amounts of equipment in the Philippines. The Filipino army is advocating seizing the resources while they are unguarded but the government is afraid of what this might do to the relations between the two countries."
 amcivwar.227.a: "Seize the equipment"
 amcivwar.227.b: "We should stay friendly"

 amcivwar.229.t: "The Philippine Commonwealth"
 amcivwar.229.d: "The Americans had never promised the Filipino people independence and forces inside the country wanted to use the American Civil War as an opportunity to declare independence and form a legitimate government. The Commonwealth of the Philippines was created to administer the nation and transition into a full state of independence."
 amcivwar.229.a: "Our glorious new commonwealth"

### Pre-War Events ###
 amcivwar.300.t: "Riots in New England and New York"
 amcivwar.300.d: "In recent days, syndicalist militias have been struggling (and failing) to take control in northeastern states, from New York and New Jersey all the way up to the coasts of Maine. So far, governors in the region have clamped down hard on the violence, though the result has been a series of violent riots in Boston and Buffalo - not to mention a wave of uprisings still ongoing within New York City itself. Citizens are on edge, and governors have denied the federal government permission to raise local militias in the area, fearful of increasing tensions further. A few New England governors are reported to be quietly asking the Canadian government to intervene, should worse come to worst."

Several groups of SPA militia are suggesting they rise up along with the AUS, united or not, and are attempting to seize control of the area. So far, governors in the region have clamped down hard on the violence, though the result has been a series of riots in Boston and Buffalo - not to mention a wave of uprisings still ongoing within New York City itself. Citizens are on edge, and governors have denied the federal government permission to raise local militias in the area, fearful of increasing tensions further. A few New England governors are reported to be quietly asking the Canadian government to intervene, should worse come to worst."
 amcivwar.300.d.peace: "While Jack Reed and the SPA have been trying to rein in their militias across the north, not all are in agreement that the compromise bill went far enough. Indeed, several more radical unions are still calling for strikes, and the northeastern states - from New Jersey all the way up to the coast of Maine - have been particularly hard-hit by militia violence.

 amcivwar.310.d: "Maurice J. Sullivan today declared Nevada's allegiance with the Pacific States who refuse to acknowledge the legitimacy of General MacArthur's government. The governor had been in consultation with the Pacific government since its creation, and in a radio address said he could not stand by and let democracy fail in America without taking a stand. So far, federal forces have withdrawn from army bases in the region without threat of further violence."

 amcivwar.311.d: "The 30-day deadline by the federal government to the rebellious states has, so far, gone without any of the state governors changing their minds. The federal government is consolidating its position, but has warned MacArthur to expect further violence and state defections prior to the deadline's end. Most in Washington appear pessimistic that an all-out war can be avoided."

 amcivwar.312.t: "Deadline Looms"
 amcivwar.312.d: "The 30-day deadline issued by the federal government is almost at an end, with none of the sides having stood down.

This has led to the Navy's effective dissolution - dozens of vessels have deserted or defected, numerous sailors, naval officers and even admirals have changed sides.

Having secured the old Minnesota Farmer-Labor Party's bastion, many Farmer-Labor members and leaders have now sworn allegiance to the Socialist cause.

Before the violence could spread further, however, the governor of Minnesota declared the state's allegiance to the country proper and rededicated the state's loyal national guard to fighting back the insurgents. While the struggle continues, for the moment the state remains in Federal hands. A similar uprising in Iowa has likewise failed - with the former Farmer-Labor Party hotbed tamed by the Federalists, Iowa's socialists are unlikely to make much progress."

While most doubt that Governor Kraschel has any syndicalist sympathies, it's clear he foresaw a quick collapse of the state once the war began and elected to switch sides before things went too far.

With the fall of Missouri intensifying pressure on the state, it was only a matter of time before Frankfort and Louisville were overrun by SPA forces attacking from all sides. Governor Happy Chandler evacuated the state just before the fall of Frankfort, leaving the remaining defenders leaderless and thus easily overwhelmed by attacking forces. While the SPA now controls most of the state, its hold is yet far from secure, however, with regular clashes breaking out between militia groups and Federal forces near the border with Tennessee."

In Kentucky, the legislature in Frankfurt has once again grown bitterly divided as the state grapples with fear of Syndicalism and the allure of Huey Long's proclamation. In an impassioned plea, Governor Happy Chandler has decidedly cast his lot with the Federalist cause, despite himself being a stalwart part of the Democrats' Conservative wing. Although the speech has gained considerable attention in a region tearing itself apart at the seams, ultimately Governor Chandler's forces were forced to flee the capital towards Loyalist lines - yielding much of the state to pro-Long government. Chandler however has vowed to rally pro-governmental forces and return to liberate the state from treason."

Richmond was overtaken soon afterwards, with Governor George C. Peery taken hostage. While the governor held out for several days, hoping that federal forces would free him in the legislature, it quickly became evident that Virginia's Minutemen forces were too well-entrenched. To avoid further bloodshed, Governor Peery ordered the state's national guard to stand down and naval forces to withdraw from the base in Norfolk.

### MacArthur's War ###
 amcivwar.700.t: "MacArthur's War Plan"
 amcivwar.700.d: "General MacArthur has long been preparing his plans for combatting civil unrest. The original War Plan White from the early '20s insisted on respecting the Constitution's provisions on states' rights. It said that only the governor could request federal troops to suppress a revolt. The situation in the nation now, unfortunately, requires stronger action. With President MacArthur's 30-day amnesty deadline yielding few results, it seems the United States needs to prepare for war.\n\nThere are three plans that have been proposed to the cabinet and chiefs of the military:\n\n1. War Plan White: Yorktown recommends abandoning the many military bases on the West Coast, in the Rockies, the Great Plains and the Midwest. With the withdrawal of Federal troops east of the Mississippi, the plan hopes the concentration of Federal troops on the eastern seaboard will be able to crush rebellions in Pennsylvania, the Carolinas, New England, and Georgia.\n\n2. War Plan White: San Jacinto calls for relocating the government to the Great Plains, along with much of the military, in order to crush resistance in the Pacific states. If properly executed, this would allow us to recapture the mutineering Pacific fleet.\n\n3. Lastly, MacArthur's original War Plan White, drafted late last year, calls for holding a corridor from Virginia to whichever states remain loyal in the Midwest. We hope that our superior organisation and mobility can quickly crush the rebellions before they can link up or begin war production. What should we choose?"
 amcivwar.700.a: "Abandon the Plains."
 amcivwar.700.b: "Washington is too vulnerable, retreat to Denver."
 amcivwar.700.c: "We will not cede an inch more to those traitors!"

 amcivwar.701.t: "Evacuation of the Rocky Mountains"
 amcivwar.701.d: "The states of Arizona, New Mexico, Idaho, and Utah have long been thought of as America's true heartland, a place where invaders would rarely reach. As such, there were few military bases or commands in the area, and few depots or bases to evacuate. In Nevada, unfortunately, Hawthorne Army Depot has refused orders to move materiel east. However, the states of New Mexico and Arizona were different. Here, Forts Yuma and Huachaca, built in the last century to protect against Indian raids and Mexican bandits, remained strong. Happily, they also remained loyal, and the soldiers and men there are trucking north and east as quickly as they can. The citizens of these states are cautiously obeying the instructions of the governors to remain where they are until a regional decision is made."
 amcivwar.701.a: "Perhaps the Navajo will come out again, now the Feds are gone."

 amcivwar.702.t: "Evacuation of the Northern Great Plains"
 amcivwar.702.d: "Like the rest of the old West, the only military bases in the north of the Great Plains were established during the last Indian Wars to finally pacify the region. Fort Russel in Wyoming, Fort Missoula in Montana, and Camp Grafton in North Dakota are now fairly badly-equipped bases, having not fought a battle or skirmish since the 1880s. The lack of hostile civilian activity has made the evacuation relatively smooth, and the troops have withdrawn south to Colorado and Missouri."
 amcivwar.702.a: "Let the Canadians watch the border, we're going east."

 amcivwar.703.t: "The Withdrawal from Denver"
 amcivwar.703.d: "The central Plains, Denver in particular, have become a rallying point for troops and militiamen in the Plains and west, coming together to organise, train, and fight the rebellions. As the President has decided to abandon the Plains until he can take Chicago and Baton Rouge, these troops have been sent out of Denver east to Missouri, to meet the loyalist militias already converging on St Louis. The governor of Colorado has begged our troops to stay and protect his state from the radical rebels, but they had their orders. The west has been left for dead."
 amcivwar.703.a: "Blow the retreat."

 amcivwar.704.t: "Crossing the Mississippi"
 amcivwar.704.d: "As our troops arrived in Missouri, trouble finally began to hit our servicemen. Governor Stark of Missouri, a Pendergast machine politician, is an admirer of Governor Long and an ally of the AFP. He refused to allow our men to cross the Mississippi without checking each unit's papers by Washington by telegram. Our men seem to have gotten slightly fed up with this, and stormed across the bridge in Cairo to Kentucky. Unfortunately, the bridge could only take so many people, and the bridge soon collapsed, leaving thousands of men stranded on the far side. Ferries were soon organised to bring them over, but the first shots of opposition to the army were seen as the last of our men left St Louis as AFP militiamen shot at our retreating troops."
 amcivwar.704.a: "Flee, flee for your lives!"

 amcivwar.705.t: "Western Governors Defect to the PSA"
 amcivwar.705.d: "When Federal troops withdrew from the area of the Rocky Mountains, there were initially split responses. The Governor of Nevada, Richard Kirman, Sr., refused to allow Federal troops to evacuate or abandon their equipment, but the governors of Arizona, Idaho and Utah were more willing to accommodate the President. However, a recent regional conference of the four governors in Salt Lake City has led to them deciding to collectively rely on the provisional government in California for protection and support. Apparently, most of them were led to this by their clear abandonment by the Washington government. They have denounced MacArthur's takeover pro forma and the Sacramento government has already sent in its own soldiers and airmen to occupy the abandoned bases in the west."
 amcivwar.705.a: "The true America grows stronger!"
 amcivwar.705.b: "Pragmatic traitors are still traitors."

 amcivwar.706.t: "New Mexico Falls to Huey Long's Government"
 amcivwar.706.d: "As Federal soldiers and marines left Arizona and New Mexico, they took most militiamen and National Guardsmen with them, promising to return them to their homes by way of Baton Rouge by the end of the year. Unfortunately for MacArthur's government, stripping New Mexico of defenders left it open to takeovers from nearby. Steaming up the Pecos and racing along the roads to Albuquerque and Santa Fe, Huey Long's loyal Minutemen and National Guard captured the greater part of New Mexico before the police knew what was happening. Soon, Progressive governor Tingley surrendered the state via radio before fleeing west to the PSA, taking most of the administration of the state with him."
 amcivwar.706.a: "Thank you, Texans!"
 amcivwar.706.b: "The nation spirals further into chaos."

 amcivwar.707.t: "Socialist Forces Capture Minnesota"
 amcivwar.707.d: "As Federal forces left Minnesota, Floyd Olson's old friend Governor Peterson realised that his state would be torn apart unless he surrendered to Jack Reed's Chicago regime. While there was some protest, the fact that the state had been close to voting Reed in the ‘36 election helped sway the people of Minnesota to follow their governor into the arms of the socialists."
 amcivwar.707.a: "It was inevitable."
 amcivwar.707.b: "Damn them!"

 amcivwar.708.t: "Iowa Surrenders"
 amcivwar.708.d: "Striking workers in Des Moines and Ceder Rapids today were joined by newly arrived militia of Reed's now openly declared CSA. Police officers attempting to defend the Iowa State Capitol were massacred by the mob as the seat of legislature was invaded by the workers. Governor Kraschel, probably seeing which way the tide was flowing, has decided to surrender his state to the Chicago government as a new state of the CSA."
 amcivwar.708.a: "The revolution must be brought by force sometimes."
 amcivwar.708.b: "Awful!"

 amcivwar.709.t: "The Occupation of the Northern Rocky Mountains"
 amcivwar.709.d: "Soldiers and militiamen of the Western Provisional Government have finally made it over the Rocky Mountains through some small opposition, and today Cheyenne and Helena both fell to the Sacramento government. Views of the occupation are mixed in Wyoming and Montana, and many people from the cities have fled to their friends or relations out in the country. Still, there are enough new recruits from the northern Rockies to replenish the Californian divisions, which are now racing towards Dakota in an effort to capture Bismarck before the CSA can."
 amcivwar.709.a: "We'll be in Bismarck soon enough!"
 amcivwar.709.b: "Let them have the rocks, if they want them."

 amcivwar.710.t.CSA: "The Capture of North and South Dakota"
 amcivwar.710.t.PSA: "The Battle of Bismarck"
 amcivwar.710.d.CSA: "While western militias had hoped to continue their race towards the Midwest and the Great Lakes, it seems the militia and soldiers of the Combined Syndicates have finally organised themselves enough to methodically encircle both Pierre and Bismarck and force both cities to surrender. Californian forces have been beaten back from Highway 5 on the border between South Dakota and Wyoming, and it seems the race to capture the west is over. Now there will be harder struggles between the socialists and the provisional government."
 amcivwar.710.d.PSA: "While General Butler has now assumed enough control within the CSA to organise a true campaign into North and South Dakota, western troops arrived in Bismarck quickly enough to prevent full encirclement. Independent North Dakota governor William Langer, formerly aligned with Governor Long, supported the western troops in their fight to expel socialist soldiers from the state. This coalition was powerful enough to halt General Butler's western offensive for now."
 amcivwar.710.a: "Well done, boys!"
 amcivwar.710.b: "We'll be back soon enough!"
 amcivwar.710.c: "A battle worth fighting."
 amcivwar.710.d: "We'll be back!"
 amcivwar.710.e: "Disturbing news."

 amcivwar.711.t.PSA: "The Denver Resolution for Democracy"
 amcivwar.711.t.TEX: "The Denver Conference Resolves for Long"
 amcivwar.711.d.PSA: "Following the withdrawal of Federal troops from the lower Plains, Republican Governor Carr of Colorado called for a meeting of the Governors of Kansas, Colorado and Nebraska in Denver. While the governors of Colorado and Nebraska were from establishment parties, Governor Ketchum of Kansas was an AFP member. This allowed for greater flexibility in choosing their side in the national conflict that is rapidly sinking into war. Ultimately, after a tense few days, the governors decided that the only side truly interested in preserving the Constitution was the Pacific provisional government, and their three states have invited in Pacifican troops to keep the peace."

 amcivwar.712.t: "The Battle of Eads Bridge"
 amcivwar.712.d.CSA: "Although Federal troops left Missouri some days ago, Governor Stark had not yet declared for any rival government. In an attempt to gain the most favourable position in the Midwest possible, General Butler has dispatched militias to seize St Louis across the Missouri from Illinois. They encountered Governor Stark's National Guard at Eads Bridge on the border, and skirmishes ensued, as militias on both sides attempted to cross the river around the bridges without success. Finally, the socialist militia managed to break through the defences around the bridges and break into striking St Louis, where a 'people's government' was set up. Governor Stark has fled south to Baton Rouge, but Missouri is in the hands of the SPA."

They encountered Governor Stark's National Guard at Eads Bridge on the border, and skirmishes ensued, as militias on both sides attempted to cross the river around the bridges without success. Finally, a rogue group of Illinois Minutemen came up from the north and began attacking the CSA forces from behind, which allowed Governor Stark's National Guard to push forward and force the CSA militia to surrender. Governor Stark has now declared Huey Long legitimate President, and Union forces have entered the state to guard the borders."
 amcivwar.712.a: "The revolution grows stronger!"
 amcivwar.712.b: "Damn the traitors!"
 amcivwar.712.c: "The river held them."

 amcivwar.712.e: "Damn them!"

 amcivwar.713.t: "Reinforcements Arrive in the East"
 amcivwar.713.d: "Although the west may have been snatched up by rebels even more quickly than MacArthur thought, the east is now more securable, with tens of thousands of Federal troops having arrived in Virginia, along with even more volunteers from the West rushing to enlist in the army out East. Our army is growing stronger."
 amcivwar.713.a: "Patriots, to arms!"

 amcivwar.714.t.USA: "Federalist Victory in Tennessee"
 amcivwar.714.t.TEX: "Longist victory in Tennessee"
 amcivwar.714.d.USA: "Today, at 8:45 am, Longist militias assaulted Federal defences in Nashville, but they were no match for a professional, organised army. Federal forces were able to repel them with ease, and begin hunting down local partisans in the state. With this victory, MacArthur's control of Tennessee is undisputed for now."
 amcivwar.714.d.TEX: "Today, at 8:45 am, Longist militias assaulted Federal defences in Nashville while they were still reorganising from their retreat east. Disorganised National Guardsmen and the few Army units present were quickly surrounded and forced to surrender, and soon the city of Nashville had surrendered to President Long's forces. Across the state, local Minutemen and Longist sympathisers secured the countryside and most towns, and most agree Huey Long's control of Tennessee is undisputed."
 amcivwar.714.a: "Easier than expected."
 amcivwar.714.b: "How did that happen?"
 amcivwar.714.c: "That shows the incompetence of those corrupt feds."

 amcivwar.715.t.CSA: "Federalists Routed in Kentucky"
 amcivwar.715.t.TEX: "Federalists Routed in Kentucky"
 amcivwar.715.d.CSA: "After losing Tennessee, Kentucky became indefensible for Federal forces. Thus, General MacArthur has decided to retreat eastwards and to abandon the state, hoping to retake it as soon as possible. For now, Congress can only watch while Longist and Syndicalist militias covered the streets of Louisville and Frankfort in blood, a bloodbath that soon turned towards the Syndicalists. Their militia managed to surround Frankfort after the fall of Louisville, and soon captured the rest of the state."
 amcivwar.715.d.TEX: "After losing Tennessee, Kentucky became indefensible for Federal forces. Thus, General MacArthur has decided to retreat eastwards and to abandon the state, hoping to retake it as soon as possible. For now, though, it seems Long's forces have expelled the Syndicalist militias and soldiers from Kentucky, after some brief fighting at Louisville ended with the destruction of the bridges over the Ohio and the rout of Reed's militia."

 amcivwar.715.f: "Disturbing."

 amcivwar.716.t.USA: "Longist Forces Repelled from North Carolina"
 amcivwar.716.d.USA: "With most of the Longist forces advancing in the west, holding North Carolina wasn't difficult at all. Federalist forces repelled easily the few Longist militias that assaulted Charlotte, and it may be assumed that there probably are few Longist defences in South Carolina as well."
 amcivwar.716.t.TEX: "North Carolina Falls to Baton Rouge Government"
 amcivwar.716.d.TEX: "Although many Longist resources had been diverted west, the Baton Rouge government still clearly had enough militia to surround the city of Charlotte in North Carolina, and, after brief street fighting, capture it. Throughout the state, North Carolinean militia obeyed the order of their new puppet governor to surrender to Huey Long's forces."
 amcivwar.716.a: "Not unexpected."

 amcivwar.717.t.USA: "The Capture of Charleston"
 amcivwar.717.t.TEX: "Federalist Infiltration Beaten Off in South Carolina"
 amcivwar.717.d.USA: "Correctly assuming that Longist troops were still disorganised and unable to beat off a determined assault, USMC troops redeployed from Arizona have executed a successful naval assault on Charleston in partnership with local militia. President Long's National Guard in the city were confused by contradictory reports and soon overwhelmed, eventually surrendering after a brief fight. President MacArthur's move is being cheered in Washington as a move of military genius, while reports from Sacramento and Baton Rouge have declared the move an open attack on the people of the United States."
 amcivwar.717.d.TEX: "Incorrectly assuming that Longist troops were still too disorganised to defend Charleston, General MacArthur launched a combined naval and partisan assault on Charleston. Unfortunately, USMC landing craft were blown off course in their makeshift boats before being shelled by Longist cruisers in the Charleston harbour, while partisans around the city were suppressed and forced back into hiding without fresh supplies. South Carolina is now even more firmly in the hands of Huey Long's government."

 amcivwar.718.t: "The Siege of New York City"
 amcivwar.718.d: "It seems foreign agitators were already active in America, as French and British provocateurs and agents have incited New York City's poorer boroughs to revolution. Many businessmen that could not escape have been lynched, but the mob violence has been quieted by the arrival of trained organisers, both civilian and military, from Britain and France. The National Guard has surrounded the city in a loose siege stretching from Newark to Yonkers, preventing socialist militia from entering or leaving the city, but not yet attempting an assault on Manhattan."
 amcivwar.718.a: "Keep the port open!"
 amcivwar.718.b: "We can wait."

 amcivwar.719.t.CSA: "The Battle of Philadelphia"
 amcivwar.719.d.USA: "General MacArthur knew, like Lee and Howe before him, that Philadelphia was the key to the Mid-Atlantic. Components of the 3rd Infantry entered Pennsylvania early this week by way of West Chester, and in coordination with other regiments assembled in Camden and National Guardsmen assembled at Havertown began an assault on downtown Philadelphia, successfully making their way across both the Schuylkill and Delaware Rivers in an attempt to capture the Federal Courthouse and Frankford Arsenal before local street resistance could assemble to stop them. The operation was remarkably successful, but a socialist counterattack was soon felt once the Federal troops managed to capture the city and advance along the Ship-to-Shore highway northwest. A pitched battle began between the forces of General Butler, based in Allentown, and General Bowley in Philadelphia near Lansdale. Attempts were made to clear the area of civilians, but soon thousands were dead after artillery strikes began, and it became evident the reconquest of Pennsylvania was not going to be easy.\n\nAll across the splintered and fractured nation, the splinter factions have seen their chance to begin offensive operations against all competing governments, and from Minnesota to North Carolina, from New York City to New Mexico, skirmishes and civil unrest have at last escalated to battles. It is clear to all that the Second American Civil War has begun."

Components of the 3rd Infantry entered Pennsylvania early this week by way of West Chester, and in coordination with other regiments assembled in Camden and National Guardsmen assembled at Havertown began an assault on downtown Philadelphia. Union members prepared major east-west streets, with fallback lines reaching all the way back to Broad Street, cut the bridges over the Delaware and Schuylkill, and telephoned General Butler's forces in Allentown to coordinate counterattacks. While the initial Federal assault rolled down the Main Line with little friction, Federal attempts to cross the river near the Market Street bridge were greatly disrupted by syndicalist local activity, and soon General Butler's long-range guns, evacuated from the Frankford Arsenal the week before, were causing havoc in Federal supply lines. An exasperated President MacArthur eliminated all restrictions on his troops in the region, and the fighting became increasingly messy. Nevertheless, the Federal forces were mostly pushed back over the border to Maryland.\n\nAll across the splintered and fractured nation, the splinter factions have seen their chance to begin offensive operations against all competing governments, and from Minnesota to North Carolina, from New York City to New Mexico, skirmishes and civil unrest have at last escalated to battles.

 amcivwar.720.t: "General MacArthur Mobilises Against New England"
 amcivwar.720.d: "Although the British Crown had previously refused intervention in America, the governors of Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New York and Connecticut have renewed their request for protection following an ultimatum by President MacArthur to the New Englander governors to allow Federalist troops to enter their states to fight the syndicalist rebels in the north. While aiding the Federal government was our original plan, it is possible that MacArthur's government is not as stable as we thought. Should we issue a counter-ultimatum?"

 amcivwar.721.t: "Canada Seizes New England"
 amcivwar.721.d: "Concerning news from the northern front! Canada seized and occupied New England while Federalist forces were still reorganising after their retreat eastwards. This isn't a surprising move considering that the New England governors asked Canada to do so, but without New England, the Federalist position is greatly weakened."

 amcivwar.722.t: "The Newark Rout"
 amcivwar.722.d: "After the loss of New England, Federalist forces have been repelled from New Jersey too. Syndicalist rebels from New York broke the siege and overrun General MacArthur's forces in Newark, and received General Smedley Butler's reinforcements from Pennsylvania, who then proceeded to occupy the eastern half of that state. However, General MacArthur had sent reinforcements to New Jersey as well, and as they attempted to cross the Delaware they ran into heavy socialist resistance in Camden. Quickly taking up positions under the command of a Lieutenant Daniel Daly, the two sides began a large-scale firefight, and as more reinforcements entered the area, a small border conflict has finally bloomed into a full blown battle.\n\nAll across the splintered and fractured nation, the splinter factions have seen their chance to begin offensive operations against all competing governments, and from Minnesota to North Carolina, from New York City to New Mexico, skirmishes and civil unrest have at last escalated to battles.

Without Canadian protection, the governors asked General MacArthur for protection from the syndicalist forces. While the states may not be entirely behind MacArthur, they are at least resolved to see him as their best chance for avoiding war."

 amcivwar.724.d.macarthur: "Although President MacArthur's troops have compelled the obedience and loyalty of Governor Lehman of New York in Albany, it seems that even more of the state than New York City has slipped from his control. Remnant strikers from recent disturbances in Rochester and Buffalo have been joined by partisans of Reed's government in Chicago, who have united to overthrow the city government and invite CSA soldiers in to protect the state. Sensing an opportunity to get closer to New York City, General Butler has ordered an advance up to the Susquehanna's source and Niagara Falls."
 amcivwar.724.d.canada: "Although the British-Canadian government has accepted the New York governor's request to secure his state's neutrality, in the western part of the state British-Canadian troops have arrived too slowly to prevent CSA General Butler's soldiers from advancing into the cities of Buffalo and Rochester, there meeting up with partisans of President Reed, and moving to a defensible line from the mouth of the Susquehanna to Niagara Falls. The CSA has established their own state government in Buffalo, and it seems the state will remain split until either the CSA or Canada seize the rest in war."

Nevertheless, put down it was, and although resistance was fierce in the streets of Newark, MacArthur's men have re-asserted control. These troops have now returned to Yonkers and Philadelphia, and organised offensives into rebellious states are being planned."

Many junior members of government, left behind for now, are unsure how to react to the situation, with some burning confidential documents from government ministries and even the Library of Congress, from which the original Constitution was flown out to Denver. Protestors in the street are still being suppressed by local police, but most of the National Guard and Army have boarded trains headed west. This morning General MacArthur addressed the rump Congress in a secret joint session, outlining his plan for suppressing civil unrest in the west before defeating Reed and Long in the East."

 amcivwar.751.d: "General MacArthur has made his decision to abandon the old seat of power on the east coast, and that means moving everything to Denver - all of the armed forces, all the ammunitions, everything that can be moved via land. We can only hope that everything will go according to General MacArthur's secret plan, and that the traitors to the north and south won't attack our troops when we're retreating westwards."
 amcivwar.751.a: "There's no turning back now."

 amcivwar.752.t: "Increased National Guard Clashes"
 amcivwar.752.d.USA: "America's unity is quickly breaking down as President MacArthur reconsolidates in the west. On the one hand, riots in the Mid-Atlantic and Appalachian regions are spreading without Federal opposition, and it seems that the east might fall to rebels before we can crush dissent in the west. On the other hand, though, it seems that the increased unrest on the East Coast is obscuring our redeployment west, and newspapers hostile to the government have not picked up on it Even better, the rebellious factions in the west and Plains are facing their own internal disorders, as strikers in Oregon and Washington collide with National Guardsmen, some of which remain loyal to Denver while others follow their governors in recognising Sacramento's rebellion, and Texan loyalist militia muster in San Antonio."
 amcivwar.752.d.TEX: "America's unity is quickly breaking down as General MacArthur's dictatorship alienates more and more citizens. We have a great opportunity in the East to take Tennessee, Kentucky, and Virginia from the doddering Federal government, and General Patton is recommending an aggressive push there. Unfortunately, it seems Federalist resistance in Texas and Oklahoma is intensifying, so an advance east might expose us to an attack in the west there."
 amcivwar.752.d.PSA: "America's unity is quickly breaking down as General MacArthur's dictatorship alienates more and more citizens. We seem to be the first target of General MacArthur's armies now mustering in the Great Plains, and there is already popular resistance to our governors' decision to align with Sacramento in Oregon and Washington. Some state representatives of the Pacific states are reportedly regretting our decision to declare a rival government, as well. Our union is under great threat."
 amcivwar.752.d.CSA: "America's unity is quickly breaking down as popular movements seek to overthrow their oppressors in Washington, Denver, Sacramento, and Baton Rouge. The Federal army seems to be undertaking no offensive moves in the east against the strikers there, but it is hard to pinpoint its exact location. Newly defected General Smedley Butler is recommending a strike to secure the old capital and Virginia, before taking New England and Kentucky. These are seen as more valuable prizes than the Midwest, as well as the most threatening should the dictator Long seize them."
 amcivwar.752.a: "Good news, perhaps?"
 amcivwar.752.b: "We have to push northeast first."
 amcivwar.752.c: "Traitors to democracy in our very midst!"
 amcivwar.752.d: "We must take D.C.!"

 amcivwar.753.t: "Passing Through Chattanooga"
 amcivwar.753.d: "Federal divisions had to pass through the city of Chattanooga, Tennessee, by train in order to reach Denver. Despite the city being right at the border with Mississippi, currently controlled by the southern traitors, our troops reached Missouri without having to fire a single shot. This was possible thanks to the Longists general staff preparing an attack on North Carolina, seeing it as a weaker area that would be more valuable to secure. In this way, our forces travelled west without suffering a single loss."
 amcivwar.753.a: "All according to the plan."

 amcivwar.754.t: "Federalist Militias Seize Southern Texas"
 amcivwar.754.d: "While the state of Texas has firmly declared its allegiance to Huey Long, forces loyal to the federal government have been in hot contention for control and so far have managed to obtain victory throughout the southern regions of the state. Governor James Allred has been declared a traitor by southern mayors, who appear determined to face off against their brethren in the rest of the state should the civil war begin in earnest."
 amcivwar.754.a: "A surprise, to be sure, but a welcome one."
 amcivwar.754.b: "Traitors everywhere!"
 amcivwar.754.c: "Long's cause seems to be losing support."

 amcivwar.755.t: "The Arkansas River Campaign"
 amcivwar.755.d: "After Southern Texas, Arkansas and Oklahoma too have been overrun by Federal militias, despite their governors declaring support for Huey Long. With both these states and San Antonio firmly in Federal hands, Houston and Austin will probably fall soon, and MacArthur will have access to the Texan oil fields for its army."
 amcivwar.755.a: "We need to move quickly, before Patton reinforces its positions."
 amcivwar.755.b: "What do they expect to accomplish with that?"

 amcivwar.756.t: "Federal Troops Cross the Mississippi"
 amcivwar.756.d: "While Governor Stark of Missouri has been aligned with Huey Long for the past two elections, in view of the army of Federal militia and soldiers pouring into his state to spread out west, he has condemned the Baton Rouge government for attempted dictatorship, and affirmed his loyalty to President MacArthur. With almost all land west of the Mississippi north of Texas secure, Federal troops are now readying for an envelopment of Texas and a strike across the Rockies against Sacramento. Our position in the west seems secure."
 amcivwar.756.a: "The advance begins here!"

 amcivwar.757.t: "The Fall of Houston"
 amcivwar.757.d: "As expected, loyalist militias from San Antonio and Oklahoma have overrun the disorganised Longist militias in Houston and Austin before General Danford could reinforce its positions. Dallas fell quickly after, and with the fall those three key cities, all of Texas is firmly under Federal control, and Governor James Allred has been captured before he could escape."
 amcivwar.757.a: "Baton Rouge is close, now."
 amcivwar.757.b: "It doesn't matter, they won't control those oil fields for long."

 amcivwar.758.t: "Chaos in the East"
 amcivwar.758.d: "As our troops left, everything east to Saint Louis collapsed into total anarchy, and we expect Longist and Syndicalist militias to divide the spoils in the east. However, that means they'll be busy there fighting each other, and we can fully focus on dealing with the Pacific rebels now."
 amcivwar.758.a: "We will take California soon."

 amcivwar.759.t: "North Carolina Declares For Huey Long"
 amcivwar.759.d: "Newly elected North Carolina Governor Clyde Hoey, since seeing Federal troops leaving the east coast, has pledged his support for Huey Long's government, seeking both protection from the Syndicalist forces in the north and protection from the riots that plagued its state since when General MacArthur's forces left. In this way, however, General Patton's forces are incredibly close to the strategic city of Norfolk, and now a race for whoever seizes Virginia first has begun."
 amcivwar.759.a: "Next stop, Virginia!"
 amcivwar.759.b: "The race for Virginia has begun."

 amcivwar.760.t: "The Race for Virginia"
 amcivwar.760.d.CSA: "After crossing North Carolina, General Patton's forces met something they didn't expect - General Butler's forces in Richmond. Apparently, they converged from West Virginia and took Virginia without resistance before General Patton could act. Patton has retreated over the border, leaving a small guard in Norfolk."
 amcivwar.760.d.TEX: "Early this morning, General Butler's forces were repelled from Richmond by General Patton's forces, after surprisingly crossing a large distance in a short amount of time, compared to the syndicalist forces. With this victory, Virginia is firmly under Huey Long's control, for now."
 amcivwar.760.a: "Good job, General Butler."
 amcivwar.760.b: "We need to be faster next time."
 amcivwar.760.c: "Well done, General Patton."
 amcivwar.760.d: "Whatever, it just means we will come back for it later."
 amcivwar.760.e: "Not our business."

 amcivwar.761.t: "Scramble for the Corridor"
 amcivwar.761.d.CSA: "After fierce fighting, Syndicalist forces took control of Tennessee and Kentucky, making important gains against Longist forces. With this new development, forces hostile to General MacArthur control everything east to the Mississippi River."
 amcivwar.761.d.TEX: "After fierce fighting, Longist forces took control of Tennessee and Kentucky, making important gains against Syndicalist forces. With this new development, forces hostile to General MacArthur control everything east to the Mississippi River."
 amcivwar.761.a: "One step closer to free all the workers of America!"
 amcivwar.761.b: "We need to repel that corrupt dictator, and soon!"
 amcivwar.761.c: "One step closer to destroy the old corrupt regime!"
 amcivwar.761.d: "We need to repel those godless syndies, and soon!"
 amcivwar.761.e: "The Mississippi River will be covered in blood, again."

 amcivwar.762.t: "The Red Flag Over Washington"
 amcivwar.762.d: "As the forces of both self-proclaimed Presidents, Reed and Long, battled on the borders of Virginia, SPA-aligned militias finally reached abandoned Washington. The city, completely empty of any military presence, was taken easily, with the historic landmarks and the rivers over the Patomac to Alexandria being secured by militia first. Since there seemed to be no sign of a counter-assault, the militia soon began transforming the National Mall and other sites, with the most attention being paid to the Capitol. Hauling down the old flag from over the home of fled Congress, soldiers paused for photographs and interviews with socialist and local newspapers, before gathering to cheer over the flag of the CSA being raised over D.C. at last."
 amcivwar.762.a: "No more will Congress oppress the workers!"
 amcivwar.762.b: "The capital must be liberated soon!"

 amcivwar.763.t: "MacArthur Repels CSA Assault in Minnesota"
 amcivwar.763.d: "Although the SPA captured the state legislature of Minnesota in the 1936 election, they were unable to make good on the promise of a socialist Minnesota, as Governor Peterson of the Farmer-Labor Party used the state's National Guard to hold out in Minneapolis long enough for MacArthur's soldiers to reach the state and repel the militia from Wisconsin and crush the strikers in Minnesota itself. President Reed has been stymied in his assault west, and his newly formed command staff is reportedly considering southern and eastern strikes instead, to push their advantage against Huey Long."
 amcivwar.763.a: "Next up, Chicago!"
 amcivwar.763.b: "Bad news."

 amcivwar.764.t: "New England in Desperate Straits"
 amcivwar.764.d: "Although the Crown had previously refused the request of New Englander governors to ensure their neutrality, since the cabinet had deemed further endangerment of the military position of the Federal government unwise, the repeat of the request last night has brought about a different reaction. With the only alternative to British-Canadian intervention in the region being occupation by the forces of the Combined Syndicates, even cabinet and Privy Council Americophiles have warmed to the idea of intervening. Should the British-Canadian government act?"
 amcivwar.764.a: "We must remain neutral."
 amcivwar.764.b: "The people of New England need us, we must help them!"

 amcivwar.765.t: "Canada Seizes New England"
 amcivwar.765.d.CSA: "The push on D.C. seems to have given the British Empire to our north the idea that we were a threat. They have accepted the request for protection by the traitorous governors of New England. Our forces were unable to make any headway in the North-East before encountering Canadian troops. New Jersey, however, fell to our militia and Internationale allies in New York City before the Entente forces could reinforce it."
 amcivwar.765.d.others: "The socialist push on D.C. seems to have given the British Empire to our north the idea that they were a real threat. They have accepted the request for protection by the governors of New England, and they are now eyeing the socialists over the border. CSA forces were unable to make any headway before encountering Canadian troops. The state of New Jersey, however, has fallen to their militia and Internationale allies in New York City before we could reinforce it."
 amcivwar.765.a: "The British are back in Boston!"
 amcivwar.765.b: "At least the socialists didn't take Boston."

 amcivwar.766.t: "Socialist Drive into New England"
 amcivwar.766.d: "Socialist militia and soldiers have quickly occupied New England in the aftermath of their assault on Washington D.C. Although there was little resistance, it is clear that there are few friends to President Reed in the old home of Republicanism, and many are still hoping Canada will save them. For now, though, the CSA is in full control of New England."
 amcivwar.766.a: "Great!"
 amcivwar.766.b: "We'll be back for them soon!"
 amcivwar.766.c: "The socialists are growing strong."

 amcivwar.767.t: "War Begins in Oregon"
 amcivwar.767.d.USA: "With the withdrawal of the Federal government west, it was obvious that General MacArthur intended to strike at the Pacific states first, seeing them as the most isolated threat. Coming over the Rocky Mountains with the last snows of winter, the 2nd and 14th Army Divisions commenced an organised attack on Oregon and the southern part of Washington. National Guardsmen in those states either sided with President MacArthur or were forced to surrender. The forces of the Denver government soon took Portland and Yakima, and the Governors of Washington and Oregon surrendered to save themselves from syndicalist agitation and war. The 3rd, 2nd, and 14th Divisions are now preparing to take California, but the Californians have already begun a counterattack, just as the Union strikes towards Arkansas once more, and the CSA moves on North Carolina.\n\nAll across the splintered and fractured nation, the splinter factions have seen their chance to begin offensive operations against all competing governments, and from Minnesota to North Carolina, from New York City to New Mexico, skirmishes and civil unrest have at last escalated to battles. It is clear to all that the Second American Civil War has begun."
 amcivwar.767.d.PSA: "With the withdrawal of the Federal government west, it was obvious that General MacArthur intended to strike at the Pacific states first, seeing them as the most isolated threat. Coming over the Rocky Mountains with the last snows of winter, the 2nd Army Division commenced an organised attack on Oregon and the southern part of Washington. Happily for the defenders, a militia early warning system in Oregon managed to bring the Californian guard out to defend La Grande, managing to push out the Army from the state. The 3rd, 2nd, and 14th Divisions are now preparing a defence in Idaho and Nevada, but the Californians have already begun a counterattack, just as the Union strikes towards Arkansas once more, and the CSA moves on North Carolina.\n\nAll across the splintered and fractured nation, the splinter factions have seen their chance to begin offensive operations against all competing governments, and from Minnesota to North Carolina, from New York City to New Mexico, skirmishes and civil unrest have at last escalated to battles.

 amcivwar.767.a: "California cannot resist us alone."
 amcivwar.767.b: "We have to strike at Portland!"
 amcivwar.767.c: "We showed them!"
 amcivwar.767.d: "Traitors everywhere!"
 amcivwar.767.e: "To war!"

 amcivwar.768.t: "Trial of the New England General Staff"
 amcivwar.768.d: "With New England's rebellion against our rule crushed, we have secured the breakaway region that took refuge under the Canadian arm in 1937. Two prominent generals from the opposition were Leslie Groves and Mark Clark of New England. As they await their fate, many have begun to wonder if these men were simply forced into fighting against us by the Canadians who did not wish to see their chunk of America returned home. No evidence points to any egregious acts committed by either man in their defence of New England. Furthermore, both men promise to faithfully serve the flag of [ROOT.GetNameDef] if they can receive a formal pardon from our government."
 amcivwar.768.a: "Issue them a pardon"
 amcivwar.768.b: "They cannot be trusted"

 amcivwar.805.d: "While they may have initially held the wishful idea of victory, the armies of [acw_losing_side.GetNameDef] have been suffering logistical and moral issues due to their recently lost control of their territories. As a result, our intelligence has reported that despite their propaganda claiming eventual total victory, their home front and frontlines have been crippled with poor morale and defeatism.\n\nAs the civil war drags on, and American fights American - small numbers of their armed forces have begun sneaking across the battlefield into our lines to defect to our army. Seeing our cause as just and perhaps wanting to end on the right side of history, they have offered their services to the armed forces of [acw_winning_side.GetNameDef]- pledging loyalty to the rightful government of America!"

 amcivwar.806.d: "When we entered the fray, we understood the difficulty and the trial that was to come as the more minor faction of the American Civil War. Despite the best efforts of our military high command and civilian industries, our forces have suffered successive defeats along the frontlines, and our civilians are beginning to experience the hardships of war. As a result, front-line officers report an increasing amount of logistical and moral issues to the military high command.\n\nSadly, this has also involved the numerous detachments of our armed forces who have seen our cause as lost and have begun to defect to [acw_winning side.GetNameDef]. As American fights American in the civil war, they have seen our position as seemingly unwinnable and thus decided to join what they believed to be the rightful side of history. While we will issue strict orders to encourage discipline, our situation grows increasingly hopeless daily."
