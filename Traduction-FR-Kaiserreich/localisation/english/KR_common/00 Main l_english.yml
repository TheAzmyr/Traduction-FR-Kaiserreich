This is not independence - far from it - but it does mean we no longer have to rely on [Root.overlord.GetAdjective] troops to secure our borders."
 generic_events.100.a: "Excellent"

 generic_events.101.t: "Order Restored in [From.GetNameDef]"
 generic_events.101.d: "While [From.GetNameDef] still labours under [Root.GetAdjective] control, the [From.GetAdjective] military has asserted enough control over its own borders that a semblance of autonomy is now possible. This is not independence - far from it - but it does mean they no longer have to rely on [Root.GetAdjective] troops to secure their borders, and are thus not so tightly under our control."
 generic_events.101.a: "So be it."

 generic_events.102.t: "Greater [Root.GetAdjective] Autonomy?"
 generic_events.102.d: "[Root.GetNameDefCap] remains under the control of the [Root.overlord.GetAdjective] government, but that control is beginning to surely lessen as our strength reasserts itself. [Root.GetAdjective] power is not something to be easily contained, and already our leaders are clamouring for more control over our own affairs.

 generic_events.106.d: "[Root.overlord.GetAdjective] control over the [Root.GetAdjective] government has been slipping for some time, now. We are too powerful for them to contain.

 generic_events.107.d: "[Root.GetAdjective] control over the [From.GetAdjective] government has been slipping for some time, now. They are too powerful for us to fully contain. There is a general clamouring among the [From.GetAdjective] people for [From.GetNameDef] to be set free, and now their government has officially submitted a demand for full independence."

As a result of the bad climate in [From.GetHerHis] operational area, the [From.GetRank] has now fallen ill, and will likely need some time to recover.

 unit_leader.1.a: "Unfortunate."

 unit_leader.2.t: "[From.GetName] Wounded"
 unit_leader.2.d: "In bringing the battle to a successful conclusion, it seems [From.GetRank] [From.GetName] put [From.GetHerselfHimself] at a bit too much risk while leading [From.GetHerHis] men.
