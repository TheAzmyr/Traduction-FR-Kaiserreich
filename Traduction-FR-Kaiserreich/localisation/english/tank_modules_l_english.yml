 gwtank_chassis: "Inter-War Tank Development"
 gwtank_chassis_desc: "The tank has proven itself a powerful weapon in the Great War. While development has slowed in the intervening years, it is no doubt going to play a major role in the wars to come."
 armor_tech_1: "Basic Armour Protection"
 armor_tech_1_desc: "Tanks during the Great War only had to contend with enemy small arms. As such, they got away with fairly thin armour. A new generation of anti-tank weaponry has made the battlefield a much more dangerous place for a tank, and much heavier protection is needed."
 armor_tech_2: "Improved Armour Protection"
