 pocket_defence: "Pocket Defence"
 pocket_defence_desc: "It is possible that, on the defensive, our troops may be caught in a pocket. In this case, they must merely hold out until the inevitable counter-attack relieves them."
 defence_in_depth: "Defence in Depth"
 vast_offensives_desc: "If a breakthrough can be achieved it must be exploited strongly as possible: A vast offensive pushing through enemy lines as deeply as possible will render the defence of their front more difficult, impossible, or irrelevant."

 mechanized_wave_desc: "Mechanised forces are ideal for conducting the rapid advances needed to properly exploit Breakthroughs, both for supporting the armoured forces and for securing the flanks of the breach."
 human_infantry_offensive: "Multi-Wave Assault"
 continuous_offensive_desc: "While properly exploited Breakthroughs are often very effective, sooner or later the attacker always becomes exhausted and the defender is able to reorganise and reform new defensive lines. However, with enough reserves and the right organisation, an offensive could be continued to a much greater depth with devastating results to the enemy."

 streamlined_line_desc: "The standardisation and rigid structure of the assembly line are keys to its efficiency and safety. These should be the key aspects to develop in our industrial production."
 concentrated_industry5_desc: "Major industrial complexes now combine many parts of our industry, minimising the costs of transports and labour."
 dispersed_industry2_desc: "Further decentralising our manufacturing makes it harder to strike at specific parts of it."
 construction2_desc: "Modernising our tools and equipment will further aid our construction efforts."
 construction4_desc: "A higher degree of mechanisation and better routines further improves building construction speeds."
 construction5_desc: "The future of efficient construction will require more extensive planning for individual projects as well as standardised solutions wherever possible."
 improved_decimetric_radar_desc: "The use of radar has already proven crucial, but our decimetric radar sets are too few to ensure good coverage. Fitting more units with radar will allow us to maximise our technological edge."
 improved_centimetric_radar_desc: "Introducing cutting-edge radar techniques like mono-pulse radars in key operations will allow for extreme tracking accuracy."
 improved_encryption_desc: "Limitation in the randomisation of cipher machines can be exploited to break the ciphers. By improving the randomness of the rotor mechanics, we can make this kind of cryptanalysis more difficult."
 basic_decryption_desc: "Cryptanalysis is increasingly becoming an advanced mathematical science. Systems like card catalogues and devices like cyclometers can aid the necessary work."
 improved_decryption_desc: "The development of more sophisticated computers allows for new applications of cryptanalysis methods like differencing, which can be used to break advanced ciphers when combined with new hand code-breaking methods."
 rocket_interceptor_2_desc: "Still considered extremely dangerous to operate, the rocket-powered fighters are now aided by auto-pilots and towing by other aircraft to maximise the use of their extreme speed but short fuel window."
 artillery1_desc: "With more modern materials and mechanisms, howitzers and field guns from the Weltkrieg can be re-chambered and modernised for modern warfare."
 mountain_gun_desc: "The mountainous terrain of Northern India led to the development of an artillery piece that could be dismantled and carried on mule back to wherever it was needed."
