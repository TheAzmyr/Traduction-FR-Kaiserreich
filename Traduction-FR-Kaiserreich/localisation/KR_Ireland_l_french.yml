# Agri/Infra Wing
IRE_ARD:0 "Agricultural Reform Drive"
IRE_ARD_desc:0 "The rural areas of Ireland are by far the most neglected by the government to date, and could easily serve as a starting point for radical economic improvement. Our farming methods are woefully out of date compared to the agricultural revolutions taking place in mainland Europe, and our infrastructure is woefully behind."

ire.ard.no.tt:0 "\n§GKeep the standard level of this economic bonus.§!\n\n"

ire.59.t:0 "The Agricultural Reform Drive"
ire.59.d:0 "We have left our rural areas in a state of backwards insignificance for far too long. It is time that we do something. Ireland is moving forward, and so too must her rural communities. Much of our industry has traditionally relied upon agriculture, but times have changed. If we want to keep agriculture as a vital part of our economy, then we need to upgrade our farming facilities. Similarly, much of Ireland's road systems are in a state of complete disrepair, and currently the responsibility for repair work of any kind falls to private enterprise. Our transport network in general could be considerably improved, allowing us to move both people and economic goods around the country at a more rapid rate. This situation calls for obvious economic expenditure, but we must keep the national debt in mind. More radical changes will encourage the population that we are serious about dealing with the issue, however."
ire.59.a:0 "Let's not push it too much."
ire.59.b:0 "We can make a more substantial investment."
ire.59.c:0 "This has to be the priority. Spend as much as we can."

IRE_MFR:0 "Mechanised Farming Reform"
IRE_MFR_desc:0 "There's no doubt that the farming industry is one of the biggest in our nation. The current agricultural techniques used however leave a lot to be desired. Through adopting the sort of advances in mechanisation seen in the United States and in Europe, we can bring our farms up to speed. Farms feed the people, and therefore they are the lifeblood of growth."
ire.60.t:0 "Mechanised Farming Investment"
ire.60.d:0 "Because of our expansive investment policy, we have seen fit to implement more further reaching farming reforms than would otherwise have been possible. Mechanising our farms will finally help Ireland overcome the shadow of the Great Famine, and will help our population to grow."

IRE_RRMB_desc:0 "The rural areas of Ireland are in need of considerable renovations and maintenance. There is currently no public body tasked with doing these repairs, leaving rural communities to rely on notoriously unreliable private businesses.

IRE_TNTN:0 "TransÉireann National Network"

Many British-owned factories were closed down when Ireland gained her independence, and have since fallen into disrepair. Ireland's industry lacks any real focus or direction, despite the population being eager and ready to work. It is up to the government to decide just how much of an investment into the civilian industry they wish to make."

ire.65.t:0 "Saorstát Alcohol Factories"
ire.65.d:0 "Following the commencement of the IFI initiative, the Irish Department of Industry & Commerce have decided on perhaps a rather obvious choice to kick start Ireland's industry: alcohol. Ireland has a long and proud tradition of producing Irish whisky, but much of the production is done in small family-run distilleries throughout the countryside. The proposed Saorstát development will open up several alcohol factories and produce some much-needed employment for our nation, but the location for the development has yet to be decided, only that it should be in one of our less industrially developed regions."
ire.65.a:0 "Ulster. God knows, if anyone needs a drink, it's them."

IRE_RTN:0 "Revitalise the North"
IRE_RTN_desc:0 "After the 1925 ceasefire, the northern most region of Ulster has been in an industrial slump relative to the rest of the nation. Belfast once used to be a thriving industrial city and other towns and cities such as Derry and Coleraine were looking likely to follow. Revisiting this issue and energising the north with industrial investments will help to lift the region."
ire.67.t:0 "The Harland & Wolff Shipyard"
ire.67.d:0 "During the early 1900s, the Harland & Wolff shipyard in Belfast had the prestigious honour of being the world's largest shipyard. After the capitulation of the British Empire during the first Weltkrieg and their second capitulation not long after to the Trade Unionists, it has fallen into disrepair and has been overtaken by other yards throughout the world. With refurbishment, it could once again be a great asset, but this time for Ireland, not the British Imperialists."
ire.67.a:0 "With some repairs and a recruiting effort, the shipyard will create a good few jobs."
ire.67.b:0 "Harland & Wolff will shine once again."

ire.68.t:0 "The Short Brothers Company"
ire.68.d:0 "Founded in England in 1908, the Short Brothers PLC is a private aerospace company with some existing operations in Ulster. Having seen their business suffer significant losses thanks to the fate of the British Empire, they are now looking for new opportunities and see expansion in Ulster as their highest priority. We can subsidise their venture at some cost to our nation, but the benefits of having a prominent aerospace industry are obvious in peace and wartime."
ire.68.a:0 "Help them settle."
ire.68.b:0 "Make a significant investment."
ire.68.c:0 "Belfast shall become their worldwide headquarters. Throw money at them."

IRE_SHORTBROS:0 "Short Brothers Aerospace PLC"
IRE_SHORTBROS_desc:0 "Founded in 1908, the Short Brothers private limited company was the world's first private aircraft manufacturer.

Recent economic developments in the nation have been seen as an encouraging sign that the Dáil is committed to completing Ireland's economic rebirth. The creation of the NIIF will allow for the development of specialised construction companies and facilitate the purchase of building materials to keep the wheels of industrialisation turning."

IRE_ESIC3_desc:0 "The ESIC have become a major force of scientific progress and are significantly contributing to Ireland's scientific progress."
ire.92.t:0 "A Small Step for Ireland..."
ire.92.d:0 "The Éireann Scientific Innovation Council (ESIC) is a newly created sub-department of the government, with one simple purpose in mind: a devotion to academia and scientific progress. Ireland has long been seen as a rural backwater by other world powers, a place that progress seemed to leave behind. Whilst a cruel opinion, it is not without truth. Centuries of British rule left Ireland largely neglected whilst the rest of the world raced on. It's time to catch up. The ESIC will be composed of expert scientists recruited from both the Irish population and from friendly foreign allies. ESIC research teams will increase our overall research efficiency and may even occasionally produce major breakthroughs in certain fields. The government must now decide how important the ESIC is to the nation: how much funds should they receive?"
ire.92.a:0 "Science is important, but it's not the only priority. A low amount of funding."
ire.92.b:0 "We will give them a prudent amount for such a key issue."
ire.92.c:0 "Ireland must leap from the past so that she can walk in the future. Massively fund the project."
ire.93.t:0 "Advances in Research Efficiency"
ire.93.d:0 "Thanks to steady funding by the Irish government, the ESIC has gradually been expanding over time and has grown in experience and efficiency, allowing them to tackle multiple research projects simultaneously. Ireland's scientific development is rapidly improving alongside the ESIC's own progress, and the investment is obviously paying off."
ire.93.a:0 "The news we've all been waiting for."
ire.94.t:0 "Impressive Advances Made"
ire.94.d:0 "Given time and plenty of funding, the ESIC has developed into a modern force in scientific research, to the point where Ireland is starting to be seen as a respected nation in terms of it's research and development capabilities. No longer shall the Irish people be mocked as peasant farmers and louts!"

ire.esic.brkthru:0 "Gain a §Yrandom research§! speed bonus."

IRE_IRF:0 "Industrial Research Priorities"
IRE_IRF_desc:0 "Our national has a vital need for industry, and that need is coupled with an equal requirement for research and development. Many of our factories are decrepit and out of date. To build a modern industry, Ireland needs modern factories. Investing into industrial research will allow us to move further towards progress."
IRE_ISP:0 "Irish Synthetics Project"
IRE_ISP_desc:0 "Although our people are industrious and our island ripe for industrialisation, there is no accounting for the unfortunate lack of natural resources available to us relative to the major powers of the world. Oil and rubber are particularly problematic, so if we would like to make use of these resources in our industries, Ireland must develop a functional synthetics programme."
IRE_XPESIC:0 "Expand the ESIC"
IRE_XPESIC_desc:0 "The ESIC have been doing a fantastic job to date, but they still have room to grow. Further investment will facilitate their involvement in a greater number of research projects, enabling our teams to cover more ground and deal with more fields. This will improve our overall flexibility in the field of science."

The state of our economy to date has been rather unimpressive and uninviting, but with the recent developments spurred on by the IEAA, perhaps we can begin improving this situation. Irish business would grow more quickly if we encouraged immigration from other less developed nations."
ire.eie.tt:0 "Begin a reform programme to encourage §Yincreased immigration§! to our nation.\n\n"
ire.96.t:0 "The Dáil Decides: Immigration"
ire.96.d:0 "As part of their new IEAA initiative, the Dáil have argued for the expansion of Ireland's immigration policies. Under British rule, immigration to Ireland was almost non-existent and actively discouraged. Now that Ireland is free and her economy is growing at a rapid rate, there is an opportunity to start actively encouraging immigration. This process could prove extremely costly however, as significant funds will have to be invested in housing developments and administrative processes. There may also be social unrest with a large influx of immigrants arriving on Irish shores. Our choice of policy going forward will be very important for our nation, and it's important to consider the potential consequences."
ire.96.a:0 "Relax our policies. A few more people can't hurt."

Whilst there may be greater riches still that lurk beneath the green fields of Éire, they have yet to be discovered. There are however plenty of greener pastures to be found abroad, with valuable resources to exploit. Irish economic planners have drafted a list of four nations in possession of valuable resources that Irish businesses could theoretically exploit in a lucrative foreign venture. Morocco, colony of the German Empire, is said to be brimming with iron ore and would make for a good steel industry. The Dutch East Indies are rich in rubber and oil, whilst South Africa is said to have an abundance of valuable chromium. Finally, there is the exotic Brazil in the Americas, known to have plenty of tungsten currently going untapped. We should develop our diplomatic relations with one of these nations and ask for permission to begin an enterprise in their territory, naturally in exchange for them having a share of the profits."

IRE_DESTROYERDOCKYARD:0 "Dublin Destroyer Shipyard"
IRE_DESTROYERDOCKYARD_desc:0 "Screens play a key role in any naval strategy. Ireland might not have much of a fleet to speak of at present, but our admirals know the basics. Whatever type of fleet we are likely to produce, screens will be important. A shipyard in Dublin could be adapted to focus upon the development of destroyers and light cruisers."
ire_dublin_shipyard:0 "Dublin Destroyer Shipyard"
ire_dublin_shipyard_desc:0 "We are now able to produce light screen ships at a more rapid rate courtesy of a specialised shipyard opened in Dublin."
IRE_CAPITALSHIPDOCKYARD:0 "Belfast Capital Shipwright"
IRE_CAPITALSHIPDOCKYARD_desc:0 "Small ships and submarines are children's toys in comparison to the mighty visage of a battleship. If we're going to be taken seriously as any sort of naval power, we need to produce big, powerful ships. Belfast is the perfect place to start."
ire_belfast_shipwright:0 "Belfast Capital Shipwright"
ire_belfast_shipwright_desc:0 "Belfast is one of the finest shipbuilding cities in the world and it's got even better thanks to a shipyard designed entirely to build battleships for our nation."

# Air force
IRE_AIRFORCE:0 "An tAerchór"
IRE_AIRFORCE_desc:0 "One glaring error of the Irish military so far has been the lack of any air force, seen as too unimportant and expensive. With the British building one of the largest air forces in the world, it is vital that we correct this if we are to stand a chance."
IRE_CHANNELDEFENSE:0 "Defend the Irish Sea"
IRE_CHANNELDEFENSE_desc:0 "Britain's historical strength has been its navy, with which it could defend its island from invasion. The best way to cripple Britain's power and protect Ireland from a British landing would be to research and build a series of bombers capable of destroying ships."
IRE_CHANNELDEFENSE2:0 "Advanced Bombing Campaign"
IRE_CHANNELDEFENSE2_desc:0 "Now that we have researched naval bombers, we should use our newfound knowledge to research other kinds of bombers that can help us take the fight to Great Britain."
IRE_FIGHTERFOCUS:0 "Protect Éire from Above"
IRE_FIGHTERFOCUS_desc:0 "In the event of a war, the British air force would be able to invade Ireland's skies with impunity. We must research aircraft that can prevent this and shoot any tresspassing British planes out of the sky."
IRE_FIGHTERFOCUS2:0 "Heavy Fighter Programme"
IRE_FIGHTERFOCUS2_desc:0 "With our fighter research having been a success, we should now look into building heavy fighters, effective at a longer range than regular fighters and adept at destroying enemy bombers."
IRE_AIRBASEEXPANSION:0 "Expand our Airfields"
IRE_AIRBASEEXPANSION_desc:0 "Currently our airfields in Dublin and Derry are subpar compared to those of many other nations, we must bring those airfields up to standard."
IRE_WOMENPILOTS:0 "Women In The IRAF"
IRE_WOMENPILOTS_desc:0 "While many have been opposed to the inclusion of women in the Irish army or navy despite the service of the Cumann na mBan during the Easter Rising, attitudes are more open to allowing them to enlist in the air force, perhaps following famous American pilot Amelia Earhart's example."
IRE_AIRCOMMAND:0 "Radar Technology"
IRE_AIRCOMMAND_desc:0 "Now that we have built an air force for ourselves, we should investigate radar technology. This would allow us to detect enemy aircraft, making it easier for our planes to destroy them, as well as giving us intelligence on enemy troops and ships."
IRE_ANYTHINGFORIRELAND:0 "Anything for Ireland"
IRE_ANYTHINGFORIRELAND_desc:0 "Our enemies are winning! After 700 years of fighting for freedom, we cannot let Ireland be overrun once again! In this desperate time, we have come up with a radical idea of suicidal attacks by planes laden with explosives on enemy warships. May God forgive us."

# Army
IRE_INFANTRY:0 "An tArm"
IRE_INFANTRY_desc:0 "Military tactics and doctrines have changed since the end of the Northern Campaign in 1926. The Irish army on the other hand has not. It is essential that we stay up to date when the outbreak of war in Europe is looking more and more likely by the day."
IRE_DIRECTIONOFTHEARMY:0 "Direction of the Army"
IRE_DIRECTIONOFTHEARMY_desc:0 "Currently our military is divided on how to proceed. Should we imitate the standard armies of other nations as we did in the Northern Campaign, or adapt the tactics and structure we pioneered during our War of Independence to conventional warfare?"
IRE_MOBILE1:0 "Mobile Warfare"
IRE_MOBILE1_desc:0 "Military strategy is changing, with mobility and tank warfare becoming popular. We too must keep up with the times, and begin studying mobility doctrines."
IRE_MOBILE2:0 "Motorising the Saighdiúirí"
IRE_MOBILE2_desc:0 "If mobility warfare is to work our regular infantry must be motorised so as to outrun the enemy otherwise our spearheads will be left stranded and vulnerable to encirclement themselves."
IRE_MOBILE3:0 "Armour Advances"
IRE_MOBILE3_desc:0 "Tanks are key to mobile warfare, forming the spearhead of an encirclement of the enemy. We must research tanks if our mobility tactics are to be successful."
IRE_FIREPOWER1:0 "Superior Firepower"
IRE_FIREPOWER1_desc:0 "The new mobility doctrine is primarily for nations that intend to invade others, which Ireland has no need of. Our doctrine should be focused on the use of artillery and preserving the lives of our men."
IRE_FIREPOWER2:0 "Small Arms Focus"
IRE_FIREPOWER2_desc:0 "An army cannot fight without supplies or ammunition. While German supplies and American donations proved helpful during the War of Independence, we must learn to research and produce our own supplies."
IRE_FIREPOWER3:0 "The Dublin Arsenal"
IRE_FIREPOWER3_desc:0 "Our doctrine depends on producing artillery so as to preserve the lives of our men. As we cannot just depend on just buying from international munitions companies we must study how to produce artillery ourselves."
IRE_ANHONOURABLEARMY:0 "An Honourable Army"
IRE_ANHONOURABLEARMY_desc:0 "Our army must be focused on order, discipline, and defence. While these tactics may have failed during the Easter Rising, they worked well during the Northern Campaign and are a better fit for conventional warfare."
IRE_APEOPLESARMY:0 "A People's Army"
IRE_APEOPLESARMY_desc:0 "Our army must be focused on speed and quick planning, adapting some of the tactics that allowed us to defeat the British during the Irish War of Independence to conventional warfare."
IRE_PATRIOTICMOVEMENT:0 "Patriotic Movement"
IRE_PATRIOTICMOVEMENT_desc:0 "Now that we have decided to adapt our War of Independence tactics to the modern day, we should promote a campaign comparing the modern army to the Flying Columns and that we pioneered these tactics to invigorate a sense of national pride in our people."
IRE_FIGHTINGSPIRIT:0 "The Fighting Irish"
IRE_FIGHTINGSPIRIT_desc:0 "While some of our forces are having trouble adapting to our decision, many Irishmen, some in Ireland and some outside, have fought for armies such as the American or British armies. We could hire their help to assist in training our troops."
IRE_PROFESSIONALARMY:0 "A Professional Army"
IRE_PROFESSIONALARMY_desc:0 "Now that we have decided to move to a more professional army, we must train our soldiers and officers, many of whom are still accustomed to the strategies of yesteryear."
IRE_OFFICERSCHOOL:0 "Establish an Officer School"
IRE_OFFICERSCHOOL_desc:0 "Currently, many officers in our army lack proper training as a result of our armed forces being descended from a guerrilla rather than a professional army. If we were to establish an officer training school which would train civilians and enlisted personnel in order for them to gain a commission as Irish officers, it would improve the quality of our military."
IRE_BLUEBLOUSES:0 "Women's Auxillary"

IRE_FLYINGCOLUMNS:0 "The New Flying Column"
IRE_FLYINGCOLUMNS_desc:0 "While the reforming of the Army has been a long process, it is now finally complete and the nation is stronger and prouder for it, knowing that in the event of an invasion the defence of Ireland will be in strong and able hands."

# Navy
IRE_NAVY:0 "An tSeirbhís Chabhlaigh"
IRE_NAVY_desc:0 "Despite being an island nation and neighbouring to Britain, our navy only consists of a few destroyers mainly used for search and rescue of drowning fishermen. If we are to stand a chance against Britain's famous navy, we will need to expand."
IRE_WOLFHOUNDS:0 "Wolfhounds of the Irish Sea"
IRE_WOLFHOUNDS_desc:0 "During the Weltkrieg despite being outclassed by the British Navy, the Germans used U-Boats to great effect. Our first step should be to research submarine tactics so that we can also replicate this success."
IRE_WOLFHOUNDS2:0 "The Second Fenian Ram"
IRE_WOLFHOUNDS2_desc:0 "In 1881 Irish inventor John Phillip Holland created a submarine known as the Holland Boat No. II, nicknamed the Fenian Ram, for the Irish Republican Brotherhood. Now we must follow in their footsteps and build a submarine fleet of our own to defend ourselves against the British Navy."
IRE_SCREENS:0 "Screen Research Project"
IRE_SCREENS_desc:0 "The purpose of a screen is to scout for a fleet and protect it from submarines and aircraft, something that would be useful in detecting British submarines and especially Britain's infamous RAF."
IRE_CARRIERS:0 "Carrier Technology"
IRE_CARRIERS_desc:0 "Now that we have begun to reform our navy, we should research aircraft carriers, a ship capable of basing bombers while at sea, which could be very useful in tandem with a reforming of our air force."
IRE_CAPITALFLEET:0 "A Grand Fleet for Ireland"
IRE_CAPITALFLEET_desc:0 "If we are to stand up to the British, we must be able to build a fleet similar to their own. While this will take a long time it will pay off in the end, just as it did for Germany which once also had a far inferior fleet to the British."
IRE_CAPITALFLEET2:0 "Better Battleships"
IRE_CAPITALFLEET2_desc:0 "Now that we have begun to build a grand fleet to match the British, we should look into the building of a Super-Heavy Battleship. While it will take a long time to build and will be expensive, the results should be worth it."
IRE_RUTHLESS:0 "Ruthless Interdiction Doctrine"
IRE_RUTHLESS_desc:0 "Guerre de course, or Handelskrieg, is an old tactic involving disrupting an enemy nation's trade by attacking its merchant shipping. With this, we could damage Britain without having to face their fleet."
IRE_DIRECTCONFRONTATION:0 "Direct Confrontation Doctrine"

IRE_MARINES:0 "Muirshaighdiúirí"
IRE_MARINES_desc:0 "Now that we have expanded our navy, we should consider the training of an elite unit of marines to spearhead a land invasion. If this was to be successful we could finally take the 700 years fight for Irish freedom to British land."

# Defence
IRE_HOMEDEFENSE:0 "Fortify the Shannon"
IRE_HOMEDEFENSE_desc:0 "One of Ireland's key natural landmarks is the River Shannon, dividing the east and west of Ireland. Our military has proposed fortifying both sides of the river, so that we can hold the line along the Shannon in the event of an enemy invasion."

IRE_CITADELPROJECT:0 "Tearmann - The Citadel Project"
IRE_CITADELPROJECT_desc:0 "While we have focused on fortifying the coasts and the rivers, the cities themselves have remained somewhat unprotected.

IRE_CITADELDUBLIN:0 "Citadel Dublin"
IRE_CITADELDUBLIN_desc:0 "The second stage of the plan is to completely fortify Dublin with forts, anti-aircraft equipment, coastal forts and radar. We must either choose to secure Dublin or Belfast as we don't have the resources to fortify both."
IRE_CITADELBELFAST:0 "Citadel Belfast"

ire.1.d:0 "Éire finds herself once again in a grave crisis. Our strategic planners foresaw that this day would come, and now that we are at war, it is time to make good use of their foresight. Brave sons of Ireland await the command across the nation to take up arms and defend their country from foreign aggressors."
ire.1.a:0 "We need them all."
ire.1.b:0 "A half company will do."
ire.1.c:0 "Call up only the infantry reserves."

# Introduction Events
ire.2.t:0 "The State of the Republic, 1936"
ire.2.d:0 "After countless years of arduous rebellion and weathering oppressive British rule, the Irish people have won their freedom, and their country back. But as one enemy was vanquished, another rose in her place, perhaps yet more dangerous still. Michael Collins sits a reluctant dictator, eager to defend the independence of his nation at any cost, yet his political enemies are many as the 1937 election approaches. Ireland is a powder keg, and it's only a matter of time until it explodes."
ire.2.a:0 "These are turbulent times."

ire.53.t:0 "Problems Up North"
ire.53.d:0 "Edward Carson, the former leader of the Unionist Party, died last year aged 81. He was an extremely divisive figure whilst alive and fled to England when Ireland gained her independence and took back Ulster. He was particularly reviled outside of Ulster for his persecution of beloved Irish poet and author Oscar Wilde. His memory was venerated today by loyalists in the north of Ireland, who held a memorial service in Belfast with several leading members of the UUP speaking in his name. The memorial attracted quite a crowd, showing that Carson still has power even in death. His spectre is looming over Ulster, just as the tensions and threat of rebellion loom over it as well."
ire.53.a:0 "He's a problem even from the grave."

# Unionist Tensions (and debug)

ire.3.c:0 "Report Unionist Tensions."
ire.4.t:0 "Ulster at Peace"
ire.4.d:0 "After the recent unrest, the people of Ulster seem to once again be at peace. There's no telling for how long this peace will last, but there's no doubt that Ireland is better off for it. The Dáil has one less issue to deal with."
ire.4.a:0 "What a relief."
ire.5.t:0 "Disgruntled Populace in Ulster"
ire.5.d:0 "For some time now, there has been a slow but surely growing unrest in the northern region of Ireland, Ulster. Stirred up by predominantly Protestant Unionists, who advocate for closer ties with England, Ulster has become something of a problem region for the Dáil. If this situation is not handled carefully, the issues that divide the region are sure to grow more incendiary."
ire.5.a:0 "This is a delicate matter."
ire.6.t:0 "Radical Movements Mobilising"
ire.6.d:0 "In response to what they see as oppressive policies towards the people of Ulster, Unionist organisations are growing more radical and attracting the most disenfranchised and angry Northerners to their cause. They are presently meeting in secret in pubs and Orange Order halls around the country, safe from the prying eyes of the Gardaí."
ire.6.a:0 "Bloody radicals."
ire.7.t:0 "Riots in Belfast"
ire.7.d:0 "The streets of Belfast are in an uproar after the Unionists have begun to make their play for a general uprising. Disgruntled Ulstermen, the vast majority of which are Protestants, have taken to the streets in a violent stand against what they believe to be hostile intentions from Dublin. The Dáil has called an emergency meeting to address their grievances, but that may not be enough to stop them."
ire.7.a:0 "Madness."
ire.8.t:0 "Civil War Imminent"
ire.8.d:0 "All measures, peaceful or otherwise, to try and pacify Ulster has failed. The Ulster Unionists, backed by the Ulster Volunteer Force, have announced their independence from Ireland and have declared that they will defend the province of Ulster to the death from Dublin, and Catholic, rule. A civil war is inevitable."
ire.8.a:0 "God help us."

ire.131.t:0 "Radical Movements Diminishing"
ire.131.d:0 "The more radical elements of the Ulster region are slowly but surely diminishing. While the core members will remain as extreme as ever, they are finding it harder to recruit new members thanks to our latest policy changes. If things turn for the worse though, they'll most likely find followers soon enough, and we have to be wary. There's no peace in Ulster yet, only silence."
ire.131.a:0 "We'd best stay on our guard."

ire.132.t:0 "Riots Dispersed"
ire.132.d:0 "The streets of Belfast have been silenced and there are no riots anymore. Bricks, newspapers and trash litter the sideways as people return to work. However, the people who participated believe they have only lost a battle, not the war. In their work-place, at the pub and at home they whisper of when to strike next, not if."
ire.132.a:0 "At least they aren't in the streets."

# MacNeill Commission

ire.33.t:0 "The MacNeill Commission"
ire.33.d:0 "Following the atrocities that occurred during the Ulster Unionist Protest March, the events of which are now coming to be known as 'Bloody Wednesday' by Belfast residents, the government has launched a full investigation into the military's involvement and culpability in the massacre. Led by Hugo MacNeill, the commission has presented their initial report. MacNeill believes that, contrary to the claims by Liam Lynch and his soldiers, it was not the Unionist protesters who instigated the fatal clashes with the army. Instead, he believes that Lynch and his men were looking for a fight all along and later planted weapons on dead protesters to give themselves an alibi. If these allegations are true, it's a shocking revelation and may have wide reaching consequences for the IRA."
ire.33.a:0 "Respect the Commission. Lynch and the army were at fault."
ire.33.b:0 "The army were to blame, but Lynch couldn't do anything to stop it."
ire.33.c:0 "Obviously, the Unionists started the conflict. The army and Lynch are blameless."

ire.34.t:0 "The Trial of Liam Lynch"
ire.34.d:0 "Liam Lynch has today been brought before a court-martial presided over by the highest chiefs of the Irish Republican Army. He is accused of encouraging, perhaps even personally orchestrating, the massacre. The consequences of such a direct breach in military protocol are severe. The public have been incensed by the revelations of the MacNeill Commission and are baying for blood, no more so than in Ulster. It is up to the court to decide whether or not Lynch is truly guilty however, and if so, what punishment should be dealt."
ire.34.a:0 "Lynch is guilty. Discharge him from service and imprison him."

# Problems with Integration
ire.35.t:0 "Problems with Integration"
ire.35.d:0 "From the start it was obvious that there would be some problems integrating the Irish-Americans into our Republic. The wealthier note the lack of democracy as they knew it in the US while the less well off feel that their situation is being exploited by Irish business. Locals also have grievances as they feel the newcomers are stealing jobs from them as well as seeing their cultural traditions as not in keeping with native Irish culture. To top it off Unionists view the immigrants as an attempt by the Republic to colonise Ulster, where many have settled."
ire.35.a:0 "Something must be done!"

# Unionist Protest March
ire.36.t:0 "Unionists Organise Protest March"
ire.36.d:0 "News has spread from Belfast this morning that the Unionists are organising a protest march against what they perceive to be unfair treatment from the government in Dublin. Since Ireland gained her independence, the people of Ulster have become increasingly marginalised and attempts to 'green' up the region and purge the British legacy there have thus far failed. The idea of letting this march go undeterred does not sit well with the majority of the Irish people, or the government. But stopping it may only make the situation worse..."
ire.36.a:0 "This is a clear attempt to stir up trouble. Prevent the march."
ire.36.b:0 "It is their democratic right. Let it proceed."

#Banning the March
ire.63.t:0 "Murder in Ulster"
ire.63.d:0 "A local party secretary for Fine Gael, Sinead O'Connell, was found dead this morning on the coast of Whiteabby, only miles from the regional capital. Her body had obviously been taken some distance from the site of the murder itself. A letter claiming responsibility arrived at the Gardaí headquarters in Belfast, sent allegedly by the Ulster Volunteer Force. The murder appears to have been an act of retaliation for the government's recent decision to ban an attempted Unionist Protest March. News of the murder has spread like wildfire across the nation, and the populace are shocked."
ire.63.a:0 "This is horrible. Something must be done about Ulster."

# Unionist Protest March 2
ire.37.t:0 "Unionist Preparations Cause Tensions"
ire.37.d:0 "After a local government representative announced that there would be no official efforts made to prevent the Unionist protest march, local Catholic residents have loudly voiced concerns to the regional Gardaí. They claim that the protest march is nothing more than a thinly veiled attempt to intimidate the Catholic community in Belfast, who find themselves still partially outnumbered by the Protestant, largely Unionist, majority. The demands have not fallen on deaf ears and there is a growing call for the Irish Republican Army to be deployed along the planned march route to protect the Catholic community and make sure things don't get out of hand."
ire.37.a:0 "We must protect the Catholic minority. They are the true sons and daughters of Éire."
ire.37.b:0 "Deploying the military against our own people? Nonsense. Let the Gardaí handle it."

# Deployment Option Choice

ire.40.d:0 "Sighs of relief were breathed up and down the country today as the Ulster Unionist Protest March went ahead without any trouble breaking out. Whilst there were concerns that the Unionists may turn their frustration into violence, these fears in the end turned out to go unrealised. Whilst this march has proven to be a contentious affair for the nation, at least it didn't result in any bloodshed today. Nonetheless, the Unionists growing demand for independence can no longer be ignored. There must be decisive action to address the question of Ulster, lest the situation grow out of control."
ire.40.d2:0 "Terrible news has spread throughout the country following the Ulster Unionist Protest March. Whilst it is still difficult to understand the full scale of what happened, it is understood that a conflict broke out between the IRA forces commanded by Eoin O'Duffy, and several of the protesters. The resulting violence left many of the protesters dead at the hands of army rifles, and the incident has quickly set the region of Ulster alight in a furore. Some cry for vengeance, others for justice, but one thing is certain: this is a black day for Ireland."
ire.40.d3:0 "Sighs of relief were breathed up and down the country today as the Ulster Unionist Protest March went ahead without serious trouble breaking out. Under the watchful eyes of the Irish Republican Army commanded by Richard Mulcahy, the protesters were escorted through Catholic regions with only minor incidents taking place. The march has been an extremely contentious affair among the public at large and in politics, and many are glad that it has passed by without any serious issues. However, it's clear that the atmosphere in Belfast is a tense one at the moment, and many Unionists did not take kindly to the presence of the military."
ire.40.d4:0 "Violent scenes marred the Ulster Unionist Protest March today as widespread fighting erupted between Unionist protesters and outraged Catholic citizens. It's unclear who threw the first stone or fired the first shot, but several people have been killed and many more injured. This incident is just another worrying sign of the turmoil quickly starting to grow in the north of Ireland. Truly a black day for the nation."

ire.41.d:0 "Following the atrocities that occurred during the Ulster Unionist Protest March, the events of which are now coming to be known as 'Bloody Wednesday' by Belfast residents, the government has launched a full investigation into the military's involvement and culpability in the massacre. Led by Richard Mulcahy, the commission has presented their initial report. Mulcahy believes that, contrary to the claims by Eoin O'Duffy and his soldiers, it was not the Unionist protesters who instigated the fatal clashes with the army. Instead, he believes that O'Duffy and his men were looking for a fight all along and later planted weapons on dead protesters to give themselves an alibi. If these allegations are true, it's a shocking revelation and may have wide reaching consequences for the IRA."

# One Shot Tension Increasing Events (Flavour)

ire.43.t:0 "Unionist Workers Clash in Belfast"
ire.43.d:0 "Following the shift in power that occurred when the British were chased out of Ireland, many Catholic business owners rose to prominence in Ulster. However, their rise in socio-economic status came often at cost to the Protestant residents of the region, who had previously enjoyed such unbridled dominance over the Catholic minority. A group of Ulster Unionist factory workers went on strike today citing unfair pay and unwarranted treatment by their Catholic employer. Their strike soon turned violent when they were attacked by what some believe to be hired thugs. Nobody was killed, although Belfast City Hospital had plenty of patients in the immediate aftermath. This will not do the tense situation in Ulster any favours."
ire.43.a:0 "This is worrying."

ire.44.t:0 "Murder in Derry"
ire.44.d:0 "The body of a young man was found this morning in a cold and desolate alleyway near the centre of Derry. According to a follow-up police report, he had been stabbed several times and left for dead. The man was previously known to the local police force as a prominent member of a Unionist volunteers group with local ties in the Waterside. There have already been cries that the murder was committed by a Catholic and that the police will turn a blind eye. However warranted or unwarranted these claims may be, the situation in Ulster is, as ever, volatile."
ire.44.a:0 "Frightening times for Derry."

ire.45.t:0 "Ulster Unionist Party Holds Rally"
ire.45.d:0 "There was a massive turn out this afternoon for a UUP rally held in the city centre of Belfast. Thousands of Ulstermen and women came out in the sunshine to listen to prominent Unionist speakers. There was plenty of time for song and dance, but just as much time for increasingly violent rhetoric regarding the status of Ulster in relation to the rest of Ireland. Whilst the words 'revolt' or 'uprising' might not have been spoken out loud, they were certainly thought. Of great concern to the Irish government will be the sheer number of people attending the rally. Clearly, the Unionist movement enjoys widespread popular support."
ire.45.a:0 "This movement is becoming increasingly popular."

ire.46.t:0 "Concert Hall Attacked in Antrim"
ire.46.d:0 "In the latest shocking incident from Ulster, a concert hall in County Antrim was subjected to a violent attack. Believed to have been carried out by the Protestant dissident group, the Ulster Volunteer Force, the attack saw several members of a Dublin band shot dead, as well as several concert goers. The motivation for the attack is believed to be another act of terrorism against the Irish state, acts that will continue as long as Ulster remains a part of Ireland, according to the movements occasional cryptic communications with the police and the public."
ire.46.a:0 "Awful."

ire.47.t:0 "Reprisal Shootings"
ire.47.d:0 "Seemingly in response to the recent violence carried out by the Ulster Volunteer Force, five men with known ties to the group were found dead in a field near a farm twenty miles outside of Belfast. The victims appear to have been executed. It is believed that the men were rounded up during the night and taken together to be killed, although it is unknown at this time who might have orchestrated such an action. The tensions in Ulster are growing as the situation grows more violent, and the Irish government are facing increasing outcry at their apparent inability to address the instability of their nation."
ire.47.a:0 "The cycle of violence continues."

ire.48.t:0 "Craig Speaks Out"
ire.48.d:0 "After several years of inactivity and silence, the leader of the Ulster Unionist Party has spoken out regarding the status of Ulster in the Republic of Ireland. James Craig, reported by some to have grown senile in his elder years, appeared lively and in a good mood as he viciously attacked the Irish government in his first major address of such a kind since the ceasefire of 1925. He particularly chastised the current regime and the economic neglect paid towards Ulster during the past decade, and demanded that every son and daughter of Ulster be prepared to fight for the prosperity and, if needs be, freedom of the region."
ire.48.a:0 "He should have kept his mouth shut."

ire.49.t:0 "Belfast City Hall Bombing"
ire.49.d:0 "Terror awaited Belfast as the Belfast City Hall was subjected to a massive bombing that left over fifty people dead and many more injured. The shocking attack appears to be the latest in a long line of escalating UVF attacks, and was carried out during a meeting of local political representatives. Among those killed was Thomas Carlin, local party chief for the National Centre Party. This attack has frightened the nation, and the tension in Ulster has once again reared it's ugly head but this time with devastating consequences."
ire.49.a:0 "The times we live in."

ire.50.t:0 "Grand Opera House Fire"
ire.50.d:0 "Horror at the Grand Opera House in Belfast. Several hundred people had to be evacuated in the midst of the evening's entertainment when a massive fire broke out, consuming much of the historic hall. Thirty-five people are believed to have died in the disaster and the toll could soon rise, with many still reported missing as search efforts comb through the debris hoping to find any signs of life. It is unknown what caused the fire to break out but the government is already being criticised yet again by Ulster Unionists, who claim the incident could have been avoided had the Opera House been refurbished, as a previous request to the government had suggested."
ire.50.a:0 "What a disaster."

ire.51.t:0 "Bank of Ireland Robbery"
ire.51.d:0 "Today in Belfast, the Bank of Ireland was robbed by masked gunmen, believed to be unionist dissidents. The Gardaí are searching for them as we speak, but they are most likely taking refuge and being shielded within the Unionist community."
ire.51.a:0 "Let no man rest until these men are found!"

ire.52.t:0 "Dublin Bombing"
ire.52.d:0 "At 10:30am this morning, a massive explosion went off near the Four Courts in Dublin. Five hundred people are believed dead and many more could follow when an official death count is taken. Two men believed to have been responsible for the bombing were shot dead by the Gardaí as they attempted to flee the scene and put up resistance when asked to stand down. At least one of the men has been identified as a Belfast native with known Unionist ties. This terrifying escalation of the on-going conflict in Ulster is tantamount to a declaration of war upon Ireland and her people, and the public outcry has been enormous. The Irish people are baying for blood, and it is Ulster that may have to pay the price."
ire.52.a:0 "This can't go on."

ire.58.t:0 "Unionists Planning An Uprising?"
ire.58.d:0 "Now that we find ourselves in an unfortunate state of war, there has been an unusual amount of dissent pouring in from the north of Ireland. Ulster Unionists are said to be considering their options whilst the Irish Republican Army is preoccupied with the on-going conflict, and they very well may use this opportunity to try and break free from the Republic. The consequences of such an action could be grave for the nation, as they might very well attempt to align themselves with our enemies and would provide a perfect base for an invasion of Ireland."
ire.58.a:0 "As if we don't have enough problems as it is!"

However, now that hostile volunteer forces have joined the Republican forces, it would be fair to say that the civil war in Ireland is not necessarily developing to our advantage. If we were to invest anymore of our own military even as 'volunteers' then it could be seen as a direct act of war by our hostile neighbours in Europe and across the Atlantic.

ire.156.t:0 "The Union of Britain Requests Aid"
ire.156.d:0 "The Union of Britain has sent an official request to the foreign office of the French Commune. They have drawn our attention to the ongoing civil war in Ireland, and have requested we send our own volunteers to help the Ulster separatists, although many might question whether or not this cause really deserves French support, given the radically anti-socialist and Protestant fundamentalist nature of the Ulster rebels. Agreeing to the request would see Commune forces depart for Belfast and, unofficially of course, aid the Ulstermen in their fight for independence."
ire.156.a:0 "A true cause célèbre. We shall send aid if it means that the fires of revolution grow stronger."
ire.156.b:0 "Who cares about their pet reactionaries?"

# France says yes
ire.157.t:0 "The French Agree"
ire.157.d:0 "It would appear that the French Commune is acquiescent to our request for assistance in Ulster. A detachment of French 'volunteers' is on their way to Belfast and will very soon arrive on the front lines to help resist the Republican forces. Surely, this will be a turning point in the Irish-Ulster Civil War!"
ire.157.a:0 "Excellent."

# France says no
ire.159.t:0 "The French Decline"
ire.159.d:0 "Unfortunately, the French Commune does not consider the ongoing conflict in Ireland to be of any great significance or importance to the Internationale, and have expressed unease about the reactionary nature of the Ulstermen. It appears that, apart from our own volunteer forces, the Ulstermen are truly on their own against the superior numbers of the Irish army. Barring a full-on declaration of war, we have done as much as we can at this time."
ire.159.a:0 "That's the bloody French for you."

# Ulster receives troops

ire.158.t:0 "The French Commune sends aid!"
ire.158.d:0 "Apparently, we have more allies than we thought. At the coaxing of our English benefactors, the French Commune has agreed to send several divisions to our aid. The wind is at our backs now, we can surely overcome the Irish menace with the might of France behind us!"
ire.158.a:0 "No surrender!"

# Irish warning about French troops

ire.160.t:0 "French Troops in Belfast?"
ire.160.d:0 "A report from military intelligence in Belfast has delivered the startling news that troops from the French Commune, volunteers in name only, have been seen disembarking from transport ships in the Belfast City harbour. They were greeted by a delegation of British and Unionist military officials, making it quite clear that the French have sent troops to aid the Ulster cause. This is another clear attempt by the Union of Britain to steal Ireland back through a Unionist puppet. The conflict has escalated yet again, but the Irish people will not give up until the matter is put to rest, no matter how much French, English, or Unionist blood needs to be spilled."
ire.160.a:0 "This is our land. We will not let them take it from us."

# Ulster Victory
ire.161.t:0 "Freedom for Ulster!"
ire.161.d:0 "The brave men and women of Ulster heard the call of freedom, and they were ready to answer it with blood and power of arms. Through a hard fought struggle, we have beaten the Irish Republican Army and won the civil war. Our independence has been secured and the Republic of Ireland is soundly beaten. We can now set up our own provisional government and rule over Ulster in a fair and just manner, where Protestants will be put first always, and the cause of Unionism can be advanced in peace."
ire.161.a:0 "We've done it."

# GER/CAN/ENG/ Notifications if Ulster won
ire.162.t:0 "Ulster Victory!"
ire.162.d:0 "Unfortunately despite their brave efforts the Irish were defeated by the Ulstermen and their Syndicalist backers. This is bad news for Germany, and a victory for syndicalism over a key ally."
ire.162.a:0 "Verdammt!"
ire.163.t:0 "Ulster Victory!"
ire.163.d:0 "With the help of their syndicalist allies the Ulstermen managed to defeat the Irish government. Our support of the Irish has become a major embarrassment as many were sympathetic to the Unionist rebels."
ire.163.a:0 "Damn it!"
ire.164.t:0 "Ulster Victory!"
ire.164.d:0 "The Ulster rebels have been victorious, and we have successfully weakened Ireland! This will ease the task of liberating the island from Capitalist oppression."
ire.164.a:0 "All hail Britannia!"

#Easter Rising Anniversary
ire.55.t:0 "20th Anniversary of the 1916 Easter Rising!"
ire.55.d:0 "On Monday, the 24th of April 1916, members of the Irish Volunteers, Irish Citizen Army and Cumann na mBan seized key locations in Dublin and declared a free Irish republic. Surrounded by the vastly superior numbers and artillery of the British Army, they fought on for six days before eventually surrendering. Most of the leaders of the Rising were executed. Although a loss at the time, it would subsequently lead to Ireland's war of independence and freedom after seven hundred years under British rule. Today is the 20th anniversary, and celebrations and parades have taken place all across Ireland, including a thundering speech from President Collins emphasising the need to protect the freedom that Patrick Pearse and his comrades died for."

# Black Monday
ire.228.t:0 "Black Monday hits Ireland!"
ire.228.d:0 "On the 3rd of February, the German stock market collapsed, plunging the world into depression. Ireland has relied on trade with Germany and its sphere of influence since the British Revolution when we declared ourselves a republic and cut ties with the British Empire. The crisis has had a severe effect on the Irish economy as Germany and our other European trading partners have been hit by the crisis. Many scramble to find solutions, most parties proposing either Irish economic development or maintaining stability while the German economy recovers. More radically the anglophile National Centre Party advocate abandoning trade with continental Europe and opening ties with the Entente, often making speeches tinged with anti-German rhetoric. The syndicalists have also begun to advocate revolution, claiming that this crisis is proof of the failures of capitalism."
ire.228.a:0 "This could be bad..."
ire.229.t:0 "German economy improves"
ire.229.d:0 "The German government has begun to reform their economy to cope with Black Monday. With their economy improving, trade between our two nations has begun to resume, helping return our economy back to normal."
ire.229.a:0 "That's good at least..."
ire.230.t:0 "German economy recovers"
ire.230.d:0 "Germany's economy has finally recovered from Black Monday allowing trade between Ireland and Germany to fully recommence."

ire.231.d:0 "The outbreak of war in Ireland has helped our economy to recover from Black Monday."
ire.231.a:0 "At least there's one benefit..."
ire.232.t:0 "Trade with the Entente"
ire.232.d:0 "Now that we have opened relations with the Entente our economy has greatly improved from trade with the British Empire. Perhaps the National Centre Party were right all along."
ire.232.a:0 "Great!"
ire.233.t:0 "Trade with the British"
ire.233.d:0 "Now that we have opened trade relations with the Union of Britain our economy has begun to improve from trade with what was once our biggest trading partner."
ire.233.a:0 "Great!"
ire.234.t:0 "End of Black Monday!"
ire.234.d:0 "Now that Ireland is finally free from capitalist oppression the reforming of our economy has eliminated the effects of Black Monday, the ultimate proof of capitalist failure."
ire.234.a:0 "Great!"
ire.235.t:0 "End of Black Monday!"
ire.235.d:0 "Now that our dream of making Ireland self-sufficient has become a reality our economy is no longer dependent on foreign trade, ending the effects of Black Monday!"
ire.235.a:0 "Great!"
ire.236.t:0 "Trade with the USA"
ire.236.d:0 "Despite America's unstable situation, our opening of trade has helped to improve our economy."
ire.236.a:0 "Great!"
ire.237.t:0 "America and the Economy"
ire.237.d:0 "With America stabilised and Ireland in a close friendship with them, our trade relations have become stronger and our economy has improved as a result."
ire.237.a:0 "Great!"
ire.238.t:0 "Ireland and the Reichspakt"
ire.238.d:0 "While trade relations have been strong between Ireland and Germany since Irish independence, Ireland still remained somewhat outside of the Reichspakt economy, preferring to stay neutral. With Ireland now having closer ties to the Reichspakt the Irish economy has benefitted."
ire.238.a:0 "Great!"
ire.239.t:0 "Black Monday ends!"
ire.239.d:0 "Afer a long time and owing to the economic and diplomatic actions of our government, the Irish economy has finally recovered from Black Monday!"
ire.239.a:0 "At last!"
ire.240.t:0 "Black Monday ends!"
