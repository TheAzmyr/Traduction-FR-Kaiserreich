 cend.1.d.NIC_socialist: "As we have managed to survive through the storm of American occupation and Central American crisis, we are a highly desired ally among revolutionaries within Central America.

It is time this shackle is thrown off once and for all!"
 cend.5.d.liberal: "The Revolutionary Front, founded by [From.GetNameDefCap] is meant to be a pact to organise the men of Central America against those who would oppress them. The liberals who have betrayed us so many times in the past, the military dictators who have hurt us, and the foreign oppressors who support them. It is time this shackle is thrown off once and for all!"
 cend.5.d.military: "The Revolutionary Front, founded by [From.GetNameDefCap] is meant to be a pact to organise the men of Central America against those who would oppress them.

 cend.6.d.liberal: "[From.GetNameDefCap] has founded the Liberal Pact! it is designed to bring together the liberal countries of Central America to resist the evil growth of military dictatorships and socialist revolutionaries.

 cend.6.c: "You can't beat military democracy!"

 cend.7.t: "Formation of the People's Vanguard"
 cend.7.d.socialist: "The crooked dictatorship of [From.GetNameDefCap] has formed the People's Vanguard. They seek to insulate themselves from revolution by working together with other dictatorships! We will not allow this. We must prevent their coalition from taking shape and we must work hard to prevent them from ending the revolution in Central America. If they get what they want, all our work may be for nothing!"
 cend.7.d.liberal: "Because robbing their own people of their freedom is not enough, [From.GetNameDefCap] has formed the People's Vanguard. It is aimed to protect themselves from any outside challenge to their rule. We know that such an illiberal pact will soon fail, but we must make sure they do not permanently smother the torch of liberty in the rest of Central America. We must do everything we can to prevent them from attacking our democracy!"
 cend.7.d.military: "[From.GetNameDefCap] has founded the People's Vanguard! Just like us, they prefer a stronger type of government and for that reason, there are many who are jealous and seek to topple our governments.

Together we will be stronger than alone and together we will be able to defend our shared values and our democracy. Together we can protect what is ours from the military dictators and socialist revolutionaries who wish to take it from us."
 cend.8.d.military: "Our friends in [From.GetNameDefCap] have joined the People's Vanguard. We no longer stand alone in our struggle to contain the revolution in Central America.

 cend.8.b: "The torch of liberty stands strong."

 cend.9.b: "[CEN_petition_refuse_option]"

 cend.9.d.socialist: "We have been petitioned to join the Revolutionary Front, the pact founded by [From.GetNameDefCap]! They have asked us to join them in their revolutionary struggle to help rally the men and women of Central America to truly liberate us all. They say that we can only resist our oppressors together. If we are united in this pact, we now we have to decide whether or not their struggle is also ours."

 CEN_petition_refuse_socialist: "Victory will have to be sought after on their own."

 cend.9.d.liberal: "[From.GetNameDefCap] has asked us to join the Liberal Pact. Its stated aim is to further liberalism and democracy in Central America.

 CEN_petition_refuse_liberal: "Liberty belongs in one country, not many."

 cend.9.d.military: "We have been petitioned by [From.GetNameDefCap] to join the People's Vanguard.

Hail to our new brothers and sisters!"
 cend.10.d.liberal: "[From.GetNameDefCap] has accepted our request to join the Liberal Pact. They have made an excellent decision, as together we can create a lasting impact on our corner of the world and safeguard democracy for generations to come! United, we will make sure that the torch of liberty will not be extinguished. We will protect them and they will protect us."
 cend.10.d.military: "[From.GetNameDefCap] has made a wise decision and have heeded our petition. By doing this, we will make sure that together we will fight against the liberals and socialists who seek to topple our rightfully installed regimes.

 cend.10.a: "Together for victory!"
 cend.10.b: "We'll come out on top."

 cend.11.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Refuses"
 cend.11.d.socialist: "The cowards of [From.GetNameDefCap] have denied our petition. Instead of joining our forces in order to empower the revolution, they have decided to deny us and go their own path, thus betraying our revolution. But our spirits are strong and even without the help of our fellow Central Americans, we can take a stand against our oppressors. We will not let their refusal to cooperate affect us."
 cend.11.d.liberal: "[From.GetNameDefCap] has refused our petition! This is unfortunate, as we cannot be sure that freedom will remain in their country. They are vulnerable to the opportunists of this world and we do not have their support in our own struggles to come. But we are not weak, we have the power to protect ourselves, even without them and we will not forget our goals of preserving and spreading democracy!"
 cend.11.d.military: "[From.GetNameDefCap] has made a mistake by refusing to join the People's Vanguard. They and they alone will feel the consequences as we will stand strong in the People's Vanguard to keep the revolution at bay. Without them we still have the strength of our people to resist those who seek to topple our governments. We will not give up."
