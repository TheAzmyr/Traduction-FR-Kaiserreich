### Ideas ###
 #Starting Ideas
 PRF_disorder_in_council:9 "Disorder-In-Council"
 PRF_disorder_in_council_desc:9 "Initially forming during the Indian Revolution, the Council of Princes was envisioned as a way for the major rulers of south India to collectively rule the newly independent nation. As the years have gone on however, the uniquely privileged position occupied by the Nizam within the Council has slowly led the nation towards one led solely by Osman. Such a situation is one the other council members have refused to take sitting down, and now only time will tell if the council will survive much longer."

 #Economic Ideas
 PRF_black_monday:9 "Aftershocks of Black Monday"
 PRF_black_monday_desc:9 "While increased reliance on German markets was a necessity to survive in a post Imperial world, the Black Monday collapse has as a result inflicted great damage on the Indian economy, like it has much of the world."
 PRF_federal_railways:9 "Federal Railway Company"
 PRF_federal_railways_desc:9 "Historically the railways in India have been divided between a wide assortment of owners, ranging from foreign capital to even Osman Ali Khan himself. In an attempt to improve this system, these disparate railways have all been placed under the authority of one central Federal enterprise."
 PRF_growth_of_indigenous_business_idea:9 "Growth of Indigenous Business"
 PRF_growth_of_indigenous_business_idea_desc:9 "As argued by leading businessmen in [PRF.GetNameDef], if the nation is to survive into the modern age it must facilitate the growth of indigenously owned companies rather than tying itself so heavily to foreign imports as it has been historically. To that end, the government of [PRF.GetNameDef] have greatly invested in native companies, hoping to build a self sustaining economy."

 #Armed Forces Ideas
 PRF_new_federal_army_idea:9 "The New Federal Army"
 PRF_new_federal_army_idea_desc:9 "The first Federal Army of the [PRF.GetName] could hardly be described as a professional force, having been hastily assembled together in the chaotic years of the Indian Revolution. Aiming to address the shortcomings this has caused, the [PRF_GetCountryTitle]'s government has set out grand reforms to fully reorganise it into a force capable of defeating any enemy of the Indian people."

 PRF_the_first_federal_navy:9 "The First Federal Navy"
 PRF_the_first_federal_navy_desc:9 "While [PRF.GetNameDef] has always had a few ships to its name, it could hardly be described as a navy, being more just whatever could be salvaged from Britain's collapse. Such a situation could not last for long however, especially as the [PRF_GetCountryTitle] begins to stretch out its wings, and so their government has begun to fund the creation of a proper navy to serve the nation."
 PRF_divert_funding_to_the_navy_idea:9 "Diverting Funds to the Navy"
 PRF_divert_funding_to_the_navy_idea_desc:9 "In an effort to massively increase its naval output, the [PRF.GetNameDef] has chosen to cut back on funding of less important ventures, with the saved funds being redirected to the nation's navy."

 PRF_deccan_air_school_idea:9 "The Deccan Air School"
 PRF_deccan_air_school_idea_desc:9 "The Deccan Air School is Hyderbad's leading pilot school. With government investment, we will have the best pilots in the subcontinent."

 #Osman Ideas
 PRF_father_of_the_federation_idea:0 "Père de la Fédération"
 PRF_father_of_the_federation_idea_desc:9 "While Osman may now be the sole ruler of the Indian Federation, the Nizam has shunned any symbolic elevations of status, instead opting to reinforce his image as the Federation's founder. Despite in practice having powers akin to a national monarch, the Nizam has set out to paint himself as simply a \"first among equals\" whose benevolent rule shall lead India to greatness."
 PRF_rule_by_firman_idea:9 "Rule by Firman"
 PRF_rule_by_firman_idea_desc:9 "When Osman was simply the Nizam of Hyderabad, little happened within his realm without a direct decree from him endorsing it. Now as the subcontinent's mighty emperor, such administration has been expanded to the whole Indian nation; with local ministers and councils being expected to carry out his will expressed via firman as swiftly as possible."
 PRF_one_nation_under_osman_idea:9 "One Nation Under Osman"
 PRF_one_nation_under_osman_idea_desc:9 "While Osman may be a Muslim, he has made clear that he does not intend to rule the nation as a conqueror, imposing his beliefs onto others and disadvantaging those of other faiths. While not everyone in the nation is convinced by such promises, his great purge of the Razakars has gone a long way in reassuring people of his intentions."
 PRF_right_of_conquest_idea:9 "Right of Conquest"
 PRF_right_of_conquest_idea_desc:9 "As expressed by Razakar leader Qasim Razvi, Osman's right to rule India has derived solely from his conquest of its peoples, and no concessions should be granted to the vanquished. With Osman granting the Razakars unchecked levels of power to ensure his rule stays uncontested, those amongst the \"vanquished\" who wish to oppose such domination find themselves quickly on the receiving end of the Razakar's violence."
 PRF_fight_against_famine:9 "Fight Against Famine"
 PRF_fight_against_famine_desc:9 "For millennia famine has been one of the greatest threats to the Indian people, killing more than any conqueror. With recent decades seeing great advances in the world of artificial nitrogen fertilizers, the elimination of famine is in sight, and to that end Osman has chosen to massively fund these efforts so that this great evil will never threaten India's people ever again."
 PRF_royal_sadaqah_idea:9 "Royal Sadaqah"
 PRF_royal_sadaqah_idea_desc:9 "Osman's authoritative rule is not one that the Indian people are so easily willing to accept, but being the richest man in the world has its advantages, even if spending a single rupee pains him. To help ensure that Osman maintains the support of as many of his subjects as possible, he has ramped up his personal spending on many great projects across the realm for the benefit of the little people of the nation, of course naming these projects after himself to remind the people of their great benefactor."
 PRF_the_charitable_miser:9 "The Charitable Miser"
 PRF_the_charitable_miser_desc:9 "$PRF_royal_sadaqah_idea_desc$"

 #Princes Ideas
 PRF_image_of_rajarshi_idea:9 "Image of the Rajarshi"
 PRF_image_of_rajarshi_idea_desc:9 "The Rajarshis, or Royal Sages, are those amongst the Hindu ruling castes who truly display pure devotion and care for their people, always choosing to enrich the nation over themselves. While not directly referring to themselves as such, the leadership of the Council of Princes have begun to unofficially encouraged the promotion of the image of each of them being Rajarshis, nobly leading the nation forward and giving everything they have to benefit the lower castes that they rightfully rule over."
 PRF_new_supreme_council_idea:9 "The Supreme Council of India"
 PRF_new_supreme_council_idea_desc:9 "During the days of the East India Company, the Supreme Council of Bengal acted as India's highest authority, being comprised of four primary members, with a fifth position being fulfilled by the governor general as effective head of the Council, although notably lacking a veto power over decisions. Now over a century later, a similar such system has arisen again, ruled however now by the native rulers of the subcontinent rather than colonial leaders. It is through this new \"Supreme Council\" that the true will of the Indian people is expressed; at least according to those leading it."
 PRF_royal_patronage_fund_idea:9 "Royal Patronage Fund"
 PRF_royal_patronage_fund_idea_desc:9 "It is right for the wealthy to give back to society, and with the princes of the Federation now acting very much in unison a collective fund has been set up to allow each prince to donate towards a common goal. This fund is then spent upon infrastructure and development throughout the nation, attributed collectively to each prince, ensuring that every Indian recognises the vital role that every prince plays in uplifting the nation, rather than simply highlighting the richest amongst them."
 PRF_wall_street_of_asia:9 "Wall Street of Asia"
 PRF_wall_street_of_asia_desc:9 "The city of Madras has long been an important centre of finance in India, and now with a major government push to frame it as the \"Wall Street of Asia\" a great deal of foreign business has begun piling into the city, bringing significant economic benefits and connections for the nation."

 #Dem and Iyer Ideas
 PRF_cultivation_of_the_administration:9 "Cultivation of the Administration"
 PRF_cultivation_of_the_administration_desc:9 "With power being divided between the Council of Princes, the National Assembly, and even the parties within the Assembly, cultivating an effective and efficient administration is a seemingly impossible task. If there is anyone however who can successfully do so, it is the diwan Ramaswami Iyer, a man who so far has been extremely successful in navigating such a challenge."
 PRF_revitalising_the_council:9 "Revitalising the Council"
 PRF_revitalising_the_council_desc:9 "While historically the Council of Princes has kept voting rights solely to its royal members, a representative from Madras has always maintained an observer seat on the Council. Now in an attempt to revitalise the Council and bring the nation further towards modernity, Madras has been elevated to full status on the Council, at last giving further representation for the nation's common peoples."
 PRF_building_a_mass_movement:9 "Building a Mass Movement"
 PRF_building_a_mass_movement_desc:9 "The Andhra Mahasabha may have been little more than a regional pressure group just a few short years ago, but now as the party leading the nation the new Mahasabha has taken great strides to include those from all of India, ensuring that it truly represents the nation's masses."
 PRF_the_new_federation_dem:9 "A New Federation"
 PRF_the_new_federation_dem_desc:9 "Indian democracy may not be as developed as it is in other great nations of the world, but under the leadership of the All-India Mahasabha the Federation has taken great strides towards having a truly democratic system that represents all of the nation's people; a far cry from the princely controlled state of yesteryear."
 PRF_the_new_federation_iyer:9 "A New Federation"
 PRF_the_new_federation_iyer_desc:9 "Indian democracy may not be as developed as it is in other great nations of the world, but under the leadership of Iyer the Federation has taken great strides towards embracing modernity and uplifting those throughout the country. While the diwan's authority may be growing uncomfortably large for some people, most remain confident that Iyer has the best intentions in mind for India's peoples."
 PRF_the_sovereign_statesman_idea:9 "The Sovereign Statesman"
 PRF_the_sovereign_statesman_idea_desc:9 "Despite the Council of Princes maintaining a great deal of authority and power on paper, the nation's diwan C.P Ramaswami Iyer has ensured through his reforms that the true ruler of the nation is Iyer himself, with neither the Council nor the Assembly being able to challenge his position. While Iyer's power may now be effectively absolute, he has remained steadfast in his goal of bringing his vision to the nation rather than simply enriching himself, believing that he alone can truly modernise the nation and lead India forward as a new great power."
 PRF_defending_the_downtrodden:9 "Defending the Downtrodden"
 PRF_defending_the_downtrodden_desc:9 "For almost as long as people have existed in India there has always been a downtrodden group amongst them, whether they be Dalits, women, ethnic or religious minorities. Such oppression is regarded as a relic of the past by the Federation's government, who have made it their mission to ensure that these downtrodden groups are protected and uplifted, so that they may play an equal part in society."

 #Modifiers
 PRF_madras_autonomy_modifier:9 "Madras Autonomy"
 PRF_madras_autonomy_modifier_desc:9 "Following agreements reached between the newly formed All-India Federation and the Madras Legislative Council during the Indian Revolution, the former British presidency joined the federation as a distinct member. Under these agreements, the State of Madras has continued to operate much as it did under British rule, being in the unusual position within the Federation of functioning as a democratically elected republic rather than being ruled by an absolute or executive monarchy like its fellow states.\n\nAdditionally under the agreements, matters concerning Madras itself have been almost entirely devolved to its Legislative Council, and a representative chosen by its members sits on the Council of Princes, ostensibly to ensure that Madras maintains a say on national laws that may also affect them."

 PRF_southern_autonomy_modifier:9 "Southern Autonomy"
 PRF_southern_autonomy_modifier_desc:9 "As part of the reunification agreement between the Dominion and the Federation, the south of the nation has been allowed a great deal of autonomy to manage its own affairs while recognising the government in [RAJ.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]."

 #Decisions

 PRF_industrialising_the_nation_category:9 "Industrialising the Nation"

 PRF_begin_the_rajasthan_canal:9 "Begin the Rajasthan Canal"
 PRF_begin_the_rajasthan_canal_desc:9 "The Rajasthan region has long been in need of a proper irrigation system, and an interesting proposal by Bikaner's chief engineer, Kanwar Sain, has been approved by the Diwan. Under this proposal work will begin taking water from the Harike Barrage, fed by many major Himalayan Rivers, and directing it with a canal to supply most of western Rajasthan. While this will likely take decades to finish in full, it is certainly a project worth investing in for, and even the short term benefits can be fruitful."
 PRF_malwa_canal_network:9 "Malwa Canal Network"
 PRF_malwa_canal_network_desc:9 "The drought prone region of Malwa in central India has long been in need of more canals, and luck would have it that the Narmada running through the area would be perfect for this purpose. Work will begin shortly on a network of canals along the river, and from other smaller nearby bodies of water, to help stave off the worst effects of any drought."
 PRF_expand_doab_irrigration_channels:9 "Expand Doab Irrigration Channels"
 PRF_expand_doab_irrigration_channels_desc:9 "The Upper Doab in northern India is one of the most important regions for food production in the entire nation, producing not only most of the nation's wheat but also rivalling Bengal for rice production. Aiding farmers in the region through a mass expansion of irrigation channels will almost certainly bring the region's output to even greater heights."

 PRF_dig_in_digboi:9 "Dig in Digboi"
 PRF_dig_in_digboi_desc:9 "Digboi, as the legend goes, was named as such when Canadian engineer W.L Lake told his men to 'Dig boy dig!' upon seeing the first signs of oil. Despite the oil being first discovered almost a century ago now, the well has seemingly been barely tapped, and so we should make a great effort at resolving this mistake to capitalise further off this black gold."
 PRF_orissa_bauxite_extraction:9 "Orissa Bauxite Extraction"
 PRF_orissa_bauxite_extraction_desc:9 "Orissa is home to some of the richest bauxite reserves in all of Asia, yet little has been done to harvest and process this increasingly valuable material. Still, there is no time like the present to get to work, and so expanding our mining infrastructure in the region should be a priority."
 PRF_hematite_in_bailadila:9 "Hematite in Bailadila"
 PRF_hematite_in_bailadila_desc:9 "Two things seem certain in life, the first being death, and the second being man's constant demand for more iron. The Bailadila mountain range is home to rather high quality hematite ore, which should help towards filling this great demand."
 PRF_bridging_the_teesta:9 "Bridging the Teesta"
 PRF_bridging_the_teesta_desc:9 "The regions of Darjeeling and Sikkim have many disconnected communities separated from each other by the mighty gorges formed by the Teesta river. While there have historically been plans to properly bridge the river, they have historically fallen to the wayside due to the revolution and its consequences. Now however seems like a perfect opportunity to revive these plans."
 PRF_rebuilding_the_dufferin_bridge:9 "Rebuilding the Dufferin Bridge"
 PRF_rebuilding_the_dufferin_bridge_desc:9 "The Dufferin Bridge of the Ganges was at one point one of the greatest bridges in India, but was mostly destroyed as part of the Battle for Varanasi. The bridge's importance to the local city means that we cannot simply allow it to remain destroyed, and so a great effort should be made to see it return to full operational capacity."
 PRF_paving_baluchistan:9 "Paving Baluchistan"
 PRF_paving_baluchistan_desc:9 "The frontier regions of Baluchistan may be little more than a backwater as far as most are concerned, but they are still an important part of the nation that should be uplifted along with the rest of it. To that end, we should seek to build a proper modern road network in the region, allowing easy travel to and from major nearby cities like Karachi and Quetta, and also travel within the region between Kalat and Kharan."
 PRF_expand_the_sukkur_barrage:9 "Expand the Sukkur Barrage"
 PRF_expand_the_sukkur_barrage_desc:9 "The Sukkur Barrage provides irrigation to farmers in the arid region of Sind, supplying water from the Indus to regions that otherwise get very little. Reinforcing its installations and expanding its associated canals will provide local farmers quite a bit of relief."
 PRF_the_pallivasal_hydro_electric_project:9 "The Pallivasal Hydro-Electric Project"
 PRF_the_pallivasal_hydro_electric_project_desc:9 "The Pallivasal Hydro-Electric Project is a proposal for a hydro-electric plant that will increase the electrical output in the state of Travancore, as well as providing new opportunities for irrigation in the region. By accepting and moving forward with this installation, the region will see greatly increased development."
 PRF_subsidise_the_chakhao_plantations:9 "Subsidise the Chakhao Plantations"
 PRF_subsidise_the_chakhao_plantations_desc:9 "Chakhao, also referred to as Manipuri Black Rice, is a highly nutritious rice plant grown in the region of Manipur. It's vibrant purple colorisation additionally makes it an exotic food for importing nations abroad. A generous series of subsidies should see the region attain great prosperity."
 PRF_uplift_delhi_to_modern_standards:9 "Uplifting Delhi to Modern Standards"
 PRF_uplift_delhi_to_modern_standards_desc:9 "The site of the former Sultanate of Delhi, the former capital of the British Raj and perhaps the most coveted city for any conqueror wishing to attain control of the vast Indian continent. Socialist rule has done the city absolutely no good, however. Many streets are cramped, Indians packed like sardines into poorly constructed apartments and slums popping up just after another has been cleared. Through thorough public works projects, Delhi shall finally claim its spot as the city of the century."
 PRF_invest_in_jubbulpore_armaments:9 "Invest in the Jubbulpore Armaments Industry"
 PRF_invest_in_jubbulpore_armaments_desc:9 "The city of Jubbulpore has a considerable armaments industry that received heavy damage during the civil war. By directing some capital toward this sector, we shall be rewarded with a stronger arms industry than we had beforehand."
 PRF_karachi_shipyard_project:9 "The Karachi Shipyard Project"
 PRF_karachi_shipyard_project_desc:9 "The Port of Karachi has had a most turbulent history in recent times, enduring a strike during the initial aftershock of Black Monday and straining to meet demand as the former Dominion's sole major harbor. A series of enhancements and upgrades will remedy any issue it may have in the future with regards to capacity, and further improve our domestic ship-building industry."
 PRF_fund_kashmiri_carpet_exports:9 "Fund Kashmiri Carpet Exports"
 PRF_fund_kashmiri_carpet_exports_desc:9 "Kashmiri Carpets are coveted by the world's wealthy and elite for their intricate beauty and exceptional quality of craftsmanship. We will fund an advertisement campaign and subsidise local carpet weavers so that our great nation will benefit from the income of this luxurious export."

 PRF_issue_executive_firman:9 "Issue Executive Firman"
 PRF_issue_executive_firman_desc:9 "While most laws go through the Council, the Nizam still retains the authority to bypass them when needed, and passing a firman that will help ensures things develop to his advantage is certainly a situation he views warrants it."
 PRF_rely_on_the_razakars:9 "Rely on the Razakars"
 PRF_rely_on_the_razakars_desc:9 "The Razakars may be dangerous violent thugs, but they are the Nizam's dangerous violent thugs, and will ensure that those who speak ill of him in public are reminded why such actions are normally done behind closed doors."
 PRF_buying_good_will:9 "Buying Good Will"
 PRF_buying_good_will_desc:9 "It is the duty of those with wealth and power to ensure that their lessers are properly cared for, and the Big Four are certainly no strangers to providing such care. In turn, it is expected that those provided for will be much more amenable to supporting the goals of their benefactors."
 PRF_combatting_the_nizams_propaganda:9 "Combatting the Nizam's Propaganda"
 PRF_combatting_the_nizams_propaganda_desc:9 "As the so called \"Father of the Federation\", the Nizam has put in significant work at building a national legend around himself, ranging from simple mundane rumours of his good deeds, to claims that he himself led the charge to stop the socialists crossing the Godavari. With a little work, such extraordinary claims can easily be dismantled as the blatant lies that they are."
 PRF_concessions_to_the_assemblies:9 "Concessions to the Assemblies"
 PRF_concessions_to_the_assemblies_desc:9 "While most bills that make their way through the Council are drafted by the advisors of the members, or developed initially in the Chamber, on certain occasions the advisory assemblies in each constituent state are allowed to submit their own bills through their relevant prince. If needed, allowing some additional bills from the assemblies could strengthen the sway of these assemblies over the lawmaking process, helping balance the situation in the Council."

### Focuses ###

 #Economic focuses
 PRF_the_berar_road:9 "The Berar Road"
 PRF_the_berar_road_desc:9 "With every passing day making it clear that war will soon return to India, preparations must immediately begin for this eventuality. In the event of an attack from the north, Berar is almost certain to become the most active part of the frontline, being the least defendable section of the border, and so we must guarantee a proper supply network between Hyderbad and the Berar front if we wish for any hope of holding the area."
 PRF_merging_the_railways:9 "Merging the Railways"
 PRF_merging_the_railways_desc:9 "Despite the vital role the nation's railways serve, there still remains no central authority overseeing them all. Instead, control lays split between private companies, foreign ownership, and many of the princes themselves. To properly streamline this mess, it would be wise to merge these disparate companies together, operating through the existing administration of the Nizam's Guaranteed State Railway."
 PRF_hyderabad_madras_express:9 "Hyderabad-Madras Express"
 PRF_hyderabad_madras_express_desc:9 "Madras is the third most important city in south India, behind only Bombay and Hyderabad itself, yet the connections between the [PRF_GetCountryTitle]'s heart and Madras have for too long remained woefully lacking. Now is the perfect time to finally address this problem, and create a proper direct line between the two."
 PRF_bombay_to_bangalore:9 "Bombay to Bangalore"
 PRF_bombay_to_bangalore_desc:9 "Bangalore acts as an important hub for connecting the far south to the rest of the nation, with many of the raw materials produced in these areas being routed through it to reach the industrial heartland of Bombay. An expansion of the rail infrastructure between the two should greatly aid any future industrial expansion."
 PRF_importing_european_models:9 "Importing European Models"
 PRF_importing_european_models_desc:9 "We cannot easily afford to dedicate any substantial amount of our heavy industry towards the production of modern diesel and electric trains entirely from scratch, but acquiring them would be a major boon for the nation. To remedy this, we should see to importing a sizable number of models from Europe, alongside acquiring difficult to produce parts from which we can more easily put together trains of our own."
 PRF_finish_the_nizam_sagar_dam:9 "Finish the Nizam Sagar Dam"
 PRF_finish_the_nizam_sagar_dam_desc:9 "While the Nizam Sagar Dam was started many years ago, the project was never able to reach full completion as a result of the Revolution. With the dam in an almost finished state already, it would be foolish to not simply dedicate the resources needed to give it the final push over the edge towards being complete, especially when considering the great electrical and irrigational benefits from it that we sorely need."
 PRF_shroff_development_plan:9 "Shroff Development Plan"
 PRF_shroff_development_plan_desc:9 "Responding to the Black Monday crisis, a team of economists and industrialists led by Ardeshir Shroff have put together a development plan to ensure swift recovery from this temporary economic shock. The plan in itself advocates for stronger intervention in favour of Indian business, the importation of new crop variants to attempt to ensure better harvests, and the increased involvement of native companies in the exploitation of our many untapped resources."
 PRF_hope_wheat_trials:9 "Hope Wheat Trials"
 PRF_hope_wheat_trials_desc:9 "The fear that we are one bad season away from major famine and the amount of time that has to be devoted to farming to simply sustain the nation are two of the biggest issues facing the [PRF_GetCountryTitle]'s potential for growth, especially in the wheat reliant west. In an attempt to remedy both of these problems, we have agreed to trial new crop breeds originating in the Americas which are said to be resistant to common diseases like rust, while greatly increasing yield."
 PRF_andhra_irrigation_schemes:9 "Andhra Irrigation Schemes"
 PRF_andhra_irrigation_schemes_desc:9 "The region of Andhra is one of the most important rice producing areas of the entire subcontinent, and we have yet to get anywhere near the limits of the potential yield we can achieve. With enough investment in improving the irrigation infrastructure in the region we can expand the viable farmland, as well as allow further rice production during the Rabi season."
 PRF_prioritise_indigenous_business:9 "Donner la priorité aux entreprises autochtones"
 PRF_prioritise_indigenous_business_desc:9 "In a completely free system, many native Indian businesses will simply fail to compare to their much more firmly established foreign competition. To avoid the nation once again being ruled by foreign business, we must guarantee economic protections so that our own businesses can thrive long enough to compete against these foreign heavyweights."
 PRF_favouring_a_private_approach:9 "Favouring a Private Approach"
 PRF_favouring_a_private_approach_desc:9 "While we may guarantee protections for Indian businesses, we cannot risk simply abandoning the fundamentals of capitalism lest we risk becoming a second Calcutta. It is therefore important to ensure that where possible we favour and foster private business, instead of resorting to increased nationalisation as some have called for."
 PRF_increased_federal_intervention:9 "Increased Federal Intervention"
 PRF_increased_federal_intervention_desc:9 "There are certain areas of the economy where no matter how hard private businesses try, they will never be more effective than the government at providing important services. We should therefore move towards nationalisation where needed in these key areas, to ensure the most effective utilisation of national resources."

 PRF_exploiting_the_chandradrona_deposits_desc:9 "The Chandradrona mountain range is a rich, and mostly untapped, source of iron ore, something that the nation is in desperate need of. Proper exploitation of these deposits and the expansion of steel processing facilities to accommodate should be one of our most important economic priorities."
 PRF_strengthen_madrasi_heavy_industry:9 "Strengthen Madrasi Heavy Industry"
 PRF_strengthen_madrasi_heavy_industry_desc:9 "Despite Bombay being south India's industrial heartland, Madras's importance in this field cannot be understated. With enough government support, the industry throughout the entire Madras region can easily get to a position where it could rival, and perhaps even overtake Bombay, and such a scenario would greatly benefit the nation."

 PRF_phasing_out_british_equipment_desc:9 "The nation is not going to survive further conflicts armed with just old rifles from Ishapore and whatever the Bombay garrison left behind. It is therefore vital that we begin producing new rifles of our own, with whatever we can muster."
 PRF_developing_the_poona_officers_academy:9 "Developing the Poona Officers' Academy"
 PRF_developing_the_poona_officers_academy_desc:9 "The Indian nation has long been starved of good native officers, a very intentional policy from the British in their failed attempt to prevent a repeat of 1857; something that obviously worked so well for them. To rectify this dearth, an academy was set up a few years ago in Poona to train more officers, and we should help ensure this academy is developed as much as possible."
 PRF_streamlining_the_command_structure:9 "Steamlining the Command Structure"
 PRF_streamlining_the_command_structure_desc:9 "The initial iteration of the Federal Army was hastily thrown together in the chaotic days of the revolution, made up from the personal armies of the princely states, British defectors, and anyone willing to take up arms against the socialists. While there has been a slow effort to untangle the jumbled mess of units in the past few years, we must accelerate these efforts to stay competitive."
 PRF_the_new_federal_army:9 "The New Federal Army"
 PRF_the_new_federal_army_desc:9 "While our reform efforts may only just be beginning, for the first time in our short history the Federal Army is now actually worthy of such a name; no longer being a ragtag enthusiastic force of soldiers. Hopefully when the time comes, it will be enough to not only defend the nation, but restore it to greatness."
 PRF_negotiating_equipment_deliveries:9 "Negotiating Equipment Deliveries"
 PRF_negotiating_equipment_deliveries_desc:9 "Winning over the friendship of an Indian nation that does not simply follow the orders of the British king or Calcutta's new red kings in London is a very attractive prospect to many of the major powers of the world. Such interest is something we can easily exploit to fill the many holes that still remain in our army's stockpiles."
 PRF_support_the_bangalore_defence_industry:9 "Support the Bangalore Defence Industry"
 PRF_support_the_bangalore_defence_industry_desc:9 "Almost as soon as the revolution ended, Maharaja Wadiyar IV began a major campaign to build a new defence industry in Bangalore's old British Cantonment. Such an effort is one that is sure to bear great fruit for the [PRF_GetCountryTitle], and we should divert federal funding to aid Mysore in furthering these efforts for the sake of national security."
 PRF_updating_shivajis_tactics:9 "Updating Shivaji's Tactics"
 PRF_updating_shivajis_tactics_desc:9 "The first Maratha realm was carved out by the great Maharaja Shivaji, who recognised that a large advanced army is not needed to win wars when one truly understands the land around them, properly utilising a flexible irregular army. The tactics he pioneered can still hold true even in the modern age, except of course enhanced greatly by the technology of our era."
 PRF_prioritising_adaptability:9 "Prioritising Adaptability"
 PRF_prioritising_adaptability_desc:9 "We will not win against our enemies if we simply expect every battlefield to be in our favour.

 PRF_learn_from_the_battle_of_ahmadabad_desc:9 "Ahmadabad was nothing short of a disaster, one in which many good men were slain by the socialist marauders in a valiant last stand in the city. The mistakes made that led to such a slaughter cannot be repeated, and next time our soldiers end up fighting in the streets they will be ready."
 PRF_a_new_generation_of_armoured_cars:9 "A New Generation of Armoured Cars"
 PRF_a_new_generation_of_armoured_cars_desc:9 "British import restrictions meant that historically, many of our soldiers were stuck utilising armoured cars rather than the much more powerful tanks that they provided their loyal lapdogs. The experience this granted us however has taught that we should not underestimate the armoured car, for it has great use in supportive reconnaissance roles, and with the right tools can be produced much more cheaply than any decent tank, perfect for a flexible army such as ours."
 PRF_integrating_elephants_into_the_sappers:9 "Integrating Elephants into the Sappers"
 PRF_integrating_elephants_into_the_sappers_desc:9 "War elephants charging into the enemy line may be nothing but a historical relic, but it is a mistake to think that elephants cannot still serve an important purpose in a modern army. In terrain unsuitable for mechanised options, elephants excel as part of sapper corps, being perfect for building bridges across rough terrain and hauling large equipment where other options simply cannot."

 PRF_guerrillas_of_the_deccan_desc:9 "Ganimi Kava is the blueprint that many forms of asymmetric warfare have been based upon, a blueprint that was perfected in the great mountains of the Deccan we call home. Bringing this style of warfare once again to the Ghats, and even beyond, shall hopefully win us the victories we desire as it did for Shivaji."
 PRF_refine_mahadajis_legacy:9 "Refine Mahadaji's Legacy"
 PRF_refine_mahadajis_legacy_desc:9 "It was under Mahadaji Scindia that the rulers of southern India first realised that simply relying on courage and prowess will win you nothing but a flowery legacy told only by your subjugated sons. Unless we wish to befall such a fate, the army must not only be modernised to European standards, but hopefully one day even surpass them!"
 PRF_modernising_ayurveda:9 "Modernising Ayurveda"
 PRF_modernising_ayurveda_desc:9 "A sick soldier might as well be a dead one without the proper treatment, and for centuries Ayurveda has been used to ensure that they get back on their feet. In the modern day, the more mystical aspects of the system have slowly eroded away to create a new more scientific approach, and although many sceptics still believe it to be nothing more than pseudoscience it is hard to deny that it gets our soldiers back on their feet; even if it's just a placebo."
 PRF_refitting_the_lancers:9 "Refitting the Lancers"
 PRF_refitting_the_lancers_desc:9 "Our many units of lancers have long been the pride of the armies of all the south Indian states, yet without continued advancement this pride will quickly morph into nothing more than a relic. These men must be equipped with the latest guns, and artillery designed to match their great mobility, so that they can continue to be the swift hammer that crushes our foes."

 PRF_encouraging_native_innovation_desc:9 "'It's good enough' has for too long been the motto of many of our quartermasters, for it is always good enough until you face an enemy who outguns you while your weapon falls to pieces.

 PRF_reforming_the_deccan_invincibles_desc:9 "The Deccan Invincible were once a great elite force that won many a battle for the Marathas. In the present day such achievements are made by the specialist elite troops that punch well above their weight when needed, your marines, your mountaineers, and even your paratroopers. If we wish to emulate the successes of the Deccan Invincible, we should establish our own units of specialist troops to clinch victory."
 PRF_strengthening_the_gardi_core:9 "Strengthening the Gardi Core"
 PRF_strengthening_the_gardi_core_desc:9 "At the heart of any army is its core infantry line, for a glut of elites ready to crush the enemy's army is of little used if your lines fold before they get the chance to. Ensuring that even the lowest soldier is equipped and ready to fight as hard as he can will be the most vital step in creating a world class army for the Indian nation."
 PRF_growing_the_iisc:9 "Growing the IISc"
 PRF_growing_the_iisc_desc:9 "The Tata Institute, or more formally the Indian Institute of Science, is one of the most important research facilities in all of India, and furthering its growth is a cause that even the most argumentative of princes can easily get on the same page about doing. Ensuring that the [PRF_GetCountryTitle] remains at the forefront of science will not only help in every day life, but will aid in the development of cutting edge technology for our military, hopefully giving a great advantage."

 PRF_fate_of_the_loyalist_rulers_desc:9 "When Osman declared independence to save India from socialism, many cowardly princes in the north refused to rally behind him, being too scared to take a stand for their freedom. Those who were lucky enough to not be invaded during the revolution were able to keep their place under the British, and although they may have chosen to back our enemies, we must still consider whether they should be allowed to maintain their positions."

 PRF_restoring_the_ousted_princes_desc:9 "The Federation's members may have fought hard against the socialist marauders, yet it was not enough to save all of them. Many of their lands were overrun, and many a good man cut down; even the great house of Scindia were driven from their lands in Gwalior, having resided in Hyderabad ever since. It is time now to correct this injustice, and restore these lands back to their rightful rulers."
 PRF_federal_reorganisation:9 "Federal Reorganisation"
 PRF_federal_reorganisation_desc:9 "To think we can simply roll back the clock to a time before the revolution, restoring all the princely lands as they were then, is nothing short of a fantasy. Their people have been radicalised against them by the Calcutta regime, and forcefully installing the princes back would simply prime us for further unrest much further down the line. The lands should instead should be managed as federal states, reorganised as needed to incorporate them into the administration."

 PRF_armed_forces_rehabilitation_desc:9 "At the end of the day the common man rarely fights for his ideological convictions, have him born a few miles down the road and he'll just as easily fight under another banner. We therefore should grant blanket amnesty to the low ranking soldiers of our enemies, hopefully earning us some good will, and discuss what should be the fate of their more committed officers."
 PRF_reversing_socialist_destruction:9 "Reversing Socialist Destruction"
 PRF_reversing_socialist_destruction_desc:9 "The socialists of the north wreaked havoc wherever they managed to spread their tendrils, under false claims of liberating the Indian people from oppression.

 PRF_protecting_the_farmers:9 "Protecting the Farmers"
 PRF_protecting_the_farmers_desc:9 "Agriculture is the nation's backbone, one to which everything would crumple without, and yet the war has devastated countless fields and farms from mortar shells and tank treads.

 PRF_bridge_and_road_project:9 "The Bridge and Road Project"
 PRF_bridge_and_road_project_desc:9 "A town is nothing more than an isolated island if its people cannot easily leave it, and the state of the nation's roads at this point is nothing short of a catastrophe. With enough effort however, we may be able to once again reconnect much of the nation together, facilitating further growth and recovery."
 PRF_increasing_agricultural_exports:9 "Increasing Agricultural Exports"
 PRF_increasing_agricultural_exports_desc:9 "Without capital, many of the projects needed to restore the nation are little more than niceties, worth less than the paper they are written on. Even with the damages, agriculture remains our strongest export and so to gather the money needed to cover these grand projects we must up our exports in this field as much as we reasonably can."
 PRF_urban_restoration_projects:9 "Urban Restoration Projects"
 PRF_urban_restoration_projects_desc:9 "Nowhere was hit harder in the recent conflict than the country's great cities, even settlements like Nagpur are more rubble and graves than homes at this point.

 PRF_focus_on_capital_growth:9 "Focus on Capital Growth"
 PRF_focus_on_capital_growth_desc:9 "While simply recovering to the levels of yesteryear would greatly improve the lives of many of our people, it is foolish to believe that this alone will be enough to actually restore the nation.

 PRF_competitive_industry:9 "Competitive Industry"
 PRF_competitive_industry_desc:9 "Under British rule Indian industry was intentionally kneecapped to stop its true growth, with the overlords back in Britain fully aware that Indian industry could easily put every British factory out of business without these restrictions.

 PRF_tapping_indias_potential_desc:9 "The natural wealth of the earth has for centuries granted the opportunity to turn even the poorest pauper into the wealthiest prince if he can properly control and exact nature's bounty. Even with much of the country still devastated, great capital can still be raised through prioritising the extraction of raw resources like oil and iron, and selling them to the highest bidder, especially the desperate war ridden nations who have few other choices for suppliers."
 PRF_using_our_natural_wealth:9 "Using our Natural Wealth"
 PRF_using_our_natural_wealth_desc:9 "While the expansion of the many existing mines, quarries, and other such operations has so far served us well in quenching our resource thirst, it is not enough as many of these sites will quickly find themselves depleted. We must therefore begin developing new sites, those to which have great potential to output large amounts of resources if given the right time and attention. From these we can easily supplement our needs, and significantly increase our exports."

 PRF_appoint_a_national_diwan:9 "Appoint a National Diwan"
 PRF_appoint_a_national_diwan_desc:9 "While Osman may be the ultimate authority in the land, authority is meaningless if there is no one to ensure your will is carried out. A national Diwan will therefore be appointed directly by Osman, who will act as the primary enforcer of Osman's orders."

 PRF_establish_the_national_executive_council_desc:9 "As ruler of Hyderabad, Osman made the decision to establish an Executive Council to advise him on important matters and help ensure his will was carried out as effectively as it could be.

 PRF_the_sovereign_statesman_desc:9 "While the Nizam and the Big Four both see themselves as having won out in their conflict against the other, the only man who can actually be considered the winner is none other than Iyer, an outcome engineered from the beginning. The Nizam may think he has a useful puppet, and the princes may think they still call the shots, but in the end the only sovereign of the Federation is their \"dutiful\" Diwan."

 PRF_absorb_congress_remnants_desc:9 "The Indian National Congress was not truly a socialist organisation, it was just swept up in the winds of revolution and misled by some of its most vocal members. There are still countless people who share their values of an independent and free India, a nation that can support itself rather than being reliant upon others, and those people shall be granted a new home as part of the Mahasabha."

 PRF_linguistical_reorganisation_desc:9 "While we may be all Indians, we cannot forget that we are still Telegus, Bengalis, Tamils, and so much more.

 PRF_KR_gathering_storm_desc:9 "When rebellion swept across India, it struck great fear into many of the nation's princes, who believed that the rebels would oust them as they had the British. Viewing the Raj as entirely shattered, they would declare their own independence as the \"All-India Federation\" under the leadership of Osman Ali Khan, colloquially known as the Princely Federation. Despite initial setbacks, the Federation would survive until the ceasefire in 1927, and soon after enter a defensive pact with the new Dominion. The Federation's survival still however remains in a state of flux, with opposition against Osman's authoritarian rule growing stronger every day."

 PRF_country_intro_content:9 "L'Inde a finalement obtenu son indépendance de facto au lendemain de la révolution britannique de 1925, lorsque le Raj s'est effondré sur lui-même. Le maharaja rajput de Bikaner, Ganga Singh, a pris les rênes du pays. Son style autoritaire dans la gestion du nouveau dominion indien libéré l'a rapidement mis en porte-à-faux avec l'opposition civile de gauche, centrée sur le Congrès national indien et ses militants clandestins.\n\nEn quelques mois, la dénonciation par le CNI du traité anglo-indien négocié par Singh a conduit le sous-continent à la guerre civile. C'est au cours de cette période chaotique que les États princiers du sud, invoquant le traité anglo-indien et les nombreuses transgressions juridiques de Ganga Singh comme motivation, s'unissent derrière Osman Ali Khan, le Nizam d'Hyderabad, et le déclarent le véritable vice-roi du dominion indien.\n\nAlors que la guerre civile se transformait en un bourbier de violence, Ali Khan ne parvint pas à envahir la base de pouvoir septentrionale de Singh, mais réussit à déraciner les enclaves socialistes de Bombay et empêcha les gouvernements de Lahore et de Calcutta d'envahir le plateau du Deccan.\n\nLorsque la paix est enfin revenue, la Fédération princière s'est rapidement attelée à l'organisation d'un véritable gouvernement nationaliste succédant au Raj, Osman Ali Khan occupant le poste de Nizam-al-Mulk (administrateur du royaume) et ses collègues princes jouant un rôle consultatif et législatif au sein de ce que l'on appelle le Conseil des princes. En 1936, la Fédération princière est un État fragile, mais le plus proche d'un gouvernement autochtone conservateur."

 prf.1.d:9 "Aujourd'hui, le glorieux Osman Ali Khan, administrateur du royaume et du Nizam d'Hyderabad, célèbre le 25e anniversaire de son ascension au trône de son État princier ancestral. La bannière dorée d'Asafia orne les rues des nombreuses villes de l'État d'Hyderabad et la population se délecte des excès de fonds publics canalisés dans les festivités. Déjà l'un des États les plus riches et les plus industrialisés de la Fédération princière, aujourd'hui Hyderabad brille vraiment comme un modèle à suivre pour les autres princes."
 prf.1.a:9 "Difficile de dire si la Fédération survivra à une autre décennie si cela continue..."

 prf.2.t:9 "Convocation du Conseil"
 prf.2.d:9 "Les vacances d'hiver étant terminées et les membres du Conseil étant arrivés à Hyderabad en toute sécurité, les premiers jours de cette session ont jusqu'à présent été étonnamment calmes, malgré la forte tension qui régnait dans l'air.\n\n Si les questions abordées au cours de ces premiers jours n'ont guère été controversées, le Nizam n'a pas encore saisi l'occasion d'opposer son veto à l'une d'entre elles, et les discussions ont généralement progressé à un rythme soutenu. Dans tout Hyderabad, il semble que beaucoup aient commencé à écarter les rumeurs des semaines précédentes, même s'il est peut-être trop tôt pour le dire..."
 prf.2.a:9 "C'est un bon début, je suppose."

 prf.3.t:9 "La proposition du Diwan national"
 prf.3.d:9 "L'un des dirigeants hindous les plus puissants (et les plus riches) de la nation, Krishna Raja Wadiyar IV, est décédé tard hier soir dans son palais royal de Mysore. Son neveu, Jaya Chamarajendra, un homme corpulent et artistique, lui succède à la tête de l'État de Mysore."
 prf.3.a:9 "Survivre à une année supplémentaire, sans parler d'une décennie, commence à sembler généreux à ce stade."

 prf.4.t:9 "Le projet d'État princier du Maharashtra"
 prf.4.d:9 "Lorsque le Raj britannique est tombé, la présidence de Bombay a été dissoute et ses districts de Maratha divisés entre Hyderabad, Kolhapur et d'autres États princiers. Un nouvel État de Bombay a alors été créé pour gérer la ville portuaire vitale sur la mer d'Arabie, directement sous le contrôle de l'exécutif. Cependant, des voix se sont élevées pour réclamer un nouvel État princier Maratha, grand et unitaire, avec les mêmes droits que Hyderabad, Mysore et Travancore-Cochin au sein du Conseil des princes. Le soi-disant État du Maharashtra aurait une taille et une capacité industrielle imposantes, mais serait dirigé par un collège des différents petits princes Maratha à l'unisson. Au sein des États princiers plus grands et plus anciens, il existe une forte opposition à la création d'un nouvel État fédéral puissant qui pourrait aller à l'encontre des intérêts de l'ordre établi. Cependant, un Maharashtra fort signifierait une administration plus efficace et un accès plus facile pour l'armée fédérale. Le Marathi sera-t-il élevé au rang de nation ?"
 prf.4.a:9 "C'est fait ! Proclamez le Maharashtra État fédéral uni !"

 prf.5.t:9 "La cinquième Andra Mahasabha"
 prf.5.d:9 "L'Andra Mahasabha était une organisation populaire initialement fondée au début des années 1920 pour favoriser l'utilisation de la langue Telugu par rapport à la prévalence de l'Urdu dans l'État d'Hyderabad. Cependant, au cours de ses quatre dernières conférences, le mouvement s'est déplacé plus à gauche en développant des objectifs politiques concrets pour faire respecter l'éducation obligatoire, les droits des travailleurs et des paysans ainsi qu'une démocratisation progressive de la Fédération princière. Actuellement sous la direction du grand intellectuel libéral Madapati Hanumantha Rao, l'Andra Mahasabha est néanmoins fortement divisée entre son cadre dirigeant de la bourgeoisie et la masse des travailleurs et des paysans de gauche et syndicalistes qui constituent sa principale source de soutien. Pourtant, malgré ces différences, le mouvement vient de tenir son cinquième congrès et y a présenté une proposition de réforme constitutionnelle assez radicale et très anti-féodale. En conséquence, il y a eu beaucoup de bouleversements dans les cercles les plus conservateurs du Conseil des Princes avec les maharadjahs et les zamindars les plus réactionnaires qui ont demandé l'interdiction du mouvement. Comment l'exécutif devrait-il réagir ?"
 prf.5.a:9 "Engagez une répression contre ces démagogues libéraux !"

 prf.6.d:9 "Plus d'un an s'est écoulé depuis que l'État de Travancore-Cochin a appliqué une série de lois progressistes pour améliorer le sort des castes hindoues déprimées, également appelées intouchables, avarnas ou dalits. Considérées comme les plus basses des basses castes hindoues, les personnes nées intouchables ont toujours mené une existence misérable, rejetées par leurs supérieurs et forcées à accepter un travail dégradant. Cependant, la proclamation d'entrée au temple de Travancore-Cochin a considérablement réduit la souffrance des avarnas de l'État et leur a donné un nouveau sentiment de fierté communautaire. Ainsi, Shri Chithira Thirunal Balarama Varma a maintenant proposé au gouvernement fédéral de faire de l'amélioration des castes opprimées une question nationale. L'opposition des princes hindous, réactionnaires et conservateurs, reste cependant farouche."

Envahis à la fin de la première guerre civile indienne par des troupes princières, les Tamouls se sont vu gracieusement accorder l'autonomie - restant en dehors de la Fédération au prix de concessions territoriales. Cependant, le radicalisme dravidien s'est imposé dans toute la République et de nombreux officiers de l'armée nationale n'osent pas laisser sans contrôle une puissance aussi ouvertement hostile alors que les traîtres et les bolcheviks restent forts à Lahore et à Calcutta. Il faut faire quelque chose au sujet de l'État tamoul !"

 prf.13.t:9 "Push to Reform the Chamber of Princes"
 prf.13.d:9 "Originally founded by the British to allow the voices of Indian princes to be heard, the Chamber of Princes has remained rather unchanged in its continued form in the Federation, save for words going to the Council rather than the Viceroy. While on occasion proposals find their way up from the Chamber to the Council, officially introduced by one of the Council members, the Chamber has so far remained little more than a forum for grievances to be heard. Today's proposal, sponsored by Rajaram III, aims to change that, through giving the Chamber an advisory role in the law making process. As part of this, proposals would be first submitted to the Chamber for review before they reach the Council at all, with the princes of the Chamber providing feedback and requesting changes where needed. The proposal would then be returned to the Council member, at which point they could choose to revise it further and resubmit it to the Chamber, or submit it directly to the Council.\n\nAs expected, the Nizam has made quite clear his opposition to the idea, and in spite of his restraint in recent months he has at least signalled that he may simply move to veto the proposal outright as he has done so many times before. So far the only thing that has stopped him acting is the advice of his trusted advisor Akbar Hydari, who has instead proposed to Osman that he back the proposal, arguing that it ultimately gives little power to the Chamber but with his backing he could easily frame it as a major gift to the princes. Such a gift would of course greatly improve the Nizam's standing amongst the lesser members of the Federation, something that may prove useful in the event of him needing allies against the Big Four, while vetoing it may drive people into their hands instead. Whether Osman chooses to listen to this advice is anyone's guess."

 prf.13.b:9 "These jumped up zamindars will ask for the Nizam's own palaces next at this rate!"

 prf.14.t:9 "Temple Entry Proclamation"
 prf.14.d:9 "While caste permeates all aspects of Hindu life within the Federation, how the law chooses to interact with it has always been a devolved issue for every state to handle in their own way. In the Kingdom of Travancore, under the rule of Senior Maharani and Regent Sethu Lakshmi Bayi, this manifested as a strong opposition by the government when it came to any legal protections for Dalits and a rigid enforcement of the taboo on sea travel. Bayi's rule as regent was however highly controversial, owing to both her authoritarianism and her original disputed appointment by the British, and when Chithira Thirunal came of age he immediately set out to reverse many of her policies.\n\nIt is no surprise then that today, a new proclamation has been given by the Maharaja, promoted to the wider public by his Diwan Chetput Pattabhiraman Ramaswami Iyer. Within this proclamation the young Maharaja has declared that \"none of his Hindu subjects shall be denied the peace and comfort of the Hindu faith by reason of his birth, caste, or community.\", and by extension that none of his subjects shall ever be denied the right to enter or worship at temples within Travancore. While this proclamation has already caused controversy amongst some of the nation's elites, especially with the Raja of neighbouring Cochin, it has on the whole been very well received, with other states now beginning to consider whether they too should make a similar move.\n\nIn Hyderbad however, the reaction from Osman has been rather different, with the Nizam caring little about the details of how Hindus wish to police each other. Instead, his eye has been drawn to Iyer, the man who many have regarded as the power behind the throne since the Maharaja's ascendency to the role. Despite struggles in the rest of the Federation, Travancore under Iyer has disproportionally flourished, and although Osman has previously been aware of the man, his mind now cannot help but wonder if Iyer is the solution he needs."
 prf.14.a:9 "The Nizam could use a man like this Iyer..."

 prf.15.t:9 "A Meeting with Iyer"
 prf.15.d:9 "Unable to get the thought out of his head, the Nizam recently issued a private request to Iyer, requesting a meeting with him in Hyderabad. Upon Iyer's arrival, Osman immediately began to lay out the details of his conflict with the Big Four, something that Iyer had already intimately familiarised himself with. Coming prepared, within moments of the Nizam requesting his aid in resolving the conflict Iyer began to present a plan of his own. Making clear that the Big Four will never back down as long as the Nizam's power remains unchecked, Iyer instead suggested that there are ways to place checks upon the Nizam without further empowering the rest of the Council. To do this, his plan suggests that instead of having a member of the Council serve as national Diwan, an elected national assembly should be established from which Osman would appoint a Diwan to carry out most of the Federation's daily operations.\n\nIyer also made clear that while this plan would of course limit the Nizam's power, it would limit the power of his rivals even more so as Osman would still maintain authority over who he chooses to appoint as Diwan, as well as the ability to veto laws passed by the assembly. While the Nizam was not initially convinced of this idea, his ears began to perk up at this explanation. His opinion was further cemented when Iyer explained that he knows for certain from his relationship with Varma that the Big Four will be placated by such a scenario, as it would both in their eyes limit the Nizam and strengthen their own position, as they have begun to privately worry how long the Federation can last without democratisation. While not going as far to immediately commit to the idea as presented, it is clear that the Nizam has been won over by Iyer's arguments, and that he will certainly keep this plan in mind if the time comes."
 prf.15.a:9 "Iyer's proposal should certainly be considered."
 prf.15.b:9 "Such a plan hardly seems needed but it shall be kept in mind."

 prf.16.t:9 "Razvi and the Razakars"
 prf.16.d:9 "Despite the exact details of the Nizam's meeting with Iyer not being shared with a single soul except the two men present, it did not take long for some to correctly guess that the Nizam was seeking aid to resolve the crisis in the Council. One of those who managed to do so is Qasim Razvi, a general in the Federal army as well as leader of the Razakar paramilitaries, a radical group linked to the Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen, who trace their origins to defensive militias formed during the revolution. Using his position in the army, he was able to quickly arrange a meeting with the Nizam under the guise of official business, and it is from here that he too began to present his plan on how to resolve the conflict with the Big Four.\n\nIn stark contrast to the tactful and subtle approach championed by Iyer, Razvi once again echoed the calls by Bahadur Khan to dissolve the Council of Princes, and for Osman to assert his rule over the Federation. His arguments stressed his belief that it is the Nizam's right as a great Muslim ruler to be the sole leader of the Federation. In his opinion, continued cooperation with the Hindu princes of the Council will leave the Federation too weak to fend off invasion from the Republic, who will hand all of Hyderabad over to \"Hindu rabble.\"\n\nWhile the Nizam remained unconvinced of the viability of this plan, Razvi gave his promise that if the call is given, he and his Razakars will immediately spring into action to defend the Nizam, and that while Khan has not yet approved any action, when the time comes he will too throw his weight behind Osman."

 prf.17.a:9 "It seems that the conflict may finally see its climax."

 prf.18.t:9 "The Jubilee Coup"
 prf.18.d:9 "Intending to begin the Durbar with a bang, through ordering the Razakars to seize the Big Four and begin his dismantling of the Council, Osman was rather surprised when the armed men who burst into his office had their guns aimed at him rather than the princes accompanying them. Having caught wind of Osman's plan, troops loyal to the Big Four had arrested Razvi and his loyalists almost immediately upon the Nizam issuing the order to them. They then began their march to the King Kothi Palace, bringing things back up to the present.\n\nNot even giving Osman the chance to speak, Sayajirao Gaekwad made clear that they had caught the Nizam in his plotting, and that they would not tolerate his attempted self coup. Informing Osman of Razvi's arrest, and falsely claiming that they had further support from their allies in the Dominion as well as the German Empire if he refused to comply, they began laying out what exactly would happen next.\n\nOsman would soon after be forced to sign into law a revised version of the National Diwan proposal, completely stripping Osman of all his powers within the Federation, although still willing to grant him the symbolic concession of his ceremonial leadership role in order to maintain national stability. He was then informed that instead of announcing the dissolution of the Council at the Durbar, his big announcement would be the implementation of this law and the immediate preparations for an election under it."
 prf.18.a:9 "Thus ends the ambitions of Osman..."

 prf.19.t:9 "The Jubilee Coup"
 prf.19.d:9 "Having finally been given the opportunity to rid himself of the turbulent princes once and for all, the Nizam last night issued the order to Razvi to seize the Big Four, who were on their way to Hyderabad to take part in the upcoming Durbar. Being brought to Osman in the early hours of the morning under armed guard, the Nizam laid out in simple terms to them that he would be disbanding the Council, and that all four of them would be standing with him in support as he announces it at the upcoming durbar. Such a bold statement prompted immediately angry outbursts from the princes, although a quick punch to Varma's stomach by a Razakar quickly put them into their place.\n\nDemanding to know what will happen to them, even if they surrender to Osman's threats, they were informed that he does not wish to see them come to any further harm, and that they will simply be allowed to continue ruling their own states within the Federation for as long as they submit to Osman's leadership. Making clear that the Razakars would be posted in their states to ensure compliance with these \"reasonable\" demands, the Big Four soon realised that they had no other choice left but to comply."

 prf.20.t:9 "Le pari du Nizam"
 prf.20.d:9 "Les rumeurs de complot du Nizam ayant rendu beaucoup de gens nerveux, en particulier les quatre grands, leur invitation à rencontrer Osman à Hyderabad avant le début du durbar les a laissés inquiets de ce que cela impliquerait. À leur grande surprise, lorsqu'ils arrivent ensemble dans le bureau d'Osman, ils sont accueillis non seulement par le Nizam, mais aussi par des représentants de l'Andhra Mahasabha, du Parti de la justice, et même par Iyer lui-même. Une fois toutes ces personnes réunies, le Nizam fait signe à Iyer de commencer à exposer les plans d'un Diwan national démocratiquement élu, en remplacement du concept initialement suggéré par les "Big Four". Le choc d'une telle déclaration a immédiatement laissé tous les invités abasourdis, personne ne sachant comment réagir à la fois à l'idée elle-même et à l'idée que le Nizam soit prêt à céder une partie de son pouvoir aussi volontairement.\n\nDemandant une pause pour composer leurs pensées en privé, les quatre Grands en profitent pour discuter entre eux de l'idée présentée. Bien qu'ils aient d'abord cru qu'il s'agissait d'un coup bas d'Osman, l'intervention d'Iyer leur a laissé entendre que cette proposition était peut-être sincère et que, même si elle ne leur conférait pas le niveau de pouvoir qu'ils souhaitaient initialement, son acceptation répondrait à la plupart de leurs préoccupations immédiates concernant les abus d'Osman. Après avoir accepté la proposition, l'assemblée se réunit à nouveau et le Nizam leur annonce directement son intention de proclamer ce changement dans le cadre du durbar et de programmer des élections dans les semaines qui suivent. Si tous les participants, à l'exception d'Iyer, quittent la réunion avec le sentiment que ce compromis est trop beau pour être vrai, ils sont au moins rassurés par le fait que, pour l'instant, le conflit a été résolu sans violence."

It was here that he would announce that a revised version of the National Diwan proposal had been both accepted and signed by him, and it would be effectively immediately from its announcement in this speech, with the full text of the law set to be published publicly as soon as possible.\n\nHe further announced that in six weeks time, an election would be held amongst the members of the Chamber of Princes to decide who would be the first National Diwan, declaring that both Wadiyar and Varna have put themselves forward as candidates for the position. His lack of enthusiasm and stilted delivery was quickly noticed, and although many simply brushed it off as a one off incident, Osman's quick departure from the stage upon finishing the speech has left many wondering what truly happened behind closed doors to make him change his mind."

It was here that he would announce that after much deliberation, the Council of Princes would be dissolved, effective immediately, and that at least for the time being the Nizam would rule by himself with the aid of trusted advisors.\n\nShocked gasps from the crowd were quickly drowned out by cheers, seemingly originating from a large group of men dispersed through the crowd, to whom the Big Four had become intimately familiar with a few days ago. Departing from the stage to great shouts of Ya Osman and praises to Allah, the Nizam remained confident that his new reign was now safely cemented for as long as the Federation would endure."

It was here that he would announce that after a meeting with the Council and the Federation's largest political parties, an agreement had been reached to establish a national legislature, based upon the one in Madras, from whom a national Diwan would be selected to serve as the head of government for the Federation.\n\nWith the crowd immediately erupting into great cheers, there was quite a long pause before Osman was able to continue with his speech. After enough time he was able to further declare that the first election would be held in six weeks time, with seat allocations being published within the following days, and already provided to the major parties of the Federation.

While these results are generally in line with expectations, what it means for the selection of Diwan is currently not clear.\n\nThe Mahasabha's leader Madapati Hanumantha Rao seems like the obvious candidate, as his party did win the most seats, although their lack of a majority and their radical proposals have made the Nizam reluctant to give them power. Instead the Nizam has seemingly begun to consider the appointment of Iyer to the position instead, with Iyer having resigned as Travancore's Diwan to represent the Kingdom on a national level. If Iyer would be appointed, he would be expected to lead a non-partisan national government made up of multiple parties including the Mahasabha, hopefully keeping the most radical ideas at bay. Still such an action may be regarded as another overreach by the Nizam, and it may be simplest for him to let the radicals burn themselves out dealing with the realities of politics once Rao is appointed."

Alternatively, while it may be a tough pill to swallow, it may be more prudent to integrate them as is into the current administration, adding them as members of the Federation and Chamber members.

To that end, he has reviewed over the potential candidates, and narrowed his final choice down to two men.\n\nThe first is Akbar Hydari, one of the [PRF_GetOsmanTitle]'s closest advisors, and a man Osman was already considering to appoint as the Diwan for just Hyderabad itself. The second is Mirza Ismail, a candidate who has much weaker ties to the [PRF_GetOsmanTitle] than Hydari, but one who has repeatedly proven his skill, having served most of the nation's major states at one point or another.

Even before Delhi was reclaimed by the Federal Army, Osman's grand desire to usurp the imperial mantle back from the British was so discussed it could hardly even be considered an open secret, instead it was simply public knowledge. Within days of the Dominion's surrender, he had already ordered an elaborate coronation to be held in Delhi, followed shortly by a proclamation which declared the formation of a new empire.\n\nThe start of the ceremonies began with Osman being transported through Delhi. The streets of the grand city were filled to the brim with large crowds made up of everyone ranging from the most ardent of the Nizam's supporters, to those there simply for the food, and even Osman's biggest detractors wishing to report on his arrogance. His destination being a large stage set up in front of the Red Fort, owing to damage sustained to the building itself making it unsuitable for the ceremony. Upon this platform sat potentially the grandest of the extravagances, a recreation of the Mughal Peacock Throne, where Osman would sit to be crowned as the new emperor.\n\nThe actual coronation itself was handled rather quickly, due to fears that the hastily assembled stage would not be able to hold all the weight upon it for long, and within a few minutes Osman stepped down to another platform to give a speech, aiming to further reinforce his image as the liberator of India. Not long after, he returned to his carriage, travelling back the way he came, returning home not as the Nizam, but as the grand Kaisar-i-Hind."

Speaking to large crowd, filled with both the natives of the city, and those from all across the Federation who made the journey to [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] to hear him speak, Osman would declare his commitment to restoring the nation to greatness.\n\nHarkening back to his vital role in the Federation's foundation, and the almost mythicised Battle of the Godavari, he made clear that from the beginning no one has been as committed to the Federation as he has been. Rejecting any claims to the throne, he chose to again reinforce his image as the grand \"Father of the Federation\", declaring further that his only two desires in life are to serve the Indian people, and to serve Allah, and that taking the imperial title would serve neither.\n\nSuch a speech was well received, especially by those who believed that Osman's consolidation of power would spell the death of the Federation. Many however quickly took note that the speech gave little reassurance that Osman would not rule as though he was emperor, with no mention of any plans to replace or reform the Council of Princes, nor end his \"temporary\" unchecked rule over the nation. To these people, while Osman may have for now rejected the title, it remains clear that the Federation is still nothing more than the Nizam's domain, for him to rule solely as he sees fit."

According to a speech given by Razvi, the justification for this action is alleged treason, with him stating that the Diwan was planning on ousting Osman and restoring the dissolved Council of Princes to full power, and that they cannot allow such a surrender to happen.\n\nFor Osman himself, news of this coup first reached him upon waking up to armed Razakars storming his bedroom, followed an hour later by Razvi himself arriving to explain the situation. After enough arguing, and enough 'persuasion' from the Razakars, an agreement was reached which declared Razvi the new Diwan, granting him unchecked powers to root out any further alleged treason throughout the nation.

This new party has been primarily formed by remnants of the Congress Nationalist Party, an organisation to whom many of the INC's anti-socialist members defected to as the leadership began to openly embrace that foul ideology of the west and its promoters in Paris and London.\n\nLed by the CNP's founder Madan Mohan Malaviya, the BDA has quickly seen an outreach of support throughout large swathes of India, especially in parts of the Punjab and Sind. Despite being primarily a conservative party, they have seen quite a few defections from the rump Liberal Party, with whom there is much common ground on issues of Hinduism and support for the middle classes. While they have yet to win any seats, owing to no elections being held yet in the north, it seems very likely that this party is destined to become the primary rival of the Mahasabha for the foreseeable future."
 prf.301.a:9 "A strong opposition is always healthy"

 prf.302.t:9 "Elections in the Liberated Lands"
 prf.302.d:9 "It has roughly been a year since the nation was at last reunified, and great strides have been made to properly reabsorb all of the reclaimed lands, no matter how corrupted they had become from the years under their oppressive regimes. It is through these efforts that elections have finally been able to be held in the reclaimed lands, at last allowing them representation alongside the previously elected officials from the former core of the Federation.\n\nThe results that have arrived in so far have made clear that the current governance will likely not be disrupted, as the AIM have continued to perform well across the board, although they have once again only achieved a plurality of seats rather than extending their position to a full majority. As expected the BDA have also done rather well for themselves, although perhaps not the monumental heights that many were expecting, with many seats they chose to contest instead being won by independents.\n\nA rather notable set of results however have been those from Bengal, where it seems the grip of socialism has not yet been properly rooted out. Two parties, both claiming succession from the INC, have won an alarming number of seats in the region, and although they have expressed their allegiance to the Federation, few trust their words. By and large however, the election has generally gone off without a hitch, potentially signalling that India's worst years are now firmly behind it."
 prf.302.a:9 "Ensure these new radicals are properly monitored, just to be safe"

 prf.303.t:9 "The Man from Madras"
 prf.303.d:9 "Madras's inclusion in the Federation, alongside the special status it was granted owing to its republican nature, was always a controversial choice. As part of the compromise that even allowed it to happen in the first place, Madras was not granted an equal place on the Council that its size and power would naturally entail, instead the local government was only allowed to send an observer to advocate for the state but not vote in its favour. Today however, this has at last changed, with the Council finally agreeing to elevate Madras to full membership, granting it equal rights to everyone except Osman.\n\nQuite a few favours had to be called in by the Diwan in order to secure this radical change to the status quo, with the Big Four especially being reluctant to consider empowering someone who is not one of their own, although with enough promises they were won over in the end. The Nizam on the other hand was won over rather easily, as to him further breaking up the Big Four's traditional power block could only improve the situation for him, although he is under no illusions that the representative chosen will likely not see eye to eye with him on most issues.\n\nAs for the man chosen to be Madras's first full representative on the Council, it should come as no surprise that their local government has once again recommended Subbarayan. Having served in the previous role for quite a few years now, especially during the crisis in the Council, and being regarded as a neutral candidate not likely to be swept up into party politics, his reappointment was practically routine. Now sitting as a full member, it is through him that the common people's voices will at last have a place on the great Council of the realm, allowing the nation to take another step forward into modernity."
 prf.303.a:9 "Hopefully Subbarayan can keep both sides in check."

 prf.304.t:9 "The Andhra Pradesh Problem"
 prf.304.d:9 "Ever since the AIM were just the Andhra Mahasabha, uniting the Telegu people under one state within the federation has been arguably their primary goal. Even now in power, such a goal has been difficult to achieve, as the Telegu homelands are currently split between Madras and the Nizam's personal domain. The recent move to elevate Madras to a full council member has however won over their support in this issue, with their tentative agreement to hand over Andhra to be part of a future Telegu state. As with many things however, the final roadblock has once again come down to convincing the Nizam.\n\nWhile the Nizam may have lost a significant amount of his powers to the Diwan, as the head of state for one of the Federation's members he still retains complete authority over his state, and there is no option but to get his approval for any changes to it. One potential idea to get around this would be to annex Andhra into Hyderabad, with the Telegu territories within Hyderabad becoming an autonomy with Telegu as their official language. Such an expansion of Hyderabad would almost certainly be blocked by the other members of the Council however, who it would still have to go through.\n\nAs an attempted compromise, a different plan has been presented to merge Andhra into Hyderabad, while splitting off Berar and the other non-Telegu speaking parts of Hyderabad as a new state, headed by his son Moazzam Jah or another relative of the Nizam. This plan seems to be on much more solid ground, as private discussions with the other members of the Council has confirmed that they won't oppose it, even if some don't like the idea in general. The final decision however is of course down to the Nizam, and until the plan is presented to him it is impossible to know whether he will accept giving up land in this way."
 prf.304.a:9 "After some consideration, Osman agrees to the proposal."
 prf.304.b:9 "The Nizam refuses to give into such an extreme demand"

 prf.305.t:9 "\"I am Your Slave, Master, I Bow At Your Feet\""
 prf.305.d:9 "For years now the complete abolishment of the Vettichakiri system of forced labour has been one of the AIM's primary goals, second only to their fervent advocacy for the Telegu language. Such practice has been present in southern India for centuries, carried out by the doras serving zamindars and princes, with the rule of those upholding the Vettichakiri system being notoriously harsh. While the more progressively minded princes, and even those on the conservative side, have so far been convinced to abolishing the practice, seeing the economic benefits of abandoning such a feudal system, the Nizam is anything but \"progressively minded\". It is extremely unlikely he'll ever agree to fully banning the practice in his lands, even if the Federal government attempts to crack down upon it.\n\nOne avenue that has been considered by Rao and the government to work around this is to ban the practice on a federal level, but to allow the Nizam specifically an exception, provided he ensures the worst excesses of the system are limited to the full extent of his ability. While not a concession the AIM is exactly willing to make lightly, it may be a needed compromise to wipe out the practice in the long term. Whether the Nizam will be willing to go even that far is still up in the air however."
 prf.305.a:9 "The Dora will be reined in, nothing more."
 prf.305.b:9 "How dare Rao make such an absurd demand!"

# prf.307.t: "A Master Builder at Work" #See event file

# prf.307.a: "The Nizam clearly picked the right man for the job"
#
# prf.308.t: "Reshaping the Constitution"
# prf.308.d: "TODO with the federation fully united and the new government kicking into gear, Iyer has laid out his plans to reexamine the constitution, arguing that the existing one was quickly thrown together in the chaos of the nation's collapse and that now is the perfect time to better tailor it to a nation that is once again whole.\n\nWhile there is some who speculate that Iyer may be using this as an opportunity to cement his power, he has so far convinced everyone relevant that doing so will be for everyone's benefit."
# prf.308.a: "There is no doubt that Iyer has good intentions here."
#
# prf.309.t: "Winning Over the Courts"
# prf.309.d: "TODO For Iyer to make his constitutional changes, it must be approved by the courts, with the Supreme Court having the final say.\n\nFor Iyer however this is very easy to do, and after enough private meetings with the Justices the first round of Iyer's changes have passed through the court as swiftly as possible."
# prf.309.a: "The Diwan has the home field advantage in the courts."
#
# prf.310.t: "The Pawn's Checkmate"
# prf.310.d: "TODO Iyer's constitutional changes have been approved by the Assembly, the Supreme Court, and even the Council. While the majority of changes are those that few see little issue with, hidden between the lines are many specifics that weaken the power of the Council, such as mechanisms to overrule attempts by the Nizam to dismiss the Diwan, or the ability for the courts to overrule any veto by the Council. Finally while the dissolution of the Assembly may still be decided by the Nizam, he cannot do so without the agreement of the Diwan and cannot refuse a request by the Diwan to do so, ultimately transferring the power of elections over to Iyer.\n\nWhile Iyer has legally cemented his dominance over the Council, he is unlikely to ever need to apply said dominance as he has cemented his position in other ways so solidly. He has however guaranteed that no matter what, as long as he wishes to be in power, he will be in power."
# prf.310.a: "It has been Iyer's game all along."

 prf.348.t:9 "Whispers of Treason"
 prf.348.d:9 "To say that the Nizam is unpopular in the Federation at the moment would be like saying that the Russians were somewhat perturbed by Brest Litovsk. His repeated vetoes of core government policy, a government backed and elected by most of the nation's voters, has seen his carefully promoted image as the nation's saviour eroded away faster than land around the Teesta.\n\nAs a result of this growing unpopularity, socialist remnants have reorganised themselves around the rump Communist Party of India, creating a sizable force aimed at toppling the Nizam and bringing in the reforms he has spent so much time blocking. While normally this group wouldn't have much sway, and would simply just be crushed along with other dissidents, rumours have begun to spread of cooperation between the AIM and these rebels over their mutual anger against the Nizam.\n\nWith fears that Rao himself may soon throw his lot behind this potential insurgency, Razvi and his Razakars have offered to attempt to arrest Rao and eliminate these socialists, as soon as the order is given. Whether the Nizam wishes to go that far is still up in the air..."
 prf.348.a:9 "Rao should have never been trusted, order his arrest!"
 prf.348.b:9 "Taking action will only provoke things further, stay out of it."

 prf.349.t:9 "The Deccan Rebellion"
 prf.349.d:9 "While Rao may have privately expressed his anger at the Nizam's overreach, until news was leaked to him of his ordered arrest he had not even begun to consider insurrection. Almost immediately however, the Nizam's actions drove him directly into the arms of the rebels, with mutual contacts between the AIM and the CPI quickly instigating a rebellion with the backing of the government. With Osman's now abysmal popularity, few were willing to come to his aid, with much of the army siding with the government against him. The Razakars themselves were quickly shattered, although Razvi himself has yet to be accounted for.\n\nSeeing the writing on the wall, the Nizam and his family have reported fled via plane, although no one seems to yet know or agree exactly where. Meanwhile at home, Rao and his new allies were quick to seize upon this momentum to declare a republic, with Rao being sworn in as president and CPI leader P. Krishna Pillai as the new Diwan. The Council of Princes itself has also been dissolved, although negotiations between the Princes and the government have allowed the continued existence of their states as federal constituents, although with somewhat reduced authority than before.\n\nWhile things may have seemingly quickly stabilised with the fall of the Nizam, few can really say what the future holds for the new republic, and many of the princes still fear that their days are numbered if the communists gain enough leverage. For now though, most people are simply happy to be rid of the tyrant, rather than be distracted by future worries."
 prf.349.a:9 "The tyranny of Osman has been brought to an end!"

 prf.350.t:9 "Final Destruction of the Raj"
 prf.350.d:9 "With a grand proclamation issued by the Council, rubber stamped by the Nizam, every remaining territory within the Federation, barring Madras of course, is now once again in the hands of an Indian ruler. Whether it is the districts liberated from the socialists or the provinces absorbed from the Dominion, it has now been properly divided and given to their rightful owners. Even in Delhi, the great House of Babur have been restored to the throne, as recognition of the Mughal house's role in the original war of independence that unfortunately led to their ousting by Britain.\n\nAlmost immediately, the Council has moved to celebrate this day as a public holiday, honouring what they describe as the \"final destruction of the British Raj.\" For the first time in centuries, the nation has at last become truly free of outside domination, and at last it is free to emerge as the great power it was always destined to be."
 prf.350.a:9 "A return to the natural order of things."

 prf.351.t:9 "The Sundering of Madras"
 prf.351.d:9 "Allying with Madras was always controversial, with many wishing to see this failed remnant of British rule destroyed and replaced, rather than embraced as though it were an equal. It was however always seen as a necessary evil as long as the socialists were an active threat, much akin to the alliance that was similarly struck with the British Dominion. As too was the alliance with the Dominion discarded once the socialists were routed, so too must the alliance be with their Tamil scion.\n\nA new proclamation has been issued by the Council this morning to at last address this loose end. Arguing that their actions are necessary to finalise the nation's independence from Britain, the Council have ordered the Madras autonomy to be dissolved, with its lands set to be partitioned between the princes. The sole exception to this partition for now is the city of Madras itself for which a decision has not been made as to who shall receive it. Protests in Madras to this action have been quickly put down with Federal troops, and although the Madrasi government has strongly objected to this action, none have yet been brave enough to turn their words into actions."
 prf.351.a:9 "The error has at last been corrected."

 prf.352.t:9 "First session of the House of Princes"
 prf.352.d:9 "Following the passing of an act of Council, rubber stamped by Osman as is now the norm, what was once the Chamber of Princes has now been fully reformed into a proper legislative assembly. The new House of Princes was today inaugurated by the Diwan himself, with Osman sitting instead on the sidelines as it occurred. Being the first ever session, things of course began with a rather rocky start, as many of the princes were still struggling to understand what exactly the new situation would mean for them. Still, even if they did not yet truly understand it, the general mood in the House was rather positive, with many of the older members being happy to at last be part of an Indian nation that truly respects their role, unlike the bygone days of British rule."
