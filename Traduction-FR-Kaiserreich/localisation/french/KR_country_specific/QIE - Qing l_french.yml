 QIE_aisin_gioro_puyi_leader_desc:9 "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! February 7th, 1906, in Prince Chun Mansion, Beijing, Zhili Province, Qing Empire\n§YPolitical Career:§! 'His Imperial Majesty, the Son of Heaven, the Xuantong Emperor’ - while Puyi holds many titles, the young Emperor has little power and has never really possessed any since his birth in 1906. Deposed in the Xinhai Revolution at the age of 5, he was returned to the throne as a condition of the German intervention in China, a move detested by the general population. With day-to-day governance largely handled by the civil government in Beijing, he has spent the last decade idly sitting in the Forbidden City, occupying his days with tennis matches and calligraphy. But the Xuantong Emperor may secretly harbour ambitions to restore China and his dynasty to the greatness they enjoyed centuries ago..."
 QIE_aisin_gioro_puyi_manchu_leader_desc:9 "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! February 7th, 1906, in Prince Chun Mansion, Beijing, Zhili Province, Qing Empire\n§YPolitical Career:§! Restored following what has now been deemed the Manchu Restoration, Aisin-Gioro Puyi now sits at the helm of a government scrubbed clean of warlord influences. While some observers feared a return to traditional courtly intrigues, the new Qing government has opted to present a much more modern outlook. Puyi still lacks much power, but this is of calculated design. Fearing a tyrannical descendant of the same type that doomed his predecessors, the Emperor and legal scholars have drafted a constitutional structure of monarchy where Puyi exercises spiritual and patriotic power while only having an advisory role in legislation and day-to-day governing. While this new structure of government is untested, many in China and around the world are hoping Puyi can exemplify what it means to be a modern monarch."
 QIE_aisin_gioro_puyi_yiguandao_leader_desc:9 "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! February 7th, 1906, in Prince Chun Mansion, Beijing, Zhili Province, Qing Empire\n§YPolitical Career:§! While many around China and the world hoped that the so-called Manchu Restoration would restore some semblance of constitutional monarchy to China, the scheming machinations of Honoured Teacher Zhang Tianran have buried any and all aspirations for modern imperial rule. With religious devotees rapidly filling all governmental posts and seizing control of the military, Puyi has been pushed back into a position of irrelevance, now answering to the beck and call of a religious cult rather than a military clique. His role remains relatively unchanged from the days of Wu Peifu, only now with more obscure religious rituals and less military reviews. Puyi himself seems to not mind very much, having completely fallen under the sway of the teachings of Zhang and the Yiguandao."

 QIE_wu_peifu_leader_desc:9 "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! April 22nd, 1874, in Penglai, Shandong Province, Qing Empire\n§YPolitical Career:§! Narrowly escaping death at the hands of Puyi, Pujie, and the other Manchu noblemen who plotted to overthrow the Zhili Clique, Wu Peifu has now dropped any facade of Imperial rule over China. Naming himself ‘interim head of the nation’, he is now tasked with building a legitimate system of government for his country. A military man for his entire life, Wu is not expected to remain in power for long, and may soon transfer control of the country to a hand-picked successor."
 QIE_wu_peifu_commander_desc:9 "§YGeneral Description\nBorn:§! §gApril 22nd, 1874, in Penglai, Shandong Province, Qing Empire§!\n§YMilitary Career:§! §gBorn in Shandong to a merchant family, Wu entered the Baoding military academy and quickly rose through the ranks of the new Beiyang army. Following the collapse of the Republic of China in 1916 he aligned himself with Feng Guozhang’s Zhili Clique, and following Feng’s death in 1919 rose to dominate the clique. In 1928 he lead it to victory over its main rival, the Fengtian clique, despite being betrayed by his former ally Feng Yuxiang. During these turbulent years he was mentored by Cao Kun, former and future president of the National Assembly, who taught him the intriguing and scheming skills he used to seize control over the government. Although opposed to the reimposition of the Qing monarchy by Germany, Wu has quickly adapted the Zhili Clique to China’s new governmental structure, sidelining the monarchists and ensuring that he and his allies dominated nearly every facet of the state. A token opposition is allowed to exist, but Wu truly controls the government.§!\n\n§YNotes: Wu reportedly owns the world's largest diamond, but has refused to allow anyone to verify this claim. He was once renowned for hanging a photograph of George Washington behind his desk, but due to the ongoing political turmoil in the United States he has replaced this with a photograph of Bismarck. 'A great political thinker, just like Washington', Wu said to a visiting journalist, ignoring any questions about his relationship with Germany."

A political philosopher and intellectual, Hu Shih may seem like an odd choice for first president of the ‘Beijing Government of the Republic of China’. Yet the political philosophy he developed, ‘pragmatism’, was deeply influential to Wu Peifu during the years immediately following the restoration of the Qing, and the two frequently met in Hu’s office at Peking University, discussing how both men, former republicans, could and should dedicate themselves to the imperial project as the ‘least bad’ option for China. But with the aristocracy's treachery revealed, Wu has selected Hu to lead the new government, hoping that the philosopher’s writings and public persona can lend an air of legitimacy to a government seen by most as a sham and a front for the Zhili Clique."

He studied in Japan, returning in 1910 for a brief stint in governance before going abroad again, this time to Germany. He served in Yuan Shikai’s government before he declared himself emperor, a decision Jiang strongly opposed. Following the collapse of Yuan’s ‘Empire’, he began working with Wu Peifu, becoming a close confidant and assisting him in defeating the Fengtian clique in 1928. He has remained a close ally of Wu, and has spent most of the early 1930’s attempting to prepare the country against the threat of Japanese invasion, something he sees as an inevitability.§!\n\n§YNotes: Skilled military theorist, and has written several works on defensive strategy, though some have accused him of stealing ideas from his subordinates.§!"

 QIE_wang_huaiqing_commander_desc:9 "§YGeneral Description\nBorn:§! §g1875, in Ningjin, Zhili Province, Qing Empire§!\n§YMilitary Career:§! §gWhile Wang was born into an upper-middle class family of bureaucrats in 1875, his father’s alcoholism and gambling drove the family into poverty. Wang left his family and joined the military at a young age, helping suppress revolts in 1905 and becoming a confidante of Yuan Shikai. When Shikai’s restoration fell apart, Wang allied himself with the Zhili Clique, becoming a close confidante of Cao Kun and Wu Peifu. Though he nominally commands several divisions of troops under the Qing command structure, he essentially uses these armies as thuggish extortionists, demanding outrageous 'protection' fees from towns near his troops' garrisons.§!\n\n§YNotes: Known affectionately as the 'toilet general' by his troops. There are two theories for this unique moniker: The first is that he loves his own toilet so much he orders it to be carried with him on campaign at all times, where it served as a makeshift standard. In one story of dubious veracity, he launched an attack on a mountain fortification sitting atop his toilet, stamped with the Chinese character for 'Wang'. His troops faltered once the toilet vanished in the chaos of battle, but Wang and his men lifted the toilet aloft, rallying his troops and (supposedly) inspiring them to climb up a sheer cliff and seize the bastion. Furthermore, he apparently even uses a toilet in lieu of an office chair at his desk. The second (and more plausible) explanation for the nickname is that his troops are unwashed and smell like toilets, as Wang believes peasant soldiers taken right from the fields are more honest and loyal.§!"

The younger brother of the Guangxu Emperor, he was acquainted with a baby Puyi while he was a teenager. Rising through the ranks of the Manchu nobility due to his family ties, he was promoted to Inspector General in 1909 before embarking on a tour of the world in 1910, and attended the funeral of King George V in 1911. Appointed head of the Imperial Guard upon his return, Zaitao served until 1912, when Puyi was overthrown. Briefly restored to the position in 1917, he was immediately removed once Zhang Xun’s restoration attempt failed. He finally returned to the post in 1927 with the German re-imposition of Puyi to the throne. One of the founding members of the Zongshe Party, Zaitao is more open to reform than most older Manchu nobility, having travelled around the world extensively in his youth. An excellent horsemen, he has become interested in armoured warfare in recent years due to its potential battlefield applications.§!\n\n§YNotes: In his spare time he enjoys horse riding, martial arts, and Beijing-style opera.§!"

A well-known incident recounted how Puyi threw a tantrum when he saw that the inner lining of one of Pujie's coats was yellow, because yellow was traditionally a colour reserved only for the emperor. Following the Restoration in 1927, Pujie attended university in Berlin, where he was given the nickname 'Peter' by his classmates, as they found Pujie too difficult to pronounce. Despite growing up in the shadow of his brother, Pujie rarely envied the Emperor, who was confined to pointless ceremonial duties and lacked much of an education beyond court formalities. Pujie, on the other hand, was exposed to the latest Western science, education, and culture. Dismayed by the moral laxness he found in Germany that sprung up following the horrors of the Weltkrieg, he returned to China impressed by Western science and industry, but wary of the libertine culture flourishing in Berlin. Furthermore, he was dismayed at the level of German control over the country, and especially despised the Zhili Clique, whom he viewed as essentially holding his brother hostage. Largely resigned to a ceremonial position within the military, he plots to one day help his brother return to the rightful position on the throne, with him serving as a ‘guiding hand’, of course.§!\n\n§YNotes: He has not married, despite rampant suspicion that the Emperor is infertile.§!"

Interested in engineering as a child, Runqi entered adolescence as the German intervention in China reached its zenith. One of his most distinctive childhood memories was attending the wedding of his sister Wanrong to the exiled Emperor in the Tianjin concession at the age of 10. After the German intervention placed his brother-in-law back on the throne, Runqi learned German from the horde of businessmen and military attachés that descended on Beijing in the economic boom of the late 1920s and early 1930s. This culminated in him attending the Preußische Kriegsakademie in Berlin, where he picked up the German name ‘Ruprecht’. Returning to China in 1935 following a tour of Europe, Runqi developed a fascination with armoured warfare and mechanisation, inspired Heinz Guderian, an instructor at the Akademie. He is somewhat more sympathetic to the Germans than other Manchu nobles, but the decadence and moral laxness he observed in Berlin during the boom years of the late 1920s and early '30s prevented him from becoming a full Germanophile.§!\n\n§YNotes: In Berlin he became obsessed wih American cinema, and he introduced the genre to his brother-in-law, the Emperor, also a fan of cinema in general.

Du's exact role in the events of 1911 have been heavily disputed, with some claiming he was initially loyal to the Qing, and other accusing him of being a key figure in organising the Wuchang Uprising. The story as told by Du himself and his Zhili allies has been heavily revised to put him on the right side of history. From 1926 and forward he served as Wu Peifu's handpicked governor of Hubei Province, initially struggling to oppose the Kuomintang's invasion of Zhili controlled territory during the Northern Expedition. After the Zhili Clique managed to turn the tide of the war, Du assumed full control of Hubei, managing to stabilising the war torn province into a loyal stronghold of Zhili influence. His ties to Japan kept him from being promoted too highly within the Zhili command structure, but following the reforms enacted by Wu in the wake of the LEP collapse he has been promoted to the high command."

After studying infantry for three years, he graduated with the highest score in his class and became a junior commander of the Yi Army. In 1914, Yu became an officer of the garrison in Rehe and in 1917, when the 18th Mixed Brigade was established, Yu's cousin, Zhao Ronghua, commander of the brigade, who was raised by Yu's father, invited Yu to serve under him.\n\nIn the Zhili-Anhui War of 1920, under the command of Zhao, Yu defeated Wu Guangxin's force with the aid of Lu Jinshan's force. In 1922, Xiong Kewu attempted to expel Yang Sen in Sichuan and besieged Yichang in Hubei, while Zhao and Lu intended to abandon the line as they were outnumbered, Yu Xuezhong held until Zhili reinforcements arrived, he thus received much recognition from Wu Peifu and became a regimental commander. In the following two years, Yu fought in Sichuan to aid Yang Sen in consolidating his rule. By 1924, Yu held the rank of major general and was appointed as the commander of his brigade after Zhao was fired for poor performance. The brigade was expanded into a division in 1925 and he fought against the KMT alongside the Yangtze River during the Northern Expedition, delaying their advancement until the NRA collapsed with German intervention, Yu then took charge of defence matters in Hubei.

Bien que nous ayons été contraints de tolérer la restauration de Chen Jiongming au poste de gouverneur en 1927, lui et ses alliés nous ont depuis défiés. La division et la corruption doivent cesser avant qu'elles n'envahissent d'autres parties du pays et nous rétablirons l'autorité centrale."

 QIE_cross_the_dai_river:0 "Traverser la rivière Dai"
 QIE_cross_the_dai_river_desc: "De nombreuses années se sont écoulées depuis le revers subi lors de la quatrième guerre de Zhifeng, et pourtant, depuis lors, la menace d'une guerre venant du nord-est n'a fait que s'aggraver. Zhang Zuolin a vendu son âme et notre pays en concluant un accord avec le Japon. Une cinquième guerre de Zhifeng est ce dont nous avons besoin pour réparer cette grande erreur. Le Zhili sécurisera le nord-est ; c'est le point culminant de tout notre travail et de toutes nos luttes jusqu'à présent, et l'occasion ne se représentera peut-être pas !"

 QIE_destroy_kuomintang: "La Menace du Kuomintang"
 QIE_destroy_kuomintang_desc: "Le Kuomintang, fondé par un Dr Sun Yat-sen aigri, n'est plus qu'un vestige désordonné - un prétexte pour les bandits socialistes et les seigneurs de la guerre pour piller et saccager dans un cycle incessant de violence révolutionnaire. Malgré leur défaite lors de l'expédition du Nord, il en reste beaucoup. Une attaque décisive au sud permettra de chasser ces voyous et de mettre fin à ce bastion rebelle une fois pour toutes."

 QIE_endconcessions: "Mettre un terme aux Concessions"
 QIE_endconcessions_desc: "Les concessions, véritable tâche sur la souveraineté chinoise, existent depuis trop longtemps ! Macao, les Villes des Légations et les vestiges du colonialisme allemand doivent être placés sous notre contrôle direct, soit par la négociation, soit par l'action directe !"

 QIE_salvage_german_industry_desc: "Dans leur hâte de regagner leurs concessions, la Peking-Kommission et les investisseurs allemands ont laissé derrière eux de grandes quantités de machines industrielles. Nous devrions récupérer ces plans et tenter une rétro-ingénierie pour servir nos propres intérêts."

 QIE_leverage_new_pop: "Attirer des intellectuels anti-concession"
 QIE_leverage_new_pop_desc: "Notre intervention en faveur du gouverneur Chen a renforcé la légitimité de notre gouvernement dans des proportions que l'on croyait auparavant impossibles pour un « gouvernement de chef de guerre ». En recrutant d'anciens intellectuels de la NCERA au sein de notre gouvernement, nous pouvons davantage légitimer notre régime."

 QIE_on_our_own: "Par nos propres moyens"

 QIE_hire_republican_officers: "Engager d'anciens officiers républicains"
 QIE_hire_republican_officers_desc: "De nombreux anciens officiers et sous-officiers républicains ont été dégoûtés par notre soutien à la restauration des Qing. Cependant, avec le renversement de la dynastie Qing et notre nouvelle position anti-concessionniste, nous pourrions être en mesure de les recruter à nouveau dans notre armée, apportant avec eux leur expérience considérable."

 QIE_open_up_to_investment: "Simplifier les lois encadrant l'investissement international"
 QIE_open_up_to_investment_desc: "Malgré l'influence allemande, nos lois internationales sur les investissements restent un réseau byzantin de paperasserie, de restrictions et de lacunes. En simplifiant ces lois, nous pouvons attirer des investissements internationaux supplémentaires pour développer notre industrie et notre armée."

 QIE_harmonious_balance: "Équilibre harmonieux"
 QIE_harmonious_balance_desc: "Peu de gens pensaient que cela était possible, mais nous avons réussi à établir un équilibre délicat entre les intellectuels, les nobles mandchous, la clique Zhili et l'Empereur lui-même. Le commun des mortels considère désormais notre gouvernement comme une entité légitime et est prêt à le soutenir, du moins la plupart du temps."

 QIE_baoding_zhili_cooperation: "Encourager la Coopération Baoding-Zhili"
 QIE_baoding_zhili_cooperation_desc: "Les Cadets de l'Académie Militaire de Boading, dont la plupart ont rejoint le YCP, ont longtemps ressenti l'influence continue de l'Allemagne et d'autres puissances étrangères sur notre gouvernement. Avec notre nouvelle position anti-concessions, cependant, ils ont commencé à soutenir notre régime. En les attirant dans la structure de commandement de la clique Zhili, nous pouvons garantir leur loyauté pour les années à venir."

 QIE_guardian_of_emperor: "Répandre de la Propagande Pro-Impériale"
 QIE_guardian_of_emperor_desc: "Beaucoup au sein du parti Zongshe ont longtemps accusé la Clique Zhili de mettre Puyi sur la touche.

 QIE_placateassembly: "Apaiser l'Assemblée"
 QIE_placateassembly_desc: "Notre décision d'approfondir les liens avec l'Allemagne a suscité une certaine agitation, mais elle a surtout creusé un fossé entre nous et l'opposition à l'Assemblée Nationale. Ils n'ont pas de réel pouvoir, mais avoir une opposition bruyante ne nous aidera certainement pas à long terme. Nous devons apaiser ces groupes par tous les moyens nécessaires pour nous assurer leur loyauté."

 QIE_future_relationship: "Relations Futures"

 QIE_request_german_bailout_desc: "Notre dette commerciale internationale continue de nous empêcher de faire des progrès industriels significatifs en tant que nation.

 QIE_germanarsenal_desc: "Les armes et la technologie allemandes ont leurs propres avantages, malgré les inconvénients associés à des liens plus étroits avec l'Allemagne.

 QIE_germandesigns_desc: "Les modèles d'armes allemandes leur ont permis de vaincre durant la Weltkrieg, et nous utilisons depuis longtemps des modèles allemands dans les arsenaux chinois.

 QIE_kriegsmarine: "Acheter des navires allemands des surplus"
 QIE_kriegsmarine_desc: "La marine allemande a bénéficié d'un programme d'expansion et de modernisation rapide après la Weltkrieg, et faute de conflit un grand nombre de navires allemands sont actuellement en veille et ne font rien.

 QIE_motorized_armor: "Importer des Panzers et des camions"
 QIE_motorized_armor_desc: "Les Panzers et les camions allemands sont parmi les machines de combat les plus redoutées au monde, et certains de nos jeunes officiers sont enthousiastes quant à leur potentiel de combat.

 QIE_grant_foreign_licenses_desc: "Bien que nous puissions facilement construire nos propres usines, ce dont nous avons vraiment besoin, c'est d'un équipement d'outillage allemand de haute qualité.

 QIE_seek_german_RR_capital: "Engager des ingénieurs ferroviaires Allemands"
 QIE_seek_german_RR_capital_desc: "Une grande partie de notre réseau ferroviaire a été construite par des entreprises européennes. Alors que certains pourraient s'émouvoir de continuer à les utiliser pour construire nos chemins de fer, ils restent les maîtres incontestés dans le domaine. Nous devrions rechercher des ingénieurs ferroviaires allemands et les embaucher directement pour améliorer notre infrastructure."

 QIE_import_krupp_steel:0 "Importer de l'acier de chez Krupp"
 QIE_import_krupp_steel_desc:0 "Alors que la plupart des aciers produits dans le pays manquent de qualité, Krupp est le synonyme international de qualité.

 QIE_siemens: "Acheter des radios Siemens"
 QIE_siemens_desc: "Les radios sont une aubaine dans un pays énorme comme la Chine, et il est essentiel de veiller à ce que nos troupes puissent coordonner leurs tactiques de combat. Siemens est le roi allemand des radios, et nous devrions en importer pour équiper nos troupes."

 QIE_debt_issue: "Régler le problème de la dette"
 QIE_debt_issue_desc: "Le problème de la dette qui a tourmenté l'empire continue de tourmenter notre nouvelle république. Bien que nous puissions demander de l'aide à l'Allemagne, cela entraînerait très probablement l'effondrement de notre régime déjà instable sous la pression publique. Au lieu de cela, faisons défaut et adoptons une position anti-concession, fournissant à notre gouvernement une légitimité. Ce n'est pas comme si les Allemands nous appréciaient réellement, au-delà de la personne de Puyi..."

 QIE_pragmatism: "Pragmatisme"
 QIE_pragmatism_desc: "Le pragmatisme, la philosophie adoptée par Hu Shih, encourage la coopération avec des éléments potentiellement peu recommandables de l'environnement politique afin d'apporter les changements les plus productifs. Nous devrions appliquer cette théorie au fonctionnement de notre gouvernement pour mieux légitimer les « seigneurs de guerre » de notre gouvernement."

 QIE_hu_reconstructing_china_desc: "Depuis le soulèvement de Wuchang, de nombreux hommes importants ont promis un avenir glorieux à la Chine. Ils ont parlé de grandeur et d'industrialisation, mais peu d'entre eux ont concrétisé leurs projets. Nous ne nous faisons toutefois aucune illusion sur la faisabilité de ces projets. Pour avoir une chance de réaliser de tels rêves, nous devons d'abord éliminer les abus du système et améliorer les conditions matérielles de la population."

 QIE_eradicate_manchu_desc: "La noblesse mandchoue et ses partisans se sont infiltrés dans tous les recoins de notre société. Même après la chute de leur faux empereur et de leur cour royale, leur influence se fait encore sentir à travers de nombreuses exploitations économiques mandchoues et certains sympathisants au sein de la bureaucratie. Il est indispensable d'éliminer ces éléments féodaux déstabilisants avant de pouvoir consolider la Chine en tant qu'État-nation républicain moderne."

 QIE_deligitimize_oppo_desc: "Alors que l'Assemblée était un organe de pouvoir impuissant, elle nous obligeait toujours à prêter attention aux caprices des nobles et des élites urbaines déconnectées de la réalité. Nous devrions délégitimer ces groupes aristocratiques et nous concentrer sur les vrais besoins du peuple de notre grande république."

 QIE_placate_intellectuals: "Apaiser les Intellectuels"
 QIE_placate_intellectuals_desc: "La NCERA jouit d'une grande popularité parmi les intellectuels de Beijing. Avec notre nouvelle position anti-concessions, cependant, nous pouvons essayer de les intégrer dans le gouvernement républicain, en les unifiant derrière notre nouvelle idéologie."

 QIE_rebuild_arsenals_desc: "Les combats à l'extérieur de l'Académie militaire de Baoding à la suite de la tentative de coup d'État ont endommagé l'arsenal.

 QIE_rebuild_domestic_ind_desc: "Les émeutes et la violence qui ont englouti Beijing ont détruit de grandes parties de la ville, y compris une partie de l'industrie. Nous devrions nettoyer les décombres et construire des usines plus grandes et plus avancées sur les ruines."

 QIE_purge_zhili_desc: "Alors que les forces fidèles au Coup d'État contrôlent Beijing et les zones entourant l'Académie militaire de Baoding, le reste de notre territoire reste sous le contrôle des chefs de guerre traîtres de la clique Zhili. Nous devons d'abord sécuriser la frontière nord, éliminer les garnisons de Zhili avant de tourner les yeux vers le sud."

 QIE_coup_backer: "Notre Nouveau Bienfaiteur"
 QIE_coup_backer_desc: "Le coup d'État qui a détruit la clique Zhili n'a pas été accompli seul. Qu'on le veuille ou non, afin d'arracher notre pays des mains des seigneurs de guerre despotiques, nous avons dû conclure un accord avec les pouvoirs locaux de la région. Maintenant, nous devons les inviter à Beijing et voir ce qu'ils veulent en échange de leur soutien."

 QIE_zhang_tianran_backer_desc: "L'Honorable Maître de la secte Yiguandao, Zhang Tianran a une énorme influence parmi les adeptes de sa religion.

 QIE_yan_xishan_backer: "Yan Xishan"
 QIE_yan_xishan_backer_desc: "Le gouverneur Yan Xishan a été un allié inattendu dans notre coup d'état. Auparavant antimonarchiste, son esprit politique avisé a compris que l'Empereur était désormais un outil politique puissant. Il souhaite avant tout travailler avec les partis de l'establishment existant pour moderniser la Chine et diffuser son idéologie personnalisée - une philosophie politique nébuleuse qui englobe le traditionalisme, le libéralisme, le nationalisme et le syndicalisme."

 QIE_yiguandao: "Influences de Yiguandao"
 QIE_yiguandao_desc: "Avec son nouveau poste au sein de notre gouvernement, Zhang Tianran a commencé à étendre le pouvoir et l'influence du Yiguandao dans notre pays.

 QIE_bolster_legitimacy: "Renforcer la Légitimité Impériale"
 QIE_bolster_legitimacy_desc: "Pendant les dix années du régime Zhili, peu de gens pensaient que l'empereur était autre chose qu'une marionnette enfermée dans la Cité interdite. Aujourd'hui, avec le soutien d'un nouveau système constitutionnel et de la foi de Yiguandao, les gens commencent à voir l'empereur comme une figure importante unifiant le gouvernement dans sa lutte pour restaurer l'ordre."

 QIE_legitimate_emperor_desc: "Nos efforts ont été couronnés de succès. Puyi est maintenant considéré comme le souverain légitime de la Chine par tous les paysans et fermiers ! Zhang Tianran, ayant consolidé le pouvoir dans le Shandong, a déclaré que la province devait être pleinement intégrée à notre nation."

 QIE_modernize_monarchy_desc: "Si le gouverneur du Shandong est un loyaliste des Qing, il est également conscient que la position de l'empereur doit évoluer pour s'adapter aux notions modernes de gouvernement. Il envisage de pousser l'empereur à agir davantage comme un monarque constitutionnel de style occidental, servant de figure unificatrice apolitique et de médiateur potentiel en cas de conflit grave."

 QIE_reinforce_confucianism: "L'Empereur et le Peuple en un Seul Corps"
 QIE_reinforce_confucianism_desc: "Avant le soulèvement de Wuchang, nos prédécesseurs avaient cherché à élever Confucius du rang de prédicateur de la sagesse ancienne à celui de nouveau symbole de l'État-nation chinois. Ce nouveau culte d'État devait contribuer à intégrer Confucius dans un récit national, où le sage vénéré incarnerait l'essence culturelle de la nation et la chinoisité en général. La réinstitutionnalisation du culte d'État de Confucius dans l'éducation, ainsi que dans les rites culturels, nous aidera à créer un Empire harmonieux et éclairé."

 QIE_revise_the_chinese_tripitaka_desc: "Le canon bouddhiste chinois a longtemps fait l'objet de débats, mais sous la direction de Maître Qu, nous allons créer un "Tripitaka" révisé, ou recueil de textes, qui met l'accent sur les éléments conservateurs et ésotériques des "sectes du chapeau rouge", en particulier l'école Kagyu, comme pierre angulaire politique de notre nouveau gouvernement. Nous ferons ensuite la promotion de ces idéaux auprès de nos représentants gouvernementaux, ainsi qu'auprès de l'empereur lui-même, qui s'est montré réceptif aux enseignements de la secte Red Hat."

 QIE_move_industry_desc: "Avec la menace d'une invasion étrangère qui se profile, notre nouveau bienfaiteur a proposé d'utiliser certains de ses soldats pour aider à déplacer l'industrie depuis le littoral jusque vers l'intérieur des terres. En cas d'invasion navale étrangère, cela garantira que nous serons toujours en mesure d'équiper nos troupes."

 QIE_train_civil_servants: "Former les fonctionnaires"
 QIE_train_civil_servants_desc: "La bureaucratie de la clique Zhili s'appuyait sur le népotisme, le copinage et la corruption endémique et généralisée. Cela a fait cruellement défaut à l'administration civile de la Chine, la plupart des postes étant occupés par des personnes non qualifiées. Le gouverneur Song a proposé de mettre en œuvre une version modernisée des anciens examens de la fonction publique, afin de garantir que ces postes soient pourvus par des hommes qualifiés."

 QIE_lessons_of_model_province_desc: "Les leçons tirées par Yan Xishan et ses hommes au cours de son mandat de gouverneur du Shanxi, qui a duré plusieurs décennies, constitueront un guide essentiel pour les années à venir en Chine. Les grandes réalisations du Shanxi en matière d'éducation, d'agriculture et de développement industriel ont acquis une renommée internationale malgré la pauvreté matérielle du Shanxi. Avec toutes les ressources de l'Empire derrière lui, Yan a l'intention de transformer la Chine pour le meilleur."

 QIE_chinese_bismarck: "Le Bismarck Chinois"
 QIE_chinese_bismarck_desc: ""Les trois grands devoirs du peuple sont de servir dans l'armée, de payer des impôts et de recevoir une éducation". Grand admirateur du système prussien, la victoire allemande dans la Weltkrieg a renforcé le désir de Yan d'introduire un esprit militaire dans le pays, en incitant les parents à donner des armes-jouets à leurs enfants et en formant une "société de sang et de fer". La Chine sera unifiée, par la force s'il le faut."

 QIE_nationalize_yan_thot_desc: "Depuis son accession au poste de gouverneur du Shanxi, Yan a consacré énormément de temps à développer son idéologie personnelle, un mélange éclectique de fédéralisme, de confucianisme, de christianisme et même de syndicalisme. Grâce à sa nouvelle position de pouvoir national, Yan a commencé à diffuser ses idées dans toute la Chine."

 QIE_vigor_modernization: "Modernisation Vigoureuse"
 QIE_vigor_modernization_desc: "Yan Xishan est depuis longtemps un partisan de la modernisation industrielle, transformant la province du Shanxi en un petit mais dynamique centre minier et industriel.

 QIE_pick_NCERA: "Utiliser la NCERA"
 QIE_pick_NCERA_desc: "La Nouvelle Association Réformiste de l'Empire Chinois, ou NCERA en abrégé, est un parti puissant qui contrôle la loyauté à la fois des paysans ruraux et de certains intellectuels urbains. Bien que moins axés sur la modernisation industrielle, leur souci d'aider la plus grande partie de la population les rend extrêmement populaires."

 QIE_pick_YCP: "Utiliser le YCP"
 QIE_pick_YCP_desc: "Le Parti Jeune Chine, ou YCP, est composé de jeunes cadets de l'Académie Baoding, avec quelques intellectuels urbains assurant le financement et l'organisation. Ayant pour priorité la centralisation du pays et son urbanisation, ils ne disposent pas du large soutien populaire de la NCERA - bien que leur objectif de modernisation en fasse un bon choix pour un développement rapide."

 QIE_pick_MP: "Utiliser le Zongshe"
 QIE_pick_MP_desc: "Le Parti Zongshe est, de toute évidence, dominé par la noblesse mandchoue de Beijing. Bien que cela puisse sembler un choix étrange pour un parti au pouvoir, au cours des dix dernières années, les nobles ont utilisé la liberté relative que leur accordaient les Zhili pour constituer de grandes fortunes industrielles, investissant dans les quelques usines ouvertes à Beujung n'appartenant pas à des entreprises allemandes, leur donnant un poids important."

 QIE_rural_reform: "Institutionnaliser le Mouvement Réformiste Rural"
 QIE_rural_reform_desc: "Le chaos et la destruction de l'ère des seigneurs de guerre ont laissé de vastes étendues de la Chine rurale dévastées et détruites. Le Mouvement de Reconstruction Rurale, la moitié de la NCERA, a tenté de résoudre ces problèmes indépendamment du soutien du gouvernement, au cours des dernières années. Avec un financement approprié, cependant, ils peuvent faire une réelle différence dans la reconstruction de la Chine."

 QIE_ncera_industry: "Investir dans l'industrie rurale"
 QIE_ncera_industry_desc: "Alors que la petite industrie chinoise est actuellement concentrée dans ses villes, elles sont vulnérables aux attaques militaires et aux troubles. Au lieu de cela, la NCERA a proposé d'étendre l'industrie aux villages ruraux. Cela encouragera leur croissance et rendra notre industrie moins vulnérable aux attaques ou incursions étrangères."

 QIE_kang_youwei_desc: "Kang Youwei était l'un des fondateurs de la NCERA, bien qu'il soit décédé peu après sa création en 1927. Brillant érudit et réformateur juridique, Kang a passé un demi-siècle à plaider pour une monarchie constitutionnelle, dirigée par un empereur qui s'occupe vraiment de son peuple. Avec le renversement du Zhili et le renforcement de la NCERA, ce rêve est presque devenu réalité."

 QIE_rural_infrastructure: "Moderniser l'Infrastructure Rurale"
 QIE_rural_infrastructure_desc: "L'infrastructure rurale de la Chine fait cruellement défaut, certains la qualifiant de pire au monde après l'Afrique. Des investissements gouvernementaux concertés doivent être réalisés dans l'amélioration des réseaux de transport ruraux si nous voulons un jour sortir la paysannerie chinoise de la pauvreté."

 QIE_benevolent_emperor: "Un Empereur Bénévole"
 QIE_benevolent_emperor_desc: "Alors que la plupart des occidentaux pensent que l'empereur de Chine est une sorte de seigneur de guerre despotique tout droit sorti du Moyen Âge, nous savons que l'empereur est une âme bienveillante et gentille qui veut le meilleur pour ses sujets. Des efforts de propagande concertés doivent être déployés pour garantir que tout le monde considère notre vision comme la vérité."

 QIE_rural_loyalty: "Loyauté Rurale Assurée"
 QIE_rural_loyalty_desc: "La NCERA a achevé son grand plan de réforme rurale et a assuré son emprise sur le gouvernement. Même dans les régions de Chine que nous ne contrôlons pas directement, les gens réclament notre leadership bienveillant ! Lorsque nos ennemis entreront sur nos terres, ils ne trouveront pas non plus la population facile à vaincre - la paysannerie est prête à sacrifier sa vie pour défendre la Chine !"

 QIE_reform_criminal_justice: "Office de Révision Légale"
 QIE_reform_criminal_justice_desc: "Lors de sa création en 1902, l'Office de révision légale et ses mécènes ont entrepris de vastes réformes judiciaires et constitutionnelles. Bien que l'Office ait réussi à promulguer le Da Qing Xinglu (code pénal des Qing) et le Da Qing minlu (code civil des Qing), ces succès ont été interrompus par l'anarchie républicaine. À l'heure de la reconstruction, les services judiciaires de l'Office sont à nouveau nécessaires."

 QIE_military_state: "Militariser l'État"
 QIE_military_state_desc: "La Clique Zhili, bien qu'étant une organisation militaire, a laissé de larges parties de l'armée des Qing totalement sous-financées et inefficaces. Afin de corriger ce problème, nous avons entamé une militarisation totale de la nation. Des mouvements entraineront la jeunesse, un système de conscription modernisé, et d'autres réformes nous assurerons d'être prêts à faire face à n'importe quel ennemi."

 QIE_centralize_state: "Centraliser l'État"
 QIE_centralize_state_desc: "Les deux dernières décennies de conflits internes entre les chefs de guerre ont laissé la Chine divisée et décentralisée. Depuis notre nouvelle position de pouvoir à Beijing, nous devons maintenant commencer la tâche longue et ardue de centraliser cette nation divisée, car ce n'est qu'ainsi que son peuple pourra jouir d'une paix et d'une prospérité véritables."

 QIE_YCP_arsenals: "Moderniser les Arsenaux"
 QIE_YCP_arsenals_desc: "Les arsenaux qui doivent être approvisionnés nos machines de guerre sont totalement obsolètes et sous-financés. Des investissements concertés doivent être faits dans la production d'armes et de munitions si nous voulons avoir une chance de vaincre nos ennemis."

 QIE_destroy_leftists: "Détruire les Gauchistes"
 QIE_destroy_leftists_desc: "Bien qu'il y ait peu de gauchistes sur le territoire que nous contrôlons directement, le récent soulèvement du KMT dans le sud a déclenché une sorte de « peur rouge » au sein de l'élite. Nous pouvons utiliser cela à notre avantage, en brandissant des allégations d'« infiltration socialiste » pour renforcer notre régime et encourager le peuple à nous soutenir."

 QIE_emperor_unifier: "Un Empereur Unificateur"
 QIE_emperor_unifier_desc: "Alors que certains peuvent considérer l'Empereur comme anachronique par rapport à notre vision modernisatrice et centralisatrice, il peut servir d'outil à notre service - un point de ralliement autour duquel le pays formellement disparate et décentralisé peut s'unifier. La propagande peut être utilisée pour s'assurer que tous les Chinois - d'un fermier sur le fleuve Jaune à un éleveur de chèvres dans les steppes du Xinjiang savent qu'ils font partie de la même nation."

 QIE_YCP_modernization: "Moderniser l'Industrie Civile"
 QIE_YCP_modernization_desc: "Les quelques industries civiles qui n'étaient pas autrefois dirigées par les Allemands sont risibles selon les normes occidentales. Avec le retrait industriel allemand, nous pouvons reprendre leurs conceptions et les appliquer à nos propres usines, les moderniser et augmenter considérablement notre production industrielle."

 QIE_cult_of_progress: "Le Bureau du Progrès"
 QIE_cult_of_progress_desc: "Insatisfaits des débats sinueux de l'Assemblée, les membres du Parti de la Jeune Chine ont décidé de créer un nouveau "Bureau du Progrès" pour superviser la réforme indispensable des forces armées et des industries d'État. Sous les auspices de Yan Xishan, le Parti de la Jeune Chine espère éclipser l'Assemblée avec des organisations de sa propre conception, en contournant complètement le contrôle législatif."

 QIE_YCP_modern_warfare: "Les Besoins de la Guerre Moderne"
 QIE_YCP_modern_warfare_desc: "Le tumulte de la dernière décennie a appris à tous les officiers l'importance d'une artillerie fine. Nul ne l'est plus que la clique qui constitue le noyau du parti Jeune Chine. Beaucoup ont été éduqués en Allemagne, et ont vu de près la puissance des armements modernes. L'État ne peut pas relâcher, même pour un bref instant, notre élan vers la modernité."

 QIE_YCP_trappings_of_a_party_state: "Les Pièges d'un État-parti"
 QIE_YCP_trappings_of_a_party_state_desc: "Main dans la main, le Parti de la Jeune Chine et Yan Xishan ont travaillé à l'avènement d'une nouvelle Chine débarrassée des maladies chroniques que la vieille noblesse et les seigneurs de la guerre ont engendrées il y a tant d'années. Le monde a évolué rapidement ces dernières années, il est du devoir du parti de prendre ces leçons à cœur et de façonner l'avenir de la Chine en conséquence."

 QIE_chinese_century: "Le Siècle Chinois"
 QIE_chinese_century_desc: "Une fois nos vastes réformes achevées, nous entrons dans le monde comme une puissance montante, prête à affronter nos ennemis et à prouver au monde une fois pour toutes que la Chine est le véritable maître de l'Orient."

 QIE_appoint_viceroys: "Administration Générale des Communications"
 QIE_appoint_viceroys_desc: "Le développement des télécommunications en Chine a commencé avec la lettre ouverte du gouverneur Li Hongzhang en 1879. Alors qu'il souhaitait donner la priorité aux besoins de communication de l'armée impériale, parallèlement au développement du complexe militaro-industriel de l'Empire, d'autres réformateurs ont également reconnu les vastes avantages civils et économiques du système. Nous n'avons pas encore réalisé leurs ambitions, mais la restructuration de l'Office du télégraphe contribuerait à lancer le processus. "

 QIE_new_coronation: "Un Nouveau Couronnement"
 QIE_new_coronation_desc: "Une idée controversée a traversé l'esprit de la noblesse Qing depuis le coup d'État anti-Zhili - un deuxième couronnement pour Puyi. Bien que coûteux, cela pourrait signifier à la Chine et au monde que nous avons officiellement laissé derrière nous l'époque des seigneurs de guerre et que nous sommes entrés dans une nouvelle étape de croissance et de renouveau."

 QIE_imperial_arsenals: "Construire de nouveaux Arsenaux Impériaux"
 QIE_imperial_arsenals_desc: "L'industrialisation de la Chine a commencé par la production militaire. C'est le besoin de sécurité et d'autosuffisance qui a poussé les premiers réformateurs à développer des industries lourdes pour la fabrication de navires et d'armes. Toutefois, accablés par des contraintes sociales et économiques, nos prédécesseurs n'ont pas réussi à rattraper les autres puissances impériales. Il est indispensable de combler ce retard pour assurer la survie de notre empire."

 QIE_noble_factories: "Bureau des Affaires Industrielles"
 QIE_noble_factories_desc: "Avec la saisie de toutes les entreprises allemandes dans le sillage du coup d'État, de nombreuses usines appartenant à des Allemands sont aujourd'hui inoccupées. Alors que certaines personnes à courte vue déplorent la baisse de la production économique, nous considérons cette situation comme une opportunité de développer nos propres industries. Avec l'arsenal de Hanyang et le bureau minier de Kaiping comme modèles, nous allons indigéniser et améliorer ces entreprises allemandes."

 QIE_raise_banners: "Levez les Bannières"
 QIE_raise_banners_desc: "Alors que les Huit Bannières ont été pour la plupart dissoutes à la suite de la Rébellion de Taiping, certains généraux Qing suggèrent maintenant que nous créions une version moderne du système. Tout en adhérant largement aux structures organisationnelles divisionnaires occidentales, nous appliquerons l'histoire et l'héritage des Qing pour les faire véritablement nôtres."

 QIE_imperial_roads: "Le Dragon et le Cheval de Fer"
 QIE_imperial_roads_desc: "Avant l'anarchie républicaine, les gouverneurs Li Hongzhang et Zhang Zhidong ont été les pionniers du développement des infrastructures dans le Grand Qing. Leurs projets terrestres ont contribué à lier l'empire, en améliorant la sécurité et l'interconnexion économique. Nous honorerons leur héritage et relierons les vastes étendues de notre empire grâce à de nouveaux réseaux routiers et ferroviaires."

 QIE_mandate_heaven: "Le Mandat du Ciel"
 QIE_mandate_heaven_desc: "Certains pourraient prétendre qu'il s'agit d'un terme dépassé, mais qu'est-ce que le Mandat du Ciel, sinon une expression populaire de la volonté légitime du gouvernement ? Nos érudits devront mettre à jour certains textes, mais avec un peu de travail, nous pouvons diffuser une propagande qui montre que Puyi est le véritable et légitime empereur de Chine."

 QIE_manchu_default_debt: "Défaut sur la Dette"
 QIE_manchu_default_debt_desc: "Alors que nous avons créé un nouveau gouvernement, nos créanciers internationaux ne voient pas les choses de la même manière. Notre dette internationale écrasante continuera d'entraver notre croissance économique à moins que nous ne fassions défaut, nous portant préjudice à court terme mais nous permettant de nous développer à long terme."

 QIE_more_equal_treaties: "Négociations de Dettes"
 QIE_more_equal_treaties_desc: "Bien qu'il puisse être tentant de faire défaut sur notre dette, des membres influents du Zongshe ont proposé une alternative pour améliorer la longévité fiscale de l'empire. L'Allemagne a vu son influence considérablement réduite par les nombreux anti-concessionnistes qui ont pris de l'importance au sein de notre nouveau gouvernement, mais si nous lui offrons une chance de renégocier nos liens économiques, elle pourrait considérer que c'est une chance de sauver une partie de son influence à Beijing."

 QIE_county_reorganization: "Loi sur la Réorganisation des Comtés"
 QIE_county_reorganization_desc: "La Loi sur la Réorganisation des Comtés est peut-être l'un des textes législatifs les plus risqués depuis les réformes des Cent Jours. Sa promulgation modifiera irrévocablement les relations rurales en imposant la volonté de l'empereur à la société rurale. Bien que risquée, cette loi laisse espérer que les gouvernements des comtés ne seront plus des institutions corrompues et intéressées, mais de véritables outils de l'empereur pour améliorer la vie de ses sujets."

 QIE_county_assemblies: "Rétablir les Assemblées Départementales"
 QIE_county_assemblies_desc: "En 1910, la province de Zhili a expérimenté l'autonomie en créant des assemblées de comté. Ces assemblées sont devenues des institutions avec lesquelles les gentries et les élites locales projettent leur pouvoir et négocient leurs relations avec le centre. Bien que les Zhili les aient dissoutes par la force au début des années 30, nous pouvons faire revivre ces assemblées pour gagner les faveurs des élites rurales, ce qui nous permettrait de consolider notre contrôle sur les campagnes."

 QIE_imperial_consolidation: "Pacifier la Nation"
 QIE_imperial_consolidation_desc: "La majorité de la Chine est dirigée par des cliques de seigneurs de la guerre, des gauchistes et pire encore, des républicains. Ces traîtres doivent être détruits ! Bientôt, nos armées partiront pour détruire ces rats et unifier la Chine derrière la bannière de l'Empereur !"

 QIE_demand_fealty: "Demander aux Chefs de Guerre de se soumettre"
 QIE_demand_fealty_desc: "Alors que nous devons rechercher et détruire les gauchistes et les républicains qui infestent une grande partie de notre pays, les chefs de guerre les plus douteux idéologiquement parlant peuvent être mis au pas par la menace de notre armée suprême. Sinon, nous les détruirons simplement."

 QIE_destroy_concessions: "Éradiquer les Concessions"
 QIE_destroy_concessions_desc: "Les Villes des Légations sont une tâche sur la souveraineté et l'indépendance de la Chine. Alors que le commerce avec l'Occident est autorisé, les villes sont des reliques du siècle de l'humiliation et n'ont pas leur place dans notre gouvernement moderne. Avec le reste du monde plongé dans le chaos, c'est maintenant le moment idéal pour frapper et récupérer nos villes perdues !"

 QIE_false_republic: "S'occuper des Traitres du Nord"
 QIE_false_republic_desc: "Les imbéciles du nord prétendent être le « dernier bastion » du gouvernement légitime de la Chine. En réalité, ce ne sont guère plus que des pions entre les mains des Japonais. Pendant qu'ils servent servilement leurs maîtres, nous devrions frapper et reconquérir notre patrie !"

 QIE_we_win: "Le Dragon se Relève de ses Cendres"
 QIE_we_win_desc: "Peu de gens pensaient que cela était possible, mais nous avons triomphé de tous nos ennemis ! Nous sommes désormais incontestés en tant que véritables maîtres de la Chine, avec l'empereur prêt à conduire la nation dans ce nouveau monde."

 QIE_rebuild_command_structure: "Restructurer l’État-Major Impérial"
 QIE_rebuild_command_structure_desc: "Officiellement, les Grands Qing n'ont jamais créé d'état-major général. Bien que des propositions aient été faites en ce sens en 1901, ces discussions n'ont jamais abouti. Notre état-major actuel est un héritage des Zhili, marqué par le népotisme et la corruption. Rien de moins qu'un nettoyage en profondeur de cette structure pourrie pour garantir une efficacité maximale et la loyauté de nos commandants."

 QIE_foreigner_against_foreigner: "La Connexion de Shanghai"
 QIE_foreigner_against_foreigner_desc: "Au sein des légations étrangères, de nombreux militaires et soldats de carrière européens sont actuellement sans emploi. Qu'ils soient français, britanniques ou russes, l'effondrement de leurs empires les a laissés sans emploi convenable, et plus d'un de ces militaires en veut à l'Allemagne d'avoir balayé leurs anciennes colonies. Obtenir leur service ne serait pas seulement bénéfique pour nous sur le plan militaire, mais nous permettrait également d'avoir de précieuses relations au sein des légations."

 QIE_look_to_our_past: "Héritage des Nouvelles Armées"
 QIE_look_to_our_past_desc: "Créées en 1895 pour servir de bouclier contre les empiétements étrangers et les ennemis intérieurs, les Nouvelles Armées s'étaient retournées contre l'Empereur et avaient laissé place à l'anarchie républicaine. Nous avons commis de nombreuses erreurs dans leur gestion, la plus grave étant d'accorder trop d'autorité personnelle aux commandants locaux. Depuis, nous avons tiré les leçons de nos erreurs et nous allons mettre sur pied une force plus importante et plus puissante que notre première tentative"

 QIE_assess_doctrines: "Commission pour la Réorganisation de l'Armée"
 QIE_assess_doctrines_desc: "La Commission pour l'organisation de l'armée a été créée pour aider à promulguer des réformes clés de l'armée impériale en 1903, et il ne serait pas exagéré de dire que ces réformes ont jeté les bases de notre force actuelle. Cependant, les seigneurs de la guerre ont gâché les progrès accomplis par leurs querelles incessantes. Nous devrions réunir à nouveau la Commission pour examiner et peut-être aider à réorganiser la force impériale une fois de plus."

 QIE_uneasy_coalition: "La Coalition Improbable"
 QIE_uneasy_coalition_desc: "Chacun des groupes politiques qui ont aidé à renverser la clique Zhili a beaucoup à offrir à l'armée. La NCERA apporte la loyauté de la paysannerie, le YCP est composé d'élèves-officiers Baoding et la noblesse Qing contrôle certains des meilleurs cavaliers de la nation. Alors que nous devons tous travailler ensemble pour vaincre les Japonais, chaque groupe peut vouloir des concessions s'il n'est pas au pouvoir."

 QIE_rural_defense_force: "Fonder les Forces de Défenses Rurales"
 QIE_rural_defense_force_desc: "Pendant trop longtemps, la paysannerie chinoise a été terrorisée par des bandes de pillards et de bandits itinérants. La NCERA a proposé de mettre en place un système selon lequel chaque village aura sa propre force de défense équipée de fusils obsolètes. Bien qu'ils soient d'une utilité militaire douteuse, ils seront utiles pour harceler les ennemis et rendre notre territoire coûteux à occuper."

 QIE_prepare_dikes: "Préparer les Digues"
 QIE_prepare_dikes_desc: "Les digues le long du fleuve Jaune représentent la possibilité d'une frappe drastique contre les Japonais. Si nous les ouvrons pendant que les forces ennemies avancent, les eaux de crue ralentiront énormément leur progression et donneront à nos forces une meilleure chance de défendre la zone."

 QIE_exploit_baoding_contacts: "Exploiter les contacts Baoding"
 QIE_exploit_baoding_contacts_desc: "L'Académie militaire de Baoding a des contacts avec des académies militaires et des arsenaux dans toute la Chine, même dans les zones contrôlées par des ennemis apparents. Avec un financement suffisant, ces contacts pourraient être convaincus de se joindre à nous, apportant avec eux leur expérience et leur expertise technique."

 QIE_reinstate_baojia: "Réinstaller le Système Baojia"
 QIE_reinstate_baojia_desc: "Fondé pendant la dynastie Song, le système Baojia a été créé pour maintenir l'ordre local, collecter des impôts et organiser des projets civils. En recréant une version moderne de ce système, nous pouvons recruter et former des soldats plus efficacement."

 QIE_best_money_can_buy: "Écoles Militaires Préparatoires"
 QIE_best_money_can_buy_desc: "Les écoles militaires préparatoires ont d'abord été créées pour remédier rapidement à la grave pénurie d'officiers et d'élèves officiers formés pour la nouvelle armée. Bien que la nature provinciale des académies signifie que la qualité des diplômés varie, elles ont néanmoins contribué à compenser au moins une partie des coûts de formation. Nous devrions envisager de rétablir au moins quelques-unes de ces académies militaires."

 QIE_imperial_propaganda: "Vénérer le Modèle du Citoyen-Soldat"
 QIE_imperial_propaganda_desc: "Pendant trop longtemps, les seigneurs de la guerre ont souillé ce que signifiait être un soldat par leurs petits désirs matériels et leurs luttes de pouvoir. Depuis les temps les plus reculés, le citoyen-soldat chinois idéal est moralement intègre, doté d'une force physique aiguisée et d'un esprit tout aussi vif. Nous devons imposer ce modèle de masculinité militaire à l'ensemble de l'armée, afin que tous les soldats du Grand Qing puissent rivaliser avec des pays comme le Japon et l'Allemagne."

 QIE_manchu_naval_academy: "Fonder l'Académie Navale Impériale"
 QIE_manchu_naval_academy_desc: "La marine Qing a été en grande partie formée par des écoles européennes. Bien qu'il s'agisse d'une préoccupation secondaire ou tertiaire à l'heure actuelle, nous devrions tout de même consacrer des fonds à la formation de nos cadets de la marine ici, plutôt qu'à l'étranger."

 QIE_manchu_air_warfare: "Étudier les Tactiques Aériennes Européennes"
 QIE_manchu_air_warfare_desc: "Alors que nous aimerions dépendre le moins possible des démons étrangers, il ne fait aucun doute que leur maîtrise de la guerre aérienne est incontestée. Nous devrions étudier leur doctrine et leurs tactiques, afin de pouvoir les appliquer à notre propre armée de l'air."

 QIE_expand_baoding_rnd: "Fonder le Département de Recherche Militaire Baoding"
 QIE_expand_baoding_rnd_desc: "Avec notre armée entièrement réformée selon des principes modernes, nous devrions nous efforcer de créer une institution qui permette à nos forces de se tenir au courant des dernières innovations technologiques. En créant un département de recherche militaire Baoding entièrement indépendant, nos forces auront le soutien technique pour affronter n'importe quelle armée dans le monde."

 QIE_commisars: "Commissaires Politiques"
 QIE_commisars_desc: "Liu Menggeng a proposé une idée intéressante - ajouter un commissaire idéologique dédié à chaque formation militaire. Bien que coûteux, ces hommes inspireront nos forces à combattre avec une ferveur patriotique encore plus grande !"

 QIE_integration_harsh: "Intégration par la Force"
 QIE_integration_harsh_desc: "Les ignobles traîtres qui se sont rebellés contre notre règne bienveillant ne méritent aucune pitié ! Leurs terres rebelles seront réintégrées dans notre grande nation par la force !"

 QIE_integration_nice: "Intégration Bénévole"
 QIE_integration_nice_desc: "Alors que les dirigeants rebelles qui ont pris le pouvoir sur une grande partie de la Chine doivent être punis, la paysannerie opprimée ne devrait pas subir le même sort. Au lieu de cela, nous devrions intégrer pacifiquement les anciennes terres rebelles dans notre gouvernement, afin que tous en Chine puissent vivre sous notre règne bienveillant."

 QIE_fractured_empire: "Empire Fracturé"
 QIE_fractured_empire_desc: "L'Empire Qing contrôle théoriquement toute la Chine en dehors de la Mandchourie, du Tibet et de la Mongolie. En réalité, le pouvoir de l'empereur s'étend à peine à l'extérieur des murs de la Cité interdite, tandis que le président Cao Kun est largement impuissant au-delà de l'étage de l'assemblée. Wu Peifu, le véritable pouvoir derrière le trône, est plus intéressé à consolider sa base de pouvoir à Luoyang et à équilibrer les cliques militaires les unes par rapport aux autres qu'à travailler au bien de son pays de manière significative."
 QIE_fractured_empire_removed_tt: "§YEmpire Fracturé§! est supprimé"

 QIE_fractured_empire_manchu:0 "Empire Fracturé"
 QIE_fractured_empire_manchu_desc: "L'Empire Qing contrôle théoriquement toute la Chine en dehors de la Mandchourie, du Tibet et de la Mongolie. En réalité, le pouvoir de l'Empereur s'étend à peine en dehors du bassin du fleuve Jaune. Bien que la clique tyrannique des Zhili ait été évincée, le désordre règne toujours dans le pays. Il faudra encore des mesures réfléchies pour réparer les divisions, même dans notre territoire limité de Chine."

 QIE_big_debt: "Dette Nationale Écrasante"
 QIE_big_debt_desc: "La lutte de la Chine pour développer son économie nationale a entraîné une énorme dette commerciale du gouvernement de Beijing. Les machines industrielles sont importées à un coût exorbitant, et le peu de fabrication nationale qui existe n'a pas la qualité et la quantité pour rivaliser sur le marché mondial. Les principales exportations de la Chine sont donc principalement agricoles, et même les cultures de rente se vendent à des prix bas par rapport aux produits de luxe étrangers largement importés comme les cigarettes et les radios. Ce problème n'est exacerbé que par une corruption institutionnalisée généralisée et un commerce florissant de l'opium."

 QIE_black_monday: "Lundi Noir"
 QIE_black_monday_desc: "Alors que la majeure partie de la Chine a échappé aux vastes retombées économiques du Lundi Noir, l'imbrication de notre économie avec celle de l'Allemagne a légèrement touché la production économique."

 QIE_leadership_crisis: "Crise du commandement de la clique Zhili"
 QIE_leadership_crisis_desc: "L'âge avancé de nombreux commandants supérieurs de Zhili est une tendance inquiétante qui doit être rectifiée bientôt, de peur que notre armée ne soit entièrement contrôlée par des hommes âgés."

 QIE_leadership_crisis_bad: "Aggravation de la crise du commandement"
 QIE_leadership_crisis_bad_desc: "La mort de plusieurs généraux supérieurs de la clique Zhili a encore aggravé notre manque déjà dangereux de visages jeunes (ou même d'âge moyen) au sein de notre haut commandement."

 QIE_outraged_parties: "Assemblée Outragée"
 QIE_outraged_parties_desc: "Suite à notre décision de soutenir la Ligue des huit provinces, l'Assemblée Nationale a émis des protestations indignées. Le paysan moyen ne s'en soucie pas trop, mais nous devons encore agir rapidement pour rétablir la stabilité de notre gouvernement."

 QIE_popular_warlord_idea: "Soutien Populaire pour Wu Peifu"
 QIE_popular_warlord_idea_desc: "Suite à la décision de Wu Peifu d'intervenir en faveur du gouverneur anti-concessionniste Chen Tiaoyuan, il a constaté une nette augmentation du soutien populaire. Bien qu'il soit toujours considéré avec une certaine méfiance dans certains cercles intellectuels, il a acquis une certaine légitimité."

 QIE_defaulted_debt: "A fait défaut sur la dette étrangère"
 QIE_defaulted_debt_desc: "Afin de renforcer la légitimité nationale, nous avons fait défaut sur nos dettes internationales. Les ramifications économiques de ce plan se répercuteront pendant des mois et affecteront presque tous les secteurs de notre économie."

 QIE_harmonious_balance_idea: "Un Équilibre Harmonieux"
 QIE_harmonious_balance_idea_desc: "Notre gouvernement a atteint un objectif rare - former et maintenir un équilibre harmonieux entre le pouvoir spirituel de l'Empereur et le pouvoir temporel de la Clique Zhili."

 QIE_local_logistics: "Logistique Traditionnelle"
 QIE_local_logistics_desc: "Bien que nous ayons peut-être été coupés des innovations occidentales comme la logistique motorisée, la Chine n'a de toute façon jamais eu l'infrastructure pour les soutenir. S'appuyer sur la logistique traditionnelle ne nous rapportera peut-être aucun prix technologique, mais une mule peut traverser le terrain accidenté de cette nation plus facilement qu'un camion."

 QIE_german_bailout: "Renflouement Allemand"
 QIE_german_bailout_desc: "Dans nos moments les plus difficiles, nous avons été obligés de nous tourner une dernière fois vers nos « amis » en Allemagne. Les banques allemandes ont repris notre énorme dette commerciale, l'ont reconditionnée et l'ont vendue à des clients allemands sans méfiance en tant qu'« obligations d'État stables ». Bien que cela résolve nos problèmes financiers, cela a créé une toute nouvelle série de problèmes politiques."

 QIE_diplomatic_genius_idea: "Nouveau Corps Diplomatique"
 QIE_diplomatic_genius_idea_desc: "Wellington Koo, un génie de la diplomatie, est le fer de lance de la création d'un nouveau corps diplomatique pour la république. Avec sa compétence et son expertise, ces nouveaux diplomates devraient contribuer à renforcer notre légitimité."

 QIE_pragmatism_idea: "Pragmatisme"
 QIE_pragmatism_idea_desc: "L'écrivain Hu Shih, aujourd'hui président, est célèbre pour sa théorie du « pragmatisme » - au lieu d'une idéologie sans compromis, il met l'accent sur la coopération et la conciliation, même avec d'anciens ennemis. Cela devrait aider notre gouvernement à établir un contrôle sur la nation fracturée."

 QIE_unprepared_military: "Armée en état d'impréparation"
 QIE_unprepared_military_desc: "Avec notre incapacité à nous préparer face à l'invasion japonaise, notre armée n'est pas préparée à la tempête à venir."

 QIE_rural_insurgency_idea_desc: "Grâce au succès du Mouvement Réformiste Rural, de nombreux paysans ont été gagnés à notre cause, et sont prêts à mourir pour l'Empereur."

 QIE_mandate_heaven_idea: "Mandat du Ciel"
 QIE_mandate_heaven_idea_desc: "Alors que certains pourraient prétendre qu'il s'agit d'une notion dépassée, le Parti Zongshe a rebaptisé avec succès le concept de « Mandat du Ciel » pour lui préférer un cadre plus moderne de théorie politique. Au lieu de mettre l'accent sur le droit divin, une nouvelle propagande met l'accent sur la façon dont l'empereur agit comme une manifestation des forces civiques de la Chine."

 QIE_banner_idea: "Système Moderne de Bannières"
 QIE_banner_idea_desc: "Dans un effort pour moderniser l'armée ad-hoc laissée par la clique Zhili, le parti Zhongshe a tenté de remettre au goût du jour le système de bannières des anciens Empereurs Qing.

Pourtant, comme le Fengtian est actuellement sous la botte des Japonais et le sud a sombré dans le chaos, le gouverneur modèle a décidé de sauter le pas avec le nouveau système constitutionnel. Faisant la promotion d'une industrialisation agressive et d'une politique réformiste, Yan tentera très probablement de faire de l'Empereur une figure de cérémonie."

Alors qu'il ne s'agissait au départ que d'un petit cercle de penseurs politiques, il existe aujourd'hui des clubs politiques qui discutent et distribuent des pamphlets en faveur de la "Société du lavage de cœur" de Xishan.

 QIE_social_democrat_party_long: "Bao Jiu Da Qing Huangdi Hui (Association pour la Réforme du Nouvel Empire Chinois, NCERA en anglais)\n§gLa NCERA, bien qu'elle utilise le nom d'un groupe réformiste d'avant Xinhai, est en fait une alliance de deux groupes réformistes plus modernes. Le premier est le Mouvement de reconstruction rurale, dirigé par Liang Shuming et J.C. "Jimmy" Yen, qui a fait ses études à Harvard et Princeton. Favorisant la reconstruction de la Chine à partir de la base, ce groupe met l'accent sur la valeur du village chinois traditionnel en tant qu'élément de base de la société, plutôt que sur les cliques de seigneurs de la guerre qui ont dominé la Chine au cours du dernier demi-siècle. La deuxième partie de la coalition est un groupe informel d'intellectuels inspirés par les travaux de Kang Youwei, un ambitieux réformateur de la fin de la dynastie Qing qui a plaidé pour une monarchie constitutionnelle. Après la restauration de Puyi, ses œuvres sont revenues sur le devant de la scène et sont populaires parmi les intellectuels urbains de la classe moyenne.

L'Allemagne, qui se méfie également de l'ambition de Wu mais ne veut pas revenir sur son soutien au seul rempart d'un régime impopulaire, s'est attachée à transformer les clubs sociaux informels fréquentés par la nouvelle classe supérieure industrielle en un parti politique organisé, facilitant les connexions entre les élites à travers le pays par le biais \"d'expositions sur le progrès\" organisées par l'AoG, qui mettent en avant un programme de libre-échange ainsi que des techniques agricoles modernes et les technologies les plus récentes. Bien qu'il ne soit pas ouvertement hostile aux ambitions de Wu, la Ligue de Prospérité agit principalement comme un groupe de pression, poussant à l'augmentation du libre-échange, à l'assouplissement des réglementations gouvernementales et à la stimulation industrielle - nominalement pour les intérêts de l'élite - mais réellement pour la Peking-Kommission.

Le président du FSN, Zhang Ximan, a pris l'initiative de fusionner ces groupes éclectiques - marxistes scientifiques, technocrates de Beiyang, réformistes de l'éducation, radicaux féministes, entre autres - en un seul parti politique concret. Contrairement au parti Jeune Chine, qui a longtemps prétendu être la voix de l'intelligentsia politique, le FSN s'aligne davantage sur les universitaires qui s'adonnent à la politique plutôt que sur les spécialistes de la politique, une distinction notable en cette période de tension dans le climat politique chinois.§!"

 QIE_country_intro_header:0 "Le Grand Qing"
 QIE_country_intro_content:0 "La fin de la dernière guerre Zhili-Fengtian en 1928, sous médiation internationale, a mis fin à près de quatre ans de chaos et d'instabilité et a marqué le début de la plus longue période de paix dont ont bénéficié certaines parties de la Chine depuis la révolution Xinhai de 1911. Bien que Wu Peifu et sa clique du Zhili du Nord acceptent le retour de la dynastie Qing, les Allemands refusent d'autres concessions, ce qui entraîne un refroidissement des relations. L'Allemagne continue à soutenir le Gouvernement Qing, mais principalement dans le but d'assurer une concurrence constante avec le Zhili du Sud, également soutenu, dans le cadre d'une stratégie plus large de division et de conquête de la Chine dans son ensemble, ainsi que dans l'espoir de construire progressivement un rempart chinois contre le Japon.\n\nBien que le spectre de la domination japonaise plane sur une grande partie de la Chine du Nord et de l'Est, le pays est néanmoins beaucoup plus divisé que la plupart des à Beijing ne le souhaiteraient, et les Qing voient leur autorité contestée de toutes parts, depuis le défiant Gouvernement Fengtian dans le Nord-Est, jusqu'aux divers alliés ostensibles dans le reste de la Chine ; les composantes nominales de l'Empire se voient accorder une autonomie quasi-totale par la grâce de la géographie et des sentiments régionalistes. En conséquence, les Qing entrent en 1936 largement confinés dans la plaine de Chine du Nord, et à la tête d'un ordre national chancelant."
 qiedom.1.a: "Longue vie à l'Empereur !"

 QIE_country_intro_header_1:0 "La Situation Politique"
 QIE_country_intro_content_1:0 "L'année 1936 voit l'Assemblée impuissante au bord du gouffre. Cinq groupes dominent cet organe du pouvoir, et bien qu'ils n'aient aucun pouvoir dans la chambre, les groupes qui les soutiennent ne doivent pas être pris à la légère. La plus puissante d'entre elles est l'Association Harmonie, dirigée nominalement par le président Cao Kun, un alcoolique déprimé. Le véritable pouvoir du groupe réside cependant entre les mains de Wu Peifu, qui a fondé l'Association en tant qu'outil de légitimation visant à assurer la représentation des Zhili à l'Assemblée. Bien que théoriquement un parti politique indépendant, les députés de l'Association Harmonie sont tous d'anciens officiers Zhili, et après la réélection juridiquement douteuse de Cao Kun, peu de gens pensent que le groupe est autre chose qu'une façade permettant à Wu de contrôler le pays.\n\nLa Ligue de la Prospérité occupe une position similaire, et bien qu'elle prétende être un parti politique, peu la voient comme plus qu'un groupe de pression pour les intérêts allemands à Beijing.\n\nCela laisse trois partis dans l'opposition : le Parti Mandchou, composé de princes Qing et d'anciens partisans royaux, le Parti Jeune Chine, une clique de jeunes officiers de l'académie de Baoding se faisant appeler de la même manière que le Parti Jeune-Turc, et l'Association Réformiste du Nouvel Empire chinois (NCERA) une fusion de deux groupes de réforme qui, bien que fidèles à l'empereur, favorisent une réorganisation structurelle de la Chine pour revenir au modèle traditionnel du village rural et la fin des cliques de seigneurs de la guerre. Alors que ces trois groupes sont opposés à Wu, il leur permet de siéger dans l'assemblée impuissante afin de légitimer son régime impopulaire."
 qiedom.2.a: "Intéressant"

 QIE_country_intro_header_2:0 "Restructuration de la Dette"
 QIE_country_intro_content_2:0 "Au cours des dernières années, Wu et Cao ont dépensé la majeure partie de leur capital politique à tenter de restructurer et de réduire l'énorme dette de l'empire Qing. Bien que cela soit théoriquement possible, ce plan s'est heurté à de nombreux défis, le principal étant le manque de soutien des gouverneurs de province. Les rumeurs d'instabilité dans le sud ont encore compliqué ces plans, et Cao Kun devrait prononcer un discours sur la réduction de la dette nationale à l'Assemblée après les célébrations du Nouvel An, plus tard ce mois-ci."

 qiedom.4.t: "Mort de Wang Chengbin"
 qiedom.4.d: "Plus tôt ce matin, Wang Chengbin, un membre senior de la clique Zhili et un allié majeur de Cao Kun, est mort de vieillesse. Bien que sa mort en elle-même soit un coup dur pour notre structure de commandement, elle révèle une tendance inquiétante. De nombreux hauts responsables militaires de Zhili sont âgés, en mauvaise santé, ou les deux, et la corruption endémique de notre armée empêche les jeunes officiers de gravir les échelons. À moins qu'un effort sérieux ne soit fait, notre haut commandement ne sera bientôt plus composé que de vieillards gâteux et séniles, terrifiés à l'idée de s'approprier de nouvelles technologies et doctrines."
 qiedom.4.a: "N'est-t-on pas censé devenir plus sage en prenant de l'âge?"

 qiedom.5.t: "Répercussions du Lundi Noir"
 qiedom.5.d: "Alors que dans les semaines qui ont suivi le Lundi Noir, il semblerait que nous ayons échappé aux plus lourdes retombées, au cours des derniers jours, les entreprises liées aux allemands ont été confrontées à des problèmes de chaîne d'approvisionnement et à une augmentation des prix. Bien que la perturbation économique soit loin d'atteindre l'ampleur qu'ont connue l'Europe et les Amériques, c'est toujours un coup dur pour notre économie."
 qiedom.5.a: "Bon sang !"

 qiedom.13.t: "Résultats des Élections - Victoire !"
 qiedom.13.d: "Les résultats sont arrivés des régions de la Chine encore suffisamment stables pour organiser des élections. La participation était (comme prévu) assez faible, mais dans des villes comme Beijing, nous avons reçu un nombre record de voix d'intellectuels, de réformateurs et d'autres auparavant opposés à notre régime. Il semble que l'intervention, tout en nous privant du soutien allemand, nous ait donné une grande légitimité et un soutien politique.\n\nAu lendemain de la victoire, le président Cao Kun a annoncé qu'il se retirait pour être remplacé par Yan Huiqing. On ne sait pas quelle influence Wu Peifu a eu sur cette décision, mais il est clair que le maréchal de Jade ne voulait pas que les décisions imbéciles de Cao aient un impact sur le nouveau gouvernement."
 qiedom.13.a: "Nous n'avons pas eu besoin de manipuler ce dernier !"

 qiedom.14.t: "Réunion avec le Zongshe"
 qiedom.14.d: "Après l'annonce de notre attaque de la province d'Anqing, presque tous les délégués à l'Assemblée en dehors de la Ligue de l'Harmonie ont réagi en quittant le bâtiment. Le président Cao Kun a maintenant été chargé de rencontrer les principaux membres du parti Zongshe pour s'assurer de leur loyauté après ce discours.\n\n\"Vous devez comprendre, messieurs, que l'invasion japonaise n'est pas une question de si - c'est une question de quand. Le soutien continu des Allemands est nécessaire pour assurer notre sécurité nationale !\"\n\nCao a d'abord réussi à persuader de nombreux nobles mandchous, mais certains des plus jeunes, comme Gobulo Runqi, ont mal réagi aux ouvertures du Président. Plusieurs heures de négociation plus tard, ils se sont mis d'accord sur une \"pension noble\" versée aux membres de la royauté mandchoue dans le but exprès de préserver la \"culture impériale\". C'est un peu plus qu'un pot-de-vin mais cela maintiendra la paix."
 qiedom.14.a: "Le Président Cao n'est pas étranger à la corruption..."

 qiedom.15.t: "Réunion avec le YCP"
 qiedom.15.d: "Le Young China Party, une alliance de jeunes cadets idéalistes de Baoding et de réformateurs urbains, a réagi avec le plus d'hostilité au discours d'intervention de Cao Kun. Affirmant que l'intervention était une \"capitulation devant des intérêts étrangers\", ils ont été les premiers à quitter la salle de l'assemblée en signe de protestation. Le Président Cao est maintenant chargé de s'assurer de leur loyauté.\n\nAu début, ils ont résisté obstinément à toutes les tentatives de négociation, mais un accord a finalement été conclu. Ils maintiendront leur loyauté en échange d'une autonomie militaire accrue et de la fin de la supervision du programme scolaire de Baoding. Cela entravera nos efforts pour nous assurer de leur loyauté à l'avenir, mais nous avons besoin de leur loyauté maintenant."
 qiedom.15.a: "Espérons que cela les maintienne sous contrôle"

 qiedom.16.t: "Rencontre avec la NCERA"
 qiedom.16.d: "La New Chinese Empire Reform Association a été la dernière à quitter l'Assemblée en signe de protestation, et sera certainement la plus difficile à convaincre de la réintégrer. Représentant principalement les paysans et les fermiers ruraux de Chine, les dirigeants ont une approche paternaliste de leurs électeurs. Le Président Cao est sceptique quant à leur dévouement à la cause réformiste, mais il a néanmoins rencontré Y. C. James Yen, l'un de leurs dirigeants. Yen est d'abord hésitant, mais ils parviennent finalement à trouver un compromis. Les industries contrôlées par le gouvernement à Beijing commenceront à produire des outils agricoles et d'autres aides rurales pour aider les paysans appauvris."
 qiedom.16.a: "Plutôt facile"

 qiedom.17.t: "L'Assemblée revient à la normale"
 qiedom.17.d: "À la suite des négociations et des « cadeaux » du président Cao, les délégués sont tous revenus à l'Assemblée. Toujours impuissant, l'organe peut à nouveau commencer à entériner l'agenda du président et de Wu."
 qiedom.17.a: "Excellent"

 qiedom.18.t: "Les sociétés minières allemandes augmentent leurs opérations au Shanxi Oriental"
 qiedom.18.d: "La région du Shanxi a toujours été riche en charbon et en métaux utiles pour l'Empire. Après la 4e guerre Zhili-Fengtian, nous avons pris le contrôle direct du Shanxi oriental, une mince zone de terre qui appartenait à la clique du Shanxi de Yan Xishan. Notre occupation du Shanxi oriental a été la cause de tensions entre nous et la clique du Shanxi, mais pour l'instant, ils sont incapables de rivaliser avec notre force militaire. Tout comme le reste du Shanxi, cette région est riche en charbon et en fer. De nombreuses entreprises allemandes s'intéressèrent à cette zone et y achetèrent les mines de charbon et de fer. Celles-ci sont situées très près de la frontière avec la clique du Shanxi, mais cela n'a pas encore posé de problème.\n\nCependant, nous venons d'apprendre que ces sociétés du Shanxi oriental vont augmenter leurs opérations minières et que leurs opérations d'agrandissement déborderont sur le territoire contrôlé par le Shanxi. Nous n'avons personnellement pas besoin de nous en inquiéter, mais cela risque de causer des problèmes à la clique du Shanxi, de nombreux paysans se sentant volés parce que ces sociétés allemandes prennent leurs mines."
 qiedom.18.a: "Nous leur souhaitons bonne chance dans leurs entreprises."

 qiedom.19.t: "Scandale !"
 qiedom.19.d: "Le président de l'Assemblée, Cao Kun, vient d'être retrouvé évanoui dans son bureau, affalé sur son bureau avec une bouteille d'alcool. L'alcoolisme de Cao était de notoriété publique, mais jusqu'à présent, il l'a surtout gardé secret. Il semble que le stress de gérer le mécontentement suite à notre intervention en faveur de la clique de Nanjing l'ait finalement fait craquer. Wu Peifu a « persuadé » Cao de démissionner et a promu le diplomate et fonctionnaire vétéran Yan Huiqing pour occuper le poste."
 qiedom.19.a: "Très bien"

 qiedom.20.t: "Démission du Conseil des Légations !"
 qiedom.20.d: "Avec notre nouvelle position anti-Concession, nous avons officiellement démissionné du perfide Conseil des Légations ! Nous ne répondrons plus aux racailles étrangères qui exploitent notre pays pour leur propre intérêt financier !"
 qiedom.20.a: "La Chine aux Chinois !"

 qiedom.21.t: "[QIE.GetName] quitte le Conseil des Légations !"
 qiedom.21.d: "Suite à leur récente adoption d'une position anti-concession, les [QIE.GetName] ont officiellement quitté le Conseil des Légations, le dénonçant comme un « outil de l'impérialisme » ! Alors qu'ils n'avaient qu'un statut d'observateur, cela reste une évolution inquiétante..."

 qielepcollapse.1.t: "La Vente du Chemin de Fer de Zhegan"
 qielepcollapse.1.d: "Les dernières semaines ont vu une grande activité économique dans la Ligue des Huit Provinces, le conglomérat de provinces du sud dirigé par notre subordonné nominal, Sun Chuanfang. Encore plus fortement influencée que nous par le soutien économique allemand, la Ligue vient de terminer la construction d'une voie ferrée majeure, la ligne Zhegan. Bien que financée par les Allemands, elle a été en grande partie construite par la main-d'œuvre chinoise, ce qui a conduit beaucoup à espérer une relation plus équitable entre Allemands et Chinois au sein de la Ligue, du moins dans les affaires économiques.\n\nIl y a quelques jours cependant, dans une initiative surprenante, l'AOG a annoncé publiquement son intention d'acheter et de consolider un certain nombre de chemins de fer de l'Est par l'intermédiaire de leur filiale, la Schantung-Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft - y compris la nouvelle ligne Zhegan.\n\nCette décision a provoqué la colère de nombreux résidents chinois natifs de la Ligue, qui considéraient la ligne Zhegan comme un élément constitutif potentiel d'une relation d'égalité entre Européens et Asiatiques. Des manifestations généralisées ont éclaté, enflammées par des complots de fraude et de détournement de fonds de la part des intimes de Sun."
 qielepcollapse.1.a: "Nous devons garder un œil sur cela"

 qielepcollapse.2.t: "Attaques généralisées contre les étrangers"
 qielepcollapse.2.d: "À la suite des troubles entourant la ligne de chemin de fer de Zhegan, un certain nombre d'investisseurs et d'hommes d'affaires allemands ont été sauvagement attaqués par des foules anti-étrangères enragées. Pour aggraver les choses, des boycotts généralisés des produits allemands ont commencé dans le Sud, et ce matin, des informations sont parvenues à Beijing sur des bombardements de gares à Hangzhou et dans d'autres villes rattachées au Chemin de fer de Chine Centrale Les transports se sont arrêtés dans de nombreuses régions de la Ligue, et les guérilleros du KMT ont profité de cette opportunité pour organiser des attaques de plus en plus audacieuses contre des garnisons isolées de la Ligue.\n\nL'ambassadeur d'Allemagne exige maintenant des comptes, et bien que la Ligue soit largement autonome par rapport à notre contrôle, nous devons encore faire quelque chose. Jiang Baili et d'autres responsables de Zhili ont longtemps poussé à exercer un plus grand contrôle sur la Ligue et exhortent Wu à utiliser cette crise pour exercer un plus grand contrôle sur le sud. Wu n'en est personnellement pas sûr, mais rédige actuellement un télégramme pour demander des comptes à Sun et offrir notre aide s'il en a besoin. (Cela implique de manière informelle une demande de contrôle accru sur les affaires de la Ligue, s'il accepte notre aide.)"
 qielepcollapse.2.a: "Voyons ce que Sun a à dire..."

 qielepcollapse.3.t: "L'incident de Wuhu"
 qielepcollapse.3.d: "Des informations troublantes sont parvenues ce matin à Luoyang et Beijing. Bien que les rapports soient quelque peu contradictoires, il semble qu'il y ait eu une sorte de massacre de manifestants pacifiques par la Ligue et les troupes allemandes en faction dans la ville de Wuhu. Certains prétendent que les troupes allemandes ont simplement ouvert le feu sur les manifestants, tandis que d'autres prétendent qu'un groupe de radicaux du KMT a d'abord attaqué les Allemands et les troupes de la Ligue. Quelle que soit la cause, la ville a sombré dans l'anarchie et des protestations ont éclaté sur tout le territoire de la Ligue.\n\nIroniquement, en même temps que nous recevions ces informations, nous recevions un rapport de Sun affirmant qu'il maîtrisait la situation. Certains généraux Zhili font pression pour une intervention majeure dans le sud si la situation se détériorait davantage, mais Wu n'a pas encore pris de position claire sur la question.\n\nPour ne rien améliorer, un informateur que nous avons placé au sein de la NCERA affirme avoir reçu d'une manière ou d'une autre des informations sur la situation, et prévoit de prononcer un discours cinglant plus tard, au sein de l'Assemblée. Les responsables de la HA (Association Harmonie) tentent de sortir Cao Kun de sa torpeur éthylique et d'écrire un contre-discours, mais nous avons été pris au dépourvu."
 qielepcollapse.3.a: "\"Sous contrôle\", mais oui bien sûr..."

 qielepcollapse.4.t: "Anhui se libère"
 qielepcollapse.4.d: "La province d'Anhui, en état de perpétuelle instabilité sous l'autorité de Sun, a déclaré son indépendance de la Ligue cette semaine. Dans une brochure largement diffusée, le gouverneur Chen Tiaoyuan a affirmé que l'incident de Wuhu "montre que Sun n'est pas capable de gérer cette crise et le décharge officiellement de toute responsabilité dans l'Anhui".\n\nCertains généraux Zhili ont unilatéralement commencé à mobiliser leurs troupes contre les « incursions du KMT », bien que Wu soupçonne à juste titre que leur véritable intention soit l'expansion territoriale. Cherchant à saper leur initiative, il a déclaré ce matin un "état de préparation nationale" à tous les généraux zhili et mandchous, les exhortant à préparer leurs troupes à "tout conflit armé possible". Les troupes confuses de Zhili se sont en grande partie alignées sur Wu et toute attaque prématurée au sud a été effectivement abandonnée avant qu'elle ne commence."
 qielepcollapse.4.a: "Espérons que cela les maintienne dans le droit chemin"

 qielepcollapse.5.t: "Un Télégramme de Nanjing"
 qielepcollapse.5.d: "Le Ministre Wu Peifu a été tiré d'un sommeil agité. \"Sun Chuanfang abattu à 8h55 du matin STOP\nPersonnage inconnu STOP\nDans le coma STOP\nProbable de se réveiller STOP\nEmeutes répandues STOP\nFuite avec de l'or et des documents STOP\"\n\nDeux heures plus tard, Luoyang est devenu un centre d'activité frénétique. Des documents concernant les transactions les plus salaces de Sun avec Beijing brûlent dans les fours, tandis qu'un groupe de hauts fonctionnaires de Zhili se concertent. Dans un geste sans précédent, Wu a invité plusieurs nobles mandchous, notamment le frère de l'empereur, Pujie, à être présents pour rédiger une sorte de déclaration unifiée en réponse à l'assassinat."

 qielepcollapse.6.d: "Faute de ports appropriés dans le nord, la flotte impériale est basée à Nantong depuis la fin du conflit de 1927. Avec les émeutes, les troubles civils et le chaos général qui enveloppent la ville, l'amiral Wu Renli a ordonné à la flotte de quitter la ville et de se diriger vers le nord pour les petits ports que nous contrôlons à l'extérieur de Tianjin. La chute du port de Nanjing signifie également que nous avons perdu les capacités limitées de fabrication navale dont nous disposions."
 qielepcollapse.6.a: "Bon sang !"

 qielepcollapse.7.t: "Chen Tiaoyuan envoie un télégramme"
 qielepcollapse.7.d: "A l'éminent président Cao Kun et au ministre impérial Wu Peifu,\n\nMoi, le gouverneur Chen Tiaoyuan, je demande humblement un financement pour mes troupes. Comme indiqué dans la constitution de notre grande nation, il est de la responsabilité du gouvernement national de fournir des fonds aux gouverneurs provinciaux pour réprimer les troubles. La situation du maréchal de la Ligue Sun à Nanjing n'étant pas claire, j'ai pris la responsabilité de protéger la province d'Anhui contre les bandits et les agitateurs de gauche.\n\nUn télégramme a été remis à Wu Peifu ce matin par le gouverneur d'Anhui Chen Tiaoyuan, de la clique d'Anqing. Bien que le ton de la lettre soit très audacieux, il semble que Chen ait rétabli l'ordre dans la province.\n\nWu est confronté à un choix - Chen serait un puissant allié, mais il a une position ferme contre les concessions. Le soutenir sur le long terme lui aliénerait l'Allemagne, dont le soutien sera essentiel dans l'inévitable guerre contre le Japon. Dans le même temps, prendre position contre l'Allemagne ferait sans aucun doute aimer Wu auprès de la population."
 qielepcollapse.7.a: "Envoyez l'or. Nous avons besoin de stabilité sur nos frontières."
 qielepcollapse.7.b: "Refusez. Pas d'argent pour les rebelles !"
 qie_anti_concessions_decision_warning: "§RLe choix de soutenir Chen Tiaoyuan conduira les Qing sur une voie résolument anti-concessionniste, ce qui signifie qu'il ne pourra pas soutenir la Ligue des Huit Provinces et prendra le parti d'Anqing dans le conflit. Cela garantira également l'hostilité de l'Allemagne. Si Anqing perd le conflit, l'Empire Qing sera très seul.§!\n"

 qielepcollapse.8.t: "Une offre du Maréchal Qi"
 qielepcollapse.8.d: "Suite à notre refus du télégramme du gouverneur Chen, un message est arrivé de Qi Xieyuan - qui s'est déclaré nouveau maréchal de la Ligue des Huit Provinces, succédant à Sun Chuanfang.\n\n'Au plus auspicieux maréchal Wu - Moi, Qi Xieyuan, je demande votre aide pour réprimer la rébellion dans l'Anhui. Comme vous êtes mon lige et mon commandant, il est tout à fait normal que vous m'aidiez en cas de besoin.\n\nLe ton de la demande laisse beaucoup de doutes, car théoriquement Qi devrait pouvoir facilement écraser Anqing et la rébellion du KMT au sud avec l'aide allemande."
 qielepcollapse.8.a: "Écoutons-le - nous pourrions gagner un peu d'influence ici."
 qielepcollapse.8.b: "Nous pouvons gérer cela nous même."

 qielepcollapse.10.a: "Bon sang !"

 qielepcollapse.11.t: "Une autre offre pour Chen ?"
 qielepcollapse.11.d: "Suite à notre refus d'aide au gouverneur d'Anhui Chen Tiaoyuan de la clique d'Anqing, des informations inquiétantes ont commencé à émerger selon lesquelles il aurait contacté Zhang Zuolin, chef du gouvernement rebelle de Fengtian dans le nord-est. Plus inquiétant encore est son utilisation d'un interlocuteur japonais pour "faciliter" la conversation. Plusieurs conseillers de Wu suggèrent que le maréchal recontacte Chen avec une offre de soutien direct dans sa rébellion, de peur que nous ne nous retrouvions avec un pion des Japonais juste à notre porte.\n\nAu-delà du soutien japonais à Chen, cependant, il semble également qu'une non-intervention pourrait conduire à des troubles intérieurs généralisés. Beaucoup dans les partis d'opposition et la Clique Zhili elle-même sont impatients de profiter du chaos de l'effondrement pour saisir l'opportunité d'étendre notre contrôle, et déjà de petites manifestations en faveur de la position anti-concessions du gouverneur Chen ont éclaté dans les zones urbaines. Garder le silence pourrait entraîner une escalade de ces manifestations, déstabilisant davantage notre régime déjà impopulaire."

Comme vous êtes mon lige et mon commandant, il est tout à fait normal que vous m'aidiez en cas de besoin.\"\n\nMalheureusement pour le maréchal Qi, notre engagement envers le gouverneur Chen nous oblige à refuser cette demande."

 qielepcollapse.15.d: "Le gouverneur Chen Tiaoyuan de la clique d'Anqing a accepté notre offre de soutien dans le conflit de la Ligue. Il promet également que toutes les interactions précédentes qu'il a eues avec des agents de Fengtian ou japonais ont été menées « sans son consentement exprès » et que ceux qui ont rencontré les étrangers et les traîtres ont été sommairement punis."

 qielepcollapse.17.d: "Suite à la décision du maréchal Wu d'attaquer le gouvernement de Nanjing, il a ordonné au président Cao Kun de faire une déclaration publique concernant le plan. Diffusé depuis un balcon de la Cité interdite à une grande foule rassemblée en contrebas, il a également été transmis à la radio - une première en Chine.\n\n\"Citoyens ! - Pendant un siècle nous avons souffert sous l'oppression étrangère ! Pendant trop longtemps, nous avons été des larbins des Britanniques, des Allemands et des Américains. Plus jamais ! Aujourd'hui, nous sommes indépendants ! Les armées du Fils du Ciel marchent vers le sud pour détruire le traître maréchal Qi et ses laquais allemands. Nous ne serons plus soumis aux caprices de Berlin. Nous jetons les chaînes du siècle de l'humiliation et disons au monde : la Chine est à nouveau libre !\"\n\nLe discours est accueilli par des applaudissements et des acclamations retentissants, et bientôt des sections de celui-ci sont transcrites dans des brochures et diffusées dans toute la Chine."
 qielepcollapse.17.a: "Peut-être que dorénavant, le peuple ne nous haïra plus ?"

 qielepcollapse.18.t: "La Peking-Kommission se retire de Beijing !"
 qielepcollapse.18.d: "Immédiatement après le discours incendiaire du président Cao, des panaches de fumée ont commencé à sortir des rues devant l'ambassade d'Allemagne et les bureaux de la Peking-Kommission. Une vaste foule s'était formée devant les portes, scandant des slogans anti-concession et brûlant des vêtements, des meubles et même une effigie du Kaiser construite à la hâte. La police et les unités militaires alignées sur la clique Zhili sont rapidement arrivées pour empêcher que la scène ne tourne mal, mais à la tombée de la nuit, la plupart des responsables allemands et leurs complices chinois s'étaient enfuis à Tianjin."
 qielepcollapse.18.a: "Fichez le camp ordures d'étrangers !"

 qielepcollapse.19.t: "Drame à l'Assemblée"
 qielepcollapse.19.d: "Suite à la décision de Wu d'intervenir en faveur du LEP, le Président Cao Kun s'est vu confier la tâche peu enviable d'annoncer la nouvelle à l'Assemblée. \"Chers amis, je vous apporte aujourd'hui d'importantes nouvelles concernant les troubles dans le sud. Le Maréchal Wu, dans son éminente sagesse, a choisi de soutenir le Maréchal Qi dans sa lutte contre le traître gouverneur Chen Tiaoyuan. Les troupes impériales marchent vers le sud pour réprimer les troubles, et nous attendons une réponse rapide et décisi...\"\n\nCao s'est tu lorsque les membres du Parti de la Jeune Chine se sont levés et ont commencé à marcher silencieusement. Peu après, ils ont été suivis par les membres du NCERA et du Parti Zongshe. Bientôt, il ne reste plus que les membres de l'Association de l'Harmonie et de la Ligue de la Prospérité. Cao, abasourdi, termine son discours.\n\n\"Une victoire rapide et décisive. Longue vie à l'Empereur !\" Il ne faut pas être un génie de la politique pour voir que seuls les membres de la Ligue de la Prospérité applaudissent avec enthousiasme."
 qielepcollapse.19.a: "Bâtards !"

 qielepcollapse.20.t: "Soutien Allemand"
 qielepcollapse.20.d: "Les membres de la Ligue de la Prospérité n'ont pas tardé à féliciter le président Cao après son discours, et lors de la réception qui a suivi, des bouteilles de vin rhénan, des cigares cubains et d'autres friandises étrangères ont été offertes à tous ceux qui souhaitaient participer. À la place des nobles mandchous au visage austère qui assistaient normalement à ces réceptions, des représentants de l'ambassade d'Allemagne et de la Peking-Kommission se tenaient dans les derniers costumes berlinois, offrant des cadeaux exorbitants aux législateurs de l'HA et à certains généraux de la clique Zhili qui étaient également présents."
 qielepcollapse.20.a: "Au moins quelqu'un nous apprécie..."

 qielepcollapse.21.t: "Des émeutes généralisées éclatent"
 qielepcollapse.21.d: "Après le silence de Wu et de Cao sur les affaires liées au LEP, de petites protestations ont commencé à émerger, réclamant une intervention. Alors que le silence persistait, ces rassemblements se sont rapidement transformés en grandes manifestations de rue. Cao annonçant enfin qu'il ne soutiendrait ni Qi ni Chen, les manifestations ont finalement dégénéré en émeutes. Beijing et d'autres grandes villes se sont retrouvées paralysées par les troubles, et presque tout le monde, de l'intellectuel le plus riche au vendeur ambulant le plus pauvre, s'est retrouvé dans la rue pour dénoncer le gouvernement. Des théories du complot sauvages ajoutent de l'huile sur le feu selon lesquelles Wu a été payé par la légation allemande pour ne pas intervenir, amenant de nombreux manifestants à clamer des slogans anti-allemands et à brûler des produits de fabrication allemande. Dans un cas, des effigies grossières du Kaiser, de Wu et de Cao ont toutes été brûlées à l'extérieur de la Cité Interdite avant que les coupables ne soient emmenés enchaînés."

 qielepcollapse.24.t: "Des réfugiés fuient le chaos de la Ligue"
 qielepcollapse.24.d: "Alors que des troubles généralisés balaient la Ligue des Huit Provinces, les gouverneurs Jin Yun'e du Henan et Xiao Yaonan ont signalé un nombre croissant de réfugiés affluant dans leurs provinces respectives. Bien que cela ait commencé comme un filet, au cours des derniers jours, le flux a considérablement augmenté, des familles entières fuyant une explosion de violence et de banditisme. Les gouverneurs ont envoyé des télégrammes inquiétants après que certains de leurs hommes ont interrogé des réfugiés, indiquant que l'autorité centrale au sein de la Ligue s'est effondrée bien plus qu'on ne le pensait auparavant. De plus, ils ont demandé de la nourriture et des fournitures supplémentaires pour s'occuper des réfugiés."
 qielepcollapse.24.a: "Terribles nouvelles. Envoyez les provisions."
 qielepcollapse.24.b: "Qui s'en soucie ?"

 qielepcollapse.25.t: "Bain de sang sur le Yangzi !"
 qielepcollapse.25.d: "Malgré tous leurs efforts pour faire face à l'afflux de réfugiés, les gouverneurs de nos provinces du sud sont débordés. À la suite d'une déclaration de loi martiale à l'échelle de la province faite au Hubei, le gouverneur Xiao Yaonan a ordonné à ses troupes de fermer tous les ponts et routes menant à la province depuis le territoire de la Ligue, et de refuser l'entrée à tous les réfugiés. Un grand nombre d'entre eux, cependant, ont commencé à se masser sur un pont sur le fleuve Yangtze, exigeant l'entrée.\n\nBien que cela ait commencé pacifiquement, cela s'est rapidement transformé en une émeute à grande échelle, alors que les réfugiés ont commencé à bombarder les troupes de Xiao de pierres, de bouteilles et d'autres débris. Finalement, un groupe d'hommes qui s'étaient en quelque sorte armés d'armes volées a commencé à tirer sur les troupes de Xiao, qui ont riposté en ouvrant le feu avec des mitrailleuses. Ceux qui n'ont pas été touchés par la tempête de balles ont fui, bousculant d'autres réfugiés et laissant leurs amis et leur famille morts ou mourants sur le pont. Cette scène macabre se répète le long de notre frontière avec la Ligue, alors que des foules de réfugiés ont commencé à entrer de force sur notre territoire."
 qielepcollapse.25.a: "Mauvaises nouvelles."

 qielepcollapse.26.t: "Les Gouverneurs du Sud rompent le contact"
 qielepcollapse.26.d: "Face à l'escalade quotidienne de la violence dans la Ligue, les gouverneurs du Yunnan et du Guangdong, [YUN.GetLeader] et Chen Jiongming, ont cessé de répondre aux demandes officielles d'informations et de mises à jour sur ce qui se passe sur leur territoire. Ils méprisent depuis longtemps notre gouvernement et, bien que cette décision ne soit pas inattendue, elle représente un changement complet dans leur attitude officielle à l'égard de notre gouvernement. Nombreux sont ceux qui, dans le cercle rapproché de Wu, craignent que cela n'annonce un effondrement complet de notre autorité, et les nouvelles de ce matin en provenance du Shanxi confirment ces inquiétudes.\n\nLe traître Feng Yuxiang, retranché avec ses hommes dans les collines du nord du Shaanxi, a formellement dénoncé les actions de notre gouvernement dans ce que l'on appelle désormais "l'incident du Yangtze" survenu au début de la semaine, lorsque les forces du gouverneur Wang Huaiqing ont tiré sur une foule de réfugiés et proclamé que les Qing n'avaient plus la "capacité de gouverner la Chine". Son allié nominal à Taiyuan, le gouverneur Yan Xishan, a décrié la violence mais s'est abstenu de nous condamner ou de reconnaître le gouvernement Fengtian, mais il est clair que l'ordre national est en train de s'effondrer."

 qielepcollapse.27.d: "Le gouverneur Chen a adressé ses sincères remerciements au maréchal Wu Peifu, félicitant son ministère pour son dévouement à la solidarité chinoise. Le gouverneur Chen promet que sa défense de la souveraineté chinoise marque la fin de l'ingérence occidentale dans la vallée du Fleuve Jaune, et a généreusement soutenu la croyance de Wu Peifu en la supériorité chinoise sur les forces AOG auxquelles ils sont confrontés."
 qielepcollapse.27.a: "Il est le très bienvenu."

 qielepcollapse.28.t: "Nous avons été trahis par Chen"
 qielepcollapse.28.d: "Malgré les efforts de Wu pour calmer diplomatiquement le gouverneur Chen, il semble désormais hors de notre portée. Un garde-frontière a découvert des réfugiés arrivant sur les terres de Qing et portant des pamphlets de la tristement célèbre société paramilitaire japonaise du Dragon Noir. Maintenant dans le vide du silence des dirigeants d'Anqing viennent des impressions plus inquiétantes. Le gouverneur Chen Yi, tristement célèbre pour son association avec les Dragons noirs, a été repéré à Anqing par d'autres réfugiés. Il est fort probable que le Gouverneur Chen ait trahi non seulement les Maréchaux Wu et Puyi, mais aussi la nation chinoise elle-même en permettant aux espions japonais d'entrer dans sa ville."

Initialement limitée à critiquer l'inaction de Wu, l'aggravation de la violence dans les rues a conduit beaucoup à se révolter. Les réseaux sociaux entre ces groupes ont permis à une coalition fragile de se développer. Composé de nobles mandchous, de cadets de l'académie de Baoding, de réformateurs de la NCERA et de quelques généraux Zhili agacés par l'inaction de Wu, ce groupe perfide a commencé à se parler clandestinement et à comploter pour renverser Wu et restaurer l'empereur à un certain degré de pouvoir."

Le premier est Pujie, frère de l'empereur et général de l'armée, l'un des rares généraux non zhili autorisés à commander un nombre important de troupes. À ses côtés, Y. C. James Yen, intellectuel de premier plan et directeur de la NCERA. En face de lui se trouve Xing Shilian, un officier de l'armée qui a fait défection du côté des Zhili lors de la troisième guerre de ZhiFeng, mais qui est depuis mécontent de son manque d'avancement sous les ordres de Wu Peifu.\n\nRéalisant qu'ils sont incapables de vaincre la clique Zhili seuls avec leurs ressources militaires limitées, les comploteurs décident de demander l'aide du chef d'une clique de seigneurs de la guerre voisine.

Un groupe de princes mandchous, de réformateurs et de militaires mécontents complotent secrètement pour renverser le maréchal Wu Peifu et restaurer l'empereur Puyi ! Ils cherchent apparemment une aide extérieure et sont venus demander de l'aide au gouverneur Yan Xishan. Leur plan est audacieux et le messager a du mal à dissimuler son excitation. Néanmoins, le gouverneur Yan n'est pas étranger aux initiatives audacieuses et, au cours des trois décennies et demie qu'a duré son mandat, il a vu de nombreux projets de ce type tomber à l'eau. Plusieurs fois à Beijing, notamment. Alors que Feng Yuxiang cause déjà des problèmes à Yan'an et que ce complot n'en est qu'à ses débuts, il y a un risque considérable à mettre tout son poids dans la balance. À tout le moins, il mettra en péril la paix fragile qui a été conclue entre la clique du Shanxi et le gouvernement central. Mais l'audace est parfois le seul moyen de survivre et, compte tenu de l'évolution de la situation en Chine du Nord, il n'y a peut-être pas de mal à les écouter."

 qiecoup.6.d: "Le gouverneur Yan a répondu à notre demande, à sa manière habituelle, charismatique mais rusée, en offrant des cadeaux et en charmant le jeune messager que nous avons envoyé, au point que les observateurs le considèrent comme un vieux grand-père sympathique. Mais sous ce masque, l'homme affirmait sa domination et sa ruse. Traitant le noble comme les nombreux autres qui sont venus avant lui pour demander une faveur, son attitude joviale dissimulait à peine sa nature calculatrice, tandis que le "gouverneur modèle", qui a régné pendant des décennies, lisait sa marque.\n\nÀ la fin de la réunion, comme notre représentant l'a rapidement fait savoir à ses collègues conspirateurs à Beijing, les termes étaient sans ambiguïté. Yan Xishan occupe déjà une position distinguée (même si elle suscite la méfiance) en tant que gouverneur dans le système de Wu Peifu, et il n'a pas grand-chose à gagner en soutenant notre proposition risquée, à moins que nous ne lui offrions quelque chose de plus grand. Bien qu'il ait pris soin de ne jamais le dire ouvertement, il est clair qu'il s'attend à des pouvoirs complets et autocratiques si notre complot réussit.\n\nDe plus, il attend la preuve que notre complot peut réussir, qu'il est autre chose qu'une chimère d'aristocrates gâtés et déconnectés de la réalité politique. Notre messager, bien qu'il joue le rôle d'un apaiseur naïf, est assez perspicace : il prévient que si Yan est extrêmement ambitieux, son ambition est tempérée par son pragmatisme. Néanmoins, il serait difficile pour un homme comme lui de résister à la perspective alléchante d'un contrôle national. En élaborant notre réponse, il est essentiel de maîtriser notre cible. Le gouverneur peut être aussi mercantile que calculateur, et ce que nous dirons déterminera probablement sa réponse."
 qiecoup.6.a: "Jouer sur son ambition, souligner son futur rôle de "Maître de la Chine"."

Le message a été lu au gouverneur lors d'une réunion secrète à laquelle n'ont assisté que les conseillers triés sur le volet de Yan. Dans ce message, les conspirateurs mandchous, apparemment soutenus par l'empereur lui-même, nous ont gratifiés d'éloges et d'adulations fleuries, nous présentant comme le leader héroïque dont la Chine a besoin pour vaincre le perfide Wu Peifu. Ils soulignent tout le bien que nous pourrions faire à la nation chinoise, en chassant les impérialistes étrangers et en diffusant dans tout le pays les idées que nous avons développées dans notre "province modèle". Pour tout cela, nous accepterions le rôle de commissaire impérial et de commandant en chef de l'armée impériale. La lettre se poursuit avec de nombreux détails sur les préparatifs en cours à Pékin, mais à ce moment-là, le gouverneur a clairement pris sa décision. Un léger sourire se dessine sur son visage, qui serait passé inaperçu si les personnes présentes ne l'avaient pas connu depuis des années. Ce qui est plus visible, c'est la lueur dans ses yeux, qui sont manifestement remplis d'une ambition fulgurante. Ses conseillers n'ont pas tardé à s'aligner sur son humeur, tandis que le gouverneur prenait le temps de réfléchir en silence, soulignant les opportunités que ce coup d'État apporterait pour au moins réduire la taille des Zhili, le besoin de stabilité dans les Plaines centrales, la probabilité que le complot réussisse. Enfin, Yan leva la main pour les faire taire et fit connaître son opinion :"

 qiecoup.8.d: "Nous avons reçu une réponse de nos contacts à Beijing, exposant leurs arguments en faveur de notre soutien. Le message a été lu au gouverneur lors d'une réunion secrète à laquelle n'ont assisté que les conseillers triés sur le volet de Yan. Les comploteurs mandchous, apparemment soutenus par l'empereur lui-même, y dressent le tableau d'une nation en péril, déstabilisée par la direction insensée de l'ivrogne Cao Kun et de l'intrigant Wu Peifu. Sans ordre, la nation tombera bientôt dans l'anarchie, et la lettre était très chargée en thèmes confucéens. En ces temps difficiles, un homme fort et sage doit assumer le rôle de commissaire impérial pour diriger les armées de l'Empire contre ceux qui veulent le détruire. Cet homme, c'est le "gouverneur modèle" du Shanxi, Yan Xishan.\n\nAvant qu'aucun de ses conseillers n'ait pu dire un mot, tous ont prêté une attention particulière à l'humeur de Yan. Le gouverneur affichait une expression maussade tandis que la salle restait silencieuse, les rouages de son esprit étant en train de tourner. Tous ses anciens collaborateurs ont rapidement compris ce qu'il voulait entendre et ont commencé à dénoncer la lettre - son manque d'utilité, l'instabilité qu'elle provoquerait, les risques qu'elle pose pour notre pouvoir, l'hypocrisie d'un empereur imposé par l'étranger qui condamne la collaboration de Wu Peifu avec les Allemands. Toujours contemplatif, le gouverneur fait au moins connaître son opinion :"

 qiecoup.9.d_yan: "Bien que notre message ait été clair quant à la nécessité nationale urgente de l'intervention du gouverneur Yan, sa réponse n'a été rien d'autre qu'un refus sec et la coupure immédiate de tout contact entre nous et Taiyuan. Le Shanxi ne viendra pas à notre aide, et il n'a même pas eu la décence d'expliquer pourquoi. Rétrospectivement, nous ne pouvons que deviner. Il semble que le gouverneur n'ait guère confiance dans la capacité de notre coup d'État à réussir et qu'il nous ait rapidement rejetés comme un groupe d'aristocrates gâtés et de rêveurs. Au lieu de cela, il semble que le Shanxi va se replier dans l'isolement, défiant les Zhili de riposter. Pire encore, il semble que Wu Peifu ait eu vent de ces tentatives par l'intermédiaire d'un comploteur découragé, qui a informé le maréchal après le refus de Yan. Dans le dernier message qu'il nous a adressé, le gouverneur a clairement indiqué qu'il n'hébergerait aucun d'entre nous dans sa province en tant que fugitifs, nous abandonnant ainsi à notre sort. D'aucuns pensent que nous avons été trahis par Wu Peifu et par Yan lui-même, qui se lave à présent de cette situation. Peu importe, puisque notre complot s'effondre sous nos yeux !"

 qiecoup.9.a: "Bon sang ! Nous avons raté notre seul coup ! Notre seule opportunité !"

 qiecoup.10.t: "Yan accepte notre offre"
 qiecoup.10.d: "Après quelques délibérations, le gouverneur Yan Xishan a annoncé son soutien à notre cause dans un humble message consacrant sa personne, son armée et sa province à l'unification nationale chinoise. Sous cette attitude extérieurement humble, cependant, il est clair que Yan se prépare à tirer parti de son statut de principal initiateur du coup d'État, pour assurer son propre leadership de la nation - en prenant la place de Wu Peifu lui-même. Le fait de savoir qu'il est ou non meilleur que les tyrans précédents sous lesquels nous avons servi et qu'il partagera son nouveau pouvoir est une question qui devra attendre un autre jour, alors que les préparatifs du coup d'état commencent.\n\nDans le nord du Shaanxi et la province voisine du Shanxi, Yan nous a assuré qu'il s'assurerait le soutien de Feng Yuxiang et de son Guominjun. Néanmoins, il a également souligné que ces traîtres radicaux ne sont rien de plus qu'un moyen pour lui de parvenir à ses fins. Sa propre armée provinciale se rassemble dans l'ouest, et se prépare à frapper au nord du fleuve Jaune pour se connecter rapidement avec nos propres forces. Des éclaireurs sont déjà envoyés dans l'est du Shanxi et le sud du Shaanxi pour déstabiliser le contrôle des Zhili sur ces régions.\n\nAvec le coup d'État en cours, les dés sont jetés. Soit nous débarrasserons Beijing de ces traîtres du Zhili une fois pour toutes, soit nous rencontrerons notre destin entre leurs mains."
 qiecoup.10.a: "Espérons que cela fonctionne !"

 qiecoup.11.t: "Qu accepte"
 qiecoup.11.d: "Le gouverneur Qu a accepté la demande d'aide des putschistes. Il accepte de déployer ses troupes si la clique de Zhili n'est pas complètement détruite lors du coup d'État. Dans le même temps, cependant, il exigera probablement des concessions une fois que Puyi aura été rétabli dans sa position appropriée."
 qiecoup.11.a: "Excellent !"

 qiecoup.12.a: "Excellent !"

 qiecoup.13.t: "Un complot est découvert !"
 qiecoup.13.d: "Une étrange conspiration a été révélée à Wu Peifu! Apparemment, un groupe de princes mandchous mécontents, de réformateurs et de généraux Zhili complotent clandestinement pour renverser la clique Zhili et restaurer Puyi sur le trône ! Un membre de ce complot, mécontent d'avoir été lâché par son soutien étranger, a renoncé au complot et s'en est ouvert à Wu, trahissant ainsi ses anciens alliés.\n\nWu a déjà envoyé des policiers pour faire une descente dans les refuges où les comploteurs se sont réunis et a arrêté un Puyi confus, qui n'était apparemment au courant d'aucun complot ! Le président Cao Kun s'est rendu devant une assemblée stupéfaite où il a annoncé les charges, avant d'annoncer sa démission de honte pour n'avoir pas découvert le complot. Avec la fin de la dynastie Qing, le maréchal Wu Peifu agira en tant que « protecteur national » temporaire jusqu'à ce qu'un nouveau gouvernement puisse être formé."
 qiecoup.13.a: "Longue vie au Protecteur National !"

 qiecoup.14.t: "Purge des Traîtres"
 qiecoup.14.d: "L'aristocratie mandchoue ayant été éliminée en tant que force politique, il reste maintenant à savoir ce qu'il faut faire avec les généraux mandchous de notre armée. La réponse évidente est de les emprisonner, mais alors qu'en est-il de tous les généraux Zhili qui se sont rangés de leur côté ? Plusieurs sont très compétents, et les retirer de notre pool d'officiers aurait des conséquences. Pourtant, cela garantirait la loyauté à l'avenir."
 qiecoup.14.a: "Ne purgez que les nobles Mandchous. Le reste peut être réhabilité."
 qiecoup.14.b: "Purgez-les tous !"

 qiecoup.15.t: "Les Conséquences"
 qiecoup.15.d: "Avec les comploteurs royalistes mandchous éliminés, nous devons maintenant nous tourner vers la reconstruction de notre gouvernement. Ce ne sera pas facile, mais un nouveau corpus de lois doit être rédigé pour rectifier les erreurs de la Constitution de Beiyang et garantir que la Chine sera correctement guidée à travers ces années turbulentes."
 qiecoup.15.a: "Nous devons mettre en place un gouvernement légitime !"

 qiecoup.16.t: "Mouvements de troupes inquiétants"
 qiecoup.16.d_yan: "Des mouvements de troupes inhabituels ont été signalés dans la province de Shanxi ces derniers jours. Il semble que les troupes se préparent à une sorte d'action militaire à notre frontière, nos informateurs signalant que des fournitures et de l'équipement sont stockés près des cols de montagne à l'extérieur du Shanxi. Plus à l'ouest, dans le Shaanxi adjacent, Feng Yuxiang et son Guominjun ont également été signalés comme actifs - une fois de plus, le "général traître" ose nous menacer avec sa coterie d'agitateurs socialistes. Comme des fantômes du passé, les deux seigneurs de guerre reviennent nous hanter, après avoir été battus par le génie de Wu Peifu il y a quelques années lors de la quatrième guerre de Zhifeng et de l'expédition septentrionale du Kuomintang.\n\nUne attaque de leur part en ces temps troublés pour tenter de regagner leurs terres perdues au nord et à l'ouest n'aurait rien d'anormal pour eux, peut-être enhardis par l'effondrement de nos alliés au sud. Mais c'est tout de même effronté, même pour eux. Tous deux semblaient se contenter de panser leurs plaies derrière la forteresse naturelle que constituent les monts Taihang et Luliang, se complaisant dans leur misère pathétique pendant des décennies, dans une paix relative. Cao Kun insiste sur le fait que quelque chose a déclenché cette réaction. Bien que le mauvais traitement qu'il a subi lors de son emprisonnement par Feng Yuxiang contribue sans aucun doute à sa paranoïa, il est peut-être sur la bonne voie."
 qiecoup.16.d_qu: "Des mouvements de troupes inhabituels ont été signalés dans la province de Shandong ces derniers jours. Il semble que d'importantes formations de troupes se préparent à une sorte d'action militaire à notre frontière, nos informateurs signalant que des fournitures et des équipements sont stockés près des cols montagneux hors de la péninsule. Le gouverneur Qu nous a techniquement juré fidélité, mais les coups bas ne sont pas inhabituels chez les chefs de guerre..."
 qiecoup.16.d_zhang: "Des mouvements de troupes inhabituels ont été signalés dans la province du Shandong au cours des derniers jours. Il semble que de nombreuses troupes de miliciens de Yiguandao se préparent à une sorte d'action militaire à notre frontière, nos informateurs signalant que des fournitures et du matériel sont stockés près des cols de montagne hors de la péninsule. L'honorable Maître Zhang Tianran du Yiguandao n'est certainement pas un allié de la clique Zhili, et une attaque sur notre territoire ne serait pas hors de question pour lui."
 qiecoup.16.a: "Que se passe-t-il ici ? Envoyez plus d'espions pour enquêter."
 qiecoup.16.b: "Nous avons des affaires plus urgentes à régler."

 qiecoup.17.t: "Machinations Sournoises !"
 qiecoup.17.d_yan: "Nos informateurs ont découvert un dangereux complot ! Il semble que Yan Xishan et plusieurs princes mandchous, réformateurs et généraux traîtres tentent de renverser la clique Zhili et d'instaurer une dictature impériale (en apparence) sous la direction de Puyi ! Avec les forces combinées de l'armée provinciale du Shanxi et du Guominjun qui s'amassent le long de notre frontière, il est essentiel que nous nous débarrassions de tout cinquième colonne au sein de notre gouvernement avant que les forces extérieures ne frappent. Toute démonstration de faiblesse invitera d'autres adversaires du nord-est et du sud, réduisant ainsi à néant les efforts que nous avons déployés pendant des décennies pour stabiliser notre nation. Une attaque rapide et décisive contre les traîtres du Shanxi est le seul moyen d'affirmer notre autorité face au désastre de Sun Chuanfang. Nous marchons sur Taiyuan !"
 qiecoup.17.d_qu: "Nos informateurs ont découvert un dangereux complot ! Il semblerait que Qu Yingguang et plusieurs princes mandchous, réformateurs et généraux traîtres tentent de renverser la clique du Zhili et de restaurer Puyi ! Nous devons nous en occuper rapidement !"

 qiecoup.18.d: "Des nouvelles inquiétantes ! Il semble qu'au cours des derniers jours, des tracts anti-zhili et anti-allemands aient été découverts et distribués parmi certaines de nos troupes ! Lorsqu'on leur a demandé d'où provenaient ces tracts, aucun d'entre eux n'a été en mesure de donner une réponse claire, la plupart affirmant qu'ils étaient apparus du jour au lendemain.\n\nPlus inquiétant encore, plusieurs généraux ont perdu le contact avec Luoyang au cours des dernières heures. Pire encore, l'Académie militaire de Baoding semble avoir été abandonnée pendant la nuit, et les communications avec les régions éloignées de l'empire ont été interrompues en raison de pannes radio et téléphoniques généralisées."
 qiecoup.18.a: "Mais que se passe-t-il ici ?"

 qiecoup.19.t: "Une Convocation à Beijing"
 qiecoup.19.d: "Alors que Wu tente de régler les développements alarmants survenus ces derniers jours, un télégramme urgent est arrivé de Beijing. Cao Kun et Wu ont été convoqués à une réunion en présence de l'Empereur, sur l'état du pays. Les émeutes généralisées sont quotidiennes, et bien que l'Empereur ait techniquement la prérogative constitutionnelle de convoquer son président, cela ne s'est jamais produit. Alors que Wu peut pressentir un piège, Cao Kun a déjà informé l'Empereur que lui et Wu se présenteraient à Sa Majesté Impériale plus tard dans la semaine."
 qiecoup.19.a: "Soit maudit Cao Kun !"

 qiecoup.20.t: "Wu et Cao se préparent à rencontrer Puyi"
 qiecoup.20.d: "Après son arrivée depuis Luoyang, Wu a réprimandé Cao pour s'être littéralement jeté dans un piège. Pourtant, le Maréchal de Jade n'est pas du genre à se lancer dans une réunion comme celle-ci sans un atout dans sa manche. Alors que les deux hommes se préparent à entrer dans la salle, Wu ordonne à ses gardes du corps d'attendre devant l'entrée des chambres. Les gardes du corps de cérémonie à l'extérieur ne sont pas armés, à l'exception des épées traditionnelles, et les soldats de Zhili ont des pistolets cachés dans leurs poches..."
 qiecoup.20.a: "Ils entrent dans la salle..."

 qiecoup.21.t: "Les gardes se ruent à leur tour dans la salle !"
 qiecoup.21.d: "Alors que les deux hommes entrent et s'agenouillent devant l'Empereur, une douzaine de gardes mandchous lourdement armés se précipitent dans la pièce ! Entourant l'Empereur, ils s'avancent et tentent d'arrêter les deux hommes, tandis que Puyi s'enfuit de la pièce ! En entendant l'agitation, les gardes du corps de Wu à l'extérieur dispersent rapidement les gardes de cérémonie et se précipitent à l'intérieur, tandis que Wu et Cao se cachent derrière des piliers pour éviter d'être touchés. Les balles sifflent entre les anciens piliers de la salle, brisant des artefacts inestimables et blessant Cao Kun. Lorsque les balles s'arrêtent, cependant, un camp sort vainqueur."
 qiecoup.21.a: "Wu et Cao sont tués ! Le Coup d'État réussit !"
 qiecoup.21.b: "Les gardes du corps mandchous gisent morts sur le sol !"

 qiecoup.22.t: "L'Empereur se légitimise lui-même"
 qiecoup.22.d: "Puyi revient nerveusement dans la pièce, regardant les corps criblés de balles de l'ancien maréchal de Jade et de son mentor, le président Cao Kun. Pujie et un autre petit groupe de gardes loyalistes mandchous entrent à leur tour, tous munis de mitraillettes. Très cher frère, je crois qu'il est temps pour vous de faire un discours. Puyi se détourne des cadavres et regarde Pujie. Il commence par dire : "Je...", d'une voix incertaine. Je ne suis pas sûr de pouvoir le faire. Pujie est sur le point de dire quelque chose lorsque le général Xiqia fait irruption dans la pièce.\n\nMonseigneur ! La ville est en sécurité ! Il dit en s'inclinant presque jusqu'au sol face à Puyi. Mais Jiang Baili et plusieurs autres généraux zhili se sont retirés à Luoyang ! Ils prévoient de lancer une campagne pour nous détruire et libérer Beijing". Pujie s'approche de Puyi et lui chuchote à l'oreille. Tu es l'empereur maintenant, tu dois te comporter comme tel ! Puyi tente nerveusement de se ressaisir. Moi, l'empereur Xuantong, fils du ciel, je proclame officiellement que tous les membres de la clique de Zhili qui ne me jurent pas fidélité d'ici demain..." Sa voix se brise, et il est obligé de se stabiliser. Sa voix se brise, et il est forcé de se stabiliser. "Ceux qui ne l'auront pas fait avant demain midi seront considérés comme des traîtres au Grand Qing"."

 qiecoup.23.t: "Nous honorons notre obligation"
 qiecoup.23.d: "Nous avons appris de Beijing que le plan de coup d'État s'est déroulé sans accroc ! Wu Peifu et Cao Kun ont été tués dans une fusillade dans la Cité Interdite, et les généraux mandchous et certains Zhili qui ont déserté mobilisent leurs forces pour détruire ceux qui sont fidèles à l'ancien régime. Il est temps d'honorer nos obligations envers l'Empereur et de détruire ces traîtres !"
 qiecoup.23.a: "Détruisez les Traîtres !"

 qiecoup.24.t: "Le Contre coup d'état"
 qiecoup.24.d: "Après que Cao et Wu aient échappé de justesse à la mort dans la Salle du Trône, les gardes du corps de Wu se dispersent dans le palais, les coups de feu résonnant dans les couloirs alors qu'ils rencontrent une résistance sporadique des loyalistes mandchous. Quelques minutes plus tard, ils font irruption dans la salle du trône, entraînant avec eux un Puyi terrifié. Wu, debout au-dessus de Puyi prostré, fait signe à un garde du corps. Dégainant un pistolet, il attrape Puyi derrière lui et le conduit vers la porte. A l'extérieur, un petit groupe de courtisans et d'assistants se sont rassemblés, ainsi que le frère de l'Empereur, Pujie, et plusieurs autres nobles Qing. Ouvrant la porte de la salle d'audience, Wu s'avance, flanqué de l'Empereur et de son ravisseur.\n\n\"Votre complot a échoué, traîtres.\" Il déforme sa bouche en un sourire en coin, avant de faire signe au garde du corps de ramener l'empereur dans la pièce. \"Un pas en avant - et le Fils du Ciel meurt.\"\n\nSecrètement, Wu est terrifié. Mais ce ne sera pas la première fois qu'il trompe la mort. \"Vous allez tous entrer dans la salle du trône, où mes gardes s'assureront que vous êtes bien surveillés. Président Cao !\" Il se tourne vers le chef de l'Assemblée, qui à ce stade s'est lui-même retiré dans la pièce. \"Prenez quelques gardes et allez à la salle de l'Assemblée aussi vite que possible !\" Il jette un regard en arrière à Puyi. \"Le temps est venu de mettre fin à l'Empire. La Chine sera à nouveau une République.\"\n\nQuelques heures plus tard, après que les troupes du Zhili aient fait une descente dans les salles de complot, des documents impliquant des chefs de guerre voisins sont découverts. Wu s'empresse de les déclarer immédiatement traîtres et de mobiliser ses troupes pour la guerre."
 qiecoup.24.a: "Mort aux Traîtres !"

 qiecoup.25.t: "Victoire !"
 qiecoup.25.d: "Des rapports sont revenus au Palais Impérial indiquant que nos troupes ont atteint le Fleuve Jaune. Les garnisons éparpillées du Zhili autour de Beijing se sont avérées peu efficaces face aux armées dirigées par Baoding, et les loyalistes mandchous du Général Zaitao ont aidé à harceler les troupes du Zhili qui tentaient de fuir vers Luoyang. De nombreuses troupes ont tout simplement déserté pour rejoindre nos forces, car l'idée de servir une armée sans chef et avec peu de soutien politique n'était pas très attrayante.\n\nNos forces sont maintenant prêtes à lancer un assaut sur Luoyang, l'ancien bastion de Wu Peifu, actuellement défendu par les forces du Général Jiang Baili, le commandant en second de Wu. La sécurisation de cette forteresse sera le début de la fin pour la Clique Zhili."
 qiecoup.25.a: "Longue vie au Fils du Ciel !"

 qiecoup.26.t: "Victoire à Luoyang !"
 qiecoup.26.d: "Un télégramme est arrivé ce matin de Luoyang, confirmant que nos troupes ont réussi à prendre d'assaut les murs de la ville fortifiée. Après des heures de bombardements d'artillerie concentrés, les troupes loyales ont traversé la rivière dans des barges improvisées, essuyant des tirs nourris. Une fois à terre, cependant, elles ont rapidement pris le contrôle d'une tête de pont, ce qui a permis à un nombre croissant de nos troupes de débarquer et d'attaquer les unités zhili en garnison dans la ville. Se battant dans les anciennes grottes et les temples qui parsèment la ville, nos troupes ont fini par prendre d'assaut le quartier général des Zhili. La plupart des généraux ont réussi à s'échapper, mais plusieurs dirigeants importants, comme Jiang Baili, ont disparu, probablement morts parmi les milliers d'autres soldats pris au piège dans la ville en flammes. Les troupes restantes de Zhili se sont dispersées dans la campagne environnante, pillant et saccageant tout en fuyant nos forces."

 qiecoup.27.d: "Les dernières semaines ont été marquées par des combats intenses dans le sud de notre territoire, alors que les partisans inconditionnels de Wu Peifu et de la clique Zhili étaient pourchassés et détruits. Les combats sur toutes les routes menant à Wuhan se sont révélés particulièrement vicieux, alors que les derniers restes du commandement Zhili se préparent à organiser un combat désespéré dans la ville antique. Une fois les garnisons isolées détruites, nous pourrons nous concentrer sur la sécurisation de cette ville, et la destruction définitive de Zhili."
 qiecoup.27.a: "Longue vie au Fils du Paradis !"

 qiecoup.28.t: "Victoire à Wuchang !"
 qiecoup.28.d: "Lors d'un dernier assaut général, nos forces, renforcées par des rangs de déserteurs Zhili, ont finalement pris d'assaut Wuhan, détruisant les forces restantes de la clique de Zhili et capturant ou tuant de nombreux généraux de haut rang. Avec la victoire enfin assurée, nous pouvons maintenant commencer à nous concentrer sur la reconstruction de notre pays, et le préserver à la fois des ravages du conflit que nous venons de subir et des décennies de corruption endémique auxquelles nous avons été soumis sous le gouvernement Zhili."

 qiecoup.29.d: "À la suite de nos récents bouleversements, la Ligue de la Prospérité s'est brusquement dissoute, invoquant une « atmosphère hostile », avec nombre de leurs éminents lobbyistes partant pour Tianjin. Alors que la légation allemande reste à Beijing, elle s'est coupée de tout contact avec le gouvernement, nous privant du soutien militaire et industriel allemand. Cependant, le peuple est massivement en faveur de cette décision et félicite le nouveau gouvernement de s'être débarrassé des influences étrangères."

 qieelection.3.d: "La réforme constitutionnelle a été accueillie favorablement par de nombreux progressistes qui ont salué l'élargissement des droits et l'amélioration de l'efficacité du gouvernement, tout en satisfaisant la noblesse mandchoue qui souhaite préserver l'autorité institutionnelle de l'empereur. Dans les campagnes, Yan Yangchu et Liang Shuming ont lancé des campagnes d'alphabétisation réussies parmi la paysannerie, ce qui a permis d'améliorer l'accès à l'éducation et de rétablir les liens entre les villages de l'Empire. Les réformes dans les campagnes ont également permis de réduire considérablement la pression sur la bureaucratie impériale en favorisant l'autonomie locale. De manière quelque peu ironique, cette stratégie de décentralisation politique a apparemment amélioré la cohésion de l'Empire.\n\nCette renaissance démocratique a entraîné une diminution de l'influence des Zongshe au point qu'ils sont devenus politiquement insignifiants. Alors que les appels à la réforme se font de plus en plus pressants, la vieille garde conservatrice se retrouve de plus en plus déconnectée et incapable de proposer une politique significative. Constamment sapés et réduits au silence dans tout discours politique, leur lumière n'éclaire clairement plus les allées du pouvoir.\n\nLes quatre dernières années ont également donné naissance à différentes voix en politique. L'une des plus bruyantes est celle du Parti de la Jeunesse Chinoise. Le PJC est politiquement conservateur et met l'accent sur la tradition chinoise, mais il insiste sur la nécessité d'une mobilisation de masse et d'une collaboration de classe, le citoyen étant le fondement d'une nouvelle société chinoise. Leur littérature et les branches du parti ont commencé à apparaître dans presque tous les coins de l'Empire, avec un accent particulier sur les grandes villes et les universités. Depuis la restauration de l'autorité impériale, ils ont fait des percées significatives parmi de nombreux intellectuels urbains, des organisations étudiantes et même des officiers militaires de haut rang. Ils sont maintenant prêts à faire leur chemin dans le gouvernement. Les admettre dans notre Coalition peut certainement s'avérer utile pour étendre notre attrait auprès des masses urbaines et des militaires. Cependant, nous devrions également envisager de maintenir notre attention sur les campagnes comme base de nos efforts de reconstruction nationale."

 qieelection.4.t: "Élections de [GetYear]- Choisir une vision pour une Nouvelle Chine"
 qieelection.4.d: "Les quatre dernières années se sont révélées très productives pour tous les membres de la coalition au pouvoir. Ensemble, au sein de l'Assemblée, une série de réformes ont été adoptées, caractérisées par l'expression "Nouvelle Chine" - une vision de renaissance, de prospérité et de guérison qui contraste avec la dévastation du siècle dernier. Pendant ce temps, les partis au pouvoir ont commencé à se fissurer dans la poursuite de leurs propres programmes dans toute la société chinoise.\n\nDans les campagnes, les efforts de reconstruction rurale de Liang Shuming ont commencé à porter leurs fruits ; les nouvelles écoles produisent de nombreux diplômés qui ramènent ce qu'ils ont appris dans leurs villages, améliorant ainsi considérablement la qualité de vie des paysans. Les écoles et les coopératives économiques se révèlent beaucoup plus efficaces que les efforts précédents de l'État. En outre, la formation et la réorganisation de la milice rurale ont permis de défendre avec succès les villages contre les attaques de bandits, dont le nombre ne cesse de diminuer. De vastes améliorations du bien-être de la paysannerie sont attendues si ces programmes se poursuivent.\n\nLe Parti Jeune Chine a également pris l'initiative d'étendre sa plate-forme de mobilisation de masse aux villes. Des rassemblements et des organisations d'étudiants font la promotion de la "politique plébiscitaire" du PJC dans tout le pays, attirant les intellectuels, les étudiants universitaires et même la classe ouvrière urbaine. L'adhésion au parti est également montée en flèche parmi les officiers de l'armée nationale depuis que le PJC a élaboré de nouveaux programmes patriotiques à l'académie militaire de Dongbei. Dans l'ensemble, cela a considérablement renforcé les efforts du PJC pour créer un nouveau citoyen chinois socialement et politiquement mobilisé.\n\nAvec la naissance d'une nouvelle Chine et l'éclatement de la coalition, l'électorat doit maintenant choisir entre ces deux visions de l'avenir. La NCERA l'emportera-t-il, en faisant renaître la Chine à partir des villages traditionnels et des villes de campagne ? Ou bien les méthodes de mobilisation politique et idéologique du PJC dans les villes, les universités et l'armée fourniront-elles une nouvelle source de vie à la nation chinoise sous la forme du citoyen ?"
 qieelection.4.a: "La NCERA fera renaître la nation chinoise dans les campagnes."

 qieelection.5.d: "Dans tout État démocratique, l'importance de la représentation ne peut être sous-estimée. Mais d'où viennent exactement ces représentants et quels blocs de personnes finissent par les élire est un détail très important. Nous devrons demander à l'Assemblée de réviser méticuleusement les circonscriptions électorales si nous voulons aller de l'avant avec nos réformes."

 qieelection.6.t: "Besoins en infrastructures de vote"
 qieelection.6.d: "Les mécanismes réels d'une démocratie fonctionnelle sont assez exigeants pour une nation aussi grande que la Chine. Dans tout le pays, les gens doivent être informés de leurs droits, des paramètres de l'élection, des candidats en lice, des lieux mêmes de l'élection et, bien sûr, nous devrons recueillir les votes pour les compter. Une entreprise d'une telle ampleur exigera du gouvernement qu'il investisse une quantité considérable de temps et d'argent pour transformer ces nobles idéaux en quelque chose qui puisse réellement être utile à l'État."

Si elles disposaient d'un pouvoir plus pertinent dans leurs juridictions, elles pourraient s'avérer être un vecteur de soulagement pour la bureaucratie surchargée de Beijing.\n\nSi nous avons obtenu la loyauté des villages ruraux, nous pouvons être rassurés en sachant que la démocratie locale ne fera pas surgir d'éléments subversifs dans le gouvernement national."

 qieelection.8.d: "Depuis des décennies, la Chine a tenté à plusieurs reprises d'instaurer la démocratie dans le pays. Les tentatives républicaines et impériales de mise en œuvre de telles réformes se sont soldées par une corruption palpable, une insurrection sanglante ou l'approbation tacite de leurs grands seigneurs. Après plus d'un an d'attention concertée du gouvernement sur la réforme du processus de la politique électorale, Qu Yingguang supervise les dernières touches à sa révision de la démocratie dans le centre du pays. Maintenant, il ne peut que regarder pour voir si ses propres efforts pour la démocratie chinoise s'avéreront être le début de quelque chose de plus grand ou juste une autre tentative de folie au service d'un régime autoritaire corrompu."

 qiefocus.1.t: "Nouvel an Chinois : Année du Rat"
 qiefocus.1.d: "Dans un long discours quelque peu décousu pour marquer le Nouvel An chinois, le président de l'Assemblée Cao Kun a évoqué la nécessité de restaurer la gloire de l'empire Qing, d'unir le pays et de rembourser la dette pesant sur l'économie. Il a présenté un plan en trois points : des subventions gouvernementales et des réductions d'impôts seraient accordées aux industries manufacturières légères, les agriculteurs bénéficieraient de réductions d'impôts pour cultiver des plantes comestibles au lieu de cultures de rente, et une augmentation des impôts sur les gouverneurs provinciaux."

 qiefocus.2.t: "Réunion d'urgence de la clique Zhili"
 qiefocus.2.d: "Après l'effondrement de la Ligue au sud, nous avons rassemblé presque tous les officiers militaires supérieurs alignés sur la clique Zhili à Luoyang. Au début de la réunion, le maréchal Wu Peifu commença par une courte déclaration.\n\n« Camarades soldats, le moment est venu. Avec l'effondrement de la Ligue, nous sommes - pour la première fois depuis la guerre de Zhifeng - dans une situation précaire. Chaque choix que nous ferons au cours des prochaines semaines déterminera le sort de la Chine pour les décennies à venir.\n\n\"Je voudrais rappeler à certains\", dit-il en jetant un coup d'œil aux membres les plus bellicistes de l'assemblée, \"que l'intervention n'est pas nécessairement la ligne de conduite la plus judicieuse. Nous devons d'abord évaluer nos options avant de nous engager.\"\n\nLes divers généraux acquiescent de la tête et lancent une série de discussions sur la meilleure ligne de conduite."
 qiefocus.2.a: "Nous devons être prudents..."

 qiefocus.3.t: "Nouvelles Élections"
 qiefocus.3.d: "Notre décision de soutenir le gouvernement d'Anqing a été accueillie avec un grand soutien et l'approbation de la population. En réponse, le maréchal Wu a « persuadé » le président de l'Assemblée Cao Kun d'organiser une élection nationale pour capitaliser sur notre nouveau soutien. Théoriquement, tous les hommes alphabétisés en Chine sont éligibles pour participer à cette élection, mais les seigneurs de guerre locaux, le chaos généralisé au sein de la Ligue et d'autres problèmes signifient que nous nous attendons à n'obtenir de résultats probants de résultats que devant des zones sous notre contrôle direct. Les élections précédentes ont vu se dessiner des marges très minces, et bien que l'organe de pouvoir soit en grande partie impuissant, disposer d'une réserve de sièges en son sein, sous notre contrôle, renforcera notre légitimité à long terme."
 qiefocus.3.a: "Programmer les élections"

 qiefocus.4.t: "Rédaction d'une Nouvelle Constitution"
 qiefocus.4.d: "Après le renversement de l'empire Qing, Wu Peifu a réuni un groupe d'universitaires et de juristes pour l'aider à créer un nouveau gouvernement pour la Chine. Contrôler la ville de Beijing lui a conféré un certain niveau de légitimité, et la puissance militaire qu'il possède donne force à tout document qu'il choisit d'adopter.\n\nLa question de la légitimité étant résolue, la question urgente à laquelle Wu doit répondre est la forme de la constitution. Afin de gagner du temps et d'accélérer la centralisation de la Chine, il pourrait simplement adopter la dernière constitution non-monarchiste de la Chine, celle de 1923 créée par le président Cao Kun. Celle-ci, cependant, est truffée d'échappatoires, de possibilités d'abus en faveur de l'exécutif et d'autres problèmes. Wu et les érudits qu'il a réunis pourraient rédiger leur propre constitution, même si cela prendrait du temps et coûterait du capital politique."

 qiefocus.5.t: "Pouvoir de l'Exécutif"
 qiefocus.5.d: "Le premier problème auquel sont confrontés les constitutionnalistes de Wu est le niveau de pouvoir que l'exécutif devrait posséder. Il n'est pas dit, bien sûr, que Wu et la clique Zhili guideront l'exécutif à travers ces temps difficiles, mais une fois la Chine unifiée, il est généralement admis que le gouvernement de Wu passera (progressivement) à une certaine forme de démocratie.\n\nCela étant dit, un exécutif fort garantit la stabilité, tandis qu'un organe législatif habilité est mieux à même de générer du capital et du poids politiques."
 qiefocus.5.a: "S'assurer que l'exécutif ait une forte autorité"
 qiefocus.5.b: "S'assurer que le législatif ait une forte autorité"

 qiefocus.6.t: "La Question de l'Autonomie"
 qiefocus.6.d: "Le prochain problème auquel est confrontée l'assemblée constitutionnelle de Wu est le niveau d'autonomie des provinces. Les gouvernements républicains précédents sont souvent entrés en conflit avec les administrations provinciales, ce qui a - en partie - conduit à la situation actuelle en Chine. Une centralisation forte, en revanche, assure un meilleur suivi des ordres émis par Beijing."

 qiefocus.7.t: "La rédaction est achevée !"

Wu et la clique du Zhili veilleront à ce que le nouveau gouvernement soit stable pendant les premières années de son existence, mais une fois la Chine réunifiée, de nombreux universitaires espèrent que la Chine pourra entamer une transition vers une véritable démocratie."
 qiefocus.7.a: "Maintenant nous n'avons besoin que d'un Président !"

 qiefocus.8.t: "Choix d'un Président"
 qiefocus.8.d: "Bien qu'il soit l'un des plus grands esprits militaires de Chine, les compétences de Wu Peifu ne sont pas bien adaptées à l'ambiance feutrée qui prévaut au sein du gouvernement. Déjà, il craint que les questions militaires ne soient abandonnées en raison de ses fonctions de « protecteur national », et a ordonné que les universitaires qui rédigent la constitution dressent une liste de nouveaux présidents potentiels pour la République. Deux candidats ont émergé : l'universitaire et intellectuel Hu Shih, et le diplomate et (brièvement) ancien président V.K. Wellington Ku (Gu Weijun).\n\nHu est bien connu pour sa théorie du « pragmatisme » (shíyànzhuyì), un concept originaire des États-Unis dans les années 1870 et 80. Dans les écrits de Hu, il préconise la coopération avec les seigneurs de guerre et s'efforce de changer le gouvernement chinois de l'intérieur vers l'extérieur, au lieu de le démolir et de le reconstruire comme beaucoup le suggèrent au KMT. Après l'échec de l'expédition du Nord, cette théorie a gagné de nombreux adeptes et est très populaire dans les cercles universitaires.\n\nWellington Koo, d'autre part, est un génie diplomatique et un homme politique, qui a assisté à la conférence de Versailles en 1920 en tant qu'observateur, et a aidé à négocier plusieurs accords avec des diplomates américains, allemands et britanniques, lui donnant une incroyable expérience diplomatique qui sera sans aucun doute utile pour légitimer notre gouvernement."
 qiefocus.8.a: "Wu choisit Hu Shih"
 qiefocus.8.b: "Wu choisit Wellington Koo"

 qiefocus.9.t: "Inauguration de la Nouvelle République"
 qiefocus.9.d: "Lors d'une cérémonie élaborée aujourd'hui, Wu Peifu a supervisé la prestation de serment du nouveau Président de la République sous des acclamations enthousiastes. L'assemblée reste fermement aux mains de l'Association de l'Harmonie, et beaucoup doutent encore de la légitimité de ce nouveau régime. Néanmoins, Wu n'a plus à faire face à l'aristocratie Qing en tant qu'adversaire potentiel, et peut se concentrer sur la résolution des problèmes de dette massive auxquels la Chine est confrontée, et commencer à réunifier le pays fracturé.\n\nEn outre, malgré tous nos efforts pour présenter notre gouvernement comme le gouvernement légitime de la Chine, peu de gens nous voient ainsi. Nous devrons soit détruire, soit contraindre les groupes qui s'opposent à notre régime, et convaincre la population que nous sommes le véritable gouvernement de la Chine !"
 qiefocus.9.a: "Félicitations, M. le Président !"

 qiefocus.10.t: "Dette et Légitimité"
 qiefocus.10.d: "La question de la dette continue d'entraver nos efforts économiques et entrave nos tentatives de renforcer la légitimité de notre nouveau gouvernement. Bien que nous puissions demander de l'aide à l'Allemagne, il est probable que cela provoquera l'effondrement de notre gouvernement déjà impopulaire sous la pression publique. Le plan beaucoup plus astucieux est de prendre une position anti-concession, en faisant défaut sur notre dette mais en nous gagnant la loyauté de notre population."
 qiefocus.10.a: "Faites défaut sur la dette. C'est notre seule option."

 qiefocus.11.t: "Le Futur de la Clique Zhili"
 qiefocus.11.d: "La clique du Zhili, comme toutes les autres cliques de chefs de guerre en Chine, fonctionne principalement sur la base de l'ancienneté et des relations mentor-mentoré. Tout en assurant (généralement) la stabilité et en contribuant à réduire la possibilité de coups bas, ce système étouffe également la méritocratie et les promotions basées sur les compétences. Cependant, avec les décès récents et l'âge avancé de nombreux généraux de haut rang, nous pourrions être contraints de prendre des mesures radicales et de promouvoir des officiers plus jeunes au premier rang de notre armée.\n\nQuatre candidats se sont manifestés pour être élevés au rang de général : Guo Jijiao, Wang Lingyun, Du Xijun et Wei Yisan."
 qiefocus.11.a: "Offrez une promotion à ces jeunes gens prometteurs ! Il est temps de démarrer notre plan de défense."

 qiefocus.12.t: "Un Plan de Défense pour la Chine"
 qiefocus.12.d: "À la suite de l'appel de Wu Peifu visant à organiser une réunion des généraux supérieurs de Zhili, de nombreux sont arrivés à Luoyang, laissant leurs subordonnés en charge des affaires courantes. Leur première préoccupation urgente a été de choisir une stratégie de défense centralisée pour affronter l'inévitable guerre avec le Japon et le gouvernement Fengtian. L'audace croissante du traître du Nord à la suite de l'effondrement de la Ligue a alarmé de nombreux commandants supérieurs, dont Jiang Baili et Liu Menggeng. Les deux hommes ont passé les dernières semaines à codifier les plans qu'ils ont développés au cours des deux dernières années et les ont présentés aux commandants Zhili réunis. Jiang se concentre sur les fortifications défensives à grande échelle, déplaçant l'industrie vers l'intérieur de la Chine et éveillant l'esprit combatif de la Chine afin de vaincre le Japon.\n\nBien qu'il ne soit pas directement opposé au plan de Jiang, le plan de Liu se concentre davantage sur l'amélioration de la capacité de combat des troupes de Zhili. L'amélioration du moral, les normes d'exercice et le soutien logistique sont essentiels, du moins à ses yeux, pour assurer la victoire chinoise. Des soins médicaux actualisés jouent également un rôle crucial dans la stratégie. Les deux sont des plans convaincants, mais c'est à Wu Peifu qu'il revient de trancher."
 qiefocus.12.a:0 "Voyons voir..."

 qiefocus.13.t: "Position de l'Empereur"
 qiefocus.13.d: "Alors que nous commençons à réorganiser l'État après la chute de la vile clique du Zhili, l'Assemblée croupion demande que le rôle de la monarchie soit inscrit plus directement dans le cadre juridique. Il existe un consensus général au sein de la cour sur le fait que la position de l'Empereur ne peut être maintenue qu'avec une adhésion stricte à la non-intervention dans les questions de politique d'État. Cependant, il existe également une minorité, petite mais bruyante, notamment parmi les idéologues de feu Kang Youwei, qui appelle à la sauvegarde de la prérogative impériale si l'Assemblée se trouve dans une impasse en cas de crise."
 qiefocus.13.a: "Nous avons besoin d'un dirigeant au-dessus de la mêlée de la politique."
 qiefocus.13.b: "L'Assemblée devrait avoir une main directrice si le besoin s'en fait sentir."

 qiefocus.14.t: "Reconstruire notre structure de commandement"
 qiefocus.14.d: "Après la purge de nombreux membres de la clique de Zhili, notre armée s'est retrouvée sans véritable structure de commandement. Il incombe aux deux princes Aisin-Gioro, l'oncle de l'empereur Zaitao et son jeune frère Pujie, de réformer la structure de commandement impériale. La tâche ne sera pas aisée, car Wu et ses acolytes ont essentiellement supprimé une structure divisionnaire moderne fondée sur la promotion méritocratique au profit du copinage et du népotisme. La mise en œuvre de leurs réformes prendra du temps, mais entre-temps, ils ont demandé l'aide de Zhang Yinwu, en lui confiant une commission. Yinwu, ancien général de l'armée Jin de Yan Xishan, est retourné dans sa province natale de Zhili après la défaite des forces de Shanxi contre la clique de Zhili lors de la quatrième guerre de Zhifeng. On dit également qu'il est impliqué d'une manière ou d'une autre dans le Parti de la Jeune Chine, bien que l'on ne sache pas vraiment où se situe sa véritable loyauté."
 qiefocus.14.a: "Excellent"

 qiefocus.15.t: "Machinations de la Ville Impériale"
 qiefocus.15.d: "Des machinations politiques se préparent dans la capitale impériale, à un niveau jamais atteint depuis la dissolution du Parlement d'Anfu en 1920. Parallèlement aux vides militaires et bureaucratiques laissés par la chute de l'appareil militaro-politique zhili, de nouveaux prétendants émergent des vides politiques pour tenter de s'emparer du pouvoir, monopolisé depuis longtemps par les Zhili et leurs sous-fifres. À l'heure actuelle, plusieurs organisations politiques ont consolidé leurs programmes et leurs positions auprès de l'opinion publique et du pouvoir législatif, que nous pouvons désormais également identifier.\n\nLe Zongshe, ou parti royaliste, est le plus récent sur la scène, mais il est loin d'être mal préparé contre ses adversaires. Il est composé principalement d'aristocrates mandchous et même de membres de la famille Aisin-Gioro. En théorie, le Zongshe est composé des loyalistes les plus acharnés de l'empereur et de sa cause, certains observateurs établissant des parallèles entre eux et la faction impériale à l'origine de la restauration Meiji.\n\nLe parti Jeune Chine est considéré par certains comme le plus grand joker dans la course au pouvoir. Par opposition à la vénération impériale ou à la reconstruction rurale, le parti Jeune Chine, comme son homonyme, souhaite remodeler fondamentalement le concept d'État-nation chinois. Ainsi, son programme est peut-être le plus ambitieux des trois groupes, appelant à une restructuration fondamentale de la société et redéfinissant le rôle de l'État impérial en tant que guide dans le développement de la nation.\n\nL'Association pour la réforme du nouvel empire chinois représente le dernier, mais non le moindre, des principaux prétendants au pouvoir. Contrairement au PJC ou au Zongshe, la NCERA n'est pas un parti unique, mais une alliance plus large de deux blocs politiques, le parti constitutionnaliste dirigé par Xu Qin et le mouvement de reconstruction rurale de Liang Shuming. Le premier s'est imposé comme le partenaire dominant, grâce à ses racines profondes qui remontent aux éléments réformistes avant le soulèvement de Wuchang. Pour soutenir leur cause, Xu Qin est aussi largement considéré comme un héritier direct de Kang Youwei et de Liang Qichao. Pour l'heure, les deux groupes sont unis dans leur plaidoyer en faveur de la poursuite et de l'approfondissement des réformes pré-républicaines initiées sous Cixi et Zaifeng."
 qiefocus.15.a: "Mais qui sortira vainqueur de l'épreuve ?"

 qiefocus.16.t: "La Coalition Improbable"
 qiefocus.16.d: "Alors que tous les partis réformistes étaient formellement unis dans leur volonté de renverser la clique Zhili, maintenant que la poussière est retombée suite au coup d'État, ils se trouvent dans une position délicate. Le Japon et le Fengtian occupent une place importante, et ils doivent travailler ensemble afin d'éviter l'anéantissement. Pourtant, en même temps, les différents groupes réformistes ont des buts, des objectifs différents, et des particularités qu'ils peuvent apporter à l'armée. Puyi et ses conseillers ont besoin du soutien de chacune des parties et de leurs composantes militaires pour gagner la guerre éventuelle contre le Japon, mais cela aura un coût..."
 qiefocus.16.a: "C'est toujours mieux que les Zhili."

 qiefocus.17.t: "La Société du Sable Jaune"
 qiefocus.17.d: "En plus des forces de défense rurale employées par la NCERA, la Société des Sables Jaunes, une secte ésotérique ayant des liens avec les Yiguandao, a proposé de rejoindre notre armée. Ce sont de féroces combattants, et relativement loyaux étant donné notre nouvelle position anti-concession, mais certains craignent qu'accepter leur offre de rejoindre notre armée ne donne aux Yiguandao une autre opportunité de s'infiltrer également."
 qiefocus.17.a: "Offrez leur une place dans l'armée."

Alors qu'une paix superficielle revient à Beijing, la violence et le chaos continuent de régner dans l'Empire.\n\nL'élimination de Cao Kun et de Wu Peifu était la partie la plus importante du complot de restauration.

À des milliers de kilomètres des foyers du Kuomintang, il est clair que la véritable cible de ce vitriol est la NCERA, et plus précisément le Mouvement de Reconstruction Rurale qui constitue la moitié de la coalition NCERA. Il est vrai que l'organisation existait avant la restauration des Qing et qu'il existait des liens entre elle et de nombreux républicains, mais il est clair que ce mouvement vers une action punitive est un poignard pointé vers les opposants nationaux."

 qiefocus.21.d: "Dans le sillage du Maître Honoré, la dynastie Qing voit son statut auprès du peuple renouvelé et réaffirmé. Récemment, Zhang Tianran s'est enhardi dans ses tentatives de lier plus étroitement la cour au Yiguandao. En échange d'un plus grand nombre de nominations impériales de fidèles, les Yiguandao rendront des services toujours plus grands à l'Empereur en signe de soumission. Alors que l'État se repose sur les Yiguandao, peut-être les Yiguandao se reposeront-ils sur l'État."

 qiefocus.22.t: "Un Nouveau Couronnement ?"
 qiefocus.22.d: "Une idée insolite circule depuis quelques semaines au sein de la noblesse Qing : organiser un second couronnement pour Puyi. Ils prétendent que la Restauration de 1927 ayant été effectuée sous la supervision de la Clique Zhili, elle n'était pas vraiment \"correcte\" et qu'une nouvelle cérémonie de rétablissement doit être organisée afin d'apaiser les traditions de l'empire. Le coût d'une telle opération serait incroyablement élevé, mais elle pourrait nous donner une certaine légitimité et nous permettrait d'obtenir un soutien supplémentaire de la part des nobles."
 qiefocus.22.a: "Organisez la cérémonie !"

 qiefocus.23.t: "Les Dynasties arrivent"
 qiefocus.23.d: "Ces derniers jours, le Marquis de la Grande Grâce, le Duc Minsheng et divers autres descendants d'anciennes dynasties impériales sont arrivés à Beijing. Un par un, ils passent devant l'Empereur et s'inclinent en silence pour lui présenter leurs respects. Dans une première inédite, un photographe de la cour a été chargé de capturer chacune de ces présentations, et elles seront distribuées comme propagande pour prouver la légitimité de l'Empereur, et éroder tout soutien à une famille régnante non-Aisin Gioro."

Bien que nous soyons loin de l'Europe, nous pourrions encore négocier un traité de coopération et de protection. Cependant, d'autres hauts fonctionnaires estiment que nous devrions nous concentrer sur la reconstruction de notre nation ravagée par la guerre."

C'est une opportunité intéressante - ils pourraient être un puissant allié à l'Est, ayant déjà battu le gouvernement Fengtian et l'Empire japonais. Ils pourraient cependant nous entraîner dans des guerres loin de chez nous, qui ne nous concernent pas."

Ces faits n'empêcheront pas notre demande d'un système plus parfait, alors que le public décrie notre travail avec les entreprises et les capitaux allemands, il est clair que ces outils industriels ouvriront la voie à une fondation plus solide pour l'empire. Alors que nous cherchons à étendre davantage nos artères de fer et d'acier à travers la campagne, l'ingénierie allemande continue à montrer la voie, mais jusqu'où nous poussons cette relation est une question constamment embrouillée dans l'esprit du gouvernement civil."

 qiefocus.32.d: "Les événements se sont précipités à Beijing ces derniers mois. Autrefois centre de la Chine, la ville est aujourd'hui en proie à des émeutes et à des sentiments anti-étrangers et surtout anti-allemands. Tout n'est pas perdu pour autant : le nouveau gouvernement de Beijing a discrètement proposé une sorte de rapprochement si nous acceptions une perte d'influence significative. En échange de la poursuite de notre aide économique et militaire face au Japon et d'une réduction significative des dettes allemandes, le nouveau régime de Beijing promet de soutenir les investissements économiques privés et de garantir les droits de l'Allemagne à Qingdao et à Weihaiwei.\n\nLes négociations entre ces députés soudain farouchement indépendants et nos propres fonctionnaires ont duré une bonne partie de la nuit, aucune des deux parties ne pouvant se permettre de partir sans une réponse ferme. Finalement, les hommes de Beijing ont réussi à convaincre la plupart des délégués allemands d'accepter un compromis sur la question de la dette massive accumulée par l'empire Qing au cours de la dernière décennie, en veillant à ce qu'un défaut de paiement ouvert du trésor de Beijing ne soit plus à l'ordre du jour. Enfin, le haut-commissaire à Singapour doit bien sûr signer le document."

 qiefocus.33.d: "Les événements à Beijing se sont déroulés rapidement ces derniers mois. Autrefois centre de la Chine, la ville est aujourd'hui en proie à un chaos émeutier qui l'engloutit dans un flamboiement de sentiments anti-étrangers et surtout anti-allemands. Plusieurs dirigeants de notre gouvernement d'urgence ont discrètement proposé une sorte de rapprochement à l'Empire allemand, à condition qu'il accepte une perte d'influence significative. En échange d'une aide économique et militaire continue contre le Japon et d'une réduction significative des dettes allemandes, nous nous sommes engagés à soutenir les investissements économiques privés et à garantir les droits de l'Allemagne à Qingdao et à Weihaiwei.\n\nLes négociations entre nos députés, farouchement indépendants, et leurs fonctionnaires, déconcertés, ont duré une bonne partie de la nuit, car aucune des deux parties ne pouvait se permettre de partir sans une réponse ferme.

Finalement, bien sûr, nos conditions ont été acceptées."

Ils s'appuient sur la familiarité déjà existante et sur le fait qu'un rival financier et militaire commun à Tokyo rend la coopération indispensable. Malgré cela, nous devons rester prudents dans nos négociations avec le Reich, afin de ne pas être perçus comme leurs valets et de ne prendre que ce dont nous avons absolument besoin au lieu de nous rallier à nos anciens maîtres. Pour l'instant, deux offres nous parviennent du côté allemand : le retour des conseillers du Luftstreitkräfte pour qu'ils poursuivent leur travail au sein de l'armée de l'air impériale, ou un contrat lucratif avec Siemens pour la fabrication de machines et d'autres équipements électriques en coopération avec nos bureaux de production impériaux, ce dont nous avons cruellement besoin en ce moment."

Ils s'appuient sur la familiarité qui existe déjà entre les deux pays et sur le fait qu'un rival financier et militaire commun à Tokyo rend la coopération nécessaire. Bien que cela puisse être envisagé plus tard, le climat politique actuel est trop fragile pour que les entreprises allemandes rétablissent leur position en Chine, car nous risquons de nous aliéner les cercles intellectuels, ainsi qu'une classe émergente de petits capitalistes et d'entrepreneurs. Compte tenu de notre situation politique et de la possibilité de favoriser la croissance industrielle dans notre pays, nous devons nous abstenir de conclure des accords économiques avec l'Allemagne, du moins jusqu'à ce qu'il soit dans notre intérêt de le faire à nouveau."
 qiefocus.34.a: "Signer les contrats avec Siemens."

 qiefocus.35.d: "Après des années passées sous le joug d'une dette oppressive, le régime a enfin stabilisé notre situation économique. Maintenant que nos créanciers internationaux ont commencé à regarder le régime de Pékin d'un œil plus amical, de nouvelles opportunités se présentent à nous. Des entreprises allemandes, avec l'approbation expresse de Berlin, nous ont proposé de nouvelles offres économiques pour tenter de faire fortune sur le terrain d'une économie chinoise en plein essor et en pleine possession de ses moyens. La nouvelle Chine qui se construit peut s'attendre à de nombreux autres liens économiques avec le reste du monde, toujours sur un pied d'égalité."

Nous pourrions l'exploiter, mais les ingénieurs de [SHX.GetAdjective] ne manqueront pas de remarquer l'incursion.\n\nDepuis l'effondrement de la Ligue, le Shanxi a subi une profonde restructuration économique qui s'est révélée jusqu'à présent très hostile aux investissements extérieurs.

Cela a coïncidé positivement avec le récent virage pris par le Shanxi, qui a libéralisé certains échanges commerciaux et réduit l'isolement financier qu'il subissait depuis sa défaite cuisante lors de la quatrième guerre Zhili-Fengtian. Leur ambitieuse réforme économique, connue sous le nom de "plan décennal", n'est pas passée inaperçue, même si l'on ignore pour l'instant dans quelle mesure elle est réellement utilisée pour favoriser la prospérité locale ou pour servir de mécanisme de contestation de notre pouvoir.\n\nCe qui a été découvert, cependant, c'est un filon de minerai très précieux et très riche qui s'étend profondément dans le territoire du Shanxi. Leur politique économique tournée vers l'extérieur laisse entrevoir la possibilité de s'engager dans un projet d'extraction de minerais mutuellement bénéfique, augmentant considérablement la quantité de charbon et de fer produite pour la sécurité de l'ensemble de la nation chinoise. Cela permettrait également d'étendre notre influence, mais tout cela dépend de l'acceptation de l'inconstant [SHX.GetLeader]."

Nos ingénieurs ont découvert des tunnels [QIE.GetAdjective] qui s'étendent sur notre territoire, avec des flux de mineurs et de machines étrangères qui s'immiscent dans notre domaine légitime. Ils sont protégés par des troupes de l'armée centrale, une grave insulte qui nous rappelle toujours les terres qui nous ont été volées après la désastreuse quatrième guerre Zhili-Fengtian. Aujourd'hui, non seulement ils perçoivent injustement les redevances des terres occupées dans l'est du Shanxi, mais ils s'efforcent également de s'emparer des gisements que nous possédons dans les montagnes de l'ouest à leurs propres fins néfastes.\n\nCette grave insulte et cette arrogance de la part des [QIE.GetAdjective] ne cesseront jamais si nous ne nous défendons pas, même si c'est toujours risqué de le faire face à une force bien plus puissante que la nôtre. Cependant, si nous ne disons rien, qui sait quelle sera la prochaine escalade ? La carte maîtresse dans notre jeu pourrait être d'invoquer la menace d'autres puissances intéressées dans la région..."

 qiefor.26.t: "[SHX.GetNameDefCap] protège nos opérations minières !"
 qiefor.26.intro: "[SHX.GetLeader] a déposé une protestation officielle auprès du Bureau des mines, affirmant que nos mineurs ont violé les frontières de sa province. Son message contient une litanie de plaintes, principalement des griefs concernant nos relations avec le Shanxi oriental au cours des dernières années. Pour appuyer ses propos, il a ordonné à son armée provinciale de se rassembler le long de la frontière pour effectuer des exercices militaires. Cela a fortement aggravé les tensions et la rumeur s'est répandue qu'il allait bientôt éjecter nos mineurs par la force."
 qiefor.26.d.fengtian: "$qiefor.26.intro$\n\nNormalement, nous devrions simplement considérer qu'il s'agit d'une posture ou que [SHX.GetLeader] tente de s'assurer un autre paiement, mais il a également noté que si Beijing n'agit pas en conséquence, il cherchera un " gouvernement responsable pour régler le problème ".  Il s'agit sans aucun doute d'une menace d'alliance avec [FNG.GetLeader] à Fengtian, d'une remise en cause de notre domination dans le nord de la nation et d'un risque de reprise du conflit. Pris en sandwich entre les deux factions, bien que nous soyons toujours en mesure de les vaincre dans un conflit comme celui des années 1920, cela laisserait probablement notre flanc sud exposé aux développements dans le sud."
 qiefor.26.d.nofengtian: "$qiefor.26.intro$\n\nLa disparition de Zhang Zuolin a considérablement atténué cette menace, mais nous devons néanmoins nous montrer prudents. Le Shanxi compte de nombreuses montagnes et peu de passages facilement navigables. Sans parler des nombreux fleuves qui traversent la région. Une invasion de la province, si les choses s'aggravent, se soldera probablement par notre victoire, mais pas sans un coût d'opportunité important."
 qiefor.26.a: "Qui s'en soucie ? Continuez à miner !"

 qiefor.27.t: "[QIE.GetNameDefCap] nous a ignoré !"
 qiefor.27.d.nofengtian: "Comme on pouvait s'y attendre, [QIE.GetNameDef] a ignoré notre demande. Leurs perfides mineurs continuent d'étendre leur emprise sur nos vastes richesses minérales, ignorant nos plaintes et violant les différents décrets émis par notre gouverneur. Nos intentions ayant été clairement énoncées et ignorées, c'est à nous de décider si cela vaut la peine de les mettre en application. L'envoi de troupes dans les zones frontalières contestées pour expulser ceux qui opèrent sans permis délivré par Taiyuan est une option risquée, mais ne pas le faire nous ferait paraître faibles."
 qiefor.27.d.fengtian: "$qiefor.27.d.nofengtian$\n\nUne autre option qui s'offre à nous serait d'obtenir le soutien de [FNG.GetNameDef]. Dirigée par l'ambitieux seigneur de guerre [FNG.GetLeader], la clique de Yan a déjà collaboré avec eux en 1928 dans l'espoir de renverser la clique de Zhili dans un moment de faiblesse. C'est ainsi que nous avons perdu le contrôle du Shanxi oriental, et nombreux sont ceux qui n'ont pas envie de jeter à nouveau leur dévolu sur eux. Cependant, seuls, nous ne ferons probablement pas le poids face à l'armée centrale. Néanmoins, en nous rangeant de leur côté, nous dépendrons d'eux pour obtenir un résultat positif et, s'ils n'y parviennent pas, nous serons contraints de faire marche arrière."

 qiefor.27001.t: "Shanxi bloque nos ingénieurs !"
 qiefor.27001.d: "Dans un geste de défi à notre autorité, [SHX.GetLeader] a déployé des troupes pour tenter d'empêcher la poursuite des opérations minières dans la zone contestée du Shanxi oriental. Ils ont confisqué de nombreuses machines de valeur après avoir refusé de reconnaître les permis que nous avions délivrés, arrêté de nombreux mineurs et forcé d'autres à fuir pour se mettre à l'abri dans nos propres lignes. Alors que nos propres garnisons dans la région se démènent pour relever le défi, le Shanxi ressemble de plus en plus à une zone de guerre.\n\nAvec la montée en flèche des tensions, de nombreux investisseurs ont déjà été effrayés et ont retiré leur financement pour d'autres projets. Les routes et les voies ferrées sont remplies de personnes fuyant la zone frontalière, et bon nombre de nos propres employés du secteur minier ne veulent plus travailler dans ce qui semble être un environnement dangereux. Il semble que notre investissement économique dans la région ait déjà été gâché, mais cela ne veut pas dire que ce soit pour rien.\n\nCompte tenu des circonstances, nous pouvons clairement accuser [SHX.GetLeader] et ses acolytes de sédition, de rébellion et d'une foule d'autres crimes contre notre État. Un mandat d'arrêt peut être rapidement mis en place, même si cela implique de perdre la plupart de nos investissements restants. S'il veut faire appliquer ses "décrets", nous pouvons certainement faire appliquer les nôtres."

 qiefor.28.d: "Face à notre fermeté et craignant une escalade, [QIE.GetNameDef] a discrètement reculé. Leurs mineurs et ingénieurs ont quitté notre territoire, nous laissant victorieux dans ce conflit. Les voix compatissantes de Taiyuan se sont tues, car ceux qui espéraient profiter de l'empiètement [QIE.GetAdjective] redoutent désormais nos représailles, alors que nous affirmons notre autorité sur l'ensemble de la province. Il s'agit bien sûr d'une arme à double tranchant, car les investissements de ceux qui sont fidèles à Beijing ainsi que les conglomérats internationaux hésitent de plus en plus à investir dans ce qu'ils considèrent comme une province arriviste.\n\nCela ne doit cependant pas nous empêcher de célébrer ce qui s'est passé ici. Nous avons remporté une grande victoire contre un gouvernement central trop zélé, sans tirer un seul coup de feu et en évitant tout conflit violent. De plus, grâce au travail existant de ces mineurs, nous pouvons maintenant récolter les bénéfices de la richesse de Shanxi pour nous-mêmes, les propriétaires légitimes."
 qiefor.28.a: "Excellent !"

 qiefor.29.t: "Shanxi recule !"
 qiefor.29.d: "Suite à notre démonstration de force, [SHX.GetLeader] a ordonné à ses hommes de se retirer et à l'ensemble de [SHX.GetName] de se retirer du conflit qui couvait au sujet des droits miniers dans le Shanxi oriental. Cela a permis à nos mineurs d'accéder aux précieux filons de minerais de la région sans être dérangés, avec un accès presque totalement libre non seulement au Shanxi oriental, mais aussi à la quasi-totalité de la province. Il s'agit d'une grande victoire, qui nous permet de fournir des ressources stratégiques essentielles à notre machine de guerre, alors que nous travaillons à l'unification nationale. Le statut de [SHX.GetLeader] en tant que figure nationale a été réduit à néant, humilié par ce résultat et forcé de reconnaître notre supériorité, du moins pour l'instant. Il faudra bien finir par le mettre au pas, mais notre victoire d'aujourd'hui sera sans doute le premier pas vers le retour du Shanxi dans le giron national."
 qiefor.29.a: "Excellent !"

 qiefor.30.t: "Crise minière au Shanxi !"
 qiefor.30.d: "Ce qui a commencé comme une querelle mineure sur les droits d'exploitation des ressources dans la province de Shanxi s'est rapidement intensifié au cours des derniers mois le long de la frontière entre Shanx et [QIE.GetName], présentant à la fois un risque et une opportunité puisque nous sommes potentiellement entraînés dans un conflit qui couve dans le nord de la Chine. À la fin de l'expédition septentrionale, Zhang Zuolin a réussi à conclure un pacte secret entre la clique de Fengtian et une coalition d'alliés comprenant Yan Xishan (Shanxi), Zhang Zhongchang (Shandong) et Tang Jiyao (Yunnan).\n\nLa tentative de vaincre rapidement la clique de Zhili échoue en raison de la défection de Shandong et de l'incapacité des alliés à progresser, le Shanxi subissant les pires conséquences. La moitié orientale de la province est occupée par les forces [QIE.GetAdjective] depuis 1928, y compris ses précieuses réserves de charbon et de fer. Les dirigeants [QIE.GetAdjective] sont apparemment devenus trop gourmands ces derniers temps, ce qui a entraîné une nouvelle accumulation de forces et menacé l'équilibre du pouvoir dans le nord de la Chine.\n\nLe [SHX.GetLeader] nous demande d'intervenir et de garantir les frontières de sa province. Bien que nous soyons en bons termes, la présence de ses armées à l'ouest menace l'emprise de Zhili sur des villes cruciales comme Baoding, Luoyang et Xi'an. La géographie de sa province est assez favorable à la défense, mais il n'a pas la base industrielle pour tenir éternellement. Si nous le laissons se faire piétiner, la défaite de la [QIE.GetName] sera beaucoup plus difficile. D'un autre côté, si nous nous impliquons, nous mettons notre réputation en jeu et ce n'est peut-être pas la meilleure chose à faire."

 qiefor.31.d: "Dans cette situation désespérée, [FNG.GetLeader] est venu à notre rescousse. Dans un message adressé à [QIE.Capital.GetName], il a promis de garantir nos frontières provinciales contre l'empiètement des agents [QIE.GetAdjective], affirmant que tout gouvernement légitime en Chine devrait respecter les frontières provinciales en matière d'autorité. L'engagement réel de Zhang Zuolin à l'égard de cette rhétorique fédéraliste est très éphémère, mais sa force militaire ne l'est pas. Si le [QIE.GetName] continue de "violer les frontières de notre province", il affirme qu'il viendra à notre aide, menaçant ainsi l'armée [QIE.GetAdjective], déjà débordée, d'une guerre sur deux fronts."

 qiefor.32.d: "Il semble que [SHX.GetLeader] ait été sérieux dans sa menace de rejoindre le Fengtian : [FNG.GetLeader] vient d'annoncer qu'il protégerait l'" intégrité provinciale " du Shanxi contre toute " incursion rebelle ". C'est une trahison de premier ordre et un autre signe de l'effondrement de notre ordre national.\n\nSa capacité à mettre sa menace à exécution reste toutefois sujette à caution. La clique de Fengtian a de nombreux problèmes urgents et n'est pas nécessairement désireuse d'une guerre à grande échelle. On peut se demander dans quelle mesure l'aide japonaise a amélioré sa situation par rapport à notre propre développement militaire au cours de la dernière décennie, et nous avons en effet vaincu la puissance combinée de Fengtian et de Shanxi dans le passé.\n\nToutefois, nous serions bien avisés de ne pas sous-estimer les défis d'une guerre sur deux fronts, en particulier lorsque nous surveillons la situation dans le sud. Le bluff de Fengtian est un jeu risqué, quel que soit le scénario. Mais reculer maintenant nous ferait paraître faibles et nous encouragerait à poursuivre notre action. La nation attend que nous prenions une décision finale."

Ils ont commencé à déplacer leurs troupes dans les zones minières contestées, tirant sur les unités provinciales que nous y avons stationnées. Nous entendons déjà parler d'escarmouches isolées entre les gardes-frontières et les troupes [QIE.GetAdjective], alors que la guerre menace. Alors que nos hommes se précipitent sur la ligne de front, nous devons immédiatement demander de l'aide à [FNG.GetLeader] ! Ensemble, nous aurons la force non seulement de repousser les avancées de la soi-disant armée centrale, mais aussi, avec un peu de chance, de mettre fin à la [QIE.GetName] une fois pour toutes !"

Les rapports de [SHX.Capital.GetName] indiquent que les forces avancées [QIE.GetAdjective] ont pénétré dans les territoires contestés au cours de la semaine dernière et ont commencé à attaquer les garnisons frontalières. Contrairement à certaines attentes, il semble que l'armée [SHX.GetAdjective] ait tenu bon, du moins pour l'instant. Fournis en fusils et en artillerie de qualité par Taiyuan et s'appuyant sur leur connaissance du terrain, le fait qu'ils ne se soient pas effondrés immédiatement dans une déroute donne l'espoir qu'ils puissent l'emporter.\n\nC'est peut-être l'occasion que nous attendons - une chance d'inverser l'humiliation de 1928 ! Avec de nombreuses divisions [QIE.GetAdjective] distraites en essayant de s'emparer rapidement de Taiyuan, nous pourrions enfin avoir la chance de prendre Beijing d'assaut et, espérons-le, de faire la jonction avec les forces [SHX.GetAdjective]. Avec les yeux de la nation fixés sur nous, nous devons décider de notre prochaine action."

Entourés de deux côtés, nous devons compter sur nos défenses le long de la rivière Dai, un entraînement supérieur et de meilleures ressources pour écraser l'offensive [FNG.GetAdjective]. Pendant ce temps, l'armée [SHX.GetAdjective] ne devrait pas représenter une menace considérable, même si la longue ligne de front que nous partageons avec eux va malheureusement immobiliser de nombreuses divisions. Si nous voulons recréer notre victoire de 1928, nous devrons travailler intelligemment et courageusement - la discipline supérieure de notre armée l'emportera. À ce stade, nous nous battons pour bien plus que quelques mines supplémentaires ou des droits d'imposition, nous sommes maintenant engagés dans une bataille pour le destin de la nation."

Les armées de [SHX.GetName] ont déjà été désorganisées et forcées de se débrouiller seules. Mais avec les montagnes et les rivières derrière elles, elles devraient pouvoir se battre.\n\nNous avons sans aucun doute gagné la bataille pour l'est du Shanxi, mais la question de savoir s'il faut ou non poursuivre l'armée [SHX.GetAdjective] en déroute vers l'ouest est une autre question. Le [SHX.GetLeader] a offert une série de concessions principalement économiques, mais aussi politiques, dans l'espoir d'éviter l'invasion. Les éléments les plus faucons de notre gouvernement ont proposé de détruire le traître [SHX.GetLeader], éliminant ainsi la menace de façon permanente. Les ministres les plus prudents préviennent toutefois que l'enlisement des combats dans le Shanxi pourrait nous rendre vulnérables à l'avenir."

 qiefor.61.d: "D'une manière ou d'une autre, ils ont refusé une offre qu'ils n'étaient pas censés refuser. En conséquence, en coordination avec le Conseil de Liaison de Beijing, nous avons temporairement mis en place des restrictions extrêmement importantes pour les entreprises d'Anqing opérant à l'intérieur de nos frontières. Bien que nous veillerons à ce que notre propre économie ne soit pas touchée, nous empêcherons tout type de profit d'aller à Anqing pendant les prochains mois, au minimum. Cela les rendra sûrement malheureux, mais cela devrait être une leçon dont ils se souviendront, la prochaine fois."
 qiefor.61.a: "Faites le"

 qiefor.62.t: "Puyi reçoit un accueil chaleureux à Nanjing"
 qiefor.62.d: "L'Empereur Puyi s'est récemment rendu dans la capitale du Sud, Nanjing, en compagnie de Wu Peifu. Ils y ont rencontré Chen Tiaoyuan, qui a veillé à lui réserver un accueil incroyablement chaleureux. En fait, Puyi a été tellement ravi qu'il a demandé à Chen Tiaoyuan s'il était possible de réaliser un vaste projet de rénovation et de reconstruction du Palais Ming, en ruines, de la ville."
 qiefor.62.a: "Excellent"

 qiefor.63.t: "Puyi choqué par les manifestations à Nanjing"
 qiefor.63.d: "L'Empereur Puyi s'est récemment rendu dans la capitale du Sud, Nanjing, en compagnie de Wu Peifu. Ils y ont rencontré Chen Tiaoyuan, chef de la clique d'Anqing. Cependant, à la consternation de l'Empereur et de Wu, les rues étaient bondées de manifestants. Il était évident que Chen ne maîtrisait pas la situation ou qu'il ne se souciait tout simplement pas d'accueillir Puyi comme il se doit. Ces deux scénarios sont scandaleux et doivent être corrigés. Le Conseil de Liaison de Beijing a reçu l'ordre de s'assurer que Chen paie pour cela."
 qiefor.63.a: "Mauvaises manières"

 qiefor.64.t: "Chen est d'accord avec les intellectuels"
 qiefor.64.d: "Le rassemblement intellectuel organisé par le Conseil de liaison de Beijing à Nanjing a été un grand succès. Un tel succès même, que Chen Tiaoyuan lui-même a annoncé qu'il était d'accord avec leur sentiment et qu'il ferait tout son possible pour accélérer la chronologie. Espérons qu'il ne mente pas."
 qiefor.64.a: "Bonnes nouvelles"

 qiefor.65.t: "Chen met en avant son autonomie"
 qiefor.65.d: "Récemment, le Conseil de Liaison de Beijing, à Nanjing a organisé une réunion de divers intellectuels chinois célèbres. Ils sont tous arrivés à la même conclusion : la Chine doit s'unir immédiatement. Cependant, Chen Tiaoyuan, leader d'Anqing, s'est prononcé contre l'urgence de leur appel. Au lieu de cela, il dit que l'autonomie locale est plus importante que l'unification. Ce qu'il dit est pratiquement une renonciation à sa reconnaissance des Qing comme seul gouvernement national ! Nous ne pouvons pas le laisser s'en tirer avec de telles paroles, et devons-nous y opposer immédiatement."
 qiefor.65.a: "Préparer un contre-message"

 qiefor.66.t: "Les Qing nous tendent la main"
 qiefor.66.d: "Les tensions montent dans le nord, les Qing craignant d'être attaqués par le Gouvernement de Fengtian, voir par le Japon. Ils cherchent des alliés et comme nous n'avons pas oublié leur aide dans la guerre de la Ligue, ils nous sollicitent aujourd'hui. Accepterons-nous leur demande et conclurons-nous une alliance avec eux ?"
 qiefor.66.a: "Bien sûr"
 qiefor.66.b: "Non !"

 qiefor.67.t: "Les Qing nous tendent la main"
 qiefor.67.d: "Maintenant que les Qing sont attaqués de l'extérieur, ils nous ont demandé de conclure une alliance avec eux et de participer à la défense de la Chine. Si nous n'aidons pas, la Chine pourrait être envahie. Nous n'avons pas vraiment le choix."
 qiefor.67.a: "Bien sûr"
 qiefor.67.b: "Non !"

 qiefor.68.t: "Les Qing nous tendent la main"
 qiefor.68.d: "Jusqu'à présent, nous avons évité d'être intégrés par les Qing. Cependant, ils sont sortis victorieux de leur autre conflit majeur, ce qui signifie que nous sommes très probablement les prochains."
 qiefor.68.a: "Bien sûr"
 qiefor.68.b: "Non !"

 qiefor.69.t: "Chen refuse de conclure une alliance"
 qiefor.69.d1: "Chen Tiaoyuan, chef de la clique d'Anqing, a refusé notre demande d'alliance. C'est difficile à croire, mais c'est pourtant bien vrai. Nous ne pouvons pas faire grand-chose maintenant, car nous ne souhaitons pas faire exploser notre relation, nous veillerons cependant à ce qu'il accepte, la prochaine fois."
 qiefor.69.d2: "Chen Tiaoyuan, chef de la clique d'Anqing, a refusé notre demande d'alliance. C'est difficile à croire, mais c'est pourtant vrai. Nous ne pouvons pas faire grand-chose maintenant, car nous sommes en guerre, mais nous lui ferons plier le genou une fois que nous en serons sortis victorieux."
 qiefor.69.d3: "Chen Tiaoyuan, chef de la clique d'Anqing, a refusé notre demande d'alliance. Ceci même après avoir vaincu le plus grand ennemi de la Chine et montré que nous sommes le gouvernement légitime ! Nous ne pouvons montrer aucune faiblesse."
 qiefor.69.a: "Il paiera pour cela"

 qiefor.70.t: "Coopération sur le canal d'Anqing"
 qiefor.70.d: "Le Conseil de Liaison de Beijing a une nouvelle fois réussi. Il a remarqué qu'Anqing avait récemment réalisé d'importants travaux de digues et de canaux, notamment l'achèvement de l'énorme canal Subei. Il a maintenant obtenu la coopération d'Anqing pour les travaux de digues dans le Hebei et à Kaifeng. Les travaux peuvent commencer dès que l'on veut."
 qiefor.70.a: "Excellent"

 qiefor.71.t: "Coopération Militaire avec Anqing"
 qiefor.71.d: "Anqing fait maintenant partie de notre alliance, et la prochaine étape doit être une coopération militaire plus étroite. Nous avons déjà fait le premier pas, puisque le Conseil de Liaison de Beijing a mis en place une Commission de Coopération des Armées. Nous devons maintenant décider si nous voulons dépenser des ressources pour améliorer les armées d'Anqing, car elles sont assez désuètes et basées sur des tactiques de seigneur de guerre ancestrales. Les avantages sont évidents, car non seulement cela améliorerait leurs capacités de combat en temps de guerre, mais cela nous permettrait également d'exercer une influence précieuse sur elles."
 qiefor.71.a: "Nous les aiderons"
 qiefor.71.b: "Ils devront se débrouiller seuls"

 qiefor.72.t: "Anqing refuse de pousser davantage la coopération militaire"
 qiefor.72.d: "Malheureusement, Anqing a refusé davantage de coopération militaire pour le moment. Ils n'auront cependant pas d'autres choix que de se rendre compte que cette coopération est essentielle si nous souhaitons pouvoir monter une défense solide contre nos ennemis communs. Nous pouvons réessayer à l'avenir."
 qiefor.72.a: "Très bien"

 qiefor.73.t: "La coopération militaire est achevée"
 qiefor.73.d: "Les projets de la Commission de Coopération des Armées qui visaient à intensifier la coordination et la communication entre les forces de Qing et d'Anqing sont maintenant terminés. Bien que davantage soit toujours préférable, nous pouvons être satisfaits des résultats et des améliorations apportées aux armées d'Anqing."
 qiefor.73.a: "C'est bien"

 qiefor.74.t: "Anqing refuse la Conférence"
 qiefor.74.d: "Étrangement, Chen Tiaoyuan a carrément refusé d'organiser une conférence pour discuter de l'avenir de notre pays. C'est tout à fait scandaleux et ce n'est pas quelque chose que nous attendions d'un homme comme Chen. Nous devons nous assurer qu'il reste dans notre orbite. Nous n'oublierons pas qu'il a fait ça."
 qiefor.74.a: "Maudit soit-il !"

 qiefor.75.t: "Fin de la Conférence"
 qiefor.75.d1: "La conférence a été un succès complet ! Chen s'est montré très ouvert sur plusieurs fronts et les progrès réalisés ont été énormes. Cet événement restera très certainement dans les mémoires comme étant d'importance critique dans l'histoire de la Chine, et il marquera le début d'une intégration accélérée entre les Zhili du Nord et du Sud."
 qiefor.75.d2: "La conférence a été un succès, mais peut-être pas autant que nous l'avions espéré. Chen Tiaoyuan et d'autres membres de la délégation étaient prêts à accepter certaines de nos propositions, mais ont refusé encore plus. C'est malheureux, mais nous avons quand même fait des progrès significatifs."
 qiefor.75.d3: "Malheureusement, malgré tous nos efforts, la plupart de nos propositions actuelles ont été refusées par la délégation d'Anqing. Toute cette conférence est un échec politique complet. C'est frustrant, car il semblait que Chen était prêt à poursuivre les pourparlers d'intégration !"
 qiefor.75.a: "Bonnes nouvelles"
 qiefor.75.b: "Bon sang !"

 qiefor.76.t: "Dalu Yinhang et Anqing"
 qiefor.76.d: "Dalu Yinhang, la Banque Continentale, est l'une de nos principales banques commerciales. Récemment, grâce à une initiative coordonnée par le Conseil de Liaison de Beijing, elle a fait des investissements importants dans la Clique d'Anqing pour l'aider à développer son industrie. Nous pourrions potentiellement tirer parti de cela pour accroître notre influence sur Anqing. Tout d'abord, nous pourrions offrir des prêts supplémentaires par le biais d'autres banques. Cela pourrait cependant peser sur nos propres ressources. Nous pourrions également décider de les laisser rembourser le prêt à des conditions plus favorables. Dalu Yinhang devrait être capable de gérer cela, mais ils pourraient ne pas être contents. Que ferons-nous ?"
 qiefor.76.a: "Consentir davantage de prêts"
 qiefor.76.b: "Améliorer les conditions"
 qiefor.76.c: "Rien"

 qiefor.77.t: "Anqing répond à notre offre"
 qiefor.77.d1: "L'offre concernant les prêts de la Dalu Yinhang que nous avons faite à Anqing devait être vraiment très avantageuse. Ils ont accepté et se sont également engagés à prendre des mesures supplémentaires concernant la poursuite de l'intégration. Cela devrait certainement aider à faire d'une Chine unie une réalité."
 qiefor.77.d2: "Malheureusement, ce que nous avons offert n'était pas suffisant pour Anqing, ils l'ont complètement rejeté. Encore une fois, Chen Tiaoyuan a décidé de réduire nos efforts à néant, même s'il est évident que c'est dans l'intérêt de toute la Chine !"
 qiefor.77.a: "Bonnes nouvelles !"
 qiefor.77.b: "Malheureux"

 qiefor.78.t: "Wu rencontre des anti-concessionistes d'Anqing"
 qiefor.78.d: "Afin d'accroître le soutien à Anqing pour l'unification avec les Qing sans avoir à passer par Chen Tiaoyuan, Wu a décidé de rencontrer un certain nombre de dirigeants de la Ligue Anti-Concessions, la plus grande organisation représentant le mouvement anti-concessions, habituellement désorganisé. La Ligue elle-même est divisée en deux factions, dont l'une est pro-républicaine et collabore avec la Vermillion Society. L'autre est plus au goût de Wu car elle soutient la monarchie Qing et pense que l'unification est nécessaire dès que possible. Le groupe pro-Vermillion a été un peu un obstacle à l'unification, et Wu a donc insisté pour qu'il fasse également partie de la réunion.\n\nLes dirigeants ont été impressionnés par les paroles du Maréchal et par ses récentes actions et politiques au sein du gouvernement Qing. Il leur a également confié secrètement qu'il préférait aussi une Chine sans Empereur, mais qu'une monarchie constitutionnelle permettait aux deux camps d'avoir ce qu'ils voulaient. Il leur a juré qu'il ne permettrait jamais à Puyi de nuire à la Chine. Les paroles de Wu en ont rassuré plus d'un et ont même convaincu certains, qui avaient auparavant été passivement pro-républicains, de soutenir l'unification immédiate."
 qiefor.78.a: "Excellent"

 qiefor.79.t: "Aide à la reconstruction d'Anqing"
 qiefor.79.d: "La Clique d'Anqing a décidé d'adopter une approche coopérative pour s'attaquer à la grande reconstruction nécessaire pour remettre leur pays sur pied. Par le biais de plus petites initiatives, Qing aide déjà et fournit une aide significative. Nous pourrions intensifier notre action au niveau national et fournir davantage d'aide à ce niveau. Cependant, cela nous limiterait au moins pour un court moment."
 qiefor.79.a: "Aidez-les davantage"
 qiefor.79.b: "Nous en faisons déjà assez"

 qiefor.80.t: "Qing demande l'intégration !"
 qiefor.80.d: "Maintenant que nous sommes dans leur alliance et que nous sommes devenus très proches de leur gouvernement, le gouvernement Qing a décidé qu'il était temps d'achever l'unification. Bien qu'une Chine unie soit agréable, cela signifierait la fin presque certaine de notre autonomie précieuse. Serons-nous d'accord, pour le bien de la Chine ?"
 qiefor.80.a: "Oui, l'unification est urgente"
 qiefor.80.b: "Non, l'autonomie importe encore plus"

 qiefor.81.t: "La Chine Orientale est Unifiée !"
 qiefor.81.d: "L'Anqing a accepté, ce qui signifie que la Chine Orientale est enfin unie !"
 qiefor.81.a: "Unis, nous sommes forts"

 qiefor.82.t: "L'Anqing refuse !"
 qiefor.82.d: "L'Anqing a refusé l'intégration ! Ils osent s'opposer à l'unification, même lorsqu'elle est si nécessaire dans nos batailles à venir. Malheureusement, nous ne pouvons pas faire grand-chose pour le moment."
 qiefor.82.a: "Ils s'y résoudront"

 qiefor.83.t: "Qing demande l'intégration !"
 qiefor.83.d: "Maintenant que nous sommes dans leur alliance et que nous sommes devenus très proches de leur gouvernement, le gouvernement Qing a décidé qu'il était temps d'achever l'unification. Le Gouvernement Fengtian est vaincu et la Chine a montré qu'elle pouvait même tenir le Japon à distance. Il est donc temps que nous nous unissions."
 qiefor.83.a: "Oui, le temps est venu"
 qiefor.83.b: "Non, ce ne sera jamais le bon moment"

 qiefor.84.t: "L'Anqing refuse !"
 qiefor.84.d: "L'Anqing a rejeté notre proposition d'unification. Cela même lorsque nous avons vaincu Fengtian et tenu le Japon à l'écart. Nous pouvons attendre et demander à nouveau, mais ils ne seront pas si faciles à convaincre la prochaine fois."
 qiefor.84.a: "Nous devrons réessayer"

 qiefor.85.t: "L'Anqing refuse à nouveau !"
 qiefor.85.d: "Anqing a rejeté notre proposition d'unification pour la seconde fois. Il est maintenant clair qu'ils sont des traîtres à notre cause."
 qiefor.85.a: "La guerre est notre seule option"

 qiefor.86.t: "Wu Peifu s'en prend à nous !"
 qiefor.86.d: "Après la mort du Maréchal de la Ligue Sun Chuanfang, nous avions espéré que notre \"allié\" à Beijing, Wu Peifu, resterait fidèle à nos intérêts. Cependant, il semble qu'il ait décidé de se retourner contre nous et d'adopter publiquement une position anti-concession. Si cela a renforcé le soutien à son régime impopulaire, cela signifie qu'il a exigé que la Commission Beijing, notre organe de lobbying à Beijing, quitte la ville. Face à des émeutes massives devant les portes de leurs bureaux, la plupart des membres ont fui à Tianjin ! Notre ambassadeur a également envoyé tout le personnel non essentiel à Tianjin, laissant un groupe réduit d'agents consulaires étroitement surveillés par les forces de Wu."
 qiefor.86.a: "Maudit soit-il !"

 qiefor.87.t: "Émeutes à Beijing !"
 qiefor.87.d: "Depuis que le maréchal Wu Peifu a refusé d'intervenir dans l'effondrement de la Ligue des Huit Provinces, nos agents à Beijing ont fait état d'une aura de tension et de malaise, l'inaction de Wu ayant offensé tous les principaux blocs de pouvoir au sein de son propre gouvernement. Ces tensions ont explosé en conflit ouvert lorsqu'un groupe de généraux Zhili mécontents, alliés à une clique de jeunes officiers radicaux et à la noblesse mandchoue, ont tenté d'assassiner Wu et le président Cao Kun et de "restaurer" l'empereur Puyi ! Pire encore, ce coup d'État a été utilisé comme une occasion d'attaquer les intérêts allemands, en tirant parti de notre impopularité dans le pays pour soutenir ce nouveau régime bancal. Des émeutes massives ont éclaté devant notre ambassade et les bureaux de la commission pékinoise, et notre ambassadeur a ordonné à tout le personnel non essentiel de quitter la ville pour la sécurité relative de Tianjin."
 qiefor.87.a: "Malédictions !"

 qiefor.90.t: "Beijing semble faible."
 qiefor.90.d: "Alors que le régime de Pékin continue à concentrer de plus en plus de forces vers le sud et l'ouest, il est devenu beaucoup trop sourd à nos forces positionnées juste de l'autre côté de la frontière, en Mandchourie. Au fil des jours, certaines unités entreprenantes ont franchi ce qui était autrefois une frontière étroitement tenue. Les premières unités n'ayant trouvé que peu d'opposition à leur avancée, cela s'est rapidement transformé en une course folle d'officiers trop enthousiastes essayant de prétendre qu'ils étaient les premiers à atteindre Pékin.Alors que les hommes atteignaient finalement les faubourgs de Pékin, la police locale a commencé à riposter et des manifestations régionalistes ont éclaté à Shenyang, suivies de grèves des chemins de fer à Shanhuaiguan. Par crainte d'une extension excessive, des ordres venus d'en haut réduisent toute nouvelle avancée dans la province de Jingzhao. Comme Pékin est à portée de vue de la nouvelle frontière de Fengtian, il reste à voir combien de temps il faudra attendre avant que le grand maréchal n'ordonne sa capture."
 qiefor.90.a: "Cette défaite est la porte ouverte à de nombreuses victoires."

 qiefor.91.t: "Nous avons tressailli."
 qiefor.91.d: "Alors que la guerre à l'ouest et au sud n'a pas permis au nouveau gouvernement de remporter la victoire, notre grand rival au nord a finalement fait un pas en avant. Les soldats de Fengtian ont avancé sans grande résistance, car nous étions trop faibles pour les contrer. Heureusement, à l'extérieur de Pékin, des unités de police locales ont pu organiser une défense de dernière minute de la ville et des tirs d'artillerie provenant de l'arrière des lignes de Fengtian semblent avoir touché leurs propres troupes qui avançaient. Bien que nous ayons perdu beaucoup de terrain dans cette offensive soudaine, la capitale tient toujours."
 qiefor.91.a: "Si nous gagnons une autre bataille de ce type, nous serons complètement perdus."

 qiefor.101.t: "Yang Sen tient bon"
 qiefor.101.d: "Notre allié au Sichuan, le gouverneur Yang Sen, est sorti vainqueur de la guerre civile dans sa province ! C'est une excellente nouvelle pour le Sichuan et notre gouvernement, car une fois que Yan aura stabilisé le contrôle dans sa région, nous pouvons le faire rejoindre notre alliance."
 qiefor.101.a: "Excellent !"

 qiefor.102.t: "[SZC.GetLeader] prend le contrôle du Sichuan !"
 qiefor.102.d: "Les nouvelles sont graves, sire ! Il semble que [SZC.GetLeader] a vaincu notre allié Yang Sen au Sichuan ! Bien qu'il s'agisse d'une perte majeure pour la clique du Zhili, la province est industriellement pauvre et militairement débordée. S'ils rejoignent une faction adverse, nous les écraserons !"
 qiefor.102.a: "Bon sang !"

 qiefor.103.t: "Soulèvement en Fujian !"
 qiefor.103.d: "Alors que la plupart des Chinois et du monde supposaient que le Kuomintang avait été détruit en 1927, le Maréchal de la Ligue Sun menait depuis lors un conflit de guérilla de faible intensité avec les restes du KMT dans la région de Fujian. Les rapports étaient censurés par la presse et même Wu Peifu ignorait la véritable ampleur du conflit, Sun gardant tous les détails sous silence.\n\nCependant, avec le chaos actuel dans la Ligue, les restes du KMT ont réapparu et ont déclaré une nouvelle campagne de réunification nationale ! Ils ont dénoncé notre gouvernement légitime comme étant illégitime, nous qualifiant d'\"à peine plus qu'une marionnette allemande, esclave des caprices de Berlin\" ! Nous ne pouvons qu'espérer que les restes des forces de Sun puissent mettre à terre ces traîtres."
 qiefor.103.a: "Des traîtres méprisables !"

 qiefor.104.t: "Le Hunan fait sécession de la Ligue !"
 qiefor.104.d: "La province du Hunan était tombée sous l'emprise de Sun Chuanfang pendant le chaos qui a suivi l'expédition du Nord de 1927. Le gouverneur Zhao Hengti a repris le contrôle de la province après une brève période de règne du KMT. Allié de longue date de Wu, Zhao est gouverneur de la région depuis 1920. Cependant, il a également des liens avec le \"gouvernement\" fédéraliste du Guangxi, soutenant tacitement le modèle fédéral. Pour l'instant, il a adopté une position strictement neutre, déchiré entre son amitié personnelle pour Wu et sa loyauté politique envers Chen Jiongming. Sa neutralité ne pourra cependant pas durer longtemps, car des nuages commencent déjà à s'amonceler autour de son gouvernement de la province."
 qiefor.104.a: "Par chance, le vieil ami de Wu reste fidèle..."

 qiefor.105.t: "Yiguandao prend le contrôle du Shandong !"
 qiefor.105.d: "La secte ésotérique et millénaire connue sous le nom de Yiguandao aurait pris le contrôle de la province de Shandong, évinçant notre ancien gouverneur Zhang Zongchang ! Alors qu'au départ, on craignait que cette secte ne crée le chaos dans nos contrées, les esprits raisonnables ont prévalu, soulignant la loyauté bien documentée de Zhang envers les Fengtian. La secte est isolée, et une fois que le chaos au sud se sera stabilisé, nous pourrons peut-être les attaquer, bien que cela puisse causer des troubles avec le nombre important d'adhérents de la religion sur notre territoire."
 qiefor.105.a: "Intéressant..."

 qiefor.106.t: "Zhang Zhongchang rompt les liens avec Beijing !"
 qiefor.106.d: "La position du gouverneur du Shandong, Zhang Zongchang, a toujours été, au mieux, précaire. Homme erratique et violent, Zhang avait auparavant des liens étroits avec Zhang Zuolin du gouvernement de Fengtian, bien qu'il ait été maintenu fidèle à Beijing par des pots-de-vin et des commissions somptueuses. Il semble qu'il ait profité du chaos qui règne dans le sud pour nous écarter. Ce matin, un certain nombre de nos collecteurs d'impôts ont été arrêtés à la frontière provinciale, et les espions de la province rapportent qu'il a procédé à des purges massives de loyalistes Qing. Pire encore, ils rapportent qu'il a pris contact avec Zhang Zuolin et les Japonais !"
 qiefor.106.a: "Sois maudit, Misérable Général !"

 qiefor.107.t: "Zhang Zhongchang a été arrêté !"
 qiefor.107.d: "Plus tôt dans la journée, le gouverneur Zhang Zongchang du Shandong a été arrêté par des magistrats relevant de Qu Yingguang, un loyaliste Qing et un érudit confucéen de la province. Alors que normalement l'arrestation d'un gouverneur serait une cause d'inquiétude, Zhang avait des liens bien documentés avec le régime Fengtian et le Japon, et beaucoup dans l'entourage de Wu craignaient qu'il profite du chaos qui enveloppe actuellement le sud pour rompre les liens avec notre gouvernement et déclarer sa loyauté à Zhang Zuolin. Ces craintes ont été dissipées, car le nouveau gouverneur Qu a promis qu'il soutiendrait notre gouvernement dans la province."
 qiefor.107.a: "Enfin de bonnes nouvelles !"

 qiefor.108.d: "La province du Sichuan, longtemps en proie à la surpopulation et aux pénuries alimentaires, a sombré dans la guerre civile ! Depuis la restauration de 1927, Yang Sen, un ami personnel proche et allié de Wu Peifu, a dirigé la province, mais au cours des dernières années, son contrôle a commencé à s'effriter. Diverses autres factions fidèles au régime de Fengtian, les restes du Kuomintang et les isolationnistes fidèles à eux-mêmes ont commencé à consolider leur pouvoir et ont profité de l'effondrement de la Ligue pour lancer des attaques contre le gouvernement désormais chancelant de Yang. Yang ne nous a pas encore demandé d'aide directe, préférant cacher l'ampleur des troubles, mais Wu s'attend à ce que son vieil ami vienne chercher de l'aide à n'importe quel moment."

 qiefor.109.d: "Liangguang, une coalition de deux des huit anciennes provinces de la Ligue éponyme, a fait sécession à la fois de la Ligue et de notre régime, ce matin. Sous le commandement du savant-bureaucrate Chen Jiongming, soutenu par le seigneur de guerre Ma Ji, les provinces ont déclaré notre gouvernement « totalement illégitime » et promis une « fin rapide à la monarchie autocratique et anachronique »."

 qiefor.135.d: "Nous avons maintenu plusieurs garnisons dans le Shanxi oriental depuis la fin de la dernière guerre de Zhifeng, lorsque Yan Xishan a rejoint Zhang Zuolin et la clique des Fengtian contre notre gouvernement restauré. En théorie, notre contrôle de la région constitue un tampon important et prive Yan de ressources s'il se retourne contre nous, mais certains conseillers ont proposé de négocier avec lui. On pourrait empêcher Yan de se retourner contre nous, ce qui nous épargnerait tout conflit à l'ouest, si nous promettons de lui rendre le reste de sa province. Tant que nous ne lui rendons que les terres après notre victoire sur Fengtian, nous n'avons rien à perdre.\n\nD'autres conseillers suggèrent que la \"neutralité\" souvent évoquée de Yan n'est qu'une farce, comme l'a prouvé la dernière guerre, et que nous ne ferions que perdre du temps en l'approchant."
 qiefor.135.a: "Cela vaut la peine d'essayer"
 qiefor.135.b: "On ne peut pas faire confiance à Yan"

 qiefor.138.t: "Shanxi a accepté notre offre"
 qiefor.138.d: "Yan Xishan a accepté notre offre, sécurisant notre flanc occidental, même au prix du Shanxi Oriental après notre victoire éventuelle."
 qiefor.138.a: "Nous verrons maintenant si Yan est un homme de parole..."

 qiefor.139.t: "Yan Xishan fait une contre-proposition"
 qiefor.139.d: "Apparemment peu disposé à se fier uniquement à notre parole, Yan Xishan a accepté notre offre à une condition : nous devons immédiatement lui remettre le Shanxi Oriental. Cela nous priverait bien entendu d'une région précieuse et d'une profondeur stratégique considérable, où Yan pourrait nous trahir.\n\nD'un autre côté, Yan a peut-être tiré la leçon de la dernière guerre, et avec sa province réunie, il pourrait être moins enclin à rejoindre Fengtian contre nous."
 qiefor.139.a: "Nous acceptons, le Shanxi Oriental est à lui"
 qiefor.139.b: "Il doit accepter notre proposition initiale"

 qiefor.140.t: "Beijing accepte la contre-proposition"
 qiefor.140.d: "Le gouvernement de Wu Peifu à Beijing a accepté notre contre-proposition, et le Shanxi Oriental est à nouveau à nous. Dans l'intervalle, le gouvernement Qing, et les Allemands en particulier, ont manifestement beaucoup fait pour développer la région. Maintenant, c'est à nous de faire ce que nous voulons."
 qiefor.140.a: "Excellentes nouvelles !"

 qiefor.141.t: "Beijing refuse la contre-proposition"
 qiefor.141.d: "Malheureusement, Wu Peifu a rejeté d'emblée notre contre-proposition. Peut-être avons-nous surestimé notre influence."
 qiefor.141.a: "Alors nous devons accepter leur proposition initiale"
 qiefor.141.b: "Annuler les négociations"

 qiefor.142.t: "Un accord est négocié entre le Shanxi et Beijing"
 qiefor.142.d1: "Au cours des derniers jours de la quatrième guerre de Zhifeng, les troupes Qing ont occupé le Shanxi Oriental et y sont restées depuis - le tampon de Wu Peifu contre une deuxième « trahison ». Maintenant, Wu et Yan Xishan ont signé de manière inattendue un pacte de non-agression, impliquant que le Shanxi Oriental sera bientôt rendu à son propriétaire légitime. Anticipant probablement une attaque du nord, Wu a sécurisé son flanc oriental. Du moins pour l'instant."
 qiefor.142.d2: "Au cours des derniers jours de la quatrième guerre de Zhifeng, les troupes Qing ont occupé le Shanxi Oriental et y sont restées depuis - le tampon de Wu Peifu contre une deuxième « trahison ». Maintenant, Wu et Yan Xishan ont signé de manière inattendue un pacte de non-agression, et que le Shanxi a été rendu à son propriétaire légitime. Anticipant probablement une attaque du nord, Wu a sécurisé son flanc oriental. Du moins pour l'instant."

 qiefor.144.a: "Les temps changent"

 qiefor.145.t: "Le Gouvernement de Wuhan de [QIE.GetName] est fini"
 qiefor.145.d: "En fin de compte, la décision désespérée de [QIE.GetName] de déplacer sa capitale à Wuhan n'a pas fait de différence, et le pays se tourne à nouveau vers Beijing comme capitale nationale, comme il le fait depuis plus de quatre siècles. Cependant, l'unification de Wuchang, Hankou et Hanyang sous une seule administration, aussi brève soit-elle, ne peut être annulée aussi facilement - les trois villes ont déjà dérivé ensemble pendant des décennies, et semblent maintenant inséparables."
 qiefor.145.a: "Comme cela devrait être"

 qiefor.146.t: "Il est temps de retourner à Beijing"
 qiefor.146.d: "Notre victoire achevée, le moment est venu de ramener notre capitale à Beijing. Cependant, l'unification de Wuchang, Hankou et Hanyang sous une seule administration, aussi brève soit-elle, ne peut pas être annulée si facilement -  les trois villes ayant déjà entretenu d'étroites relations pendant des décennies, et semblent maintenant inséparables."

 qiefor.150.t: "Les garnisons de [QIE.GetName] se retirent de Shanxi"
 qiefor.150.d: "Après de nombreuses années, les garnisons du gouvernement central ont finalement quitté le Shanxi Oriental, ouvrant la voie à un retour de notre souveraineté. Il semble qu'ils aient honoré leur parole."
 qiefor.150.a: "Enfin"

#Flavour Events
 qieflavor.1.t: "Bordel illégal perquisitionné !"
 qieflavor.1.d: "Une pluie froide tombait du ciel lorsque Zhang Beijiao, chef de l'escouade des vices du département de police de Beijing, ordonna à ses hommes de prendre position autour d'un bâtiment d'apparence délabrée à la périphérie de la ville. Une douce musique se faisait entendre de l'intérieur et des volutes de fumée s'élevaient des fenêtres.\n\n« Qu'en pensez-vous – de la drogue ou des filles ? » demanda le commandant en second de Zhang. « Les deux, et je vous dois un déjeuner si je me trompe. » Zhang étouffa sa cigarette et siffla bruyamment. La porte d'entrée fut ouverte et une demi-douzaine d'hommes s'engouffrèrent dans une salle faiblement éclairée. « Police - personne ne bouge ! » cria Zhang, alors que des hommes et des femmes à divers stades de nudité se précipitaient dans le hall, criant et pleurant. Le commandant en second fronça les sourcils tandis que Zhang brandissait un sac d'opium. « Je suppose que vous achèterez votre propre déjeuner demain. »\n\nDéployés dans le bâtiment, les policiers arrêtaient les prostituées et les trafiquants de drogue. C'était un bon coup de filet. De l'opium, du chanvre et même de la cocaïne, un produit de luxe allemand, se trouvaient là en grande quantité. Mais juste au moment où Zhang était sur le point d'ordonner à ses hommes de ramener les prostituées et leurs clients au poste, un de ses officiers subalternes l'appela. « Monsieur ! Vous devriez voir ça ! » Zhang n'en croyait pas ses yeux - parmi la file de clients, un grand homme blond et blanc était visible comme le nez au milieu du visage. « La légation allemande en entendra parler ! » dit-il dans un chinois mal accentué. « J'ai des amis haut placés ! »\n\nL'arrestation de l'homme donnerait au gouvernement central un levier indispensable pour freiner l'influence allemande, mais en même temps serait politiquement coûteuse pour le gouvernement. D'un autre côté, qui sait ce qui pourrait arriver si Zhang laissait partir l'homme..."
 qieflavor.1.a: "Zhang l'arrête."
 qieflavor.1.b: "Zhang le laisse partir."

 qieflavor.2.t: "Scandale à Beijing !"
 qieflavor.2.d: "Il y a quelques jours, Hans Schröder, un jeune diplomate prometteur de la Peking-Kommission, a été arrêté sous de fausses accusations de sollicitation de mineurs et de prostituées illégales. Le gouvernement de Beijing a utilisé ce prétexte pour repousser plusieurs réformes soutenues par l'Allemagne et proposées par la Ligue de la Prospérité, notre groupe de pression à l'Assemblée Nationale. Bien qu'en fin de compte un scandale mineur, cela nous a encore plus touchés que nous ne voudrions l'admettre."
 qieflavor.2.a: "Bon sang !"

 qieflavor.3.t: "Corruption au sein de la police de Beijing ?"
 qieflavor.3.d: "When Vice Captain Zhang Beijiao made the strategic decision to release Hans Schröder, the young diplomat from the German Legation in Beijing he found in an illegal brothel, we thought we’d heard the last of him. But now it appears one of the men on his team was enraged by the lapse in punishment, and reported the news to one of Beijing’s underground printing presses. Existing in a legal grey zone, these pamphleteers often publish scathing critiques of the Harmony Association’s government through thinly-veiled allegorical poems, historical analogies, and other ‘respectable’ topics to skirt by government censorship laws.\n\nThis time, however, they published a full-blown attack on the ‘corruption’ of the Beijing police department and compared the situation to the murder of Lin Weixi by British sailors in 1839, the spark that set off the First Opium War. While we’ve tried to shut down publication of this pamphlet, it has quickly spiralled out of control and has incited small protests and riots."
 qieflavor.3.a: "Bon sang !"

 qieflavor.4.t: "L'Allemand à Peking est séduit par la beauté Orientale !"
 qieflavor.4.d: "Les tabloïds du pays sont en effervescence au sujet d'une histoire arrivée de Beijing. Hans Schröder, un jeune attaché diplomatique au consulat de Beijing, a été appréhendé par la police, après qu'elle a perquisitionné une maison close illégale qui vendait également de la drogue. Il semble que le chef de la police ait décidé de laisser Schröder partir sans même un avertissement, craignant probablement des répercussions politiques. Or, la ville est actuellement bloquée par des émeutes antiallemandes, et de nombreux membres du SPD remettent en question l'intérêt de nous maintenir en Chine en continu.\n\nOtto Wels, haut dirigeant du SPD, a prononcé un discours cinglant au Reichstag en réponse au scandale. « Alors qu'avant la position du Parti était que l'intervention en Chine était inutile, il est maintenant clair que l'intervention nuit activement au peuple chinois. Notre présence militaire continue sape l'état de droit chinois et leurs tentatives de construire un pays stable et fonctionnel avec lequel nous pouvons nous associer contre le Japon."
 qieflavor.4.a: "Bon sang !"

 qieflavor.5.t: "Silence des Médias"
 qieflavor.5.d: "Il semble que notre décision de laisser partir le jeune Allemand que nous avons appréhendé lors d'un raid dans un bordel s'est avérée meilleure que prévu. Le garçon a été transféré à Tianjin, et Zhang Beijiao, le policier qui l'a laissé partir, a reçu une augmentation pour récompenser sa \"réflexion politique rapide\"."
 qieflavor.5.a: "Enfin, de bonnes nouvelles !"

 qieflavor.7.t: "Le Prince Rui exige une commission !"
 qieflavor.7.d: "Aisin-Gioro Zaixun, prince Rui et ministre de la marine dans le gouvernement de 1911, est venu nous voir avec une requête. Suite à la promotion des jeunes partisans du coup d'état de l'académie de Baoding, il demande une commission navale complète ! S'il est vrai que beaucoup d'amiraux ont des liens persistants avec le Zhili, ils nous sont pour la plupart loyaux. Zaixun, bien qu'il ait beaucoup voyagé pour étudier les marines étrangères, n'a jamais commandé un navire au combat, et beaucoup sont sceptiques quant à ses réelles prouesses navales."
 qieflavor.7.a: "Offrez lui une promotion."
 qieflavor.7.b: "Pardon ? Bien sûr que non !"

 qieflavor.8.t: "Les bandits se déchaînent !"
 qieflavor.8.d: "Les "soldats de la forêt" que nous avons engagés sont devenus sauvages ! Au cours des dernières semaines, ils ont pillé des villes amies et ont même attaqué les troupes gouvernementales pour s'emparer des femmes et du butin ! Que devons-nous faire ?"
 qieflavor.8.a: "Arrêtez-les et exécutez-les !"
 qieflavor.8.b: "Qu'ils restent."

 qieflavor.9.t: "Le Lindbergh de l'Est"
 qieflavor.9.d: "Un jeune pilote nommé Sun Tonggang a acquis une grande renommée pour avoir survolé l'Eurasie dans son avion qu'il a lui-même construit. Avec les récents bouleversements au sein de la Ligue, il s'est porté volontaire pour servir notre nation en tant que pilote, détruisant nos ennemis du ciel ! Basé à l'origine à Nanjing, il a fui le chaos qui enveloppe actuellement la ville pour atteindre notre territoire, grâce à son petit avion."
 qieflavor.9.a: "Excellent !"

 qieflavor.10.t: "Un réfugié de New-York"
 qieflavor.10.d: "Edith Clifford Williams, artiste, auteur et bibliothécaire américaine, a entretenu une correspondance de longue date avec Hu Shih après leur rencontre à New York, alors que Hu étudiait à l'université Columbia de New York. Elle a eu une immense influence sur le développement de la pensée politique de Hu, et on soupçonne (bien que cela ne soit pas confirmé) que les deux ont été brièvement amants.\n\nCependant, alors que la guerre ravage l'Amérique, Williams a écrit à Shih pour lui demander l'asile et le statut de réfugié en Chine. Hu a accepté, et Williams est actuellement en route pour Beijing à bord d'un bateau."
 qieflavor.10.a: "Bienvenue en Chine !"

 qieflavor.11.t: "Le Ding Houmuwu"
 qieflavor.11.d: "Des fouilles archéologiques autour d'Anyang, dans la province du Henan, ont mis au jour un énorme vase funéraire en bronze de la dynastie Shang. Considéré comme le plus grand bronze antique au monde, sa découverte a été célébrée dans le monde entier comme une grande victoire pour la culture et l'histoire chinoises. Avec la menace du Japon qui se profile cependant, les archéologues ont réenterré le sarcophage, espérant qu'une fois que nous aurons vaincu le Japon, nous pourrons l'exposer en toute sécurité dans un musée."
 qieflavor.11.a: "Une grande victoire pour la culture Chinoise !"

 qieflavor.12.t: "La Clique des Stratégies des Royaumes Combattants"
 qieflavor.12.d: "Après l'ascension du PJC, une organisation composée d'intellectuels ayant étudié en Allemagne, appelée la \"Clique de Zhan Guo Ce\", a vu le jour. Ils croient en l'étatisme, l'autoritarisme et la philosophie surhumaine de Nietzsche, mais adaptés aux circonstances chinoises, en promouvant un mélange ésotérique de confucianisme et de pensée philosophique nietzschéenne. En particulier, ils considèrent l'histoire récente de la Chine, et son avenir proche, comme une répétition des périodes historiques \"cycliques\" des États en guerre ; des périodes brutales, sans compromis, dans lesquelles les faibles sont, l'un après l'autre, consommés par les forts. Ils estiment donc que la formation d'une nation forte est primordiale, mais ont une vision pluraliste du nationalisme chinois.\n\nDes groupes affiliés à cette école de pensée ont commencé à apparaître dans les grandes universités chinoises et apportent un grand crédit à notre nouveau gouvernement."
 qieflavor.12.a:0 "Intéressant."

 qieflavor.13.t: "Un jeu de cartes jusqu'au bout de la nuit"
 qieflavor.13.d: "La nuit est tombée sur le Palais Présidentiel nouvellement inauguré à Beijing alors que le Président [QIE.GetLeader] et Wu Peifu jouaient une partie de cartes en soirée. Les deux hommes discutent de politique, d'actualité et de l'état actuel du monde. [QIE.GetLeader] a joué une excellente main tandis que Wu le regardait à travers des yeux étroits.\n\n\"Vous pourriez savourer la main que vous venez de jouer\". commença Wu. \"Mais rappelez-vous - qui vous a donné les cartes qui vous ont permis d'être assis dans ce bâtiment ?\"\n\n [QIE.GetLeader] a levé un sourcil. \"La Convention Constitutionnelle m'a choisi, bien sûr.\"\n\n\"Vous le croyez *vraiment* ?\" demanda Wu. \"Je pensais que vous étiez bien plus intelligent que cela.\"\n\n[QIE.GetLeader] s'est penché en arrière sur sa chaise. \"L'État est seulement aussi fort que son armée, je suppose. Mais vous n'êtes pas immortel. Un jour, nous aurons besoin d'une véritable démocratie, une fois que notre période de direction de la nation aura pris fin.\"\n\n\"Nous verrons,\" dit Wu, en allumant une cigarette et en regardant la ville."
 qieflavor.13.a: "D'où naît le pouvoir politique ?"

 qieflavor.14.t: "Un général exilé des Qing arrive"
 qieflavor.14.d: "Bien que notre armée n'atteigne pas le niveau de loyauté observé dans les puissances occidentales, nous sommes fiers de la méritocratie. Les commandants et les maréchaux que vous voyez sur le champ de bataille ont prouvé leur loyauté envers leur chef et le peuple. D'un autre côté, la victoire pourrait dépendre de la volonté mortelle de certains commandants plus mercenaires, ceux qui sont prêts à faire ou à mourir. Cet homme nous vient du tumultueux Qing, dont les cliques se sont largement appuyées sur des commandants mercenaires par le passé. Le général nous raconte une histoire larmoyante sur la façon dont les marées se sont retournées contre lui, et il nous est arrivé en haillons, prêt à se battre pour une fois. Il est difficile de déterminer s'il est sincère, mais nous devons décider s'il vaut la peine d'être recruté en ces temps de trahison."
 qieflavor.14.a: "Nous avons besoin de toute l'aide que nous pouvons nous procurer"
 qieflavor.14.b: "Non, il pourrait être un handicap"

 qieflavor.15.t: "[ANQ.GetLeader] reconnait notre leadership"
 qieflavor.15.d: "Le gouverneur Chen Tiaoyuan d'Anqing a aujourd'hui officiellement réaffirmé le leadership de Puyi sur la Chine, dans un discours radiodiffusé sur son territoire. Bien qu'il ait admis au départ avoir trouvé l'idée d'un empereur anachronique, il a poursuivi en approuvant avec enthousiasme notre nouvelle position anti-concession et le dévouement de Puyi à la cause. Il a conclu son discours avec admiration pour la direction de la clique Zhili. « Une figure de proue apolitique peut être utile dans un État moderne. Et avec Wu Peifu et Cao Kun à la tête de notre grande nation, nous pouvons chasser la racaille étrangère qui a pollué notre pays et lui redonner sa grandeur !\n\nLe discours a été bien accueilli par les intellectuels de Beijing et d'autres zones urbaines, et certains ont commencé à déserter la NCERA et le YCP pour l'Association Harmonie, renforçant notre popularité et notre légitimité auprès de la population en général."
 qieflavor.15.a: "Excellentes nouvelles !"

 qieflavor.16.t: "Chen Tiaoyuan - Gouverneur Modèle"
 qieflavor.16.d: "Chen Tiaoyuan, gouverneur d'Anqing, a consolidé son pouvoir après sa victoire sur la clique de Nanjing, lors de l'effondrement de la Ligue, et bien qu'il fasse techniquement partie de notre gouvernement, la province bénéficie d'un large degré d'autonomie. Après la fin de la guerre de la Ligue, certains généraux de la clique Zhili ont insisté pour intégrer directement la province au sein de notre gouvernement, mais cela a été largement rejeté en raison de la fragilité de notre propre régime.\n\nIl semble maintenant que garder l'autonomie de Chen était la bonne décision. Il vient d'annoncer un vaste projet de réforme de la province, promettant une grande réforme industrielle et juridique. La nouvelle a été accueillie avec enthousiasme par de nombreux chefs d'entreprise de notre territoire, car suite au retrait de la mission militaire allemande, ils ont cherché de nouveaux marchés avec lesquels commercer."
 qieflavor.16.a: "Excellent !"

 qieflavor.17.t: "Chen Tiaoyuan cherche à combler le fossé Nord-Sud Zhili"
 qieflavor.17.d: "Depuis la fin de la 4e guerre Zhili-Fengtian et l'intervention allemande en 1927, les moitiés nord et sud de la clique Zhili, dirigées respectivement par Wu Peifu et Sun Chuanfang, se sont éloignées. Aujourd'hui, Chen Tiaoyuan, gouverneur d'Anqing et membre de la clique du Sud, a entrepris un effort concerté pour combler le fossé entre les deux groupes. Les échelons supérieurs des deux groupes sont ouverts à la fusion, mais les officiers les plus jeunes peuvent nourrir des rancunes à l'égard des autres cliques, voyant dans le rapprochement des cliques une concurrence potentielle pour les promotions. Il s'agit néanmoins d'une évolution positive dans l'ensemble."

 qieflavor.18.t: "Chen Tiaoyuan propose d'organiser des exercices militaires communs"
 qieflavor.18.d: "Suite à ses efforts pour combler le fossé Nord-Sud Zhili, le gouverneur Chen Tiaoyuan d'Anqing a proposé d'organiser des exercices militaires communs entre nos troupes en dehors de la ville d'Anqing. Ses troupes ont beaucoup appris dans leurs luttes contre la clique de Nanjing, et nous avons tous les deux beaucoup à apprendre les uns des autres."
 qieflavor.18.a: "Bonne nouvelle"

 qieflavor.19.t: "Les anciennes usines allemandes réouvrent"
 qieflavor.19.d: "Après avoir annoncé nos intentions de nationaliser les usines allemandes à Beijing, de nombreux membres de notre gouvernement se sont mis à craindre une réaction du gouvernement allemand. Pourtant, le Lundi Noir absorbant la majeure partie de leur attention, nous en avons conclu que la nationalisation aurait en fait peu de conséquences. Nous avons élaboré des plans pour diviser la propriété de l'usine entre plusieurs entrepreneurs fidèles, mais nous sommes maintenant confrontés à une question : que devraient produire ces usines ? Auparavant, ils produisaient des biens de consommation en vrac à renvoyer en Allemagne et pouvaient facilement être rééquipés pour faire de même pour notre population. Alternativement, ils pourraient facilement être modifiés pour produire des fournitures de soutien militaire telles que des couvertures et du matériel de cuisine, mais leur faire produire des armes ou des munitions réelles serait d'un coût prohibitif."
 qieflavor.19.a: "Biens civils"
 qieflavor.19.b: "Provisions de soutien"

 qieflavor.20.t: "Kang Tongbei prend de l'importance"
 qieflavor.20.d: "Si Kang Youwei, le réformateur dont les travaux sont principalement basés sur le NCERA, est mort depuis 1927, sa fille Kang Tongbei a hérité du génie et du talent politique de son père. Diplômée du Barnard College de New York, elle est retournée en Chine en 1911 pour contribuer à la promotion des droits des femmes et du féminisme. Alors que le NCERA gagnait en importance dans les années tumultueuses qui ont suivi l'intervention allemande et la Restauration, les idées de Kang sur l'émancipation des femmes sont devenues de plus en plus populaires dans certains cercles intellectuels, tout en aliénant certains des membres les plus conservateurs du parti. Avec nos récents efforts pour honorer son père, certains ont suggéré de l'élever à un poste de ministre à part entière au sein de notre gouvernement, à la fois comme un symbole de notre héritage direct de l'héritage de Kang Youwei et comme un symbole de notre modernité. D'autres pensent que cela serait trop controversé et soutiennent qu'elle devrait continuer à promouvoir son travail au niveau local."

 qieflavor.21.t: "L'Empereur et le Zhili : les deux piliers de l'indépendance de la Chine"
 qieflavor.21.d: "Notre récent soutien aux mouvements intellectuels anti-concessions semble avoir été un succès remarquable, une intelligentsia naissante à Beijing produit de plus en plus de papiers et de brochures en faveur de notre gouvernement. L'un des préférés de Wu Peifu, publié dans un journal lié au mouvement  du 4 mai, farouchement anti-guerrier, s'intitule « L'empereur et le Zhili : les deux piliers de l'indépendance de la Chine ». Un tract concis qui présente Wu et sa clique comme des bastions de la lutte de la Chine contre la domination étrangère, avec l'Empereur comme puissant symbole de la modernisation de la Chine. Zhang Zuolin et son gouvernement Fengtian sont dénoncés comme des parasites étrangers, drainant les richesses minérales de la Mandchourie et les renvoyant au Japon tout en laissant la population appauvrie."
 qieflavor.21.a: "Très bien !"

 qieflavor.22.t: "Combler le fossé générationnel dans l'Armée"
 qieflavor.22.d: "Il existe depuis longtemps un fossé générationnel dans le corps des officiers chinois. Parmi les généraux les plus âgés, nés avant les bouleversements de 1911 et l'ère des seigneurs de guerre, la tradition et la méfiance à l'égard de la modernisation règnent en maître. Marqués par la violence et les troubles qui ont dominé la majeure partie de leur vie, ils sont politiquement flexibles mais conservateurs, espérant restaurer la Chine de leur jeunesse. Les jeunes officiers, quant à eux, sont nés à l'ère des seigneurs de guerre ou juste avant, et ont tendance à privilégier des positions politiques plus radicales. Notre décision de mieux intégrer les cadets de l'armée de Baoding dans les systèmes de patronage et de loyauté du Zhili a porté ses fruits, puisque de nombreux jeunes officiers ont abandonné leur soutien au YCP pour rejoindre l'Association Harmonie. Certains généraux plus âgés qui étaient sceptiques quant à la volte-face de Wu concernant le soutien allemand sont également devenus plus favorables à son régime, grâce aux conversations avec leurs nouveaux subordonnés plus actifs politiquement."
 qieflavor.22.a: "Excellentes nouvelles !"

 qieflavor.23.t: "Wu Peifu anobli"
 qieflavor.23.d: "Plus tôt ce mois-ci, l'Empereur a annoncé une nouvelle série de titres et de récompenses nobiliaires. Plutôt que le système obscur et opaque utilisé du temps de la pré-restauration Qing, ces nouveaux rangs suivent le même modèle que celui en vigueur pour l'attribution des titres occidentaux. Le rang le plus élevé d'entre eux est « Duc » (Gong), qui n'est attribué qu'à ceux qui ont « donné le plus grand service ou sacrifice pour l'empereur et la Chine ». Le premier, et jusqu'à présent le seul récipiendaire de cet honneur est le maréchal Wu Peifu - maintenant Duc de Qi.\n\nAu cours d'une somptueuse cérémonie, Wu accepta solennellement l'honneur de l'empereur, jurant de continuer à le protéger, lui et la nation, aussi longtemps « qu'il respirerait »."

Soigneusement chorégraphiés pour avoir l'air aussi « détendus » que possible, les deux hommes se sont assis ensemble pour manger et discuter de diverses questions importantes, notamment la modernisation de l'armée, la réforme de la bureaucratie et d'autres sujets. Après le déjeuner, les deux hommes ont été rejoints par le frère de l'empereur, Pujie, à l'extérieur de la ville pour une brève promenade à cheval. Des caméras ont filmé l'intégralité du spectacle, et des séquences d'actualités de l'événement ont déjà été projetées dans les cinémas des grandes villes de Chine, ainsi que distribuées aux agences internationales, qui leur montreront que nous nous sommes modernisés sans devenir une simple marionnette occidentale !"

 qieflavor.25.d: "Les grandes villes chinoises ont connu une explosion de la construction d'usines allemandes suite à notre assouplissement des lois internationales sur les investissements. Bien que cela contribue sans aucun doute à stimuler notre économie, un certain nombre d'entre eux se sont livrés à des pratiques commerciales douteuses, motivés sans doute par une législation du travail quasi inexistante dans notre pays par rapport à celle en vigueur au sein de Mitteleuropa. Plus tôt ce matin, un scandale mineur a éclaté lorsqu'il a été découvert qu'une usine allemande forçait ses employés à travailler des quarts de 20 heures pour un salaire quasi nul. Pire encore, l'usine avait passé un accord avec la police locale pour arrêter et intimider tout travailleur qui se plaignait ou manifestait officiellement, nous faisant passer pour à peine mieux que des complices des étrangers."

 qieflavor.26.d: "Alors que beaucoup ont protesté contre l'invitation des ingénieurs des chemins de fer allemands à construire notre infrastructure, après quelques mois, les gens du commun font déjà l'éloge des améliorations apportées au système ferroviaire. Des gabarits ferroviaires incroyablement complexes ont été standardisés dans toutes les provinces, et les propriétaires de gares locales corrompues qui facturaient des frais exorbitants pour les billets ont été licenciés en faveur d'un système standardisé de prix. Mis à part les avantages militaires d'un réseau ferroviaire moderne, la réforme allemande de notre système ferroviaire suscite également de grands éloges de la part des civils."

 qieflavor.27.d: "Bien que certains au ministère des Finances aient hésité devant le coût exorbitant de l'importation de centaines de radios Siemens de haute qualité d'Allemagne, nos généraux rapportent qu'elles sont extrêmement populaires auprès du corps des officiers. Lors d'une récente action visant à réprimer les bandits dans l'extrême nord de notre territoire, des groupes de nos soldats ont réussi à se séparer efficacement et à traquer les bandits en utilisant les radios pour rester en contact. Ces radios ont un potentiel immense sur le champ de bataille et semblent déjà avoir eu un effet positif sur nos troupes."
 qieflavor.27.a: "Très bien !"

 qieflavor.28.t: "La Chute de Luoyang"
 qieflavor.28.d: "Après une lutte prolongée, les anciens murs de Luoyang sont tombés aux mains des forces de [FROM.GetName]. La ville a servi de quartier général à Wu Peifu pendant de nombreuses années, et quelques heures plus tôt, ses derniers fonctionnaires, toujours fidèles au Maréchal de Jade, ont évacué la ville avec toutes sortes de documents secrets et de plans de guerre dans leurs voitures blindées. Une grande partie de la population de la ville a également fui, bien consciente de l'attaque imminente, tandis que le reste s'est retranché pour résister à la tempête.\n\nAujourd'hui, la ville est pratiquement déserte et en feu, une coquille de son ancienne apparence et un symbole de notre lutte désespérée pour la survie."
 qieflavor.28.a: "Luoyang sera vengée !"

 qieflavor.100.t: "Aisin-Gioro Xianyu"
 qieflavor.100.d: "Aisin-Gioro Xianyu, plus connue en japonais sous le nom de Yoshio Kawashima, est une noble mandchoue, cousine éloignée de Puyi, qui a acquis une grande notoriété à la cour des Qing au cours des dernières années. Malgré son jeune âge, elle s'est révélée être une habile comploteuse et une intrigante, et a travaillé avec le parti Zongshe pour faire avancer les objectifs de la noblesse mandchoue.\n\nAyant grandi dans une famille japonaise après avoir été donnée en adoption en 1915, certains autour de Puyi ont mis en doute sa loyauté envers notre nation. Pendant l'exil de l'Empereur à Tianjin, la jeune Xianyu a fait pression pour que Puyi travaille avec les Japonais plutôt qu'avec les Allemands, une position qui l'a mise en désaccord avec de nombreux proches de l'Empereur. Près de dix ans plus tard, cependant, beaucoup sont prêts à pardonner cet acte d'ignorance juvénile, et elle est rapidement devenue une force avec laquelle il faut compter."
