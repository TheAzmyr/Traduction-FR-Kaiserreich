 IRE_syndicalist_party_text:9 "§gLe Parti Syndicaliste Irlandais a été fondé pendant la guerre d'indépendance par Roddy Connolly, fils du martyr James Connolly, à son retour de la Commune de France après y avoir cherché un soutien international pour la Révolution Irlandaise. Cette itération a été rapidement réprimée par le gouvernement britannique, et le parti a ensuite été relancé par Jim Larkin Jnr. à la fin des années 1920, en tant que successeur spirituel du parti interdit de son père, la Ligue des Travailleurs Irlandais. L'ISP épouse les croyances du syndicalisme orthodoxe et du républicanisme et se considère comme poursuivant l'héritage des efforts de James Connolly en 1916 et des plusieurs petits Soviets formés pendant la guerre d'indépendance.\n\nL'un des défis majeurs dans la mise en œuvre du syndicalisme en Irlande est le manque d'une base industrielle majeure. Dans un effort pour y remédier, l'ISP a mené des discussions avec la France et la Grande-Bretagne, en cherchant un soutien international pour développer l'industrie irlandaise, afin d'être prêts au cas où les efforts révolutionnaires du parti porteraient leurs fruits. Bien qu'officiellement interdit, le parti est dirigé par Jim Larkin Snr. et est en grande partie composé d'anciens membres du Parti Travailliste et des syndicats les plus radicaux qui ont été expulsés de leurs organisations respectives en raison de leurs tendances socialistes les plus ardentes. En tant que parti résolument internationaliste, les objectifs de l'ISP peuvent être résumés par James Connolly lui-même ; "Nos revendications sont les plus modérées, nous voulons seulement la terre."§!"

Sans surprise, cela les met en porte-à-faux avec l’administration actuelle du Sinn Féin, mais leur attitude parlementaire non conflictuelle signifie que leur existence est tolérée, pour l’instant.\n\nLeurs politiques en matière de justice sociale incluent le soutien à l'abolition de la peine de mort, la suppression de toute censure politique, la protection de la liberté d'expression et les opinions proféministes. Faisant campagne pour un État-providence plus global que le Parti Travailliste traditionnel, avec lequel ils partagent la conviction de protéger les droits des travailleurs, ils promeuvent également la formation à grande échelle d'entreprises coopératives et encouragent la collectivisation agricole.

Des membres du mouvement travailliste ont pris part à l'Insurrection de Pâques au sein de l'Armée Citoyenne Irlandaise, mais alors que le Parti Travailliste se tenait fermement du côté de l'indépendance complète de l'Irlande vis-à-vis de la Grande-Bretagne, ils ont manqué les deux élections suivantes, jusqu'à ce que la « question nationale » soit réglée, gagnant le respect éternel du Sinn Féin."

Leur principal soutien vient de la base industrielle urbaine limitée de l'Irlande, mais leurs politiques progressistes ont toujours attiré l'attention d'un petit nombre de classes moyennes supérieures plus libérales.§!"

Étant le seul TD en exercice à quitter le parti à l'époque, le NPD a été créé aux côtés des partenaires improbables du Parti de la Ligue Nationale et du Parti du Centre National, tous deux de très petits restes de l'ancien Parti Parlementaire Irlandais, favorable à l'autonomie au sein du Royaume-Uni, plutôt que l’indépendance.\n\nLe soutien du nouveau parti est donc composé de certains membres de la communauté anglo-irlandaise, des « grands agriculteurs » les plus riches et d'une partie de la classe moyenne urbaine, ainsi que de la petite cohorte de partisans de Lemass du Sinn Féin. De cette manière, le parti serait plus anglophile que d’autres, tout en prônant une indépendance totale, et se classerait comme très favorable aux entreprises tout en étant conservateur sur le plan fiscal. Le parti considère la Mitteleuropa comme une excellente opportunité de bénéficier des investissements étrangers et a une vision ambivalente de la religion et de l'Église.

Après un mandat décevant suite à une victoire surprise aux élections de 1926, le parti s'est regroupé avec l'ancien Priomh-Aire de Valera prenant la direction, tout en changeant le nom du parti et en le poussant selon sa vision particulière.\n\nAn Saorstat Críostúil tire un certain nombre de ses points de vue directement de la doctrine catholique et serait favorable à un développement accru de l'agraire irlandais existant plutôt qu'à une industrialisation plus poussée. Le parti se trouverait résolument plus conservateur que le Sinn Féin sur les questions sociales, mais se situe à la gauche du Sinn Féin sur le plan économique, car il est plus disposé à considérer certaines politiques basées sur la « justice sociale » préconisées par l'Église.

 IRE_authoritarian_democrat_party_long_text:9 "Sinn Féin\n§gLe Sinn Féin, qui signifie « Nous-mêmes », est sans aucun doute le parti prédominant en Irlande depuis le milieu des années 1910. Plus ancien parti de l'État, il a été fondé par Arthur Griffith en 1905 et soutient à l'origine le principe d'une double monarchie entre la Grande-Bretagne et l'Irlande semblable à l'Autriche-Hongrie, proposant notamment que les députés irlandais s'abstiennent de se rendre à Westminster pour se réunir à Dublin, à la place. Bien qu'ils soient restés abstentionnistes, cette politique s'est radicalement transformée en républicanisme après que le parti a été crédité à tort de l'Insurrection de Pâques de 1916. Griffith est resté quelques temps à travailler avec le parti, puis a cédé la direction au leader survivant de 1916, Éamon de Valera, et le parti est finalement arrivé au pouvoir lors des élections autonomes de 1918, renonçant à toute autorité britannique et formant à la place le Dáil Éireann à Dublin.\n\nAprès une petite scission au sein du parti après la guerre d'indépendance et le traité anglo-irlandais qui a suivi, c'est la vision du parti actuel qui a façonné la jeune république. Considéré comme le parti de la classe moyenne irlandaise, il constitue les piliers de la loi, de l’ordre, du pluralisme religieux et du commerce international. Tout en étant juste à droite du centre sur les questions politiques et économiques, le Sinn Féin est considéré comme socialement libéral et quelque peu cosmopolite dans le contexte irlandais."

In spite of their strongly Catholic influence, they support religious tolerance towards Protestantism, believing that Gaelicisation could integrate loyalists into Irish society just as the Hiberno-Normans once became \"more Irish than the Irish themselves\", though they still hold disdain for the Ulster Privileges and militant loyalism."

 IRE_country_intro_content:9 "Située aux confins de l'Europe, l'héritage ancien de l'Irlande en tant que terre des « saints et des érudits » parsème ses paysages verdoyants d'innombrables ruines et monuments. Sa langue et sa société celtiques se sont développées séparément du reste du continent et malgré l'uniformité culturelle de l'île l'Irlande est restée extrêmement fragmentée politiquement mais une unification de principe par divers « Hauts Rois », au fil des siècles. Le début de la fin de cette existence s'est produit en 1169, avec le débarquement d'un petit groupe de chevaliers normands venus de Grande-Bretagne, l'avant-garde d'une force plus importante pour soutenir un roi irlandais évincé, marquant le début des relations tendues entre la Grande-Bretagne et l'Irlande.\n\nAu cours des siècles à venir, l'emprise anglaise sur l'Irlande deviendra de plus en plus ferme, avec de multiples soulèvements ratés entraînant la confiscation des terres de tous les dirigeants et leur distribution aux colons britanniques. Ces politiques ont abouti à la colonisation progressive de l'île, en particulier dans le nord-est de l'Ulster, renforcée par des lois pénales strictes qui limitaient considérablement les droits des catholiques, créant ainsi une nouvelle élite protestante anglophone sur l'île.\n\nAprès l'échec d'une rébellion républicaine soutenue par la France en 1798, le contrôle anglais s'accrut considérablement en 1801, lorsque le Royaume d'Irlande fut officiellement annexé au Royaume de Grande-Bretagne pour former le Royaume-Uni. Dublin perdit son propre parlement, même exclusivement protestant, et l'île fut gouvernée directement depuis Westminster, ce qui a entraîné un grand déclin économique.\n\nLa suppression de toute autonomie aurait des effets désastreux entre 1845 et 1850, où une crise alimentaire provoquée par le mildiou de la pomme de terre fut exacerbée jusqu'à atteindre des niveaux catastrophiques à cause de la mauvaise gestion de Westminster. Bien que la nourriture soit toujours exportée par les propriétaires britanniques à des fins lucratives, la Grande Famine, « An Gorta Mór », a entraîné la mort de plus d'un million de personnes et l'exode d'au moins la moitié de ce chiffre, sur une population de 8 millions d'habitants. Cela a déclenché une vague d’émigration qui a duré plusieurs décennies, en particulier vers le Nouveau Monde, dont l’île ne s’est pas encore remise, les Irlandais ayant régulièrement quitté ses côtes à la recherche de meilleures perspectives économiques. L’effondrement démographique a frappé plus durement les zones rurales, où l’usage de la langue irlandaise était le plus répandu, entraînant le déclin quasi final de la langue et cela en peu de temps.\n\nAu lendemain de ces événements désespérés, la représentation des catholiques irlandais à Westminster a semé l'espoir que l’Irlande pourrait à nouveau tenter d’obtenir une certaine forme de liberté limitée, même si ce n’est que par la parole et non par les armes."

 IRE_country_intro_header_1:9 "Le chemin vers la liberté"
 IRE_country_intro_content_1:9 "En tant que partie officielle du Royaume-Uni, la représentation minimale de l'Irlande à Westminster signifiait qu'elle avait un pouvoir limité sur ses propres affaires. Après de nombreuses rébellions ratées au cours des siècles précédents, il est devenu clair que le moyen le plus réaliste pour l'île d'obtenir une certaine liberté était la voie politique.\nDans les années qui ont suivi la famine, les députés irlandais de Westminster ont proposé un système appelé « Home Rule », dans lequel l'Irlande resterait partie du Royaume-Uni, mais gouvernée par son propre parlement régional à Dublin.\n\nCependant, tous les habitants de l’île n’étaient pas d’accord avec cette proposition. Ceux qui prônaient plus d’autonomie étaient appelés nationalistes, tandis que ceux qui voulaient préserver l’union entre l’Irlande et la Grande-Bretagne étaient appelés unionistes ou loyalistes. Les nationalistes eux-mêmes étaient divisés entre les « Home Rulers » qui préféraient les méthodes constitutionnelles ou parlementaires, et un groupe plus restreint de séparatistes républicains plus radicaux connus sous le nom de « Fenians », pour qui le Home Rule était un compromis inacceptable, même comme à titre transitoire.\n\nÀ quelques exceptions majeures près, les nationalistes étaient en grande partie catholiques, tandis que le syndicalisme était associé aux protestants, en partie à cause des liens ancestraux entretenus par de nombreux protestants dont les familles étaient originaires de Grande-Bretagne. Les unionistes, en particulier en Ulster, craignaient que le Home Rule ne favorise le sud du pays, à prédominance agricole, au détriment de l'industrie de Belfast. Ils se méfiaient également de l'influence que l'Église Catholique aurait, considérant que dans ce cadre « Home Rule signifierait Rome Rule ».\n\nAprès des décennies de débats et de retards de la part de l’establishment conservateur de Westminster, le Home Rule était sur le point d’être promulgué, au début du XXe siècle. Aussitôt, les syndicalistes d'Ulster ont formé l'Ulster Volunteer Force, une milice armée jurant de prendre les armes contre le gouvernement britannique si le Home Rule était promulgué. Face à eux, les nationalistes ont formé les Irish Volunteers.\n\nL'Irlande était au bord d'une véritable guerre civile qui ne fut stoppée que par un léger retard dans l'introduction du Home Rule, connu sous le nom de Weltkrieg..."

 IRE_country_intro_header_2:9 "Une difficulté pour l'Angleterre est une opportunité pour l'Irlande"
 IRE_country_intro_content_2:9 "Le déclenchement de la guerre en Europe a eu des conséquences majeures sur l'Irlande. La mise en œuvre du Home Rule a été suspendue pendant toute la durée du conflit, ce qui a permis d’éviter, au moins temporairement, toute guerre civile potentielle. La Weltkrieg a également provoqué une scission au sein des Volontaires irlandais, la plupart suivant les convictions des nationalistes irlandais de Westminster, qui préconisaient que les Volontaires se joignent à l'effort de guerre britannique, la participation à la Weltkrieg cimentant la probabilité de l'Irlande d'obtenir l'autonomie.\n\nLe reste des Volontaires irlandais, sous la direction d'Eoin MacNeill, refusa de participer à la guerre britannique. Ce groupe s'est infiltré avec des membres de la Fraternité républicaine irlandaise, une société secrète ayant juré de créer une République irlandaise indépendante. Estimant que « les difficultés de l'Angleterre étaient une opportunité pour l'Irlande », l'IRB et les volontaires restants ont considéré que la seule option restante alors que la Grande-Bretagne était distraite ailleurs, était une rébellion.\n\nLes instiguateurs du soulèvement ont trouvé des alliés inattendus en l’icône socialiste James Connolly et sa milice, l’Irish Citizen Army. Plus important encore, l’Empire Allemand a également accepté d’envoyer une importante cargaison d’armes pour contribuer à cet effort. Des soulèvements simultanés et généralisés étaient prévus, mais le désastre survint lorsque la livraison d'armes allemandes fut interceptée par les Britanniques. À cause de l’indécision et d’une mauvaise communication, le soulèvement fut presque entièrement annulé, au dernier moment, sauf à Dublin.\n\nLe lundi de Pâques 1916 marquera le début de ce qui deviendra le « Easter Rising », un événement qui modifiera à jamais le cours de l'histoire irlandaise. Les rebelles se sont concentrés dans un certain nombre d'endroits autour de Dublin, déclarant une République et ont formé un gouvernement provisoire. En infériorité numérique et sous-équipés, ils n’avaient que peu de chances lorsque toute la force de la Couronne fut lancée contre eux.\n\nAprès cinq jours de combats, au cours desquels la réaction britannique brutale a conduit à la dévastation d'une grande partie du centre de Dublin, les rebelles se sont rendus. Ridiculisés par le public, peu de gens éprouvaient de la sympathie pour eux, et il semblait que ce soulèvement allait simplement être un nouvel échec sanglant. Cependant, tout cela a changé avec la réponse britannique, la quasi-totalité des dirigeants survivants ayant été exécutés sans procès. La nouvelle de ces exécutions a électrisé le public irlandais, transformant les volontaires ridiculisés en martyrs. Par leur sacrifice, les dirigeants de 1916 avaient placé le mouvement républicain au premier plan de la politique irlandaise."

 IRE_country_intro_header_3:0 "La Guerre d'Indépendance"
 IRE_country_intro_content_3:9 "In the aftermath of 1916, Irish politics saw a rapid realignment and radicalisation, with popular support for constitutional nationalism replaced overnight with republicanism. Sinn Féin was the main beneficiary, a minor nationalist party now taken over by republicans.\n\nIrish anger with Westminster grew in 1918, with the introduction of conscription due to intensified German pressure on the continent. With the exception of Ulster, this measure was opposed by the majority of the Irish public, leading to strikes, draft-dodging, and protests from all parts of society.\n\nAs an attempted \"concession\" to the Irish, the British government brought in Home Rule during the war, save for the 6 north-eastern counties of Ulster. This plan backfired massively for the British, as the old Irish parliamentarians from Westminster were trounced in the Home Rule election, and Sinn Féin captured virtually all available seats.\n\nWith their popular mandate demonstrated, Sinn Féin did not take their seats in Westminster, and instead took the momentous step of declaring a new Irish Parliament, \"Dáil Éireann\", in Dublin, the continuation of the Irish Republic from 1916.\n\nOn the same day, a minor skirmish began the Irish War of Independence, fought between British forces and the Irish Republican Army (IRA), the military wing of Sinn Féin. Largely fought through guerrilla warfare, the war was marked by ambushes, flying columns in the countryside, imported German arms, and high levels of public support for the rebels. From the British perspective, fighting an unseen enemy, hidden in plain sight, made a significant difference from the battlefields of the Weltkrieg, and frustrated soldiers often took out their anger on the local civilian population.\n\nNews of reprisals carried out by British forces on civilians lead to considerable backlash for the British government, from both the international community, and the British public, already war-weary from the Weltkrieg. Beleaguered with the unsustainable war effort and public opinion, the British government sought a peace with Sinn Féin.\n\nIn late 1921, the Anglo-Irish Treaty would be signed, creating an Irish Republic in the 26 counties which had previously come under Home Rule. Despite the many concessions involved, few could argue that Sinn Féin had come further than it could have dreamed of just a decade ago."

A revolutionary, a radical and an arch-subversive, Peadar O'Donnell is the firmest and loudest voice in Irish society when it comes to calls for socialism. His credentials are as strong as any Irish republican, having fought in the War of Independence, and even at that time he advocated for a total revolution that embraced socialism as much as it did anti-imperialism.\n\nAfter the War of Independence, he rejected the treaty on the grounds of partition and External Association, and campaigned vigorously for socialism in Ireland as part of Anti-Treaty Sinn Féin. He became editor of An Saorstát, the party's newspaper which he turned into a popular platform for his left-wing views. Expelled from the party after the revolutions in France, Italy and Britain and having watched as Ireland swapped the chains of British capitalism for German ones, O'Donnell became increasingly more militant in tone, and established his own party Saor Éire, to fulfil his vision of a true Irish revolution. With fears about his goals mounting, the government moved against him and shut down An Saorstát.\n\nO'Donnell's trials have only made him more determined to achieve his goals by any means necessary, even if it meant swallowing his distrust to work with the Union of Britain and their agents. Finally in charge of Ireland, O'Donnell plans to take swift and decisive action to utterly revolutionise society, just as he's always dreamed of doing."

Also like Connolly, he co-founded the Labour Party in 1912, alongside the more moderate William O'Brien.\n\nLarkin has been an advocate for socialism and trade unionism since the 1890s, but first courted public notoriety in the 1910s as general secretary of the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union, a time period which saw Larkin lead the unions through the infamous \"Dublin Lockout\" of 1913. Known for his imposing physical presence, as well as his considerable oratorical skills, Larkin's uncompromising and larger-than-life persona has caused many of his followers to idolise him, but also has led to some bitter disputes among former comrades. A Christian socialist, Larkin sees no contradiction between his Catholic faith and his socialist ideals.\n\nAfter the Lockout, Larkin spent the best part of the decade in the United States, becoming involved in the Socialist Party of America, further radicalising, and openly espousing support for the Commune of France. He returned to Ireland, and became estranged from the mainstream of the Labour Party. Narrowly evading imprisonment after the clampdown on socialism that followed the British Revolution, he took up an offer from the French, along with his son, to further develop his views of syndicalism in the Sorbonne.\n\nHaving finally returned from France, and now the leader of the Irish Syndicalist Party, Larkin has"

The erstwhile mathematics teacher was one of the few surviving commanders of the Easter Rising, as due to his birth in New York to a Spanish father and Irish mother, his American citizenship stayed the executioner's hand, at a time when the UK did not want to aggravate a potential ally during the Weltkrieg.\n\nOn the eve of the War of Independence he was the leader of Sinn Féin, and was ready to lead them and Ireland in its struggle for freedom. Alas for de Valera, he was captured and imprisoned by the British in May of 1918, and despite many attempts to free him, he remained in their hands for some years. During that time period, the man who came to overshadow him would dominate the Irish political scene: Michael Collins.\n\nWhen de Valera finally was released after the war, he returned to Ireland to find the power dynamics had changed greatly, and his influence was now much more diminished in light of having not had much of a role in the war, while Collins' stock had greatly increased.

In many ways a \"founding father\" of the Irish state, and certainly a national hero, Michael Collins' firm hand has led the fledgling state since 1930, and so far to great success.\n\nBorn in County Cork to a republican family, Collins originally trained as an accountant, working in London and New York before returning to Ireland and taking part in the Easter Rising. Seen as the head military commander during the War of Independence, he acted as the IRA's Director of Intelligence, and was also lauded for his actions as Minister for Finance during the war. Afterwards, Collins quickly stepped into the role of Ireland's top political figure. As leader of the nation, he moulded the new Republic along American lines, making the office of President unquestionably the most powerful position in the land.\n\nTo date, possibly his finest hour (and certainly his most controversial) came in 1926 during the British Revolution. Amongst the chaos and upheaval, Collins, representing President MacNeill, managed to negotiate an unthinkable deal with the Ulster loyalists: the peaceful entry of Northern Ireland into the Republic, in return for protection against any syndicalist threat. Rather than risk being wiped out by revolutionaries, the Ulstermen chose the devil they knew.\n\nSince Sinn Féin's re-election in 1930 after losing the previous election on account of the Great Depression, Collins is now leader of Ireland and of Sinn Féin"

 IRE_michael_collins_advisor_body:9 "§gSeeing Ireland engulfed in war, with its sovereignty once again threatened, Michael Collins has returned to active duty in service to the nation.\nAs a military leader, Collins personally gained considerable notoriety from British forces during the War of Independence, and was seen by them as the mastermind behind the Irish war effort. The reality was far more nuanced, but like in all myths there was an element of truth.\nBeing a veteran of 1916, Collins realised the folly in any symbolic, publicly visible victories or attempted large-scale encounters, like what had unsuccessfully attempted in Easter week, especially at the General Post Office where he had been assigned. What was needed against a much better-armed and better-supplied enemy was the ability to strike suddenly, with great effect, and withdraw from the engagement before any response could be mustered. These were the principles that, aided by the mass public support, Collins adopted and found success with during the War of Independence across Ireland.\nCollins' true talent as a commander comes in his organisational skills on a larger scale, and his maintenance of expansive intelligence networks. He also realised the importance of knowing how to pick his men well, as the IRA divisions operated with a significant degree of autonomy. Both of these came to play on a fateful Sunday in November 1920, when Collins arranged the simultaneous assassinations of most of Britain's highest-ranking intelligence officers in Dublin, leading to grave civilian retributions by crown forces.\nPersonally, Collins did his best to feed into the aura of mystique and elusiveness that was attached to his persona during the War of Independence, enjoying his time as a \"man on the run\". This self-confidence followed him out of war-time, leading some of his rivals to resent this popularity, which they felt was at least partially undeserved.\nAfter unexpectedly being ousted from high office and without even a ministerial position, Collins now has his role to play in fighting to save Ireland once again, and of course do his best to help repair his tarnished reputation in the eyes of the people.§!"

 IRE_eoin_oduffy_leader_body:9 "A war hero turned political demagogue, General Eoin O'Duffy is one of Ireland's most notorious political figures. Born as Owen Duffy, to a family of impoverished smallholders in County Monaghan, he became interested at a young age in the Gaelic Revival and was a leading sportsman within the province of Ulster. Joining the Irish Volunteers in 1917, his skills quickly impressed his superiors, most notably Michael Collins, who described him as \"the best man in Ulster\".\n\nDuring the war, O'Duffy's brigade became notable for their daring attacks, most famously the first capture of an RIC barracks in the town of Ballytrain, but also for sectarian actions against Protestants. Appointed chief liaison officer to Belfast during the Truce, O'Duffy was enraged by attacks on Catholics and the collusion he saw between loyalists and the RUC, marking the beginning of his staunch opposition to loyalist influence. Appointed to the role of Garda Commissioner following the war, O'Duffy strove to create a disciplined and organised police force which would serve as a model of his ideals. The unification of Ireland would upset this order as among the Ulster Privileges was the inclusion of members of the RUC into the Gardaí.\n\nO'Duffy, who had called for the government to invade the six counties during the British Revolution, despised the Ulster Privileges and had no trust for these new members. Disenchanted with his former friend Michael Collins and seeing the UDP block any attempts by Brugha to undo the Privileges, O'Duffy began to organise a far-right faction within Sinn Féin. Dismissed by Collins after his re-election for anti-Protestant discrimination, O'Duffy left the party with his followers and, aligning with hardline anti-Treatyites, formed Aontas Náisiúnta with the objective of overthrowing the democracy that had \"sold out\" Ireland to the loyalists and the Germans, and establishing a Portuguese-inspired Catholic dictatorship."

O'Kelly opposed the Anglo-Irish Treaty and joined Anti-Treaty Sinn Féin, becoming the leader of the party's right-wing along with Brian O'Higgins, a fellow Sinn Féin founder.\n\nFollowing the expulsion of ATSF's left-wing, he and O'Higgins became the party's leading influences, looking to Integralism as an inspiration for Ireland to follow, and shifting the party ideologically further right. After Austin Stack's death in 1929, O'Kelly became the new party leader and in 1931 he led ATSF into a merger with Eoin O'Duffy and his supporters, to form Aontas Náisiúnta, with O'Kelly becoming the new party's Vice-President."

Kathleen Clarke (née Daly) has lived a life steeped in Irish republicanism.\nShe was born in County Limerick to a strongly republican family, with her uncle John Daly a leading figure in the Irish Republican Brotherhood. It was through him that she would meet her future husband Tom, recently released from serving fifteen years in an English prison. Kathleen at the time was the manager of a flourishing dressmaking business in Limerick City, when she married Tom, twenty-one years her senior.\n\nThe couple moved to New York for some time, working and gathering support for the Fenians among recently emigrated Irish-Americans, before returning to Ireland and settling in Dublin. There they opened a suite of tobacconists' shops, with Kathleen running the business with her husband, while also joining the Gaelic League and engaging in republican activities herself. Most notably, in 1914 she was a founder member of Cumann na mBan, the women's paramilitary association that was essential in the struggle for independence during the revolutionary period. Tom would later be forever remembered as the primary instigator of the Easter Rising, and the first signatory in the Proclamation of the Republic. For Kathleen however, the Rising meant the loss of her husband, brother, uncle and unborn child. She spent its immediate aftermath organising relief efforts for all those who had family members killed or imprisoned during the rebellion.\n\nDespite the great personal losses Clarke endured, she continued to engage in the republican movement, joining Sinn Féin in 1917 and serving in its executive. During the War of Independence, she was elected as a TD and acted as a District Judge in the Republican Courts set up by the Dáil. Since then, she has been elected as a TD, Senator and Lord Mayor of Dublin. Clarke has championed the rights of women in particular to be enshrined in law, both in the original 1922 Constitution, but also in any subsequent legislation. In gaining support for this, she cites the Proclamation of 1916, with its vision of cherishing all children of the nation equally.\n\nThere is no person in Ireland that can be considered more of a living symbol of the sacrifice made by the martyrs of 1916. It is fitting that she now holds the role of President, where above the banality of wielding executive power, Clarke will act as first citizen of the Republic, and among other duties, have the responsibility of honouring the memory of all of those men and women who gave their lives for the cause of Irish freedom."

The linguist and academic Douglas Hyde was born to a Church of Ireland rector in County Roscommon. At an early age, he developed a fascination with the form of Irish spoken in the area, and despite his Ascendency background, gained a keen motivation for the usage and preservation of the language as a whole, particularly following the calamitous drop its prevalence that occurred with the Great Famine.\n\nHyde originally wrote poems and essays in the Irish language under the name \"An Craoibhín Aoibhinn\", or \"The Pleasant Little Branch\", alongside his career in academia. This eventually led him in 1893 to found the Gaelic League, or Conradh na Gaeilge, a society dedicated to the promotion of Irish language and culture, with its initial manifesto, written by Hyde, entitled \"The necessity for de-anglicising the Irish nation\".\n\nThe Gaelic League became the wellspring of a generation of Irish nationalists and republicans, despite being founded with a non-partisan ethos. While a nationalist himself, Hyde wished for the League to be accessible to those of any allegiance, later resigning in favour of Eoin MacNeill when the movement became increasingly politicised. Since then, he has served as the inaugural Professor of Modern Irish in University College Dublin, and as a Senator.\n\nEven considering his numerous credentials, the selection of a non-Catholic to the office of President is a message to the world that the Irish identity is based on the nation's culture and heritage, and not any sole religious affiliation. The new President is comfortable with his largely apolitical new role, where he acts mostly in a ceremonial capacity as a national representative and cultural ambassador. Hyde brings a dignified and understated presence to the position, and continues to hold the almost universal respect of the people."

Despite swearing retirement from the humdrum of parliamentary politics, Cathal Brugha has once again become President of Ireland. Following the new Constitution however, this time the office he takes is much more ceremonial than executive, well suited to his ongoing military commitments.\n\nBrugha was involved in the struggle for independence from an early stage, and still walks with a limp from the many injuries sustained while being a commander during the Easter Rising. He played a critical role in the War of Independence as Minister of Defense, and was an early advocate for Ireland gaining international recognition. The Anglo-Irish Treaty tested his limits with compromise, but he remained with Sinn Féin for another short while, until it became clear that Collins' influence within the party was only growing further.\n\nThis is the third time Brugha has been named President, as he was temporarily elected Acting President of the First Dáil, of the few that were present and not imprisoned. The next time was in the 1926 election that came shortly after the British Revolution, and was largely seen as an unsuccessful term, with some limited reforms that have mostly been forgotten, leading to his leaving of politics shortly after.\n\nBrugha is synonymous with his hardline republican ideals, plotting several times to have the entire British cabinet assassinated during and before the War of Independence, and offering to lead the expedition himself. He is the epitome of the conservative revolutionary, known for his devout Catholic faith and noted by his peers to abstain entirely from smoking, drinking or cursing. Brugha is an undeniably solemn, sombre figure as President, but still manages to garner much popular support due to his association with the revolutionary period, and his continuing duty in the defence of the Republic."

He enlisted in the Irish Volunteers at an early stage also, being leader of the Volunteers tasked with retrieving the crucial smuggled gun shipment delivered in the Howth Gun Running, leading up to the Easter Rising.\nAs an officer during the Rising itself, he suffered up to 25 gunshot wounds in defending his position. Expected to succumb to his injuries, Brugha escaped imprisonment by still being in hospital when his arrest warrant had expired.\nBrugha was elected acting President of the Irish Republic on the first convening of Dáil Éireann, and later served as Minister for Defense during the War of Independence. It was at this point that his initial rivalry began with Michael Collins, regardless of their common goals. This rivalry is partly the cause of Brugha's split from Sinn Féin, and later of his exit from politics entirely.\nKnown for his austere manner, devout Catholicism and sheer determination, Brugha is as uncompromising as he is zealous. His loyalty lies entirely with the idea of the Republic, though he has separated himself from his previous ties to what has become An Saorstát Críostúil, and has always seen himself much more of a soldier than politician. Since retiring from politics, Brugha remains as tenacious as ever, and despite his previous injuries, plays an active and crucial role in the organisation of the Army.§!"

Robert Erskine Childers has travelled a long and varied path to arrive in the office of President.\n\nBorn in London to an English father and Anglo-Irish mother, he was raised by mother's family in County Wicklow after his parents' untimely death. He received his education in Britain, and with his family prominent in British political circles, it was no surprise when he became a civil servant in the House of Commons, at the heart of the establishment. Partly due to the British conservative values that he grew up with, Childers volunteered during the Boer War. This became his first sense of disillusionment with the imperialist project, and led him to become passionate about the cause of Home Rule for Ireland. His wartime experiences also began his penchant for writing, completing two books on military theory, as well as an influential espionage novel.\n\nChilders was a keen yachtsman, and frustrated with Home Rule's endless delays, he furthered his unruly streak by sailing to Germany on the eve of the Weltkrieg and smuggling hundreds of rifles to the Irish Volunteers on his yacht the \"Asgard\". He was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross by the British government for his efforts as an intelligence and reconnaissance officer during the Weltkrieg, but was enraged by the violent suppression of the Easter Rising, and the attempted introduction of conscription in Ireland.\n\nEventually, departing entirely from moderate nationalism, Childers permanently moved back to Ireland and joined Sinn Féin, utilising his literary abilities as Director of Publicity for the first Dáil. His arrival was met with suspicion, as many considered him as at best a renegade and traitor to Britain, or at worst as a British spy. His doubters were muted by the forthright republican views that he displayed as part of the delegation for the successful Treaty negotiations.\n\nChilders has since then lived his life out of the spotlight, spending his time writing, sailing with his wife Molly, and serving as occasional government advisor on maritime matters. As President, he leaves the day-to-day running of the government to the Taoiseach, while frequently publishing articles and essays on Irish international relations, in addition to his formal appearances. Childers represents an Irish Republic that is comfortable with its past, and recognises the contributions of the Anglo-Irish to Irish nationalism and republicanism — from Tone, to Emmet, to Parnell, and to Casement."

As time went on, his nationalist sympathies grew, and he became synonymous with his actions of supporting the Irish Volunteers by smuggling a large shipment of guns from Germany. Shortly after this, he nonetheless joined the British war effort and took a temporary commission in the Royal Navy, utilising his extensive navigational experience in the North Sea and later Gallipoli, for which he received the Distinguished Service Cross. His political about-face concluded after the war, as in his disgust at the British reaction to the Easter Rising and the Conscription Crisis, he became part of the Sinn Féin political machine.\nDespite holding a prominent role in the negotiations preceding the Anglo-Irish Treaty, Childers has since then spent his time outside of political matters, where he has been attempting to most effectively apply his own experience in nautical navigation and manoeuvres in the emerging state of Irish naval affairs.§!"

Becoming interested in the Irish national struggle under the encouragement of a dedicated schoolteacher, and a chance encounter with Roger Casement, he joined Sinn Féin and the Gaelic League following the events of the Easter Rising. Participating in the War of Independence, Murray was arrested in 1920 while on his way to join an IRA flying column. Released after the signing of the Treaty, he rejoined the Ulster IRA to fight against the northern state.\n\nHunted by the brutal B-Specials, Seán Murray escaped to Great Britain in 1924 and would be there to witness the Revolution unfold, becoming a convert to syndicalism. Meeting the son of famous Irish socialist agitator Jim Larkin in Britain, Murray and Larkin Jnr. would publish the book \"The Road to Wigan Pier: An Investigation into the Rebuilding of Britain and the Implementation of Syndicalism in Ireland\". Murray's role in the writing of the book brought him to prominence in the eyes of the British, and several years later he would return to Ireland as a part of the Union's Operation Whale, serving as a liaison between Saor Éire and British intelligence, and as head of Saor Éire's Ulster branch.\n\nSeen as more amenable to their \"advice\" than his close friend and colleague, Peadar O'Donnell, Murray was put in place by British forces as Chairman of the newly \"liberated\" Irish Socialist Republic.

He wishes to further advance the army, away from what he sees as many disparate remnants of structures from the War of Independence, to a more modern composition.\nBeing from a political dynasty, many were surprised that MacNeill didn't enter politics himself, but if you were to ask him, he would say he would prefer to leave it to others.

With aid from fellow syndicalists in Britain and France, and making use of the increasing British influence in the country, Tweedy, as a member of the smallest party in the diverse coalition government, was able to slowly develop a network of contacts to aid in the overall syndicalist plan of a relatively bloodless takeover of Ireland. The now-apparent entryism of Tweedy into the party, a man who had generally just been seen as a traditional moderate trade unionist, is ironic, considering that entryism was quite successfully avoided by William O'Brien's Labour Party, from whom the Progressive Labour Party split.\nUsing the PLP's naïveté, inexperience and optimism to his advantage, Tweedy worked within the party from the onset, and has now become the real power behind the government, with O'Brien staying on as President as a mere formality, and former party leader Sheehy-Skeffington sidelined and irrelevant.§!"

His paternal uncle took part in the 1867 Rising, while his mother had been joint secretary of a local Ladies' branch of the Land League, seeking to break up the large estates of the Anglo-Irish gentry.\nLike many young men his age, Lynch joined the Irish Volunteers in 1913, seeking to secure Home Rule, while completing his apprenticeship in the hardware trade, and being a member of the Gaelic League. Also typical of most, he elected to not join the more militant group of the Volunteers, and as such did not take part of the Easter Rising, while also not enlisting in the British Army. This more moderate approach ended after the Rising, particularly when he witnessed the British Army shooting and capturing the prominent Kent family of Bawnard. After leading the four brothers and their octogenarian mother in handcuffs over the bridge of Fermoy, one brother would die of the wounds sustained in the capture, while another would be executed the following week. It was at this point that Lynch decided to dedicate his life to the cause of Irish freedom.\nHe quickly made a name for himself as the leader of the North Cork No. 2 Brigade of the IRA during the War of Independence, leading multiple successful skirmishes, raids and ambushes. Lynch narrowly escaped capture and death numerous times, with his notoriety to the extent that two other men named Lynch were mistakenly killed by British forces, seeking him out.\nLynch's experiences in the War of Independence have stayed with him, as he enjoys an influential position in the Army. He maintains a low tolerance for politicians, and during the War of Independence was noted to say \"The Army has to hew the way to freedom for politics to follow.\" Known for his attention to detail, he was even at an early stage recognised to have an affinity to military life. Such was his devotion to the cause, that during the War he was frequently compared to a priest. Though that war has ended, for Lynch the Army remains his vocation.§!"

He was educated at Winchester, and constantly disciplined for renegade activities, such as urinating openly while fielding on the cricket pitch. His father's status as war hero and Field Marshal gained him admittance to the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, and he completed his training in time to take part in the Second Boer War.\nIt was in South Africa that White first started coming to terms with his disagreements with the worldview of the British aristocracy, having threatened to shoot a superior officer when they ordered the summary execution of a young unarmed Boer prisoner. Nevertheless, he ended the war a decorated officer, with a Distinguished Service Order.\nServing a few more years as the peacetime soldier, he realised it was not the life for him, and went onto teach English in Bohemia, live in a Tolstoyan commune in England, and work as a lumberjack in Canada. Upon returning to Ireland, he saw the Home Rule debate in full swing, and anticipated supporting the unionist cause. This changed when he encountered the Ulster loyalism of the day, with what he considered their \"bigotry and stagnation\" causing him to veer towards Home Rule. After a chance meeting with Roger Casement, and eventually James Connolly, White went from Home Ruler, to republican, to devout advocate for socialism.\nWhite went on to co-found the Irish Citizen Army, and played an instrumental role in their training and organisation, using his extensive experience from the heart of the British military establishment. Ultimately, when the ICA began negotiating with the Irish Volunteers, he disagreed over the level of cooperation and integration the two groups would undergo, and left the militia. His beliefs never left him however, and he later became a founder member of both the Irish Worker's League and the Irish Syndicalist Party. Since the treaty, he has coordinated the renewed ICA from the underground, leading all that volunteer in the cause of a true socialist republic.\nWhite considers himself a Christian socialist, as he abhors the overt influence of clericalism, or any singular religion in Ireland, preferring instead to aim for Tone's dream of uniting Catholic, Protestant and Dissenter.§!"

This time with the British Army did anything but ingratiate him to the political status-quo however, as he resigned in 1907, then with a commitment to a particularly Catholic-focused Irish nationalism.\nUpon returning to Ireland and working as a journalist, he also was an early member of Sinn Féin, as well as prominent local member of the Gaelic League. As could be expected, he joined the Irish Volunteers on their foundation in 1913, with his previous military experience welcome. He served as a Commandant during the Easter Rising at the GPO under James Connolly, at which time he was wounded and captured.\nBrennan-Whitmore was heavily involved in the efforts that took place in Frongoch Prison in Wales, whereby the imprisoned veterans of the Rising took to developing the military tactics that would later be implemented in the War of Independence. During the war itself, he was involved in the North Wexford IRA, but mainly spent his time assisting Collins' creation of intelligence networks.\nSince independence, Brennan-Whitmore has become disillusioned with the more liberal Ireland that come into being. He left the army and returned to journalism, mainly writing of the imminent danger that syndicalism presents to Ireland. Though a devoted Catholic, he has called upon all Christians to do their duty to resist the common enemy of syndicalism, just as they did against British influence in Ireland in past times.\nSuch was the level of extremism advocated in his columns, Brennan-Whitmore was previously investigated by the same intelligence networks that he helped create. But now, with the nation under powerful new leadership, he has volunteered himself as someone prepared to do everything he can for the salvation of Ireland, and of Europe in general.§!"

Kerry, Ireland§!\n§YAlso known as:§! §g$IRE_tom_barry_alt$§!\n§YMilitary Career:§! §gIf there were one commander in Ireland who is preceded by their reputation, it would be Thomas Bernadine Barry. Raised in County Cork, he was the second of eleven children born to a Royal Irish Constabulary officer, and unlike most of his revolutionary peers, did not join the Gaelic League, or come from a republican or strong nationalist background.\nAt 17 years old, he did what many young men were doing in Europe during the Weltkrieg, which was enlist. This was not to fight for Ireland, or even Britain; he joined the Royal Field Artillery to see what war was like, get a gun, and to travel.\nThis saw him to Mesopotamia and Egypt, to promotion and commendation. Despite being mentioned in despatches, when word reached about the Easter Rising, Barry began to question his position in the British Army, and turned down an offer of a commission in the Munster Fusiliers, opting to pursue employment elsewhere.\nBarry remained uninvolved early in the War of Independence, until a fellow ex-serviceman was bayoneted to death in Cork city by British soldiers, who did so while calling him and his companion \"Irish pigs\". After serving in the guard of honour at the funeral, Barry could see little appeal with the status quo, and joined the IRA, to fight for an independent Irish republic.\nFrom the onset, he was highly valued for his military background and ability to train and inspire new volunteers, while adapting his previous experiences successfully to a wholly new form of warfare. This could be seen in the legendary Kilmichael Ambush, as well as the Battle of Crossbarry, where he lead 104 volunteers of the West Cork Brigade to escape an encirclement of British forces thirteen times their number, to minimal casualties.\nBarry personally came to be known as a ruthless and feared adversary to enemy forces, to the degree that his temporary imprisonment was an initial demand by the British in securing the war's ceasefire — a request that Collins naturally denied.\nThe accolades that he and his men received for their bravery, discipline and efficiency have been many. Not wanting to rest on his laurels however, Barry is keen to remain \"in the field\", and to go beyond his wartime reputation for ambushes and flying columns. He continues to develop his methods, should the need to maintain Ireland's independence arise again, \"in the next war\".§!"

After finishing school, he moved to County Monaghan to work as a clerk for the Great Northern Railway Company, and it was here that he would later make a name for himself during the War of Independence. His initial time in Monaghan was marked by his joining of the GAA and the Irish Volunteers — both of which closely coinciding with his introduction to none other than Eoin O'Duffy.\nHogan developed a reputation as a ruthless and confident leader in the Monaghan IRA, carrying out numerous ambushes and assaults, while acting as O'Duffy's right-hand-man. His wartime experiences involved personal loss, as his brother Michael was the captain of Tipperary team that played in Croke Park during the fateful events of Bloody Sunday, and indeed was the only player shot dead by British forces, with the rest of the victims being spectators. Hogan did not take this well, and his grief only lead him more fully engage in the revolutionary activities in Ulster, in particular targeting wealthy loyalists with kidnappings and the burning down of several of the \"big houses\". At the end of the war, he was given the honour of being the first to raise the Tricolour over Dublin Castle, as part of the handover ceremony where British forces formally relinquished their control of much of the apparatus of state.\nHis friendship with O'Duffy was sidelined when the latter lost favour with the government, with Hogan not wishing his own personal relationship with his former superior to be a risk to his own current position in the army — though there is no doubt that he harbours some sympathy for O'Duffy's cause, likely in part due to his devout religious beliefs. Hogan's past connections and prickly character makes him an unpopular figure with several politicians, but he maintains the respect of the soldiers, who remain in full confidence of his abilities as a commander and leader.§!"

The young Seán took an interest in national matters at an early stage, adopting the Irish language form of his name at 11 years of age. He finished his primary education and began work at the family forge, where he was apprenticed to his father. As the eldest son, Mac Eoin had responsibility thrust upon him in 1913, as he then had to take over full maintenance of the forge and his family's wellbeing, after his father passed away unexpectedly. However, this did not stop him from joining the Irish Volunteers and Irish Republican Brotherhood the following year.\nMac Eoin was notable during the War of Independence for leading the only effective flying column in the midlands, as he served the Commandant of the first battalion of the Longford brigade. The first of two major incidents that he was involved in during the conflict was the Battle of Ballinalee, where Mac Eoin was based, where he held his village from British forces despite overwhelming numbers. The other was the Clonfin Ambush, where he performed a well-executed attack on several lorries of British troops, and was recognised for his chivalrous actions in treating the wounded enemies afterwards, at the expense of the opportunity to capture more much-needed weaponry and equipment. These two events became legendary locally, earning him the soubriquet \"The Blacksmith of Ballinalee\".\nHis time in the war was ended with his capture, during which he was shot in the chest. He recovered from his injuries and was sentenced to death for his involvement in the war — but was released before the sentence was carried out, as part of the treaty negotiations. Testimony from British forces over his conduct towards them also helped to delay his sentencing.\nWhile imprisoned, Mac Eoin was elected TD for Longford-Westmeath, but did not contest the seat again after serving two terms in the Dáil, opting instead to focus on the military, after Ireland's independence seemed threatened in the immediate aftermath of the British Revolution. \"The Blacksmith of Ballinalee\", as he is still known, is also noted for his strong religious views, and close association with both Richard Mulcahy and Michael Collins, though his loyalty lies first and foremost to the army itself.§!"

Following this, he returned to Ireland in 1915 and joined the Irish Volunteers as Chief of Inspection, delivering lectures on military tactics as well as on famous Irish battles. Taking no part in the Rising itself, he spent the preceding days in Cork, having being sent there as part of the infamous countermand issued by Eoin MacNeill, which almost stopped the Rising taking place entirely.\nDespite O'Connell's non-involvement, he was nonetheless reprimanded by British forces and imprisoned.

He was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant in the Royal Irish Rifles, and was posted to the Western Front, serving in the battles of Messines, Somme and Passchendaele, during which time he was awarded the Military Cross, before being promoted late in the war.\nBritain may have lost the Weltkrieg, but Steele looked to have a bright future ahead of him in the British Army. He was sorely disappointed at the result of the Irish War of Independence, as he considered his Irish identity to be closely entwined with his British one, and was reluctant to see the parting of many of his old comrades in the Royal Irish Rifles.\nThe British Revolution, unsurprisingly, had a significant effect on his worldview. Deeply disillusioned by the exiled government in Canada's decision to seemingly abandon Northern Ireland at a time when its invasion by the newly established Union of Britain seemed imminent, he was among the military representatives present at the tense negotiations with the southern government, which eventually led to Irish reunification.\nWhile he certainly has not voiced any dislike for the institution of the republic, careful listeners would notice that he will always refer to the \"Irish Army\", rather than its full title, as well as using \"Ulster\" to refer to \"Northern Ireland\".\nSteele is loyal to Ireland second, and to Ulster first. His decision to continue his military career as he did, was not an easy choice to make, but he feels it his responsibility to act as a spokesman for the loyalist military tradition in what is now an all-island army, lest their perspective be otherwise under-represented.\nDespite his differences with many of his fellow officers, they hold each other in mutually high regard, and living up to his name, he readies himself for any new conflict between Ireland and the syndicalists with a steely resolve."

Over the course of the conflict, he was eventually made OC of 2nd Battalion, Dublin Brigade and finally the Quartermaster for all Dublin IRA.

 # BM Decisions #
 IRE_bm_decisions:9 "Black Monday in Ireland"
 IRE_bm_decisions_desc:9 "Luain Dubh, or as what most are calling it, Black Monday.\nThe loyalists in the north of the country have delivered us an ultimatum of six months to make a measurable improvement to their own particular situation, lest they pull their support for the government.\n\nHowever, the rest of the country also suffers, and its population expects the government to do its utmost in starting efforts to relieve the great strain that this catastrophe has placed upon us — with us not doing so being surely felt in the next election.\n\nIf we fail to keep the loyalists on board, as well as fail in starting our economy's recovery, it will have grave consequences for our chance of re-election next year, let alone for the likely welfare of the nation.\n\nIf we fail in just one of these matters, it will damage our odds of re-election, but we would be still in with a good chance if we manage the campaign well.\n\nIf, against the odds, we somehow manage to both keep the loyalists on board and begin to kickstart the economy, we would surely be favourites to lead the next government.\n\nThere are no half-measures here! Our efforts are either seen as §Gappropriate§! by the UDP or the country as a whole, or are deemed not good enough — there is no in-between.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe initial relieving measures are seen as [IRE_loc_UCF_eco].\nThe UDP view the support given to the north as [IRE_loc_UCF_north]."
 IRE_UCF_mission:9 "Ulster Comes First!"
 IRE_UCF_mission_desc:9 "Since the 1929 Irish general election, Sinn Féin has been dependent on a confidence-and-supply agreement with the Ulster Democratic Party to achieve a majority in Dáil Éireann. Fearing that the Irish Government would put a greater emphasis on subsidising the south of the country during the crisis at northern expense, the UDP have used their leverage to insist that Sinn Féin's first priority be bailing out Ulster's economy.\nSetting a deadline of six months, UDP leader Basil Brooke has sternly warned he may discontinue his party's backing of Sinn Féin should he feel dissatisfied with their efforts."

 IRE_UCF_meet_orange_order:9 "Meet with the Orange Order"
 IRE_UCF_meet_orange_order_desc:9 "The Loyal Orange Institution, popularly known as the Orange Order, is an exclusively Protestant fraternal order that occupies a core place in Ulster loyalist society, its ranks comprising large numbers amongst all social classes, including the overwhelming majority of the Ulster Democratic Party's TDs. By publicly arranging a meeting with the Orange Order, we can assure loyalists that Sinn Féin is committed to respecting their religious faith and traditions."
 IRE_UCF_meet_loyalist_leaders:9 "Attempt Backroom Deal with UDP Leadership"
 IRE_UCF_meet_loyalist_leaders_desc:9 "In order to keep our party's close working relationship with the Ulster Democratic Party running smoothly, it remains crucial that we grease the wheels with agreements for additional funding of predominantly Protestant constituencies and organisations. Naturally, as such deals would be exceedingly unpopular in ordinary times, let alone a moment of financial catastrophe, it is imperative that these vital arrangements be handled away from disapproving public eyes."
 IRE_UCF_counter_nordie_syndies:9 "Counter Northern Syndicalist Rhetoric"
 IRE_UCF_counter_nordie_syndies_desc:9 "Ulster has a long but marginalised leftist tradition, with socialist Protestants in the past, even those seeking to continue the union with Britain, being branded \"rotten Prods\" and ostracised alongside Catholics. The British Revolution gave birth to left-wing loyalism, seeking the integration of Northern Ireland into the Union of Britain, though their ideas remained fringe until Black Monday gifted them an opportunity to advance their views. Let alone dealing with other more \"mainstream\" socialists, the UDP and Sinn Féin have common cause in combating the rhetoric of these upstarts, neither wishing the Union of Britain the assistance of another fifth column."

 # Eco Decisions #
 IRE_economy_decisions:0 "Développement économique"
 IRE_economy_decisions_desc:9 "Ever since its neglect during the Industrial Revolution, Ireland has never been the strongest of economies. Primarily agrarian, with most industrialisation concentrated in the north and in the few other cities, Ireland has fallen behind the rest of Europe, though has fared better than some other countries in the south and east.\n\nIf we are to have any hope of being a contender in the continent, we must invest in developing our economy, whether that be by expanding and renewing our agricultural tradition, exploiting our limited natural resources, or mass industrialisation to match our European neighbours."

 IRE_leinster_relief_desc:9 "Black Monday hit the urban population of Leinster hard leading to mass unemployment and homelessness. Our relief works will see the homeless fed and housed while new employment opportunities are created."
 IRE_northern_ireland_relief_desc:9 "The production centres of the industrialised North took a hard blow from Black Monday, with many factories shutting their doors. It is vital that we support those made redundant and revive the economy lest more radical solutions gain popularity."
 IRE_munster_relief_desc:9 "Farmers in Munster were once again forced to abandon their native land when the rising costs due to Black Monday led to many farms becoming unsustainable. If we are to maintain the population and the food production, we must do everything we can to assist rural smallholders to return to their fields."
 IRE_connacht_relief_desc:9 "Connacht has often been left behind when it comes to development. Our relief programs will support the ever-dwindling Gaeltacht regions, as well as Galway City, to ensure they are not left behind again."

 IRE_finish_bm_sf_spending:9 "Decrease Spending"
 IRE_finish_bm_sf_spending_desc:9 "It may not be a popular decision, but it is necassary to cut costs in various areas if our economy is to recover."

 IRE_finish_bm_scndp:0 "Reconstruire l'économie"
 IRE_finish_bm_scndp_desc:9 "Ireland's economy still needs saving, and our farmers and local craftsmen are key to that recovery. We will give them whatever supports they need to keep Ireland strong and self-sufficient, even if that includes restrictions on imports and tax incentives to Irish companies."

 IRE_cork_steel_works:9 "Expand the §YCork§! Steel Works"
 IRE_cork_steel_works_desc:9 "Steel production in Ireland has been bolstered in recent years by the creation of a major private steel mill in the Cobh area of Cork, primarily supplying one of our naval bases there. However, in order to produce the levels of steel needed for a sustained war effort, the state will need at least partial ownership of the site and to expand it greatly.

By radiating outwards from our capital in Dublin, we should have this portion completed speedily."
 IRE_northern_ireland_electric_desc:9 "Ulster is a province of two halves; low-lying and densely populated east Ulster is already mostly electrified, it was simply a matter of connecting built up towns along a flat plain. West Ulster, however, is the complete opposite; what land that is not half way up a mountain is found in wet, marshy bogs. Although pre-existing railways will give us a basic blueprint for how to link up the main settlements, covering the hinterlands of the province will still be time consuming."
 IRE_munster_electric_desc:9 "Although Munster boasts two of Ireland's most significant cities, Cork and Limerick, this belies the fact that much of Munster is intensely rural, and this makes electrification of the province a challenge. Additionally, the southwest of the province is a geographical labyrinth of mountainous peninsulas that would challenge even hardy goats to climb, much less humans."
 IRE_connacht_electric_desc:9 "The electrification of Connacht is a dramatic challenge. To begin with, large sections of the province are covered in soft, damp marshes housing bogs doing their best to prevent any infrastructure ever taking root. Although not as mountainous as Munster, Connacht too has its mountain ranges and they too are significant obstacles. Finally, Connacht is both Ireland's least populated and most rural province, with its population the most dispersed of the island, with a huge percentage living in villages and hamlets strung out along distant and far-flung farm roads. With the railroads few, and with many roads no more than muddy dirt paths, there is little existing infrastructure that we can build on top of, and thus in many cases we will be starting almost from scratch."

For centuries, the British have feared the island being used as a base by their enemies, while continental powers have aided Irish rebellions to wrest control of Irish ports from British hands. The Germans succeeded where the Spanish and French failed, and for a decade we have steadily drifted towards their sphere of influence. This was until the upheaval the came with Black Monday, which dealt a major blow to German interests and has given the British an opening to regain their former hegemony and spread syndicalist ideas.\n\nThe LÉ Macha Incident marks the beginning of a contest of diplomacy between the Union of Britain and the German Empire, as both powers seek to expand their influence within Ireland's society and institutions, and to potentially secure mastery over the isle's ports and skies for their use in the event of another Weltkrieg. This tug-of-war presents a great opportunity for Irish leaders to negotiate business opportunities and trade deals with the two naval powers for the benefit of the country's economy, however if not careful the growth of foreign influence may prove the undoing of Irish sovereignty, and political control of the nation will become merely a plaything of Ireland's benefactors...\n\nThe @GER §g[GER.GetName]§! currently have §Y[?GER.IRE_gateway_influence]§! points.\nThe @ENG §R[ENG.GetName]§! currently have §Y[?ENG.IRE_gateway_influence]§! points.\n\n$IRE_gateway_desc_ending$"

It is crucial to German diplomatic, financial and strategic interests that a nation of the Mitteleuropean bloc does not fall to the growing tide of syndicalism, and to this end we must completely ensure via the promotion of Germanophile influences within the country, that the Irish Republic remains friendly to the Reichspakt. While the Irish may drift closer to us on their own accord, it would be in our interests to fully ensure that this occurs, as the use of the island as a base from which German forces can carry out aerial and naval operations against the British, and extend the Kaiserliche Marine's power into the Atlantic Ocean, may prove vital should war break out against the Third Internationale.\n\n§CWe§! currently have §Y[?GER.IRE_gateway_influence]§! points.\nThe @ENG §R[ENG.GetAdjective]§! currently have §Y[?ENG.IRE_gateway_influence]§! points.\n\n$IRE_gateway_desc_ending$\n$IRE_gateway_desc_ending_pp$"

With multiple TDs elected from each constituency, a strong party-focused democratic tradition has developed in Ireland, favouring the existence of multiple parties, and ensuring that coalitions and other agreements are often a necessity in the successful formation of a government.\n\nConsidering the banning of the syndicalist parties from elections, the disinterest of the UDP to participate outside of their north-eastern heartlands, and the abstentionism of some members of Aontas Náisiúnta, there are 7 different parties competing for a position in government.\n\nConfounding this multi-party system however, is the office of Uachtarán, or President. The Presidency is directly chosen by the people, using a single-transferable-vote, at the same time as the Dáil election. This means that whoever wins the plurality of votes on the initial count, may not end up in charge after all the rounds of counting are completed. While voting for an \"outside candidate\" can never be a wasted vote, unlike some other democracies, the end result is still that the candidates that hold the broadest appeal across the political spectrum are likely to be successful.\n\nAs Ireland is a Presidential Republic, the first role of the President is to attempt to form a government, almost guaranteed to include their own party. Even with multiple parties running for the office, only a few are seen as having a genuine chance of gaining the Presidency itself.\n\nThe parties that have a chance at the Presidency, and to lead the formation of a government, are §gSinn Féin§!, §cAn Saorstát Críostúil§! and the §SLabour Party§!.\n\nThe current likely winner is [IRE_loc_election_plurality_holder]"

 # Intro #
 ireland.0.t:0 "L'Etat de la République en 1936"
 ireland.0.d:9 "Le président Michael Collins dirige la République d'Irlande pour son deuxième mandat et pour la septième année consécutive. Depuis son indépendance, son parti a supervisé tous les grands événements du pays, malgré un passage dans l'opposition dans les années 1920.\n\nC'est grâce à ses négociations que l'impossible a été réalisé : pendant la Révolution Britannique, il a réussi à obtenir l'entrée pacifique de l'Irlande du Nord dans la République, qui était restée partie du Royaume-Uni dans le traité anglo-irlandais.\n\nC'est également sous son autorité que l'économie irlandaise a été réorientée de la Grande-Bretagne vers l'Allemagne, avec jusqu'ici un grand succès. Cependant, cela ne s'est pas fait sans prix à payer. Avec son image de héros de guerre et de patriote inébranlable remise en question par ceux qui s’inquiètent de l’hostilité de son gouvernement envers les radicaux politiques, de sa dépendance à l’égard du capital allemand et de sa passivité face aux excès loyalistes dans le Nord. Bien entendu, le nouvel accord de confiance et d'approvisionnement entre le Sinn Féin et le Parti Démocrate d'Ulster, garantissant le maintien de l'autonomie des habitants du Nord en échange de leur soutien au gouvernement actuel, n'aide pas à ce que cette situation ne change.\n\nAssailli sur sa gauche, sa droite et même son centre, Collins fait face à d'anciens alliés et à de nouveaux ennemis, tandis que la menace rouge brille d'un air menaçant, à seulement un court voyage à travers la mer d'Irlande..."
 ireland.0.a:9 "La liberté impose des responsabilités."

 ireland.1.t:9 "La République modèle"
 ireland.1.d:9 "Cette nouvelle année est marquée par le 20e anniversaire de l'Insurrection de Pâques et, avec lui, la proclamation de la République d'Irlande.\n\nLes Irlandais attendent avec impatience les célébrations à venir en avril, mais peu d'entre eux auraient pu imaginer l'Irlande d'aujourd'hui. De l'extérieur, l'Irlande apparaît comme une démocratie multipartite florissante, sa nouvelle image plus moderne étant renforcée par l'atmosphère cosmopolite et de plus en plus riche des centres urbains, provoquée par l'adhésion de l'Irlande à la Mitteleuropa et la présence continentale accrue sur l'île.\n\nLe gouvernement actuel du Sinn Féin a hâte de poursuivre son mandat avec la paix et la prospérité qui ont marqué son action jusqu'à présent, et également de marquer cet anniversaire important de manière approprié. Leur réputation n'est cependant pas sans tâche.\n\nConsidérant que les échecs des gouvernements précédents sont dus à la faiblesse du pouvoir exécutif, les actions de Collins visant à centraliser davantage l'autorité de la présidence, même par des moyens constitutionnels, sont la cause d'une hostilités à son encontre parmi ses rivaux. Il y a aussi la question de l'acceptation tacite par ses gouvernements du monopole loyaliste dans le Nord, au détriment de leurs voisins nationalistes.\n\nCette facette d'autoritarisme, combinée à la répression sévère du gouvernement contre tout ce qui ressemble à du syndicalisme ou du radicalisme, ainsi qu'à une censure politique et médiatique rigoureuse, a donné un aspect plus sévère à ce qui autrement apparaîtrait comme une République moderne et tolérante.\n\nMalgré cela, l’approbation du public reste élevée et, à l’approche de Pâques, Collins a de quoi être satisfait."
 ireland.1.a:9 "C'est une bonne époque."

 ireland.2.t:9 "La mort du Roi George"
 ireland.2.d:9 "George V, Roi du Royaume-Uni, de ses dominions et Empereur des Indes, s'est finalement libéré de son enveloppe mortelle après avoir succombé à une longue maladie. Alors que ce qui reste de l’Empire Britannique entre en état de deuil, l’Irlande se retrouve dans une situation plus compliquée. Sans surprise, l’Irlande du Nord et le Parti Démocrate d’Ulster sont entrés dans un état de deuil officiel pour leur roi, mais ailleurs, les sentiments sont mitigés.\n\nLe Roi George a souvent été considéré comme un hibernophile, et ses interventions en faveur de l’Irlande lui ont valu d'être discrètement respectées, même parmi les républicains ; il a ainsi critiqué la réaction de la Grande-Bretagne face à l'insurrection de Pâques, essayé d'arrêter les exécutions pendant la Guerre d'Indépendance et marqué son opposition farouche aux célèbres paramilitaires britanniques, les Black and Tans. Mais son exploit le plus durable restera peut-être d'avoir convaincu son cabinet conservateur d'approuver son célèbre discours d'ouverture du Parlement nord-irlandais, promouvant la paix, le pardon et la réconciliation entre tous les Irlandais, ce qui, au moins dans une certaine mesure, s'est produit...\n\nDans la majeure partie de l’Irlande, la mémoire de son ancien roi reste entachait par tout ce qu’il représentait, mais d'un point de vue strictement personnel, il était largement reconnu comme impartial. Même s’il ne fait aucun doute que même en dehors du nord, de nombreux Irlandais et Irlandaises notent cette occasion avec respect, le président Collins a été averti que toute manifestation manifeste de chagrin ou de soutien pourrait déclencher des conflits politiques tendus, qui ne manqueraient pas de faire rage en ces temps difficiles."
 ireland.2.a:9 "Cela ne nous concerne pas vraiment."
 ireland.2.b:9 "Envoyez aux Canadiens un message privé de condoléances."
 ireland.2.c:9 "Au diable la politique, Collins prendra la parole!"

 ireland.3.t:9 "L'Irlande s'exprime sur la mort du roi"
 ireland.3.d.start:9 "Les relations avec la République d'Irlande ont été quelque peu glaciales, voire inexistantes, depuis l'effondrement de l'Empire en 1925, suite à leur annexion juridiquement fallacieuse de l'Irlande du Nord et des ports du traité ; mais des échanges plus chaleureux ont lieu."
 ireland.3.d1:9 "$ireland.3.d.start$\n\nAujourd'hui, un télégramme privé a été remis au gouvernement par le président Collins lui-même, exprimant ses plus sincères condoléances pour la mort du Roi George et promettant que la mémoire de son dernier roi ne serait jamais oubliée, ni ternie."
 ireland.3.d2:9 "$ireland.3.d.start$\n\nAujourd'hui, le cabinet de Dublin a appris que le président Collins avait prononcé un discours respectueux et solennel en reconnaissance du décès du dernier roi d'Irlande. Même en tant que nationaliste et républicain irlandais, Collins a invoqué l'héritage de George en matière de promotion du pardon et de la réconciliation, sans aucun doute destiné à son propre pays politiquement divisé. Néanmoins, voir l'Irlande faire une telle démonstration publique sur le décès du roi a été une surprise pour beaucoup."
 ireland.3.a:9 "Comme c'est inattendu."
 ireland.3.b:9 "Même en Irlande, son héritage perdure."

 ireland.4.t:9 "Les Canadiens répondent"
 ireland.4.d:9 "Aujourd'hui, nous avons reçu une réponse du gouvernement canadien.\n\nIls nous ont remerciés pour nos vœux à l'occasion de la mort du roi et ont exprimé l'espoir que nos nations puissent laisser une grande partie de leur passé derrière elles."
 ireland.4.a:9 "C'est gentil de leur part."

 ireland.5.t:9 "Collins s'exprime à propos de la mort du roi George"
 ireland.5.d:9 "Aujourd'hui, dans le centre de Dublin, flanqué de membres de son cabinet , le président Collins a prononcé un discours solennel en reconnaissance du décès du dernier roi d'Irlande, George V. Collins a invoqué son héritage de promotion du pardon et de la réconciliation et a appelé tous les Irlandais à se concentrer sur l'unité et la paix plutôt que sur les conflits et la division.\n\nAlors que certains loyalistes radicaux ont contesté le fait que Collins « s'approprie » la mort du roi George, cela semble s'être plutôt bien passé puisque le chef de facto de l'Irlande du Nord, James Craig, s'est prononcé en faveur de Collins.\n\nNaturellement ailleurs, le discours a été controversé, certains membres de l'extrême gauche et de l'extrême droite accusant Collins de « faire le jeu d'un tyran britannique » et de « glorifier la cause loyaliste ». Quoi qu'il en soit, il semble avoir l'approbation silencieuse de la plupart des Irlandais quelle que soit leur allégeance."
 ireland.5.a:9 "C'était la bonne chose à faire."

 ireland.6.t:9 "La mort d'Hugo O'Neill"
 ireland.6.d:9 "Une nouvelle surprenante est arrivée du Portugal : Hugo José Jorge O'Neill est décédé tragiquement en mer. Ancien officier de la marine portugaise, O'Neill était à bord du navire portugais Sol Nascente lors de retrouvailles avec d'autres vétérans de la marine portugaise, lorsque le navire s'est échoué et a coulé, entraînant la mort de plusieurs de ses passagers, dont O'Neill lui-même. Le défunt était le chef de la dynastie Clanaboy O'Neill, l'un des plus important des anciens O'Neill, la famille la plus puissante d'Irlande à l'époque gaélique. La famille avait fui vers le continent dans les années 1700 après la confiscation et la colonisation de leurs terres et vivait désormais comme une petite maison noble, au Portugal.\n\nUne frange de l’extrême droite irlandaise estime que l’Irlande ne peut véritablement prospérer qu’en restaurant les traditions gaéliques, dont certains vont jusqu’à inclure une monarchie gaélique. Si Hugo devait être considéré comme un prétendant potentiel, c'est désormais son fils Jorge Maria qui, comme son défunt père, n'a montré aucun intérêt pour de telles propositions.\n\nDes publications à faible tirage produites par ces mouvements ont déjà commencé à diffuser des théories du complot autour de la cause de l'accident, affirmant que le navire aurait été saboté ou bombardé par des agents britanniques ou français opérant au Portugal."
 ireland.6.a:9 "Quelle époque étrange nous vivons."

 # Black Monday / Ulster Comes First #
 ireland.7.t:9 "Le Lundi Noir frappe l'Irlande"
 ireland.7.d:9 "Cela a frappé l’Irlande comme une tempête. Tout d'abord un changement progressif de pression à mesure que la croissance allemande ralentissait, puis une attaque soudaine et dramatique. Des sources multiples et disparates en provenance d’Allemagne en ont été la première indication, atteignant en premier le gouvernement et les investisseurs de premier plan. À partir de là, la nouvelle de ce krach économique à Berlin s’est répandue comme une traînée de poudre, et au moment où elle a été publiée dans les journaux le lendemain matin, rares étaient ceux qui l’ignoraient encore. Malgré les affirmations des journaux selon lesquelles « la situation s'était stabilisée », chaque jour des nouvelles de plus en plus sombres arrivaient, et bientôt, les répercussions ont frappé l'Irlande, les investissements ont disparu, les commandes se sont taries. A leur tour, les bâtiments gouvernementaux se sont remplis d'individus, se précipitant de département en département, portant les derniers rapports.\n\nEn quelques jours, les premières usines fermèrent leurs portes et les premières banques se trouvèrent incapables de répondre aux demandes d’une clientèle terrifiée. Le moteur économique de la nation cala à mesure que les répercussions se propageaient à tous les secteurs, un choc et un engourdissement s’installant dans toute l’Irlande ; le silence des gens vivant dans la peur. Les appels lancés à Dublin pour que le gouvernement fasse quelque chose sont devenus plus forts, presque assez forts pour étouffer les grognements des estomacs vides. S’ils ne répondaient pas rapidement à ces appels, ils pourraient devenir plus que de simples demandes d’aide."
 ireland.7.a:9 "Jésus, Marie, Joseph..."

 ireland.8.t:9 "Malaise en Ulster"
 ireland.8.d:9 "La province d'Ulster, en particulier dans les régions qui composent l'Irlande du Nord, est depuis longtemps la région la plus industrialisée d'Irlande. Pendant des décennies, les arguments loyalistes contre l’autonomie irlandaise ou l’indépendance ont soutenu que le reste du pays utiliserait la région comme une béquille économique, soutenant ainsi le sud, comparativement plus rural. À la suite du Lundi Noir qui a mis à rude épreuve l'économie irlandaise, les craintes ont brutalement refait surface, se propageant comme une traînée de poudre parmi les protestants d'Ulster, y compris au sein du Parti Démocrate d'Ulster.\n\nLes DT de l'UDP ont publiquement fait connaître leurs revendications à travers des discours de colère au Dáil Éireann, insistant sur le fait que le bien-être de l'Ulster, étant la province économiquement la plus forte de l'île et ayant rejoint la République d'Irlande uniquement parce qu'ils craignaient davantage le régime syndicaliste, devait être prioritaire pour profiter de la reprise économique. Ils ont également profité de l'occasion pour proférer des menaces vagues mais inquiétantes de bouleversements dans la province si leurs demandes n'étaient pas prises en considération. Cela a naturellement provoqué la fureur des autres partis présents à la Chambre, qui soulignent que l'Ulster n'est pas la seule province du pays à souffrir et que les insistances de l'UDP ne sont guère plus qu'un égoïsme à peine dissimulé.\n\nAlors que Collins et nombre de ses ministres partagent à n'en pas douter le profond sentiment de frustration des autres partis face au caractère déraisonnable de l'UDP en cette période de crise nationale, leur refus de répondre aux rumeurs selon lesquelles des catholiques seraient licenciés en nombre disproportionné, les placent politiquement entre le marteau et l'enclume : ils dépendent en effet de l'accord de confiance et d'approvisionnement de l'UDP pour préserver une majorité Sinn Féin au Dáil, et sont soucieux de maintenir la paix sur l'île, même si cela doit se faire au bénéfice de la minorité loyaliste et au détriment du grand public irlandais."
 ireland.8.a:9 "Ces protestants ne font rien de bon, comme d'habitude."
 ireland.8.a.tt:9 "§YLes loyalistes exigent que nous accordions la priorité à l'Irlande du Nord face aux retombées de la crise financière.§! \n"

 ireland.9.t:9 "Les usines vides"
 ireland.9.d:9 "Au cours des dernières années, même si l'économie irlandaise n'a pas connu un véritable essor, elle a connu une croissance relativement stable, en particulier dans le secteur industriel où de nombreuses personnes se sont retrouvées attirées vers les villes avec la promesse d'un salaire fiable. Même si l’Irlande reste l’une des nations les plus agraires d’Europe, ce changement a conduit au développement de ce qui pourrait être considéré comme une véritable « classe ouvrière », comme on ne l’observait auparavant que dans le cœur industriel du Nord. Cette promesse d’une croissance régulière et d’emplois stables était l’une des carottes sur lesquelles le Sinn Féin avait pu s’appuyer pour assurer son soutien aux zones urbaines.\n\nDu fait du traumatisme économique suite au récent krach des marchés allemands, tout cela a pris fin. Alors que l'économie irlandaise continue de se contracter, des usines commencent à fermer leurs portes, laissant leurs anciens employés sans autre emploi vers lequel se tourner. Leurs maigres économies ayant fondu comme neige au soleil, beaucoup ressentent désormais un ressentiment croissant envers le gouvernement actuel du Sinn Féin, qui ne peut plus se positionner comme le parti de la prospérité.\n\nSans ce contrat tacite entre eux et leurs électeurs, beaucoup se demandent maintenant pourquoi se donner la peine de voter pour un parti qui ne peut rien promettre d'autre qu'un statu quo ? Les travaillistes promettent le salut aux travailleurs laissés pour compte par le Sinn Féin, tandis que Saorstát Críostúil sert de refuge à ceux de droite qui craignent la perspective d'un gouvernement travailliste.\n\nLe Sinn Féin est désormais confronté au cauchemar de tout parti au pouvoir : il doit d’une manière ou d’une autre essayer de demander aux électeurs d’oublier tout ce qu’ils ont fait auparavant et de montrer que cette fois, ce sera différent."
 ireland.9.a:9 "Nous reconquerrons leur cœur, comme à l'époque."
 ireland.9.a.tt:9 "Supprime §Y3§! §Yusines civiles.§! situées hors-carte"

 ireland.10.t:9 "Les ports silencieux"
 ireland.10.d:9 "La chute de la demande en provenance du continent s'est immédiatement fait sentir dans les nombreux ports irlandais, car chaque jour de moins en moins de navires arrivaient, et ceux qui arrivaient repartaient avec de moins en moins de marchandises. Là où autrefois les ports grouillaient d'activité, les quais remplis de produits prêts à être expédiés vers l'Europe continentale, un silence de mort règne. Pour les différents dockers des grands ports irlandais, il n'y a d'autre choix que d'attendre et, comme ils n'ont rien d'autre à faire, ils parlent.\n\nLes premières discussions sur des sujets triviaux comme le sport et la vie domestique ont inévitablement cédé la place à des discussions sur la détérioration de la situation économique, et au fil des jours, ces conversations sont devenues de plus en plus amères. Beaucoup ont commencé à douter ouvertement de la capacité du gouvernement à résoudre la crise, et certains ont même commencé à se demander si quelque chose de différent pouvait être tenté. Une fois que l'argent fini par manquer pour discuter au pub, ils restèrent dans le froid, errant de-ci de-là dans le vain espoir de trouver du travail ce jour-là, mais les heures s'écoulaient inexorablement jusqu'à ce qu'il soit l'heure de rentrer chez eux, les mains vides.."
 ireland.10.a:9 "Ils feraient mieux de ne pas avoir d'idées."

 ireland.11.t:9 "La vie parmi les fantômes"
 ireland.11.d:9 "Avec l'adoption de l'Irish Economic Advancement Act (IEAA), le gouvernement irlandais s'est engagé à procéder à une refonte rapide et complète de l'économie. Comme le stipule la loi, le gouvernement doit maintenant décider d'un objectif annuel pour améliorer l'économie. L'ancien gouvernement autoritaire, le Sinn Féin, ainsi que le Parti du développement national, estiment que l'Irlande doit se concentrer sur la construction de son industrie le plus rapidement possible. Une coalition syndicaliste dirigée par Jim Larkin soutient que donner du pouvoir aux syndicats est le meilleur moyen d'augmenter la productivité de notre pays. Enfin, le SC et le Labour suggèrent de mettre l'accent sur la recherche et le développement industriels."
 ireland.11.a:9 "Des régions qui peinent à tenir debout,\nmises à genoux."

 ireland.12.t:9 "La poussière se dissipe"
 ireland.12.d:9 "Pris par surprise par le soudain tourbillon économique qui a frappé l'Europe, le gouvernement irlandais s'est efforcé, dans les mois qui ont suivi le début du Lundi Noir, de sauver la situation financière du pays d'un effondrement complet et d'apaiser les demandes loyalistes visant à donner la priorité au sauvetage de l'économie de l'Ulster."
 ireland.12.d1:9 "$ireland.12.d$\n\nSurmontant ces obstacles, les efforts rapides et décisifs du gouvernement sur les deux fronts semblent avoir porté leurs fruits. Les plans de sauvetage des agriculteurs ont permis de maîtriser l'impact de la perte de revenus provenant des exportations, le Parti Démocrate d'Ulster et la population loyaliste restent favorables à l'administration actuelle en tant que rempart contre le syndicalisme et le nationalisme pur et dur. De même; les rapports des observateurs locaux ont révélé que, malgré les circonstances, le soutien du peuple irlandais au Sinn Féin reste élevé.\n\nBien que l'opinion publique soit globalement satisfaite de la manière dont le Sinn Féin a contenu le lundi noir, les questions persistantes concernant la fermeture des entreprises, les expulsions, le chômage et la question récurrente des privilèges d'Ulster continuent d'être un sujet brûlant dans les discours et les discours de l'opposition. propagande en préparation des prochaines élections.\n\nCependant, l'excellente gestion de la crise par le gouvernement signifie que le scénario de la réélection de Michael Collins à la présidence est désormais très probable, et de hauts députés du Saorstáit Críostúil ont laissé entendre en privé que, si le moment l'exigeait, ils pourrait être disposé à coopérer temporairement avec le Sinn Féin et même avec l'UDP pour le bien commun de la République d'Irlande."
 ireland.12.d2:9 "$ireland.12.d$\n\nWhile the government have restored stability to the nation's finances and prevented anarchy in rural areas, a choice which the majority of the Irish people agree was the correct decision, its failure to focus on Ulster to the degree demanded of them by the Ulster Democratic Party has resulted in disturbances within the province, and potentially endangered Sinn Féin's chances of re-election, should the UDP choose to end their confidence-and-supply agreement.\n\nNot only have the UDP grown irritated by the limited support provided to Ulster, with their fear of the abolition of the Ulster Privileges by an alternative administration being the only thing holding back notions of ceasing their support, but, making a bad state of affairs even worse, hardline loyalist and anti-Catholic elements have seized the opportunity to boost their fortunes by accusing the UDP of weakness and encouraging Protestant workers to organise protests and go on strike with the goal of further disrupting the Irish state.\n\nWhile their calls have been listened to only sporadically, and the UDP is tacitly accepting of the slight improvement in the state of the overall economy, it still presents a significant thorn in the government's side in light of Black Monday and the risk of violent clashes between loyalists and the Blueshirts."
 ireland.12.d3:9 "$ireland.12.d$\n\nMême si le gouvernement a réussi à répondre aux clameurs loyalistes et à maintenir le calme en Ulster, malgré les craintes que la crise n'entraîne l'ouverture de vieilles blessures, il n'a pas été en mesure d'éviter les effets délétères des ondes de choc du Lundi Noir ailleurs sur l'île. Par conséquent, l’administration a été accusée d’avoir donné la priorité aux intérêts loyalistes sur le reste de la nation.\n\nLes tentatives du gouvernement pour persuader une population furieuse que la décision de se concentrer sur l'Ulster était une initiative calculée visant à protéger les industries irlandaises, et pas seulement une mesure visant à apaiser l'UDP, ont eu moins d'influence que prévu. Dès lors, des manifestations dispersées ont éclaté dans la campagne irlandaise parmi les petits et les grands agriculteurs, irrités par l'incapacité du gouvernement à résoudre le déclin du niveau de vie rural et par son incapacité à offrir des subventions significatives pour compenser leur perte de revenus.\n\nCe tollé sporadique a été attisé avec enthousiasme par les partis de l'opposition, reconnaissant une occasion idéale de prendre les rênes de la République d'Irlande à la suite de ce qui semble avoir été une grave erreur du tribunal de l'opinion publique en faveur du Sinn Féin. La réalité est que le Sinn Féin aurait pu faire bien pire que d’aider ses partisans du Dáil, et son régime semble fonctionner sans problème jusqu’aux prochaines élections."
 ireland.12.d4:9 "$ireland.12.d$\n\nLes efforts du gouvernement dans ces deux domaines se sont soldés par un échec, avec de graves répercussions dans tout le pays. L’UDP est de plus en plus déçu par l’administration actuelle du Sinn Féin, sa position de grand parti loyaliste menacé par les partisans de la ligne dure en raison de leur faiblesse apparente, et le chômage, la baisse du niveau de vie et la criminalité sont en augmentation. Les partis d’opposition attiré par l'odeur du sang ont avidement attisé les flammes de la colère du public.\n\nDe manière alarmante pour l'avenir de la paix sur l'île, nombreux sont ceux qui ont remarqué un regain de soutien à Aontas Náisiúnta en dehors des bastions du parti à Munster et dans les régions à majorité catholique de l'Ulster, comme l'effondrement dramatique de l'économie pro-allemande, la protection des manifestants par les chemises bleues. Les agriculteurs et les craintes de bouleversements syndicalistes et loyalistes attirent un nombre croissant de personnes vers leurs propositions radicales.\n\nAu sein même du Sinn Féin, les rumeurs d'hostilité à l'égard du leadership de Collins fleurissent, ses réalisations passées en faveur de l'Irlande étant progressivement oubliées à la lumière de sa gestion maladroite de la crise. Aux yeux d’un nombre croissant de personnes, membres ou non du parti au pouvoir, il semblerait que le Grand Compagnon était un meilleur militaire qu'homme d’État."
 ireland.12.d5:9 "$ireland.12.d$\n\nThe government's failure to do anything with regards to Ulster has exploded in its face, sparking an outbreak of havoc at the most calamitous moment for Ireland's financial recovery. Disturbances have spread like wildfire across the north, worst of all riots in Protestant districts of Belfast and Derry, requiring force from the Gardaí to quell, and a series of bombings, killing several, mostly Catholic, civilians.\n\nThe UDP is simmering with outrage towards the administration, finding itself under severe pressure from hardliners due to their perceived weakness. Their confidence-and-supply agreement is as good as over, holding by a thread only for fear of Aontas Náisiúnta, their leader Eoin O'Duffy now baying for blood over the bombings in speeches given to surging audiences.\n\nCollins' leadership of Sinn Féin lives merely on borrowed time, his legacy forever stained. His foolishly spiteful actions are near-universally condemned even among party faithful, having destroyed any chance of re-election in the foreseeable future and placed the Irish Republic at risk of a return to the economic depression and paramilitary violence that marked Brugha's presidency."

 ireland.13.t:9 "Les Stitchies et les Pinnies"
 ireland.13.d:9 "Depuis la Grande Dépression des années 1920, les conflits entre paramilitaires d’extrême gauche et d’extrême droite sont persistants en Irlande, s’affrontant entre eux ainsi qu’avec les groupes loyalistes du nord. Les deux groupes paramilitaires, l'Armée Citoyenne Irlandaise Socialiste, surnommée « Pinnies », et la Garde Nationale d'Extrême Droite, également connue sous le nom de « Chemises Bleues » ou « Stitchies », font remonter leurs origines à l'ancienne IRA anti-traité. Leurs surnoms proviennent d'un symbole de leur descendance commune, le lys de Pâques, un insigne stylisé de lys calla vendu et porté pour commémorer l'Insurrection de Pâques, avec des lys en épingle et en papier portés par Saor Éire et l'ICA, et des insignes de lys brodés portés. par Aontas Náisiúnta et la Garde nationale. Le choix du lys a fini par devenir un marqueur visible de l'allégeance politique de chacun.\n\nLa crise du Lundi Noir a entraîné une recrudescence du recrutement paramilitaire et des incidents violents. Cela comprend des attaques contre des orateurs et des réunions de gauche et de droite, des combats de rue, des actes de vandalisme et des incendies criminels sur des propriétés appartenant à la partie adverse, en particulier en Ulster où des tensions autour des questions des droits des travailleurs, des privilèges d'Ulster et des allégations de discrimination contre les catholiques ne cessent de s’aggraver.\n\nAontas Náisiúnta, cherchant à éviter de donner au gouvernement un prétexte pour interdire son parti, continue de soutenir officiellement que les Chemises Bleues ont été dissoutes et que ces affrontements sont l'œuvre de justiciers indépendants, qui ne leur sont donc pas imputables.

 ireland.14.d:9 "Aujourd'hui, le 24 avril 1936, marquait le 20e anniversaire du début de l'Insurrection de Pâques de 1916. Beaucoup redoutaient que les festivités ne se passassent pas comme prévu, mais toutes les craintes furent apaisées suite aux instructions du bureau du président.\n\nCela commença par un défilé militaire élaboré dans les rues de Dublin, et culmina par une procession solennelle dans O'Connell Street, devant le General Post Office, où la Proclamation de la République d'Irlande fut lue pour la première fois le lundi de Pâques. Des fanfares, des fanfares et des cornemuseurs, accompagnaient les troupes, jouant de vieux airs gaéliques dans un style martial. La foule remplissait les rues, au point que certaines personnes regardaient depuis les ponts des bateaux flottant haut sur la Liffey.\n\nL’atmosphère était joyeuse et aucun spectateur n'aurait pu croire que cela se passait dans un pays dont l’économie s’effondrait à ce moment précis.\n\nAprès que les défilés furent achevés et que les soldats se rassemblaient, face au GPO, un seul officier militaire s'avança vers le devant du bâtiment pour lire la proclamation, comme Pádraig Pearse l'avait fait vingt ans auparavant. Mais, à la surprise de la foule et des officiels rassemblés, il ne s’agissait pas de n’importe quel officier.\n\nLe Président Collins, portant son uniforme de général de la guerre d'indépendance, se tenait face au pays. L’homme qui avait peut-être fait plus que quiconque pour gagner la liberté de l’Irlande prononça ces mots :  "

 ireland.15.d:9 ""Irlandais et Irlandaises : Au nom de Dieu et des générations mortes dont elle tient sa vieille tradition de nation, l'Irlande, à travers nous, appelle ses enfants sous son drapeau et fait grève pour sa liberté..."\n\nAprès avoir terminé la proclamation, un bref silence stupéfait tomba cédant vite la place à des applaudissements enthousiastes. Après qu'ils se furent calmés, le Président Collins commença à s’adresser résolument à la nation. Avec conviction, il reconnut les défis auxquels le pays était confronté et exhorta la population à les relever tous ensemble. Il poursuivit en affirmant que militairement, l’insurrection de Pâques elle-même ne serait jamais un succès, mais qu’elle était fondée sur l’espoir face au désespoir le plus extrême – un peu comme l’était l’Irlande aujourd’hui, face à ses difficultés actuelles.\n\nEn clôturant son discours, il annonça que le 24 avril allait devenir le Jour de l'Indépendance de l'Irlande, qui serait officiellement célébré chaque année. Cela devait marquer un nouveau départ, dans les relations de l'Irlande avec elle-même (dit-il en dirigeant son attention vers les quelques loyalistes symboliques présents) et avec le monde en général.\n\nIl n'est pas encore possible de mesurer exactement l'impact de ses paroles. Dans le pire des cas, peut-on parler d'une discrète admiration de la part de tout le spectre politique. En effet, quelle que soit leur position actuelle, tous les mouvements politiques en Irlande, à l’exception des loyalistes, sont liés au soulèvement de Pâques et, c'et l’un des rares éléments qui unissaient le pays. Que ce nouveau départ dont il parlait signifiait ou non que l’avenir de l’Irlande serait une réaffirmation du statu quo, ou le début d'un changement plus radical, n’était pour l'instant par une question pertinente.\n\nTout ce qui comptait pour le moment, c'est que malgré les bouleversements endémiques en cours, le peuple Irlandais possédait toujours la liberté et l’indépendance qu'il avait longtemps recherchées. Et c’était en réalité tout ce qui comptait vraiment."

 ireland.16.d:9 "Depuis le Lundi Noir, notre nation a connu une augmentation inquiétante de la subversion et de la violence perpétrée par les agitateurs syndicalistes. Parmi les incidents notoires, l'un des plus significatifs est le meurtre résultant d'un conflit foncier à Edgeworthstown, dans le comté de Longford, concernant le traitement des locataires dont les loyers étaient fixes, mais dont les salaires baissaient en raison de la crise économique. L'association locale des locataires a adopté une résolution invitant à l'intervention de Saor Éire et, implicitement, de sa branche armée, l'Irish Citizen Army (Armée Citoyenne Irlandaise), ce qui a entraîné la mort tragique du fils de l'agent foncier Gerald More O'Ferrell, Richard. Cela s'est produit lors d'un dîner qui a été pris d'assaut par des hommes de l'ICA vêtus d'uniformes de la Gardaí et portant des revolvers, avec l'intention d'enlever Gerald. Richard s'est battu contre les ravisseurs potentiels de son père, ce qui a conduit les deux O'Ferrell à être abattus lors de la bagarre, dont le fils, mortellement.\n\nUne grève des bus et des tramways de Dublin, organisée en réponse au licenciement d'un chauffeur accusé, sans preuve, de conduite dangereuse, est également marquée par une forte implication de la part du Parti Syndicaliste Irlandais de Jim Larkin, qui a constitué une cellule pour organiser les grévistes et a largement couvert la grève dans le journal de leur parti. En outre, des membres de l'Irish Citizen Army ont tiré sur les pneus de camions militaires déployés pour assurer le transport vers la ville en remplacement des bus en grève, blessant au passage deux membres de la Gardaí. Bien que la grève ait été résolue et que la Gardaí ait arrêté quarante-quatre syndicalistes, dont le fils de Larkin et membre de haut rang du FSI, Jim Larkin Jr., beaucoup commencent à craindre les implications de cette augmentation de l'activité syndicaliste et se demandent si l'Irlande pourrait potentiellement tomber dans le syndicalisme, à l'image de la Grande-Bretagne.\n\nDepuis cette grève, des manifestations sporadiques mais constantes ont eu lieu à Dublin, composées principalement de travailleurs mécontents issus de milieux urbains et ruraux, mais également de simples mécontents à l'égard de la politique du gouvernement. Ces protestations ont pris la forme de marches et de manifestations perturbatrices mais pacifiques devant le Dáil, sous l’œil vigilant de la Gardaí, dans le cas peu probable où quelque chose de plus grave prendrait forme."

Les deux manifestations ont attiré un grand nombre de partisans des deux partis qui, après s'être reconnus, ont commencé à se battre.\n\nCes dernières années, le Parti Travailliste Progressiste, socialement libéral et économiquement à gauche, et l'aile radicale abstentionniste et pro-intégriste d'Aontas Náisiúnta sont parvenus à bénéficier d'une base de soutien notable au sein de la jeunesse irlandaise, principalement dans les milieux universitaires, ce qui a conduit à la formation de mouvements de jeunesse, d'un côté, la Young Ireland Association (Association Jeune Irlande), dirigée par Ó Cuinneagáin, et le Young Labour (Mouvement Jeune Travailliste). On dit de ce dernier qu'il aurait été fondé pour éloigner la jeunesse irlandaise de l'attrait extrémiste de l'AN.\n\nLes rapports varient quant à l'origine de la violence, des sources proches de la Young Ireland Association affirmant que des membres du Young Labour ont tenté d'empêcher le discours de Ó Cuinneagáin et ont tendu une embuscade à plusieurs de ses partisans, tandis que d'autres sources proches du Parti Travailliste Progressiste affirment que la Young Ireland Association a donné le premier coup de poing en attaquant les étudiants de gauche qui se rendaient au séminaire de Sheehy-Skeffington. Plusieurs blessés ont été signalés et, à la suite de la bataille, les partisans du PLP et de l'AN ont appelé à "pas de liberté d'expression pour les intégristes" et à combattre respectivement les "syndies de la Grande-Bretagne occidentale", ce qui a accru les craintes que cet incident ne conduise à des affrontements entre partisans du PLP et de l'AN dans d'autres universités où la sympathie pour les deux partis est forte parmi les étudiants."

En effet, cette décision a encouragé les curés de tout le pays à dénoncer en chaire le libéralisme germanophile du Sinn Féin comme hostile à la culture irlandaise et à la moralité catholique, et à tenter de persuader leurs paroissiens de soutenir An Saorstát Críostúil."

Une mesure impossible et indésirable selon lui vue la plus grande influence de la langue anglaise.\n\nEn réponse aux affirmations selon lesquelles la renaissance de la langue irlandaise était nécessaire à l'indépendance nationale, MacDermot a fait remarquer que les nations des Amériques manquaient de langue exclusive, mais possédaient pourtant un sens complet de conscience nationale définie par la souveraineté populaire. Il a terminé en disant que l'Irlande n'était désormais plus composée uniquement de personnes de tradition gaélique et que cela devait être reconnu.\n\nCette déclaration a suscité l'indignation parmi certains revivalistes gaéliques, et Aontas Náisiúnta a saisi l'occasion pour remuer sa base et gagner du soutien en attaquant le Parti du Développement national, l'accusant d'être un parti de Britanniques de l'Ouest qui cherchent à accorder encore plus de concessions aux loyalistes. S'exprimant lors d'un grand rassemblement, Eoin O'Duffy s'est vanté que l'Irlande serait toujours une nation définie par sa foi et son identité gaélique, et a ridiculisé les affirmations selon lesquelles l'enseignement obligatoire de l'irlandais et l'exigence de cette langue pour entrer dans la fonction publique étaient discriminatoires. Selon lui, l'objection des protestants à de telles mesures prouvait seulement qu'ils n'étaient pas dignes de confiance et manquaient de loyauté envers la nation irlandaise."

Tourné en dérision car considéré comme démagogue par ses opposants, il s'est fait connaître pour ses rassemblements et ses discours populistes attaquant les « éléments parasites » de la société tels que les politiciens, les financiers, les transformateurs de produits agricoles, les fournisseurs d'intrants agricoles et, à l'occasion, les Juifs. Alors que les opinions socialement conservatrices sont fréquentes au sein du Clann na Talmhan et de ses partisans, les opinions économiques de gauche du parti, cherchant en particulier à bénéficier aux petits agriculteurs irlandais, ont conduit à une coopération étroite avec le Parti Travailliste dans tout l'ouest de l'Irlande.\n\nCe dernier a également vu son soutien augmenter après le Lundi Noir, avec une augmentation de l'activisme et des cellules travaillistes dans les grandes villes d'Irlande, notamment à Dublin, où leurs politiciens s'adressent régulièrement à de grandes foules au coin d'Abbey Street, avec des discours sur les bidonvilles, le chômage et des attaques contre le gouvernement du Sinn Féin pour son manque d'intérêt pour le sort des travailleurs irlandais. Les opposants du parti travailliste ont tenté d'endiguer leur ascension par le dénigrement habituel, mais les efforts acharnés du leader travailliste William O'Brien pour nettoyer le parti des influences syndicalistes et désavouer tout lien avec les partis ou organisations syndicalistes ont rendu de telles attaques peu convaincantes pour le nombre croissant de chômeurs. .\n\nDes rumeurs ont commencé à se répandre selon lesquelles Donnellan et O'Brien se seraient déjà rencontrés en privé pour convenir de la possibilité d'une coalition entre leurs deux partis en cas de succès aux prochaines élections, et les sondeurs ont suggéré que la montée du mécontentement au sein de la classe ouvrière irlandaise suite Le Lundi noir pourrait permettre à une alliance combinée travailliste et Clann na Talmhan de passer du statut de partis mineurs au sein du Dáil, à une force politique majeure de la politique irlandaise."

Les fortunes du Parti parlementaire irlandais, du Sinn Féin et du malheureux Cumann an tSaorstáit de Brugha ont toutes suivi ce schéma jusqu'à ce que les retombées des échecs du CatS provoquent une nouvelle ère ; celui d’une fracture politique dans laquelle un parti à lui seul ne pouvait plus exercer la capacité de détenir une majorité au Dáil Éireann.\n\nAlors que le détrônement du Sinn Féin semble une possibilité, les commentateurs débattent avec acharnement des conséquences de ce qui serait le premier gouvernement de coalition irlandais.

Collins' authoritarianism and dependence on Germany had its dissenters among his party, but they previously remained silent out of fear of challenging their seemingly indomitable leader. Now that the Big Fellow's reputation was no longer the sacred cow it had once seemed, these voices were no longer silent. As elections loomed, few wanted to be tied to the sinking ship that Collins' government had become. In backrooms and corridors, members of Sinn Féin began to plan for a future beyond the Big Fellow.\n\nThings came to a head in a meeting with certain members of the party, they hinted to him that perhaps he may wish to \"consider his position\" before the \"certain concerned individuals forced an unfavourable outcome\". The thinly-veiled nature of these statements was obvious to Collins — they were demanding he resign, or they would try and boot him out. He didn't know who they envisioned to replace him, but he suspected Mulcahy being absent from the meeting was no coincidence.\n\nHe was a fox backed into a corner, possibly more so than any time when he was the most wanted man in the United Kingdom. He could still fight back though — he still held all the power in this arrangement and could fire a warning shot to his cabinet that breaking ranks in times such as these would not be tolerated. There were still plenty who still believed in him, to whom his mythos as the man who had one their freedom still mattered, and they would support him if he showed he was not going to give in, and was going to keep fighting. If he could show he still had momentum, he knew those still on the fence would support him, in the interests of party stability if nothing else.

Initially many within the party were unsure who could even fill the Big Fellow's boots, and in spite of the candidates who had been proposed in backdoor meetings, there was still a vague feeling that anything could happen, one marked by a sense of dread considering the looming election.\n\nIn reality, the question of Collins' successor had been settled from the beginning. While Sinn Féin wished to distance themselves from Collins, they still were largely aligned with his policies, all they needed was a figure to rally around. They found that figure in General Richard Mulcahy, a leading republican since the War of Independence, who has shown himself to be a astute player of the political game, thanks in part to his popularity from the war. In the eyes of many within the party, if anyone was going to be able to set the party back on course, it was going to be Mulcahy.\n\nWhatever his skills however, the mere fact Mulcahy's accession alone will not be enough to secure Sinn Féin victory in this election.

The sentiment that had convinced his colleagues to try unseat him was even more fervent among the public, and knowing that Collins would still be leading Sinn Féin into the election would likely make the grievances of many irreconcilable.

 ireland.27.d:9 "Naturally, in light of recent altercations originating in loyalist demands for Ulster's prioritisation during the crisis, the topic of the Ulster Privileges and the treatment of Northern Catholics has once again become a key item of debate during the election period.\n\nSinn Féin, dependent on a confidence-and-supply arrangement with the Ulster Democratic Party to achieve a majority in the Dáil, have denied rumours of Catholics being fired in greater numbers, and continued to defend the Ulster Privileges as the only solution for creating peace on the isle.\n\nAn Saorstát Críostúil has promised once more to abolish the Ulster Privileges and put an end to anti-Catholic discrimination, attempting to regain ground lost to Aontas Náísiúnta among Northern Catholics due to the hesitation of Cathal Brugha's government in the late 1920s to repeal the Privileges in the midst of the Great Depression. Asked for their opinions on ensuring long-term peace in Ulster, senior SC TDs mooted a move towards a federal Ireland as a possible solution to the current situation.\n\nThe Labour Party, reflecting a long-time position taken by the Irish labour movement, has insisted that Catholics and Protestants workers have more in common with each other than their bosses, and must forgo their sectarian differences to instead unite in opposition to class exploitation. However, Labour has pointed out that the status quo enshrined by the Ulster Privileges is clearly failing to work and that the discrimination against Catholic employees by Protestant employers must be brought to an end."

 ireland.28.t:9 "The Mitteleuropa Question"
 ireland.28.d:9 "A key question of debate raging throughout the build-up to the elections has been Ireland's continued membership of the Central European Economic Union, better known as Mitteleuropa. Initially popular after Irish entry in 1930 saw the end of the Great Depression's effects, the return of economic crisis to the Emerald Isle in the form of Black Monday has caused many to begin rethinking their views.\n\nSinn Féin has remained steadfast on the party's decision to join, pointing to the benefits of European trade for the Irish economy and warning that without it the Irish economy would become a plaything of the British syndicalists, with all the ominous consequences implied.\n\nAn Saorstát Críostúil has questioned the necessity of Irish membership of the bloc, courting the votes of AN-sympathetic anti-Mitteleuropa campaigners who have scattered the streets of Irish cities with hordes of propaganda leaflets branded with an old slogan from the Easter Rising, \"Neither King nor Kaiser!\". As SC party leader Éamon de Valera, one of the few commandants to survive the Rising, has argued, the martyrs of 1916 did not die so that Irish businesses and goods could be outcompeted by German ones.\n\nLabour has remained cautious on the Mitteleuropa question, taking the opportunity to accuse Sinn Féin of caring foremost about German interests and yet at the same time accusing An Saorstát Críostúil of recklessness. Should they be elected, they claim, they will work within the framework of Mitteleuropa to put the economic interests of Irish workers first and unpeg the Irish punt from the German mark, asserting Irish sovereignty without risking further destabilisation."

 ireland.29.d:9 "The Irish people are, as a whole, staunchly religious, with the Catholic Church holding a major influence as a result of centuries of British oppression of the Catholic faith. As such, the issue of the separation of religion and state is a heated one.\n\nSinn Féin, under Collins' tenure, has pushed for a policy of pluralism, promoting a somewhat secular philosophy designed not to alienate Ireland's Presbyterian and Church of Ireland population, and other minorities. In line with the party's Germanic influences, Collins has used the example of the relationship between Catholics and Protestants in Germany as a model for the Irish nation to follow.\n\nAn Saorstát Críostúil has long tried to stand out as the most Christian political party of the Irish Republic, a political position for the party has in recent times found itself with tough competition in the form of the radically right-wing Aontas Náísiúnta. Nonetheless the support of the majority of the Catholic clergy remains for now behind SC, and the party's TDs have a made a point in their speeches to denounce Collins and Sinn Féin as anti-Catholic secularists who have betrayed Ireland's ancient faith by permitting influences such as contraception, dance halls and divorce to corrupt the hearts and souls of the Irish people.\n\nThe Labour Party, being particularly vulnerable to accusations of harbouring anti-Christian politics in light of their centre-left alignment and socialist origins, has taken great measures to emphasise through speeches by their TDs and articles in their party newspaper The Standard of the party's commitment to aspects of Catholic social teaching, and opposition to the godless ideology of syndicalism. As Labour sees it, their belief in the establishment of a just social order are perfectly in keeping with the teachings of Jesus Christ and the Papal Encyclical of Rerum Novarum."

 ireland.30.t:9 "The British Question"
 ireland.30.d:9 "In light of the decrease in German power in the wake of Black Monday, the question of Ireland's relations with its closest neighbour, the Union of Britain, has become a more pertinent matter in the run-up to the election.\n\nSinn Féin, having been denounced left, right and centre by the opposition as being unpatriotic as a result of their support for the Ulster Privileges and continued Irish membership of Mitteleuropa, have eagerly seized the opportunity to play the nationalist and Anglophobic card, calling for increased security and armament to safeguard Ireland from British invasion and infiltration.\n\nAn Saorstát Críostúil has, in an unusual move, pushed for closer relations between the Irish Republic and the Union of Britain. In a speech that has provoked much controversy, Éamon de Valera argued that so long as the two nations could stick to \"tending their own gardens\", they would find themselves natural allies as the islands of Ireland and Great Britain, in de Valera's view, would always possess a mutual self-interest in preserving each other's independence, for their own sovereignty would be placed in jeopardy if the other's was to be threatened.\n\nThe Labour Party has also called for diplomacy with the Union of Britain, arguing from a trading standpoint that a lack of commerce with Ireland's closet neighbour is a hindrance to Irish economic growth, and that open trade would improve the business prospects of Irish traders, who currently are forced to resort to selling to the Union under the table. Though an abnormal argument for Labour to make, it helps to deter accusations of harbouring syndicalist sympathies of which the party, due to their social democratic politics and trade union ties, remain deathly afraid."

As this turbulent election season finally draws to a close, fingers are crossed throughout the nation as the ballots are counted.

Just like Sinn Féin before them, de Valera will be forced to entreat the support of other parties to form a government, an arrangement that could likely require compromising on their ideals in certain areas."
 ireland.32.d.lem:9 "Of the possible contenders for coalition partners, one party operates along a similar enough wavelength to ours in the Dáil to be considered the main priority for negotiation, the National Development Party.

 ireland.32.d.end:9 "However, in the same manner that Sinn Féin before SC was sunk in the people's eyes by the many concessions made to the Ulster Democratic Party, so too may SC's prospective allies the NDP, possessing a more laissez-faire economic outlook and an Anglophilic streak, being mainly descended from the remnants of the Irish Parliamentary Party, are asking for terms beyond the boundaries of reason. Balancing the desires of his supporters with those of his coalition partners shall prove vital should de Valera wish to avoid the political fate of his most bitter rival."

 ireland.33.d1:9 "As SC suspected beforehand, the Anglophile leanings of many of the National Development Party's notables have resulted in problems arising as they engaged in talks to form a government. The NDP's leader Seán Lemass, although nowhere near as pro-British as his fellows, is a sternly pragmatic man who unlike SC, spares little sympathy for the plight of Northern Catholics, and regards the resuscitation of the Irish economy as the utmost priority, fearing that alienating loyalists while the effects of Black Monday still continue to take their detrimental toll on the island, might derail any efforts by sparking instability.\n\nHe has insisted that An Saorstát Críostúil must agree to avoid the issue of the Ulster Privileges as a condition for the formation of any coalition between SC and the NDP. Éamon de Valera and his party, on the other hand, are keenly aware that should such the news of such an agreement be leaked in the currently heated political environment, the consequences could be disastrous. As a cunning negotiator and possessing a good personal and working relationship with Lemass, de Valera could try to haggle with Lemass on this matter, pledging to bring Ireland's financial situation under control first, and resolve the issue of the Privileges afterwards, though some of Lemass's colleagues will be less than pleased."
 ireland.33.d.eod:9 "Alternatively, SC can abandon their negotiations with the NDP, and establish a government with Aontas Náisiúnta. As much as senior SC figures including de Valera hate to admit it, the ideals of SC share more in common with AN than with the NDP, and this has not gone unnoticed by SC backbenchers, party members and voters alike, many of whom increasingly favour a coalition with AN. With resentment towards the Ulster Privileges only becoming more inflamed as time goes on, many in SC see a Faustian bargain with Eoin O'Duffy's party as the only hope for the Ireland's future if the NDP stubbornly refuses to cooperate."

 ireland.34.d1:9 "Though it took several lengthy days of arduous debate and negotiation, eventually Éamon de Valera, Seán Lemass and various senior figures from both parties, managed to work out an arrangement. The National Development Party would agree to form a coalition government with An Saorstát Críostúil and to support the reformation of the Ulster Privileges under two conditions; Irish economic revitalisation must be prioritised, and any proposed alterations to the privileges or measures to distance the Irish Republic from Mitteleuropa would not be implemented without consulting and gaining the approval of the NDP prior.\n\nDe Valera, a conservative and politically savvy man by nature, knew as well as the NDP that, despite whatever he might imply during an election campaign, simply abolishing the Ulster Privileges or leaving Mitteleuropa the next day would wreak havoc in the country, and that a cautious approach to these delicate and tricky issues was necessary to ensure financial and political stability. As such, he readily agreed to these terms.\n\nThe announcement of the new administration has permeated its way through Irish society. The Church and faithful voters are pleased to see the secular-leaning Sinn Féin kicked out, in favour of a party based on Christian principles. Big farmers and some businessmen hope that the NDP will rein SC's anti-Mitteleuropa tendencies in, although other less-established entrepreneurs perceive opportunities in a potential decrease in foreign competition on the Irish market. In Ulster, Catholics have greeted the results with optimism and Protestants with concern, but both remember Brugha's failure to change the state of affairs in the north, to the anxiety of the former and the reassurance of the latter."
 ireland.34.d2:9 "With the National Development Party refusing to budge on the Ulster Privileges, Éamon de Valera became reluctantly convinced of the necessity to form a coalition with Aontas Náisiúnta. Eoin O'Duffy, keen to legitimise his party in the mainstream and regain his position as a major figure in the running of the country, eagerly opened negotiations, though neither men particularly trusted the other. In exchange for AN's support, de Valera agreed that a commission on corporatist economic policies would be established and an uncompromising line on Ulster taken, aiming for the ultimate abolition of the privileges.\n\nAlthough both believed membership of Mitteleuropa to have negative ramifications for Irish sovereignty, the two leaders concluded that a slow and steady approach was necessary to loosen ties with the bloc without worsening the financial crisis.\n\nThe announcement of the new administration has permeated its way through Irish society. Hardline nationalists and anti-syndicalists are delighted by the result, hoping that SC and AN will restore order and stability to the nation, as are the Church and faithful voters at seeing a government based on Christian principles, after years of Sinn Féin's quasi-secularism. In Ulster, a visible sense of hope is felt on the streets and in the homes of Catholic areas, concerns about Brugha's previous failure to change the Ulster Privileges dampened by the expectation that AN should ensure \"Dev\" keeps his word. The mood among Protestants is quite the contrary, their seething discontent with Dublin only intensening, to the deep concern of local Gardaí who have already begun to pick up rumours in the wind of radical loyalists beginning to stockpile weapons."

Malgré cela, le danger semblait bel et bien écarté. Les positions ministérielles avaient été convenues par les deux partis, et il semblait qu'An Saorstát Críostúil était de nouveau au gouvernement après une demi-décennie dans l'opposition.\nCe faux sentiment de sécurité ne devait pourtant pas durer. Ce n'était qu'une question de jours avant que les pires craintes de de Valera ne se réalisent, car la nouvelle des conditions dans lesquelles la coalition SC-NDP avait été établie a été divulguée à la presse par un haut responsable anonyme du SC, indigné par la concession.\n\nLa réaction de toutes les couches du public irlandais au scandale fut tout simplement un véritable pandémonium. L'étoile montante d'Aontas Náisiúnta monte à présent en flèche, et nombreux sont ceux qui se tournent vers des solutions radicales pour désigner un autre gouvernement irlandais démocratique, le premier se révélant incapable ou peu disposé à résoudre la plaie de longue date des privilèges d'Ulster.\nEt ainsi, les députés d'arrière-ban du SC, les TD locaux et les branches du parti n'ont pas tardé à bombarder leurs dirigeants de lettres et de questions furieuses. Pire encore, ce sentiment s'est répandu comme une traînée de poudre au sein de la Gardaí et l'armée, mais également au sein de l'Église catholique, auparavant l'allié clé de la SC pour gagner la faveur populaire. On vit même les prêtres et les évêques de tout le pays dénoncer la nouvelle administration au motif qu'elle avait une fois de plus abandonné les fidèles d'Ulster.\n\nIl est à présent clair qu’Éamon de Valera a signé son arrêt de mort politique et qu’une seule question reste sans réponse."

Il s'agissait seulement de savoir qui porterait le coup de grâce. La révolte a commencé, comme si souvent dans l'histoire irlandaise, en Ulster, alors que les chemises bleues sous la direction de Gearóid Ó Cuinneagáin se rassemblaient dans les zones catholiques de toute la province. Ce dernier, dans un discours réunissant des dizaines de milliers de personnes, a déclaré son intention de marcher sur Dublin pour exiger la démission du gouvernement en place, en faveur d'un cabinet composé de « vrais Gaëls », tout en affirmant que son rassemblement n'était que pacifique, ce que personne n'a vraiment cru.\n\nLe lendemain, partout en Irlande, des Chemises bleues, inspirées par ses paroles, ont marché sur les bâtiments municipaux locaux, avant de se diriger vers la capitale à pied ou en train. Malgré l'interdiction du gouvernement, leurs appels désespérés à la Gardaí et à l'armée sont restés sans réponse, les deux forces mécontentes aidant tacitement les insurgés par leur inaction. Alors que les manifestants suivant Ó Cuinneagáin arrivaient à Dublin, Eoin O'Duffy lui-même les rejoignit, tentant de reprendre le contrôle de son mouvement après avoir été pris au dépourvu par la décision audacieuse du premier.\n\nLes hommes vêtus d'uniformes azur et de brassards noirs brodés du lys de Pâques, couronne funéraire de la démocratie irlandaise et symbole de sa mort comme que de sa résurrection, ont suscité diverses réactions de la part des citoyens de Dublin, allant des acclamations des partisans à des regards effrayants et des tentatives vaines de la part des adversaires pour les arrêter.\n\nDe Valera tenait une réunion d'urgence lorsque la Garde nationale fit finalement irruption dans la salle. Il fut accusé d'avoir laissé tomber le peuple irlandais en permettant aux loyalistes de dicter l'avenir de la nation, et on lui intima l'ordre de démissionner pour permettre à une nouvelle administration de stabiliser l'Irlande, en lui promettant une peine plus légère s'il s'y conformait. N'ayant guère de choix, de Valera signa le papier qu'on lui présentait, conscient qu'il ne faisait qu'officialiser quelque chose déjà en cours. Dans l'heure, O'Duffy serait assis sur sa chaise, donnant l'ordre de commencer à sécuriser la ville et de se préparer à toute réaction négative potentielle."

Les travaillistes et leur allié rural Clann na Talmhan ont également obtenu des résultats records aux élections législatives alors que les électeurs irlandais se sont tournés vers le changement proposé par les deux partis après un an de crise économique. Malheureusement, malgré cette avancée impressionnante, leur total actuel de sièges au Dáil reste insuffisant pour former un gouvernement majoritaire, et pour y parvenir, il faudra conclure une coalition avec le Parti du Développement National ou le Parti Travailliste Progressiste.\n\nCette bifurcation a laissé la direction du parti travailliste en désaccord. Le PLP a été formé pour fournir une alternative radicale au Parti Travailliste après qu'O'Brien en ait expulsé son chef, Owen Sheehy-Skeffington, ce qui n'a pas manqué d'entretenir de nombreuses tensions entre les partis. Le leader travailliste, aux côtés d'éléments pragmatiques du Parti travailliste tels que Thomas J. O'Connell et James Everett, est favorable à une coalition avec le NPD, estimant que le soutien de Lemass neutraliserait les fréquentes attaques lancées contre le Parti travailliste par les opposants, et que le PLP ne peut pas être sûr de ne pas promouvoir un programme inacceptablement extrême.\n\nD’autres personnalités travaillistes éminentes, dont William Norton et Richard Corish, ont préconisé d’enterrer la hache de guerre avec Sheehy-Skeffington. Norton a rencontré O'Brien en privé, tentant de le persuader que les allégations selon lesquelles le PLP serait un cheval de Troie syndicaliste sont simplement alarmistes et qu'une alliance avec le parti est la seule chance que le parti travailliste aura de montrer au peuple irlandais qu'il peut apporter de véritables résultats. réforme, car le NPD obligerait très probablement les travaillistes à édulcorer même les programmes modérés et intermédiaires en échange de leur soutien.

C'est la raison pour laquelle le PLP a placé ce point clé au coeur de son programme. L’établissement d’un compromis sur cette question s’avérera donc essentiel au succès des pourparlers de coalition. Avec le soutien du chef du parti Owen Sheehy-Skeffington, le jeune DT prometteur du PLP et étudiant en médecine, Noël Browne, a proposé un projet qui introduirait des soins prénatals et postnatals gratuits pour les mères et un traitement gratuit pour les enfants jusqu'à l'âge de seize ans, inspiré par les propositions des partis sociaux-démocrates d'Europe continentale, notamment scandinaves.\n\nCependant, O'Brien et d'autres personnalités travaillistes craignent que le plan de Browne ne soit trop radical et risque non seulement de condamner les médecins irlandais opposés à la perte de bénéfices, et la hiérarchie de l'Église contre les soins familiaux non conformes aux enseignements catholiques, mais aussi de saper la gouvernement en jouant sur les craintes, plus fortes que jamais quelques mois après l’incident de LÉ Macha, selon lesquelles le PLP serait un parti crypto-syndicaliste.

It was agreed that Seán Lemass would be granted the post of Príomh Aire, or Prime Minister, in the coalition government, and although Michael Donnellan grumbled at this development and the prospect of concessions being made to Ireland's ranchers, moderate elements of his party were satisfied, though keeping both parties satisfied may prove a tricky task for O'Brien.\n\nIreland's lower classes are jubilant at the change of leadership, having borne the harshest consequences of Black Monday, and hopeful that the new government will prioritise the needs of the Irish people over numbers on a graph. Businessmen and big farmers worry about the possible economic and social repercussions of Labour and CnaT heading up the nation, but are somewhat reassured that the presence of the NDP in the cabinet should keep any radicals in check\n\nThe response among Catholics in Ulster has been generally positive in light of O'Brien's electoral pledges to address discrimination against Catholics, though many remain skeptical of his leftist politics and find his beliefs that Catholics and Protestants should overcome their differences through uniting as workers naive and out of touch. Upper and middle-class Protestants are concerned the result could lead to an upsurge in union activity but consider a Labour administration the lesser of two evils, breathing a sigh of relief that it isn't An Saorstát Críostúil, or worse, Aontas Náisiúnta, at the helm instead."

Thus, they concluded the construction of new hospitals and improvement of existing ones would still benefit the Irish people and lay down the framework for more fundamental changes in the future.\n\nThe announcement of the coalition has divided the country. Ireland's lower classes are jubilant at the change of leadership, having borne the harshest consequences of Black Monday, as are progressive feminists, intellectuals and students, seeing in the election's outcome the dawn of the forward-thinking nation they hoped freedom would bring about.\n\nOn the other hand, businessmen, big farmers, conservatives and the Catholic Church are all united by a sense of deep concern regarding the economic and social repercussions of the left-wing's meteoric rise, ensuring Labour will have a difficult time balancing the needs of their partners, the PLP already begrudging CnaT leader Michael Donnellan's nomination as Príomh Aire, or Prime Minister, due to his antisemitism, while not alarming the right.\n\nThe response among Catholics in Ulster has been generally positive in light of O'Brien's electoral pledges to address discrimination against Catholics, though many remain skeptical of his leftist politics and find his beliefs that Catholics and Protestants should overcome their differences through uniting as workers naive and out of touch.

Alarmé par les plaintes de l'association, MacRory en est arrivé à la conclusion que les négociations n'étaient qu'une tactique dilatoire et que le gouvernement n'avait pas vraiment l'intention de l'écouter.\n\nDevant la presse et en chaire, la hiérarchie de l'Église a fermement dénoncé le projet Mère-Enfant et l'administration travailliste, les qualifiant, comme elle l'avait craint auparavant, d'agents syndicalistes à la solde de l' Union-Britannique . Même si certains sympathisaient avec les objectifs du gouvernement, ces voix se sont rapidement tues par crainte de représailles sociales, face à une nouvelle peur rouge qui se dessine rapidement. Seulement une semaine après que les rêves d'un changement radical en Irlande semblaient pouvoir se réaliser, cet espoir a été piétiné par le conservatisme de la société irlandaise."

 ireland.41.d:9 "Du fait de folles rumeurs d’infiltration britannique attisées avec enthousiasme par l’opposition et l’Église, le peuple irlandais cherchait un sauveur pour le guider en cette une période de crise fabriquée de toute pièce et en trouverait un en Gearóid Ó Cuinneagáin et ses partisans extrémistes des Chemises Bleues. Attirant l'attention du public avec des brochures de propagande produites à la tonne, toutes portant un seul appel à l'action, "Aux armes maintenant, pour sauver l'Irlande du syndicalisme", Ó Cuinneagáin a annoncé lors d'un rassemblement auquel ont assisté des dizaines de milliers de personnes son intention de marcher sur Dublin pour "Chasser les syndicalistes de notre île comme Saint Patrick a fait des serpents", une déclaration accueillie par la foule par une explosion d'acclamations et d'applaudissements.\n\nLe lendemain, partout en Irlande, des Chemises Bleues, inspirées par ses paroles, ont marché sur les bâtiments municipaux locaux, avant de se diriger à pied ou en train vers la capitale. Malgré l'interdiction du gouvernement, leurs appels désespérés à la Gardaí et à l'armée sont restés sans réponse, les éléments conservateurs des deux forces n'ayant aucune sympathie pour empêcher la chute du gouvernement travailliste. Au moment même où les manifestants suivant Ó Cuinneagáin arrivaient à Dublin, Eoin O'Duffy les rejoignit, pour tenter de reprendre le contrôle de son mouvement après avoir été pris au dépourvu par la décision audacieuse du premier. Les hommes vêtus d'uniformes azur et de brassards noirs brodés du lys de Pâques, couronne funéraire de la démocratie irlandaise, et symbole de sa mort autant que de sa résurrection, ont suscité diverses réactions de la part des citoyens de Dublin, allant des acclamations des partisans aux regards craintifs des autres et aux tentatives vaines de la part des adversaires pour les arrêter.\n\nWilliam O'Brien tenait une réunion d'urgence lorsque la Garde nationale a finalement fait irruption dans la pièce. Tenu sous la menace d'une arme, O'Brien a été accusé d'être un espion syndicaliste à la solde de l'Angleterre et placé en état d'arrestation pour espionnage et trahison. Ses ravisseurs lui ont ordonné d'écrire une lettre de démission et d'admettre ses actes présumés, en lui promettant une peine plus légère s'il s'y conformait, mais, dans un dernier acte de défi, il a refusé, avant d'être entraîné vers un sort incertain. A présent, O'Duffy est assis sur sa chaise, et donne l'ordre de commencer à sécuriser la ville et de se préparer à toute réaction négative potentielle."

Regardless of the predictions of political pundits, Mulcahy is now President, though his inauguration has intensified an already particularly unusual situation.\n\nOne of the quirks of Ireland's recent revolutionary period was the election of many military men to political office, before, during and shortly after the War of Independence, with most holding both roles simultaneously as a matter of course. As the army transitioned from a guerilla to a professional army, this has been less commonplace, with one notable exception.\n\nThere are not many who could call Mulcahy anything other than a moderate, but nonetheless, more than a few eyebrows have been raised at the thought of him remaining as the actual Head of State while holding an active role in the army, let alone leading soldiers directly. Similar questions had been mooted during his time as the Príomh Aire in the last government, where he had been very much following the President's lead.\n\nBut now in his boss's old seat, he will need to decide if it will be worth trying to juggle both responsibilities, whatever the backlash."

As such, no soldiers were mobilised when the Blueshirts marched, with all orders to the contrary ignored, and the army command were by-and-large ready to work with Aontas Náisiúnta in stabilising the country.\n\nThe first and loudest voice among the command decrying these actions was expectedly, former Príomh Aire Mulcahy. While the overthrowing of the elected government was underway, a detachment of Blueshirts arrested and imprisoned Mulcahy before any further dissent could be mustered. This also had the effect of silencing any other officers who may not have necessarily supported the coup, further solidifying the belief of many officers that accepting the new government would be for the greater good of the nation, in the long run.

Some officers have stated their loyalty to any form of Irish Republic or any independent Irish state, whereas others refuse to see a syndicalist state as any form of a \"true\" Republic, or even democratic in any form.\n\nThese views have had no choice but to come to the fore, as the new government is eager to sweep away all unwanted reactionary elements within the army's upper echelons, and retain those that are willing to still serve.

 ireland.42.d12:9 "The overthrowing of O'Duffy's dictatorship by the most radical and reactionary tendency from within his party, has had a dire effect on the leadership of the Irish Republican Army. The Aontas Náisiúnta regime had solidified its support by closely allying with the army, working with them to achieve their mutual aims, and making moves towards the gradual intertwining of the Blueshirt movement with the army itself. The violent removal of O'Duffy from power has shattered this dynamic, throwing the army into disarray and questioning its very existence.\n\nWell aware of Ó Cuinneagáin's desire for the restoration of a Gaelic monarchy, some officers have stated their loyalty to any form of independent Irish state, whereas others refuse to see anything but a Republic as being representative of the will of the Irish people. It was for a Republic that the men of 1916 gave up their lives, after all.\n\nSuch words would be among their last, as a swift and merciless purge was performed on officers deemed to have shown themselves to be likely disloyal to the new Ireland. Such members of the old army command were taken from their homes and shot in front of their families, imprisoned, or were simply \"disappeared\".\n\nOnce order and authority in the army command was restored, those remaining were willing to serve Ireland regardless of her leadership, and in whatever form she took, or at least were wise enough to say that they would.\n\nJoining the upper echelons of the army were a select few confidants with military experience that had already been close to Ó Cuinneagáin, and shared his radical views. They quickly began to integrate themselves into the army's command structure, and have readily kept a close watch on the loyalty of their fellow officers to the new regime."

 ireland.1000.d.IRE:9 "Though Black Monday brought much turmoil, it was cautiously hoped by the government that the crisis would remain the only major issue on their plate as the country recovered. Yet fate is rarely so kind. Yesterday at approximately 1127 hours, the Irish naval vessel LÉ Macha experienced a sudden collision from underneath, 58 miles off the coast of Waterford. As it turned out, she happened to collide with the RNS Thetis, belonging to the Union of Britain and situated outside of British territorial waters. Submerged in the sea, the submarine went unseen as the LÉ Macha sailed over it until, owing to the poor decision-making of the captain, the submarine surfaced, ramming the Macha.\n\nFortunately neither incurred serious damage, both vessels along with their crew being saved by a joint rescue effort organised by the Irish Naval Service and the British Navy. This bold cooperation has been heralded as the beginning of a possible warming in Anglo-Irish relations by advocates of a détente, albeit such sentiments stay firmly in the minority as the public and government alike anxiously question the purpose for which a British submarine trespassed in Irish territorial waters in the first place, hysteric tales of nefarious syndicalist plots already being churned out by the rumour mill.\n\nThese significant concerns are shared by the German Empire, who have strongly condemned the incident, the Reichskanzler making a speech in the Reichstag today denouncing syndicalist aggression, and the German minister to Dublin has promised us of the empire's continued backing should the Union of Britain attempt to expand their influence. However senior diplomats, although grateful for German support, have counselled caution, warning of the risk of sleepwalking into German vassaldom. In their view Irish national interests lie in steering a middle course between the two powers, reaping the benefits of friendship with both while ensuring that what's best for Ireland is not subordinated to the needs of the great powers."

Although rescue efforts ensured both boats were saved and no lives lost, British diplomats have proven to be exceptionally cagey as to the purpose of the vessel's trespassing.\n\nThe German Empire and the Irish Republic have enjoyed a strong friendship since the Weltkrieg, as Germany was among the first to recognise Irish independence and played a significant role in arming the Irish rebels against their British overlords, and while they remained associated with the British Empire after the Anglo-Irish Treaty, the British Revolution saw the establishment of substantial trade with the island country and their eventual entry into Mitteleuropa.

After discussions between the two, it was agreed that Hassell would issue a strongly-worded condemnation of the incident and assure that the "German sword and shield" would stand behind the Irish against syndicalist aggression, so as to deter the British from further transgressions, but that for now the German response would remain diplomatic."

In no nation is this more true than within Connolly's own home, the man having possessed the questionable fortune of not having lived to witness so many of his companions in arms seduced by the siren songs of bourgeois nationalism and German imperialist patronage, where the ramifications of Black Monday have resulted in the scales of capitalism increasingly falling from the eyes of the Irish proletariat.\n\nThe Revolutionary Exportation Directory has worked closely with our Irish comrades in Saor Éire for a decade to overthrow the Irish Government, though their endeavours thus far amounted to little in light of Irish society's conservative and Anglophobic attitudes. Seeing a fighting chance to spread socialist ideals and foment a potential worker's revolt in the crisis, Saor Éire have requested more assistance. Accordingly, we sent three agents to assess the situation on the ground and rendezvous with SÉ's paramilitary wing, the Irish Citizen Army, coming ashore in Castletownshend, County Cork from the submarine RNS Thetis. Unfortunately during the process of their return voyage, our vessel accidentally rammed an Irish naval ship, the LÉ Macha, at around 1127 hours.\n\nWhile we can breathe a sigh of relief that the incident occurred after the insertion of our operatives, narrowly dodging a further breakdown in diplomacy with the Irish Republic, the collision took place in Irish territorial waters, raising great suspicion and drawing the alarm of the German Empire. These unfortunate events do contain a silver lining however, as successful joint rescue efforts by the British and Irish navies prevented any casualties or the loss of either vessels, earning the cautious praise of some liberal Irish newspapers and opening up a possible pathway to a rekindling of Anglo-Irish relations now that Black Monday has proven the Teutonic giant to have feet made of clay."

Reorganised into the Irish Republican Army following the Rising's failure, the IRA fought once more against Britain during the War of Independence, winning Irish freedom after 700 years with invaluable German assistance. As a result of this cooperation and many among their ranks being sent to Germany to learn from the force that had won the Weltkrieg in the decade afterwards, the IRA has become a bastion of Germanophilic sentiments.\n\nSuspicious of politicians and displeased with the concessions granted to loyalists, the IRA has resisted attempts by civilian administrations to assert authority over the army, with the soldiery often united more by a feeling of allegiance to their commanders and the abstract idea of the Irish nation than to the state.

From the former general's perspective, the issue is domestic, the result of a lack of discipline among the Irish people and demanding the expansion of the Gardai to maintain order, with Protestants to be kept under close watch given their believed inherent disloyalty.\n\nFor Ó Cuinneagáin, the source of the regime's troubles lies abroad with the sinister force of \"Anglo-Syndicalism\" plotting to subvert the Irish nation, and to combat the Red threat a secret police must be established and granted extensive powers to root out via any means, including torture, those traitors willing to take the Saxon shilling.

However, opponents of this latest proposition have pointed to the deep roots imperial measurements have within the minds of the Irish people, being extensively used in everyday activities for much of the public such as pubs, horse racing and on roads among other things, and the difficulty of updating the country to the metric system, a process which could take numerous years.

With pressure mounting but the NDP remaining committed to not provoking loyalist outrage, the coalition proposed a conference with the NLCL, the UDP and Catholic, Anglican and Presbyterian religious leaders in hopes of working out a compromise.\n\nWhile all participants agreed to meet, and despite arguing with delegates that if Ireland's religious denominations couldn't work together, the result would be no denominations under syndicalist rule, the negotiations ultimately devolved into sectarian tirades from UDP represenatives and Catholic Archbishop Joseph MacRory, concluding in failure and becoming yet another setback for de Valera."

However, one of their coalition partners, the National Development Party, popular with the upper class, is reluctant to agree to Labour's proposals for laws against discrimination in hiring, fearful of alienating businessmen.\n\nNonetheless, perceiving that the protest marches stand in the way of Ireland's economy recovery, the NDP agreed with Labour and Clann na Talmhan on the establishment of a council between trade unions and business owners to arrive at a compromise.

To appease Protestants in the bill's wake and lead them away from the lure of militant loyalism, the Labour Party has sought to crack down on the Blueshirts.\n\nUnfortunately, because of Catholic community protection and sympathetic Gardaí, these endeavours have largely failed.

One of these customs, the burning of an effigy of the traitor Robert Lundy, has traditionally occurred in an area overlooking the Catholic Bogside neighbourhood. This has led to much resentment being felt by its residents, who regard the commemoration as triumphalist and its purpose to be asserting Protestant supremacy,"
 ireland.1021.d1:9 "$ireland.1021.d.start$ a grievance which would ultimately come to a head in the present.\n\nAccounts differ on who lit the initial sparks, some say Protestants standing atop the Derry Walls began pelting the Catholic Bogside below with projectiles and locals fired back, others claim the marchers found themselves under assault from a hail of stones and nails from the Blueshirts and enraged Catholics as the parade approached the pillar. Either way, this incident sparked a vicious days-long riot as Protestant rioters pushed into the Bogside, wrecking Catholic homes, only to be beaten back by an odd alliance of Blueshirt and ICA defenders.\n\nWith order among the northern Gardaí collapsing as the majority take the side of their own communities over enforcing the law, riots have spread throughout Ulster from Belfast to Dungannon, all seeing heavy paramilitary involvement, catching the government entirely off guard, and fears are rapidly rising that the state has lost total control of the province and a repeat of the odious Belfast pogroms of the 1920s may be in the offing."

With the army being deployed to prevent the marchers from reaching the pillar on which the effigy was to be burned, stones and shouts of \"Go on home, Irish soldiers\" were hurled by the angered crowed, and, under pressure the soldiers opened fire, killing several and wounding more.\n\nThis incident has quickly acquired the name \"Bloody Saturday\", and has unleashed a torrent of horror and outrage. Radical loyalists have announced the reformation of the Ulster Volunteer Force, and sworn to fight \"Papist tyranny\" through whatever means neccessary, and barricades have been set up blocking off Protestant districts from state control throughout the province.\n\nIn the matter of a day, the stability promised by O'Duffy's regime has been thrown into jeopardy."

 ireland.1050.d1.demsstart:9 "In the aftermath of the reclamation of the no-go areas, the Irish Republican Army was left to police the north, the six county region set to remain under occupation until tensions had died down and the northern Gardaí had been reconstructed after its collapse on sectarian lines. While a military presence had been deemed essential to deal with the continued threat of radicals, its continuation became increasingly unpopular as the month dragged on. Outrage from loyalists accusing the armed forces of bias had not endeared Protestants to their patrols, while pro-integralist Blueshirts also denounced the army as traitors and attempted to stir up trouble between them and local Catholics.\n\nWith the government fearing that prolonging the deployment of Irish soldiers could risk once more heating up the anger that they had worked so hard to cool, the decision was made to bring the period of martial law to an end."
 ireland.1050.d11.IRE:9 "$ireland.1050.d1.demsstart$ Among the military, this move was not received well by the officers, many of whom were dissatisfied with the administration, and some feared a potential coup d'etat. Fortunately in spite of some grumbling, no such event came to pass, with the Gardaí soon returning on the streets of Ulster as the province seemed to have returned to some form of normality, at least by northern standards.\n\nDespite this apparent calm, everyone had taken the point from the crisis. The status quo was untenable and this peace would not last without serious reform. Calls for adjustments to the Constitution of 1922 had existed since the north had been reincorporated into the nation and, in the eyes of reformers, the Ulster Privileges' problems were the result of the government awkwardly welding the reunified province onto the existing state. After so much upheaval, the cabinet had come to agree. Not only would reforms to the situation of Catholics be necessary to unify the Irish people, but additionally a total rethink of how the Irish Republic was to be structured, taking the wishes of all sections of the country into account."
 ireland.1050.d1.anstart:9 "Just over a year ago, the Irish Government's calamitious failures had provoked its overthrow by Aontas Náisiúnta, vowing to bring order and a glorious future to the country. As the nation marked the coup's anniversary, that promise seemed false to all, with loyalist and syndicalist terrorism on the rise while infighting gripped the regime. No longer was this dispute confined within shadowy governmental circles, as both factions publicly denounced each other in propaganda and began to fight over the occupation of key strategic locations. Everyone could feel the same apprehension building from that momentous time twelve months prior.\n\nIt would be General O'Duffy, seeking to strike the first blow before he could be stricken, who would light the powderkeg by inviting several local National Guard commanders known to be sympathetic to Ó Cuinneagáin to a meeting in Dublin, only for them to be placed arrest upon arrival. For Ó Cuinneagáin and his followers, this would prove the final straw. Calling for a revolt against the \"traitor\" O'Duffy, the Blueshirts, mainly siding with Ó Cuinneagáin, rose up, capturing Dublin and other major Irish cities despite the resistance of the Gardaí, who had largely maintained their loyalty to their former Commissioner."
 ireland.1050.d12.IRE:9 "$ireland.1050.d1.anstart$\n\nWith O'Duffy held captive by the rebels, the situation appeared bleak for him. However, Ó Cuinneagáin's putsch would turn out to have a fatal failing, their failure to woo the military to their side. With the generals choosing to align with O'Duffy in spite of past disagreements, the army surrounded the cities under Blueshirt control, creating a siege situation not dissimilar from the fateful events of 1916. The rebellion would soon conclude a similar way, although with less bloodshed, as the Blueshirts were both reluctant to spill blood against the army and overwhelmed by their superior training and equipment. In the end, though Ó Cuinneagáin managed to successfully evade capture, going on the run, O'Duffy had emerged victorious over his enemies, both domestic and foreign."
 ireland.1050.d13.IRE:9 "$ireland.1050.d1.anstart$\n\nWith Dublin under the command of the rebels, O'Duffy was soon captured and branded with treason against the Gaelic race, his efforts having drastically backfired. And although the Old Guard had counted on the military standing with them in the event of a confrontation with the integralists, the generals, to their shock, would disappoint their expectations, throwing their lot in with Ó Cuinneagáin after becoming disenchanted with O'Duffy over the preceding year. As the Irish people were treated to the sight of Blueshirts and Irish soldiers marching and patrolling side by side, Ó Cuinneagáin proclaimed himself Ceannaire of Ireland atop the steps of the GPO in a speech that would be broadcast throughout the island. The Irish Republic had fallen in the same spot it had begun."
 ireland.1050.d14.IRE:9 "$ireland.1050.d1.anstart$\n\nThe uprising soon descended into chaos, as the Irish armed forces split into two, some generals opting to take O'Duffy's side while others assisted the rebelling Blueshirts. As his plans deteriorated, Ó Cuinneagáin in a panic ordered his men to have O'Duffy shot for treason in an attempt to demoralise the old guard, a move that would backfire by causing outrage among even his allies at the extrajudicial murder of a war hero. With a stalemate established and unbreakable without a civil war, covert meetings took place between the army, old guard and Ó Cuinneagáin's wavering supporters, resulting in an agreement being reached. Ó Cuinneagáin would be arrested for O'Duffy's death and John J. O'Kelly, a long-time republican and Gaelic revivalist, would be installed as a compromise candidate."

Establishing a cross-party commission with the goal of addressing discrimination in employment and housing, while working to better inter-community relations, Collins, the Irish Republic's guiding light as Wolfe Tone before him, has sworn to fulfill the United Irishmen's dream of substituting the common name of Irishman in place of religious denominations, and finally bring unity to the Irish people."

Though the persisting presence of gerrymandering continues to be a source of resentment, Mulcahy's promises to work with the NLCL and his UDP partners to achieve improvements in housing and employment has succeeded in serving as a salve against radicalisation, while monetary compensation for loyalists shall serve to smooth over the push for reform."

As such, with AN weakened from their radicals' defection, de Valera had a plan.

The process of rooting out Ó Cuinneagáin's supporters is already in motion, with all other anti-national elements, loyalists, syndicalists and West Britons alike, soon to share the same fate. As the vision of 1916 is fulfilled by the organisation of the Irish people into a unified whole, no longer divided by petty squabbles over political loyalties and class, Ireland shall prove itself worthy of the august destiny to which it is called."
 ireland.1051.d.goc:9 "Despite all the odds stacked against them, the boundless courage and determination of the Gael has emerged over their treacherous foes, domestic and foreign alike. The glorious reborn Irish kingdom's regent, Gearóid Ó Cuinneagáin, has already begun to consolidate his power, arresting and purging the Gaelic race's enemies. Most notable of these is of course the arch-traitor Eoin O'Duffy, who has been made to stand trial in a court consisting of true Irish patriots. While he was, as expected, charged with treason, investigations by secret police also uncovered rumours of the old general's homosexuality, of which was the government was quick to inform the Irish public.\n\nNow, nothing is capable of standing in the way of the resurrection of the golden age when Ireland was internationally renowned as a centre of religion and learning, while the European continent experienced what is often known as the Dark Ages. Under the new regime's enlightened rule, all traces of British defilement shall be eradicated, and after 700 years of Ireland's people and culture being suppressed and calumnied as backwards and savage, the revitalised Irish nation will finally take the rightful place among the nations of Europe and the world it was formerly denied by the Anglo-Saxon invaders."
 ireland.1051.d.jjok:9 "The regime has endured, if by a hair's breadth, the loss of its two leading lights, with the internal election of John J. O'Kelly, his republicanism aligning him with the old guard, and his Gaelic revivalism endearing him to the new. Despite this, it could not be stated enough the damage that the preceding turmoil had done to the government's image in the eyes of the Irish people. They had justified the dissolution of overthrow of the prior administration in the name of stability, but had failed to deliver.\n\nA compromise was necessary for AN to remain in power in the long-term, and so, in light of the previous cooperation of many SC TDs, O'Kelly met with their [IRE_loc_dev_imprisoned]leader, Éamon de Valera, to reach an agreement. All persons associated with the opposition would be issued an amnesty, democracy would be nominally restored and SC TDs would be granted cabinet positions in exchange for his party's full support.\n\nWith the former Sinn Féin leaders in a coalition, they would continue to work tirelessly as they always had for good of the Irish Republic. However, no longer will Irish republicans be guided by the degenerate ideals of the French Revolution, which have caused so much harm to Europe. Rather, the classical republics of the Mediterranean shall be its source of inspiration, as Ireland prepares itself for a potential battle to the bitter end against the aforementioned revolution's monstrous heirs in London and Paris."

Although the conflict between the Jacobites and the Williamites in Ireland would continue for a year afterwards, ending with the bloody Battle of Aughrim, the defeat at the Boyne would cause James II flee the island for France.\n\nHe would never return, for which he was branded Séamus an Chaca or \"James the Shit\" by his Irish supporters, and for loyalists, this date became remembered as their most significant victory, marking their deliverance from fears of Catholic domination and for a time their ascendance to absolute power in Ireland, and is commemorated yearly with bonfires and marches in celebration."
 ireland.1200.d1:9 "$ireland.1200.d.intro$\n\nAs this year's anniversary rolled around, concerns that more violence was in the offing as had happened exactly one year prior quickly cropped up, potentially worse than before due to the hectic events of the Ulster Crisis. Fortunately however, owing to promises of constitutional reform along with the reformation of the northern Gardaí and security measures put in place in spite of some small-scale violence the possibility of any large-scale rioting was averted despite the efforts of the Blueshirts and the UVF to stir up conflict, rendering the year's Twelfth of July a relatively peaceful one."
 ireland.1200.d2:9 "$ireland.1200.d.intro$\n\nAs this year's anniversary rolled around, concerns that more violence was in the offing as had happened during the past year cropped up, however in spite of the efforts of the Blueshirts and the Ulster Volunteer Force to stir up conflict, the Irish Republican Army's strict enforcement of law and order on the province's streets ensured that matters remained under control despite some small-scale violence, despite hysterical accusations of repression from some and growing resentment, particularly among Protestants, to the military's continued imposition of martial law in the six counties."
 ireland.1200.d3:9 "$ireland.1200.d.intro$\n\nAs expected, the Twelfth of July has seen ethno-religious enmities intensified even further as another fiasco ensued when marches by the Orange Order through Catholic districts resulted in major rioting, while several acts of terrorism were committed by the Ulster Volunteer Force. Unfortunately, due to the slow response of security forces in the province, said riots quickly got out of control, resulting in the burning of many homes before the state could restore order, something which has led to concern among northern Catholics who feel that this government, like the ones before it, may not be living up to its obligations to protect its people."
 ireland.1200.d4:9 "$ireland.1200.d.intro$\n\nAs expected, the Twelfth of July has seen ethno-religious enmities intensified even further as the resentment of the Protestant community towards the nationalist regime now firmly in power in Dublin was hightened as attempts by the Orange Order to march through Catholic districts were driven back by the combined forces of the Gardaí and the Blueshirts, with accusations of copious brutality having been meted out in the process spreading, while several acts of terrorism were committed by the Ulster Volunteer Force."
 ireland.1200.d5:9 "$ireland.1200.d.intro$\n\nWhile the authorities have done their best to maintain order and avert any violence which could potentially break out, given the anger of loyalists towards the socialist government and the Irish Citizen Army's decision in some areas to prevent Orange Order marches from parading through Catholic districts in opposition to what they regard as a celebration of imperialism and in hopes of winning over local Catholics suspicious of socialism, these efforts have resulted in limited success as rioting between angered loyalists and ICA men along with several acts of terrorism by the UVF were reported by the day's end."

Though the large presence of security forces along with the reforms made in Ulster over the past years have ensured that the situation was kept under control in comparison to the events of the Ulster Crisis, it unfortunately remains clear that we have a long way to go before the ethno-religious divide can be fully mended and the six counties truly integrated as simply another part of the Irish nation."

Fortunately however, despite the greater than usual turnout from loyalist marchers, the large presence of security forces and the harsh regime imposed upon Ulster over the past years, while much resented by Protestants, have ensured through harsh discipline that the situation remained peaceful, giving hope that with the loyalists kept in their place, one day the six counties shall be fully integrated as simply another part of the Irish nation."

 ireland.1501.t:9 "The Returning Emigrants"
 ireland.1501.d.start:9 "Ever since England brought Ireland under their control, emigration became a common occurrence, as the Irish fled poverty and oppression under the English boot, initially to the Catholic powers of Europe, and then to the New World, particularly the United States of America, as the formers' stars fell and the latter's rose. As the Great Famine devastated the isle, leaving over a million dead and more than half again in exile, this trend was exacerbated, creating a culture of migration that resulted in the island's population continuing to decline decades after the event.\n\nOnly the British Revolution and a wave of instability in America would bring an end to this exodus, the main ports of call for Irish emigrants now appearing unattractive, in contrast to the modestly growing prosperity of the newly-independent republic. The powder keg of the failing American economy and rising political tensions has finally exploded, and for the second time in a century civil war has broken out in the United States, leading many Americans of Irish descent to seek to return to the homeland of their ancestors.\n\n"
 ireland.1501.d1:9 "$ireland.1501.d.start$The Irish Government is divided on its approach to this crisis. Some insist that Irish-Americans are still of our flesh-and-blood and that, having assisted Ireland in winning independence, \"we have a national duty to assist them in kind\", while other, more cynical, politicians and bureaucrats point out that due to our lack of resources, accepting a flood of refugees at the present moment may further destabilise a country already in the process of recovering from Black Monday."

 ireland.2000.d.GER1:9 "The Irish, while keeping full integration into our European Project at arm's length, have always kept close ties with previous German governments, with the doors of power largely remaining open for Irish diplomats. With the increasingly hostile global situation however, the Irish have begun to recognise that being a Reichspakt fellow-traveller is no longer sufficient protection.\n\nToday this tension culminated in the Irish Government approaching us, on their own accord, about becoming a full member of our military alliance. The question now is if we wish to accept them, or is their position next to Britain undefendable?"

However, despite doing so, they did remain members of Mitteleuropa, and as such many of their links with Germany remained during this time.\n\nAccess to their ports will always be useful, but the questions is if [GER.GetNameDef] wishes to reward those who stray from its path."

Irish men and women of every political persuasion remember well the good turns afforded our ancestors by that nation, from which the ancestor of the Irish people, Míl Espáine, or Milesius, is said to have originated.\n\nTime and again, when Hibernia bled, Hispania sought to allay her troubles. The most famous of these episodes was during Ireland's Nine Years War, when the Spanish assisted Hugh O'Neill and Hugh Roe O'Donnell's rebel confederation of Irish nobles against Elizabeth I of England with arms and a landing at Kinsale in County Cork. Sadly, Ireland's greatest opportunity to achieve its liberty would turn into one of its worst disasters, as the resulting siege and Battle of Kinsale would tragically end in a disastrous defeat, marking the end of Gaelic civilisation. In the two centuries following its aftermath, when much of the Gaelic aristocracy fled to the continental Europe, many would settle in the Spain, where the Irish in accordance with their Milesian heritage were legally treated as native Spaniards. The Irish integrated well and many Spaniards of Irish descent would come to play notable parts in the military and politics of their new homeland, such as the renowned supporter of Isabella II, Prime Minister and victor of the Battle of Tetuán, Leopoldo O'Donnell.\n\nIn light of that history, the ferocious Spanish passion that grips so many Irish should not be dismissed. \"Do something\", the ghosts of Ireland past wail, and the blood is thicker than water. Mainstream opinion favours the Kingdom of Spain, as maintaining stability against far-right and far-left extremism, however Aontas Náisiúnta, given their fervent religiosity and the connection of the party's extreme wing with Lusitanian integralism, have expressed their support for the Carlist cause, while syndicalists and radical left-wing republicans of course support the CNT-FAI.

To those across the nation sympathetic to the cause, they see the conflict as one familiar to the Irish, seeing it as Serbia's attempt to right the wrong of a partition of its people by a foreign imperialist power, and to ultimately unite their nation together under one banner regardless of religious or cultural differences foreign rule has brought to their lands.\n\nIt would be a mistake however to believe that this view is universal across Ireland, with a pro-Bulgarian viewpoint quickly proliferating across the nation for a multitude of reasons. Pro-German voices in the country would tend to support the Bulgarian cause, and others point out that Bulgaria also began its modern history through its own rebellion against imperialism. And, like those across the continent, there are many within the country who also view this conflict as a pointless effort that serves no purpose except to throw the Balkans into chaos.

Although they faced many issues integrating at first, they soon became a core part of American society and the Irish struggle would owe much to the efforts of Irish-Americans. A key turning point for this acceptance into the American nation was the American Civil War, where droves of Irishmen, including famed Irish revolutionaries, fought for the Union, and to a much lesser extent, the Confederacy.\n\nFor the second time in less than 75 years, no matter their colours, in each American trench Ireland's sons can be found.

Even beneath the boot or nigh-felled by English bullets, the Irish wavered not. When Hugh O'Neill was forced to seek exile in Europe during the Flight of the Earls, it was to Rome he journeyed, where he lived under the protection of the Papacy until his death, and during the Risorgimento more than a thousand Irishmen would travel to defend the Pope's lands, performing with distinction against the forces of Victor Emmanuel II.\n\nIrish relations with Italian nationalism, on the other hand, have been historically more strained. Many Irish opposed the notion of Italian unity due to the Pope's opposition, and the Italians' dependence on British backing for their aims led to clashes between Irish nationalists and the likes of Mazzini, with Douglas Hyde once rhetorically asking \"What did Mazzini say?\" while condemning the loss of the Irish language. Despite this, the republican ideals of Young Italy would nonetheless serve as a source of inspiration for Young Ireland and the Fenians, and years later during the War of Independence some radical elements of Italian society would profess their sympathies for the Irish struggle and assist the IRA in obtaining arms.\n\nWhile much has changed since that time, the people still look to Italy with a certain fondness. With war looming over the peninsula, the Irish are coming.

Perhaps the most well-known of them is Bernardo O'Higgins, the father of the Chilean nation, who valiantly took arms against the Spanish Crown and fought alongside José de San Martín until Chile was freed by the Army of the Andes.\n\nFor its part, Argentina counts Guillermo, or William, Brown among its heroes, a sailor from County Mayo who became the nation's first admiral, and beat impossible odds against superior Spaniard and Brazilian forces. These ties were only strengthened in the 19th century, when both nations received a significant portion of the Irishmen who left their homes in search of better fortunes.\n\nThe descent of the Southern Cone into a full-fledged war, not long after the start of the American Civil War, has seen another former haven for the Irish diaspora suddenly become a battleground.

At the time, this condition was presented by pro-Treatyites as a potential route towards reunification, but in the events that followed the British Revolution, the north rejoined the rest of the country and Ireland left the Entente with the collapse of the United Kingdom.\n\nIt will be difficult for the government to reconcile their new alignment with the low-level anglophobia present as an undercurrent in all levels of society, but time has passed, and the commonalities between Ireland and their new allies will be emphasised and brought to the fore. Loyalists are quietly pleased at the turn of events, as though the possibility of their rejoining the United Kingdom looks even more remote, the relationship with the old British establishment has been greatly strengthened, all the more in their interests due with their cultural and familial ties.\n\nThis new alliance marks the beginning of a new relationship of Ireland with not only its old neighbours, but with its history, and in the narrative of its nationhood."

Among these is a chance for considerable economic realignment, which has been described as potentially backtracking on the previous German-centric Mitteleuropa economic model.\n\nLeaving Mitteleuropa will not entirely cut off trade with the continent, but will certainly shift the focus of exports, and undeniably cause a short-term shock to the economy. However, Ireland's recovery from Black Monday, and the reforms that came from it, have led many to believe that this change will be not insurmountable.\n\nSuch a move would also do much to dispel the concerns perceived by some of the overly-involved German presence in Ireland, that was felt after the LÉ Macha Incident up until the time of the Ulster Crisis. And of course, by leaving the German-dominated Mitteleuropa, Ireland would also be free to join in any Entente-led economic cooperation."

Though the Irish public is angered at the return to war after peace had been seemingly established in Europe with the fall of syndicalism, the resulting outrage is aimed not at the integralist establishment but at Perfidious Albion, and official propaganda has presented this renewed conflict as the final chapter in the centuries-long civilisational struggle between the pious Gaels and the degenerate Anglo-Saxons.

Presented with these dangers, Michael Collins after becoming President made the decision to introduce a series of laws allowing harsh measures against any form of extremist activities including censorship, and repressive Offences against the State Acts giving the authorities extensive powers in the interest of ensuring law and order."

 ireland.2601.d:9 "The first question facing the drafters is of how the Republic is composed and how its governance shall function.\n\nThe first option, supported by SF, maintains a system similar to the current \"Ulster Privileges\", whereby the north-eastern county councils maintain greater autonomy, the President's Council of State has guaranteed loyalist representation, and loyalists have a permanent presence in cabinet in the form of the new official role of \"Minister for Ulster Affairs\". There is some apprehension with nationalists who wish to see change in the new Constitution rather than a status quo.\n\nThe UDP and NDP, however, are pushing even further, asking for full devolution for the north-eastern six counties codified into the Constitution.\n          - \"The north-eastern six counties of Ulster shall have the right to hold a devolved parliament with areas of competence as defined by law.\"\nThis would effectively turn those counties into an autonomous region, dominated by loyalists. There is fierce push-back from nationalists as they see this as akin to a return to partition, despite written assurances against open discrimination.\n\nOn the other side, AN, and interestingly the PLP, are pushing for a unitary Republic ruled directly from Dublin.\n          - \"The sole and exclusive power of making laws for the State is hereby vested in the Oireachtas: no other legislative authority has power to make laws for the State.\"\nThis, along with sections emphasising the primacy of Dáil Éireann in Dublin, would certainly go far to unifying the country, removing the autonomy exception for the councils in the north. The PLP wish to give more concessions to loyalists, but as a compromise, both parties have agreed to maintaining Brooke's position and a limited guarantee of representation in the Dáil.\n\nA novel approach, favoured by SC, is to have each Province hold its own regional assembly.\n          - \"Each of the four Provinces shall have the right to hold a federal assembly with areas of competence as prescribed by law.\"\nThis American-inspired approach is one that has not been considered before, but it could allow each Province to tackle regional problems more effectively, particularly tensions regarding local populations of nationalists and loyalists."

 ireland.2606.d1:9 "Bien que les titres nobiliaires en Irlande soient rares, de nombreux citoyens de la République détiennent encore ces titres ou sont sur le point d'en hériter. Certains loyalistes et riches propriétaires fonciers font tout un plat au sujet de leurs privilèges et craignent que leurs titres ne soient menacés, ce qui n'est pas une crainte totalement infondée. Une partie importante des hommes politiques souhaite éliminer complètement les derniers vestiges de l’Empire Britannique et promouvoir l’image d’une république moderne. Quel que soit le choix, seuls les loyalistes les plus fidèles souhaitent voir un système dans lequel ceux qui détiennent des titres bénéficient de privilèges et d’une représentation spéciaux.\n\nLa première option est simple : il n’existe aucun titre nobiliaire et aucun citoyen ne peut en accepter un. SC soutient cette proposition, mais cela provoquerait sans aucun doute une certaine colère parmi les pairs :\n          - "1. Les titres de noblesse ne sont pas conférés par l'Etat."\n          - "2. Aucun titre de noblesse ou d'honneur ne peut être accepté par aucun citoyen sans l'approbation préalable du gouvernement."\n\nLa deuxième option, soutenue par l'UDP, consiste à reconnaître les titres de citoyens existants :\n          - "L'Etat reconnaît tous les titres établis détenus par les citoyens"\n\nUne autre option consiste à ignorer les titres accordés par la Couronne britannique et à laisser l’État accorder ses propres titres. Un coup de pied dans les dents des loyalistes, que l'AN semble vouloir poursuivre :\n          - "L'Etat aura le pouvoir de conférer des décorations spéciales aux citoyens méritants."\n\nUn compromis proposé par SF consiste à inclure ces deux articles, à reconnaître les titres existants et à en permettre la création de nouveaux."

 ireland.2650.d.sfcollins:9 "There are moments in life which will cause even the most stoic individual to stop and fully consider the situation that has been presented to them. For Michael Collins, one of these moments came in the form of a question posed by one of the nation's many journalists; \"Mr. [IRE_loc_leader_title], countless across the nation look to you and the legacy you have thus far left as a source of inspiration, both for good and ill. When making the many vital decisions that you have for the nation, does the impact it will leave on future generations factor into your decision making?\"\n\nFor a man who has spent most of his life living in the moment, the idea of being remembered as the [IRE_loc_leader_title] instead of a heroic soldier or revolutionary martyr is one that has only recently begun to dawn on Collins. Before he even reached his twenties he had already begun the fight for the Irish cause, and so too would he continue even after both independence and reunification. Where he once bounced from house to house to fight the Tans, he would instead bounce between them on the campaign trail to beat Labour and an tSaorstáit. Barely hanging on during Black Monday, and soldiering through the Northern Crisis, he was still energised by the same fighting spirit the entire time.\n\nAnd yet, for the first time in Collins' adult life, his survival through everything that has been thrown at him has left him with nothing more to fight. With the opposition struggling to even threaten his position, poll numbers sitting constantly at comfortable levels, and the extremist elements of Irish society thoroughly rooted out, the realisation that this chapter has ended has begun to finally hit home for Collins. But with the fight of today ended, the new battle is for the world of tomorrow. Where Collins had to be a fighter, it is his hope that the same will not have to be true for the next generation of Ireland's leaders. If they do truly look up to Collins, he hopes that they look up to his role as a man of politics rather than a soldier of war.\n\nSo, after a moment of thought and reflection, Collins simply smiled and answered \"Indeed, it does.\""
 ireland.2650.d.sfmulcahy:9 "For most in Dublin, the quiet morning of [?global.date.GetDateStringNoHourLong] was no different than any other day of the year, save for the small crowd that had gathered outside of The Barracks at Arbour Hill. For it was at this location that a rather unassuming and lowkey speech to a crowd primarily composed of the local garrison was being held by none other than [IRE_loc_leader_title] Mulcahy, dressed in his army uniform that is instantly recognisable to almost all that have ever met him. While many leaders may wish for huge crowds to greet them, Mulcahy could wish for nothing better than a small crowd of his \"comrades in arms\" at the same barracks he had once oversaw.\n\n\"To many in the nation the army has often seemed to be as a thing apart and different from the people. Yet for all of our nation's free history, our army has been the people, it is the people and will be the people. Our green uniform does not make us less the people. It is a cloak of service, a curtailer of our weakness, and amplifier of our strength. When the tricolour first flew proudly high over Dublin Town, the free people of Ireland were not simply either soldiers or citizens, we were one and the same. It is on the foundation our great republic was built, and upon it that our nation has continued to prosper.\n\nWhen our national independence was first declared by Pádraig Pearse, the Proclamation not only set forth the rights of the Irish people but also made clear the vital role their military organisations serve in guaranteeing those rights. When I myself fought on that fateful day I was neither a soldier nor a citizen, as an Irishman I was both. And so to uphold the lasting legacy set forth by the forefathers of many of you in the room, and the contemporaries of those getting on in years like myself, it is my honour to declare that from this day forwards this fateful building will be known as Pearse Barracks, Dún an Phiarsaigh.\"\n\nAnd with that the speech ended, to a somewhat muted but respectful applause, the type of humble response that is all a man like Mulcahy truly wishes for in life."
 ireland.2650.d.sc:9 "Throughout his tenure Éamon de Valera has been no stranger to the radio, delivering regular speeches to the Irish people through it. While many of these speeches have quickly fallen out of the public consciousness, today's speech seems different. Whether it can be chalked up to An Saorstát Criostúil's cemented political dominance, de Valera's delivery, or simply just the speech's quality, few feel like they will ever forget these immortal words:\n\n\"The ideal Ireland that we would have, the Ireland that we dreamed of, would be the home of a people who valued material wealth only as a basis for right living, of a people who, satisfied with frugal comfort, devoted their leisure to the things of the spirit — a land whose countryside would be bright with cosy homesteads, whose fields and villages would be joyous with the sounds of industry, with the romping of sturdy children, the contest of athletic youths and the laughter of happy maidens, whose firesides would be forums for the wisdom of serene old age. The home, in short, of a people living the life that God desires that men should live.\n\nWith the tidings that make such an Ireland possible, St. Patrick came to our ancestors fifteen hundred years ago promising happiness here no less than happiness hereafter. It was the pursuit of such an Ireland that later made our country worthy to be called the island of saints and scholars. It was the idea of such an Ireland — happy, vigorous, spiritual — that fired the imagination of our poets; that made successive generations of patriotic men give their lives to win religious and political liberty; and that will urge men in our own and future generations to die, if need be, so that these liberties may be preserved.\n\nOne hundred years ago, the Young Irelanders, by holding up the vision of such an Ireland before the people, inspired and moved them spiritually as our people had hardly been moved since the Golden Age of Irish civilisation. Fifty years later, the founders of the Gaelic League similarly inspired and moved the people of their day. So, later, did the leaders of the Irish Volunteers, and those who continued their good fight until all of our nation had been freed. We of this time, if we have the will and active enthusiasm, have the opportunity to inspire and move our generation in like manner. We can do so by keeping this thought of a noble future for our country constantly before our eyes, ever seeking in action to bring that future into being, and ever remembering that it is for our nation as a whole that future must be sought.\""
 ireland.2650.d.labcnat:9 "With the hectic nature of everyday life, it is often hard for one to stop and simply take in the world around them. Even when granted the opportunity to, many may still scoff at the mundanity of such an act, instead preferring to focus on the matters they view as much more serious. Yet, as far as [IRE_loc_leader_title] [IRE_loc_leader_name] and much of the government are concerned, the heart of Ireland is found nested within the land itself, and to not sit back and reflect upon it is to overlook the fundamentals of Irish life.\n\nFor it is this great land that so many have proudly called their home across countless generations, from the most humble of villages in Leitrim all the way to the busy and bustling heart of Dublin itself. Regardless whether it is the farmer reaping his yearly harvest, an accountant enjoying nature on their commute to work, or even a young couple watching the sun set over Galway Bay, each of their lives are shaped by the bounties that Ireland provides to its people. And it is ultimately these bounties, and the moments of joy or satisfaction they provide, that truly make the moments that make life worth living.\n\nIt is to this end, the pursuit of ensuring these worldly fundamentals, that the government's vision has ultimately been derived. No longer does the Irish worker have to worry about working from the break of dawn to the darkest reaches of the night, with even now the ability to take substantial amounts of time off work to enjoy life with their families as all should have the right to do. Nor does the farmer have to fear waking up to a nation where the rustic way of life is no longer possible to live, instead he may be confident in the government's support for the rural Irish countryside. And even the most vulnerable in society, who may have once collapsed into a pit of destitution, may rest easy knowing that there is a welfare system ready to help pull them back up out of it.\n\nAnd above all, when everyone, no matter their status, can live a life without these everyday worries getting in the way, what is better to do than to take in the beauties of this island that truly makes us whole?"
 ireland.2650.d.labplp:9 "For those who limit their worldview to the simplistic idea that violence always begets violence; the idea that a nation such as Ireland, who emerged onto the world stage through armed revolution, could ever bring about meaningful change for its people through peaceful measures would have previously seemed completely outlandish. And yet now, under the leadership of [IRE_loc_leader_title] [IRE_loc_leader_name], a leftist coalition has not only achieved power through the ballot box, but has managed to cement itself in the hearts of the Irish people.  The Irish nation now marches towards a red future, yet it marches not with a rifle, but with an olive branch.\n\nTo even the more open minded, many of the events of the last few years would have still been equally hard to imagine. When the rift between O'Brien and Sheehy-Skeffington first led to Labour splitting in two, few could picture a future where these two men would be willing to put aside their differences and work together on anything, let alone being the ones leading Ireland towards such a future. Yet now after so many eventful years of this red coalition being in power, there are scarcely any who can still hold doubt towards the success of the reformist approach of both branches of Labour.\n\nOf course there are still the detractors, both those on the right who still believe that the \"radical regime\" will collapse at the next real hurdle, and many of those on the left who reject any notion that one can simply reform towards a socialist system without the backing of a revolution. However, regardless of their naysaying the voice of the Irish people is clear, it is not violent revolution or conservative stagnation that they desire but a gradual and peaceful transition forward. Ireland's future is not one stuck trying to harken back to a idealised past, it is a future filled with liberty and progress. And if Ireland's future shall truly be a red one, it will be achieved by a people armed not with a sword, but with a ploughshare and a dream."
 ireland.2650.d.ndp:9 "To most of the NDP members that make up much of the government, most notably even [IRE_loc_leader_title] [IRE_loc_leader_name] himself, if asked to describe their vision of Ireland in one word that word would be \"Opportunity\". It has been this word that has acted as an unofficial slogan for the party, and now by extension the government itself, ever since it saw the party rise to its first successes and achieve its original place in the coalition.\n\nFor such a simple word, the exact meaning of \"Opportunity\" varies greatly depending on who you ask and when you actually ask it. At times it has meant the opportunity for every man and woman in Ireland to achieve their dreams, simply provided they put in enough hard work to see them to fruition. At other times, especially when levied against the restrictions of the old Sinn Féin government, it has meant the opportunity for anyone in the country to make their mark upon the nation, regardless of their background or heritage. Even more recently however, with Ireland's increased prominence on the financial world stage, some have gone so far to even declare that it is the opportunity to leave your mark upon the world as a whole.\n\nIf you were to ask [IRE_loc_leader_surname] however, he would gladly tell you that the meaning of the term encompasses all of the above and more. For him, \"Opportunity\" is at the heart of Irish culture and history. Whether it has been as grand as the opportunity the Irish people carved out for themselves to decide their own fate and destiny, or even down to the simple individual level of good education providing a student the opportunity to get into Trinity, it arises in all facets of Irish life. In the eyes of the [IRE_loc_leader_title], social and economic progress in a nation go hand in hand with each other, with the opportunities provided in one allow the opening of more in the other, and it has always been the NDP's goal to facilitate the growth of both.\n\nAnd ultimately as far as [IRE_loc_leader_surname] is concerned, every aspect that makes up this concept of \"Opportunity\" are those that truly describe what it means to be Irish."
 ireland.2650.d.an:9 "While just a few short years ago the idea of an Aontas Náisiúnta government was seen as outlandish to most, the fear that one day Irish democracy could be completely swept away in a flash was one that still very much occupied a place in many a mind. Almost no one however, [IRE_loc_leader_surname] included, could have predicted that now with AN having at last consolidated their rule over the nation, Irish democracy has not only yet to breathe its last but has begun to stabilise once more under new leadership\n\nDespite great fearmongering by those in the opposition in regards to so called \"democratic backsliding\", when [IRE_loc_leader_name] directs the nation's policies he is not some supreme Ceannaire overseeing a National Council of loyal underlings, he is the nation's [IRE_loc_leader_title] addressing a Dáil still very much filled with many actual opposition members offering forth lively debate. Laws are not simply passed through diktat from on high, when the government puts forward a bill it is still subject to the same proper procedures and vetting that they always have under Ireland's democratic systems. While some within Aontas Náisiúnta are said to still privately hold disdain for being forced to deal with said systems, much of the party have slowly begun to grow rather comfortable with this new status quo.\n\nYet regardless one should not mistake the Dáli of today as being the same one it may have once been in yesteryear. Socialists, the most seditious democrats, and even some of the government's most radical former allies have rightfully been excised from government. No longer do the Irish people have to suffer a nation where their politics are decided by foreigners and Freemasons, rather than the native people of the land. No longer do they have to worry about the subversive threats of Internationalism and Syndicalism attempting to divide or break up the family. And no longer does the great Irish republic have to fear the chaos that these destructive elements may bring."

 ireland.3000.d:9 "After the chaos of the preceding few days, the inauguration of Eoin O'Duffy as President and the young upstart Gearóid Ó Cuinneagáin as Príomh Aire was a relatively smooth affair, in spite of the efforts of urban strikers and protestors, who met with harsh crackdowns from the authorities. Though the duo now sit atop a throne of the National Guard and Irish Republican Army's bayonets, the military have demanded a high price in exchange for their continued tacit backing of the regime. While the officer class generally share O'Duffy's dislike for the Ulster Privileges, they eye cautiously AN's anti-German economic stance, given their affinity with Berlin, and the extremism and thuggery common among the Blueshirts. As such, while they have offered AN their endorsement in lieu of the alternative, they have insisted that democracy remain \"unless circumstances should demand otherwise\", wary of the potential consequences of AN wielding absolute control over the country.\n\nResultingly, Aontas Náisiúnta remains dependent on other parties to hold a majority in the Dáil Éireann, an awkward structure held together via the endeavours of AN vice-president John J. O'Kelly, who, as one of the founders of Sinn Féin in 1906, has done wonders to convince opposition TDs, particularly within An Saorstát Criostúil, of the need to grant AN their support \"for the sake of national stability\". While O'Duffy's old guard are well pleased that the party at last wields the ability to sway the course of the Irish nation, Ó Cuinneagáin's faction, their half-hearted abstentionist beliefs hastily abandoned with his ascension to government, are less satisfied with the arrangement, noting the unlikelihood that the Dáil would approve their radical integralist agenda, and feeling insufficiently rewarded in spite of being primarily responsible for the prior administration's overthrow.\n\nBehind closed doors, the knives are swiftly being unsheathed, and it would seem that what is touted as the beginning of orderly and stable governance may prove to be anything but."

 ireland.3002.d:9 "Under pressure to nominally maintain the democratic process, Aontas Náisiúnta is currently dependent on cooperation from other political parties in the Dáil, particularly from members of An Saorstát Criostúil. Eoin O'Duffy's wing of the party are somewhat content with this situation, as in spite of its restrictions they still retain a degree of power through their control of the presidency, and the social programme of SC shares enough with their views for most to find common ground. However, Gearóid Ó Cuinneagáin and his followers are less satisfied, and have called on O'Duffy to dissolve the Dáil Éireann and call parliamentary elections.\n\nThey argue that circumstances have been altered dramatically since the last election, and the Irish people ought to have their say. Of course, the National Guard will be on hand to \"assist\" the populace in ensuring they make the correct choice and are not intimidated by \"agents of Anglo-Syndicalism\" into voting against the interests of the Irish nation.\n\nFor the President, yielding to this request comes with its upsides and downsides. On one hand, the return of a higher number of AN TDs would minimise the risk of attempts to enact legislation being stymied by objections from SC moderates. On the other hand, as Ó Cuinneagáin's radicalism finds its most fertile ideological soil among the angry young men of the Blueshirts, their efforts to \"persuade\" voters would likely be focused on constituencies where integralist TDs are running, granting Ó Cuinneagáin's faction a larger sway over Irish domestic policy."

 ireland.3003.t:9 "Privileges Unearned"
 ireland.3003.d:9 "Since Aontas Náisiúnta's foundation, the party's primary grievance and rallying cry has been the existence of the Ulster Privileges. During the British Revolution, O'Duffy was a chief detractor of the government's negotiation with Ulster loyalists on the incorporation of Northern Ireland into the Irish Republic, proposing instead to invade the province to forcibly reunify the island, protect the Catholic population, and prevent the establishment of a syndicalist outpost in Ireland.\n\nIn the following years, the ex-general remained a prominent opponent of the concessions that emerged from those negotiations, resulting in his dismissal as Garda Commissioner by his former friend Michael Collins, and the party subsequently formed by the betrayed and embittered O'Duffy becoming the vanguard of the northern Catholics who felt equally cast aside by their fellow countrymen.\n\nNow with AN in power, they have at last in their hands the opportunity to dispense with the loathed privileges. However, O'Duffy's cautious instincts have found themselves at odds with the bold Ó Cuinneagáin on how best to go about it. O'Duffy is of the belief that the Ulster Privileges should be slowly dismantled one by one in order to keep AN supporters contented, and at the same time minimise loyalist resistance while the regime is in the process of consolidating its control.\n\nÓ Cuinneagáin, by contrast, wishes for the Ulster Privileges to be immediately declared null and void, and his position has much support within the Blueshirts and the northern Catholic community. Although this audacious approach would mark the beginning of a new state and be greeted with elation among AN's northern followers, it would also lead to immediate outrage from loyalists, endangering the country's stability, though there is no doubt in governmental circles that a confrontation with loyalism is ultimately inevitable."

 ireland.3004.t:9 "Le Gean ar Ghaeil"
 ireland.3004.d:9 "When Aontas Náisiúnta was established, it brought together several fringe factions in Irish political life who found themselves unable to affect the course of the nation alone, from Eoin O'Duffy and his right-wing acolytes inside Sinn Féin who felt betrayed by Michael Collins' liberal direction, to far-right anti-treatyite remnants under John J. O'Kelly. However, from within AN, originating from dissident intellectuals and radical Blueshirts, arose another faction with militant views far exceeding those of the party's founders, coalescing around the charismatic Gearóid Ó Cuinneagáin.\n\nWhereas the vision of AN's old guard, dictatorial as it is, remains rooted in their belief to be the inheritors of the republican tradition which the men and women of 1916 had fought for, Ó Cuinneagáin and his followers aim for nothing less than the total resurrection of Gaelic Ireland, complete with the restriction of English and the restoration of the O'Neill family as not only a symbolic undoing of the Battle of Kinsale, but also a means by which the Irish language would regain its former prestige, becoming once again a tongue of kings and scholars, no longer stigmatised by associations of poverty and backwardness.\n\nAlthough republicanism has been deeply ingrained in Ireland since the Easter Rising, the ascendance of Ó Cuinneagáin to the position of Príomh Aire and his increased hold over the Blueshirts has given the new guard the perfect platform to promote their beliefs to the populace, and, in spite of the regime's campaign against German economic influence, the integralists have sought to utilise the Irish public's generally positive image of the Kaiser to remove the negative British association from the idea of monarchism. As O'Duffy and his supporters emphasise their connection to the legacy of 1916 in turn, an internal propaganda war has begun to be waged."

 ireland.3005.d:9 "For the past month, the Irish military, Blueshirts, Gardaí and secret services have found themselves stretched to their limits working to bring under control the surge of loyalist and syndicalist terrorism unleashed in the aftermath of the Bloody Saturday massacre. Beginning with riots in the streets of Ulster and no-go areas being established throughout Protestant districts of Belfast and Derry under the protection of the Ulster Volunteer Force, these incidents turned bloodier as the army was set in to dismantle the barricades and retake the rebelling Protestant neighbourhoods, with tens of people being killed in the process.\n\nFollowing the army's reoccupation, the UVF began a series of attacks on Irish security forces and bombings of businesses, buildings and often innocent civilians, assisted by the Irish Citizen Army, who although ideologically disagreeing with Ulster loyalists, were also keen to take advantage of the government's troubles and achieve their dream of a socialist Ireland.\n\nWith the junta's promises of stability torn asunder by this recent course of events, many both within and outside of the regime are looking for someone to blame, and the factional rivalries between the Old Guard and the New Guard have come to the fore yet again, as they both point the finger at the other for being the underlying cause of the country's problems. The former has denounced the violence of Ó Cuinneagáin's followers as causing the public to regard the administration not as bringers of order but instead as petty thugs, while the latter has mocked O'Duffy, branding him with the derogatory nickname \"O'Scruffy\", as a doddering drunkard who lacks the spine to adequately stamp out the Irish nation's enemies.\n\nWith civil servants, policemen, soldiers, and Blueshirts alike weighing up their options as the two factions continue to castigate each other for their failings, it remains to be seen which will take the fall in the eyes of the regime's functionaries."

 ireland.3006.d:9 "As the factional conflicts tearing apart the Aontas Náisiúnta regime from within escalate, the Blueshirts, having assumed the role of a national milita following the March on Dublin, have largely sided with Ó Cuinneagáin, intensifying their training and recruitment in the knowledge that it is only a matter of time before the old guard and the new come to blows. O'Duffy, too, is aware a final clash is in the offing, and in response he has sought to weaken the influence of the paramilitary organisation he once sponsored, seizing Blueshirt weapons caches and safehouses, further hightening tensions in the process. Both sides have, however, arrived at the realisation that the army, possessing the most manpower and weaponry in the country at their disposal, will ultimately play the part of kingmaker.\n\nThis fact is a setback for the integralist leader, as the ability to demonstrate a connection to Ireland's revolution is an important factor for the officers, and one which Ó Cuinneagáin lacks, having been only a child during the revolutionary period. Though the fact of his youth is not insurmountable given Michael Collins' relatively young age during the war, and Ó Cuinneagáin sharing the military's more Europhile tendencies, it represents a considerable obstacle to gaining their respect.\n\nSeeking to rectify this, Ó Cuinneagáin has reached out to multiple supporters of Aontas Náisiúnta with significant links to the past struggle in order to seek their endorsement. Most notable of these is Dan Breen, one of Ireland's most illustrious war heroes, in addition to several relatives of reknowned Irish martyrs, namely George Noble Plunkett, a Papal count and father of Joseph Plunkett, Kathleen Clarke, the widow of Tom Clarke and Nora Ashe, the sister of hunger striker Thomas Ashe. Should Ó Cuinneagáin be successful in persuading these high-profile men and women to grant him their backing, it would go a long way to winning the army's loyalty and undermining O'Duffy's position."

Fahey, who is based in Dublin, was already a prolific writer of books, pamphlets and letters, but now has also begun to write articles in various AN-aligned publications. Fahey is a fanatical believer in the idea that Jews are the Satan-like enemies of Christ and Syndicalism is their weapon against him. Fahey is also a total opponent of Liberalism, both socially and economically, and is enthralled by the concept of Integralism.\n\nAlthough Fahey is not a particularly high-ranking member of the clergy, it is always a boon to any political movement in Ireland to have visible supporters amongst the Priesthood, and AN have been keen to exploit the presence of Fahey amongst their ranks. This development, alongside Fahey's raging anti-Semitism, has been a cause of great discomfort amongst the Catholic hierarchy in Ireland, even hardline conservatives.\n\nFahey, fluent in French, German, and Italian and in contact with many Integralist groups on the continent, has been able to help provide somewhat of an intellectual underpinning to the Ó Cuinneagáin wing of AN. Almost all of Fahey's arguments inevitably accuse Jews of being the root problem, and in turn, Fahey's open and proud anti-Semitism has spread amongst the ranks of AN supporters.\n\nFor opponents of AN, the addition of Fahey is yet more evidence of their unhinged and conspiratorial ultra-Catholic zealotry."

O'Duffy now governs the Republic by decree, akin to the absolute monarchies of old. However, even in the modern age no man can truly rule alone, and as such he has made the decision to select a second-in-command to serve as his top advisor and potential successor. Two figures have emerged as the main contenders for the position, one coming from the party, and the other from those Blueshirts who have remained loyal to the general.\n\nThe first is John J. O'Kelly, the deputy leader of AN, who has played a key role in Irish politics for decades since Sinn Féin's establishment. A fervent Catholic and advocate for Ireland's native culture and language with many connections to other parties, he has proved essential in keeping the regime afloat through his able politicking. The other, Ned Cronin, is a former officer who left the military to co-found the National Guard, designing their iconic azure-shirted uniform. Though side-lined as their ranks fell sway to radicalism, through his loyalty during Ó Cuinneagáin's rebellion he managed to assert his control over the paramilitary in the aftermath.

 ireland.3315.t:9 "I Lár na Tíre"
 ireland.3315.d:9 "For centuries Ireland's biggest city has been Dublin, or Baile Átha Cliath in Irish, situated on the central-west coast of the island at the mouth of the River Liffey. Originating from two settlements, one the Gaelic settlement of Áth Cliath, from which its Irish name is derived, and the other the Viking settlement of Dyflin, it remained for long periods under Norse-Gael rule, but gradually came under the suzerainty of the Irish kings, and by the late 11th century was considered a de-facto Irish capital. Following the Anglo-Norman invasion in 1169, it became a stronghold of English and later British imperial control in Ireland, gaining the moniker \"The Pale\".\n\nThe negative association of this latter period has stuck around, both in jest and often in earnest, with many regarding the city as a hive of Anglophiles and feeling resentment towards its percieved economic and political dominance over the rest of the country, and with the integralists' top priority being the deanglicisation and decentralisation of the state, Ó Cuinneagáin has sought to move the capital to a location more worthy of being the beating heart of the nation.\n\nAccordingly, several plans were drawn up to achieve this. The first, promoted by AN's mainstream factions, would seek to develop Baile Átha Luain, or Athlone, a town in the very centre of the island, which began as a fort built by a former High King, into the national seat of government. The second, a more radical proposal from the young architect Daithí Ó hÁinle, advocated building a new city at the Hill of Tara. However, due to Ó hÁinle's youth, the stretched resources of the regime given their already ambitious schemes to modernise the country, and a desire by traditionalists to prevent the ancient heritage of Tara from being desecrated by urbanisation, the moderates' plan won out. Baile Átha Luain would be the capital of the resurrected Irish kingdom, uniting the four provinces of the Emerald Isle."

Although previous administrations had paid lip service to the native tongue of the Gael, they went little further than that, and Ó Cuinneagáin is determined to change this to ensure the return of Ireland's distinct culture to its former glory. Already the government has commenced measures gaelicising the names of all citizens, place names and streets on the island, overhauling teaching, and promoting the language in media and the military.\n\nNonetheless, Irish faces stiff competition with the dominance of English and the rising lingua franca of German, and so, noting that English was forced on the Irish people through coercion, and that the same is needed if Irish is to be revived, the government has introduced incentives and positive discrimination to reward those who demonstrate fluency in the language, while penalising those who refuse to acquire it. This is only the beginning of the regime's plans, and long-terms have been drawn up that would see all official business transitioning purely to Irish, the removal over time of all civil servants still not fluent, and even an eventual ban on using English in public altogether.\n\nWhile effective in motivating learning among AN's diehard followers who have begun to form a new elite, these decrees have been met with protests by many members of the populace. However, Ó Cuinneagáin has no intention whatsoever of backing down under any circumstances, redoubling on his propaganda efforts encouraging the citizenry to learn the language and taking advantage of the red scare to brand those opposed to the strict revival programme as West Britons and syndicalists. Though it may take much effort, in time it will pay off, as Ireland shall once again be able to stand with pride alongside its brothers in the family of European nations, no longer a country without a soul."

 ireland.3317.d:9 "For as long as the Gaels have existed, so has migration. The very forefathers of the Gaelic race originated from Iberia, and Hibernian monks carried out their holy endeavours across Europe at the height of Irish civilisation. After the English conquest, many nobles and commoners alike sought refuge on the continent during the 16th and 17th centuries. But it was the so-called famine of the 1840s that did the most damage, halving the Irish population through a combination of mass death and exile, and creating a culture of emigration that would see the island's demographics unremittingly decrease for nearly a century afterwards.\n\nIt would take the improvement of Ireland's economic situation following the nation's entry into Mitteleuropa, and the fall of America and Britain into chaos and revolution respectively to bring this lengthy decline to an end, though some would continue to emigrate to the likes of Canada and Germany. The flow of people leaving the isle would lessen further during Black Monday, due to the global nature of the crisis. However, as a result of dissatisfaction with the integralist government and recovering financial circumstances elsewhere, Ireland now faces another wave of emigrants.\n\nÓ Cuinneagáin has denounced such exiles as "péistí", meaning "worms" in English, accusing them of deserting their native land and harbouring syndicalist sympathies. Acting to stem the tide of migrants, the coast guard has been placed on patrol to halt any illegal rafts fleeing the island, and a series of harsh decrees proclaimed requiring Irish citizens to seek approval from the state before departing from the country or returning from abroad. Said permission is only to be granted under stringent conditions, and a severe sentence is to be imposed for unauthorised travel. Through these decisive measures, the authorities hope to prevent a brain drain and ensure that Irish demographics will soon rise back to their pre-famine heights."

Not only has a lack of opportunities at home for the unemployed, with no ability to seek employment abroad, resulted in a reported rise of antisocial behaviour, but cases of protest, sabotage and even murder by opponents of the regime are additionally on the upswing, in spite of the special powers afforded to the Gardaí and secret services to firmly clamp down on such traitorous activities. Worse yet, occasionally those attempting to flee the island have resorted to seeking refuge in the embassies of other European nations, harming Irish international relations by bringing foreign attention to government repression.\n\nWishing to contain the situation and avoid further destabilisation, Ó Cuinneagáin has reluctantly made the decision, after much heated debate with his cabinet, to compromise on his harsh decrees restricting migration by loosening the requirements, while making sure the state would still retain the power to decide who specifically they wished to permit to leave. This would allow for the explusion of social undesirables via boatlift to Great Britain or continental Europe, reducing crime and political opposition, while continuing to limit leaving for the more valuable members of the nation, ensuring that a brain drain or another decline in Irish demographics is averted. Nonetheless, this undeniably represents a setback for the administration and its ambition of raising Ireland's population back to its pre-famine heights."

Many of the loudest voices calling for a restoration of the games come from within the party, and Ó Cuinneagáin himself is highly sympathetic to the idea. Rather than just restore the games, however, Ó Cuinneagáin wishes to pursue the thorough restructuring of Irish sport.\n\nFrom henceforth, all imported degenerate sports, or \"Garrison Games\" (so not just \"soccer\", but also rugby and cricket) are to be banned, to allow the increased thriving of Gaelic games of all kinds. As well as this, the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) will be expanded in scope, with a formal event finalising these changes to be held in the coming weeks."

His models for an independent Brittany include the revolutionary zeal of the Irish and the discipline of Prussian militarism, and so he regards Ó Cuinneagáin's integralist administration highly for managing to combine both in his eyes.\n\nAlthough a few are somewhat hesitant to accept this offer given the potential implications for relations with the French government-in-exile and the long history of positive Franco-Irish bonds, even if the two nations found themselves on opposite sides of the Weltkrieg, the majority are more than happy to welcome the assistance of a fellow Celtic patriot."

Although the IRA had sided with Ó Cuinneagáin, to them O'Duffy was still held in high esteem as a war hero, even if they had come agree that he was not fit for government. To immediately execute O'Duffy would turn the Ceannaire's military backers against him. It was fortunate that rumours of sodomy came up as they readied for his trial, with investigators not only finding proof of O'Duffy attending the notorious parties of Micheál Mac Liammóir and Hilton Edwards (a known homophilic couple) but also uncovering several men prepared to testify that the general had made sexual advances towards them.\n\nThe key witness was Mac Liammóir (born Alfred Willmore in London, before assuming an Irish identity) who was taken into questioning and threatened with the death penalty. If Mac Liammóir and Edwards did not testify against O'Duffy, they were told they would be tried on suspicion of being sodomites and British spies. Under such pressure, he agreed to provide evidence and anonymous testimony against O'Duffy, and in exchange, the authorities allowed the two to be released, with their practicing of buggery and Mac Liammóir's English birth allowed to remain secret in light of his contributions to the revival of the Irish language.\n\nO'Duffy's remaining supporters denounced the accusations as slander designed to denigrate an Irish patriot and justify his execution, likening them to the infamous Black Diaries that legitimised the demise of Roger Casement at the hands of the British. Nonetheless, the revelations had the desired effect in weakening the army's sympathy for the general. As such, after a swift court case Eoin O'Duffy was convicted of sodomy, and most important of all, treason against the Irish nation, and sentenced to death by firing squad, with little objection."

Following the announcement, crowds of tens of thousands would throng the Hill of Tara in astonishment at the momentous occasion that was the first inauguration of an Irish sovereign at the sacred Lia Fáil in centuries, though tight security was also deployed to ward off any would-be assassination attempts.\n\nThe ceremony began as King Aodh, having taken the Irish translation of his father's name as his regnal name, and his wife Josefina Luísa Roquette Ricciardi, or Queen Seosaimhín, arrived alongside Ó Cuinneagáin and an entourage of ministers, clergy, military men, Gaelic nobles, and other notables. Standing at the Lia Fáil, the King delivered a speech in the Irish he had learned in the time since his arrival on the isle, if in a marked Portuguese accent, swearing to uphold the Christian faith and values of Ireland's ancient Gaelic culture held by his valiant ancestors.\n\nAfter this address, Aodh was anointed by Archbishop Mac Ruaidhrí, while Psalms and hymns in honour of Christ and St. Colmcille were sung for the success of the Kingdom. Finally, he was awarded the slat na ríghe, a white sceptre symbolising the purity and straightness of justice, and crowned by the Archbishop. As the ceremony came to a close and the new King and Queen left Tara along with their retinue, an army band triumphantly played the national anthem and the Marcshlua Uí Néill, while the sun shone bright in the distance as if representing the civilisation of the Gael taking its place in the glow of day once more."

Complicating matters further is the fact that some northern Catholics also sadly remain wary of Dublin, given their betrayal by liberal democratic West British governments prior to AN's ascendance, and within the community many also sympathise with the traitors rooted out from AN rather than the victors.\n\nIf the administration is not only to live up to its promises of ensuring stability but to truly consolidate its power and be recognised internationally as Ireland's legitimate government without question, then restoring order in the north will be beyond essential. By the carrot and the stick, loyalist insurgents must be subdued, and Ulster's Catholics won over and reassured that AN is looking out for their interests, lest the continuing deterioration of national authority in the province lead to a loyalist rebellion, whose potential success would have devastating results for not only the regime but Ireland as a whole."

The O'Neills, descended from the legendary Niall of the Nine Hostages and among the oldest and most noble dynasties in Europe, were one of the greatest Irish royal houses to hold the title, and following the English invasion were at the helm of many uprisings against their rule. Most notable of these was the Nine Years' War, which though close-run tragically ended with defeat at Kinsale, and Hugh O'Neill's exile to continental Europe in the Flight of the Earls, leading to the establishment of England's total control over the island for the ruinous centuries to follow.\n\nDespite generations having passed, the heirs to this illustrious lineage still live on as nobility in the Kingdom of Portugal, where the grandfather of current claimant Jorge Maria O'Neill was recognised as the Count of Tyrone and head of the House of O'Neill by the Pope, along with the Spanish and Portuguese crowns. The combination of the connection with Lusitanian integralism and the dynasty's glorious history makes them an ideal choice for restoration, symbolising the great resurgence of the rightful Gaelic order in Ireland after hundreds of years of tyranny.\n\nOn the other hand, in spite of the populace's somewhat favourable image of the Kaiser and the fall of Britain's royalty, republican ideals remain influential. Even inside Aontas Náisiúnta there exist some who are devoted to the revival of Irish civilisation but are nonetheless skeptical of monarchy.

 ireland.3450.d1:9 "The restoration of stability under Aontas Náisiúnta has proven a point much debated, the experiment with the British import of parliamentary democracy was nothing but folly, leading to disharmony and inefficiency as brother was turned against brother and those with vision were held back by the short-sighted and self-interested needs of those unwilling to make sacrifices for the sake of the nation. As Pádraig Pearse once said, \"always it is the many who fight for the evil thing, and the few who fight for the good thing.\"\n\nHowever, although only few can be great, General Eoin O'Duffy has shown that the great can emerge from anywhere, having risen to heights well above what one familiar with his origins would expect, with his cult of personality spreading as he has become revered as a hero on the level of Ireland's revolutionary martyrs. Even when attending a GAA match, keeping in touch with his old sporting passion before the days of the War of Independence, the general's mere presence is met with excitement and acclaim by players and spectators alike, no more true than in O'Duffy's home province of Ulster, and the same holds true among the Gardaí and military men whom he once had direct command over.\n\nWhere once the Irish were depicted as a disorderly and undisciplined rabble by sneering British propagandists, the falsehood of that view has been revealed as crime and foreign degeneracy is mercilessly stamped out, the love of faith and fatherland instilled in the populace, and those anti-national elements, whether imperialist or syndicalist, whose allegiances still lie with Britain are put in their rightful place. As O'Duffy himself matches his mastery of the country with self-mastery as he works to moderate his drinking habit, devoting his time instead to fulfilling Ireland's august destiny, the Irish people can rest assured that so long as the General is at the helm, the fate of Ireland is without doubt in as good hands as it has ever been throughout the island's long and turbulent history."

His descendant King Aodh, aided by the extensive assistance of his most visionary advisor Gearóid Ó Cuinneagáin, has slowly grown into his role as Ard Rí, avenging his ancestors' tragic defeat and flight with the revival of the Gaelic order.\n\n$ireland.3450.d2.midstart$ King and $ireland.3450.d2.midend$\n\n$ireland.3450.d2.end$"

The Cathaoirleach has responded with a speech announcing a state of war against the UVF and that, while acknowledging Protestants as fellow workers duped by the bourgeois into turning against their brothers, the forces of imperialism would be routed."

With it seeming likely that the British lapdogs in Belfast will now quickly return to the lap of their exiled master, the hope of reversing this disaster seems like an impossible pipe dream.\n\nThe damage done to the regime's image in the eyes of the Irish public is almost unquantifiable, with people even being so brave to openly mock [IRE_loc_leader_surname], knowing that even his own men agree with the sentiment enough to not bother preventing it.

 ireland.3500.d1:9 "$ireland.3500.d.start$ Peadar O'Donnell's surprisingly nuanced approach has resulted in the gradual, incremental wearing down of resistance to the new regime from all sides. The integralist bandits have been hunted down, but non-armed opposition to the regime has been met with a more measured response. The aims of his party remain the same — the complete control of the state and its people — but the initial methods employed have proved more difficult for his opponents to counter than anticipated. Little-by-little, much of the apparatus of state, the media and the clergy has been quietly replaced, coerced and controlled, contrary to the expectations of the party's enemies, who expected a more forceful affair.\n\n$ireland.3500.d.mid$ despite being $ireland.3500.d.midlate$ the veteran trade unionist Jim Larkin, the ageing leader gave a blustering speech on the potential dangers of $ireland.3500.d.end$, and did not truly have the interests of the Irish people at heart. In a damning but almost droll indictment to the Irish Trades Union Congress, O'Donnell thoroughly discredited Larkin, and how detrimental and alienating his massive industrialisation policies would be to the Irish working class. With his position secure, the Cathaoirleach intends now to put his master plan in motion, and harness nationalist sentiment to steadily centralise the power of the party, bringing along the people without them even realising."
 ireland.3500.d2:9 "$ireland.3500.d.start$ Peadar O'Donnell's decisive actions have resulted in such reactionary activities being harshly cracked down upon. The integralist bandits have been hunted down, hostile newspapers muzzled, the civil service newly staffed with a cadre of loyal socialists, and only the most outspoken and fervent anti-syndicalists even among the clergy dare to speak against the regime. However, these authoritarian measures have unfortunately managed to alienate the opinions of the Irish working class, who, having opposed and overthrown one autocratic dictatorship already, have no desire to bow down to another.\n\n$ireland.3500.d.mid$ although previously $ireland.3500.d.midlate$ the renowned Jim Larkin, the long-serving trade unionist utilised his still powerful speeches to rally the populace and the unions against $ireland.3500.d.end$, but to no avail as the Irish Trades Union Congress issued a vote of no confidence against O'Donnell's chairmanship, bringing the Cathaoirleach down in favour of Larkin and the ISP. Breaking from SÉ's hardline policies and love-hate relationship with Britain, Larkin, having studied at the Sorbonne in Paris, intends to follow not only the inspiration of the French as the United Irishmen did, but also the true vision of the fallen martyr James Connolly."
 ireland.3500.d3:9 "$ireland.3500.d.start$ the new regime found itself under fire from all directions, particularly in rural Ireland. These conservative heartlands were shocked to see Labour's original coalition elected in the first instance, and if O'Brien's original government could only barely be tolerated, then its more radical offspring was surely a step too far.\n\nThough pockets of resistance remain in these areas, what has ameliorated the situation in the rest of the country has been the more parliamentary character of the new regime in question. What was once the Progressive Labour Party, now dissolved back into what could be called the \"mainstream\" Labour Party, has its image etched into the new regime, and it is a regime that would seek to unite rather than to divide. The new government has been open with the people, acknowledging the reality of Ireland's new geopolitical alignment, but within reason it has made every effort so far to maintain as many aspects of the old administration as is practicable.\n\nRuling through consensus, the party has negotiated with the ICA, the unions, and old coalition members, including the rump dissidents of the Labour Party, attempting to build tolerance, if not yet support for the new regime. Their immediate aim is to form a new governmental system that works, and that lasts, within the obvious constraint that Ireland is in the Third Internationale.\n\nIn place of nationalist rhetoric and dogmatic ideology, Ireland will attempt to retain the old as well as introduce the new. The more hardline reactionaries must be dealt with decisively, but leniency and discourse with other political opponents will do more than violence could to bring them alongside. Pragmatism is the order of the day, for if the Republic is to become a Socialist one, let it be done with as little fuss as possible."

 ireland.3502.d1:9 "At the centre of the new regime stands the elusive persona of Peadar O'Donnell, the enigmatic figurehead to lead Ireland's undeniably ambitious and all-encompassing new regime. O'Donnell, initially willing and eager to accept foreign aid to help declare the socialist republic, nonetheless has now entirely secured the rule of his party using only Irish arms and Irish words.\n\nSaor Éire's beliefs are that the land, power, wealth and entirety of Ireland itself must belong solely to the Irish people. To achieve this, the party is a necessary organ of the people, and through the party, the people can begin to control their destinies. The state, the party, and the people must each unite, and be armed and ready to defend Ireland's freedom at all costs. Critics would decry the completely undue control of the lives of the republic's citizens that Saor Éire demands, but such voices are now silenced and marginalised.\n\nThe impassioned but understated O'Donnell speaks with a thick Donegal accent, more at home conversing in Irish than in English, and is quite content with his title of Cathaoirleach, or Chairman. His upbringing in one of the most impoverished and remote parts of the island shaped his desire for its utter transformation, particularly for the benefit of the rural poor. As a leader, despite the massive control afforded to the party, he serves more of a figurehead to the senior party members than an autocrat. But nonetheless he now leads the state and the party, and embodies its intense and fervent desire for the formation of a truly Free Ireland."
 ireland.3502.d2:9 "At the centre of the new regime stands the imposing figure of Jim Larkin, the closest thing that Ireland has to charisma personified. Larkin, who is already considered something of an icon to syndicalist movements worldwide, has been involved in industrial syndicalism itself for decades, even at a time long before the Weltkrieg when it was not the predominant form of socialism, starting from when he studied De Leonism in his youth.\n\nThe title of Cathaoirleach, or Chairman, in some ways suits him poorly, as Larkin scarcely has time to sit, with his unceasing moving, agitating and organising. Belying his thick Liverpudlian accent, Larkin is a diehard Irish nationalist, and came to the fore first in Ireland over 30 years ago for his decision to split his union from its British equivalent as \"Irish workers need Irish unions.\" He later magnified his reputation with the Dublin Lockout of 1913, one of the largest and longest strikes in Europe at the time.\n\nBig Jim's presence is more experienced than observed, with his considerable stature and the theatricality of his thundering speeches going far in stirring up the people, and building him something of a personality cult, something that he does little to discourage.\n\nThe shadow of Connolly will forever lie over the syndicalist movement in Ireland, but Larkin is eager to prove himself in his remaining years, and leave a lasting legacy that will never be upstaged."
 ireland.3502.d3:9 "The President, William O'Brien, has had a difficult few months. From ruling as the elected leader of the country in a time of national crisis, to being overthrown in a military coup, and to being put back in a position of the same name by the Union of Britain, even if an entirely different and lesser role, it has been a time of radical change for a moderate-minded trade unionist. However, rather than struggling to come to terms with what was likely to be his complete political humiliation, O'Brien has used all his powers to ensure that the fate intended for him shall not come to pass.\n\nO'Brien has made himself indispensible to RN Tweedy, and other former entryists into the Progressive Labour Party, who had plotted the Second Revolution from within government. He acts as a link to those outside of the party or even the left, as they are aware of his initially unwilling participation in the British-sponsored regime, and see him as far more favourable to work with than the likes of O'Donnell or Larkin.\n\nIn exchange for opening up these channels of communication and very slowly building acknowledgement of the new regime across the political sphere, O'Brien has begun to ever so subtly influence the ruling cadre's policies. He is eager to ensure that even though Ireland's revolution was built on British arms, it will not remain so that way. And if Ireland is to be socialist, he must do what he can to ensure it is on its own terms."

He has emerged as a key figure in the aftermath of the Second Irish Revolution, and one who has been crucial in the underground work of the ICA for many years.\n\nWhite comes from a privileged military background that is typical of the upper class of Ulster Protestants. He was educated in the prestigious military academy at Sandhurst, describing it as the place where he learned most of \"fortification and fornication\". The Second Boer War was his crucible, where he took part in many battles, was mentioned in despatches and awarded the Distinguished Service Order, but it is also where he developed his loathing of the British establishment.\n\nAfter the war, he served as aide-de-camp to his father who was Governor of Gibraltar, during which time he met both the King and Kaiser. But in the end, it would be Ireland that he served, as his eventual return home resulted in him abandoning the usual beliefs of his background, going from unionist, to Home Ruler, to republican and finally to socialist.\n\nWhite left the ICA just before the Rising due to disagreements in its organisation, and spent the War of Independence in the political wilderness. However, the revolutions occurring since the Weltkrieg have inspired him to once more take up arms in the name of Ireland. With his aristocratic background, dapper appearance, and flamboyant air, combined with anti-authoritarian, anti-clerical semi-anarchistic Christian socialist ideals, this misfit is crucial to the consolidation and continuation of the socialist republic."

 ireland.3504.d:9 "A rather unusual request has come to the War Office from serving General, Eric Dorman-Smith, better known as \"Chink\" to his comrades, indicating his desire for a secondment abroad. With the dust settling in Ireland, and a friendly socialist government in Dublin, Dorman-Smith has taken the opportunity to propose that he serve with the Irish army as a commanding officer and \"advisor\" on military strategy, bringing them up to scratch with the modern methods of warfare employed by our own army. But it has been quickly speculated that Dorman-Smith's intentions are hardly out of international solidarity, but rather a desire to return his ancestral home of County Cavan in Ulster, Ireland. Likewise, Dorman-Smith has allegedly ruffled feathers within the army owing to his \"sin\" of simply being too clever, and being intolerant of those not on his intellectual calibre, a fact he is prone to show. Such antagonism has not made Dorman-Smith many friends, and he perhaps sees a fresh start abroad as a \"sink or swim\" moment.\n\nThe proposal has garnered a mixed reaction in the military, with some officers being suspiciously supportive of the move, though dissent has emerged. Edmund Ironside, commander of the RTC, and leading military theorist, Basil Liddell-Hart, have both commented that it would be a \"waste\" to send Dorman-Smith to serve in an army with significantly less resources, and a likely inability to make full use of Dorman-Smith's expertise. Still, the proposal has gained a political edge, with it being put forward that agreeing to the secondment would be both a show of trust to Ireland, and a welcome acknowlegement of them as partners rather than subordinants. We could of course block the proposal if we feel Dorman-Smith would be more useful at his post in the British Army. The prospect of promotion will likely tide him over."

Given that this would not have been possible without the assistance from [ENG.GetNameDef], it is no surprise that correspondence has been frequent. Today's message brings good news — the British Army has decided to send one of their eminient generals on secondment to its Irish namesake, a man none other than County Cavan native, Eric Dorman Smith.\n\nDorman-Smith, who has stated his intention to adopt the Irish form of his name, is seen as a rising star in the British Army. His Anglo-Irish background meant that his chosen career comes as no surprise, in contrast to his extremely modern and unorthodox views on the future of direction of warfare. Prior to the British revolution, his outspoken critique of the tactics associated with the old establishment rubbed up much of the top brass the wrong way, but the past few years has seen his theories gain more traction and renown.\n\nWith Britain and Ireland now in firm alliance, he can combine his support of Irish republicanism with his position in the British Army, and personally requested this temporary secondment to his native country. He is well aware that his theorems on the greater use of technology and mobilisation in warfare may be easier put into practice with a larger armed force, but for Dorman O'Gowan, the newly re-energised revolutionary atmosphere in Ireland was just too much to say no to."

Ireland has long been a particularly conservative and anti-socialist nation, with socialism having little following and facing much hostility despite James Connolly's famous involvement in the Easter Rising, and while the aftermath of Black Monday and British influence managed to change that to a degree, there still exists deeply entrenched antipathy to syndicalism across the island among all sections of Irish society.\n\nThe new government has already received reports of attacks on the Irish Citizen Army in rural areas from Blueshirts who claim to be fighting a \"second War of Independence against the British\", along with major resistance and denunciation from established institutions such as the civil service and the Catholic Church. Such opposition has naturally been especially severe in the province of Ulster, where not only are loyalists who previously acquiesced to Irish reunification only out of anti-syndicalism appalled by this turn of events, now sympathising with the UVF, but Catholics too are by-and-large very suspicious of syndicalism, having been courted prior largely by the right.\n\nThis state of affairs has not been helped by the regime's current dependence on the Union of Britain, which has been eagerly used in anti-syndicalist propaganda by the state's bourgeois foes, but if it is to survive in the long-term it must be able to stand on its own feet, independent of its neighbour's aid by building up its legitimacy in the eyes of the Irish people while rooting out counterrevolutionary elements both north and south.

The more overtly violent resistance has been quashed, and even the more insidious forms of passive resistance are showing signs of beginning to falter.\n\nThe people are finally beginning to realise, even if they do not admit it, that the new government is here to stay, and is one and only government of Ireland. Through force of arms and force of words, the larger-scale resistance has been reduced down to almost nothing, and once the final decisive blow has been dealt, the more smaller-scale localised opposition will scatter away like dust in the wind."

Thankfully the infamous general has not returned from the grave, but Irish politicians at home have raised the hypocrisy of Britain pledging its support to Ireland on the world stage yet glorifying a butcher of the Irish people at home. Since their revolution in 1925, the new British republic has drawn many a connection between its own polity and the Commonwealth of old with Cromwell entering a revered place that was once occupied by Kings and Queens of old. Naturally, this has caused notable resentment in Ireland and considerable embarrassment to John Maffey, the long-running British ambassador to Ireland.\n\nAs the issue has grown in notoriety, particular ire has been levelled at the so-called \"Five Great Statues\" of Cromwell, spread around the country, which have long since become places of display for admiration Cromwell. Popular demands have called on the British to tear them down at last, and end their veneration of a glorified military dictator who massacred innocents in the name of conquest. With the issue becoming increasingly to large to ignore, Maffey has assured the government that he will raise the issue back in London, but has warned that there will likely be considerable resistance from the British government that will have a tough time spinning the issue but may, hopefully, appreciate the international propaganda victory here."

Wythenshawe of Manchester; Warrington of Cheshire; Bradford city Hall; St. Ives of Cambridge and Westminster Palace are all home to a statue of the former Lord Protector, a figure of considerable veneration in modern British lore and propaganda. Seen as a spiritual predecessor to the modern republic, and long an object of praise by the Labour Party for the Regicide and his \"clearing\" of the Lords, Cromwell is admired and often invoked by many British politicians while holding a special place as a sort of pseudo-folk hero among the populace. But while in Britain it is a national habit to focus on the glorious Commonwealth founded upon his labours, the British discourse often glosses over his actions in Ireland which can not be seen as anything other than murderous.\n\nSuch veneration, and the supposed hypocrisy of venerating Cromwell at home while pledging our support and solidarity to Ireland abroad, has finally become too much to bear for the Irish government, and they have made a formal request that we remove the statues of Cromwell and look to idolise someone else. While there's certainly no shortage of radical British heroes to sit on Cromwell's plinth outside Congressional Hall, the proposal has nevertheless sparked consternation among the political class with some ministers balking at such a proposal, and pledging they will not feel \"guilty\" for Britain's past. But in the end, cooler heads will take the lead and it has been proposed that rather than topple all the statues, we simply remove some. The Westminster statue has been deemed totally off limits due to its architectural and political importance, but the others are of less concern. Still, while this will certainly appease the Irish and boost our image in their eyes, native Britons will hardly be happy at seeing their Lord Protector toppled."

 irelandflavour.361.d:9 "As the immediate commotion following the fallout of Black Monday and the LÉ Macha incident has died down to an extent, the government is starting to take stock of another extremely significant occasion that recently occurred, despite its complete overshadowing.\n\nFour weeks ago, the eleventh Olympic Games came to a close in their host city, which was of course none other than Dublin. Ireland's bid to host the Games in the first place was seen as a shot in the dark, but the young republic's relatively neutral international positioning was deemed palatable by the powers that be, and to the government's incredulity if not worry, their bid won the day.\n\nThere were some calls for the Games to be cancelled, or at least spending to be drastically cut in the run-up to the Games due to budgetary concerns, but the government was consistent in their statements that the money to host the Games had already been spent, and the Games would go ahead as planned.\n\nOnce this had been made clear, the people gradually but enthusiastically took on their roles as hosts, with sporting pursuits and physical feats being held in particularly high regard by more conservative members of the nationalist movement. The government was especially eager to showcase Ireland as an independent and modern nation, in this, the most prominent of ways possible, while still attempting to deal with ongoing domestic crises.\n\nAfter a rousing opening ceremony, almost on par with the festivities of the Easter Rising anniversary earlier in the year, the Games proved to be a complete success. Particular pride was taken for the Irish sportsmen, who won far more medals than expected for a small nation. The hosting of the modern Olympics was eventually deemed a worthwhile undertaking, but not a feat that the government is looking to repeat any time soon, given the scale of the efforts involved."

 irelandflavour.362.t:9 "The Death of French Liberty"
 irelandflavour.362.d:9 "This morning in Ireland we have awoken to grave news coming from Algiers, the capital of the remnants of what many here consider the legitimate government of France, that has left many in our young republic shaken. General Charles de Gaulle, who seized control of the state after a brief civil conflict, officially addressed the French parliament yesterday to announce his intentions to restore the House of Orléans to the French throne and abolish the Third Republic once and for all. Prince Jean, the Orléanist pretender to the crown, quickly accepted de Gaulle's invitation and although he is yet to be coronated it is clear to all that French republicanism is finally dead.\n\nIt is no secret that most republican movements in Europe were greatly inspired by France, and in Ireland this rings especially true. Wolfe Tone, the father of Irish republicanism, was both heavily inspired and directly supported by French republicans in his uprisings against the British crown. Even the most fundamental symbol of our state, the Irish tricolour, was created by French republican women celebrating the ousting of Louis Philippe I, great-grandfather of the new king, as a symbol of our common struggle for liberty and freedom.\n\nThis news has greatly emboldened the extremists on both the left and right in Ireland, who have already begun with their doomsaying predictions as to the future of Irish democracy. Those on the extreme right have declared this to be definitive proof that liberalism and democracy are too flawed to combat the threat posed by syndicalist forces, advocating for the creation of a modern Irish monarchy to protect our nation. Likewise those on the extreme left have interpreted this news as a sign that bourgeois democracy cannot stop the rise of reactionary authoritarianism, and see socialism as the only way to guarantee Irish liberty. We can only hope that both are equally deluded."

 irelandflavour.371.d:9 "The Irish novelist and playwright Kate O'Brien was already an author of some note in the public's mind in years past, but her latest work \"Mary Lavelle\" must surely be now her most notorious.\n\nO'Brien has found her niche in typically writing romances about British and Anglo-Irish bourgeoisie characters trying to find their place in the world, following the British and Irish revolutions. Despite her fascination with the upper class, the committed anglophile O'Brien has spent much of the last decade in the Union of Britain where she relished the revolutionary atmosphere. Her lifestyle over there is much remarked upon in Ireland, as it's reported she crops her hair short, is known to wear men's clothing, and there are even rumours that she is intimate with other women.\n\nHer new book does little to dispel that innuendo, as \"Mary Lavelle\" features an older Irish lesbian professing her love for the female protagonist. This salaciousness is on top of the main thread of the story featuring the protagonist falling in love with a married man."
 irelandflavour.371.d1:9 "$irelandflavour.371.d$\n\nBetween the scandalous nature of both the author and the work itself, there are calls in some quarters for the book to be banned in this country, while others say the comparatively more laissez-faire social attitude of Sinn Féin should stand."

 irelandflavour.372.t:9 "The Tailteann Games"
 irelandflavour.372.d:9 "\"Do again for the Gaels what you have done for the Greeks\" — such were the slogans that littered the pamphlets that have been distributed around Leinster House for the past number of weeks. The relatively successful hosting of the modern Olympic Games in Dublin last year has led a small but influential group of Irish sports enthusiasts to put pressure on the government to re-host the Tailteann Games.\n\nThe Tailteann Games, in their original form, were played in the centuries preceding the Norman invasions of 1169-1171, and as far back as over a millennium before the birth of Christ, if legends are true. Tradition holds that they were first held to mark the funeral of the harvest deity Tailtiu, who died of exhaustion after clearing the dense, expansive forests of Co. Meath, to form the rich farmland for which it is now known. These games were declared a time of truce, with great tests of wits, skill and strength on display, and a time for celebration and the arranging of marriages.\n\nShortly before the onset of the British Revolution in 1924, the Sinn Féin administration of the day hosted a modern day equivalent, to great success. Held a few weeks after and largely modelled on the Olympic Games in Berlin, the games brought together hundreds of people of Irish descent from all over the world, as well as some guest competitors invited to come and add to the spectacle.\n\nTo the chagrin of those petitioning the government, however, these games did not become a regular fixture. Security concerns and spending issues became too much for successive governments of the day to justify, particularly when the insular nature of the games would mean there would be little international interest to invest in increasing the security involved. Even the hosting of the Olympics themselves had been a tough call to make, and had only been accepted on the back of the international recognition it would bring, assumed to outweigh the initial costs.\n\nBut with the world engulfed in further conflict, particularly in America where so much of the diaspora lies, let alone an even larger sporting event being held locally only in recent memory, there was little appetite in the government to pay heed to these petitions."

When Cathal Brugha visited Boston and gave his great speech in Fenway Park, thousands of people attended and cried out for Irish independence. With the recent crisis in America devolving into all out civil war, a provisional government has been established in New England following intervention by the Canadians to shelter it from the war.\n\nWhile some in the government refuse to openly support anything backed by the British exiles, many have called for Ireland to recognise the New England government and invite [NEE.GetLeader] to give his own speech symbolising Irish-American friendship and cooperation."

 irelandflavour.381.d:9 "Low ranking clergy from Ireland's least populated county are not usually a matter of interest to either the nation's media or politicians, but Father Peter Conefrey from Leitrim is an exception. An arch-traditional nationalist, Conefrey advocates for the population to support the Irish language and traditional Irish music over foreign influences.\n\nViews such as those are ten-a-penny and indeed, such well trodden ground that the liberals of Ireland are well used to riposting them. However, Conefrey has found a somewhat bold new line of attack, denouncing Jazz as \"borrowed from Central Africa by a gang of wealthy syndicalists in the USA to strike at Christian civilisation throughout the world\" and branding listeners as outright \"traitors\" to Ireland, with particular venom spit towards Anglo-Irish and German residents for their indulgence of the genre.\n\nConefrey's angst-ridden views that strike at all things foreign and metropolitan saw him able to amass reportedly \"several thousand\" supporters at a recent anti-Jazz protest in south Leitrim. Letters of support from Éamon de Valera and Archbishop Joseph MacRory were read from a platform, and verbal attacks were made on politicians espousing cultural pluralist views. It would be difficult to imagine such galvanisation a decade ago but its clear that recent economic and political events have added fuel to this fire."

 irelandflavour.382.d:9 "Another anniversary has come and gone, with a recent commemoration taking place marking the 20th year since the passing of John Redmond.\n\nIt was a muted affair. For many, he is remembered as a man on the wrong side of history, whose actions led to the death of thousands of young Irishmen. For others, a man whose one main mistake came to define his entire political career. Redmond, during his own lifetime however, was much more than that.\n\nAs the leader of the Irish Parliamentary Party, he was de facto leader of Irish nationalism at the beginning of the 1910s. His goal of Home Rule was on the brink of being made a reality by Westminster, making a civil war in Ireland between the Ulster Volunteer Force and Irish Volunteers of the day seem inevitable. The outbreak of the Weltkrieg put an end to both these certainties, with Redmond making the fateful decision to urge all able-bodied Volunteers to enlist in the British war effort, in an attempt to ensure the enactment of Home Rule after what was sure to be another brief war...\n\nHe was a man for whom Home Rule was the end goal, and would have been content with an autonomous Ireland at the heart of the British Empire. This is when most others, even within his party, saw it as just a step towards greater independence. His legacy is one that is looked upon more favourably by those who would have had more personal ties with Britain, and the few more moderate republicans with Entente sympathies.\n\nIn his native Wexford where he had been interred, a modest and respectful ceremony took place at his family mausoleum, with attendees including several NDP politicians and party officials, as well as some Irish veterans of the Weltkrieg. Those present were urged to reconsider his legacy, and remember him for the times he lived in, before the Republic could have become a reality. This message was of course meant for those not in attendance, and by-and-large fell on deaf ears."

Throughout the country many have made the journey to Sallins in Co. Kildare to take part in the annual Wolfe Tone commemoration at Bodenstown Graveyard that happened on Sunday. Being regarded as the \"Father of Irish Republicanism\" it is no surprise to see a sea of Irish flags waved by the processioners, but the less informed observer may be surprised to see them waving side by side with the tricolour of France.\n\nIf there is one nation that Ireland has been able to continuously count on throughout history to come to its aid, it has been France. United initially by faith, the French sent soldiers to help Irish Catholics in their fight against William of Orange in an attempt to establish an independent Ireland, albeit one still ruled by a British king. It was with the French revolution that France's relationship with Ireland moved beyond faith, and so 140 years ago they would send brave men to fight alongside Wolfe Tone, irrespective of him being a Protestant rather than a Catholic. This event made the year 1798 become known in Ireland as \"Bliain na bhFrancach\", the \"Year of the French\", and it has permanently defined Ireland's relationship with France to this day."

Before the English invasion, the island was, like most of the continent, a monarchical society, and all its early rebellions too were of a monarchist nature. While a republic was mooted for the first time in 1627 as a compromise between rival contenders for the Irish throne, it would take until 1791 for the idea to truly rise to prominence as Theobald Wolfe Tone, inspired by the French Revolution, formed the Society of United Irishmen with the aim of establishing an Irish Republic free from the British crown.\n\nThough supported by the French, due to unfortunate circumstances the uprisings of the United Irishmen in 1798 and 1803 would end in failure, but the revolutionaries' vision would resonate with the hearts of the Irish people, inspiring them for years to come. Through the darkness of the bleak 19th century, the Young Irelanders and the Fenians would carry on the torch of republicanism handed down to them, rising up in 1848 and 1867 respectively.\n\nMost significant of all however, were the Irish Republican Brotherhood, a secret society which was key in organising the fateful Easter Rising which ignited the spirit of Irish liberty once again and, although proposals of crowning a German prince were thrown around, ultimately the republican aspirations passed from generation to generation would emerge triumphant as the Irish Republican Army fought its war of independence to drive out the British."

The origin of this system is mediaeval, and in truth has not advanced much in concept since that time.\n\nIn Ireland, these manors were and are controlled by Anglo-Irish families, installed in the 17th and 18th centuries as the preceding Catholic nobility was stripped of power and influence. Owing their wealth and status to the British state that installed them, these families were loyal servants of Imperialism, acting to uphold the status quo not only locally, but also internationally, as the non-inheriting sons of these families frequently acted as colonial bureaucrats across the British Empire. Following the revolution in Britain, the \"big houses\" were often the last refuge for these \"servants of the Empire\"."

Whereas before the advent of the GAA, the \"Gaelic\" games of football, hurling, handball, and rounders were largely moribund, come Irish independence GAA-affiliated clubs could be found in every Irish parish. Though its influence was more strongly felt in rural areas, come independence \"Football\" meant the Gaelic sort to nearly any Irishman. The GAA continues to organise and govern those sports both at home and abroad, and GAA clubs and events often draw massive crowds of spectators.\n\nUnsurpisingly, for an organisation dedicated to cultural revivalism, in the political sphere the GAA was and is strongly associated with Irish nationalism. Notably, the group counted prominent Fenians and Home Rulers among its founding members and first patrons, and local GAA clubs were early nexuses of recruitment for the Irish Republican Brotherhood. It was a massacre perpetrated by Crown Forces on civilian spectators at a Gaelic Football match in the GAA's flagship Croke Park stadium, \"Bloody Sunday\", that became a potent symbol of British tyranny during the War of Independence."
 irelandflavour.386.d1:9 "$irelandflavour.386.d.start$\n\nThe GAA was briefly granted authority over Irish athletics generally until the foundation of the National Athletic and Cycling Association (NACA) in mid-1922. At that time, Ireland had recently signed the Anglo-Irish treaty with the United Kingdom and support for the GAA by the newly independent Ireland was understood to potentially undermine unity in sport. That bifurcation remained in place even after the end of British rule in the North and has continued through until the present. Though the Gaelic Games (and thus the GAA) receive substantial patronage from the government in Dublin, in the interests of maintaining social harmony, the present government of the republic seems certain to continue to uphold that state of affairs."
 irelandflavour.386.d2:9 "$irelandflavour.386.d.start$\n\nThough not keen on micromanaging the governance of athletics, Eoin O'Duffy cut his teeth politically in the Ulster GAA organising body, and has always been deeply personally committed to matters of sport and the GAA in particular. While some Gaelicists still grumble about his supposed betrayal of Gaelic athletics — it was under his direction that the National Athletic and Cycling Association (NACA) was created in mid-1922 to assume authority for non-Gaelic sport — government patronage of the GAA has seen a notable uptick since his rise to unchallenged political authority."
 irelandflavour.386.d3:9 "$irelandflavour.386.d.start$\n\nWhile the fight for political sovereignty was won years ago, the enemy continues to dominate Ireland and its people: foreign games remain popular across the country and even hold a more prestigious place in the minds of many. This sad state of affairs necessitates action and it is apparent that the GAA will be both sword and shield in the struggle for national liberation in athletics. Already, the state has begun to carry out that struggle arm-in-arm with the GAA. Though drastic action has not yet been taken, praise for the GAA and the Gaelic Games has become a common feature of AN rallies and Ó Cuinneagáin's public statements.\n\nA common theme has been frustration with the state of governance of Irish sport. Though the GAA was briefly granted authority over Irish athletics generally, the National Athletic and Cycling Association (NACA) was founded in mid-1922 and maintains authority over many areas of athletics, including those foreign games which ought to be driven from Ireland to begin with. Clearly, a sweeping reorganisation, including the empowerment of the GAA, is long overdue."
 irelandflavour.386.d4:9 "$irelandflavour.386.d.start$\n\nIn light of the GAA's nationalist pedigree and general popularity, an uneasiness initially existed between the organisation and the government since the light of socialism shone upon the Irish Government. In effect, an unspoken agreement came into force between the GAA and Dublin whereby each left the other alone to the extent possible. For its part, the Irish Government has continued to lean upon Gaelic sport for legitimacy, eliciting only unofficial grumbling from the organisation's leadership, while the GAA remained independent. However, the GAA seems to have further reconciled itself to the socialist government in recent months, with socialists accepted and elected into various association leadership positions. Ranking GAA members have even appeared alongside government officials at a number of high-profile events, indicating that the GAA is slowly turning a bit pink, if not yet entirely red."

Born with the name Sétanta, he gained his more famous moniker, meaning \"the Hound of Culann\", as a child after killing in self-defence the guard-dog of the smith Culann, offering to take the dog's place out of obligation. Trained in the art of combat in Scotland, he soon became Ulster's strongest warrior, most famously defending the kingdom against the armies of Queen Medb of Connacht in the mythological epic, the \"Táin Bó Cúailnge\".\n\nA well-regarded bronze statue designed by Oliver Sheppard, a sculptor who competed in art competitions during the 1924 and 1928 Olympics, depicts Cú Chulainn's ultimate death in battle, having tied himself to a stone, according to some tellings with his own intestines, to die on his feet, leaving his foes unaware of his demise for three days until a raven perched upon his shoulder. Although a Protestant born in County Tyrone, Sheppard is nonetheless an Irish nationalist who in his own words stated that \"my politics are simple. I have always thought that this country should be a free country\", and has his own connection to the struggle for independence, having been a teacher of Willie Pearse, brother of the renowned Pádraig Pearse."

Through the fine work of the Department of Foreign Affairs, Ireland's access to a vital source of energy had been secured. As this fuel was not found naturally in Ireland, it could only be obtained by importing from countries much closer to the equator, and so important was this resource, that many wondered how so many industrial sectors had managed without it in the past, given how reliant they are now on the rich, dark liquid it produced.\n\nTea. \"The only good thing the British ever left us with\", as has been murmured about the peoples' love of the beverage. Such is its popularity that per capita, Irelands' demand now outstrips its neighbours. Introduced by the old British ruling class well over a hundred years ago, its usage diffused among the rest of the population in time.\n\nTraditionally, the British had gained their supply of the leaf from their colonies on the Indian subcontinent, with the Union now obtaining similarly from their own Indian allies. While access to this source for ourselves seems steady, for now, cautious whispers determined that it would be unwise to solely rely on it, should the trade be disrupted in the future.\n\nAs such, a small group of Irish diplomats had spent the last few months travelling the world, visiting plantations and negotiating importation deals, finally determining that mixing some Indian Assam tea with the darker, stronger tea available in German-held Kenya, would produce an excellent robust brew, suitable for the domestic market. By decreasing the country's reliance on potentially unreliable solely Indian sources, and diversifying the blends used, the results have meant both a better tasting tea, and more secure access to imports for the years to come."

Serialised in \"The Worker's Republic\" newspaper and written almost entirely as a series of gossipy and bitter conversations between the dead in a Connemara graveyard, the book has been hailed by those gifted to understand it as a comic masterpiece, and its surge in popularity has begun to inspire a flood of Irish-language writing.\n\nBorn in the coastal Gaeltacht area of Cois Fharraige in County Galway, Ó Cadhain's outrage at the impoverishment of his community has fuelled his politics towards a fervent belief in syndicalism, and the revival of the Irish tongue. An activist for the rights of Gaeilgeoirí, or Irish-speakers, against the negligence of previous governments, he engaged in cooperation at times with the integralist wing of Aontas Náisiúnta due to their mutual reverence for Ireland's native language, but remained a committed socialist. Among the Irish Citizen Army, he became recognised for his talent as a recruiting officer, an organisation of which his membership would lead to him being sacked from his teaching job.\n\nNow in a position to promote his dearly-held views after the Second Irish Revolution, he has become the pioneer of a concept known as \"Athghabháil na hÉireann\", or the \"Reconquest of Ireland\", which regards both English and the growing lingua franca of German as tools of capitalism, and advances that only through socialism will the tongue of the Irish people be saved and the nation fully decolonised. Through this theory, he has sought win the support of Irish speakers for the new Republic, including former supporters of Aontas Náísiúnta who he argues were led astray by the forces of reaction, but that their cultural nationalism is at heart well-intentioned and harnessable for positive ends should they learn the error of their ways."

 irelandflavour.3810.d.start:9 "For the anniversary of the retirement of late historian and Senator Alice Stopford Green, a work has been published which examines an area of her interest — Irish nationalism among Protestants and the Anglo-Irish. Given her own background, this subject matter came of no surprise.\n\nThe book argues the irrefutability that since 1798, the Anglo-Irish have played a crucial role in the development of Irish nationalism and republicanism. Anglo-Irish and Protestants never made up more than 15% of the population, and while they would have been overwhelmingly loyalist historically, those who took up the nationalist cause made a disproportionate impact in nationalism as a whole.\n\nFrom the founders of Irish republicanism, Theobald Wolfe Tone and Lord Edward Fitzgerald, the movement's leadership has included Protestants, helped by the greater status and education that was afforded to them for centuries. Robert Emmet led his rebellion in 1803, and Charles Stewart Parnell was de facto leader of nationalism in the 1880s. Outside politics, literary greats Oscar Wilde and WB Yeats are also known for their nationalist ideals. The involvement of Protestants in nationalism, it argues, was key in separating the Catholic identity from the Irish one in the late 1700s, a time when they were entwined.\n\nThe book goes as far as contemporary Ireland, focusing on the fringes of politics, such as socialist academic Benjamin Farrington, or integralism proponent Ernest Blythe, and commenting on how the British Revolution may have influenced the popularity of different political groups among this population."
 irelandflavour.3810.d1:9 "$irelandflavour.3810.d.start$\n\nFor reasonably dry, academic text, the response has been fairly warm, with critics opining that the state's treatment of minorities should be used as a marker of its maturity.

 irelandflavour.3810.d2:9 "$irelandflavour.3810.d.start$\n\nThe publication garnered little attention from any official state sources, who were sure not to publicise it. In their view, many of the historical Protestant nationalists were only acting so in their their self interest, hoping to secure power in the inevitable free Ireland.

 irelandflavour.3810.d3:9 "$irelandflavour.3810.d.start$\n\nSeizing the opportunity for furthering their agenda, the government lauded the publication, emphasising the work of leaders like Thomas Davis, a Protestant in the 1800s who promoted independence, and the use of Irish as the sole language, contrasting with the anglophone lickspittle Daniel O'Connell, who was content with foregoing the language of his ancestors, kowtowing to the Catholic church, and keeping Ireland under the English crown.

Candles are lit, bonfires soar, prayers are said and every number of primordial rituals come into practise.\n\nThe last night of October has come to be known as Hallowe'en in the English language for many years, but it is in Ireland that many of these traditions originate. The night before the beginning of winter, as the first of November is in the Irish calendar, was the end of the harvest season and the start of the darkening of the days. Officially, All Saints' Day is the 1st of November, and is recognised by the Catholic Church as a Holy Day of Obligation, with all Catholics expected to attend Mass, and with All Souls' Day the day after. But this is only the Church taking advantage of the more ancient, arcane and local pre-Christian beliefs of the population.\n\nGhoulish faces are carved into turnips, with candles fitted and lit inside to give them an otherworldly aura. People roam the countryside between distant homesteads, clad in imitation of the very beings also said to be present that night, themselves expecting to be placated with food and drink in exchange for song or verse. The dead are remembered and toasts held in their honour.\n\nSimilar customs exist elsewhere, but in particular the Gaelic traditions have taken root in the United States, following the mass exodus that has occurred over the last century. There they have taken up many of their own forms, which themselves have travelled back to Ireland via returning immigrants.\n\nCelebrations this year themselves have taken an even more macabre turn, with tensions rising around the world, and with the United States, the new home of many Irish people and the land of opportunity, up in flames.

 irelandflavour.3812.d1:9 "Theatre in Ireland has long served as a proud cultural touchstone for the nation, and especially in recent years, as a form of escapism from the troublesome situation of the world. Political violence has unfortunately also been a major part of the nation's history, and last night at the Abbey Theatre these two worlds collided after riots broke out at the debut of a new overtly political play known as \"The Star Turns Red\".\n\nThe playwright behind the production, Seán O'Casey, has always been unapologetically open about his socialist beliefs, and this recent play is no different. One of O'Casey's previous plays \"The Plough and the Stars\" has often been interpreted as criticism of overvaluing Irish nationalism at the expense of the working class, leading initially to calls for it to be censored, and ultimately a riot broke out at a performance over the perceived insult to Irish identity. Likewise, \"The Star Turns Red\" has been interpreted by some as an attack against the fundamentals of Irish identity, the Catholic Church, and modern Irish politics. The protagonist of the play, \"Red Jim\", who is very clearly inspired by Irish socialist leader Jim Larkin, leads his union into the eventual takeover of his country while battling the Catholic Church-backed \"Saffron Shirts\", interpreted as a parallel for O'Duffy's Blueshirts.\n\nAlthough police are still compiling a full picture of the events of last night, it appears that several members of the Blueshirts were in attendance, resulting in a brawl breaking out which quickly escalated into a riot. Like with O'Casey's last play to cause this level of unrest, there are calls to ban his play to keep the peace, with those aligned with O'Duffy going as far to call for O'Casey's arrest for producing \"a blasphemous piece of syndicalist propaganda\".\n\nWhile there is little reason to escalate matters this far, banning performances of the play may protect us from further incidents and the spread of syndicalist views. This degree of government censorship may however be seen by the public as a move towards further authoritarianism, and it may make sense to approach this situation more carefully by only having a few ministers officially condemn the play instead."
 irelandflavour.3812.d2:9 "Ever since the dust settled on the corpse of the old order in Britain, Ireland has had to deal with jumped-up syndicalist playwrights and poets from across the Sea producing propaganda, in the hopes it will one day lead to a socialist revolution here as well. While it is easy to ignore all of these plays written by British authors, the same cannot be said about a betrayal of a play produced by one of our own.\n\nSeán O'Casey, a noted Irish playwright who has always been unapologetically open about his socialist beliefs, recently debuted his new play \"The Star Turns Red\" at the Apollo Theatre in London, after being rightfully blocked from having it performed at the Abbey Theatre in Dublin. The central conflict of the play revolves around the protagonist \"Red Jim\", a stand-in for Irish socialist leader Jim Larkin, leading his union into the eventual takeover of his country while battling the Catholic Church-backed \"Saffron Shirts\", a clear parallel for the Blueshirts. The play concludes with a dedication to the \"brave workers\" of Ireland, who they claim \"will soon be freed from reactionary oppression\".\n\nDespite being shown only in London, news of this blatant attack by a traitorous syndicalist quickly reached the office of a furious [IRE_loc_leader_surname] in Leinster House. Not long afterwards, a statement was officially released denouncing O'Casey's play as \"an indecent and blasphemous piece of syndicalist propaganda\", labelling the man himself as a traitor, and banning all of his works from being performed again in Ireland. Despite it still being unclear if the British government supported O'Casey in any way, an arrest warrant has still been issued against him for conspiring with the British state to overthrow the organs of the Irish Government, effectively exiling him from the country. With [IRE_loc_leader_surname]'s continued anger over the incident, O'Casey should consider himself lucky that he has gotten off so \"lightly\"."

The recent debut of an exciting new play entitled \"The Star Turns Red\" has been the perfect excuse for such a break, with multiple prominent members of the new government attending the performance at the Abbey Theatre.\n\nThe playwright behind the production, Seán O'Casey, has always been unapologetically open about his socialist beliefs, and the recent revolution in Ireland has clearly been an inspiration for his latest work, with many noticing obvious parallels between its plot and the events of recent months. The central conflict of the play revolves around a general strike orchestrated by the protagonist of the play \"Red Jim\", who leads his union into the eventual takeover of his country while battling against the Catholic Church-backed \"Saffron Shirts\", interpreted as a parallel for O'Duffy's Blueshirts. The play concludes with a dedication to the brave workers who took part in the Second Irish Revolution, and many are widely regarding the production as a shining example of syndicalist performance art.\n\nAmong those praising the contents of the new play was one Jim Larkin, who O'Casey has known for decades now and is proud to call a friend. Following the production he was heard expressing his enjoyment of the new play to the other members of government present, especially praising the performance given by the lead actor who he described as \"truly portrayed the socialist spirit of Ireland\".

Throughout his working life, he had promoted Irish culture and mythology, and stressed an Irish identity that was completely separate from a British one. His greatest personal achievement was winning a Nobel Prize in Literature in 1923 for his poetry; coming at a heady time for Yeats, who had just witnessed the birth of an independent Ireland, something he had long supported. In 1922 he was appointed a member of the Senate, and spent the next several years experiencing first-hand the politics of the new state. Although during his time as senator Yeats was not affiliated with any party, not even Sinn Féin, he was not afraid to make his political views known, and was firm in the Senate in voicing his opinion on cultural and educational matters. Yeats offered a unique perspective, as he not only spoke as an artist, but also as someone who was both a Protestant and a nationalist.\n\nIn the final years of his life, Yeats became an informal supporter of Aontas Náisiúnta, drawn both to the firm paternalistic stances of Eoin O'Duffy and the mystic nationalism of Gearoid Ó Cuinneagáin. Yeats had always grated against individualism and liberalism, and the increasing influence of both upon Sinn Féin greatly displeased him. While AN were greatly pleased to learn of a supporter of Yeats' calibre, they were disappointed that they were never able to truly utilise his presence outside of Yeats creating three marching songs for the organisation.\n\nAlthough Yeats is now gone, his legacy will be long-lasting and regardless of his political views, most can acknowledge his sizable contributions to Irish cultural life."

The song, with words written by Peadar Kearney, and music by him and Patrick Heaney, first emerged in 1910, with the now-widespread lyrics in Irish being published by Liam Ó Rinn in 1923. It follows a long tradition of emotive patriotic songs, speaking of an Ireland from long ago that now calls again to be defended against her enemies and oppressors. Making the composition all the more meaningful however, was its popularity among the Irish Volunteers leading up to 1916, and later in the Frongoch prison camp where many were interned afterwards, to the extent that it was unofficially known as the \"Sinn Féin anthem\".\n\nWhat began life as a jaunty marching song has reconstructed into a stirring national anthem. This has been helped in no small part by the reworking of the song for full orchestra, and also for marching band, as well as chorus, transforming the song and adding an appropriate amount of gravitas, depending on the occasion.\n\nYet, as with all things in a relatively newly independent country such as Ireland, there are questions which overhang it. As a piece of music that is profoundly and unashamedly associated with the nationalist tradition, some have doubted its ability to act as an olive branch to those who may have originally been, or remain, loyalists. Others feel that the official status of the Irish language translation, despite the song being originally written in English, is off-putting to poor speakers of the language, or that the melody is suitable but the lyrics lacklustre. Yet others agree with all of the sentiment of the song, but feel that there are older, potentially more legitimate anthems to be found in the plethora of pieces that make up the Irish musical tradition.\n\nThe obvious answer would be to leave it unchanged, but it is up to the government to decide the final decision."

With Gaelic football's ties to Irish nationalism, many Ulster Protestants instead veered towards soccer, and indeed, upon the foundation of the League of Ireland, all the teams were from Ulster and only one team, Belfast Celtic, was associated with Catholics. However, this stark divide has been dissolving over the decades, with the glamour and prestige of the World Cup helping to draw a more diverse base into the game. Not only have new teams emerged from Dublin and Cork but also smaller Irish towns such as Dundalk, Limerick, Waterford and Sligo, with the \"Sligo Rovers\" becoming the first team outside of Leinster or Ulster to win the league this year.\n\nThe popularity of the league was also boosted by a small influx of players arriving from Britain, particularly from Scotland and the Liverpool area, as professional teams in the Union were scrapped and reorganised on a large scale, to reflect a nominally more egalitarian makeup with the rise of \"work teams\" and other amateur clubs. Now featuring a healthy mix of players from around the Isles and a range of teams from across Ireland, the League of Ireland has become an avenue for football supporters from different parts of the country to intermingle.

 irelandflavour.393.d4:9 "One of the most important teachings of Marx is that class is more important than culture or religion — for example, Protestant and Catholic workers share much more in common than a poor Catholic and a rich Catholic do. An area where this phenomenon becomes apparent is in sports.\n\nAlthough our island has been plagued by sectarianism for centuries, in recent decades both Protestants and Catholics of the working class found common ground by playing and watching Association Football, or \"Soccer\", together. Although the inherent good of athleticism and community-building was apparent, the capitalists sought to commodify it. Instead of taking a wholesome amateur approach like in Gaelic Games, the British-aligned bourgeois encouraged \"professionalism\" in Irish soccer. While players were paid a salary (which was acceptable), they were also treated as commodities who could be bought and sold between teams like cattle at marts. Instead of teams of locals, who could be proudly supported by friends and neighbours, the ranks of soccer teams became those of strangers and mercenaries.\n\nNow that we have a socialist leadership in this country, the time has come to follow the example set in Britain and France and to re-organise soccer. Teams will be based around workplaces or professions, not owners. With soccer organised in this way, not only can it be a tool to encourage fitness, but it can help destroy sectarianism as well."

As the Irish were regaining their pride in their long-suppressed language and culture during the Gaelic Revival, the efforts of Celtologists, primarily German, such as Pokorny and the deceased Kuno Meyer in rediscovering old Irish literature and promoting its importance to European civilisation were beyond invaluable in this process, becoming another episode in the warm Teuto-Irish relationship.\n\nIrish contact with the Teutonic world goes back to the era when Ireland was acclaimed for its knowledge and Christian faith, with Irish monks founding monasteries throughout modern-day Germany and Austria. In later centuries as the British tightened their grip over the isle many Irishmen chose exile, and though the Irish played a part in the industralisation of the Ruhr, no German land would receive more émigrés than Austria, where the Irish established a major presence in the country's military and politics, with over a hundred Austrian generals, field marshals or admirals at one point being Irish.

Historically small bands of roving hunter-warriors made up of landless young noblemen, they are most well known from the tales of the mythological hero Fionn mac Cumhaill, the leader of a group of Fianna who based themselves in a fortress atop the Hill of Allen in Kildare, north of the Curragh where an Irish military base lies in the present day. Although Fionn and most of his valiant followers would be tragically slain in the Battle of Gabhra by the forces of the High King Cairbre Lifechair, who himself would also fall in the fighting at the hand of Fionn's grandson Oscar, and a rival Fianna clan led by Goll mac Morna, their gallant legacy has lived on in Irish culture.\n\nAs the Irish people regained their pride in their ancient heritage during the Gaelic Revival, the valour and martial prowess of the Fianna became inspirational for countless Irish revolutionaries, with nationalist organisations such as the Fenian Brotherhood and Fianna Éireann taking them as their namesake, and Amhrán na bhFiann and the IRA's cap badge referring to Ireland's soldiery as the \"Fianna Fáil\", meaning the Warriors of Inis Fáil, an old poetic name for the island.\n\nHowever, while the Irish Republican Army can trace their roots to this warrior-band tradition, it additionally finds expression in the form of paramilitarism."

 irelandflavour.3910.d1:9 "Il est simplement connu sous le nom de drapeau tricolore, de « an trídhathach » ou encore de « bratach na hÉireann ». Commandé pour la première fois en 1848 par Thomas Francis Meagher à Waterford City, républicain irlandais et plus tard gouverneur du Montana, il fut cousu pour lui par un groupe de Françaises favorables à la cause nationaliste irlandaise, à une époque où la France était elle-même secouée par la Révolution.\n\nLe symbolisme voulu par Meagher et son inspiration du drapeau tricolore français sont restés inchangés dans leur interprétation. Vert pour la tradition gaélique et les catholiques romains, et orange pour les protestants adeptes de Guillaume d'Orange, célèbre vainqueur de la bataille de la Boyne en 1690, qui a conduit à l'enracinement de l'ascendance protestante. Et blanc, représentant l’espoir éternel de paix et d’unité entre les deux traditions. Le motif tricolore du drapeau est bien sûr riche en associations avec les idéaux de républicanisme, de liberté et de révolution.\n\nBien qu'il ait existé pendant près de quatre-vingts ans, il faisait partie de l'imaginaire populaire mais restait à l'arrière-plan de la conscience publique pendant la majeure partie de son existence, ne grandissant rapidement qu'avec le GPO, en 1916. Depuis, il est devenu le symbole du républicanisme irlandais, et peu après, de l’Irlande elle-même.\n\nIl compte peu de détracteurs. Certains diront qu’il est inutile de représenter un groupe de personnes, c’est-à-dire des protestants loyalistes, sur le drapeau d’une République dont, dans des circonstances normales, ils ne voudraient pas faire partie. Les critiques nationalistes les plus radicaux soulignent que les loyalistes représentent un tiers du drapeau, alors même que leur nombre est plus proche d'un simple sixième de la population. Cependant, pour la grande majorité des gens, y compris le gouvernement, c'est un symbole de l'Irlande, aussi ambitieux soit-il, et l'une des rares questions politiques sur lesquelles presque tout le monde peut s'entendre."
 irelandflavour.3910.d2:9 "Tout comme la harpe a été autrefois remplacée par le drapeau tricolore comme symbole de l'Irlande, ce vieux chiffon, avec ses connotations religieuses, a également été démoli au profit d'un autre véritable capable d'unir le peuple irlandais, la Charrue Etoilée.

Même si on pensait autrefois qu'il avait pris feu avec le bâtiment sur lequel il flottait lorsque les forces de la couronne britannique ont pris la ville, il fut en réalité récupéré par TA Williams, un soldat britannique qui le garda comme trophée, et après la Seconde Révolution Irlandaise, localisé et remis en gage de l'amitié ravivée entre les deux nations. Il est actuellement fièrement exposé au Musée national.\n\nAu lendemain de la Révolution Britannique, alors que les syndicalistes irlandais, poignardés dans le dos par les nationalistes bourgeois des ailes pro-traité et anti-traité du Sinn Féin, se sont réunis pour réorganiser l'Armée Citoyenne Irlandaise afin de renverser un jour les faux héritiers du républicanisme irlandais et concrétiser les véritables idéaux de la révolution irlandaise, un nouveau design a été adopté, basé sur les souvenirs des vétérans de l'ICA, en bleu et plus minimaliste.

 irelandflavour.3912.d.body:9 "Né sur les îles d'Aran, de langue irlandaise, au large de la côte ouest, Tom a passé la majeure partie de ses premières années chez lui, avant de partir en Amérique en 1912, où il a commencé à travailler comme journaliste. Son jeune frère Liam avait cherché à devenir prêtre et, en 1908, il s'est rendu sur le continent, où il est finalement devenu un membre militant des Volontaires Irlandais.\n\nLorsque la Weltkrieg a éclaté, Tom avait commencé à organiser les travailleurs irlandais sur les quais de Boston et de New York pour rejoindre l'Internationale Ouvrière Mondiale, loin de la guerre. Liam, de son côté, voyait la guerre comme une opportunité, reconnaissant que les Irlandais auraient besoin d'une expérience militaire pour se débarrasser du joug britannique. Il s'est donc enrôlé dans l'armée de l'oppresseur sous un faux nom. Il rentra chez lui après la guerre, blessé et sous le choc, mais immensément fier des nouvelles qu'il allait bientôt entendre concernant la guerre d'indépendance irlandaise et la Révolution prolétarienne française. Les horreurs de la guerre avaient fait de lui un socialiste, tout comme les souffrances du prolétariat américain avaient motivé son frère. Tous deux étaient initialement partisans du Sinn Féin, mais à présent des membres fondateurs du Parti Syndicaliste Irlandais de Roddy Connolly.\n\nEn 1920, les frères renouent à Boston et commencent à développer une forte passion pour l'écriture. Tom s'intéressait déjà à la littérature prolétarienne, tandis que Liam était attiré par la machine à écrire pour avoir de quoi l'aider à faire face à la guerre et pour enregistrer les récits de ses voyages. Bien qu’il soit plus jeune et plus novice dans ce domaine, Liam en a rapidement fait une carrière. Ses histoires traitaient davantage des mondes du symbolisme, de la métaphore et de la satire, tandis que les écrits de Tom restaient fondés sur une rhétorique politique brutale et, après son propre retour en Irlande en 1934, sur des observations banales de la vie rurale. Tom n'a réussi à publier que quelques histoires avant sa mort en 1936, laissant Liam poursuivre désormais la lutte de son frère aîné, à la fois dans le monde de l'écriture et dans la révolution mondiale."

 irelandflavour.3913.d:9 "Aujourd'hui, le gouvernement a reçu des appels pour faire une déclaration officielle concernant le prochain congrès panceltique, qui aura lieu prochainement sur l'île de Man. Le mouvement panceltique est un mouvement marginal, appelant à une coopération renforcée, à des échanges culturels et à une compréhension mutuelle entre les peuples « celtiques », à savoir ceux d’Irlande, d’Écosse, de l’île de Man, du Pays de Galles, de Cornouailles et de Bretagne. L'idée des « Celtes » en tant que race distincte, par opposition à différents groupes de personnes parlant un groupe de langues apparentées, a pris racine dans les années 1800 avec les progrès de la linguistique, mais reste un sujet de débat scientifique.\n\nBien que de facto apolitique, il n’est pas surprenant que de nombreux participants au Congrès plaident en faveur de l’indépendance, ou du moins de l’autonomie, de leurs nations respectives. Ils estiment que les Celtes sont une race ancienne et partagent une solidarité les uns avec les autres dans leur conviction d'avoir été marginalisé par les Français et les Anglais qui les ont forcés à vivre à la limite de leurs terres respectives, sur la façade de l'Atlantique Nord, et marginalisé leurs langues, qui ont parfois failli disparaître. Cependant, pour la plupart des participants au Congrès, c'est un beau jour, pleine de chansons et d'histoires. La soirée est ponctuée par la présentation des styles et traditions musicales respectives de chaque nation, avec des chansons partageant souvent des origines communes, se réunissant dans des arrangements simultanés pour former une sorte de symphonie celtique.\n\nMême les nationalistes irlandais les plus radicaux n’ont jamais visé un État celtique unifié, et encore moins un État celtique dirigé par les Irlandais, car, indépendamment du débat sur le point de départ et d’arrivée de cet État, ou de l’absence relative d’une identité commune, la lutte pour l'indépendance seule était jugée suffisante. Néanmoins, l'idée d'une certaine forme de parenté celtique, aussi ténue soit-elle, présente un attrait romancé susceptible de rassembler au sein des différentes sensibilités politiques, et la délégation officielle de l'État a été bien accueillie par les différents participants du Congrès."

 irelandflavour.3914.d.start:9 "Ce jour-là, il y a 180 ans, Arthur Guinness signait le bail de 9 000 ans pour les locaux qui allaient devenir la brasserie St. James's Gate de [Root.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. C'est aujourd'hui la plus grande au monde. Sa marque est étroitement associée à l'Irlande depuis de nombreuses années, notamment en raison de la similitude du logo Guinness avec les armoiries de l'Irlande, mais la réputation de synonymie au cours de la dernière décennie a atteint un point tel que de nombreux écrivains en sont venus à la décrire comme quasi emblématique de l’Irlande moderne.\n\nLa famille Guinness, ou à l'origine Mac Aonghusa puis Magennis, était un ancien clan gaélique, et l'un des très rares à s'être converti à l'anglicanisme au moment de la Réforme. Leur intégration complète au sein de la cohorte anglo-irlandaise qui a gouverné l’Irlande pendant la majeure partie des cent dernières années, leur a offert de nombreux avantages en nature, en richesse et en prestige.\n\nPendant un certain temps, leur succès fut un symbole de prospérité et d'industrie anglo-irlandaise, et leur bière brune devint populaire dans toute l'Irlande mais aussi au sein de l'Empire Britannique, dans son ensemble. Profitant de cette relation, contrairement à la plupart des Irlandais, les Guinness sont devenus d'éminents syndicalistes, désireux de maintenir et d'étendre leur succès commercial à l'avenir.\n\nBien que la Révolution Britannique ait été un choc pour sa clientèle principale, l'entreprise a, d'une manière ou d'une autre, étendu son marché en toute transparence à la Mitteleuropa, où l'Irlande, éloignée des anciens Britanniques et plus proche de la plus grande sphère d'influence allemande, a amené la bière à devenir quelque peu tendance, ou voire chic sur le continent. Ce changement a été considéré par beaucoup comme un symbole de la place de l'Irlande dans le monde en tant que nation indépendante – une nation qui a remplacé l'ancien par le nouveau, mais qui a néanmoins conservé une grande partie d'elle-même."
 irelandflavour.3914.d1:9 "$irelandflavour.3914.d.start$\n\nLa bière continue de connaître un grand succès, en Suisse et à l'étranger. Malgré sa nouvelle popularité sur le continent, certaines tendances anglophiles de ses propriétaires subsistent, bien que de manière atténuées, dans la mesure où la bière est toujours très demandée pour les expéditions vers ce qui reste de l'Empire Britannique, reliant d'une certaine façon le passé de l'Irlande à son présent et son avenir."
 irelandflavour.3914.d2:9 "$irelandflavour.3914.d.start$\n\nLa popularité constante de la bière dans le pays et à l'étranger est reconnue dans la mesure où, malgré les allégations selon lesquelles les travailleurs protestants seraient fortement favorisés par rapport à leurs collègues catholiques de St. James's Gate et les anciens liens de la famille avec le camp loyaliste, l'entreprise est tolérée par [IRE_loc_leader_surname] et par son gouvernement. Censurer l'entreprise ou limiter la production nuirait à la réputation internationale de l'Irlande, et l'affichage d'une certaine tolérance à son égard peut être démontré par le nouveau gouvernement comme un signe de bienveillance et de continuité assurée. L'affection que O'Duffy lui porte est bien sûr de notoriété publique, mais ce n'est pas la question."
 irelandflavour.3914.d3:9 "$irelandflavour.3914.d.start$\n\nThe brand is one that is known throughout the world, but is one of conflicting thoughts for the government. The Guinness family indeed to originally have Gaelic roots, and even if their conversion to Anglicanism can be tolerated, their former loyalty to Britain and ongoing Anglophilic sympathies are considered a nuisance at best, if not quite so apparent as the name of the brand itself. The act of the antecedents of the company's owners to adopt an anglicised version of their surname is one that has personally bothered Ó Cuinnegáin, who has publicly declared his consideration for forcing the company to rename itself or face nationalisation. For the moment though, they are free to call themselves as they wish, but within a few years it may be a distinct possibility."
 irelandflavour.3914.d4:9 "$irelandflavour.3914.d.start$\n\nThe popularity of the drink among the workers of Britain never faded, and Ireland's joining of the Internationale has been met with a rekindled interest in the beer in its neighbouring island. The highly-publicised, and fairly successful, transfer of ownership of the company from the Guinness family to its workers is one that has been held extensively by the government as evidence of both their organisationsal competence, but also non-discriminatory outlook, considering the workers at St. James's Gate are by far majority Protestant, despite the denomination being held by a minority of Dubliners. Regardless of ownership however, the name of the brand remains, and as it travelled across the British Empire, so shall it travel to workers on all corners of the globe."

 irelandflavour.400.d:9 "The outbreak of war, long seen by many as inevitable, has nonetheless brought on a time of deep uncertainty on the population. At a time when there are existential threats to the nation itself, people have been seeking solace from the current realities in a variety of sources. For much of the population, such repose is found in their faith.\n\nIn a series of radio broadcasts, an academic from Belfast has caught the attention of listeners, with a compendium of short lectures based around Christianity. Presented in fifteen-minute segments, the presenter attempts to lay down his thoughts on topics such as morality and existence, exploring ideas like \"right and wrong\", and \"human nature\", while tying the theme discussed into how it is explored in Christian teaching.\n\nThe presenter, a lecturer in Queen's University Belfast named C.S. Lewis, has been lauded for his direct, conversational approach in making the content accessible to the lay person, and also his ecumenical manner speaking of Christianity as a whole, so as not to alienate any particular denomination. Born to Church of Ireland parents in Belfast, Lewis lost his faith in his teenage years, before being reintroduced to Christianity by his close friend, South Africa-based author J.R.R. Tolkien. His university career in Britain ended upon the British Revolution and his return to Ireland, but not before his eventual conversion to Catholicism.\n\nHis broad appeal, with many non-believers among his listeners, has been noted by the government, who have continued his short weekly radio segment on RTÉ after originally intending it to be a one-off, in the interest of the public morale it has generated. Lewis has expressed an interest in greater levels of public engagement in the future, potentially transcribing these lectures into a book, or even entering the realm of fictional literature, but for the moment he finds the broadcasts are enough of the limelight."

 irelandflavour.411.d.late:9 "While Joyce was initially counted openly alongside Ireland's literary greats, he later courted controversy and consequentially soured official opinion. During the Weltkrieg, Joyce resided in Switzerland, where he worked vigorously on \"Ulysses\", a novel set in Dublin paralleling Homer's epic. Joyce, however, was unable to publish his novel for years after finishing it, and relocated to the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Time and again, \"Ulysses\" was rejected for publication the world over.\n\nJoyce was finally able to publish the novel in his native Ireland during a period of liberalisation which followed the British Revolution, and consequently settled in Dublin to much fanfare. However, despite the immediate acclaim for \"Ulysses\", it was eventually withdrawn from publication. Joyce then found himself facing a number of lawsuits over both the book's contents and his personal conduct, and the author fled Ireland for the Commune of France to avoid them.\n\nThough Joyce identified as a socialist, he rarely expressed his political opinions in public, even after taking up residence in syndicalist France. Nonetheless, his mere presence there proved an embarrassment for Dublin, and Paris knew it. More than once, the author was the subject of some not-so-offhand comment by some Communard politician or another."

Vastly outmanned and outgunned by the British Army, Ireland's sons fought on for six days until nearly all were captured or killed. The execution without trial of most of the remaining leaders had a massive impact on Irish politics, and the level of popular support it brought to Irish independence was profound.\n\nThough free Ireland did not initially commemorate the Rising in a governmental capacity, that changed after the British Revolution and its subsequent repercussions on several aspects of the Anglo-Irish Treaty. Now, the Irish Government recognises the Easter Rising as the first battle of the armed struggle for independence that culminated in the end of seven hundred years of British rule.\n\nConcomitant with that, the cities and towns of Ireland now swell with Independence Day festivities on each 24th of April, and the President gives an official address outside of the General Post Office in Dublin where Pádraig Pearse first proclaimed the Irish Republic."

 ireland.4000.d.election:9 "Elections were held in the Irish Republic. The island nation, which won its independence from the British Empire in the wake of the Weltkrieg, was said to have achieved economic growth and security by entering Mitteleuropa, but has found itself thrown into turmoil the past year by Black Monday. As a result, the run-up to the election was the most antagonistic the Irish have had yet."
 ireland.4000.d:9 "$ireland.4000.d.election$\nDespite this bitter atmosphere, the incumbent Michael Collins, credited by much of the Irish public with being responsible for their victory during the Anglo-Irish War, has secured re-election. His party, Sinn Féin, is expected to continue its confidence-and-supply with the loyalist Ulster Democratic Party and maintain its approach of national liberalism combined with strict law-and-order measures aimed at combatting radicalism."

 ireland.4007.d2:9 "Over the past year since the National Guard overthrew the government of the Irish Republic, the new regime has been subject to internal factionalism. This came to a head after a massacre of British loyalists in the northern province of Ulster led to an upsurge in terrorism, leading to an uprising by ultranationalists inspired by Portuguese integralism.\nHowever, the Irish army, after crushing the integralist rebellion, placed Irish dictator O'Duffy under arrest with diplomatic support from Germany.

 ireland.4009.d:9 "When Black Monday arrived in Ireland, it appeared to many that the Irish war hero and elder statesman Michael Collins had overstayed his welcome. But in the years since he has managed to prove his critics wrong, deftly handling not just the financial crisis but also domestic turmoil while promoting cooperation with the opposition.\n\nThese efforts to unify the country have borne fruit as with the arrival of war to Ireland's shores, the Irish have formed a wartime coalition government consisting of Collins' Sinn Féin, their ally the Ulster Democratic Party and main opposition party An Saorstát Críostuil, intended to last for the duration of the conflict. While smaller parties protest their non-incusion in this alliance, it is expected that this will help to rally the Irish public around the war effort."

Afterwards, a compromise was reached by John J. O'Kelly bridging the gap between the two warring factions and bringing the Christian democratic opposition party Saorstat Criostuil into government to shore up legitimacy. While a facade of democracy has been restored, it is most likely to remain strongly illiberal and biased in favour of the establishment."

As expected by most, the left-wing coalition government which successfully navigated and resolved both Black Monday and the controversial issue of the Ulster Privileges in the previous four years has been re-elected, but with an unexpected twist as the pacifist socialist Progressive Labour Party surpassed their socially democratic forebears.\n\nIndicative of a seismic shift in attitudes from the country's former conservatism, it is likely that the government will continue to push for egalitarian social and economic reforms under the coalition's radical new leadership while promoting renewed relations with the Internationale."
 ireland.4013.d2:9 "Elections were held in the Irish Republic today. The defeat of Germany, once regarded as Ireland's biggest ally and protector, to the forces of the Third Internationale has come as a dramatic blow to the Irish people and brought about a seismic shift in opinions among the populace, resulting in the surprise victory of a left-wing coalition led by the pacifist socialist Progressive Labour Party.\n\nThis has been met with shock by many given the formerly widespread conservative and anti-syndicalist views of the Irish public, but while some credit it to the ideals of socialism finding their way to Ireland in light of their ascendancy in Europe, others have also attributed fear of a syndicalist invasion should the nation not fall in line to the socialist coalition government's unexpected triumph."

 ireland.6000.t:9 "Irish Investment Proposal"
 ireland.6000.d1:9 "An interesting proposal has been received this morning from the small nation of Ireland, requesting an economic investment from our nation. With many investors still shaken by the aftermath of Black Monday and the conflict in America, the Irish wish to present Dublin as a new stable home for international business and commerce.\n\nIf this promise of stability holds true, establishing new branches of [Root.GetAdjective] businesses in Ireland's capital may prove to be a mutually beneficial endeavour for all involved parties. It is important however to take into consideration that this upfront cost may not pay off in the long run, and so an informed decision be made as to how we should respond."
 ireland.6000.d2:9 "A very unusual proposal has arrived this morning through the medium of diplomats sent by the small nation of Ireland. Despite the obvious conflict between the capitalist nature of their regime and the socialist vision of [Root.GetNameDef] they still have chosen to request [Root.GetAdjective] investment in Dublin as part of their attempts to build an international hub of business and investment.\n\nWhile involvement in a capitalist scheme such as this would normally be alien to a socialist nation, a state ran trading corporation could still be established to facilitate business with the Irish and improve relations with them. The decision on if this is worth the trouble however must now be made."
 ireland.6000.a:9 "Tell our friends in Dublin we agree to their proposal."
 ireland.6000.b:9 "We see little to gain from this fruitless partnership."

 ireland.6001.t:9 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Has Refused Our Proposal"
 ireland.6001.d:9 "Unfortunately despite the best efforts of the diplomats sent to [From.GetNameDef] it seems that they have returned home empty handed with no agreement having been made regarding investment in Dublin. Perhaps if a larger effort was made in improving Irish-[From.GetAdjective] relations beforehand success may have been found.\n\nRegardless there is no point dwelling on the past, and it is important to look now to future investment opportunities instead."
 ireland.6001.a:9 "Such a shame."

 ireland.6002.t:9 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Has Agreed!"
 ireland.6002.d.AUS:9 "The delegates returning from the Alps have brought with them an investment from the automotive manufacturer \"Austro-Daimler\". Their planned Dublin office will allow them to expand the reach of their business to Western Europe, and potentially be a staging point for expansion into America. The Irish economy will particularly benefit from another competitor in the ever-growing automotive industry."
 ireland.6002.d.BEL:9 "The trade delegation sent to [BEL.GetNameDef] has come back successful with a deal from the chemical and pharmaceutical company \"Solvay\". Ireland's economy is lacking in this area and Solvay's Dublin office will be a great addition to Ireland's growing business portfolio and could perhaps be the start to a massive expansion of pharmaceutical manufacturing in Ireland. This office will particularly be of great benefit to the growing number of university graduates with qualifications in the pharmacological and chemical sciences."
 ireland.6002.d.BUL:9 "The delegation sent to [BUL.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] has returned with wonderful news. Following a round of talks, the state owned armaments factory \"VMZ Sopot\" has agreed to open a branch in Dublin to help facilitate trade and shipping routes to Western and Central Europe. With conflict never being far away, the armaments industry is often a stable one, and this should bring another source of steady employment for Irish workers for years to come."
 ireland.6002.d.CAN:9 "Despite some objections regarding historical bad blood, a trade delegation was sent to Canada that managed to secure an investment from the agricultural equipment manufacturer \"Massey-Harris\", and a commitment from them regarding the opening a new office in Dublin. Irish farmers have made use of their equipment in recent years, allowing for a significant expansion in agricultural production. The farmers in particular will be happy with the new Dublin office allowing for quicker customer support, part replacement orders, and new opportunities in employment. "
 ireland.6002.d.CHN:9 "With the government of [CHN.GetLeader] having finally managed to reunite China once more, it is the perfect time for a trade delegation to have been sent. Following their discussions with representatives in [CHN.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], an agreement has been reached with the \"Fushun Refinery\" to establish an office in Dublin, who wish to have a closer base of operations for securing European oil imports. With a united China likely to grow to become a major economic power, securing these ties this early will surely benefit Ireland in the long term."
 ireland.6002.d.CSA:9 "The recent civil war in America has been a big shake-up to global business, especially with the victors being as anti-capitalist as they are.\n\nNonetheless, they are not quite ready to abandon private enterprise yet, and our trade delegates were able to secure an investment from the consumer electronics giant \"General Electric\". In fact, they were rather quick in agreeing to establish a subsidiary in Dublin, the reasons for which are irrelevant as long as the Irish economy can reap the benefits. This large investment will have benefits all across Ireland from consumers, to workers, to business owners and more."
 ireland.6002.d.ENG:9 "Many have been sceptical of the move to send a trade delegation to the Union of Britain, but they may change their minds following the success of the negotiations.\n\nThough their economic system does not allow for such private enterprise, Ireland has benefited from relations with their \"trading corporation\" in the past. \"Marconi's Wireless Telegraph Company\", having previously established the first transatlantic telegraph from Ireland, has expressed an interest in expanding their operations and they have committed to the establishment of a new office in Dublin, under the watchful eye of the Anglo-Irish Trading Corporation of course. While the new investment is welcome, a close eye must be kept on any syndicalist influence seeping out and into the rest of Ireland."
 ireland.6002.d.FRA:9 "The trade delegation sent to the Communards in France has attracted much suspicion from the Irish public, but their fears will soon disappear as the benefits from this trip begin to show.\n\nThe steel mill \"Société Métallurgique de Normandie\", known for being a large exporter to Britain, Spain, and Italy, has expressed an interest in expanding into Ireland. The economic system in France does not allow for private enterprise like this, but the Communard's \"trading corporation\" that handles foreign trading relations in Western Europe has made a statement saying they will provide support to SMN's expansion. Their Dublin office will both expand their market and expand the options in steel production in Ireland. While a close eye will of course have to be kept on the Communards, this arrangement seems like it will be mutually beneficial for both nations."
 ireland.6002.d.GER:9 "The trade delegates have returned from Germany, and it is no surprise that their negotiations went very well. Due to the history of good trade relations with Germany, the delegates had no issue in securing a substantial commitment from the famous arms manufacturer Krupp.\n\nTheir new Dublin office will act as their hub for operations in Ireland, Britain, and as a first port of call for investors travelling from America. The world is increasingly becoming more hostile, and having a strong domestic armaments industry will help Ireland stay prepared should it need to defend itself. This significant investment will go a long way to making Dublin a global financial centre and Ireland a global finance competitor."
 ireland.6002.d.HOL:9 "The trade delegation sent to the Netherlands has come back with good news. Despite their diminished scope since the British revolution, \"Royal Dutch Shell\" has committed to the establishment of an office in Dublin. These new jobs will compliment the ever-growing demand for oil and its derivatives, as well as facilitating the expansion of Shell petrol stations across Ireland as automotive ownership increases. This Dutch gold will be a great boon to the Irish people."
 ireland.6002.d.italian:9 "The delegates returning from Italy bring with them an investment from the automotive giant \"FIAT\". They have announced plans to open an office in Dublin, and there have been discussions about a future manufacturing plant in Ireland. FIAT has dominated the Italian automotive market for decades and wasn't shaken at all by the syndicalist presence in their home of Turin. Their support in the Irish market will push Ireland's automotive industry forward and provide employment opportunities for a wide range of skilled and unskilled workers."
 ireland.6002.d.JAP:9 "Convincing the historically isolated Japanese to expand into new markets was difficult, but the delegates sent to Japan have come back successful. They have secured a commitment from the broad conglomerate \"Mitsubishi\" as they look to further diversify their company.\n\nTheir new Dublin office will be their first major investment into the European market and will allow to them to bring their services to millions of new customers. Their varied area of business will also bring a wide variety of jobs, benefiting all kinds of qualified workers. This investment will be particularly important in painting Dublin as a global financial hub."
 ireland.6002.d.SPA:9 "While some thought the trade delegates sent to Spain were merely getting a free holiday, the fruits of their labours prove otherwise.\n\nThe telecommunications company \"Compañía Telefónica Nacional de España\", or CTNE, has agreed to fund a subsidiary office in Dublin to facilitate the expansion of their network. They are particularly eager to make use of the transatlantic telecommunication cables stemming from the Irish coast.\n\nAs telephones become more common place in Irish households, CTNE's support will ensure a functioning and wide-reaching network. In addition, their Dublin office will provide a brand-new area of employment to the people and allow a further diversification of the Ireland's new financial capital."
 ireland.6002.d.american:9 "The delegation sent to America has been very successful in their negotiations, and secured an investment from the consumer electronics giant \"General Electric\". They plan to open an office in Dublin as they look to expand their operations throughout Ireland. As their business expands their scope, the benefits will be seen all across Ireland from consumers, to workers, to business owners and more."
 ireland.6002.d.GBPGBR:9 "Following the restoration of a syndicalism-free [From.GetName], the Irish Government was quick to re-establish good trade relations, not least to prevent any potential trade war from the new competing parties in Europe.\n\nIn particular, the recently reorganised \"RSAF Enfield\" has expressed an interest in constructing an office in Dublin. Whether they are worried about instability in [126.Owner.GetNameDef], or simply want to expand their business, the benefits to the Irish economy will be self-evident. A large English-speaking company like this will be particularly attractive to Irish workers and will certainly continue to display Dublin as the best place for finance investment."
 ireland.6002.d.FRPNFA:9 "Following the ousting of the Communards from Paris, many businesses have been looking to take advantage of their restored economic freedom and expand their reach.\n\nThe trade delegation sent to France secured a commitment from one such company, \"Renault\", who have been waiting patiently for an opportunity just like this. The major automotive and tank manufacturer has always been eager to expand its already large market share, and their new Dublin office will be a perfect chance to secure a new market. This office will provide new opportunities in employment as Ireland's automotive infrastructure continue to expand and will also secure Dublin as a new financial centre."
 ireland.6002.d.gen:9 "The trade delegation sent to [From.GetNameDef] has returned with fantastic news. Following a round of talks, they have managed to secure a commitment from a local company to open a subsidiary office in Dublin, with hopes that this will lead to a mutually beneficial arrangement for both parties. For Ireland this new office will hopefully in time bring jobs to the nation's people, tax income for the government, and will help build up the image of Dublin as a world financial capital."

 ireland.6003.d.mc:9 "$ireland.6003.d.start$\"When I was just simply a young man looking for my place in the world, one man stood above all others as an inspiration to both myself and countless others. In Arthur Griffith there was a mighty force in Ireland. He had none of the wildness of some I could name. Instead there was an abundance of wisdom and an awareness of things which are Ireland. When I grew old enough to begin serving our people, Griffith would become both an important mentor and friend, a man whose party I am proud to still lead to this day. Without Griffith's leadership and vision the entire existence of our great nation would be in doubt, and so we shall strive to never forget the legacy left to us by the father of our republic.\""
 ireland.6003.d.rm:9 "$ireland.6003.d.start$\"When our brave nation fought for its independence, there was one man who served as our guiding light, the great Arthur Griffith. It was Griffith who most fully painted in his weekly writings for us the traditions and the resources of Ireland, portrayed its mission and gave us for practical purposes our dream, our sense of work. When I fought for our nation's freedom, Griffith was always there to help in every way he could. When the Tans attempted to hunt down my men and I, Griffith could always be counted on to find us refuge. Without Griffith's leadership and vision the entire existence of our great nation would be in doubt, and so we shall strive to never forget the legacy left to us by the father of our republic.\""
 ireland.6003.d.start:9 "When discussing the great heroes of the Irish cause, there is one name that will often be conspicuously absent from the discussion, that of Sinn Féin's founder Arthur Griffith. Much like a modern-day Parnell, Griffith was at one point the de facto leader of Irish nationalism, fundamentally advancing the cause of freedom. Also much like Parnell, Griffith suffered from being sidelined in life, a life cut tragically all too short. While Parnell faded from relevance due to his impropriety, Griffith simply found himself a place in the sidelines as the Irish cause developed beyond him. His advocacy for the reversal of the Act of Union and the formation of a Dual Monarchy, inspired by Austria-Hungary, fell out of favour after the events of 1916, but seeing republicanism's rising tide and popular support, Griffith, the eternal pragamatist, had no problem in his party being used as a vehicle for independence. Always more an agitator than a leader, his role in the Treaty negotiations outshone his brief time as President, before his untimely death.\n\nWith time, as Parnell has come to be regarded as one of the greatest Irishmen in history, [IRE_loc_leader_name] has made it his mission to ensure that the same shall hold true for Griffith. Inviting many this morning to the front of Leinster House, where the statue of Queen Victoria once sat, [IRE_loc_leader_surname] unveiled a grand statue of Griffith in its place. Sculpted by Leo Broe, known for his Northside monument to the Irish Volunteers and his bust of Pádraig Pearse, the intention of elevating Griffith's memory alongside them is clear to most. Taking the stage following the reveal, [IRE_loc_leader_surname]'s speech left no room for doubt.\n\n"

Now in power and no longer united by their mutual hostility to the previous government, the party's two major factions are in open competition, as each seeks to establish absolute dominance over the nation.\n\nThe Old Guard, led by AN leader and President §PEoin O'Duffy§!, strive to bring about a corporatist and militaristic state which will discipline and unify the Republic against its foes, both internal and external. They are devoutly Catholic, with no love lost for Protestantism as a faith, and look upon all foreign influences with suspicion, whether German or Saxon.\n\nThe New Guard, led by Príomh Aire §NGearóid Ó Cuinneagáin§!, are inspired by the integralist ideals of Charles Maurras. Though more ecumenical and europhilic than the Old Guard, their vision is more radical, as they are driven by a fervent desire to revive the glory days of long before republicanism, when Ireland was truly Gaelic, and wipe out all traces of British rule.\n\nIn the middle of this dispute is AN vice-leader §gJohn J. O'Kelly§!, a veteran republican who has played a role in Irish politics since the year of Sinn Féin's founding.

 IRE_assess_bm:9 "Assess the Damage"
 IRE_assess_bm_desc:9 "With the initial trauma of Black Monday sinking in, the first step is to get a sense of just how bad the damage truly is. We will assemble a commission of economists and leading business interests in order to determine the extent of the depression we are experiencing, and also recommend policies going forward to begin pulling us out of the hole."
 IRE_emergency_taxes:9 "Emergency Taxes"
 IRE_emergency_taxes_desc:9 "With the crash in our earnings from foreign companies, we are facing a sharp expected decline in government revenue. To make up for this gap in the budget, proposals are being made to fill it with increased taxes on Irish citizens. One area in particular viewed with potential is introducing a land tax, a move which would bring a decent amount of revenue, but is likely to be extremely unpopular among rural voters, who it will likely penalise more."
 IRE_public_sector_austerity:9 "Impose Public Sector Austerity"
 IRE_public_sector_austerity_desc:9 "Austerity is never popular, but given the current economic situation and shortfalls in the budget, we need to balance the books somehow. We may be able to temporarily decrease spending and pause some services without causing too much of an upset, at least while the economic crisis continues."
 IRE_bail_out_northern_industries:9 "Renflouer les industries du Nord"
 IRE_bail_out_northern_industries_desc:9 "En tant que cœur industriel de l'Irlande, la perte des usines qui alimentent l'Ulster constituerait une menace dévastatrice pour notre viabilité économique future. Le gouvernement doit intervenir pour empêcher ces industries de faire faillite, et nous espérons ainsi nous aider à obtenir le soutien indispensable dans le Nord."
 IRE_organise_northern_relief_work:9 "Organise Northern Relief Work"
 IRE_organise_northern_relief_work_desc:9 "While we have taken steps to stave off a complete collapse of Northern industry, there are still vast scores of individuals left without a way to put food on the table as a result of the crash. Plans have been drafted to create a scheme of public works to provide a source of income for those that need it, while also hopefully helping to develop the region's infrastructure."
 IRE_subsidies_for_northern_landowners:9 "Subsidies for Northern Landowners"
 IRE_subsidies_for_northern_landowners_desc:9 "While a lot of focus is given towards the strain the crash has caused within northern industrial centres, the reality is that large landowners still hold a significant amount of influence in the north, particularly with loyalist politicians. Providing aid to struggling landowners would go a long way to keep the region on side and potentially open the door for tighter connections with the UDP."
 IRE_suppress_northern_industrial_action:9 "Suppress Northern Industrial Action"
 IRE_suppress_northern_industrial_action_desc:9 "In times such as these it is perhaps understandable that people would be swayed by ideologies promising all the answers, particularly given our proximity to one of Europe's leading syndicalist powers. Given the tense economic and social climate, these cancers cannot be allowed to develop; something the leadership both north and south agree on. With UDP support, steps will be taken to shut down and break up potential subversive activities and keep the North working."
 IRE_allay_northern_nationalists:9 "Allay Northern Nationalists"
 IRE_allay_northern_nationalists_desc:9 "In the wake of our attempts to keep the largely loyalist establishment in Ulster on side, many nationalists in the region have felt a growing unease that the measures put in place serve little purpose other than to keep one group on top. We cannot let such an idea gain root, and should try reaching out to northern nationalists to reassure them personally, whilst also ensuring relief measures see some benefit for their communities."
 IRE_support_northern_businesses:9 "Support Northern Businesses"
 IRE_support_northern_businesses_desc:9 "While many may complain about the focus the North has recieved since the crash, it is simply a fact that it is the most economically important region on the island. Supporting it is essentially in the national interest, as we will not be able to fund our further growth and recovery without the economic boost that it provides."
 IRE_stabilise_punt:9 "Stabilise the Punt"
 IRE_stabilise_punt_desc:9 "With the economic uncertainty, the value of our currency has begun to fluctuate rapidly, and such an situation is untenable if we want to have any chance at recovery. By taking steps to re-stabilise the punt, we can ensure our citizenry a degree of certainty which will go a long way to ensuring their support for our recovery programme."
 IRE_empower_central_bank:9 "Empower the Central Bank"
 IRE_empower_central_bank_desc:9 "While the country has begun the first steps to stabilise the national currency and finances, if we wish to truly begin on the road to recovery we must entrust the central bank to take any steps necessary. While some of their decisions will likely be unpopular, it would project an image of responsibility to the markets and potentially east the process of securing foreign loans."
 IRE_protect_southern_industries:9 "Protect Southern Industries"
 IRE_protect_southern_industries_desc:9 "While most associate Irish industry with the north, it would be remiss to ignore those which have managed to establish themselves outside of the north-east. It would be ridiculous to put all our eggs in one basket, to the detriment of the rest of the country. Therefore, we must work to support southern factories during this difficult period. Even if some in the North complain, they should remember the other five-sixths of Ireland exist too."
 IRE_emergency_agricultural_bailout:9 "Emergency Agricultural Bailouts"
 IRE_emergency_agricultural_bailout_desc:9 "For many Irish farmers who already struggled before Black Monday, this depression has pushed many over the edge. With many threatened with having to give up this way of life forever, it is vital that the government step in to prevent a complete collapse of rural society. While the costs may be great the risks of standing aside are still etched into the landscape from 1845."
 IRE_purchase_surplus_dairy:9 "Purchase Surplus Dairy Products"
 IRE_purchase_surplus_dairy_desc:9 "As global and domestic trade has slowed, many dairy producers have struggled to sell their stock as they previously did. This threatens to fuel a vicious cycling of downsizing operations and terminating contracts with farmers. To prevent such a situation, the government will temporarily step in and purchase extra dairy stocks. What to do with this \"government cheese\" remains to be seen, with one idea to potentially distribute it to struggling households."
 IRE_promote_beef_exports:9 "Promote Beef and Cattle Exports"
 IRE_promote_beef_exports_desc:9 "The fact is that the Irish internal market alone is not enough to support our significant cattle sector, with any profitability always maintaining an export component. While many countries are struggling in the wake of Black Monday, we must attempt to convince other nations in the merits of the Irish beef sector to keep even a fraction of the exports going."
 IRE_organise_rural_relief_work:9 "Organise Rural Relief Work"
 IRE_organise_rural_relief_work_desc:9 "While the measures implemented so far will go some ways to blunt the impact of the crash in the South, realistically it is only a bandage and will not help a significant portion of the population.

 IRE_raidio_eireann:9 "Launch Raidió Éireann"
 IRE_raidio_eireann_desc:9 "Our closest thing to a national radio broadcaster is a station known as Radio Athlone run by the post office. Its broadcast is subject to regular interference and reception issues owing to its weak and outdated transmitter. With the right investment, we can revitalise this radio station as \"Raidió Éireann\", a true public broadcaster for Ireland that will reach listeners all over the island with consistency and clarity."
 IRE_ore_institute:9 "Form the Irish Mineral & Ore Institute"
 IRE_ore_institute_desc:9 "Our natural resources may not be as vast as those found on the continent, but Ireland's few coal fields are famously easy to exploit, and our limited deposits of bauxite are in high demand to construct the new aluminium-based war machines. We are in need of a centrally-run board to manage and effectively extract these resources for the continued prosperity of the nation."
 IRE_modernised_equipment:9 "Modernised Machine Tools & Equipment"
 IRE_modernised_equipment_desc:9 "Following independence, Ireland has had to support its industry on its own and this had led to us progressing slower than we wouldd like and certainly slower than we need. It is time we modernise and invest in the latest machinery and equipment to kick-start our factories into a truly 20th century industrial mindset."
 IRE_urban_electrification:9 "Complete Urban Electrification"
 IRE_urban_electrification_desc:9 "Electricity first came to Ireland in 1880 with the first electric street lamp. Since then, the urban centres of Ireland have slowly been \"going on the electric\".

 IRE_support_aer_lingus:9 "Support Aer Lingus"
 IRE_support_aer_lingus_desc:9 "The newly founded national airline will need strong government support to expand and prosper.

 IRE_harland_wolff_loans_desc:9 "Harland & Wolff are world-renowned shipbuilders and have been a major employer in Belfast since their founding in 1861. However, since the disasters of the Olympic-class ships and the forced sale of their shipyards in Scotland they have been in a period of decline. Our generous loan will help revitalise the company and give Ireland a strong naval industry of its own."
 IRE_advanced_studies:9 "The Dublin Institute of Advanced Studies"
 IRE_advanced_studies_desc:9 "The idea of a dedicated research institute for Ireland has been floated on and off ever since the decline of Dunsink Observatory. Modelled after the institutes for advanced studies in America, DIAS would be Ireland's premier research institution for a variety of subjects ranging from astrophysics to Celtic studies. The founding of this institute will help Ireland stand alongside the intellectuals of Europe."

 IRE_breweries_distilleries_desc:9 "Irish beer and whiskey is enjoyed the world over and is arguably Ireland's most famous export.

 IRE_urbanisation:9 "Urban Expansion & Modernisation"
 IRE_urbanisation_desc:9 "Our urban centres are one of our greatest assets, and while they are the industrial centres of Ireland, they are falling behind the rapidly expanding cities of the continent. With massive investment in new housing, shops, and industries, the cities of Dublin and Belfast will stand alongside the great cities of Europe."
 IRE_development_bank:9 "The Éireann Development Bank"
 IRE_development_bank_desc:9 "The purpose of a development bank is to have a store of funds to invest in developing businesses, or assisting those in hard times. Black Monday has shown that Ireland needs her own safety net for businesses facing hardship and the Éireann Development Bank will be just that. With these additional funds, many struggling businesses across the island can get back on their feet, stronger than ever before."
 IRE_food_processing:9 "Develop a Food Processing Industry"
 IRE_food_processing_desc:9 "Currently we export a lot of our food raw and unprocessed, often to be packaged and sold abroad. Developing our own food processing industry will allow use to export higher value products that stay fresh longer, as well as lowering costs for our trade partners."

 IRE_ferguson_tractors_focus:9 "Subsidise Ferguson Tractors"
 IRE_ferguson_tractors_focus_desc:9 "Ferguson-Brown Company has been looking to re-enter the European market ever since they were forced out of Britain.

We can subsidise construction as an investment in our future partnership."
 IRE_mclaughlin_harvey:9 "Support McLaughlin & Harvey"
 IRE_mclaughlin_harvey_desc:9 "Established in 1853 just north of Belfast, McLaughlin & Harvey have long been the premier builders and contractors of the north.

Now being solely based in Ireland, we must support their enterprise to keep out construction projects running smoothly and efficiently"
 IRE_irish_american_investment:9 "Attract Irish-American Investment"
 IRE_irish_american_investment_desc:9 "The main appeal for Henry Ford's investment in his Cork plant was his ancestral link to Ireland.

 IRE_entrepreneurs:9 "Foster Homegrown Entrepreneurship"

 IRE_agrarianism:0 "Maintenir l'Agrarianisme"
 IRE_agrarianism_desc:9 "Ireland's agrarian sector is known across the world for its resilience and quality.

 IRE_decentralise_public_services_desc:9 "It may not seem like it, but Ireland is quite the diverse island in geography, culture, and demographics. Imposing a centralised, standardised provision of public services often does not meet the needs of these varied communities. Decentralisation of our public services in rural areas will allowed them to better provide for communities in the way they need rather than the way we want."
 IRE_forestry:9 "Expand Commercial Forestry"
 IRE_forestry_desc:9 "Ireland was once a heavily forested island, but over the centuries this has dropped to only 10% of the land being forested. The lands that are less suitable for pastures and fields are perfectly suited to commercial forestry operations. Expansion of this fledgling industry will have a variety of benefits such as allowing local sourcing of timber and bringing a new option for export to our economy."
 IRE_sugar_beet:9 "Support Sugar Beet Growers"
 IRE_sugar_beet_desc:9 "Sugar beet has been grown and processed in Ireland since the 1840s, in places such as Carlow, Mallow, Thurles and Tuam. Irish men and women's love of sugar in their tea means that development of this industry will be of great benefit our internal market, with even talks of sugar processing becoming a nationalised industry."
 IRE_fishing:9 "Support Local Fishing Potential"
 IRE_fishing_desc:9 "Ireland has a long and proud history of fishing, with many of the coastal islands depending on it entirely. From the naomhóga of the south and the hookers of the west, to the famous fishmonger Molly Malone, to the folk tales of \"An Bradán Feasa\", or the Salmon of Knowledge, fishing is ingrained in Irish culture. It only makes sense that we support and expand these fishing communities throughout Ireland and make them one of our key industries."
 IRE_rural_electrification:9 "Accelerate Rural Electrification"
 IRE_rural_electrification_desc:9 "The electrification of Ireland's urban areas has been a great success, but many rural areas still remain off the grid.

 IRE_rural_maintenance_council:9 "The Rural Maintenance Council"
 IRE_rural_maintenance_council_desc:9 "Thousands of properties in rural Ireland lie derelict or totally ruined since the famine, whether through reluctant relocation into the cities, or violent evictions perpetuated by the British forces. Many more properties are at risk of falling to the same fate if they are not maintained, which is why a unified council to maintain rural properties is vital for the survival of rural life."
 IRE_merge_smallholdings:9 "Merge Failing Smallholdings"
 IRE_merge_smallholdings_desc:9 "Irish farms were traditionally split between sons upon the owner's death, leading to small tracts of land that are often inefficient and subject to disuse. If we merge these smallholdings, taking care not to repeat the destruction caused by the Encumbered Estates Act, they can become productive modern farms and ensure our food security long into the future."
 IRE_redistribute_land:9 "Redistribute Underused Land"
 IRE_redistribute_land_desc:9 "Due to traditional and often complicated systems of inheritance, many areas of land have been in disuse for decades with the previous owners' heirs having died out or the land simply being abandoned for being unprofitable.

As Britain continues its efforts to win over Ireland, they have offered to provide some advisors to oversee our construction projects. A welcome proposal, but these advisors may lead to Britain having undue influence in our construction sector."
 IRE_industrial_techniques:9 "Study Industrial Techniques"
 IRE_industrial_techniques_desc:9 "While you would be hard pressed to hear the government admit this publicly, the advantages of some syndicalist industry standards are impossible to deny. With our increasing diplomacy with Britain, now may be a good time to study these techniques and see how we can implement them in our own workplaces to improve our output."
 IRE_overlook_exports:9 "Overlook Unregistered Exports"
 IRE_overlook_exports_desc:9 "While in the past Britain was Ireland's biggest trading partner, they have been almost entirely replaced by Germany. While some level of trade has been maintained through the Anglo-Irish Trading Corporation, if we overlook some of the paperwork, we may be able to increase our exports massively. This is a risky manoeuvre however and would give Britain an unwanted opportunity to blackmail our government."
 IRE_inexpensive_credit:9 "Utilise Inexpensive British Credit"
 IRE_inexpensive_credit_desc:9 "The effects of Black Monday still weigh heavy on our economy and recovery has been slow. Following this, Britain has made us a generous offer to help alleviate these problems. They will give us a large loan with a low interest rate to help our economy recover. While we do need the help, giving Britain such a hold on our finances is risky."

 IRE_foreign_know_how:9 "Procuring Foreign Know-How"
 IRE_foreign_know_how_desc:9 "While our diplomats are on their trips overseas flirting with Germany and Britain, they might as well take the opportunity to visit the most modern engineers and industrialists of today and see how their experience can benefit Ireland."
 IRE_playing_with_fire:9 "Playing with Fire"
 IRE_playing_with_fire_desc:9 "As Britain's influence continues to grow, they are expressing interest in funding Ireland's industrial sector directly. While this would certainly benefit our economy, it may be giving the British too much leverage and draw us further into their sphere of influence."
 IRE_heed_hegemon:9 "Heeding the Hegemon"
 IRE_heed_hegemon_desc:9 "Germany's influence continues to grow and they are well aware of it. As they attempt to keep Ireland well within their sphere of influence, they have made an offer to directly finance the construction of some new factories, in exchange for some diplomatic concessions."
 IRE_contracts_with_rheinmetall:9 "Contracts with Rheinmetall"
 IRE_contracts_with_rheinmetall_desc:9 "As the Germans attempt to maintain their level of influence, they continue to make more offers. As part of these, they have promised a favourable contract with the arms manufacturer Rheinmetall. This would greatly benefit our army but bring with it increased German oversight."
 IRE_resource_deficit:9 "Solving the Deficit"
 IRE_resource_deficit_desc:9 "The increased foreign influence in Ireland has given us enough diplomatic nous and clout to try to seek favourable and necessary trade deals worldwide for crucial natural resources that we unfortunately have in short supply domestically — the likes of coal, oil, and steel. By finding secure and diverse import partners for these resources, we can have a small, if steady supply for years to come."
 IRE_flying_with_hawker:9 "Flying with Hawker"
 IRE_flying_with_hawker_desc:9 "Britain is eager to maintain influence in Ireland and is offering increasingly favourable terms in exchange for diplomatic favour. They promised a shipment of new fighter aircraft from Hawker Aircraft Limited and a free licence to produce our own, with their oversight of course."
 IRE_liffey_hydro:9 "Liffey Hydroelectric Scheme"
 IRE_liffey_hydro_desc:9 "Since building Ardnacrusha power plant with German expertise in the 20s, Ireland is no stranger to the benefits of hydroelectricity, creating what became the largest station of its kind in the world at the time. We cannot rest on our laurels however, as the demand for power has risen sharply with our ongoing modernisation. With more help from our partners abroad, we are well-placed to repeat this success and utilise the power of the river Liffey in the Wicklow mountains."
 IRE_greenest_fields:9 "The Greenest Fields in Europe"
 IRE_greenest_fields_desc:9 "Ireland's dominant position in the Atlantic compared with the rest of Europe brings with it another quality of sorts, though one often not recognised — the rain. Despite the frequent misgivings of the population, Ireland's consistent level of rainfall and temperate climate make its pastures unsurpassed for livestock, in particular cattle. The demand for Irish farm produce abroad has only grown, given the level of foreign involvement here, and we had best capitalise on it."

 IRE_foreign_meddling:9 "Tackle Foreign Meddling"
 IRE_foreign_meddling_desc:9 "The European powers are eyeing up our country, and waiting for an opportunity to draw us into their sphere of influence. They have been doing everything in the power to control our economy and our government. It is about time that we address this unwanted meddling in our country, and focus on keeping Ireland strong as an independent country."
 IRE_import_quotas:9 "Introduce Import Quotas"
 IRE_import_quotas_desc:9 "It is true that Ireland benefits greatly from cheap imports both from the economic hegemon Germany and the British ever-competing to maintain their influence, but they are undercutting our local Irish-owned businesses. We must introduce limits on what can be imported so our own businesses have a fair chance to compete, grow, and flourish."
 IRE_higher_tariffs:9 "Apply Higher Tariffs"
 IRE_higher_tariffs_desc:9 "Ireland has allowed itself to be overrun with foreign products with unfamiliar names and this can be attributed to our criminally low import duties. If we want to have full control over our economy, we must introduce new taxes on these products to discourage their purchase and profit from the ones that still enter the country."
 IRE_subsidiaries:9 "Authorise Establishment of Subsidiaries"
 IRE_subsidiaries_desc:9 "We may not be able to totally stop foreign interference in Ireland, but we can certainly take measures to control it. When the British and Germans come knocking, we will encourage them to fund an Irish subsidiary rather than set up their own directly controlled business. This will allow us to oversee and manage their economic activity, as well as reap more of the profits and keep employment up."
 IRE_target_british_goods:9 "Target British Industrial Imports"
 IRE_target_british_goods_desc:9 "Britain remains an industrial powerhouse despite their revolution, and Irish business owners have always been eager to purchase their products despite official restrictions. This, however, has led to a lack of investment in homegrown industrial enterprises. We need to put our foot down and stem the flow of these imports to allow Irish businesses to take their place."
 IRE_homegrown_ingenuity:9 "Harness Homegrown Ingenuity"
 IRE_homegrown_ingenuity_desc:9 "The best universities of Ireland can easily rival universities in America, Britain or the continent, and top-level students regularly graduate from our most prestigious institutions. Despite this, we see little benefit from these intellectuals, as the lack of opportunities in Ireland pushes them to emigrate. If we open new employment opportunities for highly-qualified scholars, we will surely see a great boost to our science base."
 IRE_unpeg_punt:9 "Unpeg the Punt"
 IRE_unpeg_punt_desc:9 "The Irish Punt has been pegged to the Reichsmark since its creation following our independence. This ties our economy to that of Germany in an unnecessary fashion and has led to significantly more hardship than we deserved after Black Monday. It is time we unpeg the Punt and become fully economically independent."
 IRE_diversify_doctrines:9 "Diversify the Doctrines"
 IRE_diversify_doctrines_desc:9 "Though our guerrilla warfare famously challenged the British army, many of our traditional military tactics are very much based on those taught to us by Germany, and are Weltkrieg-era tactics at that. If we are to maintain our independence, our military needs doctrines fit for Ireland's geostrategic situation, taken from varied international sources, in order to outmanoeuvre and outperform any threat to our island."
 IRE_compulsory_purchase:9 "Compulsory Purchase Orders"
 IRE_compulsory_purchase_desc:9 "Many British businesses still linger in Ireland, and Germany has established many more since independence. Though we appreciate the commerce, these businesses run by absentee executives give us less control over our economic affairs than we would like. We can utilise a mechanism called a \"compulsory purchase order\" to seize control of these businesses and allow them to operate under Irish owners."

 IRE_le_macha_incident:9 "The LÉ Macha Incident"
 IRE_le_macha_incident_desc:9 "The news of a confrontation between LÉ Macha and British naval forces in the Irish Sea has left many stunned. Some are angry and many more are afraid, wondering what the British will do next. Public fears of finding British soldiers moving through their gardens any day now may be somewhat unfounded, but the government will have to take steps to address this national shock. And perhaps this is a much needed wakeup call."

 IRE_professional_army:0 "Une Armée Professionnelle"
 IRE_professional_army_desc:9 "Dans le climat mondial actuel, il serait insensé d’envisager autre chose que de lourdes dépenses militaires et des forces de défense modernes et correctement armées, car cela affaiblirait considérablement notre capacité à protéger notre indépendance. Même si le financement sera considérablement augmenté, nous veillerons quand même soigneusement à ce qu'il soit alloué au renforcement de la nation, plutôt que d'aller dans les poches des administrateurs."
 IRE_limited_motorisation:9 "Pursue Limited Motorisation"
 IRE_limited_motorisation_desc:9 "Developments in vehicle technology during the Weltkrieg and the years that followed have shown that motorisation is an immensely powerful resource when utilised, allowing armies to move faster than they ever could before. While motorisation efforts are expensive we can begin a small scale motorisation effort to allow us to adapt and to prepare for the wars of the future."
 IRE_learn_from_best:9 "Learn from the Best"
 IRE_learn_from_best_desc:9 "As a young army, one which has never fought in a \"true\" war, there will be many who will sneer at the Irish army. As we analyse and modify the tactics used by the great modern armed forces the world over, we must show our deriders that we are just as professional and just as capable as any continental force, that an Irish unit will fight just as well as one of the Heer. Our enemies will know when they fight us, as we send them fleeing from our troops."
 IRE_centralisation_high_command:9 "Centralisation of the High Command"
 IRE_centralisation_high_command_desc:9 "In a time of crisis, we must ensure that decisions are made effectively and in a coordinated manner, as miscommunications, mistakes or disagreements cannot be afforded when fighting potentially superior opponents. The high command must become the nerve centre for our entire military, capable of receiving information and acting on it as quickly as possible. Our staff will become a model of modern military high command, like the Prussians of yesterday."
 IRE_modernise_officer_training:9 "Modernise Officer Training Courses"
 IRE_modernise_officer_training_desc:9 "Our officers and general staff may be relatively inexperienced in the intricacies of modern warfare, but they can still be better prepared than their counterparts. We will take take steps to ensure they are kept abreast of all developments in military theory and practise, possibly even utilising our diplomatic connections to get sources straight from the horses mouth."
 IRE_mass_adopt_radio_technology:9 "Mass Adopt Radio Technology"
 IRE_mass_adopt_radio_technology_desc:9 "Radio, when utilised effectively, has the potential to be one of the most transformative weapons of the 20th century, removing the need for unreliable networks of cables, runners or carrier pigeons. Units can receive updates in real time, even if cut off or under fire, while reconnaissance from the air or ground could prove to be invaluable against our enemies."
 IRE_enhanced_army_training_regimes:9 "Enhanced Army Training Regimes"
 IRE_enhanced_army_training_regimes_desc:9 "As an army that transitioned from an originally guerrilla force, there are discrepancies between the standards held between different units, depending on the training levels of their officers. We shall create new scale of intensive standards that every soldier in the IRA must find their place on, to ensure that when the time comes we will have no weakest links, but also to form a cadre of the best of the best."
 IRE_expand_engineer_corps:9 "Expand the Corps of Engineers"
 IRE_expand_engineer_corps_desc:9 "To fight a modern war we do not simply need men with guns, fortifications, bridging and repairs are the difference between victory and defeat. The first Weltkrieg was won on the basis of such lessons, lessons which we can ill afford not to learn."
 IRE_na_fianoglaigh:9 "Na Fianóglaigh"
 IRE_na_fianoglaigh_desc:9 "While each soldier counts in combat, there are always units which rise above the call of duty; capable of transforming the course of battle on their own. From Napoleon's Garde Impériale to the Stoßtruppen of the Weltkrieg, units which not only perform extraordinary feats, but inspire those who stand with them. For the coming struggle we shall need such soldiers, a modern Fianna to be the heroes of this dark and uncertain age."

 IRE_people_army:0 "Une Armée Populaire"
 IRE_people_army_desc:9 "While some may disagree, the reality is that we cannot justify such high military spending in times like this. We are better suited to adopting a more cost-effective, asymmetrical style of warfare, like that which won us our freedom. Expensive over-engineered modern equipment and inflated bureaucracy would be the only result of greatly increasing funding, so let us stick with a homegrown fighting force, and improve what we are already good at."
 IRE_prepare_local_weapon_caches:9 "Prepare Improvised Weapon Caches"
 IRE_prepare_local_weapon_caches_desc:9 "Assuming supply lines were to break down, centrally distributing weapons and ammunition would be impossible. Therefore we must establish multiple channels to receive, store and produce our own weaponry. While this might add to inefficiencies and a lack of compatibility, it will ensure our supply chain is virtually unbreakable and any soldiers in the field will never be too far from a resupply."
 IRE_advanced_guerrilla_warfare:9 "Perfected Guerrilla Warfare"
 IRE_advanced_guerrilla_warfare_desc:9 "There may come a time when foreign boots march in our streets, when another flag tries to fly itself above our island. They will not be the first to think they can win, that they can stamp us out. We will begin preparing for a ceaseless guerrilla war, so that should the worst happen, we will be able to drive any invader from our island."
 IRE_revive_flying_columns:9 "Revive the Flying Columns"
 IRE_revive_flying_columns_desc:9 "The Flying Columns, small units of locals who knew the land better than any scouts, supplied by other supportive locals and free of supply issues facing a normal army, won Ireland her independence and set the standard for an effective guerrilla campaign against a more powerful force. We will revive the concept of a flying column as a official tactic, ensuring there are caches and hideouts capable of supplying rapidly mobile troops in a nationwide campaign, one even greater than 1920."
 IRE_lessons_war_independence:9 "Lessons of the War of Independence"
 IRE_lessons_war_independence_desc:9 "In many cases, the transition between the IRA flying columns and the official army of the Irish state was often little more than the addition of uniforms. Many of our officers owe their position to service in our struggle for independence, and while they are transitioning out of fighting age, those that follow them were often closely connected. We should strive to maintain this legacy of a popular patriotic force, rather than imposing a soulless continental structure."
 IRE_fortify_shannon:0 "Fortifier le Shannon"
 IRE_fortify_shannon_desc:9 "Running through the centre of Ireland, the Shannon has long been an immensely important body of water. Its position running through the middle of our country has made it strategic throughout history, and it is still a rare element of natural defence to this day. We can expand on this natural defensiveness through the construction of fortifications along the shannon, turning it into a formidable obstacle to any invader trying to cross it."
 IRE_irregular_recon:9 "Irregular Reconnaissance Networks"
 IRE_irregular_recon_desc:9 "In any modern conflict, getting the best intelligence is half the battle. The leaders of the war of Independence knew this and built a network capable of outsmarting the numerically superior English forces. By replicating this strategy with modern equipment, we can turn every village, bóithrín or hilltop into a potential lookout, and ensure our enemies never have the advantage."
 IRE_consolidate_reserve_forces:9 "Consolidate Reserve Forces"
 IRE_consolidate_reserve_forces_desc:9 "Support from the greater population was the key in winning the War of Independence, if we want to win any future conflict, we must ensure that the population are similarly engaged and inspired to support a similar effort in the future. We will ensure people are trained in the tactics of guerrilla warfare, be that in supplies, intel or actual fighting. This will allow us to strengthen reserves for fighting an effective campaign."
 IRE_na_cosantoiri:9 "Na Cosantóirí"
 IRE_na_cosantoiri_desc:9 "Our history has shown the hardship and setbacks that can come from fighting numerically superior forces. Each and every time it has always come down to the bravery of those who refused to give up, who rallied and outlasted their foes. Our enemies are mortal, but our nation is eternal, holding firm like a rock to break any waves that beset it."

 IRE_refurbish_curragh_camp:9 "Refurbish the Curragh Camp"
 IRE_refurbish_curragh_camp_desc:9 "The army base in the Curragh has a long history of use, going back to the days of British rule. Over the past few years however, the facilities in the camp have begun showing their age, and the list of repair requests has been allowed to grow. We will earmark funding to refurbish and modernise the Curragh, bringing it up to modern military standards."
 IRE_adopt_new_rifle:9 "Adopt a New Standard Rifle"
 IRE_adopt_new_rifle_desc:9 "Much of our army still makes use of German or British equipment from the First Weltkrieg, some of which is even older. While these are undoubtedly reliable weapons, developments in firearms have shown that a major shift is coming towards a new generation of even more effective tools. If we fail to keep abreast of these shifts now, we may as well still be using muskets."
 IRE_comraind_legis:9 "Comraind Legis"
 IRE_comraind_legis_desc:9 "A soldier killed on the battlefield is the fault of the enemy, one who dies in the days after was killed by his own army. Creating an efficient medical corps for our army is vital to ensure that men are not unnecessarily incapacitated. More importantly than that, it might mean one more gets to come home."
 IRE_volunteer_brigades:9 "Promote the Volunteer Brigades"
 IRE_volunteer_brigades_desc:9 "While the conflicts which have engulfed nations around the world has been an unquestionable tragedy, it has also shown that countless men are willing to fight and die for what they believe in, whatever the cost. As these individuals begin to return home, we should attempt to persuade them to continue that fight under their own flag, and use their experience for the greater good."
 IRE_artillery_licenses:9 "Purchase Artillery Licenses"
 IRE_artillery_licenses_desc:9 "Much of our military still uses old British and German surplus, and even that is beginning to run out. We will endeavour to acquire licenses to allow us to produce more modern artillery pieces ourselves, making us both more self reliant and modern as a fighting force. Artillery will always serve as a major component of warfare, we should not let it slip past us."
 IRE_reinforce_dmi:9 "Reinforce the DMI"
 IRE_reinforce_dmi_desc:9 "The Directorate of Military Intelligence is our first line of defence from threats both within and without, guarding against subversion and providing \"active intelligence\" on other nations. With the rise of new technologies, particularly in cryptographic computing, we risk losing our edge, this cannot be allowed to happen."
 IRE_subsidise_domestic_arms:9 "Subsidise Domestic Arms Workshops"
 IRE_subsidise_domestic_arms_desc:9 "An army that cannot supply itself will eventually lose, no matter their fighting skill. Since the decline and closure of the Royal Gunpowder Mills, once one of Europe's largest gunpowder manufacturers, we have failed to develop the weapons manufacturing of most European nations.

 IRE_reactivate_balla_eireannach_desc:9 "An Balla Éireannach, or, "The Irish Wall", was a series of fortifications began along the Irish coast, when fears of a British invasion were high. These plans were put on the back burner however, as the threat posed by the Union seemed less great than it was once feared. With the new fear prompted by the recent incident however, many are calling for these plans to be completed, giving us some much-needed fortifications facing the British."
 IRE_renovate_balla_eireannach:9 "Renovate An Balla Éireannach"
 IRE_renovate_balla_eireannach_desc:9 "With the successful completion of the original fortifications plan, many now feel secure. However the original plan shows its age, being created in a time of different military beliefs and when Ireland had less funds available for construction. With this in mind, there are plans being thought up for a new Balla Éireannach, which will be far more modern and far greater in scale than the existing elements."

 IRE_training_exercises:9 "Aero-nautical Training Exercises"
 IRE_training_exercises_desc:9 "As an island, the best defence we have is geography, as if we can keep the enemy off our shores, we will be better defended than we would be with any fortifications. In the three decades since the first powered flight, air tactics have evolved indescribably, we must ensure our pilots do not grow complacent when the time comes, as they will likely be the key which separates survival from invasion."
 IRE_support_air_corps:9 "Support the Irish Air Corps"
 IRE_support_air_corps_desc:9 "Developments across the world show us that air power will dictate the conflicts of the future, and because of this many proponents of air war in the Irish armed forces believe the time is now to reinforce and expand the fledgling Irish Air Corps. While we may not be able to go properly toe to toe with the RAF, we cannot simply give up the field to them either. By taking the fight to the skies, we can show any foe that Ireland will not simply back down from a fight."
 IRE_develop_casement_aerodrome:9 "Develop Casement Aerodrome"
 IRE_develop_casement_aerodrome_desc:9 "The air base in Baldonnel may have been sufficient for the long time, as our air capabilities grow, we are finding it increasingly at capacity and lacking of facilities. A large expansion programme, to both the training and air corps facilities, will be undertaken which will make the base capable of facilitating a number of future operations."
 IRE_expand_civil_air_defence:9 "Expand Civil Air Defence"
 IRE_expand_civil_air_defence_desc:9 "Preparation is one of the most important elements in mounting a proper anti-air defence. We will begin the creation of a connected network of air observers along our coasts, ready to update us of any incoming attacks and giving us the maximum time to prepare for the enemies arrival, or even scramble our own air units in response."
 IRE_mobile_heavy_artillery_experiments:9 "Mobile Heavy Artillery Experiments"
 IRE_mobile_heavy_artillery_experiments_desc:9 "The further expansion of our island's structural defenses, as well as the renovation of our main railway lines, has led some in the military to the idea of combining the two. We will construct a single railway gun, well-suited to our large rail gauge, and name it \"An Casúr\", or \"The Hammer\", which can then traverse the new railways running along the coasts, and provide bombardment on any invaders who dare trespass, where-ever they may land."
 IRE_rotational_training_sessions:9 "Rotational Training Sessions"
 IRE_rotational_training_sessions_desc:9 "No matter how much we develop, the fact is that any enemy we face will likely be able to face us with overwhelming numbers of aircraft, we must therefore prepare for an almost round the clock assault as they attempt to rob us of air supremacy.

 IRE_purchase_surplus_fighters:9 "License Fighter Schematics"
 IRE_purchase_surplus_fighters_desc:9 "The spotlight will always be placed in the flashiest new designs coming out of Britain or Germany, but there are many perfectly decent fighters out there which are far more affordable for a country like Ireland, and would allow us to expand out air capabilities faster without bankrupting ourselves. We will contact other air services to ask about purchasing their surplus airframes and designs."
 IRE_maintain_army_air_support_primacy:9 "Maintain Army-Air Support Primacy"
 IRE_maintain_army_air_support_primacy_desc:9 "Air power has an important role in modern warfare, but it will be ground operations that will still be what ultimately wins wars.

 IRE_independent_air_operations:9 "Independent Air Operations"
 IRE_independent_air_operations_desc:9 "While accepting the fact that air power is as important as the army or the fleet will be hard for many in our high command to accept, we must show them the effects that an independent air arm has had in foreign militaries, before we find our home under assault from an enemy we have no defence against."
 IRE_coastal_bombing_exercises:9 "Coastal Bombing Exercises"
 IRE_coastal_bombing_exercises_desc:9 "Building ships is prohibitively expensive, and the new technology of aircraft has proven itself to be a far more cost effective addition to naval strategy.

 IRE_bolster_coast_guard:9 "Bolster the Coast Guard"
 IRE_bolster_coast_guard_desc:9 "Currently the Irish maritime force is very weak, and this weakness was highlighted by the Incident with the LÉ Macha.

While this will likely take some time, it will finally give our island the ability to defend its shores."
 IRE_naval_college:9 "Establish the Cork Naval College"
 IRE_naval_college_desc:9 "Currently many of our officers receive training overseas, and even then it is rather rudimentary. In order to train officers properly versed in naval warfare, we will create a naval college near our main naval base in Cork. This will begin turning out graduates who are well versed in the realities of combat at sea, and are able to lead the sailors under their command properly."
 IRE_submarine_focus:9 "Strike Under the Waves"
 IRE_submarine_focus_desc:9 "There is no real way for us to compete with Britain in surface warfare, as their advantages in resources and time make it virtually impossible to alter that balance. Submarines however, are another matter. German U-Boats were able to effectively wreak havoc with the British trade network during the Weltkrieg, as we saw ourselves off Kinsale. With the far more advanced submarines of today, we are well-positioned to strike fear into any British sailor within range."
 IRE_as_warfare:9 "A/S Warfare Exercises"
 IRE_as_warfare_desc:9 "Our island has its natural advantages, but there is a danger that we could simply be cut off from the resources we need to survive.

In many ways the Ireland we have built for ourselves could not exist without the order which the Germans have forged since the collapse of the British and French Empires.

Ultimately, Sinn Féin left these promises to the wayside, and it is time for the Labour party to take up this torch once again."
 IRE_reassure_clergy:9 "Reassure the Clergy"
 IRE_reassure_clergy_desc:9 "In the previous status-quo of Irish politics, a working relationship developed between the government and the Catholic Church. Given the central role the clergy plays in most Irish villages, damaging these ties is not an option. We must assure the church that despite our different approach to politics, we have no interest in waging a war on the church as socialists have done elsewhere. Friendly church ties will not only increase support for our reforms, but also aid in their implementation."
 IRE_coop_businesses:9 "Facilitate Cooperative Businesses"
 IRE_coop_businesses_desc:9 "One of the great problems with the Irish economy is that it is dominated by small enterprises and farmers which will never have the necessary scale to be innovative. One way we can begin to change this is by encouraging the growth of cooperatives. These could finally allow us to break the stagnation afflicting many Irish towns, while demonstrating the benefits in a more public ownership of wealth."

During these revolutionary years, women played a core role in the struggle, proving many outdated notions for the idiocy they were.

 IRE_tillage_farming:9 "Promote Tillage Farming"
 IRE_tillage_farming_desc:9 "Since the days of the Táin Bó Cúailnge, livestock has dominated the Irish psyche.

 IRE_voice_rural:9 "The Voice of Rural Ireland"
 IRE_voice_rural_desc:9 "For much of modern Irish history, the rural areas have typically been seen as being secondary to the pace of political life.

He died a martyr both for the cause of Irish liberty and for socialism, and it is up to us to build the nation he envisioned. While we have a long way to go, the idea of a republic which protects the weak as well as preserving our culture is being forged, by further promoting Connolly as a national hero, we will show that republicanism and socialism are not separate goals, but one dream."

 IRE_progressive_labour:9 "Revolution from Within"
 IRE_progressive_labour_desc:9 "While other nations may have had to violently crush their opposition and radically transform society to achieve socialism, our nation does not need to go through such hardship.

 IRE_institutionalise_meitheal:9 "Institutionalise Meitheal"
 IRE_institutionalise_meitheal_desc:9 "Meitheal is a term used by our forebears which describes the willingness of farmers to work together, to ensure they all prospered.

Using our cooperatives as a model, we will remind our rural areas how to care, that by pooling their abilities, they will all be better off."
 IRE_workplace_democracy:9 "Implement Workplace Democracy"
 IRE_workplace_democracy_desc:9 "The oppressive hierarchies that still dictate many of the nation's workplaces do little but detract from the lives of their workers and hold back the companies themselves to simply enrich and empower a few select individuals. By shifting the power in the workplace to its workers, rather than the bosses, we shall both eliminate these unjust hierarchies and make work more efficient in one fell swoop."
 IRE_defend_parliamentarism:9 "Defend Parliamentarism"
 IRE_defend_parliamentarism_desc:9 "A state where the people are not allowed to have their voices heard is nothing but a dictatorship, regardless of how red you paint it.

 IRE_reconcile_old_guard:9 "Reconcile with the Old Guard"
 IRE_reconcile_old_guard_desc:9 "Even with the betrayal of the socialist cause shown by the Labour party during the 20s and 30s, many of those within the party are still committed to achieving socialism in Ireland. Now that the new government has solidified itself, it seems pointless and petty to still maintain grudges against the old guard of Labour. We should extend out an olive branch, and put aside any remaining differences with those willing to accept it."
 IRE_compensated_transfer:9 "Compensated Transfer of Assets"
 IRE_compensated_transfer_desc:9 "While the control the Church has over many of the nation's institutions must be tackled, simply forcefully dismantling the Church and nationalising their property like radical Protestants will do nothing but tear apart society and galvanise people towards reactionary ideologies. The simple act of negotiation will be a much more effective tool to achieve this goal, and one few will find solid grounds to oppose."
 IRE_defang_paramilitaries:9 "Defang Paramilitaries"
 IRE_defang_paramilitaries_desc:9 "A free nation cannot prosper with radical and violent militias patrolling its streets, regardless of which side of the political discourse they claim to represent.

Through our efforts, we have begun building a new society on our island, one where all have a chance to work for their comrades and create a better future. It is perhaps fitting that Ireland, a nation so abused in the past, now stands ready to fight for a brighter future not just for its people, but for all mankind."

 IRE_northern_catholics_desc:9 "During the British Revolution, we had the chance to militarily reclaim the six counties, yet it was by selling out to loyalism that Collins' government achieved reunification, turning a blind eye to their discrimination against the Catholics of Ulster, our own flesh-and-blood, in the name of \"peace\". Unlike those traitors, we will no longer stand idly by as our northern brethren are oppressed."
 IRE_clergy_support:9 "Gain Ecclesiastical Support"
 IRE_clergy_support_desc:9 "Despite the pious nature of the Irish people, our relationship with the Church's hierarchy is a complex one, with the latter being often overly moderate on the national question. Nonetheless, by courting the friendship of the Primate of All-Ireland, Joseph MacRory, an Ulster Catholic who like us holds a fervent dislike of loyalism and syndicalism, we can ensure the Church takes a favourable view of our regime."
 IRE_red_scare:9 "The Second Irish Red Scare"
 IRE_red_scare_desc:9 "While the British Revolution caused much alarm, the Irish people over the following years have taken the status quo for granted, growing complacent to the threat of invasion by our age-old enemy to the east, or of subversion at home by red traitors on their payroll. We must renew our crackdown on all signs of syndicalist infiltration in our midst, from the unions to the universities."

 IRE_cor_deantais_desc:9 "The inner cities of Ireland have been wracked with unemployment even before Black Monday, leading to an endemic issue of petty crime and social irresponsibility. The establishment of a public works programme attached to the military will work to resolve these issues, by both providing the unemployed an occupation of benefit to the country and instilling within them a sense of discipline."

 IRE_chinsealacht_gaelach_desc:9 "In the darkest days of British rule, Irish society came under the total domination of the Anglo-Irish minority, or the \"Protestant Ascendancy\". It is time we returned the favour. Our aim shall be to ensure all positions of importance are held by republicans and Gaelic revivalists, driving out the infestation of West Britonism. Patriotism, rather than the lack of it, will become a necessity for social advancement."

 IRE_true_spirit_gael_desc:9 "Having cast off the degenerate parliamentary system, our regime shall revitalise the athletic and warrior spirit of the Gael with an energy and discipline that would put even the Spartans to shame.

 IRE_executive_decree:9 "Rule by Executive Decree"
 IRE_executive_decree_desc:9 "With Eoin O'Duffy wielding absolute authority following the dissolution of the Dáil, the era of bickering and consensus being required to pass legislation is over. Through ruling by executive decree, corrupt party politicians or the short-sighted public will no longer be allowed to impede the introduction of laws and policies necessary to rebuild Ireland after centuries of British rule."
 IRE_army_council:9 "Collaborate with the Army Council"
 IRE_army_council_desc:9 "Though O'Duffy may not share the Germanophilia of the IRA's top brass, they nonetheless have in common a martial background, alarm at the rising threat of syndicalism, and disdain for loyalism and parliamentary politics. There is much more to gain than lose from working together to ensure order and stability while preparing the Republic both have sworn to defend for the eventuality of war."
 IRE_integrate_blueshirts:9 "Integrate the Blueshirt Apparatus"
 IRE_integrate_blueshirts_desc:9 "While the National Guard have proven most useful in protecting the state from its syndicalist and loyalist enemies, its extra-governmental, paramilitary nature has made the organisation unfortunately susceptible to being taken over from within by charismatic radicals. To neutralise this potential threat, we must integrate the Blueshirts as a gendarmerie under official oversight."

 IRE_integralism:9 "Implement Maurassian Principles"
 IRE_integralism_desc:9 "Our movement's key source of inspiration is the writings of the great French political philosopher Charles Maurras, who called for the rejection of the decadent societies created by the Enlightenment and the French Revolution in favour of a decentralised, traditional nation unified by a national sovereign and Church.

 IRE_european_rechristianisation_desc:9 "After the fall of Rome, the efforts of Irish monks played a vital role in re-christianising Europe, and preserving much knowledge that otherwise would have been forever lost. With the continent afflicted by syndicalism and parliamentarism, we will again fulfil our sacred destiny and duty to God by helping free the European people from paganism, and in doing so spread our national influence."

 IRE_ecumenism:9 "Tolerate Moderate Ecumenism"
 IRE_ecumenism_desc:9 "Though our movement is primarily Catholic, as are the inspirations for our corporatist ideals, we regard all Christians who show loyalty to Ireland and speak the Irish language, no matter their denomination, to be Gaels, in spite of past dissensions.

 IRE_second_election_desc:9 "Ireland's democracy has overcome the challenges to its existence, but the never-ending rattle of the ballot box only awaits the government that helped it do so. It is the people who must choose who will continue to lead them into the next term of the Dáil, and nothing is guaranteed on election day."

 IRE_later_plp:9 "Revolution From the Ballot Box"
 IRE_later_plp_desc:9 "Few thought it possible for true socialism to ever succeed in electoral politics, often citing government oppression and how easily reactionaries can manipulate the average voter. With the Progressive Labour Party emerging as victors of the most recent elections, the doubters have been proved wrong. It is now time for Ireland to return to the socialist future it was always destined to have."
 IRE_coop_farming:9 "Cooperative Farming"
 IRE_coop_farming_desc:9 "Even to this day farms in the nation are run in an archaic and almost feudal fashion, to the detriment of Ireland and its people. To address these outdated practices the farmers of Ireland should be encouraged to collectivise together and begin operating their farms together, hopefully improving their efficiency and cutting out any capitalist middlemen who seek to profit from their labour."
 IRE_nationalise_church_institutions:9 "Nationalisation of Church-run Institutions"
 IRE_nationalise_church_institutions_desc:9 "It is a disgrace that the clergy who have sat idly by while the nation's destitute suffer have such a stranglehold on many of the country's institutions. It is vital that we nationalise these institutions and hand them back to the Irish people, to whom they truly belong."
 IRE_decay_of_landlordism:9 "Decay of Landlordism"
 IRE_decay_of_landlordism_desc:9 "Despite the growth of socialism in Ireland there are still many who defend the practice of landlordism, arguing that \"one person's rent is another person's income.\" While the radical step of outlawing the practice completely and seizing landlord owned properties is often tempting, a more soft handed approach of a gradual increase in regulations will be received a lot better by the voting public."
 IRE_widow_pensions:9 "Protecting Those Society Forgot"
 IRE_widow_pensions_desc:9 "Irish society is filled with those that have been forgotten by it, in many cases intentionally so. The grieving widow, the lonely orphan, the suffering veteran, all thus far abandoned by successive Irish governments. The laws that we will now introduce to protect these vulnerable members of society, providing them access to their family pensions and additional care benefits, will hopefully one day be one of our most fondly remembered achievements."
 IRE_red_future:9 "The Red Future"
 IRE_red_future_desc:9 "For years the green flag has flown over Dublin castle, with the foreign invaders already driven back across the sea, and yet only now has Ireland begun to truly free itself from the inequalities that persisted. While Ireland has not yet fully blossomed into the socialist republic Connolly envisioned, it seems clear to many that it has been set firmly on the course of socialism and the moderately red future it will bring."

 IRE_later_labour:9 "The Continued March of Labour"
 IRE_later_labour_desc:9 "Having received a mandate from the people once more, it is now time for Labour to focus on implementing the many policies that had to be deprioritised in favour of resolving the Black Monday Crisis. Through a wide berth of social and economic reforms the lives of Ireland's people shall hopefully be greatly improved, and the gradual march towards a socialist future can be continued."
 IRE_collaborate_with_ITUC:9 "Collaborating with the ITUC"
 IRE_collaborate_with_ITUC_desc:9 "Despite sections of the ITUC abandoning the Labour Party in favour of more radical members of the socialist opposition, the ties between it and Labour are impossible to truly break. Through cooperation with the less radical members of the ITUC and supporting their plans to aid the Irish worker we can boost the nation's industrial capacity, something from which the entire country can prosper."
 IRE_state_education:9 "State Education"
 IRE_state_education_desc:9 "For centuries the task of educating Ireland's children has normally fallen to their parents or the local priests and nuns, often to less than stellar results. To ensure the youth are educated to a modern standard the duty to do so must be taken out of the hands of the clergy, to instead be handled by the state, with the goal of providing free education from secular teachers to the children of the nation."
 IRE_industrial_development:9 "Promote Industrial Development"
 IRE_industrial_development_desc:9 "New industrial developments are always a reliable way to ensure continued work for the people of Ireland, and with government involvement in the projects we can make sure that said work is also fair. By prioritising new and growing industries for this development, the jobs created should hopefully also be long lasting and be in much better positions to weather the storms of time."
 IRE_modern_roads_modern_nation:9 "Modern Roads, Modern Nation"
 IRE_modern_roads_modern_nation_desc:9 "These days there are two places the average Irish worker spends most of their life, the first is their bed and the second is the road on their commute to and from work. Yet still, despite their fundamental role in Irish society, many of our roads are still untarred macadam while the rest of the world has moved on to tarmacadam and asphalt. It is economically vital that this issue is addressed and our outdated roads are quickly modernised."

 IRE_later_cnat:9 "The Cause of the Countryside"
 IRE_later_cnat_desc:9 "The impression left on the voting public from Clann na Talmhan's role in the coalition has propelled them to being now the largest party in government. Now leading a coalition of its own, it is time for CnaT to fulfil the promises of their election campaign and bring forth a much more agrarian focused political vision for the nation."
 IRE_drain_boglands:9 "Draining the Boglands"
 IRE_drain_boglands_desc:9 "The creation of new farmland should always be a priority for any government, and in Ireland the many widespread tracts of bogland are perfect places to establish these new farms. By working hard to drain these boglands and reclaim the land they sit on, we can create a great deal of land perfect for crop farming and animal grazing."
 IRE_sustainable_forestry:9 "Sustainable Forestry"
 IRE_sustainable_forestry_desc:9 "Ireland is one of the few places in Europe still home to the beautiful temperate rainforests that once dotted much of the landscape. Centuries of deforestation has however depleted much of the nation's tree coverage, and if action is not taken they may be destroyed for good. To help prevent this grants should be issued to logging companies who practice sustainable forestry and afforestation, protecting existing forests and growing new ones as well."

 IRE_minerals_development_act_desc:9 "Our great land has many untapped bounties buried beneath its surface, and it is important for our economic growth that we make use of them in a well thought out way.

 IRE_progressive_land_rates:9 "Progressive Land Rates"
 IRE_progressive_land_rates_desc:9 "If one were to ask the many farmers across the nation what is the hardest thing to deal with in their line of work, the answer of harsh land rates would almost certainly be one of the most common responses. Through a progressive reformation of the land rate system we can ensure that the burden placed upon the common farmer is lessened, helping us win support and weaken the strength of alternative proposals by the nation's radical elements."
 IRE_golden_moderation:9 "Golden Moderation"
 IRE_golden_moderation_desc:9 "With most things in life reserved moderation is often the best approach, and nowhere has this proved more true than Irish politics. Rejecting the extremes that have been advocated by people like Larkin and O'Duffy we have carved out a stable future for the nation free of the many troubles that plague the world's extremist regimes. While work is never truly done, the achievements of our moderate leadership will almost certainly leave a permanent mark upon Ireland."

 IRE_international_port_belfast_desc:9 "When Britain's empire collapsed and reunification was achieved, Belfast and its great shipbuilders suffered greatly. In this time companies like Harland & Wolff survived by shifting almost entirely towards commerical work, earning Belfast a global reputation for commerce. Even with times becoming less desperate for shipbuilders, Belfast has cemented itself as one of the most important commercial ports, and with government support it could soon outshine all others."
 IRE_sidestep_church:9 "Sidestep the Church"
 IRE_sidestep_church_desc:9 "The vital role the Church plays in Irish society is of course something that few wish to directly challenge. At the same time, there are many duties to which the Church taking a less direct role would clearly be to the benefit of both the Church itself and the government. Through the delicate shifting of responsibilities we can help ensure that those roles best left to the government are actually left to it, rather than left in the busy hands of the clergy."
 IRE_adopt_bismarck_model:9 "Adopt the Bismarck Model"
 IRE_adopt_bismarck_model_desc:9 "One of Otto von Bismarck's finest accomplishments was the introduction of his health insurance model that has since helped provide care to millions of Germans who would have otherwise been without, cutting off a vital avenue for the most radical socialists to gather support. With such a strong example set by the Germans in this field, it would be imperative for us to introduce a similar healthcare system for Ireland and its people."

 IRE_eternal_vigilance_of_big_mick_desc:9 "For as long as Ireland has been free, there has been one man who has ever presently guided it through thick and thin, in official positions of power and even from the sidelines. Whether people choose to refer to him as Ireland's Architect, the Tinpot Tyrant, or simply just the Big Fellow, it is clear to all that the future of the Irish state will always be irrevocably tied to the legacy of Michael Collins."

 IRE_later_ndp:9 "A Fair Deal For All"
 IRE_later_ndp_desc:9 "The results of the election are clear, Seán Lemass and his National Development Party have emerged as the largest party in the Dáil.

 IRE_villages_to_towns:9 "From Villages to Towns"
 IRE_villages_to_towns_desc:9 "While Ireland's great cities serve a vital role in the economy, economic growth cannot come from just a few major urban centres lest we wish to accept the consequences of their eventual stagnation. Instead government policy should be based around supporting the growth of promising rural areas in the nation, growing many of these small settlements into well developed and respectable towns capable of proper commerce."
 IRE_nation_two_peoples:9 "Nation of Two Peoples"
 IRE_nation_two_peoples_desc:9 "Like all nations Ireland is not a perfect nation, and suffers from many unfortunate flaws. The gravest of these flaws is how much of the nation views many of their Anglo-Irish and Ulster-Scots countrymen as little more than foreign invaders, when many of them have never known any land but our great isle as their home. It is time for the government to truly recognise these men and women as our brothers and sisters, and help finally shatter this flawed perception of them."
 IRE_educated_workforce:9 "Educated Workforce"
 IRE_educated_workforce_desc:9 "Investing in a nation's education is one of the strongest avenues for economic growth, and one often overlooked by those blinded with a short sighted approach to finance.

 IRE_noble_middle_class_desc:9 "Gone are the days of the feudal elite and the peasants stuck beneath them, in our modern nation any man or woman who truly puts in enough work will be fairly rewarded with a comfortable life for themselves and their family.

 IRE_global_centre_finance_desc:9 "Compared to the economic giants of the world, the Germanys, the Austrias, and even the Japans, Ireland has always been the underdog that few could have expected much from.

 IRE_social_welfare_schemes:9 "Social Welfare Schemes"
 IRE_social_welfare_schemes_desc:9 "Many too caught up in modern politics often forget that providing care for the downtrodden is not a socialist idea, it is at its heart a pure Christian policy through and through. It should therefore be government policy to extend unemployment insurance and child care allowances, so that we can provide care for our fellow countrymen to get through their hardships."
 IRE_arrows_adversity:9 "Ward Off the Arrows of Adversity"
 IRE_arrows_adversity_desc:9 "With An Saorstát Críostúil's position secure it is time for the government to lay out the plans for fighting back against the threats to the nation.

Only an Ireland free from these scourges can truly prosper."
 IRE_people_tradition_faith:9 "People of Tradition and Faith"

 IRE_rights_family:9 "Legislate the Rights of Family"
 IRE_rights_family_desc:9 "Many in the world have a warped idea of what success means, viewing it through an exclusively worldly lens focused on mundane riches or status in society. The truest form of success in life is the one most overlooked, the establishment and development of a large and devout family. Aiding our people in achieving this joy should be a government priority, and codifying the sacred right of these families will be a vital step towards doing so."
 IRE_nation_small_farmers:9 "Nation of Small Farmers"
 IRE_nation_small_farmers_desc:9 "The roots of Irish identity is found in its farms, those owned by the common Gael to provide for himself and his community. Mass urbanisation and industrialisation has caused many of these farmers to be left behind economically, and efforts must be made to aid these common people.

The party has truly committed itself to strengthening the Christian heart and soul of the nation, freeing its peoples from hardship, and protecting that which we hold dear. Work like this is however never done, but it is clear that Ireland is now back onto the right path for a noble future."

 IRE_later_an_desc:9 "Championing a message few other parties dared to speak, the parliamentarian wing of Aontas Náisiúnta has managed to climb up from being a junior coalition member to now being the largest party in government. While most expect this new government to be less radical compared to the more extreme abstentionists of AN, it seems apparent that the nation is now set on a path towards intense traditionalism and the gradual teardown of the democratic system."
 IRE_gaelic_state:9 "Stát na nGaedheal"
 IRE_gaelic_state_desc:9 "The Gaelic identity is the heart of the Irish nation, and despite the best efforts of foreign rulers there are those who have maintained our wonderful culture up to the modern day. Aiding the people in the Gaeltacht and upping funding for Irish-language initiatives will be vital for keeping our ethno-cultural identity alive and spreading it back to the rest of the nation, thus it should be one of the new government's greatest priorities."
 IRE_pious_republic:9 "The Pious Republic"
 IRE_pious_republic_desc:9 "The Catholic faith is the only true faith of the nation, and attempts to recognise foreign religions by previous governments have left a great stain on the country's legacy.

 IRE_managed_democracy:0 "Démocratie Organisée"
 IRE_managed_democracy_desc:9 "While a healthy democracy can be good for a nation, allowing those who wish to destroy our nation to run in elections will lead to nothing but ruin and national decay.

But our exiles never forgot their home, they never stopped thinking about when they would go home. Now, with the situation seeming as dark as the days of the drochshaol many have now felt that day has come.

 IRE_lab_idea_3_desc:9 "While rollouts have only just begun, our new welfare programmes are already beginning to show results.

 IRE_lab_idea_4_desc:9 "While there is still a long way to go, and many conservative elements remain resistant to reform, we have begun building a nation that is more than just a change of management. Ireland has taken her place among the modern progressive nations of the world. Unlike countless states across this continent; we have not sacrificed equality for freedom, nor freedom for equality."
 IRE_lab_plp_idea:9 "Treading the Fine Line"
 IRE_lab_plp_idea_desc:9 "While we may wish to move faster, change things more drastically, we must accept the fact that this is still a country dominated by traditional ideas. Particularly in the countryside, there is a general suspicion and reluctance to change, one we must take care not to forget. We must make it clear that we do not want to rock to boat, simply put her on a better course."

 IRE_lab_cnat_idea_desc:9 "While many on the left would seek to expand the cooperative movements and help those in the cities, we cannot forget the importance of the vast majority of rural people who are smallholders working on their own. By targeting welfare for those on the smallest plots, we can help them move beyond subsistence."

 IRE_ndp_cnat_capstone_desc:9 "Through combining positive social policy aimed to improve the lives of Ireland's people and a healthy dose of capitalism, the Irish Government has managed to both greatly aid the nation's economic developments, and ensure a wave of renewed stability for the once troubled republic."
 IRE_church_lab_idea:9 "Reassurances to the Clergy"
 IRE_church_lab_idea_desc:9 "The rise of a \"socialist\" party in Ireland immediately put many socially powerful religious figures on edge, considering what has occurred across Europe.

 IRE_church_lab_plp_idea:9 "Nationalised Church Institutions"
 IRE_church_lab_plp_idea_desc:9 "Many of the institutions previously run by the Church such as care homes and orphanages have been nationalised by the state, primarily through the government purchase of their properties. This policy has of course been met with backlash, but has also begun to significantly weaken the Church's power in Ireland."
 IRE_landlordism_decay:9 "Decay of Landlordism"
 IRE_landlordism_decay_desc:9 "Through a gradual increase of regulations placed on the renting of properties and an increase in the rights of tenants, many of those who were formerly landlords have found themselves forced out of the market. Still, the practice has not been entirely eliminated and a significant number still privately rent out their properties, even with the potential insecurity they may face from any further regulations."
 IRE_road_modernisation:9 "Road Modernisation"
 IRE_road_modernisation_desc:9 "Many of the roads of Ireland have historically been little more than simple macadam, greatly hindering the developmental potential of the nation. In an attempt to solve this problem, the Irish state has embarked on a large scale modernisation of the many major roads and urban streets of the country. By upgrading many of these roads to tarmacadam and asphalt the government hopes to help address the needs of a modern country and its workers."
 IRE_rural_infrastructure:9 "Rural Infrastructure Development"
 IRE_rural_infrastructure_desc:9 "The countless country roads of Ireland have long served as the only connections between the many villages and farms across the nation which have sustained it for centuries. Most of these roads have however always been little more than well trodden dirt paths, and so the Irish Government has begun a large scale project to aid in the development of this rural infrastructure on which so many depend."

 IRE_sf_mittel:9 "Increased European Cooperation"

 IRE_sf_idea:9 "The Heavy Hand of Progress"
 IRE_sf_idea_desc:9 "While some may favour simply relying on the "invisible hand" of the market to bring progress and prosperity to the nation, the Sinn Féin government has chosen to favour the "heavy hand" approach of more direct and focused economic development to bring all aspects of Ireland's economy forwards."
 IRE_sf_idea_4:9 "$IRE_natural_party$"
 IRE_sf_idea_4_desc:9 "While it has not directly ruled Ireland for all of its independent history, the years Sinn Féin has been in power and its recent response to the Black Monday crisis has left the impression upon many of Ireland's people that the party is the "safe" and "default" option. While other parties still remain an important part of the system, to most the perception is that when the going gets tough it'll be Sinn Féin that'll be the ones that get going."
 IRE_sf_end_idea:9 "The Party of Law and Order"
 IRE_sf_end_idea_desc:9 "It is the view of many of Ireland's people that liberty cannot exist against the backdrop of chaos, and so the Sinn Féin government has carved itself out a winning identity as the \"Party of Law and Order\". While the appeals to the workers from Labour or those to Christian values from SC may be looked upon fondly, when it comes down to it the stability Sinn Féin has brought to the nation is a hard thing for any other party to contest."

Même si cette approche a certainement eu ses détracteurs, il est impossible de nier la popularité de la stabilité qu’elle a obtenue."
 IRE_sc_an_idea:0 "Corporatisme"
 IRE_sc_an_idea_desc:9 "Cherchant une alternative au capitalisme et au socialisme, le gouvernement irlandais a adopté une approche de « troisième voie » du corporatisme, inspirée notamment par les politiques similaires menées au Portugal et dans d’autres parties du continent. Bien qu'il s'agisse bien sûr avant tout d'un système économique, on espère qu'avec le temps, il imprégnera tous les niveaux de la société irlandaise et la transformera en un corps fort et unifié auquel tous les habitants de la nation contribueront."

 IRE_church_sc_idea_desc:9 "Alors que l'Irlande est une terre de nombreuses fois et confessions, avec la déclaration du catholicisme comme "Primus Inter Pares", ou "Premier parmi ses pairs", le gouvernement irlandais a clairement indiqué laquelle il considère comme la véritable foi de la nation, tout en tout en maintenant un certain niveau de respect pour les autres confessions.

Although few expect Ireland to ever be able to compete with the world's giants, it is hoped that by the end of the programme Ireland will be able to punch well above its small weight."
 IRE_urbanisation_idea:0 "Urbanisation"
 IRE_urbanisation_idea_desc:9 "Aiming to encourage migration from Ireland's countless small settlements into its cities, the government has begun a programme of mass urban house construction. Despite most of these houses being made from cheap simple materials, few can really complain about their comparatively improved standard of living."
 IRE_slaves_of_slaves_idea:9 "Liberating the Slaves of Slaves"
 IRE_slaves_of_slaves_idea_desc:9 "Hoping to finally make good on the promises of the Proclamation, the Irish Government has embarked on a campaign to promote gender equality through the promotion of many women to leading positions throughout the country. It is hoped that the knock on effects of having women in such influential positions will go a long way in shaping the views and perceptions towards them and their capabilities across wider Irish society."
 IRE_connolly_legacy_idea:9 "Connolly's Legacy"
 IRE_connolly_legacy_idea_desc:9 "\"If you remove the English Army tomorrow and hoist the green flag over Dublin Castle, unless you set about the organisation of the socialist republic your efforts will be in vain...\"\n\nWith the aim of tying themselves to the almost universally respected independence fighter, these words as first proclaimed by James Connolly have become an almost religious creed of socialists in Ireland. Few debates with opposition figures go by without at least one reference to Connolly, and the idea of honouring the legacy of this national hero has become a powerful motivator for the socialist cause."
 IRE_ituc_primacy:9 "Primauté du CSI"
 IRE_ituc_primacy_desc:9 "Grâce au rôle important qu'il a joué dans le mouvement syndical irlandais, le Congrès des Syndicats Irlandais a réussi à acquérir une position essentielle dans la politique irlandaise. Il semble clair que dans les années à venir, les décisions concernant l'avenir de la nation seront rarement prises sans la participation du CSI."
 IRE_syndicalist_final_idea:9 "From the Plough to the Stars"
 IRE_syndicalist_final_idea_desc:9 "It was once said that Ireland's people will only ever be free when they control all the means of production, \"everything from the plough to the stars\", and the Irish Syndicalist Party have made it their mission to ensure that they do. From extending the rights of women, expanding the role of unions in Irish society, and ensuring that Ireland is set on the path of worker-led industrialisation, it seems that in time they will have ensured a nation in which the destiny of Ireland's people is their own to decide."
 IRE_church_isp_idea:9 "Le Socialisme Chrétien"
 IRE_church_isp_idea_desc:9 "Alors que de nombreux mouvements socialistes rejettent les enseignements religieux au motif qu'ils seraient « l'opium des masses », le mouvement syndicaliste irlandais a tenté d'harmoniser les enseignements du catholicisme avec leurs doctrines socialistes, en mettant l'accent sur les concepts chrétiens de charité et de compassion."
 IRE_old_oppressor_idea:9 "Le vieil oppresseur"
 IRE_old_oppressor_idea_desc:9 "Comptant des ennemis à la fois de l’autre côté de l’Atlantique et de l’autre côté de la Manche, le gouvernement irlandais a concentré ses efforts sur la défaite des restes de l’Empire Britannique et le fait de contrecarrer toute tentative de « grand retour » de son roi."
 IRE_new_foe_idea:9 "Le nouvel ennemi"
 IRE_new_foe_idea_desc:9 "Avec des ennemis à la fois de l’autre côté de l’Atlantique et de l’autre côté de la Manche, le gouvernement irlandais a concentré la majorité de ses efforts sur la défaite de l’hégémonie allemande sur le continent, qu’il considère comme le plus grand obstacle à la croissance continue de la cause socialiste."
 IRE_agrarian_party_state:9 "Le Parti-État Agrarien"
 IRE_agrarian_party_state_desc:9 "Au lieu de concentrer le pouvoir entre les mains d’une seule figure faisant autorité comme des régimes similaires, Saor Éire a plutôt choisi de poursuivre une approche différente d’un État dans lequel le parti lui-même règne en maître au dessus de tout. Comme le postule le SÉ, si le parti est l'État, le parti doit bien sûr toujours agir dans l'intérêt de l'État et l'intérêt de l'État doit bien sûr toujours être l'intérêt du peuple."
 IRE_trade_union_centralisation:9 "Centralisation Syndicale"
 IRE_trade_union_centralisation_desc:9 "Invoquant les inefficacités résultant des délibérations et des désaccords, Saor Éire a choisi de réorganiser ses syndicats pour qu'ils soient dirigés par des personnes nommées par le comité directeur lui-même. Cependant, parmi les membres de ces syndicats, le sentiment commun selon lequel il ne s’agit que d’une prise de pouvoir commence à s’imposer."
 IRE_reorganised_ICA:9 "Une ICA réorganisée"
 IRE_reorganised_ICA_desc:9 "Des efforts ont été entrepris pour réorganiser l'Armée Citoyenne Irlandaise et la faire passer d'une simple force paramilitaire à une armée à part entière, capable de défendre la république contre les menaces externes et internes. Pour garantir la pureté idéologique des nouvelles recrues, l'enseignement de la doctrine socialiste est également devenu une partie obligatoire du service."
 IRE_red_trinity_idea:9 "La Trinité Rouge"
 IRE_red_trinity_idea_desc:9 "La vision politique de Saor Éire s’est diffusée dans toute la nation irlandaise. Chaque citoyen adulte de la nation a été mandaté pour devenir membre du parti, membre de l'armée et membre d'un syndicat, dans le but que chaque citoyen de la nation contribue à la révolution et la préserve quel qu'en soit le prix."

 IRE_defence_totalist_desc:9 "The policy of \"Athghabháil na hÉireann\", or \"Reconquest of Ireland\" has been established by the government as an attempt to both strengthen Gaelic identity as a form of decolonisation, and to foster patriotic militarism amongst its people to defend the nation if the need arises."
 IRE_church_se_idea:9 "Nouvel anticléricalisme"
 IRE_church_se_idea_desc:9 "L'Église catholique d'Irlande a une histoire longue et profondément enracinée qui lui permet d'être profondément liée à la fois à la culture et à la politique du pays. Ce sont précisément ces « racines » que Saor Éire a entrepris de rompre, dans le but de détruire l’influence de l’Église dans la nation et de construire un État libre de toute ingérence religieuse, quels que soient les troubles culturels que cela pourrait provoquer dans une nation aussi encline à la religion."

 IRE_needs_of_many_idea_desc:9 "With the goal of putting the common Irish people first, Ireland's government has set out to establish a grand array of social schemes for its people. Ranging from housing to healthcare it seems that these schemes will in the long term bring significant benefits to the Irish people, while of course also bringing significant costs for its government to maintain."

 goulding_chemicals: "Goulding Chemicals"
 goulding_chemicals_desc: "Les origines de Goulding Chemicals remontent à 1856, lorsqu'il s'agissait de fournir des engrais aux exploitations agricoles irlandaises. Grâce à une croissance régulière au fil des décennies, l'entreprise est devenue l'un des principaux fournisseurs de produits chimiques en Irlande."
 murphy_radio: "Murphy"
 murphy_radio_desc: "La société Murphy, plus connue sous le nom de "Murphy Radios", est une entreprise d'électronique populaire basée à Islandbridge, Dublin. Mettant l'accent sur la qualité et la durabilité, les radios Murphy haut de gamme sont devenues un succès non seulement en Irlande, mais aussi un article de luxe convoité sur le marché noir de l'Union britannique, où elles sont considérées comme "bourgeoises" par rapport à leurs rivales produites en masse. Grâce à ses normes élevées dans le domaine de l'électronique, Murphy serait un excellent partenaire dans le développement de l'électronique pour l'armée irlandaise."
 mcmullan_bros: "McMullan Bros. Ltd."
 mcmullan_bros_desc: "McMullan Bros, également connu sous les noms de "Maxol" et "Mex", est le principal négociant en produits chimiques d'Irlande. Les frères McMullan se sont fait connaître à l'époque du rationnement, pendant la Weltkrieg, en concluant un accord qui leur permettait d'importer de l'huile mexicaine dans le pays. L'Irlande ayant rompu ses liens avec la Grande-Bretagne, cet accord est devenu instantanément d'une importance vitale pour le nouvel État et a propulsé la société McMullan Bros. vers une rentabilité élevée. Aujourd'hui, avec plus de trois décennies d'expérience dans le domaine de la pétrochimie, ils sont des experts dans leur domaine."

 harland_wolff_3: "$harland_wolff$"
 harland_wolff_start: "Bien que Harland & Wolff soit de loin le plus connu en tant qu'entreprise de construction navale, sa taille est telle que des sous-sections de l'entreprise peuvent s'étendre à d'autres domaines. Avec une main-d'œuvre déjà expérimentée dans la construction d'armes militaires, Harland & Wolff peut facilement être déployée pour construire des armes en dehors de la variété navale,"
 harland_wolff_3_desc: "$harland_wolff_start$ cependant, étant donné leur familiarité avec les tourelles d'artillerie navale, la production de pièces d'artillerie terrestres est loin d'être exclue."

 james_mackie_sons_desc: "Fondée au milieu du XIXe siècle, "Mackie's" (comme on l'appelle localement) est une usine d'ingénierie de machines textiles située à Belfast. Toutefois, pendant la Weltkrieg, l'entreprise s'est reconvertie dans la fabrication de fournitures de guerre telles que les munitions, et peut le faire à nouveau si on le lui demande. Les employés de Mackies, qui se comptent par milliers, sont historiquement presque exclusivement protestants et sont peu enclins à changer..."
 john_rigby: "John Rigby & Company"
 john_rigby_desc: "John Rigby & Company est une entreprise anglo-irlandaise de fabrication d'armes à feu qui a changé de site entre l'Irlande et l'Angleterre à plusieurs reprises au cours de son histoire, mais qui semble pour l'instant fermement ancrée à Dublin, son lieu de fondation. Depuis les années 1910, la société Rigby est liée à Mauser et, depuis qu'elle a fui l'Union britannique dans les années 1920, elle a développé ce lien avec l'aide des relations germano-irlandaises en plein essor."
 o_gorman: "O'Gorman Ltd."
 o_gorman_desc: "O'Gorman Ltd est une entreprise de construction automobile spécialisée dans les autobus. Fait inhabituel pour une entreprise nationale, son siège principal n'est pas situé dans une ville, mais dans la ville rurale de Clonmel, Co. Tipperary, dans le sud du pays. Incitée à la création par l'ouverture de l'usine Ford à Cork, O'Gorman est prête à se mettre au service de la nation si on le lui demande."

Soudainement mise en possession de l'ensemble de l'infrastructure ferroviaire irlandaise, mais sans la plupart des connaissances institutionnelles de l'ère britannique, GSR a parfois eu du mal à s'en sortir. Toutefois, la militarisation et l'apport supplémentaire de l'appareil d'État pourraient s'avérer bénéfiques pour le succès à long terme de la société."

 aer_lingus: "Aer Lingus"
 aer_lingus_desc: "Aer Lingus est la flotte aérienne commerciale nationale contrôlée par l'État irlandais. En tant que petite nation insulaire, le transport aérien était nécessaire, mais son coût était prohibitif, ce qui décourageait la plupart des entreprises privées. Pour éviter que l'Irlande ne prenne du retard par rapport au reste de l'Europe, l'État est intervenu et a créé sa propre compagnie aérienne. Grâce aux nombreux contacts internationaux civils, militaires et industriels établis au cours de sa formation, l'idée a été émise de produire à petite échelle des modèles importés modifiés, une idée que le gouvernement pourrait réexaminer à l'avenir."
 iona: "Iona Airways"
 iona_desc: "Un peu les hors-la-loi de l'aviation irlandaise, Iona Airways a été créée en 1931 par un vendeur de voitures d'occasion, Hugh Cahill, sur un terrain d'aviation près de son garage à Dublin, sans l'aide du gouvernement. La compagnie n'a pas été créée dans l'intention de proposer des voyages commerciaux, mais plutôt pour fournir des avions aux amateurs d'aviation et aux touristes. Les premiers vols ont vu la compagnie effectuer des atterrissages illégaux dans des champs et sur des plages, au grand dam des autorités, mais pour le plus grand plaisir du public. Bien que la compagnie assure aujourd'hui quelques vols entre l'Irlande et l'Allemagne, l'opportunité d'obtenir une injection de fonds grâce à un contrat gouvernemental serait rapidement accueillie."
 short_brothers: "Short Brothers"
 short_brothers_desc: "La société Short Brothers, basée à l'origine en Angleterre, a été l'une des premières au monde à concevoir et à produire des avions, et même avant cela, à créer des ballons militaires. Pendant la Weltkrieg, Short Brothers a fourni à l'armée de l'air britannique naissante ses premiers biplans armés. Les Short Brothers n'ont pas quitté la Grande-Bretagne immédiatement après la révolution, mais comme l'économie a été radicalement modifiée dans le sens du syndicalisme, les fondateurs ont fini par s'installer à Belfast, aux côtés de nombreux autres exilés. Bien qu'ils aient diversifié leur activité en créant des bus et des tramways, ils seraient heureux de pouvoir produire à nouveau des avions militaires."

 harland_wolff: "Harland & Wolff"
 harland_wolff_desc: "Plus grande entreprise de construction navale incontestée de Belfast, Harland & Wolff a été responsable de la construction de certains des plus grands navires commerciaux et militaires jamais construits dans l'ancien Royaume-Uni. Secouée par l'effondrement du Royaume-Uni, l'entreprise a évité de sombrer à son tour dans les années 1920 en construisant des navires pour des marines nombreuses et variées dans le monde entier. Dans un pays dominé par l'agriculture et les industries légères, la taille et l'ampleur de l'industrie lourde de Harland & Wolff ne peuvent être sous-estimées."

L'opportunité de travailler avec le gouvernement sera bien accueillie, car elle leur permettra non seulement d'augmenter à nouveau leur production, mais aussi de mettre à profit leur expertise des années passées."
