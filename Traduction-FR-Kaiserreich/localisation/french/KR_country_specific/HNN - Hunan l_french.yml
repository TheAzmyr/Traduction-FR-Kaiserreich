Born in 1880 in Hengyang, Zhao Hengti attended the Imperial Japanese Army Academy, graduating with a specialisation in the field of artillery. He joined the Tongmenghui under Sun Yat-sen and participated in both the Xinhai Revolution and the Second Revolution as a military commander. After the failure of the Second Revolution, Zhao was imprisoned by Yuan Shikai. After his release, he was appointed as the commander-in-chief of the Hunan Army, and the governor of Hunan Province.\nZhao Hengti introduced the first provincial constitutional movement in Asia, formulated the Hunan Provincial Constitution, established a democratic provincial council and gubernatorial elections. As governor of Hunan, Zhao limited his power as the governor, a move commended by many.\nWith the onset of the Northern Expedition, Zhao was pushed out of Hunan in favour of his rival, Tang Shengzhi. He sought help from Wu Peifu, who restored Zhao as the governor. However, his position was as a military governor appointed by the Central Government, not as an elected governor as he wanted himself to be.\nZhao Hengti was tied to the League of Eight Provinces, and although he was the one who holds the most power over his province, not answering to Sun Chuanfang in Nanjing, he chose to stick with him to avoid troubles with Germany."

 HNN_tang_shengzhi: "Tang Shengzhi"
 HNN_tang_shengzhi_leader_desc: "Né le 12 octobre 1889 et originaire du Hunan, Tang Shengzhi a réussi à reprendre le pouvoir après plus d'une décennie. Diplômé de l'académie militaire de Baoding et bouddhiste convaincu, Tang a joué un rôle de premier plan dans l'armée du Hunan avant que des tensions internes n'entraînent sa défection au profit de l'Armée Nationale Révolutionnaire pendant l'Expédition du Nord. Là, il a été nommé gouverneur pour le KMT, mais a finalement été chassé avec l'effondrement de l'ANR. Contraint à l'exil, la notoriété de son frère et ses intrigues politiques astucieuses lui ont permis de retourner dans le Hunan et de défier avec succès le gouverneur en place, Zhao Hengti, lors des élections.\n\nTriomphant, Tang cherche maintenant à mettre en œuvre sa version du socialisme bouddhiste. Selon sa doctrine, le bouddhisme et le socialisme sont identiques, le matérialisme et le spiritualisme sont interconnectés. Toutefois, cela ne signifie pas qu'il peut considérer le soutien des bouddhistes comme acquis et, pour beaucoup, ses approches de la foi sont beaucoup trop révolutionnaires. Il reste à voir si ce soi-disant général bouddhiste peut vraiment transformer le Hunan pour le mieux."
 HNN_tang_shengzhi_commander_desc: "§YGeneral Description\nBorn:§! §gOctober 12th, 1889, in Dong'an County, Hunan, Qing Empire§!\n§YMilitary Career:§! §gAfter successfully enrolling in Baoding military academy, Tang Shengzhi would begin a long career in Hunan as an officer in Zhao Hengti's Clique. As Zhao emerged victorious in the 1921 election, he would bring Tang to prominence but this alliance would soon end with Tang growing jealous of Zhao's favouritism towards other military commands. Tang bided his time however, and saw his chance with the 1926 Northern Expedition. Joining up with the National Revolutionary Army, Tang ousted his former master and established his own administration under the auspices of the KMT. Deviating from his new bosses however, he began a Buddhisisation campaign, a syncretic Buddhist-Leftist programme. This would not last long however, before German intervention allowed for the Zhili government pushed out KMT forces from the region and brought Zhao back in tow. Tang fled to the concessions, where he would hide for several years in exile.\n\nThis was not the end however of Tang Shengzhi. Tang Shengming, his younger brother, proved popular enough to remain a general within the Hunan military and soon enough was able to rekindle support among the officers for Tang Shengzhi to return. Taking a risk, the older Tang returned to Hunan where Zhao proved too weak to order his arrest, instead opting to outmanoeuvre his old General in elections. Tang, for his part, has decided to take the political route as well - but regardless it is clear that his position in the military will be difficult to dislodge…"

Cela lui permet de passer l'examen de la fonction publique et d'étudier à l'Académie Yuelu de Changsha avant de se réorienter vers une carrière militaire à l'Académie militaire de Hunan. Plus tard, il se rendra au Japon pour poursuivre ses études, où il rencontrera les leaders en herbe du Tongmenghui. Il se convertit à leur cause après avoir rencontré Sun Yatsen, et après avoir obtenu son diplôme de l'Académie de l'armée impériale japonaise, il rejoint la révolution Xinhai qui éclate en 1911. Général du KMT de longue date, il dirige l'invasion du Hunan par l'ANR lors de l'expédition du Nord et participe à la mise en place d'un gouvernement provincial sous la direction de Tang Shengzhi. L'échec de l'expédition a toutefois contraint Cheng à s'exiler, du moins jusqu'à l'émergence d'une rébellion dans le Fujian. C'est là qu'il retrouvera la célébrité. Cependant, à l'annonce d'une nouvelle élection dans le Hunan, Cheng décide de prendre un congé et de disputer le poste de gouverneur au gouverneur en place, Zhao Hengti.\n\nCheng sort victorieux de l'élection, ce qui lui permet de commencer à mettre en œuvre les Trois Principes du Peuple et le programme du KMT dans la province. Cependant, il est considéré avec une certaine suspicion par ses anciens camarades. En effet, malgré sa loyauté supposée envers le Comité Central de Gauche, beaucoup pensent qu'il continue secrètement à s'affilier aux éléments de droite du KMT..."
 HNN_cheng_qian_commander_desc: "§YGeneral Description\nBorn:§! §gMarch 31st, 1882, in Liling, Hunan, Qing Empire§!\n§YMilitary Career:§! §gBorn to a prosperous landlord family in Hunan, Cheng received a traditional Confucian education and passed the imperial examinations with the first degree in the hopes of becoming a scholar. However, realising the political situation of late 19th century China, he instead pursued a career in the military. He attended the Hunan Military Academy and then went to Japan, where he studied and met revolutionaries such as Huang Xing, Song Jiaoren, and Li Liejun. In 1905, he met Sun Yat-sen and joined Sun’s Tongmenghui. He would graduate from the Imperial Japanese Academy alongside Tang Jiyao, specialising in the field of artillery.\n\nWhen the Xinhai Revolution broke out in 1911, he took part in the Battle of Changsha. He then became military governor of Hunan but was driven out when Yuan Shikai took power. He would demonstrate his loyalty to Sun’s ideals by joining the Kuomintang and aiding Sun in the National Protection War and the Constitutional Protection Movements. One of Sun’s closest allies in his war against Chen Jiongming, he became a military instructor preparing for the Northern expedition.\n\nHowever, when the Northern Expedition did come, he led the Sixth Army in the Battle for Nanchang. However, after the expedition’s defeat, he retreated with the remnants of the National Revolutionary Army to the MinGan Insurgent Zone. Nonetheless, he still commands a great deal of respect in Hunan, and it is likely that he still holds a lot of political influence there."

 HNN_tang_shengming_commander_desc: "§YGeneral Description\nBorn:§! §g1906, in Dong'an County, Hunan, Qing Empire§!\n§YMilitary Career:§! §gThe younger brother of the more famous Tang Shengzhi, General Tang Shengming is nonetheless not one to be underestimated. A graduate from Whampoa Military academy in 1926, on the eve of the Northern expedition, he would join the KMT and his elder brother in their efforts to liberate China. Although initially successful, the expedition would collapse with German intervention. Despite the elder Tang's exile from Hunan following the failure of the Northern Expedition and his Buddhist Socialist programme, Tang Shengming's rare ability to get along with virtually anybody resulted in him remaining in Hunan and even gaining a position of prominence within the Hunan military. He has secretly utilised this position to rehabilitate his brother's image among the people and also cultivate extensive ties within the military. He hopes to smoothen the way for a return of Tang Shengzhi and the rise of the Hunan Buddhisisation Society."

However, his unruly nature as a child resulted in him being sent to a private school, where he was given a strict education. He would enrol in the Hunan Military academy in 1905, before going to Japan to study. There he would join the Tongmenghui, participating in the Xinhai revolution before returning to Hunan in 1916 to join its local army. Although initially joining the Kuomintang during their Northern Expedition into Hunan, a timely defection by He Yaozu and his division helped shield him from the major political ramifications of the defeat. Although talented, his past associations means he is not likely to rise above a regional level of authority - however he remains a prominent member of the Hunan military staff."

 HNN_peng_dehuai: "Peng Dehuai"
 HNN_peng_dehuai_commander_desc: "§YGeneral Description\nBorn:§! §gOctober 24th, 1888, in Xiangtan County, Hunan, Qing Empire§!\n§YMilitary Career:§! §gPeng Dehuai was born in the village of Shixiang to a poor family of farmers. Although his family did not have much in the way of means, Peng would listen to his grandfather, a veteran of the Taiping rebellion, describe the ideals of social and economic equality. Initially able to go to a traditional Confucian school, his family's declining economic prosperity forced him to withdraw and beg for money to help support his family. After losing many of his family members to poverty, including his mother, he found himself working at a coal mine. It was around then that the Xinhai revolution broke out - and Peng found himself further destitute as the economy declined. He would join a local warlord army as an enlisted man and rise through the ranks - at one point his regiment joined with Tang Shengzhi's army. There Peng fought for Sun Yat-sen's forces against Wu Peifu's local allies. His attempt to join the Kuomintang in 1922 left him disillusioned however, and he initially returned home to become a farmer. Dissatisfied, he then applied to the Hunan military academy, taking on the name Dehuai. His regiment would initially back the Kuomintang during its invasion of Hunan, but Peng himself hesitated. This hesitation proved to be useful when the tide turned, and Peng successfully defected back to Zhili lines."

 HNN_he_jian_commander_desc: "§YGeneral Description\nBorn:§! §gApril 10th, 1887, in Liling County, Hunan, Qing Empire§!\n§YMilitary Career:§! §gBorn to a farming family in Hunan, He Jian was initially slated for civil service before entering the Baoding Military Academy in the post-Xinhai era. A battalion commander, two years after his graduation he would build a guerilla force to resist an invasion by Zhang Jingyao, which earned him the attention of Cheng Qian who promoted him as commander of local guerilla forces. Tang Shengzhi would then take him under his wing, and He Jian would fight for the Kuomintang during the Northern Expedition. The collapse of the NRA in 1927, however, initially set him adrift but a general amnesty in Hunan for those who were willing to defect proved to be a fortuitous opportunity for many of Tang's subordinates. He Jian now finds himself in the service of the Hunan military, but it is widely speculated that his loyalties, as well as many others, remain with Tang rather than Zhao."

 HNN_song_xilian: "Song Xilian"
 HNN_song_xilian_commander_desc: "§YGeneral Description\nBorn:§! §gApril 9th, 1907, in Xiangxiang County, Hunan, Qing Empire§!\n§YMilitary Career:§! §gAfter completing middle school, Song Xilian was fortunate enough to be admitted into the Army Lecture School run by Cheng Qian. He was then admitted into the first class of Whampoa military academy, and became the youngest graduate of the academy in 1924, joining the Kuomintang shortly afterwards. A friend of Chen Geng, he would initially flirt with the leftist part of the party, but the collapse of the Kuomintang in 1927 meant the future of the then 20 year old officer was drastically altered. Set adrift, he went to Japan to study for several years before returning home to Hunan to offer his services. There, he found plenty of old associates of Cheng Qian and the KMT serving in the Hunan army and was able to leverage his connections to slowly achieve a place of prominence in the regional forces."

 HNN_he_long_commander_desc: "§YGeneral Description\nBorn:§! §gMarch 22nd, 1896, in Sangzhi, Hunan, Qing Empire§!\n§YMilitary Career:§! §gGrowing up in a poor peasant family, He Long received little formal education as a child. Nonetheless, it would appear he had inherited some military skills from his father, a minor Qing officer, and at age 20 he began his long career as a guerilla leader after he killed a tax assessor out of revenge for the murder of his indebted uncle. Since then his legend as an outlaw and a Robin-hood figure has only grown, as He Long and his trusty signature knife built a local army right in time for the rise of the Kuomintang in 1920. A teacher and commander during the Northern expedition, He Long would soon find himself aligned with socialist elements of the party while serving under Zhang Fakui. The defeat of the KMT during the Northern Expedition has not sated his desire for change in China, and though he has fled back home to Hunan, he still commands the respect of his soldiers. His skills as a revolutionary are not to be underestimated, and he will be a useful asset to any army."

An eager socialist and affiliate of the Chinese Syndicalist Party, he would serve as chairman of the Hunan Provincial Farmer’s Association. The failure of the Northern expedition drove the young officer underground, where he would lead a brief resistance before accepting a general amnesty offer to join the local Hunan army under Peng Dehuai. A promising officer, Teng has achieved regional prominence despite his previous ties with revolutionary groups. Teng is also notable for being a member of the Miao people, a minority group in Hunan."

In 1923 Zhao gave Ye command over Hunan’s Third Division\n\nWhen the Northern Expedition came to Hunan it was Ye Kaixin who immediately brought his army against Tang Shengzhi, but was forced out of Hunan and fled with Zhao to Wu Peifu and the Zhili. Wu made Ye the Commander-in-Chief of the Hunan Army, and when the Northern Expedition turned to favour the Zhili, it was Ye’s forces that recaptured Changsha, bringing it under Zhili control officially, but it was an open secret that Ye wanted to bring Zhao back into power in Hunan.\n\nLuckily for the General, Wu Peifu decided to appoint Zhao as the Governor of Hunan, and civilian control over the province soon came back as the KMT’s forces were driven out. While not the biggest fan of Sun Chuanfang, he accepted Hunan’s entrance into the League of Eight Provinces, although he prefers to keep his army on the eastern border, not trusting Sun to accept Hunan’s autonomy, or put down the insurgency in the Min-Gan zone.\n\nFor nearly the last decade, Ye Kaixin has been satisfied with the Status Quo, loyal to Zhao and friendly with the Northern Zhili, he’s one of the main Generals Zhao can rely on without worry, and has enjoyed the support of the Governor of Hunan."

 HNN_All_the_Joy_in_the_World_desc: "La vraie joie consiste à apprécier les autres et à se réjouir de leur bien-être. Chacun possède en lui une source de joie, et plus on s'abreuve à cette source, mieux c'est pour son propre bonheur abondant, et plus il devient généreux de savourer la joie d'autrui. Au lieu de financer des rituels religieux, il faudrait encourager la philanthropie au profit des pauvres et maximiser la joie des gens."

 HNN_Nationalize_Industry: "Collectiviser l'industrie"
 HNN_Nationalize_Industry_desc: "Pendant trop longtemps, notre industrie n'a pas été la propriété de la province. Maintenant, nous allons la nationaliser et transformer l'industrie des capitalistes et des puissances étrangères en industrie de la province, propriété de l'État et des coopératives."

 HNN_Solve_the_Landlord_Problem: "Organiser des sociétés paysannes"
 HNN_Solve_the_Landlord_Problem_desc: "Les propriétaires corrompus exploitent depuis longtemps leurs locataires, leur soutirant de l'argent et les privant de leur bien-être. Il est impératif que la province s'attaque à ce problème. Lors de l'Expédition du Nord, des sociétés paysannes ont été organisées par des anarchistes locaux pour lutter contre les propriétaires terriens. Nous gagnerons maintenant à réorganiser les organisations paysannes tout en évitant leur radicalisation."

 HNN_Support_Local_Universities: "Soutenir les universités locales"
 HNN_Support_Local_Universities_desc: "L'éducation dans le Hunan est toujours dans une situation désastreuse. Nous devrions ouvrir des "universités locales" pour les paysans. Ces universités, converties à partir de temples locaux et dont le personnel est principalement composé de moines, devraient servir de moyen pour réduire considérablement l'analphabétisme."

 HNN_Aid_Our_Workers: "Conciliation des classes"
 HNN_Aid_Our_Workers_desc: "Les travailleurs du Hunan ont enduré d'innombrables années d'oppression. Cela va à l'encontre de notre doctrine bouddhiste. Nous devons maintenant les aider à améliorer leur statut social et à mettre fin à la pauvreté persistante qui les a accablés. Les paysans, les travailleurs, les hommes d'affaires, les étudiants et les soldats sont tous pour le bouddhisme."

 HNN_The_Gender_Issue: "La question de l'égalité des genres"
 HNN_The_Gender_Issue_desc: "Traditionnellement, le bouddhisme considère les femmes comme inférieures et enclines aux désirs charnels. C'est pourtant faux, le Bouddha reconnaît la différence entre les deux sexes, mais il est partisan de l'égalité entre les hommes et les femmes. Nous devrions encourager les femmes à être plus actives pour construire notre nouvelle société, tant sur le plan matériel que spirituel. "

 HNN_Protect_Ethnic_Minorities: "Incorporer les minorités ethniques"
 HNN_Protect_Ethnic_Minorities_desc: "Dans l'ouest et le sud du Hunan, nous avons une population importante de minorités ethniques.

 HNN_Sharing_the_Land: "Partager la terre"
 HNN_Sharing_the_Land_desc: "Maintenant que nous nous sommes occupés des propriétaires, nous allons procéder à une réforme foncière majeure, afin de répartir la terre de manière égale et équitable entre ceux qui devraient la posséder - le peuple."

 HNN_Welfare: "Un État providence bouddhiste"
 HNN_Welfare_desc: "Notre peuple n'a pas le droit d'être pauvre. Tout le monde devrait être libéré de la peur et de la souffrance. Alors que nous sommes encore très pauvres, nous devrions chercher à mettre en place un filet de sécurité sociale, notamment un revenu garanti, afin d'améliorer le bien-être de chacun et de lui donner une plus grande liberté pour cultiver sa personnalité."

 HNN_Indoctrinate_the_People: "Endoctriner le peuple"
 HNN_Indoctrinate_the_People_desc: "Nous allons endoctriner le peuple dans le socialisme bouddhiste. Nous prêcherons les enseignements du général Tang Shengzhi, du maître Gu Jingyuan et d'autres moines modernes. Tous connaîtront nos idéaux, et nous entrerons dans une nouvelle ère de prospérité et de paix."

 HNN_Provincial_Curriculum: "Programme provincial d'études"
 HNN_Provincial_Curriculum_desc: "Nous devons réformer notre programme d'études pour l'adapter au socialisme bouddhiste et créer une manière plus efficace d'enseigner et d'apprendre. Notre prochaine génération devrait être capable de combiner spiritualisme et matérialisme. Nous couvrirons une grande variété de sujets, de la moralité civile à la physique, et encouragerons la curiosité des étudiants."

 HNN_Zhaos_Rule: "Règle de Zhao"
 HNN_Zhaos_Rule_desc: "Son mandat étant désormais incontestable, la vision de Zhao Hengti pour un Hunan libre et moral peut enfin être mise en œuvre."

 HNN_Clamp_Down_on_Dissent: "Réprimer la dissidence"
 HNN_Clamp_Down_on_Dissent_desc: "Zhao Hengti s'est entouré de personnes issues de tous les horizons politiques, y compris de ceux qui auraient pu devenir ses alliés. Toutefois, avec son récent virage vers l'autoritarisme, de nombreux modérés et constitutionnalistes qui s'étaient ralliés à lui sont maintenant entrés dans l'opposition. Ces hommes doivent être écartés."

 HNN_Purge_the_Socialists: "Purger les socialistes"
 HNN_Purge_the_Socialists_desc: "Le socialisme menace d'infecter le peuple avec ses mensonges et ses intentions malveillantes. Avec le socialisme, il ne peut y avoir de compromis. Éliminons par la force toutes les organisations politiques ouvertement socialistes."

 HNN_Hunt_Tang_Shengzhi: "Chasser Tang Shengzh"
 HNN_Hunt_Tang_Shengzhi_desc: "Le général bouddhiste continue de nous harceler depuis des régions inconnues. Nous devons le trouver et l'éliminer par un effort national concerté."

 HNN_Destroy_His_Influence: "Éliminer la société de bouddhisation"
 HNN_Destroy_His_Influence_desc: "Avec Tang Shengzhi entre nos mains, nous pouvons maintenant porter notre attention sur ses autres partisans. Ses lieutenants subiront le même sort que leur chef."

 HNN_Provincial_Stability: "Hunan, Stable et Fort"
 HNN_Provincial_Stability_desc: "Les socialistes ont été détruits, et avec eux, de nombreux organes de dissidence populaire. Les journaux de quartier, les grandes gueules de village et autres ont tous été réduits au silence. Nous ne pouvons pas permettre que de nouveaux rabatteurs se lèvent à leur place. Les villages doivent tous avoir des responsables dont la seule occupation est de veiller à ce que les informations correctes parviennent aux masses."

 HNN_Drive_out_Federalism: "Chasser les partisans de Cheng"
 HNN_Drive_out_Federalism_desc: "Selon les critères de l'actuel KMT, Cheng Qian est un modéré. Cependant, ses activités de plaidoyer sapent notre contrôle en cette période des plus dangereuses. Cheng, et ceux de ses partisans qui peuvent être capturés le plus facilement, doivent être éliminés. Les nationalistes qui se cachent dans les marges recevront justice en temps voulu."

 HNN_Educate_the_People: "Le programme d'éducation de Huang Shiheng"
 HNN_Educate_the_People_desc: "Huang Shiheng, un bohémien aux multiples talents ayant reçu une éducation occidentale, a grandement amélioré l'école de commerce de Hunan en tant que président. Fervent partisan de notre régime, nous devrions mettre en œuvre son plan récemment formulé pour transformer le système éducatif."

 HNN_Satisfy_the_Workers: "Satisfaire les travailleurs"
 HNN_Satisfy_the_Workers_desc: "Les organisations syndicales urbaines peuvent être une source de grande instabilité si elles sont contrariées, ou une merveilleuse aubaine si elles sont correctement gérées. En travaillant en étroite collaboration avec ces groupes, notre régime n'en sera que plus fort."

 HNN_Under_the_Law: "Tous sont égaux devant la loi"
 HNN_Under_the_Law_desc: "Les nombreux groupes minoritaires du Hunan craignent le caractère fort de notre régime. Nous devons rencontrer les dirigeants locaux afin de leur offrir des garanties pour la protection de leur intégrité communautaire. Nous aiderons tous ceux qui nous aident."

 HNN_Expel_Enemies: "Expulser les ennemis de Zhao"
 HNN_Expel_Enemies_desc: "Ceux qui lèvent encore le poing contre Zhao doivent être publiquement expulsés, obligés de traverser notre frontière sous la menace d'une arme, leurs biens à la main. Cela en ébranlera certainement plus d'un."

 HNN_Populist_Ways: "Revitaliser le néo-confucianisme"
 HNN_Populist_Ways_desc: "Le Hunan est un centre du néo-confucianisme. Zeng Guofan a revitalisé le néo-confucianisme pour invoquer la loyauté et l'esprit de combat de notre peuple. Nous devons faire de même en promouvant les doctrines néo-confucéennes et en lisant les classiques pour résister à la corruption de la culture moderne."

 HNN_The_Spirit_of_Nationalism: "L'esprit du nationalisme chinois"
 HNN_The_Spirit_of_Nationalism_desc: "Le KMT est incroyablement doué pour inspirer le dévouement à ses idéaux. Sans adopter leurs idées horribles, nous devons adopter leurs techniques de propagande pour avoir un effet suffisant sur notre peuple."

 HNN_Eliminate_the_Left_KMT: "Éliminer le KMT de gauche dans le Hunan"
 HNN_Eliminate_the_Left_KMT_desc: "Le temps est venu d'extirper les dernières cellules d'irréductibles du KMT qui infestent le pays."

 HNN_Constitutionalism_Forever: "Constitutionnalisme pour toujours"
 HNN_Constitutionalism_Forever_desc: "La croyance dans le document fondateur d'une nation présente de nombreux avantages. Le nôtre doit être tout aussi ambitieux et large dans ses garanties de démocratie et de liberté."

 HNN_Hunannese_Unity: "Unité de Xiang"
 HNN_Hunannese_Unity_desc: "Que notre nation coule comme la rivière Xiang, bienveillante à l'égard de tous ceux qui veulent s'y établir, avec une force presque inégalée dans les moments difficiles. Nous devons garantir aux minorités du Hunan que nous les respecterons et les enjoindrons si elles respectent à leur tour le grand destin qui nous attend."

 HNN_Foster_Patriotism: "Encourager le patriotisme"
 HNN_Foster_Patriotism_desc: "N'étant qu'une province de la Chine avec une diversité considérable, peu s'identifient uniquement comme Hunanais. En soulignant notre place dans le grand projet chinois et les valeurs auxquelles nous aspirons, nous pouvons commencer à cultiver au moins un sentiment patriotique, sinon une identité unifiée."

 HNN_The_Anti_Socialist_Campaign: "La Campagne Anti-Socialiste"
 HNN_The_Anti_Socialist_Campaign_desc: "Le socialisme est une source inépuisable de corruption morale. En effet, peut-être même nos plus grands ennemis de gauche auraient-ils pu être des alliés dans un autre monde où ils n'auraient pas entendu le chant de ses sirènes. Pour précipiter des campagnes futures plus ciblées, nous devons faire prendre conscience aux gens de la méchanceté du socialisme."

 HNN_Guaranteed_Liberty: "Garantir la liberté individuelle"
 HNN_Guaranteed_Liberty_desc: "Certains accusent Zhao Hengti d'avoir des tendances autoritaires. Avec une charte de base des droits individuels en main, nous prouverons que ces critiques ont tort."

 HNN_The_Rights_of_Man: "Les Droits de l'Homme"
 HNN_The_Rights_of_Man_desc: "Bien qu'il ne s'agisse pas d'une loi en soi, nous devrions officiellement approuver une liste complète de droits généraux à accorder à la population du Hunan. Cela devrait servir de force modératrice robuste pour tout futur dictateur en puissance."

 HNN_Traditional_Values: "Valeurs Traditionnelles"
 HNN_Traditional_Values_desc: "Pour apaiser les éléments particulièrement conservateurs qui s'opposent à notre attachement au constitutionnalisme libéral, nous devons également réaffirmer la position particulière des valeurs et de la culture traditionnelles du Hunan au regard de la loi."

 HNN_Provincial_Schools: "Institutionnaliser les écoles de village"
 HNN_Provincial_Schools_desc: "Pour favoriser véritablement l'unité, il faut que tous soient élevés avec les mêmes valeurs. Les écoles locales devraient être placées sous le contrôle des institutions des villes pour parvenir à l'uniformité."

 HNN_Changsha_University_Expansion: "Extension de l'université de Changsha"
 HNN_Changsha_University_Expansion_desc: "Ce qui n'était au départ qu'un institut d'études commerciales et économiques est devenu la première université du Hunan. Avec le soutien de l'État, l'université de Changsha pourrait même rivaliser avec les institutions de l'Ouest."

 HNN_The_Hunan_Identity: "Réformer l'éthique confucéenne"
 HNN_The_Hunan_Identity_desc: "Nous devons travailler à l'émergence d'une nouvelle éthique qui réconciliera la tradition confucéenne et les valeurs républicaines, et qui revendiquera l'identité unique de notre province. Le Hunan sera à la pointe de l'innovation intellectuelle et de la rénovation morale en Chine. "

 HNN_The_Question_of_Women: "Renforcer les capacités des femmes hunanaises"
 HNN_The_Question_of_Women_desc: "Traditionnellement, les femmes sont censées rester à la maison, mais cette pratique n'est pas adaptée aux exigences de notre époque. Les rôles et les postes auxiliaires dans les usines et les ateliers devraient être occupés par les femmes patriotes de la nation, libérant ainsi les hommes pour le service en première ligne."

 HNN_Zun_Lao: "Nouvelle piété filiative"
 HNN_Zun_Lao_desc: "La piété filiale, ou Xiao, est le pilier de notre société. Cependant, la tradition patriarcale du confucianisme a besoin d'être réformée pour être compatible avec de nouvelles valeurs comme la liberté et les droits de l'homme. Nous devons promouvoir une nouvelle piété filiale pour renforcer notre unité, en combattant en même temps l'autoritarisme traditionnel et l'individualisme sans limites."

 HNN_Ai_You: "Jeunes Pionniers"
 HNN_Ai_You_desc: "Notre prochaine génération doit être dotée d'une éthique confucéenne, de valeurs républicaines et d'un esprit militariste. Pour encourager l'unité, la santé et la préparation militaire, de nouvelles organisations nationales de jeunesse devraient être créées et faire l'objet d'une promotion agressive."

 HNN_New_Xiang_Culture: "Nouvelle Culture Xiang"
 HNN_New_Xiang_Culture_desc: "Nous pouvons avoir des familles originaires de toutes les régions de Chine. Nous pouvons être de différentes ethnies, à l'Ouest et au Sud. Mais une chose est vraie : nous sommes tous des Hunanais, unis par un lien commun avec cette terre légendaire. Il n'y a pas de différence entre nous. La couleur de notre peau n'a pas d'importance. Notre langue n'a pas d'importance. En fin de compte, nous sommes tous des enfants du Hunan, et nous le protégerons ensemble !"

 HNN_Hunan_Under_the_Kuomintang: "Le Hunan sous le Kuomintang"
 HNN_Hunan_Under_the_Kuomintang_desc: "Le Kuomintang a pris le pouvoir dans le Hunan. Avec une direction bien pensée, le Hunan, et peut-être toute la Chine, s'amélioreront sûrement."

 HNN_Align_with_the_Leftists: "S'aligner sur les gauchistes"
 HNN_Align_with_the_Leftists_desc: "Alors que Cheng Qian est une sorte de modéré, ceux qui restent fidèles au KMT ont pris un virage à gauche. Nous devons embrasser cette évolution."

 HNN_Spread_Leftist_KMT_Thought: "Répandre la pensée gauchiste du KMT"
 HNN_Spread_Leftist_KMT_Thought_desc: "La droite du KMT est en grande partie vaincue, mais beaucoup s'accrochent encore aux idées de droite. Nous devons nous assurer que tous les membres du parti possédant une quelconque autorité passent un test rigoureux de rectitude idéologique."

 HNN_Raise_Kuomintang_Militia: "Lever les milices du Kuomintang"
 HNN_Raise_Kuomintang_Militia_desc: "Le Kuomintang a mis en place des groupes paramilitaires dans tout le pays depuis l'intervention allemande. Nous devrions les incorporer directement dans les forces armées."

 HNN_Arm_the_Farmers: "Armer les paysans"
 HNN_Arm_the_Farmers_desc: "Même dans les meilleures conditions, le peuple subira de nombreuses injustices. Afin de les protéger contre ces certitudes et d'accroître leur disponibilité, nous devrions distribuer des armes et des munitions aux agriculteurs, à condition qu'ils s'entraînent semi-régulièrement avec une milice locale."

 HNN_Study_Sanmin_Zhuyi: "Étudier Sanmin Zhuyi"
 HNN_Study_Sanmin_Zhuyi_desc: "Minzu - un nationalisme typiquement chinois, Minquan - le pouvoir populaire, et Minsheng - le bien-être populaire, ce sont les Trois Principes du Peuple. Établis par Sun Yat Sen, ils guident le Kuomintang jusqu'à ce jour, inspirant souvent une ferveur quasi religieuse. Nous devons encourager l'étude de cette grande idéologie, peut-être jusqu'aux examens bureaucratiques d'autrefois."

 HNN_Our_Own_Path: "Notre Propre voie"
 HNN_Our_Own_Path_desc: "Nous ne devons pas être freinés par les convictions des autres. Le parti de Sun Yat Sen a toujours été hétérogène et il le sera toujours."

 HNN_Improve_Farmer_Livelihoods: "Améliorer les conditions de vie des agriculteurs"
 HNN_Improve_Farmer_Livelihoods_desc: "Alors que de nombreux politiciens se concentrent sur les demandes des villes, la majeure partie de la Chine reste rurale. Pour gagner le cœur et l'esprit de la population, nous devons également veiller à ce que les agriculteurs puissent survivre aux périodes difficiles. Lorsque les prix baissent, le gouvernement doit prendre le relais."

 HNN_Social_Welfare_Program: "Programme de Protection Sociale"
 HNN_Social_Welfare_Program_desc: "La portée et la nature de la protection sociale évoluent rapidement. Alors que les nations européennes proposent aujourd'hui des programmes et des services de retraite solides, ceux-ci ne sont présents nulle part en Chine. Nous devrions remédier à cette situation et commencer au moins à offrir aux plus démunis les produits de première nécessité."

 HNN_Zhiquan_Reform_Provincial_Administration: "Zhiquan - Réformer l'administration"
 HNN_Zhiquan_Reform_Provincial_Administration_desc: "Zhiquan, les pouvoirs de l'administration, décrit l'idée de Sun Yat Sen d'un gouvernement composé de cinq branches distinctes. Nous devons réorganiser notre régime selon ces principes."

 HNN_Crackdown_on_Corruption: "Lutte contre la corruption"
 HNN_Crackdown_on_Corruption_desc: "Une grande partie de la valeur productive de Hunan est aspirée par les administrateurs locaux. Avec notre règle sécurisée, nous pouvons forcer les vieux administrateurs à quitter leurs postes et les remplacer par les membres du parti les plus solides idéologiquement."

 HNN_Reform_Bureaucracy: "Réformer la bureaucratie"
 HNN_Reform_Bureaucracy_desc: "Les administrations occidentales ont fait un bond en avant par rapport à leurs homologues chinoises. Nous devons nous tourner vers l'Occident et adopter un système moderne de départements et de domaines de responsabilité bureaucratique subdivisés."

 HNN_National_Consciousness: "Conscience nationale"
 HNN_National_Consciousness_desc: "Des orateurs devraient être envoyés dans les campagnes pour enseigner à la population une véritable conscience nationale, une prise de conscience de la place du Hunan dans l'ensemble mythique chinois, et la nécessité de se battre pour la Chine qui sera un jour."

 HNN_Reconcile: "Nouveaux amis"

 HNN_overcome_tang: "Vaincre Tang Shengzhi"
 HNN_overcome_tang_desc: "Tang Shengzhi a nominalement juré fidélité à notre gouvernement, mais continue de rechercher le pouvoir pour lui-même. Nous devons faire un effort concerté pour courtiser les partisans de Tang et limiter son influence sans l'aliéner totalement."

 HNN_Religious_Unity: "Par le service, l'harmonie"
 HNN_Religious_Unity_desc: "Les régiments mixtes en temps de crise étaient une grande aubaine pour l'armée Xiang. Notre appareil de parti en expansion est de plus en plus fractionné, et pour combattre cela, nous devrions nous inspirer du modèle Xiang. Tous les membres du parti, quel que soit leur niveau, doivent être amenés à travailler régulièrement de leurs mains pour embellir leurs municipalités. Grâce à ces Corps de Beauté mixtes, nous aurons l'harmonie."

 HNN_Education_Reform: "Réforme de l'Éducation"
 HNN_Education_Reform_desc: "Les membres du gouvernement de Zhao Hengti ont fait des promesses ambitieuses envers l'Academie. Nous ne pouvons pas permettre à cette influence insidieuse de saper notre règne. Nous devons instituer une vaste réforme de l'éducation et investir massivement dans le secteur pour combattre l'influence de ses acolytes."

 HNN_Rural_Literacy: "Alphabétisation rurale"
 HNN_Rural_Literacy_desc: "Nombreux sont ceux qui, dans les campagnes, ne savent ni lire ni écrire, et encore moins parler avec éloquence. Le développement de ces compétences de base doit bénéficier d'un financement important de l'État."

 HNN_Enforce_Democracy: "Appliquer la démocratie"
 HNN_Enforce_Democracy_desc: "La démocratie doit également imprégner le lieu de travail. Nous inscrirons dans la loi que les travailleurs de chaque atelier et de chaque usine doivent élire leurs propres surveillants et directeurs. Cela permettra d'augmenter la participation à d'autres types d'élections et de familiariser la population avec la démocratie."

 HNN_The_Effects_of_Black_Monday: "L'Économie Provinciale"

 HNN_Attract_Foreign_Investment: "Attirer les capitalistes de Guangdong"
 HNN_Attract_Foreign_Investment_desc: "Le Hunan est riche en ressources et en main-d'œuvre, mais manque cruellement d'investissements. Avec l'éclatement de la Ligue des Huit Provinces, nous disposons d'une plus grande autonomie pour stimuler notre développement économique. Il est temps de transformer notre lien politique avec Guangdong en gains économiques."

 HNN_Reform_the_Status_Quo: "Sauver l'industrie textile"

 HNN_Urbanization: "Améliorer les infrastructures urbaines"
 HNN_Urbanization_desc: "L'État doit permettre à la population de prospérer. Pour soutenir les nouvelles usines qui ont vu le jour dans les villes ces derniers temps, nous devons veiller à ce que toutes les zones commerciales aient un accès complet aux services publics."

 HNN_The_Arsenals_of_the_South_desc: "Hu Shuhua, métallurgiste au service du gouvernement provincial, a présenté un rapport détaillé sur le grand potentiel du Hunan en matière de développement de l'industrie lourde. Bien qu'il nécessite un investissement important, le développement des industries minières et métallurgiques pourrait avoir un taux de rendement élevé à long terme. À terme, ce plan ambitieux nous permettra de construire une puissance industrielle dans le sud de la Chine."

 HNN_Subsidies_to_Military_Industry: "Zone Industrielle de Zhuzhou"
 HNN_Subsidies_to_Military_Industry_desc: "Zhuzhou, ville située le long de la rivière Xiang et de la voie ferrée Guangzhou-Wuchang, a été choisie comme site d'un plan de développement ambitieux, grâce à son potentiel industriel. La création de la zone industrielle de Zhuzhou ne manquera pas de stimuler nos industries métallurgiques et chimiques."

 HNN_Exploit_Hunan_Machinery_Factory: "Usine sidérurgique de Xiangtan"
 HNN_Exploit_Hunan_Machinery_Factory_desc: "La sidérurgie est l'épine dorsale de l'industrie nationale. Le Hunan est à l'abri des invasions étrangères et riche en fer et en charbon. Nous devrions mettre en place une initiative pour développer l'industrie sidérurgique dans le Hunan, dans la ville de Xiangtan."

 HNN_develop_xiangtan_steel_decision: "Usine sidérurgique de Xiangtan"

 HNN_Factories_in_the_Countryside: "Soutenir l'artisanat local"
 HNN_Factories_in_the_Countryside_desc: "Comme le disent les Américains, nous ne pouvons pas mettre tous nos œufs dans le même panier. Si nos villes sont détruites, nous devons être en mesure d'approvisionner nos hommes. Les petites villes et les industries artisanales pourraient remplir ce rôle si l'État leur accordait un financement suffisant."

 HNN_Renovate_Yuelu_Academy: "Moderniser l'académie de Yuelu"
 HNN_Renovate_Yuelu_Academy_desc: "L'académie de Yuelu a une histoire prestigieuse qui remonte à 976, sous la dynastie des Song. Malgré un effort de réforme superficiel sous certains des seigneurs de la guerre plus avant-gardistes qui ont occupé le Hunan au fil des ans, l'ancien nom et l'héritage continuent de résister aux tentatives de mise en place d'un programme d'études plus moderne. Nous devons la refonder sous le nom d'université du Hunan et améliorer notre capacité de progrès scientifique."

 HNN_Regional_Incorporation: "Intégration Industrielle"
 HNN_Regional_Incorporation_desc: "Notre destin étant lié à un autre pays, plus industrialisé que le nôtre, nous devrions resserrer nos liens économiques et demander une assistance économique."

 HNN_Religious_Mobilization: "Mobilisation religieuse"

Nous devrions encourager ces patriotes en robe de moine à vanter les vertus de nos forces. Gu Jingyuan, un moine prestigieux et le descendant du patriote Ming Gu Yanwu, a généreusement proposé son aide."

 HNN_Promote_Innovations: "Une armée d'égaux"
 HNN_Promote_Innovations_desc: "Une armée bouddhiste est une armée d'égaux.

 HNN_Not_One_Step_Back: "Ni mort, ni peur"
 HNN_Not_One_Step_Back_desc: "Les bouddhistes savent que la vie et la mort sont éphémères, et qu'il ne faut pas craindre de se sacrifier pour le bien de tous. Tan Sitong, un martyr de la fin de l'ère Qing originaire du Hunan et également étudiant du bouddhisme, a montré l'exemple. Avec le soutien des moines, nous pouvons endoctriner nos soldats en profondeur. L'idéologie est plus puissante que les fusils pour armer une force militaire en Chine. Nos soldats doivent être capables de sacrifier leur vie pour servir et sauver le Hunan et le pays."

 HNN_New_Officers: "Officiers de proximité"
 HNN_New_Officers_desc: "À mesure que nous éliminons les factions au sein de l'armée et que nos forces armées se développent, nous avons besoin d'une nouvelle génération d'officiers subalternes. Le général Peng Dehuai nous a déjà montré qu'un paysan pauvre peut aussi être un excellent officier. Nous devons mener une campagne concertée de recrutement et de formation parmi les officiers issus des classes inférieures."

 HNN_New_Baoding: "New Baoding doctrine"
 HNN_New_Baoding_desc: "À mesure que nos forces armées se développent, une nouvelle génération d'officiers subalternes est nécessaire.

 HNN_A_Buddhist_Army: "Une Armée Nationale"
 HNN_A_Buddhist_Army_desc: "Tout pays a besoin d'une armée et la nôtre est terriblement dépassée. Nous devons créer les bases d'une force véritablement moderne qui soit à la fois disposée à aider les gens dans leurs moments de détresse et capable de défendre leur province. Nous allons entamer la réforme de l'armée."

 HNN_Military_Modernization: "Supprimer le Système de Zone de Défense"
 HNN_Military_Modernization_desc: "L'ancien système de division de la province en zones de défense s'est avéré perpétuer le phénomène des seigneurs de la guerre. Nous devons restructurer notre organisation militaire et notre logistique et centraliser le commandement militaire."

 HNN_Standardized_Equipment: "Équipement standardisé"
 HNN_Standardized_Equipment_desc: "Nous utilisons un certain nombre de fusils de différents calibres. Cela met à rude épreuve les systèmes logistiques et augmente le nombre de victimes accidentelles. Nous devons standardiser nos armes autour d'un seul calibre."

 HNN_New_Communications_Technology: "Nouvelles technologies de communication"
 HNN_New_Communications_Technology_desc: "Les progrès de l'électronique permettent d'accélérer considérablement les communications et la signalisation, qui sont essentielles au succès sur le champ de bataille, en particulier pour une grande force décentralisée comme celle que nous nous efforçons de constituer. Pour l'adoption rapide de ces technologies critiques, aucune dépense ne doit être épargnée."

 HNN_Support_on_the_Front_Lines: "Soutien sur les lignes de front"
 HNN_Support_on_the_Front_Lines_desc: "Non seulement l'artillerie a fondamentalement modifié la guerre, mais la propagation de l'artillerie est notre devoir en tant que terre vertueuse ; que nul ne tombe sans au moins un effort de soutien de la part de ses camarades de foi et d'armes. Si nous voulons être victorieux, nous devons améliorer notre arsenal."

 HNN_Increase_Motorisation: "Accroître la motorisation"
 HNN_Increase_Motorisation_desc: "Notre armée peut posséder le matériel, la discipline et l'esprit combatif qui distinguent une force moderne - mais tout cela ne sert à rien si ce matériel ne peut pas atteindre la ligne de front, ou si nos braves hommes sont abattus parce qu'ils sont pratiquement immobiles face à nos ennemis plus agiles. La tradition guerrière du Sud, renforcée par la technologie moderne, nous rendra invincibles en campagne !"

 HNN_Modern_Planning: "Planification Moderne"
 HNN_Modern_Planning_desc: "Profitons pleinement de nos nouvelles fortifications ! La doctrine standard de notre armée doit être améliorée."

 HNN_Elite_Troops: "Nouveau modèle de troupes"
 HNN_Elite_Troops_desc: "Les plus grandes armées, de César à Napoléon, ont possédé une avant-garde d'élite pour inspirer le moral et mettre en œuvre des manœuvres difficiles.

Le Hunan se retrouve assiégé et l'Alliance nationale de protection nomme Tang Shengzhi, le général bouddhiste, gouverneur de la province. Il met en œuvre son programme de bouddhisation, mais il est repoussé quelques années plus tard et remplacé par le gouverneur fédéraliste Zhao Hengti. Après la victoire des Zhili sur le Kuomintang lors de l'expédition du Nord, le Hunan est incorporé dans la Ligue des huit provinces, Zhao Hengti déclarant que son allégeance personnelle va à Sun Chuanfang à Nanjing."

Tang Shengming, le frère de Tang Shengzhi, tente de ramener son frère au Hunan et au pouvoir. Cheng Qian, partisan du KMT et commandant de la NRA, cherche également à prendre le contrôle de la province.\n\nAu sud, la clique de Liangguang est dirigée par Chen Jiongming. Même si Zhao Hengti se dit fédéraliste, Chen le montre. À l'ouest, les cliques du Sichuan et du Yunnan nous observent avec des regards affamés. Au nord, les amis du Hunan, les Zhili du nord, mais leur pouvoir n'est pas éternel."
 hnn.1.a: "Il est temps d'agir."

#Choosing Path Events

 hnn.2.t: "Restauration de la Constitution de la province du Hunan"
 hnn.2.d: "Zhao Hengti, le gouverneur, est obsédé par les procédures légales, même si elles sont truquées. C'est pourquoi il a suggéré que la province rétablisse l'ancienne constitution provinciale promulguée dans les années 1920. L'avenir de la province dépend de sa décision."
 hnn.2.a: "Restaurez la Constitution !"
 hnn.2.b: "Pfft, qui a même besoin de procédures légales ?"

 hnn.3.t: "La Constitution restaurée"
 hnn.3.d: "Nous avons décidé de restaurer la constitution. Nous sommes maintenant, de nom et en quelque sorte de gouvernement, une démocratie. Nous garderons notre terre libre et sûre, et tous nos citoyens connaîtront la liberté du Hunan."
 hnn.3.a: "Trois hourras pour le Hunan !"

 hnn.4.t: "La Constitution rejetée"
 hnn.4.d: "Nous avons décidé de rejeter la restauration de la constitution. Nous sommes une province, pas une république. Nous n'avons pas besoin de le faire, de répéter les erreurs de notre passé qui nous ont conduits à faire partie de la Ligue. Le gouverneur Zhao a déchiré la Constitution de ses mains et l'a laissée brûler. C'est décidé - le Hunan ne sera plus démocratique."
 hnn.4.a: "Trois hourras pour le Hunan !"

 hnn.5.t: "Annonce des élections"
 hnn.5.d: "Avec la restauration de la Constitution de la province du Hunan, le gouverneur Zhao Hengti a décidé d'annoncer les nouvelles élections provinciales du Hunan. Les candidats devront s'annoncer pour se présenter et le peuple pourra choisir entre eux, en fonction de la manière dont il souhaite que le Hunan soit géré et sous quel type de gouvernance. Tous les Hunanais peuvent se présenter, mais peu d'entre eux sont réellement intéressés par la politique. Nombreux sont ceux qui soupçonnent Zhao Hengti de vouloir jouer des tours à l'occasion des élections..."
 hnn.5.a: "Une victoire pour le constitutionnalisme !"

 hnn.6.t: "Tang Shengzhi retourne dans le Hunan"
 hnn.6.d: "Le général bouddhiste, Tang Shengzhi, ancien gouverneur du Hunan, est revenu dans la province aujourd'hui. Après avoir entendu parler de la restauration de la constitution, le général bouddhiste a décidé de faire ses valises et de quitter Hong Kong pour revenir dans le Hunan. Avec l'aide de son frère, le général Tang Shengming, Tang Shengzhi est temporairement hébergé dans une auberge de Changsha. Il n'a encore rien fait, mais beaucoup pensent que l'ancien gouverneur est revenu pour se présenter au poste de gouverneur. En effet, il est assez populaire au sein de l'armée et de la population pour son "socialisme révolutionnaire" et ses politiques de bouddhisation, et s'il devait se présenter, il représenterait une menace pour le règne de Zhao Hengti."
 hnn.6.a: "Que pourrait-il avoir l'intention de faire ?"

 hnn.7.t: "Cheng Qian part pour Hunan"
 hnn.7.d: "Le général Cheng Qian, originaire du Hunan, a exprimé le désir de participer aux élections générales annoncées récemment dans ce pays. Il a reçu le feu vert pour son projet et est maintenant parti pour le Hunan."
 hnn.7.a: "Espérons qu'il trouvera le succès."

 hnn.8.t: "Cheng Qian retourne dans le Hunan"
 hnn.8.d_1: "Alors que la révolte nationaliste de Longyang a été écrasée, Cheng Qian, un vieil agitateur du KMT de notre province, a réussi à s'en sortir indemne. Il est maintenant retourné dans le Hunan et a annoncé sa candidature aux élections provinciales. Bien qu'il ne dispose pas actuellement d'une large base de soutien, les circonstances pourraient lui permettre de s'en constituer une, en particulier parmi les pauvres des villes."
 hnn.8.d_2: "Cheng Qian, un vieil agitateur du KMT de notre province, est retourné dans le Hunan et a annoncé sa candidature aux élections provinciales. Bien qu'il ne dispose pas actuellement d'une large base de soutien, les circonstances pourraient lui permettre d'en construire une, en particulier parmi les pauvres des villes."
 hnn.8.a: "Il ne gagnera pas."

 hnn.9.t: "Zhao Hengti à Hengyang"
 hnn.9.d: "Il y a deux jours, le gouverneur Zhao Hengti est retourné dans sa ville natale de Hengyang, dans l'espoir de convaincre les habitants de sa ville de voter pour lui. Il a rendu visite à sa famille ainsi qu'à de vieux amis d'enfance, et a prononcé de multiples discours dans la ville, attirant l'attention de nombreuses personnes. Cependant, ses compatriotes lui sont indifférents, et lorsque le gouverneur dérape pendant son discours, la réaction à sa présence est ouvertement hostile. Il est hué et insulté. Il semble que la population de Hengyang se soit tournée vers les candidats alternatifs..."
 hnn.9.a: "Les gens sont attirés par la rhétorique bouddhiste de Tang !"
 hnn.9.b: "Cheng gagne le peuple à la cause nationaliste !"

 hnn.10.t: "Zhao Regroups"
 hnn.10.d: "Après avoir été embroché dans sa ville natale, Zhao Hengti a pris quelques jours de congé de campagne pour établir une nouvelle stratégie avec ses conseillers."
 hnn.10.a: "Espérons qu'il trouve son équilibre."

 hnn.11.t: "Campagne à Yiyang"
 hnn.11.d: "Cheng Qian a trouvé un soutien dans la ville de Yiyang et dans la région environnante. Dans un discours enthousiaste, il a souligné ses origines modestes et son désir de voir le Hunan se tenir sur ses deux pieds, potentiellement séparé même du KMT à Longyang. Zhao Hengti et Tang Shengzhi ont tenté de répondre à cette vague de soutien à Cheng dans la région. Qui sera finalement le candidat favori de la ville ?"
 hnn.11.a: "La plateforme fédéraliste de Zhao remporte la victoire !"
 hnn.11.b: "Les politiques bouddhistes de Tang bénéficient d'un soutien populaire !"
 hnn.11.c: "La ville bascule résolument vers Cheng !"

 hnn.12.t: "Bataille électorale pour Changde"
 hnn.12.d: "Tang Shengzhi a choisi de commencer sa campagne à Changde, et a fait des progrès constants dans cette ville importante. Récemment, cependant, une controverse a éclaté dans la ville à propos des actions de Tang pendant le mouvement de protection de la Constitution. Si les flammes de cette controverse venaient à s'éventer, Tang pourrait perdre la ville."
 hnn.12.a: "Zhao retourne la population contre Tang !"
 hnn.12.b: "Tang s'accroche !"
 hnn.12.c: "La visite de Cheng attise les flammes."

 hnn.13.t: "Vers la campagne"
 hnn.13.d: "Grâce aux efforts du frère de Tang Shengzhi, Tang Shengming, Tang Shengzhi a redoublé de soutien dans les campagnes, en particulier dans les campagnes très peuplées autour de Changsha. Ne voulant pas céder la paysannerie, qui représente la grande majorité de la population mais qui n'est pas particulièrement politisée, Zhao Hengti et Cheng Qian sont également descendus à la campagne pour faire campagne. Qui trouve le plus grand soutien ?"
 hnn.13.a: "Les paysans se rallient fermement à Zhao !"
 hnn.13.b: "Tang s'assure le soutien de la campagne !"
 hnn.13.c: "Cheng l'emporte haut la main !"

 hnn.14.t: "Incident de Shaoshan"
 hnn.14.d: "Furieux de la politique foncière menée par Tang Shengzhi pendant son mandat et de l'apathie de Zhao Hengti, un groupe d'intermédiaires du petit village de Shaoshan a déclenché un tollé qui se répercute maintenant dans toute la campagne. Ils exigent que, quoi qu'il arrive, le gouvernement provincial reconnaisse la longue pratique immorale consistant à amener au marché les céréales et les cultures commerciales produites par les grands domaines.  L'impact de ces intermédiaires est d'autant plus important que nombre d'entre eux dirigent également de grandes exploitations agricoles où travaillent des ouvriers salariés."
 hnn.14.a: "Les plaidoyers passionnés de Zhao font basculer la paysannerie de son côté !"
 hnn.14.b: "Tang Shengzhi accepte de les intégrer dans ses politiques de réforme agraire."
 hnn.14.c: "L'incident déclenche une vague de ferveur pro-nationaliste !"

 hnn.15.t: "Les bidonvilles de Changsha"
 hnn.15.d: "Changsha s'est beaucoup développée ces dernières années, sous l'impulsion des changements économiques et des débuts de l'industrialisation, d'autant que de nombreux paysans ont cherché à se protéger des campagnes qui ont ravagé leurs billots. Les bidonvilles à la périphérie de la ville sont devenus importants et, bien qu'ils soient considérés comme un fléau, leurs habitants doivent au moins être pris en charge si l'on veut maintenir l'illusion du suffrage universel masculin. Qui est le plus à même de les séduire ?"
 hnn.15.a: "Zhao retrouve le soutien des habitants du bidonville !"
 hnn.15.b: "Le populisme de Tang séduit les habitants !"
 hnn.15.c: "Les habitants soutiennent Cheng !"

#hnn.16 removed

 hnn.17.t: "Le vote commence"
 hnn.17.d: "Il est temps pour les habitants du Hunan de voter pour savoir qui, selon eux, devrait diriger la province. Les gens de tout le Hunan se rassemblent maintenant dans les isoloirs pour déposer leur voix dans le scrutin, et le Hunan verra le rêve démocratique de Zhao Hengti se réaliser."
 hnn.17.a: "Un nouveau chapitre de notre histoire commence..."

#hnn.18 removed

 hnn.19.t: "Le Gouverneur"
 hnn.19.d: "Les événements ont pris une tournure choquante : Zhao Hengti a dépouillé la province de Hunan de la plupart de ses procédures légales. Il a rebondi sur ses promesses d'élections au poste de gouverneur. Les cris du peuple n'ont pas été entendus, et Zhao promet la prospérité et un nouveau Hunan."
 hnn.19.a: "Vive le gouverneur !"

 hnn.20.t: "Manifestations à Changsha"
 hnn.20.d: "Dans les rues de Changsha, le ciel est obscurci par la brume, on peut à peine voir au-delà des montagnes et des mers de personnes qui manifestent. On pouvait à peine entendre à travers le bruit qu'ils faisaient. Il était clair que les gens n'étaient pas favorables aux nouvelles politiques du gouverneur et qu'ils réclamaient le retour de la démocratie dans la province.\n\nZhao Hengti, cependant, est resté calme, se prélassant dans son fauteuil de bureau toute la journée, envoyant de plus en plus de gardes pour réprimer les manifestants."
 hnn.20.a: "C'est ainsi que meurt la démocratie..."

 hnn.21.t: "Wu Peifu nous soutient"
 hnn.21.d: "Dans le Nord, le maréchal Wu Peifu nous a envoyé une lettre, promettant de nous aider dans notre cause et d'aider Zhao Hengti. La frontière entre le Hunan et le Hubei étant de plus en plus militarisée, il semble que Wu Peifu ripostera par la force aux manifestations anti-Zhao Hengti si elles deviennent incontrôlables."
 hnn.21.a: "Dans les moments difficiles, nous avons besoin d'une main secourable."

 hnn.22.t: "Le général bouddhiste est de retour"
 hnn.22.d: "Au milieu des tensions croissantes entre le peuple et le gouverneur, le général Tang Shengming a réussi à ramener son frère du Guizhou, où il se cachait dans un petit village de montagne. Tang Shengzhi, le général bouddhiste, est entré à Changsha aujourd'hui, son visage étant immédiatement reconnaissable par les citoyens locaux grâce à sa propagande de bouddhisation lorsqu'il était gouverneur. Du jour au lendemain, il est devenu un sujet de débat brûlant, les dîners familiaux étant interrompus par la politique provinciale.\n\nIl séjourne actuellement dans la résidence de son frère à Changsha, et des rumeurs ont circulé sur un éventuel complot visant à le rétablir au pouvoir."
 hnn.22.a: "Quels sont les plans qu'il a en tête ?"

 hnn.23.t: "Tang Shengzhi s'exprime"
 hnn.23.d: "Le général Tang Shengzhi, récemment rentré au pays, s'est prononcé contre la révocation de la Constitution provinciale, qu'il a qualifiée d'antidémocratique et de trahison de la province et de son peuple. Avec son frère, Tang Shengming, Tang Shengzhi s'est montré très véhément envers Zhao Hengti et ses actions. On soupçonne même le général d'avoir envoyé des espions pour saboter les actes du gouverneur."
 hnn.23.a: "Il n'est rien d'autre que des ennuis..."

 hnn.24.t: "Tentative d'assassinat sur le gouverneur !"
 hnn.24.d: "En entrant dans la pièce, le pistolet dans la poche, l'assassin savait qu'il avait deux options : réussir ou échouer. Ses camarades lui auraient dit qu'il pouvait reculer et se détourner à tout moment, qu'il avait encore une longue vie à vivre. Mais la décision était déjà prise. Il n'y avait pas de retour en arrière possible.\n\nZhao Hengti doit mourir."
 hnn.24.a: "Il est temps !"

 hnn.25.t: "Assassinat raté de Zhao Hengti !"
 hnn.25.d: "Le corps de l'assassin a été brûlé ce matin. Personne ne savait qui il était et personne ne s'occupait de lui. Il est mort de quatre balles dans la poitrine, le sang a séché depuis longtemps. Le gouverneur Zhao est monté à la tribune pour prononcer un discours aujourd'hui. L'assassin a scandaleusement tenté d'attenter à la vie de Zhao, mais il a vaillamment combattu l'assassin et l'a tué. Il a exposé le corps de l'assassin comme une menace pour tous ceux qui osent s'opposer à lui."
 hnn.25.a: "Comment quelqu'un a pu faire ça à notre gouverneur ? Comment quelqu'un a pu faire ça à notre gouverneur ?"

 hnn.26.t: "L'armée se rallie à Tang Shengzhi"
 hnn.26.d: "Figure très populaire dans l'armée, le général bouddhiste Tang Shengzhi s'est attiré beaucoup de soutien parmi les divisions du Hunan, incitant de nombreux généraux et caporaux à se ranger de son côté. Il semble qu'une résistance militaire se développe, qui pourrait menacer le règne de Zhao Hengti sur le Hunan."
 hnn.26.a: "Très inquiétant."

 hnn.27.t: "Les protestations pro-constitutionnelles s'intensifient."
 hnn.27.d: "Les manifestations se multiplient dans la province ces derniers temps, la population locale étant très mécontente de voir la constitution déchirée et révoquée. Aujourd'hui encore, une grande manifestation s'est déroulée devant le bâtiment du Conseil provincial du Hunan, et une autre a eu lieu à Hengyang il y a quelques jours. Au fil du temps, ces manifestations sont devenues beaucoup plus importantes et bruyantes, rassemblant chaque jour de nombreuses personnes. Certains ont même rapporté avoir vu des bannières Pro-Tang Shengzhi utilisées dans les manifestations."
 hnn.27.a: "Sont-ils vraiment si en colère pour un papier inutile ?"

 hnn.28.t: "Des émeutes éclatent"
 hnn.28.d: "Une émeute s'est produite aujourd'hui à Changsha. Il s'agissait au départ d'une manifestation normale, mais une prise de bec entre un constitutionnaliste et un membre du conseil provincial ayant dégénéré, une véritable émeute a éclaté, les gens levant et baissant les mains à plusieurs reprises. L'armée locale a été envoyée sur place, réussissant à repousser les émeutiers dans les rues et à mettre temporairement fin au chaos."
 hnn.28.a: "Bon sang, on doit garder le contrôle !"

 hnn.29.t: "Violence dans la Rue"
 hnn.29.d: "Changde et Changsha ont été frappées par une nouvelle vague de protestations cette semaine, dont l'une s'est terminée dans le sang. Un garde a ouvert le feu sur les manifestants à Changde, provoquant une explosion de la foule et une bataille presque totale entre les émeutiers et les gardes, qui a fait des victimes des deux côtés. Au cours de la semaine écoulée, les manifestations sont devenues de plus en plus violentes, entraînant des blessures graves et même des décès dans certains cas. Chaque jour qui passe, il devient plus difficile de rétablir l'ordre dans la province et d'empêcher les gens de protester."

 hnn.30.t: "Les militaires se révoltent !"
 hnn.30.d: "Ce matin, sous la bannière du Général Bouddhiste, une grande partie de notre armée a déclaré la révolte ! Ils ont établi leur capitale provisoire à Changde, et les forces loyales à Zhao Hengti commencent à affluer vers les lignes de front. Des batailles majeures sont annoncées pour bientôt, et la province est plongée dans le chaos."
 hnn.30.a: "Ce n'est pas bon..."

 hnn.31.t: "La bataille de Fenghuang"
 hnn.31.d: "La ville de Fenghuang, près de la frontière orientale du Guizhou, est le théâtre d'une bataille entre les deux camps. La milice de Zhao Hengti est entrée dans la ville en tirant des coups de feu, tandis que les soldats fidèles à Tang Shengzhi se défendent vaillamment."
 hnn.31.a: "La défense de Tang Shengzhi réussit !"
 hnn.31.b: "Zhao Hengti prend le contrôle de la ville !"

 hnn.32.t: "La bataille de Changsha"
 hnn.32.d: "Après la victoire des rebelles à Fenghuang, ils ont avancé pour tenter de prendre Changsha, la base de Zhao Hengti. La ville est en proie au chaos depuis plusieurs jours, les rebelles s'ébattant dans les rues, se rapprochant de plus en plus de la maison du gouverneur provincial. L'air est tendu, et le sol est taché de sang. Si les rebelles gagnent, cela pourrait signifier la fin du gouvernorat de Zhao Hengti."
 hnn.32.a: "Les Rebelles gagnent !"
 hnn.32.b: "Les Loyalistes poussent les Rebelles dehors !"

 hnn.33.t: "La bataille de Changde"
 hnn.33.d: "Après la victoire à la Pyrrhus de Zhao Hengti à Fenghuang, il a de nouveau rassemblé sa confiance et ses troupes, cette fois pour frapper le cœur de la rébellion - Changde. Une série d'escarmouches et de batailles ont déjà eu lieu, et le son de l'artillerie remplit l'air. Les rebelles pourraient bien être vaincus aujourd'hui."
 hnn.33.a: "Tang défend la ville !"
 hnn.33.b: "Zhao arrive !"

 hnn.34.t: "La bataille de Hengyang"
 hnn.34.d: "Après une série de batailles serrées et une tentative infructueuse de prendre la capitale d'un camp, la révolte est dans sa dernière phase. Les deux camps ont finalement réuni toutes leurs forces dans la ville de Hengyang, lieu de naissance de Zhao Hengti. Avec leurs divisions rassemblées, cela pourrait bien être le champ de bataille final de la révolte. Cette bataille décidera du destin du Hunan, et celui qui gagnera sera celui qui dirigera le Hunan."
 hnn.34.a: "Une victoire pour Tang Shengzhi !"
 hnn.34.b: "Zhao Hengti détruit les rebelles !"

 hnn.36.t: "La bataille de Yiyang"
 hnn.36.d: "Jonction importante entre les deux villes de Changsha et Changde, bases respectives de Zhao Hengti et Tang Shengzhi, Yiyang a été attaquée par les rebelles. Tang Shengzhi et quelques divisions ont assiégé la ville et bombardent actuellement les défenses loyalistes. Zhao Hengti, apprenant ces nouvelles, a rapidement ordonné à ses généraux d'envoyer une force de secours. Cependant, il est à craindre que cette force n'arrive pas à temps et que Tang Shengzhi s'empare de la ville, ce qui le rapprocherait de Changsha."
 hnn.36.a: "Tang brise les défenses !"
 hnn.36.b: "Les renforts arrivent !"

 hnn.37.t: "La bataille de Shaoyang"
 hnn.37.d: "Shaoyang, une ville au milieu du Hunan, a été attaquée par les forces du général bouddhiste. Depuis Shaoyang, Tang pourrait étendre son pouvoir jusqu'à la ville de Hengyang et s'emparer du sud du Hunan, coupant nos liens avec Liangguang et nous coinçant au nord. Il pourrait également prendre le contrôle de routes importantes menant à des villes importantes comme Changsha. Il est impératif que Zhao Hengti garde la ville s'il souhaite survivre."
 hnn.37.a: "Tang met les loyalistes dehors !"
 hnn.37.b: "Zhao route les rebelles !"

 hnn.38.t: "Une attaque à Huaihua"
 hnn.38.d: "Huaihua, une ville de l'ouest du Hunan, est actuellement sous le contrôle du général bouddhiste Tang Shengzhi. Une force a été envoyée par le gouverneur pour potentiellement briser le front et capturer la ville de Huaihua, qui pourrait être utilisée comme point de départ pour une attaque sur Changde et le Nord et couper les forces du général bouddhiste dans le Sud. La ville est bien défendue, et la bataille est serrée. Qui va gagner ?"
 hnn.38.a: "L'attaque échoue !"
 hnn.38.b: "L'attaque réussit !"

 hnn.39.t: "De l'autre côté du lac Dongting"
 hnn.39.d: "Le lac Dongting est un grand lac situé au nord du Hunan, qui lui a donné son nom : "hú" signifie lac, en référence au lac Dongting, et "nán" signifie sud - le Hunan signifie donc "au sud du lac (Dongting)". Si nous parvenons à le traverser, cela nous donnera un avantage tactique considérable sur les rebelles et nous rapprochera de Changde. Des bateaux doivent être construits et envoyés sur le lac pour contester la domination actuelle de Tang Shengzhi. L'objectif est de sécuriser les villages côtiers et de tenir bon."
 hnn.39.a: "Nous allons capturer ce lac !"

 hnn.40.t: "Remonter la rivière Yuanjiang"
 hnn.40.d: "Le Yuanjiang est une rivière qui coule du lac Dongting et traverse Changde. Maintenant que nous avons une domination suffisante sur le lac, nous devons remonter le fleuve. Nos hommes ont été embarqués sur des bateaux avec l'objectif de faire des raids sur les colonies riveraines et avec l'objectif final de créer le chaos à Changde et de retourner à Changsha."
 hnn.40.a: "Bonne chance"

 hnn.41.t: "Un raid sur Changde"
 hnn.41.d: "Succès ! Nos hommes ont remonté la rivière et attaqué Changde, emportant avec eux de précieux documents, des renseignements et de l'argent. Beaucoup de bons hommes ont été perdus, mais ceux qui se sont échappés nous ont apporté un avantage inestimable."
 hnn.41.a: "Un grand succès!"

 hnn.42.t: "Échec du Raid"
 hnn.42.d: "Les hommes de Ou ont été capturés et abattus par les forces du général bouddhiste à Changde. Il semble qu'ils s'attendaient à une attaque en amont de la rivière, et ils ont tendu un piège, encerclant nos soldats et les forçant à se rendre."
 hnn.42.a: "Vous étiez les élus !"

 hnn.43.t: "Un complot suspecté"
 hnn.43.d: "Des officiers militaires ont été entendus au cours de leurs conversations aujourd'hui, parlant d'un complot visant à potentiellement renverser le gouverneur. Lorsque la nouvelle est arrivée au bureau du gouverneur, celui-ci s'est contenté de hocher la tête et de dire qu'il s'attendait à ce qu'une telle chose se produise. Le gouvernement provincial a été informé qu'il ne fallait pas s'inquiéter, bien que l'on craigne que le gouverneur ait sous-estimé la menace..."
 hnn.43.a: "Ça va aller... Pas vrai ?"

 hnn.44.t: "Tang Shengzhi dénonce Zhao Hengti"
 hnn.44.d: "Le général bouddhiste s'est une nouvelle fois exprimé, avec une colère bien plus féroce contre le gouverneur. Il est monté sur un balcon à Changde, sous le regard de milliers de personnes, pour énumérer les nombreuses choses dont il accuse le gouvernement provincial actuel. Il a été vu flanqué de son frère, Tang Shengming, parmi d'autres membres de l'armée. De nombreuses inquiétudes ont été exprimées quant aux liens entre le général et le complot contre Zhao Hengti."
 hnn.44.a: "Le bâtard absolu..."

#Tang Victory Events

 hnn.45.t: "Tang Shengzhi remporte l'élection"
 hnn.45.d: "Tang Shengzhi, le général bouddhiste, a remporté les élections provinciales et est devenu le gouverneur du Hunan, le chef d'État de facto."
 hnn.45.a: "Victoire !"

 HNN_zhao_flees: "§HZhao Hengti§! devient un général"

 hnn.46.t: "Tang Shengzhi prend le contrôle de Hunan"
 hnn.46.d: "Tang Shengzhi a, une fois de plus, établi un contrôle total sur la province de Hunan. Plus tôt dans la journée, Tang Shengzhi et ses hommes sont entrés dans la maison du gouverneur et l'ont évincé de son poste, installant Tang comme nouveau gouverneur. Zhao Hengti se serait enfui de l'autre côté de la frontière provinciale, dans le Hubei, une province contrôlée par le Zhili du Nord. Tang Shengzhi a commencé à répandre le "socialisme bouddhiste", et le Hunan connaîtra une nouvelle ère, meilleure ou pire, sous la direction de Tang Shengzhi. Pour l'instant, nous devons voir ce qu'il fait."
 hnn.46.a: "Le Gouverneur est parti, vive le nouveau Gouverneur !"

 hnn.47.t: "Le bouddhisme révolutionnaire de Tang Shengzhi"
 hnn.47.d: "Le nouveau gouverneur, Tang Shengzhi, a une fois de plus mis en avant sa nouvelle idéologie dans la société hunanaise. Baptisée "bouddhisme révolutionnaire", le gouverneur Tang cherche à combiner les meilleurs éléments de nombreuses idéologies. Il s'inspire des socialistes du Kuomintang et de leur message d'égalité, de l'Alliance de protection nationale et de son patriotisme, des idéologies de la Troisième Internationale et de son propre bouddhisme et de celui de ses camarades. Tang Shengzhi combine tous ces éléments pour créer sa nouvelle idéologie parfaite.\n\nMême si certains bouddhistes fervents et des gens de droite s'y opposent, beaucoup de gens au Hunan l'acceptent, car ils pensent que c'est la bonne voie à suivre pour la modernisation de la province. Pour que le Hunan puisse à nouveau monter sur la scène chinoise, il doit d'abord se révolutionner."
 hnn.47.a: "Pour le bouddhisme ! Pour la révolution !"

 hnn.48.t: "Le problème des propriétaires"
 hnn.48.d: "Il y a un problème assez litigieux dans le Hunan - le problème de ce qu'il faut faire avec nos propriétaires. Comme Tang Shengzhi est un socialiste, il doit savoir comment les traiter efficacement. Il y a trois façons de s'occuper d'eux : les tuer, les faire travailler dix fois plus dur qu'un paysan ordinaire, ou les libérer et leur dire de ne plus revenir. Que doit choisir le général ?"
 hnn.48.a: "Tuez-les !"
 hnn.48.b: "Faites-les travailler !"
 hnn.48.c: "Libérez-les !"

 hnn.49.t: "La question des femmes"
 hnn.49.d: "Les femmes constituent une grande partie de notre population. La plupart des femmes adultes du Hunan sont de simples fermières ou des femmes au foyer, et n'ont pas voix au chapitre. Cependant, des femmes influentes ont commencé à faire avancer leur programme, pour qu'elles travaillent davantage dans les usines des grandes villes et pour aider les femmes à améliorer leur statut. Elles demandent que les femmes soient égales aux hommes en termes de travail et de salaire, et que la discrimination à l'égard des femmes soit éliminée. Cependant, il y a eu beaucoup d'opposition de la part du conseil provincial et des hommes locaux, car ils ne veulent pas céder une grande partie de leur pouvoir aux femmes. Ils veulent conserver du mieux qu'ils peuvent leurs positions et leur supériorité sociale et économique masculine. Si nous promettons l'égalité, ce sera bon pour les femmes, mais c'est un moyen sûr de mettre en colère les hommes du Hunan. Comment réagir ?"
 hnn.49.a: "L'égalité sociale et économique, maintenant !"
 hnn.49.b: "Promettre d'élever le statut des femmes"
 hnn.49.c: "Retournez à la cuisine, imbéciles."

 hnn.50.t: "Fondation de l'Académie de Yaoxiang"
 hnn.50.d: "Aujourd'hui, près de son comté natal de Dong'an, Tang Shengzhi a annoncé qu'il allait ouvrir une nouvelle école secondaire, baptisée Yaoxiang Academy en l'honneur de son père. L'académie, qui devait initialement être une université, n'aura pas de conseil d'administration, et Tang Shengzhi sera le président de l'école, avec Gu Chou comme directeur. L'académie Yaoxiang, étant une école privée, vise à éduquer des adolescents relativement riches. L'académie n'a pas d'objectif spécifique et ouvrira ses portes l'année prochaine."
 hnn.50.a: "Un effort notable pour améliorer l'éducation !"

 hnn.51.t: "Protestations des monastères"
 hnn.51.d: "Certains monastères bouddhistes du Hunan ont exprimé leur indignation face au nouveau programme de bouddhisation de Tang Shengzhi, affirmant qu'il leur enlevait leur mode de vie et adaptait leur religion à un programme politique néfaste. Tang Shengzhi a répondu à ces moines en disant : "Le bouddhisme n'est rien sans le socialisme ou la politique. Si vous vous inquiétez de l'implication de la politique dans la religion, vous devriez regarder du côté des provinces occidentales"."
 hnn.51.a: "Ils n'ont probablement pas aimé cette réponse..."

 hnn.52.t: "Collecteurs de loyers militaires"
 hnn.52.d: "Il a été porté à l'attention du gouvernement provincial de Hunan que des propriétaires locaux ont engagé des membres de l'armée pour collecter les loyers et expulser leurs locataires en échange d'une partie de l'argent du loyer. Il va sans dire qu'il s'agit d'une grave transgression des idéaux du socialisme bouddhiste et, avec l'accord unanime du Conseil provincial, il faut demander aux militaires de se retirer et de cesser leur ingérence dans les affaires des propriétaires fonciers."
 hnn.52.a: "Ces ennuyeux propriétaires ne font rien de bon !"

 hnn.53.t: "Les collecteurs de loyers militaires se retirent"
 hnn.53.d: "Avec l'ordre donné par Changsha à tous les membres de l'armée qui s'occupaient de la collecte des loyers et de l'expulsion des locataires de cesser leurs actions, la plupart des militaires qui s'occupaient de la collecte des loyers ont arrêté. Ils ont été rétrogradés ou punis, et ceux qui ont refusé l'ordre ont été démis de leur grade et arrêtés."
 hnn.53.a: "Les gens feraient n'importe quoi pour un peu d'argent..."

 hnn.54.t: "Rapports sur la contrebande d'armes"
 hnn.54.d: "La voie ferrée nord-sud qui traverse le Hunan est largement utilisée pour le transport de marchandises, et notamment d'armes. Ces armes sont transportées illégalement vers et depuis le Guangxi, le Guangdong, les concessions étrangères et le gouvernement de Pékin. Il y a maintenant un débat animé au sein du Conseil provincial sur ce qu'il faut faire avec ces trafiquants d'armes illégaux. De nombreux membres ont déclaré qu'ils ne se souciaient pas de la situation, et certains exhortent le gouverneur Tang Shengzhi à agir immédiatement et à sévir contre les contrebandiers. En fin de compte, c'est à lui de choisir : que faire du commerce illégal d'armes ?"
 hnn.54.a: "En commençant par le prochain train de marchandises qui passe par là, nous devons sévir immédiatement !"
 hnn.54.b: "Laissez-les, tant qu'ils paient les frais de transport, tout ira bien."

 hnn.55.t: "L'incident du Xiangjiang"
 hnn.55.d: "Les rapports locaux de bateaux suspects sur le Xiangjiang n'ont jamais été un sujet d'importance pour la police. Cependant, après une grande fusillade à Changde, qui a fait une douzaine de morts et de nombreux blessés, impliquant ces bateaux, la police locale a commencé à enquêter davantage sur ces étranges barges. Beaucoup disent que les bateaux ne sont que des bateaux ordinaires, et que les participants à la fusillade devraient être appréhendés, mais certains affirment que la fusillade et les bateaux marqués sont des exemples de quelque chose de plus grand."
 hnn.55.a: "Je suis sûr que ce n'est rien - arrêtez ceux qui posent problème et nous en aurons fini avec ça."
 hnn.55.b: "Cela demande une enquête !"

 hnn.56.t: "Découverte d'un réseau massif de contrebande d'opium"
 hnn.56.d: "L'enquête sur les étranges bateaux marqués et la fusillade sur le fleuve Xiangjiang ont conduit à la découverte d'un vaste réseau de contrebande d'opium qui opère depuis des années sous le nez du gouvernement provincial. Bien que le gouvernement provincial ne se soucie guère de la consommation d'opium, le fait que ce réseau de contrebande ait continuellement échappé à l'impôt l'a amené à reconnaître qu'il devait être arrêté. Opérant dans le Hunan, le Sichuan et le Yunnan, ce réseau est connu pour fuir la loi et défier les autorités locales."
 hnn.56.a: "Il faut y mettre fin immédiatement !"

 hnn.57.t: "Rallye Yiguandao"
 hnn.57.d: "Un récent rassemblement rural de Yiguandao a attiré l'attention du public sur cette étrange religion. Avec un vieux "maître" qui organisait le rassemblement, les membres du Yiguandao ont essayé de répandre la parole du Yiguandao dans la campagne du Hunan. Le culte a été rejeté par de nombreux fermiers et paysans comme étant fou, mais beaucoup d'autres ont également commencé à devenir des adeptes dévoués. Le Yiguandao et ses effets possibles sur la province font aujourd'hui l'objet d'un vif débat, beaucoup citant le Yiguandao de Shandong, où il constitue peut-être l'une des forces les plus puissantes de la province."
 hnn.57.a: "Ce culte est étrange."

 hnn.58.t: "Découverte d'un réseau de contrebande d'opium dans le sud de la Chine"
 hnn.58.d: "Un réseau illégal de contrebande d'opium vient d'être découvert par le gouvernement provincial du Hunan. Ce réseau opérait sous le nez des gouverneurs du Hunan, du Sichuan, du Yunnan et des provinces orientales le long du Yangtze depuis de nombreuses années, échappant systématiquement aux taxes. Le gouverneur du Hunan, Tang Shengzhi, s'est employé la semaine dernière à détruire ce réseau de contrebande, ou du moins à lui faire payer des impôts. Quoi qu'il en soit, mettre fin à l'évasion fiscale de ce groupe nous aidera financièrement."
 hnn.58.a: "Bon travail, Tang !"

#Zhao Authoritarian Events

 hnn.59.t: "Zhao Hengti remporte l'élection grâce à la fraude."
 hnn.59.d: "L'élection était si profondément frauduleuse que les résultats ont été presque tous rejetés. Zhao Hengti a été réélu sur des bases fragiles. Tang Shengzhi et Cheng Qian peuvent protester, mais la durée de l'élection a donné à Zhao Hengti suffisamment de temps pour asseoir son pouvoir. Tang Shengzhi, de manière inquiétante, a fui la province avec certains de ses plus proches conseillers."
 hnn.59.a: "Victoire !"

 hnn.590.t: "Zhao Hengti réprime la rébellion"
 hnn.590.d: "Zhao Hengti et ses hommes sont entrés dans Changde, chassant Tang Shengzhi et les généraux qui lui étaient fidèles. La plupart d'entre eux, sinon tous, ont fui à bord d'un train vers le Sichuan voisin, où ils se tiendront à l'écart au milieu du chaos. La rébellion est terminée et Tang Shengzhi a fui la province. Le gouverneur a convoqué une grande fête ce soir, avec ses généraux loyalistes, pour célébrer la fin d'une rébellion dure mais brève. Une nouvelle ère s'ouvre pour le Hunan sous la direction du gouverneur Zhao Hengti."
 hnn.590.a: "Il est parti pour de bon cette fois."

 hnn.60.t: "La chasse à Tang Shengzhi"
 hnn.60.d: "La recherche initiale de Tang Shengzhi n'a donné lieu à aucune piste. L'équipe responsable de la recherche a commencé à chercher plus loin. Cela peut prendre du temps, mais nous trouverons sûrement le traître et le jugerons."
 hnn.60.a: "Espérons qu'il n'a pas fui trop loin."

 hnn.61.t: "Tang Shengzhi trouvé à Hong Kong"
 hnn.61.d: "Après deux mois de recherches, Tang Shengzhi a été identifié à Hong Kong. Une équipe a été constituée pour le ramener enchaîné dans le Hunan."
 hnn.61.a: "Ramenez-le, et nous le mettrons en procès."

 hnn.62.t: "Le procès de Tang Shengzhi"
 hnn.62.d: "Alors que deux de nos hommes ont été abattus à Hong Kong dans le processus, Tang Shengzhi a été ramené enchaîné à Hunan. Un procès pour l'exemple a été préparé et il est accusé de trahison. Bien que notre règne soit sûr, Tang Shengzhi reste populaire et l'exécuter pourrait laisser un certain nombre de personnes assez mécontentes."
 hnn.62.a: "Mort au traître !"
 hnn.62.b: "Exilez-le !"

#Zhao Democratic Events

 hnn.63.t: "Zhao Hengti gagne l'élection"
 hnn.63.d_1: "Bien que le scrutin ait été extrêmement serré, Zhao Hengti l'a finalement emporté d'une courte tête. Alors que certains murmurent que c'est la fraude qui l'a poussé à bout, tout au long de l'élection, Zhao a fait preuve d'une retenue inhabituelle, et comme il a eu le temps de consolider son régime, personne ne peut ouvertement défier Zhao sur le terrain."
 hnn.63.d_2: "Alors que beaucoup s'attendaient à ce que Zhao Hengti affecte frauduleusement les résultats de l'élection générale de Hunan, de l'avis général, l'élection a été libre et équitable. Zhao a néanmoins été réélu gouverneur."
 hnn.63.a: "Victoire !"

#KMT Events

 hnn.64.t: "Cheng Qian remporte l'élection"
 hnn.64.d: "Cheng Qian et le KMT ont gagné les élections. Ne voulant pas attendre pour assumer le poste de gouverneur, Cheng Qian a pratiquement chassé Zhao Hengti de sa résidence. Alors que beaucoup s'attendent à ce que Cheng Qian soutienne le KMT à Longyang, il est connu pour son indépendance."
 hnn.64.a: "Victoire !"

 hnn.65.t: "Une voie pour le Hunan"
 hnn.65.d1: "Notre victoire étant assurée, nous devons choisir de nous aligner sur la gauche ou sur la droite, moins en vue."
 hnn.65.d2: "La tentative de révolte nationaliste à Longyang a malheureusement échoué avant notre prise de pouvoir dans le Hunan. Avec notre victoire assurée, nous devons choisir de nous aligner sur la gauche ou sur la droite, moins en vue."
 hnn.65.a: "Se conformer à la ligne du parti."
 hnn.65.b: "Notre propre voie - s'aligner sur la droite du parti."

 hnn.650.t: "Hunan s'aligne sur la droite"
 hnn.650.d: "Alors que Cheng Qian n'était que récemment un membre important de notre parti, après sa victoire dans le Hunan, il a officiellement proclamé son désir de s'aligner avec la droite discréditée. Bien qu'il soit possible qu'une sorte d'arrangement puisse encore être conclu entre nous, beaucoup voient cela comme une trahison."
 hnn.650.a: "Une trahison."

 hnn.69.t.coup: "Coup d'État dans le Guangdong"
 hnn.69.d.assassinated: "Dans un acte des plus odieux, le seigneur de guerre du Guangxi, Ma Ji, a réussi à faire assassiner notre allié Chen Jiongming, le chef des fédéralistes chinois et du Liangguang. Chen avait été piégé pour assister aux funérailles du prédécesseur et père adoptif de Ma Ji à Nanning, dans le Guangxi, où il a été abattu dans une embuscade. Le gouvernement du Liangguang et du Guangdong étant en lambeaux, tout comme le mouvement fédéraliste, notre alliance avec eux est devenue nulle et non avenue alors qu'ils sombrent dans la guerre civile entre des dirigeants provinciaux qui se chamaillent."
 hnn.69.d.coup: "Voyant là une occasion de s'emparer du pouvoir, le politicien et général Chen Mingshu, allié du KMT, a mené un coup d'État contre notre allié Chen Jiongming à Guangzhou. Le sort de Chen Jiongming est actuellement inconnu, mais le moulin à rumeurs de la ville semble convaincu qu'il est toujours en vie et qu'il a fui vers le nord ou vers Hong Kong.\n\nBien que cela semble empêcher une guerre entre les deux provinces de Liangguang, puisque le Guangxi a récemment été saisi par Li Zongren, un autre seigneur de guerre allié au KMT, notre alliance avec Liangguang a été rendue nulle et non avenue par l'éviction illégale de notre allié du pouvoir."
 hnn.69.a: "Une nouvelle grave."

 hnn.70.t: "Hunan rompt son alliance"
 hnn.70.d.assassinated: "L'assassinat soigneusement planifié de Chen Jiongming a eu d'autres conséquences, car ses alliés du Hunan ont répudié l'alliance entre le Hunan et le Liangguang. Si nous ne pouvons plus compter sur leur soutien, cela signifie également que nous ne devons pas nous attendre à ce qu'ils s'immiscent dans le processus de consolidation du Guangdong sous notre direction."
 hnn.70.d.coup: "Alors que la guerre à Liangguang a été évitée par la déposition de l'ancien gouverneur Chen Jiongming, nos voisins du Hunan ont clairement fait savoir que l'alliance entre eux et Liangguang n'était plus valable, tout en dénonçant notre "prise illégale de pouvoir"."

 hnn.97.t:0 "Répercussions du Lundi Noir"
 hnn.97.d: "Même si le lundi noir n'a guère affecté les provinces intérieures, le Hunan a tout de même été touché. Il y a eu un ralentissement économique important pendant la nuit, mais il n'a pas été suffisamment dommageable pour détruire l'économie. Depuis des années, le Hunan se trouve dans une situation plutôt stable, avec une économie relativement faible par rapport aux autres provinces chinoises. Nos principales exportations sont la rhubarbe, le musc, le miel, le tabac, le chanvre et les oiseaux, et nous sommes un important producteur de thé et de ramie, deux produits qui, dans le cadre de la Ligue des huit provinces, ont été vendus aux concessions. Le gouvernement provincial doit maintenant utiliser ses capacités pour améliorer notre économie, faire des affaires avec d'autres puissances en Chine et mettre notre province sur la bonne voie."
 hnn.97.a: "Nous devons viser une meilleure économie."

 hnn.98.t: "Fin des difficultés économiques"
 hnn.98.d: "Notre économie ne souffre plus du léger contretemps du lundi noir. Elle est parvenue à se réparer et nous nous sommes débarrassés de tous les effets négatifs que nous avons subis."
 hnn.98.a: "Que notre économie devienne encore plus forte !"

 hnn.102.t: "Journée de la Constitution"
 hnn.102.d: "Aujourd'hui est l'anniversaire de la restauration de la constitution du Hunan. Pendant la période où la Constitution a été remise en vigueur, elle a apparemment réussi à protéger les citoyens du Hunan de trop de corruption et de mauvaise conduite, et l'expérience démocratique du Hunan a bien fonctionné."
 hnn.102.a: "Nous vous souhaitons une nouvelle année fructueuse !"

 hnn.104.t: "'Entrée n° 192 - Un autre jour à Changsha'"
 hnn.104.d: "'On dit que le général bouddhiste est revenu. Je ne me soucie pas de cela, ni de Zhao Hengti, ni de quoi que ce soit. Tout cela n'a aucun sens - je veux juste protéger ma famille sans craindre que ces manifestants fassent irruption dans ma maison. Bon sang, les prix augmentent rapidement à cause de l'effondrement, et personne ne veut plus que j'aiguise ses lames. Je déteste ça - je vais aller dans le nord et déménager à Wuchang avec ce qu'il me reste d'argent'.'"
 hnn.104.a: "'La vie est dure de nos jours.'"

 hnn.105.t: "He Jian interdit Alice au pays des merveilles"
 hnn.105.d: "Le général He Jian, censeur de la province de Hunan sous la direction de Zhao Hengti, a prononcé une interdiction unilatérale du livre "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland", de l'auteur Lewis Carroll. Il affirme que la représentation dans le livre d'animaux anthropomorphisés agissant sans autre différence que physique que les êtres humains est une insulte à l'humanité. Il explique également que les enfants, lorsqu'ils voient les humains et les animaux au même niveau, commencent à les considérer comme tels, ce qui, selon lui, a des conséquences "désastreuses".\n\nLes soldats ont reçu l'ordre de jeter et de brûler tout exemplaire des Aventures d'Alice au pays des merveilles qu'ils verraient. Dans toute la province, son action a été très mal perçue par les parents et les enfants locaux."
 hnn.105.a: "Il a raison."
 hnn.105.b: "C'est juste un livre pour enfants, annulez l'interdiction."

 hnn.106.d: "Tang Shengzhi a gagné les élections générales dans le Hunan. Notre homme, Cheng Qian, a été battu et est retourné au bercail."
 hnn.106.a: "Peut-être que ça va marcher."

 hnn.107.t: "Zhao Hengti remporte les élections dans le Hunan."
 hnn.107.d: "Zhao Hengti a gagné les élections générales dans le Hunan. Notre propre homme, Cheng Qian, a été battu et est retourné au bercail."
 hnn.107.a: "Bon sang !"

 hnn.108.t: "Cheng Qian remporte l'élection de Hunanese"
 hnn.108.d: "Notre homme dans le Hunan, Cheng Qian, a été élu gouverneur de la province. En tant que leader du Hunan, il a un immense pouvoir pour aligner la province sur notre mouvement."
 hnn.108.a: "Un allié dans le Hunan."

 hnn.109.t: "He Jian s'enfuit"
 hnn.109.d: "He Jian, le plus important commandant hunanais et allié de Zhao Hengti, aurait fui, probablement pour bénéficier de la protection de ses alliés à Beijing"
 hnn.109.a: "Ne laissez pas la porte vous frapper."

 hnn.110.t: "He Jian arrive à Pékin"
 hnn.110.d: "He Jian a fui le Hunan après la défaite de son allié Zhao Hengti dans cette région. Il est maintenant arrivé à Pékin et a obtenu notre protection."
 hnn.110.a: "Bienvenue !"

 hnn.111.t:0 "Le Général Bouddhiste prend le pouvoir !"
 hnn.111.d_gxc: "Tang Shengzhi, le "Général Bouddhiste" du Hunan, a déposé le gouverneur Zhao Hengti et a officiellement revendiqué la souveraineté du Hunan. Tang est un républicain rigoureux, et bien que sa loyauté ne soit pas claire pour le moment, il pourrait s'avérer être un allié dans le futur. Au moins, nos ennemis à Beijing ont été privés d'un allié."
 hnn.111.d_szc: "Tang Shengzhi, le "Général Bouddhiste" du Hunan, a déposé le gouverneur Zhao Hengti et revendique officiellement le pouvoir sur le Hunan. Tang est un républicain rigoureux et sa loyauté n'est pas claire pour le moment. Il pourrait s'avérer être un allié ou un ennemi à l'avenir. Ce qui est clair, c'est que le flanc sud de Beijing est désormais tenu par un ennemi de son régime."
 hnn.111.a: "Nous le suivrons de près."

 hnn.112.t:0 "Le Kuomintang prend le pouvoir au Hunan !"
 hnn.112.d_gxc: "[HNN.GetLeader], un chef rebelle du Kuomintang dans le Hunan, a pris le contrôle de la province et a officiellement déclaré son allégeance aux idéaux du Dr Sun. C'est un développement inquiétant, car notre flanc nord est maintenant exposé à un ennemi de notre régime."
 hnn.112.d_szc: "[HNN.GetLeader], un chef rebelle du Kuomintang dans le Hunan, a pris le contrôle de la province et a officiellement déclaré son allégeance aux idéaux du Dr Sun. Il va certainement s'aligner sur le KMT, ce qui pourrait s'avérer un problème pour nous."
 hnn.112.a: "Plus de soldats du KMT. Des chiens de salon pour le parti-État."
 hnn.112.b: "Le parti-État se renforce."

 hnn.113.t:0 "Zhao Hengti s'accroche au Hunan"
 hnn.113.d: "Zhao Hengti, le Gouverneur du Hunan, s'est maintenu au pouvoir après des élections que beaucoup, dans la province et dans toute la Chine, jugent truquées et injustes. Malgré ses affirmations de loyauté envers les idées du fédéralisme, il est évident qu'il n'est pas très attaché à la démocratie."
 hnn.113.a:0 "Heureusement que le gouverneur Zhao garde ses loyautés en mémoire..."
 hnn.113.b: "Les temps sont durs pour Hunan."

 hnn.114.t:0 "Zhao Hengti gagne les élections au Hunan"
 hnn.114.d_gxc: "Le Gouverneur Zhao Hengti vient de remporter les récentes élections provinciales dans le Hunan. C'est une excellente nouvelle pour nous, car la victoire électorale de Zhao signifie également qu'il a réaffirmé son engagement envers ses valeurs fédérales, plaçant ce qu'il pense être les meilleurs intérêts de la nation au-dessus de sa loyauté antérieure envers Wu Peifu."
 hnn.114.d_szc: "Le Gouverneur Zhao Hengti vient de remporter les récentes élections provinciales dans le Hunan. Cela a renforcé les fédéralistes car la victoire électorale de Zhao signifie également qu'il a réaffirmé son engagement envers ses valeurs fédérales, plaçant ce qu'il pense être les meilleurs intérêts de la nation au-dessus de ses loyautés précédentes envers Wu Peifu."
 hnn.114.a: "Il est rare de voir un homme suivre ses principes."

 hnn.115.t: "Ye Kaixin s'enfuit"
 hnn.115.d: "Ye Kaixin, l'un des commandants les plus loyaux de Zhao, a fui le Hunan, probablement en raison de la rivalité amère qui l'oppose à Tang Shengzhi. Les deux hommes se sont retrouvés à deux reprises dans des camps opposés lors de l'expédition du Nord. Croyant que Tang aurait voulu lui rendre la monnaie de sa pièce pour la prise de Changsha par Ye, le général s'est enfui de Changsha et du Hunan."
 hnn.115.a: "De toute façon, nous n'avons pas besoin de déserteurs !"

 hnn.116.t: "Ye Kaixin arrive à Beijing"
 hnn.116.d: "Ye Kaixin a fui le Hunan après la perte de pouvoir de Zhao Hengti dans cette région. Craignant les représailles de Tang Shengzhi pour ses actions lors de l'expédition du Nord, il a renoué ses liens avec le Zhili et est arrivé à Pékin pour demander notre protection."
