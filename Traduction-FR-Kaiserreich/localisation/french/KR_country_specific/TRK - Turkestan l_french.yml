 TRK_madamin_bek: "Madamin Bek"
 TRK_madamin_bek_leader_desc:9 "§YNaissance :§! §L1893, à Margilan, Oblast de Ferghana, Empire russe§!\n§YCarrière :§! §LMadamin Bek, né Muhammad Amin, a été sauvé de l'ignoble destin de l'exil sibérien (gagné en 1914 pour ses activités anti-tsaristes) par la soudaine Révolution de Février. Rejeton d'une maison de la noblesse de Kokand décrépite depuis longtemps, le jeune arriviste fut nommé chef de la police de Margilan par le nouveau gouvernement révolutionnaire de Tachkent à la fin de l'année 1917. Lorsque le soviet de Tachkent mit Kokand à feu et à sang, il engagea sa milice dans la cause du combattant de la liberté de Ferghana, "Petit" (Kichik) Ergash Bek, et gravit rapidement les échelons de la rébellion indigène. Lorsque Ergash Bek fut gravement blessé lors des combats à l'extérieur de Namagan, Madamin Bek fut proclamé Amir ul-Musliman, Commandeur des Croyants, par les commandants Kurbashi réunis.\n\nDans les années qui ont suivi l'établissement de l'Autonomie du Turkestan, Madamin Bek entretint des relations glaciales mais productives avec le gouvernement libéral de Kokand de Mustafa Shokay, bien qu'il se soit rapidement lassé des concessions répétées de privilèges et de droits faites pour maintenir la paix avec Moscou. Lorsque le Commissaire militaire de la région se révolta contre Moscou, Madamin Bek saisit l'occasion de prendre le pouvoir et de déclarer l'indépendance du Turkestan. Ce n'est que par une danse diplomatique minutieuse que Madamin Bek, aujourd'hui Président-Émir d'une nouvelle république, a pu survivre aux représailles russes. Bien qu'il soit un chef de guerre devenu président, Madamin n'est pas un autocrate. Il tente de gouverner par consensus lorsque c'est possible et a consacré des efforts considérables à la mise en place d'une administration civile viable. Madamin survit grâce à ses relations interpersonnelles et à son esprit de compromis, naviguant habilement dans le monde impitoyable de la politique tribale et sectaire pour gouverner une coalition chancelante.§!"

### Focus ###
 TRK_focus:9 "Arbre de priorité [TRK.GetName]"

 TRK_beating_heart:9 "Une nouvelle feuille pour la République"
 TRK_beating_heart_desc:9 "Pendant des années, les plus hautes fonctions politiques de notre république ont été attribuées aux chefs tribaux et aux seigneurs de guerre kurbashi, qui constituent la base de notre soutien politique. Toutefois, les récentes manœuvres de chefs religieux réformateurs respectés ont mis à mal la mainmise des conservateurs sur le pouvoir, à la grande inquiétude de Madamin Bek. Quoi qu'il en soit, nous devons construire un nouveau consensus au sein de l'Ittifaq ul-Musilmin au pouvoir afin d'intégrer ces nouvelles voix réformistes et pan-turques."

 TRK_expand_the_foreign_ministry:9 "Élargir le ministère des affaires étrangères"
 TRK_expand_the_foreign_ministry_desc:9 "Au début de la République, sous le règne du gouvernement fantoche de Chokay, le ministère des Affaires Etrangères n'était guère plus qu'un minuscule bureau sans aucun pouvoir face à la relation particulière du Turkestan avec ses suzerains russes. Lorsque Madame Bek a pris le pouvoir, les éléments isolationnistes de son régime ont empêché toute expansion. Avec un nouvel état d'esprit tourné vers l'extérieur, le moment est venu de reconstruire enfin cet élément intégral de notre nation."

 TRK_walking_the_turkestan_tightrope:9 "Sur la corde raide du Turkestan"
 TRK_walking_the_turkestan_tightrope_desc:9 "Diriger l’État du Turkestan a toujours nécessité de trouver un équilibre délicat entre les différentes factions et blocs de pouvoir qui se disputent la domination ou la destruction de la République. Si l’arrivée des réformistes au sein de la coalition gouvernementale a certainement compliqué les choses, ils se sont révélés être un contrepoids essentiel aux fondamentalistes, offrant à Madamin une nouvelle occasion de consolider son contrôle."

 TRK_our_ottoman_brothers:9 "Nos frères ottomans"
 TRK_our_ottoman_brothers_desc:9 "L’Empire Ottoman est, au fond, une nation turque, et son gouvernement soutient depuis longtemps notre république de manière semi-clandestine, en alimentant nos réformes économiques limitées par des investissements privés. Avec la montée du savinkovisme, le soutien d’Istanbul n’a fait qu’augmenter, et il ne faudrait pas grand-chose pour les convaincre de notre besoin de conseillers ottomans et d’un soutien militaire."

 TRK_support_dissidents_abroad:9 "Soutenir les dissidents à l'étranger"
 TRK_support_dissidents_abroad_desc:9 "Bien que notre gouvernement ne soit pas précisément motivé par des considérations idéologiques, notre résistance à l’impérialisme russe en Asie centrale nous a conféré une crédibilité aux yeux de diverses organisations panturquistes de la région. Il sera crucial de faire appel à ces alliés étrangers pour faire pencher la balance géopolitique en notre faveur si nous espérons préserver notre indépendance et œuvrer à la libération de nos voisins de la domination russe."

 TRK_contacts_with_young_bukharans:9 "Prendre contact avec les dissidents boukhariotes"
 TRK_contacts_with_young_bukharans_desc:9 "At one time, the city-dwelling merchant and intellectual class of Muslim Jadid reformers was Madamin Bek's greatest opponents, agitating against his authoritarian practices and aiding the Soviets in their invasion. Today, however, the Jadids know that in Central Asia, Madamin Bek is their greatest ally against the continued rule of the Emirs and Khans."

 TRK_tashkent_verniy_railway:9 "La ligne Tashkent-Verny"
 TRK_tashkent_verniy_railway_desc:9 "In the years immediately following the deviation of the Weltkreig, rail lines into Central Asia became a symbol of Russian-German economic cooperation, and a number of small joint projects were launched. In the years following, however, these prestige projects have been left to rot, abandoned by the distracted German industrialists and the increasingly hostile government in Moscow. We should refurbish them to better connect our lands to our Kazakh friends."

 TRK_supplies_to_kazakhs:9 "Aider les milices kazakhes"
 TRK_supplies_to_kazakhs_desc:9 "Conflict between the clandestine Kazakh militias and the Alash puppet government has been brewing for a decade now, threatening to light the spark which will once again draw Russian eyes south. There is no doubt in our minds, however, that if such a conflict should break out we must protect our allies within the militias, lest their defeat be the first domino to fall in the face of new Russian imperialism."

 TRK_turk_brother_nations:9 "Fraternité entre nation turques"
 TRK_turk_brother_nations_desc:9 "The Pan-Turkist project has the potential to be plagued by the divergent visions of each of the great turkic peoples and nations, losing sight of our goals in favour of narrow sectarian views of Turkdom. We will not make this mistake! Any nation which is home to the peoples of Turkic blood or who have opened their doors to the great many Turk refugees shall be our friends and our brothers!"

 TRK_studying_caucasus_tactics:9 "Étudier les tactiques du Caucase"
 TRK_studying_caucasus_tactics_desc:9 "In the months following the conclusion of the Great War, there were many in both the Russian and Ottoman armies who saw that the tactics employed by both sides in the Caucasus front were woefully out of date. Instead of listening to these young officers, both nations chose to blame the local populations, unlucky weather, and a host of other excuses. We will not make the same mistake."

 TRK_court_moderate_clergy:9 "Court the Moderate Clergy"
 TRK_court_moderate_clergy_desc:9 "The moderate muftis of Tashkent and Fergana have long played a critical role in the maintenance of peace in our nation, often acting as mediators between the mutual hostility of the Uzbek and Kyrgyz tribes. We need to unite these moderate groups behind our government to stabilise our rule, for if the faithful do not see our government as legitimate it will not survive long."

 TRK_favor_yaushev:9 "Favor the Yaushev Brothers"
 TRK_favor_yaushev_desc:9 "The Yaushev family of minor Tatar nobility have long been one of the most influential metropolitan clans in Central Asia, with family members and contacts scattered across the Ural and Alash regions of Russia, as well as in the city of Tashkent. With the death of Mullagali Yaushev, his sons Iskander and Hasan have taken up the mantle of leadership among the Yaushev merchants. Their support could prove invaluable in the coming conflict against Russia."

 TRK_ties_deep_in_russia:9 "Create the National Security Department"
 TRK_ties_deep_in_russia_desc:9 "Our republic has no formal body devoted to clandestine activities, putting us at a disadvantage compared to the major powers, and most notably our Russian opponents. While we do not have the funds to create an intelligence outfit from whole cloth, we canuse our Foreign Ministry to leverage their contacts and trading partners in foreign lands to help narrow the gap, just by keeping our ears open."

 TRK_favor_katta:9 "Favor the Ergash Brothers"
 TRK_favor_katta_desc:9 "While Kichik (Little) Ergash and Katta (Big) Ergash are not necessarily related by blood, they are certainly brothers in arms, fighting together in the struggle against the socialists. Neither man escaped unscathed, with Katta losing control over the Mujahideen and Kichik nearly losing his life. Regardless, these two men have forged deep connections among the Kurbashi, connections Madamin could leverage to secure control of his party."

 TRK_eliminate_party_factionalism:9 "Eliminate Party Factionalism"
 TRK_eliminate_party_factionalism_desc:9 "The Europeans have had a free hand in Central Asia for centuries, pitting brother against brother to further their own imperialist ambitions. In our struggle against the Russian menace, we have been shown what the true strength of our people could have been, were it not shackled by petty sectarianism and autocratic selfishness. It is time to rise above years of stagnation and division, so that we may forge a new nation."

 TRK_tashkent_city_fathers:9 "Amend the Tashkent Treaty"
 TRK_tashkent_city_fathers_desc:9 "While officially Tashkent is the capital of our young Republic, the reality is slightly more complicated. Having negotiated significant autonomy during the Tashkent Crisis, the city is largely self-governed by a council of Muslim and Russian figures, with only marginal input from Madamin Bek's government. With a hungry Russia on the borders, the time has come to renegotiate the Treaty and bring Tashkent into the Republic fully."

 TRK_reaffirm_anti_bolshevik_pact:9 "Integrate Russian-Led Militias"
 TRK_reaffirm_anti_bolshevik_pact_desc:9 "The Fergana Provisional Government was founded on the back of an alliance between the Muslim People's Army of Madamin Bek and the Russian Peasant's Army of Konstantin Monstrov, an alliance which saved Turkestan from Soviet rule and kept the peace. The victory of the Whites undercut the foundation of the alliance, but with the new rise of Savinkovism in Russia there is a new opportunity to unite the peoples of Turkestan against tyranny!."

 TRK_reconstructing_turkestan:9 "Reconstructing Turkestan"
 TRK_reconstructing_turkestan_desc:9 "Years of war and neglect have left their mark on Turkestan, with crumbling infrastructure connecting the empty manufactories of dilapidated urban centres. The foundations for a healthy nation remain, however, hidden behind a pessimistic veneer. If we could once again stoke the fires of industry and mend the railways and roads, Turkestan could truly rise as a modern nation."

 TRK_exploit_petrol:9 "Exploit Petroleum Deposits"
 TRK_exploit_petrol_desc:9 "Our republic sits atop a significant wealth of petroleum deposits, most which remain entirely untapped. While there were some half-hearted efforts to exploit these resources during the rule of Mustafa Shokay, we lack the resources and know-how to properly develop this industry. We will need to look outwards to larger, more industrialised, nations if we want to begin collecting this black gold."

 TRK_focus_on_heartland:9 "Connecting the Heartland"
 TRK_focus_on_heartland_desc:9 "Long have we found favour among the merchants of our cities, and long have we tailored our policies to retain their support. When the great men of Tashkent and Kokand prosper, all of Turkestan prospers…especially those worth bribing. Word travels fast among merchants, and there are many cities scattered across the steppes whose monied men who fast join us in our crusade against the backward autocracy and violent revolution."

 TRK_syr_darya_gold:9 "Syr Darya Gold"
 TRK_syr_darya_gold_desc:9 "The Syr Darya River dominates Turkestan, with it and its tributaries feeding the lush Fergana Valley with fresh water. The river does not only bring cool waters to the farmlands of Turkestan, but also carries gold deposits across the plains, driving an economy of collection and exploitation. Unfortunately, local warlords who funnel the wealth of this literal goldmine into their private armies and personal stashes. We will have to shake this system up if we hope to stake our own claim."

 TRK_building_a_war_chest:9 "Building a War Chest"
 TRK_building_a_war_chest_desc:9 "It is a universal truth that wars cost blood, sweat, and most importantly, gold. Our goal in the upcoming conflict is to bleed out the Russian bear through a prolonged guerilla war, but if we wish to outlast our enemies we will need deep pockets and well stocked arsenals. By taxing our new sources of revenue and carefully saving our earnings, we can be much better prepared for the violence to come."

 TRK_meet_with_kurbashi:9 "Host the Andijan Summit"
 TRK_meet_with_kurbashi_desc:9 "During our fight for independence, some took up arms to protect their families and their homes, a simple struggle for survival. On the other hand, others felt the draw of a more holy cause, pledging themselves as warriors of Islam. These figures have the potential to be zealous allies if we convince them of our support, and dangerous opponents if we turn our backs to them."

 TRK_form_professional_army_core:9 "Form a Professional Army Core"
 TRK_form_professional_army_core_desc:9 "The biggest hurdle towards modernising the military of Turkestan will be the centralisation of the army into a core of professional national units. While Madamin has a personal army of loyal cronies to draw from, no other Kurbashi would willingly give their soldiers to an army which may one day be used to destroy them, and few able bodied men wish to serve in an army which does not reflect their own tribal allegiances."

 TRK_integrate_militia:9 "Arm the Militias"
 TRK_integrate_militia_desc:9 "It is no secret that our army is little more than an amalgamation of small bands of soldiers, loyal only to their commanders and bound by bonds of tribal heritage, rather than national or civic duty. These commanders, the Kurbashi, each follow their own whims and morals, bound by covenants of greed and personal gripes far beyond any supposed ideology. It is by the will of these men that the army of Turkestan be born or die in the womb."

 TRK_horsemen_of_turkestan:9 "Horsemen of Turkestan"
 TRK_horsemen_of_turkestan_desc:9 "Turkestan has a long history of talented horse breeders and horse riders, and though the culture of horsemanship is not as prevalent in the Fergana Valley as it is on the steppes further north and east, there are still clear lessons to be learned from our legacy. The modern role of the horseman is increasingly clear - while cavalry charges will no longer define battles, information gleaned from talented scouts and outriders is more important than ever to achieving victory."

 TRK_inspect_ottoman_inspectorate:9 "Inspect the Ottoman Army Inspectorate"
 TRK_inspect_ottoman_inspectorate_desc:9 "The Ottomans have put a great deal of effort into modernising their equipment and tactics since the end of the Weltkrieg. Their Army Inspectorate, which works tirelessly to organise the dysfunctional logistics running from Anatolia to Fezzan, is a shining example of this spirit. We should look to replicate their successes, and avoid their mistakes."

 TRK_supply_the_outposts:9 "Supply the Outposts"
 TRK_supply_the_outposts_desc:9 "Our armies are divided between local Basmachi commanders and militia chiefs, some armed with little more than spears and matchlocks. If we hope to resist foreign invasion, we will need to share the wealth of the capital with these far flung outposts, supplying these commanders with rifles and arms. Hopefully, such actions could help to further our control over the countryside."

 TRK_from_bribes_to_salaries:9 "From Bribes to Salaries"
 TRK_from_bribes_to_salaries_desc:9 "While efforts have been made to institutionalise the patronage networks and informal relationships which serve as the bedrock of our administration, the truth is that our nation still largely plays by feudal rules. Now that we have sufficiently centralised our governance, we have the opportunity to burn out the rot and rebuild our Republic, from top to bottom, as we see fit."

 TRK_begin_wartime_rationing:9 "Wartime Rationing"
 TRK_begin_wartime_rationing_desc:9 "While we are loathe to restrict the buying and selling of foodstuffs and key war materials, it is a necessary sacrifice we will have to make to strengthen our defence and keep our war machine limping along for as long as we can. All of our citizens will do their part to make sure our soldiers march on full(ish) stomachs, and that the armouries and arsenals of Tashkent remain well(ish) stocked. To this end, the war begins on our plates - and every household is a squadron of fighters!"

 TRK_proclaim_holy_war:9 "Proclamer la guerre sainte"
 TRK_proclaim_holy_war_desc:9 "Our lands are truly united by one thing - the glory of our faith. The Ulemma have long been a guiding force of stability in Central Asia, and with the support of these wise fathers of the faith, we will be able to officially sanction our war against Russia as a Jihad of the sword. This is not an undertaking we will carry out lightly, but is there no better example of Jihad than the struggle against foreign domination, and the destruction of our very way of life?"

 TRK_rely_on_sufi_orders:9 "Se reposer sur les Ordres Soufistes"
 TRK_rely_on_sufi_orders_desc:9 "While the Sufi Orders are religious institutions of the study and transfer of mystical teachings, all in the pursuit of haqiqa - the ultimate truth - there is no question that they are also powerful institutions for the mobilisation of men. We will need their wholehearted support and conviction if we hope to resist our enemies in the field. It is lucky for us, then, that a number of our leading figures are all leaders of various Sufi chapters."

 TRK_banner_of_the_amir:9 "La bannière de l'Amir"
 TRK_banner_of_the_amir_desc:9 "When Kichik Ergash nearly perished at Namangan, the spirit of the national movement did not die with him. Instead, his banner - demanding freedom for the people of Fergana - found its way into the hands of Madamin Bek. The president accepted the weighty responsibility weaved into this banner because he, like all the patriots, freedom fighters, and true believers riding with him, knew that Turkestan is worth fighting and dying for."

 TRK_strengthen_the_party:9 "Renfoncer le parti"
 TRK_strengthen_the_party_desc:9 "The Union of Muslims was the first mass party in Turkestan, calling upon the support of the vast Muslim peasantry long before the National Union was founded or the Russian yoke thrown off. Today, it is largely the vehicle for Madamin Bek's national movement for independence, but continues to stand as the voice of the common person in Turkestan. We must not forget the role of the party, it is a critical symbol of our unity and commitment to native democracy!"

 TRK_reorganize_the_garrisons:9 "Réorganiser les garnisons"
 TRK_reorganize_the_garrisons_desc:9 "While many of our Kurbashi have argued that the only way we will defeat Russia is by taking the battle to them, the truth is that to survive against Russia we must take full advantage of any and all defensive advantages afforded to us. We will centralise local garrisons under the umbrella and control of the central government, so that we can better coordinate the disposition of our forces and prepare for the attacks which will surely put our walls to the test."

 TRK_create_wartime_coalition:9 "Créer une coalition de temps de guerre"
 TRK_create_wartime_coalition_desc:9 "There is little love lost between Madamin Bek and his Union of Muslim party, and the liberal and progressives of the National Union party. However, the recent alliance between our government and the party's exiled Kazakh leader has provided the avenue for a true wartime agreement between these parties and the full normalisation of relations, which have been decidedly rocky following Madamin Bek's coup in 1929."

 TRK_begin_the_revolt:9 "La marche pour Samarcande!"
 TRK_begin_the_revolt_desc:9 "Some wars are fought for inscrutable reasons, complex webs of factors leaving historians to debate minutiae for the centuries to come. This is not one such war. The people of Samarkand beg to be freed of that corpulent Bukharan Emir, and we will answer their call. The cheers of the liberated quicken our march and the wails of the oppressed drive us forward!"

 TRK_returning_our_favors:9 "Retour des volontaires kirghizes"
 TRK_returning_our_favors_desc:9 "The nucleus of the East Turkestan revolt was forged in the revolutionary spirit of Turkestan proper, with many leading figures in the revolt driven from their homes during the fires of the Urkun. Now, a group of Kyrgyz irregulars led by Id Mirab have sent word from their remote bases in the Tian Shan foothills that they wish to join our struggle. We shall invite them as heroes!"

 TRK_the_fergana_porcupine:9 "Le porc-épic de Ferghana"
 TRK_the_fergana_porcupine_desc:9 "To succeed in this war of survival against our Russian foes we must change our thinking, attacking the Russian resolve, as well as its armies. By focusing on attriting the Russian invaders, and smuggling the “true” details of Russian casualties to international sources, we will force Moscow to recognise that Turkestan will cost them more blood and treasure then they can afford to spend."

 TRK_rapid_adaptation:9 "Adaptation rapide"
 TRK_rapid_adaptation_desc:9 "While we did our best to prepare for the realities of a protracted conflict against Bukhara and Russia, it did not take long to recognise serious deficits in our strategy and organisation. By drawing on our relationship with foreign advisors, we can identify a few key areas to invest additional funding and effort, alleviating our worst inadequacies."

#Post-Uni
 TRK_deal_with_leftover_russians:9 "S'occuper des derniers russes"
 TRK_deal_with_leftover_russians_desc:9 "While there are even less ethnic Russians who happily call Turkestan their home now than there were prior to our war with the Russian bear, they still exist as an active minority with political and economic influence beyond what their numbers would betray. We will need to secure their right to live and work in our nation, while gently subsuming their outsized political control."

 TRK_crush_bukharan_exiles:9 "Écraser les exilés boukhariotes"
 TRK_crush_bukharan_exiles_desc:9 "A great number of Bukharan military and political leaders have fled across the border to Afghanistan, where their King harbours and protects them from any form of retribution, even as they raid our bordering towns. We will need to deal with them one way or another, either by negotiating with our Afghani counterparts or by simply crossing the border ourselves to take care of these dangerous dregs of the late puppet Emirate."

 TRK_behead_the_bandits:9 "Décapiter les bandits"
 TRK_behead_the_bandits_desc:9 "Where there is war, there are those who profit off of the misery of the combatants. Bandits can range from those who know their station, attacking the innocent with reckless abandon to eke out a living at their country's expense, to those who are even worse - bandits who disguise themselves in the pomp and circumstance of ancient and forgotten titles, excusing their robbery behind cruel traditions."

 TRK_secure_our_borders:9 "Sécuriser les frontières"
 TRK_secure_our_borders_desc:9 "Twenty years ago, there were few who believed that our proud lands would ever be free from the yoke of foreign masters. Today, our nation's mothers can breathe easy as militias return to their villages and well worn rifles are sent back to storage. The time of national emergency has passed, but the unfortunate truth is that the fires of war lurk on the horizon. The only way to guarantee our peace is to prepare for the next war, honing our abilities and remaining vigilant."

 #All Democratic
 TRK_hold_panturkestan_elections:9 "Tenir des élections panturques"
 TRK_hold_panturkestan_elections_desc:9 "The Europeans have had a free hand in Central Asia for centuries, pitting brother against brother to further their own imperialist ambitions. In our struggle for unification, we have been shown what the true strength of our people could have been, were it not shackled by petty sectarianism and autocratic selfishness. It is time to rise above years of stagnation and division, so that we may forge a new nation!"

 #Madamin Bek
 TRK_expand_the_conservative_coalition:9 "Élargir la coalition conservatrice"
 TRK_expand_the_conservative_coalition_desc:9 "All across Central Asia, millions believe in the righteousness of moderation, stability, and tradition. However, these people are divided by their tribe, their language, and the very traditions they seek to defend. Regardless, we must welcome this new cadre of citizens and leaders into the Union of Muslims, so that we may continue to be the leading voice of all Central Asian Muslims."

 TRK_divide_the_leftists:9 "Diviser la gauche"
 TRK_divide_the_leftists_desc:9 "In the cities, men tainted by poisonous foreign philosophies attempt to unseat thousands of years of history by the stroke of a pen. They brandish the outrageous quotes of dead men as though they were weapons, and threaten to tear apart all that is sacred. To prevent the insidious rise of this “National Union,” we must move to undercut their support by dividing the two wings of this dangerous party of radicals."

 TRK_draft_a_presidential_constitution:9 "Rédiger une constitution présidentielle"
 TRK_draft_a_presidential_constitution_desc:9 "We are still working off of the constitution written by the intellectuals of 1919, who envisioned Turkestan as an autonomous parliamentary republic under the Russian boot. We must reform the constitution to better reflect what our young nation needs, a strong and decisive executive to watch over a subordinate and steady federal legislature, both organs working in sync."

 TRK_develop_national_turkism:9 "Développer un turquisme national"
 TRK_develop_national_turkism_desc:9 "Long have the conversations surrounding Pan-Turkism been dominated by progressive and left-wing voices, while the more conservative elements of our republic remain divided by ethnic sectarianism. We will need to forge a new national identity, centred around our shared faith and the binding forces of recent history. This new ideology of 'National Turkism' will be the glue which binds our people together, and in time will be able to call upon the support of committed ideologues."

 TRK_formalize_limited_federalism_desc:9 "Our nation is divided between Russian and Turk, Uzbek and Kazakh, Tribesmen and Jadid. The strife of violent conflict threatens to tear our people apart, but we cannot give in to the base desire to overpower and dominate those territories newly incorporated into our republic. We shall instead build a nation of balanced compromise between order and autonomy, founded on the principles of fruitful coexistence."

 TRK_exercise_executive_powers_desc:9 "A key element of the powers vested in the presidency through the new constitution is his unilateral control over foreign policy, and his expansive formal influence over the nation's economic policy. While the government has always revolved around Madamin Bek, it is always better for these powers to be institutionalised and for the president to truly have a free hand to dictate the republic's path."

 TRK_marshal_turkestans_resources_desc:9 "Central Asia is a bountiful land, one which has the tools and resources to supply our young industries, so long as we are able to access and properly excavate these natural boons. We must not allow petty local grievances to prevent the progress we seek, and we cannot afford to rely on foreign companies to lead our resource extraction efforts as some in the past once did. We must instead stand on our own two feet and dig with our own two hands."

While much of our land is harsh and barren, there are fertile regions of bounty which can serve as a new breadbasket for the Turkestani state, no longer sucked dry by hungry bureaucrats and merchants from Moscow. We must extend support to the farmers of Fergana and the River valleys, so that they may modernise their techniques and increase their production!"

 TRK_assimilate_panturkist_rhetoric_desc:9 "Not everyone in our government truly believes in the pan-Turkic ideal which our Federation was founded upon. They may see the necessity of cooperation, or even the value of our unity during the struggle against the Russians, but they do not subscribe to the cultural and civic nationalism of the more ardent pan-Turkics. Regardless, we see the value of the pan-Turkic ideal towards the maintenance of peace and stability in our lands, and will relentlessly promote these views."

The worker is the lifeblood of a modern nation, and their voices must be heard! The President, long a friend of the small unions, will do everything in his power to see their expansion."

Now more than ever the people need a symbol they can look to for strength and honour, a light guiding the whole nation forward.

Our goal must be that of a united and peaceful republic, bound by a universal rule of law and beholden to democratic leadership. In reality, much of the land is ruled by Kurbashi tribal commanders, and most of our people are uneducated and detached from the world outside their village. These issues will be resolved by pragmatism, not idealism."

 TRK_ensure_governor_loyalty:9 "Ensure Governor Loyalty"
 TRK_ensure_governor_loyalty_desc:9 "Some people would say that the best way to rule over bandits is to think like a bandit. They are wrong. To maintain order in the southern territories, we will have to rely on firm military men that we can trust, lest the Uzbeks, Turkmen, and Kyrgyz get any ideas about where they stand on the pecking order. To ensure that our governors are both capable and loyal, they will be drawn from Madamin's personal staff."

 TRK_cast_aside_ideology_desc:9 "The minds of both our allies and our enemies are clouded by ideological dogma and impractical sentimentalities. Frankly, there is little room for such notions in our harsh domain. We have cast aside the philosophic creeds which blind others, and will rule instead through pure, hard-headed realism, whether the radicals like it or not."

The politicians fret about the lyrics to a national anthem while they ignore the true issues which plague our state. Madamin Bek will serve as this guiding hand, leading our nation towards a bright future!"

 TRK_legacy_of_tashkent:9 "Legacy of the Central Asian Revolt"
 TRK_legacy_of_tashkent_desc:9 "We spent five decades under Russian hegemony, time which irreparably damaged our culture and saw our lands infested with Russian settlers. In 1916, the people of Central Asia finally decided that enough was enough and rose up in rebellion. We fought long and hard, exploiting the Russians' civil war to retake our old territories. In the end, we finally regained our freedom but the price we paid was nearly unbearable. Huge portions of our population had been slaughtered, or deported from Central Asia, forced to seek refuge in the Chinese territory of Xinjiang. The Kirghyz population was particularly devastated by this, they came to dub this event the “Urkun” or “Exile”. A small trickle of refugees are now migrating back to Turkestan, hoping to return to their old homes. The Central Asian Revolt marked the birth of the Basmachi as an organised military and political movement, it served as the last straw which finally won us our independence. We will never forget what the Russians did to us and what they have taken from us. We will never bow to them again."

 TRK_shackles_of_tashkent:9 "Shackles of the Tashkent Treaty"
 TRK_shackles_of_tashkent_desc:9 "When we cast off the shackles of Russian oppression through a patriotic conflagration, we were forced to make a number of compromises to secure international recognition and bring an end to the Central Asian conflict. The Treaty of Tashkent forced us to grant de-facto independence to the Russian-dominated districts of our capital. and clauses within the treaty gave special rights and privileges to Russian interests throughout our Republic. Reclaiming our rightful capital and its vast industries will be of utmost importance in the near future, we must strive to strike at the Russians, at their first moment of weakness."

 TRK_basmachi_army:9 "Basmachi Army"
 TRK_basmachi_army_desc:9 "The term Basmachi is an Uzbek word for a bandit or attacker, a label employed by the Bolsheviks and White Russians alike to slander the freedom fighters who battled for Central Asian freedom. Though these warriors earned the respect of their opponents on the battlefield, our nation continues to be derided by foreigners as the “Basmachi Republic,” and the stain of warlordism and banditry will take a long time to wipe clean. The bravery of our soldiers is a source of pride for our Republic, regardless of what they may say abroad."

While Madamin Bek certainly has the political capital to maintain control over the party and the Republic, the shock of his recent pivot towards a broad coalition has left his traditional allies reeling."
 TRK_uneasy_alliance:9 "Un gouvernement d'union difficile"
 TRK_uneasy_alliance_desc:9 "The optimism of December has given way to the harsh reality of January. The political factions wrestle for power, arguments lead to violence, and the stability of the Republic is shaken. However, there are signs of hope. Even among the jostling and brinkmanship, newfound competition among the ministries drives the government forwards."
 TRK_uneasy_alliance_reformists_successful:9 "Un gouvernement d'union efficace"
 TRK_uneasy_alliance_reformists_successful_desc:9 "What was once considered impossible, namely the integration of Jadids into Madamin Bek's government, is now simply a fact of life. What were once shouting matches over control have turned into exasperated conversations about cooperation. The cabinet is currently carefully balanced between the conservatives, the reformists, and those personally loyal to the president, with each party carving out a base of support in the republican institutions."
 TRK_uneasy_alliance_reformists_fail:9 "Un gouvernement d'union conservateur"
 TRK_uneasy_alliance_reformists_fail_desc:9 "Madamin Bek has always been a man of temperance, and so his introduction of more reform-minded voices into his government has been properly tempered. While there is no question that Jadids will be a part of the government, and all parties have increasely accepted the need to cooperate with these more liberal figures, the elevation of Islamqul Polvan as Minister of Military Affairs has once again upset the careful balance in favour of the more conservative faction of the Union of Muslims."

With the economic domination of Turkestan much diminished following the exit of many muscovite industrialists, the opportunity has arisen to practically discard some of the more odious elements of our economic treaty with Russia, while renegotiating our protections to the Russian ethnic minority with local Russian leaders."

 TRK_shackles_of_tashkent_tt_desc:9 "By consulting with native “representatives of the Russian people” in Tashkent, we have declared a series of amendments to the special autonomy and protections afforded to our Russian citizens, much to the anger and chagrin of the saber-rattlers in Moscow. Truly, we have stepped into a new era of native Russo-Turk cooperation! Economic regulation, once aimed entirely at choking out native Turkic industry, has been replaced by common sense regulation, and the outrageous byzantine structure of autonomous government has been replaced by the executive fiat of the Tashkent Council. This new, comprehensive agreement between the ethnically Russian business interests of Tashkent and our government has made our republic stronger and more united than ever."

 TRK_shackles_of_tashkent_fp_desc:9 "With the finishing touches complete on the amendments made to the Tashkent Treaty, made with “representatives of the Russian people” within our lands, we have finally rid ourselves of the painful and obtuse requirements of the Tashkent Treaty, the result of meddling from the north. With practical protections to native business interests and peasant farmers, the people of Turkestan, both Russian and Turk, stand proud behind Madamin Bek. Our new, comprehensive agreement has made our republic stronger and more united than ever."

 TRK_consolidation_decisions_desc:9 "The Turkestan Republic is unified only by tenuous religious commitment and the personal clique that Madamin Bek has developed in the years following the Russian Civil War. These loose bonds of affiliation hold the nation together today, but simply cannot withstand the stress of open conflict. After all, when the peace of the post-war was shattered by the New Year's Coup in '29, Shokay's autonomy immediately collapsed into civil war. While Madamin Bek has a much tighter grasp over Turkestan than his predecessor, the Republic remains incredibly divided.

Each Bek, Kurbashi, and Minbashi pledges a fraction of their support and resources to a figure above them, and those who support Katta Ergash make up the backbone of the fundamentalist wing of the party. There are many such leaders whose loyalty can be bought, however, at the right price."
 TRK_bribe_mullah:9 "Purchase a Reformist Mouthpiece"
 TRK_bribe_mullah_desc:9 "The strength of the reform faction of our party is their ability to mobilise support in the cities of Tashkent, Andijan, and Kokand, mainly through the support of a number of mullahs who favor their position.

 TRK_country_intro_content:9 "At the opening of the Russian Civil War, Bolsheviks in the city of Tashkent, the hub of Russian controlled Central Asia, rose up in support of the Red Revolution, ousting the Russian colonial government and declaring the Turkestan Socialist Federative Republic. In response, liberal nationalist and pan-Turkist political movements declared rival governments, aiming to secure autonomy and democratic representation in return for loyalty to the Whites.\n\nIn Kokand, a group of liberal Jadid elites formed the Turkestan Autonomy (dubbed the Kokand Autonomy, as it was based in Kokand rather than the Bolshevik dominated Tashkent), led by Kadet and Alash notable Mustafa Shokay. While the Red forces in Tashkent had the initiative to begin with, rapid nationalisation campaigns and a lack of vital grain shipments quickly eroded their support among the peasantry, both Russian and otherwise.\n\nWhile the White forces in the north began to consolidate and secure their positions against the Reds, the various factions of the Fergana Valley shifted their allegiances. Ergash Bek's lieutenant, the moderate figure Madamin Bek, was able to forge an alliance between the Russian Peasant Army of Fergana and the Basmachi Movement. This new coalition army captured the cities of Osh and Andidzhan, though Ergash Bek was gravely injured in the siege of Andidzhan, leaving Madamin Bek as the undisputed head of the White movement in Fergana. Meeting the White forces of Pishbek, Madamin was recognised by the White government as the commander of the newly formed Fergana Army, made from a reconstituted Peasant Army of Fergana."
 TRK_country_intro_content_1:9 "With the Civil War coming to a close, the newly formed Constituent Assembly in Moscow officially recognised the Alash and Turkestan Autonomies, granting limited political privileges to the democratic governments in power in Alash-Qala and Kokand in return for continued Russian control in the region. The Turkestan Autonomy was granted de-jure control over the former Fergana, Syr Darya, and Samarkand Oblasts, while the Transcaspian Oblast remained under direct control of the Russian governor in Ashgabat. To oversee Russian military and economic influence in the region, the military commands were unified under the Commander of the Turkestan Military District, who projected the authority of the central government from his posting in Tashkent. With the power of the authorities limited to little more than minute regulations and meaningless squabbling, cities like Samarkand quickly turned to the Tashkent Command rather than the Commissar of Turkestan for support and stability.\n\nWith the close of hostilities, the old conflicts which had brewed underneath the surface of the Central Asian Whites bubbled back to the surface. While the liberal government of the Turkestan Autonomy was recognised as official by the new government in Moscow, Mustafa Shokay, Madamin Bek, and Konstantin Monstrov each fought to wrestle dominance over this new governmental apparatus. Though it appeared at times that the arguments would devolve into civil war, the three powers would eventually be able to create a power-sharing agreement which gave the majority of civilian control to Shokay and his progressive Shuro-I-Islam alliance, while granting Madamin personal control over much of the Fergana Valley and integrating most of the warlord armies into the new Automony's army, allowing Madamin to maintain his military supremacy.\n\nFor Monstrov and the Russian peasants, a series of treaties were drafted which gave Russian settlers and the Russian quarter of Tashkent some special privileges, while also tying the Autonomy closer to the economy of the Russian heartland. While Madamin and his close relationship with the Russian soldiers and merchants was instrumental in reaching this accord, he was shrewd enough to allow the civilian government to take credit for what would quickly be seen as unequal and hated treaties, driving many moderate Muslims from the Shuro-I-Islam to Madamin's allies in the conservative Shuro-I-Ulema."
 TRK_country_intro_content_2:9 "When Boldyrev launched his New Year's Coup in Moscow, the peace in Central Asia shattered. Vladimir Dmitriyevich Grigoryev, the Commander of the Turkestan Military District pledged himself to the putschist cause (assuming that the putch had Kornilov's support), along with most of the Russian soldiers stationed in the region, namely the Semirechye Cossacks and a significant portion of the garrison in Tashkent. Seeing this as an opportunity to secure true independence, Madamin rapidly assembled an army of loyalist Russians and Basmachi warriors and marched on Tashkent. Rapidly garnering the support of several key Jadid and Russian figures in the city, Madamin was able to rapidly depose the rebel commander and secure the city.\n\nWith the situation in Russia proper unknown and an army of loyalists at his back, Madamin crossed over the Rubicon, declaring himself President of a new Turkestan Republic. While Mustafa Shokay and his allies initially attempted to resist this declaration, they were forced to flee into the Alash Autonomy when forces loyal to Madamin captured Kokand in a surprise attack.\n\nIn the frenzy following the Tashkent Coup, local commanders loyal to Madamin Bek moved to secure contested regions and to depose Russian governors in Samarkand and Semirechye. Alash forces, which had remained loyal to the civilian government, had already clashed with the Cossacks in Semirechye. With Madamin's forces joining the fray from the south, the Cossacks were crushed and the region was divided in two as small raiding parties and warlord bands battled for disputed pockets of land. Samarkand would prove to be a more elusive prize for Madamin, who had collected a significant portion of his most loyal armies to march on the city. Sensing an opportunity to expand his influence, Emir Alim Khan declared himself the “Protector of Samarkand,” intervening in the conflict. Seeing the devastation of Semirechye, the city accepted the armies of Bukhara into their gates, and the leader of the Emir's armies, the disciplined Ibrahim Bek, began to prepare for a siege. Worried of a Russian or Alash attack from the north, and recognizing a hardened foe to his south, Madamin called off the invasion of Samarkand and prepared to defend his newly won territories."
 TRK_country_intro_content_3:9 "Madamin Bek was able to stabilise his regime, focusing on transitioning from an upjumped warlord to a genuine political statesman. To this end, he aligned himself with the urban merchants of Tashkent, bringing many of them into his nascent cabinet which would give his government a distinctly technocratic character, balancing this new group against the loyalty and satisfaction of the Ulema and Kurbashi, the foundations of his support. His willingness to settle with the Russians and pragmatic support for civilian government would serve to alienate him from some of his Basmachi warlord underlings, but he used the years of peace to purge disloyal officers and build an army more loyal to Madamin personally.\n\nRecent years have found Madamin growing more and more paranoid of Russian aggression, especially as reports increasingly indicate that Moscow eyes the borders greedily. Believing that only a unified Central Asian nation would stand a chance against the Russian eagle, Madamin Bek has increasingly subscribed to a pragmatic Pan-Turkist position, perhaps a further reflection of his increasing cooperation with the liberal merchants and Jadids. Using these ideological trappings, Madamin has begun escaping from the diplomatic isolation wrought by the Tashkent Crisis, notably forging clandestine ties with anti-Russian figures across the northern border and in Khiva."

 trkrep.99.t:9 "Legacy of the Central Asian Revolt"
 trkrep.99.d:9 "When Mustafa Shokay negotiated Turkestani autonomy with his Russian counterparts, he sacrificed much to prevent the ire of the central government in Moscow. Ignoring the years of diligent service against the Red menace, the Russian government held the Basmachi fighters in contempt and did much to chip away at the autonomy's control and authority. When political instability in Moscow threatened to disrupt Turkestan, Madamin Bek rose up to cast off the yoke of Russian oppression, and to forge a new independent republic in Central Asia, ousting Shokay and his progressive regime and clawing away limited territorial gains in Semirechye. While Madamin Bek was initially supported in his revolt by the wild Turkmen commander Junaid Khan, intervention by local Russian garrisons and the corpulent Emir of Bukhara forced him to the negotiating table, leaving Turkestan isolated and insular, and Madamin Bek's position uncertain.\n\nIn recent years, Madamin Bek has been able to stabilise his regime, focusing on transitioning from a warlord to a genuine statesman. To this end, he has further aligned himself with the urban merchants and trade unionists of Tashkent, bringing many of them into his nascent cabinet, giving his government a distinctly technocratic character. Balancing this new group against the loyalty and satisfaction of the Ulemma, the foundation of his support, Madamin Bek's control of the republic grows while his control of his party loosens. His willingness to settle with the Russians and pragmatic support for civilian government has served to alienate him from some of his Basmachi warlord underlings, but he has slowly isolated and eliminated some of his most zealous opponents.\n\nRecent years have found Madamin Bek growing more and more paranoid of Russian aggression, especially as reports increasingly indicate that Moscow eyes the borders greedily. Believing that only a unified Central Asian nation would stand a chance against the Russian vulture, Madamin Bek has increasingly subscribed to a pragmatic Pan-Turkist position, perhaps a further reflection of his increasing cooperation with the liberal merchants and the Jadid education movement they bankroll. Using these ideological trappings, Madamin has begun escaping from the diplomatic isolation wrought by the Tashkent Crisis, notably forging clandestine ties with anti-Russian figures across the northern border. Only time will tell, however, whether Madamin Bek's revolt against Russian domination of Central Asia will survive the weary eye of the awakening bear."
 trkrep.99.a:9 "For a Free Turkestan!"

 trkrep.100.t:9 "The Reshuffle"
 trkrep.100.d:9 "For the last six years, Turkestan has been led by the Ittifaq ul-Musilmin, a quasi-party of religious leaders, warlords, and tribal chiefs. From his position as president, Madamin Bek has balanced the whims of these various groups, awarding loyal subordinates and allies with ministerial posts and punishing sedition with demotion. In many ways, the maintenance of the nascent Republican institutions has been Madamin Bek's greatest achievement in his short tenure as leader of the nation, and while there are few who would call Turkestan a true democracy, that does not mean the voice of the people is not heard. It is just usually ignored!\n\nIn the last couple of years, however, new voices have grown louder from within the party. Some are the former cronies of the exiled Mustafa Shokay, who adequately kowtowed to Madamin Bek and his new government, while others are loyal members of the party who rode with our movement from the beginning. They all clamour for a great Pan-Turkist revolution, one led by Madamin Bek and aimed at uniting the whole of Central Asia against the Russian yoke. While this group began as a small band of outsiders, they can no longer simply be ignored. Recently discovered corruption (beyond the usual, acceptable corruption, of course) has provided Madamin Bek the political capital to sack two aging conservative ministers, giving him the opportunity to shuffle his government and introduce fresh blood. He has decided that prominent reformists Alihan Tura and Eshon Babakhan will take on the coveted positions of Foreign Minister and Minister of Sharia, respectively, finally giving the reform faction of the party a voice in his government.\n\nTura and Babakhan have immediately set to work reorienting the Republic towards their goals. They hope to strengthen our relationship with Turkmen leader Junaid Khan, reform the relationship between our Russian and Turkic citizens, and to open the door to allow more progressive clergymen into the lower levels of our bureaucracy. Whether they will meet all of their targets is yet to be seen, but Alihan Tura has already departed for Khiva and Eshon Babakhan works tirelessly to take a census of our Qazis."
 trkrep.100.a:9 "A new direction for the Republic!"

 trkrep.96.t:9 "The Turkestani Balancing Act"
 trkrep.96.d:9 "When Madamin Bek came to power in 1929, it was at the head of a large and unwieldy coalition of those dissatisfied with the stagnation and weakness of Mustafa Shokay's Turkestan Autonomy. He is beholden to village chiefs, Kurbashi captains, wise and unwise mullahs, and his ethnically Russian allies, and can only rule through the careful balance of these groups and the construction of consensus. Madamin Bek has spent the last seven years slowly chipping away at the traditional conduits of power, building a cadre of loyal party-members centered around his even keeled political ideology and a nascent cult of personality. After all, there is only one man who has been able to curry the favour of merchants and mercenaries, village beks and highland bandits, Russian industrialists and radical Mujahideen.\n\nMadamin Bek has the opportunity to reform the Union of Muslims Party and Turkestan as a whole, but to do so he must deal with the disparate wings of the party. The reformists, led by Alihan Tura, push for the dismantlement of military power in the civilian government and the eventual peaceful transfer of power to a more parliamentary government. The fundamentalists, led by Katta Ergash, have instead pressured Madamin Bek to disband the National Assembly and to concentrate power in the hands of the military defenders of the nation. Madamin Bek must balance these forces and strengthen his hold of the country if he wishes to survive a conflict unscathed."
 trkrep.96.a:9 "Tell me about these fundamentalists"
 trkrep.96.b:9 "Tell me about these reformists"

 trkrep.97.t:9 "Beks and Kurbashi"
 trkrep.97.d:9 "The traditional axis of power in the fundamentalist wing of the Union of Muslims and the region as a whole has long been the village chiefs and tribal leaders, commanding the personal respect and loyalty of their kinsmen far beyond any notions of civic obligation or ideological duty. The countryside of Turkestan is dominated by a patchwork of small hamlets, each led by a prominent figure titled 'Bek', an honorific meaning lord. Like the 'Beys' of the Ottoman Empire, many leading figures in Turkestan go by their title as chief, such as prime minister Madamin Bek, who was born Muhammad Amin. Some of these Beks took up arms during the violence of the last decades, gathering loyal cadres of relatives and friends to defend their homes from bandits and socialists. While some of these bands soon turned to banditry themselves, many coalesced around charismatic figures, who began titling themselves as “Kurbashi,” or leader of a band, or “Minbashi,” the leader of a thousand men. While the national military need for these warbands largely dissipated in the years following the Civil War, there is no question that the countryside of Turkestan is not ruled from Tashkent, but rather from the tents and houses of the innumerable Kurbashi warriors."
 trkrep.97.a:9 "Tell me about these reformists"
 trkrep.97.b:9 "They may need to saddle up again!"

 trkrep.98.t:9 "Progressives and Merchants"
 trkrep.98.d:9 "Outsiders look upon Turkestan with disdain and disgust, regarding our culture and people as backwards and ignorant. Of course, they are the ignorant ones, for the mark of the Islamic Renaissance and the great metropolitan Silk Road has left our nation with a powerful class of intellectuals and businessmen, who could debate the ear off even the most committed sophist. Starting with the widespread reform of the maktab schools, the progressives combined a modernist interpretation of religious texts with veiled anti-colonialism to create an ideology which demanded a modern and independent Turkestan. While some of these men aligned themselves with the Bolsheviks during the Civil War, many of them fell in behind Madamin Bek in his pursuit of a state guided by wisdom of Sharia. In recent years, Madamin Bek has increasingly invited many prominent Jadids and merchant families into his government, creating a civilian government which blends the conservatism of the Ulema with the progressive interpretation of Sharia proposed by the reformists. While the power of the civilian government is certainly limited, the Jadids and merchants maintain a huge amount of soft power in Turkestan, especially in the cities of Tashkent, Kokand, and Andijan."
 trkrep.98.a:9 "Tell me about these fundamentalists"
 trkrep.98.b:9 "Their cooperation is vital!"

 trkrep.101.t:9 "Our Treaties with the Russians"
 trkrep.101.d:9 "The conclusion of the Russian Civil War saw the construction of a new relationship between our region and the government in Moscow, forming Mustafa Shokay's Turkestan Autonomy. As the twenties rolled on, few thought that there would be much change to the status-quo. While the aging Basmachi and Jadid bickered, the Commander of the Turkestan Military District kept the cotton flowing north from his post in Tashkent. When Commander Vladimir Dmitriyevich Grigoryev marched his forces in support of an anti-government coup, the time was ripe for change!\n\nMadamin Bek dissolved the old autonomy and declared the independence of a new Turkestan Republic, before marching on Tashkent with an army of loyal patriots. When he got to the city, however, he found that General Grigoryev was already dead, murdered by loyalists, and that the Russians had largely demobilised and withdrawn to deal with the shockwaves of the failed coup. Meeting with elder merchants and leaders of Tashkent, Madamin forged an agreement which granted special privileges to the city in return for their loyalty. With his new territories secured and the Russian position in Central Asia rapidly deteriorating, Madamin was able to forge the Treaty of Tashkent with Russian agents, formalizing the sovereignty of Turkestan and his newfound dominion over the former heart of the now dead Military District, in return for continued Russian domination of trade and the humiliating recognition of Russian dominion over New Tashkent."
 trkrep.101.a:9 "Many compromises were necessary..."

 trkrep.102.t:9 "The Coming Storm"
 trkrep.102.d:9 "In comparison to the stormy days of the New Year's Coup, the last half decade has been a period of peace and stagnation, as all sides lick their wounds and hope to recover. Central Asia stands today as a pot teetering on the edge of boiling over, with intellectuals, bandits, revolutionaries, and despots all looking to carve away at the status quo. Across the borders, the Russian command staff draws out plans and calculates logistics, gleefully awaiting the moment when the humiliations of the Tashkent Crisis can be avenged, and generals champ at the bit, waiting for permission from their superiors to crush the autonomies and protectorates once and for all. It is only a matter of time before open conflict once again breaks out in Central Asia, and yet the armies and militias of the states found within the region are universally undisciplined, underfunded, and barely functional. It will take quite a bit of work to reforge peasant rabble and upjumped bandits into true armies, and one can only guess how each polity plans to reform their armies.\n\nHowever, there is one thing which is certain - §Rthe peace of ‘29 will not last.§!"
 trkrep.102.a:9 "The road to independence is paved by the army!"

 trkrep.103.t:9 "Black Monday Arrives in Tashkent"
 trkrep.103.d:9 "Nearly a month ago, the Stock Exchange in Berlin collapsed, wreaking havoc across global markets and damaging even the most isolated and distant economies. Most notably, the nearby economic hegemon in Moscow has been deeply wounded, as the ruble plunges in value and German and Austrian investment into the industrial market dries up. The investments made in Central Asia during the rule of Mustafa Shokay have tied our economy incredibly closely to that of Russia, with industrialists from Moscow, Petrograd, and Berlin bankrolling much of the construction in the cities of Kokand and Tashkent. With these figures rapidly abandoning their shaky investments in our lands, our loyal economy has all but frozen solid, but we have the opportunity now to resecure our economic sovereignty, after decades of foreign control. While the market for the cereals produced in the verdant Fergana valley has remained steady in the face of a global agricultural slump, the nascent cotton export market has been irreparably crippled by halted Russian interest. This is a moment of opportunity and danger in equal portions, and our government will have to tread carefully."
 trkrep.103.a:9 "We will need to rebuild"

 trkrep.104.t:9 "A Meeting with the Khivans"
 trkrep.104.d:9 "When Madamin Bek rose up against Russian domination, his only real ally came from an unexpected place, namely the Turkmen dictator of Khiva, Junaid Khan. While the Khivans officially maintained their loyalties to Russia in the peace which followed, Junaid Khan's march against the flailing Transcaspian administration and Alash Loyalists marked a key shift in Khiva's relationship with Moscow. In the years following, Junaid Khan's trusted lieutenant Aziz Khan has worked closely with our government, coordinating a plan of future resistance and building a network to funnel arms from Europe into the hands of the Basmachi commanders of Turkestan. Today, Khiva and Tashkent stand as the axis of a secret Central Asian liberation project, tempered only by Junaid Khan's Turkmen chauvinism and Madamin Bek's noncommittal attitude towards the pan-Turkism of many of his compatriots.\n\nMost recently, Aziz Khan and our new Foreign Minister Alihan Tura have met in the backrooms of the Khivan Khan's Royal Palace, hidden from the prying eyes and ears of Russian agents and Royalist spies. They used this meeting to propose a new round of coordination between the two rogue states of Central Asia, broadly centred around protecting against the increasingly hostile posture of the Russian government following the election of Boris Savinkov. These fresh negotiations are merely the latest in a series of diplomatic manoeuvres between our nations, which reached their zenith in November of 1935 with the Secret Pact of Assistance, a mutual assistance treaty forged in secret between the two nations by Alihan Tura (a feat which earned him his present role as Foreign Minister) in the wake of a particularly firebrand speech wherein Boris Savinkov called for the wholesale reversal of the Treaties of Tashkent. "
 trkrep.104.a:9 "His belligerence gave us the opportunity we needed."

 trkrep.105.t:9 "Turkestani Gold"
 trkrep.105.d:9 "While we lack much in the ways of industry, our lands are blessed with bountiful sources of gold, either mined by corvee labour in great open pits, or panned out of the great rivers which carry tonnes of gold dust out of the highlands each year. Much of this gold gathering infrastructure is controlled by a cabal of wealthy Kurbashi, who maintain their independence through regular and generous personal gifts to Madamin Bek, usually in the form of gold embroidered silk clothing, gold woven carpet, as well as beautiful gold jewellery fashioned by some of the finest zargar jewellers in Tashkent and Andijan. The sale of these products into Russia and abroad into the markets of Mitteleuropa has fuelled Madamin Bek with vitally needed foreign capital, giving him a means to import specialised goods and fund foreign policy initiatives."
 trkrep.105.a:9 "Gold for a new golden age!"

 trkrep.106.t:9 "Expanding the Secret Pact"
 trkrep.106.d:9 "As we expected, Russian manoeuvres to shore up their control in the Khanate of Khiva have backfired with word just reaching Tashkent this week, detailing the bungled Russian diplomatic manoeuvre. They attempted to remove Junaid Khan's favoured Russian agent, General Ivan Zaytsev, who has long stood as the most solid nail holding down Russian control of Khivan politics. To have made such a move can only mean one thing - Moscow is looking to ruin their shaky relationship with their unhappy Khivan ally, presumably in an attempt to provoke them. It is now clear that Russia seeks to justify a conflict in Central Asia, and that the only way we will survive is through the continued expansion of the Turkestan-Khiva Secret Pact. Junaid Khan's trusted lieutenant Aziz Khan appears to agree with our appraisal, at least insofar as he has agreed to meet with us on short notice to discuss the Khanate's pivot towards closer coordination with our government.\n\nIn preparation, Alihan Tura has gotten the greenlight from Madamin Bek to pitch a radical new direction for our two nations. We would propose a large, public conference between the leading statesmen of Turkestan and Khiva, as well as dissidents, exiles, and rebels who share our desire for Central Asian cooperation and our firm stance in resistance to Russian domination of the region. In the days following the Christmas Coup throughout the chaos of the Tashkent Crisis, Junaid Khan and Madamin Bek coordinated their forces in indirect support of one another - why should they not stand together today, as Russia greedily eyes our lands and marches on our borders? A conference for cooperation would serve as the first step towards building a new Pan-Turkist liberation project, regardless of Junaid Khan's Turkmen chauvinism and Madamin Bek's noncommittal attitude towards his minister's idealism. Alihan Tura will invite Junaid Khan to personally attend this meeting so that he may once again meet Madamin Bek - hopefully the personal charms of Turkestan's president will be enough to convince the Khivan warlord to come on board, but regardless such a meeting will mark a new era of unity between our people! We need only to choose how we will approach Aziz Khan and the Khivans with our proposals - we want to entice their support, but we cannot appear to look weak by kowtowing too deeply towards the Khivans. After all, they need our help as much as we would like theirs."
 trkrep.106.a:9 "Sweeten the pot with additional arms deals and gifts!"
 trkrep.106.b:9 "Shout about unity all you want, but remember that this is an alliance of necessity, not desire."

 trkrep.107.t:9 "The Ballad of Mustafa Shokay"
 trkrep.107.d:9 "When the Tashkent Soviet marched on the newborn Kokand Autonomy in February of 1918, the then Minister-Chairman Mustafa Shokay fled north from the city, entrusting the defence of the city to its police chief Kichik Ergash and popular mullah Katta Ergash, a duo who, despite losing Kokand to the godless Reds, would go on to form the nucleus of the Fergana national liberation movement. As the Basmachi commanders bled and died in droves for Turkestan, Shokay spent his days rubbing elbows with Russian military and political figures, ingratiating himself to them as a ‘reliable native.' It was thus that when, two years later, the last vestiges of Bolshevik resistance surrendered in Perovsk, it was Shokay who the provisional government looked to for guidance and support. It was thus under Shokay's guiding hand that Turkestan spent a decade atrophying from Russian exploitation, as he repeatedly tried and failed to reach any sort of lasting political reform through negotiation with Moscow. That is not to say that Shokay was not a Turkestani patriot - as Moscow showed its disinterest in any form of reasonable or fair accommodation with the autonomy, he increasingly led the charge against Russian highhanded overreach, risking his position within the Russian backed National Union government to fight for true Turkestani liberty. Unfortunately, when Madamin Bek cut the Gordian knot of Russian intransigence with his march on Tashkent, Mustafa Shokay chose not to support this new independent government, instead fleeing north into the Alash Autonomy, where he today lives in exile."
 trkrep.107.a:9 "Perhaps we can convince him to rejoin our cause?"

 trkrep.108.t:9 "Turkestan Invites Us to Pishpek"
 trkrep.108.d:9 "Aziz Khan has informed us of a dramatic new development on our borders - the Turkestan Republic has proposed a grand conference of Central Asian leaders in their city of Pishpek, gathering all those who would oppose Russian domination in the region. While officially the conference's purpose is to negotiate comprehensive trade agreements across the region, it is an open secret that the leaders assembled will discuss much more than copper coins. In fact, Aziz Khan appears convinced that this gathering will lead to a true alliance against Russian domination among the people of Central Asia. He claims that we have had incredible success in dealing with Turkestan's Foreign Minister Alihan Tura in preliminary meetings to expand the limits of our Secret Pact with Turkestan, forged against Russia at the height of the Tashkent Crisis half a decade ago.\n\nWith our relationship with Moscow deteriorating rapidly following their arrogant moves against our independence, we will need to forge closer relations with our neighbours, especially Turkestan. However, Junaid Khan has personal concerns over tying ourselves to any other nation, especially a nation which has spurned the natural order of the world - with the ruled serving upon the heavens' chosen as a Khan - in favour Socialist notions of the ‘republic' and ‘elections.' What is to stop Madamin Bek from being voted out in favour of yet another Russian lackey in ten years' time? However, Aziz Khan is right about one thing, Khiva cannot afford to wait, sitting on its hands while Russia prepares an intervention. Whether our would-be allies are godless heathens or the khans of old reborn, we must meet with them to stand against Moscow. The only real question is whether Junaid Khan himself should attend. He is the undisputed ruler of Khiva, but is also advanced in his age and paranoid of some sort of foul play in foreign lands. He could just as easily send Aziz Khan as his agent, considering our lieutenant is very knowledgeable on matters of foreign affairs, and has worked closely with Alihan Tura in the last couple of months. He can be trusted to get us the guarantees we need."
 trkrep.108.a:9 "We will go to Pishpek together!"
 trkrep.108.b:9 "Better to be safe than sorry - send Aziz Khan with my orders."

 trkrep.109.t:9 "The Pishpek Conference"
 trkrep.109.d.trkjk:9 "The assembly was a diverse patchwork of men hailing from various tribes, countries, and walks of life. Fergana and Khorezm Kurbashi sat muttering in small huddles, while rival intellectuals from Samarkand and Tashkent eyed each other warily. Men of the Alash Autonomy, in equal numbers liberal statesmen and hardened soldiers, sat stoically together, joined by a quiet agent from the Ottoman government. In the back of the room, a rough looking band of exiles hailing from Xinjiang talked tersely amongst themselves. Junaid Khan sat in the middle of the room, surrounded by his couriers, looking decidedly uncomfortable. All would turn to attention once Madamin Bek laid out his plan for the future of Central Asia: while Russia could easily crush any individual attempt to dislodge their grip on Central Asia, if the disparate regional resistances pooled their strength they would present a difficult enough foe that Russia would be forced to the negotiating table.\n\nBefore he could move forward in his attempts to convince the other attendees, however, Alash commander Sadyk Amanzholov rose to speak. According to the Kazakh militia leader, there was a widespread conspiracy brewing in his Russian controlled homeland, with significant portions of the Alash Party and militia leadership looking to break ranks with the Autonomy's leadership to stand against Russian domination. Amanzholov claimed that in as little as two years he would be ready to lead the Kazakhs to freedom by overthrowing the pro-Russian government - a spark which would likely lead to Russian intervention.\n\nImmediately the various parties began excitedly discussing the viability of such an endeavour, and how the various groups present would need to help to bring it to fruition. It was not long before the outlines of a coordinated uprising in the same vein of the 1916 revolution had been drawn up, along with the provisions which would underline a new secret defensive alliance, not only between Khiva and Turkestan, but also with this new Kazakh Conspiracy. As discussions continued, more and more parties began proposing various schemes and ventures the alliance could undertake to better unify the nations and groups involved. Of course, such schemes require funding, and the question remains as to how much the Turkestani Republic will contribute."

In the back of the room, a rough looking band of exiles hailing from Xinjiang talked tersely amongst themselves. All would turn to attention once Madamin Bek laid out his plan for the future of Central Asia: while Russia could easily crush any individual attempt to dislodge their grip on Central Asia, if the disparate regional resistances pooled their strength they would present a difficult enough foe that Russia would be forced to the negotiating table.\n\nBefore he could move forward in his attempts to convince the other attendees, however, Alash commander Sadyk Amanzholov rose to speak. According to the Kazakh militia leader, there was a widespread conspiracy brewing in his Russian controlled homeland, with significant portions of the Alash Party and militia leadership looking to break ranks with the Autonomy's leadership to stand against Russian domination. Amanzholov claimed that in as little as two years he would be ready to lead the Kazakhs to freedom by overthrowing the pro-Russian government - a spark which would likely lead to Russian intervention.\n\nImmediately the various parties began excitedly discussing the viability of such an endeavour, and how the various groups present would need to help to bring it to fruition. It was not long before the outlines of a coordinated uprising in the same vein of the 1916 revolution had been drawn up, along with the provisions which would underline a new secret defensive alliance, not only between Khiva and Turkestan, but also with this new Kazakh Conspiracy. As discussions continued, more and more parties began proposing various schemes and ventures the alliance could undertake to better unify the nations and groups involved. Of course, such schemes require funding, and the question remains as to how much the Turkestani Republic will contribute."
 trkrep.109.d.khinojk:9 "Aziz Khan sat quietly in a dingy, smoke-filled back room of the Pishpek Teahouse, growing increasingly excited. He was surrounded by a room full of exotic strangers. To his left, a gaggle of dusty looking Kazakh officers, joined by the proteges of Turkestani exile Mustafa Shokay, discussed strategy in hushed tones. To his right, wealthy merchants and a famed poet mused about the latest cultural developments in Samarkand, and behind him veterans of the Urkun, swapped war stories. Aziz Khan was by no means an uncurious man, and his ear wandered into the various conversations, picking up hints and bits from various different groups before a sudden hush fell upon the room. Madamin Bek had arrived, quickly launching into a grandiose presentation of his plans for Central Asia.\n\nHe argued that while Russia could easily crush any individual attempt to dislodge their grip on Central Asia, if the disparate regional resistances pooled their strength they would present a difficult enough foe that Russia would be forced to the negotiating table.He had just begun explaining how those assembled could contribute to such a cause when Sadyk Amanzholov, Alash Party insider and commanders of Kazakh militias, rose to speak, proclaiming that significant portions of the militia leaders and Alash Party members looked to break ranks with the Autonomy's leadership to stand against Russian domination. Furthermore, he claimed that in as little as two years he would be ready to lead the Kazakhs to freedom by overthrowing the pro-Russian government - a spark which would likely lead to Russian intervention.\n\nThe news hit Aziz Khan like a bullet - if what Amanzholov claimed was true, the combined forces of Turkestan, Khiva, and the Alash rebels stood a serious chance of bleeding the Russians dry on the steppes.  It was not long before the outlines of a coordinated uprising in the same vein of the 1916 revolution had been drawn up, along with the provisions which would underline a new secret defensive alliance, not only between Khiva and Turkestan, but also with this new Kazakh Conspiracy. As discussions continued, more and more parties began proposing various schemes and ventures the alliance could undertake to better unify the nations and groups involved. Of course, such schemes require funding, and the question remains as to how much the Khanate of Khiva will contribute - while Junaid Khan will likely be upset should Aziz Khan make serious commitments, he has some leeway to choose the level of investment their realm will pursue."
 trkrep.109.d.khijk:9 "Junaid Khan sat quietly in a dingy, smoke-filled back room of the Pishpek Teahouse, slowly growing impatient. Aside from his most trusted bodyguards and Aziz Khan, he was surrounded by strangers. To his left, a gaggle of dusty looking Kazakh officers grumbled, their ‘friends' from Turkestani exile Mustafa Shokay's Turkestan National Army looking uncomfortable next to them. To his right, chubby merchants and writers fretted in chittering tones about some new play making waves in Samarkand, while behind him rough looking exiles from Xinjiang complained loudly about some inconvenience. For the Serdar Karim of Khiva, this social bombardment was far more deadly than the artillery barrage his fighters faced outside Urgench or the hail of gunfire he braved at the walls of Petro-Aleksandrovsk. Luckily for the Turkmen general, the room would hush upon the arrival of Madamin Bek, who immediately set about laying out plans for their new shared mission.\n\nThe plan he painted was simple - while Russia could easily crush any individual attempt to dislodge their grip on Central Asia, if the disparate regional resistances pooled their strength they would present a difficult enough foe that Russia would be forced to the negotiating table. Junaid Khan had serious doubts about the benefits of Madamin Bek's vision, but the equation was turned on its head when Kazakh commander Sadyk Amanzholov rose to speak. According to Amanzholov, there was a widespread conspiracy brewing in the Alash Autonomy, with significant portions of the Alash Party and militia leadership looking to break ranks with the Autonomy's leadership to stand against Russian domination. It was Mustafa Shokay who had drawn him to Pishpek, but now that he was here Amanzholov proclaimed that in as little as two years he would be ready to lead the Kazakhs to freedom by overthrowing the pro-Russian government - a spark which would likely lead to Russian intervention.\n\nClearly excited by these new prospects, the various bodies began discussing the hows and whens of any such coordinated uprising, along with the provisions which would underline a new secret defensive alliance, not only between Khiva and Turkestan, but also with this new Kazakh Conspiracy. Junaid Khan could not help but begin to drift away from the room, and back to the battlefields which surely awaited them all. Either he would save the Turkmen people in battle, or doom them to an eternity of Russian slavery. He was brought back to the present by Aziz Khan whispering in his ear, asking him how much the Khanate could afford to invest into the new alliance."
 trkrep.109.a:9 "We'll give them whatever you think is reasonable."
 trkrep.109.b:9 "An investment into this alliance is an investment into our freedom!"
 trkrep.109.c:9 "Be frugal! We will not put more into this than what we get out."
 trkrep.109.e:9 "Investments? This is an alliance, not a company. We will invest on the battlefield!"

 trkrep.110.t:9 "Our Frontman in the Alash Autonomy"
 trkrep.110.d:9 "When we signed ourselves to the support of the Kazakh patriots within the Alash Autonomy, we opened the door to the complex web of interpersonal and political relationships within this grand officers conspiracy. While nominally allies, and personally friendly with one another, Mustafa Shokay and Sadyk Amanzholov are diametrically opposed in their vision of the future of the Kazakh people. Shokay is a true believer in a unified federal republic of all Turkic peoples in Central Asia, modelled after German and American federalism, and believes that should the allies of Pishpek succeed in their goals, they should join together to form a country powerful enough to stand up to the domination of the region by foreign powers. While Amanzholov shares his desire to maintain the independence of the future Kazakh Republic, he is clearly less interested in any form of unification, coloured by Kazakh nationalism instead of Shokay's Pan-Turkist inclinations.\n\nThese conflicts of ideology have trickled down into all of our dealings with our erstwhile Kazakh allies: to whom do we send support? In the last months, we have focused much of our aid to Shokay's Turkestan National Army, as old ties between Shokay's exiles and our countrymen have been revived by the recent warming of relations and the expansion of our domestic Pan-Turkist propaganda. Shokay has welcomed these investments with open arms, and has proposed a number of further opportunities for cooperation between his personal army and our northern Kyrgyz Kurbashi. Amanzholov has privately reached out to us, requesting that we limit our future aid to Shokay and his allies, explaining that the rapid expansion of the Legion has worried Alash loyalists and Russian spies, and that Shokay was struggling to plausibly deny his recent alliance with us. Behind this potentially reasonable excuse, there is the matter of Alash politics, as Amanzholov potentially feels threatened by the growth of Shokay's power as a force in the Autonomy not subordinated to his command. On the other hand, we generally agree with the stalwart militia commander, as Shokay is a slippery fish, and empowering him further may give him increased leverage to cause trouble in the future."
 trkrep.110.a:9 "Shokay is our closest ally in the Autonomy, give what he needs."
 trkrep.110.b:9 "Amanzholov is right, let's focus on our own soldiery."

 trkrep.111.t:9 "Focusing the National Security Department"
 trkrep.111.d:9 "When Alihan Tura took control of the foreign ministry, he was realistic about the resources available to him - his was a poor ministry in a poor nation. However, increasing focus on the ministry has resulted in some new pockets of funding to be carved out to specific missions, hand selected by Madamin Bek himself with the approval and guidance of Tura. The most recent foray into expanding the foreign ministry has been the National Security Department, a new group with a nebulous purview but the zealous support of Madamin Bek. At the end of the day, the department could be oriented to serve one of two separate and opposite missions - either the expansion of Turkestan's clandestine network of informants and agents in the Russian controlled Alash Autonomy, or the strengthening of our domestic protections against foreign intrusion, namely from Russia. There is not enough funding to pursue both opportunities, and diffusing the money into both projects in a half-hearted attempt to have it all would likely lead to neither achieving the objectives that we set out. Alihan Tura has little love for this new department, seeing it largely as an attempt by Madamin Bek to inject some of the more ‘old guard' party men into Tura's new little reformist fiefdom (a fear that is probably accurate), and so he has not weighed in on the situation, perhaps hoping that without his intervention the Department will be shelved and the funds rolled back into the ministry as a whole. Without his guidance, it is wholly up to Madamin Bek to determine the direction this new group will take."
 trkrep.111.a:9 "Prioritise coordinating with our Kazakh allies."
 trkrep.111.b:9 "Focus on protecting our leaders from potential attacks."

 trkrep.112.t:9 "Where do Russians Fit in a Pan-Turk World?"
 trkrep.112.d:9 "To say that Madamin Bek has a tumultuous relationship with the majority of his Russian citizenry would be an understatement. To most, he is the man who overthrew Shokay's “Russian-friendly” government and began a cooldown with Moscow that saw their businesses suffer and their livelihoods called into question. However, the last five years has seen the mood among Turkestan's Russians warm to Madamin Bek: he granted significant privileges and accommodations to his Russian friends, and those most angry about his rise left to return to their homeland. However, even the most loyal of Tashkent's Russians are concerned by the recent outpouring of Pan-Turk sentiments from Madamin Bek's government, seeing this new native nationalism as a threat to the delicate balance forged between the Uzbeks, Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, and Sarts and the comparatively tiny Russian community in the Republic. While obviously our intention was never to alienate our Russian citizenry, there's no doubt that all of our propaganda espousing the virtues of ‘Unity Among Turks' and' Turks Standing Together' have ruffled some feathers, especially as tensions have risen between Turkestan and Russia proper. Of course, the vast majority of ethnic Russians living in Turkestan are loyal only to their homeland, but there are some who see this nation as their opportunity to carve out a little Russia in their image of the nation, a springboard by which change might be exacted in Moscow or a petty fiefdom in their own image. For them especially, the new emphasis on Pan-Turkish is threatening, and Madamin Bek must find a way to bring them back into the fold."
 trkrep.112.a:9 "Personally assuage these key leaders of their doubts."
 trkrep.112.b:9 "Tone down the more questionable rhetoric."

 trkrep.113.t:9 "The Pishpek Pact Grows Closer!"
 trkrep.113.d:9 "While officially, the Pishpek Pact is a binding agreement allying Khiva and Turkestan, the truth is that the two nations are not particularly unified in practice or purpose. Driven together by their shared hatred of Russia and, to a lesser extent, Bukhara, there is little love lost between Junaid Khan and his fiercely independent autocratic monarchical regime and Madamin Bek, whose rule is cemented by limited democratic allowances and a nascent republican Pan-Turkic ideology. Despite their significant differences, recent developments have allowed the two nations to more closely coordinate with each other. One never knows when something as simple as a meeting and handshake between two minor Kurbashi will pay dividends, when and if the two men are thrust together into a desperate defence or hopeless assault. Supply lines supplement one another, ammunition is traded to supply weapons equipped by one side or the other, and key phrases in Turkmen, Uzbek, and Tajik are exchanged, strengthening our armies and our resolve. These small improvements, added together, are beginning to be noticed throughout our nation."
 trkrep.113.a:9 "Together, we will stand tall against Russia!"

 trkrep.114.t:9 "The Cover"
 trkrep.114.d:9 "The smoke filled teahouse at the centre of Pishpek has always been a meeting place for a diverse group of peoples, with the city sitting in the midst of Kazakh, Kyrgyz, and Uzbek tribal lands. However, today the teahouse has been graced by men from all corners of Central Asia, along with a few brave or curious Russians. Outside, a wizened old aide from Madamin Bek's office quietly ushers a sharply dressed journalist and his photographer  through a rear door into the building. They have been sent south by a middling Petropavlovsk paper to cover the “Sart Merchants' Meeting in Pishpek,” aiming to generate the sort of dry meaningless drivel that businessmen with too much time on their hands tend to read. The journalist is guided through a couple of rooms filled with moustachioed merchants abuzz with discussions of denars and trade deficits in mixed Russian, Uzbek, and Sart. Finally, they were guided into a room with a few grizzled looking interviewees, who all droned on in monotones about cotton prices and rail expansions. Growing weary and worried that whatever story came from this Turkestani rathole wouldn't even catch the eye of the most tedious Petropavlovsk cloth merchant, the journalist couldn't help to inquire about a rumour he had heard on his way in - that the Turkmen dictator of Khiva, Junaid Khan, was in attendance.\n\nThe response captured his attention: while the Khivan leader would not take interviews and did not wish to be photographed, Junaid Khan was present, regardless of his interest in any of the trade deals being made here. He had supposedly joined the deliberations to symbolise his commitment to native cooperation and his rejection of Russia, and vocally hoped that the Russian people would take notice of his breaking with the Russian merchants of his court to travel to the heart of anti-Russian sentiment in Central Asia. The journalist couldn't help but perk up when he heard that Junaid Khan's manoeuvre was intended to ‘catch the attention of and anger the Russian people.' Manoeuvres like these tend to catch eyes and make money. Snapping a few hasty photographs, the journalist quickly but politely retreated from the tea house, hoping to catch the next train north. He had gotten his headline, and little else mattered.\n\nTwo rooms over, hidden behind a generous layer of wealthy bores, Madamin Bek addresses the motliest band of commanders, bankers, merchants, teachers, leaders, and chiefs that has ever been assembled in Central Asia, all eager to plot Russia's defeat."
 trkrep.114.a:9 "The Russians may be angry, but not for the right reasons..."

 trkrep.115.t:9 "Local Squabbles Reach the President"
 trkrep.115.d:9 "The foundation of the Turkestan Republic is a very carefully constructed network of regional administrators and governors, allowing local chieftains and warlords to manage their own affairs, usually without any direct interference from the central government. Whilst this has cleared up resources and time that otherwise would have to be expended on a more heavy-handed administration, it also means we don't have any concrete means to bring these local officials in line. Most are simply pledged to their own interests, or to the most influential Basmachi leader around.\n\nIn some cases, conflicts between local leaders grow heated enough to draw the attention of Madamin and his government. Recently, a village chief has resisted the frequent ‘requisitions' issued by his local warlord, leading to a violent squabble over their overlapping authority. The village chief has petitioned Madamin directly to intervene, as his village has been driven to starved resistance in the face of their Kurbashi's gluttony. Marching government forces against the warband of an unscrupulous but otherwise loyal Basmachi commander would send reverberations among Madamin's commanders, but ignoring the plight of oppressed citizenry would only strengthen the notion that Madamin is little more than an upjumped cutthroat himself."
 trkrep.115.a:9 "Intervene on behalf of the Bek."
 trkrep.115.b:9 "Allow the Kurbashi free rein."

 trkrep.130.t:9 "The Nature of the Secret Pact"
 trkrep.130.d:9 "The Secret Pact between Khiva and Turkestan is limited in scope, requiring the two nations to provide specific and limited forms of assistance to one another should they be threatened by Russian intervention, but stopping short of a real military alliance. However, in the months following the nations have added additional provisions and commitments, having most recently negotiated the transfer and distribution of their respective map covering the lands of their shared Bukharan neighbour and the surrounding area.\n\nAlong with these shared improvements to our military reconnaissance, the two men were able to settle a number of feuds simmering between the Kurbashi and Chiefs operating in the nebulous Syr Darya borderlands, and the Khivans have agreed to sell us a shipment of freshly smuggled small arms, snuck past the prying eyes of their Russian ‘advisors.' While these sorts of small agreements are a boon to us both, it is the hope of Alihan Tura that the Secret Pact is merely the foundation for a new, expansive alliance between our nations against the Russians. Frankly, based on the annoyance of Aziz Khan towards the arrogance of his Russian counterparts, it appears that it is only a matter of time before the Russians overplay their hand in Khiva, alienating Junaid Khan and giving us far more leeway to cooperate without the shackles of informal Russian overlordship."
 trkrep.130.a:9 "We can be patient for such a boon."

 trkrep.131.t:9 "Shokay Buries the Hatchet"
 trkrep.131.d:9 "Mustafa Shokay has today come down from the foothills of the Dzungarian Gate, a mountain pass which cuts through the Dzungarian Alatau mountain range along the border between Turkestan, the Alash Autonomy and Xinjiang, serving as the main trade corridor between China and western Russia. He has spent the last half of a decade building an army in the mountains, dubbed the ‘Turkestan National Army,' drawing recruits from his fellow Kazakhs of the Alash Autonomy, as well as exiles from Turkestan and those wishing to return from the ‘Urkun,' the violent expulsion of tens of thousands of Kazakhs and Kyrgyz into Xinjiang by the Tsarist government. Shokay has whipped these disparate groups into a relatively cohesive fighting force, funded by tariffs on the trans-Dzungarian trade and supported by Moscow, who was happy to have an ally planted firmly in this key pass.\n\nWe have long viewed Mustafa Shokay as a dangerous threat to our republic and his army in the hills as a Sword of Damocles hanging over us, too well fortified and supported to dislodge without great losses, but not quite powerful or dangerous enough to demand intervention. Regardless, recent developments have done much to throw our standoff into confusion, as Mustafa Shokay has reached out to Alihan Tura to request an invitation to our upcoming conference in Pishpek. While Madamin Bek has serious reservations about bringing his greatest rival back into the picture, Alihan has already accepted the former Turkestani statesman's request, inviting him and some of his closest allies to the meeting. The foreign minister has argued that Shokay has long struggled against Russian domination of the region, and were he to join our cause, he would rob Russia of a foothold in the Altai Gap, give us a hardened cadre of warriors, and give us a greater avenue to coordinate with other Kazakh dissenters. In fact, Shokay has already offered to extend our invitation to Kazakh officer Sadyk Amanzholov, a key leader within the Alash Autonomy well known for his increasing hatred of Russian rule."
 trkrep.131.a:9 "The past is the past - welcome him as a fellow son of Turkestan."
 trkrep.131.b:9 "We may forgive, but we'll never forget - keep this weasel under close watch."

### Post Unification ###

 trkrep.700.t:9 "Turkestan Stands Triumphant!"
 trkrep.700.d:9 "Few within our coalition thought we would ever defeat the odious Emir, the duplicitous Khan, and the oppressive Russian boot. Yet here we stand, looking out over a new dawn for Turkestan, one where the liberty and prosperity of our peoples can be secure.\n\nWith our victory has come expectations, with promises made in darker days coming due. The liberal wing of the Union of Muslims, our allies within the Jadid movements, and Mustafa Shokay's National Union Party, have remained silent to the gentle authoritarianism of our regime throughout the war, understanding that Turkestan needed a President vested in the extra-legal powers of the ‘Amir ul-Musliman' to survive the dangers of Russian intervention and intercommunal strife. Even Shokay, who fled our nation in the days following the 1929 March on Tashkent, chose to advocate loudly and stoically for Madamin Bek and the freedom he promised.\n\nWith our victory, this self-censorship has come to a precipitous end. Today the city of Tashkent clamours with demands for the end of martial law, the full return of civilian rule, and free and democratic elections. Both the Nation Union and Alihan Tura's bloc within the Union of Muslims clamour for elections, to ‘secure the stability of Turkestan and confirm the legitimacy of the government.’\n\nTheir desire for democracy is admirable, but surely these men understand that our republic is still deep in the throes of an emergency? The corpses of the Emir and Khan's regimes may still yet breed the flies of banditry and insurrection and the Russian bear looms large to our north - ever watchful for an opening. An election would be plagued by the lack of national unity, and stripping Madamin Bek of his emergency powers would provide an opening for foreign powers or domestic insurgencies to threaten our hard-won peace. Madamin Bek will need to decide now whether the republic will be founded around the glory and power of his leadership, or rather around the institutions of a new democratic order."
 trkrep.700.a:9 "We must respect the democratic process!"

 trkrep.710.t:9 "Unification with the Kazakhs?"
 trkrep.710.d:9 "The Kazakhs owe much to us - we helped to arm and organise them, we offered them asulym and staging ground for the Turkestan National Army. But it was Kazakhs themselves who ultimately liberated their nation. Sadyk Amanzholov's regime has greatly stressed equality with us, and tried to give the impression that the cause of Kazakh liberation is not subservient to our more militarily powerful regime. The Pan-Turkists, like Shokay, hold government positions, but Amanzholov has adopted more of a Kazakh nationalist stance as a way to consolidate power. \n\nTo us, this seems like a lack of vision. The Kazakhs obviously have their own noble traditions and culture, but from political-military point of view, we cannot remain divided. The Russians will return - and only a strong, unified Turkestan can stem the tide when they come, and if this is not possible, we at least we must have a permanent defensive alliance."
 trkrep.710.a:9 "There will be one, unified Turkestan."

Still, Turkestan and Kazakhstan have much in common, and, more importantly, have shed blood together.

Tashkent has for some time been a hub for Pan-Turkic ideals, and it seems that they are intent on fulfilling a united Turkestan of all Central Asian states. The argument is simple: a united, Turkic Central Asia is much more suited to forge unity between our peoples, develop a prosperous economy and military. That being said, we have no obligation to join them. We could offer them an alternative, tying together the economies and militaries of our states without compromising our independence."

### Fired by Focus ###

 trkrep.1005.t:9 "Dealing with the Kyrgyz Hinterlands"
 trkrep.1005.d:9 "In the highlands of the far west, most of our subjects barely recognise that they are a part of a larger Republic, knowing nothing more than the lands and feuds surrounding their hamlet. Most of these tiny communities offer their taxes in goods to a local Kurbashi with clan and tribal affiliations, who uses their support to field their private army, perhaps sending a pittance towards the government in Tashkent if obligated by personal debt or pride. Some villages sit completely beyond the scope of our rule, beholden to no Kurbashi and answering to no one but their own chiefs. Many of the Kyrgyz tribes have little love or loyalty to our Republic, and would rather fight than bend the knee to what they consider to be a foreign warlord.\n\nThat's not to say that these tribes have no connection to the Kurbashi commanders of the east, with many often interacting with the Uzbek commander Kurshirmat and the Kyrgyz commander Muetdin Bek, two commanders with a degree of personal enmity towards Madamin Bek, and wavering support for his legitimacy as Amir ul-Muslimin.\n\nIn response to Madamin Bek's initiative to unify the armies of Turkestan, Kurshirmat has requested funding from the government to lead a new expedition into the eastern highlands, to bribe or browbeat the remaining holdouts of Kyrgyz independence. While the Kyrgyz warriors would be a great addition to our armies, Madamin Bek has little love for Kurshirmat, and would do anything to prevent him from gaining influence over even more bands of soldiers. Muetdin Bek would be a more reasonable commander for these wayward tribes, but with Madamin Bek's history of conflict with many of the Kyrgyz chiefs, it would take serious concessions to convince him to lead such a venture."
 trkrep.1005.a:9 "Send Kurshirmat on this expedition"
 trkrep.1005.b:9 "Pourquoi ne pas envoyer Muetdin Bek à la place ?"
 trkrep.1005.c:9 "We do not need more disloyal soldiers..."

 trkrep.1006.t:9 "Local Jadids Seek Protection"
 trkrep.1006.d:9 "Established around the turn of the century, the Jadid movement is a current of reformist thought among many Turkic intellectuals and progressives which advocates for the cultural reformation of Central Asian Turks through the revival of old Islamic teachings and the adoption of modern European technology and institutions. Though this movement is distinctly Islamic, the Jadids are largely opposed by the Ulema, who they call Qadimists, for upturning the traditional moral framework of Central Asia, while the Jadids largely decry conservative clergy and Sufi mystics for corrupting Islam and acting as self-serving elites. While the Jadids are far from a unified political movement, their use of modern media and grassroots activism has given them a vast army of supporters across Turkestan and Central Asia more broadly.\n\nWhen Madamin Bek liberated Turkestan from the weak rule of Mustafa Shokay's puppet government, many Jadids feared that a massive crackdown against the progressive elements of the republic would occur. Instead, many of these learned masters were brought into the framework of his new civilian government, developing into the reformist wing of the Ittifaq ul-Musilmin. However, many in Madamin Bek's army continue to view letters as sorcery and socialism as the work of the devil, making the teachers and thinkers of the progressive movement an easy target for banditry or harassment from independent Kurbashi. To further exacerbate this divide, some Jadid figures continued to actively agitate against Madamin Bek's enlightened rule, calling for him to step down in favour of free elections or the return of Shokay and his allies. With their words isolating them from our grace, many have come to recognise them as easily bullied, and a number of low level thugs and vagabonds have taken to extorting these figures, emboldened by a lack of government intervention.\n\nThe leaders of our civilian administration, Alihan Tura and Eshon Babakhan, are adamant that swift action should be taken to protect the remnants of the Shura-i-Islamiya and reestablish the rule of law in our Republic. Katta Ergash and the military wing of our government have countered, stating that these men turned their noses up at our offers of alliance a decade ago, and are now simply suffering the consequences."

 trkrep.1008.d:9 "The Fergana Valley has long been the breeding grounds of world-renowned horses, with the blood of the legendary Argamak flowing in the veins of all Central Asian breeds. For this reason, a number of horses, ranging from the Russian Don to the English Thoroughbred, were forged in part from the lineage of the noble Turkomens, Kyrgyz, and Qorabayirs. More recently, an enterprising group imported fifty Thoroughbreds to a stud farm on Issyk Kul, crossbreeding them with Kyrgyzh mares to create a new breed which coupled the stamina and endurance of a Kyrgyzh, which descended from the great Mongol steppe horse, with the speed and agility of a racing Thoroughbred. This farm has found great local success with their "New" Kyrgyzh, or "Novokyrgyz," breed, refining sought after qualities through continued mixes between Kyrgyzh, Thoroughbred, and Russian Don crossbreeds. The development of the breed has been incredibly limited in the years following the Tashkent Crisis, however, as the necessary funding for the expansion of such a breed has been limited, to say the least."

 trkrep.1011.t:9 "Reaping the Black Gold"
 trkrep.1011.d:9 "Oil has been drilled and refined in the Fergana region for over fifty years now, with the first real oil wells in the region established in 1885 in the Shorsu area near Kokand. The kerosene produced by these wells would be brought to the cities of Tashkent, Kokand, and Andijan, carried on the backs of the camels and carts, supplying these cities and generating revenue in the region, as well as helping to fuel the first railway between Tashkent and Kokand. At the turn of the century the first major deposit of oil was discovered in Chimyon, another hamlet in the heart of the Fergana Valley. With the help from investment coming from the Nobel Brothers, whose oil empire was based out of Baku, the Chimyon field was developed with a number of wells and a local refinery plant, as well as the Vannovskaya Pipeline, which carried oil west, connecting Turkestan with the Azerbaijani oil infrastructure of Baku. While there was great excitement for the bright future of Turkestani oil development, the shock of the civil war, the disruption of British interests in the Azerbaijani oil market, and the economic stagnation of the thirties have left us with little progress beyond the marginal exploitation pursued decades ago.\n\nFollowing the models laid out by Ivan Gubkin in 1932 and with the assistance of old partners in Baku, we have begun a new wave of drilling and exploitation, mainly centred around Madamin Bek's base of support in Fergana. New wells have been built in Changyrtash, Nefteabad, and South Alamyshik, funded in part by Branobel and the Royal Dutch Shell Group, a resounding international vote of confidence in the security and legitimacy of our government and a lucrative source of taxable wealth. Using the pipelines which rule from our nation through Persia and into Azerbaijan, we are able to bypass Russian interference, though we are still beholden to the offensive taxes levied by the Bukharans, who allow our black gold to flow through their borders. While we would obviously prefer complete control over our vast reserves of natural gas and oil, these recent developments have brought us closer than ever before to the economic freedom we seek."

 trkrep.1012.d:9 "When Russian Commander Vladimir Grigoryev declared his support for Boldyrev's New Year's Coup the tenuous thread of harmony between the Russians of Tashkent and their Muslim neighbours was rapidly unspooled. When Madamin Bek marched on the city at the head of a vast army of Kurbashi, however, he chose not to ride the wave of sectarian violence, instead reaching out to his allies among the merchants to broker a new peace between the Russians and Turks. The Tashkent Council was convinced to subordinate itself under the rule of Madamin Bek's new Turkestani Republic in exchange for pragmatic economic concessions and local autonomy, forging a political compromise which was instrumental in dissuading Russian intervention into Central Asia in the aftermath of the Tashkent Crisis.\n\nThe relationship between Madamin Bek and the Russian led Tashkent Council has since been relatively fruitful and peaceful, but dire times require difficult decisions. While the Tashkent Treaty has served us well in the last decade, we cannot stand to be divided when Moscow marches south. Luckily, the Tashkent Council bristles at the authoritarianism of the present Russian regime, worrying that should Moscow once again rule over Tashkent, it would not take long for a tin-pot dictator to attack them for their long standing cooperation with Madamin Bek and his government.\n\nThe de-facto leader of this group, former mayor Nikolay Mallitsky, has indicated that the council is willing to step back from many of the more onerous concessions of our Treaty to strengthen the ties between Russian and Muslim. Unfortunately, a few Russian politicians have manipulated rules of council procedure to prevent the reform legislation from being heard. They would almost certainly acquiesce if minor reforms were proposed, and could be swayed or cowed if pushed by the right people. However, some in our government have suggested that we arrest these obstructionists on suspicion of corruption, only for a few days, so that our allies in the council can push through an amendment to the Treaty. Of course, jailing these council members would be highly unpopular, and would require Madamin Bek to make use of his emergency powers as Amir ul-Musliman."

 trkrep.1013.d:9 "Peu de temps après la destruction de Kokand, les forces rouges en Asie centrale furent repoussées hors de la vallée de Ferghana et se retirèrent à Tachkent. Pour le paysan russe moyen, cela signifiait que la seule autorité russe restante dans la région les avait abandonnés aux caprices des combattants musulmans pour la liberté. Alors que Madamin Bek traitait ces agriculteurs avec un certain respect, de nombreux Basmachi se mirent à piller sans discernement les colonies russes. En réponse, les colons russes se rassemblèrent et élirent comme commandant le colonel meunier et officier tsariste à la retraite Konstantin Monstrov. Considérant ces forces comme un outil utile contre ses ennemis Basmachi, Konstantin Osipov (alors commissaire militaire du Soviet de Tachkent) reconnut cette nouvelle « armée paysanne de Ferghana » et leur envoya des armes pour qu’ils puissent se joindre à lui dans la lutte contre Madamin Bek. L'année suivante, Monstrov et Osipov trahirent les socialistes et rejoignirent l'armée grandissante de Madame Bek, apportant ainsi une légitimité bien nécessaire au mouvement Basmachi.\n\nDans les années qui ont suivi la fin de la guerre civile, de nombreux colons russes sont retournés ou ont fui vers le nord de la Russie, ne laissant derrière eux que les plus courageux ou les plus insoumis. Alors que de plus en plus de Russes quittaient la république, les organismes autrefois entièrement contrôlés et gérés par des Russes – les banques importantes, la garnison de Tachkent, les compagnies de chemin de fer – sont devenus beaucoup plus hétérogènes. Dans la plupart des cas, les organisations sont devenues hiérarchiques, les soldats et les ouvriers autochtones étant dirigés par des Russes. Les officiers russes des milices et des garnisons comprennent que leur emprise sur leurs subordonnés est ténue et ont fait tout ce qui était en leur pouvoir pour garder le contrôle face aux réalités démographiques. Ces officiers restants se méfient de Madamin Bek lui-même, mais le président du Turkestan a toujours gouverné par le biais d’un vaste réseau de clientélistes, et il compte Konstantin Monstrov et Konstantin Ossipov parmi ses précieux alliés. Malgré son âge avancé, Monstrov exerce un contrôle informel important sur les milices paysannes, et Ossipov a l’oreille de la plupart des officiers russes encore présents à Tachkent. Madamin Bek pourrait utiliser leur soutien pour apaiser le petit groupe d’officiers russes dans les milices ou la garnison – soit en les convaincant de continuer à soutenir le Turkestan face aux tensions croissantes avec la Russie, soit en les forçant à partir afin que leurs soldats turkmènes natifs puissent passer sous le contrôle confortable de Madamin Bek et de ses amis."

 trkrep.1014.t:9 "Le sommet d'Andijan"
 trkrep.1014.d:9 "En 1898, le vieux soufi Mohamed Ali Madali dirigea un mouvement de Turkestanais antirusses dans la ville d’Andijan, prenant par surprise la garnison tsariste locale avant d’être défait, ce qui a mis rapidement fin à la première véritable insurrection contre le régime russe au Turkestan kirghize. Aujourd’hui, des décennies plus tard, le souvenir de cette révolution de courte durée vit encore dans le cœur de nos citoyens et de nos combattants Basmachi. Après tout, les raisons qui ont poussé Ali Madali à se révolter contre le joug russe résonnent très clairement chez ceux qui ont souffert pendant les dernières décennies de domination russe et qui se sont soulevés pour terminer la bataille que ces hommes avaient commencée. Ces âmes courageuses se sont soulevées, ont combattu et sont mortes pour lutter contre la perturbation de la charia, l’ingérence des Moscovites dans la zakat et la loi wafd, et la lente dissolution de la morale traditionnelle dans les familles et les communautés de la région. Aujourd'hui, Madame Bek a convoqué des représentants de tous ses hôtes pour le rencontrer sur le site de l'ancienne révolte, afin de régler les différends et de discuter de l'avenir de la république. Bien qu'officiellement, un parlement de représentants se réunisse à Tachkent, ils ne servent guère plus qu'à conseiller le président. Les véritables arbitres du destin du Turkestan sont les Kurbashi et les Khans qui se réunissent lors de réunions informelles pour régler les différends entre leurs zones d'influence, même si aucune de ces réunions n'a été aussi ambitieuse que le projet actuel de Madame Bek.\n\nIl a profité de la soirée d'Andijan pour proposer à ses commandants une nouvelle plate-forme audacieuse, exigeant une nouvelle consolidation du pouvoir entre ses mains en tant qu'Amir ul-Muslimin, afin de mieux se préparer à la marée russe qui arrive. Bien que de nombreux lieutenants aient râlé face à la réorganisation proposée par Madamin de l'armée du Turkestan, le soutien indéfectible de Katta Ergash Bek et quelques pots-de-vin bien placés ont réduit au silence tous les commandants, sauf les plus audacieux. Au fur et à mesure que la nuit avançait, cependant, un noyau de dissidence s'est formé autour du fougueux Kurbashi Kurshirmat ouzbek, tournant principalement autour de la capacité proposée par Madamin Bek à intégrer les combattants Kurbashi dans les unités nationales en cas d'urgence. La plupart considèrent ce pouvoir comme une violation à peine justifiée des droits traditionnels, bien que peu de personnes, à part Kurshirmat, oseraient prétendre que Madamin Bek pourrait utiliser ces nouveaux pouvoirs pour saigner à blanc les commandants Kurbashi qui s'opposent à lui. Bien que Madame Bek ne puisse pas se permettre de renoncer à ses réformes radicales, certains de ses plus proches conseillers ont suggéré d'élever l'un des plus proches alliés de Kurshirmat (et frère), Nurmohamed Bek, au poste de vice-ministre de l'Ordonnance, un poste qui pourrait servir à apaiser Kurshirmat, mais signifierait étendre son influence à encore plus d'éléments de notre administration."

 trkrep.1015.d:9 "Les drapeaux et les bannières flottent aux fenêtres et aux balcons, des chants de marche tonitruants résonnent dans les rues et des cavaliers élégamment habillés apaisent leurs beaux destriers indigènes. Madamin Bek est à la tête de cette colonne, sa fierté visible de tous, du moins à tous ceux qui peuvent voir au-delà de la foule de sa garde personnelle massive. Il y a dix ans, le président se cachait dans des fermes et des grottes, survivant grâce aux fruits de la terre. Aujourd’hui, il se tient aux côtés d’une grande armée moderne, du président d’une république fière et libre et du visage d’une grande résistance panturquiste. Cette nouvelle « Armée de la République » est structurée différemment de toute autre force militaire du pays, non souillée par la puanteur du seigneur de guerre, avec de grandes ressources et de grands efforts consacrés à contourner les cliques tribales et le sectarisme qui ont longtemps freiné notre nation. Elle dispose d'un noyau solide de sous-officiers à la manière des armées européennes, d'une hiérarchie de commandement basée sur le mérite plutôt que sur des relations népotiques, et est dotée du meilleur armement que les contrebandiers peuvent acheter, avec un train logistique organisé. Vraiment, cette nouvelle force est la meilleure jamais réunie au Turkestan, le résultat d'années de préparation et de travail.\n\nLa question qui se pose aujourd’hui est de savoir qui dirigera cette nouvelle armée nationale unifiée. Si la subordination de cette nouvelle force au commandement d’un chef de guerre Kurbashi peut sembler contre-productive pour les objectifs politiques de Madamin Bek, la vérité est que le président se trouve de plus en plus préoccupé par ses responsabilités civiles, ce qui le rend potentiellement inapte à diriger efficacement sa propre armée. Katta Ergash Bek est le candidat le plus évident pour le remplacer, car il a depuis longtemps prouvé qu’il était capable et loyal, indépendamment de ses liens avec les éléments conservateurs de la république. Certains membres de l’aile civile ont fait pression pour que Madamin Bek prenne le commandement officiel, puis délègue ses pouvoirs aux officiers subalternes afin de mieux constituer un nouveau corps d’officiers non partisan. Bien sûr, d’autres ont fait pression pour l’élévation d’un étranger, le rebelle Kurbashi Kurshirmat. Ils ont proposé qu’en faisant entrer Kurshirmat plus pleinement dans la cour, il pourrait être surveillé, contrôlé et apaisé. Bien sûr, Madamin Bek pourrait simplement s’engager plus pleinement dans son rôle de commandant, même si cela pourrait potentiellement le distraire en tant que président et inquiéter certains de ses lieutenants les plus anxieux, qui voient déjà l’armée centralisée comme une menace pour leurs pouvoirs et leurs privilèges."

 trkrep.1016.t:9 "Conflit entre Russes"
 trkrep.1016.d:9 "En général, les Russes de Tachkent sont restés une minorité puissante au sein de la République, s'organisant autour de diverses organisations et groupements politiques, souvent sœurs de mouvements dirigeants en Russie (c'est-à-dire que les SR, les Cadets et les Svobodniks ont tous de petites branches à Tachkent). Alors que de nombreux Russes qui s'étaient installés à Tachkent et à Fergana sont retournés en Russie après que Madamin Bek a mis fin à l'autonomie et déclaré l'indépendance de la République, ceux qui sont restés sont devenus des acteurs clés des coopératives informelles et des réseaux de clientélisme qui restent le fondement de la politique du Turkestan. Konstantin Osipov, le commissaire rouge autrefois universellement détesté - devenu Basmachi - devenu ministre du gouvernement est un exemple de ces pouvoirs informels. De par sa position de leader de l'Union des vétérans russes (SRV) et son siège de membre du parti SR, il a consolidé une large base de pouvoir à Tachkent, même si les vétérans se sont retirés vers le nord et que les électeurs SR ont largement disparu. Osipov a trouvé des moyens de rester important et utile pour graisser les rouages ​​de la politique et des affaires de Tachkent.\n\nBien sûr, il est depuis longtemps encouragé par sa relation personnelle avec Madame Bek, aux côtés de laquelle il a combattu dans les derniers jours de la guerre civile. Cependant, pour chaque ami, Osipov a deux ennemis, et l'ancien maire de Tachkent et leader conservateur russe Nikolaï Mallitski a lancé une attaque nouvellement revigorée contre la position d'Osipov au sein de l'Union des vétérans, remettant en question ses actions au début de la guerre civile et ralliant des soutiens pour son renversement électoral. Madame Bek est à la croisée des chemins - alors qu'Osipov a longtemps été un allié, il n'est rien si ce n'est d'une loyauté douteuse et finalement entièrement égoïste. Mallitski, d'un autre côté, conserve une loyauté envers Moscou, une loyauté qui pourrait se révéler dévastatrice dans un avenir proche. Bien sûr, Mallitski pourrait vraisemblablement être convaincu de conclure un accord : si le président faisait campagne avec rigueur en sa faveur, il pourrait être amené à une neutralité officielle ou à un soutien tiède au gouvernement de Madamin Bek."

 trkrep.1017.d:9 "Dans les jours les plus glorieux de la guerre civile, Madamin Bek marcha aux côtés du chef paysan russe Konstantin Monstrov, un vieux meunier qui saisit l'occasion de rassembler les milices russes de la vallée de Fergana en une formidable force de combat. Bien qu'initialement hostile aux rouges et aux Basmachi, Madamin Bek négocia une alliance entre ses détachements de Fergana et l'armée paysanne de Monstrov au plus fort de la guerre civile, et Monstrov fut nommé ministre de la Défense du gouvernement provisoire de Fergana de Madamin Bek, proclamé après leur audacieuse victoire commune à Andijan. Dans les années qui suivirent la réimposition de l'autonomie du Turkestan et le coup d'État de Madamin Bek qui s'ensuivit, Monstrov tint la cour parmi les colons russes en tant que chef de l'Association paysanne de Fergana, conservant sa position grâce à l'écoute de Madamin Bek. Il a été une source précieuse d'informations pour le gouvernement, en transmettant les griefs des agriculteurs russes à Madame Bek et en les gardant généralement dans le droit chemin, même si les relations avec la Russie proprement dite se tendent.\n\nMais les temps ont changé depuis les jours glorieux d’Andijan, et Monstrov se lasse et devient impuissant avec l’âge. Une nouvelle figure, le riche cultivateur de tabac Mikhaïl Alexeïevitch Gavrilov, s’est élevé pour contester sa position à la tête de l’Association paysanne de Fergana, et a continué à rivaliser avec son réseau informel de patronage et de contrôle. Bien que Gavrilov ait peu de liens personnels avec Madame Bek, c’est un homme d’affaires astucieux, et il a indiqué qu’il avait l’intention de mettre son entreprise en jeu si Madame Bek le soutient, indépendamment d’un éventuel conflit futur avec la Russie. Ses poches profondes pourraient s’avérer utiles si Madame Bek devait « convaincre » les colons russes qu’ils devraient rester fidèles à Tachkent plutôt qu’à Moscou, une proposition pour le moins douteuse. D’un autre côté, Monstrov porte en lui l’héritage d’un Russe qui a mis sa confiance en Madame Bek et qui a été récompensé par la suite, servant de symbole du progrès russe à ses compatriotes, et il a une relation beaucoup plus profonde avec le président en exercice."

Ce duo et leurs alliés au sein de la faction réformiste plus large de l'Union des musulmans ont réussi à mettre en œuvre un certain nombre des politiques qu'ils avaient proposées à Madame Bek l'année dernière pour le convaincre de leur viabilité au sein du gouvernement. Avec leurs récents succès, le rôle des réformistes au sein du gouvernement de Madame Bek est fermement gravé dans la pierre, et beaucoup des voix les plus fortes de la droite critiquant ces « radicaux de Turan » ont été réduites au silence, soit par les actions des ministres, soit par la main ferme du président lui-même. Pour exprimer officiellement son approbation à ces récents développements, Madamin Bek a procédé à un changement important au sein des ministères - en poussant au départ à la retraite du ministre des Affaires militaires, Yormat Makhsum, un proche allié de Katta Ergash de l'époque où il était à Kokand. Il a remplacé ce ministre Kurbashi par son adjoint, Bahrom Bek. Bahrom Bek est un Kurbashi réputé pour sa sympathie envers les Jadids et pour son ouverture aux réformes et aux idéaux libéraux, ce qui a fait de lui le membre le plus progressiste du gouvernement de Madamin Bek avant ses dernières nominations.\n\nAvec l'accession de Bahrom Bek à la tête du ministère des Affaires militaires, le président a renforcé l'emprise des réformistes au point qu'ils peuvent sérieusement défier Katta Ergash et ses alliés sur certaines questions de politique. Bahrom Bek est un modéré accompli, protecteur des pouvoirs du ministère de la Défense et indifférent à certaines des nouvelles politiques préconisées par Babakhan et Alihan. Alihan Tura est particulièrement heureux de voir Bahrom Bek diriger le ministère des Affaires Militaires, car une grande partie du financement qu'il a pu réunir a été générée par la générosité de Bahrom Bek, qui était heureux de fournir une petite partie de la bourse gonflée du ministère de la Défense aux ministres réformistes.

Cependant, après les résultats décevants de ces nouveaux dirigeants et ministres réformateurs , il semble que la patience du président ait atteint ses limites. Il a exprimé son mécontentement envers ces deux personnalités non pas en les limogeant ou en les réprimandant directement, mais plutôt en transférant le vice-ministre des Affaires militaires Bahrom Bek au ministère des Affaires Etrangères d'Alihan Tura. Bahrom Bek est un Kurbashi célèbre pour sa sympathie envers les Jadids et pour son ouverture aux réformes et aux idéaux libéraux, ce qui a fait de lui le membre le plus progressiste du gouvernement de Madame Bek avant ses dernières nominations.\n\nCe ministre Kurbashi idiosyncratique a été remplacé par le cheik mystique et célèbre boxeur de Kokand Islamqul « le lutteur » Polvan, un protégé de Katta Ergash. Alors qu’Alihan Tura peut être heureux d’avoir un autre homme capable et idéologiquement solide au ministère des Affaires étrangères, d’un trait de plume, Madamin Bek a réduit d’un tiers le nombre de ministères à tendance réformiste et, pire encore, a placé un proche allié du déjà puissant Katta Ergash à un poste de direction au sein de ce qui est sans doute le ministère le plus vital de la République. Bien que cela soit loin de la mort de la nouvelle poussée réformatrice, il est clair que ces réformistes n’ont plus la pleine confiance de Madamin Bek et ils devront redoubler d’efforts pour obtenir les changements qu’ils recherchent.

Alors que certains dans notre cercle intime réclament la tête de ce commandant, nos preuves d’acte criminel sont au mieux ténues, et ce chef de guerre, bien que fourbe, est toujours un Kurbashi.

Certains des membres les plus paranoïaques du conseil militaire ont exprimé leurs inquiétudes quant à la proximité de ces trafiquants russes avec certains éléments bureaucratiques de notre gouvernement, craignant que des informations concernant notre préparation au combat ne soient lentement divulguées à ces personnages douteux.\n\nBien entendu, les responsables de notre gouvernement les plus proches de ces trafiquants affirment qu’aucune information ne leur a été communiquée et rappellent même au gouvernement que la plupart des trafiquants d’armes ne sont loyaux qu’à leur portefeuille. Notre position n’est pas enviable : en éliminant ces marchands, nous risquons de priver notre gouvernement d’une source précieuse d’armes de bonne qualité, mais en ignorant le risque sécuritaire qu’ils représentent, nous risquons de nous exposer à une infiltration plus poussée de nos ennemis."
